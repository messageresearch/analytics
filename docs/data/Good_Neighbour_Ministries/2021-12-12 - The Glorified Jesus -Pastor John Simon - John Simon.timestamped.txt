[36:07] the lord together
[36:09] may the lord richly bless you please be
[36:11] seated amen
[36:13] [Music]
[36:15] praise god
[36:18] i want to thank the lord for his
[36:20] marvelous work and his grace
[36:26] i want to thank god for every one of you
[36:30] especially those of you who have
[36:33] followed this ministry
[36:36] from the time the lord
[36:39] sent me into the niagara area
[36:44] some of you have followed this word of
[36:47] god for
[36:49] 20 years 25 years
[36:52] walking in the light of the word
[36:55] and
[36:57] as i preach the word at first
[37:01] it seems
[37:03] as if what i was trying to get through
[37:05] to the people not just jesus
[37:09] [Music]
[37:10] you you come and repent and get saved
[37:14] but something deeper than that
[37:17] that you would recognize
[37:20] what he is really doing in our hearts in
[37:23] our lives and in the world today
[37:26] and
[37:28] it it took many years and a long time
[37:32] um as you know any carpenter doesn't hit
[37:34] a nail once and then the nail sticks
[37:38] no he keeps banging the nail so that it
[37:40] goes home
[37:41] and so we kept with the message and
[37:43] finally it seems uh broken through
[37:46] when like paul you can now say this is
[37:50] my gospel amen
[37:52] because you've caught the revelation of
[37:55] the word from from the word of god in
[37:59] your own hearts and i rejoice and thank
[38:01] the lord for that amen
[38:04] it's almost as if i can say like paul
[38:07] or any one of the other apostles or
[38:10] prophets
[38:12] even if your servant departs i can
[38:14] depart in peace
[38:16] knowing that the word has come true now
[38:18] mind you i'm not going anywhere
[38:21] so don't start
[38:22] a lot of you spiritual people your mind
[38:26] god
[38:27] i'm not prophesying nothing
[38:30] i'm just having a talk with you
[38:33] that's all
[38:35] right
[38:36] i'm just letting you see the
[38:38] satisfaction that comes
[38:41] when you know
[38:42] uh even if you're in a conversation you
[38:44] finally okay you got your point over
[38:48] they've caught
[38:50] what you have been trained to say
[38:53] and the beauty of it everybody else is
[38:55] saying the same thing
[38:57] but somehow
[38:59] god gives you an understanding
[39:02] of the very words
[39:05] out of the same bible
[39:07] and it puts something inside of you that
[39:10] gives you such a inspiration
[39:13] that it it makes a big difference
[39:16] you can't even explain it in words
[39:20] you can't give it to somebody else
[39:23] because it's given to you
[39:27] and i just want to thank god for that
[39:30] that
[39:32] as a
[39:33] child
[39:34] at 12 years old i saw a man
[39:38] and at 14 years old not yet not being a
[39:42] member of a church
[39:44] but reading the bible at home
[39:46] the pulsation to preach the gospel
[39:49] struck the soul
[39:50] i've said it before i just say it again
[39:53] 14 years old with a friend of mine we
[39:57] hit the streets began to preach
[39:59] a revival broke out
[40:02] and
[40:03] i repeat again there's still a church
[40:06] there with over 2
[40:08] 500 members because the holy spirit
[40:11] struck the city and just
[40:14] busted the whole thing wide open
[40:17] prostitute gamblers fishermen all kinds
[40:20] of people
[40:21] changed and transformed by the power of
[40:23] god
[40:26] later on i saw it was in the americas
[40:28] magazines in england
[40:30] i don't know if it was in the us
[40:32] but that's what caused
[40:35] a
[40:36] a big preacher in new york
[40:38] hearing about this young boy
[40:41] just just send for me he never saw me in
[40:44] my his life
[40:45] i didn't know him just sent for me to
[40:48] come up to the united states and that's
[40:50] what caused me to come up preached in
[40:53] different places in the u.s and in
[40:54] canada and then i went back
[40:57] and decided to come
[40:59] on my own
[41:01] i'm here today by the grace of god
[41:04] i won't give you my whole story and my
[41:06] old testimony
[41:07] but i am here by the grace of god
[41:11] and you are here by the grace of god
[41:19] and i'm saying this because you're not
[41:21] here by chance
[41:24] right
[41:25] because
[41:26] just like jesus
[41:28] those that are mine
[41:30] god send them to me
[41:33] whether they come from the east west
[41:35] north south black white chinese listen
[41:38] all kinds of people come out of this
[41:40] ministry jews
[41:41] chinese whites blacks people of great
[41:46] power people of great wealth
[41:48] people of poverty all kinds
[41:51] have come out
[41:53] and i'm saying it's also so it goes on
[41:56] record too
[41:58] that i the lord has enabled me to raise
[42:01] churches up from two people
[42:05] and speaking to crowds of two
[42:08] and also to football stadium filled with
[42:12] people
[42:14] of thousands 25 000 and over
[42:18] and
[42:20] until some of those countries
[42:22] the president send out the secret
[42:25] service to find out what is going on if
[42:27] something is destabilizing but it wasn't
[42:30] destabilizing
[42:31] when they find out that it was actually
[42:34] bringing
[42:35] the country and the people together
[42:37] praise the lord i'm just saying that so
[42:40] you see me god bring me here and i'm
[42:43] preaching the god spell and that's how
[42:45] god does things just let it be simple
[42:48] ordinary you don't even recognize what's
[42:51] happening and yes i allow his word his
[42:54] power and his glory to go forth so
[42:59] it's a privilege for me to speak to you
[43:02] as a part of the
[43:04] bride
[43:05] of jesus christ the elect church of god
[43:09] it's a real blessing and a privilege
[43:12] and you are fitted to hear me
[43:15] and i'm fitted to speak the word to you
[43:19] i know some of you would like for me to
[43:21] speak with a texas accent or arkansas
[43:27] i'm sorry i'm starting to break into
[43:30] things here but
[43:33] but
[43:33] i have an accent but it's not from texas
[43:37] or arkansas or somewhere in the south
[43:39] it's from down in guyana south america
[43:44] but you see such things as silly
[43:46] god don't even look at that
[43:48] it's human beings that cause those
[43:52] things to come the vision of nations and
[43:54] people and this and that and all this
[43:57] foolishness
[43:58] and you can't help it because you're in
[44:00] the world so you're going to meet it
[44:01] it's all there you can't help it but we
[44:04] as christians we recognize that we are
[44:07] offspring of the almighty
[44:09] praise the lord and i'm thankful that i
[44:11] could be here
[44:13] to speak the word of god to you
[44:16] now this may sung to you as a simple
[44:20] topic but um i pray the lord jesus
[44:24] christ will take the word and bring it
[44:26] to your attention
[44:28] amen praise the lord
[44:30] hallelujah
[44:32] um
[44:33] also
[44:34] i want you to know
[44:36] that sometimes i speak scattered i just
[44:39] talk and things bounce around like that
[44:43] but the same revival and move of god
[44:45] caused the the assemblies of god
[44:48] denomination at that time
[44:50] gave me a scholarship to their bible
[44:53] college
[44:54] where it's been three years
[44:58] but the thing about it is
[45:00] that's wonderful marvelous but later on
[45:03] when the holy spirit had me praying
[45:06] before i knew anything about any elijah
[45:09] or anything of god
[45:14] i began to pray
[45:16] lord reveal to me what is beyond
[45:19] pentecost
[45:20] because this can't be it pentecost can't
[45:23] be it and tongues can't be the
[45:25] infallible evidence
[45:27] it is on evidence but not the infallible
[45:29] evidence
[45:31] and so that's when
[45:33] god began to unfold the word
[45:35] and expand the word
[45:37] into my heart mind and life
[45:40] and i just want to share with you
[45:42] the unveiling of god hallelujah i'm
[45:46] my scripture is found in john chapter 12
[45:51] verses 20 to 23
[45:55] and my topic
[45:58] is
[45:59] the glorified
[46:00] jesus
[46:02] the glory find jesus or you could say
[46:05] jesus glorified
[46:06] but i prefer to say the glorifying jesus
[46:10] shall we read our scripture together i
[46:13] want to acknowledge brother hutchinson
[46:15] here with us today may god bless his
[46:17] heart
[46:17] and maybe when i'm finished um he'll
[46:20] maybe say a few words to you as he feels
[46:23] inspired okay praise the lord but for
[46:26] now i want to go straight to the word of
[46:29] god and i trust it will bless you
[46:31] remember these things come not just to
[46:34] you
[46:35] but they go out on the airwaves
[46:38] and many are listening and hearing it
[46:42] across the world
[46:44] right so it's a blessing to you so
[46:47] if you think you heard this before and
[46:50] all of that then that's okay but there's
[46:53] other people never heard it on this
[46:55] fashion right and it's a real blessing
[46:58] up for them praise the lord jesus the
[47:01] mate bless us all where it has blessed
[47:04] me and praise the lord
[47:08] and there were certain greeks among them
[47:12] that came up to worship at the feast
[47:17] the same came therefore to philip
[47:21] which was of bethsaida of galilee
[47:25] and desired him saying
[47:28] sir
[47:29] we would see jesus
[47:32] philip cometh and tell it andrew and
[47:35] andrew and philip tell jesus
[47:55] ours come
[47:57] because the people want to see jesus
[48:00] so he has to be glorified to be seen
[48:02] praise the lord hallelujah gracious
[48:05] father we thank you for the reading of
[48:07] the word we pray and ask for help from
[48:10] our teacher the great holy spirit
[48:14] who will come father and as you moved
[48:17] over the waters in genesis
[48:20] may the great holy spirit
[48:23] move upon the waters of the word
[48:26] stir the gospel trumpet lord
[48:31] walk on the water once more and bid us
[48:33] come to thee
[48:35] and may the spirit of god take these
[48:38] thoughts of mind and give them focus and
[48:42] point us to
[48:44] back to your presence unto your word in
[48:47] jesus name amen and amen praise the lord
[48:50] of course pointing you to the word
[48:54] is really trying to get you to sense or
[48:56] see
[48:58] his supernatural presence among us
[49:02] right
[49:03] so when you're reading on the bible the
[49:06] the written word is only a
[49:08] representation
[49:10] for you to recognize that there's
[49:12] another being in this building
[49:14] this is not a person here
[49:17] and that person is not you or me
[49:20] what is the almighty supernatural
[49:22] eternal spirit
[49:24] of the living god
[49:25] and it's the same yesterday today and
[49:28] forever
[49:29] and he doesn't change praise the lord
[49:32] and we thank god god is glorified in the
[49:35] universe how many knows that
[49:38] you just look at the
[49:40] the universe
[49:42] and you see
[49:43] god glorified in in the universe that's
[49:47] out there the moon the heavens declare
[49:50] the glory of god amen praise the lord
[49:55] god glorified in his great creation
[49:59] you look around and you see all his
[50:01] creative acts and you just
[50:05] are left speechless with amazement at
[50:08] the great artistry and
[50:12] the great might of this one this being
[50:15] that has made all these wonderful things
[50:19] amen
[50:20] you come to the human
[50:22] body amen last night i was just showing
[50:26] a brother an old book that uh from um
[50:29] 1916
[50:31] um
[50:32] that speaks of
[50:35] god's masterpiece
[50:37] that's the name of the book uh god's
[50:40] masterpiece but you see these last
[50:42] things were just thrown around and
[50:45] hidden up
[50:46] they're all based everywhere in the
[50:48] world but praise god i tell you man is
[50:52] another evidence of the glory of god
[50:56] you just look a human being we look
[50:58] ordinary but let me tell you when a
[51:00] scientist or a doctor start looking at
[51:03] these teeny-weeny nerves and looking at
[51:06] all these teeny things that they're all
[51:08] functioning to keep you alive they are
[51:11] left with astonishment
[51:14] it's so amazing that one of them have to
[51:16] just study hands alone
[51:19] and become a so-called specialist and
[51:22] there's one person that made all
[51:24] everything amen
[51:27] praise god so we thank god that he is
[51:31] glory be to his great name
[51:34] we also have seen some great ministries
[51:37] on this planet
[51:39] for you i've seen many
[51:42] and the last great ministry that we know
[51:46] of is brother william marion branham
[51:49] he's even marveled by
[51:52] all the various preachers out there
[51:55] and i've i've seen them and i've seen
[51:58] the holy spirit manifest through them
[52:02] many some of them not their names are
[52:04] not written down anywhere but i've seen
[52:08] them
[52:08] oh my in mighty power
[52:11] man i've seen the tail off the ending
[52:15] point of old fash old-time pentecost
[52:18] when it was dying out seeing those men
[52:22] stand there and preach the word and
[52:24] while they are preaching demons will
[52:26] start to scream out and people would be
[52:29] falling on the ground and they're not
[52:31] shouting they're just talking
[52:32] just talking
[52:34] right
[52:35] they're just talking and things would be
[52:37] happening praise god like that and i
[52:41] give god the glory i i've been in it
[52:44] there as a young man where some of those
[52:47] old men in prayer and they come out and
[52:49] say well you know on sunday there's a
[52:53] brother that's coming and he's going to
[52:56] be dressed this way and he is going to
[52:59] preach for us on sunday and so let's
[53:03] pray and believe god and expect the
[53:05] brother and so we come to church and
[53:08] we're singing and we're praising god and
[53:10] we're praying and
[53:12] you know people are waiting and
[53:14] everything else and the next thing you
[53:15] know the door pushes we have there's a
[53:17] pastor there but he he heard the word
[53:20] and uh
[53:22] and there you know the brother comes in
[53:24] with his bible and he sits down thinking
[53:26] that nobody knows him
[53:29] and then they just call him and the
[53:31] whole thing he ends up coming and
[53:32] preaching the word of god but over and
[53:35] over
[53:36] i i've seen it where where where the
[53:39] brother
[53:40] they're having a lord supper and
[53:42] somebody comes to take the cup he says
[53:44] no
[53:45] you touch that cup and they'll pack you
[53:48] out of here
[53:49] right
[53:50] so i i seen it so when i hear somebody
[53:54] else say the same thing in the same way
[53:56] that's real brother that's not a joke
[54:00] we're not guessing
[54:02] but it's real
[54:04] you see it's gotten to the point now
[54:06] where people think we're just telling a
[54:07] lot of religious myths and stories
[54:11] just to get people into a religious
[54:13] atmosphere where we can sing and shout
[54:16] and dance and everything else and be
[54:18] caught up in some kind of a religious
[54:21] fantasy or fantastic but it's not that
[54:24] it's real
[54:27] but because time has passed it's waved
[54:30] in the wind in the mind of the people
[54:32] amen hallelujah
[54:35] you see what i want to show you today
[54:39] is that
[54:41] you may know jesus real well
[54:45] you may know your bible real well
[54:48] you may know the scriptures real well
[54:52] you might have
[54:53] walked as a christian as a believer
[54:56] 20 30 years
[54:59] serving god reading your bible and
[55:02] everything else like that but my
[55:05] brother's sister
[55:06] you still
[55:07] did not recognize the fullness of who he
[55:12] is who he was who he is
[55:15] even though walking with him
[55:18] and as many a believer knows their bible
[55:21] and they know it inside and out
[55:24] they then they can quote it
[55:27] so accurately
[55:29] that you can't say anything to them
[55:32] because they know their bible
[55:34] and the structure of it
[55:37] and many knows the message of this hour
[55:41] which we have heard
[55:43] and
[55:44] every quote every line every sermon they
[55:48] they heard it they know it that's
[55:50] wonderful that you know it but
[55:53] you still don't have a revelation of it
[55:57] and that is a totally different matter
[56:00] amen
[56:03] you know
[56:05] when you look to the word of god
[56:08] you'll find out
[56:10] that
[56:11] many of his disciples knew him in his
[56:14] natural life
[56:16] then you jesus
[56:18] uh as a natural boy
[56:21] then who is mother
[56:22] then you where he come from in nazareth
[56:25] uh that's why when he said um
[56:29] that the son of man is going back into
[56:32] heaven
[56:33] or
[56:34] um
[56:35] i come down from heaven
[56:38] what are you talking about
[56:40] you see that's another realm
[56:43] they're looking at this one
[56:45] at his natural existence
[56:48] where he is
[56:49] their noise from nazareth
[56:51] they know he
[56:53] was mary's uh boy child uh
[56:57] they played with him no doubt in the
[56:59] streets
[57:00] and now he's telling you yeah you know
[57:03] this part of me but the other part of me
[57:06] come from somewhere else
[57:08] the other part this point here this part
[57:12] here
[57:13] they can kill but this other part here
[57:17] amen they can't kill it's eternal
[57:20] it's the lord of glory
[57:23] amen they can't do nothing about that
[57:25] praise god hallelujah you kill this body
[57:28] i raise it up again
[57:31] oh my praise god so he's showing you the
[57:34] difference
[57:36] a little bit of the difference
[57:38] and when people hear to believe the word
[57:43] they just think it's just believing the
[57:45] bible
[57:47] because that's just believing like i uh
[57:49] yeah i believe him because i know he was
[57:52] born in nazareth you can see this you
[57:54] can feel this you can touch this you can
[57:56] read this you can analyze this debate
[57:59] this study it and know it from cover to
[58:02] cover all the background all the greek
[58:05] all that that doesn't mean a thing you
[58:09] don't know him yet
[58:11] i'm talking about the being
[58:14] the spirit being the anointed being
[58:18] that is behind this book
[58:20] that you might know him
[58:23] in the power
[58:25] of his resurrection
[58:28] oh praise god you can't know him
[58:32] until nobody really knew him until after
[58:35] he was resurrected
[58:38] amen
[58:40] praise god
[58:42] you know
[58:44] how they crucified him
[58:48] and how
[58:49] he was raised from the dead
[58:52] and how
[58:54] when he rose that morning
[58:57] mary magdalene went to the tomb how many
[59:00] knows that story
[59:02] and when she went there we've been
[59:05] crying
[59:06] and everything else
[59:08] i'll just bring it to the point where
[59:10] she see um sees a man in their
[59:14] graveyard
[59:17] and the bible says thinking he was a
[59:19] gardener
[59:21] is that right
[59:23] she had her own thoughts of who he was
[59:27] but it was the very jesus christ
[59:30] that she had walked with
[59:32] that she had eaten with that she knew
[59:35] familiar with
[59:37] and you may be familiar with the bible
[59:40] but then all you see is seeing him as a
[59:44] gardener or something else but you don't
[59:46] have a clear recognition of who he is
[59:51] oh praise god the spirit of god rides
[59:55] on the white horse of the word of god
[59:58] and it's him the white horse rider that
[1:00:02] you need to know
[1:00:03] you don't need to know just the horse
[1:00:05] that is using the medium the means you
[1:00:08] need to know him
[1:00:10] in the power of his resurrection
[1:00:13] and as he reveals himself to you
[1:00:16] and you can't get that by studying a
[1:00:19] bible school
[1:00:21] because he says eye open
[1:00:23] and no man shut and when i shut no man
[1:00:26] opens
[1:00:27] god has to give you that grace
[1:00:30] god has to give you that revelation that
[1:00:33] inspiration
[1:00:34] hallelujah
[1:00:36] did not i ordain you when before the
[1:00:40] foundation of the world
[1:00:42] before your mother had you in her belly
[1:00:45] i knew you and i ordained you to be a
[1:00:49] prophet he said to jeremiah
[1:00:51] and to every believer every christian
[1:00:54] god is saying i knew you
[1:00:58] i knew you i elected you are your day
[1:01:00] lord for you
[1:01:02] and i place you here in this age this
[1:01:05] time to represent me by the opening of
[1:01:08] the word hallelujah praise be to god
[1:01:12] amen she thought he was a gardener
[1:01:15] imagine that she claimed she was
[1:01:18] familiar with the word but yet the word
[1:01:21] seemed to be a stranger to her
[1:01:24] when the word got resurrected the
[1:01:27] resurrected
[1:01:28] word
[1:01:29] seemed like a stranger to her
[1:01:32] it's all right if i talk like this i'm
[1:01:35] just taking my time praise the name of
[1:01:37] the lord to talk to you so that you
[1:01:40] might understand here
[1:01:42] that the difference between just the
[1:01:45] word
[1:01:46] and the resurrected word is that right
[1:01:49] for the word as you know was entombed
[1:01:53] for centuries within
[1:01:55] these denominational gates of the romish
[1:01:58] church
[1:02:00] and the enthuse of the word down through
[1:02:04] history but then god began a
[1:02:08] resurrection of the word through
[1:02:10] luther
[1:02:12] wesley
[1:02:13] same three days but spiritually now
[1:02:16] right back up to pentecost up to our day
[1:02:19] and time the word of god has been
[1:02:21] resurrected and raised up again
[1:02:24] and we have been given that word now
[1:02:28] being revealed to us
[1:02:30] now
[1:02:31] not an angel at the tomb there telling
[1:02:33] you he's not here he's not here he's
[1:02:36] risen
[1:02:37] uh he he's written up from the dead
[1:02:40] but but god sent an anointed messenger
[1:02:44] in this last day to tell us that
[1:02:47] that he is not there he's risen
[1:02:50] praise the lord hallelujah he's raised
[1:02:54] up and he's alive forevermore
[1:02:57] he's gone from just being in a natural
[1:03:00] body back to the spirit body
[1:03:03] son of man
[1:03:05] son of god
[1:03:06] son of david you see god changing his
[1:03:10] office moving by his holy spirit
[1:03:14] glory to god so
[1:03:16] she did not know him but she thought he
[1:03:20] was a gardener
[1:03:22] she only recognized him when he called
[1:03:25] her name
[1:03:27] praise god and when god calls your name
[1:03:31] by the opening or the unsealing of the
[1:03:35] word of the book then you'll recognize
[1:03:38] your name being called as an individual
[1:03:43] hallelujah
[1:03:44] oh praise god i might as well speak
[1:03:46] spanish or greek or something if god
[1:03:48] hasn't given you a revelation
[1:03:50] but if god gives you a revelation it's
[1:03:52] cure and it's clear
[1:03:55] but my goodness god called her name he
[1:03:58] knows your name
[1:03:59] how many of you know that
[1:04:01] he knows your name
[1:04:03] praise god and i'm not talking about my
[1:04:05] name john or james or jim
[1:04:08] but your real name
[1:04:11] that he knew you by before the
[1:04:14] foundation of the world
[1:04:16] when he tell them disciples i had joy
[1:04:18] with you before the foundation of the
[1:04:21] world
[1:04:22] amen i had joys with you before the
[1:04:25] foundations hallelujah he knows your
[1:04:28] name
[1:04:30] praise god
[1:04:31] you see just like how when he came down
[1:04:35] call his name when he gets down here
[1:04:37] call his name jesus but that's that's
[1:04:40] his earthly name that's the name we know
[1:04:43] him by when he comes to earth right but
[1:04:46] it's the same way when you come here
[1:04:48] your mother and your father gave you a
[1:04:50] name
[1:04:51] but that's not the name god knows you by
[1:04:54] that's just a name for you to be
[1:04:55] recognized here on this earth but god
[1:04:58] knows you by your real name out there
[1:05:01] and when the word of god is preached
[1:05:04] hallelujah your name is in this word so
[1:05:08] when a preacher really preaches the word
[1:05:10] and he hits your name
[1:05:12] you might know what your name is because
[1:05:14] of your spiritual amnesia condition but
[1:05:17] when that name is called and spoken it
[1:05:20] makes something move in your heart
[1:05:22] i don't care if your back is turned and
[1:05:24] somebody called your name you turn
[1:05:26] around because you want to know if it's
[1:05:27] you amen and when the word of god is
[1:05:30] preached no matter how steep you are in
[1:05:33] sin unbelief or doubt and the word of
[1:05:35] god is speech it strikes a chord within
[1:05:38] your soul
[1:05:39] amen
[1:05:40] your tympanic membrane of your ears
[1:05:43] begin to resonate because you recognize
[1:05:46] that you heard something praise god
[1:05:48] something struck your soul amen
[1:05:51] the deep crawls to the deep and the deep
[1:05:54] must respond amen
[1:05:56] hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah i
[1:06:01] want you to know it's the very truth
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:04] glory to god hallelujah amen listen
[1:06:10] one day
[1:06:11] after jesus had
[1:06:14] was crucified dead buried and raised
[1:06:17] again
[1:06:18] the disciples didn't recognize he was
[1:06:21] raised and they were walking going back
[1:06:24] to ms
[1:06:26] with a sad heart
[1:06:29] because
[1:06:30] they feel the lord was now gone
[1:06:34] and while they were walking
[1:06:37] the bible tells us
[1:06:39] how out of the bushes
[1:06:42] their step the man
[1:06:44] and the man began to speak to them and
[1:06:48] say why are you so sad why are you
[1:06:51] troubled
[1:06:53] what's going on
[1:06:55] and
[1:06:56] what was their answer to him if you will
[1:07:00] look in your bible luke 24 18 don't do
[1:07:04] it now but just so it's there
[1:07:07] they asked him are you a stranger here
[1:07:12] are you a stranger here
[1:07:15] that you would ask us what happened
[1:07:18] and they begin to tell him how jesus of
[1:07:20] nazareth was crucified and everything
[1:07:23] else and there were his believers and
[1:07:26] followers and and and now he's gone
[1:07:29] the lord is gone
[1:07:31] right oh my brother sister you see what
[1:07:34] i'm saying
[1:07:36] these men
[1:07:38] had walked with him
[1:07:40] they had eaten with him
[1:07:43] yet that slept on the trees and in caves
[1:07:47] with him
[1:07:49] they went fishing with him
[1:07:52] and yet
[1:07:53] when he rose with his resurrected
[1:07:56] body
[1:07:58] they did not recognize him
[1:08:01] the same word
[1:08:03] but now in a
[1:08:05] resurrected
[1:08:06] form
[1:08:08] they did not recognize him
[1:08:10] and that is what i'm trying to tell you
[1:08:13] that sometimes when i preach like this
[1:08:16] people don't recognize what you're
[1:08:17] talking about
[1:08:19] you sound like you're out of space or
[1:08:22] you're missing a screw somewhere
[1:08:25] right
[1:08:27] but they don't realize
[1:08:28] what
[1:08:29] is going on
[1:08:33] from ms
[1:08:34] they walked all day long talking with
[1:08:36] him amen
[1:08:39] praise god
[1:08:41] and then the bible says
[1:08:44] when they said art that was strange i
[1:08:46] hear the scripture will tell you for
[1:08:50] their eyes were holden
[1:08:52] in other words their eyes weren't open
[1:08:56] they were still spiritually blind
[1:08:59] they knew the word in person
[1:09:02] they walked with the word for three and
[1:09:05] a half years
[1:09:06] they're at the bible they slept with the
[1:09:08] bible they studied it from cover to
[1:09:11] cover they walk with it in every way
[1:09:14] and yet when it comes back now in a
[1:09:19] in a revelation
[1:09:20] form they say art thou a stranger here
[1:09:24] for their eyes were holden
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:29] then the bible continues on then the
[1:09:32] bible says he
[1:09:34] explained to them the scriptures from
[1:09:36] moses and the prophets he began to
[1:09:39] explain and show to them that it was
[1:09:42] christ all the way amen it was christ in
[1:09:45] the substitute cripes in all the shadows
[1:09:48] christ in the types christ in the high
[1:09:51] priest christ in every tradition that
[1:09:54] they had the tradition was only a shadow
[1:09:57] on the wall of time pointing to his
[1:10:00] coming amen praise god and if you have a
[1:10:03] hand here and a shadow hits the wall you
[1:10:06] got to have the reality somewhere else
[1:10:10] the reality has got to be there but you
[1:10:13] keep following the shadow
[1:10:16] this is not the day of shadows
[1:10:19] at evening time it shall be light
[1:10:22] light again for this hour
[1:10:25] that we are living in praise peter god
[1:10:29] hallelujah
[1:10:30] amen that didn't realize
[1:10:33] that it was jesus that they were talking
[1:10:35] to
[1:10:36] they didn't recognize it they didn't
[1:10:38] realize it was him praise god and that
[1:10:42] didn't recognize it until he got them
[1:10:45] into a little house
[1:10:48] when he said master come in and have a
[1:10:50] meal with us
[1:10:52] don't go
[1:10:53] praise god until you come and sick with
[1:10:56] us
[1:10:57] and when he got them into the little
[1:10:58] house
[1:11:00] then he says peace be unto you
[1:11:03] and he broke the bread
[1:11:06] hallelujah
[1:11:07] and the way he broke it is the way he
[1:11:10] used to break it when he was there with
[1:11:12] them physically
[1:11:14] and when they saw that they recognized
[1:11:17] and the bible said it is the lord all
[1:11:19] glory to god hallelujah may you
[1:11:22] recognize it is the lord
[1:11:26] god
[1:11:28] in his resurrected body
[1:11:31] the word
[1:11:32] in a revealed body
[1:11:36] not just the word but the revealed word
[1:11:40] you see people wants to argue on the
[1:11:42] body they want to like they dispute over
[1:11:46] moses body they want to argue over the
[1:11:48] world they debate the word but truth is
[1:11:52] stated truth once you have arrived at
[1:11:55] the foundational truth of god's word no
[1:12:00] nothing can move you shift your left
[1:12:02] back frontway because you've seen the
[1:12:04] truth
[1:12:05] it can't be changed it's one truth
[1:12:09] the devil tried to tell you there's many
[1:12:11] truths
[1:12:12] your truth my truth his truth her truth
[1:12:15] even make up songs about these truths
[1:12:18] but there's only one truth
[1:12:20] and god said let me be true and every
[1:12:23] other man's
[1:12:24] be alive
[1:12:27] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:12:31] glory to god hallelujah
[1:12:34] amen got you inside the house and that's
[1:12:36] where he likes to get every one of us he
[1:12:39] likes to get you in the little room
[1:12:41] all by yourself and sometimes it takes
[1:12:44] for god to get you in the little room of
[1:12:47] your own heart
[1:12:49] where that quiet voice
[1:12:51] just begins to speak with you
[1:12:54] that's why when you pray it's not always
[1:12:57] praying and just keeping a lot of loud
[1:12:59] noise or praising god all the time
[1:13:02] sometimes you gotta shut down everything
[1:13:05] and just get quiet
[1:13:07] in the presence of the lord
[1:13:10] and be still
[1:13:12] and then you'll start to know
[1:13:14] that i am god
[1:13:16] because he starts speaking to you in
[1:13:18] this little room
[1:13:19] of your heart
[1:13:21] like no man can talk to you and when he
[1:13:24] speaks to you you'll know he's talking
[1:13:26] to you
[1:13:27] because god will respect us god will
[1:13:29] tell you anything whether you get mad
[1:13:31] sad glad or whatever he'll speak to you
[1:13:35] and let you know what he has to say to
[1:13:38] you
[1:13:39] in the little room of your heart praise
[1:13:41] god and i thank god that that's a place
[1:13:44] that i can escape to
[1:13:46] any time and whenever i want i can
[1:13:49] escape to that little room in the
[1:13:51] presence of the living god hallelujah
[1:13:54] amen yes my brother sister you find
[1:13:58] that do you believe that a person
[1:14:02] or even you may be spiritually blind

[1:14:09] me and you see me and you're saying how
[1:14:11] can you tell me i'm blind
[1:14:13] because i'm seeing you
[1:14:15] how can you tell me i'm blind i'm seeing

[1:14:40] right now you're blind to all these
[1:14:43] things taking place you can't see that
[1:14:45] because you're not of that dimension
[1:14:48] is that right
[1:14:50] it takes the quickening power the holy
[1:14:51] spirit to put you there
[1:14:53] before you can recognize that but praise
[1:14:57] god hallelujah amen because look at them
[1:15:00] at the emails when he came
[1:15:04] surely they loved the lord jesus
[1:15:08] they loved him just as much as you loved
[1:15:10] him
[1:15:11] and we love him
[1:15:14] and
[1:15:15] they think that he was dead
[1:15:17] hallelujah you come out on a sunday
[1:15:20] morning like this
[1:15:22] and i'm preaching the gospel and many
[1:15:24] other preachers preaching the gospel and
[1:15:26] you think that this is just uh fairy
[1:15:29] tales or a story tall from 1900 years
[1:15:32] ago that has now become a tradition and
[1:15:36] turned into a religion and now we have
[1:15:39] churches built on this religion and on
[1:15:42] this fate and and we just keep it and we
[1:15:45] just go like that i want to tell you
[1:15:48] that's not so we are serving one who is
[1:15:51] alive
[1:15:52] a living god
[1:15:54] he is alive forevermore he lives
[1:15:57] and reigns forevermore
[1:16:00] praise god our foundations is not on
[1:16:03] fiction but upon this rock i'll build my
[1:16:06] church
[1:16:08] upon revelation of the word of build my
[1:16:10] church
[1:16:11] on his resurrection
[1:16:13] will build the church amen praise god
[1:16:17] hallelujah let me quote here out of the
[1:16:20] seven compound names of jehovah are you
[1:16:23] a stranger here
[1:16:24] think of it
[1:16:26] thinking of him just as a stranger he
[1:16:29] had walked with them act with them
[1:16:32] slept with them for three and a half uh
[1:16:35] years and
[1:16:37] and walking by his side and they didn't
[1:16:40] know him
[1:16:42] just imagine
[1:16:43] they were in jesus's church
[1:16:46] he was their pastor
[1:16:49] they heard every sermon that jesus
[1:16:52] preached
[1:16:53] and yet when he came with his
[1:16:55] resurrected body stood right in front of
[1:16:58] them they were spiritually blind they
[1:17:02] did not recognize him
[1:17:05] they didn't recognize who was talking to
[1:17:07] them you see oh my see
[1:17:11] that was stranger here and he said oh
[1:17:14] you fools and slowing heart to believe
[1:17:17] and to know
[1:17:19] really what the prophet had said
[1:17:23] to you i am i'm less saying what what's
[1:17:26] here amen and he went back in the
[1:17:29] scriptures
[1:17:31] and hearing him teach them for three and
[1:17:34] a half years six months
[1:17:37] they would have recognized that teaching
[1:17:40] that they had received for three and a
[1:17:42] half years six months directly from
[1:17:45] jesus
[1:17:46] the word out to the word itself
[1:17:50] but still
[1:17:51] there was something holding
[1:17:54] that they could not see beyond the
[1:17:56] written word amen
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:02] they did not know
[1:18:03] that he was
[1:18:05] risen
[1:18:06] he's just a story
[1:18:08] and people just all they think that they
[1:18:10] have to do is make sure that they stay
[1:18:13] close to jesus and know how to pack his
[1:18:16] body
[1:18:22] they pack his body away
[1:18:24] oh my i tell you but they don't realize
[1:18:28] that he is not here
[1:18:31] he's risen
[1:18:33] he's alive
[1:18:34] he's a resurrective
[1:18:36] this is just a representation
[1:18:38] this is just a starting point i'm
[1:18:40] preaching here but this is just like a a
[1:18:43] springboard for for the swimming pool
[1:18:47] right
[1:18:48] you come off of this so that you can
[1:18:50] enter into the next round and bring the
[1:18:54] word of god the food of the and the
[1:18:56] bread of life the spirit of god back to
[1:18:59] his people amen praise the name of the
[1:19:02] living god amen praise god oh my praise
[1:19:06] god hallelujah
[1:19:08] you could walk with him and you don't
[1:19:10] even know it
[1:19:12] do you know that
[1:19:13] walk with him
[1:19:15] and don't even know it
[1:19:17] hallelujah
[1:19:19] get out of a sick bed when you come out
[1:19:22] of your sick bed
[1:19:24] you turn around
[1:19:26] how many of you turn around you thank
[1:19:28] the doctor
[1:19:29] thank the doctor
[1:19:31] for bringing you
[1:19:32] out
[1:19:34] of the sick bed but really you should
[1:19:37] have thanked the doctor
[1:19:39] and then thank you doctor and i
[1:19:41] appreciate what you did but back of all
[1:19:44] that really
[1:19:45] it was jesus christ that did that
[1:19:47] hallelujah
[1:19:49] it was jesus christ that did that
[1:19:52] because the doctor can do cut and sow
[1:19:55] and do whatever he has to do but god
[1:19:58] still has to do the healing
[1:20:00] god has to do the deliverance
[1:20:02] he can give you the medicine but god
[1:20:04] still has to deliver you
[1:20:06] they say oh i'm going to give you this
[1:20:08] medicine i'm going to give this i'm
[1:20:10] going to do that and then i'll let
[1:20:12] nature take its course
[1:20:14] what nature it's god
[1:20:16] it's jesus christ
[1:20:18] you've got to recognize him amen
[1:20:21] many times the unrecognized presence of
[1:20:24] god in our lives and we don't recognize
[1:20:27] that he is the one
[1:20:29] that has done it is doing it and will do
[1:20:31] it for you
[1:20:33] as you believe him
[1:20:35] in the word
[1:20:38] who kept you from an accident
[1:20:42] you see
[1:20:43] oh no but you he kept you from the
[1:20:46] accident
[1:20:47] uh you know you turn around you thank
[1:20:49] the the driver of the hair vehicle and
[1:20:52] tell him how smart he was and how quick
[1:20:55] your reaction and your mind was and your
[1:20:58] intellect is very sharp and everything
[1:21:01] else and you swiftly you knew exactly
[1:21:04] which way to swing the wheel and all of
[1:21:07] that sort of stuff but amen but behind
[1:21:10] it all it was christ it was jesus christ
[1:21:14] that did that my brother sister
[1:21:16] hallelujah amen we're not just looking
[1:21:20] at the natural things but back of it all
[1:21:22] is god himself working in the shadows
[1:21:26] watching over his own and bringing us
[1:21:28] back to himself for his glory amen
[1:21:31] praise the name of the lord
[1:21:33] maybe you were in a state of depression
[1:21:37] and you're worrying where your next meal
[1:21:39] is coming
[1:21:40] from where your rent money is coming
[1:21:43] from
[1:21:44] how are you going to make your car
[1:21:46] payments
[1:21:48] and maybe
[1:21:49] some
[1:21:50] kind-hearted neighbor come
[1:21:53] and help you out
[1:21:56] or gave you some food to eat
[1:22:00] and you thanked that person that woman
[1:22:03] that man
[1:22:04] but really behind all of that it was
[1:22:07] christ working through that man or that
[1:22:10] woman to glorify himself amen
[1:22:15] it's christ
[1:22:16] not the one dead back and put in a grave
[1:22:19] back there but the resurrected one
[1:22:22] the glorifying jesus
[1:22:25] that's fulfilling his word
[1:22:27] to give him glory and honor praise the
[1:22:30] name of the lord
[1:22:32] i want you to see here brother sister
[1:22:35] that one
[1:22:36] also around this resurrection time
[1:22:40] how that peter
[1:22:42] you know like a lot of people today well
[1:22:44] you know
[1:22:46] they say jesus is risen you know but
[1:22:49] jesus is dead
[1:22:52] and the prophet is gone so many years
[1:22:55] and uh i'm tired of that i go fishing
[1:22:59] amen they're fishing around to find some
[1:23:02] new thing
[1:23:04] fishing around to believe something
[1:23:07] and while they were out fishing the
[1:23:09] bible said they were fishing all night
[1:23:12] and while they were in that denomination
[1:23:15] throwing out the net to win a few souls
[1:23:19] a fishing all night
[1:23:22] and when they came closer
[1:23:24] they saw a man standing
[1:23:27] on the shore
[1:23:30] and
[1:23:31] stranger on the shore
[1:23:34] who is this stranger
[1:23:36] on the shores of tiberias
[1:23:40] and right now one can
[1:23:42] visualize how it is because i've been
[1:23:45] there to the lake tiberias you've been
[1:23:47] there too lag time beers where they
[1:23:49] catch the the fish even now they still
[1:23:52] catch those fish they're in lake
[1:23:54] tiberias and my brother's sister a
[1:23:58] stranger standing on the shore
[1:24:02] and
[1:24:03] uh
[1:24:05] children have you any meat
[1:24:08] and
[1:24:09] one of them said wait a minute
[1:24:12] that is the lord uh the voice the the
[1:24:15] tone of voice that's not to be the lord
[1:24:18] hallelujah there's a certain sound to
[1:24:20] the genuine gospel brother sister
[1:24:23] there's a certain sound to it that
[1:24:26] you'll recognize that that's the voice
[1:24:28] of god speaking to your soul
[1:24:31] and right away
[1:24:33] the bible says peter was dressed like a
[1:24:34] fisherman of course he didn't have on
[1:24:36] those shirts you know just there with
[1:24:39] his shorts on and everything else rough
[1:24:41] and ready
[1:24:42] and the bible said when you see he
[1:24:45] they say it is the lord and he looked
[1:24:47] and he realizes the lord the bible said
[1:24:51] that peter jumped out to that
[1:24:53] denominational boat and jumped right
[1:24:56] into the world he jumped in the water he
[1:24:59] jumped and began to swim in it and came
[1:25:02] right to the shore right to the lord
[1:25:05] jesus christ hallelujah
[1:25:08] glory to god
[1:25:09] and when they got there the bible said
[1:25:12] jesus already had fish and bread already
[1:25:17] cooked and ready for them to eat
[1:25:21] oh praise god let me tell you god has a
[1:25:24] store

[1:25:39] oh praise god i'm glad that i have
[1:25:42] partaken of the seven course meal by the
[1:25:45] lord the greatest chef the world has
[1:25:47] ever known jesus christ served the
[1:25:49] seventh seal mystery of the word of god

[1:25:55] course of it glory to god and i'm just
[1:25:58] filled with him and i thank god for the
[1:26:01] word i thank god for his presence and
[1:26:04] his person amen
[1:26:06] glory to god hallelujah amen glory to
[1:26:09] god
[1:26:10] stranger on the shore amen
[1:26:14] oh praise god hallelujah brother sister
[1:26:18] i tell you
[1:26:20] maybe you can take some of these
[1:26:21] thoughts and turn them in the messages
[1:26:24] are now a stranger here
[1:26:27] can you imagine having a bible college
[1:26:30] and he's a stranger in there
[1:26:33] they want to discourse
[1:26:34] apologetics and hermeneutics
[1:26:37] and eschatology
[1:26:39] and all of these lofty marvelous
[1:26:42] subjects and how to preach topically and
[1:26:44] expositionally and so on and so on so on
[1:26:47] and this and that and it got him to the
[1:26:49] side
[1:26:50] he's off to the side ah that was
[1:26:52] stranger here
[1:26:53] are you a stranger in the court the
[1:26:54] stranger in the white house you're a
[1:26:56] stranger in the school put him out here
[1:26:58] put him out of there put him out there
[1:27:00] and he got to be outside his church
[1:27:02] knocking on the door to come into his
[1:27:05] own church
[1:27:06] in the last day they won't let him in
[1:27:09] because they have a concept of how they
[1:27:12] think the word of god should be preached
[1:27:14] and declared
[1:27:17] they got their own prefigured ideas of
[1:27:19] how it should be
[1:27:21] and they wouldn't let him be free to say
[1:27:24] whatever he wants to say for his glory
[1:27:26] and for his honor amen
[1:27:29] is he a stranger in this age that we are
[1:27:31] living in
[1:27:32] think about it
[1:27:34] what you are hearing for the glory of
[1:27:36] god amen

[1:27:43] them on the road to emmaus
[1:27:46] and again here
[1:27:48] he's a stranger to them standing on the
[1:27:50] shore
[1:27:52] the same one they walk with for three
[1:27:54] and a half years
[1:27:57] can you imagine hearing every sermon
[1:27:59] that he prays
[1:28:01] and still not recognizing who he was
[1:28:05] being a christian following this bible
[1:28:07] and following this message
[1:28:10] following
[1:28:11] all your years and still not recognize
[1:28:14] who he is
[1:28:15] praise god hallelujah amen what are you

[1:32:37] but but we're not here for that we're
[1:32:40] here to give god glory
[1:32:42] we're here to praise god we are the
[1:32:44] given of glory and praise and honor
[1:32:46] that's due to his glorious name
[1:32:50] heavens and earth are praising you

[1:32:56] lord lord of god
[1:33:00] revelation 1 here he stands in the midst
[1:33:03] of the seven churches in the sevenfold
[1:33:06] glory of the resurrected christ
[1:33:09] the shining power of god's power to
[1:33:12] transform
[1:33:13] moving across his entire being
[1:33:16] and there he is walking up and down
[1:33:18] among the churches amen we know the last
[1:33:22] church edge here but you think he's
[1:33:23] still walking
[1:33:25] you think he's still moving you still
[1:33:27] think he's here he is here
[1:33:30] thank god he is here he's still with us
[1:33:33] he is still walking the line with the
[1:33:35] word of god
[1:33:36] hallelujah
[1:33:38] amen and he's coming up the mountain
[1:33:41] amen we're on the donkey and coming in
[1:33:44] and you know what the question was
[1:33:46] brother branham preached on this and
[1:33:47] many other preachers who is this
[1:33:51] a stranger again
[1:33:54] they don't even know the word
[1:33:56] they don't even recognize the word
[1:33:59] that was sent to their day
[1:34:01] because the word was in the form
[1:34:05] of a man
[1:34:07] and the man's name happened to be jesus
[1:34:10] christ
[1:34:11] now he's come back
[1:34:13] in
[1:34:14] the word form
[1:34:17] and they still don't recognize him
[1:34:20] because they're looking for the man that
[1:34:21] was back there
[1:34:23] they're tied into that history and
[1:34:25] looking back to that man here so when he
[1:34:28] changes his form or as the greek says
[1:34:30] and morphe and he comes back now but in
[1:34:34] word form
[1:34:36] they don't recognize him in the word
[1:34:37] form
[1:34:38] they don't see him that's the same god
[1:34:41] moving
[1:34:42] amen
[1:34:43] we come through the son of god ages
[1:34:46] amen
[1:34:48] moving in the prophets moving in the
[1:34:49] patriarchs amen then we come to the son
[1:34:52] of man age
[1:34:55] when he comes in the form of the son of
[1:34:57] man
[1:34:58] manifested manifesting the fullness of
[1:35:01] the word of god
[1:35:03] and then he says you know i've got to go
[1:35:05] away so that the comforter can come so
[1:35:08] he changes the form again from son of
[1:35:11] man and goes back to being son of god
[1:35:14] and then here the son of god holy ghost
[1:35:17] ages come upon the people in the baptism
[1:35:20] the holy ghost the power of god and the
[1:35:22] spirit of the living god but it's
[1:35:24] changing again back to son of man again
[1:35:28] because he promised it in the word of
[1:35:30] god that as it was in the days of noah
[1:35:33] as it was in the days of lot so shall it
[1:35:36] be when the son of man is being revealed
[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:46] son of god son of man son of god son of
[1:35:49] man then he goes back to being son of
[1:35:52] david why because that's the word going
[1:35:55] back to the jews
[1:35:56] but son of man because that's the word
[1:35:59] coming to the greeks and the gentiles
[1:36:02] who say sirs we would see jesus the same
[1:36:05] word but he just keeps changing just
[1:36:07] like his father's son holy ghost but not
[1:36:09] three gods one god
[1:36:12] amen hallelujah just god moving god
[1:36:16] making himself known by his uh
[1:36:18] manifestation of his great titles of his
[1:36:21] person and his entire being amen
[1:36:24] hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah
[1:36:28] amen
[1:36:30] unrecognized presence of god working and
[1:36:33] moving in his word hallelujah i thank
[1:36:37] god he's the same yesterday today and
[1:36:41] forever you know in the bible jesus one
[1:36:43] day said
[1:36:45] hallelujah
[1:36:47] amen one day you'll see the son of man
[1:36:49] ascending up from where he come from
[1:36:54] and they said what's he talking about we
[1:36:57] know he come from nazareth
[1:36:59] so what's he talking about going back
[1:37:01] where he come from
[1:37:03] amen and the bible says and that was a
[1:37:06] hard saying
[1:37:07] john chapter 6 and they walked away and
[1:37:10] walked no more with him
[1:37:13] think about it they said we can't see
[1:37:15] this
[1:37:16] now he's carrying things a little too
[1:37:18] far eat my flesh and drink my blood and
[1:37:21] the bible said but they did not
[1:37:23] understand that he was speaking
[1:37:26] not of his actual bodies not encouraging
[1:37:28] them to become cannibals
[1:37:30] but he was speaking about you know the
[1:37:32] bread the wine you know the word the
[1:37:35] spirit that we are partaking of
[1:37:37] in this day and this time and they
[1:37:40] walked away
[1:37:41] and he didn't even bother to explain
[1:37:45] oh if jesus really loved them he would
[1:37:48] explain to them
[1:37:50] no
[1:37:51] he didn't explain because the whole
[1:37:53] thing is by election amen
[1:37:55] it's by election not
[1:37:57] not persuasion amen it's not begging you
[1:38:00] to love him or begging you to love the
[1:38:03] word no sir oh my i tell you so here it
[1:38:07] is listen i quote here today we have a

[1:38:41] nobody else nothing else they don't want
[1:38:44] nothing they just love him and want to
[1:38:47] serve him amen
[1:38:49] jesus turned to his disciples the ones
[1:38:51] that remained with him and i'm quoting
[1:38:54] and says will you also go
[1:38:57] do you want to go to
[1:39:00] and he said i chose 12 for you and one
[1:39:04] of you is a devil

[1:39:32] rejoicing he said don't rejoice at that
[1:39:35] that the devils are made are subject to

[1:40:05] not wondering if our names are written
[1:40:08] there we are certain of god
[1:40:11] we recognize that our name is on the
[1:40:14] book hallelujah
[1:40:16] and it was not now put on the book
[1:40:18] yesterday when i repented the altar
[1:40:22] but my name was on the book before the
[1:40:24] foundation of the world
[1:40:27] i only now recognize it
[1:40:30] but it was already there
[1:40:33] because god is eternal
[1:40:37] and you don't now get eternal life

[1:40:59] this certain day that you are whoa
[1:41:01] no the person had to have it but maybe
[1:41:04] they weren't conscious of having it
[1:41:07] until they woke up to recognize they had
[1:41:10] it
[1:41:10] amen which is why we use the term
[1:41:12] revelation they woke up to recognize
[1:41:15] that they have it amen and now they know
[1:41:18] they are born again
[1:41:22] why because you were born somewhere else
[1:41:24] already so now you are born again
[1:41:28] praise god by the grace of god
[1:41:30] hallelujah born not to the will of man
[1:41:33] not of the persuasions of man not the
[1:41:36] blood of man but by the will of god the

[1:42:01] now what's the fountain of eternal life
[1:42:04] amen you are the identified fountain of
[1:42:08] life amen
[1:42:09] you see
[1:42:10] judas had walked the same time with them
[1:42:14] and he walked right with him but he
[1:42:17] couldn't see it
[1:42:19] he couldn't see it
[1:42:21] but the real ordained of god the real
[1:42:24] genes of god
[1:42:26] the real soul of god that was in god
[1:42:31] before the foundation of the world that
[1:42:33] is in you that's really got the spirit
[1:42:36] of god in you tonight you were here in
[1:42:39] christ before he was even the fullness
[1:42:43] of the word you were in him he was the
[1:42:46] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:42:50] a prophet here a patriarch there another
[1:42:52] prophet here another patriarch there oh
[1:42:54] my but when he came what was he
[1:42:57] you me every one of us that's a part of
[1:43:00] god he was the fullness
[1:43:04] of the godhead
[1:43:06] expressed
[1:43:07] bodily
[1:43:09] oh praise god
[1:43:10] and you were a part of that
[1:43:13] amen
[1:43:14] reconciling
[1:43:16] the world
[1:43:17] to himself
[1:43:19] is that right
[1:43:20] praise god it's not jesus just bringing
[1:43:23] the people to god but he was reconciling
[1:43:26] the world to himself
[1:43:27] but he was because he was god
[1:43:31] in another manifestation of himself or
[1:43:34] office of himself amen
[1:43:36] a gene you were a word of god an
[1:43:39] attribute of god from before the
[1:43:42] foundation of the world
[1:43:43] then you walk with him here on the earth
[1:43:46] and you talk with him there on the earth
[1:43:48] you suffered with him died with him at
[1:43:50] calvary rose with him and in him and now
[1:43:53] you're sitting in heavenly places
[1:43:56] in christ hallelujah
[1:43:58] how do you see it in heavenly places
[1:44:00] because with the revelation you have
[1:44:02] come to our rest
[1:44:04] is that right
[1:44:05] you sat down
[1:44:07] you seated
[1:44:08] because you caught the fullness
[1:44:11] of the word of god making itself plain
[1:44:13] and clear and known to you glory to god
[1:44:17] hallelujah i'm so glad that he is my
[1:44:20] lord and he is the same yesterday today
[1:44:24] forever let me give you a couple of
[1:44:25] scriptures here in the very luke 24 45
[1:44:29] in emmaus
[1:44:31] amen after he now in his resurrected
[1:44:35] form
[1:44:36] began to explain and open the scriptures
[1:44:39] to them the bible says
[1:44:42] then
[1:44:43] opened he their understanding
[1:44:48] that they may
[1:44:50] understand the scriptures
[1:44:53] so they were walking with him with their
[1:44:54] white eyes wide open all those years
[1:44:57] seeing him
[1:44:59] and yet the bible says here then
[1:45:03] only then did he open up their
[1:45:05] understanding
[1:45:08] that they
[1:45:09] may begin to understand the scriptures
[1:45:13] so my aim and point that i've made and
[1:45:17] i'm making today
[1:45:19] is that you could have followed this
[1:45:20] word for
[1:45:22] that doesn't matter as we say
[1:45:24] in uh
[1:45:26] caribbean parlance
[1:45:29] you could have followed this word for
[1:45:31] donkey years
[1:45:34] and still not
[1:45:36] understand
[1:45:38] understand it in your head understand it
[1:45:41] by intellect not that you don't have
[1:45:43] reasoning but by revelation
[1:45:46] the resurrected christ
[1:45:48] making
[1:45:49] himself known
[1:45:51] to his own oh praise god hallelujah
[1:45:54] aren't you glad
[1:45:56] that jesus has a table for spread
[1:45:59] where the saints of god are fed can the
[1:46:01] worship leader song leader come right
[1:46:03] now glory be to god hallelujah of course
[1:46:06] there's more i can continue to say but i
[1:46:08] believe that you uh we are in the middle
[1:46:11] of the
[1:46:12] manifestation of the resurrection to the
[1:46:15] people
[1:46:16] of this day
[1:46:18] let me repeat
[1:46:20] manifestation
[1:46:22] of the resurrection
[1:46:24] to the people of this day
[1:46:27] by revelation
[1:46:29] is that right
[1:46:30] praise the lord may the great holy
[1:46:33] spirit
[1:46:34] grant to you
[1:46:35] that we may continue to walk in to this
[1:46:39] marvelous season and time
[1:46:42] as we go into the season of christmas
[1:46:47] i will continue of course to preach the
[1:46:49] word of god and when we get to uh close
[1:46:52] to that time then i will touch on a
[1:46:55] christmas message
[1:46:57] and speak on that
[1:46:59] and trust that the lord will speak to
[1:47:01] your heart and my heart also
[1:47:04] at the end of the year
[1:47:06] we will have our usually usual watch
[1:47:09] night service

[1:47:14] then we shall have the lord's supper we

[1:47:19] but we shall have the lord's supper in
[1:47:22] that watch night service praise the lord
