November and we arrived in Ghana 23rd of November brother Daniel Pastor Daniel who came here one time and preached Pickers from the airport and took us to his house that even was a service so we were very very tired as some of you that from Africa you know from here to Ghana is in in the plane is 16 hours non-stop from here to Cairo is 10 hours then from Cairo to Ghana is six hours I'm not talking about Transit so when you reach you are really really tired but nevertheless service is important to me than anything because I want to hear the voice of God and in the evening while we were there we went me and Paul went to the service and they were doing uh that week it happened that they have ministers coming to minister in brother Daniel's church and they have their title like take on your inheritance if you have it as the minister if you have any uh uh topic like you could bring it but the the church team was take your inheritance so I said now two ministers minister Wednesday I think Thursday then I left with Paul we went to the village where I was born to see the family because my wife brother was so sick with kidney and the kidney was failing they have we have done everything we supposed to do and I need to talk to him before he goes so that was on my heart and God made a way I spoke to him about the word he has heard the word even baptized and the family were trying to push press him or you need to see this you need to see that he says no I don't need to see anything and we know that it was God that was doing that with him so when I went and speak the word with him my heart was at peace I believe his heart too was at peace God sent me there to him because it was time for him to go and we left the we slept in the hotel me and Paul Sunday morning because I have a vehicle from a friend Pastor Samuel and I know the rich man in Ghana he gave me SUV to drive it to take it around wherever I'm going and I'm driving it so I called Pastor Michael whom brother Desmond was there and he delivered brother they says your ministry was fantastic everybody was rejoicing while I was there about the minister the word that you brought so they told me that Sunday I have to come and Minister for them so I was driving two hours to that place and we are almost close to the area but some part of the road was rough and why we were driving I saw a hole it's a going through that place was a farm area so I tried to dodge the whole not knowing there was a big hole on the other side so the car just went in boom on the whole and I'm I'm the one that gonna preach they are waiting for me to come and preach here we are me Paul and one young beautiful girl I call her B he we are in the ditch so I get out and I told Paul and the girl can you get out he says okay so I get out quickly leave them from the car rush to go to the church they were singing as we were singing in the church and why I was going there every man in the church were coming to help us to get a car away so the pastor was still leading the song and the ladies were in the church so they came around me and they wanted to help me to take the car right away I said wait a minute leave the car every one of you leave the car we're going to service leave the car there don't worry about a car we're going to service don't worry about T4 whoever don't worry so we went to the service and what God placed on my heart I brought it and it was fantastic the people were shouting rejoicing the church the people may be very close like this this place not the big size but the people were parked in and the Holy Spirit begin to move they begin to shout they begin to praise God God pour out his Blessing the brother brother Michael is doing fantastic job brother this morning was there he's building a church probably when they finish the size will be like our our church the sanctuary will be like our Sanctuary he has flow the the bottom and and now they're gonna wire the the lights the wiring of the light and they will bear the church on top it says he was showing me how when I got a preacher the ministers come where they're gonna sleep well that and all this place was Bush was through me and Pastor Simon this man was in denomination that came up and took this message Hallelujah from scratch Good Neighbor his true good neighbor they got all of the message so you are part of that Ministry your money that you your type that you paying your offering that you paying did that and it's now a full Church my son is sitting there Desmond is sitting here Philip is sitting here sister Palmer has been there Danny sanchi has been the pastor Simon has been there and I believe times goes on who knows what the Lord may send some of you Brothers to go see for yourself because God is moving mindly over there and I'm not joking he's serious and God was telling them I want to bless some of you I I don't want you to stay in the rug I want some of you to take my word I am God I can do all things but if you hold me tight I cannot if you don't allowed me to do it and you lean to your intellectual I cannot do that allowed me free me so that I can move through your life and change the life oh the Holy Spirit was my brothers and sisters moving mightily so after the service we came with all the young men and within I would say seven or ten minutes we were able to pull the car guess what the car the car that was in able when it was in the the hole wasn't able to start the key even to remove the key we were able to remove the the boys were able to remove the key start the car with Pickers and things you know Africa some of you from Africa they dig and get a car and the car was moving nothing scratched or nothing happened the car only the sun it was dirty we have to wash it and I was able to drive the car up and down but it was V8 5.8 engine so the gas was too much for me so I have to turn it to the rich man but one thing I want to say brothers and sisters we have the word we are the light of the world at this present hour if you don't know know it because Jesus has poured his Spirit upon you and don't be afraid whether Rich poor when you meet them tell them God place in your heart to speak speak to them this rich man I'm telling you perhaps someone know him he's very rich in Ghana move with presidents move with Kings have security one time I went he was sitting there every time in my heart I wanted to speak the word with him but always there's people around him and I I was thinking what should I do no in my heart something was saying speak to this man speak the word to this man so I just pour my heart to him like that and speak the word guess what not too long the man had kidney problems now when I went they have caught his foot three of his food diabetes he just came from hospital the man whom he even you could not talk to him about Christ now when I was there with Paul sitting down there the man was preaching to us about Christ now he's talking more he says I don't care nothing means nothing to me only Jesus means something to me thank you it brought even tears I wept till the man even was telling me why are you crying like that I said you brother you don't know you don't know because God I'm seeing Christ doing something in that man's life because he told me he says even I'm building a church for some church I'm gonna bury I'm gonna do this and I'm sitting down there and I'm says Lord now I see what you are doing I recognize if I couldn't share the world with that man right even though look at how high this man is he have used to have hundred houses and hotels in my country the capital the man is every crook his hand is inside yes I'll tell you the truth every crook is if he's here he will be top so-called Mafia right that's the way he was he is but God has put him on the bed now he he's doing business but he's always at home one place and I told him I says yeah you God gonna beat everything out of you and get everything he wants and I've already told him I said you remember John lutein the one the guy that sing Amazing Grace do you remember if you don't know go search it God use a bed to bring him to his knees and he came and sung one of the Beautiful song the world has ever seen why because people like that it takes God himself to do that and I told him that I came we spent two weeks so the second week Friday going the second week brother Daniel asked me to speak on Sunday that was their last sermon and the Lord placed on my heart he asked me what title do you have I says brother you are you brother brother you have the title on your team already I won't change it the title is take your inheritance so the Lord placed on my heart to speak on about take John 8 read John Saint John chapter 8 I took I talk about Mary Martin and talking about who they are talking about David how David committed adultery but he was a man after God God's Own Heart talking about uh Jose who preach as a prophet the Lord told him to marry a prostitute after he preached finish the man is going to a prostitute to get his wife out and just imagine how if he is your pastor what would you think the man has preached a sermon delivered a wonderful sermon and after the service the man is going to a prostitute to pick up his uh prostitution area to pick up his wife and you see him as a Believer what would you say and I was preaching around that around through the message our brothers from the pastor to the deacons has brought and I put it together the Lord let me put it together and I brought it and the Holy Spirit begin to move God on the back this side I see people shouting oh and these people believers they are not literate like me they are graduates they shouting and praising God like that even oh mine and God begin to move and showing them get away from the legalistics get away from your own man-made ideas you think you gonna explain God by using the letter with your own brains I am God I am God I interpret my own word what I need from you is your heart give me thy heart and when I wanted to speak I will speak when I wanted to correct I will call it you don't have to interpret the word I will interpret the word all I need is you surrendering to me yes God begin to move in that round cut it cut all those loose and legalistics and things that are hidden in the message and the Lord begin to speak how so many preachers has come in the message with their five Sons because they are so educated they can call the prophet message in and out put it together but the holy spirit is not there and this our God is saying whom I have predestinated it doesn't matter whether he can read or can read I the Lord will do the job I the Lord will let you know that I'm in that skin I the Lord will speak and perform it so he to my word I will make it play it's not you gonna do it it's not the intellectuals gonna do it all the intellectual dance they cannot do it but I the Lord I have spoken I will perform my way oh my the Holy Spirit begin to move says look Mary Magdalene yes the religious leaders caught aired at their very heart committing adulterers but don't you know those people that caught her they were demons they were demonic coming after the sister bombarding the sister right but God seed was hidden there I said look at you some of you yourself look back where you came from who brought you out and washed you that you are sitting here you think your intellectual or your education your money your propriety or whatever or some something that you just imagine is I the Lord I think you out you are like a pig in my hands and I clean you up so when you see people going on the street would rather prostitute don't condemn them going down there be like a salt and go and protect the fish because I have cleaning up oh my God's spirit even one pint I said to myself even I want to cut off I said no maybe I'm I'm talking to my I feel the Holy Spirit by the time they says no no no no no God have more for us today don't even think you're gonna stop pull out they were saying proud let God come out don't hold back you you even The Interpreter brother will say brother let me tell you you don't realize what you are speaking the preacher even told me he says brother brother Daniel he says next time you come I'm not going to let you preach for me alone I'm taking you to some place to message church so that you could preach this because your Ministries unique yeah they were telling me and I'm looking myself I'm nothing I am nothing brothers and sisters but you know what the pastor God give it to us let me tell you God has given us one of the best in the message a preacher in the message let me tell you then I realized after I finish even all the people coming to me oh Pastor coffee this that the brother was holding food on my door he carried the the brother Daniel like it's like NGO you know what's NGO you that come from Africa right you have a big position and here is this man carrying a food to my door he's serving me his wife serving me they don't let me go I'm angry and I said I look at myself I say who am I I am nothing I it's it shocked me even when I finish they asked me things I speak I can't even interpret it because you know what me when I get in behind the pope the thing just come letting God just come because I don't have no reason no idea what I'm gonna say he will just give me the scripture God is my witness he just give me the scripture and he has told me the Lord has told me says Coffee every time I warn you in the puppet it doesn't matter where you stand I will come I the Lord thy God will come have no fear of man I will back you up because I ordain you not a man or church gonna ordain you I the Lord thy God will take you I have chose you I'll call my seed that I have in you before the foundations of this world so I am relying on him doesn't matter who or how or what you think or how even I feel or what you feel or listen salvation is an individual God chose me alone and I will stand before him alone so when he tell me something I have to obey regardless what I have seen God take me to some time girls that are prostitutes you said yes God take me to prostitute Place some of them wanted to commit suicide and the Lord let me speak to them some of them has gone to University become a business lady God is my witness one girl called me he says you told me you have two sons can you give me one to marry he said yes I'm not lying and he says because God I see God in your life the way God has used you let me tell you this message is time we break the loose let God have his way not hypocrisy we we know the cause so much but when it comes to reality how God moved sometimes we forget we don't even know it because you know why too much education too much scientific and knowledge and we think we know everything we don't know nothing until he does I don't know nothing until God does and I've seen him move I've seen him let me tell you even when I was in Ghana all those Brothers coming to me said brother the way you talking and the way God is using you we it's like they never see something like that they never see something like that and I says Brothers let me tell you it's all by his grace it's all by his grace and obedient when God gave you a servant you have to obey go under what he's saying and humble your heart then God will lift you up I'm not lying to you me I don't know nothing but God now God is saying let me tell you that brother coffee you see here that don't know nothing because you have a humble heart I the Lord will lift him up I won't use him and for you to know that it's not brother coffee because brother coffee don't know nothing listen I know what God can do I have seen

this place amen have confidence no matter what take the word in the world when the Lord take you to speak to people the reaction that coming from them will make you cry like a baby you will know set me me me I am nothing who am I when people come back and tell me I tell them plainly I says you don't know who you're talking to Look Away to Jesus it is Jesus that has done it I cannot do it but you use my lips he used my heart and speak to you whatever he has told you go and do it whatever the Lord has told you go and do it people were asking me one brother things that he has gone through sitting with me he says you every preach You Preach expose everything he says my God it's like people are coming from jail they are in the message they were in the message but they are coming out from that message to step up to take their inheritance their inheritance is who Christ Christ the lord but we who are here God has opened our eye through the faithful Ministry we know a lot and sometimes we become lazy we don't want to even eat the way we don't want to come to the house of God come come eat it eat it be like a cow because God is up to something big God will never fail you this message when you eat it is sweeter in your mouth but better in your belly so a lot of people don't want the beta they want to run away from the bearer let me tell you it's not easy there's not anybody you see them preaching this gospel that's coming out the word coming out powerful they pay price high price yes high price if you compare that high price you can never win the reward we just saw the soccer game right you saw the soccer game some people my own country Ghana they want to just go and and play like they play at the back oh they just call them and push them out right just like some of the people that when they come in Christ they won't get serious they won't pour their heart they won't do things that will support the ministry they will not do things that will benefit the kingdom of God and prosper their own life God is telling us the hour has come you that are here I have trained you Pastor Simon has poor all his heart what God give it to him I believe he has pour it because when I was in Ghana I saw myself let me tell you you think brother coffee is so small don't know nothing but when I speak and the people who are preachers coming to me so brother you have a unique Ministry and I'm looking myself me the people who has finished University they know their message in and out they let them out I can't even when they are speaking I can't even speak I have to shut my mouth because otherwise they'll put me to sleep but let me tell you it's not the letter that's why the Bible says the letter kill it but the spirit gave life is the life that is within the letter when you have that life that life will project then the Letter People they know that my God God is in this brother God is in this system God is in this in his King then they got shocked they get because they sin they can't deny it people listen when I didn't create nobody you didn't create nobody God created them so in their heart God will make let them know that is him let me tell you letters trust God because he's moving he's moving this good neighbor Ministry he has buried not even Pastor someone Betty do you know that it's not Pastor Simon that did it is God that place in him to do what he did otherwise he himself cannot do it he can do it it's God you Chuck in the Bible the Lord says I will build my church and against of us shall not Prevail against it is woman will be the church the Lord will bury it but he uses man the Lord uses man right that's why the Lord he has ordained Pastor Simon at the age of 12 he goes to him reveal himself to him because he have the mission that you want him to accomplish so he he began to identify himself in that King say his son this is what I brought you for this is what I'm going to use you for and begin to break him breaking a little bit breaking here breaking here until the evidence is you and me the evidence is you and me amen and if we look into our life me since I was seven years sitting in my grandmother house in front I saw a plane passing through night Darkness I never see plane on the ground and the Lord spoke to me at the age of seven he spoke to me in African jungle he said you see this plane when you grow you'll be sitting and going and coming sometime I'm sleeping I'm so depressed a voice will wake me up in African jungle before I came to contact the message God was speaking to me otherwise I supposed to die you the same way because you've been ordained to be here you're being ordained to be under that Ministry because now I know I am the light of the world you are the light of the world because Christ is in you Christ is the light of the world all that was in God important to Christ all that was in Christ according to who the bride and who is the bride you and I for your purpose you're sitting here every day your purpose is you are the light of the world shine that light let that light shine so that somebody can get hold of that light and transform him or her wherever you go let me tell you before my eye if the Lord tally and my eyes should close down and go in the grave absent from this body I'm present with the Lord one thing I want to live is no Riches of the world it's not big this that which is good one thing I want to live is to let my life Touch Somebody a little bit that the lord gave it to me I want it whether it's Canada here whether it's United States whether it's Africa whether it's Europe wherever the Lord will lead me I want my life to touch somebody I'm not gonna put that light in the in the grave or say oh I die so that light gonna die no brother Brown died that light didn't die one bit that light is here if that light die with brother Abraham you and I will be sitting here God used a man after that man died that Holy Spirit move up and the Holy Spirit is within you and me have confidence in yourself yes have confidence that you are the light of the world this is the hour when this message when parabram used to say I'm going but there's some young men that Gonna Come that young man when he was talking he was speaking in prophecies but now it's realities it's realities because we are here if you if you have an ear to hear and I to see you will know what the holy spirit is accomplishing what the holy spirit is doing he's moving this is the hour when men sisters brothers their light will shine and being the last one in from north south east west God will shake everything even within the message he's shaking up he's checking on those that have to be shaken he's checking those that have to be shaken because we women beings sometimes we want to look oh how this brother is great how this brother is not great how this is giants in the message there's no Giant in the message yes sir God is the one that is just God is the one that is big God is the one that will not talk the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he said look even Moses look at how naturally how that man was great how he was educated but God most of all the time those type of people when God want to use them you know what God do put them in backside of the desert and let him be bust when God is doing that he's taking all the intellectuals away that man his credibility will be gone nobody will respect him no more that's why he told Isaiah go sleep on the street cut your your back bottom let him see because Isaiah was a very intellectual man very Leonard man God want him before he can really use him you have to bring him to this grace people who don't owe that man because of book he has become dummy he is mad now look he's sleeping outside with his bum nobody will respect that that was the time God says I want to get my glory from him because you know why God says wash Isaiah go and tell the people the way they saw you is not you Isaiah is how they look that's how filthy they are Moses 40 years in wilderness looking after sheep you think looking after sheep is easy go to the farm even today and mingle yourself around ships all your finger if you come here everybody will be say oh this guy smell this guy stink this guy is stink nobody wants that right in public that time God says okay I get what I want from you Moses now I'm sending you down to Egypt go and bring my people out Moses said Lord I can't talk because you know why no respect he's think like a sheep all his fingernails the Sheep toilet is smelling on his skin so Moses he was a general you don't want to go because when he go he has to the people he will lose his credibility and that's what sometimes the Lord does with us he does with the even the educated people so that he could get the glory out of them when it comes like that God is ready to move God when it comes like that he's ready to move so many people they think but Abraham came the message is there playing they forget what the Bible says it says the letter Kelly When brother Abraham preached it has become letter so they think they can take that and interpret it but God they say no we that are here look what is revealing to us he's saying to us it's not your education it's not your ability what you have done what you know you think is I the Lord that does the work and all I'm asking you give me thy heart if you give me the heart I will do it I will perform it the one that I wanted to correct him or her I would do it if I want you to use your mouth to God do it you will even recognize how filthy I took you from the ditch I took you from the mod so you are not going to condemn the brother or the sister or even The Sinner on the street because you think like that either not clean you up so you you you talking to the person you're even feeling sympathy for them your heart is burning out for them you showing Grace you're showing grace Amazing Grace to them because Grace will bring the person to Christ without you showing Grace legalistics has gone in the message for so long and God doesn't like that he want us to show Grace Grace will let you love one another Grace will let you have patience Grace will let you know that God has done so much for you and God is the one that is doing it not you that's the way I see myself I see myself right now that if it wasn't his grace where would I be where would I be you if it wasn't God grace where would you be God was showing all this when I was in Ghana to the people the Believers they says look top your legalistics stop it get into Grace get into Grace because my grace will bring my children to me my grace that I have shown to you go out and show Grace I have mercy upon you you now go and pass that Mercy to the people out there and those ones that are mine will come because when you show Grace the grace I show to you they will come the one that are mine I will bring them I will bring them not you you know this you know this coaching this coating that sometimes we use the same Bible or brother Abraham word and slap one another or be the people one another because we know we think we know we don't know nothing I don't know nothing now I want to be obedient to him when he asked me coffee speak I will speak because you can't speak I'll hold my mouth coffee sleep I'll sleep coffee you make mistake Lord I wanted to do your will your perfect will not my Will O Lord but thy will be done amen thank you Mary mothering that's what the Lord showed to her Grace the Lord offered Mary Mother in Grace and when that Grace come did you saw Mary Mandarin became a prostitute again when that Grace was showing to the woman otherwise did you saw that woman have five men sleeping with them again that's what the Lord is saying to us I have given you Grace some of you were drug addict some of you were alcoholic some of you were cheaters Liars murderers criminals I have brought you to me I the Lord has brought you I embrace you and welcome you to me so have mercy on the others have mercy is Grace that is taking us home his grace alone will never fail us his grace what he has started in you he will finish it it's not you gonna finish it is no man gonna finish it but it's him that will finish it trust in the Lord and all things are possible unto you his grace whatever he says he will do with you allowed him when he's taking you through Darkness you say yes Lord when he's even taking you to grave say yes Lord yes Lord because you're gonna come out absent from this body present with the Lord Christians doesn't die and Christians Is Not Afraid Christianity is reality the only reactor is Christianity I have come to realize that and because of that I always lift up my head and Look Away to Jesus so each and every one of you I encourage you today Look Away to Jesus when you look to him when you are sick look to him when there's no food in your table Look to Him when you are even your husband is fighting you look to him when your wife is fighting you look to him and says with Christ all things are possible to them that believe I believe I have spoken enough and I will read the scripture the same way I read in brother John Church brother Daniel church sorry Mary Magdalene was a woman a woman Jesus user for Grace to you and I because if it was in Grace Mary Mandarin supposed to die you could have died a dead that we wouldn't know but Jesus gave her grace and you and I a type of s the Lord has given you Grace because his grace is sufficient for you I will never leave you nor forsake you I will be with you to the end of

fulfill my way right here for you to know that I love you have confidence may the Lord bless each and every one of you okay as I read the word because we human beings if you don't read the word they're gonna say you didn't read the scripture the man has preached with no scripture but the word will cap it as our pastor I see him sometimes do okay okay may we stand up Saint John chapter 8. as we read the word Jesus went into the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he come again into the temple and all the people come unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taking in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they said unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very Act now Moses in the law commanded us that sex should be stoned but what says Thou you see but what says now why are they saying that they attempting Jesus they want him to go contrary to his word but they failed to recognize that he was the way and you are the world today when the devil come to you he don't recognize that he's standing in front of the word that you has made flesh the bride is the word for the day so he can never concise because he could never conquer our master they said unto him Master this woman was taking adulteress in the very act Moses in the law commanded us that said should be stoned but what says Thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus stood down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he had he had them not so one day continued asking him he lift up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him face cast a stone at her what he's saying taught us unbelief of God way and they don't have the word so they are sinners the Pharisees back there were sinners may the Lord add his Blessing please sit down as I close gracious Eternal Father Lord Jesus Lord I have poured my heart you know I am nothing but father I am the least in the kingdom of God Lord I have spoken what you place it in my heart while I was in Ghana and Lord I've come share with my brothers and sisters let it be a blessing unto them as I close Lord
