[3:11] [music] Praise the Lord.
[3:14] Hallelujah.
[3:15] Thank God that he has given another
[3:18] [music] day to be in his house. We're
[3:21] going to read out our scripture this
[3:23] morning. Psalm 91.
[3:27] He that dwelleth in the secret place of
[3:29] the most high shall abide under the
[3:31] shadow of the Almighty. I will say of
[3:35] the Lord, he is my refuge and my
[3:37] fortress. My God, in him will I [music]
[3:42] trust.
[3:43] Surely he shall deliver thee from the
[3:45] snare of the flower, and from the
[3:48] noiseome [music]
[3:49] pestilence.
[3:51] He shall cover thee with his fies,
[3:55] and under his wing shall thou trust. His
[3:59] truth shall [music] be thy shield and
[4:02] barkling.
[4:04] Thou shall not be [music] afraid for the
[4:06] Torah by night, nor for the arrow that
[4:11] Friday by day. That means you [music]
[4:14] are protected all the time.
[4:17] Thou shall not be afraid for the terror
[4:20] by night, [music] nor the arrow flight
[4:23] by day, nor the pestilence [music]
[4:25] that walketh in darkness. Hallelujah.
[4:29] nor for the destruction that waitth
[4:33] [music] at new day. My God, thank you.
[4:37] The thousand a thousand shall fall at
[4:40] thy [music] side
[4:42] and 10,000 at thy right hand,
[4:47] but it shall not come near thee.
[4:51] Hallelujah.
[4:53] Amen.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:55] &gt;&gt; Only with thy eye shall see. Be thou
[4:59] behold. Oh, sorry. Only with thy eye
[5:03] shall thou behold and see the reward of
[5:08] the wicked
[5:09] because thou had made the Lord which is
[5:12] my refuge, even the Most High thy
[5:15] habitation. Hallelujah.
[5:19] There shall no evil before thee, neither
[5:22] [music] shall any blood come near thy
[5:25] dwelling. My [music] God. Thank you,
[5:28] Lord. We are the special people.
[5:31] Hallelujah. Aren't you happy this
[5:33] morning? Oh my, I feel like jumping when
[5:36] I read the word of God. For he shall
[5:39] give his angels charge over thee to keep
[5:42] thee in all thy ways.
[5:47] [music] They shall bear thee up in their
[5:49] hand, lest thou dash thy foot against
[5:52] the stone. Thou shalt tread upon the
[5:54] lion and other the young lion and the
[5:57] dragon shall thou trample under the feet
[6:00] because [music] he has set his love upon
[6:04] me.
[6:06] Therefore will [singing] I deliver him.
[6:09] I [music] will set him on high because
[6:12] he had known my name. Do you know the
[6:16] name of the Lord? Yes. He [music] shall
[6:19] call upon me and I will answer him. I
[6:22] will be with him in trouble.
[6:26] I will deliver him and honor [music]
[6:28] him. With long life would I certify him
[6:32] and show him my [music] salvation.
[6:36] Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord a hand.
[6:39] Hallelujah.
[6:40] Amen.

[29:46] giver and bless this offering in your
[29:48] wonderful name Jesus. [music]

[30:05] All [music] the way.
[30:09] We're going all the way.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:12] &gt;&gt; We're [singing] going all the way.
[30:22] [music]
[30:24] You know, they're just back from
[30:25] Belgium. And in Belgium, they were in a
[30:28] youth camp and uh they came [music] back
[30:31] I think Monday. Our house has been
[30:32] blessed all week.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; So,
[30:37] something good happened.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[30:56] [music]
[31:01] [music]
[31:04] &gt;&gt; I thought [singing] no
[31:06] one
[31:08] would surely believe
[31:11] me.
[31:13] [music] I thought I
[31:15] could be
[31:17] what I wanted
[31:20] to be.
[31:22] [music] I thought I
[31:24] could
[31:27] life [singing] sinking. [music]
[31:31] But I can't even [music] walk without
[31:36] you holding [singing]
[31:38] my hand. [music]
[31:43] I can't [music] even
[31:45] walk without you holding [music] my
[31:50] hand.
[31:52] The mountains [singing]
[31:54] too high
[31:56] and the valleys [music]
[31:59] too high.
[32:02] Down on my knees,
[32:05] that's where [music] I've learned to
[32:08] stand.
[32:10] Cuz I [music] can't even walk without
[32:15] you holding [music]
[32:17] my hand. [singing]
[32:22] I thought I [singing]
[32:24] could make
[32:26] a lot of my own.
[32:30] I thought I
[32:33] can make it [music]
[32:35] all day long.
[32:39] I thought [music] of
[32:42] myself
[32:43] as a mighty [music]
[32:46] wind,
[32:48] but I can't even walk without [music]
[32:53] you holding my hand. [singing]
[32:59] I can't even walk [music]
[33:03] without you holding [singing] my hand.
[33:08] The mountains [music]
[33:11] to high
[33:13] and the valley
[33:16] [music]
[33:18] down on my knees. [music]
[33:22] That's where I want to say.
[33:26] Lord, I can't [music] even
[33:29] walk without you.
[33:33] [music]
[33:37] So let the stars reach high. The dark
[33:43] [music]
[33:44] clouds rise.
[33:46] They won't wor
[33:52] [music]
[33:54] within the arms of God.
[33:58] [music and singing]
[34:01] He walks with me [singing]
[34:05] and all of her can
[34:12] [music]
[34:13] for
[34:18] the arms of [music and singing]
[34:24] let the star
[34:28] the dark clouds
[34:30] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:32] &gt;&gt; They will worry [singing] me for
[34:38] safe within [music] the arms of God.
[34:45] He walks with me
[34:49] [music]
[34:50] and all of earth shall fall.
[34:57] for a [music] sheltered
[35:01] in the arms of God.
[35:07] For I'm shering
[35:11] [music and singing]
[35:12] the arms of her.
[35:17] [music]
[35:23] Hallelujah.
[35:25] Thank you so many. Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And if
[35:30] you're not sheltered in his arms this
[35:32] morning, by the time you leave here,
[35:34] [music] you can be.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you ought to be. World
[35:39] is falling apart, friends. [music]
[35:43] Amen. But we're in a new age.
[35:47] The capstone age. [music]
[35:52] We're in a new age.
[36:00] We're in a new age.
[36:03] The Corn
[36:05] [music]
[36:14] [music]
[36:16] restoration of the world has come. The
[36:20] son [music] of man in me.
[36:23] The bride [singing] of Christ has become
[36:26] his wife. [music]

[37:47] again. Oh, we're in a new game.
[37:58] [music]
[38:04] &gt;&gt; [music]

[39:01] Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; So, um let's go to the word of God this
[39:05] morning. Um and then uh we'll uh see
[39:09] what the Lord has for us. Amen. Praise
[39:11] God. Our scripture is from Jude
[39:15] 1:es 14 to 15.
[39:18] And it says, "And Enoch also, the
[39:21] seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
[39:24] saying, behold, the Lord cometh with 10
[39:28] thousands of his saints."
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Father, we certainly
[39:35] appreciate, Lord, that your presence is
[39:38] in our midst this morning and that you
[39:40] are mindful of our needs. And that,
[39:42] Lord, as we assemble around your word
[39:44] this morning, Lord, uh it's it's it's
[39:48] vital to us, Father. It's our strength,
[39:51] Lord. It's our our food. Uh Lord, it's
[39:55] spiritual food in due season for the
[39:57] sons and daughters of God. Lord, we we
[40:00] assemble because we know that we uh are
[40:03] in your presence. You're going to speak
[40:05] to our needs. You're going to discern
[40:07] hearts and lives and situations, oh God.
[40:10] And Lord, we'll be able to leave here
[40:12] and say it was good to be in the
[40:14] presence of the Lord in the house of God
[40:17] to hear your voice and to allow your
[40:19] your uh healing go uh Lord come through
[40:23] the word of God and heal and deliver and
[40:25] set free the captives in the midst.
[40:28] Lord, may you take control, Father. Use
[40:30] this vessel. Anoint us for your service.
[40:33] Oh God, we submit and humble ourselves
[40:36] before you in the name of Jesus Christ
[40:39] and for your glory. Amen and amen. God
[40:42] bless you. May be seated.
[40:44] Glory to God. Are we ever in the
[40:46] capstone age?
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want to talk about
[40:50] today. Amen. We love the Lord and uh
[40:54] appreciate the time that we're living
[40:57] in. Amen. The scripture said that um he
[41:00] cometh, behold, the Lord cometh with 10
[41:03] thousands of his saints and they they
[41:05] have a prophecy within them.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; They have a revelation that burns within
[41:09] their hearts that they need to bring
[41:11] forth in this last day, in this age that
[41:14] we're living in. Amen. And you know when
[41:16] you look at the word cometh it it talks
[41:19] about um you know when you look at the
[41:21] definition in the Hebrew and the
[41:23] Strong's concordance it says to go to to
[41:25] to to bring out in a great variety of
[41:29] applications literally and figuratively
[41:32] direct and and proximate. In other
[41:35] words, the Lord has something uh
[41:38] deliberate. Amen. To go out, to come
[41:41] out, to exit, to go forth. Amen. And
[41:45] what's coming? 10 thousands of his
[41:47] saints. Who are his saints? The sons and
[41:50] daughters of God that are that are
[41:52] manifesting in this day and in this hour
[41:54] that have a revelation of what God is
[41:57] doing in this day and in this hour.
[41:59] Amen. And so, you know, we've been
[42:02] looking at the uh world events and we
[42:04] see what's going on. Um, we see how, you
[42:06] know, uh, we want to certainly keep
[42:08] Venezuela in our prayers, um, because we
[42:12] know that, uh, there's much change and,
[42:14] um, things that are happening there.
[42:16] But, you know, we can't help but um,
[42:18] notice the types, you know, and what is
[42:22] actually going on. Last week, we spoke
[42:24] about, you know, the the 10 virgins and
[42:26] the the wise and the foolish virgin and
[42:29] and how, you know, the the wise had the
[42:32] oil, but the foolish, they had no oil.
[42:35] So the foolish virgin, they're going
[42:37] after the oil, right? And here we can
[42:39] look at naturally and we can look into
[42:41] what's going on, you know, um, in the
[42:43] world and we can see that, you know,
[42:45] they're here here the US militarily
[42:49] going in and and taking control of
[42:52] Venezuela. And there's motives there.
[42:55] They don't realize it there. They think
[42:57] there's power in the oil. We know
[42:59] there's power in the oil, but it's the
[43:00] oil of the Holy Ghost. But they they
[43:03] they've got a they they've got a re it's
[43:04] all natural. They're all after the
[43:06] natural wealth and the natural power and
[43:09] missing where the real power is. Amen.
[43:12] Which is in the oil of the Holy Ghost.
[43:14] So the you know the wise virgin they
[43:16] have a revelation. They can see through
[43:18] all of this you know but Satan has his
[43:21] interpretation of the Holy Ghost right
[43:24] and you know and his his interpretation
[43:26] is that you know he wants to pervert
[43:29] God's interpretation. He wants to uh
[43:32] impersonate God's interpretation. He
[43:34] wants to have control over the oil
[43:37] thinking that he can have control over
[43:39] God, have you know have control over the
[43:42] word, control it and organize it through
[43:44] mystery Babylon and and and so forth.
[43:46] Amen. But the you know um we can see
[43:51] very clearly here what's actually going
[43:53] on. These world powers think that they
[43:55] can have control if they control the
[43:57] oil.
[44:00] They'll also come to realize that they
[44:02] are not in control
[44:05] because the word of God has made it
[44:07] clear. Amen. World powers are after the
[44:10] oil and they're doing it. And look at
[44:13] the way that it's being done. And you
[44:14] know, it's interesting because I was
[44:16] having some, you know, fellowship there
[44:18] with my partner Frank Balisimo and we
[44:20] were talking about, you know, how these
[44:23] world events and, you know, how they're
[44:25] after the oil and, you know, he brought
[44:27] up a thought. He says, "Yeah, but you
[44:28] know, um, you know, Brother Brandham
[44:31] mentioned it, you know, one time in the
[44:33] scripture or or when he was preaching
[44:35] about how he said that, um, the nation,
[44:38] you know, that they would take control
[44:40] through military dictatorship."
[44:43] And you know, and I found the quote, and
[44:45] the quote goes back in, you know, from
[44:48] 1963,
[44:49] uh, the third exodus. Uh, Brother Bran
[44:52] was speaking about, um, you know,
[44:54] President Kennedy at the time and
[44:56] talking about how he had nationalized
[44:58] the guard, you know, because of the, um,
[45:01] desegregating,
[45:02] you know, of the blacks and, you know,
[45:04] to to kind of stop what like was what
[45:08] was going on. and and you know he had
[45:10] used the the National Guard to you know
[45:12] sort of protect the black people you
[45:15] know but really the motive was to gain
[45:17] their their votes and to gain their you
[45:20] know their their confidence and so
[45:21] forth. But what was interesting was that
[45:24] you know he he says here he says that um
[45:27] and Mr. Kennedy nationalized the guard
[45:29] and send those men right back into the
[45:31] face of their own father standing there
[45:34] under the constitution that broke the
[45:37] constitution again said we'll not fight
[45:40] no sir and said I hope the nation can
[45:44] find out that we're not living anymore
[45:47] under democracy
[45:49] but under military dictatorship
[45:53] and this is now what we're actually
[45:54] witnessing in the world in how that you
[45:58] know these global powers and clearly
[46:02] here even President Trump you know using
[46:05] his uh global um you know influence and
[46:09] his power militarily to you know to take
[46:14] control.
[46:16] Amen. So it's interesting times saints
[46:19] and of course we know that you know that
[46:21] it's all under levels of deception
[46:25] many forms of deception when it comes to
[46:27] the foolish and the wise virgins uh many
[46:30] different compound meanings uh you know
[46:32] right from the you know the regular
[46:35] Christian churches out there they all
[46:37] think that they have a revelation of
[46:39] Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus who is the
[46:42] word right they they they they don't
[46:45] realize you that the oil uh that's you
[46:49] know that's um that that is the Holy
[46:52] Ghost they they don't realize they don't
[46:55] have any revelation of the oil. You know
[46:58] the majority of of the the churches out
[47:01] there the you know denominational
[47:03] churches they have no revelation on what
[47:06] the oil really truly represents which is
[47:09] the Holy Ghost the purpose of God to
[47:12] come and possess his sons and his
[47:14] daughters. Amen. Praise God through the
[47:17] message of the hour. And so, go to the
[47:20] next slide. Um, you know, on uh New
[47:22] Year's Eve, we brought this inspiration
[47:24] on Give Me My Mountain, and it kind of
[47:27] inspired me to go a little deeper into
[47:29] the capstone and to look into it. And
[47:32] this is why, you know, um, you know,
[47:34] we're going to look at this. I don't
[47:35] know how long this series will go. Could
[47:38] be a few services. Let's just see what
[47:41] the Lord's going to do. Amen. But um you
[47:44] know it's uh you know we've heard that
[47:46] we're under the capstone ministry. We
[47:48] just sang it, right? We just sang it
[47:51] that this is the this is the capstone
[47:53] age. It's the age where the mighty angel
[47:56] himself which is the capstone comes down
[47:59] to meet with the body. Amen. To produce
[48:03] the actual capping of the pyramid. Amen.
[48:07] And you know so we've heard it said it's
[48:09] the capstone age. then there has to be a
[48:11] capstone revelation. Amen. And that's
[48:14] what we want to look at today. Let's uh
[48:17] let's read our scripture. Um we're going
[48:19] to look at Enoch
[48:21] in uh Genesis 5:21
[48:24] to 24.
[48:26] It says, "And Enoch lived
[48:30] 60 and5 years and begat Methuselah.
[48:35] And Enoch walked with God after he begat
[48:38] Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and
[48:42] daughters. And all the days of Enoch
[48:45] were 365
[48:47] years. And Enoch walked with God and he
[48:51] was not for God took him. Amen.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; You know, when I read scripture and and
[48:59] I know that, you know, when you read
[49:00] scripture because the Holy Ghost in us
[49:05] gives us the ability to uh to to see and
[49:09] and see the the the life that's behind
[49:11] the scripture. It it just you can't help
[49:14] but see certain things, you know. And as
[49:16] I'm reading this, I'm saying, "And Enoch
[49:18] lived 60 and five years
[49:22] and begat Methuselah, right?" And I
[49:24] thought, oh, 65 years. And I thought,
[49:27] well, 1963,
[49:29] you know, if you add 65 years to that,
[49:31] it brings us into 2028,
[49:34] right? And begott Methuselah. And we
[49:36] know that Methuselah is a type of the
[49:38] millennium
[49:40] because he lived, he was the long, I
[49:41] believe he was the longest, you know,
[49:43] uh, uh, one after Adam lived like 969
[49:48] years, almost 1,000 years. And so, now
[49:51] I'm not putting anything on that. I'm
[49:53] not saying, "Oh, 2028, we're out of
[49:56] here." No, we could be out of here
[49:58] today.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; We could be out tomorrow. We could be
[50:02] out 50 years from now. Nobody is going
[50:05] to put anything on it. But I can tell
[50:07] you, it's close.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Because how do we know it's close?
[50:11] Because the revelation burns within our
[50:13] hearts.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a there's a
[50:16] revelation. See, Enoch had a revelation
[50:19] that was burning within him. He had the
[50:21] revelation of the mystery of God in him
[50:24] to the point where he actually built the
[50:26] pyramids and he built the great pyramid.
[50:29] Amen. And how do we know that? Because
[50:31] God sent us a prophet that was able to
[50:34] go into the mind of God. Science and
[50:36] people out there and you know there's
[50:38] speculation on how those pyramids were
[50:40] made. But we know that it was Enoch that
[50:43] built that pyramid. And so let's read
[50:46] our uh quote here. Brother Bram speaking
[50:48] here. He says in um the infallibility of
[50:51] God's spoken word, he says, "Enoch,
[50:53] Enoch, before the world, the
[50:56] anti-delivian destruction, if he wanted
[50:59] to show a type, how could he do it if he
[51:02] didn't want Enoch to die?
[51:07] He had to make a translation for him. So
[51:11] God just made a rapture for him. God had
[51:14] to do it in order to make a type out of
[51:16] Enoch. That's right.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, God is showing us through
[51:22] the scriptures
[51:24] that Enoch is a perfect type of what the
[51:28] bride of Jesus Christ is going to
[51:30] experience.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; And so that's why we want to we want to
[51:33] dig into Enoch's life and we want to
[51:36] look into, you know, his life and, you
[51:38] know, some of the things that that we
[51:40] draw out of it. Amen. And so here, you
[51:43] know, what what we can see here is we
[51:45] want to thank the Lord first of all that
[51:46] God sent us a prophet that was able to
[51:49] go into into the mind of God and allows
[51:51] us by the Holy Ghost to experience the
[51:54] same thoughts and the same revelation
[51:56] that he had. Amen. While he was here
[51:59] preaching the word of God. And that's
[52:01] why when we when we read the quotes of
[52:04] the prophet and and and uh uh the
[52:07] inspiration that was on him comes on you
[52:10] then you know that it's the same God.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same revelation. It's
[52:15] it's God in in in progression of what
[52:19] he's doing now so that we can apply this
[52:22] revelation of this type of you know
[52:25] these quotes to our day and see
[52:27] ourselves and how we fit into those
[52:30] types.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we want to see how it's
[52:33] going to produce in our day. Glory to
[52:36] God. Brother Brandon brought these
[52:37] quotes back in 1963 and you know and and
[52:41] and so forth. But how does it apply to
[52:43] us today? How's that revelation living
[52:47] out of us today? Because listen, in
[52:50] Enoch, there was a lot of mystery. There
[52:52] was a lot of silence. There's not a lot
[52:54] said about Enoch's life.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; But yet, he had the complete revelation
[53:00] in him.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; How do you know he had it? Because he
[53:05] walked with God.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. And God revealed
[53:09] exactly what was in his mind to Enoch.
[53:14] And Enoch was able to express it
[53:18] so that we could see the types. So, you
[53:20] know, there's a mystery in the way that
[53:23] God reveals his word. And there's a
[53:26] silence in the mystery, but yet within
[53:29] that silence, there's there's
[53:31] individuals that are still manifesting
[53:34] the interpretation of that silence.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; And this is the element, you know, that
[53:40] that that we're breaking into as the
[53:43] bride of Christ. We are the ones that
[53:45] are that are in the midst of this
[53:47] mystery. We're we're in this world.
[53:49] People look at us, they wonder, "Boy,
[53:53] you you're you're strange. You're
[53:55] peculiar." Yeah. Well, you know, this
[53:58] revelation that's on us makes us
[54:01] peculiar. I can imagine Enoch was very
[54:04] peculiar in his day.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; When the people would see him, what are
[54:08] you doing, Enoch? I'm building the altar
[54:11] of the Lord.
[54:14] So we want we want to see and understand
[54:18] as we look at this life how it pertains
[54:21] to us and you know how we can kind of
[54:24] you know see where the Lord wants to
[54:26] place us in the whole thing because you
[54:29] know we we we talked about give me my
[54:31] mountain. Well there's a portion of the
[54:33] word that's yours.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; And you need to you need to get a hold
[54:40] of it. It's a revelation of you, your
[54:43] part, who you are, the part that you're
[54:47] to fulfill here within this local
[54:49] ministry.
[54:51] Everything. Listen, we we want to bring
[54:53] this home. We want You want to know why
[54:56] you're a part of this ministry? You
[54:58] don't want to be just a churchgoer. Is
[55:00] that Is that what you want? You want to
[55:01] be a church member? Oh, I go to church.
[55:04] There's a lot of There's thousands of
[55:05] people going to church. But there's got
[55:08] to be a revelation of why you are a part
[55:11] of the church and the body of Jesus
[55:14] Christ in this day and in this hour.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; That's what we're interested in. Amen.
[55:19] So, we come to realize that um you know,
[55:23] you know, we've been ministering on this
[55:25] whole series of the purpose of God and
[55:27] this is really like an offshoot, but yet
[55:29] it's a part of it because this is all
[55:31] part of the purpose of God. And what are
[55:33] we coming to realize? that we have a
[55:34] part that we have a part in the great
[55:37] mystery of Christ being revealed in
[55:40] these days and that you know though in
[55:44] 1963 the mighty angel came down and
[55:47] finished the mystery of God in that he
[55:50] he took William Branham he expressed
[55:54] through the life of William Branham
[55:55] brother Brham he expressed his uh you
[55:58] know how how god was was uh manifesting
[56:02] in human flesh
[56:05] He was the He was brother Brandham was
[56:07] the wave sheath
[56:08] &gt;&gt; of what we are going to manifest and and
[56:11] and and eventually be in in our personal
[56:16] walks with God.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Some have already come into their
[56:20] manifestation. Some are slowly coming
[56:22] out of the amnesia still not realizing.
[56:26] But yet those that are recognizing have
[56:28] entered into that element of perfect
[56:30] faith
[56:31] &gt;&gt; to know what God is doing in this hour.
[56:34] Amen. And so, Brother Brandham was the
[56:38] first to come to that full maturity
[56:41] in the manifestation
[56:43] of of a son of man revealing the son of
[56:48] man and then the two uniting together
[56:52] where now the son of man is being uh is
[56:55] manifesting in bride form
[56:58] &gt;&gt; where Christ the capstone has come to
[57:01] meet with the body and unite with the
[57:03] body.
[57:05] and allow the revelation of the mystery
[57:07] to live through our personal lives.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. So, the
[57:13] mystery of the seventh seal is all
[57:15] playing out.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; It It's still in progress.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is not finished.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is the coming of the
[57:27] Lord.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham said.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and we know that now. And
[57:34] so this the the seventh seal continues
[57:37] to unfold and it's unfolding in your
[57:40] lives.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; It's going to unfold into the rapture.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to then unfold into the
[57:47] millennial reign. Amen. And then it's
[57:50] going to unfold into the into the uh the
[57:53] the the future home of the bride and and
[57:56] the and the the the heavenly bridegroom
[57:58] and the and the bride. Amen. It's all
[58:01] manifesting. It's in progression.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; And and those that have recognized that
[58:06] that the seal is open and that it's it's
[58:10] they they've also recognized that
[58:12] they're a part of that seal.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; And they're in manifestation of that of
[58:17] that open book because they have THE
[58:19] OPEN BOOK. THE BIBLE has become A BRAND
[58:22] NEW BOOK. THAT'S why when we read these
[58:24] things, when we when we look at the
[58:26] types, when we see what the what brother
[58:29] Brandham said, we we can identify with
[58:32] it, we can see ourselves in it.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; We can see that we're that we're that
[58:37] element in in 2025 or 2026.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And that there's a mountain that we are
[58:44] a part of.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; That we have to go and take a hold of.
[58:48] Amen. Praise God forever more. And so,
[58:52] you know, it was interesting as I was,
[58:54] you know, reading and studying all of
[58:55] this, you just see certain things and I
[58:58] and I went back and I and I looked at,
[59:00] you know, Enoch walked with God.
[59:04] I said, "Who else walked with God?" Do
[59:07] you know that when when you put it in
[59:09] the in the in the search in the Bible in
[59:12] the King James version, there's only two
[59:15] that actually walked with God.
[59:19] And it was Noah
[59:22] and Enoch. And they were around right at
[59:25] the same time. One's building a an altar
[59:27] unto the Lord. And the other one is
[59:30] building an ark to take them through the
[59:33] tribulation that's going to come upon
[59:35] the earth. And there we know that
[59:37] there's all types there. Okay? We can
[59:40] see how Noah could type the foolish
[59:41] virgin and then he could type the bride
[59:43] and then he could like there's so many
[59:45] compound revelations there. But we do
[59:47] know that it's interesting that the two
[59:51] of them were given revelation
[59:54] on building.
[59:57] They had revelation because we know that
[1:00:00] the ark also types Christ.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And that you know once
[1:00:05] you're in Christ, God seals you
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; until the day of your redemption. Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; It was God that sealed the ark
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; that nothing could come in. Nothing
[1:00:18] could touch them. They were protected.
[1:00:20] They were sealed until the day of their
[1:00:23] redemption when the waters subsided.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so, you know, we realize
[1:00:32] that Enoch typed all of this and his
[1:00:35] walk with God eventually produced his
[1:00:39] translation.
[1:00:41] because the revelation
[1:00:43] became so
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; real.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; He started to he started to see that
[1:00:50] that you know that that God was actually
[1:00:53] revealing things to him that you know
[1:00:55] because in that pyramid is the entire
[1:01:00] plan of redemption
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; all about the king and the queen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. all about God wanting to dwell in
[1:01:11] humans here on earth to have a a reign
[1:01:14] with his with his uh with with his w
[1:01:17] with himself
[1:01:19] in bride form in female form. God wanted
[1:01:23] to have a family here on earth. But it
[1:01:25] was a God family.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; It was a God family. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:01:31] But Enoch got so caught up into the
[1:01:33] revelation that God started to realize,
[1:01:35] wait a minute here. He's at the final.
[1:01:37] He's He's He's at He's at that final
[1:01:39] point where where where he's going to
[1:01:41] put the capstone. Oh. Oh, hang on a
[1:01:43] minute here. This is, you know, I
[1:01:46] imagine you know what they must have
[1:01:47] thought when they looked at the pyramid
[1:01:49] that Enoch had built and see that there
[1:01:51] was no capstone. They're wondering
[1:01:53] where's where's the capstone? What's
[1:01:55] going on, Enoch?
[1:01:57] all of a sudden they want to go find and
[1:01:59] and and you know kind of ask Enoch
[1:02:01] themselves, but he was he was not
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; cuz God took him. And so when we look at
[1:02:07] that, we look at that capstone and and
[1:02:10] you know that that that we see there's a
[1:02:12] mystery all around it. It looked
[1:02:14] unfinished. What happened? There was a
[1:02:17] mystery between when he got to the very
[1:02:20] top of the pyramid and then God took
[1:02:23] him. Imagine
[1:02:26] and no capstone. And there is a silence
[1:02:30] in this whole element. There's a mystery
[1:02:32] in it all.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; But yet, we're in the days of the where
[1:02:37] where where Revelations 10 1-7
[1:02:41] said that in the days of the voice of
[1:02:44] the of the uh the the seventh angel when
[1:02:48] he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
[1:02:51] God would be finished.
[1:02:54] God would be revealing
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; what was in that element of the silence.
[1:02:59] Amen. Glory to God. Let's read our let's
[1:03:01] let's uh read a quote here from Christ
[1:03:03] is the mystery of God revealed. He says,
[1:03:06] listen, so we're looking at all the
[1:03:08] types here. We're seeing how God shows
[1:03:10] these types and what and and and and the
[1:03:13] mystery of what was all through. And he
[1:03:15] goes, God's great mystery of how it's a
[1:03:17] secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody
[1:03:20] knowed nothing about it. Even the angels
[1:03:23] didn't understand it. See, he didn't
[1:03:26] reveal it. That's the reason under our
[1:03:30] seventh mystery, when the seventh seal
[1:03:33] was open, there was silence.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus, when he was on the earth, they
[1:03:38] wanted to know when he would come. He
[1:03:40] said, "It's not even the son of man
[1:03:44] himself
[1:03:45] don't know when it's going to happen."
[1:03:47] See, God has this all to himself. Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; God had an appointed time.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; God is not going to go ahead of himself.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a plan. And so here, go to
[1:04:02] the next. It's a secret, he says. And
[1:04:04] that's the reason there was silence in
[1:04:06] heaven for the space of half an hour.
[1:04:10] And seven thunders uttered their voices.
[1:04:12] And John was even forbidden to write it.
[1:04:16] See the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; So, we know that that the opening of
[1:04:21] that seventh seal and those seven
[1:04:24] thunders
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; uttering their voices was a revelation
[1:04:29] of the coming of the Lord.
[1:04:32] And in those seven thunders was the
[1:04:35] silence
[1:04:36] was the was the mystery was the was the
[1:04:39] revelation
[1:04:41] that WOULD THAT WOULD CAP OFF THE ENTIRE
[1:04:44] age that would bring the bride into her
[1:04:48] perfection that would lead her into a
[1:04:52] perfect revelation of her position in
[1:04:55] the word of God.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; But it's in silence. IT'S IN MYSTERY.
[1:05:00] BUT YET IT'S MANIFESTING.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; WE'RE LOOKING back and we're seeing
[1:05:05] that. Wait a minute. In the mystery and
[1:05:06] in the silence THERE'S A MANIFESTATION.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT EVERYBODY SEES IT.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; WHAT? WHAT? WHAT IS THAT?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT? Because there's that's one thing
[1:05:18] he hasn't revealed yet of how he will
[1:05:22] come and when he will come. It's a good
[1:05:27] thing that he doesn't know that he
[1:05:30] doesn't know. And then he goes on, he
[1:05:33] says next slide he says he has showed or
[1:05:36] revealed it in every type that's in the
[1:05:39] Bible. Yeah.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; So if we want to understand our placing
[1:05:45] in the word, what it is to produce in
[1:05:47] our lives, then we need to be able to
[1:05:50] have the revelation
[1:05:52] and the Holy Ghost to be able to bring
[1:05:55] the word to life.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. To to to recognize the word and
[1:06:01] bring it to life. He says, "Therefore,
[1:06:03] the entire Bible is the revelation of
[1:06:06] God's mystery in Christ."
[1:06:09] H he says the entire Bible is an
[1:06:12] expression of one goal that God had one
[1:06:15] purpose that he wanted to achieve in the
[1:06:17] entire Bible. And all the acts listen
[1:06:20] and all the acts of the believers. Are
[1:06:24] you a believer this morning?
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Then you can be identified with this
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; that that of the believers in the Bible
[1:06:31] has been a type and expressing what
[1:06:35] God's great goal is. And now in this
[1:06:38] last day, he has revealed it and shows
[1:06:42] it
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; and God's help will see it right here
[1:06:46] this morning. What the Lord has had in
[1:06:48] his mind all along and has expressed it.
[1:06:54] Thank you.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; SO ALL THE TYPES EVERYTHING THAT we see
[1:06:58] all that that you know that that is that
[1:07:00] that is a mystery you know people
[1:07:04] listening in maybe on this service that
[1:07:06] you know they they don't have uh you
[1:07:08] know um a lot of the the the the
[1:07:10] background and the teachings of the
[1:07:12] revelation of this message of the
[1:07:15] ministry of brother William Branham and
[1:07:17] what he what what he represented as the
[1:07:20] seventh church age messenger. There's
[1:07:22] elements in there that that lays the
[1:07:24] foundation for what it is that we are
[1:07:27] ministering on here today. And it's
[1:07:29] important to have that understanding and
[1:07:32] that background for this to to really
[1:07:35] bring you into into a perfect faith
[1:07:39] experience with the word of God so that
[1:07:41] you can see yourself in the word.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; It's it's so important to be able to
[1:07:47] recognize what Jesus is doing today.
[1:07:51] Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; In this hour,
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; what the word says about the church,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; where she fits into the whole program of
[1:08:00] God. Look at all the types throughout
[1:08:02] the Bible. The coming of the Lord has
[1:08:04] always been in secret.
[1:08:07] While it was played out, but yet today
[1:08:10] the seals have been taken off the book
[1:08:13] and the book is open,
[1:08:15] but it's not open to everybody.
[1:08:18] And this is the element that's that's,
[1:08:20] you know, oh, what do you make yourself?
[1:08:22] You make yourself something. No, we're
[1:08:23] not making ourselves anything. But I
[1:08:26] can't help seeing what I'm seeing.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; I can't help it that when I read the
[1:08:30] word and when I listen to the messenger
[1:08:33] and I hear God's voice speaking to me
[1:08:37] over the pulpit through the five-fold
[1:08:38] ministry, I can't help but identify
[1:08:41] myself in all these types in the
[1:08:43] scriptures.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You got to BE ABLE TO SEE
[1:08:48] JESUS CHRIST in every type because in
[1:08:50] the unveiling of Jesus Christ in this
[1:08:52] hour, it unveils you.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE UNVEILING THAT'S WHAT
[1:08:58] THE MIGHTY VEIL WHEN WHEN the veils rips
[1:09:01] back, it's going to see the bride of
[1:09:03] Jesus Christ
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; in in bright form, the the son of man uh
[1:09:08] revealing himself, speaking his word,
[1:09:11] the final voice to the final age.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But it's a
[1:09:17] revelation personally to each attribute
[1:09:20] who is ordained to see it. When? In the
[1:09:23] end time.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; When was this mystery to be revealed? In
[1:09:27] the end time.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; What age are we in? We're in the We're
[1:09:31] in the last days.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; We're in the Daniel spoke about it that
[1:09:35] seal it up until the time of the end.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; This is that time.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; This is the time of the end. This is
[1:09:43] when the mystery is to be unlocked.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; This is when the capstone when when when
[1:09:48] when they look into that capstone,
[1:09:51] they're not going to see just white.
[1:09:53] They're going to see themselves.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're going to see the
[1:09:57] word manifesting through their lives.
[1:10:00] Amen. Glory to God. And so, so this day
[1:10:03] under the seventh church age messenger,
[1:10:06] the seventh seal is opened.
[1:10:09] And yet there's silence. And there's
[1:10:12] still silence.
[1:10:16] People look at your life and they wonder
[1:10:20] what is it?
[1:10:22] Why are they so excited?
[1:10:26] What's going on in them?
[1:10:29] There's an Enoch revelation
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; that's burning within their hearts to
[1:10:34] bring forth the full revelation of God
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; in this day and in this hour.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; The fullness of the word has been
[1:10:42] revealed to her. and she can't help but
[1:10:45] but but but look into the scripture,
[1:10:47] identify the seven church ages,
[1:10:49] recognize the messengers to each age.
[1:10:52] See how the Holy Ghost moved into every
[1:10:54] one of those church age messengers and
[1:10:57] unveiled Christ in the midst of them.
[1:11:00] She can't help it. You've been given the
[1:11:03] Holy Ghost to recognize Jesus said, he
[1:11:05] said that I will give you the comforter
[1:11:08] which is the Holy Ghost
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; and he will guide you into all truth.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Well, what's the truth? The word.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no higher truth. Glory to
[1:11:19] God. So, we've got all these examples,
[1:11:22] you know, and it was always in mystery.
[1:11:25] Just look back at, you know, go back and
[1:11:27] take Ruth for example in the book of
[1:11:30] Ruth and you know how Boaz
[1:11:32] you know Boaz gives Ruth six
[1:11:36] measures of barley
[1:11:38] but here he is
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; he's the he he's he he's the seventh in
[1:11:43] in a mystery
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; because he he had the seed
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; that she needed. Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; But you know when when Ruth went back to
[1:11:52] Naomi and said, "Naomi," you know, Naomi
[1:11:54] says, "Tell me what took place
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; between you." She says, "Well, he gave
[1:12:00] me six six measures of barley." She
[1:12:02] says, "Hallelujah."
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Well, hold on a minute here. This ain't
[1:12:07] OVER YET.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; THIS AIN'T OVER YET.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; There's something. There's a mystery
[1:12:11] here.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people read that and
[1:12:14] wondering what that's all about. Says,
[1:12:15] "No, no. This this thing is going to be
[1:12:17] finished. This mystery is going to be
[1:12:20] MADE KNOWN. IT'S GOING to be finished.
[1:12:22] Because when when when when somebody
[1:12:25] gives barley, when when a man gives six
[1:12:28] measures of barley to a woman, it's
[1:12:30] saying that he's going to be her
[1:12:32] provider.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; That he's that there's more coming.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so, so Ruth, she she was
[1:12:39] a she was a gentile.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; She didn't have the understanding like
[1:12:43] Naomi had.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. But but all
[1:12:47] all she knew is that, you know, she she
[1:12:49] she was mesmerized by by by by Boaz, but
[1:12:53] so was Boaz mesmerized by her.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; BOAZ HAD A CHOICE.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; BOAZ KNEW THAT THERE was that there was
[1:13:01] going to be a redemption. Amen. That
[1:13:04] there was going to he'd be the he'd be
[1:13:05] the kinsman. Hallelujah. But he had to
[1:13:08] play the he had to play IT ALL OUT. HE
[1:13:10] HAD TO ALLOW, you know, the he called,
[1:13:12] you know, the the the the the the
[1:13:14] judges to come to the gate, you know, at
[1:13:17] the barley time. Amen. Right. At the
[1:13:19] evening time, you know, and and he gave
[1:13:21] the opportunity to another
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; kinsman.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; But that kinsman was more interested in
[1:13:28] his current inheritance. He was more
[1:13:32] interested in what he had to deal with
[1:13:35] because he had children he wanted to
[1:13:37] give his his inheritance to. He didn't
[1:13:39] want to have to marry Ruth because a
[1:13:42] part of the redemption is that you got
[1:13:44] to take her as wife. When when when to
[1:13:46] to to redeem the land, you got to take
[1:13:48] the wife in order to bring forth an
[1:13:51] heir.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. So what what is
[1:13:54] it? It was all mystery. It was all in
[1:13:57] mystery. But Boaz knew exactly what he
[1:14:00] was doing.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; And he knew that Ruth would be his
[1:14:04] prize.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Look at the
[1:14:07] woman at the well.
[1:14:09] It was in mystery.
[1:14:11] Here comes Jesus. I have need to go to
[1:14:14] Samaria. Goes to Samaria. Who's there? A
[1:14:18] woman comes to the well. Starts to talk
[1:14:21] to her. She's a gentile. Starts to talk
[1:14:24] to her. Tell her that she's got five
[1:14:26] husbands and the one she's with,
[1:14:29] the sixth, is not even hers.
[1:14:33] BUT THE SEVENTH WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE
[1:14:35] SPEAKING TO HER.
[1:14:37] You see that was the mystery and you
[1:14:40] WONDER WHY WHY WHY WHY DID HE GO TO THE
[1:14:42] woman at the well and she was the only
[1:14:45] one you know that she was the only one
[1:14:47] while he was here that he revealed I am
[1:14:49] he when she said you know when he
[1:14:51] started to tell her all about herself
[1:14:52] and her life and her prostitution and
[1:14:55] and you know when God started to tell
[1:14:57] you about all your your your your living
[1:14:59] and the way that you used to live and
[1:15:00] and and you know started to discern all
[1:15:02] the things in your life you knew that
[1:15:04] you would come into contact with
[1:15:06] something that was was supernatural.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't IT WASN'T JUST, YOU KNOW, A
[1:15:12] CHURCH ALTAR CALL.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Where there was a big
[1:15:15] gathering of people. No, this is
[1:15:17] personal.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; This is God speaking direct.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; He's he's discerning the very need
[1:15:22] that's in her heart.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; He knows the very need that's in your
[1:15:26] heart this morning. Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And what does he DO? AND SHE SAYS WHEN
[1:15:29] MESSIAH COMES, he's going to he's going
[1:15:32] to do these things. AND HE SAYS, "IT IS
[1:15:34] I. I AM HE." He was revealing THE
[1:15:38] MYSTERY
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; TO THE GENTILE PROSTITUTE.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Such were you and I.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; But this mystery has been revealed. IT
[1:15:48] BURNS WITHIN OUR HEARTS. IT'S A
[1:15:50] REVELATION THAT WE CAN'T HELP. WHY?
[1:15:53] BECAUSE WE'VE COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE
[1:15:55] LIVING GOD. THE LIVING JESUS.
[1:15:59] [cheering]
[1:16:01] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. LOOK AT MARY
[1:16:06] MAGDALENE. She goes to the grave
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; right there. You know, you know, to to
[1:16:12] to find the body because, you know, SHE
[1:16:14] WAS GOING TO GET THE BODY BECAUSE, YOU
[1:16:15] KNOW, SHE they were going to bury the
[1:16:17] body and they were going to uh you know,
[1:16:18] she wanted to go see where the body was.
[1:16:20] She had heard. And she goes there and
[1:16:22] the and the mighty angel had come down
[1:16:24] and rolled away the stone.
[1:16:27] And here she is. And Mary was the one
[1:16:29] whom whom whom had seven devils cast out
[1:16:33] of her.
[1:16:36] That goes to tell you that every church
[1:16:38] age had demon power
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; that need to be cast out, including this
[1:16:43] seventh church age
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; because God is GOING TO CALL A CHURCH
[1:16:47] OUT OF THE CHURCH.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He's bringing a bride out of
[1:16:51] the church
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; because that pale horse rider is still
[1:16:54] riding and deceiving the very people in
[1:16:57] this day and in this hour and in this
[1:16:59] message.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; But she will not be deceived.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Because the mighty angel has come down.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; He's resurrected.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; And she's going, "Uh, where have you put
[1:17:14] his body?" She didn't recognize that
[1:17:16] that was Jesus.
[1:17:18] She thought it was the gardener, but he
[1:17:20] says, "WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR the
[1:17:22] living amongst the dead?"
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; And she's going, "Yeah, but where have
[1:17:25] you PUT HIM?" AND THEN HE SAID, "MARY."
[1:17:28] And she went,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; "Lord,"
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; you see, IT WASN'T UNTIL her name was
[1:17:35] called that she came into an awakening.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:39] And under this seventh mystery, under
[1:17:42] the opening of those thunders, under the
[1:17:44] the revealing of that SEVENTH SEAL IN
[1:17:46] THE BOOK of redemption, there's names.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And your name is being called. How do
[1:17:52] you know your name's being called?
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; What are you REJOICING ABOUT?
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE Y'ALL EXCITED ABOUT?
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; What's what's what's so exciting about
[1:18:00] what I'm saying here? We've heard this
[1:18:03] story so many times. We've heard talk
[1:18:06] about how they went to the tomb and how
[1:18:08] they didn't find him and then the the
[1:18:09] the you know that the other disciples
[1:18:11] didn't believe and this and that. No,
[1:18:14] BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD AN AWAKENING.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT THAT SAME REVELATION in you
[1:18:19] of the resurrection.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'VE COME INTO A
[1:18:23] REVELATION of this mighty angel that's
[1:18:25] come down in 1963
[1:18:28] that's UNVEILING HIMSELF AND NOW moved
[1:18:31] into you and me. Praise our God.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; All under a mystery.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is still unfolding.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Like we said, it's unveiling itself.
[1:18:43] Amen. It's going to it's going to
[1:18:45] continue. Listen, let's go to the next
[1:18:46] slide here in number 13. It says, he
[1:18:48] says, therefore, you can see the great
[1:18:51] meaning. Now, here brother Brandham
[1:18:53] speaking. He says, you can see the great
[1:18:55] meaning of what it's been to know this
[1:18:58] and to try to bring it to the people,
[1:19:01] the mystery. See, and then you don't I I
[1:19:04] haven't went into details to try to
[1:19:06] explain it as God has revealed it to me.
[1:19:10] Can you believe that? Brother Brandham
[1:19:13] was under that revelation of the seventh
[1:19:16] seal. Saw everything that we're talking
[1:19:20] about here.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; SAW ALL THE TYPES. THAT'S WHY HE BROUGHT
[1:19:23] IT OUT IN CHRIST is the mystery of God
[1:19:25] revealed. This message is the seventh
[1:19:28] seal. That's
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; that whole message is is preaching the
[1:19:31] seventh seal about Christ and what is
[1:19:34] the mystery and here he is he's saying
[1:19:37] now you you could now do YOU UNDERSTAND
[1:19:38] HOW IT'S been for me to be able to see
[1:19:42] all that I've been seeing here but yet
[1:19:44] you know that while he was in the
[1:19:46] meetings while he was you know before he
[1:19:48] went to preach the seventh seal he says
[1:19:51] you know we're going to we're going to
[1:19:52] have questions and answers so that we
[1:19:54] can you know because I don't I think
[1:19:58] people are seeing what's really
[1:20:00] happening here
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; and and you know even to the very point
[1:20:04] where where just like in this day and in
[1:20:06] this hour here he is the mighty angel
[1:20:09] himself but they want to put him just
[1:20:11] back into the tapes.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; They want to just put him they they they
[1:20:14] want to organize it and say no this is
[1:20:16] the only place this is the only voice
[1:20:19] there's no other voice it's only William
[1:20:21] Brother Brandham's voice that you need
[1:20:23] to listen to. No, no, no. I'm hearing
[1:20:25] the voice of my beloved this morning.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I'm hearing his voice come through the
[1:20:30] word of God. I hear his voice when he
[1:20:33] speaks through the quotes. I hear his
[1:20:35] voice in the scripture. I hear his voice
[1:20:38] coming over the pulpit through the
[1:20:39] five-fold ministry.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; It's the voice of my beloved.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BOTTLED UP, BUT YET it's being
[1:20:51] silenced. [snorts]
[1:20:52] It's being revealed in silence. It's a
[1:20:55] mystery in your life. Your life is
[1:20:57] unfolding in such a way people look at
[1:20:59] it's a peculiar life they can't quite
[1:21:01] figure you out. Why? Because you're a
[1:21:04] dedicated son or daughter of God like
[1:21:07] Enoch. You know what the word Enoch
[1:21:08] means? Dedicated.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Dedicated to what? To the word.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; And so he goes on here in quote 14. He
[1:21:16] says it goes right by them and they
[1:21:18] don't recognize it till it's gone. It's
[1:21:21] only It only picks up, listen now, it
[1:21:24] only picks up the predestinated seed
[1:21:27] that God predestinated
[1:21:29] before the foundations of the earth.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Remember, this is not for everybody.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to convince
[1:21:37] everybody that you talk to.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; The minute this revelation comes in you
[1:21:45] and starts to speak out of you,
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; you start to lose friends, not gain
[1:21:49] them.
[1:21:50] Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; If you're listen, if everybody loves you
[1:21:54] and everybody, you know, wants to be
[1:21:56] around you all the time and everybody
[1:21:58] thinks it's because there's something
[1:22:00] maybe you're not fully expressing
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; in the word of God. Because when Jesus
[1:22:05] was on earth, he was not loved,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; especially when he spoke the word.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; And when that word starts to speak out
[1:22:14] of you and tell people, wait a minute,
[1:22:15] you you no you have not been baptized.
[1:22:18] What do you mean I haven't been
[1:22:19] baptized? Of course, I was baptized.
[1:22:22] Not according to the scripture.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the word of God? Yes, I
[1:22:26] believe the word. Okay, let me show you
[1:22:27] the word. Do you believe that every word
[1:22:29] is inspired by God? I had a I had a a a
[1:22:32] a a one-on-one conference not long ago
[1:22:36] with a Catholic priest and got right
[1:22:39] into this very element of what the Holy
[1:22:42] Ghost is and took every scripture and
[1:22:45] showed it right to him. I said, "Now, do
[1:22:48] you see how every scripture here now? Do
[1:22:50] you believe that every scripture is
[1:22:51] inspired of God?" Nope.
[1:22:56] No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. The
[1:22:59] church has
[1:23:02] a say in this.
[1:23:05] I I was blown away.
[1:23:08] I was totally blown away. The word was
[1:23:11] so clear. But yet, so you see, they
[1:23:15] don't believe the word.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And the moment that you tell them and
[1:23:20] you bring them to a place where the word
[1:23:22] bottles them in,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; they got to either say, "Amen." or they
[1:23:28] got to deny it.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And that's why on that day when they go
[1:23:33] to knock to come in, Jesus is going to
[1:23:37] say, "I never knew you.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; I never knew you.
[1:23:42] Hallelujah. So here he says the same
[1:23:44] thing come through in the days of Noah.
[1:23:46] The same thing come through in the days
[1:23:48] of Moses, the days of Elijah, days of
[1:23:51] the prophets, days of Jesus on down to
[1:23:54] the very hour. the pregnant person with
[1:23:58] the seed of God, the word in there
[1:24:00] manifesting itself so surrendered to the
[1:24:04] will of God that the word and the word
[1:24:08] alone manifests itself in this person.
[1:24:13] They become what? A to the prisoner to
[1:24:17] an individual.
[1:24:20] Paul said one time, I am a prisoner of
[1:24:23] Christ.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Why? because he became a prisoner to the
[1:24:26] word of God.
[1:24:28] It he says there's nothing that can
[1:24:30] separate me from this word.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can separate me
[1:24:35] from the love of God. Amen. Glory to
[1:24:37] God. He says so he goes on here in the
[1:24:40] next quote. He says, "Not say my church
[1:24:43] to an individual." We finished off. Not
[1:24:46] say my church now my church has nothing
[1:24:49] to do with it.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; It's not the church you belong to. It's
[1:24:53] you belonging to Christ.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an individual, one person.
[1:24:58] All hell is against this teaching. All
[1:25:01] hell is against this truth. But it's the
[1:25:03] truth. Jesus never said, "Now Peter, you
[1:25:07] and John, and all the rest of the
[1:25:08] people, you've got the revelation. Now
[1:25:11] the whole church is saved." No, that's
[1:25:14] not what he said. Amen. This is a
[1:25:17] personal revelation. Paul, listen, Paul
[1:25:20] had a revelation. Peter had his own
[1:25:22] revelation. They all needed to have a
[1:25:25] personal revelation of the word of God.
[1:25:27] Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Paul, you know, he said,
[1:25:30] "I am persuaded."
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Are you persuaded?
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Are you persuaded of the revelation that
[1:25:41] God has given you?
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:25:46] You know, you'll be tested in every way
[1:25:50] on whether you're truly persuaded.
[1:25:52] That's what the testing is all about.
[1:25:54] That's what the trials come into our
[1:25:55] lives for.
[1:25:57] God knows that that word that he placed
[1:26:00] inside of you, that attribute of
[1:26:02] himself, he placed it into a vessel.
[1:26:05] He knows that that vessel contains
[1:26:08] within it himself, but you don't fully
[1:26:12] understand it. And in order for that
[1:26:14] vessel, in order for that attribute to
[1:26:17] be expressed, GOD NEEDS TO SOMETIMES
[1:26:19] CRUSH THE VESSEL,
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; he needs to kind of beat the the vessel
[1:26:24] down and and and and open up that earthn
[1:26:27] vessel so that it can express the life
[1:26:30] so that it can express the revelation of
[1:26:33] Jesus Christ is a reality to you that
[1:26:36] the word is your absolute.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; It's not something that you just decided
[1:26:41] to take on. That's what the That's what
[1:26:44] the uh you know the impersonators out
[1:26:46] there do. They thrive off of of off of
[1:26:50] the the popularity of the world and and
[1:26:52] and uh you know it's not revelation.
[1:26:55] It's it's uh you know it's um it's
[1:26:58] popularity.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; They don't want to have to identify with
[1:27:02] the word that that doesn't make you
[1:27:05] popular.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; They're feeding off of that that other
[1:27:09] uh you know spirit. Let's read it here.
[1:27:13] Genesis. Did you know there was another
[1:27:15] Enoch?
[1:27:17] Listen to this. And Cain, Cain went out
[1:27:20] from the presence of the Lord and dwelt
[1:27:22] in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.
[1:27:25] And Cain knew his wife and she conceived
[1:27:28] and bare Enoch. Now, this is not the
[1:27:31] Enoch that we're talking about.
[1:27:34] This is the Enoch that come from the son
[1:27:38] of Cain
[1:27:40] who killed his brother.
[1:27:43] Adam had two sons.
[1:27:46] One son actually,
[1:27:48] Abel. Cain was not the son of Adam.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Cain was the son of the serpent.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; That's why he had the nature of his
[1:27:57] father.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; And look what he does. And he builded
[1:28:00] his now Cain. Cain, remember, Cain had
[1:28:02] his own revelation.
[1:28:05] Cain had a revelation of of of of uh
[1:28:08] what religion was all about.
[1:28:11] So what does he do? He builds a city. He
[1:28:14] builds the world. He builds a city where
[1:28:17] he can go and live and do and and be and
[1:28:20] and and and live uh you know because
[1:28:22] Cain had one problem. He had his own
[1:28:25] will. He wasn't he wasn't subject to the
[1:28:27] will of God. He had his own will. And so
[1:28:30] he would he would build cities. He would
[1:28:33] have a place where he could go and party
[1:28:35] and you know have nightclubs and you
[1:28:37] know you just go you just go back and
[1:28:39] follow the lineage of Cain you will see
[1:28:42] that through the lineage of Cain all the
[1:28:45] technology all the building techn all
[1:28:47] the science all the the worldly uh
[1:28:51] knowledge and and and to the levels of
[1:28:53] of of knowledge that we're in now that's
[1:28:56] all Cain's lineage
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; it's all you know science and and and
[1:29:02] and and knowledge and understanding.
[1:29:04] It's a totally different world. But you
[1:29:07] know that Enoch, the real Enoch, the one
[1:29:09] that we're talking about that we're
[1:29:10] typing here, he was around at that time
[1:29:12] too
[1:29:14] cuz they lived for many, many years. So
[1:29:18] Enoch, he must have seen that city that
[1:29:21] Cain had built and seen what was going
[1:29:24] on in that city and the sin that was
[1:29:27] going on and was building up in that
[1:29:29] city. But the bride, she, you know,
[1:29:31] Enoch, he had no desire for it because
[1:29:33] in him was burning another city.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; God was giving him a revelation whose
[1:29:38] whose s whose builder and maker was God.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; He was he was interested in another
[1:29:45] city.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; He was interested in the one that that
[1:29:48] that is the future home that was being
[1:29:50] revealed to him that God while he was
[1:29:53] walking with God, God was unveiling
[1:29:55] revelation of this real city. But
[1:29:58] meanwhile, Cain had built his own city,
[1:30:01] and it was a city of self-will and
[1:30:03] self-desire and lust and passion.
[1:30:07] But you, such were you.
[1:30:10] Such were I. We we we were we were
[1:30:14] brought into this world and and and and
[1:30:16] we and we fed off of the things of the
[1:30:18] world. We desired the things of the
[1:30:20] world.
[1:30:21] But when that revelation come in you and
[1:30:24] called you
[1:30:26] into a walk with God,
[1:30:30] it dedicated you to the word.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:36] So we see the similarities here. How
[1:30:39] this, you know, how Cain was an
[1:30:40] impersonator,
[1:30:42] the unbeliever, the makeeliever.
[1:30:44] Hallelujah. Same lineage as the serpent.
[1:30:47] Glory to God. But the Enoch that was the
[1:30:50] seventh from Adam, there's that seventh
[1:30:53] mystery again. You know, Enoch was a
[1:30:55] mystery. And he unveiled himself in the
[1:30:58] seventh church age. He was the seventh
[1:31:01] from Adam. Amen. He was diff. He was a
[1:31:04] different lineage. He came from the
[1:31:06] lineage of the image of God.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. He had
[1:31:11] representation in Adam,
[1:31:15] not in Cain. His revelation was to build
[1:31:18] a city whose builder and maker was God.
[1:31:22] Hallelujah. He had a complete revelation
[1:31:24] of the mystery of God.
[1:31:29] His name dedicated.
[1:31:35] Let's read the next scripture.
[1:31:41] And have you not read this scripture?
[1:31:44] The stone which the builders rejected
[1:31:46] has become the head of the corner.
[1:31:49] This was the Lord's doing and it is
[1:31:51] marvelous in our eyes. Hallelujah.
[1:31:55] Praise God. Listen, brother Brandham
[1:31:57] here. He says here in to take on the
[1:31:59] whole armor of God. And now we're
[1:32:02] talking about the capstone. And we're
[1:32:04] talking about, you know, how how you fit
[1:32:07] into it all. Amen. I haven't got my
[1:32:10] purse, he says. But did you ever notice
[1:32:12] on the back of an American dollar over
[1:32:15] on one side, it's got the American seal,
[1:32:17] a eagle with the arrows in its claws,
[1:32:20] the American seal. But in the other
[1:32:23] corner that faces you, I believe the
[1:32:26] right hand corner, he's got a pyramid
[1:32:29] and he's got wrote under there the great
[1:32:31] seal. Can you imagine that the US there
[1:32:34] was an inspiration on the US because at
[1:32:37] one time the US was was built on in God
[1:32:42] we trust.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; They they they believed God. There was
[1:32:47] there was men of God that had revelation
[1:32:50] that that that believed the word of God
[1:32:52] that knew and understood the purpose of
[1:32:54] God, you know, that that that had, you
[1:32:57] know, filtered down from those that had
[1:32:59] come down through the ages that were
[1:33:01] believers that that that were revelated
[1:33:04] by the word of God. And he says, "Now,
[1:33:06] why would our nation would think of
[1:33:08] making it an Egyptian pyramid, the great
[1:33:12] seal above even our seal of American
[1:33:16] eagle?"
[1:33:18] Did you notice just above the mir the
[1:33:20] pyramid is a headstone
[1:33:23] above it like an eye shining through?
[1:33:28] That was the great seal of God.
[1:33:31] It's even going to be uh
[1:33:36] it's going to come right back into their
[1:33:38] face
[1:33:40] when this culmination
[1:33:42] all takes place and the revelation of of
[1:33:46] the of the of the capstone ministry
[1:33:50] comes and manifests through the lives of
[1:33:54] people that are going to be translated
[1:33:56] from this earth.
[1:33:58] It's all going to be there. It's all
[1:34:00] going to be as a witness. God was
[1:34:02] everywhere. God built this pyramid as a
[1:34:06] witness
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; to let them know that he is God
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; and that there's no other religion.
[1:34:14] There's no other teaching.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; It there's no other uh there there's
[1:34:18] nobody that can be placed before God. He
[1:34:21] is the one and only true and living God.
[1:34:24] Every religion will be will will be
[1:34:27] rebuked
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; when they come to see this monument of
[1:34:34] God
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; that he's built called the body of Jesus
[1:34:38] Christ.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on to say, he says, "Now
[1:34:43] I've been to Egypt." Next slide. He
[1:34:46] says, "And in those pyramids, how I
[1:34:48] could take all afternoon." Now, I don't
[1:34:50] believe in doctrines of pyramids. I love
[1:34:52] that when he said that. I don't believe
[1:34:54] in this. It's like he knew that there
[1:34:56] would be some doctrines that would come
[1:34:57] down the road, you know, that that
[1:34:59] people would take this pyramid and they
[1:35:01] would make it a doctrine. We're not
[1:35:02] making it a doctrine.
[1:35:04] We are rec we are recognizing it as a
[1:35:07] revelation and a type of the mighty God
[1:35:10] unveiling himself in the whole plan of
[1:35:14] redemption. Amen. We're not making it
[1:35:17] any kind of a of a of a doctrine. Amen.
[1:35:21] I'm only making a parable. He says here,
[1:35:23] "But as you notice that pyramid, it
[1:35:26] never did receive the stone. Enoch built
[1:35:30] Enoch built that pyramid in his days.
[1:35:33] They can't figure it out." Now, they got
[1:35:35] all kinds of religions on it like they
[1:35:38] have in the zodiac, but everything God
[1:35:40] wrote three Bibles. The first one is in
[1:35:43] the heavens, the second one was in the
[1:35:45] pyramid, and the third one is on earth.
[1:35:48] And every one of them agree with one
[1:35:51] another. Amen.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's got three as a witness
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; that he is God.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; He is the one and only true and living
[1:36:00] God. Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And there's a people on
[1:36:03] the earth in this day and in this hour
[1:36:05] that will stand dedicated to that word.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; That will declare the Lord thy God is
[1:36:11] one.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; There is no other gods before me. NO
[1:36:15] OTHER GODS BESIDE ME. NO OTHER GODS
[1:36:17] after me. Amen. He is the Lord God
[1:36:20] Almighty.
[1:36:22] HE HE'S NOT IN the He's not in the New
[1:36:24] Age movement. No, sir. He's not in the
[1:36:27] in the in the Buddhist teachings. He's
[1:36:30] not in the in the OH MY GOD, THERE'S so
[1:36:32] many DIFFERENT TEACHINGS. HE'S NOT EVEN
[1:36:34] IN all the doctrines of the Christian
[1:36:37] churches out there. They've come up with
[1:36:39] so many different interpretations on
[1:36:41] him.
[1:36:44] He says, "I never knew you."
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Never knew. Why? because he never placed
[1:36:49] himself,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; He never placed his seed in them. When
[1:36:55] when when Adam knew his wife is because
[1:36:58] he injected his seed into Eve to bring
[1:37:02] forth
[1:37:04] of his kind,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; sons and daughters of God.
[1:37:11] You know, in looking at this pyramid,
[1:37:14] this this uh uh altar of God, this uh
[1:37:18] witness of God, we want to look at it
[1:37:20] just, you know, just look at certain
[1:37:22] aspects of it and see because we're
[1:37:24] looking at the types here, right? You
[1:37:26] know, the pyramid of Giza sits at the
[1:37:28] exact center of the earth. It's a proven
[1:37:32] fact. They've gone, they've checked it
[1:37:35] geographically. They've checked it from
[1:37:37] the from the from from above. They've
[1:37:39] looked at the access to every single
[1:37:41] thing. It runs exactly and it's sitting
[1:37:44] perfectly at the center of the earth.
[1:37:47] Why? Because he's the center of all
[1:37:50] things.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. The exact chapter of
[1:37:55] the very center of the Bible, okay? And
[1:37:58] I I think I've mentioned this before and
[1:38:01] you know, but is is Psalms 118 verses 22
[1:38:06] and 23. And you know what it says there?
[1:38:10] It says in Psalms 118, which is the very
[1:38:14] chapter that is the exact center of the
[1:38:17] entire Bible. There's so many chapters
[1:38:19] to the left, so many chapters to the
[1:38:21] right. This one is dead center. It says
[1:38:24] in verse 22, the stone which the
[1:38:27] builders refused is become the headstone
[1:38:29] of the corner.
[1:38:31] This is the Lord's doing. It is
[1:38:34] marvelous in our eyes. Oh, glory to God.
[1:38:37] Let me tell you, saints, this revelation
[1:38:39] of Enoch, this revelation of the mystery
[1:38:42] of God, this revelation of where God is,
[1:38:44] who God is, who it's it's it's
[1:38:47] marvelous.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; It's it's been done by God himself. Only
[1:38:52] God could do this.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Listen, Isaiah
[1:38:57] 19:19,
[1:38:59] he says here, look, even Jesus himself
[1:39:04] uh you know referenced this very
[1:39:06] scripture, okay? Um in in uh in the one
[1:39:10] that in the one that we read in Mark,
[1:39:13] okay, and what did it say? In that day
[1:39:15] shall there be an altar to the Lord in
[1:39:18] the midst of the land of Egypt and a
[1:39:20] pillar at the border thereof to the
[1:39:22] Lord. This is Isaiah 19:19,
[1:39:26] okay? Talking about this altar. In that
[1:39:30] day, there will be an altar. This I
[1:39:32] believe this was the altar. This pyramid
[1:39:35] was the identification of God's type to
[1:39:39] the world of what his word was going to
[1:39:41] produce in in in the fulfillment of all
[1:39:45] scripture. And it is truly in the midst
[1:39:48] of Egypt. Okay? like the scripture says,
[1:39:51] in the midst of the land of Egypt and a
[1:39:53] pillar at the border thereof. Okay? And
[1:39:57] you know, I was reading an article and I
[1:40:00] got this article from 1999. It's called
[1:40:03] End Times Bible Report on the Great
[1:40:05] Pyramid. And I just pulled certain
[1:40:07] things out of it that I thought were
[1:40:09] very interesting and we can and and we
[1:40:12] can see how it, you know, they they they
[1:40:15] tapped into things, but they couldn't
[1:40:17] fully understand.
[1:40:19] But the wise shall know in the end time.
[1:40:23] Amen. And you know, and it goes on to
[1:40:26] say here, he says in this report, it
[1:40:28] says, "How can something be in the
[1:40:30] middle and also at the border?" First of
[1:40:33] all, the great pyramid is a monument
[1:40:35] situated near Gue Giza in Egypt. And the
[1:40:40] word Giza in Arabic means border. That's
[1:40:46] what it means. Henry Mitchell, chief
[1:40:48] hydrog hy hydrographer of the United
[1:40:52] States Coastal Survey, uh, discovered an
[1:40:55] additional clue to this riddle while
[1:40:57] working on the report for the Suez Canal
[1:40:59] in 1868.
[1:41:01] He noticed that the Nile Delta is
[1:41:04] pieshaped like a pyramid.
[1:41:07] Plotting the sector on a map, he found
[1:41:10] that the Great Pyramid of Giza is at the
[1:41:13] exact center of that
[1:41:16] of that Nile Delta which is exactly at
[1:41:20] the border in the midst of Egypt. So the
[1:41:24] scriptur is giving the the word of God.
[1:41:27] It's clear the measurement used by the
[1:41:30] builders. Now listen to this and in this
[1:41:33] whole report I want you to know
[1:41:34] something in this whole four-page report
[1:41:38] they never mention Enoch once.
[1:41:41] So just understand that
[1:41:45] the measurements used by the builders
[1:41:47] the pyramid cubit when divided into the
[1:41:51] base length of the great pyramid is
[1:41:54] exactly 365.242
[1:41:58] pyramid cubits.
[1:42:01] Isn't that interesting?
[1:42:03] You see Enoch had a perfect revelation
[1:42:06] of the word of God. And God placed that
[1:42:09] perfect revelation in Enoch in that
[1:42:11] Enoch lived
[1:42:13] 365
[1:42:15] years
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; and then he was not
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Precisely the number of days. They
[1:42:28] say this they they they reference it
[1:42:30] precisely to the number of days in a
[1:42:32] year. Right.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; But when I saw it, I said, "Yeah, and
[1:42:36] that's exactly how many years Enoch
[1:42:38] lived."
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The scientific and
[1:42:42] mathematical features built into this
[1:42:45] pyramid could only have been known by
[1:42:48] the architect of the universe. This is
[1:42:50] what they said.
[1:42:53] They don't know of any architect or any
[1:42:56] technology or of any science or any way,
[1:42:59] ability, shape or form that these
[1:43:01] pyramids could have been built. But
[1:43:02] listen to what they say. Indeed, most
[1:43:04] pyramids were built as tombs. However,
[1:43:07] there is an abundant proof that the
[1:43:09] Great Pyramid is unique and was not
[1:43:12] intended as a tomb. Just instructions
[1:43:15] were given just as instructions were
[1:43:18] given to Noah for the building of the
[1:43:21] ark and to Moses for the assembling of
[1:43:24] the tabernacle. We submit that God gave
[1:43:27] instructions for the construction of the
[1:43:30] pyramid that it might testify in the
[1:43:33] last days as to his infinite wisdom and
[1:43:36] fornowledge.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Like I said, they never mention Enoch at
[1:43:41] all.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But finally here
[1:43:46] Taylor
[1:43:48] was assisted in his conclusions by the
[1:43:51] writings of the ancient historians
[1:43:54] Herod Doatus and Manthol. They recorded
[1:43:58] that Egyptians helped to build the great
[1:44:02] pyramid under the direction, now pay
[1:44:04] attention, of a shepherd king named
[1:44:08] Felitis.
[1:44:11] Mantho
[1:44:12] himself, an Egyptian, wrote, "There came
[1:44:16] up from the east in a strange manner men
[1:44:20] of in noble race
[1:44:24] who had the confidence to invade our
[1:44:26] country and easily subdue it by their
[1:44:29] power without a battle."
[1:44:32] These humble peaceful invaders were
[1:44:34] styled were were were styled
[1:44:38] haikoso
[1:44:40] that is shepherd kings.
[1:44:43] He then related how afterwards they
[1:44:45] departed for Judea and built a city
[1:44:47] there named Jerusalem. Another
[1:44:50] possibility and these are these are
[1:44:52] their theories
[1:44:54] but pay attention. you've got the
[1:44:57] revelation to draw out of it what is
[1:44:59] truth and what is not.
[1:45:01] Another possibility is that this
[1:45:04] shepherd king was Shem, a faithful son
[1:45:07] of Noah, also known as Malchzdc,
[1:45:12] the king of Salem.
[1:45:15] Peace Jerusalem. Shem would have been
[1:45:19] alive in the time of the building of the
[1:45:21] great pyramid. This and other evidence
[1:45:24] points to a non-Egyptian architect and
[1:45:27] builder of the Great Pyramid and one
[1:45:29] that was closely associated with the God
[1:45:33] of the Bible. Well, they kind of mixed
[1:45:37] up Shem with Enoch
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; because it was Enoch that was given the
[1:45:42] revelation. Enoch had supernatural
[1:45:45] power, supernatural ability to place
[1:45:48] those stones, to place every one of
[1:45:51] those stones into their perfect
[1:45:54] position.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; It could only have been by a
[1:45:58] supernatural God that this pyramid, this
[1:46:01] altar of God was actually built.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; And now the top of the Great Pyramid,
[1:46:06] the top of the Great Pyramid, once
[1:46:08] crowned by by a capstone, is missing.
[1:46:12] Now, brother Brandham says that it never
[1:46:13] got capped, but they're saying when they
[1:46:17] built other pyramids, what they would do
[1:46:19] is they would put a limestone casing
[1:46:22] stone and they were stripped away over
[1:46:25] the centuries. That's what they believe,
[1:46:27] you know, from earthquakes and
[1:46:28] everything else with the capstone left
[1:46:32] to erode at the top. Okay. Now
[1:46:36] this apex element possibly made of gold
[1:46:40] covered electrum was designed to reflect
[1:46:43] sunlight but it vanished long before
[1:46:46] modern times leaving only a weathered
[1:46:48] remnants. Okay, so we know that you know
[1:46:51] the cap stone is not there. You know,
[1:46:54] they talk about potentially being looted
[1:46:56] and everything else, but here what we
[1:47:00] want to look at is that the that there
[1:47:01] was that they were using a a t it's
[1:47:04] called Torah limestone, which they could
[1:47:06] actually it was it was so fine that they
[1:47:09] could polish it so brilliant that the
[1:47:12] sun would actually reflect off of it.
[1:47:16] And this pyramid, even brother Brandham
[1:47:18] said it in in a quote that this pyramid
[1:47:20] was placed perfectly at the center of
[1:47:22] the earth to where all the sides that
[1:47:25] when the sun came up, it would not cast
[1:47:28] a shadow anywhere.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Because the sun was the perfect
[1:47:34] reflection of God.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; And there's no shadow in God.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; There's only types.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; But he is God. He's the one and only and
[1:47:46] the true and living God. Amen.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; So here he goes and and he here's the
[1:47:50] quote here where he says it. I didn't
[1:47:51] put it up there. He says, "We don't have
[1:47:53] engineers like like they had. That great
[1:47:56] pyramid in Egypt is so perfect in the
[1:47:58] center of the earth. No matter where the
[1:48:00] sun is, they're never a shadow around
[1:48:03] it."
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. It's known that the
[1:48:08] limestone that they would use would be
[1:48:10] polished to the point where the sun
[1:48:12] would perfectly reflect off of it.
[1:48:17] Let's go to the next quote. We're
[1:48:20] winding it down here.
[1:48:22] In God's only provided place of worship,
[1:48:25] look, Enoch was the living word of God
[1:48:29] of his age.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; He was a prophet. A prophet is God's
[1:48:36] reflector. You see, now we're talking
[1:48:38] about Enoch being that capstone
[1:48:41] because this is the capstone now that
[1:48:43] we're talking about.
[1:48:44] He was the mystery.
[1:48:47] Enoch was displaying God
[1:48:51] in the full completion of this pyramid.
[1:48:56] And a prophet is God's reflector. How
[1:48:58] many knows that
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; the reflector doesn't reflect itself.
[1:49:02] The reflector isn't the reflection.
[1:49:05] There has to be something strike the
[1:49:07] reflector. The reflector to make it
[1:49:10] reflect. Amen.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; So, a prophet is a chosen vessel of God
[1:49:14] that cannot reflect nothing at all. But
[1:49:17] he's in direct line with that
[1:49:19] reflection.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; And what was his reflection? The prophet
[1:49:22] of Malachi 4, the prophet of Revelations
[1:49:25] 10:1-7. He was the reflection of the
[1:49:28] word of God that came down in 1963
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; to reflect the image of Christ, the
[1:49:36] word. See, nothing else can do it.
[1:49:40] And then he goes on next slide. He says,
[1:49:42] "And you are a reflector." That's the
[1:49:45] reason the prophet had to eat the book.
[1:49:48] That's the reason he had to eat the
[1:49:50] scroll. He had to reflect the word that
[1:49:53] was for the age for that age. You got
[1:49:56] it? Notice Enoch, God's perfect
[1:49:58] reflector in type. When God was through
[1:50:02] through with him, he just translated
[1:50:04] him, took him up. the mechanics that he
[1:50:07] had reflected become dynamics with the
[1:50:11] spirit and took him up. Amen. Listen,
[1:50:14] when this word becomes so real to you
[1:50:17] and the dynamics and the revelation and
[1:50:19] the stimulation OF THE WORD BY YOU
[1:50:21] RECOGNIZING who you are in the WORD OF
[1:50:24] GOD, WHAT YOUR PART IS IN THE WORD OF
[1:50:26] GOD, HOW YOU IDENTIFY WITH THIS WORD in
[1:50:28] this hour, you will have that dynamic
[1:50:32] energy burst that will in a moment, in
[1:50:34] the twinkling of an eye, translate you
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; into another dimension.
[1:50:41] Let the musicians come. This revelation
[1:50:45] is perfect faith. When you see yourself
[1:50:48] in the word, it becomes so real to you
[1:50:50] that you are united and dedicated to
[1:50:53] walk with God,
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; which is what? To walk with the word.
[1:50:57] And what does that do? It pleases God.
[1:51:00] Amen. Let's read the next scripture here
[1:51:02] in slide 23. By faith Enoch was
[1:51:06] translated that he should not see death
[1:51:08] and was not found because God had
[1:51:11] translated him.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; For before his translation he had this
[1:51:15] testimony
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; that he pleased God.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; But without faith it's impossible to
[1:51:22] please him.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe
[1:51:25] that he is.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A GOD THAT WAS.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TALKING about a God that's in
[1:51:31] the future. You got TO BELIEVE THAT GOD
[1:51:34] IS IN 2026 interested in your life, in
[1:51:38] your walk with him, that you THAT HE
[1:51:40] WANTS YOU TO DEDICATE yourself to him
[1:51:43] and walk with him so that your
[1:51:45] revelation becomes pleasing.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; THIS BRIDE has the ability to walk.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; How? Listen, you can't walk with God
[1:51:54] unless you're in agreement with God.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; You must be in agreement with the word.
[1:52:00] Somebody comes to you and says, "Baptism
[1:52:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:52:04] And you say, "No, I was baptized in the
[1:52:06] name of the Father, Son, and Holy
[1:52:08] Ghost." You're in disagreement with the
[1:52:10] word.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; If you're going to walk with God and
[1:52:15] please God, you got to walk with God.
[1:52:17] You got to walk with the word because
[1:52:19] God is the word.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enoch could only walk with God if
[1:52:23] they were in agreement. How can two walk
[1:52:26] together unless they both be agreed?
[1:52:28] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. You just
[1:52:31] look at, you know, when we read the
[1:52:32] scripture there, and Enoch walked with
[1:52:34] God and he was not
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; and God took him. I looked at the word
[1:52:39] took and I looked it up and and the in
[1:52:42] the Hebrew it's lack. And it and the and
[1:52:45] the basic definitions is to take to take
[1:52:48] in hand or receive. And then it goes and
[1:52:52] in marriage to take a woman in marriage
[1:52:54] snack, snatch or catch away. Hallelujah.
[1:52:58] Glory to God.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, he's going to He He took
[1:53:03] Enoch. He He took you.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; He's already took you out of the world.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; You don't realize that you've already
[1:53:10] been united.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; You've already come into that invisible
[1:53:14] union. You're already married to Christ.
[1:53:17] You're You're not foolish. The reason
[1:53:19] why he took you is because you were the
[1:53:21] the wise virgin. You heard the
[1:53:23] bridegroom call. Amen. And you and you
[1:53:26] received it. So, can you imagine that
[1:53:29] after the pyramid was built, everyone
[1:53:31] was looking and saying, "Hey, where's
[1:53:33] the capstone? Hey, Enoch, like today,
[1:53:36] where is the coming of the Lord?"
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Enoch was right there in
[1:53:42] their midst who had the full revelation
[1:53:45] of Christ.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; And he was right there in their midst,
[1:53:49] walking in the midst of the people.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; You see, this bride has Enoch's
[1:53:54] revelation. She has the capstone
[1:53:56] revelation.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; We're going to be looking a little
[1:53:58] deeper into that next week. Amen. And it
[1:54:01] was Enoch all the time. Now, today, the
[1:54:04] bride has the capstone in her. And she
[1:54:07] is reflecting the very image of the
[1:54:10] word, walking with the word. And in this
[1:54:13] final quote here, I want to read it in
[1:54:15] the exposition of the seven church ages
[1:54:18] in the the the Pergamian church age. He
[1:54:20] says the very same law applies to the
[1:54:24] church today. He's talking about the
[1:54:26] seed that's in there. Whatever seed
[1:54:28] started the church will come forth and
[1:54:31] be like the original seed because it is
[1:54:34] the same seed.
[1:54:37] In these last days, the true bride
[1:54:39] church, Christ's seed,
[1:54:42] will come to the headstone
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; and she will be the super church and a
[1:54:48] super race as she nears him.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; She will have the word in her. The word
[1:54:56] can only respond to the word. That's why
[1:54:59] no matter what somebody tries to pull
[1:55:01] you away from the word, somebody tries
[1:55:02] to give you a teaching on on new age
[1:55:04] movement or some kind of you know, oh
[1:55:07] Jesus was a master. He achieved a
[1:55:09] certain No, no. Jesus is the God of
[1:55:12] almighty universe. Period. The absolute
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the word. Before there was
[1:55:18] before there was even a word, he
[1:55:20] existed.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the He's the He's the
[1:55:23] self-existent one. But they but without
[1:55:26] that revelation because listen that is
[1:55:30] the key to the rapture.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Did you know that the key to the rapture
[1:55:36] is to know who the same spirit that
[1:55:38] raised Christ from the dead is and that
[1:55:41] it dwells in you and that it's
[1:55:43] quickening you. That is the revelation.
[1:55:46] Satan's revelation is is is the is the
[1:55:49] revelation of of mystery Babylon of
[1:55:51] organized religion. That's his That's
[1:55:54] his mystery. You know, Satan, the
[1:55:58] mystery of Babylon.
[1:56:00] Christ, the mystery of God.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You see, we need
[1:56:06] to recognize the seed that we're of. And
[1:56:09] he goes on and he says here in the in
[1:56:11] the next slide, he says, "They and the
[1:56:13] bride will be so much like him that they
[1:56:16] will even be in his very image."
[1:56:20] This is in order to be united with him.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Praise our God.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; They will be one. They will be the very
[1:56:28] manifestation of the word of the living
[1:56:31] God.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Denominations cannot [music]
[1:56:36] produce this.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; They're the wrong seed.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Their seed is based on the doctrines of
[1:56:43] men.
[1:56:45] They'll take a man's [music] teaching
[1:56:47] over the word.
[1:56:49] And what does it do? They produce their
[1:56:52] creeds, [music] their dogmas. They mixed
[1:56:56] it with the word. And what does it bring
[1:56:58] forth? Hybrid [music] religion.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:05] May the Lord quicken these thoughts
[1:57:09] [music] to our hearts. Bring us into a
[1:57:12] greater understanding of our placing in
[1:57:15] the word of God and how we represent
[1:57:18] that capstone age and how we [music] are
[1:57:22] the capstone in the midst of the people
[1:57:26] not realizing and [music] recognizing
[1:57:28] what God is doing.
[1:57:30] How many desires a closer walk with him?
[1:57:33] wants to walk with Jesus.
[1:57:36] [music] Amen. Let's sing that song. Just
[1:57:39] a closer walk.
