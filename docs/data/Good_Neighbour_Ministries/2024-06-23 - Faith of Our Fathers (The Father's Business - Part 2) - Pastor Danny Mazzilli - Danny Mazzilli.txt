not done it in the first place that's called Amazing Grace supernatural Grace that God has made of available to us in this day and in this hour praise God welcome everybody into the house of the Lord amen we certainly appreciate each and every one of you God bless you Saints you may all be seated thank you worship team we certainly have a diversified Ministry you may be seated for a minute yeah we certainly have um quite quite a Ministry we um we are very Multicultural and in every culture you've got many different ways of worship different ways of prayer you hear Brother Desmond the way he prays and he's yelling and praising God and you know and then you get the song leader who's singing differently and you know you got one song leader this way another one that way one screaming one praising God one you just you know like but God hides in it all that's what makes you know that's what makes this word so real to the Sons and Daughters of God because they're not looking looking at that they're listening for the word they're paying attention to what is the present stage of the ministry of Jesus Christ in this hour and what is the Lord doing right now where is he right now what's he concerned about in my life how's he dealing with me personally you know that's the thing this is Ephesians 4 Ministry Ephesians 4 Ministry is all about the perfecting of the Saints and you're going to see saints that when the word comes to perfect some are going to say I'm going to defect because they can't handle the perfect right and this is the thing that we got to realize that listen don't be looking for big numbers don't be looking for uh you know that all listen when Jesus was here on the earth he was just a small little flock when he came into when he came on the scene and he came into his public Ministry it got it got to isn't that the son of Joseph the Carpenter and what's he doing making himself something saying things that that are different and how many were actually following him there was more that we rejecting him that than we're following him and he was the word amen praise God so uh we we certainly want to remember brother Tim beers this morning he's ministering in petroia um brother Edison um certainly appre appreciates the relief that he receives there through brother Tim um him and brother Mark Andre they're the two ministers there in Petrolia and um they both work full-time you know and they both have busy schedules and so when you know when it comes to ministering the word of God uh you know ministers uh you know they they if they're really called ministers they take it serious and they realize that you know what I'm exhausted I can't do this this week I've been you know I'm just overworked and so forth I need I need some help amen and I thank God that we've got a ministry here that not only helps here but can help by going out amen praise God so we're very blessed I feel very very privileged and honored and I know Pastor Simon really appreciated the the the the ministers that were here in our ministry that were able ministers that they could stand in the post of Duty and allow the Holy Spirit to get them out of the way so that he could have his way amen and this is what we're looking for and this is what we certainly do appreciate and so um uh we're also blessed you know to um to have the Lord um you know adding to the church um we we were contacted uh over the week you know there's people that are that are moving in from different countries um we had a young couple that um I don't know if they're going to be here today they didn't uh they mention mention they may be here today but um they're uh from The Cameroon all right and uh they plan on uh you know coming into the service they were very excited to know that we have a church here locally um and so we give God the glory for that and uh we certainly welcome them and the other sister that was with us here last week um she lives close by and the Lord uh certainly did something wonderful for her in finding this particular Ministry history and so we thank God for that and when they do come we'll give them an opportunity to share some of their testimony on how they found us by the grace of God Amen praise God remember it's the Lord that adds to the church and when the Lord adds to the church they're genuine they'll come in they'll get fed by the word of God they will connect with the word not so much they'll connect with the people of course and they'll and they'll they'll realize that they're getting fed through the ministry but it's connecting with him in in his provided place of worship amen for their particular lives at this particular time and so praise God for that um so let's go to the word this morning I'm I'm excited about the word this morning I'm always excited about the word amen especially when inspiration starts to fall and starts to come and and then I I get excited because I know that this is something that the Lord wants the people to have and so uh you know we're just conduits as ministers and we're just going to put ourselves aside today we're going to let him have his way let's all stand and let's read the word of God praise God Amen from the beginning and so we're going to continue continue um along the same path that we started last week we were talking about faith of the fathers you know I know it was a Father's day last week but last week's message it's a Father's Day message every week because we're talking about the great father who if we follow him and we're about his business we become good Fathers also we become good stewards of the word of God and then we can say like Jesus we're about the father's business amen and so that's what we want to continue on this week um we're going to go to part two of uh the father's business and so let's read the scripture our first scripture again is from St Luke chapter 2 verse 49 and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me was not ye not that I must be about my father's business let us pray father what a privilege and what an honor it is Lord to be a part of your economy and not only that but a part of your your business Lord you have a a business here on Earth that that Lord that you started from before the foundations of the world and here we are today Lord and we're we're a part of that business and by us seeing that we're a part of that business it gives us perfect Faith to recognize Who We Are and who you are and that is real true Christianity in this hour knowing you and knowing who we are Lord may your spirit take control now speak to each and every one of our hearts Lord you know what we have need of those that are online that are listening in we certainly welcome them and we ask that your spirit will go and and ride the word of God as it's going forth into their hearts into their into their needs into their lives into their homes and meet those needs and may they know you in the power of your Resurrection we pray in Jesus name and remember brother Tim this morning Lord as he's ministering your word move him aside and let them be a blessing to your people in Jesus name amen praise God and so you know um it's a wonderful thing to know that we are a part of God's business and just like Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth even at 12 years old he realized that he was not just an ordinary person he wasn't just an ordinary child he was somebody that was uh that God had intervened in his life and that he was actually the word for his day and that he had to come into the into the uh season of where he would have to be about the father's business and until you come into a realization that you're not just a human being here on Earth that belongs as a member to some church organization or don't even belong to a church and you're here on Earth and you've got no purpose you've got no vision you've got no Clarity of why you're here you're dealing with all kinds of circumstances in your life and you know you got heartaches you got breakups you got family problems you got Financial issues you got all kinds of things and you know so many people I was telling my wife this morning so many people are looking to others for for explanation and they want to go to psychiatrist they want to go to to self-help and they want to they want to go every other place but they don't want to go to the Creator himself who's the one that Jesus said you're you're heavy ladened you're you're burdened you got so many situations in your life come unto me I will give you rest and you know it puzzles me why somebody wouldn't allow that to be their first choice to give give God the opportunity the Lord Jesus an opportunity to really liberate you and set you free from the burdens and the and the cares of this life amen and so when we come into that place it certainly changes our attitude it changes our Outlook and it puts us into business with Jesus Christ himself and then we start to say hey I must be about my father's business everything I do is my father's business everything that I that I work at uh uh my my work my my marriage my my relationships uh all everything that I do if I place it first as Jesus Christ first in my life and make his business first then everything else is going to follow naturally and I'm going to fall right into his plan his desire his will and his purpose for my life amen praise God and so um let's go to the next scripture I believe the you know um we we can draw here from this scripture here in the book of Acts uh chapter 1: 6 to8 let's read it and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem now this is where Jesus appears to the disciples and the apostles all right after he had risen but wait for the promise of the father he says which sayith he ye have heard of me for truly John for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence this still pertains to this day and this hour because a lot of people need to receive the Holy Ghost okay when they therefore were caught together were come together they asked of him saying Lord wil thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power so we know that he's got a plan he's got a plan and we need to come into that plan the father's plan he says here he says but ye shall receive power after note here after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you a lot of people say oh I got the Holy Ghost I went to church I spoke in tongues I got anointed I started to shout and scream I got baptized as a baby I was baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost I was blessed by the Trinity oh the Virgin Mary she she appeared to me in a dream they ain't got the Holy Ghost yet they just don't know it but after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and then ye shall be Witnesses un me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the utter most parts of this earth the earth and this is where we are right now and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight praise God man that just reminds me of the cloud that brought him here in 1963 in the same way that you shall see him go you shall see him come and I believe that that he has come now with this message that burns within the heart of the True Church of Jesus Christ in this day and in this hour the true Christian Church people ask me all the time Danny what do you believe I said read the book of Acts if you read the book of Acts you will see that it is not the Acts of the Apostles but it is actually the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles fulfilling the word of God and declaring and interpreting his word for this day and we are a continuation of that church everything you saw them do in the book of Acts we do it today we have the Lord's Supper we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ just like they did back on the day of Pentecost when 3,000 were added to the church we do it the same way we're the same church we're anointed by the same holy spirit that was given back on the day of Pentecost and it's available here today amen praise God and so that same spirit is about the father's business because you know what the father's business has always been Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever back in the mind of God remember he wanted to express himself as a father and he had a plan and that same plan has been unveiling itself unfolding itself we're going to be looking at it a little more here as we get into this message and so it's all about the word business somebody say to you what business are you in I'm in the word business business I'm in the I'm in I'm in the business of declaring the word of God for this day Christianity you want to see real Christians then you got to look at the word of God and if the word of God is Not mirroring that that that Christian experience you need to go back and check because the word will always declare because remember the holy ghost that he says I'll send you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost Jesus said himself and he will guide you into all truth which is the word of God and so when you're looking at the word and you see baptism in the name of Jesus Christ you're saying amen because the same holy ghost that was in me led me right to the water I believed and was baptized like Jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved okay not he that that the the the the parents decided to sprinkle water on him or or the priest decided to baptize him into titles of father son Holy Ghost you might as well baptize into titles of the of the the the the lily of the valley or the like what's the difference why are you baptizing in the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost do you see what I mean so it's all back to the word it's the that's what you're going to hear here amen praise God and so we read the scripture on Malachi 4 verse 5-6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming and the great and before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse you see it's all about the father's business that's what we're the heart of the fathers back to the children and then now here we are we're the children of the many fathers that have been our fathers the the prophets of old father Abraham the same Faith coming down through each dispensation through each Church age it was the same spirit of God it was the it was the father's Spirit which is Christ which is Elohim which is the one and only true God the self-existent one it's always been him declaring himself so here let me read a quote um here it kind of you know gives us a a platform to to move from here and and here brother Braham speak in 1963 in Christ the my of God revealed he says he has shown or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible yes if you want to see Jesus Christ you can start right from the book of re Revelations from the first very first word that was in the beginning God hallelujah it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's all about him so watch he says here therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible listen carefully here people all the all the acts of the of the Believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and with God's help well you'll see it right here this this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what's being to know this and then to try to bring it to the people see and then you don't I haven't went into details to try to explain it as God has revealed it to me it you know first of all what we're talking about here is God has to reveal it to you that his plan is to dwell in you the whole thing is about Jesus Christ in different stages of his own personal Ministry God wanting to express himself but in a many membered form so that he could have Fellowship because he was the self-existent one but then his thoughts were were so uh him that he could he could express himself into many different forms and yet still be God and allow them to communicate one with the other I know it sounds you know like it's it's it's almost a paradox but this this is a revelation this is something that that that brother brandham says you know I I've received it in such a way that that it's hard to explain it it's not something that you can explain you must experience it and that's why a lot of people you know they'll take that quote and they'll just place it just on brother brandham and that it's just him experiencing that and it's just him the one that's got it him the one that's that that can only declare it and that's why today you hear them say press press play and Obey don't go anywhere else they want to leave Jesus Christ out of this they don't realize that that's what they're doing when they do that yes he was God's Prophet yes he was God's messenger and yes he fulfilled Malachi 4:5 Revelations 107 but the voice was always the voice of God that's why he he made sure it was named the voice of God to leave it as a testimony in case they started to get mixed up in the last days because remember it would become so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect if that's the key word it's not possible you'll never deceive the elect because the elect have Jesus Christ in them and they'll never go against their own word that's why you'll never hear me uh say false prophet what he said wasn't the truth that what he said was not thus you'll never hear me say that because I know by Revelation what he said thus sayeth the Lord was the voice of God was the truth and we are the manifestation of that word in this day and in this hour fulfilling the the the the Ephesians Ministry of Ephesians chapter 4 where God now has put and placed himself into a five-fold Ministry Christ in the present stage of his ministry having fellowship with his children every Sunday every service every prayer meeting every time you listen to the tapes Oh you mean God can speak to me while I of course he can but he speaks to you from here too and you are not to just place it in one place the minute you do that you have isolated yourself you've placed yourself as a as a a lamb and the wolves are looking for lamb to eat they love it when Lambs go off on their own and they start declaring their own interpretation on the word of God don't do it you need to find your pastor who is your Shepherd you need to come under your pastor under that Shepherd under his leadership amen a lot of people still having trouble with that there's people they still have trouble calling me Pastor I don't care that's their problem that's not my problem they're going to have to come to a place where they'll realize that it's not Pastor [Laughter] Dany but it's Christ in the present stage of his ministry wanting to feed his sheep and my sheep hear my voice no other voice will they follow they don't realize they just got a bit of a rebellious Spirit still holding back on their lives and still they they still don't want to let go they don't want to let go of Pastor Simon they they they they think that oh Pastor Simon he was the one he was the one he never was the one Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is the one he's the one he's the one that I followed he's the voice that I heard that give me the birth that delivered me from from the sickness and the the addiction and everything that was in my life it's not man it's God it's always been God and if I stop listening for that voice and want to hear that voice that speaks to my heart that delivers me in the in the time of my need I don't want to be having to rush to a tape and and and and try to listen in on a prayer line to see if I can can I can hear something that that relates to my situation and and then oh there it is they're taking tapes where brother Brandon married somebody and they'll and they'll do a ceremony with brother brandom purposely saying oh I got married by the prophet nonsense but can God speak to you through those tapes it's happened to me where he spoke lip to ear through the prophet's voice in a prayer line and showed me and revealed to me things that there was no way the timing and the and the the that moment and that was God and I was delivered because it was God but did I make it the absolute now where the only way that I hear I hear testimonies you know sometimes and then at the end of the testimony all they declare is that it's because they listen to that tape nonsense you need to listen for the voice of God and he can speak to you through a mule yeah if he wants to speak to you through a mule what an hour Saints we're talking about the father's business this morning and I love it praise God let's go to the next slide St sorry Hebrews 4:14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession now I want you to notice here in the scripture that we read in in Acts okay I highlighted something here and I want to mention it ye shall be Witnesses we Are Witnesses of the father's business bu we're talking on that and when you look at the word witness okay when you translate that word from the Greek translation it's Martis m a r t s in Greek and when you look at the actual meaning okay they've got a few different breakdowns I got it right from the internet this morning Nas word you know uh definition and it says a witness in a legal sense an historical sense and one who is a spectator of anything of a contest in an ethical sense now listen this is what caught my attention those who after his example after your own example of the way you live and what you profess have proved the strength and genuiness of their faith of your faith in Jesus Christ by undergoing a violent death in other words they have come so much into the Revelation and understanding of God's word and and and in the power of his resurrection that there are so much that nobody can tell me I am not a witness of the supernatural God I could give you testimony after testimony of the supernatural I witnessed it and I was a part of it and nobody can ever take that out of me and if they took me to a place where they said that you've got to deny that that happened to you or we're going to remove your head I'd say start from this side it wouldn't even glitch because a true son or daughter of God does not fear death that's why if you go back and study the Dark Ages and the Christians of the Dark Ages they were burned alive they were cut into pieces they were listen there was atrocities that were done to them that I don't even want to mention but they had the anointing on their lives to withstand that and were able to go through it and today this word still lives because you can never kill Christ you might take the vessel but the spirit moves on hallelujah praise God and that's why a True Believer has no fear and this this really caught my attention that was the the definition that they came up with in in the you know when they when they when they looked at the definition of the translation from the Greek they brought it back to the word of God and so here now we need to realize that our profession and what we speak and what we give as witness when it's really a genuine birth where something has truly taken place you become a witness that when you profess you've got the high priest right there who's standing right behind his word and backing his word amen because Jesus the son of God let us hold fast fast because of him being our high priest he's the one that's standing there with us and so watch brother Braham speaking here he says now remember every Redemptive blessing has already been purchased the price is paid there is only one way that you'll ever be able to receive it is to believe it and to accept it he's the high priest of our confession the Hebrews there that Hebrews letter says he's the high priest of our profession to profess and to confess is the same thing of course so we he's the high priest of our confession therefore he cannot do anything for us now this is important until first we confess that he has done it it's a finished work everything you're healing it's a finished work it's just a matter of what in his time he's going to do it you know your your your circumstances that he said I'll provide all your needs you might be in a situation you might find yourself in a in a very rough condition right now financially but listen if you stand on the word and you profess and confess he's Jehovah Gyra he's Jehovah Gyra he's going to provide I'm going to do my part by going into the house of the Lord I'm going to going to do my part if I receive a dollar I'm bringing 10 cents and I'm going to drop it in the bucket it's as simple as that because he's still Jehovah Gyra it has nothing to do with with with what what I have to do no no no no listen here he says and then when we confess it he's the high priest a mediator to go to work on that and make it right so we pray trusting in God today tonight in his kindness and mercy that he will give to us his abundance of Grace amen and now remember you must accept it and that's why a lot of people you know you go to them with the word you tell them about proper baptism you tell them about how to receive the Holy Spirit how to how to how to receive the gift of of of life and they reject it by saying no I had I got baptized when I was a baby I go to this church I believe this one I watch this guy on television and I send my money there I don't want it no you just want my money we don't need anybody's money we need God's honey Sweetness in our lives glory to God and when that comes everything else follows amen praise God so we've got a pro listen Proverbs 18: 211 death and life are in the power of the tongue you you know people you you run into people how's it going terrible oh well I guess your day is not going to go so well not bad people say to me oh I go how you doing I go not bad I I said so bad but not too bad how about saying things are good things are getting better things are improving in my life because you have the power of the spoken word in you and you got to be careful the enem wants to use you in the negative way he wants to turn your your your your your your positives into a negative everybody's always looking at at the weather and then you know and the minute that there's any rain coming oh it's going to rain but the last 17 days there was Sunshine heat I mean like you know you could have done so many different things but the minute there's one oh the rain I I love the rain when it comes because it Waters everything makes everything look beautiful and Lush and green I look out in my backyard my grass is looking so good and trees are looking nice and Lush getting the rain you know when it needs it God is just providing praise God I love it you see it's all about your attitude and your attitude needs to profess the right things because he says here in Proverbs and they shall love it and shall eat the fruit thereof wow I love that I read it again death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof and that can work for the black dog or the white dog CU sometimes you can eat some sour fruit glory to God Romans chapter 5 go to the next slide it says here in Romans chapter 5 or Romans chapter 10 sorry slide number five verses 8 to to 12 but what what saith it the word is NY even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith the word of Revelation if God has revealed to you by by his stripes you're healed if he's revealed that to you then it's then it's the faith that's in your heart and that's what's going to come out and that's what's going to be confessed and that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess there it is with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved you see how salvation comes it doesn't come people say oh you just got to confess Jesus Christ as your savior that's all you got to do just just come on come on just confess it I've I've seen people going on the streets you know trying to get you know help people on the streets and just just say no just just come on come here come here come here just confess it sin this say say it after me that's not going to do it that might be a start but they need to come to a place where they lay prostate before him and they they become naked in his presence and realize that they need this Supernatural God to do more than just because they've spoken out before they've they've cried out to God everybody cries out to God when in a time of emergency oh God help me here you know but not not but they don't want to go to God and scream out and say Glory Hallelujah praise our God but when a time of emergency comes they oh God why did this happened to me and they want to curse God but no you need to have it all lined up properly so that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus the Lord meaning that you've made him Lord over your life and Shall Believe in your heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved there it is again for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation and we carry the word of Salvation within us when we confess it and that's why our business and the father's business is salvation is that when we testify and when we give testimony of what God has done in our lives it can actually bring Salvation into other people's lives that's how I received it that's how you received it for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed aren't you glad of that glory to God Amen praise God forever more and so um here listen to brother Bram he says notice now when Jesus was here on Earth he made the sacrifice for healing and for salvation everything was done do you believe that Jesus could not come today tonight and save you he's already done it the sin question was settled he is the Lamb of God that took and take a take away look look took away the sins of the world he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed in past tense he says no matter how much you would scream out how much you would scream out that wouldn't do a bit of good until you accept it and he is the high priest sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high to make intercession on our profession see he's he's making intercession on our profession a lot of people want to go to other intercessors there is no there is no other intercessors by the way there's only one intercessor and the Bible says very clearly it's Jesus Christ there is no other intercessor I don't care if you go to the Virgin Mary I don't care if you go to St Christopher or you go to St Joseph or you go to St Peter or whoever you want to go to they can never intercede for you ever there's no scripture for it nowhere in the Bible I listen God bless you for your your sincere desire to to to you know to go to the Virgin Mary to go to these intercessors but you're sincerely wrong and you need to come back to the word of God and know that he the high priest Jesus Christ went to the Cross he's the one that died for your sins he's the one that died for your healing he's the one that died for your salvation nobody else and so that's the only way we come to True salvation amen praise God and so no matter how much you can scream you've got to accept it and profess it see that's correct same way by healing he says the same Revelation comes by healing feeling everything needs to be professed and recognized by the grace of God let's go to the next scripture we're moving along just fine here this morning I got some things I want to uh you know the Lord just blessed me with all of this and I just want to unveil I just want to just get it off of me and I believe that that uh somebody's going to receive something out of it in Revelations chapter 10 um sorry let me just yeah Revelation 10: 8-1 11 very familiar scripture you know it's interesting back in 1995 this Revelation struck my heart and I looked back and and it was back then that I got my first email address for as a Son of God you know and my first email address was rev 1011 and it's still to this day I've got rev 1011 at Hotmail I've got rev 1011 at gmail nobody else can have it because it's a revelation that God gave to me became so real when that when I listened I I was at a service and that scripture came out and it just jumped out of the pages it struck my heart and I said my God and every time I read it every time I see it it just it it makes the reality of this message and the day that we're living in more real to me he says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth now remember brother brandham fulfilled Revelations 10 1-7 he never ever went to Revelations 108 go ahead search it you will not see that he ever went there because it didn't pertain to him pertain to you and me and he says take that book because now the mighty Angels come down he's open the book The Seals have been open the word has been open and now it's available to you the next stage of the ministry brother brandham had to decrease so that Christ could come on the scene and fulfill through Ephesians chapter 4 the ministry for this hour which was Christ in his bride this is the bride age this is the time for the bride to manifest the word speak the word prophesy so this is us that he's talking to he says take that book take that open book as a matter of fact and he said take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey oh you know when when when when it's sweet in your mouth it just you just want to say How Sweet It Is oh this is sweet honey honey this is sweet my wife buys good honey honey this is Sweet Honey Hallelujah you see you just you you want to speak that's why you got you got to get everything out of there sure when the word has to be lived when you take it in it's not easy it's going to be bitter in your belly it's going to have you're going to have to bear the reproach of your friends you know you're oh you're too you're you're too zealous for this word Danny you know you get too excited relax man relax they're going to realize why I was so excited one day you can never get over excited about this word I'm naturally excited as it is I'm a little bit you know overzealous and stuff like that God made me that way I can't help it sometimes I you know but anyway it's the way I am but God God this word is so real to me and I I love it and he says now take that book eat it sweet as honey and as soon as it I had eaten it it was in my belly it was bitter because when it became a reality it just man oh man are you kidding me you mean you've revealed this revelation of of God in this hour what you're doing right now to me personally and you want to use me you want to you want to place me in the body of Christ he wants to place you he wants to use you you're not just called to be a church pew member here you're you're a member in the house of of of Good Neighbor Ministries because you're a part of the body of Jesus Christ and you will find your rightful position in the body if God has you a part of this body if you're not you're not going to stay you're not going to be here long don't worry about it so you won't have to do any work you won't have to do anything but if God has placed you he'll put such Revelation on your heart and and the word of God will become so real to you right here from this ministry that you won't want to go anywhere else you'll just want to feed and you'll want to do whatever you can you'll want to be in the in in your position position you'll want to do what God wants you to do you'll want to give your tithes you'll want to give your offerings because you've come into contact with the Living Word and the word for this day and this hour and it changes your whole life all of a sudden now you've got a future that's clear and you know it you know you're right where you're supposed to be you're right in that perfect place where when that Rapture takes place you'll be in your rightful position you're not going to be a goat that's going from this church to that church to this one to this guy to that one listening to this listening to you need to settle down and you need to be where God is feeding you and giving you some Revelation to do and to act on the word and that's how you'll know that his spirit is in you because it'll start to do the things that he does it'll start to express and edify the body of Christ like the B like the Bible says in Corinthians that the body nourisheth itself okay if you're truly member of of of the of the ministry and this local body you will edify the body you will not de edify the body you will not be a sore that never seems to heal and constantly needs to be dealt with and dressed and constantly needs to be oh oh you know we got to Pat it and and and deal with it and what's that it's either you haven't fully surrendered or you need to find somewhere else to wor worship because you're not going to do us any good here if you're in constant you know uh Rebellion you you don't want to come under subjection to the word come on Saints you know wherever you are if you're a part of God's local economy and his body the Bible says you will edify the body of Christ your ministry will edify your fellowship will edify it will not separate it will not bring division it will not have a spirit of Gossip praise God Hallelujah this is preaching I can't help it but this is where it all starts Saints we got to we got to come under the the real true leadership of God's word if we want that word to have an effect and we want to see the supernatural in our lives and so here now this the reason I'm bringing this he says here and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings you and me have a testimony you look at the word prophecy prophesy it means to give testimony it was look here he says right here in the in the translation okay actually I'm not going to go there just yet because it's going to be the next scripture but we need to understand that God has placed us into this ministry of Revelations 108 to 11 and then one thing that I noticed just an observation of course go back to the previous scripture Romans 108 to2 profession confession and here we are in Revelations 108 to 11 I'm just saying what I'm a little superstitious no I'm saying God is making it clear that we can draw from his word by Revelation things that he is doing to vindicate and confirm his word over and over and over again and if he brings it to your attention it's because he wants you to know about it he wants you to see what it is that he's doing now let's go to the next scripture and see how powerful this is and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels listen we're we're we're in Warfare Saints you need to know that you need to realize that that's why it's so hard to come into the house of the Lord to get into your position to you know to to be a blessing in the body to give you financially to the ministry to you know to do all those things to give of your time it's a fight there's a constant battle for your time one minute the phone's pulling you here and and then they're pulling you there and then this situation arises it's all distractions to get you away from the father's business business but God wants you to get focused and he says here listen yes he he knows you're in a fight but he's there if you can profess and confess he's the one that's there fighting your battles for you I'm I'm witnessing that and I'm I was telling my wife I said Jen I'm praising God all the time since I came into this office the like I know it's fearful and and and it's been and and it's not easy and and it's it's a great battle but I can tell you I've never seen the Lord raise a standard around my life like he has done in the last 6 months while I've been in this position I know it's got to be the the the the prayers of the Saints whatever it is I give God all the glory for it because when the battles come and the situations come and I and I get into a place where I just bow my head and I don't know and I don't understand and then something takes place God does something and I see the Supernatural and I Rejoice I'm experiencing this profession and this confession I've taken my position I am professing it I accept it I'm allowing the Holy Spirit to place me as the pastor of Good Neighbor Ministries and I believe if God shows you clearly that I am your pastor that you will benefit through this ministry by the word of God not because of brother Dany or Pastor Dany but because you have come into the revelation of Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry and allow him to do in your life what what he wants to do and you will see the supernatural you will witness the supernatural you will experience things that you never thought were possible you'll get job raises you'll get financial blessings you'll get healings you'll get uh relationship situations dealt with and healed God will do all of those things I'm witnessing it I'm experiencing it and it's because I believe it and I confess it with my mouth praise God forever more and so here now he's saying you listen there's a battle and he and and and listen the Angel Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil who was the serpent back in the Garden of Eden that went and spoke to Eve it was the devil right there it's just clear that old serpent it's right there Genesis three called the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world you can't go over that the whole world deception if if there's ever been a time where the whole religious world and the whole global economy and everything else is under under deception it's right now Israel is is right in the place where she's supposed to be under the conditions and the circumstances that she's supposed to be right now because the world is fulfilling that prophecy that we just read in in Revelations 108 to to 11 even the kings are going to hear this prophecy that's why he says Thou must prophesy again before many nations this word has gone out Nationwide it's gone to Kings it's gone to every single individual in power if they don't if they reject it that's that's their problem but this word will not fail heavens and earth will pass away but this word is going to it's not going to fail it's going to be fulfilled amen praise God and that's why this this whole thing is is is because deception is all over the world and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is salvation come CU that's when Christ came this is where salvation was made available and that's why there is no other way to be saved but through Jesus Christ and that's why we always bring that right back you got to come back to the word you got to come God's provided way and he says here now is Salva now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ what's he talking about his Anointed The Power power of His anointed remember Christ in you my my my I don't want to get ahead of myself you see the his anointed for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and watch now and by the word of their testimony what do you testim what word are you declaring what business are you in are you in the father's business because if you're in the father's business then you're declaring the father's word am you ever try to go and join a company go right up the guy want to see the president I'm going to tell you how to run this company before he even says the next word there's two guys throwing them right out you're not going to tell the president how how to run his company when he's been running it since before the foundations of the world so don't come to me and give me your interpretation on baptism your interpretation on the Trinity your interpretation on on uh you know uh the uh intercession of the Saints don't I don't want to hear it show me in the word of God where it exists show me that you can back it by God's word and by the revelation of God's word and then I'll believe it because I can never by the Holy Ghost In Me deny that word and when somebody denies the word and says I got the Holy Ghost something's wrong it's as simple as that by the word of their testimony that's how they overcame and that's how you're going to overcome and they loved not their lives unto death and that's what we were talking about that when you come to a place where you believe the word to the point where where you're you're not afraid of of any anything you're going to stand right there that's what he's talking about there that that they loved not their lives unto death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time his time is short and he knows it and that's why this world is not going to get any better I'm not being the bearer bad news I'm just telling you what prophecy through the scripture is saying and what is going to come to this earth it's not going to get any better there's going to be some tribula tribulation times that are going to strike the Earth you got to know where you stand and who you are in the word of God but when you look at the word testimony now okay and we're going to let me see here yeah we're defin definitely not going to finish today but we're going to continue next week because it's it's good when you look at testimony and you look at the Greek translation the word marua m a r t r i a matura kind of like maturity you know maturity but anyways a testifying it's it's it's testimony record report the office uh uh committed to the prophets of testifying concerning future events that's that's the definition a testifying the office committed to the prophets of testifying concerning future events what one testifies testimony and so Revelations 108 thou must prophesy again we're giving testimony of what God is doing now it's not so much repeating everything that God did oh God sent a prophet God said all people want to do is they want to go and give people the tracks of brother branam and it's good but you got to give it to them by Revelation you got to give it to them with with the right understanding so that you can lead them in the right way because like I told you I came to this message and it wasn't until nine months later after I was delivered from from the sickness from the addiction of my life from the things answering and delivering me and giving me an experience with God that I came to realize that God had sent a prophet so it wasn't that that but the minute that the Holy Ghost came it had to lead me to the word and when the word became alive to me Malachi 4:5 became alive Revelations 10 1-7 became alive brother bram's Ministry became alive I saw how it actually fit perfectly into the restoration of the word by looking at even the Natural History of the Reformation of Luther Wesley Pentecost and William brandham it's just that the world doesn't want to you know most of the world they don't want to research and go in and see clearly how William branham's Ministry was the Fulfillment of these scriptures to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and that's the business that we're in today and so we're giving our testimony and our testimony becomes powerful when somebody can receive it because it's the word for this hour amen praise God and so the prophecy that calls out the bride is what we contain our prophecy and the word that's in US it doesn't call nominal Christians that's why they can't respond to it that's why you'll talk to them about the word you'll talk tell them about the word and then they'll just well that's nice good to see you nice meeting you see you later and you got to say see you later hope to meet you for coffee again sometime whatever you got because my sheep hear my voice but you go and let somebody that's walking by and they hear something and catches their attention I remember when I was at brother Gabriel's and I believe brother Tim was there and there was a couple of other believers were there at that time visiting brother Gabriel they give testimony of that because they remember seeing me come in with this wild boy running around and I remember hearing them saying God bless you God bless you just just remembered it did it did it do anything no but but now I realize the word was in the place the word was present and anybody that's a word carrier becomes a word giver and that's why Apollo's planted but God Waters it you see what I mean the word's got to get watered by the spirit that's why you could read every single track of William brandham and you become so much a parrot and so much a person that can quote every single quote everything he said perfectly but without the spirit you're only a parrot you're not a son or a daughter of God I'm not being disrespectful but I'm just telling you the way it is there's got to be an Awakening in the bride because right now this there's a great falling away that's taking place and deception is is is at the highest level now the highest level that it would deceive even the very elect well the very elect are not stuck in Catholic churches and and Pentecostal churches they're right in the ranks of the message that's where the very elect are and that's where the foolish virgin is and there's we're the ones that are going to reject this word that when we bring it out in this way and and we we just tell it plain the way it is and and they don't want to they don't want to they don't want to hear it that way they think that we're off the word fine what are you going to do let them go on but we go on the word will progress and take us listen to brother Bram he says these men why why was they called and was put in this condition now think these Pharisees by Jesus said in vain you worship me worship Him genuine worship true worship from their hearts you in vain you worship me why teaching for Doctrine their tradition of man therefore you make the Commandments of God of no effect to the people here he was rebuking the people for the the very same things they're taking just the Traditions they're just you only say what the prophet said you only say what the prophet said you only listen to the tapes you don't need to be under a minister no no no no no no see they made the word of God and the Commandments of God the word of God not the word of man the word of God of none effect and all of a sudden it it it I and if I taught you a Methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bright time he says if if Moses taught the message of Noah it would it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's give for that seed see it won't grow under any other condition it must be the condition that grows it and the condition is the word for this hour and Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry I'm gonna I'm gonna end with this quote and then we're gonna come back next week we're GNA finish let the musicians come in birth pains brother speaks here he says the word must deliver the word bride church I'm going to repeat that the word must deliver the word bride church not all the other churches out there that's why don't think that they're going to accept this message you could go into a whole church of Pentecostals and preach this message and at the end of the day they would just say thank you for coming brother have a nice life or you could go somewhere where I hear it's happened where they go into churches in Africa we've had testimonies where they'll go in it's a Pentecostal church and they'll come in with the word of God that I've been preaching here this morning under the anointing of the spirit of God and the spirit of God falls into the hearts of the people and the whole church gets converted and rejoices and and and just can't believe that they've come into this revelation of what God is doing in this day and in this hour but he says here the word must deliver the word bride church the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for Christ remember the church comes out of the church World them that fell asleep in all ages will make up that bride and come out on the word that they come out on like from your feet coming to your head she gets greater and the more you have to have and so forth as the body grows up so does the body of Christ grow up and then finally the head will come to it like it did in 1963 and the head of it will now if we notice cause it's all linked to the head the head does the turning and the pulling and in 1963 when that Supernatural cloud came down in the opening of those Seven Seals it was to release the Mysteries that were under those Seven Seals and under that seventh seal there were names and when that seal opened up names started to get called it all started right then there was a dispensational change it was coming into the final stages of the Gentile age coming to an end and God is calling the last few we will continue this next week and it's just going to get better and better let's pray father we're so grateful for your goodness Your Grace your leadership your anointing this morning Lord I just so appreciate father it just brings Clarity to your word and makes it simple father and Lord we're just asking you to come and continue let these thoughts and these scriptures and quotes that have gone out this morning let it stir into the hearts of the people may they just search the scriptures may it cause them to to just go a little deeper and say you know what I'm I'm going
