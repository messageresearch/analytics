Let the earth be moved. The Lord is great in Zion, and he is high above all the people. Let them praise thy great and terrible name, for it is holy. The king's strength also loveth judgment. Thou dost establish equity. Thou executionest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his foottool, for he is holy. Moses and Aaron amongst his priests and Samuel among them that called upon his name. They called upon the Lord and he answered them. He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar that kept his testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them. Thou answerest them, oh Lord our God. Thou was the God that forgavest them, though thou tookst vengeance of their inventions. Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy hill, for the Lord our God is holy. Amen.

I'll praise him for his love surrounds me like a sea. I'll praise the name of Jesus. Lift up the name [Music] for the name of Jesus lifted me. Praise God. You realize you had to be lifted. Amen. Every single one of us had to be lifted. So, praise the Lord for lifting us up. Amen. Jesus Messiah, [Music] the name above all names.

Well, as I travel through this pilgrim land, there is a friend who walks with me. He leads me safely through the sinking sand. And it is the Christ of Calary. And this would be my prayer, dear Lord, each day to help me do the best I can. For I need thy light to guide me day and night. Blessed Jesus, glory. Come on, somebody. Oh yes, Jesus, hold my hand.

Welcome everybody into the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. Glory to God. We're so glad to be here this morning. I feel an atmosphere in this place. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, praise God. I'll tell you, you know, you had to break through a little bit of the battle to get here and the enemy tried to raise up a storm, but you know what? He's just a bluff anyway. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God wants his sons and daughters to gather. He makes a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm grateful. And you should pat yourself on the back this morning that you you press through. Now, there's some saints that are like two hours away, okay? They called and they let me know they wouldn't be here and stuff like that. And I said, "Absolutely." I said, you know, the weather's going to kind of pick up again maybe and you know, they're further away. And so they they said, uh, it'd be safer. And I said, absolutely. So, praise God. But, uh, we're so happy that that you all could make it here this morning. And, uh, I'm, uh, I'm especially blessed this morning to have my nephew, uh, Christian Mazili with us this morning. I was so uh blessed to hear from him a couple of weeks ago and sent me a text message and he says uh you know I listened to the message and uh you know I was blessed and you know I said wow I said wonderful wonderful I'm so happy to hear that uh Christian is my my brother Lenny a lot of you know my brother Len um his eldest son and uh you know Christian um you know he was uh uh in modeling for many years. Okay. He had a like a like a a real career. You know, I'd go to the malls. I'd be at like the big malls at Square One and, you know, downtown and I'd see these huge billboards of my nephew, you know, and and in these different stores and, you know, I'd walk in there and I'd see the people at the desk and, you know, young ladies. I go, "That's my nephew." They go, "What? Can can you give me his number?" I said, "No." And then, you know, a few years ago, probably five, six years ago, I heard that Christian was uh um moving into the uh farming, you know, and and I said, "Wow, that's that's an extreme." You know, he went from from like he had a career where he was booked. He was he was going different places around the world doing what he was doing. He was being called by big companies. But something inside him drew him to farming and here he is today and he's a self-sufficient farmer. He um he raises cattle, he raises uh pork, chickens, um you know uh he supplies to many people now. Um he has customers, you know, right throughout the province here that he serves. I buy his meats and they're fantastic and his eggs and and uh chickens and wow, you know. So, um I'm just very very blessed to um to have you here today, Christian. So, uh God bless you. I trust that the word of God will uh do something. And uh we're all here for the same purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're here, you know, because we're a strange kind of people. Call it what you want, okay? But um you know, we're we're we're not like uh you know, like the rest of the world when it comes to Christianity, right? There's there's a mystery of God that has been unveiled to us that makes us peculiar. Um all of a sudden we understand that you know that uh we become a part of this mystery that we were you know that we weren't just regular people like all of a sudden you know when the word of God came to us at a certain time and season because we can all look back and you can always look back into the scriptures. God has a time and a season to unveil himself to whom he chooses. You know, that's the one thing about God that we need to understand, right? Is that that we didn't choose him. We weren't searching for him. &gt;&gt; A lot of people, oh, I gave my heart to the Lord. No, he was searching you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you if you're a son or a daughter of God, it's like what we've been ministering on for the last three months here, okay? On the adoption of sons of God. If you're a son of God and God is eternal, God had no beginning and no end. That means you an expressed son cannot have a beginning. &gt;&gt; You were always a son. &gt;&gt; It's just that we come into this dimension here and we go through what's called spiritual amnesia. And then God awakens us one day. You know, he chose to do it when I was 33 years old. He chose to do it for you when you were whatever. Some younger, some older. It's it's all his time in all his season. We can't we can't fathom God's plan, but he had a plan from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the element that we need to realize that, you know, if we come into that plan and all of a sudden we start to see things different than how the rest of the world sees it, it's because something's been revealed to you &gt;&gt; to see it differently. Amen. And there's a mystery that was under every dispensation. And that's why you go back into the Old Testament, you'll see that, you know, David all of a sudden, you know, who was one of uh, you know, the sons of Jesse. Uh, God sends Samuel to anoint a new king over Israel. David had no idea that he was actually going to be the king of Israel. He was just a shepherd. He was shephering sheep in the field. And, you know, and one day, you know, God's prophet shows up to Jesse's place and says, "God says there's a king in this house. just like he did to you and me. Like you know there's a son in this home, in this family, &gt;&gt; in this group here, &gt;&gt; in this city over here. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm coming to anoint him." &gt;&gt; And you know, and so David had no idea that he had representation as a son of God to be a king. But God saw him and and sent his prophet. And when he sent the word, he anointed him with the oil, which is the word of God, which is the Holy Ghost. Amen. When the Holy Ghost comes upon an individual, it awakens something inside them to recognize that they're not who they thought they were, but they're actually a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the purpose of God. And so, I'm already starting to preach. But anyways, this is the thing. And you know, uh, too many people are living under the wrong dispensation. And that's why to be living under just what's known today as Christianity and belong to a church and go to church and fall asleep uh you know leave the same way you entered in you know um that's you you're not hearing the word &gt;&gt; because when faith comes it changes you &gt;&gt; there's a change in your life and people know it &gt;&gt; they know that there's a change. Amen. Praise God. So we don't want to hold to traditions. We don't want to be held under uh traditions of man like when Jesus came to the earth and he's talking to the priests of that day, all the high priests. Imagine here's the word made flesh, God in human form talking to the priests of that day. Go back and read it in St. John chapter 6. And he's telling them and they're saying, you know, the priests are saying, "We are the sons, the children of Abraham. We would recognize that, you know, if you were the Messiah." they were actually they didn't believe that he was God. He says if you were the children of Abraham, you would know me. Okay? And so so understanding that there's something that's in you to recognize the word. Amen. And because their traditions have had made God such, you know, the way man wants to, you know, they want you to do the rosary and they want you to do all these different traditions of man and you can go to this church and they'll give you this teaching, that teaching. This is not a church with with with teaching. This is a church that's anointed by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. To bring the word of God. And so this is what we're under um this great mystery. So, um, let's go to the word of God. I'm sorry to keep you standing so long. We're going to go and we're going to continue, um, where we sort of left off last week. Amen. We've been on this series of being called unto adoption. We're at part 12 now. Uh, today um, we want to look at calling of the sons of God. calling sons of God because this is this is all part of the whole process of what God is doing by the word in our day. The word is calling us to our place. Adoption is about placing sons into their rightful positions. You came into this world and you thought this is what your life was going to be. But God had a different plan for you. And this is what the word does. It it changes your position as to what you thought you were into what you are today. Let's look at our scripture in the in Colossians. We read this scripture last week. It says here, let's just pray quickly. Father, we just commit this now, this portion of the service where we look into your word and we allow your spirit to come and and take control of the word. Lord, anoint the speaker, anoint the hearers. Let the let the uh let us move together into heavenly places where your word just becomes alive to us and becomes more real. Father, grant it. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God. Just what I was just commenting on. This is a different dispensation and to each minister under that dispensation is given a portion of the word that they will bring to the people. Amen. Now, I'm not the only minister. They're all over the world, but they've come under this anointing of the spirit of God. even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations. So this is this is something that God is revealing now that was not available generations, not even in the time when David was king. This mystery that we're feasting on now, which brings us into our rightful positions as sons of God, was not available then. Why? because Christ had to go to the cross in order to give his life so that his life which is God's life could come unto the sons of God by the Holy Ghost. That's why Jesus says if I don't go you can't come. And so here now he says, "But now is made manifest to the saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which pay attention now which is Christ in you &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. God bless you. May be seated." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. What a wonderful revelation God has unveiled in these last days to the children of God that would give us something that would inspire us to actually serve God to be inspired to to uh you know be uh uh a witness in this hour a reality of Christianity. Not just some oh I go to this church or I go to that church and you know arguing over this doctrine and over that doctrine. We are way down the road saints from arguing about who is right and who is wrong. We're not here to to you know to to tell who's right and who's wrong. We're here to bring the word of God. And when the spirit of God comes forth through through the preaching of the word, sons and daughters of God will hear the word and recognize the word and it'll put them into action &gt;&gt; to actually live the word for their day. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what true Christianity is all about. To be Christlike means to have the spirit of God in you. That's what the scripture says. That's what the great, you know, the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. And then he goes and says it right clear which is Christ in you. And people go to church, they don't understand. I I asked people, I said, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe?" Because I see you go to church. I see you, you know, praising God and and you know, like, but have you received the word for your day, which is the Holy Ghost? And they they don't understand that. They don't understand what the Holy Ghost is. But it's very clear in the scripture. Jesus says, "I will send you the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, and he will guide you to truth." &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. &gt;&gt; So when somebody has the Holy Ghost, it guides them to the truth because the Holy Ghost is the word. It's God. It can't go against the word. That's why I asked somebody. I said, "So, you were baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?" They said, "No." I said, "Well, how are you baptized?" They said, "Oh, I got baptized as a baby." I said, "No." Well, I said, "That's fine, you know, but can I tell you what Jesus said?" He said, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." &gt;&gt; Amen. How does a baby believe? Well, my parents are Catholic and you know that's what I did so I'm okay. No, you're not. Unfortunately, that's not what the Holy Ghost in the word wrote. Because I can show you Acts chapter 2:38 where everybody that received the Holy Ghost in the on the day of Pentecost when when Peter who was present there when Jesus says, "Go ye into all the world baptizing." Peter was right there when the people asked him, "What do we do to get saved?" He says, "Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; for the remission of your sin." In other words, you get buried your your your old life gets buried into the water and it comes up brand new and that's the new birth. It's not some harrishna and you start dancing and singing. No, you're just you're the same person, but now you've had this awakening of a new birth within your life. Amen. Praise God. And it changes your entire life. All of a sudden, now the Holy Ghost, which is God in you, Christ in you, has a different purpose than what your purpose was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You start to have different desires. You start to read your Bible. You start to listen to the word. You start to read the word. And all of a sudden, where before I remember, I'd pick up the Bible and I'd fall asleep after one paragraph, now I pick up the word, I read it, and it becomes alive. &gt;&gt; It It speaks to my heart. It It unveils things that I never understood before. Why? Because it takes the Holy Ghost to interpret his own word. &gt;&gt; That's why you cannot force somebody to believe this. It took me a long time to realize when I first came to the Lord, I try to convert the whole family, the whole the whole Ontario food terminal. And then I come to realize, wait a minute here. This is not something that I can give to anybody. The only thing I can do is just live it, &gt;&gt; experience it, &gt;&gt; allow it to to manifest in my life. So that that you know that that if in my testimony and sharing it with somebody, God would speak to them. And if there's representation there, &gt;&gt; because there's there's an attribute, remember that's the that's the son of God that you always were. If it's if it's locked up in this clay and it needs to be awakened, the word will awaken it in its time and season. &gt;&gt; And so this is the element that, you know, um, we experience as sons of God. So I want to read a quote here from William Brham. um you know in Christ the mystery of God revealed this that we're talking about that we've been talking about over the last three months it's all surrounding this okay the mystery of God but we're not going to make it complicated we want to make it as simple as possible so that you can see Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963 he says now God had a purpose and a hidden mystery And that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning. The hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living in. So when you're reading this, bring it to today. All right? See, then you will understand clearly then you uh you you will understand clearly then you see I believe what is being done. God's great mystery of how it's a secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody knowed nothing about it. What he's talking about is about God in the beginning. He had his own thoughts that he was going to express because he had a desire to be God on earth. God and man united together. That was his desire. God and man becoming one so that they could have dominion on the earth. This was his original plan. This is still his plan. He's going to fulfill it when we go from this dispensation into the millennium &gt;&gt; for 1,000 years of peace on earth. And the Bible says that the lamb and his wife are going to rule in that thousand years of peace. Rule meaning not that they're going to rule and bind, you know, uh, evil and this. There's not going to be any evil because evil is going to be bound up by chains of circumstance. All right? It's circumstance that holds people into the conditions that they're presently in. It's certain teachings and certain uh traditions and and it becomes like a circumstance that holds them into a certain understanding of the word of God that leads them away from God. But it's a consciousness and a and a and an understanding of God in you and receiving the power of the Holy Spirit in your life that places you into the circumstances that lead you to sunship. as a son or daughter of God. That's why people are are bound by their own circumstances. They're bound by their belief in the word or disbelief in the word. When you believe the word, Jesus said, "All things are possible." &gt;&gt; When you reject the word and you deny the word and you you're not willing to accept the word, then you are an element of circumstance. you become subject to the teachings of the world. All of a sudden, new age movement thought comes along. Oh, that sounds interesting. I think I'll adopt that. Or Jehovah witness. Oh, I think I'll adopt that. But a son or a daughter of God, they only hear the word. That's the only thing that catches them. It's the authenticity of God. It's it's it's common sense. It's an understanding where they when they read the word, they they they they believe it. They actually believe the word first and then they allow God to confirm what they're believing. &gt;&gt; That's how that's how the attribute is designed. You know that the attribute of God, the seed of God cannot disbelieve God's word. &gt;&gt; It can't. &gt;&gt; This can disbelieve God's word. &gt;&gt; That's why you struggle with this. It's it's it's your greatest enemy. It'll fight you to come to church. It'll fight you to stop to read your Bible. It'll stop you from listening to to to the services. But the attribute which is God in you, it desires the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's let's move along here. So next slide. He goes on and he says, even the angels, we're going to be looking into this now. Even the angels didn't understand it. See, he didn't reveal it. That's the reason under the seventh mystery. When the seventh seal was opened, there was silence in heaven. Revelations 8 verse 1. That when the seventh seal was open, there was silence in heaven. Why was there silence in heaven? when when when when before the seals were open, there was praising, worshiping, the cherubims were rejoicing because God was sitting on his throne. But when the seventh seal was open, which which is very important for us to understand, and we're going to be looking at that a little deeper as we go along here, understanding the ministry of William Branham. Very important. You know, people say, "Oh, I'm a Lutheran." I say, "Oh, Martin Luther." Yeah, you understand what Martin Oh, yeah. Martin Luther, he broke away from the Catholic Church back in the 1700s, you know, and or 1500s, you know, and he broke away from the Catholic Church and and and you know, his teachings. And today, you've got Lutheran churches all over the world. They're Martin Luther's teachings. And then Wesley, you know, later on in the 1700s, God gave him a revelation to take because you've heard of the Reformation. That's why that's why you've got the Catholic system and you've got the Protestant system because Luther was was the start of the Protestant restoration bringing the people back to the word again. And so Wesley, John Wesley, everybody know Presbyterian churches, they're all over the world. You talk about John Wesley, everybody knows there's a statue of him in England. I stood right next to his statue, took a picture with, you know, with his statue because I recognize his part in the word. I saw what God used him as a messenger, as an angel to bring a portion of the word so that we could come to the day that we're in. And then Pentecost broke out in the 19 early 1900s where the speaking in tongues and and and and you know the gifts of the spirit because God was restoring his word. Justification broke away from the Catholic Church. What was Luther's message? The just shall live by faith. In other words, I need my own relationship with God. How come I got to go to a a priest and he's got to and I got to confess my sins to him? No. The Bible says, "Confess your sins one one to another, &gt;&gt; but before God, &gt;&gt; not before man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so Luther had that revelation and understanding that he needed that people would have to have their own experience and personal relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he was still drinking, smoking, cheating, &gt;&gt; you know, because he was he was just, you know, a man that was, you know, maybe well the people, you know, maybe Luther, he he was more consecrated. We don't know. I don't go into all his, you know, detailed history. But Wesley comes along and brings a revelation on sanctification. You've got to live a sanctified, you got to have a life that's kind of, you know, expressing that God is a reality in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be fbombing here and, you know, this and that and and claiming Christianity. It's not what goes in that defiles a man. It's what comes out that defileth the man. Right? &gt;&gt; And so, so, you know, he had this understanding. And so William Brham now was the messenger to the Pentecostal age who was the one that would actually bring a revelation of restoration of the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers bring bringing us back to the word. &gt;&gt; He was a prophet. &gt;&gt; He had a prophetic ministry. &gt;&gt; And we're going to look at that a little bit deeper so that we can understand the importance of that ministry. We we we have to acknowledge the age and the messenger to our age. &gt;&gt; It was G Jesus was the messenger to the age when he came to the earth. &gt;&gt; He was the actual messenger. But how many actually recognized them? &gt;&gt; A dozen. &gt;&gt; There wasn't many that they followed him when he did the signs and wonders and when he when he would heal the sick and everything else, but when he when he said, "Unless you eat my body and drink my blood, you have no part of me." &gt;&gt; What? All of a sudden, you see, they had no understanding what he was talking about. Unless you eat my body, which the my body is the word, the word &gt;&gt; and my blood, which is the spirit, receive the Holy Ghost, you'll have no part of him. &gt;&gt; Unless you're a part of his body and you're willing to take and eat his body, which is eat the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have no part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the people couldn't understand that. And that's why the messenger to each age is vitally important to the people so that they know what God is doing in their day. &gt;&gt; That's the element that we must understand. And that's why we don't follow a man. We're not a cult. We don't we don't we don't worship William Branham. &gt;&gt; Do you see people worshiping John Martin Luther? No. You don't see people worshiping Wesley and you know this and that. But people, you know, they don't understand that we've recognized the messenger to our age &gt;&gt; that has given us a restored word. And more importantly, as John the Baptist was to introduce the first coming of Jesus Christ under an Elijah ministry, William Branham had an Elijah ministry to introduce the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. A lot of people are still waiting on his coming, but he's already come. &gt;&gt; This is very important. I know this is a this is a a profound statement. You mean he's already come? People are waiting to see him in the clouds. No, he's already come. &gt;&gt; He's come to redeem his sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; He's here by the word of God, living in a five-fold ministry of ministers that are all over the world that he's anointed to speak his word. &gt;&gt; Not traditions, not teachings of man, not you got to do this, you got to do that. No, his word. You are my word. and and and the deep will respond. If there's an attribute of God, which is his word in you, that word has to unite. &gt;&gt; It's got to come to the word. &gt;&gt; It can't it can't you can't miss it. &gt;&gt; But it's very few. It's always been a few. Remember that. Don't don't think Listen, the fact that you're in a minority is exactly in line with how it's always been. So don't be looking for, oh, I go to a church with 10,000 people. They must have the truth. You show me. If it's not true that, you know, birds of a feather flock together and people will follow because there's a crowd, people will follow the crowd thinking that they actually have it. Let me tell you, it's always been the opposite. When Jesus was walking with 12 disciples and the crowd of 5,000 that had just been fed left to go home because now their bellies were full. The disciples looked at Jesus and they looked the other way. They said, "Lord, they're all leaving." He says, "What's going on?" Jesus says, "Unto you it has been given." Read the scripture to know the mysteries of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; But look what he says. But unto them it has not been given. &gt;&gt; Now, not people are going to be saved, okay? Because they believe in the Lord Jesus. Don't get me wrong here. I'm not saying we're the only people that are going to be saved. No. God has sons and daughters and then there's people that are going to live outside the kingdom &gt;&gt; that are going to accept Christ because God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever would believe that's why I if you can just get somebody to accept Christ that they're going to live a better life and they're going to have a better future. &gt;&gt; But sons and daughters of God are eternal. They have a different part in the word. They have a different placing &gt;&gt; on earth. There's only one queen. There's a king and there's a queen. There was Adam and there was Eve in the garden in the beginning. Remember, we are playing out what was already in the mind of God. What he desired from the beginning. When he placed Adam in the garden, he placed them. He says, "And he called he made them in his image, which was God. And he called and he made them male and female and called their name Adam." It wasn't until Eve was taken from Adam's side that God took from the dust of the earth and created a body for Eve and for Adam. Now that they become living souls, that they became two. But Eve was in Adam. They were one. Their name was Adam. That's why if you're a son or a daughter of God, it's because you are a a part of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; You're the second Adam. &gt;&gt; But you're expressing Eve for the end time. &gt;&gt; You are the expression of Eve. What God wanted in the beginning to have dominion over the earth, you are now being called into your position as Eve, the bride. &gt;&gt; That's why the woman is always typed as the church. &gt;&gt; And so your position is to be the queen with the king &gt;&gt; and the two. That's why the Bible says the lamb and his wife are going to rule in the millennium. rule, meaning they're just gonna have dominion. That's what God wanted from the beginning. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And so here now, even the angels, like we said here, right? Even the sun. So he goes on, he says he he didn't reveal it that reason under the seventh mystery. When the seventh seal was open, there was silence. Jesus when he was on earth, they wanted to know when he would come. He said, "It's not even the Son himself don't know when it's going to happen." See, God has this all to himself. It's a secret. Now, here's where, you know, people get confused because here Jesus is saying, "Not even the Son knows." You got to understand that the the the plan of God was from the beginning that if a man's sin, a man had to die. So when Jesus came to the earth, he came through a virgin birth showing how sons of God would actually be birthed back in the beginning by the spoken word. That's why the angel went to Mary and said, "Thou shalt have a son. and you shall call his name Jesus. He had to take on a human form. &gt;&gt; And so he was man and God. &gt;&gt; Emmanuel was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; But he came for a purpose. He came so that we he came so that he could go to Calvary &gt;&gt; to die &gt;&gt; so that he could send the Holy Ghost back on us so that we could live. But he himself didn't. He says this is all in the plan from the very beginning. It was a part of the mystery that he would not unveil at that time. &gt;&gt; The fullness of the mystery could only be unveiled in this day. &gt;&gt; It's not something that he made available back then. even though he spoke it in many ways through his teaching and and and uh you know when he was talking to the people but it's today now by the Holy Ghost that we we we read the word and and and we get the mind of God. We get the understanding and the revelation of what he was saying and and that's why the Bible becomes alive to us. Amen. So, all of this was was was uh designed to unveil itself in this day. And Jesus knew this 2,000 years ago. And that's why he says that time is appointed. It's going to happen in God's time. But I I I can't reveal it to you right now. It's still a mystery that's going to unveil itself because God Jesus would not allow the enemy to know about it because one thing that Satan always did was he's an impersonator. He'd take the word and he'd impersonate it. And that's why through all the church ages, you see all the impersonations of of why the churches every church age when the Holy Spirit would come to that church age through the messenger, the people would be infiltrated by the enemy to get them off the word. Before you know it, they weren't baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ anymore. They were baptizing in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And then they were baptizing children. And now before you know it, 95% of the people believe that you can just be baptized any way. It doesn't even matter anymore. See, they've made the word of none effect. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so here now, let's go to the next slide. And that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices. And John was forbidden to write it. the coming of the Lord. He's talking about the opening of the seventh seal and he's tying it together with the coming of the Lord. And that's why William Brandham's ministry of Revelations 101:7, I can't get into the full depths of it, but you you know what I'm talking about. You need to go back and read the revelation of the seven seals. The importance of it is what brought Christ to the earth again in our day. It happened in 1963. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to elaborate on it right now, but we're going to look at it more. That's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come. It's a good thing that he doesn't see. No, he has shown or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible. Therefore, the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ. H you see you see what he's saying here? He's saying that that that the coming of the Lord and the calling of the sons and daughters of God, it's always been a mystery &gt;&gt; and it's something that will only be revealed to the individuals that can recognize the word for their day. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not something that that that God was going to explain. It's not given by explanation. It's not taught in any seminary. That's why you can go to whatever church you want. You're not going to hear this teaching and then have the ability to understand it by the Holy Ghost. Unless God brings you into it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You you must be brought into the mystery of God. That's why, you know, at the very beginning I said there's you're you're you're a peculiar you're a mystic people. You're a peculiar people because there's an element of the mystery of God that you are a part of that others are not a part of. And you don't join it. You don't decide I'm going to be a part of it. You were a son before you came into this church, &gt;&gt; but something is speaking to your heart. Something is happening on the inside. Amen. Glory to God. So here he goes on and he says every if you go back and you you know like that's why Jesus Christ his whole God's whole plan of redemption and his whole condensation of him coming from God to man he kept coming into a lower form into a lower form into a lower form until he actually took on human flesh himself which was the lowest form &gt;&gt; of humanity. and comes into this human realm. He was showing it and you can see it in so many types throughout the Old Testament and all the way leading up to the day that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll see it in the types of Joseph and you know, you go back and you see how Joseph, you know, how he was rejected of his brothers. Jesus was rejected by his own people. He was loved by his father. Joseph's father loved him, but he was rejected by his own brothers. They threw him into a pit. Just like they they they they threw Christ into a into a pit and crucified him. Threw him into a prison. But then God raised him up out of the prison. Raised him up from the dead and put him and sat him at the right hand of Pharaoh. a type of Jesus Christ being risen, seated at the right hand of the father, meaning the the the power of God. You see the type? And every knee had to bow when Joseph come into Egypt. And who was Joseph? He was the son of of of Jacob. And he and and he had a wife and his wife was a gentile woman. That's why Christ is taking a gentile bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see all the types like I don't there's there's many other types you know Isaac and Rebecca and and Eleazar and Eleazar typing William Branham the messenger and leading Rebecca to to Isaac and all of these different types throughout the Bible. Amen. All in a mystery but all unveiling itself and God bringing you into a part of that understanding. And so he goes on here. He says no, he has showed or revealed it in every type. Let's go to the next quote. He says the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible. And all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been a type and expressing what God's great goal is now. And now in this last day, he has revealed it and shows it. &gt;&gt; So this is now being unveiled before us. This is why we assemble ourselves because this mystery is continually being unveiled before us, bringing us out of our amnesia, making sense of our lives, why we were the way that we were, why we were, you know, in certain conditions. You didn't understand why, you know, you were you were a certain way and you you couldn't understand why, you know, you you were bound by certain things. But yet when this word comes along, it comes to to to liberate you from those things. It sets you free from those things that you thought you were bound by. This was the only word that would set you free. I remember I was under drug addiction for years. And I would look at that cocaine and I'd wonder, how in the heck is this thing going to take my life? I can't believe that this thing has such a hold on my life. But then all of a sudden, God had a different plan. And when he came and he called and he set me free, it was it was a miracle. It was an instant uh change in my life. And that's why there's no way I could deny what God had done. &gt;&gt; But only this message could do that for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the only revelation that would answer every question that I had about my life. &gt;&gt; Why I was I was a certain way and why I could see things in a certain way and see things different than the way others would see them. You were ordained to this. &gt;&gt; You couldn't miss it if you tried. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And he says here, he says here, and so so the believers in the Bible had been in type and expressing what God's great goal is. And now in the last days, he has revealed it and shows it. And with God's help, well, you'll see it right here this morning. What the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it. Therefore, you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then to try to bring it to the people. You see, now here's where we need to understand the prophet. We need to understand his part in the word of God. God sent him for a purpose. God ordained him from the womb to be a prophet in the 20th century so that he could display and bring God by the opening of the word by the fulfillment of Revelations 10:es 1-7 where an angel he was the seventh church age messenger. Okay, you got to go back and study the seven church ages to understand it. He was the seventh church age messenger to this Leodysian age. He had a commission. He was fulfilling a son of man ministry, prophetic ministry. A prophet is someone whom the word of the lord comes to. You go back into the Old Testament, you will see all the books, all the prophets books and the and the word of the Lord came to the prophet Elijah and the word of the Lord came to the prophet Ezekiel and the word of the Lord came to Moses. Who do you think was in Moses when he went and stood before Pharaoh and said, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; set my people free." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was God in Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. that was speaking to Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; They didn't understand it, but God proved it and vindicated it when he brought all the plagues upon Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Moses that brought the plagues. It was God in Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, we can look all down through the ages when God sends a prophet and and that prophet comes and says, "Thus sayaeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; That's not the man speaking. Yes, &gt;&gt; that's God in a man. &gt;&gt; That's a God man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. And so we need to understand that. So I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here. I want to go through through this element here of of uh my notes and it's going to lead us to that. But keep that in the back of your mind, okay? that William Branham was a prophet to this 20th century and that he had a commission and his commission was to fulfill Revelations 10:1-7. He would be the one that would be on the earth introducing the son of man to the earth. a son of man receiving the word, the mighty angel coming down to bring and open those seven seals. I'm going to leave it right there for now. Let's go to the next scripture. This is where we want to draw our thought from on calling of the sons of God. In Job chapter 38 verses 4 to7, where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding, who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest, or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the cornerstone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? Now, this we talked about this last week. this scripture, this is God having a uh, you know, a discussion with Job because Job went through, you know, go back and read it. Job's, you know, the the whole the whole story of Job and how God allowed the enemy to take his whole family to took his children, took his crops, everything to the very point where his own wife was telling him to just curse God. Why do you still believe God? But God was showing through Job that there was a part of him in Job that could never fail or disbelieve the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why when when he got to that place where Job, you know, got to a place, he told Job, he says, "Job, where were you when when when the foundations of the world," in other words, he took Job right back into his own mind and said, "I laid the foundations of the world. I'm the one that created this whole plan." You're so focused on your own little life and what it is that you think life is all about and you and and you're so discouraged. But where were you when the sons of God when the when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? This is what we're saying. If you're a son of God, you were always a son of God. God allowed Job to see back before the foundations of the world who he really was, what he was representing, what the whole plan was. And that's why Job eventually says, "I I I know I'll see my redeemer now. I I know that I'll I'll I will be on the earth as a son or a daughter of God." He came to that revelation. But the thing here that I want to draw from this is the understanding of what the morning stars and how they differentiate from the sons of God. Angels, okay, morning stars are angels. That's what they are. Sons are expressions of God. They are a part of God. Angels were created. They were created to worship God. That's why God could be worshiped because he created angels to worship him. God is only a word that is an object of worship. That's what made him God. But he's Elohim. But he needed something to worship him. So he created angels that would be able to worship him. Sons, they're always sons. But notice the difference. Morning stars sang. Sons shouted for joy. Amen. Angels and stars are messengers. Even the word morning star means angels from the beginning. Morning stars, right? The beginning. In Isaiah 14:12, you hear here in the scripture, "How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning?" How art thou cut down to the ground which did weight weaken the nations? He's talking about, you know, that Lucifer was an angel. Let's get this straight. Lucifer is not a son of God. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he's an angel. He's an opposer of God. &gt;&gt; That's what he is. That's what his desire was right from the very beginning. That's why he went to Eve in the Garden of Eden. It was the serpent that went to Eve in the Garden of Eden and got her to come under his spell of deception to bring forth children naturally. That's why the original sin was not an apple that Eve ate. The original sin was an adultery. The serpent was an upright man that could speak. That was that he was it was Lucifer himself taking on a human form. That's why God said, "Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat from it." What's the tree of knowledge of good and evil? It was Satan. He was the deceiver. And that's why Eve when she went that way, it broke the continuity. God said that the day you eat thereof, you shall die. It brought death into humanity. And that's why we need to be saved. Originally, Adam and Eve were eternal. They could have been in the Garden of Eden for a million years. That's why dinosaurs and all this. People try to say, "Oh, you talk about the Bible. It's only 6,000 years." There's dinosaurs that have been this proof that fossils this and that, 200 mill. Yeah. Adam and Eve could have been in the Garden of Eden before they went and actually ate from that tree. They could have been in the Garden of Eden for a billion years. There is no time in God. It's it's eternal. So things were evolving in the eternities if you want to say evolution of God because it has no beginning and no end. Amen. So understanding now the morning star that's why Lucifer oh son of the morning he was one of the morning stars that fell in the original plan. That's why the fall started before Eden. It was when they were there in the foundations of the world and the angels, they could fall. They could disbelieve because they had a beginning. They will have an end. But sons of God, they come from God. They could never have a beginning. They can never have an end. &gt;&gt; They're eternal. And they cannot disbelieve God because they are God. &gt;&gt; They're a part of God. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; This is the element that that we're coming to that that a lot of people they they find it hard to, you know, like people want to they want to take the new age movement and you know like I hear it all the time. We are God. We are we are the universe. They don't have a revelation. There's there's a revelation behind that when you place God in his rightful position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you understand the whole plan of God for this earth. You see, that's the other thing. There could have been a thousand other earths before this one. I don't know. You don't know. Nobody knows. But all I know is I'm on this earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God has a plan for this earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has a plan for your life. God has a plan for this earth. God's going to allow this earth to go into tribulation. This world is going into total chaos. It's already happening. You don't have to be a a scientist to know that. I don't have to try to convince you to see what's going on out there and the condition of the world and where the world is headed. All kinds of confusion, neutral gender this, that, you know, not under. Listen, God created a man and a woman. &gt;&gt; There's a male and a female. Yes, the two are one. Satan is perverting that by saying, "Well, I I want to identify as the the woman." But wait a minute. Have you checked your gender? Have you checked yourself? You know what I'm saying? Were you born with or without? If it's with, you're a male. like like just like just it's but you see the confusion is what's got the people off the word. You see the author of confusion. Satan is the author of confusion. Okay? He's not some ugly, you know, people want to paint as a as some ugly, you know, monster that's that looks gory and he's got all this blob flowing from him and he's a terrible. No, no. He's in Hollywood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's handsome. He's He's He's in the He's in the movies. He's in the He's in the the the the the billboards. He's He's everywhere. He's He's there to looking so beautiful, making That's what That's what's the problem with our young people these days. They want to fashion themselves a after some some beauty queen or some some hunk, you know, some, you know, they want to fashion themselves over that instead of fashioning themselves over the beauty of God's holiness, &gt;&gt; God's character. &gt;&gt; God's desire for the world. God's desire is perfect peace and love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is love. God is love, &gt;&gt; but he's not perverted love. Amen. Praise God. So, so here, lightbringer, morning star. That's what lightbringer is. Sons of God were gods, are gods. They're a part of the father. God could not be a father unless he had sons. That's why he became father because he had sons. Amen. And notice the sons, they shouted. So this whole series on manifesting the sons of God and how you know we are in this process of adoption that you know when the word came to us it was actually God showing us that we had an inheritance that we were not just the son or daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Mazili or or or so and so or whatever. We come to realize that we actually have an inheritance because we are sons or daughters of the living God. &gt;&gt; And a part of that inheritance is to manifest what he originally had in his mind from the beginning. Sons of God manifested here on earth. And so God had a plan in order to bring that about. and he's always done it by his word. That's why if you look in the Old Testament, the word of the Lord came to the prophets. God could have done it, bypassed everything, but he had a plan. You see, Eve back at the very beginning, the original sin, he disbelieved God's word. That same problem exists today. that when you disbelieve God's word, it sends you into a different existence. You now become a circumstance that lives in a different existence. You fall under the existence of of the fifth dimension. You're, you know, like, you know, how we talk about how we're in we're in three dimensions, light, time, and matter. The fourth dimension is the ether which is where you know uh Wi-Fi and and television and radio waves and everything move through that. Well, the fifth dimension is where where Satan, the fallen angels and those that disbelieve God when they die, they go to the fifth dimension. When sons and daughters of God or people that believe the word of God accept Christ are birthed by the word and they die here in this dimension, they go to the sixth dimension which is where the redeemed are. That's the place Jesus said, I go to prepare a place for you that where I am, you may be also. But those that disbelieve the word, those that reject the word, when they die, they go to a fifth dimension. Okay? That's why you'll you'll hear you you'll hear like people that have near-death experiences. The people that have neardeath experiences and they come back and they give their testimony, they say they go into this place, they it's like a like they can't they it's such awesome love and and and it's it's it's remarkable. It's because they haven't gone to their full destination. And it all depends on how they're living and what they believe when they actually have this experience. Okay? And it determines what they come back with in the way of a testimony. That's why they come back. They didn't go to fully to the dimension that their that their circumstance that their belief system is going to take them to. as a son or a daughter of God, you die, you go to that redeemed dimension. And if if you're meant to stay there, you're not coming back. And don't be looking to to communicate with that dimension because they do not communicate with this dimension. &gt;&gt; There's only one mediator between man and God, and that's Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; The only contact that you have right now is by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's you coming into the recognition of who you are as a son or daughter of God. And the message of this hour is going to produce what we know as the rapture because there's going to be those that are not going to die that are going to be translated from this dimension into heavenly places in a moment in the twinkling of an eye. We're going to look at that here as we move along. Amen. So, so God has this whole process by the word of bringing sons of God into a recognition of what God is doing in their day. And there's a portion of word that God has made available. And that word always gets passed on down to whom God chooses to be the voice in that particular age. Amen. So, sons of God, like you know, I was I was saying last week when I gave that testimony where, you know, brother John Simon had been in South Africa and, you know, he he went and met brother Alistister there and and, you know, he ended up preaching instead of brother Isaiah and he preached and he took this very scripture on where were you when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy and then he made this statement. He says, "If the sons of God shouted back then, then why wouldn't the attributes of God, sons of God, shout in this last day? &gt;&gt; They'd have to have something that they'd be shouting." &gt;&gt; There's something that's in them that's going to produce the word in their day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this whole element it it it just you know it broke open for brother Alistister and it broke open for me when I heard it too when he mentioned that you know that there's these attributes. Remember God had this plan but this plan has like a 7,000year cycle built into it. We need to understand that. And we're at the end of the 6,000 years of that cycle. But within those cycles and within those dispensations, God had clusters of sons and daughters that would live in each of those different ages. That's why when you go back, you know, Moses, well, Moses had a cluster of attributes that had to manifest and they had to come together. Aaron, his brother, his mother, all those, you know, everyone that was a part of Moses' day, they were attributes of God that had to manifest the word in that particular day. &gt;&gt; David was a part of another cluster that he had to come into manifestation. He would be the word for that particular age. Amen. And here now we see that this has been the process all the way through. Even when Jesus the mighty God himself, the Messiah would come to the earth, he would come for for the main purpose of restoring back the sons and daughters of God without him coming to die and bringing himself to the earth and and not only did he come, but he came with us in him &gt;&gt; because remember he is the word. He's the logus. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God and the word was made flesh and you as a part of the word are a part of that logus. So when he went to Calvary and died at the cross, you went to Calvary with him. &gt;&gt; When he died, you died. When he rose, you rose. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it takes the Holy Ghost in you to rise you and to and to and to produce the resurrection, the second resurrection. We saw the first one when Christ came to the earth. That's all in type form of exactly what he's going to do when he takes us in this resurrection &gt;&gt; which is going to produce the rapture. We're going to see the parallels in that. But within all of that, there's a shout that represents the word. Let's read on now. I'm going to read the the next uh quote here. Brother Brandham speaking. He says in the hand of the when the the hand of the Lord came upon him. He says why I said about God spoke to Job one day and he said Job where was you when I laid the foundations of the world. Tell me what there tell me what they're fastened unto said when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy. Listen what he says here. a hundred million years before the world was ever formed. That's why I'm saying don't if that's the beauty of what this prophet did for us. Remember the word of the Lord came to the prophet. The prophet he took us not just back to the book of Genesis. He took us look a 100red million years back into the mind of God because God is eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says before the world was even formed, they had shouting religion. &gt;&gt; Listen, he's talking about shouting religion here. What is shouting religion? It's the word. It's the word being able to create to go forth and manifest the thoughts of God. A thought is only a thought, but when it's spoken, it becomes word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when God spoke word, he said, "Let there be light." The interpretation is right up there in the in the sky. &gt;&gt; It's called the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the interpretation of his word. It manifested exactly what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's how he's bringing everything to pass. &gt;&gt; That's why it's got to be the original word for the sons and daughters of God. We can't take a tradition of the church. &gt;&gt; We're not interested in man's teachings. We're not interested in your interpretation on God's word. Let God be his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; He will make it plain by it bringing it to pass. &gt;&gt; That's how God is going to vindicate what you believe or disbelieve. &gt;&gt; He's going to vindicate it in your own life personally. You will know that you know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not standing here, you know, uh, after 31 years believing this message, more excited about it than I've ever been. &gt;&gt; Because I'm seeing what it's bringing me into. &gt;&gt; I'm seeing what it's going to manifest in my life. I see what the world's condition is. I see what it's going into. And I can see the word as clear as I can see it. I can't help it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You couldn't miss it. He says, "It's it's because you've you've caught the shouting religion." Amen. He says, "Then talk about something new." Why? It's the oldest there is. And the only kind there really is. Yeah. It's old-fashioned, heartfelt, sky blue, sinkilling religion. Brother, it don't whitewash you with traditions of men and teachings of men and Hail Marys and this and that. What the heck is that going to do for you? &gt;&gt; Think about it. You want a real experience with God. You want to know God is a real heartfelt sky blue sinkilling brother. It don't whitewash you. It washes you white from the inside out. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. Makes you do things you didn't think you ever would do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I remember when that word struck my soul 31 years ago. I was listening to John Simon preach on on the woman at the well. How she was a prostitute. She was living a life of prostitution. But Jesus come along &gt;&gt; and discerned her life. Told her all about her life. &gt;&gt; While he was speaking to that, while John Simon was speaking about that woman, all I could hear was my life. &gt;&gt; All I could see was my condition. All I knew is that I was that prostitute. &gt;&gt; He was discerning my life, my need. He knew what I had need of. Amen. And it changed everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was a it was a sinkilling shout &gt;&gt; that came out of John Simon that that that brought me into a recognition of who I was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not the son of Dominic and Ida Mazili. &gt;&gt; Those are my parents. I love them with all of my heart. But I am a son of God before &gt;&gt; I am a son of this world. &gt;&gt; I just heard that it's millions of years old. I'm millions and mill I you can't even put an age on who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so this this this makes it all just uh you know a completely different thing. So here now we understand now here's now where where we bring it now to to our day because in order for us to fully comprehend okay what do I got here about 15 minutes? Amen. Okay. So, you know, we're not going to finish today, of course, but we want to bring it to our day and we want to come to a place where we can understand why God always does it by his word. And he uses angel messengers, prophets, amen, to bring the word so that we can recognize what the word for our age is supposed to produce. We don't want to hear somebody telling us about Noah building an ark. That was in Noah's day. What good is that going to do us today? We don't want to be building a an ark. We're not worried about a flood coming. We're looking at a great tribulation. We're looking at where the whole world goes into complete chaos. God's going to have to take this bride off the earth for three and a half years while this world goes into three and a half years of great tribulation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we need to understand why God had to send a prophet in these last days because it was just like he did when John the Baptist remember John the Baptist there Jesus said there had been no other prophet as great as John until that day. &gt;&gt; Why would Jesus have said that? &gt;&gt; Why was John so important? because he was the one that would introduce the first coming of Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why God had to send a prophet &gt;&gt; and he was under the spirit of Elijah. &gt;&gt; And so God, you know, back in 1933, William Branam, he's baptizing, he was just a minister at the time, and he's baptizing people at the river, you know, in in Ohio there in Jeffersonville. And while he's baptizing these people, there was there was many witnesses that were there. A light, a pillar of fire come right down and hovered over that pool of water. &gt;&gt; And an announcement came forth where people heard, they heard it. Yes. &gt;&gt; As John the Baptist was sent to forerrun the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, so shall your message &gt;&gt; be the front runner and the forerunner of the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. This was witnessed by people. You can even go back and search it in Google &gt;&gt; and you'll see that it was an actual event made the newspaper. It was an event that that that even William Brham didn't fully understand. But yet his ministry took a turn from that point on and he now became the messenger to the final age to the to the to the to the Leodysian church age. He was he was not John. He was not Martin Luther. He was not Wesley. He was the Pentecostal messenger to the seventh church age. that not would be just a a man anointing, but would have a God man anointing, son of man ministry, prophetic ministry that would bring God on the scene again. Go back and study it. Go back and read about him. &gt;&gt; He brought that mysterious element of God back to the earth. There was no Listen, you can go back and read it. his revival and his meetings. They say to this day there was more miracles and more supernatural done in his ministry over the 30 years 33 years that 32 years that he was in the ministry that it even surpassed by by many times the miracles that Jesus did. &gt;&gt; We're talking hundreds of thousands people that were raised from the dead, supernatural things that were God. What was God doing? God was vindic. Remember, don't look at the man. &gt;&gt; I'm not raising up William Brandon here. &gt;&gt; I'm raising up God's word. &gt;&gt; God's word came to the prophet. &gt;&gt; It's the word that we're talking about here. &gt;&gt; It's what the word did in him that's producing what's going on in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what I'm not lifting up the man. I'm lifting up the word. If if if I be lifted up, he says, if I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto me. I'm not going to lift up William Brandom. I'm not going to push the tapes. I'm going to push Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. So, so here now I want to read a scripture because we want to understand why we recognize William Brham's ministry was the message of this hour. &gt;&gt; It was the message that would bring us to where we are today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Should I get started right now or should I wait until next week? &gt;&gt; Oh my glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's get started. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next slide here. Thessalonians, this is this is the hour we're living in. This is what this is what we're going to produce. This is what this whole message is all about. That's what Christ the mystery of God is all about. Amen. He says here, "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope." You know, so many people they just want to talk about, you know, oh, I I'm I'm going I'm going to go to heaven or this one's going to go to hell. You know, if you don't believe Jesus Christ, you're going to go to hell. If you don't believe, you know, all these No, we're not here to talk about that. That's not what we're here to do. Amen. Praise God. That's why Paul, he had a he had an understanding of the revelation of the word. He says, "Don't you be worried about those that have gone on before us. Don't worry about them. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus, &gt;&gt; those that received Christ in their dispensation over those seven church ages after he rose from the dead, we came through seven church ages. That's why you need to go back and read the seven church ages to understand the whole process of which God was doing to build up this body of Christ that we're now coming to the fullness of. Amen. He says he says here that that when those received Christ in their day, they were the bride in their day. &gt;&gt; They were anointed by the Holy Ghost to fulfill what they did through the dark ages. That's why if you go back and you read on the in the dark ages, you you hear about those Christians that were fed into the into the arena. Lions would rip them apart. They would cut them into pieces. This and that. But yet, go back and read and study some of that. Those Christians, they came out there praising God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had an anointing on them because the Holy Ghost was on them for their day. They had the word anointing on them to overcome whatever it was that they had to face in their day. &gt;&gt; You have been given the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; by the power of God to overcome this dimension. No matter what you face, &gt;&gt; no matter what you think, oh, I can't do this. Oh, you know, people are going to think I'm crazy. Don't worry about it. There's an anointing that's going to come on you, which is the purpose of God that'll override whatever gets in his way. &gt;&gt; Nothing is going to get in God's way from you becoming the manifestation of a son of God. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can stop it. &gt;&gt; God's purpose is in the Holy Ghost. That's why those those disciples that had to die for the gospel, they had to get burned at the stake. They were worshiping God while they were being burnt. Why? because the anointing on them. You think they felt any of the heat? They felt the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe in a supernatural God. And God can supernaturally change whatever circumstance &gt;&gt; you might be dealing with. So he says here, "Those which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. They don't worry about them. They're actually waiting on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're waiting on you to come into your sunship because they've already gone to their theophony bodies. They've already gone to that sixth dimension, but they're not with Jesus yet. They're not fully come together as the complete body of Jesus Christ, the bride and the lamb, Christ and his bride. That is what we produce by the rapture. That's why we have such an important element to fulfill as we are adopted sons coming into the manifestation of sons of God. But a part of this manifestation is that you have a shout in you. Listen here. Next slide. 1 Thessalonians 4:16 to18. For the Lord himself, now I'm going to say to you plain and simple, for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the atmosphere in the clouds, not up into these clouds like people think. It's a dimensional change, saints. It's a dimensional change. People are not going to see you when you go in the rapture. They're going to miss you. They're going to say, "What happened? I know she was there and now they're not answering." There's going to be all kinds of confusion, but there'll be a a caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. This is the rapture scripture. Now I want to break it down a little bit. Couple minutes. No, you know what? Let the musicians come because this is where it just starts to, you know, the inspiration like I've got lots of notes here. Don't worry, we're going to get into this. It's going to it's going to just it's just going to continue. I I'm trusting that you know that you're you're catching here what God is trying to unveil to us. He's trying to make it clear to us what it is that he's doing. That he's possessing attributes, sons and daughters of God. He's placing his word in you. He's given you that anointing to understand what it is that he's doing in this day and in this age. Amen. Which is going to produce by your ministry. You have a part to do with this. This is not just, oh, I'm just going to go to church. No, there's a shout in you. &gt;&gt; There's a message. There's a revelation in you that's bringing forth sons of God. &gt;&gt; You didn't understand. You would listen to the message. you you know all of a sudden something catches your your your your your your attention because it was your time. It was your season. It was it was time for God to unveil himself to bring you into your position as a son of God. &gt;&gt; But he's got a purpose in doing that. Don't think it's just to be a church member. It's to be a a a reflection of what he did. And we're and this is what we're going to be looking at next week. We're going to be looking at what God produced in William Branham as the wave sheath as the first son of God to to to come into full manifestation to where he could actually manifest the things that sons of God will manifest by the spoken word &gt;&gt; when they come into their fullness. We're not talking about hocus pocus here. We're not talking about, you know, uh, Superman and and flying from here to there. No, no, no. We're talking about the reality of what God is doing &gt;&gt; and what God did in that man's ministry. We're going to look at it a little closer next week and we're going to see that what God was displaying, the reason why God came down in 1963. That that that was the beginning of the shout. That was where God would would descend and the Lord himself. That's why the scripture says the Lord himself shall descend with a shout, &gt;&gt; the voice and with the trump of God. All three of them is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the shout was the message that he had to bring to William Branham. &gt;&gt; And the reason why he was bringing it to William Branham was so that he could bring it to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this is what we're going to understand deeper as we move through this. And and and by the grace of God, it's going to bring us into a clearer understanding of our sunship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As sons and daughters of the living God. Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Our gracious father. Lord, I can only expound as much as I can see. And Lord, human ability and words and understanding and and and language. Father, I could only say so much. But Lord, what's going on in our hearts and in our minds and our hearts burning within us, Lord, this is an element that that only you can do. Only you can make this real to each and every individual heart so that we can Lord fulfill the purpose, the plan, the destiny that you had for each and every one of our lives. Lord, this whole world is coming to a to a to a close in the chapter of this element and this time of the word to be fulfilled, the rapture of the church. It's it's coming quicker than we think, Lord. It's it's because the word is becoming more real to us. It's becoming uh Lord clearer who we are, why we we were the way we were, why we had such lives that were kind of misunderstood and Lord uh uh mystic in certain ways. And but Lord, you've made it clear, Father. You've made it real to us now, Lord, that that we're not of this world. We're in it, but we're not of it. And Lord, that is an element that only you can do. That we are so grateful for. Father, we commit the word that's been spoken and all that was, Lord, uh, placed into our hearts. May May it just stir within our our lives this week. May May it cause us to search deeper into you, Father, and your will for each and every one of our lives. Grant it, we pray. Prosper us, watch over us, Lord. Protect us on the roads, Father. Bring each and everyone safely home, Lord. Bless our weak lays before us. Prosper our weak, Lord. You know, you're Jehovah Gyra. You provide all of our needs. That's the element that Lord that that's so beautiful when we come into that relationship. All the promises are are now ours if we can just believe. Grant it we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen and amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Go ahead, &gt;&gt; brother. [Music] Why don't we all stand and thank him? The Lord is good. The Lord is good.
