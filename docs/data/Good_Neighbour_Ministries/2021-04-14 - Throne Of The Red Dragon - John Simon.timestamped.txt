[1:26] some of these things
[1:30] so may god help us and bless us tonight
[1:33] as we look into the word of god
[1:38] tonight's reading will be from
[1:41] revelation chapter 2
[1:45] reading from verse 12 to
[1:48] 13 and
[1:52] to the angel of the church
[1:56] in bergamos right
[2:00] these things saint he which had
[2:04] the sharp sword with
[2:07] two edges
[2:11] i know thy works
[2:15] and where thou dwellest
[2:18] even where satan's seat is
[2:24] and that thou holdest fast my name
[2:28] and has not denied my faith
[2:32] even in those days wherein antipas
[2:37] was my faithful martyr who was slain
[2:41] among you
[2:43] where satan dwelleth
[2:48] amen praise be to our god
[2:52] our gracious father we ask your greatest
[2:56] and most wonderful blessings upon us
[3:01] we ask the great holy spirit
[3:05] will cause us to be prolific an
[3:08] expression of the word of god to the
[3:10] hearts minds lives
[3:12] of your dear wonderful people
[3:16] may the spirit of the living god take
[3:19] control of this earthly vessel
[3:22] that eternity can express itself through
[3:25] time
[3:26] and that the heirs of man can hear
[3:30] or discern the spirit of god
[3:34] taking the word and breaking the bread
[3:36] of life once again
[3:38] not by galilee but to you and me
[3:41] that our eyes may be open to see what
[3:44] thou has for your people in this hour
[3:47] for we ask it in the name of jesus
[3:50] christ
[3:51] amen and amen
[3:54] praise god hallelujah
[3:58] now we are speaking of the throne
[4:01] of the red dragon the bible of course
[4:05] expresses it thou dwellest
[4:08] where satan's seat is
[4:13] now this throne of the red dragon
[4:17] or satan is a
[4:20] throne of blood
[4:24] it's a throne of idolatry
[4:27] and it's a throne of polytheism
[4:33] it is also a throne of satanic
[4:36] worship thanks be to god for his
[4:41] wonderful elect his brave soldiers
[4:45] who fought against satan and
[4:48] overcame him right in the midst of his
[4:53] own throne room where
[4:56] he dwelt at that time
[5:00] they won the battle through the
[5:03] mighty name of jesus christ
[5:06] and by faith in the word of
[5:10] god that was made known to them
[5:13] and right in the middle of the
[5:16] camp of the prince of darkness
[5:20] they were able to overcome and
[5:24] win a marvelous and
[5:28] wonderful victory my dear brothers and
[5:31] sisters
[5:32] and so you can
[5:36] in the midst of the surrounding
[5:38] enveloping
[5:39] darkness of this day and of this hour
[5:43] we have this not only comfort but
[5:46] encouragement
[5:47] and strength and assurance
[5:50] to know glory to god that
[5:54] we can overcome and defeat satan
[5:59] in the midst of the darkness
[6:03] that he has created hallelujah
[6:07] what a tremendous commendation to god's
[6:11] people
[6:12] that we will and
[6:15] can and are overcoming
[6:19] right in this day and in this
[6:22] hour reminds me so much of david's
[6:25] mighty
[6:26] men when they
[6:29] cut their way through the the walls of
[6:33] the enemy
[6:34] to bring a drink of water
[6:38] back to david
[6:41] there to quench his thirst
[6:44] those men were giants of of the faith
[6:49] they were heroes mighty
[6:52] men of david who invaded the realms of
[6:57] the philistines at that time type of us
[7:00] who invades the atmosphere and
[7:05] uh you know the the territory
[7:08] of satan and defeat him
[7:12] on his own grounds to be able to
[7:16] preach and to exhort and to warn
[7:20] and to bring the people to jesus christ
[7:23] right in the middle of satan's cities
[7:27] kingdoms uh rooms wherever he has them
[7:32] that we can bring the word of god
[7:35] and bring out his captives
[7:39] out of their prisons bring them out of
[7:42] bondage out of habits out of sicknesses
[7:45] out of fear out of doubts out of
[7:48] denominational confusion
[7:50] chaos we can bring them out by the
[7:53] clear crystallized truth
[7:56] of the word of god that they themselves
[8:00] can see
[8:00] we have nothing to prove we have nothing
[8:03] to analyze and debate
[8:05] about we have nothing to have religious
[8:07] strife
[8:08] over force truth is stated truth
[8:12] or it's the truth or it's not the truth
[8:14] and we know that we have
[8:16] thus said the lord which is the truth
[8:20] from the very word
[8:22] of the living god amen hallelujah
[8:25] praise god hallelujah even though we
[8:29] live under the very
[8:32] shadows of death yet we
[8:36] know we have god's goodness and mercy
[8:40] walking with us on our right hand and
[8:42] our left hand
[8:44] protected from behind and before
[8:48] from the arrows by flood that fly by
[8:51] night
[8:52] the attacks we can't see and the arrows
[8:55] that come at us by day
[8:57] the ones we can see god defends
[9:00] us for the lord of battle
[9:03] israel is his name the lord of shabbat
[9:06] is his name the lord of hosts and of
[9:09] armies
[9:10] is his name and we are a part of that
[9:14] army of the most high living and
[9:17] mighty god the greater moya
[9:21] amen naomi praise god
[9:24] hallelujah the names of god as brother
[9:27] branham
[9:28] said the mighty god who moves like the
[9:31] wind
[9:32] the mighty god of the lightning and the
[9:35] thunder
[9:36] oh praise god that no wonder when the
[9:39] seals broke
[9:40] seventh thunders utter their voices for
[9:43] the voice of
[9:44] god is like the thunder across the
[9:47] plains amen
[9:49] may the glory and honor of the living
[9:51] god
[9:52] speak to us his words amen
[9:55] praise god hallelujah so god
[10:00] honors his people when they overcome
[10:04] satan
[10:06] living and battling satan
[10:09] in the very realm where he is
[10:12] and that's where we are
[10:16] for he is the god of this
[10:19] evil age he is the prince of
[10:23] darkness he is my friends
[10:27] lord of the flies and the lord of lies
[10:30] also and god has empowered us
[10:35] elected us to live in this
[10:38] hour in this age because of his
[10:41] confidence in us that we
[10:45] are able to overcome with
[10:48] god's help and defeat satan
[10:51] in the name of jesus and through the
[10:54] testimony of the word and the living
[10:58] blood of
[10:58] christ which is the holy spirit
[11:01] amen praise god amen hallelujah
[11:06] now my friends we find
[11:10] that evil has gained
[11:13] a lot of supremacy within
[11:17] the church of the living god
[11:21] now we find in this uh
[11:24] church age of pergamos
[11:27] the bible describes pergamos
[11:31] as the seat where satan
[11:34] dwellers wear his throne
[11:39] or the throne of the red dragon
[11:42] is so many phrases
[11:46] have been used and
[11:49] uh may god help us to
[11:53] marshal our powers of descriptive force
[11:57] to cause you to see to know and to
[12:00] realize
[12:02] what the great holy spirit is trying
[12:06] to convey to us and teach us
[12:09] by the unfolding of the word of god
[12:14] now we know that real history
[12:17] bears out this fact that pergamos was
[12:22] indeed the place
[12:25] of satan's throne and dwelling place
[12:31] now if you can remember some
[12:34] lessons ago i mentioned about how
[12:38] in pergamos it was the seat
[12:43] of escopalis which
[12:46] was the which was
[12:49] a serpent god they had a
[12:53] literal serpent in the temple
[12:57] and they would feed the serpent
[13:00] and they would worship that serpent
[13:03] and that serpent type of satan
[13:07] was their god now it's done in that way
[13:10] that the people are worshiping the
[13:12] serpent not realizing they're really
[13:14] worshiping the spirit that is behind
[13:17] that serpent
[13:18] which was and is satan
[13:21] himself so out of pergamus
[13:25] came this satanic serpent
[13:29] worship of mixed with
[13:32] sex and sin and
[13:35] that origin of course was originally
[13:39] from babylon and then
[13:43] came the pergamos for if we were to read
[13:47] in
[13:48] our bibles genesis chapter 10 verses
[13:51] 8 to 10 please write that down
[13:54] or note it we find in there
[13:58] that the bible tells us of the rise of
[14:02] nimrod and how he became a mighty one
[14:06] in the earth and was a mighty hunter
[14:10] before the lord also you would like to
[14:14] read genesis chapter
[14:16] 11 verses
[14:19] 1 to 9
[14:23] and there you will have more information
[14:26] about that now he
[14:30] was the founder of bay bell
[14:34] see the bible says that he founded a
[14:39] bay bell and you know in the bible
[14:41] that's where
[14:42] the people decided to become one type of
[14:45] what's happening with the
[14:47] denominational council study coming into
[14:50] a one
[14:50] world government church you know
[14:54] and so they were doing that at that time
[14:56] in
[14:57] type or in shadow and god came down and
[15:00] confused the towns
[15:02] amen from one tongue he confused the
[15:06] tongues
[15:07] where they could not understand one
[15:09] another
[15:10] oh my there we find but of course
[15:14] babel is the original name
[15:17] of babylon babel
[15:20] of course means confusion it means
[15:24] chaos and there
[15:27] that was literally started
[15:31] by cush the son of him
[15:36] and was brought to a place and kingdom
[15:38] of power
[15:40] and notoriety and grandeur
[15:44] by his son cushy's son
[15:48] nimrod he was the mighty honda
[15:51] of genesis 11.
[15:56] we understand from profane history
[16:01] that nimrod had three ambitions in his
[16:04] heart
[16:05] one to build a strong nation
[16:09] that he could be master and leader of
[16:14] and to propagate his
[16:17] own religion separate from the religion
[16:22] of god that was already existent
[16:26] of one god he desired
[16:30] to propagate his own religion
[16:34] in opposition to god's faith
[16:40] certainly he wanted to make
[16:43] a great name for himself
[16:47] you see satan always wants to copy god
[16:50] to be
[16:51] like god to raise up himself in pride
[16:55] that he could be a god and he can be
[16:58] the god and all of that that
[17:01] is always his ambition
[17:04] and i would say this he is so dumb
[17:08] so stupid that he decreed
[17:11] creation is trying to overcome his
[17:14] creator
[17:16] he the one that is limited
[17:19] is trying to overcome the unlimited
[17:22] omnipotent omniscient
[17:24] mighty god to this day in this hour he
[17:28] will not learn his lesson
[17:30] but in obstinates the rebellion and
[17:34] pharsetical stupidity he is at this
[17:37] hour still rebelling resisting
[17:40] against the purposes and plans
[17:44] of the living god
[17:47] now at babylon
[17:50] this religion gained prominence and so
[17:54] much that in later years
[17:57] when daniel saw it was described
[18:01] as the head of gold among
[18:05] the various nations
[18:08] and it took place it took over
[18:11] the entire world his entire religious
[18:15] system
[18:16] described of write this down
[18:20] isaiah chapter 14
[18:24] revelations chapters
[18:27] 17 and 18.
[18:31] in this bible god
[18:34] calls that mystery
[18:37] babylon back there it was
[18:40] literal babylon the city of babylon
[18:44] but now it has morphed
[18:47] and gone under cover and raising and
[18:51] rares up the red angry
[18:55] figure of the red dragon now raises up
[19:00] in the form of a church or churches
[19:06] dripping with inquisitory blood and here
[19:10] we find my brother sister
[19:12] the bible describes this as
[19:16] mystery babylon the harlot
[19:21] oh god have mercy upon us search the
[19:24] scriptures
[19:25] read your bible study those scriptures
[19:29] which i have and am giving unto you
[19:33] to check this out for yourself
[19:36] now history can prove that he
[19:40] invaded the whole world
[19:44] and that was the basis of
[19:47] every system of idolatry
[19:51] in the world today it is also the
[19:54] seam of all mythology
[19:59] that we may read about originates
[20:04] because this babylonian pagan religion
[20:08] invaded the entire world
[20:13] and though the names of the
[20:16] gods may differ in different lands
[20:20] among different nations it's the
[20:23] same evil god
[20:27] given a different name on the different
[20:29] tribes different languages different
[20:31] cultures
[20:32] but it's the same satan and the same god
[20:36] the same red dragon
[20:39] rearing his ugly and evil head
[20:44] this monster of sin and evil that
[20:48] lurks behind the scene tries to even
[20:52] create the atmosphere that he doesn't
[20:53] have
[20:54] exist tries to create the atmosphere as
[20:57] if he's not there
[20:59] these things are just happening evil had
[21:01] just taken place
[21:02] sicknesses pain trouble trial temptation
[21:05] seductions deceptions
[21:07] they all taken place the lukewarmness of
[21:11] the church the dying of the church the
[21:13] chaos confusion of denominationalism
[21:16] all these things it's just happening
[21:19] it's just confusion
[21:21] i tell you my friends
[21:24] in the name of jesus christ and by the
[21:26] word of god
[21:28] that there is an evil personality
[21:31] lurking behind the scenes
[21:35] there's a puppet master so devilishly
[21:39] evil
[21:40] that he is able to jerk the chains and
[21:43] move the strings
[21:44] of the puppets that he has seduced
[21:48] and induced to do his his evil
[21:52] will of course
[21:58] was able to make a name for himself
[22:02] and that will keep going on name
[22:06] name names blasphemous names
[22:09] various names he makes a name for
[22:13] himself
[22:13] and that will continue until our joseph
[22:18] our jesus comes again
[22:21] to reveal himself to his brethren
[22:24] which he is doing by the word and so
[22:28] satan will be
[22:31] honored and worshiped
[22:34] in these temples so-called churches
[22:39] of his and honored
[22:43] under a different name
[22:46] than nimrod they won't call him nimrod
[22:50] you'll instantly recognize it but it's
[22:53] easy
[22:54] for them to do what they did in 325 a.d
[22:58] when the babylonian and roman priests
[23:04] changed the names of the various gods
[23:09] janus jehovah yes
[23:13] change the names uh
[23:16] and we'll go into that later on but here
[23:19] my friends
[23:22] is being worshipped
[23:26] in temples
[23:29] different or from which he originally
[23:33] started because you see now the temples
[23:36] have modernized
[23:38] his places of worship has modernized
[23:44] and his form of idolatrous
[23:48] satanic worship
[23:52] continues but is now disguised
[23:57] under various forms of
[24:00] so-called christianity
[24:04] now it's going to be necessary for us to
[24:07] look at some ancient uh
[24:11] records to find out the answer of how
[24:15] pergamos became the seat
[24:20] of the satanic religion
[24:24] of babylon
[24:28] and the major sources for that
[24:31] will be found in egyptian
[24:34] records and
[24:37] grecian records you look into
[24:42] ancient egyptian records
[24:47] and into greek culture and you will be
[24:50] able to see
[24:53] this stream
[24:56] of black evil
[25:00] power of satan in operation
[25:06] now we realize that egypt
[25:11] received har mathematics
[25:15] science and so on
[25:21] from the chaldeans
[25:26] let me repeat
[25:29] the egyptians received their sciences
[25:33] mathematics and stuff from the chaldeans
[25:39] and greek the greek grecians
[25:44] in turn received their mathematics
[25:50] their sciences all
[25:53] coming from egypt
[25:57] it did not originate
[26:00] in europe it
[26:04] did not originate in such a place
[26:07] but they actually received it
[26:10] from in egypt
[26:14] now the priests of course were the ones
[26:17] who were teaching
[26:20] sciences actually as a part of
[26:24] religion
[26:29] so that is one of the reasons also
[26:32] why the babylonians religion gained
[26:35] strength
[26:36] because they're teaching religion and
[26:38] under religion they were also teaching
[26:40] science
[26:41] mathematics and all kinds of other isms
[26:45] in there along with faith
[26:50] and because of that
[26:55] we know that anytime one nation
[27:00] overcame another nation the religion
[27:04] of the conqueror became the religion of
[27:08] those that were conquered
[27:11] and that is how he was able to transform
[27:15] his false faith his false religion
[27:19] with its various built-in
[27:23] systems contrary to the word and
[27:26] rebellion to the word of god
[27:30] using it to transfer his religion
[27:34] from nation to nation
[27:37] and it is from this my brothers and
[27:40] sisters
[27:41] that the present world system
[27:45] and its so-called civilization
[27:49] that has spread throughout the world
[27:53] all its culture originated from
[27:57] exactly where i have told you
[28:01] all the babylon to this day
[28:05] and to this time where the foundations
[28:10] of the systems laws
[28:13] culture civilization so-called came from
[28:20] now it is well known that the greeks
[28:24] had the signs of the zodiac
[28:28] but they got that because it came from
[28:30] the babylonians
[28:31] originally and
[28:34] it was found in ancient egypt
[28:41] the zodiac was found in ancient
[28:45] egypt that knowledge
[28:48] and religious knowledge and natural
[28:51] knowledge
[28:52] was transferred from egypt
[28:57] into greece all the theories dear realms
[29:02] geometrical sciences this that it all
[29:05] came out from egypt who got it from
[29:08] babylon
[29:10] and then it was transferred into
[29:14] greece and all the rest of europe and
[29:17] now
[29:18] it is all over the world as
[29:21] civilization and as culture so-called
[29:25] but
[29:26] the origin is babylon
[29:29] in rebellion to god and his word
[29:34] led by nimrod who is not now here in the
[29:38] flesh
[29:39] but the same spirit that animated him
[29:43] and encouraged him to do what he did
[29:47] then
[29:48] is still here now the red
[29:53] still exists the god of war
[29:58] the god with a troll of blood and evil
[30:02] is still here among us working behind
[30:05] the scenes
[30:07] princes of darkness powers of the air
[30:10] oh lord of god but praise god
[30:14] we know from the word of god we
[30:17] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[30:20] against
[30:21] principalities and powers and the
[30:23] spiritual wickedness in high places
[30:27] all these territorial spirits that
[30:29] control
[30:30] cities towns villages nations we are
[30:33] here with the name of jesus christ the
[30:36] power of god
[30:37] and the holy spirit to break the chains
[30:40] that satan has put across these
[30:42] places and these peoples and set them
[30:45] free
[30:46] we have the power we have the power by
[30:48] the grace of god
[30:50] to accomplish this in his great
[30:53] and glorious name
[30:56] amen so
[31:01] the egyptians got it to repetition
[31:04] the the egyptians got their religion
[31:08] got their cultures got their sciences
[31:11] all from babylon
[31:15] then the greeks got it
[31:18] from the egyptians religion
[31:22] sciences culture so-called civilization
[31:27] all out of egypt of course they reshaped
[31:31] it reformed it
[31:33] into their style of it but
[31:36] the origin remained the same
[31:42] now these mysteries of babylon through
[31:46] the instrumentality of the
[31:47] nations that they conquered
[31:50] began to spread and before long
[31:55] the red dragon raised his head rared his
[31:58] head up in rome
[32:01] it spread and reared in india
[32:04] then again the red dragon raised his
[32:07] head
[32:08] whipped his tail around and there he was
[32:12] in
[32:12] china yes satan
[32:16] moved even into north america
[32:19] and south america and mound
[32:22] the peoples of these lands
[32:26] and they worship remains the same
[32:31] the same basic worship they may use
[32:34] different
[32:34] names and different ways of doing things
[32:37] but the basic foundations
[32:40] remains the same now
[32:44] ancient histories agrees with the bible
[32:49] that the babylonian religion
[32:52] was not the original religion
[32:56] that was there it was in rebellion
[33:01] to the original faith that was there
[33:06] amongst the earth's
[33:09] earliest peoples
[33:15] certainly historians
[33:18] like wilkinson
[33:22] historians like malay
[33:26] they have proven conclusively
[33:30] from ancient documents that at one time
[33:35] all the peoples of all the entire earth
[33:39] believed in only one god
[33:44] one god who was is
[33:48] supreme eternal
[33:54] invisible and now
[33:56] i say indivisible
[34:00] oh praise god hallelujah
[34:04] so the original faith
[34:07] was the belief and faith in
[34:11] one god eternal supreme
[34:15] so the babylonians were the first
[34:18] nimrod was the first to
[34:22] drift away from the original
[34:25] faith that existed
[34:28] among peoples
[34:32] upon the earth at that particular time
[34:36] satan is a corrupt being
[34:39] and everything he touches becomes
[34:42] corrupt
[34:44] and so he began with the corruption of
[34:46] the hearts and minds
[34:48] of men so that he can get them
[34:52] to reject the truth of god's
[34:56] holy word he
[34:59] tried to draw worship away from
[35:02] god and to bring that worship
[35:06] to himself acting
[35:10] as if he is god
[35:14] he wanted to draw it to himself wanted
[35:16] to exalt himself
[35:18] just like nimrod did want to make a name
[35:20] for himself
[35:22] uh yes and he
[35:25] he did accomplish his desire
[35:29] because he has been able to spread his
[35:32] religion
[35:34] into the whole world
[35:38] listen what the book of romans says
[35:41] when they knew god they glorified him
[35:45] not as god
[35:48] until they became vain in their
[35:50] imaginations
[35:54] and through darkness of the heart
[35:57] they accepted a corrupt religion
[36:00] oh my became vain in their imaginations
[36:05] and satan got them to accept
[36:08] a false faith a false religion
[36:12] and they began to worship creatures
[36:16] things snakes birds fishes
[36:19] trees rocks
[36:22] to this day there are still sane
[36:26] people people who claim they're
[36:29] intelligent
[36:30] under the system of babylon
[36:33] and they claim their intelligence and
[36:36] they're bowing down
[36:37] to rocks carves wood
[36:41] bowing down to a car whether it's a
[36:44] jewel or a diamond or whatever it
[36:46] doesn't matter what it is it's a rock
[36:48] and they worship such a thing
[36:51] contrary to the will of god making it so
[36:55] fashionable so beautiful like the
[36:58] serpent was
[36:59] so attractive and charming
[37:02] as the serpent was and is
[37:05] oh my think of it oh praise god
[37:09] remember friends how through that
[37:12] darkness
[37:15] he corrupted the minds of man now you
[37:17] must remember
[37:18] satan let's say lucifer not
[37:22] satan lucifer was a creation
[37:27] of god whoa so you're saying god created
[37:33] satan evil like that no god created
[37:36] lucifer who was called son
[37:40] of the morning we will not go
[37:44] out give you the entire outline
[37:47] but lucifer
[37:50] led a rebellion in heaven
[37:54] it's written in the book of revelation
[37:55] and there was war in heaven
[37:57] and michael and his angels fought
[38:00] against
[38:01] lucifer or satan and his angels
[38:04] amen and he was cursed by god
[38:08] and kicked out because of this act of
[38:12] rebellion
[38:13] in heaven his sin
[38:17] and the curse of god
[38:20] caused lucifer to become
[38:24] satan because his nature
[38:27] changed and with the change of nature
[38:31] came a change of name he was no more
[38:35] the light bearer he was now the prince
[38:39] of darkness
[38:41] but now yet on the various religions
[38:45] various teachings he is still trying to
[38:48] proclaim
[38:49] that he is going to give you some form
[38:52] of secret
[38:53] light but that so-called
[38:57] form of secret light coming from the
[39:00] babylonians and egyptians
[39:02] and so on is really
[39:06] darkness once he was
[39:11] the light bearer but when he rebelled
[39:14] against god
[39:16] raised himself up started his own
[39:18] religion
[39:19] trying to you know uh promote himself
[39:23] god kicked him out of the kingdom cursed
[39:26] him
[39:27] and then he went
[39:30] through a change of name
[39:34] from lucifer he now became satan because
[39:38] his
[39:38] nature was changed
[39:43] he became the personification
[39:47] of ultimate perversion
[39:50] of god's creation because god did not
[39:54] create
[39:55] a satan he created
[39:58] lucifer who perverted his
[40:01] own nature by his sin
[40:05] and perverted it to a satanic
[40:09] evil and corrupt nature
[40:12] let me give you an example god created
[40:15] revelation uh
[40:16] genesis chapter three
[40:19] god created the serpent revelation
[40:23] chapter 3 if you will make a note
[40:26] verses 1 and verse 14.
[40:29] you may read the entire chapter if you
[40:32] wish
[40:34] but we find the bible says the serpent
[40:36] was wines he was intelligent
[40:38] he was more subtle than any other beast
[40:41] in the field
[40:42] in other words he was the top animal
[40:46] in amongst animals there was man
[40:50] then the animal kingdom started
[40:53] and and the serpent
[40:56] was the top animal that was there
[41:00] over the rest of them for he was the
[41:02] only one that could reason
[41:05] that could think that was subtle
[41:08] only that he did not have a soul
[41:12] like man has a soul
[41:16] but he was wise he was intelligent he
[41:19] could walk
[41:20] he could talk the bible tells us you can
[41:23] go read that yourself
[41:24] how he walked with eve he talked with
[41:26] eve he reasoned with eve did not god say
[41:28] so and so soon so
[41:30] and he had his gospel so-called
[41:32] discussion means while he's inter
[41:34] introducing his perversion and perverted
[41:36] way of of seeking
[41:38] and perverted logic and stuff like that
[41:41] he was inserting it and injecting it
[41:43] into the truth of god's word to deceive
[41:46] her
[41:46] away from the word of god
[41:50] so he the serpent
[41:54] and you know the rest of the story and
[41:56] that is how
[41:57] all sex and sin got inserted into
[42:00] babylonian religion
[42:01] how he committed adultery in the garden
[42:05] with eve not eating an apple
[42:09] but committed adultery that's why god
[42:11] curse what
[42:13] cursed me the serpent
[42:16] from this day on thy belly shalt thou go
[42:20] he was not on his belly he could walk he
[42:23] could talk he could converse
[42:25] she wasn't afraid of him at that time
[42:27] they could just walk and talk
[42:28] but he was the serpent and he was
[42:32] wise and he was standing upright but god
[42:35] said from today
[42:37] you commit your sin on your belly on thy
[42:40] belly shalt thou
[42:41] go from this day you're gonna crawl and
[42:45] creep around
[42:46] on your belly then he turns around he
[42:49] says
[42:49] endow woman curse me that when
[42:53] conception from this day
[42:55] you're gonna have pains in giving birth
[42:58] you're going to have
[42:59] problems when it comes to that then he
[43:02] cursed what
[43:03] cursed me the ground the three
[43:05] participants in the act were
[43:07] cursed by god cursed me the ground now
[43:10] there wasn't weeds there wasn't
[43:12] thorns there wasn't anything like that
[43:13] but from today you're going to start to
[43:15] have thorns you're going to have to have
[43:17] weeds and all kinds of stuff and even
[43:21] though the man
[43:22] did not do anything but go along with
[43:24] his wife and agree with her
[43:26] amen god says breath from today
[43:30] from the sweat of your brow you're going
[43:32] to eat bread you're going to have to
[43:33] label
[43:34] you're going to have to go out there and
[43:37] work for what it is
[43:38] and do those things okay my friends
[43:42] but then he became a snake
[43:47] the serpent became what we know today
[43:52] as a snake we use the word serpent
[43:55] serpent like that
[43:56] but in reality there are no
[44:00] real serpents on the earth there are
[44:03] snakes
[44:05] but we as humans we just interchange
[44:08] the words snake and serpent knowing that
[44:12] the
[44:12] unconsciously or unconsciously that
[44:14] there is an affinity
[44:16] there is some kind of thing between what
[44:18] we will say serpent and slave
[44:20] but really there are only snakes
[44:23] on the earth today on thy
[44:26] belly shall thou go
[44:29] and so this sexual serpent
[44:32] warship came upon the earth
[44:36] through babylon passed into rome
[44:41] china india north america south america
[44:44] spread throughout the world
[44:47] blanket to the entire place but of
[44:50] course
[44:52] that vast babylonian group turned from
[44:55] god
[44:56] but thank god the descendants of shem
[45:00] or the semitic people held to the
[45:03] confit the faith of the original word
[45:07] hero israel the lord thy god
[45:11] is one lord
[45:14] i am the lord i change not beside me
[45:18] there is no god no other
[45:21] one god and today we know the jehovah of
[45:25] the old testament
[45:27] is jesus of the new testament
[45:31] amen praise god and praise god
[45:35] there was only one original faith
[45:39] but once there was one now there is two
[45:43] there is the original faith
[45:46] and satan loves to create counterfeits
[45:49] and confusion so
[45:53] there was no real reason for confusion
[45:55] when there was one thing but now you
[45:56] have to
[45:57] you got two choices these days he's got
[46:00] thousands
[46:00] of choices and they're more confusion
[46:03] and so
[46:04] that's the chaos that's the babylonian
[46:06] system
[46:07] that's the confusion that he's caused
[46:12] on the face of the earth in the bible
[46:14] one book of acts
[46:16] one church one fate one baptism
[46:19] one name but soon the devil comes in
[46:23] oh what happens now we got three
[46:26] thousand we got thousands of them
[46:28] everybody claiming that they're the one
[46:31] like that
[46:32] no one my friends let's go back to the
[46:35] word back to the bible
[46:36] see the original faith what god has said
[46:39] in
[46:40] his word for now we see that turn
[46:43] monotheism one god
[46:46] into polytheism many gods
[46:50] belief amen and the devil's
[46:54] lies and his so-called
[46:58] mysteries of his faith
[47:01] began to rise up against the truth
[47:06] of the word of god
[47:09] satan truly became the god of this world
[47:14] and began to extract an exact worship
[47:18] from those whom he had duped
[47:21] deceived and seduced spiritually
[47:26] causing them to believe
[47:29] that he was the true god
[47:32] and that in their temples under the
[47:35] guise and
[47:36] forms of various forms of christian
[47:39] religion
[47:40] that they were worshiping the true god
[47:43] and god had already spoken
[47:47] that how they would be so deceived there
[47:50] will be
[47:50] worshipping satan in the house of god
[47:55] thinking and believing his lie
[47:58] but there will be really worshipping
[48:00] satan in the house of god
[48:02] thinking they're worshiping the true god
[48:04] when they have been led
[48:06] us free back to the word my friends back
[48:09] to your bible
[48:10] back to the original faith see what
[48:13] wonderful great things the lord has done
[48:16] for
[48:16] us and how he has opened the word of god
[48:20] to us
[48:21] how he's opening up our minds eyes
[48:24] how he's caught in your blinded soul
[48:29] to see your deaf and spiritual ears to
[48:32] hear
[48:34] and to recognize that he is the same
[48:37] yesterday to the end forever we have
[48:41] given you an outline of how the
[48:43] red dragon the red the troll of the red
[48:46] dragon
[48:48] was in bergamos but we had to go back
[48:52] and show you
[48:54] the very regions way back in genesis
[48:58] the rise of nimrod the
[49:02] establishment of babel
[49:05] through his ambitions to have his own
[49:09] nation his own religion and to exalt
[49:12] himself
[49:14] and how that he accomplish this
[49:17] and spread it not only at bay bell where
[49:21] god confused the languages
[49:24] but he propagated it proliferated it
[49:28] caused it to spread out across the world
[49:31] how it went down into
[49:35] into egypt and from how egypt
[49:39] jumped across the mediterranean to
[49:42] greece
[49:43] of which today we're they're claiming uh
[49:45] culture
[49:46] and and language and mathematics
[49:50] and science that's absolutely false
[49:54] it's absolutely a lie for all those
[49:57] things
[49:58] did not come either from greece or
[50:01] either from
[50:01] africa itself it came right out of
[50:05] babylon
[50:06] then came to africa then
[50:11] it came from africa into greece
[50:14] and then it spread to europe and
[50:16] throughout the rest of the world
[50:19] the entire thing is a system and
[50:23] scheme of satan pulling on his
[50:26] puppets controlling them from the great
[50:29] his
[50:29] his red throne to this very day
[50:33] moving his evil lies of his mysteries
[50:37] into the modernized temples
[50:41] of satan under the guise
[50:46] of so-called churches
[50:49] teaching not the original faith of one
[50:52] god
[50:54] but teaching of faith of polytheism
[50:57] poly meaning many or many gods
[51:01] contrary to this bible
[51:04] and to the original faith
[51:07] are of our fathers from
[51:10] abraham the patriarchs
[51:14] the prophets right on down to our day
[51:19] to this hour and this very moment
[51:22] right and wrong engages in that battle
[51:25] today
[51:27] it's about time showdown time is here
[51:31] the holy spirit is here the rapture is
[51:35] at hand
[51:36] and it will be all be over then when we
[51:39] come to the end of the way
[51:41] when the battle is over we shall wear a
[51:44] shining ground
[51:45] may god bless you my friends repent
[51:49] if you need to bring your life in line
[51:52] with the word of god
[51:55] to clean up and clear out the junk and
[51:58] the
[51:58] evil lies of satan that he piled up in
[52:02] your heart
