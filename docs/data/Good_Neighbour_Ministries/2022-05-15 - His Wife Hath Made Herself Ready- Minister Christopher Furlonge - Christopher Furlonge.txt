hevestness daring is a preaching in the spirit and food despises father's instruction but he that regarding reproof is prudent in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wreaking is stronger the lips of the wise dispersed knowledge but the heart of the the foolishness of the wicked is an abomination to the lord but the prayer of the right upright is his delight the

my bride it's his wife amen and to be a wife you have to be married it's no more time a courtship floating around seeking for somebody when you become wife you make a personal commitment to a man amen hallelujah so you're not looking around for any other one you look into that one that one who you committed yourselves to hallelujah i don't want to jump ahead too much this morning hallelujah the lord is just he's here see where two or three are guarded in his name he's in the midst and what he's here to bless you to encourage you to give your instruction to lead you to guide you amen when the spirit of truth is come he shall lead you and guide you into all truth you cannot be deceived man hallelujah and i want to say as his wife you cannot be deceived amen hallelujah praise god you know i

some verses the main praise god hallelujah some reason i got up this morning with a sore truth you know the enemy he is he's always on the attack you know he really would so if somebody gotta speak it he will try to stop it in every way possible but he's a liar he's a deceiver he's already been defeated amen and god is here to make everything plain hallelujah let's just pray before we read this

momentary hallelujah praise god now it came to pass in the days of our lives this is chapter one book of esther chapter one amen amen this is ahusharas onto etopia over 107 and 220 provinces amen going on to verse 3 in the third year of his reign he made a feast on two unto all his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and the princes of the province's being before him verse 5 and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace both onto great and small seven days seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace it has so much types here when we're reading that you can just take just even a little portion of scripture and just go amen but i just want to stay focused and the little thought that we would have here today amen praise god hallelujah going down to verse nine so you see the king he made a feast for seven days also vashti the queen made a feast for the woman in the royal house which belonged to the king of houstoras so here we see the king avenue face now his wife want to do our own thing what a time you seen it out there amen on the seventh day when the heart of the king was married with wine he commanded with all these chamberlains and so forth muslim to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royals to show the people and the princesses with her beauty for she was here to look at but the queen vashti refused to come to at the king's commandment by the chamberlain therefore was the king very wrought and his anger burn in him going down to verse 18 amen so we see now the queen refused amen likewise no so it's gonna stir up some kind of rebellion among other people amen so likewise shall the ladies of persian media say this day unto all the king's princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall they arise too much contempt and wrath verse 19 if it pleased the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians enemy that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king ahushirus and let the king give her royal estate onto another that is better than she my hallelujah going to chapter 2 verse 2 then the king said then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fear young virgins sought for the king amen and i'd like you all to turn to revelations chapter 19 reading from verse 6 hallelujah if you got it say amen amen praise god and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reign it let us be sad let us be glad i hope you're paying attention this morning i don't want you false falling asleep on me because if i if i put you to sleep i'm going to wake you amen hallelujah glory so let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come amen and his wife hat past tense made herself ready i hope you're catching it here's why heart made herself ready so he's no longer a bride no more his wife amen hallelujah and to her was granted now we just read from the book of esther amen until who was granted just as esther was granted the thanks for her purification amen we're going to just speak a little bit about esther this morning amen and just kind of move as the spirit will lead us because i have so much here we will just you know go with his direction this morning hallelujah and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the little fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of god you all may have your comfortable seats today god bless you bless you hallelujah have you been called unto the marriage supper of the lamb amen hallelujah he has been calling through all these ages but at the end of the seventh church age amen there is a marriage feast that is going to be taking place and he's been calling all these charlies through the seven ages onto this grace feast that is going to be happening amen hallelujah praise god praise god when does the marriage stopper takes place it takes place after the wedding amen and when you have our wedding amen in in your customs as it's customary here amen is when two people are joined together amen in holy matrimony and they become one amen hallelujah so as we have read from the scripture amen when does the bride becomes a wife amen is when she takes the oath amen hallelujah and is committed onto one man amen then she becomes a wife amen hallelujah praise god and where does this wedding takes place in heaven or it sticks to this here because here it is she has been addressed as wife not wife a bride she's been addressed as a wife not a bride so there has to have some kind of intimate relationship happening amen right here amen for her to be acknowledged as wife you getting it amen so when god called you man you repented of your sins amen you went into water baptism you took an oath unto him amen that you're going to follow him you commit your life to him you're going to obey him amen you're going to do the things that he's saying amen it's then you took the oath off becoming a wife to him you're getting it amen so it's no more floating around no more hunting for somebody else you're committed to one person the lord and savior jesus christ hallelujah thank you lord jesus blessed be his wonderful name i no longer call you bride i call you wife amen hallelujah so you see as we have read the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and what the word ready means amen is be prepared mentally or physically for some kind of action or an experience are you ready for action and an experience amen this morning today hallelujah another word for already is willingly disposed inclined to agree to someone's proposal amen being cautious heedful attentive and watching amen so as we have read the scriptures i've been instructed all these years to be ready to be watchful to be waiting for what for him to take us out here hallelujah thank you lord jesus hallelujah so just as we see how vashti had refused the king the king's commandment man to come into his presence to present her to the people just as that king typing our lord and savior jesus christ he is seeking a wife amen just as eliezer was seeking a wife for isaac all through the ages god has been seeking for a wife for himself amen and all those who hearten and heed to that call amen there was something inside of you that responded to that call hallelujah praise god and you amen obey that call thank you jesus so we see esther was to become a bride amen so there was a stage from becoming a bride from being a bride to being a wife amen hallelujah now vashti who was wife to the kingdom right she refused and in the in those days the law was if you refuse a commandment especially from the king the king he has a right to put you away to put you out and take all your position possessions and give it to somebody else man what has happened amen with the churches out there to those who are called to this feast amen they refuse it so what god is doing amen is taking away all that was supposed to be given to them and giving it to somebody else amen hallelujah what they were interested in is all the gifts the palace nice house nice cadillac nice clothes and everything but they were not interested in the giver of the gifts amen hallelujah they would listen to some other man amen but not listen to their husband amen hallelujah praise god thank you lord so we see esther was to become a bride so she did not want if you continue to read on which is a lot of reading but you know just just read for you guys amen you can read it on your time but just taking a little bit here a little bit yeah putting it all together by god's grace amen she didn't want any of the adorning of the world amen she wanted to go to the king just as she was but she had a a an uncle she was an orphan her mom and a dad man and her uncle took her men amen and brought her up as his own daughter amen hallelujah so she was given the things for her purification amen hallelujah she adorned herself like a woman or two with a meek humble spirit not with all the fancy fundamental things that the world will look for all the max factor the mascara the makeup only put on amen the cover-up i might say to cover all of themselves for them to look good man but when all the makeup come off and only only the the mascara and everything come off amen you want to know what you're really seeing here god is looking for character amen [Music] you're looking for a meek and humble spirit amen he's not looking at you outside how you're dressed how you look you look into the inside of the inside amen hallelujah for character amen hallelujah one who will listen to his word one who would follow his word amen hallelujah praise god thank you lord jesus praise god but when this esther came into his sight and he got a glimpse of that sweet humble meek spirit he said that's her amen that's her go get the crown and put it on her head let the woman adorn themselves with that kind of spirit not only the woman but also the men amen to adore themselves with that kind of spirit then you becoming ready for to be a bride amen hallelujah sweet reverent humble not to be proud to be humble but to really be humble amen hallelujah esther made a heart clean is your heart clean towards him today he knows your thoughts he knows your intentions of every single individual nothing is hidden from him nothing nothing is hidden from him he knows your past he knows your present and he knows your future amen he knows what seed that was placed inside of you because he know what choice you are going to make amen so he placed himself inside of you amen so when he speaks you're gonna ask you are a free moral agent choose this day who you going to sue amen hallelujah the choice is yours god don't force himself on anybody doesn't man push you and push you to what it's just going to be prepared pretending but if you have a clean humble spirit inside of you god already know that amen hallelujah pre-destination amen hallelujah that's why he placed himself inside he he knows that you want to accept him amen to be part of himself amen hallelujah to be his wife he's the head he you are a body part of him he

same yesterday today and forever you say a man hallelujah amen hallelujah washed by the water of the wood amen you say amen hallelujah repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ you say amen not father son and holy ghost amen amen not titles but taking on your husband's name hallelujah when a woman don't want to take a man's name she don't really want to be his wife she wants to do our own thing and that's like the normal day hallelujah but when you are united with the lord jesus christ you're going to take his name in baptism hallelujah my my mind glory to god thank you lord jesus when you take his name in water baptism it's an oats word symbol testimony to the world that listen i am married to the lord jesus christ to no other man i am seeking no other amen that's my husband that's the one i'm going to follow amen hallelujah that's the one i'm listening to and you say amen hallelujah the new vote it is a mess but life's life comes out of that mess only one way you can receive life is through a booth the natural types the spiritual hallelujah it's messy but it makes life people try to dodge it they don't want to wash off the mascara of their face you look a whole lot prettier if you won't wear it amen yes if you try a little acts 2 1 4 and you're not acts 2 1 4 says be filled with god's spirit with the holy spirit amen hallelujah it beat all that max factor ever could make hallelujah you know the prophet had a way of expressing things he he did not too much in there he didn't know how to pronounce some of the things or whatever but by by his uh his um inspiration he caught a lot of things out there even before he came here because he was a prophet amen hallelujah i'll tell you that if you just try a little at that it will be an eternal beauty a sweet meek quiet spirit hallelujah that's what this woman had that's what esther had when she came before the king that's the reason she overrun all the other girls she beat them to it she pushed him aside she was no bridesmaid she was debried preparing to be a wife to the king amen hallelujah and he chose her so today because she were adorning herself with a sweet spirit she became the queen and when you adore yourself with a smeak humble spirit you become not nearly the queen of heaven you become his wife you become the queen of heaven amen hallelujah thank you lord and one day you will you will meet her too she will be part of the body hallelujah praise god if any woman that refuses a man to have his child she has no right to be his wife see you have been born again there's a new boat that has taken place into inside of you that seed that god planted inside of you it's growing there is a birth that is taking place within each and everyone's heart and one day you will bring forth the man that child or man called christ jesus amen just as mary said be it unto me according to your word you see this book is not within a man natural man and woman being a sexual happening but it's a spoken word happening a supernatural happening which every single person which we bypass amen we hear it over and over again we were supposed to be come here by the spoken word of god amen and you have been birthed by the spoken word of god amen to receive the new book you have to receive the word the spoken word amen before you could have got that new book amen hallelujah so in fact you are on track to having a man amen a new boot you have it you're on track of becoming a new creation hallelujah praise god so all things are working out for his good man so god could have have a established all his attributes man to be a father to be a healer to be a provider all his attributes you see god knew all these things satan was going to do on him and he already had a provided way amen hallelujah so satan think he's smart but listen he's been outsmarted amen when god says he's gonna have a wife ready he's gonna have a wife ready he's gonna have a wife ready so when he comes around with his lies and telling you you ain't part of it just tell him where he where he came from and where his destination is and you tell him where your destination is amen hallelujah he's bound for hell i am born for heaven i am born for a palace amen hallelujah thank you lord jesus praise god hallelujah notice he said the king could have put away his wife because according to the law he could have put her away amen and all throughout these seven ages amen hallelujah and through wesley pentecost when they refused to have an intimate spiritual relationship with him to be pregnant by the word of god they refuse to have that what god did put them aside give someone else who was willing men to take him at his word to believe his word not just to take to receive his word amen hallelujah so if they refuse you are blessed today you are blessed about all heavens thank you jesus that you have received his word what a privileged people we are amen hallelujah to receive the king of glory amen to receive his seed what a privileged person that's why you are called wife a bride can receive seed you have to be a wife to receive his seed hallelujah you got to be committed hallelujah thank you lord jesus praise god praise god praise god thank you lord jesus hallelujah thank you lord yes hallelujah the lutheran church refused christ to have any so he had no more desire for her amen hallelujah praise god you remember in the bible man as we have said when the king married esther the queen refused him and he just got another and when that happened when she refused to come out with the king and obey him the same thing is with a woman that refused to be a wife to a husband glory to god i have so much other stuff that i wanted to present to you today but this has to be time another time i would have loved to show you how when jesus spoke about his second coming amen on a day at the lord's supper he was typing a typical galilean wedding all this ceremony and everything but some other time by god's grace i'm going to present that to you i just want to continue amen on on his wife amen has made herself ready praise god just want to remind you of brother branham's favorite story about the ranch's son who is over who knows about that story about the ranch's son so i just want to just update you and get you a little bit more familiarized with that story amen how a rancher's son who was seeking a wife for his son amen this rich wealthy man the god of heaven seeking a wife for his son amen not two persons there amen god himself the lord jesus christ who is the lord jesus christ seeking a wife for himself and brother related the story so many times see there was this orphan girl her both parents were dead just like esther she had all the rough work to do hallelujah there was a big party at the ranch and after the supper was over so you see this rancher amen sent his son done to get a wife he was from chicago amen he had many sons but this one he sent down to this ranch to find a wife amen he looked all over in chicago he can't find anything to please him so he said maybe if i go down you know into some countryside i might find somebody that is suitable so he send it down to this rat so he threw this big party man the dancing the drinking and everything and so after the party was over amen this young man he went through seen all these young people they well dressed up with all the mascara we might say put on the makeup and everything so he know it's just a big pretend they say boy tonight we're gonna catch him we're going to really fool him right we're going to bring out all the glitter and glamour you know and you know monkey like shiny things the bright lights you know when you put on all the bright lights you're ready cassie that's why when you someone you're going visiting at home you go look uh viewing and you know sam go look see homes put on all the bright lights to hide all the faults in the place that's true right right it blind you right and i always say party and paint make the devil look like a seat so the putter enough paint and and potty to hide all the faults in them amen but when all that comes out they want to know what's happened what did i see look for character young man young woman those who are seeking a partner in life look for character beauty is going to fade popularity is going to fade men the one who stands by you through thick and thin that's the one amen through the ups and down amen when you go and you take that vow amen in sickness and in health to rich and poor amen not only going at tough to take off amen hallelujah looks for someone with character who will stand by your side through all time amen hallelujah jason bypassing amen hallelujah thank you lord jesus so when we see this uh this
