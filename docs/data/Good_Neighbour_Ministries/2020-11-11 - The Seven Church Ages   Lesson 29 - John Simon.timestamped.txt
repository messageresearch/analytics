[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good evening friends
[0:16] it's good to be here once again thank
[0:20] god for his marvelous grace
[0:24] at this time i would like to recognize
[0:29] the contributions to our society
[0:33] made by our marvelous
[0:36] veterans veterans of various
[0:40] wars that have given
[0:43] their lives that have surrendered
[0:47] themselves to preserve
[0:51] and to protect our
[0:55] civilization and our
[0:58] countries thank god for the veterans
[1:02] especially of canada
[1:06] and of the united states
[1:09] we thank god for them and pay
[1:12] respects for them we thank god
[1:16] as we remember a wonderful veteran
[1:20] that used to be in our midst but has now
[1:24] gone to his reward brother henry
[1:27] gagnon a guard
[1:30] of generals that were
[1:34] brought from europe to canada and were
[1:38] guarded by him
[1:42] may god rest his gallant soul
[1:45] and may god rest the lives
[1:48] minds and souls of these various
[1:52] veterans that have given themselves
[1:55] to preserve the and protect the
[1:58] freedoms and the liberty that we
[2:02] enjoy but there's another liberty
[2:06] that i am going to speak on now
[2:11] and this is found in the book of
[2:13] revelation chapter 2
[2:15] verse 7 and it reads thus
[2:19] he that had an ear to hear
[2:23] let him hear what the spirit saith
[2:27] unto the churches to
[2:30] him that overcome it will
[2:33] i give to eat of the tree of life
[2:38] which is in the midst of the
[2:41] paradise of god
[2:45] hallelujah father we thank you for the
[2:48] reading of your word
[2:50] we pray father as you water the word
[2:52] with the blessed
[2:54] holy spirit reigns we pray
[2:57] father that it will come forth and be a
[3:01] blessing to every
[3:02] heart life and mind and may you
[3:05] be lifted up and glorified as
[3:09] we surrender ourselves to thee for
[3:12] service
[3:13] in the name of jesus christ our lord
[3:16] amen tonight i'd like to
[3:20] speak on the overcoming life
[3:25] the overcoming life as our scripture has
[3:29] said
[3:31] to him that overcome it will i
[3:34] give to eat of the tree of life
[3:38] which is in the midst of the paradise
[3:42] of god think of it
[3:45] the tree of life in the
[3:48] garden of eden out of which
[3:52] came death but yes
[3:56] what a blessed thought that
[3:59] the tree of life was standing
[4:02] there in the garden of eden
[4:08] but this tree could not be approached
[4:12] on because of the fall of man
[4:15] they could not approach the tree anymore
[4:21] and adam was not and could not become
[4:25] an overcomer because
[4:28] he had fallen away
[4:32] from that tree
[4:35] and now the flaming sword
[4:39] of the guardian angels
[4:43] the flaming swords of those cherubims
[4:49] that were always there
[4:53] around the throne around the tree of
[4:55] life
[4:56] to protect the weight to the tree of
[4:59] life
[5:01] with their flaming swords
[5:04] their swords had been
[5:07] cheated or kept in their sheets
[5:12] but it was
[5:16] kept in the sheet because my friends
[5:20] its blade was now bloody
[5:23] with the blood of the lamb of god
[5:29] think of it the tree of life
[5:32] was denied to adam
[5:36] and his all of his descendants for adam
[5:38] was a representative man
[5:41] who represented the entire human race
[5:45] whatever he did or had done
[5:49] reflected upon every person
[5:53] that came of this human race
[5:57] but thank god we are now
[6:01] allowed once again
[6:04] to go and eat from the tree of life
[6:08] because of the shed blood
[6:11] of the lamb which allowed
[6:15] the cherubims to step aside
[6:20] and to make way for god's people
[6:23] and god's bride to eat from the
[6:27] tree of life
[6:30] why could not adam eat from the tree
[6:35] at first they were commanded to and then
[6:37] after he could not eat from the tree
[6:41] and i see according to the word it
[6:44] was because of sin
[6:47] it was because
[6:50] of him bypassing the word of god
[6:55] he could not go to that tree
[6:58] of life to eat you see my friends
[7:04] adam lived in a state of continuous
[7:09] fellowship with god before the fall
[7:15] he lived a marvelous and wonderful life
[7:19] of where he was in constant connection
[7:23] constant fellowship
[7:26] a constant reception
[7:29] of continuous revelation
[7:33] into the mind of god whatever god
[7:37] wanted done whatever god wanted said
[7:40] whatever it was adam had that connection
[7:45] which was later broken by the fall
[7:50] oh man so he lived
[7:53] in a state of continuous connection
[7:58] and revelation in the presence
[8:02] of god and so is every overcomer
[8:08] when a person comes to the place
[8:12] where god recognizes them and they
[8:16] recognize themselves that they have
[8:19] broken into once again
[8:22] the mind of god the truth of god the
[8:25] revelation of god the spirit
[8:28] of god then they begin
[8:31] to live in a state
[8:35] of grace a state of continuous reception
[8:40] of revelation pouring out
[8:44] from god unto them
[8:48] for what was once given to
[8:51] adam is now
[8:54] given to the believers
[8:59] that will stay with the word in the word
[9:03] and walk with the word of the living god
[9:08] what was the night adam because of the
[9:10] fall
[9:11] is now restored reinstated
[9:15] to those who will accept his promised
[9:19] word for this hour
[9:23] now i would want to encourage you to
[9:26] read study or listen to
[9:29] the sermon how can i
[9:32] overcome by our precious brother william
[9:36] marion branham you'll find in our
[9:40] text today that the overcomer
[9:44] is promised by god
[9:48] that he would once again eat from the
[9:51] tree of life
[9:53] but that is not the only promise given
[9:55] to overcomers
[9:58] we find that in revelation
[10:02] chapter 2 verse 11
[10:05] that the god promises the overcomer
[10:08] that he shall not be hurt by the second
[10:12] death
[10:13] thank god also in
[10:17] revelation chapter 2
[10:20] verse 17 god said i will permit him
[10:25] to eat of the hidden manna praise
[10:28] god hallelujah the overcomer
[10:32] is also promised revelation chapter 2
[10:36] verse 26 that i will
[10:40] give him a white stone
[10:43] oh thank god hallelujah
[10:46] and that he will have power
[10:49] over the nations praise
[10:53] god it doesn't say denominations here it
[10:56] says
[10:56] nations but he will give you
[11:00] power over the nations
[11:03] according to revelation chapter 2
[11:06] and verse 26.
[11:10] in revelation 3 verse 5
[11:13] god says of these overcomers
[11:17] that i will clothe them
[11:21] with raiment white raiment
[11:24] bright and fair thank god
[11:28] the overcomer are those who have walked
[11:31] through
[11:32] this filthy dirty blackened
[11:36] world and came out
[11:39] with their robes white and clean
[11:43] yes these are they who
[11:46] washed their robes and made them
[11:49] white in the blood of the lamb for they
[11:52] have
[11:52] overcome in the name of the lord jesus
[11:56] christ
[11:57] glory to god hallelujah revelation
[11:59] chapter 3 verse 12
[12:03] to the overcomer i will make him a
[12:06] pillar
[12:07] in the temple of our my god so here
[12:11] is the overcomer with his white robe
[12:15] being a pillar not hurt by the second
[12:18] death
[12:18] able to go in and eat from the tree of
[12:22] life
[12:23] and then we find i will set
[12:26] he will i will bring him to set with me
[12:30] with in the in my throne praise
[12:33] god hallelujah that overcome again is no
[12:37] one else but the wife the bride of jesus
[12:39] christ
[12:40] who has overcome the world of flesh
[12:44] and the devil and now she stands
[12:47] sits by the word she is settled in her
[12:51] position
[12:52] of who she is side by side
[12:56] with the word of god jesus christ
[12:59] thanks be to god hallelujah
[13:02] now of course we know that god's
[13:04] original
[13:05] intention for his creation
[13:09] man what's the expression is to express
[13:13] his words amen
[13:17] now in genesis adam was given
[13:20] the word of god to live by as we are
[13:23] given the word of god
[13:25] to live by and any life
[13:29] lived by the word of god becomes the
[13:33] word of god expressed or the word of god
[13:37] in expression or manifestation
[13:40] or thanks be to god that's not back only
[13:44] in the bible
[13:45] that's here right now to anyone
[13:49] that will surrender their lives into
[13:52] the power permit preeminence
[13:55] and control and prisonership
[13:59] of jesus christ to him be
[14:02] glory and praise and honor forever
[14:05] and ever praise god
[14:09] adam lived by that word
[14:13] but yet he was not an overcomer
[14:16] because he did not live by every word
[14:21] for god requires us to pay heed
[14:25] and to live by every word
[14:28] of god my friends i want to say to you
[14:33] that the very best of the entire human
[14:36] race
[14:37] from adam on down to christ
[14:40] everyone failed to try
[14:44] to live by every word
[14:47] of god we know
[14:50] adam failed because he
[14:54] listened to the voice of his wife
[14:57] he bypassed the word knowing full well
[15:01] what he was doing
[15:02] but he failed god and failed god's word
[15:08] we realize moses failed
[15:14] because moses my friends got angry
[15:19] david failed because of his adultery
[15:22] according to god's word
[15:26] but we find hebrews chapters
[15:29] 1 and chapters 2 that there came
[15:33] one there came a mighty one
[15:37] there came a man named jesus
[15:41] who overcame and live
[15:44] by every word of god
[15:48] for hebrews 1 and 2 if you
[15:52] will take your time to read those
[15:55] chapters
[15:56] you will find out that jesus
[16:00] being still being a man yet he was
[16:04] greater than the angels
[16:08] jesus the man christ jesus
[16:11] approved of god anointed of god used of
[16:15] god
[16:16] god lived in him he was the fullness
[16:19] of the godhead bodily he was
[16:23] wonderful cause of the mighty god
[16:26] everlasting
[16:27] father and the prince of peace
[16:31] of course we know there are not three or
[16:33] four everlasting fathers
[16:34] but here we find out praise god
[16:38] that he was greater than the angels he
[16:41] was the creator of the angels
[16:43] oh he was greater than the high priest
[16:47] he was the one that ordained the high
[16:49] priest
[16:50] praise be to god he was greater than
[16:53] moses
[16:54] and all the prophets gloried be to his
[16:57] precious
[16:58] name and then he was greater
[17:01] than all the kings for he is the
[17:04] king of kings and lord of lords
[17:08] he wasn't his greater than all the wise
[17:12] men
[17:13] of the earth amen greater than solomon
[17:18] for he said that greater than solomon is
[17:21] here
[17:22] oh my he was greater than daniel
[17:26] daniel is spoken of because of his
[17:29] wisdom
[17:30] and because of the anointing and his
[17:32] judgment
[17:33] but this one hallelujah
[17:36] was not uh was god in flesh
[17:41] and so he was greater than danielle
[17:44] praise god hallelujah i'm thank god
[17:48] that jesus is greater i said jesus
[17:51] is greater our lord is greater he is
[17:54] greater than
[17:55] anyone anybody and anything
[17:58] that has ever come upon this earth
[18:01] glory to god for he never failed
[18:05] amen he never failed and will never
[18:09] fail and that means that when he
[18:12] lived by every word of god for he said
[18:16] it is
[18:16] written it is written it is written amen
[18:20] and satan was foiled he was defeated
[18:24] and and destroyed by jesus christ
[18:28] making the word of god expressed
[18:32] and manifested from his mouth
[18:36] here he was here was one
[18:40] that despite all the tricks and traps
[18:43] and tribulations and trials of satan
[18:46] here was one who overcame them
[18:49] proving that those who would follow
[18:52] him and would accept him in their lives
[18:57] can and will also overcome
[19:00] for he who has already overcome
[19:04] will be living in them to overcome
[19:08] any trail that our tribulation
[19:11] test trick trap or whatever temptation
[19:14] that satan will bring
[19:16] they would overcome it by the one who
[19:19] has already overcome
[19:20] that lives in them and makes them
[19:24] overcomers by his grace by his
[19:27] presence and by his power within
[19:31] their lives thanks be to god that in
[19:34] this fullness of time
[19:36] he came along he jesus
[19:39] jesus the christ jesus
[19:43] the head or headship
[19:46] of the spiritual body of the living god
[19:51] oh praise god amen
[19:55] so he overcame and he was
[19:58] god's in other words god's masterpiece
[20:02] he was like the blueprint of god from
[20:06] which
[20:06] all others could uh
[20:09] could line up their lives into the
[20:13] structure
[20:14] of a perfect to be a perfect man of the
[20:17] perfect man

[20:35] being a perfect clean
[20:39] reflection of the fullness
