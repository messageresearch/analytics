God good morning and may God richly bless us all here today we're very happy to be in the house of the Lord please be seated just for a moment is with great uh sadness of course we'd like for you to know of the passing of sister Elaine uh Brennan's mother she's gone on to be with the Lord and just to let you know that so that when you see her again you may be able to express your heart's feelings amen so it's good to be here we want to consider the word of God for us today last week of course um we had a good time in the presence of the Lord and we've come on to be with him now once again next week uh trust in the Lord will be together again here giving Glory To His Marvelous and wonderful name amen praise the Lord I hardly saw you in the back layer sister God bless you my condolences amen praise the Lord God bless you everyone thank you so much for your service to the Lord God bless you richly today we want to go back to the Book of Exodus and we'd like to read from Exodus chapter 20. and reading verses 1 2 6. it's very familiar I know you're aware of it but just something that the Lord of course the prophet knew all of this but it only breaks to you when you need to know it and I thank the Lord for it Exodus 1 scriptures will go up there no doubt and God spake all these words saying I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down to thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and showing Mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments let us pray our righteous Heavenly Father Grant utterance and may the Holy Spirit bless our hearts together as we come to the banqueting house of God and a feast from the Lord's table and a drink from his Fountain thank you Lord for this last serving of the wine we give you glory and honor and praise father that we were chosen to participate in this time of the wedding Feast May the Holy Spirit bless us as we gather with one purpose father to hear Thy word to glorify thy name and carry out the mission you've given us here on the earth be asking in Jesus name amen and amen hallelujah God bless you everyone please be seated the thought that I would like I will be bringing today is based on the thought of images because you remember God in the scripture here says you shall not uh you know have any graven images a direct command from God now you've got churches founded on worshiping images you got churches uh founded on worshiping idols but lest we think they are alone they are not alone for brother Branham said it's in the heart of man to worship and he has to worship something and when he doesn't know what he has to worship he is now groping to find what he should worship so he's searching and heal he he'll carve something and try to call that God and worship it because he's in spiritual ignorance not knowing who he should worship uh uh if it's an alligator as the prophet starts where he said you go to Africa you go to India you go to various places he says you'll see them carving Idols images their carbon image of a crocodile and they'll even throw their babies in the river for the crocodile to eat believing that it's God or a monkey or or or you'll find um all these a snake or a woman you know a Venus or Isis whoever but they'll carve a shape they'll carve a form that they believe that is God and they need to worship it that is not necessarily a form for condemnation but it's a revelation of ignorance and not knowing when the real true God is revealed to you and you refuse to recognize it or to accept him that is when God turns his wrath upon the third and fourth generation as he has mentioned here for them that hate them because they completely refuse him and want nothing to do with him we're speaking about images and we know we are living in a day of modern paganism it's the most paganistic age we can think about we look back at the people worshiping Stone Idols wooden Idols whatever feathers feathers Idols Birds snakes such a fish in the sea of fish God fire god whatever and there are still religions based on those things today we know it what do you call it zorasterism what do you call it Catholicism what do you call different names and they're worshiping different idols and they try to polish it and tell you that by worshiping that you know it's holy right oh my but now we see paganism even in the natural world because there's the worship of screen idols that is now going on but it doesn't seem serious to the people because they don't actually have an object sitting there that they are bowing down before to worship it it seems like the past Satan is cunning Satan is slick and slimy he knows how to present things so he presents to you uh an idol a screen Idol or some Idol of ever whatever form or field you may be in your idol may be an academic your idol might be an actor an actress a dancer a singer or whatever that couldn't be your idol that you have in your heart and you become of fanatic for that Idol oh my I'm glad my idol is Christ Hallelujah and that I can be a fanatic to him and for him because we went back there with the apostles when they were in the Attic the upper room but right now we have entered the upper room of the revelation of the word of God and therefore we are here to worship enter praise and glorify this marvelous name now God made it plain because he has to do with God has to do with images because he said I met man in my own image right praise God but the devil switched that and caused people to think an image has got to be something physical you see in front of you it's got to be an idol on a wall or something or the other but he's really perverted what God was trying to tell his people right it's perverted it into that glory to God but when you say Idol praise God when you say image what are you talking about now in the book called The Masterpiece brother Branham says you see alangelo had to carve these statues for the Catholic church at that particular time I think I mentioned a few weeks ago how they would see him sometimes standing on the side of the roadway and he's looking at a big rock and gazing at it and people will be wondering what in the world is this man going mad he's looking at a rock and seeing what he could why is he staring at a rock and they asked them Michelangelo why are you staring at this rock he says because I see an angel in that rock right he's seeing an angel in that rock now I'm bringing the thought here which is how it first came to me amen that before any man any human any person can carve an image before they can even put a chisel to a stone they have first of all got to see the image in their mind they got to have a visual image in their mind first of all just like how I had an image of you of every one of you God saw you before the foundation of the world and he had he had an image of you in his mind in his heart before you even got here he said I knew you before you become flesh I know you in other words before you were formed in your mom's womb he said I knew you before you come flesh or visible I already seen you and I knew you and you were in my heart praise God I want you to know you're in God's heart to this living moment that we are living here today praise God so an image the image God is talking about is us the scriptures as I've got to divert again praise God hallelujah now no man has seen God at any time and lived we haven't seen God but yet we were made in His image and in his lightness In His Image spiritually in his likeness physically later on we made in her in his likeness this of course is not the image of God we know that it's a kind of a likeness of it but it's not the image the real image is that Gene that germ the seed that's in your heart that's the real image of God or part of the image not to be precise but the fact is God is unseen and so for God to be seen Hallelujah then he must be able to make himself manifest through his word glory to God one place brother Branham said see I have the quotations here if you don't mind sometimes I'll quote if I feel like it if not I have the quotations here where he says clearly he said you know that how the devil works the devil will work and first of all he'll give some witch doctor a vision they'll go into some place where there's smoking cannabis uh well marijuana that's a very decent name to put to it but they'll be smoking the peace grass or the sweet grass or whatever and uh they're doing it under the it's the devil but they're doing it under the disguise of religion they are doing it under this guise of serving God which God you see but they don't say that yes you're serving God but it's the God of this evil age that will give them a vision and what they will do is from the image that they were given in their thoughts or in their hearts or in their imagination they will now carve a visible Idol a visible mask a visible up a picture right a photograph of course is an idol do but anyway we find out brother sisters that's what it is that that will happen and then by bowing down to serve that they think they are serving that thing or that person that they saw in their spirit when they were in that Vision or in that dream and that's what they're doing in that kind of a way now just to think of it let me put it this way here that quoting brother Branham you see Moses lifted up a brass serpent in the wilderness and so must the son of man be lifted up for the same reason now the serpent was God's provided way for healing for many many years for them and after the serpent the images the people got to worshiping the image of the serpent instead of looking to what that serpent what it stood for right they worship the image of it rather than what it stood for you see what I'm saying in other words those eyeballs Visions those which doctors those priests those whatever they call themselves receive and then their carbon image which is an angel whether it's a obsessed whether it's Mary whether it's Jupiter whether it's Isis whether it's Venus they carve whatever they might have seen but they don't realize what that thing stood for they don't realize what is back of it what is it all about amen praise God but you see they missed it they began to worship and make the image of it we have them even today making the images of it on a little cross and holding it up still believing that it's it's the symbol of healing right see they don't realize the ages of change times have gone on is this making any sense here okay praise the name of the Lord you see for when God made man he made him first in his own image which is a spirit image but when man put in five senses remember he didn't give that for man to declare him he gave him it to contact his Earthly home you see and the scientific part of them their tasty smell feel hair but that was only to contact their Earthly home but the Inside Man see that man which is Spirit must contact God do you believe that see oh and science knows nothing about that or think of it man see we say you look at the man and you say oh look at that man so religious he's in the image of God that is not the image of God to begin with that is not just the image of animal life see that's the way it is oh praise God hallelujah oh my hour after hour day after day our lord Jesus has done his work but it will be wonderful someday when we set over there under them evergreen trees down by the stream of life where we'll all be all arms will be stacked Wars will be over the smoke will be gone away no more war no more trouble no more heartaches all gone no more old age when our feet hits that Blissful Shore every gray-headed mother or father will turn back to young men and young women again praise God if you don't want to say amen I think I'm going to say amen amen amen see the atoms of your body will all be destroyed there will be broken up and that contamination from it will have to run away into the air amen that spirit that will then return back and the Rapture will pick up every one of those Clans atoms and that body will be formed again in an immortal image of the Living God hallelujah praise God Amen so now you're going to have a theophany inside this body that is gone God is going to uh reconstruct right you have spiritual reconstruction and the theophany the the immortal will then come back in what was Mortal but it will be oh he said what a wonderful time that will be praise the Lord now the first man he met the first man in His image and we are to return back to that image see that's right because that is our first created image your theophany your theophany is your first created image and we all have to go right back to that Eternal Immortal image that God created us in amen not the image that Satan falls him is as yet and created you and tell you you are that the way you behave you are that uh the way you act you know maybe your race maybe your culture maybe your language the devil separates everything and breaks everything up oh you are that you're different you are that you are that and God is saying no I have Men book of Acts I have made men of all the Earth of all nations of one blood amen they are children of the most high yet Children of the Living God so regardless what do we come from the East the West the north the South wherever we come from amen we are the redeemed of God Gathering back in to go back to the immortal image amen for this Mortal must put on immortality amen praise be the God hallelujah amen now when God created me I mean me William Branham I was there before the foundation of the world so were you do you believe that but my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of any of that see as far as I know but I was there oh I hope you're getting it now Jesus told his disciples he knew them before the foundations of the world in one scripture says Jesus told them he said I had Joy with you before the foundation of the world praise the Lord he had Joys with them amen Paul says he chose us in him before the world began do you believe that amen praise God now there was some part of me of you of Arman Neville of all the rest of you who believe that are here that's in Christ before the world ever began see there was a part of us right there here's my analysis of that I think the people today are possessed see possessed with this Spirit or part of these Angelic being these Spirits which rotated of God that never fell in the beginning and there were the ones that resisted the devil's lie when they were up in heaven but then sent down here amen because they are spirits that rotated of God or like Sparks from the Anvil oh praise God we come from him that is why I I had the thought before but this is why I was saying if you're lied with the devil up there you're gonna lie down here if you fought God when you were in his presence up there you'll fight him when you're done here you resist him in every way because you are on that side and you're identifying yourself where you come from and who you really are amen praise the name of the Living God now oh praise His name now think of it friends one day we find that the atoms of this body will be destroyed broken up and formed back into an immortal image of the Living God Amen now do you know how many times mothers and dads when they are dying they turn around and they begin to recognize those who have already gone on before have you ever any of you ever witnessed anything like that already they start calling to uncles and aunts and they see their cousin over there in the sea there aren't over there and you think something is wrong with them nothing is wrong with them they're crossing over and they're starting to see in the other land rather than seeing back here they're seeing in the other land so they're talking about what they're seeing in the other land let me tell you whether you believe it or not there's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever and will only reach that Shore by Faith's degree one by one will gain the portal there to dwell with the Immortals when they rent them gold and bells for you and me oh praise God I don't know about you but I can hear the gospel Bells now ringing I can hear the word the ring in the word ringing out to my spirit and I recognize what is really happening amen praise God forevermore yes sir how wonderful to know that now here's the Glorious part on the return of Jesus at the resurrection it won't be that body that body then that supernatural being that God had in the beginning that will return to the Earth to get another body a body not born by a woman see but created by God to never get old never to have any Rickles amen never to have any wrinkles never to have gray hairs on your head think of it but a body that will be perfect forever oh hallelujah oh brother that should make me shout or even on a hot night I will shout him according him here oh this robe of Flesh I'll drop and rise to seize that Everlasting prize and Shout while passing through the air amen what have I got to worry about the whole plan is right here before us if we can see it God created us in the beginning we come down on the Earth and I I have taken my place in that plan as a gospel preacher amen or you take your place as a man or woman with salvation we live this life by the grace of God are you living by the grace of God are you living by the grace of God hallelujah hallelujah he says and that same Spirit here that was back up yonder in the very beginning I'll go right back to the consciousness of knowing that I've been there Hallelujah and then went there blessed forever and then when returning back I'll take up my body in this very peak of death before death ever Struck it amen it's transformed Hallelujah that strikes you do you know this that death already strikes you when you are 22 or 23 years old you already start failing you just don't know it you are not the man or the woman you used to be after you get about 25 things begin to set in wrinkles begin to come under your eyes you can't wash like you used to 30 you know this is a whole lot more but you wait till you are 54 like me and then you'll really start noticing it oh brother oh and that's not even it wait till it gets to empty [Music] 90 by then you have some cane trying to hold your stand up and hold yourself up what is it God just put me in the restaurant but some glorious day while death is setting in it'll take me where I was once stretch shouldered had black hair on my head a head full of it and no wrinkles Hallelujah that means you won't be bald anymore you have your own full head of hair like you used to have it amen oh praise God even women some of their hair start to drop off but God said you'll come right back for a full head of hair you'll come back to a perfect body come back to perfect health no more wrinkles no more gray hairs no more suffering no more crying no more of this stuff anymore because he said you serve me here and I'll take you right back to that amen amen hallelujah oh praise God let me say my shoulders drooping body sometimes shrinking see sometimes some of us getting fat sometimes wrinkles under our eyes others go about bald-headed that's death what's it doing for me about the last 20 years that's doing it but wait till I get to 80 if God lets me live I'll be standing like this and I'll maybe have an egg you shaking like that while I'm trying to hold on to my cane right that is human life then when I rise in the resurrection I'll be what I used to be what I was what God made me to be here I'll be at my very best inner body not a body I'm talking about that God used that made by Mr and Mrs Branham but a body that God created himself somebody praise God some God will give glory to God amen and that body that he created free from Temptations free from sin a body free from anything else never to have sickness or heartache oh my oh praise God then I'll take a hold of my wife's hands and walk down through Paradise together some of us dream of walking through Paradise down here but you know you have to wait sometimes to walk through that paradise up there amen you'll do the same thing oh my praise God hallelujah oh my listen let me tell you let me be in other words brother bran is going to be frank he said I'm not talking about leading around that old gray-headed woman you're leading around tonight and maybe calling your wife but she'll be just as beautiful as she was the day you married her at the altar Hallelujah that's enough to make a fellow shout and that's what I'm talking about that's what we're going back to you I said that's what you're going back to is that right we got to serve our time here on Earth and all these things we go through Amen in other quotes that Prophet mentioned which I can't give you everything here but he says the trails the toils you go through it says it's like a picture going through the dark room he said that's only to develop you that is only to cause you to grow that's only to cause you to come back to the perfect clear image of what you was amen praise God them things only come to shape you and form your praise the name of the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah amen now you see that's the connection God is determined and when God makes up his mind to do anything nothing can stop him Satan spoiled his picture see he spoiled it by placing sexual desire into the picture by the woman to bring forth children and he spoiled it so go ahead make it that's all right nothing is wrong amen but you find out see that you'll do this life is to pick up your form an image of what you are if you are redheaded now you will be redheaded then if you're blackheaded now you will be black-headed then see what was your best Satan interrupted that picture and you didn't even get to that God intend you to be but on that day you'll be that oh how glorious that's the way it is amen praise God and this is where he mentions again about Michelangelo and how carving the statue of Moses uh and and then it got so perfect that he took a hammer and struck it amen well Hebrews 1. Paul speaking Jesus Christ higher than Angels higher than priesthood than the priesthood higher than every other order that there was before for he is the expressed image perfect Express image of God amen so Jesus was how God the invisible God the invisible God could make himself visible so he can be seen and known by his creation glory to God hallelujah oh my and just like Michelangelo was so inspired when he saw that statue of Moses it was so perfect you know he wanted it to speak and he took a hammer and he struck it and said speak of course the idol couldn't speak but God was foreshadowing Isaiah 53 how he says that he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for art with iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed for Jehovah struck him Hallelujah Jehovah struck him and he allowed him to put him on Calvary and this struck him amen praise God but that was just so their life could come out in the world in the form of the Holy Spirit and be available to every one of us here today for in him was all of the fullness of the godhead bodily so nobody could be filled with the Holy Ghost before he was crucified because all of it was in him but from moment he gave his life the life came out the Bible says the Holy Ghost came out of him he gave up the what the ghost the spirit he gave that up and it came forth and he says go wait and Jerusalem for the promise of my father my father who is the promise is going to come to you amen promised amen I'm so glad for that promise of the father hallelujah praise the Lord see God in Statue of a perfect man he says what I'm talking about not some Dead image on a wall and you bow down before that you wash a pic some Idol some piece of rock or some piece of wood but he said living images of a living God is that right he says think of it not man walking with a robe on and bells ringing on the bottom of that robes there amen but living beings who are these living images living beings with the Life of Christ in them and the gospel bells ringing off of their soul crying out holy holy holy holy holy Holiness unto the Lord that's what we're talking about here this morning that we are here as living representation of this unseen being whom we never seen with our eyes but he has allowed us to be created and be here as living images of a living God not to be idols on a wall but to be men and women that can be living in this character living with his nature and walking on the face of the Earth so that the world can have an idea of who he is praise the name of the Lord O praise God hallelujah oh my puts me in mind of the church no matter how much you substitute no matter how big a congregation you can get no matter how well you can have them sing your songs no matter how you good you can have them dress oh and you can say you got this we got that we got the other you could strike feel whatever it will never take the place of the Life of Christ in an individual come down in the form of the Holy Ghost into the church itself and gives it a new experience of them being born again it will never take the place of God's word for God's words stands alone and when the word is in you it stands alone you don't necessarily have to go around and talk this and tell that and try to convince this and convince us you are who you are [Applause] truth is stated truth in other words no matter what you say about the truth the truth doesn't change the truth just stands there and you have to deal with it it doesn't have to fight it doesn't have to do anything it's the truth and it just stands there and when you are a True Believer you don't have to fight you don't have to fuss you don't have to nothing you stand right there with the word of God and the power of the Holy Spirit pouring out of your life glory to God hallelujah Blessed Be His holy name oh praise God my poor decrepit friend come to Jesus Christ you heard his voice some of you are just children some of you are old God has called your heart you've come here to worship God and to surrender your life to him you could not have raised up out of your seat unless he called you no man can come unto me unless my father draws him Hallelujah has the father drawn you has the father drawn you oh praise God the the all of the word has called out to the rest of the word the words he is the word we are words of of life that come from his presence amen oh my God made Hallelujah God made promises we'll see each other again in the great glory land Yonder do you believe that where the all will be young there forever sickness and sorrow will vanish away in his presence and we will be back like we were in his likeness Hallelujah you're in the likeness of your mother and your father another place he says we are in the likeness of of animals right he says you gotta hand like a monkey you got feet like a bear you got death and he was making those comparisons saying we are from the Animal Kingdom in your natural uh form certain pervert the whole thing when we should have remained in his likeness Satan perverted and there came Cain and Abel so it went from creation to procreation and then we start coming forward he says in the image of Mr uh and Mrs uh Branham or whoever your parents were we come out in that image he says but that's not your real image that one is going to be broken up and you're going back to the original image that God gave you and you you buy from therefore the foundations of the world [Music] Hallelujah because when you are in his likeness when you are confirmed amen into his image then you see that one never goes old never goes gray just young and Youthful forever o praise God are you listening to the Holy Spirit that brought you Amen to the Earth and give you a choice to make a choice the chance to make a choice here you come and make that choice what choice are you making here today will you serve him will you serve him will you love him will you walk with him oh every step of the way may his great Holy Spirit call out to his children amen not my calling out but the Holy Spirit himself taken the words that I'm speaking and calling out to your heart and letting you know you're one of his own your mind your mind you don't belong to the world you don't belong to that denomination over there you don't belong to some certain belief or concept You Belong To Me the word amen God calling out by his Spirit calling to his own praise God back to the word back to the original position you are in that part of the word you are of Amen yes sir hallelujah amen I want you to come and believe him and believe his word amen praise the name of the Lord glory to God then some say if you pack an image of Christ in your car if you pack an image of Christ or a picture of Christ on the wall you're that's the sign of that person is really a Christian this is brother Brandon here right we arrive at this now but he was saying it back then right he says picture on the wall and all these things it's nice then things are all right you see you see nothing's wrong with that but I don't believe packing an image makes you a Christian I believe that being and living being the image of Christ makes you a question Hallelujah you have the culture of Christ in you the life the nature of Jesus Christ in you that's what makes you a Christian not just saying I'm a Christian and that makes you a Christian amen not just talking it or or going to church being religious makes you a Christian but literally my friends having the nature of Christ forming through you it's not what we do therefore outwardly it's what's happened to you inwardly that makes you what you are and who you are therefore if he is our image we are then to be in his likeness is that right I feel like singing now praise the Lord let's sing to be like Jesus you caught that praise the Lord hallelujah let's sing it together Amen to be like Jesus put up the words to be Jesus on Earth on Earth I long to be like him like him all true life's journey all true life from Earth to Glory from Earth to Glory oh I only ask Lord hallelujah to me like him from bethlehem's Manger came forth they had never seen a life like that on Earth I long to be like him [Music] my faithful Savior My faithful say how rich his favor his Mercy on Earth I long [Music] what have you seen of Jesus Christ so that when you live you are projecting a life that you already seen whether by in prayer whether when you're in just House of God what does God reveal to you so that you can go out and live or project that life that God has given to you so you can become a living image of the Living God and that is what God wants every one of us to be not the idol on the wall the prophet said but to be the living image of him amen now this you can go there's lots of scriptures be transformed it tells you it tells you about changing from one image from Glory unto Glory you're changing into his image and becoming perfected in that image until you step right into the glory of God hallelujah into the fullness of him many of the scriptures Colossians Ephesians over there in even Revelation praise God hallelujah amen oh my I may have to just jump to show you that uh right there is why he's talking about the last days how that we find that the church will never Bow Down to the image of the Beast and every time he talks about that he goes back and refers to Danielle and he talks about Nebuchadnezzar right Hallelujah see Nebuchadnezzar simply like being a type of the devil and what did he do this is how we seduced uh them and I have the quotation here where he talks about you see what Nebuchadnezzar did to be able to deceive and trap the people was to make an image with the form of a Godly sacred Godly Man that they all recognize and he made it plain he says that man was Danielle he made an image of the prophet of that day now I'm seeing if only this morning what I'm studying I see what he really was telling is going to come so we can almost prophesy like they did with Daniel the pope already recognized brother Branham you know do you know that the popes put in the Catholic Digest when that man was alive the very grung the walk-on was blessed they may not I'll come and say we agree with this he said that we agree with that you agree well one thing they know there was never a life since Jesus Christ on this Earth other than when that man came and said thus saith the Lord amen hallelujah so what actually is prophecy is that it's gonna it's swinging around and it's coming right back until they're going to say yes this man William Branham 20th century Prophet what he said was true and he always keep repeating that he said they always recognize prophets and sacred people after they killed them and after they're dead then they recognized that they were being told the truth but they already gone he said and then they want to dig them up or make statues of them but what I'm telling you to watch this could it be he was talking about himself that the time will come that this this serpent spirit that was not completely destroyed will come and get to get them to form an image of him and raise it like that to capture all the Protestant world right and even unsuspecting so-called message believers to being in worshiping that and placing their thoughts in that direction but you know Daniel and the four boys who had of course a clear Revelation amen the Bible said there was not bow down and worshiped the golden idol they wouldn't bow and they would bow to not know such a thing amen praise God forevermore brother sister he says clearly bow down to no holy man or no holy Idol or no holy place or no holy cave or no holy Shrine or no holy altar don't bow down to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God Hallelujah he says I Stand Alone none before me none beside me none after me Hallelujah no wonder we have the quotation from the scriptures Hebrews 38 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever him which was which is and yes to come alpha and omega beginning in the end the first and the last almighty God hallelujah do you believe it amen praise God forevermore amen amen hallelujah then if he we are in his likeness members of his body we should be then living and living as images of him amen praise God we should then reflect the image of Christ amen not joinings church or walking around with some crucifix on you or using your emotions to do it it should be living that living presence of the Living God and let that reflect through your life to the world that's what it is let the Life of Christ project through you amen hallelujah Christian means christ-like it means to reflect him amen now when I say that doesn't mean you have to grow a long beard as the artist in the pictures draw him with a beard and that neither does it mean we have to grow long hair to be like Jesus oh my yes sir neither are we to go out wearing some robes like he wore see for we are now living in another day so we don't have to do that amen we don't necessarily have to be that you can do it if you want but you don't necessarily have to do that but we must reflect his image amen we must do it in our souls in our spirit his Spirit image his manner of life I do not believe that Christians consist of just joining Church joining Creeds repeating Creeds but I believe in a living reflection of a living Christ in the heart of that believer amen hallelujah and we are members of this body and we are to Bear His Image amen so to be a Christian then is to be conformed to the image of Christ to be living images not packing on images packing an image an image but you yourself to be a living image of a living God worshiping praising and Magnify Him amen oh that's why I always love that little song Amen oh yes and I want you to help me sing that song here if you can understand help me sing it to be like Jesus to be like Jesus how many heard that song do you know what it means amen oh my you see back then he was trying to get the people to see and to understand what he was talking about he was the only one but thank God he has opened our eyes the eyes of our heart he's opened our minds that we can recognize him and walk with him praise the name of the Living God Amen I'm so conscious of the great Holy Spirit that I couldn't hide from him you couldn't hide from him can you hide from him he said even David said it if I make my bed in hell yet he'll be there with me if he's if he's going to be everywhere and anywhere he's right here today do you believe it oh praise God he knows our every move or every action everything we do every look every thought everything amen he he is with us everywhere and he knows your every care oh praise God hallelujah amen and one day when the trumpet shall sound and the dead begins to rise will be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air praise the name of the Living God hallelujah can I talk with you a little bit more you're just there at that place where I I can feel the amen but now we understand that he's talking about the image of Jesus Christ the image of God Jesus Christ they expressed image of the invisible God and it says the word invisible so that you can understand the invisible whom you can't see not by Idol on the wall but you don't understand him by this Living Image being called Jesus Christ the life he lived and the virtues he expressed by that you'll be able to get a visual you'll also be able to get an emotional and you're able to get his way of life his nature his virtues and values right it'll be coming out through him in that way and that's how we are to be able to worship God but you shall not bow down to a man like yourself you shall not bow down to an idol amen you know an old uh an all-profit told me years ago he says one thing I'll tell you what he told me he's telling me what God told him and he's now telling me on your knees before God but on your feet before other men like yourself you shall not bow down to them nor serve them amen you shall do it amen but you realize that we we all wear the same clothing whether it's a pants or a dress we're human beings and we're all the same praise God it's the holy spirit in our lives that makes the difference amen you may have a bigger position you may have uh human authority but none has a real authority over sons and US of God that doesn't mean that you should go on your job arrogant you should be the most humble you should be the most uh willing and your most willing to carry out your responsibilities and live the way that Jesus lived is that right Pro praise God forevermore amen but we're living a age where uh here like the eagle that was found in the in the zoo they take Eagles and put them in a zoo now they take spiritual Eagles and put them in a church denomination a stained glass windows but they can't get out they're trapped in there with some false made membership it's not membership to some church on Earth is membership to Christ and that membership to Christ can only come repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you amen unto your children as many other are far off that is what it is my brothers and sisters amen amen so people are today trapped into the nominational uh partitions amen I'm mixing scripture with a little bit of digital understanding the devil partition of people's minds oh I'm a Catholic Oh I'm a Baptist oh I'm a matter of assignment of this you'd better be a child of Christ because if it's not it doesn't matter what brand you put on yourself is that right yeah you're going to go and see our loves call who have brands on them brand brand this one said this one is mine you know because it's branded with this Church's name This one belongs to me and there's another brand over there all kinds of Brands like that but the point is there is one man that owned all the ranches with all them brands on them and all them cows and a cattle and a thousand Health belong to him and when the big boss calls you got to bring all them cattle into him that are his and thank God the boss's son has come back with the word and calling in his chips amen he's calling his daughter his child home calling his bride home his people home praise the name of the Lord amen I know I'm speaking a little mixed up here but because so many thoughts that things are passing at the same time he said now think of it the son other sites you could have that here a man who was made to be the image of God to be a Heavenly bird amen you believe God made you to be a Heavenly bird a Heavenly child an ego to fly over the circumstances of this world to fly over all the troubles trials and storms of life you know we're not pilot years ago was telling the story how that he was so shocked when he was in a plane and and and and when he looked there was an eagle oh my goodness they they have to go through so much technology and spend millions of dollars before they can get a plane to fly up there and here was the eagle just going along he says and while he's looking at the ego all of a sudden he saw the eagle turn his head suddenly and looked that way he says my and then he looked ahead and he didn't know why did he look that way and my when he looked at his radar that eagle had already picked up that the storm was up ahead and he just picked it up afterwards on his radar and then he said well he's going to turn back now no that eagle just set his wings and just zoom right into the middle of the storm right into the eye of it and come out the other side that's the way the believer ought to be don't run from your troubles don't run from your fears don't run from your trials walk right into it and God will take you through and you're right out the other side to the eye of the storm oh praise God hallelujah I thank God that my brother sister that we are a different people amen and be brought here by God Amen think of it by the devil's trickery and the devices of evil men and women caged up think of it their Heavenly Birds and those people know nothing about the ground they are to live in the heavens looking around them what a sad sight when God created them in his his image and then they take them and cage them into denominations and various ways of believing caged into places where they can't be free but thank God God these heaven-sent ones the spirit of God is in them oh thank God I believe the spirit of God is in me amen hallelujah or they can't get out when you look on the streets that is what you see men and women all immorally dressed in the streets caged up whoa some in the saloons caged up beat their brains out trying to find answers to their problems oh my trying to get free oh praise God hallelujah oh praise God that's what it is but I tell you they take them sons and of God and those of God put them in a cage wherever they are but their Spirit wants to get out of there amen whatever situations you are in anyone is in anyone that will hear my voice wherever you are don't remain in your cage let the Holy Spirit break you out of there take you out and set you free for the glory of God all he asks is you confess repent and find a manner God will baptize you in the proper name of baptism the name is Jesus Christ Father Son and Holy Ghost are but titles of the one person but Jesus Christ is the name that you must take on hallelujah amen think of that old crow same thing they had him caged tied up so long in that church membership that he can't decide to leave his church when he hears the truth and comes to the truth for them other words went by him and said Johnny Crow come on it's time to go south tribulation coming winter coming let's go south amen oh my but he was so poorly see he couldn't hardly walk amen oh my but then my friends he was tied there he made efforts to come up but he couldn't see but our faith our faith will sometimes be put to a test right to the crucial hour oh my just like Daniel and them boys he won he'll put you into a fiery furnace but Satan couldn't destroy them that he can't destroy you for God's purpose in him wasn't fulfilled and God's purpose in you if it hasn't been fulfilled he can't destroy you amen oh my they could go in there with this Faith saying I know my redeemer liveth Hallelujah they could go in there with that we are assured our God is able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace amen but nevertheless even if he does not we will not bow down to this image amen back there that image now you got to face the image that the a physical image that someday I believe of brother Branham that they will erect and try to capture the religious world to Bow Down and Worship Him to baptize in this name to pray in his name and everything in his name rather than in the name of Jesus Christ see but then the other image right now with your jobs with this I'm just passing over these things but with your jobs with this and that create a society uh us brother Aubrey priest many years ago the devil created Society where you got to go out and work you got to do this you got you're enslaved into doing that but praise God but God's fit civilization is coming amen God's faith civilization is coming praise the name of the Lord so then you must have faith that's that's that Civilization is coming so that you don't bow down to the image of the Beast because the image of the Beast is in formation right now and when he says he's telling us back there in Exodus 2 but you know that's prophecy speaking all the way down through time telling you don't bow down to no image whether it be Woodstone this that whether the main a social image or whatever don't bow down whether she don't bow down to no Idol right so the image of the Beast is forming and we are not about down to it even if they try to tell you you're going to go into a tribulation even if they try to tell you you're going to burn in a fiery furnace we will not bow down to him nor worship Him we will not do it right now he's in spirit just like God is in spirit see but he's because another place he said don't you realize that even God is a spirit you can't see him and the devil is not a thought even though he tries to get people to think he's just an evil thought he said the devil is just as much of a person as God is a person only that God is the Eternal one and the Devil is a creation and the devil is going to be cast into the lake of fire with all his lying angels that's where he will be in the Years up a come praise the name of the Lord oh I praise God and give him glory for what he has done for me I honor him Magnify Him you realize now I realize that I'm at the limit but I am pushing the envelope because I just want to finish this here quickly I just got a few more pages is that all right I'm just letting you know ahead of time so that you don't get up and walk out on me right but that you stay with the word hallelujah praise the Lord why does God let troubles come have you ever asked yourself that I'm living so good for God at least that's what you think but when he looks at your life he he can see that you think you're perfect but you're a limited human understanding you think you are living perfect right but anyway he said why does God let troubles come you see God harnesses trouble he puts a bit in the mouth of your troubles and makes them obey him those troubles must obey him and he uses them to bring us into a closer fellowship with him you see the reason and purpose of some troubles and trials is to bring us because what's the first thing you do when you stump your toe oh God what is the first thing you do when dire troubles command you you look to the right you look to the left you look around nobody is there to help you you said you wouldn't believe in God but at that moment if there is a God somewhere oh God right away you start talking about God see God lets troubles come and he harnesses it and uses it to bring us closer to him that we could have fellowship with him and talk with him amen or think of it you see that's the way praise God don't you realize that before there could be any rainbow God had to allow the flood to come is that right years ago I preached a message you need a flood right the flood that will wash away all the the you know all the dead bodies and all the stuff hidden up in your closet and so on wash it out praise God before you can see the rainbow Praise of promise but God has to allow troubles to come he has to allow uh floods to come amen and uh you put it this way when it rains it pours it's the same thing see God allows floods to come so that he can take the flood and make a rainbow out of it right and that rainbow within your life praise God hallelujah must I be carried away to home on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody seas oh no we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us and that is trials and tribulations to be formed into his image just think about it I'm going to stop here even though there's much more that I can say here but I'm gonna stop at this point and um just repeat some of what I said here quickly Jesus the express image of God an image is not an idol on a wall because we were made in this image and it wasn't the physical body that was made it was his Spirit image we were made in the spirit image of God Satan uh derailed that plan and change creation to procreation amen and he just kept a a resemblance of what he think uh the image of God would be so we come in the image of Mom and Dad but not this is not in the image of God right the image of God is inside of the Inner Man your soul on the inside praise God before the went and told you that the um Jesus Christ was expressed image of God is that right no I didn't say this before but the woman is a reflection of the man amen and even so the church walks in the image of Christ to reflect Christ to the age in which we are living in perilous times chaotic times that we're living in but in the midst of us all she's here shining his light amen he is the Son and she is the moon and the moon reflects the light of the sun after that the sun has gone down that same God wants to reflect his life through you and me for his glory and for his honor we have no light of our own because man woman born and sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking Lies We have nothing in ourselves we don't have any Holiness of our own doesn't matter how we try to make ourselves look holy appear holy oh my we have no Holiness within ourselves oh blessed be the name of the lord it's his Holiness when he comes to us he and US makes us holy he walks in us and talks with us and we give Glory To His Marvelous name furthermore the church coming in His image gives glory to God but he's telling you the devil already got a a counterfeit of that because you have the image of the Beast made up of the Confederation of churches World consulate churches and all those groups come together trying to form a religious body not the mystical body but forming a religious body and you to be aware of that that that's also an image and we are not about down to that nor servant because that's prophecy that's on the road right now because it's already started this formation right but it's not yet come to its fullness but thank God we have the promise the bride will be brought out of here amen before the tribulation I believe in a pre-tribulation rapture I don't believe in a post or tribulation after the tribulation then he's bring his wife out of the troubles after she's been beat up and bloodied and battered and bruised then he's going to bring her out no I believe that we will not go into the tribulation but God will bring his bride out in a rapture Hallelujah and take us out of here of course we will see no doubt they preamble to the tribulation but the world Fallen apart and the pressures increasing increasing increasing and then in my uh crude way of saying it we'll slip right out of out of uh the devil's hand like a banana slips right out into the presence of God do you believe that are you willing and ready to go I don't mean be committing now uh Jim Jones mass suicide that's not what I'm talking about I'm saying like Jesus said it that we must be ready so that when he calls we are able to answer are your lamps trimmed and burning are you living a life worthy of the Gospel living a life that you can shine your little teeny you may not think you are much but shine your little light in some corner and be a blessing to somebody somewhere oh praise God I'm happy that I can live that life I don't have to go around with a tactical Christianity musicians you can come up now but I can just be on be myself Hallelujah do you know you wake up in the morning and you're going along and you just say Hi how are you just your spirit coming out with the joy and the peace of God somebody else might be dumb and just the way you said that it'll lift their spirit Hallelujah your intention was not to preach or witness or push a track at somebody because you are the living book you become the living epistle you become the gospel amen as close as you live his life the best that you possibly can you're not going to be Mr Mrs Perfection you're going to make mistakes you're going to stumble here you're going to stumble there but he says if you sin you have an advocate you have a lawyer Jesus Christ the righteous and he says if you confess your fault right one to another and confess your fault stay here praise the Lord amen when I say one to another that don't mean go to a priest to confess that means he said if someone has ought against you or you have ought against them go confess to that person confess to that individual that's what what he means there when he's a confess your pulse one to another fervently that you may be healed amen so let's serve the Lord with sincerity in heart and in mind praise the Lord there'll be further announcements of other things and you'll hear about it maybe during the week and God bless every one of you A Mother's Day is coming come on man even if the women don't say Amen Brothers you should be saying amen they're not going to amend themselves they're not going to take their hands and praise themselves oh yeah Mother's Day is coming uh no we have to recognize that right so Mother's Day is coming and we want to celebrate Mother's Day because I'm glad I had a mother and I'm glad I had a Godly mother and I want to give God praise and honor for her amen I'm glad that she was somebody that lived a supernatural life she was one that was hemorrhaging in the hospital and was dying and was given up and with that they expected that they will take her out to next day and should be buried but she tells it of herself she said all I know I woke up and a man in white has his hand upon my head and just turned and looked at me and started walking away but I was still in the Daze and so I said Doctor and just turned and looked again but he kept walking until he disappeared up the ward she said but I don't know what happened not waiting till morning right away I felt well the bleeding stopped everything stopped Hallelujah and I've got to tell you now that you are here talking to me now that you're here and and stuff like that now I'm letting you know this is what happened but thank

minister got struck with covid there was no time for anything else they didn't know where to go and I believe it was sister hope suggested why don't you ask my pastor and so they came and asked and I said sure I will do it from their papers neither one was married so there was nothing to obstruct them or stop them and so we go and they just wanted three people because her mother has to go back to a foreign country and the deadline of the time would be passed so they just wanted if it's three of them could come in here and have their wedding well I'm just letting you know this is what's going
