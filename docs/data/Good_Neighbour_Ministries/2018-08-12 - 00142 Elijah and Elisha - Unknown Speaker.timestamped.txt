[8:37] he is interested in our work and what we
[8:41] did whatever he had to do his interest
[8:44] in ISA posterity in Magnus Hebrews 13:8
[8:51] nori and that's what we need to believe
[8:54] and have any questions I'm going to try
[8:57] to focus here
[8:59] lots of questions we sometimes have more
[9:02] questions than we do and that's roll
[9:05] [Music]
[9:08] sometimes it deceives by you know how is
[9:12] that how's that gonna work or how does
[9:14] that work if you money
[9:16] maybe understood it but getting under
[9:18] student standing in its fullness what a
[9:21] understood it before and that but now
[9:24] that we're living in the fullness of
[9:25] time and then I believe there's a
[9:28] there's a portion for us a double point
[9:30] and then that give us a personal
[9:33] revelation of these things and maybe is
[9:39] yes but it's still an answer and always
[9:46] still an answer if he says yes what he
[9:49] says no lots of questions Amen I I think
[9:53] of a neighbor that's in his eighties and
[9:56] he's a churchgoer he's got these
[9:59] questions about God and he asked me why
[10:02] does God is sovereign God is God you
[10:17] know unless there was something sick
[10:19] then there could be nothing to do we
[10:23] know he he was looking for answers and
[10:25] he said I wrote a letter to God asking
[10:28] why why the lure - August
[10:36] it's his birth and that's so he could be
[10:39] the savior so he can be ideal and here
[11:12] I'm talking with this old boxer and he
[11:21] had a dream that God was creating the
[11:23] university so everything he's not a
[11:26] church-going man he saw God creating
[11:27] everything and God terms company said I
[11:30] want you to work with the work with God
[11:33] with your own spirit first then the
[11:37] property and he's just a blessing all
[11:52] [Music]
[11:59] anyway he said never leave us or forsake
[13:24] us he knows
[13:32] our usual after he'd already saw the
[13:35] duck come down already have that
[13:38] experience and he still is even though
[13:41] my eyes got one film over and that's the
[13:46] way it is today if not careful our eagle
[13:50] eyes that field over with the things of
[13:53] the world with the hardness of the world
[13:55] with the conditions of the world and
[13:58] then looking at the things of the world
[14:00] looking at the internet looking at this
[14:02] looking at that that filmed your eyes
[14:04] over give less sensitive and you can't
[14:08] look to the unseen amen this is we were
[14:13] at the African safari and that was just
[14:18] a wonderful time have the adapter was up
[14:21] there with me enjoyed myself more than

[17:29] [Music]
[17:35] Kennedy we lose it sometimes but it's
[17:40] here for us amen you know there was Paul
[17:44] once I asked the question three times he
[17:46] asked me that the Lord delivereth from
[17:49] his infirmity and a lot of the scholars
[17:52] disagree on that but we know from the
[17:54] Prophet he said it was his eyes his eyes
[17:58] continually weak he said he would have
[18:00] up your eyes for me but he asked
[18:05] him three times in the Lord the answer
[18:09] was the same every time they had
[18:12] sometimes God doesn't even answer and
[18:15] that instrument they answered and Paul
[18:32] you know after he got that answer the
[18:34] third time he said my grace
[18:41] and then I'm glorified in your body
[18:44] calls with this it keeps you humble
[18:58] that's the way we should accept amen and
[19:02] I had a caller that was beautiful that
[19:09] the Prophet says in the eagle stirreth
[19:11] or a mask see said that Sarah Phoenician
[19:15] woman when she was told by Jesus she had
[19:18] a question about her daughter was asking
[19:21] 14
[19:22] what would you have said if he had
[19:25] called you adult yesterday well you
[19:29] understand I'll join the church but not
[19:31] her she knew who she was when she asked
[19:57] if she knew he was named she never was
[20:00] there so she said she knows he was done
[20:03] she said Lord that's right you're so
[20:05] right in that Lord but even the dog just
[20:08] women do you describe
[20:31] and then clean that she clung she's the
[20:34] ones that are Casper your desk for this
[20:37] morning it's here Jesus Christ the same
[20:45] yesterday today and that was it that's
[20:53] what he was waiting for her to do it was
[20:57] pointed out bullying another couple
[21:01] yourself into such a place men don't
[21:03] matter how sensitive you if you're
[21:06] healed instantly if you're healed by
[21:09] degrees if you're like Abraham plus 25
[21:15] years waiting for the cross but a step
[21:17] in a weaker he got stronger all the time
[21:19] it embrace the thought well it has now
[21:29] God just just so that you know that God
[21:34] has promised and you accept it for
[21:37] yourself
[21:38] it's into us you know history operations
[22:01] I used to love inspires work but he was
[22:06] like whatever testify amen so it's time

[22:20] Tennessee God accomplices matter how he
[22:27] comes disappears one you are to ask my
[22:33] question

[22:39] saw delightfully we saw when we saw the
[22:45] revelation
[22:50] Domanick that he was Hebrews 13:8 and
[22:54] that he'd be a top of the ride for this
[22:56] day
[22:57] what's what you see Elijah saw it you
[23:01] know maybe not they can actually see it
[23:04] looking back that the Prophet said if
[23:06] you can't see Christ in every scripture
[23:21] but you know he was he started we know
[23:26] that people who says that it's the same
[23:28] as they take forever so what he's done
[23:30] for you yeah and the public record is
[23:42] more because there's more of us we have
[23:48] to break but we can do for you

[35:06] you know how he walked across the water
[35:09] like walk on water it was a Nokia was a
[35:13] man like us physically but he didn't
[35:20] even have the Holy Ghost when he walked
[35:22] on water I was thinking on those things

[35:26] like a laser by the weight of the cares
[35:30] of life you need to find that place you
[35:34] need to find the place that stupid place

[35:47] then he saw God unto the spirits and I
[35:51] was there as just having this
[35:52] mountaintop experience I was thinking
[35:54] about Peter I thought you know we don't
[35:56] I'm just like the type of person that I
[35:59] learned by my experiences by preached by

[37:43] [Music]
[38:16] [Music]
[38:24] [Music]
[38:36] you said something that's very
[38:38] interesting the Prophet comments on
[38:41] messages but it's what the angel came to
[38:43] do Sakurai's verse 13 of chapter 1 but
[38:49] the angel said unto him if you're not
[38:51] authorized for thy prayers hurt my wife
[38:53] Elizabeth felt envious and have joy
[39:03] gladness many shall rejoice at his birth
[39:05] for he shall be great in the sight of
[39:06] Lord talking to the warrior strong drink
[39:09] and he shall be filled with his with the
[39:11] long-ago sleeper from his mother's womb
[39:13] and many of the tournaments will show
[39:15] returns or their God and he took home
[39:17] before even the spirit and power of the
[39:19] light
[39:27] second coming in there now at four
[39:31] he says to turn the hearts of the
[39:34] father's to the children and that
[39:35] disappeared to the list of other just to
[39:37] make ready a people prepared the floor
[39:38] as I press it onto the evil now we ask
[39:41] the controversial I noticed for an old
[39:44] man and my mother's three hundred years
[39:45] and the angel answered so instead of a
[39:52] blessing he just received and he said I
[40:12] agree brother stand in the presence of
[40:14] God and sent to speak totally to show me
[40:16] these things
[40:35] [Music]

[42:07] eleven even conceived and asked this
[42:11] question and he gets a review teas that
[42:13] you'll be done up in wispy all the dates
[42:16] of these things are performed in there
[42:20] see question wasn't enough this body
[43:23] changes
[43:24] well the same thing
[43:42] you see what changes it's a question of
[43:46] faith this morning what faith do you
[43:48] have do you have the boldness you have
[43:51] the courage to ask for the impossible
[43:54] what do you have me do this one and then
[43:57] I marry being a type of rock she said
[44:05] before me and then she conceived the
[44:10] promise of being a man and we can do the
[44:15] same thing you can give birth this
[44:18] morning to the promises that are yours
[44:21] your faith can give birth this amen how
[44:26] do you want to exercise
[44:32] and I want you to exercise your faith is
[44:35] a kind we see many other examples
[44:39] I thought about David you know that
[44:42] question we had one that Goliath came
[44:44] out and then I wouldn't be seated you
[44:47] know description of somebody sighs and
[44:49] how big he was and all the our memory
[44:52] had and is you know he's declaration
[44:55] that it's the difference flesh but to
[44:57] the foul the air the beasts of the field
[44:59] and they've been comes and he he has a
[45:02] declaration of faith and then they David
[45:06] Santosh Lux slain a line I played a bear
[45:09] and this uncircumcised Philistine those
[45:12] walks right into and I'll cut your head
[45:15] off he said today and feed it to the
[45:17] thought and then so David was in his
[45:21] death all these great amide is right
[45:24] there down was the enemy his left and
[45:29] whose mystical life sometimes this can
[45:33] be a delight your own flesh and then he
[45:38] struggled to overcome it to believe that
[45:41] all things are possible I was telling my
[45:43] wife last night who over there the
[45:45] importance of the our Blessed ministers
[45:49] box
