TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening and welcome i'm so happy to have you here this evening as we study the fifth church age the age of sardis better known as the age of reformation may the lord jesus bless us as we come together of course you are aware we are not here to be entertained or to have a wonderful inspiration uh we are here to seriously uh enter into our study of the word of god and the background some history of the background of the word of god may the lord bless us as we enter into our study with open hearts god lift you into higher heights may god root you deeply in his word may the spirit of god encourage you in your walk with him and together may we all receive a blessing from the presence of the lord now from the scriptures shall we read from revelation chapter 3 reading a part of verse 1. revelation 3 and unto the angel of the church in sardis right this thing saith he that hat the seven spirits of god and the seven stars next we shall read from the gospel of mark chapter 4 verses 26 to 29 and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed would spring up and spring and grow up he knew it not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the air after that the full corn is in the air but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put it in the sickle because the harvest is come god bless us together gracious heavenly father the reading of thy word bringeth light their reading of your word gives us life and we give to you the glory and the honor and the praise in the name of our lord jesus christ amen here we are this evening studying the fifth church age the church age of sardis of whom martin luther is the messenger to this age of sardis now this fifth church age lasted from 15 1520 to 1750 which is to say approximately 230 years i repeat and it is called the age of reformation now martin luther is one of the uh easier to recognize uh messengers of the church ages he is so well known and so easily recognized martin luther was a brilliant scholar of great disposition his father hence uh was able to send him to school and to which was not easy in those days and martin luther wanted to be a lawyer and as a lawyer as a student he was of a quiet and gentle disposition and studying as he was we found out that his entire attitude and outlook changed for he had a very close friend available in itself caused martin luther to begin to get serious about spiritual things and particularly about the spiritual condition of his own life may i pause here to say that sometimes that is what it takes god will allow fiery trials and tests to come into our lives a pain grief and loss so that we can go from the realm of drifting along and fancy full imaginations to break into the area of reality we live the realm of fantasy and just imagination and we come to the reality of the moment and of the hour and many times god will allow us to suffer pain and tragedy the loss of a friend the loss of a loved one and so we wake up from our situation of malays and to begin to you see because that's god's intention he wants us to come us to come back to him he wants us to be able to seek him he wants us to be able to search our hearts he wants us to become sincere and serious with him so that he may bless us deal with us lead us and guide us into his perfect will for his namesake now martin luther entered the augustinian convent at erfurt in 1505 and there he studied philosophy and along with philosophy he studied the word of god and there as he delved into the word of god we understand during this period of his life he lived a life of severe penance all the outward works that martin luther did all the penances could not give him peace within his heart none could satisfy his hunger and his thirst for the true and the living god he himself said i tormented myself unto death to make peace with god but i i i was in darkness and i found it not now the viker general of his order helped him to gain the insight that his salvation did not lay in the confines of the works of which he did or was doing but he would have salvation would have to be an inward work of god rather than by a ritual with this encouragement of course from his great uh mentor of that time martin luther began to further seek god with all of his heart and he became a priest and as yet of course he was not saved he was still seeking but he became a priest an avid deep student of the word of god and of the he also studied the great theological works and writings of many who had gone before after a while he built such a reputation of knowledge and of wisdom that he was sought out as a teacher and as a preacher because of this depth of knowledge and sincerity that he had with god and in the word of god to fulfill a vow that he had made luther went to rome and there in rome he saw the moral mess he saw the futility of the church's imposition of works and penance and they could not bring to him salvation and so the word of god struck home to his heart luther himself described the church as a harlot to the word of god the live by faith god revealed this to him this was the great foundational revelation upon which luther would rest the rest of the building of his life under this legacy upon this rock-solid foundation that the just shall live by faith faith of course we recognize as revealed to us by god's servant a prophet that faith in actual fact is not just believing for you must know what you are believing true faith is a revelation and when something is revealed to you you see it in the word then you can with positivity rest your face on that foundation of revelation which of course is by grace for his grace is greater than our faith may we understand this and may the holy spirit make his word distilled to us until we can clearly see from the word of god faith true faith is a revelation so when luther said that just shall live by faith he was saying that just shall live by revelation not by dead letters but by the living revealing revealed word of god amen and so on his return back to his home scriptures begin to flood his mind the word of god began to wash through his soul and luther was set free from his load of sin all the driftwood all the rotten branches of sin were swept away by the crimson tide of the blood of christ and he was washed by the saving blood word of god and brought into a living personal private relationship with the living god born again born into not the church but born into the kingdom of god soon after this he was elevated to the position of doctor of divinity and he was commissioned to devote his whole life to study and to faithfully expound and defend the scriptures the word of god hallelujah and this of course he did and he did it with great effect on his heart on the hearts of those that were around him were greatly moved by their revelation of truth that was flowing through his life and the sincerity that exuded from him and so with his preaching and teaching of this revealed word of god this word brought him into conflict with the church of that time it brought him specifically in confrontation with the abuses of of the church the abuses of the creeds and of the doctr uh of the doctrines of the bulls it brought him into conflict with these things then of course pope leo the tenth became pope and one john tetzel another priest theologian and preacher was commissioned by the pope at that time to sell indulgences of course in passing may i say the bible tells us clearly the gospel is without money and without price not only the catholics but her daughters has this same spirit of harlotry hunger and thirst for money and for wealth until it's gone right through protestantism until it's literally become acceptable for them to be begging and milking the people in their care for monies or they're selling some books or selling some tapes or selling some form of knowledge selling miracle wallets giving they'll even tell you oh we're going to give you holy water and of course you can give an offering they'll even try to make it some spiritual that you can saw a seed and you will become wealthy if you saw a seed and this seed sowing doctrine contrary to god's word by which this harlot spirit that has penetrated all the way from rome right into its remnant of protestant daughters and denominations where money has become their principal goal and of course tetzel was selling these uh indulgences which is to say that pope has the power to absolve you from sin uh and to free you and to forgive you of your sins so you may bypass hell my friends i uh heard john tetzel some time ago on a tape saying as soon as you place the money into the this offering bag as soon as you put the money in your mother's soul which you just paid for will fly up from hell into heaven in the presence of god these worthy lies these were the teachings that were propounded at that time until this day in our modern times of people claiming to be intelligent and yet accepting the teachings of indulgences which is absolutely contrary to the word of god and in fact in opposition and in disobedience to the word of our god of course luther had no choice but to rise up against these unscriptural doctrines and teachings and so with the power of the holy spirit behind him luther began to sunder from the pulpit the fullness of the word of god amen and not only did he send that from the pulpit the preaching he wrought his 95 cc's his 95 thoughts amen of why that was contrary and he even said why doesn't the pope who has untold wealth why doesn't he build his basilica with his own money rather than uh taking the money from the poor who needs it more than that and so he nailed his 95 thesis on the church door of the castle church october the 31st 1517. my friends in a short while germany was ablaze with the spirit of this reformation this revelation that was flowing out of the spirit of martin luther who was given this revelation from god the rev reformation was now on the revival of god's move of the church was now on their resurrection of the true church which was entombed during the time of the ages was now to experience a resurrection of course mark chapter 4 verses 26 to 29 jesus literally spoke of this ahead of time when he spoke of a man planting a seed type of the word of god and then what comes up first comes up the sprout or the blade and then comes the air and then comes the full corn amen he was giving a a flow of what was going to happen to the church of god down through the ages a quick overview is loader came forth as the blade here comes my friend wesley as the ear the pentecostals came on the scene and here was the corn with the shock around it and now a message has come and with the heat of the son it has brought about a spiritual separation when the believers of the message of malachi 4 5 were expelled expunged excommunicated or put out of the confines of denomination for the seed shall not be air with the shock and so god begins to gather his own in what we call the message of this hour calling to his own the great one has said it's harvest time it's harvest time the savior is crawling and the grain is falling oh do not wait my friends it'll be too late it's already later than you think come now while there is yet time to come and receive christ within your hearts here we find luther began to protest against the catholic church of course he was not the only one before him there was uh john huss and luther himself inspired others there was zwingli and others that came forth at that particular time of course calvin john calvin followed up and was an offshoot of that and from there came forth myriads of these denominations baptist anabaptists reformed church so on so they began to go forth in that way and in any case god's time was ripe for a move god's time was ripe for a resurrection of the church amen and so this was the beginning of the restoration of the church until the church will be moved stage by stage until it comes to the hour of the outpouring of the holy spirit the refreshing reigns of the spirit of god to come upon the church at a much later date now martin luther's character was one of such that we know that he was a sensitive spirit-filled christian he was identified as a man of the word of god for that hour and he had a profound passion and desire to study the word constantly and to also he wanted not to study and keep it to himself but he wanted to make it available to all of his fellow men that they may live by it also he took upon himself the work of translating the new testament now i will not get into the fact that at that time the church would not permit the translation uh for the people the common people to read the scriptures or to know what the bible says for them the people will be able to recognize that their teachings doctrines and uh things that they professed were contrary to the very word of god but luther what wanted this to be known and so he began a translation of the new testament at the same time the words of printing england germany tyndale it came until they started my friends to distribute the word of god at that time it was hard work it was laborious work and he did it himself it is said he corrected some passages 20 times amen and he gathered around him a group of hebrew scholars some of them were jews that he might give a consistent translation of the scriptures of course this monumental work of looter is still the work that has touched the heart of the german people to this very day they look to one of their greatest heroes martin luther the messenger to the reformation he was a mighty preacher he was a great teacher of the word of god and he constantly insisted that the only criteria and standard we need is the word of god you know of his great statement amen i cannot help it my conscience is a prisoner to the word of god here i stand so help me god may every one of us be become prisoners to the word of god that we will not swerve to the left hand nor to the right but keep our eyes on jesus the word and walk in obedience and in surrender to the word of god luther was absolutely against works being the means of our salvation and so he was against their teaching that baptism was the means of regeneration we are not saved by being baptized you're baptized because you previously repented and was saved and this is now just a public show to the inward act of god that took place in your life that you want it to be known and so you are baptized but we are not saved by baptism and so luther stood against that kind of teaching he also taught that jesus christ is the one and only mediator and does not need the assistance of any man regardless of how important he thinks of himself jesus christ is the only mediator between god and man hallelujah it is said he was a man given to much prayer and you know he learned something we all should learn the more work we have to do the more tests and trials we have to face the more time and prayer we ought to spend with god all my friends said the servant of god prayer prayer will bring god's blessings down then if we know prayer will bring god's blessing down then why don't we just pray pray pray pray may god's blessing come upon us as we pray and seek his face as never before glory be to god hallelujah now luther also knew what it was the battle against the devil he was such a man of prayer that sometimes the devil would appear to him visibly at one time luther got so mad at the devil in his study that he grabbed the inkwell and flung it at the devil and told him get the hands get out of this room and chase him away in the name of the living god hallelujah another time the devil comes again in a visible form but he came as two fanatics that claim they were following luther's message but yet there were actually driving people away from that message while there were outwardly claiming to be with it many are doing the same today in this message of this ministry of this prophet of this age and hour while claiming to be with the message are actually committing acts doing things saying things carrying out things that are contrary to the word of god and driving folks away from the message of this hour oh my friends they tried to induce him to banish priests and to banish bibles see they tied the two things together banishing the priests and banishing the bible and luther of course discerned their spirit rebuked them and chased them away from him it was said that luther was a prophet but we know he was not really a prophet because he did not have the gifts of a prophet but listen what dr sir says in his history vol 3 luther was an evangelist a speaker in tongues interpreter in one person he was endowed with all nine gifts of the spirit now how are the mighty fallen the mighty lutheran church that was once filled with the message and the power of the holy spirit of this messenger of this fifth church age how how are the mighty fallen until now there would not they want nothing to do with the power of the holy spirit they want nothing to do with speaking in towns want nothing to do with the nine supernatural operations and diversity of the gifts of the holy ghost which is supposed to be in a genuine new testament church may oh may if martin luther what were to be here and see what has happened to the church that's bearing his name he would groan in his spirit oh my friends i believe he'll take an inkwell and fling it again at lots of the leaders for they have moved off of their foundations they have slipped off of the word of god back to the word your litterans back to the word you're genuine christians and believers back to your original faith that the holy spirit may lead you and guide you that you may walk into all truth for the glory and praise of his name i want you to know my friends that god that stirred in his heart the holy ghost and the green shoots of reformation was springing up under his leadership amen and the truth of god began to be restored back into the church of god as it was known on the death pentecost the doctrine of justification salvation by grace alone hallelujah apart from works amen amen hallelujah i tell you this man this messenger this servant of the living god will always be recognized and known as the instrument in the hand of god who god used to revive the truth of his word in that age of course he was the fifth messenger and his message was they just shall live by faith amen hallelujah well we are not only just to be born again and sit there but to move from faith to faith to faith just as much as the lutherans took the just shall live by faith and they are sacked there and they're still sitting there but the church of god is marching on for it move from just shall live by faith to wesley saying look we don't only need faith we got to have holiness we got to live holy and so holiness came and then they are sacked by holiness sanctification pentecostals came along we don't only have to be saved and to live a holy life we must be filled with the holy spirit and so my friends god's truth is marching on and it has marched on to this day of the last star the seventh star messenger that god sent upon the earth for his glory amen the spirit of the reformation martin luther used as the reform well and we take god for him amen he was gentle he was fearless he was patient and constantly waiting on god to work out any problems that he had we ought to do the same be patient fearless trusting in god that god will work out all of your problems but then he himself began to be seduced for as his movement grew and that's the numbers exponentially uh multiplied multitudes came under his banner and then we find out that his mind became seduced by this power of numbers that followed him and so are many today seduced by numbers seduced by the followers they have amen and it caused them to drift away from the word of god right within the confines of the message of malachi 4 5 i will restore saith the lord many of these worms that are destroying the foundation of this great tree of truth and they're being seduced by numbers thinking that numbers gives them credibility numbers gives them believability they believe numbers brings them fame not only that some have got their eyes on using this message for the means of profit or profiting by it and from it while they are following it amen many walking in the message with their aim on personal recognition the desire to flex their muscles puff their feathers fluff their feathers like a pheasant or or a peacock wanting personal recognition oh my friends others in this message are even being persuaded to political motivations may god help us everyone my friends luther was in such an inspiration that he wanted to break the yoke of the pope break it and so many of them used luther for their own hands because they did not want to send monies to rome and so a lot of fanatics and a lot of followers rose up many times messengers have more trouble with their so-called followers than they do with those that are on the outside amen and soon luto was dragged into politics and political affairs and political decisions that actually laid outside of the realm of his teaching we find out spiritual scarecrows a lot of these fanatics it's the devil raised up fanatics back then with luther and now in this message a spiritual scarecrows to scare away the people from this true message of this day and this hour oh i want nothing to do with that because i heard this this this this oh i don't want to mess with them with that message because you know everything isn't perfect they're not organized they're not systematic they're not educated they're not money they're not culture they're not this oh you listen if you are looking for faults you can find a million things that will drive you away completely from this word of god and so we find friends that luther got out of his spiritual position when you get yourself out of your spiritual position then you find you start making worldly decisions you start making political decisions you started making money decisions you started making decisions that are normal in the natural world but contrary to the word of god my friends here it is he got out of his position find himself mediating between the lords and the peasants and made a lot of wrong decisions when it came to that uprising between lords and peasants and literally he caused thousands upon thousands to be killed in a popular uprising at that particular time but because he was entangled in a church and state gospel and so he rip the whirlwind amen but for all that luther martin luther was the fifth messenger of the fifth church age the age of sardis better known as the age of reformation now his intentions were wrong but let us say this not that his intentions were wrong but his judgment failed him at that time because he was out of his position now truly my friends if the present-day lutherans could ever get back back to the word back to truly the just shall live by faith not by the lighting of candles not by all these uh man-made teachings in the book but by the word of god and by the revelation of the holy spirit that just shall live by revelation if lutherans would remember from whence they had fallen and return to their first love their original faith and serve god like that wonderful brother served god may the grace of god be upon them may god speak to some of their leaders wherever they are maybe individually speak to them and then my friends there will become again a people that will be to the credit the glory and the praise of our great god and savior our blessed lord jesus christ may god bless this study here tonight of this messenger martin luther messenger to the sardis church age better known as the age of reformation god bless you until next week we'll come again and we'll study the word of god here god is in and may god control our words our works our efforts and receive all the praise the honor and the glory share this wonderful message just send it off on your phone your tablet share it with someone else don't keep
