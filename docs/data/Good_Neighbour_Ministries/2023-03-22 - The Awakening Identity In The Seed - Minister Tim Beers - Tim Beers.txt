continue on uh the series I've been speaking on the Great Awakening we want to talk about the Awakening identity in the seed we want to bring a little bit of uh natural and spiritual lay a little bit of foundation and then the next part of this we want to really bring uh the bride's identity in uh uh full full View as much as I can possibly do amen let us turn to First Peter 2 9 tonight a great scripture that really identifies Who We Are first Peter 2 9. let us pray father we thank you Lord for your wonderful love grace and mercy new mercies every morning Lord bringing us here tonight to gather together around your word we're not here to see one another Lord we're here to see you father in your word tonight father we expect you to come and because we know that no man could reveal no

tonight Lord as we report for service father just have your way now Lord take control speak your word into your people's hearts Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that yea should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light which in times past were not a people but now the people of God which have which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy Hallelujah Colossians chapter 3 verse 1. if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above not on things on the Earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory you may be seated God bless you Hallelujah identifying who we are in this last day the scripture says we are a chosen generation out of all the generations we have been chosen Amen to bring forth this end time word to bring forth a Rapture a body change in this day and age we are a royal priesthood and we know that priests Minister unto God we are called and identified to minister directly to God we don't come through any other channel we don't come through a denomination we don't come through the law but by Grace we Minister unto God a holy nation A peculiar people we're not we're not we're not we are different people believe me we and as time goes and as this word matures in US you're going to see more and more you don't fit in I know that my mind when I when I start thinking I'm just getting drawn away more and more into the word and the more farther I get into the word I realize the the farther I'm getting away from the world the farther I'm getting away from my flesh and the carnality more and more and that's what is prophesied and supposed to happen in our walks that's who we are identifying with in these last days is the word of God is identifying itself in US we don't have to in ourselves identify nothing the attribute the seed of God when it's awakened and it comes to life and is born again it starts identifying with itself God swore by himself it wasn't not nothing anymore under Abraham's Covenant that what we could do but it's what he has already done what he has completed what he has finished my word has been spoken my word will go forth and it will accomplish what I set forth it to do where's his word it's in you it's in me it's in living vessels today Hallelujah Ephesians 5 8 we're in a little bit of Bible study so we're gonna do a little bit of uh you know teaching a little bit of preaching Ephesians 5 8 for ye were sometimes Darkness but now yea our light in the Lord walk as children of light speak in the light let your actions your reactions be in the light let your conversations your words your thoughts be in the light you say oh I can't you can't stop what what Satan puts in your mind but it's what you're feeding on you don't realize everything carries like my mom said to me one time you talk like everything carries a spirit yes everything every influence that is out there in Satan Eden carries a spirit and we gotta watch what we're feeding on sometimes the thoughts in our mind that we battle with because the Bible says bring every thought captive to the word of God and you can only do that if you are a surrendered vessel and you're feeding on the things of God this is not my words it's the Bible you are sometimes Darkness see we walked in the flesh we were living in the flesh we some of us have a past in the flesh mistakes in the flesh things we've done in the past we walked in that Darkness but when the light come when the new birth came amen we now walk in light that Darkness has passed away I can testify by the grace of God in my own life that that darkness when I look back at my life it's not connected with me it's departed for me it's gone for me because I'm walking in his light in my life John 12 35 then Jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while ye have the light lest Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness know it not whether he goeth he don't know who he is he can't find the Lord he can't find that place of rest and peace in his life and his mind because he's not walking in the light and it says right here that while a little time and we know that the time is short in this hour this is no time for fooling around this is no time if the Prof if the angel of God said to brother Branham back then be more sincere and he's seen this day how much more are we up here recognizing the manifestation of the word being fulfilled in modern events that are taking place in the world the light is only here for a little time Saints and I know that those who are of the light that are children of God will walk in the light they can do nothing else but walk in the light what is the true meaning of identity identity is a unique set of characteristics that can be used to identify a person as themselves and no one else the word can be used in different ways in different contexts on a personal level identity often refers to a person's self so sense of meaning how they view themselves as compared to others it's not about how we see ourselves it's not about viewing ourselves what other people see and how they see us not in Christ it's about how he sees us it's about what he has said about us not other people and not even ourselves what we think of ourselves that's where condemnations comes in when we start thinking about ourselves because one minute you can think you're doing great you're on top of the world you're a Christian one minute and the next minute you're not a Christian you're a sinner you're no good God get rid of me you see it testified many times in the Bible when they looked at themselves and thought what they thought of themselves and how they projected themselves and what they thought their identity was there's two identities here it's this human identity what we think of ourselves and what this world puts on us and there's God's identity what is identity simply speaking identity is a combination of your physical and behavioral traits that Define Who You Are for example your name is part of your identity now type it both back natural and spiritual as is the form of color of your eyes or your fingerprints this set of characteristics allows you to definitely and uniquely be recognizable and that's what it is these things identify who we are you don't you see me up here you look at me and you when you think of brother Tim you have a vision of me and what I look like because this identifies that name brother Tim beers but you don't see the real me you don't see the only way that you can see the real me or the word that's in me is when it manifestes and you have eyes to see that manifestation which we know the prophet said the bride has the ability to see that word in manifestation in action that's what gives her discernment how to walk yes what is identity and why is it so important have an identity can give you a sense of belonging which is important to your well-being and confidence now this is what they this was what they're saying out there there's there's so much positive mental speakers there's so much things written about being positive being confident being successful you are who you say you are there's all kinds you can there's thousands and thousands of things that people are feeding on out there but there is a crisis of our identity people are collapsing the more information and knowledge that there is out there that you can be the best that you can be is the worst that the people are getting because you cannot be anything outside of Christ it's Christ who makes us who we are Hallelujah instant identity identify changes shifts in our lives changes in our life happens throughout people are confronted with new challenges and Tackle different experiences thus an identity crisis can occur at any time in identity involves the experiences relationships beliefs and values and memories that make up a person's subject sense of self this help creates a continuous self-image that remains fairly constant even as new aspects of itself are developed or strengthened over time that's what they feed off of constantly trying to evolve in this in our society many people have a done easy crisis from the time we're born different voices tried to tell us who we are and what we are isn't that the truth we know about all these voices amen we know God is speaking to us and the devil's speaking to us just like he did in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve lost their true identity when they listened to the devil's lie and Satan is the father of Lies and he puts lies everything he speak is a lie but we need to come to a place and recognize his voice and not listen to it because some people believe a lie and when they believe a lie it's very important because when you start believing not lies just like a Doctrine it's a rumor then it's a thought and then it's a saying then it becomes a Doctrine and a spirit comes behind that and what it leads the people away from the truth and that's the same order and process that Satan does with us to believe a lie about ourselves and our identity and he only has what does he have to use against us is our flesh is this carnal mind it's our mistakes it's our weaknesses that's all he has to use but when we come to a place when we recognize that's why when the bride recognizes who she is she's going to recognize these things these lies of the devil that he's trying to tell her she won't listen to those lies anymore look at transgender people how can I respect you for who you are they want you to respect them for who they are when they could not even accept and respect for who they were God made male and female period science testifies of it nature testifies of it there's only two genders two identifications that God created that's it that's it he reserves the right to tell us who we are Through the Bible we can see God changing people's identities see when God changes people's identities it's different but when Satan tells the people to change their identities what do you get you get that perversion that is happening out there and that that perversion comes through and is proven scientifically proven caused by mental illness and doesn't even the Bible says that he'll give them over to a reprobate mind to believe a lie about everything about genders about everything that is going on to make them manifest a perverted Spirit yes sure they believe it oh I believe that you know you know a grown man I believe that I'm a kid I believe I'm a dog so I should eat dog food and and live like a dog and stay home no this is true this is what's happening out there Hallelujah who God said we were because there was no evidence When God Says that existed in our lives when he told us who we were when he when we came in and God said you're my son you're my daughter you're the Bride of Jesus Christ the first thing we looked at is there's no evidence of that in our lives but God don't need your evidence God don't need you to prove him when he says who you are he's identifying Who You Are amen in this age of identification we are we are recognized by our identification in this age we must have a driver's license or a social insurance number a health card or some kind of identification to identify Who We Are we can't even cash a check without it well we know that this is a digital age now it's all about identification and we know that Satan is bringing his identification in with the new world order with all these things that are taking place Hallelujah and Jesus Christ is bringing his bride to her identification so there's two identifications that are taking place right now in this world Hallelujah it's not denomination that identifies her or religion but it's only the word made flesh that identifies the bride today outside of that revealed word by a prophet she can never find her identification perfect faith lies in the tapes and only can be revealed by the spirit and only reveal to the elected that are predestinated to receive it that's it they're the only ones that God is identifying himself with in this day is the elected predestinated seed and he is and will more and more identify her to the world that's what he said I'll make I'll do uh I I won't make a public show but I will show her off there will be a quick sweet move of the word of God in her life people are going to recognize even in this message there's something different about her the way she walks the way she talks the Supernatural is just gonna move around her life and manifest it's going to be effortless things being revealed constantly I'll show you things to come I'll show you my manifestation oh yes that's the hour we're living in that's what we're moving into God needs consecrated separated Hearts lives just like it was spoke on Sunday molding and shaping and chipping that stone chipping you pulling you out pulling you out bringing you in to be locked behind that inner Veil where the world can't get you the world behind their silence you want to live a life of Silence of this world people plagued people tormented in their minds in this message from the world and the noise of the world but God is calling you behind the inner Veil where it's all quiet from the world where it's just his Pillar of Fire the glory of his light and his word being revealed that's where he wants you to walk with him there it's going to take a sacrifice yes it's going to take a dying out yes die in Daily Paul says to the things that try to identify us this flesh is always trying to identify but it's the wrong identification and I do not identify with it only what the word of God says in this life sometimes we think we are artists accountants teachers truck drivers business owners mothers or we think is what we have achieved in life that identifies us we might be honored students when all kinds of rewards Achieve Financial success or by the things we've done right or by the things we've done wrong in life or I am what others think of me and their opinions of me but what does God think of me how does God identify us you say you you say that you know brother Tim listen we're dealing with every level of Faith here every level of believer here people still are battling with this battling with all these things here thinking that oh you fail in life you don't you're not successful in your finances you're not you know in your job you look at your job that identifies you how good you do on your job how good you are at home as a mother all these things as a student if you don't have uh top grades or all the success that you had all the awards that you won or you didn't win all these things try to identify us and people still battle with these things in a lot of different areas in our lives but God is speaking those things do not identify you when I have awakened you and I have called you and I've spoken to you it's my word it's what I have done that I will do in your life identifies Who You Are we sing the song this world is not my home I'm just this world is not my home and anything in it it has no right I'll tell you the truth it has no right to interpret it has no right to try to identify or put any kind of identification on the Bride of Jesus Christ She Belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ and the word and the word only nobody can touch it nobody can touch this word no man can touch this word it's only God for examples in the Bible where people who thought they were nothing but God said differently you look at Gideon a mighty man of Valor when he was defeated and hiding from the enemy but God called them something different God was identifying him but he didn't identify himself like that you see when when you get into God's mind and you think as God thinks it changes things it'll change your life when you I know it it sounds funny come on brother Tim we're in a message preach it like this but when you believe what God says to you you are truly believe it it brings light to you it changes you you don't even recognize until God reveals it what you're believing about yourself and how you're seeing yourself and every time you look and you think a negative thought or you think you're not worthy you're identifying yourself you're putting identification on yourself that God did not put on there many times God calls us things that there is no physical evidence to support then he's say in the book of Hebrews now Faith is the substance of things hoped for for the evidence of Things Not Seen that's where God moves in that Realm and when you receive faith and God speaks to your heart when you receive it by faith like that there's no evidence but God said there's evidence there he just spoke to me and told me that it is there go get the land go do it I have called you do it when he says there's evidence there that's where we walk by faith not by sight God's evidence is what we walk by Hallelujah since he is God he reserves a right as Creator to reveal to us how he sees us and what he sees in US he changed Abram's name to Abraham which means father of many we can preach a whole sermon on Abraham's life many sermons when he had no children you see there was no evidence we know what he went through we know the process of faith that he went through the battles he went through the trying and the testing of time that he went through there's no evidence of him being a father of many Nation no evidence of a child even as it got worse and worse and Sarah became barren past the age but God said differently God identified Abraham as the father of many nations and he identifies Abraham's seed today with that same kind of Faith to bring forth not that a child but bring forth this word born in US Hallelujah amen Sarah I name was changed to Sarah which means princess Jacob's name was changed from deceiver to Israel which means Prince with God oh we were Liars we were cheaters we were deceivers oh yes our name was identified with all these things but he changed our name when he called me amen he called me by his grace and revealed himself to me he gave me a new name and change my identity oh my people don't really know you your family don't really know you we're talking Fellowship many times you get together and you try to you know do the natural things with family and that stuff but they don't know who you are they don't know what's happening inside what's what what you believe inside your heart these are all people that hide identity changes to carry spiritual inheritance God wanted them to carry in the same way we must have identity changed and fulfill our destiny and the plan that God has for us there are all kinds of seeds today there are Incorruptible seeds there are corruptable seeds there are seeds of God and there are seeds of the devil the serpent seed there are seeds that are alive and there are seeds that are dead regardless of what ground it falls on every seed must bring forth of its own kind because in the seed Awakening manifestes its identification Cain had to manifest his identification Judas had the Manifest his identification Esau had to manifest his identification and so does the Sons and Daughters of God have to manifest their identification oh yes this is the hour you can't escape it you can't run from it all seeds are bringing forth in this hour of its own kind oh my and what a glorious thing when you start recognizing what seed you're of oh what a glorious time brother Brandon one in a million like I was saying the other day there there's been a hundred billion people that exist on this Earth so far they're saying and one out of a million is born think of how many did not come into existence I'm talking Naturally Speaking billions and trillions did not even come into existence and then here we are in this last day called out predestinated in this hour to see this truth to see this word you see why God is so determined you see why he won't let go of your life you see why he won't let you do the things that you think you want to do or you think is right to do you see why he's taking so much control over your life and putting such restrictions on your life restrictions on your thoughts and your thinking and your words and where you go what you listen to what you look at you will never have rest I don't care if you call this legalistic or not you will never have rest until you surrender to his voice to his will and stop doing the things that he's telling you not to do everyone is made up differently God knows us individually he knows what we can handle he says I won't give you anything more than what you you as an individual can handle don't look at what brother Tim does don't look at her brother Danny or brother Simon or anything that Brothers do look at what you do look what God's speaking to you to do Hallelujah we did not become seed by the rebirth see there's a greater Revelation with predestination like we're Way Beyond that we one day we came to the Altar and we were saved way beyond that they're not out there but we are here and then being born again The Awakening took place in our lives but that is even not it listen what Brother Brad I'm speaking here and the Sumerian Church age we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reburned reborn again for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in a non-seed there is nothing to be quickened nothing in there to be quickened but in a seed of God there's something to be quickened and if God quickened me and I recognize in my own life you recognize in your own life that God quickened the seed the word inside of you and he's changed you how do you know brother Brian I'm in the token message they said brother Branham how do we know we got the token because he said you must have the token you must have the token he says you changed didn't you your desires changed didn't it you you have you can see spiritually that you can live above sin which is unbelief in your life then don't you he says there it is now keep moving with it keep growing with it keep feeding it keep feeding that we come in here we hear the word of God we get strengthened we get encouraged you wonder why people lose the victory you wonder why because they come and they get fed they get encouraged and they go out there and they start listening to the world and everything that evolves around their life all the dentifications that are trying to identify them they listen to the wrong voices and that's how they lose the victory but if you can get into a place I know what what did it for me is that when that word opened up and it started delivering me by Supernatural experiences one after another all I could do is feed on that word more and more I didn't realize what I was doing but it was identifying me amen it was showing my identification show me who I am amen show me my calling and I just kept feeding on that more and more call me a fanatic that is good I'd rather be a fanatic for this than a fanatic for that because you're either going to be one or another you're either going to be influenced from above or below like it or not that's the truth Hallelujah glory to God Galatians 3 6. now to Abraham and his Seed where the promise made to overcome we will live and not die we will be raptured we will come to perfect faith and perfect realization of who we are in him it's the bride's identification in this hour we will there will be a bride without spot without wrinkle and it's not because of what you think it's not because of what you think in your life is because of what God has spoken he will bring it to pass you're here tonight you look back at things in your life that you thought at the time that you couldn't overcome and here you are tonight and you look back and you overcome that what made you overcome that not you not how much you prayed how much you fast how much confidence that you had it's the life inside of you that overcame amen look in John First John 3 9. what is scripture whosoever is born of God do it not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God when we recognize we will the difference between the attribute the seed and the flesh there's going to be great victory in her there's going to be great victory in your life because the seed that's what God sees and God don't see sin it cannot sin that inside of me so when this sins when this makes Mrs makes a mistake I don't identify this mistake or this sin with this inside no I don't this cannot sin but this can so what this does is goes to the father goes to the atonement goes to the blood and says wash this away when you walk by faith in that kind of perfect faith in this hour you see how this great work Supernatural is going to take place you see how Christ is going to come and do what he said he's going to do in the bride and manifest on her this hinders too much this gets in the way and God has been dealing with that circumstance in every one of our lives from day one trying to separate the flesh from the attribute the flesh from the seed and then when it is separated and you just believing and having faith in what God said you are the seed of God then you start moving and walking in that kind of power oh my look what he says here in uh the first seal every born-again believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God identification is this not words this is identification he is not trusted in his works but in the blood of Jesus the Bible said he that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin how can you make a man a sinner when the bleach blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God that's what I just said the blood is between me this and God God inside God in the seed the blood is between Hallelujah the blood is in between there's a recognizing there's a realization in her that there's a blood in between it means everything to Earth it's life and death to her that's what this gospel is to her life and death it's not a game it's not religion it's not just trying to be good it's life and death with her she must have the token she like like Jacob wrestled with the angel she must have the blessing the blessing of who she is to recognize who she is to recognize his word to recognize the word in her that's all that matters to her that's all that the desire is in her heart that's what's in the bride's heart that's what the word the spirit of God in this age is leading her to and everybody outside of that will be left behind that is the rapture in her Hallelujah amen how can that pure blood of Christ ever let a sin pass there he cannot Jesus said be perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how could we even start the thought of being perfect because we can't he said how can we that's us identifying to us we can never we can never with our own mind even start the process of the thought of being perfect that's why so many people stumble over it but let me tell you I am perfect as my heavenly father is perfect it depends what you're looking at well I know brother Tim no you don't no you don't do you know this identification you don't know brother Tim no you don't he only he Hallelujah amen but Jesus required it and if he required it he's got to make a way for it and he did that's what we're talking about he made a way Amen on a day of Pentecost he revealed it he made a way he came back he came back in this day amen that's what the cloud the mighty angel that was up front he made a way he came back he's here he's here now they're coming today where the bride will be the same example that he was word made Flesh on this on the earth when he read the scriptures and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled before your ears and in your sight he's gonna do it again and not everybody in this message is going to accept it because there's denominational burials in people's minds spirits of doctrines of devils that are here that are trying to take that away from the bride but brother Brown said the bride can never be denominated she will be free to bring forth this Living Word and what does that mean she in the word have become one and the same it will be him and her speaking him and her living him and her speaking through her and believe in what they're believing out there oh God God said a prophet we just got to listen to the tapes we've got to listen to that it's all good it's all part of the process but they put a period they have a truth they put a period Thunders period prusa period two Soul period anything with a period stops that truth from marching on that's the denominator there is no period with the bride of Jesus Christ it's just word revealing truth unveiling over and over and over again that's what it's all about yes it's eternity it's moving and revealing I know more today than I know yesterday about myself and him Hallelujah spiritually speaking we must carry legal identification to do business in the spiritual Realm the Bible contains our official legal identification to become aware of who you are in Christ the word of God must be engrafted into the inner man through Revelation the anointing of the holy spirit is the guaranteed that we are who God says we are and we have what God says we have everything he says we have we have and we are who he says we are Hallelujah even the devil knows who you are or if you're a child of God he knows who you are when you have been born again look at Acts 19 tells us of a story of the Seven Sons of Siva who tried to cast out a devil in the name of Jesus whom Paul preached I cast out this devil because brother Branham said so I can do this because brother Branham said so the demons are not stupid there's a lot of sorry it was the demons said Jesus we know and Paul we know but who are you nobody in Hell identified you but Jesus was identified in heaven and in hell and Paul was identified in heaven and in hell and so are we just as much identified in heaven we are identified in hell oh yes you say oh brother I'm scared I'm scared no no no I want to be identified because if I'm identified down there oh that means there's something greater inside of me Hallelujah Oh Glory to God amen Hallelujah this word is doing something great inside of her something great Hallelujah amen thank you Lord let us move on here I got 15 more minutes and I'm going to use it hallelujah thank you Lord Satan wants to hide your identity he wants to confuse your identity he wants to deceive you in believing in a lie about your true identity we know that that's been his battle and if if Satan has battled you then thank God he has battled you because there's something if he's not after you he's already got you he's got you sealed up but if he's after you constantly constant battles in your mind that means there's something inside of you Hallelujah Satan's the perverter of the truth he uses hate pain trauma bitterness and other people's opinions to try to take away your identity in Christ the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind our thoughts create our words and our words create our identity that's why God sent a message to the church which was the greatest battle ever fought and that process is still going on today brother Brown I'm talking back then that process that fight started with Michael and the Archangel and Lucifer and he said it's going on today let me tell you it's in the greatest hype of that war in this hour because never has there been an hour We're God hallelujah is going to take over our people amen and produce a rapture a body change now where the battle begins brother Brown is speaking here I want you to recognize this process here we need to hear it over and over again until and God will continue just like you with a child you tell your child over and over and over again to what to what why do you tell your child you can be a participator here you know not just a sub you know why do you tell your child over and over and over again so they can listen so they can obey that's why you do that and that's why God keeps speaking his word over and over and over again you're going to realize two things when you get there you're going to realize how small Satan really was I was afraid of that well you're going to realize that here because once you overcome this thing and realize this thing is not of you then when he tries to do whatever he tries to do in this flesh you're going to realize that's not me to take away your identity in Christ the greatest battle of what now listen now where the battle begins right in your mind now remember it's not Christian Science Mind Over Matter that's what we do sometimes we try to mind over matter it's not about that Saints it's not how much you can you know think this think that or try to think positive it's not about that we don't realize that we do that sometimes the mind accepts the life which is the word of God and there brings the life just your thought doesn't do it very strong very powerful when it opens up to you it does not do it no other process does this there's only one channel and one process is your mind accepts the life the word the word of God brought through the channel of your thoughts see I love when he says that if you go back and you read you if you're familiar with brother Brown's message and you read it you'll see he says see constantly C it's not the thought but it's the channel that but your mind accepts it it grasp it it's good you're it's good to grasp the word it's good to what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you okay let's he's going to start getting into the spirit now okay my mind grasped it and then it brings through the channel to my spirit okay that should be simple right I do that all the time hmm when that takes place when life comes down that channel into you the word of God is manifested in you if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it will be done from the middle of the heart which is the soul from there goes out forth feed in every channel all the senses the word of God is feeding but listen he says right here in all these channels that the word of God is supposed to go forth that life is supposed to come forth he said the trouble of it here it is we are standing here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept that that what is out there the word of God he says we've got to get rid of that that doubt in those senses in the spirit that dealt sometimes we got to go to war in our spirit go to war take the word of God within ourselves and take the word and chop your way through that devil of doubt that's in your spirit every time the word god comes up a memory comes up a conscience comes up a feeling comes up emotion comes up and rubs you from that word you gotta go and recognize that and go into prayer sometimes fasting things are not cast out but by prayer and fasting in your life These Are Soldiers these are children of God this is what we're called to not to play Church Message Church I belong to the message I'm in a message Church my pastor's anointed preacher that's all gone that ain't going to produce this no way not in this hour the trouble is you're standing here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that and come down the Channel with the true word of God and then goes out of itself automatically when you say no when you die to that certain thing and you say I accept the word all you you think is easy to die you think it's easy when God comes and tells you I'm just saying late examples to stop doing this stop going there change this in your life change that in your life don't speak this way don't do this this way don't behave don't act whatever it is and you have to die to that but let me tell you until you die to that you're not going to get more of Christ that you are seeking for that must die there must be a death in that area of your life that is the thing that's making you stagnated that is the thing that's holding you back and you know what your conscious God speaks into every conscience and even morsel to the bride your conscious identifies with that with his voice in that area oh brother Simon brother Tim brother Danny might not speak speak specifically what it is but the word of God the spirit of God it's his spirit is it discerner and thoughts and tends of your heart you won't get the victory until you die to that thing and Let It Go that's been my only process in my walk in my growth in God and in the spirit and in Revelation outside of the gift in my life my personal walk and personal Victory with Jesus Christ which there must be is that process and that's what he's talking about here that's what he's breaking down here Hallelujah let me just start winding this down real quickly I got a lot more to say but we're going to do another part identity theft is a big thing in this world today oh my isn't it oh big thing but Satan can never steal it or you can never lose it when you got it with Christ he can't take that away he can try to steal everybody's identity in a natural REM whatever but he's one thing he can't steal tonight is that identity that Christ put inside of you Hallelujah Romans 8 38 and 30 and 39 for I am sure I am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers no Hypes nor depths nor all anything else in all creation no matter what this world can do we'll be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our lord nothing nothing is going to separate us when Peter recognized that he was going to be an old man he was Fearless he was bold let me tell you nothing is going to separate you from God nothing what without fear get rid of fear is a false evidence of pure and real it's a lie of the devil all things work together for good because God is in all things and he is all things John 10 27. musicians can come my sheep hear my voice they don't hear any other voice they have no identification with any other voice but the shepherd's voice and they know them and they follow me now listen I give them eternal life whoa and they will never perish identification it's identifying you tonight the word they will never perish and no one listen No One nothing nothing that this life can bring to you will snatch you out of the father's hands why why my father who has given them to me is greater than all things and no one is able to snatch them out of the father's hand and I and the father are one and Jesus said in that day this day today you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me who can snatch you out of his hand then walk Fearless walk with a consciousness of Who You Are he identified who you are why can't you believe just believe only believe we're called to believe we're believers what he said it's the hardest thing to do isn't it the most simplest instruction but it's the hardest thing to do the bride knows that her identity will never be found outside of Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Lord we need to identify with Jesus and his resurrection when he rose from the dead he shattered all powers and authorities of Satan the Bible says he destroyed powers and principalities making them an open show of them Colossians 2 15 being identified with Jesus in his resurrection we received the benefits and the authority of his resurrection Ephesians 1 16-23 when opposition comes against us we need to make a stand and take the authority that we have in our new identity in Christ Jesus we have to speak to the opposition and tell it that we have been risen with Christ and now in a position of authority speak God's word over your life don't listen to the devil speak God's word every day over your life especially what he has spoken to you and told you who you are Gideon Mighty Man of Valor oh yes say because I rose with Christ I have the authority of Christ over all the forces of darkness in my life Luke 10 19 behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over some no all the power of the enemy and nothing listen and nothing shall by any means hurt you oh my smart Marcus say but we're going to continue it let us stand oh what an identity we have in Christ what an identity when we start recognizing Who We Are recognizing the word of God within us these simple truths coming alive within our lives placing us position on us in him giving us the power given us the authority given us the boldness Amen to approach his throne amen Hallelujah listen if you believe tonight no matter what you're asking for what your need is tonight if you can only believe that all things are possible things will start happening in your life I want the reality of Christ God has to be real to me if God ain't real to me that he ain't God to me God has to be real in our lives if you can believe tonight if God has spoken to your heart you can believe his word you don't have to believe me or anybody else you can believe his word I spoke his word tonight then you could have what you asked for [Music] that's his kingdom his kingdom has come within man it's here now it's on the earth standing living
