[17:01] are here because you want to see the
[17:05] word comes to
[17:07] you
[17:09] yeah praise the
[17:11] Lord tonight I will
[17:15] speak
[17:17] about
[17:21] feith that's what God lay on my heart
[17:25] amen because without faith it's
[17:28] impossible to please him that's
[17:31] right with faith all things are possible
[17:36] to them that
[17:38] believe
[17:40] so uh brother Phillip lead us in
[17:55] prayer yes Lord
[18:01] yes
[18:06] Lord
[18:08] amen please we reading from Gans
[18:13] ginans chapter 3 verse
[18:18] 7 the
[18:19] same chapter 4 verse
[18:23] 22 and I'll read Romans 9:11 but that
[18:27] one you can sit down so we I
[18:30] begin know ye therefore that they which
[18:34] are of Faith the same are the children
[18:39] of
[18:41] Abraham and the scripture foreing that
[18:45] God would justify the
[18:49] heaven the
[18:51] heaven through faith preach before the
[18:57] gospel unto ABR
[18:59] saying indeed shall All Nation be
[19:05] blessed so then they which be of Faith
[19:11] are blessed with faithful
[19:16] Abraham okay that's one part the second
[19:20] part
[19:21] is for it is written that
[19:26] Abraham had two sons
[19:30] the one by the B made the other by the
[19:38] fair
[19:40] woman right but he who was of the BN
[19:46] woman was born after the
[19:50] flesh but he of the fair woman was by
[19:56] promise
[19:59] okay may the Lord add his Blessing
[20:01] Romans 9:11 but that one why I'm talking
[20:04] I'll just bring it I'll just read it may
[20:08] the Lord had his blessing upon the word
[20:11] please be
[20:16] seated as I was
[20:19] saying God word come by
[20:21] faith without faith you cannot please
[20:25] God and someone may say what is faith
[20:29] faith is a
[20:31] revelation faith is the one that going
[20:34] to carry you and I through because
[20:37] through faith you can see what God is
[20:43] doing for your day because without faith
[20:47] it's impossible to please God there's
[20:50] all kinds of churches they are pleasing
[20:53] they think they praising God but because
[20:56] they don't have the Revelation like we
[20:58] have have right it become harder for
[21:03] them because the it make not the people
[21:07] know oh like you talk to some of
[21:11] denomination people they will tell oh
[21:15] Jesus is coming but he's coming they
[21:19] they thinking because they don't have
[21:21] feet they are thinking Jesus is coming
[21:25] way
[21:27] behind right
[21:29] but through our brother William Braham
[21:32] message when the seven seal has open it
[21:37] has declared to us
[21:39] 1963 the crowd that came on the sanset
[21:44] mountain that crowd was the second
[21:47] coming of what Christ to come and open
[21:50] the seventh
[21:53] seal so that when Christ opened the
[21:56] seven seal he didn't go
[22:00] he's here in the word form opening the
[22:03] word to us amen so we must know the time
[22:11] the
[22:12] hour that we are living in because when
[22:16] we
[22:17] look the whole world right now is what
[22:20] in a Tom
[22:23] oil
[22:26] Israel right now is under pressure of
[22:29] the whole
[22:30] world they want them to back off from
[22:34] Hamas but
[22:36] n has recognized naturally that he have
[22:40] to
[22:41] stand as a leader for Israel to go and
[22:46] root
[22:48] Hamas so is the wife of Christ the bride
[22:53] the spiritual bride we are the Abraham
[22:57] seed right no matter what the devil does
[23:01] to you my brother my sister rise
[23:06] up and possess the Gate of the
[23:11] enemy because if you don't rise up and
[23:15] possess the gates of the
[23:18] enemy the enemy will possess you and
[23:21] take over
[23:23] you because we live in the hour whereby
[23:28] God
[23:29] is speaking to you and I sometime of
[23:33] course we miss some it's like a soldier
[23:35] in a battle fail if you a true
[23:39] bride sometime you go into a battle and
[23:42] the battle you go you get lose the enemy
[23:46] shoot at you you didn't seee it and God
[23:49] allowed it but don't let that thing put
[23:53] you down because you have a God who have
[23:57] promised you
[23:59] you a God who promis Abraham who does
[24:03] not sleep who does not Slumber come on
[24:06] so that God is in you yes sir that's why
[24:10] he prays the word and says the righteous
[24:14] man falls seven times but he rise up
[24:17] seven
[24:18] times because why you are a soldier of
[24:22] the
[24:23] Lord you are a soldier of the Lord amen
[24:27] and a soldier
[24:29] sometime bullets hit you I grew up in
[24:33] barracks in my country I know about how
[24:36] soldiers do things how sometime it make
[24:42] even some people get frustrated and
[24:46] things happen and all that but let me
[24:50] tell you once they hear their Trumpet of
[24:53] the soldier trumpet everyone chest
[24:56] puffed up they are ready to take take
[24:58] the gun and go and do what the
[25:01] requirement of the commander saying to
[25:05] them and what is our commander our
[25:09] commander is the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[25:12] and he has told us through the
[25:15] prophet that the prophet asks
[25:19] him what is my
[25:21] future it
[25:23] says the angel of the Lord pick up the
[25:27] paper and true in the air when he came
[25:29] down he says your future is
[25:31] clear right don't you know it's a type
[25:35] of
[25:36] you your future is so
[25:39] [Applause]
[25:41] clear
[25:43] that I say sorry I say this Don't Be
[25:50] Afraid by The Arrow that fry by night or
[25:54] by day the Lord is on your side
[25:59] the Lord is on on your side he always
[26:03] protect you he always when you fall down
[26:08] just cry like me I cry a lot because I
[26:13] said my God why couldn't I see this that
[26:17] that that that that the enemy has
[26:19] knocked me down but let me tell you I am
[26:24] not going to stay down I'm not going to
[26:28] I'm I'm not a type of go going
[26:31] back like like something happened I'm
[26:34] going to go back that build me up how to
[26:39] go forward how to go into the
[26:44] trench and fight hard on the
[26:47] enemy because when you fight hard on the
[26:52] enemy you
[26:54] overcome and our enemy is what is not
[26:57] flesh and and
[26:59] blood even if I do you something no good
[27:03] don't look at oh brother Kofi did this
[27:05] brother Kofi did that brother so and so
[27:07] did that sister so so and so did that
[27:10] it's not the sister the enemy is
[27:13] this this this man here his
[27:18] enemy right but look away to Jesus
[27:22] that's what the prophet said when you
[27:25] look what did you see
[27:30] right when we look into this world the
[27:33] way the world is what are we
[27:36] seeing we must see Jesus that the hour
[27:40] is
[27:41] late that the time is at
[27:44] hand that once
[27:48] nyat is serious about going to root
[27:53] Hamas we also must be serious Amen
[27:57] brother going to root any evil thing
[28:00] that is attacking
[28:03] us so that we can be
[28:07] victorious right because the scripture
[28:10] says he that
[28:12] overcometh I will grant him to sit with
[28:16] me in my father's
[28:19] Throne right it didn't say he that go
[28:23] halfway many has come here halfway and
[28:27] they all gone
[28:29] but let not even forget about them when
[28:32] we pray remember them we don't know who
[28:36] the Lord
[28:37] maybe because they were fighting and
[28:40] they get Hur and because they get Hur
[28:44] sometime the devil does that right but
[28:48] when we stick together pray for them and
[28:53] surrender our heart with one
[28:56] Accord then the Lord will do a great
[28:59] thing and the Lord knows who he want who
[29:03] he doesn't want it's not my job not your
[29:07] job
[29:09] God is
[29:11] saying by
[29:14] faith Abel offer a better sacrifice than
[29:18] what king what is Faith
[29:22] Revelation right it is not
[29:26] easy my sister my brother I really let
[29:30] me let me say something tonight if you
[29:34] see a brother or a sister that bring
[29:38] people to
[29:39] Christ let me tell
[29:41] you respect that sister respect that

[31:32] weapon I need to defeat the enemy is
[31:36] there everything that you
[31:39] need God have it for you to defeat the
[31:44] Satan so don't be
[31:47] afraid by faith you can overcome
[31:51] anything all the challenge that enemy
[31:54] through with
[31:56] you before Jacob and Esau was born
[31:59] that's Romans 9:11 when you read it God
[32:05] says I love Jacob I hate Esau because in
[32:08] Jacob has already inside him the
[32:13] token he have the word of God the seed
[32:16] of God in him and so is you and
[32:20] I because that seed lay down there but
[32:23] your flesh is still
[32:28] have Temptation because this was born
[32:31] not
[32:32] by perfect will of God because of the
[32:36] sin that took place in the at Garden of
[32:39] Eden so the enemy will tempt us this
[32:42] sticky nature will stick there till we
[32:45] live here right that's it but don't be
[32:50] afraid don't worry about it the Lord
[32:55] knows how to pull
[32:58] everything that let that seed that he
[33:01] has placed in you come forth you see the
[33:04] Lily the Lily doesn't come from good
[33:08] place nice smooth clean place it come
[33:11] from muddy place but that Lily that Lily
[33:16] pushes out all the garbages all the FI
[33:21] and one day it bring forth nice perfume
[33:27] that that's why we get nice perfume to
[33:30] use if that Lily didn't come out like
[33:33] that there will be no smelling good
[33:37] perfume and that Lily is who you
[33:43] me so
[33:46] God is saying to
[33:48] you have
[33:51] confidence have
[33:53] courage have no fear
[33:58] you will make
[34:02] mistakes listen people think
[34:06] Christianity is holier than thou so as
[34:09] soon as you join
[34:11] Church you are
[34:18] perfect if you're looking for that kind
[34:21] I'm not brother
[34:25] Kofi I'm still here on this Earth
[34:28] right but there's one thing I press
[34:32] towards every day if I make mistake I'm
[34:37] going to make it
[34:38] right and move up
[34:42] further by Revelation I know I can
[34:47] overcome because this work I won't let
[34:50] no Satan distract me because this is one
[34:54] way Tak
[34:55] it in Africa
[34:58] you don't know we that come from
[35:02] Africa some people wanted to come to
[35:06] Europe like me one time I was so small
[35:10] but I tried I wanted to come and I came
[35:13] to Libya
[35:16] Tripoli I didn't have correct papers
[35:18] they put me in
[35:20] jail but in the night I look through the
[35:24] window on the
[35:26] sea and I used to see the Italian
[35:30] light it's
[35:32] far but I says to myself you know what
[35:37] the next time I'm going
[35:39] to make the next trip I'm going to pass
[35:43] over and go to
[35:46] Europe right I'm not coming back to
[35:50] Africa because the life there on my
[35:54] family that time was tough for me
[35:58] so you struggle you struggle you
[36:00] struggle you struggle you do
[36:03] everything and you want to hit the
[36:05] target right you don't want to hit it
[36:08] with a mess but it's like Christianity
[36:12] if you are afraid that you hit the you
[36:15] want to hit targets and you're going to
[36:17] miss and make
[36:19] mess you can't win nothing you can't be
[36:23] a good soldier for the Lord because you
[36:26] going to some time you you you want to
[36:29] strike the enemy then you see the enemy
[36:31] strike
[36:32] you but when you
[36:35] go don't go and said that's the
[36:39] end go
[36:41] back fix your your your ammunition
[36:45] good and attack
[36:48] again with full them the next time you
[36:52] see
[36:54] yourself you go over
[36:58] and what you wanted to achieve for the
[37:00] Lord you got
[37:04] it so is it with we that go to Europe
[37:09] you see so many of them some were even
[37:13] falling to the water dying they picking
[37:16] them bodies but it doesn't stop some of
[37:19] them they turn them back and they come
[37:23] they says we are coming cuz they see
[37:26] that that is the place they go at least
[37:30] they can have some what Natural
[37:35] Freedom so is the gospel the Lord has
[37:40] given to
[37:41] you the faith everything you need is in
[37:44] the word but he says you have to fight
[37:49] it by
[37:51] in you gain ground by inch you gain
[37:56] ground B but there a little here a
[37:59] little right you gain ground so
[38:04] revelation will comes to you by you
[38:08] coming to the
[38:11] service it's
[38:13] true revelation will come to you by you
[38:17] listen to the tape of brother
[38:20] Braham revelation will come to you by
[38:23] you listening to our beloved pastor
[38:25] preaching tiia preaching Christ proper
[38:27] preaching desmon preaching Philip
[38:30] preaching mind preaching there a little
[38:33] here a little yes sir it build you
[38:37] up and you will see
[38:41] that you'll be like a
[38:44] cocoon one day you're going to fly
[38:49] away or you'll be like a sheep you'll be
[38:53] started to produce a genuine mck
[38:58] because the cow don't know how he
[39:00] produce mil he eat the
[39:03] grasses and all he does is it bring
[39:07] forth what
[39:10] mck
[39:11] right a baby all he have to do is when
[39:15] he's hungry he cry and the mother
[39:18] quickly run and prepare the food and you
[39:22] you see her you give it to the baby and
[39:24] the baby just lick it slowly slowly
[39:28] slowly slowly look at you and me that's
[39:30] what has grown Us big as human beings
[39:33] and now even we are talking we walking
[39:36] we doing things but before we were born
[39:40] we didn't know what
[39:42] nothing right
[39:45] so don't stay
[39:49] home I don't encourage people that stay
[39:53] home because the great Holy Spirit don't
[39:57] want you to stay home be in his
[40:03] presence I don't care what you say if
[40:07] you have
[40:09] problem then you stay
[40:12] home problem like maybe your child gets
[40:16] sick something serious has happened that
[40:18] day there's nothing you could do you
[40:20] stay home and or go maybe in the
[40:23] hospital or something serious happen
[40:25] other than that
[40:28] pull yourself out be a soldier because a
[40:33] soldier you are in a
[40:35] battlefield we came to this world this
[40:38] world is not our
[40:41] home this world we are living in is not
[40:44] our home it's a mess it's chaos it's I
[40:47] don't care even if you live in Queen
[40:50] Palace or Vatican is still a
[40:55] mess you B there is still a mess so you
[40:59] need God you need Christ in your life
[41:03] you need
[41:06] Jesus and without him your life can't be
[41:12] complete because he's the one
[41:15] that complete make you
[41:19] complete he is the one
[41:22] that promised
[41:24] Abraham if you check Abraham life in the
[41:28] Bible showing Abraham is a man he
[41:33] lied right am I telling the truth he
[41:39] lie he make mistakes s the Lord even
[41:45] asks s a question s do what
[41:50] lie but Abraham staggered not the
[41:53] promise of
[41:55] God through
[41:58] unbelief what is unbelief sin is
[42:02] unbelief and what is sin if you don't
[42:05] believe what the prophet preached the
[42:08] Bible has
[42:09] said for this day the revealed well of
[42:13] the hour then you are a
[42:16] sinner then you need to come to Under
[42:20] The
[42:21] Altar and
[42:23] repent and baptize in Jesus name the
[42:26] Bible says the promise is unto you unto
[42:29] your children unto the many the Lord Our
[42:31] God shall call
[42:34] amen
[42:36] otherwise then except you believe that
[42:40] you
[42:41] Parish not me saying it the scripture is
[42:44] saying it only Christ can save no man on
[42:48] Earth no Priest No Pope no King no
[42:52] father mother only
[42:55] Jesus can SA
[42:57] so we must rest in
[43:00] him he's our
[43:02] antidote he is the
[43:05] creator that can do all things he's the
[43:09] Creator when we are in
[43:11] problems we goes to him he pick us up
[43:15] and Shel ties in his arm in his wing in
[43:21] his word and
[43:23] leaders
[43:25] because God
[43:28] so loved the world that he gave his only
[43:31] begotten son these are not
[43:33] worse that whosoever believe in him
[43:36] should not what
[43:38] punish God children we cannot do what
[43:43] parish because we have the same
[43:48] material of God in
[43:51] us the same material you are the same
[43:55] material
[43:57] so God cannot destroy you and if God is
[44:02] inside you you
[44:05] cannot wait for
[44:09] fellowship if God is inside
[44:12] you you can't push your brothers and
[44:15] sisters
[44:17] out you will love
[44:20] them you will speak good for them
[44:24] whether they see it whether they don't
[44:28] when Jesus was
[44:29] here he spoke good for the whole
[44:34] world didn't
[44:36] he he spoke good for the whole world but
[44:40] what did the world
[44:42] do turn around and Pierce him put him in
[44:47] the
[44:48] cross and Jesus did he C them no all he
[44:53] says father forgive them they don't know
[44:56] what they doing
[44:58] doing
[45:00] right and many at times as
[45:04] Believers the road is not
[45:08] easy this road Christianity walk let me
[45:12] tell you I said it one time it takes a
[45:16] wise man or a wise woman to be a
[45:20] Christian is easy to become a
[45:25] president or or king of uh Hollywood uh
[45:32] atlete to make billions like Billy
[45:36] gate or apple and all
[45:40] those but take the gospel to
[45:45] them there you will
[45:47] see what the Lord has done for
[45:51] you there you will see that you are the
[45:54] wise men and Wise Women in the world
[45:57] in the eyes of
[46:00] God
[46:02] because wise person is
[46:05] not educated or El literate or
[46:10] rich
[46:12] or
[46:14] popularity wise man is
[46:18] somebody who can catch the word of
[46:23] God and go home and live it and and let
[46:27] the word of God made manifest for his
[46:32] day and it come by what by
[46:39] Revelation it come by
[46:43] Revelation because God
[46:46] word when he give you Revelation you
[46:51] know it you become so
[46:54] certain you become so confident
[46:58] you don't fear
[47:00] nothing even if death is coming to your
[47:04] throne you are not still afraid you know
[47:08] that absent from this body present with
[47:11] the
[47:12] Lord these things are not just written
[47:15] in just paper and ink only cuz remember
[47:18] this Bible was first they used to read
[47:22] it in the
[47:24] sky right wasn't written in the paper to
[47:27] the time of Moses god used to go to them
[47:31] and speak and their heart and they used
[47:33] to speak it and bring
[47:36] it but the Lord allowed it to put it in
[47:39] paper
[47:41] form and what sometime the enemy has
[47:44] does is he has learned the paper form a
[47:48] lot
[47:50] but he forget one thing that God will
[47:55] God is a spirit spirit and they that
[47:58] will worship Him will worship him what
[48:01] in spirit and in truth he deal with his
[48:06] children by what by his
[48:10] Spirit that's why when you make mistake
[48:13] it break your
[48:15] heart am I lying of
[48:17] Truth it break your heart it let you
[48:20] know what you have done is not right
[48:23] says make it
[48:25] right if you you don't make it right
[48:27] you're not going
[48:29] nowhere but if you are true son or
[48:32] daughter of God you cannot
[48:35] wait you are willing to make everything
[48:39] right put it before the table of the
[48:42] Lord and let the Lord deal with it so
[48:45] that the fire of God will fall and burn
[48:48] it so that you will be free so that the
[48:51] glory of God could shine
[48:57] because you know what the enemy has done
[49:01] you know what the enemy has
[49:04] done he tell us oh look at that brother
[49:10] you're going to tell him you do this you
[49:12] have done this you have done this then

[49:19] know your
[49:20] secret then some of them

[54:31] and I lie I know it's not good my wife
[54:34] said oh yeah once you have make it right
[54:39] it's not good but God didn't like
[54:43] it that time the church was a
[54:49] lot and brother Mike was leading the
[54:52] song service in the middle of it he
[54:55] stopped
[54:57] says who have a
[54:58] testimony brother Mike sister Joyce get
[55:01] up and
[55:03] went and testify his
[55:07] testimony and I'm sitting down in the
[55:10] congregation and the spirit of God I
[55:14] could see my heart going boom boom boom
[55:17] boom I don't know what happened it

[56:41] Hosea was blinding Isaiah for Isaiah to
[56:45] see
[56:46] God but the Lord have to take King oiah

[59:41] to let the Lord lead
[59:44] you and when God is leading you it's not
[59:49] you going to do anything he going to
