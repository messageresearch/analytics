[12:06] he doesn't uh he doesn't believe

[12:11] die, you're done. He doesn't believe
[12:13] that there's anything this is all
[12:14] man-made. Everything's man-made and
[12:16] everything like that. And I was trying
[12:17] to show him and just say, "Hey, listen,
[12:18] bro. There's uh good and there's evil
[12:22] all around us. Oh, there is not. There
[12:24] is not. But uh then this song came to
[12:28] me. Who taught the sun
[12:31] where to stand in the morning? Tell me

[16:13] people have no idea. Don't have a clue.

[16:19] into play. And we stand there and we

[21:39] Wednesday night.
[21:41] Scripture said a little flock
[21:45] do not it's your father's will to give
[21:47] you the kingdom where two or three are
[21:49] gathered in his name he said he will be
[21:51] in our midst so I believe he's there
[21:54] with us how many of you enjoy the
[21:57] service on Sunday
[22:00] &gt;&gt; that was a blessing my goodness so
[22:03] blessed I listening to it over and over
[22:05] and whilst listening to it unconsciously
[22:09] I I think my hand touched something that
[22:12] Pastor Sam preached about 5 years ago
[22:14] and it kind of line up with my thoughts.
[22:17] So I'm going to use a lot of that in
[22:19] here. I think it was a changing world
[22:22] during the co time. So I'm going to kind
[22:25] of use the most of his notes over here.
[22:28] I hope he doesn't mind. Okay. So um
[22:31] let's
[22:33] bow our heads and pray.
[22:35] Oh our gracious eternal God. I'm so
[22:38] grateful and thankful that you made a
[22:41] way for us to be here.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Um, if you have done anything
[22:46] wrong, please forgive us. During the
[22:47] day, we we we just at the job site and
[22:51] everything.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; So, we gone through a lot, but the blood
[22:55] of Christ washes from all unbelief and
[22:58] all sins. So, we have confidence that,
[23:01] Father, you can come to thy throne
[23:03] boldly. May you please take him aside
[23:07] this evening and come and possess this
[23:11] vessel and speak to the needs of your
[23:15] children. You know what they have need
[23:17] of. May no one live here the same way
[23:20] they come. May your presence come here
[23:24] as never been before and bless the
[23:26] people because the letter killth but the
[23:28] spirit give life. So we ask for your
[23:30] spirit. We ask for your presence.
[23:33] Anything that be contrary Lord we come
[23:35] against it. May the great Holy Ghost
[23:38] have remnants and even bless those
[23:41] online. Let everyone be blessed in the
[23:44] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I
[23:46] have two scriptures. First one is
[23:49] Matthew 12:39-42.
[24:03] Matthew 12 verse 49 39-42.
[24:09] Okay. Um
[24:14] Oh, okay. 39. But he answered and said
[24:18] unto them, "An evil and adulterous
[24:21] generation seek after a sign, and there
[24:24] shall no sign be given to it, but the
[24:27] sign of the prophet Jonas."
[24:30] For as Jonah was three days and three
[24:32] nights in the wheels belly, so shall the
[24:36] Son of Man be three days and three
[24:38] nights in the heart of the earth.
[24:42] The men of Ninevie shall rise in
[24:45] judgment with this generation and shall
[24:49] condemn it because they repented at the
[24:52] preaching of Jonas and behold a greater
[24:56] than Jonas is here the Lord Jesus Christ
[24:58] a compound meeting doesn't comp
[25:01] scriptures are compound it doesn't mean
[25:03] that way back there it also apply to our
[25:07] day amen but the greater than Solomon is
[25:10] here Um, Matthew
[25:13] John 15:16.
[25:16] That's where I'm going to dwell much on.
[25:19] Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
[25:23] you and ordained you that ye should go
[25:29] and bring forth fruit and that your
[25:32] fruit should remain that whatsoever
[25:36] ye shall ask of the father in my name he
[25:39] may give it to you. Heavenly Father,
[25:43] please bless the written of the word and
[25:45] bless your children in Jesus name. Amen.
[25:48] Please be seated.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if I'll title it, I'll
[25:54] say those ordained to life manifest the
[25:59] promise for their age. If you ordained
[26:02] to life, you manifest the promise for
[26:07] your age that you live in. And you have
[26:10] no choice than to manifest that life
[26:13] because you are part of it. The same way
[26:16] if before you were born there were
[26:18] million gems from your mom and your dad.
[26:20] It's not the first one that met. The one
[26:23] that were ordained to life is the one
[26:25] that came to life and you were born. So
[26:28] even naturally to be born you are one in
[26:30] a million. And spiritually to be born
[26:34] spiritually to a million people perish.
[26:37] And some people they maybe they are
[26:40] fortunate they have all their family
[26:42] part of the word or part of the bride.
[26:45] Some may be one or two
[26:48] out of their family. So you ordained
[26:54] to receive this
[26:57] &gt;&gt; because you have no choice. really you
[26:59] have a choice but God knowing the choice
[27:02] that you're going to make he doesn't
[27:03] wait for you to make the choice first so
[27:05] he he predestinated you to be part of it
[27:09] so you are one in a million and you
[27:12] should even be proud and be happy to be
[27:15] part of that God's attributes because
[27:18] I'm going to base it more in the
[27:20] scriptures about who were ordained to
[27:25] fit in the path of God's it. Amen. So,
[27:29] um for me to start, I I'll talk more
[27:32] about pastor's dispensation that he talk
[27:34] about of innocence. That dispensation of
[27:38] innocence was the time of um Adam and
[27:41] Eve. They were innocent and they were
[27:43] clothed with the light of with God's
[27:46] light and they were living innocent.
[27:48] didn't know anything until that serpent
[27:52] which was devil himself came and what
[27:55] broke thy innocence by defiling Eve and
[27:59] the product that came was killed a wild
[28:02] child and he killed his brother Abel but
[28:06] Abel by faith revelation offered an
[28:10] excellent sacrifice and God testify of
[28:13] it
[28:14] &gt;&gt; so it's not too much about the knowledge
[28:17] but everything is bas based on
[28:19] revelation because without revelation
[28:21] you can never please God and revelation
[28:24] means more to a true believer than
[28:27] anything else that the world can offer.
[28:30] So a true believer anyone who is part of
[28:33] that part of God's attributes who are
[28:36] ordained to life will always depend on
[28:40] revelation but they will not depend on
[28:42] their own canal life or canal senses
[28:45] because somewhere in the scripture said
[28:47] that some people are cannally minded
[28:49] because they always mind the things of
[28:51] the flesh but to be spiritually minded
[28:53] to bind the spirit of God. So there has
[28:56] to be also a balance. And after that
[29:00] time
[29:01] then comes the dispensation of
[29:04] consciousness evil time that the people
[29:07] were very evil. And
[29:11] that evil that happened the time of Noah
[29:15] was so bad
[29:17] that God even repented to create human
[29:20] being. There was immorality in the
[29:23] highest level. But in the midst of all
[29:27] that, the scripture said that Noah found
[29:29] grace in the sight of God.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Him founding that grace, it means that
[29:34] he was ordained to receive that word of
[29:37] God. Him and his family out of the
[29:41] billions were ordained to receive the
[29:44] word to receive the grace of God. And
[29:47] that time
[29:50] um the promise word for that time was
[29:52] the building of an ark.
[29:55] So everyone doesn't matter how much you
[29:58] know the Bible how much you say you a
[30:01] Christian whatever form you are if you
[30:04] do not obey Noah and his message they
[30:08] all perish because they refuse the light
[30:11] that was sent to them. But those who
[30:14] were ordained to life like the Noah wife
[30:18] and his three sons, his sons and the
[30:21] wives, they receive that word of God for
[30:26] their age. And God counted it as
[30:30] righteousness.
[30:32] And if you check in the time of Sodom
[30:35] and Gomorrah, it went through exact same
[30:38] thing. The people they they builded,
[30:42] they planted, they were given in
[30:44] marriages and
[30:47] common law marriage and they even went
[30:52] to the s to such an extent that they
[30:54] went against the natural cause of
[30:57] relationship, sodomy life.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; And God was so angry that he sent a
[31:04] brimstone fire to destroy all of them.
[31:07] But before that took place, he revealed
[31:10] himself to Abraham. And Abraham
[31:14] h as a son of God, we are not the
[31:19] natural seed of Abraham, but we are
[31:21] what? The spiritual the real seed of
[31:24] Abraham.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So naturally Abraham, God
[31:29] visited Abraham in the form of Elohim
[31:32] and reveal himself, revealed the heart
[31:35] of Sarah. And what am I trying to say
[31:38] that anyway if you talk to any average
[31:43] Joe on the street with the condition of
[31:46] this world, they will also tell you that
[31:48] the world is coming to an end. But
[31:51] what's the difference between you as a
[31:53] Christian and those normal believers,
[31:56] normal people? Because the difference is
[32:00] that God visited Abraham.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; So God has also visited his bride in
[32:07] this end time. So being privileged to
[32:11] receive the vindicated prophet of this
[32:14] hour, modern events are being made clear
[32:17] by what? Vindicated prophecy. And we are
[32:20] privileged to receive the prophet's
[32:22] message. And because that the word of
[32:24] God has come to the predestinated seed,
[32:28] we can know what is coming to this world
[32:32] that the normal worldly people have no
[32:35] clue of. They don't know what is going
[32:37] on. They don't know what is happening.
[32:40] They don't know what the scriptures
[32:42] pertain or things that are coming to
[32:46] pass. But you as a bride of Christ by
[32:50] the grace of God, God being a royal seed
[32:54] of Abraham and receiving the message of
[32:56] the hour, our eyes of understanding has
[33:00] been open and we have revelation. We
[33:04] know what is coming to happen. The
[33:07] people in the world have no clue. And uh
[33:11] as I was saying before, some of us is
[33:14] only one person in the family. We not
[33:17] match. But if you are that seed of
[33:21] Abraham, you are that royal seed of
[33:23] Abraham, you will be what? you knowing
[33:27] what is happening, it will put you on
[33:31] your days to intercede for the rest of
[33:34] your normal your your family. Because
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[33:41] when the Lord told him that he was going
[33:43] to destroy that Sodom, Sodom and
[33:47] Gomorrah, he wasn't happy. Oh, they are
[33:49] bad people. Go and destroy them. No, he
[33:52] felt for them and he said, "Oh God, if
[33:54] there will be 50, there was no there
[33:57] will be 20. If there will be 10, then he
[33:59] realized that is is is
[34:03] coming to close. So he just left and God
[34:07] because of his intercession, God saved
[34:11] Lot and his his two children. The wife
[34:17] turned a pillar of salt because why? He
[34:20] refused the promise the to obey the word
[34:24] of God. That's why the Bible said that
[34:26] obedience is better than sacrifice.
[34:29] That's what Saul did. God told Saul
[34:33] destroy all the children, the kings,
[34:36] everything. But he be have a human
[34:40] sympathy and he kept them. The best
[34:43] part. God doesn't need your sacrifice.
[34:46] He need obedience.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Obedience is better than sacrifice.
[34:50] That's why in the token Abraham
[34:52] explained that total obedience to the
[34:55] full word of God entitles one to what?
[34:57] To the token obedience is better than
[35:00] sacrifice. And as a true bride of
[35:03] Christ, this word of God is our
[35:05] absolute. No matter what anyone says, we
[35:09] depend on God's word. We depend on the
[35:11] revelation of the word and we obey it.
[35:15] Amen. So that obedience entitles you to
[35:18] the token. Hallelujah.
[35:22] And I'm going to when you come to the
[35:26] time that the Lord Jesus Christ came,
[35:33] when the Lord Jesus Christ came, it was
[35:36] the dispensation
[35:38] from law to grace.
[35:42] and the the the Pharisees and the
[35:47] Sadducees and all those people were
[35:51] living in the law.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; But God
[35:55] came in the form of he came himself as a
[36:01] he came as a um God as a spirit could
[36:04] not die. So the spirit created a body to
[36:07] live in and was pro promoting grace to
[36:11] them. But they rejected grace and took
[36:14] the law and the very law that they were
[36:19] talking about God was extending his
[36:22] grace to them but they refused to walk
[36:26] with the grace. So what am I trying to
[36:29] say that those who were ordained to life
[36:33] were attracted
[36:35] by his ministry.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Even though the disciples they did not
[36:42] understand when he said I and my father
[36:45] are one they don't understand when he
[36:47] said except eat of my flesh and was
[36:50] except eat of my flesh and drink of my
[36:53] blood you have no part in me but they
[36:56] believe it but the rest walk away and
[37:00] walk with him no more
[37:03] in St. In John 6 it was reduced. It was
[37:06] like 500 it came to 70
[37:10] and did not walk with him anymore. But
[37:13] one time he has said that except the son
[37:16] of man who is standing here now also in
[37:19] heaven and they said this was so much
[37:23] and they all left. It was left only 12
[37:26] and one was of the devil out of the 12.
[37:29] So what I'm trying to say is that it
[37:32] went on
[37:34] to the crucifixion
[37:36] and when they crucified him there a lot
[37:40] of scriptures were fulfilled on that day
[37:45] and
[37:47] I'm going to read this this here. I
[37:50] think I have so many couple of things to
[37:51] read. I hope you don't mind. Notice now
[37:55] they had done to him just exactly
[37:59] and this modern events are made clear by
[38:02] prophecy. Paragraph 263.
[38:05] Notice now they had done to him just
[38:08] exactly what the prophet said they will
[38:10] do just as they are doing to this very
[38:14] same day in the Lician age. If you want
[38:18] to look at it, read Revelation 3. blind,
[38:22] naked, and don't know it. Turning Christ
[38:26] when he begins to reveal himself into
[38:28] the seed form again, the same one that
[38:32] went in the ground come back to be the
[38:35] bride. Just the bride and groom is the
[38:38] same flesh and blood, the same ministry,
[38:42] the same things doing just exactly what
[38:46] he done. the spirit and
[38:49] a lot of scriptures were fulfilled on
[38:51] that day because it's Wednesday is a
[38:54] um Bible Bible study. I'm going to read
[38:57] most of the scriptures. Now you look at
[39:00] Zechariah 12. It costed for he was sold
[39:04] with 30 pieces of silver. Was not the
[39:08] Messiah supposed to be sold by 30 piece
[39:10] of silver? Now look in Zechariah 12 in
[39:14] Psalms 41:9.
[39:17] Grace, you can put that on for me. He
[39:20] was betrayed by what? By his friends
[39:24] in Zechariah 13:7,
[39:27] forsaken by his disciples
[39:31] in Psalms 35:11, accused of false
[39:34] witnesses.
[39:36] Isaiah 35:7
[39:39] dumb before his accusers never open his
[39:42] mouth. Isaiah 56 he was scorched. Psalm
[39:47] 22:22
[39:49] He cried at the cross, "My God, why hast
[39:52] thou forsaken me? All the bones they
[39:55] stare at me. They pierced my hands and
[39:59] my feet." Isaiah 96, "Unto rest a child
[40:02] is born. A virgin shall conceive so
[40:05] forth. And also in Psalm 2:18, they
[40:08] parted his garments among them. In
[40:11] Isaiah 7:14,
[40:13] a virgin shall conceived. Psalm 22:78
[40:17] may be mocked by his enemies. He's
[40:21] supposed to be friends, his enemies, the
[40:23] church. In Psalm 22 again, he was not a
[40:27] bone was to be broken, but they pierced
[40:30] his hands and his feet. In Isaiah 53:12,
[40:35] died with male factors. In Isaiah 53:9,
[40:38] bruised and buried with a rich brother.
[40:42] In Psalm 16:10, he was resurrected from
[40:45] the dead. David says, "So, I'll not
[40:47] suffer my holy one to see corruption,
[40:50] neither will I leave his soul in hell."
[40:53] All these scriptures fulfilled. And
[40:57] those very people who had crucified him
[41:01] were also at the church and
[41:04] they didn't know what they were doing.
[41:07] But on the way to Emmos, Abraham said as
[41:10] he explained to those two people because
[41:14] they are ordained to life. When the Lord
[41:16] Jesus Christ explained all these
[41:18] scriptures them, their eyes of
[41:21] understanding pop open and they
[41:23] recognize that it was their friend who
[41:26] the scripture was talking about because
[41:29] they were ordained to life. Even though
[41:32] they did not catch it exactly when it
[41:34] happened but because they ordained to
[41:37] life God has to come to them and reveal
[41:40] it to him. So it is the believers
[41:44] sometimes some of us will catch the
[41:46] revelation first but as time goes on if
[41:50] it's time for you to know God will come
[41:53] to you and make that scripture real to
[41:55] you because the letter killer but the
[41:57] spirit giveth life. But this is not a
[41:59] race.
[42:01] This is thing that you have to live the
[42:04] best that you can
[42:06] &gt;&gt; and when there is time for you to know
[42:08] God will appear to you. God will let
[42:11] that scripture become so clear that the
[42:13] same scripture that maybe you have read
[42:14] it over and over it pop up your eyes
[42:18] open. It becomes so clear and so I don't
[42:21] know how to express it that you can't
[42:23] even it becomes so simple and so clear
[42:27] to you and the then you also able to
[42:31] what manifest that scripture because
[42:33] that has become part of you but it's not
[42:37] a race
[42:39] it's patience
[42:42] &gt;&gt; wait on the Lord when it's time for him
[42:45] to reveal himself to you he will do it
[42:48] because he's the same yesterday, today,
[42:51] and forever.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; So when the Lord Jesus Christ died, he
[42:57] gave up the ghost. When he gave out the
[43:00] ghost, he gave a spirit. And when that
[43:03] happened on the day of Pentecost,
[43:06] 120
[43:08] who were ordained to life, they went
[43:11] there to receive a spirit. And after
[43:14] them 3,000 people also what received
[43:19] that same spirit because they were
[43:20] ordained to life. And if you read in
[43:23] Acts chapter 2 verse 47,
[43:33] sorry in Acts 2:47,
[43:36] praising God and having favor with all
[43:40] the people and the Lord added to the
[43:42] church daily such as should be saved.
[43:46] So you are here tonight
[43:49] because God ordained you to be here.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; You even didn't come here by chance as
[43:56] the same Holy Spirit that led Anna and
[44:00] and Simon to that new birth child. That
[44:03] same Holy Ghost have led you here. Have
[44:05] led you to receive this word of God.
[44:08] Some of us 30 years, 40 years, 50 years.
[44:11] What came to you? You think you yourself
[44:13] decide one day to do it? No. because
[44:16] there was a attribute some part of you
[44:18] that was thirsting for God. So when the
[44:21] right time came that word came to you
[44:23] and you could not what res resist it
[44:26] something in you said this is truth
[44:29] something you said this is right and you
[44:31] couldn't get away from it because you
[44:34] are part of him and you are ordained to
[44:38] receive what this word for your age
[44:41] without you being ordained to receive it
[44:44] you cannot receive it just like the
[44:47] scripture that we read about the Queen
[44:52] of Sheba.
[44:55] That Queen of Sheba
[44:58] was also ordained to life.
[45:02] Even though
[45:04] she was an adulteress,
[45:08] they were worshiping idols
[45:11] and her family all that she knew from
[45:15] her birth.
[45:17] But because there was a part of God in
[45:20] her, when she heard about the wisdom of
[45:24] Solomon, when she heard what is going on
[45:27] in Solomon's life, something begin to
[45:31] burn in her heart. She begin to want to
[45:35] have a taste of that. She wanted to know
[45:38] about that God of Solomon. Something was
[45:42] yearning in her to see that power of
[45:45] God, to see that wisdom. And you think
[45:48] that it was easy for her. Bra explained
[45:51] that his priest when he told him that
[45:54] she want to go there, they said you
[45:56] cannot go. And they prevented her to go.
[46:01] But once she heard it and seed in her,
[46:05] she can't rest. She can't listen to what
[46:10] they were saying. She ignored that
[46:12] advice. She ignored that thing and she
[46:16] went there what
[46:18] 3 months journey that she walk. No
[46:22] wonder the Bible said that she rise up
[46:24] and judge this generation because
[46:27] greater than Solomon is here.
[46:30] And when she was going, she went with
[46:34] all with um with gifts. She just didn't
[46:39] go by herself. She went with gifts to
[46:42] give to Solomon and and and said in her
[46:44] heart, if this is truth, I'll give this
[46:48] gift to her. If it's not true, I'll come
[46:52] back with my gift.
[46:54] So
[46:56] what am I trying to say? The disciples,
[47:01] you know, they followed the Lord Jesus
[47:03] Christ and they realized that what the
[47:09] Lord has was 100% truth and because they
[47:15] have that revelation and realized that
[47:18] it was thus said the Lord is life in it
[47:21] and they were ordained to life. Everyone
[47:24] of them gave their life or this gospel.
[47:29] Peter told them not to crucify him with
[47:32] head up. Crucify was with with his head
[47:34] down and all of them received capital
[47:39] punishment.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; The federal
[47:42] the federal government persecuted all of
[47:45] them and that spirit is still here with
[47:48] us.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; And they gave their all.
[47:54] Thomas
[47:56] Steven was stolen.
[47:59] But because
[48:02] the gospel was a real to him, he didn't
[48:06] curse his accusers.
[48:09] But he looked beyond that
[48:13] and said, "Lord, do not hold their sins
[48:16] against them."
[48:18] Not knowing Paul was there. So being
[48:22] Paul being a seed of God,
[48:26] Steven cannot say anything to what to
[48:29] destroy that. So God has to give grace
[48:33] to Paul because of him. All those people
[48:36] did not get a what? Were forgiven. And a
[48:41] true believer, you always have a
[48:43] forgiven spirit.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the people has
[48:47] done.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. As our pastor was preaching last
[48:50] that time talking about the fifth
[48:52] dimension, I was dealing with a
[48:54] situation. But after that thing came, it
[48:59] became so clear to me realized these
[49:03] people dealing with me are being
[49:05] influenced by that fifth dimension
[49:08] without even them being aware. I began
[49:10] to pray to them for them. I began to
[49:13] pray and project life to the situation
[49:16] and God came in and changed every
[49:18] situation around. So as a believer you
[49:20] have to discern sometimes is not the
[49:23] people is the influence they are being
[49:27] influenced. They are not even aware of
[49:29] what they are being influenced. But you
[49:31] and I have the power of God to release
[49:34] them to free them to deliver them from
[49:36] that by your prayer and everything. It
[49:39] changes everything. When I was just
[49:41] coming was saying that some people you
[49:45] long to be in the atmosphere
[49:47] &gt;&gt; some of them you can't even stand for
[49:48] even a minute and he was given an
[49:51] example that when he comes home he see
[49:54] that maybe his daughter was crying this
[49:57] this going on that's going on and what
[50:00] he has to do he has to just pray and say
[50:02] things contrary to what to change the
[50:05] atmosphere.
[50:07] So you have the power to change the
[50:10] atmosphere and live in atmosphere that
[50:13] you want.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Don't allow the circumstances to put you
[50:18] in that. When you realize that it's not
[50:21] the people, if the devil is anointing
[50:24] them to speak negative things, speak
[50:26] opposite.
[50:28] Bring life to the situation. Let the
[50:31] people be conscious of what is going on.
[50:33] And we remember darkness cannot stand in
[50:37] light.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; So light will always overcome darkness.
[50:42] So as you began to speak those positive
[50:46] with faith,
[50:48] &gt;&gt; not looking at the condition, it changed
[50:51] the situation
[50:52] &gt;&gt; and the whole atmosphere will change in
[50:55] your eyes.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; You will see God on the scene.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; You will see the presence of God in the
[51:00] situation and everything will be clear.
[51:03] Amen. So we have the power in the name
[51:06] of Jesus to change every situation. We
[51:09] got the power and authority. So don't
[51:12] allow any circumstances to bring you
[51:14] down. Don't allow the those people who
[51:18] are influenced from the fifth dimension
[51:19] to bring you down. But our influence
[51:22] come from the seventh and the sixth
[51:23] dimension. We are influence come from
[51:25] the presence of God. And being that we
[51:29] we are able to what? change situations
[51:31] and live the way God wants us to live.
[51:34] Amen. So
[51:37] what am I saying? Jesus Christ the same
[51:40] yesterday, today and forever. So that
[51:44] queen of Sheba
[51:46] when she went into the presence of
[51:51] Solomon and it was her time to come the
[51:55] Bible said that there was nothing hidden
[51:57] from Solomon about her.
[52:00] God revealed all her life to Solomon
