[17:55] foreign
[17:58] [Music]
[18:03] foreign
[18:22] God bless you Saints it's good to be
[18:24] once again
[18:28] at another another Crossroads
[18:33] praise God every time we we cross into a
[18:36] new year
[18:37] we're leaving the past in the past by
[18:39] the grace of God like the scripture says
[18:42] leaving those old things behind and
[18:45] looking forward to the new things that
[18:47] are coming forth and for us as Sons and
[18:50] Daughters of God it's all about the word
[18:52] of God
[18:53] and the uh the the word in its season
[18:57] and I know that 2022 has been just a a
[19:01] tremendous year
[19:02] of Revelation that's been uh given to
[19:08] the Sons and Daughters of God and the
[19:10] responsibility of that Revelation to
[19:12] live the word and to allow it to
[19:15] interpret itself because as we've been
[19:18] hearing over the last year God is his
[19:22] own interpreter and he's here now on the
[19:25] scene interpreting his own word
[19:28] and uh he's by his grace using each and
[19:33] every one of us as the attributes of God
[19:37] you know it's a wonderful thing
[19:39] when you think about it as an attribute
[19:42] you were always in God
[19:45] and everything that he overcame when he
[19:48] came here you already overcame
[19:51] the victory was given
[19:54] and we can live a Victorious free
[19:58] like never before
[20:00] we are the freest people on this planet
[20:03] and we should be living that way we
[20:05] should be
[20:07] feeling and experiencing that revelation
[20:10] of the liberty of the Sons and Daughters
[20:13] of God coming into full manifestation
[20:17] you know um
[20:19] 2022 was uh was a an amazing year
[20:24] um personally
[20:26] um you know in in many ways a lot of ups
[20:29] and a lot of downs
[20:31] um each and every one of us uh have to
[20:34] deal with the Paradox of Being Human
[20:37] and being a son of God
[20:39] and God has uh you know gifted and
[20:42] placed certain characteristics in each
[20:45] and every one of us to manifest
[20:48] and those characteristics that he's
[20:51] placed there they're going to get tested
[20:53] they're going to be tested for the real
[20:56] character of Christ to see how you
[20:58] respond how you react you know to
[21:01] certain situations and circumstances and
[21:04] God is watching those things he's he's
[21:06] mindful of those things you know I had
[21:08] an experience this year
[21:11] um as a human
[21:13] uh you know I was I was unloading things
[21:16] out of my vehicle in my underground
[21:18] there and I pull my vehicle up to the
[21:21] door
[21:22] and um you know I unload all my stuff
[21:25] but if somebody happens to come in
[21:26] behind me then uh I you know I asked
[21:31] them oh I'm finished can you just back
[21:33] up about you know 30 40 feet and allow
[21:37] me to just back my truck into my spot
[21:39] and
[21:41] you know I've done it like countless
[21:43] number of times and every single
[21:45] neighbor has been oh yeah no problem Dan
[21:47] they back it up you know I back my truck
[21:50] in thank you well
[21:53] just so happened you know I went nicely
[21:56] over to the neighbor and I said hey you
[21:57] know sorry I just finished unloading
[21:59] with you back up please you know and he
[22:02] looked at me and he says no
[22:05] and and uh and you know as a human right
[22:09] I thought oh
[22:11] I said well that's not neighborly
[22:14] you know and and like I reacted in a
[22:17] certain way
[22:18] and I called him a
[22:23] and
[22:24] every single time
[22:27] that I've ever asked anybody they've
[22:28] always moved and you you kind of expect
[22:31] that to happen
[22:33] but you know and right up until the
[22:35] moment that I had done it and everything
[22:36] else I felt that was fine and everything
[22:38] you know and I just went I said okay
[22:41] fine I pulled my truck because I had to
[22:43] go up all the way up back up to Brandt
[22:45] Street turn around and come back in and
[22:47] let him go by
[22:49] but uh anyways you know a few days go by
[22:52] right and every time I drive out
[22:56] I'd see his vehicle
[22:58] and the Lord started to talk to me
[23:01] and he said that guy had every right
[23:06] to say no
[23:09] he had every right
[23:11] he you were in the wrong
[23:13] just because
[23:15] 98 of the people that you asked
[23:19] were kind enough to do it
[23:22] it doesn't mean that
[23:24] you know and it was like it was strange
[23:26] and I felt so bad
[23:28] and I thought oh man
[23:31] I gotta I gotta make that right
[23:34] and you know it's funny because today
[23:38] my wife and I were sent were talking
[23:40] about you know things and saying you
[23:41] know
[23:42] you know like what do you think about
[23:44] 2022 and we were just talking about it
[23:47] and you know what would you see change
[23:49] in 2023 and we were talking about those
[23:51] things and what kind of things would you
[23:52] like to leave behind and everything else
[23:55] this thought about this guy that wasn't
[23:57] even in my mind
[23:58] but anyways
[24:01] um I said Jen you know what after we
[24:03] finished talking I said I'm going to go
[24:04] for a nice walk before dinner feel more
[24:06] Justified to really have a good meal
[24:09] and so I went for a long walk but as I
[24:11] walked out the door and I'm walking out
[24:14] there he is
[24:17] I said hey neighbor
[24:19] and he looked over he goes hey
[24:21] I go listen I just want to make
[24:24] something right that was absolutely
[24:27] wrong what I said and what I did that
[24:30] time and I apologize and I you know I'm
[24:34] asking you to forgive me oh come on man
[24:36] no problem no problem you know and we we
[24:39] touched and I said I just you know this
[24:41] is a great way to end the year I said to
[24:45] him
[24:45] and it felt so good
[24:49] and I said Lord
[24:51] you never forget
[24:54] and I so appreciated that little thing
[24:57] and because the timing of it was like it
[25:00] had to be God
[25:01] I want to go for a walk and there he is
[25:03] you know what I mean so anyways praise
[25:06] God
[25:06] um those are the little things that God
[25:08] you know wants to you know it sounds
[25:09] like really simple but you know we're
[25:12] human
[25:13] uh we're going to make mistakes but the
[25:16] blood of Christ
[25:17] justifies us as though we never done it

[42:58] glory to God you know I was listening to
[43:00] brother dany's testimony
[43:02] there and one of the scriptures that
[43:04] came to me this week it was it said I
[43:07] let the words
[43:08] of my mouth and the meditation of my
[43:11] heart be acceptable and pleasing in your
[43:14] sight
[43:15] and I thought about that scripture and
[43:18] that's one of the things I mean
[43:20] not make it a resolution but it's more
[43:23] of Lord sometimes things might come out
[43:26] of my mouth external you know you want
[43:29] God to help you to be better you know
[43:32] like that person that that road rage or
[43:34] somebody at work might say something and
[43:36] you might say something back or or the
[43:38] internal part was what's he meditating
[43:40] on
[43:42] about Unity
[43:45] so they
[43:46] take my brother speak about it a
[43:48] confession and I add this confession of
[43:50] my my mouth I wanted things that is
[43:52] right to come out of my mouth Lord for
[43:53] this year and whatever I meditate on is
[43:56] the right things you know sometimes we
[43:57] find ourselves you know thinking about
[43:59] all the problems we have but he wants us
[44:01] to be acceptable what we meditate is not
[44:03] be acceptable unto him so everybody Mike
[44:07] is going to come and give us a testimony
[44:08] and you may be seated
[44:22] well praise the Lord
[44:27] testimonies
[44:28] are a great thing
[44:31] none of us have one except that Lord
[44:33] give us give us a testimony right so and
[44:37] uh even even just a few minutes ago I
[44:39] was sitting there
[44:42] and Satan was just all just battering at
[44:45] me saying don't give that testimony
[44:47] don't give that testimony don't give
[44:48] that testimony like that and I was
[44:50] thinking how am I going to get out of
[44:51] this how am I going to get out of this
[44:54] seriously and then the next thing I hear
[44:57] is I know the master of the Wind
[45:04] that's what this testimony is all about
[45:06] you'll see
[45:09] so
[45:14] uh
[45:15] brother Brandon said that he was a
[45:17] typologist and he also said that God
[45:20] himself is a typologist
[45:22] so it behooves us I think we should be
[45:24] typologists as well right not fanatics
[45:26] but see the types in the shadows and
[45:29] everything like that and as I'm going
[45:30] through this
[45:33] um just uh
[45:34] you know you'll see the types and
[45:36] shadows and where we're at
[45:38] this is not a 2022 kind of testimony
[45:42] it's uh it happened last week
[45:45] and the Lord really laid it on my heart
[45:47] to speak it because you know to me it
[45:51] was it was a tremendous thing and uh
[45:54] it's it's been with me every day since
[45:56] waking up in the morning thinking
[45:59] seen it and you know
[46:02] just sweeping and crying and saying
[46:04] thank you Lord
[46:07] um
[46:08] last
[46:09] week going on going into Christmas
[46:13] we always go up to sister Elaine's
[46:16] parents place and and spend Christmas
[46:19] there in Quebec
[46:21] and we heard about how many heard about
[46:23] the the oncoming storm
[46:26] the one that was a generational storm
[46:28] that was a a storm of this Century or
[46:33] whatever you wanted to call the thing
[46:34] and uh it was coming and it was going to
[46:37] hit on the Friday and that was the the
[46:39] day before uh Christmas Eve and her
[46:42] their celebration is always on Christmas
[46:44] Eve on the 24th
[46:46] and we we always try to be there for the
[46:48] 24th we all we've always been there for
[46:49] the 24th and and and uh had a dinner
[46:52] with their family and whatnot
[46:54] but um her mom just had an operation uh
[46:57] a minor operation that went very well
[46:59] and and uh
[47:01] I had to work on Friday and Michelle and
[47:03] Madeline both had to work on Friday and
[47:05] so we sent sister Elaine and and my
[47:08] other daughter Sarah
[47:10] up on Thursday before the storm
[47:13] right and and they left on Thursday and
[47:16] they went up to go back and spend a
[47:18] little bit more time
[47:20] and uh got there safely everything was
[47:22] good
[47:23] and of course on Friday we had the rain
[47:26] and we had the um flash freezing and
[47:30] we've had the snow and you you went
[47:31] through it right and it was a big event
[47:34] and they actually closed the the schools
[47:37] on Friday
[47:39] um
[47:40] and both Michelle and I are educational
[47:42] workers so we we had the day off uh snow
[47:45] day as they say and it was great but but
[47:48] Madeline she had to uh she had a shift
[47:51] late at night at Subway and and she
[47:52] really couldn't turn it down because
[47:55] um she hadn't been working because of
[47:56] the her exams and everything so she had
[47:58] to she had to go into work she worked at
[47:59] midnight Friday night
[48:01] so I said okay
[48:03] um we'll get up we'll go fry Saturday
[48:05] morning and we'll we'll head down to
[48:07] Quebec
[48:09] if everything is okay
[48:11] if the roads are okay and everything is
[48:13] all right because this thing was big on
[48:15] Friday and
[48:16] so I was checking the uh everything I
[48:19] could get on the internet and everything
[48:20] every time I put in the 401
[48:23] um road conditions it would always come
[48:26] up
[48:27] for about the London you hear about the
[48:29] London accidents that took place in
[48:31] London Ontario well that's the other way
[48:32] okay Montreal is the other way and I
[48:35] could never get anything about between
[48:38] Toronto and Montreal about 401
[48:40] conditions
[48:42] so I thought okay the storm went through
[48:43] on on on Friday
[48:45] and um
[48:48] we're going on Saturday
[48:50] and we'll see what it's like Saturday
[48:52] morning so I got up Saturday morning
[48:54] looked at the window five o'clock in the
[48:55] morning nothing had changed since the
[48:57] night before everything was peaceful
[48:59] calm quiet I said okay girls let's go
[49:02] we'll we'll head out
[49:05] um
[49:06] we left at 705. a little bit of Grace in
[49:09] there
[49:10] and we needed it believe me
[49:13] um and we got across Toronto in record
[49:16] time it seemed like nobody was on the
[49:18] road everybody was saying opting out but
[49:21] the roads were perfect Toronto was
[49:23] fantastic we got on the other side
[49:25] and I called my son Ben because he was
[49:28] coming up uh two hours later he was
[49:29] leaving at nine and he was going to be
[49:31] coming up with his fiancee and uh called
[49:34] him up and I said Ben I said man we made
[49:37] it across Toronto record time
[49:38] everything's good
[49:40] everything's fantastic he goes okay Dad
[49:43] we're getting ready to leave too you
[49:44] know we'll be leaving at about nine
[49:45] o'clock I said all right you know give
[49:47] me a call and I'll let you know of any
[49:49] any problems come up or whatever happens
[49:51] I said all right
[49:53] so but before we left
[49:57] um the Lord was kind of really dealing
[49:59] with my heart
[50:00] because I was getting kind of nervous
[50:01] about this thing I've been in I've
[50:03] driven in bad bad conditions before but
[50:06] uh anyway so I I said okay
[50:10] uh so before we left we prayed
[50:14] and I knew
[50:16] that I had to speak
[50:18] a word
[50:20] it wasn't something that is just off the
[50:22] top of your head no it was something
[50:24] that was impressed upon me and I said
[50:25] let there be
[50:27] blue skies and sunshine
[50:31] along the way
[50:33] in the name of the Lord let it be like
[50:35] that and the girl said amen and looked
[50:38] at me because everything was gray and
[50:40] everything but anyway so we left we got
[50:42] we got into
[50:44] um
[50:45] Port Hope which is on the other side of
[50:47] Toronto
[50:49] and when we did
[50:51] the road conditions began to change we
[50:53] lost one lane became snowy
[50:56] but it still it wasn't bad it's okay we
[50:59] lost one lane
[51:01] and we started driving like that and but
[51:04] as we were driving we started to see
[51:07] what was happening the day before
[51:10] I mean we saw a car
[51:12] you know if you if you go down the
[51:14] highway on one lane like that and then
[51:15] there's an off ramp and there's a guard
[51:17] rail that comes on an angle and comes
[51:19] like a little little angle like that
[51:22] there was a vehicle that was on top of
[51:25] the guardrail
[51:26] setting about this High I said how did
[51:29] that get there and not only that but
[51:31] what is it still doing there and how did
[51:33] those people get out of there so we
[51:35] started to see signs of of of
[51:37] tribulation
[51:40] trouble was on the horizon I mean
[51:45] it's a
[51:46] you know I may remember the Twilight
[51:47] Zone it was like the Twilight Zone and
[51:50] anyway you started moving like that and
[51:52] then of course you saw vehicles in the
[51:53] ditch over here all from yesterday's
[51:55] storm
[51:58] and we thought okay
[52:00] as we drove a little bit further
[52:02] we uh we came to a town called kohlberg
[52:06] and Coburg is is the place where we
[52:07] always stop it has two uh
[52:12] off-ramps exits to Coburg
[52:15] one first one and the second one
[52:18] I know the 401 between Toronto Montreal
[52:21] like the back of my hand
[52:23] um we always get off at the second one
[52:24] it has a Tim Hortons it has gas stations
[52:26] has everything we need so I said okay
[52:28] we're going to get off at the second one
[52:31] we're going to look for kohlberg
[52:34] the only problem is
[52:37] the storm got worse and worse and the
[52:40] wind started to pick up
[52:42] it was going like 100 kilometers an hour
[52:44] it was we were we started to go about 20
[52:47] kilometers an hour
[52:49] um
[52:50] and I I said okay we're going to get off
[52:53] at the second exit
[52:55] the only problem was
[52:58] we went past the first exit so I thought
[53:00] the second exit was the first exit
[53:02] because we didn't even see the first
[53:04] exit because you couldn't see the first
[53:06] exit because the wind was blowing like
[53:08] that I said okay number one phone bin
[53:12] we phoned up man we said Ben and caught
[53:14] him he was sitting in his car getting
[53:16] ready to pull I said forget it
[53:18] I wouldn't have my worst enemy come into
[53:21] this disaster right and uh
[53:24] so he said okay dad we'll come tomorrow
[53:26] so doctor said you do that
[53:29] so we went past kohlberg we missed we
[53:31] missed getting off the highway and we
[53:33] started seeing signs those construction
[53:35] signs that they put on on the side of
[53:38] the highway Kaplan it said 401 it's
[53:40] closed
[53:41] the next one 401 is closed and I was
[53:44] thinking okay
[53:45] obviously it's not closed I'm driving on
[53:48] it
[53:49] what does it mean 401 is closed
[53:52] and I thought maybe somewhere down the
[53:55] road they've closed the highway and I'm
[53:57] going to have to get off and go around
[53:58] and come back on or something like that
[53:59] anyway so we're going along like that in
[54:02] in this the snow was blowing the wind
[54:05] was uh fierce
[54:07] we all had our hazards on
[54:10] for the rest of the trip the hazards
[54:12] were going to Blink they're blinking and
[54:13] I was following the car in front of me
[54:16] and uh you would call it White Knuckle
[54:19] driving
[54:20] except for
[54:22] for one thing is for me I
[54:24] for some reason I just
[54:27] was not what didn't have no White
[54:29] Knuckles I didn't have no no pressure at
[54:30] all I was just driving and
[54:32] thinking okay this is really something
[54:36] um
[54:37] they have on the highway as I'm sure you
[54:39] know they have those on route
[54:42] gas stations we're in Tim Hortons and
[54:43] all that stuff you can it's it's on the
[54:45] highway you can get off and get right
[54:47] back on and one came up
[54:50] so we got off at this on route
[54:52] because we wanted we hadn't eaten
[54:54] anything or
[54:55] and uh
[54:58] inside when we walked inside there were
[55:02] hundreds of people
[55:04] and they're all setting down in in the
[55:06] in in the seating area and everything
[55:08] like that I thought
[55:10] that's pretty strange we went to the
[55:12] washroom and then passed your Simon
[55:13] calls
[55:15] but am I did you end up going I said
[55:17] yeah we're in the middle of it right now
[55:18] I was so glad to to know that uh you've
[55:21] said well have a good trip and
[55:23] everything like that and and I said okay
[55:25] thanks I was on his mind
[55:28] and I was glad for that
[55:30] we went to the Tim Hortons in the en
[55:31] route
[55:32] they didn't have any food
[55:36] and uh
[55:38] said you don't have any food what's
[55:40] going on here
[55:43] all they had and it was in the store
[55:44] across the way was was just a few
[55:46] chocolate bars and stuff like that and
[55:48] we realized and and the employees said
[55:50] they'd been there for 30 hours
[55:52] you hadn't gone home
[55:54] all those people were people who got off
[55:57] the highway
[55:58] and we're set staying put and they've
[56:00] been there for a day
[56:02] and I looked at that and I I just said
[56:08] that ain't me I'm not sitting here I can
[56:09] tell you that much
[56:11] so
[56:13] I just said come on girls you're ready
[56:14] to go they go yeah we're ready to go so
[56:15] we got in the car and we we started
[56:17] going again
[56:18] and this time we got on on the highway
[56:20] and uh
[56:21] started going to Kingston and and Elaine
[56:23] was in in Montreal and and they were
[56:26] having the dinner that night and and we
[56:28] were in contact she was asking us how it
[56:30] was going and she's and we started
[56:32] telling her and
[56:34] it got to the place where she was
[56:36] phoning us every half an hour because
[56:38] you know where she was there was nothing
[56:40] going on but there was a blizzard in her
[56:43] in her heart because she knew that we
[56:45] were in that far from going off the road
[56:49] at any particular time
[56:51] and it just got worse and worse so she
[56:54] was calling us and and giving us
[56:56] Alternatives and
[56:58] saying the road conditions in Quebec are
[57:00] good and uh and and so on and so forth
[57:03] and
[57:05] then Sarah started calling and and it
[57:07] was just like
[57:09] we could see that the concern was
[57:10] getting greater on their site
[57:12] so
[57:14] they informed the family and everybody
[57:15] about uh what was uh happening that we
[57:19] may not make it for dinner I didn't
[57:20] think we were going to make it for
[57:21] dinner and and
[57:24] but I was so glad that uh those that had
[57:26] gone on before us
[57:28] started getting desperate
[57:31] and Elaine and Sarah and they were
[57:35] um because
[57:37] then without us cannot be made perfect
[57:39] you know that huh
[57:40] and uh
[57:42] they were getting desperate
[57:44] in all eyes for those who've gone on
[57:47] before
[57:48] on us watching us as we went down the
[57:51] highway
[57:54] um
[57:55] but for me all I could hear
[57:58] was Press On
[58:00] Press On
[58:01] keep on going through the storm
[58:04] anyway
[58:06] uh I believe the focus in heaven is on
[58:10] this little bride right now
[58:12] and uh what's happening right here and
[58:15] right now
[58:16] no wonder there's silence in heaven you
[58:18] know who's here right
[58:21] all right
[58:22] so we were following the car ahead of us
[58:24] and his lights were he had his hazards
[58:27] on and all I could see was the car in
[58:29] front of me and the car behind me
[58:31] it's all I could see you couldn't see
[58:32] beyond anything else
[58:35] and then we passed through uh um they're
[58:37] going about 30 kilometers an hour and
[58:39] all of a sudden we passed through a
[58:41] stretch of highway where there was like
[58:44] nine or ten cars there were cars in the
[58:46] ditches all over the place that goes
[58:47] without saying but these cars were all
[58:49] spun out on the highway
[58:53] and we just drove through I knew we
[58:55] couldn't touch our brakes because it
[58:57] would have been sheer ice we would have
[58:58] been all over the place
[58:59] and people were getting out of their
[59:01] cars
[59:03] and it was quite again
[59:05] surreal it was It was kind of
[59:07] unbelievable and here we were just
[59:09] moving through don't touch your brakes
[59:11] because they're all you're going to join
[59:13] them and uh
[59:14] and just looking at these people getting
[59:16] out of the cars in in disaster and
[59:18] everything happening and off we went
[59:20] next thing I know a trailer a tractor
[59:23] trailer zoomed past us missed us by
[59:25] about that much
[59:28] I don't know where the guy came from I
[59:29] don't know where he went because we
[59:31] didn't see him we saw him when he was
[59:32] right beside me like that I don't know
[59:34] how he got through that situation but he
[59:37] did
[59:38] um
[59:39] so as we left that scene that's what
[59:41] happened and and
[59:44] just to
[59:46] to show you the next day I just wanted
[59:49] to
[59:50] show you what a um
[59:55] that the warning came out I read this
[59:57] the next day a little bit too late but
[1:00:00] it said there's going to be a crippling
[1:00:01] blizzard conditions we'll be continuing
[1:00:04] this until this evening travel will be
[1:00:06] extremely difficult and impossible at
[1:00:08] times
[1:00:10] impossible
[1:00:12] and is not advised this includes Highway
[1:00:14] 401 near Kingston to Cornwall
[1:00:17] it's exactly where we were blizzard
[1:00:19] conditions with wind gusts of 80 to 100
[1:00:20] kilometers an hour in snowfall amounts
[1:00:23] of 20 to 30 centimeters and all this and
[1:00:26] here we were worried about I didn't
[1:00:27] realize that this storm had had stopped
[1:00:30] over Kingston and it was just battering
[1:00:33] it all between between and here we were
[1:00:35] in the middle of it
[1:00:38] um
[1:00:40] we are approaching Kingston and the
[1:00:42] lanes went from two to three lanes
[1:00:44] that's what happened they give an extra
[1:00:45] Lane there because of it's a busy place
[1:00:48] and uh everybody was had gotten off the
[1:00:51] highway
[1:00:52] except us we were the only car for half
[1:00:55] an hour I did not see another vehicle on
[1:00:57] the 401 if you can believe that
[1:01:00] um for me I was a little bit of a boon
[1:01:02] because I had three lanes I had no other
[1:01:04] cars I said okay I'm going to pick it up
[1:01:05] a little bit
[1:01:08] and we did
[1:01:09] and Michelle said to me at that point
[1:01:11] she says hey Dad you want to listen to
[1:01:12] some music
[1:01:14] yeah
[1:01:16] and she put on a a song service from a
[1:01:20] church down in Phoenix
[1:01:23] and uh from one of their services and
[1:01:26] and the first song was something keeps
[1:01:27] holding me
[1:01:29] and as I began to play the Lord the Lord
[1:01:32] just came and started dealing with my
[1:01:34] heart and made it all soft and
[1:01:36] everything like that and I I was sitting
[1:01:37] there wiping tears away something keeps
[1:01:39] holding me here we are in the middle of
[1:01:41] a crazy storm and wind gusts and
[1:01:44] everything
[1:01:45] and then they went through the song
[1:01:47] service
[1:01:49] and
[1:01:50] then the pastor came out and he wasn't
[1:01:54] preaching that day but he came to
[1:01:55] introduce the guy who was the brother
[1:01:57] who was preaching who I happen to know
[1:01:59] and hadn't heard of in two three years
[1:02:01] and uh he's from Ireland and I I stayed
[1:02:05] with his parents in Ireland anyway I was
[1:02:06] amazed that he that he was preaching but
[1:02:08] anyway
[1:02:09] um the pastor come out and he said this
[1:02:12] he made a few comments and then he said
[1:02:15] uh
[1:02:17] foreign
[1:02:22] let's sing a
[1:02:23] a song that I love so much
[1:02:26] I know the master of the Wind
[1:02:30] because he says I'm quoting him okay
[1:02:33] because I realize there are times when
[1:02:36] storms and tempests are going to come
[1:02:39] your way not everything is going to be
[1:02:42] easy sailing you're going to go through
[1:02:45] some good times and bad times but Jesus
[1:02:47] said lo I will be with you always
[1:02:50] and then they said I know the master of
[1:02:52] the wind I know the maker of the rain he
[1:02:55] can calm a storm
[1:02:57] and make the Sun
[1:02:58] shine again and I looked at Michelle and
[1:03:01] she looked at me and we smiled and it
[1:03:04] was like we were in a bubble everything
[1:03:06] going crazy outside and we were there we
[1:03:08] were just
[1:03:09] presence of God just beautiful and
[1:03:12] Madeline was in the back sleeping
[1:03:17] rest little bride rest for all is well
[1:03:21] so you know you begin to notice these
[1:03:23] things you say what is going on here
[1:03:26] and that word was so perfectly uh in
[1:03:29] season for us in our spirit's sword when
[1:03:32] we heard that and say those words and
[1:03:34] they started singing Master of the wind
[1:03:36] and it seemed like we were
[1:03:38] it was just it was beautiful
[1:03:40] in the middle of that storm
[1:03:43] but anyway we pressed on and and uh
[1:03:46] we were
[1:03:49] going for a town called Brockville
[1:03:51] Brockville is about three quarters of
[1:03:52] the way to Montreal going 20 kilometers
[1:03:55] an hour 30 kilometers an hour and we we
[1:03:58] uh we we got off in in Brockville and
[1:04:01] then that's when I realized how what
[1:04:03] they meant by
[1:04:05] so uh when we got off of that off off
[1:04:09] ramp
[1:04:10] they had closed all the on-ramps so we
[1:04:13] could not get back on the 401.
[1:04:16] so
[1:04:17] now I understand the sign sometimes you
[1:04:20] can't interpret a sign until you
[1:04:21] actually experience it
[1:04:23] and we got off there we said well the
[1:04:25] only other way to go is along Highway
[1:04:27] too is Highway 2 is the little highways
[1:04:29] it's it runs right along the St Lawrence
[1:04:32] River
[1:04:33] um you do not want to be in a blizzard
[1:04:36] driving along the St Lawrence River
[1:04:39] right because the wind's coming off
[1:04:41] there it was so bad you would drive and
[1:04:45] have to actually stop because of the it
[1:04:48] would be a whiteout condition you got to
[1:04:50] stop wait till it dies down and start
[1:04:52] driving again because you couldn't see
[1:04:54] from here to the microphone
[1:04:56] and uh and that's what we were in I said
[1:04:58] we're going along Highway 2.
[1:05:00] and through Highway 2 there was a lot of
[1:05:03] small towns
[1:05:05] this is Christmas eve two o'clock in the
[1:05:07] afternoon downtown
[1:05:10] small town
[1:05:12] and every store was closed they had
[1:05:14] locked up it looked like it was
[1:05:16] the apocalypse it looked like it was all
[1:05:18] everything was finished
[1:05:20] the busiest day of the year for stores
[1:05:22] I'm sure
[1:05:24] um
[1:05:25] we found a
[1:05:27] Tim Hortons and and that was closing and
[1:05:31] we managed to get a muffin off of them
[1:05:33] they had everything packed away he
[1:05:34] managed to get out before they they shut
[1:05:36] down went on our way again
[1:05:38] and um
[1:05:40] before everywhere we went with the 401
[1:05:42] was closed closed closed closed
[1:05:45] till finally we
[1:05:47] we as I was driving I saw an opp officer
[1:05:50] sitting on the side of the road I pulled
[1:05:51] up beside I said listen I said we got to
[1:05:53] get back on the 401 because you know
[1:05:55] this is we got to make Quebec and he's
[1:05:57] if she said uh
[1:06:00] she said I said is the 401 open she says
[1:06:03] I don't know it's conflicting
[1:06:07] reports
[1:06:09] here's the authority that she didn't
[1:06:11] even know whether the highway was open
[1:06:13] or not
[1:06:14] and I know we get a lot of conflicting
[1:06:16] things about is the word open or not
[1:06:18] it's open
[1:06:21] um but she said maybe you just better
[1:06:24] stick on Highway 2 until you get to
[1:06:25] lanecaster maybe that'll be safer I said
[1:06:29] okay
[1:06:30] so we left there
[1:06:32] and Lancaster was like 50 kilometers
[1:06:34] away
[1:06:36] he was now approaching four o'clock and
[1:06:38] I said oh my goodness if it starts
[1:06:40] getting dark in this thing we are it's
[1:06:42] going to compound the problems right
[1:06:44] so it's four o'clock and we're driving
[1:06:46] slowly down Highway 2 which is called
[1:06:48] the King's Highway
[1:06:50] and
[1:06:52] something just said
[1:06:54] look up
[1:06:57] and if I looked
[1:06:59] before me it was nothing but gray and
[1:07:02] stormy if I looked my rear view is gray
[1:07:04] and stormy left and right gray and
[1:07:05] stormy but said look up no in order for
[1:07:07] me to look up I I had to go like this
[1:07:10] and look up
[1:07:11] because the the roof came over like that
[1:07:13] and when I did
[1:07:16] I thought I saw blue sky
[1:07:19] I sat back I looked again
[1:07:23] I said Michelle
[1:07:25] look up and she looked down she was Dad
[1:07:27] that's blue sky up there
[1:07:30] and sure enough
[1:07:32] at four o'clock in the afternoon in the
[1:07:34] midst of the storm everywhere there was
[1:07:36] a patch of blue sky that was right above
[1:07:38] us
[1:07:39] and the Sun was shining
[1:07:41] and a plane was flying through it you
[1:07:44] could see the sun glistening up she said
[1:07:46] Madeleine wake up look up there that's
[1:07:50] what that spoke from the very beginning
[1:07:52] his blue sky and sunshine
[1:07:55] and that
[1:07:56] patch of Blue Sky never went before us
[1:07:59] it never went after us it never went to
[1:08:01] the left or the right it just stayed
[1:08:02] there the whole time
[1:08:05] until 4 30. for half an hour
[1:08:09] or about the space of half an hour
[1:08:11] and I said Lord what can I say
[1:08:14] you are you're you are wonderful
[1:08:17] and we ended up getting to Lancaster
[1:08:21] safely by the grace of God
[1:08:24] went on to Quebec when we walked into
[1:08:26] his brother's uh her brother's uh home
[1:08:29] we knocked on the door and and they
[1:08:32] opened the door and spontaneously they
[1:08:35] told me afterwards they all started
[1:08:36] clapping
[1:08:38] and because they were really concerned
[1:08:40] and they all started clapping and gave
[1:08:42] us a hero's welcome and they welcomed us
[1:08:44] then a few minutes later brother Desmond
[1:08:46] I was sitting at a table with a
[1:08:48] Christmas dinner sitting in front of me
[1:08:51] and I sat there and I said oh God it's
[1:08:54] from beginning to end it's an oncoming
[1:08:56] storm but one day we're going to sit at
[1:08:58] a table and we're going to eat a fruit
[1:09:00] praise God
[1:09:03] but the main thing is I hope you're
[1:09:04] hearing those voices keep pressing on
[1:09:08] praise God and this is the hour where
[1:09:11] the spoken word
[1:09:12] is with us
[1:09:14] let God interpret that that one for you
[1:09:16] God bless you that's my testimony amen
[1:09:20] I know the master of the
[1:09:25] start for a minute
[1:09:27] I know
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:38] the sun shine again
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:14] foreign
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:25] so every year there's I was told this is
[1:10:28] my first New Year's service
[1:10:30] and every year I was told that there is
[1:10:33] a testimony of
[1:10:36] someone coming to the Lord and um
[1:10:39] today is my turn
[1:10:41] to sort of give my testimony but my
[1:10:43] testimony will be a little bit different
[1:10:44] because
[1:10:45] it is I was at the age of five my
[1:10:49] parents came to the Lord but then I
[1:10:51] didn't really have an understanding of
[1:10:54] who this God really was so I had
[1:10:57] paxland and came back to the Lord so
[1:11:00] bear with me as I go through my little
[1:11:02] testimony here
[1:11:04] so I was born in Trinidad and Tobago to
[1:11:06] two parents
[1:11:09] um Betty and Anthony John
[1:11:11] around 1975 they accepted the message of
[1:11:17] the hour um
[1:11:19] message and they came to the Lord
[1:11:24] um around that time 1975 1976 I was a
[1:11:28] young young man then but I remembered
[1:11:31] there was so much talk of
[1:11:34] um
[1:11:35] brother but Abraham had predicted but
[1:11:38] they were saying that Jesus was coming
[1:11:40] in 1977.
[1:11:42] so around that time there was so much
[1:11:47] um okay we got to take the kids out of
[1:11:49] school we don't need school we don't
[1:11:52] need work we don't need jobs we we we
[1:11:55] gotta that's homeschool them and
[1:11:58] whatever to you know to keep them away
[1:12:00] from this world
[1:12:01] and and with that
[1:12:04] Looking Back Now there was a lot of
[1:12:06] legalism you know going on
[1:12:09] where people were kind of you know like
[1:12:11] we basically
[1:12:13] um they put us in a in the back of the
[1:12:15] church and we just read the Bible to us
[1:12:18] all day we didn't need school right
[1:12:19] there's no need for school there's no
[1:12:21] need for education
[1:12:24] um
[1:12:25] you know a lot of weapon a lot of
[1:12:28] beating
[1:12:29] um spirited right to spoiler child right
[1:12:32] so
[1:12:33] it was a time where you were kind of
[1:12:37] like okay
[1:12:38] um what is really happening
[1:12:41] um around in the early 80s now my
[1:12:44] parents now was
[1:12:47] they were hearing about brother Coleman
[1:12:49] and you know the seven Thunders so they
[1:12:53] decided okay well where they were
[1:12:54] fellowship and at the time it wasn't a
[1:12:57] place where they felt that it wasn't
[1:12:58] getting a full understanding of the word
[1:13:01] so they they decided to move on to
[1:13:03] another church
[1:13:05] I wouldn't name any any any anybody I'll
[1:13:08] just kind of say that and um
[1:13:11] so growing up we were encouraged to read
[1:13:14] the Bible
[1:13:15] we were encouraged to you know to pray
[1:13:18] and with that there was definitely a
[1:13:23] love for God growing in our hearts as
[1:13:26] young as young men and young my young
[1:13:29] sisters
[1:13:30] um
[1:13:32] my father didn't just talk about the
[1:13:35] Lord he lived a life and I say that
[1:13:38] because
[1:13:39] um I I remembered
[1:13:42] there were times when I was a young
[1:13:44] person and I reflected on this last and
[1:13:47] as you know you realize how they
[1:13:48] sacrifice you were making as a young
[1:13:50] person but at the time I didn't
[1:13:52] understand it so where we were going to
[1:13:55] church we were going to church like in
[1:13:58] close to like a place called Barataria
[1:14:00] and but of course you know where Toco is
[1:14:03] so Toko is probably three hours away
[1:14:05] from there service will be done at 10 30
[1:14:09] and my father in a station wagon with
[1:14:11] about seven kids
[1:14:13] um pack us all up like sardine in the
[1:14:16] back and then we will have to drop three
[1:14:19] or four people in Toco
[1:14:22] so by the time we go to drop them in
[1:14:24] Toko
[1:14:26] um I'm probably coming back home
[1:14:29] probably four in the morning
[1:14:31] you know you have to go have to go to
[1:14:33] school my father had to get to work but
[1:14:35] it wasn't something that he was like you
[1:14:37] know what these Saints needs are left he
[1:14:39] needs to do it so he's he's taking them
[1:14:43] so but not only growing up around that I
[1:14:47] grew up around the supernatural a lot
[1:14:48] and I say that because
[1:14:50] I didn't realize until a later in my
[1:14:53] life
[1:14:54] what the environment was
[1:14:56] for instance you know my father was
[1:15:00] considered a man of faith and everybody
[1:15:03] would know who's and he said you say
[1:15:04] brother Johnny Brother John man with
[1:15:06] feet and there was so much experience
[1:15:08] was happening that led to that sort of a
[1:15:12] label on him
[1:15:13] um one of them I remembered as a young
[1:15:16] child we were coming from service one
[1:15:18] night
[1:15:19] from church one night and
[1:15:22] there was a an accident a car came in
[1:15:26] our lane hit our car
[1:15:28] and my mom pitched out of the window
[1:15:32] um the door it always closed I don't
[1:15:34] know how she got out there my little
[1:15:35] brother was in her in her arms
[1:15:38] um my father driving my brother a big
[1:15:41] cut along his eyes for me I just blacked
[1:15:45] out just saw stars but my father's feet
[1:15:48] was pinned between the clutch and the
[1:15:51] accelerator and both feet broke just
[1:15:56] broke up
[1:15:57] because it was after the car was written
[1:15:59] off you you there was amazing to see how
[1:16:02] we lived through that because it was
[1:16:04] just the car was just demolished
[1:16:08] So Gone to the hospital my father my mom
[1:16:10] is in hospital my dad's in hospital and
[1:16:14] the doctor says tell them listen Mr John
[1:16:16] we have to try to put a pin in your feet
[1:16:20] because if we don't you're never going
[1:16:22] to walk again
[1:16:23] and this man being a fate said to doctor
[1:16:28] doc there's nothing going into my feet
[1:16:30] God is going to heal my foot
[1:16:32] and
[1:16:35] well anyway we a couple days we were
[1:16:37] supposed to see a specialist he was
[1:16:39] supposed to see a specialist this doctor
[1:16:41] was supposed to come in and say you know
[1:16:43] um okay how are we going to do this
[1:16:45] surgery
[1:16:46] on the night before this doctor was
[1:16:49] supposed to come my father tell us a
[1:16:51] story that he prayed he asked God he
[1:16:52] said Lord
[1:16:53] before the doctor lays hands on my foot
[1:16:56] I want your hand
[1:16:58] to touch my foot and heal my foot
[1:17:02] so the day come and the doctor is doing
[1:17:06] the the extra on his feet
[1:17:09] and my father said he stops and he says
[1:17:12] Mr John why did you put your hand there
[1:17:14] he says I never put my hand here but no
[1:17:16] let me back up a little bit the night
[1:17:18] prior to that my father is there and he
[1:17:21] says about midnight he feels like
[1:17:23] somebody's massaging his foot so he's he
[1:17:25] turns to the guy about
[1:17:27] in in the hallways did you touch my
[1:17:29] funny guys no I'm I can't touch you for
[1:17:31] that I can't get up and he is on his bed
[1:17:33] I can't touch your foot so he felt this
[1:17:35] hand touching his foot
[1:17:37] and
[1:17:39] lo and behold the morning when they did
[1:17:42] this x-ray they see our hand with flesh
[1:17:46] on his feet and they're amazed because
[1:17:49] there's no broken bones
[1:17:51] my father foot is completely healed
[1:17:54] right
[1:17:56] so I I I I still tell my brother I said
[1:17:58] what did we do with that extra because
[1:18:00] it was all over Trend that everybody saw
[1:18:02] this physical hand with with flesh on it
[1:18:05] when you take an extra it gets you get
[1:18:07] bone this is flesh on my father's hand
[1:18:10] not a broken bone in my father's foot
[1:18:12] the doctors in them they don't know
[1:18:14] they're just looking around it's like
[1:18:15] you don't know what happened here
[1:18:18] so as stuff like that was happening and
[1:18:20] you know you're being around the
[1:18:21] supernatural I remember another time
[1:18:23] when my mom having my my sister
[1:18:26] um she had something called uh placenta
[1:18:29] previa where the placenta is blocking
[1:18:32] where the uterus something new uterus
[1:18:34] and is blocking where the baby is
[1:18:35] supposed to come out and full some
[1:18:37] people are partial she was full and um
[1:18:40] the doctor said listen we gotta cut her
[1:18:42] open and my father there I go again he
[1:18:43] says God is going to heal us
[1:18:47] and lo behold the day before this they
[1:18:50] were supposed to cut her open they said
[1:18:53] it's gone so you see a lot of these
[1:18:55] things I was growing up around so I was
[1:18:57] seeing the supernatural but taken not
[1:19:00] taking heed of what was happening but I
[1:19:02] understood I always had the desire to
[1:19:04] love the Lord but it was just
[1:19:06] that thing where you have that will push
[1:19:08] you say okay this is
[1:19:11] your experience you're seeing these
[1:19:13] things and put it into together to where
[1:19:15] you can have a relationship with the
[1:19:16] Lord
[1:19:18] um
[1:19:20] around 18 years old I moved to in my
[1:19:23] grandparents and it was partly to help
[1:19:25] because my father had gotten really sick
[1:19:27] diabetic and I decided to work after
[1:19:31] school to try to help the family just to
[1:19:34] you know put make ends meet and stuff
[1:19:36] like that
[1:19:37] and around that time a lot of the kids
[1:19:41] around the church now started exiting
[1:19:44] because you know over the years a lot of
[1:19:47] the legalism a lot of the people would
[1:19:49] see on the streets and they'll condemn
[1:19:51] you and it was always a battle with the
[1:19:54] brothers and so I said you know one of
[1:19:55] the things okay I need to get out of
[1:19:58] here
[1:19:59] so
[1:20:01] started making my plans to move to
[1:20:04] Canada
[1:20:05] finally in 1990 I moved to Canada
[1:20:10] and um say Lord I I'm like I'm getting
[1:20:13] away from these church people I love the
[1:20:15] Lord but it's just the just the whole
[1:20:17] thing around it was just so much a
[1:20:19] battle
[1:20:22] I came to Canada and my first job the
[1:20:25] real job I got was in 1992.
[1:20:29] um God placed me
[1:20:31] 600 6
[1:20:33] 360 kilometers away
[1:20:36] from Trinidad in a company called
[1:20:38] Campbell Soup where three Believers is
[1:20:40] is working there what's your chances of
[1:20:42] that happening
[1:20:44] three Believers with a mic
[1:20:47] brother Paul and brother Mark
[1:20:50] I can't run
[1:20:51] [Laughter]
[1:20:54] so I remember the scene but I'm like I
[1:20:56] don't know what year it was I was
[1:20:58] working 92 but I remember seeing a bit
[1:20:59] of Mike and
[1:21:01] reading a spoken word book I said hey
[1:21:02] you better break you believe but Brian
[1:21:05] was a prophet and he goes yeah you got
[1:21:08] it all excited like you said somebody
[1:21:10] you want to start appreciate the word
[1:21:11] too
[1:21:12] and I said to him yes I do and I walked
[1:21:15] away and I said I gotta stay away from
[1:21:16] that man
[1:21:18] foreign
[1:21:19] because one of the things that I I I
[1:21:22] knew
[1:21:24] is that um
[1:21:27] the word was true the message was real
[1:21:32] and I didn't want him to tell me about
[1:21:35] The Mercy Seat the mercies is done the
[1:21:39] doors are closed I didn't want to hear
[1:21:40] that I have to have fun
[1:21:44] so I stayed away from brother Mike
[1:21:49] but in 2002
[1:21:51] um my father-in-law got stricken with
[1:21:53] cancer
[1:21:54] um prostate cancer
[1:21:56] and took him to some chemotherapy and
[1:22:00] different things and for a little while
[1:22:01] he started to feel a lot better but
[1:22:03] around 2007 it just came back with a
[1:22:07] vengeance
[1:22:08] and he saw a deteriorating by 2008 2007
[1:22:13] he was
[1:22:14] you know we knew that if the Lord didn't
[1:22:16] intercede
[1:22:18] around that time I started really
[1:22:21] talking to the Lord
[1:22:23] and quite quietly I would listen to
[1:22:27] messages and
[1:22:30] you know the Lord said kind of dealing
[1:22:32] with me because I was back and forth in
[1:22:34] the hospital with him I kind of wanted
[1:22:36] to do that because I felt like you know
[1:22:40] it was my way because I looking I'm
[1:22:42] looking at him and I you know wanted to
[1:22:44] pray for him but the devil said you
[1:22:46] can't pray for me look at your life
[1:22:48] you know look look look look look how
[1:22:49] you're living you know the truth he's
[1:22:51] gonna go to hell if he doesn't know God
[1:22:53] and all of these things is going through
[1:22:55] my head and I'm thinking Lord you know
[1:22:57] how can I help this man
[1:23:00] foreign
[1:23:04] late I think early 2008 I invited
[1:23:07] brother Mike
[1:23:09] to come over to the house
[1:23:10] where he was
[1:23:13] um you know whatever got laid on his
[1:23:14] hand to pray for him whatever
[1:23:17] um he brought along with a Chris and
[1:23:19] sister Shirley
[1:23:21] and sincerely stood up there and she
[1:23:23] gave her testimony and
[1:23:26] I tell you her testimony was just
[1:23:29] so moving you know she talked about her
[1:23:33] conversion from Muslim to Christianity
[1:23:35] and in the home
[1:23:38] it was everybody was in tears you know
[1:23:42] but a Michael but a Christian and they
[1:23:43] prayed for him
[1:23:45] but there was a piece that came over the
[1:23:47] home
[1:23:48] from that day on you know everybody it
[1:23:51] just seems like something took place it
[1:23:55] was like just a atmosphere there's
[1:23:58] change in the home because before it was
[1:23:59] just okay you know it's almost waiting
[1:24:02] you know for his his time
[1:24:10] you know watching my father-in-law go
[1:24:12] through all that stuff
[1:24:14] um it just drove me to pray pray more
[1:24:16] and and you know to see God's
[1:24:18] see God's face
[1:24:21] it's February 20 2008
[1:24:24] um
[1:24:26] my uncle who was a very healthy man you
[1:24:30] know I was in communication with him
[1:24:31] like two days ago he was planning on
[1:24:34] coming to Canada to visit
[1:24:37] um he passed away that's February 2008.
[1:24:40] how to talk
[1:24:41] then in March
[1:24:43] my mom
[1:24:45] died
[1:24:47] April 2nd of the same year so in
[1:24:50] February March April second my daughter
[1:24:52] was born Janae and then on April 20th my
[1:24:57] father passed away so you see like in
[1:24:59] three months I lost three people
[1:25:02] and it was it was a very difficult thing
[1:25:04] because I think the one other thing is
[1:25:05] is greatest one is my father-in-law
[1:25:07] watching him deteriorate and have you
[1:25:09] ever see somebody you know go through
[1:25:11] that and as you see that and you're
[1:25:13] Desiring to help and there's more like
[1:25:15] the spiritual side here and in my soul
[1:25:17] to help him and I felt I was you know I
[1:25:20] wasn't able to help him
[1:25:23] um
[1:25:24] all that time you know
[1:25:28] I had I suffered a mental breakdown
[1:25:31] it was just too much I felt like this
[1:25:34] Darkness everywhere it was sadness and
[1:25:38] everywhere I turn like there's light
[1:25:40] here but
[1:25:41] it actually felt dark in my in my in my
[1:25:44] head
[1:25:45] and I believe that Lord passed me
[1:25:47] through that so I can I could have
[1:25:48] compassion for people who have gone
[1:25:49] through that before
[1:25:51] right
[1:25:53] um well
[1:25:55] that Sunday morning when my mom passed I
[1:25:58] got myself together and the church
[1:25:59] wasn't Walker's line
[1:26:01] and um came to church this Sunday that
[1:26:05] morning I came in late but Tim was
[1:26:07] praying
[1:26:09] and
[1:26:12] he
[1:26:14] he was saying in his prayer he says um
[1:26:18] he says God
[1:26:20] um
[1:26:21] this morning would you heal anybody
[1:26:24] suffering with mental illness this is
[1:26:26] the words I heard coming out of his
[1:26:27] mouth
[1:26:28] and at that time I just felt like you
[1:26:31] know what is this is my time
[1:26:33] so I asked God right in my chair I said
[1:26:35] Lord if you would heal me of this thing
[1:26:39] that I'm going through
[1:26:40] I would serve you
[1:26:43] I would
[1:26:45] doesn't matter what it took because I
[1:26:47] always wanted to come but I always
[1:26:49] thought about the friends I was going to
[1:26:51] lose
[1:26:52] um what is my wife gonna say
[1:26:55] um
[1:26:56] you know what am I gonna do you know it
[1:26:59] felt like all of these things was just
[1:27:02] stopping me from succeeding because I
[1:27:04] was putting all of these things before
[1:27:05] the Lord
[1:27:07] but
[1:27:08] that place I was in that dark place I
[1:27:11] didn't want to stay there it was hell
[1:27:14] so I a lot and so that that morning when
[1:27:16] I came and I asked her that
[1:27:19] I literally felt like somebody took a
[1:27:23] vacuum
[1:27:24] and just grabbed my head and just like
[1:27:28] was sucking all the darkness out of my
[1:27:30] head right in my seat right
[1:27:33] so all of a sudden I felt like I can see
[1:27:36] again you know there was light so I got
[1:27:39] all excited and I went home and I said
[1:27:41] to my wife I said hey honey you know I
[1:27:44] went to the church today and
[1:27:47] I got healed I told him my experience
[1:27:50] and you know what happened and it's all
[1:27:52] gone and and she looked at me and she
[1:27:54] says I hope you're gonna still go and
[1:27:56] see the psychiatrist
[1:27:58] because I had made an appointment to see
[1:28:01] his psychiatrist
[1:28:04] my wife is a psychologist so she knows
[1:28:07] all about mental illness so she's like I
[1:28:10] think he's going a little further now
[1:28:11] right
[1:28:15] so you know
[1:28:18] um
[1:28:19] I still I went to see him actually and
[1:28:22] um I sat in his chair and he took grab
[1:28:25] his pen he starts asking me about my
[1:28:27] life and you know I've abused and all
[1:28:30] this stuff and but I all I wanted to do
[1:28:33] is tell him how much I got healed
[1:28:35] and um in the end he just put his pen
[1:28:39] down and he said listen
[1:28:40] I've heard these stories before and I've
[1:28:42] seen this happen before but keep your
[1:28:43] file open if you want to come back and
[1:28:46] see me but he didn't have time for me
[1:28:47] because I kept talking about how much
[1:28:48] God healed me so he didn't want to hear
[1:28:51] too much about that
[1:28:53] everything
[1:28:54] [Applause]
[1:28:58] I so that's in a nutshell really is my
[1:29:02] testimony it's
[1:29:04] the struggles of
[1:29:07] not wanting to surrender
[1:29:10] and God knows that in my heart I always
[1:29:13] had a desire I loved the Lord but it was
[1:29:16] that point where
[1:29:18] he had to
[1:29:20] bring a a little bit of Rumble in my
[1:29:23] life to sort of bring me to that place
[1:29:26] where I cannot worry about all of these
[1:29:30] extra external things that I was so
[1:29:33] scared about the family what's this one
[1:29:35] going to say what's that gonna say
[1:29:37] because I knew to walk with God is a
[1:29:40] total different walk of just just
[1:29:43] joining Church
[1:29:44] you know it's a total separation I knew
[1:29:46] that and but when
[1:29:49] the Lord takes over and he comes and he
[1:29:53] deals with you
[1:29:54] I didn't care who left or who did what I
[1:29:57] just wanted to serve the Lord
[1:30:00] and
[1:30:02] my scripture I read Hebrews 20 10 20 and
[1:30:05] she says Let Us whole unswovenly to the
[1:30:08] hope we profess
[1:30:09] for he whose promise is faithful
[1:30:12] and I was telling him with Aquaria about
[1:30:14] you know I heard somebody describe this
[1:30:16] as you know you haven't played that game
[1:30:18] where you hold your friend Han and you
[1:30:21] swing around what are you guys you swing
[1:30:23] around like you're holding but you
[1:30:25] depend on that person to hold you
[1:30:27] because if they're not holding you you
[1:30:29] fall down
[1:30:31] that is how God is holding us
[1:30:33] you know he we he we can let go but he
[1:30:36] is still holding us right and I I thank
[1:30:39] God because
[1:30:40] if I didn't have a grounded fate for the
[1:30:43] things I went through and I I I don't
[1:30:45] talk about it and I can't talk but you
[1:30:47] can't tell because it's your trials and
[1:30:48] your intestines but if I didn't have
[1:30:50] something to hold me
[1:30:52] as brother Mike said something keeps
[1:30:54] holding me
[1:30:55] and I'm I'm grateful for the Lord you
[1:30:59] know up to my life you have to watch
[1:31:01] your life closely and as you go back and
[1:31:03] you look at the experience you realize
[1:31:05] the Lord was always there even you know
[1:31:08] times when I was partying coming from
[1:31:11] drunk in the highway driving home and
[1:31:15] you hear the voice of God's son
[1:31:18] this is not what I want for you you know
[1:31:20] I was about to hit somebody Dead on
[1:31:22] and I knew him with myself I had no
[1:31:25] strength in my feet to take my feet off
[1:31:27] the accelerator and to see
[1:31:31] just as the nick of time just as and I
[1:31:34] said okay this is it I'm done
[1:31:36] I'm done and then all of a sudden
[1:31:38] there's strength come in your feet and
[1:31:40] you your hand you feel your car is
[1:31:44] moving and it's God God took care of you
[1:31:47] you go back and you realize all those
[1:31:49] times he was there even when I was
[1:31:51] clubbing and partying and doing what he
[1:31:54] never let me go
[1:31:56] so I just want to give him thanks
[1:31:58] tonight I want to give him praise for
[1:32:00] his love and kindness his goodness
[1:32:02] throughout my whole life you have kept
[1:32:04] me and today

[1:32:19] family and that's why over the years

[1:39:39] King Herod who knew nothing about the
[1:39:42] Stars the wise men knew nothing about
[1:39:44] the bright shining star they knew
[1:39:47] nothing about this great Mystic light
[1:39:49] but the wise man came to have their
[1:39:53] interview with him
[1:39:55] and being crafty and cunning having no
[1:39:58] Revelation he tells them after you got
[1:40:02] it come back and let me know how I can
[1:40:06] get it uh let me know where to go and
[1:40:10] worship him

[1:41:42] living in darkness all around but by
[1:41:47] your
[1:41:48] predestinated will
[1:41:51] we have come to see a Mystic light
[1:41:56] we have caught the revelation
[1:41:59] of this last star this prophet's message
[1:42:03] of this hour
[1:42:06] we feel the vibrations of the Redeeming

[1:43:05] I want you to understand
[1:43:08] that these wise men even started on
[1:43:13] their Journey
[1:43:15] because they saw this bright shining
[1:43:18] star
[1:43:20] they saw this Mystic light
[1:43:23] and that caught their attention
[1:43:27] and caused them to turn away from
[1:43:32] whatever life
[1:43:34] that were living before
[1:43:36] whether there were intellectual men
[1:43:39] smart men wise man whatever they were
[1:43:43] doing that turned away from their former
[1:43:47] ways of living
[1:43:50] to follow this star that they saw in the
[1:43:55] sky
[1:43:56] I'm
[1:43:58] putting it to you tonight
[1:44:01] that if in your heart you know you have
[1:44:05] caught the revelation
[1:44:07] you have seen the light of God shining
[1:44:11] upon your life for this hour
[1:44:15] I pray that like them we will all turn
[1:44:19] aside and ask God to take us to the
[1:44:24] fullness of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:27] amen so that turned aside
[1:44:31] and it turned away from what
[1:44:34] that turned away when they went to Herod
[1:44:38] we will not talk about the period
[1:44:42] between when they started to when they
[1:44:45] arrived but now their herod's palace
[1:44:50] they have had the interview with him
[1:44:54] they have told him that
[1:44:58] it's not just a message not just a star
[1:45:01] like that but we receive the revelation
[1:45:06] we came to understand that the scripture
[1:45:09] said that uh when the star of Jesse when
[1:45:15] you see the star we recognize that the
[1:45:19] king is on earth now
[1:45:22] the king is here and because we
[1:45:25] recognize that we want to go to him
[1:45:29] wherever he is we are wanting to go to
[1:45:33] him well I want to say by the grace of
[1:45:36] God I believe that I caught that Shining
[1:45:41] Light coming off of the word of God
[1:45:45] I've caught the light because God sent
[1:45:49] the Western Star
[1:45:51] to light up their spiritual universe
[1:45:55] that men and women who are wise could
[1:45:58] recognize this is not just an ordinary
[1:46:01] uh evangelist this is not just an
[1:46:05] ordinary teacher this is not just a
[1:46:09] religious man this is not someone trying
[1:46:12] to come with some religious scheme but
[1:46:16] our eyes have seen the glory of God
[1:46:19] manifestable life of our brother William
[1:46:22] Mary and Branham without a doubt we know
[1:46:26] that he is the seven messenger set by
[1:46:30] God from Heaven amen and it's striking
[1:46:33] me more and more as I walk with God and
[1:46:36] get closer to him amen praise God so
[1:46:40] they came to Herod amen and after they
[1:46:46] left heron
[1:46:47] seen the world may manifest to them
[1:46:52] and surrendered the gifts that they had
[1:46:57] to the word of God for that hour like
[1:47:01] you and me coming with the gene that was
[1:47:04] in us the seed of God which was given to
[1:47:08] us by grace of God
[1:47:11] predestinated in us not by our will but
[1:47:15] by his grace amen not by our wisdom our
[1:47:20] smartness but by his grace that we are
[1:47:23] saved here tonight amen glory to God I'm
[1:47:27] so thankful
[1:47:28] but my eyes have been opened I'm so
[1:47:32] thankful that our hearts have been
[1:47:35] opened to the fullness of the word of
[1:47:38] God
[1:47:38] now they come they had their interview
[1:47:42] they're going away Herod tells them come
[1:47:46] back and let me know where you found him
[1:47:49] oh my well thank God we have a third
[1:47:53] pole Revelation
[1:47:55] and refunds all you know and even though
[1:47:59] you have caught it you there is there is
[1:48:02] not set up in such a way that you can
[1:48:05] convey it to somebody else
[1:48:08] each one has to come individually
[1:48:12] each one has to recognize and that is
[1:48:16] the very Grace and choice of God being
[1:48:19] made manifest who is his and who is not
[1:48:22] his or who is a half but I've beg
[1:48:25] believer and who is a make-believer who
[1:48:29] is a True Believer God is doing all of
[1:48:32] that right now by his grace amen so
[1:48:36] after their great interview
[1:48:39] they went to uh where Jesus was
[1:48:44] they presented their gifts don't you
[1:48:47] want to do that that's not don't I want
[1:48:50] to do that since I've caught the
[1:48:52] fullness of this I want the life the
[1:48:56] gene the gift that is in me I place it
[1:48:59] in his hands for him to use it however
[1:49:02] he Wills
[1:49:04] amen I am no more my own
[1:49:07] I don't have my own thinking
[1:49:10] I don't have my own way I don't care
[1:49:14] about a parent's strange to anybody
[1:49:17] anywhere or even till you wore right in
[1:49:19] front of me amen I Just Surrender
[1:49:23] whatever this gift of life
[1:49:26] there is place within this life that he
[1:49:29] might glorify himself through it amen
[1:49:33] and break the chains of Satan wherever
[1:49:36] it may be found amen glory to God so
[1:49:39] after they have seen the word
[1:49:43] I know they are returning back to where
[1:49:48] they come from
[1:49:49] like us I believe after we have seen the
[1:49:52] word what are we here doing we are on
[1:49:57] our returning Journey going back from
[1:50:00] whence we came and we know we came from
[1:50:03] God we're going back to God Amen
[1:50:06] Hallelujah but going back to God is not
[1:50:11] just normal
[1:50:13] four
[1:50:15] they they expected and I'm sure Herod
[1:50:19] must have had his spies
[1:50:21] on the roadways
[1:50:23] on the various places going out to
[1:50:26] Jerusalem
[1:50:27] that he might know where they were going
[1:50:32] but these men were warned of God in a
[1:50:36] dream
[1:50:37] amen praise God and God warned them not
[1:50:43] to walk the way of the world
[1:50:45] don't go by the systems of the world
[1:50:50] don't go but the accepted way of the
[1:50:54] world
[1:50:55] don't go by the expected way of thinking
[1:50:59] of the world but go according to this
[1:51:02] word that God has given to us in this
[1:51:05] day and in this hour praise the name of
[1:51:08] the Lord Jesus Christ so they return
[1:51:11] once they came not by the acceptable
[1:51:15] acceptable ways of man not by the
[1:51:18] expected ways of man but by the word of
[1:51:22] God
[1:51:24] Hallelujah but thank God
[1:51:27] God always has a witness whichever age
[1:51:32] that we are in God has a witness God had
[1:51:36] a witness by in Abraham
[1:51:40] for God spoke to him and said come out
[1:51:44] from amongst your people leave them and
[1:51:48] go into a country where I have called
[1:51:51] you
[1:51:51] recognize no Bible was written there was
[1:51:55] no priest no pop no superintendents no
[1:51:59] man of that he just heard a voice
[1:52:03] he heard an Unwritten War he heart the
[1:52:07] spirit speaking to his heart and it
[1:52:10] caught his attention
[1:52:12] and he turned aside oh God is asking us
[1:52:16] tonight as this new year approaches to
[1:52:19] turn aside amen he said but I'm a
[1:52:22] Christian even as a Christian God is
[1:52:25] calling you up high up
[1:52:27] God is calling you into another
[1:52:29] dimension he's calling you to put board
[1:52:32] from more effort amen put yourself into
[1:52:36] the world pray some more than you ever
[1:52:39] prayed before read the Bible read the
[1:52:43] messages listen to them day and night
[1:52:45] let them consume your soul amen until
[1:52:49] you can break the power of Satan because
[1:52:52] that's right will act just like he did
[1:52:55] in this Bible amen all that happened
[1:52:58] with him in the Bible the bride is going
[1:53:01] to repeat it all Hallelujah and God is
[1:53:04] calling on us to recognize this and turn
[1:53:07] away from the blind everyday Church Life
[1:53:12] oh I'm going to church let me tell you
[1:53:15] when you start us you understand that
[1:53:17] going to church all is Supernatural you
[1:53:20] don't even know what's going to happen
[1:53:22] any night while you're in here you don't
[1:53:25] know what's going to happen any day when
[1:53:27] you come to church you don't know when
[1:53:30] the fire of God will fall you don't know
[1:53:33] when the light of God will make itself
[1:53:35] manifest you don't know when the
[1:53:38] supernatural will decide to come on the
[1:53:41] scene Hallelujah so we must come with
[1:53:44] expectation amen don't come with your
[1:53:48] with your church Unity back into you
[1:53:51] in other words you're saved and you and
[1:53:55] you walk away from that but you've been
[1:53:57] so long in that that you you soak in
[1:54:00] some of it and then you come in the
[1:54:02] house of God and you want to act the
[1:54:05] same way but no sir no brother no sister
[1:54:09] we are God's Jew drops we don't come to
[1:54:12] stay here we didn't come to fit in here
[1:54:15] we didn't come to conform here but we're
[1:54:18] going back by the pull of the sun back
[1:54:21] where we come from in the presence of
[1:54:24] the Living God hallelujah I'm on my way

[1:54:48] air he hears a voice
[1:54:50] oh my and uh most of us who of course
[1:54:55] would be scared no doubt he was scared
[1:54:57] but something in him let him know that
[1:55:00] that's not an evil voice is that the
[1:55:03] comforting from that voice something
[1:55:06] warm coming from that voice and he
[1:55:09] listened to the voice and that voice God
[1:55:12] telling him come out from your own
[1:55:14] people come out and go to a land Canaan
[1:55:18] that where I have called you and the
[1:55:21] Bible says us says that he not even
[1:55:25] without the question
[1:55:26] obeyed the voice of God hallelujah amen

[1:55:38] voice in this day have you been
[1:55:40] attracted by a voice in this hour let me
[1:55:43] tell you even now even though I've heard
[1:55:46] that voice thousands and thousands of
[1:55:49] times there is no voice like that voice
[1:55:52] there is not a spirit upon any man in
[1:55:55] this hour like that voice that came
[1:55:58] through that man Hallelujah because it's
[1:56:00] the voice of God to us in this last day
[1:56:03] amen oh it caused me to turn aside
[1:56:06] uh oh our brothers the first time I
[1:56:09] heard it I was still in the bible

[2:03:52] and he maybe was preaching in his
[2:03:56] limited way in some denomination but in
[2:03:59] any case he was there with the flock but
[2:04:01] again he looked and he saw the Bush on
[2:04:07] fire
[2:04:08] and this light in the bush attracted his
[2:04:13] attention and the Bible says and he
[2:04:16] turned aside amen and then he said to
[2:04:20] himself let me turn aside and go see
[2:04:24] what this is all about amen praise God

[2:06:23] light
[2:06:24] he saw the light coming to him in the
[2:06:27] prayer room and out of the light stepped
[2:06:30] at 200 pound man with folded arms
[2:06:34] amen I am sent from the presence of
[2:06:37] almighty God to tell you about your
[2:06:40] peculiar life and about your ministry
[2:06:43] and then he began to tell him a lot of
[2:06:46] other things amen but to see that his
[2:06:50] life his ministry and his life turned
[2:06:53] aside because he was a Baptist preacher
[2:06:56] amen but he turned aside he turned aside
[2:07:00] from what denominationalism
[2:07:02] he turned aside from the system that he
[2:07:05] was in
[2:07:07] who the person that spoke to him caused
[2:07:11] him to see the light
[2:07:12] hallelujah oh praise God no wonder I
[2:07:16] think Hank Williams saying that I saw
[2:07:18] the light I Saw The Light No More in
[2:07:22] darkness no more at night oh hallelujah
[2:07:25] praise God I thank God that I've seen
[2:07:28] that I hope you've seen the light
[2:07:30] I said I hope you've seen the light
[2:07:33] oh praise God turn him aside oh my from
[2:07:38] his denominationalism and then all of a
[2:07:40] sudden he was a one of the greatest
[2:07:43] Pentecostal preachers then all of a
[2:07:45] sudden they started to hear him talking
[2:07:47] against the nominations why he saw the
[2:07:51] light oh praise God and now he's talking
[2:07:55] against the systems that are out there
[2:07:58] in the world Amen and there his ministry
[2:08:03] God began to use it for his glory and
[2:08:06] for his honor then one day
[2:08:10] he was in the hotel room
[2:08:13] and the voice said
[2:08:15] rise up
[2:08:17] start walking
[2:08:19] he came out of the hotel

[2:08:48] don't know what I'm really doing what is
[2:08:50] this all about you trust God that God
[2:08:53] will lead your right straight to the
[2:08:56] promised land

[2:09:18] a woman leaning on a white picket fence
[2:09:23] with her here all wrapped amen praise

[2:09:30] South because women are wrapping their
[2:09:31] head in that same old Jemima Aunt Jemima
[2:09:35] way with the head wraps amen oh my and
[2:09:39] when he saw the woman he still didn't
[2:09:42] clue into anything but the woman's
[2:09:44] morning person

[2:09:49] said well you see last night I had and
[2:09:53] she's beginning to tell him the dream
[2:09:55] and she said but where is the briefcase
[2:09:58] you're supposed the brown briefcase is
[2:09:59] supposed to have he said oh my goodness
[2:10:02] he said I left it in the hotel room
[2:10:05] according to God oh my her face gone up
[2:10:09] and his fate God to pray for her and
[2:10:13] them two are manipotences meet is that
[2:10:16] right oh praise God and so he prayed for
[2:10:20] you know the great uh results of that
[2:10:24] her son was delivered and and what
[2:10:26] became a conductor and years later
[2:10:28] brother Bradham going to catch a train
[2:10:30] and hear a voice and there is the young
[2:10:33] man now God now he's a young man he's
[2:10:35] not a boy anymore and rejoicing and
[2:10:37] praising God forevermore but you see
[2:10:40] what I want to say there
[2:10:42] brother Branham even though he was
[2:10:45] already a Christian already a Believer
[2:10:47] already preaching the message to a
[2:10:49] certain level he's still in his mind had
[2:10:52] his own plans
[2:10:54] he had his own way of when and how he
[2:10:57] wanted to do certain things
[2:11:00] and God has got to fine-tune our
[2:11:03] training on our teaching
[2:11:05] and bring us to a place where
[2:11:07] individually we begin to understand how
[2:11:10] to be led by the spirit
[2:11:12] how to understand the voice of God how
[2:11:16] to recognize when to turn this way when
[2:11:19] to turn that way when to stop the
[2:11:21] conversation when to speak when not to
[2:11:23] speak when and so on praise God God is
[2:11:27] wanting to fine-tune us and bring us
[2:11:30] under his Divine complete control for
[2:11:33] his glory amen so he had to turn aside
[2:11:37] from his own mind his own thoughts his
[2:11:39] own ways to obey God and God Alone
[2:11:44] amen yes sir and that's where we are at
[2:11:48] here today by His Marvelous Wonderful

[2:12:40] remember
[2:12:42] they had no clocks in that time they
[2:12:45] measured the time by the Stars
[2:12:49] so they had to pay attention to the
[2:12:52] stars but even though they were paying
[2:12:55] attention to the Stars none of them saw
[2:12:58] this star
[2:13:00] amen because that star was meant only
[2:13:04] for those wise men of that day

[2:18:14] away you may think denomination but no
[2:18:16] even in the natural world it's set up
[2:18:19] with systems Educational Systems this
[2:18:22] system that system and they try to train
[2:18:25] on the culture rate the people to work
[2:18:28] walk in these circumscribed areas that
[2:18:33] they have put and they call it keeping
[2:18:35] the law well we are supposed to keep the
[2:18:38] law but God knows how to make you walk
[2:18:40] through their Maze of life and walk
[2:18:43] right out under his divine inspiration
[2:18:46] Hallelujah God wants us all to turn
[2:18:49] aside
[2:18:50] amen while we were in Israel
[2:18:55] we were taken to a shopping area no cars
[2:18:59] allowed you can just walk and shop from
[2:19:02] Little Store to little store wherever
[2:19:05] you wanted to shop but you know even the
[2:19:09] Jews they I said dim and the uh the
[2:19:14] seraphim Jews the ones that are
[2:19:17] conservative
[2:19:19] they were even looking at our sisters
[2:19:22] how they were dressed because the rest
[2:19:26] of them will be at Arab or Jews they
[2:19:29] dressed as we would call here like the
[2:19:31] world they're dressed the same way with
[2:19:34] their pants or this or that and we'll go
[2:19:37] about their business uh like that but
[2:19:39] when they see our sisters it catches
[2:19:42] their attention in every uh possible way
[2:19:45] like that and God is calling on us to
[2:19:49] turn aside
[2:19:50] is that right
[2:19:52] turn aside turn your eyes away from the
[2:19:55] things of the world uh sisters God is
[2:19:58] calling us because you see the spirit is
[2:20:01] here the spirit of the devil is there to
[2:20:04] try to make us as Christians to live as
[2:20:08] close as we can to the world to look a
[2:20:11] little bit like them but yet not like
[2:20:14] them or else we gonna be mocked uh are
[2:20:18] we gonna be scar scoff that we're gonna
[2:20:21] have to bear some reproach so we try to
[2:20:25] skirt The Edge and to live this way amen
[2:20:30] or that way praise God hallelujah but
[2:20:34] God wants us not to go back to those
[2:20:36] Fashions of the world
[2:20:38] God don't want you going back to the
[2:20:41] king's Palace
[2:20:43] to see how he is living and they are
[2:20:46] living over there
[2:20:48] you don't want you as a wise woman or a
[2:20:50] wise man to go back to herod's Palace

[2:21:30] the thoughts and ways machinations and
[2:21:35] behaviors of the world that is out there
[2:21:39] I trust God will help us to to really be
[2:21:44] truly wise Hallelujah and may this great
[2:21:49] Supernatural a Mystic Voice and sign and

[2:22:33] hallelujah amen oh praise God I'm
[2:22:37] praying that the Holy Spirit of the
[2:22:39] Living God as we used to sing a long ago
[2:22:44] flow through me
[2:22:47] Holy Spirit
[2:22:49] flow through me
[2:22:53] flow through me
[2:22:55] Holy Spirit
[2:22:58] flow through me as I raise my hands to
[2:23:02] worship and to glorify thy name O Holy
[2:23:07] Spirit flow through me amen yes sir
[2:23:11] there is a river that flows from the
[2:23:13] Throne of God and it flows from deep
[2:23:16] within amen and God sends forth that
[2:23:19] River to cleanse our hearts from sin and
[2:23:22] to make us blessed men and women that
[2:23:26] will bring forth the correct fruit in
[2:23:28] his season and for his glory amen I
[2:23:32] trust God will help us to turn aside
[2:23:35] amen because look
[2:23:37] it's not that because we preachers make
[2:23:41] sometimes preach so hard that we don't
[2:23:44] recognize that our sisters do have a
[2:23:49] hard time
[2:23:50] in coping with the way they have to
[2:23:53] dress with the way they have to behave
[2:23:57] we recognize that but we have an
[2:24:00] obligation to preach the word of God
[2:24:03] Amen but not all of us preach it in love
[2:24:07] we preach it but not all of us do preach
[2:24:10] the word of God in love so the way they
[2:24:15] dress
[2:24:16] and the length of the dresses amen
[2:24:20] praise God if you don't understand talk
[2:24:22] to your Deacon talk to your ministers
[2:24:25] that are in here amen praise the Lord so
[2:24:28] they have a hard time sometimes keeping
[2:24:30] that and they get a hard time sometimes
[2:24:33] and even being able to buy it in a store
[2:24:36] because the devil's making sure you take
[2:24:38] it off the shelf
[2:24:40] so you can't get it and then you say the
[2:24:43] prophet says oh go and make it just get
[2:24:45] a sewing machine there well remember
[2:24:48] they hardly know how to sew
[2:24:51] you can hardly patch a shirt or patch or
[2:24:53] pants or patch their own clothes much
[2:24:56] less so I know sisters it's you it's a
[2:25:00] hard season and a hard time we're in but
[2:25:03] remember as the Press is coming down
[2:25:06] upon us we are getting ready to go up
[2:25:09] for his glory and for his honor amen
[2:25:12] praise God hallelujah I tell you friends
[2:25:15] it's really tough and it's tough again
[2:25:19] uh also in the message amen for women
[2:25:25] sisters
[2:25:27] to take off all day
[2:25:30] what you call it the makeup
[2:25:33] praise God why you have to make up
[2:25:35] anyway
[2:25:36] praise God hallelujah God made us the
[2:25:39] way we are
[2:25:41] is that right
[2:25:42] you can say whatever you want you're
[2:25:45] black you're white you're Chinese you're
[2:25:46] this so what God who is God made
[2:25:49] everything and he said it's perfect
[2:25:52] because that's the way he wants it
[2:25:55] he didn't make one set of flowers he
[2:25:58] make all kinds of flowers and when those
[2:26:01] flowers get together and the contrast
[2:26:03] between them you see the beauty of God
[2:26:06] while they're nodding their heads in the
[2:26:08] Winds of the spirit as the spirit of God
[2:26:10] passes by oh blessed be the name of the
[2:26:13] Living God hallelujah so you have a hard
[2:26:16] time with with taking off all that stuff
[2:26:20] amen our time with your hair and a hard
[2:26:24] time with this I'm not going to go
[2:26:25] through the list but I'm just letting
[2:26:27] you know that uh recognize you do have a
[2:26:30] hard time but that's what each one of us
[2:26:33] has a journey
[2:26:35] and each one of us has got to come to
[2:26:38] the place where we break through
[2:26:41] where we have entered into his rest
[2:26:44] and it's no more a battle with things
[2:26:47] like that
[2:26:48] because now I'm resting in his care I'm
[2:26:51] comforted by his love I'm walking in his
[2:26:54] light and I know that I am led by the
[2:26:58] God's holy spirit amen may God help us
[2:27:01] men
[2:27:03] that are here tonight anywhere that
[2:27:06] claims to believe this message
[2:27:08] May the Holy Spirit teach us how to
[2:27:12] conduct ourselves in this world that we
[2:27:16] can walk out of it in white
[2:27:18] to conduct ourselves with our friends
[2:27:21] family Neighbors
[2:27:23] how to conduct ourselves either with our
[2:27:27] wives
[2:27:29] and I'm saying what I'm saying because
[2:27:31] just a couple of nights ago is something
[2:27:35] that the Lord just showed me said see I
[2:27:39] made you see this when you were just a
[2:27:41] boy so that you might know how to act
[2:27:44] and move in this certain situations and
[2:27:48] God wants every one of us by the Holy
[2:27:51] Spirit of almighty God to know how to
[2:27:55] walk how to live with him and in him and
[2:27:58] to manifest the flow of this great gift
[2:28:01] that God has given to every one of us
[2:28:04] may God help us to turn aside from all
[2:28:07] the things that are in this world here
[2:28:09] tonight and may we all together here
[2:28:12] bring glory to his name because friends
[2:28:15] simple as it is
[2:28:17] there were warned of God by a dream
[2:28:21] you're not being warned of God by a
[2:28:24] dream

[2:30:00] advantage of it amen may God help us to
[2:30:04] turn aside despite that that
[2:30:08] this look it's a despised way after
[2:30:11] clearing your mind
[2:30:13] this is a despised way we are in
[2:30:16] you are not of that group of so-called
[2:30:19] Christians where you wanted to be known
[2:30:23] you're a Christian
[2:30:25] and uh it's acceptable to society to
[2:30:29] recognize that you are born again
[2:30:33] and you become more so-called respected
[2:30:36] if you are a church man or looked upon
[2:30:40] as a church woman that woman prays in
[2:30:44] church that woman goes for this mass
[2:30:45] that woman who goes for this certain
[2:30:48] service or the no no no that's wonderful
[2:30:51] for outward uh appearances but God wants
[2:30:57] that worship and that service to pulsate

[2:32:05] and the devil will get some of them to
[2:32:07] even tell you you're old-fashioned amen
[2:32:10] but thank God we acknowledge we are all
[2:32:14] fashioned
[2:32:16] because we come from the old time
[2:32:18] religion
[2:32:19] we come from the all-time worship we
[2:32:23] come the all-time praising God like we
[2:32:25] were up in glory there is not all the
[2:32:28] former worship no all no way of hearing
[2:32:31] glory to God than that when we were in
[2:32:34] his divine presence

[2:32:39] we are of the Ancient of Days
[2:32:42] amen praise God hallelujah God is asking
[2:32:47] us to turn aside amen yes sir and I'm
[2:32:51] not even call you everything else I
[2:32:53] can't even think of anything else but
[2:32:54] they can make up things you never even
[2:32:56] dream of to call you other than calling
[2:32:59] you old-fashioned they may call you all
[2:33:01] kinds and other names and you might be
[2:33:04] able to give some of them to me so I can
[2:33:06] know what they are amen oh my us man
[2:33:10] it's very easy for men to tell men off
[2:33:14] because men are more uh bold and brave
[2:33:18] and they wear talking and God are you
[2:33:20] not mad at all fanatic
[2:33:23] is that right yeah you're out of uh line
[2:33:27] with the times I don't want to be in
[2:33:30] line with the times I want to be in line
[2:33:33] with the Timeless one
[2:33:35] I want to be in line with the word of
[2:33:37] God hallelujah amen and let us all here
[2:33:41] tonight say Lord I want to go the way
[2:33:44] you want me to go I want to live the way
[2:33:48] you want me to live I want to turn aside
[2:33:51] from these attractions that are out
[2:33:55] there in the world and while I'm talking
[2:33:57] I just thought of something I read today
[2:34:00] where brother Brandon said when those
[2:34:02] sheep are following a Shepherd he saw
[2:34:05] them he said he wondered why they
[2:34:08] weren't turning aside a juicy piece of
[2:34:10] this is over there that he knows sheep
[2:34:13] like but they're still not going to eat
[2:34:14] it they go on a little more there's
[2:34:17] another Bush that sheep love but they're
[2:34:19] not going there they just keep their
[2:34:21] eyes on the shepherd and they keep
[2:34:23] walking following him that's what we
[2:34:25] have to do Look Away to Jesus come look
[2:34:28] to the left not to the right don't look
[2:34:30] at though storms that are all around you
[2:34:33] the troubles and the trials keep your
[2:34:35] Eyes On Jesus and he will bring you
[2:34:38] safely through amen hallelujah oh praise
[2:34:42] God the great Minister Oral Roberts once
[2:34:45] preached a great message of these few
[2:34:48] words I always remember you can't go
[2:34:51] under when he says you're going over
[2:34:56] I said you can't go under because God
[2:34:58] says you're going over
[2:35:01] no matter what Temptation whatever trial
[2:35:03] whatever pressing the devil brings
[2:35:05] against you your mind you can't go under
[2:35:09] amen because God says let's go over to
[2:35:13] the other side
[2:35:14] it settled when he once he says that oh
[2:35:18] praise God hallelujah amen praise God
[2:35:21] amen amen praise God fanatics
[2:35:27] Fanatics Billy Fanatics brother Mike oh
[2:35:31] my Fanatics brother Josh amen that's
[2:35:35] what the world would call some of us men
[2:35:38] who holds to God's word and the promises
[2:35:41] of this day with Divine understanding
[2:35:44] praise the name of the Lord you know
[2:35:47] it's hard for men to
[2:35:50] because sometimes
[2:35:52] they want to share like you would
[2:35:55] whatever to their family
[2:35:58] to their dear loving friends to their
[2:36:01] work Associates to their neighbors they
[2:36:05] want to share it with people whom they
[2:36:06] appreciate and love with all their heart
[2:36:09] but yet this those very people will turn
[2:36:12] around and call you a fanatic until you
[2:36:15] shut up when you come around here when
[2:36:17] you're talking to me don't talk nothing
[2:36:19] about nor Jesus and about no uh prophet
[2:36:23] and about no message and all the stuff
[2:36:25] and we don't want to hear it and they'll
[2:36:28] turn you down and shut you up amen but
[2:36:32] you know we'll go another way because
[2:36:35] God taught the prophet how to go another
[2:36:37] way
[2:36:38] the prophet will start talking about
[2:36:40] cars
[2:36:41] and Automobiles and then you'll talk
[2:36:44] about fishing or to another man as God
[2:36:47] will lead him he talked about hunting
[2:36:49] and then later on maybe they talk for an
[2:36:51] hour and then the conversation would
[2:36:53] somehow merge into what the Holy Spirit
[2:36:57] really wants him to say so you've got to
[2:37:00] talk to God let God teach you and show
[2:37:02] you how to go another way by the grace
[2:37:05] of God hallelujah how to take God's
[2:37:08] despised way and bring glory to his name
[2:37:12] amen praise God I tell you I want God
[2:37:15] that's living in my heart to be made
[2:37:18] manifest perfectly
[2:37:20] for his glory amen because he's not a
[2:37:23] dead God
[2:37:24] and he's a living God
[2:37:26] I can feel brother Mike's desire amen I
[2:37:29] know you all have desires but praise God
[2:37:31] we want to see a living God
[2:37:35] we've been preaching about him to you
[2:37:37] we've been talking bringing the word but
[2:37:39] you see God wants us to a certain place
[2:37:41] before he can make himself manifest amen
[2:37:45] before he can do this praise God and
[2:37:48] that he might be glorified amen praise
[2:37:51] God and I pray tonight that we would all
[2:37:55] reconsecrate ourselves to him praise God
[2:37:58] would you do that
[2:38:00] we consecrate Our Lives to him praise
[2:38:04] God may we pray a prince and Lord help
[2:38:07] me let me turn aside
[2:38:10] let me really turn aside take a good
[2:38:15] look at ourselves
[2:38:17] and I pray praise God that the angels of
[2:38:21] God will sweep down Among Us Praise the
[2:38:25] Lord you know he said that he said
[2:38:27] you'll be in them meetings at that time
[2:38:30] and suddenly you'll feel a sweep of
[2:38:33] divine love go through that place before
[2:38:37] you anoint you're traveling like a sock
[2:38:39] amen praise God before you can recognize
[2:38:43] your little presence of the Living God
[2:38:45] hallelujah brother sister I believe
[2:38:47] we're living in those kinds of times
[2:38:49] right now
