[40:12] let's continue to lift him up as Joshua
[40:16] and cab lift Moses hands up continue to
[40:19] support and pray for him um our first
[40:23] scripture is Matthew
[40:25] 13: 11 to 17 um I'll be using that
[40:30] scriptures back and forth while I'm
[40:32] reading I'll go back to verse 12 verse
[40:35] 13 and just
[40:38] expanded so
[40:41] Matthew
[40:46] 131-7 he
[40:52] answered he
[40:54] answered and said unto them
[40:58] because it is given unto you to know the
[41:00] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[41:03] to them it is not
[41:05] given for whosoever had to
[41:09] him um to him shall be
[41:13] given and he shall have more abundance
[41:16] but whosoever have not from him shall be
[41:19] taken away even that he had therefore
[41:24] speak I to them in Parables because they
[41:27] seeing see not and hearing they hear not
[41:31] neither do they understand and in them
[41:35] is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah
[41:38] which said by hearing you shall hear and
[41:41] shall not understand and seeing ye shall
[41:44] see and shall not perceive for the
[41:48] people's heart is wor gross and their
[41:51] ears are dull of hearing and their eyes
[41:55] they have closed let at any time they
[41:59] should see with their eyes and hear with
[42:02] their ears and should understand with
[42:04] their heart and should be converted and
[42:08] I should heal them but blessed are your
[42:12] eyes for they see and your ears for they
[42:16] hear for very I say unto you that many
[42:19] prophets and righteous men have desired
[42:22] to see those things which you see and
[42:25] have not seen them and to hear those
[42:28] things which you hear and have not heard
[42:31] them my next scripture is revelation 3:7
[42:34] and Isaiah
[42:37] 22:22 Revelation
[42:44] 3:7 and to the angel of the church in
[42:48] Philadelphia WR these things said he
[42:51] that is Holy he that is
[42:55] true he that had the Key of David he
[43:00] that open and no man sh it and Sh it and
[43:04] no man open Isaiah
[43:16] 22:22 and the key of the House of David
[43:20] will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall
[43:23] open and N shall shut and shall shut and
[43:27] None Shall open Heavenly Father please
[43:31] bless the reading of this word in Jesus
[43:33] name amen please be
[43:37] seated I think the scriptures alone is
[43:39] enough for the day can
[43:48] just okay um I'm just going to
[43:52] read this quotation and then
[44:00] um okay my topic will be he
[44:03] that hold the key of David when he
[44:07] shuted no one can open when he opens no
[44:11] one can shut Isaiah
[44:16] 22:22 that's my
[44:25] title he he open and None Shall shut and
[44:29] he shall shut and None Shall open that's
[44:31] the title so I'm going to read this here
[44:34] in
[44:34] um P loc Caterpillar by Reverend William
[44:40] Mar Braham
[44:42] 59823 paragraph 55 to 60 the other
[44:48] day I was talking and we were thinking
[44:52] of scripture I said why can't people see
[44:55] that I said that there it is and I
[44:59] happen to think I don't care how clear
[45:01] it is how much the scripture teaches it
[45:05] you will never be able to see it until
[45:07] God himself show it to you don't care
[45:11] how clear it is and the whole Bible is
[45:15] built and the whole Church of the Living
[45:17] God is built upon a spiritual revelation
[45:21] of the word why did Abel offer a more
[45:25] excellent sacrifice than King why did
[45:28] Abel follow King why didn't Abel follow
[45:31] King he had the most beautiful church
[45:35] but it was revealed to him when Jesus
[45:38] came from man transgression and they
[45:40] said who does man say I the son of man
[45:43] am one said Eli and one you are the
[45:47] prophet and so forth he said but who do
[45:50] you say person now I am Peter said Thou
[45:53] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[45:57] he said blessed art thou Simon the son
[46:01] of Jonas for Flesh and Blood never
[46:04] revealed this to you you never learn it
[46:07] with some books or by some Seminary or
[46:11] some station of mindmate
[46:13] schem but my Father in Heaven has
[46:16] revealed that to you and upon this Str I
[46:19] will build my church and the Gates of
[46:22] Hell cannot Prevail against it there you
[46:26] are spiritual
[46:27] revelation of the word of God in Matthew
[46:31] 11 the one that we just read I didn't
[46:33] even know that um this thing T that's
[46:37] fine I got the scripture then I found
[46:38] this tied up with that along it is
[46:41] written that though Jesus had done so
[46:44] many miracles so many signs that he was
[46:48] the Messiah yet the people could not
[46:50] believe it because Isaiah said they got
[46:53] eyes and they can't see they got ears
[46:55] and they can't hear how though they were
[46:58] Scholars though they were top religion
[47:01] religionists they were holy and without
[47:04] fault and Without Blame if they were
[47:07] found one iot wrong they were stoned
[47:11] without mercy no man could lay a finger
[47:14] on that they studyed the scripture day
[47:18] and night generation after generation
[47:22] and so God had blinded their eyes say
[47:26] God did
[47:27] that's what he
[47:29] said God does what he wants to we cannot
[47:32] tell him what to do did not Paul in the
[47:34] book of the Romans 8 said that God
[47:36] raised up pharaoh and hardened his heart
[47:39] blinded his eyes for the same purpose
[47:42] that his will might be work was not Esau
[47:45] and Jacob refused Esau refused before
[47:48] the boy was ever born God despised him
[47:50] you see it is all working according to
[47:52] God's Great predestination he's not one
[47:55] that is asleep he knows exactly
[47:57] amen so from the scriptures that we have
[48:00] read so many of them already it's clear
[48:03] to you and me that you cannot give
[48:06] yourself
[48:07] Revelation you cannot wake up yourself
[48:10] to receive Revelation he said I hold the
[48:13] key of David when I open no one can shut
[48:18] when I shut no one can open it's all
[48:21] about him he can choose to open your
[48:24] understanding he can choose to close it
[48:26] you can't for God he's a sovereign God
[48:29] he does what he desires to do he said
[48:33] that even he said that um except the
[48:35] Lord build a house the Builder build but
[48:39] in vain except the um the Lord watch the
[48:44] tower the watch man watch the city the
[48:46] watch man Wicked but in vain so you can
[48:49] do I'm not saying that you have to be
[48:52] lazy or you don't have to have knowledge
[48:56] or anything anything you can do your
[48:58] part but God is a sovereign he can
[49:02] choose to open your understanding he can
[49:04] choose to what close it but those that
[49:07] are his children because said that no
[49:09] one comes to the father except the
[49:12] father except I draw him first so those
[49:15] that are children of God God open thee
[49:17] understanding to see what is happening
[49:20] in every day and he reveal all the
[49:23] Mysteries to them because there's
[49:24] nothing that he going to hide from his
[49:26] children as when he was going to destroy
[49:29] Sodom and Gomorrah he said can I hide
[49:32] anything from Abraham and you been a
[49:34] royal Seed of Abraham God will never
[49:37] hide anything from you the whole world
[49:39] is in Tom oil the whole world is in
[49:42] chaos but the bride of Christ know what
[49:44] is going on because the prophet of told
[49:47] if you want to know what time you are
[49:48] living watch Israel so the bride of
[49:52] Christ will type what is happening in
[49:54] Israel and he knows what is going on on
[49:57] and the whole world is in Tomb oil you
[49:59] don't know what is happening but God has
[50:02] not hide himself from his children
[50:05] because if God hided himself from it
[50:07] means that you are not his those that
[50:09] are his he said blessed are your eyes
[50:12] for they can see amen you didn't work
[50:16] yourself out to
[50:17] that he gave it to you he open your eyes
[50:20] of understanding to see what is
[50:23] happening even now not in the past not
[50:26] in the future but you can recognize what
[50:29] God is doing present stage of his
[50:32] ministry because you are blessed you are
[50:35] chosen you are PR
[50:37] predestinated you are God's son or God's
[50:40] daughter so he cannot bypass you but he
[50:44] has revealed himself to you and all the
[50:47] time as we we read from the quote he
[50:51] said that those theologians those rabes
[50:54] those people they have gone to school
[50:57] from years and they know all the
[51:00] scriptures from A to Z but they couldn't
[51:04] recognize him when he was here because
[51:06] he blinded their eyes they are not his
[51:09] children they can study the Midnight Oil
[51:12] and study night and day but said I will
[51:14] not open your eyes of I've shut it but
[51:18] his
[51:19] children he open it to them amen and
[51:22] they can just see it clear as clear can
[51:25] be because revelation
[51:27] you canot receive by re Revelation by
[51:30] working through it you receive it
[51:33] effortlessly because God effortlessly
[51:36] give it to you if you are one of his
[51:38] children I'm not saying that you have to
[51:40] be lazy you don't have to dig in you
[51:42] have to but do God give it in on his own
[51:46] time and sometimes maybe it's not time
[51:49] for you to know something he W let let
[51:51] you know before time when you the time
[51:54] for you to know he will make what known
[51:57] to you that's the god that we are
[51:59] serving he is a living God and he never
[52:03] changed he's the same yesterday today
[52:06] and forever amen our God is awesome God
[52:11] hallelujah so those Pharisees those um
[52:15] learned people what is happening is that
[52:20] this Bible the letter kill it but the
[52:24] spirit give life when God God throws his
[52:27] light on it then it shines it light it
[52:31] it becomes life so the letter will kill
[52:34] you people are using the letter and
[52:37] killing and doing all kind of manner of
[52:39] things with it but the true bride of
[52:42] Christ God give them understanding and
[52:45] they know what to do with the word of
[52:47] God they don't go ahead of themselves
[52:49] they don't misplace the word they don't
[52:51] um put it anywhere they allow the Lord
[52:54] to lead them and make it clear has
[52:56] crystal clear and he becomes clear to
[52:59] them because it's God who is leading him
[53:02] he's not being led by himself but he has
[53:05] surrendered himself to the Living God
[53:07] and he's guiding and he's directing his
[53:10] footsteps
[53:12] and as we read he shut the eyes of some
[53:17] he opened eyes of some and this thing
[53:20] has been in the existence from the
[53:23] Garden of Eden it TNS in the beginning
[53:27] TS in the end it was Cain and
[53:30] Abel but Abel did not go to any SCH as
[53:33] our Pastor said he not have any bible to
[53:36] read but by revelation God revealed to
[53:39] him that it was blood that caused the
[53:41] fall of his parents and being that being
[53:45] revealed to him was able to make what
[53:47] the right sacrifice and the children of
[53:50] God is always word of God is always
[53:52] based on Revelation Cain just went by by
[53:56] his eyes the flowery and a lot of people
[54:00] are also thinking the same thing that
[54:04] good good works flowery thing best
[54:08] things design good to have a a wonderful
[54:12] church building good to have all those
[54:14] things but if God is not in that
[54:17] building if God is not the temple it
[54:19] doesn't become anything it's just a a
[54:24] symbol is that right it's it's not the
[54:27] mountain that is Holy but God in that
[54:29] mountain make that mountain holy it's
[54:32] not the people who are holy but holy
[54:35] ghost in them God in them makes it holy
[54:37] he lives his life through them so it's
[54:40] not by works of righteousness it's not
[54:42] how much you can do all I can do it's
[54:46] all about him and everything is based on
[54:49] Revelation without Revelation you cannot
[54:52] serve God you cannot please God that's
[54:54] what said it's impossible to please god
[54:56] without faith and faith is a revelation
[55:00] amen that's all the elders from the
[55:02] foundation of the world from the
[55:03] patriarch every one of them they they
[55:06] worship God by faith and faith is a
[55:10] revelation and when God reveals
[55:12] something to you you stand on it and you
[55:14] do it and God what V vindicate it
[55:18] because he reveal it to you he will make
[55:21] it clear he will testify of his gift let
[55:24] people know that he is the one that
[55:26] reveal himself to you amen and the Vine
[55:30] This has gone there all the time listen
[55:33] God doesn't look at your
[55:36] Works he looks into your heart amen he's
[55:40] looking into your desire amen that's the
[55:42] most important thing that's why Jacob
[55:45] and Esau before the children were even
[55:47] born God said I love Jacob Esau I hate
[55:53] why because him being God before the
[55:56] kids were born he knew that Esau is
[56:00] going to despise the birth right and
[56:03] that is what is happening even now a lot
[56:07] of people are selling their birth right
[56:11] so many people God has called them to
[56:14] this truth but they making their
[56:17] decision based on money not based on
[56:20] work not based on the revelation of the
[56:23] word God can even send someone to a good
[56:26] place is to receive the true word of God
[56:28] give him a job make some money but when
[56:31] opportunity comes to any I'm not saying
[56:33] you don't have to go but before you make
[56:35] that move you have to put God first a
[56:39] lot of people just go by their can mind
[56:41] they see the money they running you see
[56:43] what I mean and a lot of people even now
[56:47] the economy is very tough things are
[56:50] getting worse the Bible say going to get
[56:52] worse and worse and cold it's not going
[56:55] to be easy
[56:56] but stand by the word of God pay your
[57:00] sides be faithful to God how God is
[57:03] going to provide your needs I don't know
[57:06] but put him first seek him first the
[57:09] kingdom of God and his righteousness all
[57:12] other things shall be added unto it
[57:15] let's put God kingdom first let's put
[57:18] the word of God first let the word of
[57:20] God have prence anything we do we have
[57:23] to check it if it's in the word whatever
[57:25] you do you have to check is God pleased
[57:29] with what am I
[57:31] doing check it with the word of
[57:34] God don't be like
[57:37] Esau he was so hungry just for a pot of
[57:40] porridge he sold his b right Jacob was
[57:45] Rascal he was deceiver he did everything
[57:48] bad in the book when when he came the
[57:50] birth right he cherish it when he met
[57:53] that he said unless you bless me I'm not
[57:56] I leave you he struggled with the angel
[57:58] he fought with him until he got his
[58:01] Blessing so he a true Christian you got
[58:03] to fight is this is said the kingdom of
[58:06] God is taken by violence taken by
[58:08] violence sometime you got to force and
[58:11] push the devil away tell him Satan get
[58:13] hands behind me amen go to him and take
[58:16] whatever he stole from you if he stole
[58:19] your said I receive I take my health
[58:21] from you God restored me created me
[58:23] healthy you got no right to steal my
[58:26] health you got no right to steal my
[58:28] finances because God created you healthy
[58:32] he said whatsoever you ask in my name I
[58:34] will grant it to you amen amen so if you
[58:37] abide in me and my words abide in you
[58:41] ask whatever you will and I will grant
[58:43] it to you so God is willing to bless you
[58:46] God is willing to provide your need you
[58:49] have to ask you have to believe you have
[58:51] to speak and go for don't stay there
[58:54] don't let devil push you around he has
[58:56] pushed some of us around so much it's
[58:58] time to shake yourself when you say boo
[59:01] say boo back to him don't allow him to
[59:04] push you around you are greater than who
[59:06] you think you are because God is in you
[59:10] now why said that when the time come
[59:11] when they recognize who they are they
[59:13] were going to be invisible Army because
[59:16] oh man that's why P Sam was say like
[59:18] when one time King George was going to a
[59:20] battle he was going to turn back and one
[59:23] of his his servants said remember who
[59:25] you are in jge and just ride or ride or
[59:28] just for and get a victory it's time you
[59:30] have to recognize who you are you are a
[59:33] son or daughter of the Living God you
[59:36] are apple of God's eye amen with all the
[59:39] billions in the world God chose you he
[59:42] selected you he predestinated you to
[59:46] eternal life man what else what else
[59:50] blessed your eyes for they can
[59:52] see oh man I'm s i said I can't get away
[59:57] from this am it's become so clear and
[59:59] crystal clear to me the grace of God and
[1:00:03] the love of God Amen God is so good
[1:00:13] Hallelujah those two Vines are still
[1:00:16] here in the time of Jesus we have
[1:00:20] Judas it was still there amen you was
[1:00:26] with Jesus Christ what happened is
[1:00:29] that bra brah explained that sometimes
[1:00:34] God purposely say certain things to put
[1:00:38] some people
[1:00:39] out to let some Ponder and to bring some
[1:00:43] also in okay so he gave an example with
[1:00:48] Jesus Christ in the first pool of
[1:00:50] ministry there were thousands following
[1:00:53] his
[1:00:54] ministry one day he said except eat of
[1:00:57] My Flesh and drink of my blood you have
[1:01:00] no part in me and all left and it was
[1:01:03] left 70 then he said the son of man who
[1:01:08] is now here now in heaven and they say
[1:01:12] we haven't heard of this and they all
[1:01:15] left and it was left only 12 and one was
[1:01:17] devil Judas saying his ministry then he
[1:01:20] asked Peter will he also go then Peter
[1:01:23] said thou alone H has the word of life
[1:01:27] where can we go where can we go where
[1:01:30] God has brought us this far he has kept
[1:01:33] us all these years it's not by works of
[1:01:36] right God has kept you here through
[1:01:39] trials through tribulations all these
[1:01:42] years what is keeping you he has kept us

[1:04:01] easy if if you have everything is there
[1:04:03] the devil has already got you because he
[1:04:06] doesn't care about you but as son or
[1:04:09] daughter of God you always going to go
[1:04:12] through and one thing you have to
[1:04:14] remember that God that delivers us from
[1:04:17] that financial problem that delivered
[1:04:20] her from um maybe marriage problem
[1:04:22] deliver from this when the situation
[1:04:25] comes just calm
[1:04:27] down and commit it to
[1:04:31] God he will bring it to pass sometimes
[1:04:35] we look at the situation we look at
[1:04:37] conditions we force to make decisions by
[1:04:41] the flesh sometime you don't
[1:04:44] wait you can get into a tight
[1:04:47] corner and you just want to get the T
[1:04:51] fast fast and you want to use everything
[1:04:53] to get it but if you sit down quiet it
[1:04:56] and come down and commit it to God he
[1:05:00] will bring it to pass no wonder that the
[1:05:03] Bible said that the patience of Abraham
[1:05:05] he got patience to wait for 25 years and
[1:05:09] even after the 25 years God still try
[1:05:13] him and said the very thing that you
[1:05:15] have waited for all these years I I want
[1:05:19] you to give it to me sacrifice it to me
[1:05:21] amen you see what I mean God said I want
[1:05:25] to sacrifice the very thing that you
[1:05:27] have cried for you have waited for 25
[1:05:29] years but you know what Abraham's Faith
[1:05:32] was in God he believed that he gave him
[1:05:35] that child as someone who was what um
[1:05:38] all his his vitals were all gone he
[1:05:41] couldn't give birth at that if he's able
[1:05:43] to do that then God is able to raise his
[1:05:46] son up even if he sacrific him that's
[1:05:49] where the confidence you have to have in
[1:05:51] God no matter what comes our way no
[1:05:53] matter what happens to you I our life is
[1:05:56] in his hand he's in hand he going to
[1:05:59] take control over it let's commit our
[1:06:01] ways to god let's commit our thoughts to
[1:06:03] Let's commit every
[1:06:05] situation listen when you plant a corn
[1:06:10] you plant
[1:06:12] something all that you have to do is
[1:06:14] what you water it you can't go every
[1:06:17] time and take it up and see how he's
[1:06:19] doing so is God when you commit
[1:06:23] something to him let's leave it there
[1:06:26] and just thank him and know that his
[1:06:29] perfect will will be done because so
[1:06:32] many times certain things we don't
[1:06:34] understand initially but after a while
[1:06:37] he comes down and reveal to you why this
[1:06:40] happened why that happened why that
[1:06:42] happened I remember one time braam said
[1:06:44] that he was so angry with God that he
[1:06:46] went to pray for somebody and that
[1:06:48] person died and he said God you owe me
[1:06:51] an answer you owe me an answer you have
[1:06:54] to explain to me
[1:06:56] and later when he revealed to him what
[1:06:58] happened that the person could have died
[1:07:00] maybe 20 years back or whatever but he
[1:07:02] wasn't ready to go but after he received
[1:07:04] the word of God he was ready to go he
[1:07:07] said oh God forgive me God don't owe you
[1:07:11] nothing amen he is a sovereign God Amen
[1:07:14] whatever he does is Right amen I
[1:07:17] remember one time even in my life and I
[1:07:20] needed something from God and I was
[1:07:22] bothering him and praying and crying and
[1:07:25] oh one time then I was going through
[1:07:28] that the same nor and a voice like voice
[1:07:32] said that you cannot force God you
[1:07:34] cannot tell God what to do then I let
[1:07:37] the I leave it from that time I learned
[1:07:40] my lesson we have to leave everything in
[1:07:44] God's hands let's commit you to him and
[1:07:47] don't fight and fast he will make it
[1:07:49] plain amen praise our God hallelujah so
[1:07:55] I'm still on my
[1:07:57] topic that two Vines is still
[1:08:01] here in the time of Paul said that
[1:08:04] there's a what
[1:08:06] um graving wolves or whatever in wolves
[1:08:09] in a sheep
[1:08:11] skin in in among
[1:08:14] you it's still here and our time is
[1:08:17] still here you got to have that spirit
[1:08:19] of
[1:08:20] discernment and just focus on your word
[1:08:23] and let God have his own way because as
[1:08:25] I said that you cannot foruse God to
[1:08:28] give you a revelation those things are
[1:08:31] effortlessly he will reveal to you what
[1:08:33] you need to do amen but it's not your
[1:08:36] business God is the one who taking care
[1:08:38] of every situation and you're going to
[1:08:40] make everything what clear to you
[1:08:43] hallelujah praise God so I'm going to go
[1:08:46] back to the scripture that I read again
[1:08:50] and I read a little quote and still goes
[1:08:52] back with it um in Matthew 13:16 it said
[1:08:57] blessed are your eyes for they see and
[1:09:01] your ears for day
[1:09:04] here um I'll read this
[1:09:15] here in the church ages book he said
[1:09:18] that let me show you another reason why
[1:09:21] Satan hates This Book of Revelation of
[1:09:25] this Jesus Christ in the church he knows
[1:09:29] that it's a revelation of Jesus Christ I
[1:09:32] think page 15 he knows that Jesus Christ
[1:09:35] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:40] and he changes not he's know that a
[1:09:43] whole he know that a whole lot more than
[1:09:47] do 90% of the theologians he knows that
[1:09:51] since God is immutable in his nature
[1:09:54] then he's just as imitable in his ways
[1:09:58] thou Satan knows assuredly that the
[1:10:01] original church at Pentecost with the
[1:10:03] power of God Maxis in action is a true
[1:10:07] church that God claims as his own all
[1:10:11] else is false it has to be now remember
[1:10:16] this Christ in the true church is a
[1:10:19] continuation of what the book of Acts
[1:10:22] but the Book of Revelation shows how
[1:10:24] that Antichrist spirit will come into
[1:10:27] the church and defile it making it what
[1:10:31] look warm as our brother said is a
[1:10:35] spirit here formal and what
[1:10:38] powerless
[1:10:40] amen it exposes Satan revealing his
[1:10:44] Works attempted destruction of God's
[1:10:46] people and discing of God's word right
[1:10:49] down the time he cast into what the Lake
[1:10:52] of Fire he fights that he cannot stand
[1:10:56] it he knows that if the people get the
[1:10:59] true revelation of the true church and
[1:11:02] what she is what she stand for and that
[1:11:06] she cannot she can do the Greater Works
[1:11:09] she will be an invisible Army if they
[1:11:12] get a true revelation of the true
[1:11:14] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:11:16] Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:11:19] design and withand the Antichrist Spirit
[1:11:22] Satan will be what powerless before her
[1:11:26] he will be as definitely thed today as
[1:11:29] when Christ
[1:11:30] witho his every effort to gain power
[1:11:33] over him in the desert yes Satan hates
[1:11:36] Revelation but we love it with through
[1:11:40] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[1:11:43] Hell cannot what Prevail against but
[1:11:46] will will prevail okay this one said
[1:11:48] that making it look from former and
[1:11:51] Powerless there was a question asked
[1:11:53] that who going to seek more or who going
[1:11:56] to want to have God's more is that the
[1:11:59] person who have the Holy Ghost or the
[1:12:01] one who doesn't have if that person have
[1:12:04] the Holy Ghost he's the one that going
[1:12:06] to seek more of God he wants more
[1:12:08] because you can never reach that you
[1:12:10] always want to get more is is the
[1:12:13] presence of God listen in life that's
[1:12:16] why a lot of people they smoke read and
[1:12:19] they smoke cocaine they crack all this
[1:12:22] because God left a part of him himself
[1:12:26] in every human heart and in in only God
[1:12:31] can satisfy that test in that human
[1:12:34] heart some people try to satisfy with a
[1:12:38] brand new car it doesn't last a new
[1:12:42] house it doesn't last like for instance
[1:12:45] if you don't have a watch and you bought
[1:12:48] the swis watch for maybe a million
[1:12:51] dollar whatever it is for a couple of
[1:12:54] months or weeks you really H cherish it
[1:12:59] but after a while becomes common to you
[1:13:01] so everything that we strive for
[1:13:04] here um it doesn't last but one thing
[1:13:09] that you always desires more is the
[1:13:12] presence of God when you get to that
[1:13:14] height you can never get to a place as
[1:13:16] oh I'm so full enough I don't need
[1:13:19] that's I fill my cup every day with what
[1:13:21] love every day you need the presence of
[1:13:23] the his presence there's one um Coming
[1:13:27] of the Holy Ghost but there's more what
[1:13:29] in feeling so you need that presence
[1:13:31] every that's the only thing that H you
[1:13:34] cannot it it cannot become common to you
[1:13:38] all the rest we need them don't get me
[1:13:40] wrong we need to get a new house you
[1:13:42] need everything you have to enjoy them
[1:13:45] but that satisfaction doesn't what last
[1:13:49] the only thing that satisfies is God
[1:13:51] himself in human heart that's why David
[1:13:54] says I dear for the water Brook so my
[1:13:56] soul thirst after thee for the Living
[1:14:00] God that's say some place also that um
[1:14:04] um in Psalm Psalm 25 he says that all
[1:14:09] that I desire to be in the the house of
[1:14:11] the Lord that's to dwell in the house of
[1:14:14] the Lord that to live dwell in his
[1:14:16] presence that's why you have the most
[1:14:19] satisfaction that's why you long for and
[1:14:22] the capsule when you reach that love
[1:14:24] that thing nobody can take you there
[1:14:26] it's God himself amen he himself can
[1:14:28] take you there that's why I said that
[1:14:31] when I sh it no one can open when I open
[1:14:36] no one can sh he is the one in control
[1:14:39] all that you have to just leave our life
[1:14:42] commit Our Lives to him and what we have
[1:14:44] to know he's going to let us know at the
[1:14:47] right time and the right time so what
[1:14:49] I'm trying to say even sometimes certain
[1:14:52] things we don't understand just leave
[1:14:55] them alone amen don't fight with the
[1:14:58] scriptures don't fight with those things
[1:15:00] when the time comes for you to know he
[1:15:03] will let you know it amen because our
[1:15:05] God hasn't changed he's the same
[1:15:08] yesterday today and forever amen praise
[1:15:12] our wonderful God am
[1:15:15] hallelujah amen so um I think I'm going
[1:15:18] to
[1:15:19] read um
[1:15:22] okay in the verse 17 said that very very
[1:15:25] I say unto you the many
[1:15:28] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:15:33] to see those things which ye
[1:15:37] see and have not seen them and to hear
[1:15:41] those things which ye hear and have not
[1:15:45] what heard them okay I'm going to take
[1:15:47] it a little bit far back and come over
[1:15:51] there
[1:15:52] um let's go to I think Matthew
[1:15:56] 17 11
[1:16:09] to2 for very
[1:16:11] last
[1:16:13] okay and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:16:16] them El
[1:16:17] Li truly shall first come and restore
[1:16:22] all things but I say unto you that elas
[1:16:25] is come already and they knew him not
[1:16:28] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:16:31] listed likewise us the son of M suff of
[1:16:34] them so this is two coming of elas
[1:16:37] elas John the Baptist is two coming of
[1:16:40] elas one of them was for John the
[1:16:42] Baptist you know when John the Baptist
[1:16:45] came he never restored all things but
[1:16:49] God send us Malachi
[1:16:51] 45 Revelation 10:7 William myON br
[1:16:55] to restore all things he gathered all
[1:16:58] the truth all that the cans has eaten
[1:17:01] the caterpillars and the um and the what
[1:17:05] the cans have eaten the caterpillar has
[1:17:08] eaten the pal and all those God said I
[1:17:11] will restore said the Lord so all the
[1:17:14] missing
[1:17:15] truth after the death of um the Apostle
[1:17:19] John when the church went into the Dark
[1:17:21] Ages God used the prophet of God to
[1:17:25] restore all that missing
[1:17:28] truth so through that the bride of
[1:17:32] Christ the word is presented to us when
[1:17:35] he call you in you have access to all
[1:17:38] those truth that God restored through
[1:17:41] him and
[1:17:43] restoration is to bring something back
[1:17:46] to its original
[1:17:49] estate so like your
[1:17:53] health God created you
[1:17:56] healthy he created you to be healthy and
[1:17:59] strong but the enemy comes and bring you
[1:18:03] this disease bring you that disease and
[1:18:05] say you are this and the doctors giving
[1:18:07] you so many reports you have the
[1:18:10] right and go back to enemy's camp and
[1:18:15] tell him that by Stripes I am healed and
[1:18:19] stand on that promise and put your name
[1:18:21] over there because God gave you that
[1:18:24] promise
[1:18:25] so that disease that sickness has no
[1:18:28] part in you God promis to restore all
[1:18:31] things restoration is restoring this
[1:18:33] flesh too going to restore you so don't
[1:18:36] let the devil push you
[1:18:38] around you got a right to a perfect
[1:18:41] health no matter what the enemy is
[1:18:44] telling you no matter what the doctors
[1:18:45] are telling you yes they are doing their
[1:18:48] job but you can also say by his
[1:18:52] strengths I am healed amen I am healed I
[1:18:57] whole believe it and walk in it and you
[1:19:01] get your health if you have Financial
[1:19:04] Pro above all things are which thou May
[1:19:07] prosper and be in health even as your
[1:19:10] soul also Prospect redemption in three
[1:19:15] parts you have the right to all of them
[1:19:17] let's not focus to only one part god
[1:19:21] send us a former Pastor BR John Simon he
[1:19:25] he he drilled that into our heart don't
[1:19:28] be satisfied wanted Redemption you have
[1:19:31] all three parts redemption in three
[1:19:34] parts receive all the three parts of
[1:19:38] redemption amen so you have the right to
[1:19:43] those healthy life and everything but
[1:19:48] all that God needs from you just like
[1:19:52] job when God blesses him
[1:19:55] his heart was not on those things his
[1:20:00] heart was on God so when the enemy took
[1:20:04] everything away he never cares God
[1:20:08] because he
[1:20:10] was his his his main purpose was to
[1:20:14] please God and I think braam went
[1:20:18] through the same thing
[1:20:21] and when he lost his wife and his
[1:20:25] daughter he wanted to kill
[1:20:28] himself and in his dark
[1:20:30] moment the enemy came and told him all
[1:20:34] kind of lies and he was almost going to
[1:20:38] accept what he said that comes back to
[1:20:40] the predestination seed something rose
[1:20:42] up in him he said who am I I what what
[1:20:46] do I bring in this world we used to
[1:20:49] leave 10 people live in the same house
[1:20:51] God doesn't owe me nothing I didn't
[1:20:53] bring nothing in this word the Lord Give
[1:20:55] the Lord take it blessed be the name of
[1:20:57] the Lord so if those things become
[1:21:00] attached to you then you have power
[1:21:02] because that's why any power with that
[1:21:05] character become satanic but with
[1:21:08] character you can rule amen what God has
[1:21:11] given us
[1:21:12] character by revealing himself to you so
[1:21:16] we know what to do with God's word you
[1:21:18] know what to do with our lives this is
[1:21:21] the time when God blesses us we know how
[1:21:24] to to support his work to support his
[1:21:26] missions to enjoy some for our family
[1:21:29] and use the rest wisely but we are not
[1:21:32] attached to those
[1:21:34] things because we know that God is able
[1:21:39] to do everything and what important he
[1:21:42] has given us eternal life absence from
[1:21:45] here presence with the Lord amen amen
[1:21:48] one of these days we're going to be what
[1:21:52] move over on the other side hey amen
[1:21:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:21:59] forever amen he a consuming fire
[1:22:02] consuming fire amen praise our wonderful
[1:22:06] God our God is good he all the time is a
[1:22:09] wonderful God
[1:22:11] hallelujah praise God hallelujah so and
[1:22:15] another thing
[1:22:17] too Malachi
[1:22:21] 456 was fulfilled in brother Abraham
[1:22:25] Ministry and we are the
[1:22:28] manifestation of that Malachi
[1:22:31] 45 and being that it means that as we
[1:22:35] said that the original church is what
[1:22:38] the continuation of what the book of
[1:22:40] Acts so whatever happens in there over
[1:22:44] there with them God is doing exact same
[1:22:47] thing in your life in my life but we
[1:22:51] only have to be conscious of what God is
[1:22:53] doing because time when you are not
[1:22:55] conscious of it it will bypass
[1:22:58] you God is doing a mighty work in his
[1:23:02] bride the same thing we are not
[1:23:04] different from Peter John and all those
[1:23:07] people they were men that God was living
[1:23:11] inside of them and they did everything
[1:23:14] because God was inside of them and that
[1:23:16] same God that was in Peter that was in
[1:23:19] Paul that was in John that was in
[1:23:21] Matthew that same God is in you and in

[1:38:02] time I
[1:38:04] had someone
[1:38:07] was just um arguing with me about the
[1:38:11] scripture Revelation 108 to 11 I say
[1:38:15] it's a bride Ministry and the guy was so
[1:38:18] angry braah blah blah brah didn't
[1:38:20] explain it

[1:38:25] thinking about it how the people can
[1:38:29] always BR him appreciate things in the
[1:38:33] past and grab it and can talk in the
[1:38:39] future but when the thing is happening
[1:38:41] right in their eyes they can't see it
[1:38:45] because the people in the message they
[1:38:46] feel so good when bra bran preached
[1:38:49] birth pains and then he came and
[1:38:51] preached this day this scripture is
[1:38:54] fulfilled in your eyes he said that
[1:38:58] Jesus in Isaiah 61:1 to2 he didn't
[1:39:03] explain all the verse
[1:39:05] two he only gave them
[1:39:08] 61 verse one and some part of the verse
[1:39:12] two because it wasn't ordained for his
[1:39:17] time so he didn't touch it right so God
[1:39:20] sent us a prophet and being the prophet
[1:39:23] of God the eager eyes he said that I am
[1:39:26] going to what young men will I don't
[1:39:29] have time I'll lay what I'll lay the
[1:39:31] foundation young man will come they take
[1:39:34] this and run with it that young man are
[1:39:37] not going to say anything contrary to
[1:39:38] what he said has to line up with the
[1:39:40] word that he brought and the young man
[1:39:43] could just see and said that oh John
[1:39:45] tyes a bride Revelation 10 never came
[1:39:48] that's not pertain to him it's a bride
[1:39:51] Ministry and the people are still
[1:39:53] fighting the prophet did not explain it
[1:39:55] you want the brother to come back from
[1:39:57] death and explain that to you that is
[1:40:00] what is
[1:40:01] happening that part is for the bride of
[1:40:04] Christ in the
[1:40:06] book it will be sweeter in your mouth
[1:40:08] but bitter in your belly amen he took it

[1:44:44] it over here too they put the veil on
[1:44:48] the on the the the V put the husband put
[1:44:52] it on his shoulders it means that that

[1:45:00] what the Lord say di did for us he came
[1:45:03] to die on Calvary for us he conquered
