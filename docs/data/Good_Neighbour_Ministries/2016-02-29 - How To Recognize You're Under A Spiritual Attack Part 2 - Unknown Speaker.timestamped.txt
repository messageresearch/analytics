[6:40] finds himself on the edge of anxiousness
[6:44] oh God isn't that a big
[6:45] one amen isn't that a big attack that's
[6:49] why they all
[6:51] come every attack of the enemy comes
[6:53] circumstances come oh it's because you
[6:56] know uh the economy went this way and or
[7:00] this happened that way and this person
[7:02] decid to do it that way this way no I'm
[7:04] sorry it's all designed you know that
[7:08] this world there's nothing going on that
[7:12] has a greater purpose in this world but
[7:14] the maturing amen the perfecting of the
[7:17] Bride of Jesus Christ can you understand
[7:20] that you understand what I just said
[7:22] everything evolves around you and me
[7:24] this morning the economy everything all

[7:33] Perfection amen our our Perfection of
[7:36] our faith our rapturing faith our

[7:54] doesn't mean anything else I'm just
[7:56] going to leave it right there you chew
[7:59] on it
[8:00] you put some sauce on it you tenderize
[8:02] it whatever you have to do but that's
[8:04] the truth we need to recognize and
[8:07] realize these things thank you
[8:08] brother
[8:10] Hallelujah confusion about purpose oh
[8:14] God when an attack
[8:16] comes how that throws off remember
[8:19] everything we said from the beginning of
[8:20] the service here how that throws
[8:22] everything out of out of order confusion
[8:25] about our purpose during a spiritual
[8:27] attack is often great confusion about
[8:29] spiritual
[8:31] Direction you know wait upon the
[8:35] Lord he will speak to you he will make
[8:38] it
[8:39] plain and until then just
[8:43] wait don't allow the devil to come in
[8:46] and and give you this direction that
[8:48] dire you know the voice of God you know
[8:50] when he speaks to you when a revelation
[8:53] strikes you you know everything is clear
[8:55] everything falls into place everything
[8:57] works out just perfectly in all order
[8:59] amen that's when God speaks and until
[9:02] then just wait don't allow the devil to
[9:05] confuse your mind make your mind
[9:08] double-minded and then confuse you by
[9:10] your position amen and the Order of the
[9:13] spirit of God in your life just wait
[9:16] upon the Lord trust in him he gave you
[9:20] this step he'll give you that step he'll
[9:22] give you this step he'll lead you right
[9:25] up he promis
[9:28] that
[9:30] faith is a great thing
[9:32] Saints faith in this is great because
[9:35] people don't see this show me this
[9:38] Rapture show me this perfect Faith show
[9:42] me this this this
[9:44] Jesus that was resurrected in our day
[9:48] show me this I can't it's got to be
[9:51] revealed to you but I believe all this
[9:54] amen I believe all this you know I got
[9:57] to get to a place you got to get to a
[9:58] place place in your walk whether it
[10:00] happens or not that you'll die for this
[10:03] I wonder like the church in Africa there
[10:05] believe is Africa forgive me if I'm
[10:07] wrong that uh it got under attack 50
[10:10] people stood out of thousands of the 50
[10:14] people stood and were willing to give
[10:15] their lives for this message this
[10:18] word are you ready you're not going to
[10:21] be ready you're not going to be at that
[10:24] position I don't care how many times you
[10:26] attend church I don't care how many
[10:28] years you've been coming to this
[10:29] ministry you're not going to be ready if
[10:31] you're not in this amen if you're not
[10:33] fighting you're not overcoming amen
[10:39] hallelujah what an hour what an hour
[10:43] feeling overwhelmed in
[10:45] helplessness you are over you are
[10:47] feeling overwhelmed by circumstances
[10:49] this could be a sign that you're under
[10:51] attack the worst circumstance comes from
[10:54] two words cir in circle stand stance
[10:59] stand in circle stand in other words you
[11:04] are standing in circle by what's going
[11:08] on think about
[11:11] it it doesn't take long for you feeling
[11:14] being overwhelmed and led into
[11:16] hopelessness the Bible says hope the
[11:18] first makes the heart sick Proverbs
[11:21] 13:12 it also tells us Fai faith is the
[11:25] substance of things hoped for the
[11:27] evidence things of things not Hebrews
[11:30] 11:1 if the enemy can get you to lose
[11:33] hope think about it he can get you to
[11:36] stop living by faith that's right put
[11:39] the two scriptures together and you
[11:42] see hope my hope is in the
[11:47] Lord number six lack of peace the enemy
[11:52] bombards us the mind with various
[11:55] thoughts and ongoing Temptations in
[11:57] order to Rob our Rob our peace the Mind
[11:59] becomes IR irritated and exhausted oh
[12:07] oh
[12:10] oh you feel
[12:12] that man the enemy does all he can do to
[12:16] bring mental
[12:18] fatigue isn't that didn't brother Brown

[21:05] is is is is taking the word of God in
[21:07] your position recognizing who you are
[21:09] and speaking the word of God prayer life
[21:12] is is commanding these things to take

[40:07] way we should
[40:08] be
[40:10] amen for if the seed be planted by the
[40:14] water it will rise again here it is the
[40:17] secret of this the word is in the bride
[40:19] as it was in Mary the bride has the mind
[40:23] of
[40:25] Christ
[40:27] for she knows what to do what he wants
[40:29] done with the
[40:32] word she performs the command of the
[40:35] word of
[40:36] God in his name for she has thus say the
[40:40] Lord amen I hope this is making
[40:43] sense then the word is quickened by the
[40:46] spirit and it comes to
[40:49] pass like a seed that is planted and
[40:52] watered becomes the full Harvest servant
[40:55] is purpose
[40:57] that's come
[40:58] musicians those in the bride will only
[41:00] do his
[41:02] will no one can make her do
[41:04] otherwise no no devil can make her do
[41:07] otherwise those in a
[41:09] bride
[41:11] amen they have thus saved the Lord or
[41:15] they keep still they know that it has to
[41:18] be God in them doing the works
[41:20] fulfilling his own
[41:22] word he did not complete all his work
[41:25] while he was here in his Earthly
[41:27] Ministry now he his works and and
[41:31] through the bride now he's working
[41:33] through the bride she knows that for it
[41:37] was not yet time for him to do certain
[41:39] things that must be done
[41:43] now but now but he will now fulfill
[41:48] through the bride that work which he
[41:50] left for a specific
[41:54] time amen
[41:58] you know Saints I came across this story
[42:01] here I want to say just
[42:08] quickly you know palm
[42:12] trees you know that we're type of trees
[42:14] right no even there the tree of the
[42:16] garden we know it wasn't fruit or
[42:18] nothing trees we we type people are
[42:20] types of trees right and pond trees you
[42:23] know that they go 70 ft up in the air
[42:29] but they also go 300 ft under the ground
[42:31] wow so that when the storm
[42:35] comes I mean it's common sense right the
[42:38] roots are so
[42:39] deep that it anchors and the palm trees
[42:42] sways and sways and it's able to Bear
[42:44] the storm and some people are deeply
[42:48] rooted in the
[42:52] word but there's also redwood trees
[42:58] you know they go 300 ft up in the
[43:01] air but you know they only go 3 feet
[43:05] down how can a tree one go 70 ft up in
[43:09] the air 300 ft down that makes sense to
[43:14] me right it'll hold through the storms
[43:18] but one tree goes 300 feet up in the air
[43:20] and only 3 ft
[43:22] down but see the key to this that I came
[43:26] came
[43:27] across is that the roots go out and they
[43:30] spread out for miles and miles and the
[43:34] roots of every Redwood joins themselves
[43:38] together and they
[43:40] interwine each other and they hold each
[43:42] other like
[43:43] this together oh they only go 3 fet down
[43:47] they're all joined together for miles
[43:50] and miles every tree Redwood joins
[43:54] itself they find each other they seek
[43:56] each other's out their roots and they go
[43:58] and they join together they hold
[44:01] together what's the scripture say about
[44:03] a Yol being broken not easily broken
[44:05] when two when one walks alone but when
[44:07] two walks
[44:09] together when we join ourselves together
[44:12] you know even a redwood even if it
[44:15] Dives they can go into the forest and
[44:18] they'll go and they'll look and they'll
[44:19] see a redwood dead but it still be
[44:21] standing you know why because the other
[44:24] red Woods won't let him go amen
[44:26] holds on to them amen and that's the way
[44:29] we should be in the body of Jesus Christ
[44:31] not individually amen only rooted to
[44:35] yourself but rooted together in love
[44:38] join together amen when this Army this F
[44:42] comes together like that and don't let
[44:44] each other's hold hold on to each other
[44:47] pray for one another when you go to a
[44:49] struggle when you go to a problem in
[44:50] your life in your marriage in your home
[44:53] with your kids the struggles that we're
[44:54] going don't criticize join together in
[44:58] prayer join together with your brother
[45:00] and
[45:01] sister and even if you see that they're
[45:04] dying hold them
[45:06] up have faith and hold them
[45:10] up like the trees they won't let it go
[45:12] you're not dead you're going to come
