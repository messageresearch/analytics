[32:38] that our faith
[32:40] our
[32:42] understanding of the word
[32:44] attracts your attention
[32:47] and brings you on the scene
[32:49] you come on the scene
[32:51] because you see something in us
[32:55] a deposit that was made there beyond the

[33:22] taste and see that the lord is good
[33:26] supernatural taste
[33:30] you can't even taste this bread
[33:33] or this word you can't taste it the way
[33:37] it should be tasted
[33:39] unless you have a revelation of it
[33:44] you may read it you may on you may read
[33:46] your bible you may listen to it it may
[33:49] even taste reasonably good to you but
[33:52] the bible says in proverbs that it's
[33:55] like honey in a honeycomb
[33:59] and so
[34:00] taste and see
[34:02] if you have
[34:03] that ability to taste
[34:05] taste and see
[34:07] that the lord is good i want you to
[34:09] notice i'm talking just on the scripture
[34:11] now uh
[34:12] it says taste and after you taste and
[34:15] you appreciate it then you will begin to
[34:18] be able to see
[34:21] test and see
[34:24] that the lord is good isn't that
[34:26] wonderful
[34:28] i came into this wonderful faith and i
[34:31] began to taste little morsels here and
[34:34] there little pieces here and there and
[34:37] it all was just enjoyable and wonderful
[34:40] all the peppermint all the lollipops all
[34:44] the
[34:45] you know
[34:46] cakes they cross onesie
[34:49] whatever
[34:50] chased them they were really good praise
[34:54] the lord god bless you all i i'm pausing
[34:58] in the middle of this because i want to
[34:59] thank god i thought about you and i was
[35:02] thinking about you when i'm leaving home
[35:04] and here you are so you're in the will
[35:07] of god and we thank god for that praise
[35:09] the name of the lord we all in the will
[35:11] of god but i'm just telling you
[35:13] specifically i thought about them and
[35:16] here they are in the house of the lord
[35:19] praise the lord god bless you real good
[35:23] amen
[35:24] taste and see
[35:26] so you see so what this is i want you to
[35:30] see that
[35:31] the lord's supper uh is a supernatural
[35:35] meal
[35:37] because you may eat the emblems drink
[35:40] the emblems
[35:41] without a clear full understanding
[35:44] and the
[35:46] effects that it should have in your life
[35:49] would really take place like they should
[35:52] because you don't uh have a clear
[35:54] understanding as you know some take it
[35:57] by tradition
[36:00] others take it because the father the
[36:02] grandfather and so on took it before
[36:05] them
[36:06] but we are here my friends
[36:09] not for uh
[36:10] you know let me go back tradition
[36:14] i remember being when i was young
[36:18] uh good fridays is famous for a little
[36:21] bit of rain falling
[36:22] and sometimes
[36:24] thunderstorms and the people would come
[36:27] out and say oh
[36:28] god is crying for his son
[36:32] because the streets are filled with
[36:34] water
[36:35] it's the tears of god coming down upon
[36:38] us
[36:38] you see my friends but we are not here
[36:41] to mourn on good friday
[36:45] when he went to the cross we are not
[36:48] here to to cry that jesus went to the
[36:52] cross
[36:53] we are not here to emphasize uh the
[36:57] sufferings of jesus christ
[37:00] we are here my friends for a celebration
[37:05] of that life that he lived and that he
[37:08] imparted unto us
[37:10] that we can give that glory unto his
[37:14] great name
[37:16] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[37:18] lord
[37:19] oh thank god not only is it a
[37:21] supernatural meal
[37:23] but i want you to know it's a holy meal
[37:27] it's bread like any other bread but yes
[37:31] this is different
[37:33] it's wine the same wine that the sinners
[37:36] may drink out there but yet this is
[37:39] different
[37:41] because when you eat this bread you eat
[37:44] it with a revelation when you drink this
[37:46] wine you drink it with a revelation a
[37:49] full understanding that as that liquid
[37:53] courses down into your being you are
[37:56] saying lord as i receive this and i
[37:59] accept this in my body may your spirit
[38:02] come into my life may your blood purify
[38:07] my blood may your life empower my life
[38:10] oh praise god may the resurrection
[38:13] spirit that is in you come upon me and
[38:16] raise me up to that land where i belong
[38:20] praise god hallelujah amen praise god so
[38:24] we're glad
[38:27] that we come to this
[38:29] great meal in the presence of god
[38:33] which is really the center of our faith
[38:37] it's the central point because he says
[38:40] remember this always
[38:42] and do it as often as you can so that it
[38:47] will never leave your thoughts
[38:50] so keep it at the center
[38:53] of your faith or of your revelation
[38:56] of of how he became
[38:59] the central point and focus and
[39:01] culmination of all of the subs all of
[39:06] this
[39:07] symbols
[39:09] and types
[39:10] and shadows
[39:12] of the old testament
[39:15] are all fulfilled in him
[39:18] praise god and he's saying you you
[39:21] remember that
[39:23] every one of those things from the
[39:25] priests of the garments of the priest
[39:28] the the temple the the things in the
[39:31] temple even the curtains in the temple
[39:33] was him everything about that was him
[39:37] and when we come right to the end we
[39:40] must remember it's all about him praise
[39:45] god forevermore so he is the center of
[39:48] our faith he is the wheel in the middle
[39:52] of the wheel
[39:54] praise god hallelujah but not only is he
[39:58] the center of our faith my friends he is
[40:01] the circle of our faith
[40:04] and that circle is the circle of
[40:07] fellowship that we are involved
[40:10] hallelujah the sackle of our fellowship
[40:14] with fellow believers
[40:16] regardless of your preferences
[40:20] and i mean one may love coffee one don't
[40:22] want coffee your next one wants only tea
[40:25] and one just don't want ordinary i only
[40:27] drink peppermint and salt regardless of
[40:31] your preferences
[40:33] hallelujah paul's as paul was saying all
[40:36] this stuff we've been delivered from
[40:38] worrying about new moon and full moon
[40:41] and worrying about days and weeks and
[40:44] and legalistic about lesser about that
[40:48] amen praise god our face rests upon the
[40:52] word of god we are not moved by the
[40:54] things on the outside of us we are
[40:57] called to live our individual
[41:00] personal lives within the confines of
[41:03] god's word hallelujah the way you live
[41:07] it may be different from me as long as
[41:09] you have the same faith same revelation
[41:13] same god same christ same baptism same
[41:17] spirit then god will always honor that
[41:20] blessed be his name
[41:23] hallelujah
[41:25] god don't care about your personal
[41:27] preference
[41:29] hallelujah
[41:30] god doesn't care about such things
[41:33] brother doesn't care about how you
[41:36] worship in the sense of one may shout
[41:38] and one may quietly uh worship god and
[41:42] one may scream it one may dance one
[41:45] might
[41:46] just reach out within their heart
[41:48] hallelujah amen god is not so much
[41:52] interested in that whatsoever he is not
[41:56] interested in your class
[42:00] he has nothing not interested in our
[42:02] racial distinctions
[42:05] god is not interested in such a thing
[42:08] amen because like the badger skins in
[42:11] the temple he just put the priests
[42:13] behind there those skins to carry out
[42:17] their mission behind the veil
[42:20] and so are we to call to carry out our
[42:24] mission here upon this earth
[42:26] behind the veil
[42:28] your veil will be back your skin gold
[42:31] skin sheep skin the colors might be
[42:34] different but it's god in your skin god
[42:38] behind your skin
[42:39] god manifesting his word and declaring
[42:42] himself blessed be the name of the lord
[42:45] hallelujah
[42:47] amen so the lord supper
[42:51] is the center also of time
[42:55] a b c and a d
[42:57] he is right in the middle of it
[42:59] hallelujah he is the center and circle
[43:03] of our fellowship and we give him glory
[43:07] for him

[43:14] grandmother to
[43:16] the lord's supper

[44:45] but when you think of it friends

[50:29] the lord whether it's in a house or in a
[50:31] cave or in a whatever like that they
[50:34] kept the lord supper

[50:38] a tradition of anything like that my
[50:42] friends but they kept it and somewhere
[50:45] somebody kept on keeping the lord's

[57:18] comes to that knit taking away the lord
[57:20] or take try to command you to get away

[58:14] gathered with us around the world
[58:17] the world because of sickness

[58:28] the world
[58:29] around us
[58:32] we are sorry they're not here
[58:35] but let us
[58:36] remember them
[58:39] remember jesus is that right
[58:42] but remember jesus is not just a head
[58:45] he's a body
[58:46] so remember those of his body that are
[58:50] not here tonight
[58:52] praise the lord your brothers and
[58:54] sisters wherever you are whoever you are
[58:57] we remember you tonight
[59:00] and may the grace of god be upon you and

[1:01:57] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:02:02] that whosoever believeth

[1:02:52] life down here
[1:02:55] to be here like that amen praise god so
[1:02:59] my friends
[1:03:01] thank god
[1:03:03] that we can celebrate this lord's supper
[1:03:08] and that by celebrating the lord's
[1:03:11] supper of course we are celebrating our
[1:03:13] salvation and our redemption too because
[1:03:17] remember
[1:03:18] this redemption has given every one of
[1:03:21] us
[1:03:22] a new beginning
[1:03:24] is that right it has given us a new
[1:03:26] beginning and i'm glad to have a new
[1:03:30] beginning
[1:03:31] out of this wonderful
[1:03:34] new life that he has given to us so this
[1:03:38] is not a funeral
[1:03:42] this is not where we all come to church
[1:03:44] wearing black clothes
[1:03:47] or wearing black veils and all kinds of
[1:03:50] stuff and seeing who can out cry or out
[1:03:54] mourn the rest of the people in the
[1:03:56] church
[1:03:58] this is we haven't come together to get
[1:04:01] little weapons and little things to
[1:04:03] flagellate ourselves
[1:04:05] you know of lashing our bodies and blood
[1:04:08] bleeding and everything else because
[1:04:10] you're suffering for the lord
[1:04:13] no
[1:04:13] he said i suffered that you may not
[1:04:20] i
[1:04:21] live without a house that you might have
[1:04:23] a house
[1:04:24] i became poor
[1:04:27] that you might become rich
[1:04:30] is that right
[1:04:32] he did all that
[1:04:34] because of us
[1:04:36] but
[1:04:37] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:04:41] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:04:44] the chastisement of his peace was upon
[1:04:47] us and by his traps we are healed
[1:04:52] oh peace god be healed if you believe
[1:04:56] the word of god right now
[1:04:58] trust him believe him and receive
[1:05:02] his wonderful embrace of his word praise
[1:05:05] god forevermore
[1:05:07] celebration that we are here praise god
[1:05:11] i want to tell you we ain't warning here
[1:05:13] i don't know if anybody's here mourning
[1:05:15] jesus dying on the cross
[1:05:18] because brother sister all the mourning
[1:05:21] on the grieving took place three days
[1:05:24] from the time he died
[1:05:26] until his resurrection
[1:05:30] that's all the morning
[1:05:32] that took place
[1:05:33] and that morning was because of lack of
[1:05:37] understanding
[1:05:39] but if they knew
[1:05:41] why he went to the cross what was his
[1:05:44] all about the effects of the world the
[1:05:46] power of its testimony the mission that
[1:05:49] he came to declare the father's name a
[1:05:52] mission to die or praise god they would
[1:05:55] have been rejoicing even before the
[1:05:58] upper room but god had it that way until
[1:06:02] the death pentecost then the holy ghost
[1:06:05] fell praise god and revealed to them why
[1:06:08] he did these things oh praise god
[1:06:11] forevermore i tell you the mourning and
[1:06:14] the grieving lasted for three days
[1:06:18] praise god but then walked up from the
[1:06:21] grave he arose when a mighty triumph
[1:06:24] is full amen yes sir it was
[1:06:28] victory time for them hallelujah they
[1:06:31] have victory praise god forevermore we
[1:06:34] celebrate the resurrection and we
[1:06:37] celebrate that that life
[1:06:41] as i said he is life
[1:06:44] is that right and because he is life he
[1:06:47] alone has the power to give life
[1:06:52] praise god
[1:06:54] and
[1:06:55] because he rolls
[1:06:59] on easter morn
[1:07:01] he's proving
[1:07:03] that he has overcome death
[1:07:06] death cannot could not conquer him
[1:07:09] and he is telling you that he is the
[1:07:12] victor
[1:07:13] he is telling you he is the mighty
[1:07:15] conqueror
[1:07:17] because death is under his feet amen but
[1:07:20] then we are his children
[1:07:23] we may not fully realize all the powers
[1:07:26] that reside within us
[1:07:28] but as we come into a conscious
[1:07:30] realization through the personalization
[1:07:34] of the word making itself manifest then
[1:07:37] we will be able to make manifest not
[1:07:40] only the graces and the sweetness of the
[1:07:44] statue but the power of the word flowing
[1:07:48] through the body bringing glory to our
[1:07:50] father's name what a wonderful blessed
[1:07:53] time we're living in oh praise god
[1:07:56] forevermore i thank god for victory paul
[1:08:00] said thanks be
[1:08:02] unto god
[1:08:04] who gives us the victory
[1:08:07] through our lord jesus christ
[1:08:09] thanks be unto god who gives us the
[1:08:12] power to overcome
[1:08:14] through our lord jesus christ that's how
[1:08:17] we overcome all your troubles all the
[1:08:20] trials all your circumstances all what
[1:08:23] seems to be impossible to you

[1:09:23] them into an atmosphere i'm bringing
[1:09:26] them into a presence and bringing them

[1:09:58] giving glory to the name of jesus as i
[1:10:02] wind this portion
[1:10:04] of my talk up and allowing the brothers
[1:10:08] enough time to prepare
[1:10:11] be prepared for the lord's supper here
[1:10:16] we know that before we had the bread and
[1:10:20] wine the lord's supper
[1:10:22] long before this
[1:10:24] the passover
[1:10:26] was instituted
[1:10:28] and moses
[1:10:31] incidentally was not incidentally
[1:10:34] moses was the prophet
[1:10:39] he was the one that brought them the
[1:10:42] word of god
[1:10:44] that you are to stay in your house
[1:10:47] and people don't like to hear words like
[1:10:50] that stay in your house
[1:10:52] this is not coveted i'm talking about
[1:10:57] i'm just talking about back there in
[1:10:59] egypt because it was their life you stay
[1:11:03] in your house
[1:11:05] and you stay there and place the the
[1:11:09] mark of the blood upon the door praise
[1:11:12] god and when the dead angel passes
[1:11:16] he sees the blood
[1:11:18] he'll pass over you
[1:11:20] praise god
[1:11:22] that's another thought
[1:11:24] when he sees the blood
[1:11:26] not the chemicals there
[1:11:29] because the life is in the blood
[1:11:31] and so on praise god but my brother's
[1:11:34] sister
[1:11:35] that was a time
[1:11:38] of deliverance
[1:11:39] for god's people it was a wonderful time
[1:11:42] of deliverance
[1:11:44] and now we have come to the fulfillment
[1:11:47] and the fullness of it all
[1:11:51] this is time not for the first exodus
[1:11:54] this is time for the final last exodus
[1:11:59] of god's people out of egypt's land out
[1:12:04] of babylon out of strife out of torment
[1:12:08] out of sickness out of trouble this is
[1:12:12] our deliverance time our time out of
[1:12:14] every form of bondage hallelujah praise
[1:12:18] god so we want to celebrate our
[1:12:23] deliverance
[1:12:25] hallelujah not look back to that
[1:12:28] that uh uh
[1:12:30] exodus then but we are looking forward
[1:12:33] to a rapture
[1:12:35] there's a rapture in progress
[1:12:38] and the fullness of that rapture
[1:12:40] attained upon us
[1:12:43] oh
[1:12:44] every day
[1:12:45] we sense
[1:12:47] the
[1:12:48] presence and coming of the lord
[1:12:51] and i end with my thought here again
[1:12:54] taste and see
[1:12:56] that the lord is good
[1:12:58] hallelujah
[1:13:00] he delivered us from sin
[1:13:02] he delivered us from sickness
[1:13:05] he delivered us from every possible
[1:13:07] habit every bondage that the devil would
[1:13:10] have tried to put upon us
[1:13:13] we want to thank god hallelujah
[1:13:16] that we
[1:13:17] are being delivered
[1:13:19] and now we can just give
[1:13:22] a temporary celebration
[1:13:24] until we go to the real celebration
[1:13:28] in the skies
[1:13:30] where we have the lord's supper
[1:13:32] around the lord's table praise god
[1:13:36] i don't know if it's gonna be bread and
[1:13:38] wine anymore because we're not we won't
[1:13:41] be on the symbols no more
[1:13:43] right
[1:13:44] you see i don't want to go there no
[1:13:46] because i'm going to go off into
[1:13:47] something else but
[1:13:49] remember
[1:13:51] we passed the time of symbols
[1:13:53] so when you go into the law into the
[1:13:55] presence of the lord for that supper
[1:13:58] i don't know if it's going to be wine
[1:14:00] and bread
[1:14:02] because the symbols
[1:14:04] are gone
[1:14:06] so what is it
[1:14:08] think about it
[1:14:10] amen it will be a feast but feast of
[1:14:12] what frisk
[1:14:17] thank god
[1:14:18] every true child of god has been
[1:14:21] delivered from bondage
[1:14:23] and now
[1:14:24] we can taste
[1:14:26] eternal life
[1:14:30] and this
[1:14:31] lord's supper
[1:14:33] is always a reminder to his children
[1:14:36] to remember
[1:14:38] nothing can keep you or hold you here
[1:14:40] this is just temporary
[1:14:43] amen
[1:14:44] taste and see
[1:14:46] that the lord is good
[1:14:48] and when you recognize what peter was
[1:14:50] trying to say
[1:14:52] that you have been blessed that you were
[1:14:54] one that was literally
[1:14:57] set up
[1:14:58] hand-picked
[1:15:00] chosen
[1:15:01] and elected by god
[1:15:04] from all the millions billions in the
[1:15:06] world
[1:15:08] just like how he looked upon the whole
[1:15:11] world and one virgin caught his
[1:15:13] attention
[1:15:15] is that right
[1:15:16] he's looked again
[1:15:18] and now when he looked what does he see
[1:15:20] an elected few
[1:15:23] praise god that's why brother branham
[1:15:25] said you you should rejoice one in a
[1:15:28] million
[1:15:28] oh my god saw what was in you praise god
[1:15:34] so brothers and sisters let us rejoice
[1:15:37] and praise god tonight and as we take
[1:15:40] this lord's supper take it with reality
[1:15:44] take with good conviction
[1:15:47] take it with confidence
[1:15:49] and may god keeps this wonderful circle
[1:15:53] together

[1:15:58] that when he comes again
