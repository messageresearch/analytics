TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings to all my dear brothers and sisters in christ wherever you are may the lord bless you and shower down upon you his wonderful marvelous riches of his grace and mercy peace be unto you and the love of god through our lord jesus christ uh tonight i would love to speak on the topic of the rebirth of leodisia and may be a blessing to your hearts and souls last week of course we introduced this church age this subject of leo disier giving uh an outline of some of the thoughts and things that we would touch on of course we're just starting to go a little deeper but this week this wednesday this night we will speak on the topic of read the rebirth of leodicia may the lord bless us together our scripture is revelation chapter 3 verses 14 to 22 and unto the angel of the church of the leodysians right these things said the amen and faithful and true the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that the word cold or hot so then because the work lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because they'll say yes i'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and noise thou not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou must be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i self that thou may see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock and if any men hear my voice and opens the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcome it will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith on to the churches dear lord as we approach thee tonight we thank you for this wonderful privilege may the great holy spirit bless us together as we uh us thinking men and women pass through the filter of the blood may we think on these things putting our thoughts upon the things above and not being distracted by these things of earth and lord as we walk and talk and live for thee demonstrating and manifesting the word of the hour may you receive all the glory and the praise in the name of jesus christ our dear lord amen and amen as we said last week the name leodisia is a woman's name it was a commonplace name of women of that time it also means people's rights which was a very common thing in that day to have people wanting their their rights to their self uh that speaks of a day of selfishness of course and now we find that this name laodicea was a name of desire a name of honor rich um high born women all wanted to have that name something that others can look up to and admire when their names were called out as leo dcl this city my friends the city was the city of theopolis which is to say the city of zeus the god zeus it was a city of politics it was filled with a lot of political intrigue a lot of uh political importance was in the fabric of this city it was also a financial center it was a financially prosperous city it was a city admired by other cities as such it was an influential city it's influence was very far reaching in those days and times in which they live and as a financially flourishing city it attracted uh the richest the best the most dignified to that to live and dwell in that city it was also noted that this city of laodicea uh was a city filled with philanthropists a lot of went on and let me make a pause here because what i i desire to show uh with this message to you is the similarity between leodisia back then and our age of laodicea now so that we can uh focus on the parallels and these various similarities that we will find as we continue it was a city filled with philanthropists they had grown rich swelling with goods and so to satiate their uh sordid consciences that it would give them a better religious feeling uh i'm a good man i'm a good woman i'm a good person look i fed thousands of poor right look i've clothed thousands of of these needy uh look i've done this i've done that but they failed to realize this was the cry of the spirit against thou this age thou says thou art rich thou says i'm going prosperous every day i'm increased with goods but north down not miserable you're naked blind you don't even know it because you'll argue against that fact of course my eyes are wide open i know what's going on i know what's happening and you are blind and noise though not what a tragedy it's something for one to be blind and know it uh it's another thing to be blind and don't know it or blind and resistant to help blind walking to a a chasm a gulf walking to to your death and someone tries to tell you no don't go that way you're going to go over the cliff say oh no i'm seeing my way i know where i'm going and i don't need any help and shake off whatever i help you maybe uh that's what the spirit is referring to the attitude of the age in which we live blind miserable naked and don't even know it oh may god help us everyone in this age in which we live i want you to see also this city of lyodisia was a city of great medical schools great medical accomplishments and you must recognize we have the same thing in our day our times it was a seat my friends of all these great medical schools and as such it was a very distinguished city very much so and it was further distinguished for its arts and its various sciences it taught sciences now back then the word science used was also synonymous with magic because back then they taught a lot of magic alchemy and different things to various folks and that was that was thought or acceptable at that time as science now of course it's evolved and now we just use the word science like i'm using the word the terminology of magic towards because some of the accomplishments were thought through superstition to be magic and that human accomplishment so we must understand that evolution from magic to now we call it science and how it moved on from that time to this time in which we live now despite all of these wonderful things about this city that made it so fabulous and distinguished and influential this was a city who was constantly uh being uh let me let me say it was prone to earth earthquakes they often had earthquakes in that city of laodicea buildings shook architecture shook er capital building shook because they were having earthquakes after a while they become immune uh inured to earthquakes in other words they become um you so used to it that that they were just oh it's another earthquake it just shakes it'll go away another earthquake it just shakes but one day my friends i tell you the god who has allowed a lot of shaking to go on my friends it's going to shake this world one more time now this city of laodicea constantly being shaken by earthquakes it became such a city of fear misery constantly on the alert of how to escape a dangerous deadly sudden earthquake that would strike the city and after a while folks couldn't take it any longer and so they started an outward migration from this great city of laodicea they couldn't take it anymore too much fair too much uh misery uh mental problems uh and so they started to leave the great city of leodisia no wonder the scripture says how are the mighty fallen because what happened is that city became a ghost town it be a ghost city it was abundant by those who indwelted and became a habitation of buzzards hawks foul birds and every snakes rats and wild animals for no one lived there anymore it was completely abundant oh my friends i believe the character and nature of that city is so fitting that we ought to focus on these similarities and how it applies to our day and to our time their chief god as i mentioned was zias who was called the father of all gods the father of the gods all other so-called gods descended from him and he was the only one that could bring them together as the great father oh what a spiritual forecast for our age of this 20th century and of this idea that is floating in the atmosphere around us one god the father of us all oh and the father of all religions you may call him this the other one may call him that you may call him by different names but yet it's really one god and you have a right to call him whatever name you want to call him this one has a right to call him by whatever name they want to call him but it all comes down to no matter how we approach him it's just many rivers of religion leading to the one god the ocean of all knowledge this is the this is what is being said and taught this these are some of the ideas that are being floated to uh captivate the minds and imaginations of the people and to ensnare them into this uh one united church so-called that is already on its way oh one one religion to be on the face of the earth yes they speak of the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man yet they don't know who god is the generalization of god which only means any object of worship is a god so they say oh god so you're just saying object of worship but when you come to the fact what is the name of that god and our bible our scriptures tell us his name shall be called jesus for he shall save his people from their sins no they don't want to hear that they'll have any other name but not that name of jesus that honorable name that lovely name that wonderful name that powerful name that all conquering name they want nothing to do with it but they'll take any other name my friends nothing but demons behind such a move of one world church that would not have the name of jesus and what even in prison would stop you from speaking or living the way god wants you to live no matter how religious how legal lawful or whatever it makes itself it's really satan behind the scenes manipulating his puppets to bring about this kind of scenario yes when they talk about the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man then they said say this is the only thing that will bring together catholics and protestants this is the only thing that will bring together jews hindus mohammedans baha'u'llah jehovah witnesses baptists pentecostals everybody everywhere dancing to the same tune and on the same dance floor one father god the brotherhood of man and developing out of that uh go that that pot uh that witch's brew of so-called religion contrary to the word of god they want to say out of this they will be able to formulate a mutually acceptable form and way of worship that everybody despite their differences can rejoice and shout and sing and praise their god oh my friends and their field oh this way it will increase our love for each other it will increase our understanding for each other if we go this way of mutual love mutual respect nobody talk about anybody else nobody find fault with anybody else nobody will be able to say oh this is different no because that would not be according to them will not be right when the true sons and daughters of god were sent down here with the express purpose to separate right from wrong light from darkness truth from era back to the word back to the promise of our day and time when all sacredness and sincerity seems to have gone away we need to come back to the original faith where the holy spirit has a hold of our lives amen yes sir and we find friends right now many catholics and protestants many prominent catholics many prominent protestant evangelical preachers and religious princes of the church personalities are uh going hand in hand in hand down this road a brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of god and striving for that kind of religious unity and they are gaining ground with the motive my friends with this great motive in front of them that they will produce something that others will follow in the way that they go and this attitude is now being seen to be projected in and through what we know as the united nations yes and when world leaders are refusing to see different concepts and ideas about spiritual worship and all of them are beginning to come coming around to recognizing and recommending that all religions become leveled no difference because after all they're worshipping one god like in leodisia they believe in worshiping the same god zeus and all the other so-called gods are minor gods to him so they need to all worship him so so this is what is repeating in our time that leaders are starting to see their opportunities for control of their peoples by coming to this idea of one religion instead of having a confusion of thousands of various religions that they have to contend with if they have a state religion and of course this is in the laboratory in certain countries right now where certain countries already have established their state religion and any other religion that tries to come against that will be severely punished oh my friends look to the word of god our answers are in the word of god the prophecy and the word of god modern events being made clear by vindicated prophecy in our day and time yes so they believe if all the religions now this is happening now it's starting to happen it's on the cover but soon this will be in the public right that they will want to level all religions into one so they only have one major religion to fund to talk with the leaders and decide things with one religion rather than having uh thousands of them they prefer to deal with one and they're striving and working to that end so that they may have all the same purposes and we will look at all these religions being right because they are all serving this one god father of us all well this age of ledecia as the city of leodisia back then is an age of civil rights it's an age uh pervaded by uh a lot of selfishness a lot of unions a lot of everyone wants their rights regardless of who they are they're claiming their rights and not looking at how it affects other people's rights as long as they have their way and their rights of course people's rights also means justice for the people they're demanding justice for the people yes oh what a discussion that it would be if we were to discuss that and there never been an age like this age there's never been a century like this century that we are in all the nations are now rising up all nations all races all people rising up crying out for their liberty crying out for equality where they're looking to ah a beautiful golden age where all men will be really and truly equal but all that is my friend is the cry of the human heart for that but while you're on this earth you'll not have that real equality they may have it on paper they may have it in beautiful speeches songs and poetry but it will never occur here on the earth oh man will strive mind will fight man will do everything to bring it about but it will never happen while we are here with this wicked sinful perverted human hearts might turn away from god and the way of of the bible back to the word back to god's way amen back to the life and and teaching of jesus christ live the life of christ may he come into your heart forgive you of your sins cleanse you of your past and accept you into his kingdom where we can serve him with all our hearts and our lives oh yes they're demanding equality and they're demanding it socially and demanding it financially these things of course are things that i'm speaking on that have been already prophesied by william marion branham the prophet of this 20th century that people will be seeking financial equality social equality and the cry will be everywhere around the world oh oh my friends here we see it it's not they'll only have the equality and theory but they're not really going to have it in fact while we are here up on the earth oh this is an age also of a lot of politic politics and political disturbance because every party every group is seeking their rights and they'll use the the glove or the mask of uh political parties to be behind that and manipulate the fingers to create whatever uh world they think we should be living in and this is the reason in this age people are calling themselves oh we're christian democrats democratic but we're christian then others will say we are republican christians everybody's a christian social democratic christians like that and and we are also christian socialists and christian conservatives and christian liberals everything is mixed in uh all the iron the clay and everything is mixed in christian uh along that way my friends there it is and according to our liberal theologians some of them are trying to pull people into what is known as socialism and they take the very scriptures and teach that jesus was a socialist and that he practiced socialism and that the early church had all things in common so they were also socialists and we ought to be that way today what they continue to fail to understand that may be a very good and golden concept but it is only a concept now because with the perverted wicked human heart that will never be accomplished on this earth until the prince of peace comes jesus christ himself they'll cry peace peace peace there'll be no peace until jesus christ the prince of peace comes yes my friends oh i tell you friends the city of laodicea was a metropolis lots of people today think new york california tokyo mexico city their great metropolis says you know uh millions of people look they had metropolises way back in those days i stood on a mountain and watched the extent of the city of pompeii in italy it's not all been excavated but as far as your eyes could see houzz's house it was a metropolis and there were many other metropolises in those days there is nothing new under the sun the buildings may change the clothing may change up our of our language our terminologies and everything else what seem crude then we may do it in a more refined way we nothing new under the sunset solomon the wisest man that has ever lived a metropolis that had a one father god of us all government which was a forecast of what was going to come in this age with the similar attitude nature and spirit of one god ecumenical religion in the day in which we live now this that city is being uh gathered together again in spirit by great church councils great councils are meeting in their robes and in their riches discussing about this brotherhood fatherhood of god and brotherhood of man and and singing we are all brothers because jesus prayed let them be one as thou we i and you are one oh my friends that is the cry oh but i tell you we're seeing the binding together of the tears and the wheat all it's going on right now protestants catholics and everything else is coming together and the bundles are being bound together getting ready some for the harvest and some for the burning that lies ahead oh those of us were real believers real christian get ready it's harvest time it's harvest time the savior's crawling and the grain is falling oh do not wait it'll grow too late oh come home come home my friends it's harvest time praise be to god listen this city of ledicia was also as i said a city of great earthquakes which finally destroyed it and i believe this age will also end with great earthquake of course brother william marion branham has prophesied the downfall of hollywood this great city of angels located in the area of california prophecy already has gone forth that this city will sink beneath the waves and behind it his words thus saith the lord and so shall it be for it has been spoken and so shall it be done o my glory to god his words or the words of god through him must and will be fulfilled flee run for your lives all those of you who want to naturally of course abandon that that place that's up to you oh but my friends i'm preaching to you the word of god condemned condemned to be an empty place of every foul burden evil spirit that you can find on the face of the earth i tell you they've gone off making love to the old harlot church and the spirit and heart of pervading that city similarity of that city and of our time and age everywhere beautiful city but a harlot to the word of god beautiful churches harlots to the word of god my friends let us consider these things that are before us not with a a laugh a joke a shrug off but back to the bible back to the word of god this seems old-fashioned this seems ancient but let me tell you he has bought alpha and omega beginning in the end oh the circle has come around and we're going back my friends back to the original again listen as we see it in the word of god god is fixing to shake this world again he's fixing to give her a shaking that she's never had and one day he'll shake it so bad that when he shakes it at the very end it will also be a shaking and a renovation back to her original burning off evil and germs and devils and everything else will be burnt off and shall come right back renewed for the millennial kingdom of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh my thank god help us yes a marvelously endowed city a city endowed with wet wealth a city full of culture dignified people a city abounding with sciences scientific achievements uh maybe they didn't have rockets like we had but we are seeing the same thing in our day dignity financial stability more trillionaires and billionaires than you've ever seen in your life it's happening right now let's not be asleep wake up and recognize your day and the message for your day don't let the devil rock you to sleep in a cradle of satisfaction but back to god's word may the word of god make you disturb and wake up to realize what is happening in our time lord jesus help us amen a city like today where are the churches were rich then and the churches are rich today unbelievably rich as the bible says increase with goods their worship beautiful worship but formal dignified cold dead yes dignified worship dignified but dead formal but no faith no revelation no understanding just singing to a an unknown god as paul said it yes just worshiping in that way beautiful wonderful atmosphere wonderful environment but contrary to the word of our god oh culture is everywhere beautiful paintings beautiful statues beautiful writings beautiful quotations of great men know all these things time will pass them away but the word of our god will stand forever a time filled with education yes an education has given way to replacing the holy spirit amen their work they want to have quick minds cunning minds oh they want to have minds like that instead of accepting hebrews 4 12 the word of god is quick and sharper than every two-edged sword piercing oh my my brothers and sisters they reject the spiritual uh word of god they reject the person and ministry of the holy spirit with their lips they say they believe it they accept him but they reject him when he truly speaks the truth to them they reject him when the word of truth is unfolded and the light is shunned upon these rats and roaches creatures of the night they flee from this word of god not recognizing their day nor the message of their day and of their owl and they have allowed their faith their faith in this invisible god this invisible christ this jesus christ who died for our sins their faith has been superseded by their faith in science and that rather to believe science than to believe the revelation of the word of god thus bringing themselves to become victims of what their eyes can see victims of materialism yes prisoners of their five senses they can't get out of those prison bars of the senses amen of the you the natural man they want to hold on to those senses and so they're imprisoned by them and this causes what we know as sentiusness oh the entire world is becoming an sentius immoral world filled invaded saturated with immorality as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of not lot so jesus said so shall it be but now today we can say so it is a time of violence a time of pornography and evil and senselessness but also because of the senses the sentence sexuality immorality on every hand has become an age also of unfaithfulness broken hearts broken marriages separations divorces on every hand we see it everywhere because it's the spirit of the age a marriage age an age of marriage and breaking up and going this way and uh people's rights and i have my right and you have your right and we have our rights and so it's that kind of a age of this chaos of culture and so-called dignity mixed in with their financial uh wealthiness and and and they try to cover up their consciences with their philanthropy and so on but it's all in the same pot and the witch's brew is now boiling on the fire while he satan sits there stirring the pot and waiting for it to become fully cooked yes but let's my friends the true believer is not waiting on his evil to come to its rightness before it comes to its rightness and the tribulation will be gone the rapture is at hand oh the great flight of the bride for the lord himself has descended with a shout and he said i'll take her away like a thief in the night with a secret rapture power the holy spirit quickening power already in the members of of his body bride getting herself ready coming of the lord right here with us among us this name being emmanuel thanks be to god and i'm so happy that we are experiencing another pentecost not that one back there but this one here of the same kind of a pattern same kind of word same kind of preaching preaching exactly what paul preached and trusting god trusting in the mercy of god trusting in his grace and in his mercy my friends that those who have been given an ear to hear let him or her hear the word of the lord for our day and let us not be partakers of the sins of mr babylon the mother of harlots let us not be partakers of the judgments that will come upon her but let us my friends lift our eyes and look to the great city than your jerusalem that's descending from god out of heaven then run let's run to that city in the words of our dear brother a precious brother eddie biscuit run there's nobody else here to run we are the last ones on the last lap of this entire race therefore if you ever ran let us run now i'm running for jesus for many long time and i'm not tired yet and i will continue to run oh let's work what till jesus comes and then he'll bear us home my lord my lord and my god may he bless you my friends may he bless us all may he speak to our hearts and lift us higher and higher on before we realize it we are in the presence of the lord and going up with with him in the clouds to the great meeting the convocation in the air god bless you will come again this sunday to have an awesome wonderful time feasting and feeding on the word of god until then god watch between us
