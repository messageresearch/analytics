our Wednesday night bible study and so we are going to be doing a little bit of Bible study tonight praise God we're going to be looking at uh some wonderful truths out of the word of God that we can apply in our lives amen and and also uh allow this word of God to liberate us and set us free Amen to be who God wants us to be praise God forevermore amen so tonight we'll be we'll be looking at the book of Romans chapter 8 and um our first scripture reading this evening you can go ahead and put it up we're going to read that and then we're going to pray verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life Romans chapter 8 verse 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we're grateful tonight Lord that we can surround ourselves in your presence oh God lord knowing that your anointing is in our midst once again Lord to minister to each and every need in our midst father Lord we ask that your spirit would come and bring Liberty

wherever they may be all the saints all over lord may your spirit go and just speak to their hearts and their lives and meet needs oh God and Lord we just would never fail but to give you the praise the glory and all the honor in Jesus name amen praise God I forgot to grab a bottle of water if somebody could just grab some water I'd appreciate that amen praise God Hallelujah no more condemnation in Christ praise God hallelujah The Book of Romans is probably one of the most amazing books of the New Testament it is a book that basically reveals how God you know shows us that we go from no condemnation to no separation when you look at the book of Romans if you read chapter 7 you know when you go home tonight or sometime this week I encourage you to read Romans chapter 7 and chapter 8 and you're gonna read it in a little different light you're going to see things a little clearer you're going to see that you are human that you did not um you know by your experience as a Christian and receiving the word of God yes you have been transformed you've been renewed in your mind but yet you've come to realize also that you're still living in this flesh this body of clay and that you are still susceptible to many things amen praise God but you know one one of the most wonderful things about the book of Romans is that within the book of Romans chapter 8 there's over 19 different times where the holy spirit is named it's like the the book of the Holy Spirit and how the holy spirit is so real and how relevant and how important it is to know that the spirit of God uh the attribute of God the Awakening of that attribute you may be seated how that the The Awakening of the attribute of God and how the spirit of God in you is is so powerful it is what makes everything so real in your ability to serve God because if you didn't have that understanding of you know greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world you'd be under condemnation all the time before you came to the Lord as a matter of fact you know even if you were a so-called Christian you were constantly under condemnation because you constantly found yourself in sin and unbelief no matter how much you tried to be you know a good person uh no matter how much you tried not to gossip no matter how much you try you know to do your best and to be honest you know you start out the day and you say Lord today I'm gonna do my best I'm gonna I'm not gonna do this I'm not gonna do that and by 10 o'clock you're doing this and by 12 o'clock you're doing that and you're finding yourself uh you know being under the spirit of condemnation praise God but then you come to realize that you're a Son of God through a message for your day you actually come into contact with the supernatural Living God the one that you heard about the one that you read about the one that you heard people talk about and you thought maybe you knew that that he was a reality but he was not a reality until he became and made himself real to you personally then everything changed then you came to realize that there was hope you came to realize that you were not just a human being born into this world born in a sinful flesh and a sinful under a sinful nature you came to realize that there's something that happens supernaturally when the message of the hour this is so important to realize the message of the hour which is Jesus Christ himself in the present stage of his ministry when he now makes himself real to you reveals himself to you you hear that there's that that God sent the prophet you know maybe when you first heard that it just didn't quite sit right but let me remind you and everybody else that when Jesus or when any other prophet of the Old Testament came on the scene it was always the exact same way they could not receive that Prophet they would not receive him they would not recognize that it was actually God in his day manifesting the portion of the word that he wanted to fulfill in that day you talk to somebody about God sending a prophet they're not going to believe it why because 99 of the people whenever a prophet came on the scene they didn't believe it they wouldn't accept it so it's perfectly normal for somebody to not believe that God sent a prophet in the 20th century amen the mighty Prophet The Mighty God the the Elohim the self-existent one made himself flesh came to the Earth spoke in amongst the common people but how many recognized that he was who he said he was a dozen people when he was here on the Earth so it's not unusual to to uh you know to testify to somebody tell them that God sent the prophet that you know it's not unusual for them to reject it or or uh you know disbelieve it or be very skeptical skeptical about it It's Perfectly Natural for that to happen why because it takes the supernatural God himself to reveal himself to the individual personally to make it real to them and to open their understanding by the spirit of Revelation which which is the Holy Ghost amen which is God it's not three separate people it's the same self One and Only Living true God revealing himself in his appointed time and season to each individual that is to receive the word Jesus said no man comes to the father which is him in his ultimate Elohim self-existent one before the foundations of the world no one can come lest the father draws him draws him how by revealing himself to them by opening their understanding by giving them a divine revelation of his thoughts towards them about who they are in his mind in him amen all that the father hath given me he said will come not might come they will come amen praise God so we don't have to pull people into the gospel listen it wasn't God pulling you into the gospel it was God unveiling his word to you when he looked to Matthew who was a tax collector and Matthew he was not somebody that was liked he was not somebody that was popular he was very unpopular but when Jesus looked to him and spoke to him and said Matthew follow me something supernaturally was revealed to Matthew right there at that moment that was a lot more than just the words Matthew follow me it was the spirit of God writing that word directly into Matthew's heart revealing to him who he was and that he was no longer like he did with Peter he would no longer be a fisher of of fish he would become a a fisher of men he would become one of his disciples now the spirit of God would get into Peter and would be a disciple somebody that would go out there and share the word of God and speak the word of God just like you you're just an a normal person Peter was just a normal fisherman but God had a plan for Peter hallelujah praise God God had a plan for Paul was on the road to Damascus one day and he was on his way to go and kill Christians imagine he was murdering Christians he was out against God he didn't realize he was against God he didn't realize that the Messiah was Jesus Christ but one day God knocks him off his high horse this happens all in one moment all in one day so don't be afraid to share the word of God with anybody because you don't know when God is going to reveal himself make himself known to that individual it can happen just like that because he is the god that opens he's the god that shuts that's why you don't have to force nothing but hear Paul he was he was definitely riding on a high horse he was thinking that all that he was doing was was God's will the Lord's will you know to get rid of these Heretics these people that thought that they were special that they were called of God that they you know that they had a special mission that they were you know Christians and God knocks him right off his high horse knocks him on the ground and right there and then reveals himself right to Paul because Paul says who art thou Lord he says I am Jesus imagine so the lord of the Old Testament the one that he thought was God he didn't realize was now made flesh had come and you know started a Ministry on the earth fulfilling his word and his his plan they didn't realize that it was the Mighty God and he never knew it until God said it is I Jesus and right there he was given instruction what to do and he's the one that wrote This Book of Romans and you'll see you know as we go along we're going to do a study of this you know um because I I believe there's just so much in here that can strengthen us that can give us Victorious living amen praise God so let's go to the um to the next um slide here brother Branham in seed is not air with the shuck he says there is no judgment to the Royal spiritual predestinated Seed of Abraham for they are predestinated to eternal life eternal means having no beginning and no End Amen etern predestinated to eternal life means that you always were you were a son or a daughter of God you were an attribute of God there's never a time that you were not and you were predestinated to be awakened in this time and season here on this Earth amen they have accepted God's provided sacrifice and that sacrifice which is Christ the word and there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit you and I we were all walking after the flesh and we still do on a daily basis walk after the flesh because we're in the flesh you can't change that until this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved you are going to be in a in a constant struggle with this flesh amen and the flesh is going to pull you in certain ways because of the weakness of the flesh because you gotta you gotta sleep You Gotta Eat You Gotta you know you gotta deal with people you've got to deal with interrelationships and as human beings we are very weak we get tired and we have to deal with the things of the flesh but the beautiful thing about the word of God and the Holy Spirit coming into our lives is that now he takes over he takes over the spirit of God starts to direct Our Lives starts to give us inspiration starts to show us by the word of God that that's not who you really are this is who you really are you are an attribute of God you were with me from before the foundations of the world you got trapped into a Time body you came into this world and you went into spiritual Amnesia you lost your your your understanding through a flesh body and through a fleshly experience as a human you lost all of your understanding that you went into a spiritual Amnesia but it's okay I've awakened you now I've awakened your understanding I've opened your understanding and now you're not going to be led so much by that flesh you are going to be led by the spirit amen praise God and the next slide says God being misunderstood 1961 he says no sir we do not stand before the Judgment we are now standing before the Judgment God put our sins upon Christ that's why you know it's so important for anybody to understand when it comes to Christ that all the sin and all the unbelief and all the things of your past you know um people they want to make everything right before they come to serve the Lord they think that they can make all their wrongs right but that's not how it works the only way that you can truly be liberated in Christ is when you place all of your sin on Christ because he took it to the cross for you he took your place he stood in the Gap when he went to Calvary and took all of our sin and unbelief and therefore it is not by your own righteousness it's not going to be by your own ways that you are going to serve God it's going to be because the spirit of God is going to take control and possess you and his life is going to live through you amen praise God you know when we look at the book of Romans okay because we're looking at our whole thought here is that there is no there is now no more condemnation we must come to a place where we walk with God to realize because especially now that we're in the Rapture season we're we're we're we're experiencing rapturing Faith this is all part of that series unrapturing faith that God is revealing and giving to us and it's not something you know that we want to make you know rapturing faith and we've got to make it something mysterious no it's as simple as God revealing to you by revelation that you are a son or daughter of God an attribute of God and that you were already prepared from before the foundations of the world to take a rapture you're predestinated for the body change you are that particular group that are going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we are the ones that God has chosen and so it's important to understand that there's there's uh all these aspects of living that we have to deal with and there's there's there's three tremendous truths that we can draw from The Book of Romans and one of them is that there is a struggle in the Christian Life as long as you're living In the Flesh there's going to be a struggle there's going to be listen to Paul he says in my mind I want to please God but there is something in me that makes me want to do the opposite you know there's this struggle in our nature you know there's this this this constant battle over and over again he says that which I should I would do I do not that which I hate I do and we all understand that that this happens don't we understand that don't we experience those things you know that which I hate I do we all understand every single day you know we get up and we say Lord this is your day and I'm going to be your servant and do your will today you know everybody wants that you know that you know to start their day that way and then uh you know um Lord this is your day and then so we set our goal to accomplish a certain number of things and that we know we will be pleasing to God and then as we go through the day we don't do number one we halfway do number two we skip number three all the things that we wanted to do right and we get most of number four and we don't do number five at all then we say Lord with your help I'm not going to lose my temper and we lose it by 9 A.M these are these are realities of us as human beings you know and Paul you know like the book of Romans it brought out Paul's biography almost you know like when you read it when you read you know Romans 7 and Romans 8 read it carefully and listen to Paul and listen to what he's saying and listen how he's struggling you know he's struggling as a as a human being he realizes that that you know we're we're you know caught by sinful nature you know that you know there's things in this world that are constantly pulling on us amen and then you know uh we say Lord help me not to to gossip and by by 1 30 that day we've blown that one too you know or because you know somebody comes up to you and tells you about a co-worker and starts gossiping about that co-worker and all of a sudden you're starting to add your two cents to it and then you realize oh God here we go again you see you're dealing with the things of this flesh amen it's not easy praise God but we need to understand that God by giving us his spirit we've overcome by his spirit we don't overcome by our own ability we overcome by believing the word of God that's how we overcome we overcome by knowing that he's the one that's in US revealing himself and overcoming through us you know next slide for for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord we know that sin will bring forth death and sin there's only one sin and that is the disbelieving of God's word when you disbelieve God's word it's sin but but you see he's he's he's giving us these thoughts here to tell us that we've been given something greater through Christ Jesus we've been given eternal life it's not something that that that has a beginning and has an end your salvation doesn't have a beginning and have an end amen your salvation has no beginning and has no end it's as simple as that and so we don't fall under that but yet next slide first John 1 8-9 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US you see it's understanding you can't have an unbalanced walk you can't be walking around in the world and saying I can do whatever I want I don't care whatever I do I can't sin because I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I don't make mistakes if you got that kind of an attitude then you haven't even got a revelation of the word of God Amen but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and so the balance is understanding that you are walking in the flesh but you are a son of God you will make mistakes you will say things that are wrong but you need to confess your sins you need to make those things right so that you can move on and not come under the spirit of condemnation because the Paradox is that there is now no condemnation but yet how many of us experience it from time to time when we make mistakes we feel that conviction in our heart we feel that condemnation in our heart because we're falling in under that same you know routine you're falling under you know because you're you're you're a creature of habits you're a human being so as a human being you're a creature of habits you're gonna you're gonna get caught into a habitual way of life but what happens as we grow in Christ that nature starts to break that that power of Habitual you know habitually falling back into disbelief falling back into sin that has to be broken by Revelation only God can give you Revelation on overcoming those things amen it's not going to be by your own uh ability it's going to be by divine revelation only Revelation sets you completely free from condemnation no condemnation to them that are in Christ amen and to be in Christ you know that you are an attribute of God you've been washed you've been Sanctified you've been Justified as though you've never done it in the first place you see that's the whole paradox of living this life amen praise God next slide Christ took our judgment he took it all we need to these are simple truth Saints we're doing a Bible study so that we can understand and it's not you know I know we've all heard these things we've all read these things but we need to understand that there's a lot of people out there that have not heard these things and they are looking for a way to be set free because a lot of people are living in bondage even in this message there's people that are living in bondage because they don't have a true and clear revelation of who they are amen praise God what is it it's God's representative of judgment Christ already judged for your sins Christ already judged for your Temptation Christ already judged for your sickness see what I mean everything that you you know you you find yourself making mistakes you find yourself you know falling short from time to time all those things they were already judged you're not being judged you yourself have already been judged because you're in Christ but you as a human being conscious and and in having this carnal nature you need to be aware of your attitude your your ways of doing things your ways of living you know you need to be conscious of those things so that you don't fall into the traps of the enemy because the enemy is constantly trying to set us up to be trapped into getting into condemnation getting into a backslidden condition getting us away from God by using those those little foxes that spoil the vine the little mistakes that we make from time to time the things that we do that we know we shouldn't do like Paul says amen praise God next slide judgment begins where at the house of God by the word of God Amen this is where we receive the word of God this is how we receive Deliverance by the power of God the church is the Judgment seat judgment begins in the house of God Amen praise God the church is the Judgment when we come into the house of the Lord and the spirit of God gets on the on the minister and starts to minister the word via the five-fold ministry we are receiving the word of God that liberates us from being under that Spirit of condemnation now the Holy Spirit starts to speak to us that's why assembling ourselves and and coming into the house of the Lord and feeding on the word of God is so important for us to to assemble and to and to come together because it's there where the Holy Spirit speaks to our needs it's there where the holy spirit gives us Revelation on Deliverance on the situations in our lives when we come with that sincerity in our hearts when we come with expectation to know that that you're still growing that you're still maturing in Christ that you're you're doing you're doing all that you can to grow in Christ and doing uh what we know we we should do is what is how we get blessed we know that we need to come and assemble ourselves in the house of the Lord we know that it benefits us we know that we're that when we do that we receive the spirit of God and when the spirit of God speaks to our needs Deliverance takes place in our lives amen praise God listen to brother Branham in things that are to be he says Lord Jesus we humbly come confessing our wrongs we need to submit ourselves to the spirit of God we come confessing that we are worthy of sickness and death and sorrow but we are accepting your propitiation for our sins and our sickness and tonight these Sons and Daughters of God setting here hearing the correction of the word and raising their hands and wanting a closer walk they're laying hands on one another now because they believe your word to be true they believe that we're now risen with Christ setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen praise God forevermore and so in order for us to really come to God we need to come God's provided way we need to we need to come through the blood of Jesus Christ and you know as a new Christian um they need to understand how to get to the place of no condemnation it starts with them coming into a relationship with God it comes by them coming to know God in the power of his resurrection and then they come to the place where they realize that everything that they've done as up until the time that they've met God it all is worthless everything that you did all the things that you thought were right everything you got to come to a place where you fully repent and it starts by them recognizing just like you know when you first came to the Lord you wanted to be baptized you needed to repent you needed to come according to Acts 2 38. you came to realize that there was no other way that you were going to receive the spirit of God you see these are these are the processes of coming to God the simple things that we do in order to come to God and the prescription is in Acts 2 38. then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now as simple as that sounds it is the prescription for every son and daughter of God when they come to realize the spirit of God has called them it starts with baptism a lot of people say oh well you know I was baptized as a baby babies cannot believe the word of God babies cannot repent you have to repent in order to truly receive the spirit of God it says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ not in the names of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit we don't believe in a trinity we believe in one God and so in order to be properly scripturally baptized you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen praise God so you talk to people and you you know I actually met somebody today you know I was doing a delivery for a customer today and um as I was uh you know there I had my my worker unloading the load it was a load of sod for a customer and so um I overheard the owner of the home talking to a couple a woman and a young man and and then I could hear him talking about the word of God and saying yeah but God is one God you know and and it just caught my attention and I slowly walked over because I talked to the owner before that and it was on the second load that we were going there and uh and I realized oh this is Jehovah Witness you know testifying to the man but this this gentleman you know he was a gentleman maybe about 70 73 years old and uh you know but but he had he had a revelation on the Oneness of God and he was trying to explain that to the to the person you know and then I kind of slowly walked up and I said praise God brother that's nothing but the truth you know that's the truth God is one God you know it was like when you know and then we started talking and then the woman you know she was there and she was nodding her head and you know we don't believe in in uh you know in uh the Mighty God and then the almighty God we believe in Elohim the self-existent one and I got to testifying about the Oneness of God and you know we were talking about how God you know when Jesus made when when God was made flesh in Jesus he was here on the earth and uh he was Emmanuel he was God made flesh the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and I said who was that and and the gentleman was saying that was God I said exactly God is one the Old Testament Jehovah is Jesus of the New Testament and you know and then so finally the woman and the young man they finally you know they realized that they had met their match you know and so they just nicely in a very nice way they said well you know uh praise God you know you know the Lord is good this and that and and she ended up leaving and and we said God bless you Sister may the Lord continue to open your understanding and you know because it takes the spirit of God to reveal himself to you it's not something that we learn that we teach ourselves that you know you can study the scriptures and that's good it's good to study the scriptures but it's a lot greater when the Holy Spirit himself comes and he says Ah he says I will send you the comforter Jesus said I will send you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he will guide you into all truth and the Holy Spirit can never go against his own word it can never happen Well the lady left there with the young man and then I was standing there and you know talking to the to the gentleman and I said I said so I said um are you Pentecostal and he says no he says uh uh I'm with the Brethren you know with the Brethren you know we believe uh in one God and and I said oh praise God that's wonderful I said you know I said it's wonderful to you know to Fellowship on the word of God and and to know that that when the Holy Spirit reveals himself because it takes God to really you know reveal his word to us personally in order for us to really know him and and I said uh so so uh how were you baptized he says oh I was baptized I was baptized fully immersioned into into water and I said yeah and how were you baptized like were you baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he says no I was baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit and I said oh I said okay so I went to my my truck and I got the the track because I took a couple of the tracks that I saw the new tracks that we got here on baptism last Sunday and I put him in my truck and right away I remembered ah I got those tracks you know because they're really good and I said oh I said I want to share something with you you know I'd like you to read this and then I believe that you're gonna that you're gonna call me I believe that you're gonna you're gonna see something because I can see because while I was fellowshipping with him and we were talking about the word I could see that that he was responding there was an amen there there wasn't a resistance it was Amen to the word of God he would say yes that's true that's right every scripture that I would that I would quote he would say yes that's amen he would even finish the scripture you know uh and and so you could see that that there was something that was starting to take place there and so I left it with him and I said there's only one form of baptism and that is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and when you've read this and you've taken some time and I also asked them to write down the name of William Miriam Branham I said he was an evangelist and a minister back in the 50s and 60s that I believe you know if you you get a chance you could listen to some of his sermons because there's some beautiful wonderful thoughts and tremendous Revelation coming from his ministry that you may find interesting not going to turn around and tell them oh he's the prophet of the 20th century if you don't believe that you're not gonna no it's not believing that brother Branham was the 20th century Prophet that saves anybody salvation is of the Lord is when the spirit of truth comes into you individually as a son or a daughter of God and God opens your understanding when you read the word when you listen to the prophet when you hear the the the preaching of the word it's because your understanding has been opened to receive Truth for your day and now all of a sudden it all makes sense everything makes sense praise God and so I love this opportunity that we can from you know on Wednesday nights we should try and focus on on uh you know I mean all the ministers should you know be led by the spirit and whatever the Lord lays upon their hearts but remember Wednesday nights are Bible study and we want to focus on some of the foundational truths of the word of God so that other people through the Simplicity of the word can receive Christ because remember it's not okay if you're an attribute of God you've got to come and be awakened to the word of God and you've got to come to your position in Christ but it takes that Awakening it takes that that season where God is going to do it for me it was you know going to see brother Gabriel and you know he gave me a tape and asked me if I was a Christian that was my time for you it was your time some of you were like brother Anthony's brought up in the message but then there came a certain time where the Holy Spirit decided now I'm going to place him I'm going to adopt him it's all in the Book of Romans everything that you know that we're talking about here tonight you know we're going to be looking at a lot more of it we're just looking at a little bit here tonight and uh we're using it as a platform to be like a a way of of getting this message out getting the word for our day into the hearts of the people but there's they need to come to their own repentance they need to come to their own experience with Christ they need to but it only comes by hearing the word faith cometh by hearing the word and the word is not just the word when you read and just say the word the word is when the spirit of God rides the word into the hearts of each and every individual amen praise God hallelujah and so you know I'm just gonna close here very shortly uh another three or four minutes I don't want to keep you long because of this potential storms and so forth here tonight but we can go to the next slide on questions and answers and um you know we're talking about condemnation we're talking about judgment uh you're not you as the Sons and Daughters of God attributes of God you do not go into judgment the bride will never be judged no sir she's in Christ if you're in Christ when Christ went to the Cross everything that needed to be judged was judged right there and then it was a finished that's why when Jesus finally completed he said it is finished what was finished the Judgment of his sons and daughters all those that that that that he redeemed all those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life those that that were predestinated to receive their the word of God for their day everything that you had need of God already provided it here we are two thousand years later because we are humans and we're living in this time dimension everything is relevant based on time to us because we're creatures of time you know let's face it right it takes so much time for me to walk from here to the back door we're in time and space and because of that everything is playing out but yet when you break out of this dimension and back into your rightful position as a son or daughter attribute of God there is no time or space it is a dimension of perfect of a perfect eternity that's why when you hear people they have you know they have near-death experiences their whole life flashes before their eyes and they can't explain how it is that that happened well it's simple they break out of this Dimension and and in that other dimension there is no time or space so you can look this way and you can look into the past you can look that way you can see the future that's why brother Branham as a prophet God gave him the ability by Vision to break into that other dimension so that he could see the future and see the past and that's why he could tell a person oh your name is Jack and two days ago you were at so and so and he told you this and he told you that and then he looks over here and you know the doctor said this but then he sees Jack walking perfectly whole over here and he says thus saith the Lord you'll not receive that doctor's report you'll be made whole if you'll just believe and he knows he's going to believe because God just spoke the revelation directly into his heart you see that's what God does your Awakening and your opening to the word of God and your ability to recognize the word was because God opened it to you he didn't say Josh I open your eyes he didn't have to say that all he had to do was preach a certain message and Josh at that moment something just clicked and he realized oh my God I'm a Son of God I'm an attribute of God I can see it as clear as a bell how come I don't even know how to explain it you don't try to explain a revelation a revelation is something that you cannot explain it's just revealed to you and when God reveals to you that you will not be judged that you've that everything that all your mistakes and all the things that that Satan tries to put you under condemnation for was already judged at Calvary and when Satan comes and says I'm going to put cancer on you that was already judged at Calvary how can he says buy his stripes we are healed how can we say we are healed because it was judged at Calvary it was the bleeding lamb everything was judged from before actually be from before the foundations of the world he knew exactly that we would come into this dimension we would have to face certain things certain circumstances situations that would bring us into you know into spiritual Amnesia into condemnation into all these things but there is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ remember we're in Christ the bride is in Christ the bride is is she's she's not only on that day she shall know that I am in the that I am in the father ye and me and I in you you will know that that you are actually in Christ and that he is in you and that he is actually displaying himself that's what the token the the token on display is Christ himself come down to manifest his word in our day in the season that we're living in to manifest it and display it before the people so that they can know that God is real in 2023 in July of 2023. Hallelujah come ahead brother Anthony next in the Rapture message he says and notice not only is the bride washed forgiven but she's Justified see did you ever try the word justify to see what it really means but the word Justified is though you never done it at all hallelujah praise God Amen you want to come to Christ I want you to know that God has made a way for you to come to Christ I want you to know that all you need to do is repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and God by the word of God is obligated to give you the Holy Ghost give you a revelation and an understanding of who you are amen and then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us so from sins till it's put into the book of God's forgetfulness amen praise God that's all I have for you tonight praise God just a little introduction on we are now now we are no longer under any condemnation because we are in Christ Jesus you can have a fresh start tonight praise God claim the blood of Jesus oh nothing but the blood [Music] away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus [Music] oh precious is [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] I don't [Music] know I have died [Music] thank you [Music] this is [Music] again [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah you are dismissed tonight amen [Music] [Music] is destination [Music]
