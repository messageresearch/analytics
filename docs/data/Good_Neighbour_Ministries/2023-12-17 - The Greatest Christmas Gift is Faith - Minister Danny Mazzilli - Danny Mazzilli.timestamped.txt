[33:34] focus in on the gift the great gift that
[33:38] God has given us amen Luke 2: 8 to 14
[33:43] reads and there were in the same country
[33:46] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[33:49] watch over their flock by night and lo
[33:53] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[33:56] the glory of of the Lord Shone round
[33:58] about them and they were sore afraid and
[34:02] the angel said unto them fear not for
[34:05] behold I bring you good tidings of great
[34:07] joy which shall be to all people amen
[34:12] for unto you is Born This Day in the
[34:14] city of David a savior which is Christ
[34:18] the lord and this shall be a sign unto
[34:21] you you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[34:24] swaddling clothes lying in a manger and
[34:28] suddenly there was with the angel a
[34:31] multitude of heavenly hosts praising God
[34:34] and saying glory to God in the highest
[34:36] and on Earth peace Good Will toward
[34:42] men go to the next slide we'll continue
[34:45] and it came to pass as the Angels were
[34:48] gone away from them into heaven the
[34:50] shepher said one to another let us now
[34:53] go even unto Bethlehem and see this
[34:56] thing which which has come to pass which
[34:58] the Lord hath made known unto us and
[35:02] they came with haste and found Mary and
[35:05] Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger
[35:08] and when they had seen it they made
[35:10] known abroad the same which was told
[35:12] them concerning this child and all they
[35:15] that heard it wondered at those things
[35:18] which were told them by the Shepherds
[35:20] but Mary kept all these things and
[35:23] pondered them in her heart and the
[35:25] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[35:28] praising God for all the things that
[35:32] they had heard and seen as it was told
[35:36] unto them praise God the Lord add His
[35:38] blessings to the word you may be
[35:41] seated my my my what a time what an hour
[35:46] here God was displaying his word he was
[35:49] bringing to pass a word that had been
[35:52] prophesied all through the Old Testament
[35:55] that the Messiah was was going to come
[35:57] the Messiah was going to come he would
[35:59] be the savior he would be the Redeemer
[36:02] he would be the one that would take away
[36:04] all the sins of the world and restore
[36:07] the the the the kingdom back because in
[36:10] in those days you know Israel was
[36:13] scattered they were all wondering what
[36:15] was going to happen they were studying
[36:17] the word they were believing that there
[36:18] was going to be a change and there were
[36:20] people in the land that were all under
[36:23] bondage the Gentiles were under bondage
[36:25] Rome was was controlling the people was
[36:28] was uh uh it was it was kind of like a
[36:30] day like today amen where where the
[36:33] people were were kind of Uncertain
[36:35] didn't know what was going to happen
[36:37] didn't know if they had a future they
[36:39] were under the bondage of Rome and and
[36:42] under the the control of of of uh of
[36:45] dictatorship and Herod was in power and
[36:49] all he cared about was that he was the
[36:51] king he would be the only King and yet
[36:53] there was a there was a message that
[36:55] went out that Messiah
[36:57] was going to come and the Messiah was
[36:59] coming and then the prophecy started to
[37:01] get closer and the prophecy became more
[37:04] real just like today they talk about the
[37:06] coming of the lord they're saying he's
[37:08] going to be coming he's coming he's
[37:10] coming but yet he had already come amen
[37:14] and here we are living in a day where
[37:15] people are still crying out and they're
[37:17] saying he's coming he's coming he's
[37:19] coming but then there's a people there's
[37:22] simple humble people where the where the
[37:24] spirit of God has come and revealed
[37:26] himself and made known unto them that he
[37:29] is here amen and that we have a
[37:32] wonderful message praise God go to the
[37:35] next slide 2 Corinthians
[37:37] 9:15 you know this is in the new
[37:40] international version and I'll read it
[37:41] to you from the Amplified version it's
[37:43] quite similar but it says thanks be to
[37:46] God for his
[37:49] Indescribable gift it's an Indescribable
[37:53] gift this gift that we've received you
[37:56] know to the the people here people today
[37:58] they're you know they've made Christmas
[38:00] all about you know a baby being born in
[38:03] a manger and and they're surrounding it
[38:05] all around a baby being born in a manger
[38:09] and not recognizing that that that baby
[38:12] had a significance to it it was God
[38:14] coming to Earth it was the word made
[38:17] flesh and in that baby was wrapped all
[38:20] kinds of
[38:21] Prophecy there was prophecy wrapped in
[38:23] that baby that was going to bring
[38:26] Salvation to all that could believe and
[38:29] here Paul I want you to notice here in
[38:31] this scripture Paul when he when he when
[38:33] he when he wrote this um I want you to
[38:36] understand that Paul was a brilliant
[38:38] teacher of the scriptures he was taught
[38:40] by
[38:41] gelia and here he is he's you know he's
[38:44] trying you know Saul of Tarsus he was
[38:46] well respected in his day he was a keen
[38:50] thinker he was he was he had a
[38:52] vocabulary that could that could just
[38:55] you know mesmerize people he was a he
[38:58] was a leader and a teacher of Greek he
[39:00] he knew the Greek understanding he knew
[39:03] the Greek teachings he knew that he was
[39:05] a dictionary he was a walking dictionary
[39:08] amen praise God he was a he was a
[39:11] capable
[39:12] Communicator he and and more of his
[39:15] writings are in the New Testament than
[39:17] anybody else next to Jesus Christ I
[39:21] believe he's probably the one of the
[39:23] greatest theologians and thinkers that
[39:26] has ever come to this
[39:28] planet praise God I I never cease to be
[39:31] amazed by by his writings you know when
[39:34] you read them and and and and here he's
[39:37] he he comes to this place you know where
[39:39] where he was an amazing uh Communicator
[39:42] an amazing writer you know um and yet he
[39:46] pauses to a simple four-letter word when
[39:49] he came to the word gift and he couldn't
[39:53] put a description on it all he could say
[39:56] say was it it's
[39:58] Indescribable hallelujah it's
[40:01] Indescribable you know and here in the
[40:03] new Amplified version in uh in the same
[40:06] verse chapter uh 9 verse1 15 of 2
[40:09] Corinthians he says now thanks be to God
[40:12] for his gift precious Beyond telling his
[40:18] Indescribable
[40:21] inexpressible free
[40:24] gift glory to God Amen
[40:27] this is without price when God gives you
[40:30] faith and God gives you a revelation of
[40:32] his word he doesn't put any condition on
[40:35] it it's not something that you did to
[40:38] deserve it you didn't deserve this gift
[40:41] you didn't uh do anything you didn't go
[40:43] to school and become a great Theologian
[40:46] because there's many of great
[40:47] theologians that could that could be
[40:49] seated right here and that are preaching
[40:51] the word out there to hundreds and and
[40:54] thousands and millions of of listeners
[40:57] out there but yet they're preaching a
[41:00] word that is not revelated by the spirit
[41:04] of God and therefore the gift has no
[41:08] effect Jesus you know when when he stood
[41:11] there before all the Pharisees and the
[41:14] Sadducees he realized that they had made
[41:16] the word of God of none effect to the
[41:19] people because they had attached their
[41:21] own doctrines their own teachings their
[41:25] own interpretation
[41:26] I mean there's so many different
[41:28] interpretations on the word of God now
[41:30] especially when it comes to Christmas
[41:32] you know and and you know let's face it
[41:35] Saints Christmas is every day for us
[41:38] Christmas is not just December you know
[41:42] December 25th the world has
[41:44] commercialized it the world has has
[41:46] placed it into this season but really
[41:49] you know Christmas is all the time for
[41:51] for Sons and Daughters of God because
[41:53] Christmas is the worship of Jesus Christ
[41:58] and if you want to talk about the birth
[41:59] of Jesus it wasn't in in the winter in
[42:03] December it was in the spring when all
[42:05] the Lambs are born because he was the
[42:07] Lamb of God that would take away the
[42:09] sins of the
[42:10] world and he went to what when when the
[42:13] Angels were sent down the Angels were
[42:16] sent to shepherds in the
[42:19] field let's look at this
[42:22] Indescribable why is this gift too
[42:25] awesome for words I mean after all it's
[42:27] just a baby but it was Indescribable but
[42:31] it wasn't just an ordinary bab if it had
[42:33] have been an ordinary baby then fine
[42:36] then then you know then then you could
[42:37] say that you know it's just an ordinary
[42:39] child that's being born and to a lot of
[42:41] people that's what it was but to us we
[42:44] had a revelation and an understanding
[42:46] that it was more than just the child it
[42:49] was the word being made flesh in the day
[42:52] that he was coming to the Earth amen
[42:55] praise God and so when we look at this
[42:58] we look at this gift Jesus wrapped in
[43:01] swaddling cloth I want you to notice
[43:03] that you know when we read the scripture
[43:05] this will be a sign to you he's going to
[43:08] be wrapped in swaddling cloths I believe
[43:11] that that sign is still a sign
[43:14] today because when God comes he doesn't
[43:17] come to the Kings and all the great
[43:19] thinkers of the
[43:21] day they they're they're actually
[43:23] further away from this Revelation and
[43:25] this gift of faith than anybody else
[43:28] because the more you try to understand
[43:31] God and the more you try to
[43:33] scientifically uh understand the word of
[43:35] God and and theoretically understand the
[43:37] word of God the further away it takes
[43:40] you from
[43:43] God hallelujah he was wrapped in
[43:46] swaddling cloths in a
[43:48] Manger let's look at the next
[43:51] scripture or the the next slide it's a
[43:54] quote from Brother brandom listen to
[43:56] brother Bram he says way into the East
[43:59] and many hundreds of miles away from
[44:01] there the Magi was already on their Road
[44:05] they had seen his star and was coming to
[44:08] worship God's little gift package that
[44:11] he was sending to the world just a
[44:14] little while from then and the world was
[44:16] going to receive its greatest gift that
[44:20] it had ever received a little package
[44:23] wrapped up a little first little
[44:26] Christmas package that was ever wrapped
[44:29] in all the world God wrapped it up I
[44:33] want to break in on my thought and say
[44:35] this the greatest thing was ever wrapped
[44:39] in human flesh was wrapped in it God
[44:43] himself wrapped his own self in a
[44:46] Christmas package and sent it to the
[44:49] world why did they refuse it why
[44:54] couldn't they see it why did they turn
[44:57] it down why is it they didn't want it
[45:01] the same reason they don't want it
[45:04] tonight it wasn't handed to them in the
[45:07] custom that they were used to gifts
[45:10] being handed that's the reason it's
[45:12] rejected yet tonight is because it's not
[45:16] handed to the people in the custom that
[45:18] they have been used to receiving gifts
[45:21] but God wrapped his own package he's got
[45:24] a right to do it he the one that's
[45:26] giving it he has a right to wrap it in
[45:29] any way he wants to wrap it doesn't make
[45:32] any difference how he how it is he's got
[45:34] a right to do it because he's the one
[45:37] that's
[45:38] giving the the
[45:42] gift God can give Revelation and give an
[45:47] understanding of himself to whomever he
[45:50] chooses to give it to it's not something
[45:55] that you can can deserve that you can
[45:57] say I did this I did that I deserve this
[46:00] or I deserve that no sir it is only
[46:04] something that God can give because he
[46:07] has a purpose in giving it to you amen
[46:12] there's a purpose behind
[46:14] it so we can say that that baby was
[46:17] wrapped in Prophecy it was wrapped in
[46:19] history it was wrapped in everything
[46:23] that we would that that that that we
[46:24] would see
[46:26] fulfilled as as we look back on the
[46:28] scriptures and here we are today at
[46:31] 2023 and we can look back we're not
[46:34] looking at the baby we're not we're not
[46:37] talking about the baby today that was
[46:40] just a sign that was God humbling
[46:42] himself and coming to the Earth
[46:45] according to his word he said that he
[46:47] would come exactly that way he said that
[46:50] a virgin would conceive but yet when the
[46:53] Virgin conceived and she was right there
[46:55] in the midst of their of his own people
[46:58] they couldn't recognize it they didn't
[47:00] recognize it they didn't see the
[47:02] Simplicity of God's word and that's the
[47:05] thing that that people always tend to do
[47:08] they get so caught up into their own
[47:11] ideas their own interpretations their
[47:14] own ways that they should see the word
[47:16] of God and they'll always miss exactly
[47:21] what God is doing and God doesn't do it
[47:24] just you know
[47:26] uh I'm just going to fool them and I'm
[47:28] going to I said this and I'm going to do
[47:29] it this way no sir when God does
[47:33] something he does it exactly according
[47:35] to his word and and and the word will
[47:38] prove it a virgin shall conceive he
[47:41] shall be born in Bethlehem the city of
[47:44] David the city of God's bread everything
[47:47] that God did he did it exactly according
[47:51] to the way that he said he would do it
[47:54] and he always does it that that way and
[47:56] even here today we're going to be
[47:58] looking at how it is that he's doing it
[48:00] here today and yet people are in the
[48:03] midst of Christmas they're celebrating
[48:05] they're setting up their mangers in
[48:07] their homes they're putting the little
[48:08] baby in the manger and they're actually
[48:11] they're actually worshiping the little
[48:13] baby they're worshiping the little baby
[48:16] not realizing that that was only a sign
[48:18] that was God coming to to to Earth to to
[48:22] Simply uh fulfill his purpose in going
[48:25] to the cross that was the greatest
[48:27] victory that was the greatest gift that
[48:29] could ever come but the gift has
[48:31] fulfilled its purpose and today we need
[48:34] to recognize what the purpose of that
[48:37] gift was and how it affects us in our
[48:40] day and how salvation is being made
[48:42] available to a people in this hour and
[48:45] that it wrapped up in the prophecy of
[48:47] that little baby was you and your
[48:50] destiny was was you and and and the
[48:53] Rapture seeing you going to to the Cross
[48:56] when he went to the Cross you went to
[48:58] the cross with him because you were in
[49:00] him amen everything was wrapped into the
[49:03] prophecy of that child and here today we
[49:06] want to unravel that gift we want to see
[49:08] what the gift is giving us today we want
[49:10] to recognize what he's given us here in
[49:13] this day and in this hour amen praise
[49:15] God and so when we look at this we see
[49:18] that that that there's many
[49:21] wise but yet the Lord remember he's
[49:25] always own interpreter and he'll make it
[49:28] plain but why was it that he went to
[49:31] Shepherds and not to the high priests
[49:34] and the theologians of that
[49:36] day why did he bypass the rich and go to
[49:42] the poor you know you know Shepherds
[49:43] were were poor they were smelly they
[49:45] were always with their sheep they were
[49:47] there so much that they you know they
[49:49] hung around with their sheep so much
[49:50] that they smelled like their sheep it
[49:52] was like it was like they were uh you
[49:55] know the the simplest and the humblest
[49:57] people but yet God decides to go to
[49:59] Shepherds in a field to declare here the
[50:02] the highest God the the god of the
[50:04] universe comes to the lowest on Earth
[50:08] and and reveals and lets them know that
[50:10] hey um I'm here I'm here this day in the
[50:14] city of David a child has been born
[50:17] Christ the Lord he was telling them
[50:20] exactly and when they went there they
[50:22] saw exactly what God the Angels had told
[50:25] told them they would find amen praise
[50:28] God why did he bypass the smart
[50:30] intellectuals the learned and go to the
[50:33] humble and the
[50:36] unlearned why did he bypass them God was
[50:40] showing that he was the great Shepherd
[50:43] God was showing that that that that he
[50:45] could choose and and fulfill his word in
[50:49] a way that would baffle the the the the
[50:52] the high-m minded the wise and The
[50:53] Prudent but would would he he could
[50:55] reveal it to babes such as as
[50:58] us you wonder why did God allow me to
[51:02] see this revelation of himself in this
[51:07] day and in this hour how could I be so
[51:10] blessed and so you know So Unworthy but
[51:13] yet God chose me god listen it's not
[51:18] something that you did it's not be
[51:20] listen it's not your fault that God
[51:22] chose you so don't try and justify to
[51:24] your friends and your family when you're
[51:26] telling them about Jesus Christ and how
[51:28] he has changed your life and how he's
[51:31] the center of your life now that's not
[51:33] something you need to justify because
[51:35] you didn't do it it's him he chose you
[51:39] he's proving his own word in you it's
[51:42] not you got to prove something to the
[51:44] world or you got to justify that you
[51:46] know that that you serve God and that
[51:48] you that that that the word is a reality
[51:50] to you and and you know that that that
[51:53] the baby the revelation of the baby when
[51:56] you start to you know Fellowship around
[51:58] the word of God there's so much
[51:59] Revelation that just constantly pours
[52:01] into your heart what is it it's not
[52:04] something that you did it's not
[52:06] something that you need to justify it's
[52:08] because Christ decided that he was going
[52:11] to come to you because when he comes to
[52:15] any people it's because he wants to
[52:18] manifest his word to that
[52:22] generation remember that Hallelujah go
[52:26] to the next slide but when Jesus comes
[52:29] someday the great Shepherd of the sheep
[52:32] and you know we are
[52:33] sheep that's why he's the great Shepherd
[52:37] sheep he said my sheep hear my voice
[52:40] they will not follow any other voice
[52:42] that's why you you you can't you can't
[52:45] describe this this uh you know unveiling
[52:48] of the word and and the Revelation
[52:50] that's come to you it's not something
[52:52] you can you can uh describe to people
[52:54] it's it's in the
[52:55] Indescribable it's just something that
[52:57] God does and he says the great Shepherd
[53:00] of the sheep from Pentecost through
[53:02] Luther through all the ages that has
[53:05] accepted the light as it comes through
[53:09] the carriers notice what he says here
[53:12] not except the
[53:15] carriers I'll repeat that he says that
[53:19] has accepted the light that has come
[53:23] through the carriers not except the
[53:26] carrier except the light see went out
[53:30] he'll come to redeem I'm so glad I know
[53:34] he's coming again oh would you be
[53:36] numbered with his group would you be
[53:39] numbered there's only one way to do it
[53:42] not by joining a church but by being
[53:45] born into him and all the father has
[53:51] given me will come and no man can come
[53:54] except except my father calls
[53:58] him that's powerful
[54:00] Saints don't you see how real this is
[54:04] that that it's not something that you
[54:06] can just you know you can convince
[54:08] somebody into you need to you need to
[54:10] accept Christ you need to you you need
[54:12] to receive Christ we can we want people
[54:15] to receive Christ and our lives and our
[54:18] testimonies is something that we
[54:20] constantly are doing because we're
[54:23] Christians Christ is living living in
[54:25] and through us and what we're doing is
[54:27] we're looking for for all the rest of
[54:29] the Sons and Daughters of God to come
[54:31] into the body of Christ so that this can
[54:34] all finish up and fulfill the purpose
[54:36] and the plan of God but it's not
[54:38] something that we do it's something that
[54:41] he does he says all that the father hath
[54:44] given me will come we don't need to try
[54:47] and pull people into the
[54:49] church God is the one that opens the
[54:52] understanding and draws them he says the
[54:54] father father draws them the father
[54:58] pulls on them the father reveals himself
[55:00] to them just go back and look at your
[55:02] own experience how it is that you came
[55:04] to Christ it wasn't because somebody
[55:07] convinced you it's because he convinced
[55:10] you he revealed himself to you he made
[55:13] himself personal to you amen glory to
[55:15] God see that's all there is to it except

[55:28] begotten son and he's the same yesterday
[55:32] today and forever the
[55:34] word the word see believe him in this
[55:38] day the fullness of the Bible when those
[55:41] seven Mysteries back through those seven
[55:43] Church ages there were seven hidden
[55:46] mysteries now we're not going to get
[55:47] into all of that but you know God had a
[55:51] mystery right from before the
[55:53] foundations of the world and and that
[55:55] mystery is still unveiling itself and
[55:58] that mystery is what we're ministering
[56:00] on this morning that mystery of faith is
[56:03] what we're we're we're we're uh talking
[56:06] about this morning and that mystery is
[56:08] the body of Jesus Christ that's coming
[56:10] into its fullness in the day that we're
[56:13] living in so that we can fulfill the
[56:15] Rapture of the church amen praise God
[56:19] hallelujah glory to God so he bypassed
[56:23] and he looked and he saw us he saw you
[56:26] he saw that you would be the one that he
[56:29] would come to in that age and and and
[56:32] you accepted the light you know a lot of
[56:34] people they talk about oh I saw the
[56:36] light well what light did you see L
[56:39] listen do you know that there's only one
[56:41] light in this age right now in this time
[56:47] and season that we're living in the
[56:49] Gentiles there's a light to the Gentiles
[56:52] right now and do you know that that
[56:54] light is the message of this hour it is
[56:57] the message that God sent us a prophet
[57:00] to fulfill Malachi 4:5 it's it's the
[57:03] message that God sent us Revelations 10
[57:06] 1-7 that God sent us the seventh angel
[57:09] to come and to introduce the mighty
[57:11] Angel himself do you know that that that
[57:15] Revelation on the message of this hour
[57:17] if you miss that you're going to miss
[57:19] Christ in your day do you know that if
[57:22] they the the ones that followed John the
[57:25] Baptist and that heard what John the
[57:27] Baptist was telling the people that when
[57:29] he said I must decrease so that he can
[57:31] increase do you know that when he went
[57:33] off the scene and Jesus Christ started
[57:36] to increase that that the people there
[57:39] was only a handful that really
[57:41] recognized what was going
[57:43] on do do you see how important it is to
[57:47] recognize what it is that God is doing
[57:49] in our day that we're not to just get
[57:52] caught up into this Christmas spirit of
[57:54] gifts and giving and and and and uh you

[58:04] there's more to it the the true purpose
[58:07] of Christmas the real reason of
[58:09] Christmas is to recognize your day and
[58:12] its
[58:13] message there's nothing more powerful
[58:16] there's nothing greater there's nothing
[58:18] in this Christian dispensation this
[58:22] Gentile dispensation than to receive the
[58:25] message of this hour which is Christ
[58:28] being made flesh again in a people
[58:32] manifesting himself in a bride bringing
[58:34] a group of individuals attributes of God
[58:38] bringing them together to recognize that
[58:41] they are in the body of Christ who they

[1:00:36] me never mind following
[1:00:38] anybody you need to come to Christ you
[1:00:42] need to come to your own personal
[1:00:45] revelation of the word of God Christ in
[1:00:48] you made flesh amen listen I want to
[1:00:51] read here go to the next slide in Luke
[1:00:53] 24:
[1:00:55] 36-42 I want you to just picture this
[1:00:57] scene
[1:00:58] here now remember Christ was on the
[1:01:01] earth Christ was making himself known he
[1:01:04] was preaching he he he did he did The
[1:01:06] Sermon on the Mount he was Healing The
[1:01:09] Sick there was there was thousands of of
[1:01:11] people hundreds thousands of people that
[1:01:14] were being healed and raised even raised
[1:01:17] from the dead there was Miracle upon
[1:01:19] Miracle he was preaching his word but
[1:01:21] yet when it all came right down to it
[1:01:23] they took him to the cross they rejected
[1:01:26] him they they they chose Barnabas over
[1:01:29] Jesus Christ the word amen that's how
[1:01:32] that's how far from God the people were
[1:01:34] and they didn't realize it they were in
[1:01:37] a a reprobate condition they thought
[1:01:39] they were worshipping the Messiah they
[1:01:41] thought they were waiting on the Messiah
[1:01:43] and that he was going to come but yet he
[1:01:44] was right there in plain made flesh
[1:01:48] dwelt among them doing the sign he says
[1:01:50] if you don't believe me believe the
[1:01:52] signs but yet even even the signs they
[1:01:55] couldn't recognize they couldn't believe
[1:01:57] that it was actually him we've had so
[1:01:59] many signs in our day praise God and
[1:02:01] listen to Jesus he says and as they thus
[1:02:03] spake now here now Jesus raised from the
[1:02:05] dead Jesus himself stood in the midst of
[1:02:08] them and said unto them peace be unto
[1:02:11] you but they were
[1:02:13] terrified they were frightened imagine
[1:02:17] they would they were walking with Christ
[1:02:19] they heard him speak to him they
[1:02:21] listened to all the sermons but yet when
[1:02:22] he appeared to them in the day that he
[1:02:25] was revealing himself as the Risen
[1:02:28] Christ they were petrified they were
[1:02:30] afraid they didn't know what was going
[1:02:32] on and and and look and and suppose that
[1:02:35] they had seen a spirit and he said unto
[1:02:38] them why are you
[1:02:40] troubled why are you so troubled and why
[1:02:42] do do thoughts arise in your hearts
[1:02:45] behold my hands and my feet that it is I
[1:02:48] myself handle me and see for a spirit
[1:02:51] hath no Flesh and Bones as ye as ye see
[1:02:54] as ye see me have and when he had thus
[1:02:57] spoken he showed them his hands and his
[1:02:59] feet and while they yet believed
[1:03:04] not they were still
[1:03:07] disbelieving I'm just reading you the
[1:03:10] scriptures you could see all kinds of
[1:03:12] things you know you could witness
[1:03:15] Miracles all the the the the the miracle
[1:03:18] of the Virgin Mary in Portugal the
[1:03:21] miracle of Saint so and so over here the
[1:03:23] miracle of this and the Miracle of
[1:03:26] that but yet when Christ comes and
[1:03:30] really comes it's it's a shock to the
[1:03:34] people they still can't recognize and
[1:03:37] when he had spoken thus he showed them
[1:03:39] his hands and feet while they were yet
[1:03:40] they believed not for joy and wondered
[1:03:42] he said unto them have ye here any meat
[1:03:46] he was now he was getting carnal now he
[1:03:48] was coming right down to where they were
[1:03:49] he wanted to show them listen come on
[1:03:51] it's me I'm here you got some meat you
[1:03:54] got some fish you got something you know
[1:03:56] so that we can eat and they gave him a
[1:03:58] piece of broiled fish and what and
[1:04:02] honeycomb next slide and he took it and
[1:04:05] he did eat before them so if you're
[1:04:08] wondering on an offside shoot here now
[1:04:11] if you're wondering if we're going to
[1:04:12] have a big wedding supper in that three
[1:04:15] and a half years uh of of honeymoon when
[1:04:17] we go into the Rapture we're going to be
[1:04:19] enjoying some
[1:04:21] food you'll be able to eat and enjoy
[1:04:23] food
[1:04:24] again because you're wondering well man
[1:04:26] you know I'm going to have a
[1:04:27] supernatural body am I going to still be
[1:04:29] able to enjoy because everybody that's
[1:04:31] one thing around Christmas everybody
[1:04:33] enjoys food a little too
[1:04:36] much but these are the words which I
[1:04:39] spake unto you he was reminding them of
[1:04:42] the things that he had said while I was
[1:04:44] yet with you that all things must be
[1:04:47] fulfilled which were written in the law
[1:04:50] of Moses and in the in the prophets and
[1:04:52] in the Psalms concerning me me then
[1:04:55] opened he their understanding that they
[1:04:58] might understand the
[1:05:00] scriptures and this is something that
[1:05:03] that only God can do that only only only
[1:05:06] God can give you the door opening
[1:05:10] experience to where when you read the
[1:05:12] word you can understand the
[1:05:15] word how many remembers you know before
[1:05:19] the Lord gave you his his Spirit you
[1:05:21] know you'd look at the Bible and you'd
[1:05:23] start in Genesis and by the time you got
[1:05:25] through a couple of chapters you just
[1:05:27] you didn't know where you
[1:05:29] were and this you know this you know an
[1:05:34] it was all the ancest you know you're
[1:05:35] wondering what is this all about why do
[1:05:38] I need to know all of this but God was
[1:05:40] showing in there that you are part of
[1:05:42] that that ancestry that you are part of
[1:05:45] that inheritance that you are in that
[1:05:47] lineage that you have been in the mind
[1:05:50] of God from before the foundations of
[1:05:52] the world and he's got a great great
[1:05:54] plan for your life amen glory to God so
[1:05:57] he opened it up and said unto them thus
[1:05:59] it is written and thus it behooves
[1:06:02] Christ to suffer and to rise from the
[1:06:04] dead the third day and that repentance
[1:06:06] and remission of sins should be preached
[1:06:09] in his name among all nations beginning
[1:06:11] at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of
[1:06:14] these things and behold I send the
[1:06:17] promise of my father upon you now here's
[1:06:22] the gift here's now where he's he's
[1:06:25] giving the gift glory to God he says but
[1:06:29] T ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye
[1:06:32] be endued with power from on high so
[1:06:37] there is a stage in your ministry in
[1:06:40] your Christian walk where you need to be
[1:06:43] endued with power from on high you could
[1:06:46] have heard the prophet's messages you
[1:06:48] could have gone to Jeffersonville you
[1:06:50] could have read every one of those
[1:06:52] tracks you could have listen listen to
[1:06:54] every one of those tapes you could be in
[1:06:56] church every Sunday you could be you you
[1:06:59] could you could be in your prayer closet
[1:07:01] every single day but until the spirit of
[1:07:04] the Living God endues you with power to
[1:07:07] live this word until the spirit of God
[1:07:10] comes in you and reveals unto you who
[1:07:13] you are and your part in the word of God
[1:07:16] you're just another church pew member
[1:07:19] you're just another member of a church
[1:07:21] you're just another traditional Church
[1:07:24] goer that just believes that Christmas
[1:07:26] is a time to give gifts a time to just
[1:07:29] you know to to to be nice to one another
[1:07:31] a time to just give to the poor yes this
[1:07:34] is a time to do all of those things but
[1:07:37] it's so much greater than that when you
[1:07:40] personally come into that Revelation
[1:07:42] that God has given you the greatest gift
[1:07:45] amen God has given you the overcoming
[1:07:48] power God has given you the ability to
[1:07:51] overcome this age and all the
[1:07:53] Temptations of this age God is giving
[1:07:55] you a future to know that you shall be
[1:07:59] changed in this Mortal body that breaks
[1:08:01] down on a regular basis that you feel
[1:08:04] the aches and the pains from that God
[1:08:06] God's going to deliver you from that
[1:08:08] God's going to give you a brand new body
[1:08:10] God's given you gift Beyond human
[1:08:13] comprehension glory to God Amen thank
[1:08:16] you Jesus now let's go to next slide now
[1:08:21] this is just simple I told you I don't
[1:08:22] got anything I haven't got like a real
[1:08:24] deep message for you today I got a
[1:08:27] Christmas message I got something that I
[1:08:30] believe is the greatest gift the
[1:08:32] greatest Christmas gift that anybody
[1:08:34] could ever receive and if you don't go
[1:08:36] back to your ABCs and you don't
[1:08:38] recognize and those that are out there
[1:08:40] online that are listening in there's a
[1:08:42] way to get the greatest gift that you
[1:08:44] will ever receive and I promise you your
[1:08:46] life will change from today if you can
[1:08:49] receive this
[1:08:51] gift Hallelujah acts 2:30 7 to 239 he
[1:08:55] says now when they heard this now
[1:08:57] remember the the the the the 120 Jesus
[1:09:01] said now you go into Jerusalem and you
[1:09:03] wait now they were all together they
[1:09:05] were all in the upper room they were all
[1:09:08] waiting because they knew something was
[1:09:10] going to come to them that was going to
[1:09:12] take them to the next stage of not just
[1:09:15] being a a somebody that saw and somebody
[1:09:18] that can just give some testimonies of
[1:09:20] what they saw but now they would be ued
[1:09:23] with power
[1:09:24] so that when their life was endued with
[1:09:26] that power and you start to testify to
[1:09:28] your brothers you try you start to
[1:09:30] testify to your family you tell your
[1:09:32] friends your testimony there will be an
[1:09:34] anointing behind it that will draw you
[1:09:37] into the body of Christ that will draw
[1:09:40] them into the body of Christ listen it
[1:09:42] wasn't brother Gabriel that convinced me
[1:09:45] when I went to go buy furniture 30 years
[1:09:48] ago in his little shop there and he
[1:09:50] handed me a tape it wasn't brother
[1:09:53] Gabriel himself but in brother Gabriel
[1:09:56] there was a seed there was a there was
[1:09:58] an anointing there was an election there
[1:10:00] was something there that would be
[1:10:02] released and when you as a son or
[1:10:05] daughter of God is because you've been
[1:10:06] endued with the power of the holy spirit
[1:10:09] in this hour and you testify and you
[1:10:11] share about what God is doing in your
[1:10:14] day and and what he's done for you and
[1:10:16] what he's what he's doing in our church
[1:10:18] and in our ministry and how he's Healing
[1:10:20] The Sick and all we we all hear those
[1:10:23] things but when you speak it indued with
[1:10:25] the power of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:10:28] different people will know it's
[1:10:30] different they will either accept it or
[1:10:33] they will get afraid and they'll run
[1:10:35] from it because it'll it'll it'll try to
[1:10:37] pull them into a relationship with God
[1:10:40] where now they're going to be exposed
[1:10:41] I've had a lot of people tell me oh
[1:10:43] Danny you know you know man are you a
[1:10:47] preacher you know because you know they
[1:10:50] they they go like but Danny I need to to
[1:10:53] clean up my
[1:10:55] life I I I can't come to your church I
[1:10:58] need to clean up no I said no you got it
[1:11:00] all wrong that's not the way it works I
[1:11:04] was worse than
[1:11:06] you I needed him to do the work because
[1:11:09] I couldn't do the work and until I
[1:11:11] experienced that he could do that work I
[1:11:13] didn't know what I was really coming
[1:11:16] into so so when you testify and the
[1:11:19] power of God comes off of your testimony
[1:11:22] people's lives can be changed and
[1:11:24] transformed Hallelujah so here now they
[1:11:27] had received the power from on high the
[1:11:30] promise that Jesus gave them he says I'm
[1:11:32] going to Endo you with power I'm going
[1:11:34] to give you a gift that's going to
[1:11:36] change all of mankind going forward you
[1:11:40] are going to be my testimony into the
[1:11:43] End of the Age until we come together
[1:11:46] again and break bread and drink
[1:11:49] wine oh saints of God what a time and
[1:11:53] here now now these were the now picture
[1:11:55] this scene when they heard this they
[1:11:57] were pricked in their heart and they
[1:11:59] said unto Peter and to the rest of the
[1:12:01] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:12:04] do in other words we can see that you're
[1:12:07] full of the Holy Ghost we can see that
[1:12:09] there's something on you we can
[1:12:11] understand in our own language and yet
[1:12:14] you're speaking and everybody's
[1:12:16] understanding in their own language how
[1:12:17] is that possible there was a
[1:12:19] supernatural element around their
[1:12:22] testimony and there was will be one
[1:12:24] around your life around your testimony
[1:12:26] when you receive this gift amen and he
[1:12:29] says men and Brethren what shall we do
[1:12:31] and then
[1:12:32] Peter now remember Peter was
[1:12:35] present when Jesus came down and gave
[1:12:39] the Great Commission to go ye into all
[1:12:41] the world and preach this gospel tell
[1:12:45] them about this gospel and and he and
[1:12:48] Peter was right there when Jesus said go
[1:12:51] ye preach this gospel in the name of the
[1:12:54] father and of the son and of the Holy
[1:12:56] Ghost Peter knew very well exactly who
[1:13:00] was standing before him because Jesus
[1:13:04] one time asked him who do the people say
[1:13:05] that I am and he told him exactly who he
[1:13:08] was he was God Almighty made flesh amen
[1:13:11] that's what he told them Thou Art the
[1:13:13] Christ the son of the Living God you are
[1:13:15] the word made flesh in this hour I
[1:13:18] recognize you and so when when Jesus
[1:13:21] said in the name of the father and of
[1:13:22] the son and of the Holy Spirit Peter
[1:13:25] knew exactly what he was saying he knew
[1:13:28] exactly that everything that he would do
[1:13:30] from that point on would all be in the
[1:13:33] name of Jesus Christ and that's why when
[1:13:36] he when he said to them then Peter said
[1:13:39] unto them repent and be baptized right
[1:13:42] there there's the tank you know you know
[1:13:44] but I was baptized as a baby not valid
[1:13:48] not valid you cannot repent as a baby
[1:13:51] you cannot possibly uh know what you're
[1:13:54] doing as a baby somebody's just pouring
[1:13:57] water onto you or dunking you under the
[1:13:58] water without any Revelation without any
[1:14:01] faith of what it is that's taking place
[1:14:03] in your life Jesus said he that
[1:14:06] believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:14:11] saved so here he says repent be baptized
[1:14:14] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:14:17] Christ he didn't say in the name of the
[1:14:19] father and of the son because Peter knew
[1:14:22] very clearly that Jesus Christ was the
[1:14:26] Father the Son and the Holy
[1:14:30] Ghost it's just like when when when when
[1:14:32] Jesus was on the earth and Phil came to
[1:14:34] him and says Lord show us the father he
[1:14:36] says if you've seen me you've seen the
[1:14:38] father you're looking at him have I been
[1:14:42] so long with you you see and that's the
[1:14:44] greatest that's one of the greatest
[1:14:46] Revelations that you can have and that's
[1:14:48] one Revelation that 95% of the church
[1:14:51] world out there is missing
[1:14:53] can you believe that as simple and here
[1:14:56] it is right there simple right in the
[1:14:58] scripture you know be baptized in the
[1:15:00] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:15:02] of your sins and sin is unbelief and you
[1:15:06] shall receive the gift what gift the
[1:15:10] gift of the Holy Ghost that's the that's
[1:15:13] the the the the the I will Endo you with
[1:15:15] power I will give you something that
[1:15:18] will override every thing in your life
[1:15:21] when that comes into your life
[1:15:23] that song that we sang Justified never
[1:15:26] done it in the first place that power
[1:15:28] comes in and it takes away every sin it
[1:15:32] remits sin it removes Sin from your life
[1:15:35] it takes it completely out of your
[1:15:37] entire
[1:15:39] history Hallelujah sure the devil's
[1:15:42] going to play with your mind and remind
[1:15:44] you of the things that you did and even
[1:15:46] the things that you're doing but the
[1:15:48] power of the blood Jesus is not an
[1:15:50] Indian giver he's not going to give you
[1:15:52] something
[1:15:53] that's only going to be partly good and
[1:15:56] and it's got a time sensitive thing on
[1:15:58] it no there's no time sensitive because
[1:16:00] God is not dealing with time he's
[1:16:03] dealing with eternity he's not dealing
[1:16:06] with your time body he's dealing with
[1:16:08] your attribute that's in you he's
[1:16:10] calling it to its position Hallelujah
[1:16:13] glory to God but this thing gets in the
[1:16:15] way this thing wants to figure things
[1:16:17] out this thing wants to know that it
[1:16:19] needs to do something that that you know
[1:16:21] that it's missing out on something maybe
[1:16:23] missing that it needs to no there's
[1:16:25] nothing you need to do he said repent be
[1:16:28] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:30] Christ for the mission of your you shall
[1:16:31] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:16:33] This Promise is unto you to your
[1:16:35] children and to all that are a far off
[1:16:38] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:16:42] call hallelujah praise God forever more
[1:16:47] so there's step one in getting to that
[1:16:52] place where you can I remember I
[1:16:54] remember my my experience and and I
[1:16:57] believe that every son and daughter of
[1:16:58] God will will have that same experience
[1:17:01] that when they come into that
[1:17:02] understanding and that revelation of
[1:17:04] God's word they'll want to get to the
[1:17:07] water they're going to want to get to
[1:17:09] the water when Philip was telling the
[1:17:10] unic all about it and tell them about
[1:17:12] Jesus and the baptism and all those
[1:17:14] things they he he says where's where's
[1:17:17] there a pool of water I got to get to
[1:17:19] the water because I want I want the word
[1:17:22] to be fulfilled filled in my life I want
[1:17:25] to do it according to God's word because
[1:17:27] God will only honor his word amen praise
[1:17:30] God let's let's go to the next slide St
[1:17:33] John chapter 14 I want you to you know
[1:17:36] this these are things that we've read
[1:17:37] things that we've talked about but I
[1:17:39] want to remind you this morning I want
[1:17:41] to remind you of of this this incredible
[1:17:44] gift this Indescribable gift that God
[1:17:46] has given us it brings us into a
[1:17:48] relationship with him and he says and I
[1:17:49] will pray the father and he shall give
[1:17:52] you another comforter he's talking about
[1:17:55] the Holy Ghost here that he may abide
[1:17:59] with you forever even the spirit of
[1:18:02] Truth whom the world cannot
[1:18:06] receive you know how many times I've you
[1:18:08] know you testify and you know you want
[1:18:10] to you know share it with the people and
[1:18:13] you know step one is that they need to
[1:18:15] know that God has a provided way God God
[1:18:18] unveils his word and and and you know
[1:18:21] that if somebody is an act attribute of
[1:18:23] God you don't have to worry God will
[1:18:26] awaken that attribute it's God that
[1:18:28] calls the attribute but it's the
[1:18:32] scripture you know Faith cometh by
[1:18:35] hearing do you know that you cannot
[1:18:37] communicate with God through your five
[1:18:40] senses I don't care how much you try to
[1:18:42] communicate with God through your five
[1:18:43] senses you're not g to but he
[1:18:45] communicates to you through the five
[1:18:48] senses how by
[1:18:51] faith by hearing the word that's why we
[1:18:55] we we feed on the word of God and God's
[1:18:57] spirit rides the word it comes into you
[1:19:00] the Revelation awakens in you and now
[1:19:03] you please God now you're communicating
[1:19:06] to God by Revelation you can only
[1:19:08] communicate with God by faith not with
[1:19:11] this because there's a lot of people
[1:19:13] that can speak and pray longer than you
[1:19:16] and more eloquent than you but if if if
[1:19:18] there isn't Faith behind that word God
[1:19:21] doesn't hear it
[1:19:23] he says without faith it's impossible to
[1:19:26] please me amen so he says here even the
[1:19:29] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:19:31] receive because it seeth him not neither
[1:19:34] knoweth him but ye know him for he
[1:19:37] dwelleth with you and shall be in you I
[1:19:42] will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:19:45] come to you yet a little while and the
[1:19:48] world seeth me no more but ye see me
[1:19:51] because I live he shall live
[1:19:54] also at that day which
[1:19:57] day what day he's talking about that day
[1:20:02] he's talking about that day in your life
[1:20:04] in your walk when you come into that
[1:20:06] into that personal understanding of
[1:20:08] Christ where you come into that
[1:20:10] relationship with him on that day ye
[1:20:13] shall know that I am in the father ye in
[1:20:15] me and I in you hallelujah praise God
[1:20:20] bless the name of the Lord that's the
[1:20:23] only way that we can that we can come to
[1:20:26] Christ and know that we've come know
[1:20:28] that we've that that that we're doing
[1:20:30] what what is essential you know uh
[1:20:34] people just go to church and they don't
[1:20:36] have that that that process and that
[1:20:39] Avenue given to them and shown to them
[1:20:42] but that's why we're here that's why
[1:20:44] we're here we're here to testify of how
[1:20:46] God lit our light how he he lit our
[1:20:50] candle how he brought us into our
[1:20:52] relationship with him glory to God next
[1:20:55] slide Colossians 1:25 to 27 he says
[1:20:58] whereof
[1:21:00] I now Paul speaking here to the
[1:21:02] Colossians he says whereof I am made a
[1:21:06] minister according to the dispensation
[1:21:08] of God we need to see here clearly that
[1:21:11] God has dispensations God has timing God
[1:21:15] has a time for each and every son and
[1:21:18] daughter of God to be called and placed
[1:21:20] into the word of God Amen which is given
[1:21:23] to me for you to fulfill the word of God
[1:21:27] even the mystery listen there's a
[1:21:29] mystery here that's being unveiled amen
[1:21:32] which hath been hid from ages and from
[1:21:35] Generations but now Paul understood that
[1:21:38] now was the time now was the body of
[1:21:41] Christ coming together because Christ
[1:21:43] had given up the ghost the spirit now
[1:21:46] was being made available to the people
[1:21:48] God was building the body of Christ God
[1:21:50] was going to build a gentile Church
[1:21:52] church God was going to put together the
[1:21:55] bride of Christ so that all could be
[1:21:57] restored listen to him he says but now
[1:21:59] is made manifest to his Saints to whom
[1:22:02] God would make known what is the riches
[1:22:05] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:22:08] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[1:22:13] of glory whom we preach warning every
[1:22:16] man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:22:19] that we may present every man and
[1:22:23] perfect in
[1:22:26] Christ imagine how can you possibly be
[1:22:30] perfect I know for a fact there's a lot
[1:22:33] of imperfections in my life there's
[1:22:36] absolutely no way that anybody in this
[1:22:38] church this morning could say I'm
[1:22:42] perfect but
[1:22:45] Christ wants you to
[1:22:47] know that the part of you that is
[1:22:51] him the part of you that is him is
[1:22:56] perfect and that you have come into the
[1:22:59] mystical body of Jesus Christ by a
[1:23:02] divine revelation and there's no other
[1:23:04] way that you're going to come and that
[1:23:06] is the gift the gift of faith it's it's
[1:23:09] Revelation Saints it's the only thing
[1:23:11] that brings us into go to the next slide
[1:23:14] for by grace are you saved through I
[1:23:17] want to uh go to the next Slide by by
[1:23:20] grace are ye saved through faith I want
[1:23:24] you to replace that word and say
[1:23:27] Revelation it's Revelation that's what
[1:23:31] has given you the relationship with
[1:23:33] Christ that's what's brought you into
[1:23:35] that personal and that not of yourselves
[1:23:37] but what is it it's the greatest gift
[1:23:40] that God could ever give you it's the
[1:23:43] greatest Christmas gift that he could
[1:23:44] ever give you as a Son of God next slide
[1:23:48] brother bradam says here in the anointed
[1:23:49] times he says what is Faith he he says
[1:23:52] faith is something that's revealed to
[1:23:55] you that is not yet but you believe it
[1:24:01] will be it's something that's revealed
[1:24:04] to you the Rapture is a revelation that
[1:24:06] God has revealed to you it's not yet but
[1:24:09] it's going to happen and you know it's
[1:24:11] going to happen because you're already
[1:24:13] being changed you're already being being
[1:24:16] uh uh transformed your life is getting
[1:24:19] better and better in
[1:24:21] Christ Hallelujah faith is a revelation
[1:24:25] of the will of God so by Revelation amen
[1:24:29] praise God the next
[1:24:32] slide as we wind it down now Faith is
[1:24:36] the substance of things hoped for the
[1:24:39] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[1:24:42] the elders obtained a good report
[1:24:44] through faith we understand that the
[1:24:46] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:24:49] that things which are seen were not made
[1:24:52] made of things which do appear
[1:24:56] hallelujah praise God forever more
[1:24:59] listen to brother brandom here in works
[1:25:01] is Faith expressed now Faith is a
[1:25:04] revelation from God now Faith is a
[1:25:07] revelation there's where I want to stay
[1:25:10] there just a moment it's a revelation he
[1:25:13] has revealed it to you by his grace it's
[1:25:16] nothing you did you didn't work yourself
[1:25:19] up into Faith you you you ever have
[1:25:23] faith it's given you by the grace of
[1:25:26] God it's something that God freely gives
[1:25:29] but it's the one that he's the one that
[1:25:31] decides to give it he's the one that
[1:25:34] opens and no man can shut he's the one
[1:25:36] that shuts and no man can open you don't
[1:25:39] have to try and and force anybody to
[1:25:41] receive it he says and God reveals it to
[1:25:43] you therefore by therefore faith is a
[1:25:46] revelation and look what he says and the
[1:25:48] whole church the whole Church of God is
[1:25:52] built upon Revelation this ministry is
[1:25:56] built upon Revelation this is not just
[1:25:59] an ordinary Ministry Good Neighbor
[1:26:01] Ministries is not just another Christian
[1:26:04] Church in Burlington Ontario I want to
[1:26:06] make that clear this church is built
[1:26:09] upon Divine spiritual Revelation where
[1:26:12] God personally speaks to each and every
[1:26:16] individual when we come under this this
[1:26:19] uh this order of service and the
[1:26:21] minister stands before us here and
[1:26:23] ministers the word of God we are under
[1:26:26] expectation like the children of Israel
[1:26:28] that when Moses spoke Moses was speaking
[1:26:31] the mind of God speaking the word of God
[1:26:34] giving the children what they had need
[1:26:36] of God was supernaturally dropping Mana
[1:26:39] from Heaven well that was all a type God
[1:26:41] is doing that right now right here
[1:26:44] whenever we gather together it's because
[1:26:46] we come under a
[1:26:47] supernatural leadership of the spirit of
[1:26:50] God and that God speaks to us Us lip to
[1:26:52] ear God knows what we did last week God
[1:26:56] knows what we have in mind of doing this
[1:26:58] week God is aware of your sickness God
[1:27:01] is aware of your relationship problems
[1:27:03] God knows everything that you have need
[1:27:06] of but there's only one way that you're
[1:27:07] going to receive that Deliverance it's
[1:27:09] going to come by the preaching of the
[1:27:11] word because Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:27:14] by hearing of God's word hallelujah
[1:27:17] praise God listen and the Revelation is
[1:27:19] the only thing revelation of the word
[1:27:23] what is what is a revelation Jesus said
[1:27:25] Upon This Rock I'll build my church when
[1:27:28] he was talking to Peter and Peter said
[1:27:31] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:27:32] Living God Jesus looked to him and he
[1:27:34] said Flesh and Blood didn't teach this
[1:27:37] to you Peter this is not something that
[1:27:40] you got by going to theology school or
[1:27:42] something that you got by going to
[1:27:44] Sunday school or by being a part of your
[1:27:46] parents' church or by being a part of
[1:27:48] your aunt's church or your uncle's
[1:27:50] church this is something that God
[1:27:52] himself comes to you as an individual
[1:27:55] and he says I'm going to build my church
[1:27:57] this way I'm going to call every son and
[1:28:00] daughter of God that way and when they
[1:28:02] come together they shall know their God
[1:28:06] and they shall do great exploits because
[1:28:08] they have come into the
[1:28:10] supernatural anointed Ministry in the
[1:28:13] body of Jesus Christ amen he says here
[1:28:16] he says I'll build my church in the
[1:28:17] Gates of Hell listen I don't care if
[1:28:20] you're a son or a daughter of God and
[1:28:21] you've got Revelation you know where you
[1:28:23] stand this morning you know exactly
[1:28:26] where you're standing you know exactly
[1:28:28] where you are you know that the devil
[1:28:29] he's going to hit you left right and
[1:28:32] center but why do you keep coming back
[1:28:34] what keeps you getting up after you get
[1:28:37] beat down what do you think that is
[1:28:39] that's what God placed in you that's
[1:28:42] what God awakened in you that you're an
[1:28:44] attribute of God and that there's no way
[1:28:46] that the devil can deceive you somebody
[1:28:49] come along and say hey come to my church
[1:28:51] we got better programs we got better
[1:28:54] this we got we got a lot more people
[1:28:56] than
[1:28:57] you like people had to do with
[1:29:01] it I remember there was only a dozen
[1:29:04] according to the word of God that
[1:29:05] followed Jesus in his day and if there
[1:29:08] was only a dozen back then can you
[1:29:10] imagine today when here we've got we've
[1:29:13] got thousands of different denominations
[1:29:15] we've got all kinds of different
[1:29:17] teachings it's going to take a
[1:29:20] supernatural experience you're not going
[1:29:23] to find Salvation in joining a church or
[1:29:26] being a member your only salvation is in
[1:29:29] the body of Jesus Christ and there's
[1:29:31] only one way that you can get into that
[1:29:34] body you got to be born again by the
[1:29:37] spirit of God your old life has to die
[1:29:40] completely and you've got to enter into
[1:29:42] the newness of Christ amen hallelujah he
[1:29:46] says the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[1:29:48] against it faith is a revelation because
[1:29:50] faith has been revealed to you able by
[1:29:54] faith offered by Revelation Faith he
[1:29:58] keeps repeating here offered to God a
[1:30:01] more excellent sacrifice than that of
[1:30:03] Cain Cain came with with fruits Cain he
[1:30:06] didn't have a revelation that it was by
[1:30:08] the
[1:30:09] blood you know a lot of people don't
[1:30:11] know that what is it that Cain did that
[1:30:15] was different he offered unto God he
[1:30:17] made a sacrifice unto God he brought the
[1:30:19] best fruits the best flowers
[1:30:22] the best of everything that he grew
[1:30:24] probably his best tomatoes and potatoes
[1:30:26] and everything
[1:30:27] else but Abel was given a revelation of
[1:30:32] the blood that it would need that that
[1:30:34] it would need a sacrifice that something
[1:30:37] would have to die that would that would
[1:30:39] have to replace that would have to stand
[1:30:41] in his his place he knew that it would
[1:30:44] have to be blood and he knew that Jesus
[1:30:46] Christ his father had revealed it to him
[1:30:49] because by faith Abel made an acceptable
[1:30:52] sacrifice what was it God went to him
[1:30:55] and says the Lamb of God is going to be
[1:30:58] coming 4,000 years down the road you're
[1:31:02] going to make this sacrifice unto me and
[1:31:04] I'm going to accept it you see it was
[1:31:06] revealed to him what he should do and
[1:31:09] then he lived it he manifested it and it
[1:31:12] pleased God Amen no other way praise God
[1:31:16] let the musicians come listen to Listen
[1:31:18] to uh the anointed ones in the in the
[1:31:22] end time brother BR says and the only
[1:31:24] way that one that that was received
[1:31:27] could have done anything different from
[1:31:29] his brother it was revealed to him he's
[1:31:31] talking about Cain and Abel for the
[1:31:33] Bible said by faith Hebrews 11 by faith
[1:31:36] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[1:31:40] sacrifice than of Cain which God
[1:31:43] testified he was righteous God was
[1:31:46] showing Jesus said the spiritual
[1:31:48] revelation of who he was who does man
[1:31:52] say I the son of man am he said Peter
[1:31:54] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:31:57] Living God blessed art thou Simon
[1:31:59] Hallelujah he says Upon This Rock I'll
[1:32:01] build my Church the true revelation of
[1:32:03] the word this is the true vine again
[1:32:06] Hallelujah this is the true vine now ye
[1:32:09] are the branches I'm the vine you are
[1:32:10] the branches God is is is coming into a
[1:32:14] church once again to unleash his faith
[1:32:17] into a body re revealing himself making
[1:32:20] himself known giving you instruction and
[1:32:23] positioning within the word of God and
[1:32:25] the body of Christ to know who you are
[1:32:27] and your part in the word listen here in
[1:32:29] the Rapture he says but to the church
[1:32:32] the bride the Rapture is a
[1:32:34] revelation if you're in the body of
[1:32:36] Christ there's a Rapture Revelation that
[1:32:38] you are now feasting on and everything
[1:32:41] that we preach everything that you read
[1:32:44] everything that you feed on is giving
[1:32:47] you faith for the Rapture it's giving
[1:32:50] you rapturing faith it's giving you a
[1:32:52] supernatural understanding on the word
[1:32:54] of God that goes beyond your own
[1:32:56] thoughts your own ideas he says it's
[1:32:59] revealed to her that the Revelation the
[1:33:02] true bride of Christ will be waiting for
[1:33:05] that revelation of the Rapture now it is
[1:33:08] a revelation for the Revelation is Faith
[1:33:12] glory to God you cannot have a
[1:33:14] revelation without it being faith faith
[1:33:18] is a revelation I know I'm driving this
[1:33:20] home but I want everybody to know about
[1:33:24] this great gift that God has given us I
[1:33:27] believe it's the greatest Christmas gift
[1:33:30] that we could have ever possibly
[1:33:32] received of God hallelujah glory to God
[1:33:36] let's read our last slide as we close it
[1:33:39] says here in 1 John 5:4 he says for for
[1:33:43] whosoever is born of God overcometh the
[1:33:48] world that's what we were talking about
[1:33:50] here all morning about the New Birth
[1:33:53] about the revelation of who you are
[1:33:56] about the faith that you need to take
[1:33:58] the Rapture about a supernatural church
[1:34:01] that is now coming together a mystical
[1:34:04] body a supernatural body the literal
[1:34:07] body of Jesus Christ you know that you
[1:34:09] are the literal body of Jesus Christ you
[1:34:12] say no it's just the attribute no in
[1:34:15] that body that you live in that you are
[1:34:17] walking in that you are talking through
[1:34:19] that you are living through that is now
[1:34:21] God's possession you are the body of
[1:34:24] Christ when you assemble yourselves you
[1:34:26] think you know oh I don't need to go to
[1:34:28] church yeah you need to go to church the
[1:34:30] body of Believers needs to come together
[1:34:33] needs to come into the unity of the
[1:34:34] faith needs to recognize and and and and
[1:34:37] overcome each other's faults and and
[1:34:40] each other's weaknesses and each other's
[1:34:42] strengths all those things because it's
[1:34:44] all part of you being perfected for the
[1:34:48] for the Rapture you being perfected into
[1:34:50] the body of Jesus Christ remember this
[1:34:52] body that you're in right now though it
[1:34:55] is not going to inherit the kingdom of
[1:34:57] God God said he's going to change it
[1:34:59] he's going to change it in a moment in
[1:35:01] the twinkling of an eye and God
[1:35:03] overcometh the world for whosoever is
[1:35:06] born of God overcometh the world and
[1:35:08] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:35:10] world even
