TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but God just sits back and says he was gonna call somebody else to preach Wednesday night it was gonna be this video looking for excuses because the arrows fight that was was it for this idea for that side Oh what are you gonna do what when you can't do nothing I can do absolutely nothing I totally never comes the time that I come up here think you know I got something unless I tell you that I have something Lord but if I come to bring some kind of history or something the hidden mysteries Christ Himself coming down fast amen and how he's doing it his warrants say you can impersonate this no well we were experiencing right now right here sink another person in this because he said very I can figure what it is that these people constantly Halloween because he cannot receive revelation this is a mr. this is what brother Brett was talking about he says the mystery you know you look at Ephesians talks about the mystery of the fellowship well this is it what we're experiencing is the mystery of the fellowship of the sons and daughters of God coming together and when you get into an experience with God [Music] [Music] it's the part of the word that you are that represented you from before the foundations of the world you cannot be beaten you cannot be deceived you cannot that's why Jesus people he was he knew exactly who he was we stood there before all those Pharisees and Sadducees and said father because they did exactly what the word said it would never pass but he knew a son of God cannot sin he knew that there's this there's no way that you can sit as an attribute of God you are sinners because it's the part of God that you are that's what God is positionally please oh look at yourself I don't have this I'm not very good at that though look at that's colonel see the attribute of God that's in you that's who you really are that's what has overcoming power that's the one that's greater that's in you it's in he that it's greater the one that's in use really the events in the world that's what it's not you you don't have anything but you've been anointed for before the foundations of the world to manifest a son or a daughter of God and this is what you are consciously coming into this is what that spiritual amnesia that gets lifted from your life brings you into it brings you into recognizing before the fall and this is what we're PB snort back to we are being restored back to from before fall where we were two terminal sons and daughters of God there's potentials in that position in that sonship in that daughter ship they could speak the verb and the elements would have to obey because they were given supreme authority we are now being restored back to this Sunday of the ministering again so please keep it in Brereton we're going to be moving into that realm we're going to be seeking the Lord into this area of how it is that be as sons and daughters of God would sure to a place where we can speak the Word of God not just speaking out that's not what we're talking about it's coming into a revelation of who you are and that when you're in your decision something takes place something supernatural starts to speak out of you and starts to place others it's this is a body movement this is the manifestation of the sons of God the adoption is all about placing it's all about you know if you go back into the Old Testament you look back Josh he came into the promised land you will notice that everything from that point on was alcohol the placing of the tribes of Israel giving each one their position what it was that they were doing and every mother that brought forth that child actually was in birth pains that she was bringing for that child an inspiration a revelation would strengthen their heart and their names would be spoken which actually positionally placed and gave them the character the and the ability to be what it was that they were supposed to be that's all part of the placing of the body of Christ of the placing of the sons and daughters of God and this is what we're coming into we talked about we've read it we've studied it in the past but there there has to come a season where it comes into season into its present stage isn't into the present stage of its ministry and where individuals now begin to read how about how is actually operating around their lives how to become conscious of it because perfect faith is what you can consciously recognize what the Holy Spirit is doing in your life to affect the body of Christ we don't want to go too much further let the musicians come we're gonna close it off here but tonight was how it is that God is building the body and love building the body and love because of that relationship because we've come into that relationship it's a it's a different purpose it gives you different motivation for coming to church it should get you excited about about your purpose in being here and being a part of this ministry at this time this you're a part of this ministry at this time it's not a coincidence it's not listen everything isn't the perfect plan of God you may have been in another Church five years ago you may have it in another city five years ago but then you find yourself here God has a purpose for that you want to recognize that is because God God needs to fulfill his word and you're a part of that word and you can't miss it and there's no way he's gonna let you miss it you can't miss it if you [Music] [Music] [Music]
