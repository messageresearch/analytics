to deal with us every one we live in this day when every person gift of god has to find its place and is finding its place and for the others as it was back then the scripture says and there was no place found for them there was no fit uh the jigsaw apostle when the prophet said it was put together they found out when he looked again it was the face of jesus christ christ revealed in his own word but if you end up with a piece that can't fit then it just doesn't come to the puzzle like that right you just got to leave it alone praise the lord god is good let me assure you that our study tonight will be very brief and that is definitely because uh it that's the way it is in the church age book and i'm just doing that by installations and staying with exactly what the prophet of god has said praise the lord so god bless you thank you for being here through the damp dark cold night of winter praise god hallelujah but we are canadians and nobody ever really get used to the cold but you manage the cold you just manage it you can never get used to it it's all relative praise god uh revelation chapter 3 verse 21 amen hallelujah oh my uh i remember uh going to being in my old country and i visited a mother of a friend who was still out here but she was then living by herself so he asked me to look her up you know and see how she's doing and when i got there she was cooking so she knows me from back home so she just said why come sit in the kitchen and while i'm here cooking and thing you know so she is cooking away and while she's cooking cut up the vegetables and everything else and put in the in the pan that she had there and then somebody came by at the same time knocking on her door and she turned and talked to them come in and then she's talking to them and she turned back to the and you know because she kept doing like this she said what in the world is going on here she's feeling for the stew and it's gone down from this it's gone right now well the same thing happens with the church [Laughter] right it's coming down to the real thing right the real thing that is not to say as i've said that those who may not still be physically represented here with us are not of the word that's not what i'm saying at all i'm just saying to you that god has it that way each one has to take their own path you got to take their own way praise god if god wants them outside for a reason because i've known brothers who've got outside people said oh they're backslid go out there end up in a bar end up in a bar and while in the bar witness to somebody and then go back to the bar another time and a sinner turned back and says you know you shouldn't be here [Laughter] now you tell me what that is you shouldn't be here somebody like you no no no no you don't fit in here glory to god you see you can run but you can't hide glory to god so we come to a real time of the real um personal liberty that the lord gives us that we are free in jesus christ and it brings out your colors it brings out right where you're standing at and this form of christianity which we all were uh involved in where um really all your things it's just all covered up you can't you're not really yourself you you feel tired you you feel this way you feel that way you got this problem that problem you just keep it to yourself you're covered up no no you're free praise the lord so thank the lord for that liberty and freedom that is in jesus christ because you're subject not to the pastor but to the word you're subject to the pastor only as a person put here to represent the lord jesus christ but you are really subject to the word because jesus christ the pastor and then the authority goes down down down right that's how it goes praise the lord hallelujah god bless you let's read the word of god to him that overcome it will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne gracious father we have read your words now we pray that the word will live again may the spirit of almighty god come among us in his wonderful beautiful quiet way and oh god speak to us from the written word that we may hear understand and live in the name of jesus christ amen and amen praise the lord hallelujah god bless you please be seated we're speaking on this topic of the overcomers throne the overcomers throne not the great white throne but the overcomers throne the question is asked what are we to overcome what are we to overcome and this is the normal question that anybody will ask what are we to overcome however this scripture is being presented in such a way as not to query or to ask us what we had to overcome it expects you by this time to know or to have some understanding of what you're supposed to overcome but it is more uh oppressing matter of how are we to overcome what we are supposed to overcome how are we to overcome this is the question that is here before us amen brother branham says now it doesn't matter what we are to overcome as long as we know how to overcome it amen doesn't matter what you have to overcome as long as you know how to overcome it see how then can we overcome well jesus been our example he says just look and see how the lord jesus overcome how did he overcome in and we will know how we will be able to overcome for this will bring out the truth of the proposition that he's making right here it will bring out the truth of the proposition matthew chapter 4. he says you know the temptations that jesus faced being tempted by the devil and every one of us knows because he said it if he's going to be tested he's going to be persecuted if he is going to be tried if he is going to be put into those positions he says any servant are you greater than your lord you're going to be tested too you're going to be tried to you've got to be proven by the word like we mentioned on sunday how that god allowed us to come from his mind is thought down here praise god hallelujah so that we can go on a journey and on that journey he will be proving his word he taped it out by israel when they went into the wilderness and all the trials that they had he said i took them to go into the wilderness because i wanted to try them and prove them hallelujah proving his word so is it today you might have a two million come out and come into the church but the journey is to try them and to prove them let the spirit of god try and prove by the various things that will come into their lives they'll have the choice to be proven by him praise the lord you see jesus was tempted of the devil and he overcome personal temptations of the devil by the word he put the emphasis here personal temptation now as you remember the scripture it says that jesus was tempted with every single temptation you common to man just just just expanding your own mind and thoughts what that tells you he that's why the bible says he was completely theologians will say he was a very man completely man but yet he was completely god amen but as a man the bible says he was tempted with every form of temptation that he might be a high priest that can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities our weaknesses our weaknesses our failures it's not god is in the heavens he's so holy that he doesn't know what you're going through the queen is in our palace the king is in his palace he doesn't know what the common person is going through no dumb from his glory of a living story our god and savior came and jesus was his name to walk among his subjects and the bible says to be tempted to betrayed that he might no praise god hallelujah you say oh god didn't know well you must understand that while he was god us in the form of god elohim there was no there's none above him there's none below him there's none beside him nobody was there ever to tell him what to do or tell him go here or go there so he had to come down here to be able to experience that years ago i preached on that message learning obedience bible says in philippians how that he came that he might learn obedience hallelujah just think god in the head was not a soul there is no being nothing above him nobody to tell him do this do but he come down and come a child in mary's and joseph care so that he could be told what to do not because he didn't know what to do but he wanted to know how we feel how how we what we go through whatever whatever temptation trial you can think about he experienced it so that as a doctor assault doctor he will know exactly how you feel emotionally physically spiritually in every aspect of your life he is fully conscious of what you are going through what if or he was tempted by the devil satan see with personal temptation praise god personal is trying to bring out the truth which can't be expressed in word here but it was direct for that person hallelujah is praise god so you must understand that your temptations oh praise god hallelujah they're personal to you brother they're personal to you uh when i said that what i thought about is how google and all these companies right now are watching what you interested in on the internet what you look at what you listen to what you look at whatever whatever your search you made and they're keeping a copy of that and so they know your profile and they know exactly what pictures what words what everything to put on that internet to attract your attention to tempt you to buy uh their soap soap that they're selling or or buy their food or buy something they know exactly what to put to get your attention and that is what you call personalized by analytics they personalize it right down to you the individual now we know of course that satan is the master of that because this is what the word here is telling us that he comes not just with any random temptation well all human beings respond this way or all human beings no no no no he's gone deeper than that and he's come down to the person and how they act right because he got the army of what the bible calls familiar spirits and of course if you understand familiar spirits they don't do nothing else they're just watching you i'm reporting back well you've done this he done that she done this she done that you've done that that's all they do they're watchers they're listeners and they watch everything brother batman said that that's why i don't just say anything before i do it you know because they're running back and forth like that right so that's where we are to and fro to and fro that's all they do for that devil's in the air he's a prince of the power of the air praise god and this they employ this personalized means of temptation but he overcome the personal temptations of satan he overcome them no matter what the devil threw at him no matter if he has a bucket full or a ball full the words he overcome the prophet said but how did he overcome by the word hallelujah every time he came to him see with three major trials and those trials they correspond exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden amen see what he had is what they had but listen to this i see here that in the garden man was called ruler with god on the earth core ruler with god on the earth and woman was called ruler with the man on the earth but then sin caused them to lose their rulership you know all the scriptures where he says you know whatever you say that's what it's going to be you know you tell the tree you tell this whatever you know you have all the powers over everything but here they they lost their call their core rulership so jesus or god became a man that he might undergo the same tests trials and temptations that they had and as their representative could overcome that and free the rest of us that we might go back to that position of core rulership that we have with god hallelujah what were the temptations you know them the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life and you just gotta look around you watch the tv listen and those are the same three things the devil is pouring them out right now pouring them out left right and center again but this is not to test jesus back there on the top of the mountain but it's to test the bride hallelujah the son of man being revealed again and he is tested when he gets to the top of the mountain he's like oh i've got it now i i really got the message i got the word i'm gonna go praise god yes but my friends the giants are in the land the temptations are in the land the devil is in the land and you've got to be on top of the word because that's the only way you will be able to overcome as by the word he applied the word you must supply the word he gave the devil the word test you give him the word death hallelujah that's the only way that we will be able to overcome hallelujah you see he fell and he repeats she felt a personal temptation of satan i want to emphasize that personal temptation not group temptation right you see all human beings because all human beings do have certain common things that we are is commonplace to all of us that we respond to because we are human but other than that we come down to individuality and each one is an individual we don't even like the same colors that one another likes we may happen we may happen to like the same color like the other person we may happen to like the same uh ice cream you know or have the same taste in something but we are not the same we all got likes and dislikes that are totally different and that is what satan knows and he zeroes in on that you see he said so eve fell under personal temptation in the garden of eden see she fell by failing to use the word adam fell he fell in disobedience to the word of god amen but jesus didn't fall he overcame by the word praise god how can we overcome how shall we overcome standing on the lord we overcome by the world we have come by jesus christ in us we ever come he said how can you overcome you overcome by him who has already overcome that lives in you and your works your cease from your works and he the overcomer the lion of the tribe of judah the mighty conqueror he does the overcoming for you through you paul said i thank god that the power of god worketh in me mightily amen not by works what we have done but by his mercy by his grace or his love that we overcome oh blessed be the name of the lord god hallelujah amen go rulership amen my friends i tell you we are in this age we are tested we are tempted we are on the personal temptation my reaction to the spirit of this age may be different to your reaction the the spirit of this age of leodisia is testing every single one of us in its own way we are being tested like that we have been tested not only by the spirit of the age but by the sins of the age every age you understand uh has a major sin a major thing that moved it but we have down into the nordician church age where we are under the temptations of all of the seven deadly sins because all of them compiled now brother branham puts it this way if we go to it personalizing it all them demons that were in them egyptians that got drowned in that red sea go down there to babylon with nebuchadnezzar and them down there again oh my he said when they get they come right down and they end up with hitler right i'm just jumping over things and they end up there again oh my and see now when they got killed off many of them they're gonna scatter and gone to this country gone to that country but the same devils he says just like how god takes his man but not the spirit that was on the man the same way those devils come off the is look for another body look for another person to attempt to influence to manipulate and to move that's what is happening right now oh my brother sister so we see that we all become what tempted by the pressures the perils of this age not one of us can escape it how you gonna be a son if you don't allow yourself to be chastened you don't allow yourself to be tried matter of fact when you start to counter it all joy that you're going through the fiery trials for the trying your fate work and patience because it is identifying to you that god cares for you and he recognizes you as a son a child a daughter you're one of his or he won't even chase on you he won't even worry with you the devil's already got you you're on himself so he will look but he wants to shape you he wants to bring you up the way he wants you to be amen he wants us to act like jesus who was uh you know a representation of the wave shift of who we should be like amen so you allow this precious to come and problems to come your way amen oh my goodness you say good problems my lord if you see the end then you will understand what it is to have a good problem you know job couldn't understand his wife couldn't understand but job looked beyond the problem and he saw the end of it and he said behold very deeply oh praise god and that's how the believer you must start out not seeing the end of the problem you may start that way you'll be frustrated like anybody else again not seeing the end but as you pray as you walk as you wait the holy spirit will make known to you and you still you have a shout of victory even before the thing comes to pass hallelujah praise god hallelujah amen so they failed on the personal temptation but jesus christ overcame my personal temptation you see he had to overcome because there was nothing that satan could put on him you know he was like a teflon there's nothing nothing could stick to him the bible says in all points tried tested tempted and not found not once not once hallelujah total complete overcomer you see prophet said you understand satan knew the word and he even caught into the word to jesus in the temptation did not the lord says you throw yourself down either angels will bear you up he quoted the word to him to make him disobey the word is that right hallelujah if you fall the angels will do that but not go top of a mountain and throw yourself out off committing to recite and then the oh jesus should have saved me no no or daniel jump in the fire so therefore i'm going to jump in the fire and prove god no he didn't tell you to jump in the fire he told danielle to go in the fire praise god if he told you then he'll be with you is that right but he didn't tell you and that's what a lot of christian thinks a lot of christians think that way and that's the pentecostal mentality because he said thou shalt drink any deadly thing it shall not harm thee give me that bottle of poison there nothing can happen to me you'll die you'll die like anybody else you see oh i can go there and covet won't do me nothing maybe god will allow you to you know pass through like like myself you know there in africa and passing take a taxi and driving to the refugee camp you know and uh driving in this road through the desert and trees are around but not big trees and the mountains on both sides stopping this big tall huge ants nest and i'm saying like tall like the top of this roof of this building big mess right those are the kind of ants when they see their march they're clearing an area right so we passed right through when we got to the um and the gentleman says oh so uh how did you come where is your your outriders or your protector because usually you don't come unless you got guards and you know soldiers or police with guns to protect you because you have robbers murderers robbers called turkanas that come down off of those hills and you know they just kill everybody like that and we pass through and we always laugh when we talk about it because we said those men must look off the mountain nobody that's stupid why would they stop and looking at aunt ness and looking at a real camel to see what it is and that and this got to be a drop and they must have thought this was some kind of a trap and maybe waiting for them to charge them and then the army is going to move in so they didn't make any move you know the next day they shot up an entire bus on the same route an entire bus of about 30 people were wiped out on the same route and we drove on that route and came back on the same route and we were left alone we were not even touched amen but my friends i want you to know that jesus regained our core rulership the devil couldn't find anything on him he could not touch him in any possible way praise the name of the lord because he overcame by the word see right now let me say this that is the only way for you to be an overcomer let me repeat how many here wants to be an overcomer the only way for you to become an overcomer also is the only way you can know if you are even now overcoming hallelujah because the word cannot fail the wording you can't fail because you already caught the revelation that i'm relying on myself i'm not even going to rely on my own wisdom i'm not going to even rely on the reports that men come to me and say oh the plane got to go you can't go on the plane but when the son of god and god says no that has to wait until he or she gets on it has to wait it's as simple as that i don't know what the circumstance around it but god can change any circumstances god could change the heart of any man or woman oh he's the president oh he's the king you know that that's good you know one time i i was working under this old italian gentleman that was teaching me carpentry and uh you know i was saying oh my goodness i said man you know the boss this or the boss maybe that i don't know i can't do this then that quiet voice speaker and said yeah well who's who's the boss who is his boss he may be your boss but i'm the boss of bosses so it's not you don't have to go talk to him you talk to me and then i tell him what to do and then he'll tell you what to do so don't worry about boss and king and president respect them for their position but let them remember that there's a great judge above all these judges there's a king above all these kings there's a king of kings there's a judge about all the judges there's a mighty god hallelujah that rules over everything and he's the word and he cannot fail for he is god he cannot fail he keeps his word oh thank god you see after all that jesus overcame also all the world systems of religions of his day he's not saying it outright but so must the bride and the true believer overcome all the world systems of religion of this day all that will come to you as the as the theologians repeatedly and used the word theologians here repeatedly badgered him badgered him with questions badgered him but he just constantly quietly applied the word why the word is the word so a real christian don't have to argue because it's not my word and the word just says this you can argue with that if you want to but truth is stated truth truths don't change it remains forever and you can't change it there's nothing to argue about we just state it leave it and you go meditate on it think upon it argue with it fight on it with it if you want to but the word does not change he overcame came them how did he overcome them theologians how did he overcome them the world system of his day by applying the word how shall we overcome in our day by applying the word oven theologians over the church systems denominational systems the social world system how do we overcome the cosmos uh around us amen we have a come by applying the word i don't mean just applying the bible but applying the word with revelation this is what this is what the uh brother brandon later on says confuses them i think he says it here amen hallelujah it utterly con they were utterly confused by the wisdom that he had hallelujah and that is what has been given to us hallelujah back then it was solomon but now a greater than solomon is here hallelujah and a part of him is in me in you no matter what you think about yourself paul said god is greater even than your own heart oh my i am this i am that you call yourself down you put yourself down you can put yourself down how much you shouldn't but if you put yourself down i am this time that i always fail when i do the scenario but paul said that may be so but god is greater than your heart you say i'm a loser god says you're a winner you say oh my i don't know how i'm going to do this well the bible says you're an overcomer you don't overcome by yourself you overcome by him that is already in you sometimes you stand there you don't even know how you're going to answer somebody hallelujah and the holy spirit be said the holy spirit but you yourself going to answer them but you're going to know that that wasn't just you answering them that was the holy spirit that answered through you because you don't know where the wisdom come from hallelujah like brother branham in the courtroom when the fellow said well you're going to have to pay a hundred and some thousand dollars in taxes because you gave all this money and you and this and that and these people talk away to all these people you got to pay tax on it and you this and that brother brown said well sir what else can i do uh i'm just not worried about myself but i'm just sorry for those poor people that have to go paying taxes on a gift something that i gave to them that they didn't come and beg or ask me for but i felt led to give them the lord i said no no no no they don't have to pay any tax on that because it was a free gift they didn't come to you and ask or anything then the holy spirit says now now you speak well then i don't have to pay on a hundred thousand because i never asked anybody for a penny in my life he says no that's not so here that's impossible give me your key right now before you go to the courtroom give me the key to your mailbox and he said you sure he gave him the key to the mailbox and they check it and check it for almost a month they couldn't find a letter going out asking for funds for money or for offerings all they can see is people sending funds to help the ministry in every way and so the government had to pay him back pay him back all that money but it happened because he said it's not i am wise he he couldn't go playing around with a liar but all of a sudden just a simple thing the spirit just spoke out so that's how we got to relax just trust god amen no matter who you have to face amen they're carrying on in front of you let them carry on because that's all that's all the life they got when it's over they don't have nothing else unless god would save them so you are an overcomer amen praise god don't forget that always say that to yourself i am an overcomer hallelujah praise god listen you're not boasting because it's not you you're uh in god david said i boast all the day long i'm ghosting on him because he is an overcomer and he lives in me brother family brother branham going with him inside of the land rover brother branson oh praise god all those marvelous healing in my meetings that i had over there and this man with a crippled guy jump out the chair and this one over here this happened and brother brother fandla told me this is personal he says he says brother i just thought what you're boasting about all them things that you did said the minute i thought like that that man turned and he says what did you say ernie he said oh nothing not he says come on ernie you know better than that he said well you know i thought you were kind of boasting on your ministry and this and that uh what happened in your ministry he says yeah you're right he says but you didn't listen closely i wasn't boasting saying i did it i was boasting on god i'm boasting on the lord i'm posting on the things he'd done he just happened to use me but i was bossing on the lord hallelujah and that's in god david said i boast all that they love all the day long i boast in the lord greater is he that is in us then he that is in the world oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah amen hallelujah listen hebrews 5 7. about jesus who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying this is jesus praying with strong crying praise god and with tears see my god that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he just a minute in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience right he learned obedience like i explained to you before he never came under that kind of a situation oh my he was always the big boss and nobody telling him but when that boss come down as an undercover boss and move in his own company he has got to let all them workers push him around tell him to move that box over there but they don't know who they're talking to right but he did that deliberately so he can know what's going on amen praise god when he's finished he goes right back up this presidential chair when the war when the worker comes in later on to see who's the boss he's the guy that he was pushing around down there oh we thank god we have a mighty god like that what condescension bringing us redemption oh praise god that in the dead of night when we had not one faith hope inside he learned obedience amen now then there will not be one person who will sit in the throne of the lord jesus christ unless he has been living by the word hallelujah now the scene is changing all through your life's journey we're singing this song standing on the promises of christ my king and if you were to think carefully all the time most of the songs we're talking about it talks about christians standing on the promises standing on the word standing by the word holding on to the word but now he is saying to him that overcometh i will grant to him to sit with me in my throne even as i also and i'm set down with my father in his throne so you don't have to stand by the word anymore i'm not talking about right now you're standing by the word now but you completely overcome and you pass through that perfect realization you come to a place of perfect rest in christ you're seated on that word settled hallelujah you know you're sitting down you know what sit down mean it's like when uh when uh stephen was being killed uh he praised god he looked up and he saw jesus standing well he was not supposed to be standing at that point he was supposed to be sitting but it shows the respect when a king get up out of his throne to welcome home his one of his knights or one of his men amen so he stood up in respect to stephen praise god but in actual fact he's seated at the right hand and there's the scripture he's seated at the right hand of god which means seated in a place of power and the supreme authority is back to his power and supreme authority and he is now seated and now he is saying when you overcome you will also come back as a bride as a wife back into core rulership with me seated in the throne and he or she or him or they or my children who have overcome will set with me back to their original core rulership that they had in the very beginning none listen let me tell you even all your prayers i'm closing all your fastings all your repentances no matter what you bring and present to god none of that will gain you anything it will not gain you the privilege of sitting down with him in that throne it will only be granted to the word bride it will only be granted to co-rulers like a man and his wife the core rulers of that home amen praise god it's the same thing none will set with him amen you see as the throne of a king is shared with his queen she is united with him hallelujah so are they who have overcome by the word even as he is the word they will share the throne hallelujah praise god don't you understand the word now coming forth to you all through this time now your understanding open up the light is shining in the dark audition age the evening lights have come evening on the standing evening revelation shining in the midst of this blackout of the age that we're living in here and in the midst of all that praise god you are going to be seated with him in his throne and share his throne amen so he's telling you and i put it i just wrote this in my column here and my thing here only those who have the election and privilege of having the supernatural spiritual marriage through invisible union of christ the anointed word and his bride who believes him hallelujah praise god and none can take that position for what god had joined let no man put asunder so if god unites elects and unites that individual with the word of god they have eternal security none can take it away none can separate it none can break the bonds that god has set there not even paul is trying to save you see the extent of this thing he said not even you with yourself did it is that right no lots of people never understood why brother branham went downtown and sat down with this young brother and her brother is drinking beer and even asked him uh bill would you go and buy him and said no you know i can't do that charlie i can't do that praise god and then later on in another book you hear brother brandon speaking he says you know charlie died and he's just gone now but thank god god took his child home is that right a backslidden brother goes out there in the world and drinks himself to death and the prophet doesn't stand there condemning him see i know that would have happened because he backs light from afterward don't believe the message anymore and that's what happens no you don't know nothing none of us we don't know anything you that's why paul said you better be careful try and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling is that right praise god you don't approve of what the person is doing you don't compromise with what the person is doing but it's none of your business because the thing has come down to individual fear now personal temptation individual salvation individual revelation god working everything out for his glory and for his honor oh blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ now amen think of it adam and eve fell because they left the word the ephesian age fell they only turned slightly away from the world every succeeding age continued that to turn away from the word until we come to this ledecian church age with a complete repudiation of the world by the world council of churches see this ledecian church age then ends in a complete blackout complete blackout praise god remember it says the ledecian church age ends with complete blackout he's not talking about the bride ending with blackout he's not talking but he's elected because one they are walking in darkness their israelites had a light in the house and they were eating the lamb they're eating up the lamb and enjoying the the meal that they were having to pass over meal there weren't even in hatred of of them egyptians for what they did them for all those 400 years as an old message i preach the true passover is learning how to get out of yourself get in the love of god get in the perfect word so that you can pass over the sins of others and the things that they've done to you people say how can you do that i actually had one preacher say but how could you how could you how could you forgive some that person how can you said yes i know it's hard for you to believe but to be honest i there's nothing there's nothing whatsoever i'm not putting on a show or trying to put on something trying a holier than than that we have years of that going on and still going on with many but we don't have to do that when it's the real thing has come to you the world has come to you and it's changed transformed you and made you into what you are a complete blackout to the word and this will cause a departure of the lord from their midst and that is why he stands outside knocking to his own to follow him come out of her my people be not partakers of our plagues amen follow him by obedience to the word but after a short and powerful demonstration of the spirit this now listen this because now he's speaking of prophecy and he's speaking but fulfillment to the word this little haunted so we will be haunted this little persecuted group will then go to be with jesus amen just a little short work praise god because we know the bride isn't going through tribulation the tribulation's not going to start the day after she leave it's going to phase itself in and we are going to just have a little taste but you're going out of here is that right as the prophet when he said it he says they're going to come to close you up but you're not just going to be closed up you're going up i'm going up with the first rapture and the first resurrection is that right praise god when he calls me i will answer let's stand and look to the lord and pray we're this we are dismissing right now you don't have to come up again brother our gracious father we thank you for this the simplicity of the word of god we thank you for the holy spirit who gives the word its clarity gives the word islamity and father may the word continue to speak to each one of us in a personal way for just as satan brings temptation with personalization may this word go forth tonight with personalization by the holy spirit to meet every individual need for your glory and for your honor in jesus christ's name take us safely to our various homes help us through this a world of darkness and of sin and devils take us home safely protect us bless us in the home protect our homes our loved ones oh god surround the home with the with your presence may the pillar of fire hang above the tent may your people be protected may they all maybe they don't recognize it but because of one or two individuals in that home holding to god's word and sitting down with him may they all be protected and watched over for your glory and honor whether near or far from us father we pray your great presence will surround them wrap the robes of your holy spirit around them father all we love and those that love us and in all this father may you glorify be glorified as we come to the end of this age in jesus name amen praise god one age ends another one opens praise god god bless you god bless you brother god bless every one of you
