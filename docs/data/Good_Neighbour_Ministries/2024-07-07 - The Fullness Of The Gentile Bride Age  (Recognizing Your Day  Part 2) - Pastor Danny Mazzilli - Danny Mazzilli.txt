passed over well we're in that chamber right now and the seed is his word and praise God we're here to receive his word this morning amen and let that seed do everything it has to do in our lives praise God but in the meantime how many have a need they want to bring before him all the the Lord knows he knows everything he knows every single thing and he's so merciful how many believe he's merciful god hallelujah amen you know just in the way of that I had a uh I'll just give this real quick testimony here about a a lady that I I worked with about two and a half years ago this lady was not easy to work with she's one you know people have all kinds of issues and stuff she had all kinds of issues somehow I got into her good books a little bit and and uh and she started to she liked me and that's maybe that's not easy to do for some people right especially me but uh anyway so she started telling me about her family situation and she said she said uh you know she she's my husb my husband she has two daughters from a previous relationship she says but I have I've never been able to have a child and now she was 39 years old 40 years old and she says I'm never going to be able to have a child and I'd say Angela I said wait a minute Naturally Speaking she tried everything I said that might be right but I said there is a God who can give you a child amen right and it's the god of the Bible make no mistake about it it's not the god of Hindu or it's the Lord Jesus he can give it to you we had this conversation two or three times and I kept on saying Angela the Lord Jesus Christ of the Bible can give you a child and as a matter of fact I said I'm going to ask him I said one day I'm going to ask him if he if he'll do that for you she okay and I left work that day and um started driving home and the thought came you said you were going to ask I went oh yeah I did and I started to pray I said Lord remember this lady she's really would like to have a child next thing I

put in a prayer request this is going back two years ago and I said pray with me that this baby and I never heard nothing from Angela again I know that she went off in maternity leave I haven't seen

brother God bless you Fain and funny that he should say that um that we're not here for a long time because uh that is partly what has prompted the inspiration for the special because um for those of you who don't know we know a lot of visitors we have a lot of new Believers so I'll share a little bit not too long but I'll share a little bit that it was exactly nine years ago today that the Lord Jesus called my late husband and the father of our dear children brother Daniel Omari to Glory he came into his natural Perfection right and he was changed his robes right and he was graduated and so so much of what I wanted to share before singing the song the Lord has already ministered it so I won't reiterate but I'll refer to it just briefly by saying even in that song Right changeing ropes and how the Lord's ministering our needs and you know brother Chris when he talked about the storm and that 90 95% is destroyed it caused me that's what I was going to share that in that moment if you've ever lost a spouse or any close family member immediately your life changes overnight and you literally feel like a storm has passed through and you're hanging on by that 5% that's remaining and that you know if the Lord Jesus who is underneath that other our Rock and our foundation and and then he mentioned how much the Lord cares for all of our needs and that's exactly what the song is about and so you know especially when we come to this time of year our children and I are always in reflection and not only in commemoration and in honor of his life and his legacy and everything that he meant to us and how much we love and still myth him you know even though the Lord has blessed me to be remarried but you know you still you never forget the day when you've lost that person who you're significant to you and so yesterday I was just worshiping Mee in the garden and working and this song about the thinging I've loved it I've known it for so many years I've always loved it and I was just crying out to the Lord and singing on to the Lord and then he dropped it into my spirit to share it with you today so I pray that it'll be a blessing to you and the song is simply entitled Jesus I love you so it's literally a testimony of to the Lord and for bringing us through these nine years you know our children were young our eldis at the time was just uh 15 and our youngest was um four going on five and for them to lose their father overnight suddenly like that and but through the years God in his faithfulness he's been so faithful and let me also amen amen to thank you Saints again again let me never forget that for your prayers for your love how much you surrounded our family and and just continue to be a blessing to all of us and even as the brother said let us always continue to keep each other in prayer we don't know each other's exact need and what the situations are so I just want to also thank you and give praise to the Lord for continuing to keep us in this way because it's all it's all by his grace and his mercy so thank you for listening and may God use the song to be a blessing to your heart amen God bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] not because I've been so faithful not because I've been so good you've been there for me to supply my every need you were there when I was lonely you were there in all my pain guiding my footsteps the shelter from the

God and I believe that I believe that nothing happens by chance I believe the Lord leads you and guides you amen so I want to report that um this Friday that just went by we we attended the Oakville Invitational uh Italian golf tournament that they hold each year I believe this year was their 46th or 47th year that they've been doing this it's always been uh an event where they've raised funds for worthy causes um from the Oakville hospital to different hostels to Good Neighbor Ministries by the grace of God to individ idual uh situations you know there was somebody there um that uh represented um family members that dealt with brain cancer and research and uh you know so they they look for things that are unique and different and uh my God it's just tremendous to see what the Lord has allowed them to do over the years hundreds millions of dollars that have been raised for these worthy causes so may God continue to bless them and prosper them each one that uh are the organizers of this event there's three uh individuals John Paladino Carmen bonfilio and John KUSI these three individuals have dedicated their time to organize and put this event together for many years may God bless them for that and so we are beneficiaries again they've um they've announced that we will be a um you know one of the uh recipients of a wonderful blessing again financially they've been blessing us for several years now and it's certainly helped our youth ministry and it will continue to do so as we build our future in our youth because they are the future amen of the church the future of this nation amen praise God and so we thank God for that um uh also we'll be having our youth camp you'll be receiving details you'll be receiving a flyer this week announcing it on August the 30th through to July uh September the 1st uh three-day weekend um dedicated to services for our young people and there'll also be beneficiaries like you that can benefit by being there praying about it supporting it doing your part in it some will be there to just pull on the word some will be there to serve it all depends on how God is leading and directing each and every one amen praise God so we certainly look forward to that be watching for details on that and pulling us all together just in the same way we did for the pastor retirement celebration we need to pull together again to do another great work for the glory of God Amen praise God I want to send out um uh greetings uh to Sister Celia and brother Samuel there are some new Believers that uh that follow the word of God that will be joining us God bless you we trust that you will be blessed by the service online this morning she said that her and her husband would be tuning in and that they would be joining us next weekend and uh they're trusting that uh they can meet us by the grace of God they have a testimony too amen praise God and so um also thank you all of you that have been you know behind the scenes working here at the church I've seen people here this week you know some of the young people that were here uh assisting in doing the landscaping and trimming and and fertilizing and all the things that you're doing in the background we know that God knows who you are and that you are going to be blessed and you're already getting the the blessings as a part of it because it's those those things that you do in secret that God openly blesses you amen people will see wow man they're just constantly getting blessed they're getting blessed in this they're getting blessed financially they're getting blessed with good health they're getting Bess and and God just why you know like because you know God doesn't owe anybody anything you want to get blessed by God do something but you don't have to do it in such a way that everybody's got to see what you're doing just do it and watch God bless you bless the people bless the body bless the ministry amen that's what this is all about this is a supernatural body of Believers that believe that God is the boss he's the rewarder he's the one that will reward and bless and prosper you in whatever way you need praise God and so this morning let's go to the word let's all stand we're going to continue on um part two we started this back on June the 2nd we administered on the fullness of the Gentile bride age and how the Lord is um moving right now what he's doing right now and uh how it is that um you know what's going on in Israel right now nothing is by accident everything is is part of God's plan amen and we need to just get in tune with God's plan and recognize where we fit and what we do with with the word amen let's pray before we go father we're excited by the word of God lord we know that that Lord whenever um you bring us together in this way and the people have faith and the minister has Faith to get out of the way and to know that you're you're the you're the one that comes that's the that's the supernatural um element about preaching that makes it so so wonderful Lord is is that you can come and you can step in at any time and speak to the needs of your people and so that excites us this morning Lord people that are assembled here and those that are online they can they can be recipients of your spirit of your blessings of a word one word from you could change their entire lives Grant it father let it be today Lord that nobody will leave the same way that they came take absolute preeminence of this vessel it's surrendered to you right now father in the name of Jesus Christ and may you take your people and take us into Heavenly places in Jesus name amen praise God let's read our scripture this morning acts 13: 46-49 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you now they were they were ministering to the Jews it was the Jews that that you know that that the word was to come to but remember they didn't receive it and to this very day they still haven't recognized that Jesus was the Messiah but they will should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed I'm going to read that again and as as many as were ordained to eternal life they believed because they were ordained to it it wasn't something that that they chaned upon you didn't chance upon this message you didn't chance upon the word for your day you didn't chance upon what God is what the Lord Jesus Christ is doing in 2024 it's because you're ordained to ites and you will hear it and you will receive it and they were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region may the Lord add His blessings to the word of God you may be seated what a wonderful thing that you know I mean it's it's almost a paradox Saints to know that you know the world is in such turmoil right now and you know it the the whole Focus you turn on the news and you look you know and you're going to see something there about what's going on in the Middle East it all surrounds Israel and it's bringing in all the nations all the nations are being brought into the whole picture here and yet here we are today you know knowing the history behind it that there's a that there's a history behind it all and that God has a purpose behind the whole whole plan of Israel and yet here we just read that you know that that when Jesus Christ the Messiah came to the Earth they were blinded so that Gentiles pagans you and me could receive the word of God could be grafted in to the plan of God and you know that blindness is still in place today and because of that blindness they're in the condition that they're in and we're in the condition that we're in Christ has a church that is now being prepared and the Gentile age is coming to a completion and when this Gentile age comes into a completion it's because there's a church that has come into full maturity she comes to the full fullness of the Gentiles and that there's going to be a full Revelation to the Gentile bride in this age and so the Gentile church for this hour must come into a mature revelation of where she fits in the prophecy of God's word everything that we look at is prophecy there's nothing new Under the son Solomon said right there he said there's vanity of vanities man can try and become great he can make himself try to make himself a king or try to make himself one of the richest men on Earth and think that he's achieved it but there's nothing new Under the Sun listen Solomon Abraham David these were some of the richest there's nobody that even still to this day comes close to the wealth that God gave to them he told Abraham wherever you you you're your foot trods wherever your foot makes a footprint that property I give it unto you not only to you but I give it unto your children it's a promise that he made and here here we are in our day not realizing that that promise is to you it's to us for us to recognize that that we have been given this promise amen and where we fit into the prophecy of this day and so um we are at a time where where Christ is coming into the fullness of his ministry for this day now when we look at Israel you know I was reading some articles this morning you know Hezbollah the the the attacks that are taking place right now they're saying that things are really heating up it's it's you know like they're trying to they're trying to have a ceasefire they're trying to work it out the US is supporting a ceasefire you know Hezbollah and Hamas they want to cease fire but then if you if you look deeper into it all you start to see that they that both sides have conditions that are impossible and this is why they keep coming to the same place and the war just continues to go on and go on and go on is because God's prophecy was written before their ceasefires and so in order for anybody to really understand you know what's going on you need to recognize what the word of God says about Israel and about this war and how it's going to actually end it's not going to be the way people think it's going to be there have been other ceasefires in the past have they lasted no why because the prophecy says that it will end with a massive Armageddon there's going to be a World War II I'm not here to bring the bad news okay I'm here to bring the good news amen but you see salvation has a purpose a lot of people say well you know you're just speaking about doomsday and you're talking about hell and fire no we're not we're telling you that those things are going to happen according to the word of God but we're here to announce and proclaim the good news amen that salvation is for you that if you accept Jesus Christ as your son Savior and your Redeemer then you will not have to face what the world is inevitably going to face you can't change it I can't change it it's biblical prophecy it must come to pass and so there's not so all we can do is try and discover and find out where do we fit in and how do we bypass this Armageddon this World War II that is going to strike the Earth with or without your consent that's right you know a lot of uh Nations United Nations and and you know leaders they're coming together and they're trying to use their own wisdom and their own understanding of how they're going to work everything out and how they're going to bring about a ceasefire and how they're going to bring about peace in the world yes there is going to come another peace peace and things are going to look like everything's going to be fine but scripturally it says that that piece is not going to last very long could that happen after the November elections when the new you know president comes into the United States that's another thing remember Bible prophecy the United States is in Bible prophecy they're a part of the whole picture and everything that you see now that's taking place it just goes to show show you that we're at the end because you've got governments you've got Democrat Republican you've got liberal you've got conservative and they're all in a state of confusion and the people are literally not it's no longer something where they come in and they they debate and they and they discuss and they come to a reasoning of you know what is best for the nation what we should do that's better no now it's like they're firing at one another they're they're they're uh they're you know uh being bold and rude and and and saying things it's it's like Words of War within the nation so the Bible says how can how can two walk together lest they agree there is Absol it's like night and day Republican and Democrat how is that all all of a sudden going to fix itself it's not it goes to show you that we are in the last days of even government Jesus said there will be a government upon my shoulders and there will be peace on Earth for 1,000 years that is going to be the next major event after the Rapture of the church okay remember it's only what like here here's the scripture 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way to let means God is still here Christ and his church are still here on the earth and because we are still here prior to the Rapture it's keep keeping things at Bay okay it's keeping everything in its in its kind of like a like a controlled uh uh you know uh confusion controlled confusion all right because you've got Russia you've got Ukraine you've got uh GA Gaza you've got Hezbollah you've got things going on in Lebanon you've got Iran you all this war and anger and hatred and people wanting to destroy one another you know wanting to see people die and and get killed it's evil and if that gets fully loosed it's going to turn into Armageddon and that's what it eventually but you're still here right Christ is still here he is still here on the Earth but when the Holy Spirit leaves the Earth in the Rapture of the church and it and those which are alive and remain get caught up together to meet the Lord in the air for that three and a half year honeymoon this world goes into three and a half years of total tribulation that's right wow what a time in Daniel go to the next scripture in Daniel 12 verse one it says and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book aren't you glad that your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah you know because the world we're in a time of trouble and it's a time of trouble like never before sure we've had world wars World War I World War II and we saw just a touch of what nuclear power can do in World War II and it was total devastation now we've got Nations that are loaded with nuclear nukes and and a lot of them that are that are radar and and have GPS's pointing to every major city in North America and every major city in Russia and Europe and and all over the place can you imagine if a few of those get released it's not going to be fun here on the earth this is a time like never before they're putting nukes into the sky now they're saying that Russia is putting them into space so that they can be uh released right from space and sent wherever they want to send them if they've created the technology it's because they want to use the technology that's right it's just a matter of time when he that lets he that's he that's preventing CU right now letting means to prevent that's what scripturally it means he's preventing this whole thing to fall into total chaos and allow the Earth to go into total tribulation and and World War III but he's holding it back why for you this is going to be a very Troublesome time in the tribulation time God will turn to the Jews the Lord is already starting to focus and at any time in the very near future Moses and Elijah Moses and Elijah they were the two main prophets to the children of Israel and scripturally prophesied that they will rise again and they will be the ones that will go and bring this message this very message that that that we've been preaching here for for so many years because God sent us an Elijah to the Gentile bride Lord to turn us back to the word of God and we've been blessed by that by that Gentile Prophet William Branham and the ministry that God ordained for this 20th century to receive the word of God you know we talk of William Branham and I want you to know that we talk to him as a as a reformer not just as a reformer but as an actual Prophet because he had thus sayeth the Lord he had a prophetic word for the Gentile dispensation Martin Luther was also a reformer many talk about him John Wesley was also a reformer the Pentecostal movement was was a restoration of the gifts where the spirit of God came into isua Street to restore the gifts but yet God himself wanted to bring a prophetic word to the Gentile churches that were in a state of confusion because you got Christianity and you've got thousands of different denominations how do you know what to believe how do you know which Christian Church is the right Church well if if time prevails at some point they're going to realize that William brandham was sent from God he was a reformer just like Luther that caught the Revelation that the just shall live by faith and broke away from the Catholic church and started the Protestant churches it was a part of the restoration of the TRU true church it had to come away from organized religion you can't organize God you can't organize the Holy Ghost he's a living mystical body and he he's he's alive and well and he wants you to know it he wants you to know that you're in the body of Christ and so Israel is going to receive their two prophets now let's go to the next slide Romans chapter 11: 25 and this is just a real quick recap for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in and this is what we're talking about today we're we're coming into the fullness if there was ever a time where the word of God was coming coming into its fullness and there would be a church that would be mature and ready to to to be translated in this hour it's now it's right now this Gentile dispensation is coming to an end an end means it's it's coming to its fullness all right and listen to brother brandham here he says here um you can go to the next slide he says recognizing your day and its message he says you know the Jews were blinded for the very purpose that we could have sight they were torn apart scattered as a nation and rejected their Messiah that we might receive the Messiah that there might be a people called out of the Gentiles for his name's sake look now the man comes forth and the woman takes his name these blinded gentiles who can't see that name the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism it's just too bad you see like like just how simple that is that that you know you talk to somebody about the word of God and you talk to them about salvation and acts 238 said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a perfect type of a man and a woman when a man and a woman get married the woman takes his name that's just known and here you know when when Christ comes into your life you take his name in baptism you you bury the old life in water baptism and you are raised up in the newness of life and now you've taken the name of your husband which is Christ okay the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism is just too bad but it has to be that way the Jews they had they had to not see that there is only one can see it that's the one who is predestinated to see it remember we said at the beginning you've got to be ordained to this message it's not for everybody so don't try to don't try to convert people you know it's God is the one who births them gives them a new birth that's the true conversion it's it's the Born Again experience not being somebody that's religious we are not religious people say oh you're so religious no we're not religious we are Christians we've received the spirit of Christ and when the spirit of Christ comes in you it reads the the word it understands the word and he said he said that repent be baptized this is unto you and to your children and to as many as the Lord Our God calls amen you got to read all the scripture my sheep he didn't say all sheep he says the Sheep No he said my sheep you see we've got to take the word for what it says says my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow so it's ordained for you because in you is a part of God from before the foundations of this world like job says where were you when the sons of God rejoiced together around the Throne of God where were you if you were there and you're now here having come through a spiritual Amnesia into a human body when that word is flashed before you in this way and somebody says you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you look at the word and you say yep that's exactly how 3,000 were baptized on the day of Pentecost and oh there's Phillip he baptized the unic and oh he baptized them in the name of Jesus Christ oh and there's Paul in Acts 19 and there he is and he comes across a bunch of disciples you know other Christians in his day remember we are an extension of the book of Acts if people ask you what do you you know what's your church all about just tell them read the book of Acts what you see in the book of Acts you will see in our church you see baptism in jesus' name that's how we baptize you see uh you know foot washing you see the Lord's Supper that's how we do it it's it's just the word being displayed and Paul he comes across a bunch of disciples that were Christians and they were rejoicing and Paul comes to them he says whoa whoa whoa whoa he says unto what were you baptized I can see that you're excited you can talk to a lot of people you can go to listen there's there's Christian camps going on right now there's Revival meetings going on right now and you can go in there and you can pull somebody aside and they're rejoicing and it's good that they're rejoicing about the word of God but if the spirit of the Holy Ghost is inside of them if Christ is in them there's no way it'll reject the word it can't deny the word okay it's just doesn't make sense and so if if you say to them like Paul did in Acts 19 he says how were you baptized unto what and they turn around and says well we got baptized by John the Baptist oh so your disciples of John the Baptist just like today you know you talk to people and you say what do you believe we believe the message of William brandham I so okay that's good but how were you baptized oh we were baptized you know there's people that baptize in the name of William brandham that's nonsense that's absolute nonsense because they don't have a revelation that the relationship is with Jesus Christ it's not with a man it was never a relationship with Moses Moses's arms were held up so that the people could look unto the Lord his countenance was shining with the countenance of the Lord the word that he brought was not thus saith Moses Pharaoh set my people free he said thus sayeth the Lord set my people free and so people need to recognize just like in Acts 19 how unto what were you baptized and they'll turn around and say well I was baptized uh you know unto John the Baptist he says you need to be re-baptized you need the baptism of Jesus Christ you need to receive him not William brandom you once you've got him you'll recognize where William brandom fits into the scripture and that he was the prophet of Malachi 45 he was the angel of Revelations 10 1-7 the messenger of that you'll see all of that you'll see the ministry being fulfilled clearly but you will still look to the word and you will recognize that it's Christ in the present stage of his ministry and that is what you will follow that is what is going to Quicken you for the body change and so so there's only one can see it that's the one who is predestinated to see it otherwise you'll never see it the Jews could not see that being their Messiah and yet they were Scholars theologians men of great renowned scholarship read the same Bible that you read now after it's been made known to us we can see it plain that was Messiah but they couldn't see it neither can they see it today there is a blindness that's coming now upon the Gentiles and not just now it's been on them for a long time but it's going to come to its fullness they're going to come into a full blindness and the Gentile dispensation and the age will be over if it's not already I'm not making any statements here I'm just telling you that God is is his own interpreter is God still calling yes he is God is still calling God is still perfecting but if your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundations of the world you're not new you're just coming into a realization of who you really are you always were a Son of God you don't come to an altar call and go back and say I just became a Christian if you are a Christian you always were a Christian but you didn't know you were a real Christian you didn't know that in you was an attribute a gene uh like a like a like a a a gene that that would connect perfectly with the word of God that it would that it would not deny the word of God that it would not that when when it would look at the word of God it it can't see three Gods it doesn't see three Gods it sees Jesus Christ the same yesterday the Lord today Jesus Christ and forever the kingdom of God it's always been the Lord one God you see everything becomes clear and so here he says but they couldn't see it neither can they see it today they are prophesied to be blinded two the church this day is prophesied to be blinded to reject the evening time message what is evening time it's the time where things kind of finish up right you know at the end of the day that's when you start to relax and you start to get ready to go to sleep so that you can start a brand new day well it's evening time now for the word of God to come into its fullness amen praise God and so as we continue here now we realize that uh Romans 11 you know was was for the purpose of showing when we read you know verses 25 and 26 just as a recap it's it's God showing his sovereignty it's God showing that he knows about this blindness and he wants you to know about this blindness he wants you to know that it's not because of any good that you did don't puff yourself up oh God is with us you know God blinded them so that he could be with us because he wanted to be no this is all part of his sovereignty it's all part of his Plan of Redemption Israel is in the state that it's in because of God's word God's Sovereign word that's what put them into a a state of hardness against the word of God Amen okay they've they've come into that that you know to where they cannot recognize Messiah but it's because because God was coming to you the Gentiles to open your understanding their hardened to the understanding you've been awakened to the understanding and during your Awakening now the Gentile church is hardening and they are coming into the fullness of their point to where they just will not accept Jesus Christ they'll think they've accepted him they'll continue going to church believing in a trinity that's why on that day many are going to come to Jesus like the scripture says and said Lord have I not cast out devils in your name have I not prophesied in your name and he's going to look at them and said I never knew you well if you go back into the scriptures you'll see when when when when the scripture talks about knew you just like Adam knew his wife Adam was planting seed in the individual in the bride and in if you're the church then there's seed in you of Jesus Christ and that seed just like Mary when when when the angel Gabriel came to Mary and said you're going to bring forth a son and his name Shall be Called Jesus Christ she immediately said be it unto me according to your word and the moment she did that the word took an effect and when the word comes to you in your day like this message and you hear oh you know what's what's good neighbor laor Ministries preaching what's what's this message that they're preaching and when they take enough time to listen we're not preaching any kind of a cult or any kind of a you know uh our own interpretation on the word of God we're just preaching right from the word of God I'm reading scripture here and then I'm quoting a reformer that you can search yourself and check his ministry William brandom's Ministry was a worldwide Ministry it went across the world seven times there was testimony after testimony of what God did through that Ministry I don't have to get into it all it's all on Google you can research it yourself and then because there's a representation of the seed of God in you when you see it when you read it and then you line it with the word you see what he says you see what the word says and then you're you're either going to say no way I'm not accepting this or what this is just clear and simple I can see it clear and that's because you have representation thank you Jesus that's because you always were ordained to this time and this season and and this so happens to be the season of The Rapture so not only are you going to receive the message of this hour but you're going to receive super Supernatural word that is going to change your body it's literally going to change your body you know they're they're they're trying to tap into it now with science they're trying to you know artificial intelligence and and the power of this and dimensional uh you know they're they're already seeing that there's more than this Dimension they're breaking into that other dimension well that other dimension is just the other dimension that when we are changed in a moment in the twinkling of and I we are going to be instantly in that other dimension but when you pass through that curtain the difference is going to be that you pass through that curtain and you're going to have a brand new body this Mortal shall put on immortality if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I have another one waiting it's called the theophany body brother William William Mary and brandham was given an opportunity to go beyond that curtain of time and there's been other people even on YouTube that have had that opportunity and have seen those young bodies have seen themselves young again in a body that doesn't age remember death in the Garden of Eden is what brought aging if it wasn't for death our bodies would never age time was introduced When Death was introduced because death brings time or time brings death you live so many years you die so that that change that we're looking forward to that we are that that that by the word of God and by the grace of God you didn't deserve it I didn't deserve it 30 years ago when this message crossed my path it wasn't just this you know I didn't know who William Brandon was I I didn't I didn't care I came into a a a personal relationship with with a a supernatural God that delivered me from a cocaine addiction that I thought was going to take my life and when that happened to me I was ready to give my life I I realized my God I'll do anything for this God because he's my savior amen I was ready to give up everything just like blind barus he was blind but man when Jesus come along and opened his eyes let me tell you he says listen the you know the priest came to him and talked to barus what are you what are you talking about how's how is it that you can see he says listen I don't know I've been going to your church years for I don't know how many years I've been going to this church that church I I've been trying self-help I've been trying everything possible but this Jesus he spoke one word and I'm delivered and all I know is that he is the Living God and once you meet this God you'll never be the same you can never ever be the same and don't worry no family member is going to convince you nobody's going to tell you oh listen you you know you know you know my wife would tell me that you know when I first came to the Lord I was so zealous my family was like like he he's lost it you know like he he he's he's lost it like like you know what he's going where he's going to go there and and they would call my wife and they would say listen you don't need to go to that church you don't need to be doing that just take it easy you just relax you let him go through the phase he's going through you know Danny he gets excited about stuff you know he goes he goes through things you know like one minute he's trying to sell you you know AC n and the next minute he's trying to sell you you know uh uh some some some good vitamins and then you know he gets excited about things but then five years later they what he's preaching thank you Jesus what preaching what Jesus Christ why because he changed him he's he can never be the same he's received a message that that blows every Church to denominational teaching New Age movement because it wasn't a teaching it was an experience it was a personal revelation of who God is and who you are who I am now I realize why I was the way that I was could never be satisfied so I had to go to the drugs to try to get a higher high it was constant it was because in in you there is something that you need to work worship you're going to worship something I'll tell you right now you're going to worship your golf game you're going to worship your sports team you're going to worship drugs you're going to worship alcohol you're going to worship idolatry you're going to worship adultery you're GNA something is going to get a hold of you that you're going to need to worship something but when Jesus Christ comes just like he came to the woman at the well she was a prostitute that right to that moment amen she was with a man right minutes before that she went to the well to get some water she had no idea that she was going to be meeting Jesus I had no idea after meeting brother Gabriel that I'd be meeting Jesus I had no idea when he picked me up in that van and there was a truck Lo a van full of people from the United Nations I had no idea where I was going and I thought oh my goodness I said what did I get into and my goodness let me tell you that woman at the well that night I was the woman at the well I was the one that he was talking to I was the one who was living a life of prostitution living a life that was absolutely worthy of hell but he had mercy amen he showed mercy and he's got Mercy for you this morning he's got Mercy for anybody out there that's listening in he will show you Mercy in the same way and I challenge you not not go to church I challenge you to go to your knees and and and say if you're listen that God that that that Danny there is talking about I I want to I want to know if he's a reality I want to I want to see if this God is is the is the Living God that he's talking about there's only one way that you can be convinced I can never convince you don't that's why say don't try to convince and push people to come to this or you got to believe that no when the spirit of God in his time Jesus said all that the father meaning all that I had originally planned when he's talking about the father he's talking about himself all that everyone that's in my hand he says I'll not lose one of them every one of them's got to come amen and when they come it's because I draw them I draw them by the word of God I draw them by by an understanding of the word that that they can't even understand why they're recognizing what they're hearing It's Supernatural it's called divine revelation Jesus said I'm going to build my church on that amen praise God and so Israel was hardened they were for that purpose now the Gentiles are going to in in direct relation as we come into our fullness the Gentile dispensation goes into total blindness that's why we had the signs in the in the moon and in the in the Sun that the world went into total darkness again just recently because that's not coincidence Saints God always shows his signs in the heavens and then declares it on the earth amen and so we know that this is all to come about for the purpose that he might glorify himself he might glorify his Integrity that he says listen this blindness is only temporary on on Israel I'm going to awaken them and they are going to come to know that I am their Messiah they're going to come into their fullness into their atonement into their day of Awakening where they're going to know it's going to be because I'm going to send them the the the two prophets Moses and Elijah we will not be here for that okay but they are going to have have a Great Awakening so that he can show his grace and his mercy and that it was extended to all who would accept Hallelujah listen here in the message Shalom you're not of the world Little Children You are of Heaven this is not your home why should I Look To Us older people try to look back and get Young again you know so many people are so worried about age if you're a Christian age is irrelevant to you really come on now death has no sting on a true Christian are you feeling the aches and pains yes I feel them every morning sometimes I need to take Tylenol just to settle the pains and the aches especially after playing golf the other day for the first time it's it's life in a human vessel okay age is a part of this human Dimension but don't be trying to change it don't be trying to get miserable about oh I gotta you know this I gotta eat you know do those things that are right but be joyful because if you're a joyful Christian you'll be a strong Christian amen because Joy is your strength like we were saying here on Wednesday night and we're looking for that hour pressing for it so many good sincere people today are are caught away in these Creeds these churches and organizations having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof as second Timothy the 3 chapter says gross Darkness blinding of Israel was for the lightning of the Gentiles not the blinding of the Gentiles is the lightning of Israel sorry now the blinding of the Gentiles is the lightning of Israel that's why when the Gentile bride that's fully awake is raptured they've come into their rapturing faith condition and they're taken the Gentile churches that are left on Earth here will go into total blindness and that will awaken Israel that's now the Gentile blindness to awaken Israel that's where we're at that's how close we are that's why when you you try to tell somebody about the word you just just believe the word look at the word Jesus was the word he was made flesh and he he walked amongst the people and only a dozen actually recognize he was the word the rest of them said crucify him get get rid of this guy he's a heretic he's causing trouble in the in in the in the churches you know they they'll say the same thing about us oh you're disturbing everybody you know you're disturbing the churches and you know you're telling them that they're wrong no we don't want to tell them that they're wrong we want to show them what the word says so that they can get right so that they can receive the word and receive this salvation that that he's making available in this hour and so just like now he says uh the blinding of the Gentiles is the lightning of Israel it's just like the day and night one side has got dark the other side has got light and then the light comes over on the other side like you know how the sun rises in the East Falls in the west well it's light in the morning over here but by the time it falls over here it's total darkness over here you see so the light is moving and it's going to be moving to Israel and there's going to be total darkness in the Gentile Church world Amen so the moon passing the way it did look it's right here in the quote he said says here he says it's uh so just like the day and night one side has got Darkness the other side has got light and then the light comes over on the other side so the moon passing the way it did and the reflection of the darkness of the world blinding out its light is a reflection to us that the Gentile Church age is finished that's what he says here this was back in 1964 in the message shalom so remember you cannot add to the church God adds to the church okay and and all that those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world you can't add names to that book it's already written so so it's not oh my name was added to the book tonight because I went to the altar no it wasn't if your name was on the book it always was and you've come to a realization that you are a son or a daughter of God that's to receive this message and so that Darkness he says the Gentile Church age is finished the church is making herself ready being making herself ready for a time it's time for the Rapture for darkness is fading upon the Gentiles and Dawn will soon break upon the Jews the sun has faded the sorry the sun has traveled from east to west and we're on the west coast brother Brandon was talking about how you know there the you know the message came to to America and you can only go so far on the west coast to California and when you cross the ocean you're back in the East again and so he says here here he says we're on the west coast the light can only do one thing go back east and what's East Israel back to the Middle East on the other side you understand do you the light can only go back East again to where it began Israel got blinded them for a while but the darkness now is pressed upon the Gentile world that's covered the whole thing the G Gentiles will trod down Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation will be finished Jesus said so and now it's finished gross Darkness upon the people God reflecting it in the skies as he has shown on Earth before it all happens he says we're in it Saints I'm telling you we're in it we're in that time of total blindness coming into the churches but rise and shine thy light has come the revelation of this word and this message has come to you Amen brother he says here in mark of the beast brother don't worry Gentile your days is just about over let me warn you in the name of the Lord the Gentile door is closing just as certain as I'm standing here Jesus Jesus said the muhammadans there would they there would tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation be finished and fulfilled there she is Israel in her Homeland a nation with her own Army her own money amen she's a full Nation now the fig trees putting forth its buds and already buted out Israel is in her Homeland and the muhammadans the the the the the all those Nations the the the they're surrounding Israel they're all the Muslim nations all the children of Ishmael all those that are claiming that Abraham was their father Yes Abraham was uh was was ishmael's father but Ishmael was not the promised son Isaac was the promised son you need to read your Bible you can never tell a Jew that that that the Muslims that they were given the promised land they were not given the promised land according to the word of God anybody can show me that in the word of God I'll believe you but it's not there it was given to the children of Israel and that's why Bible prophecy will override whatever anybody else is saying out there you can't override God's word he said heavens and Earth will pass away but not my word my word will come to pass and the promise was given that land was was given to Israel it was never promised to be split up I know they want to try and do that they have they have good intentions but they're going against Bible prophecy God's word you can't change that and that's why you know we're not here to to to to bash any anybody we feel for those Palestinians those children and those those women and and men that are being killed and that are being bombed and and anybody that's being hurt it's not right but how can you change War always brings pain it always brings death and it's an unfortunate thing amen praise God but you see Christ came and preached and prophesied just exactly three and a half half years and the daily sacrifice was taken away we're winding down here everything just as perfect as it could be and the mosque of Omar was built on the same grounds and stands there to this day and they will tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation would be finished the church is taken up the elect the bride out of there and the two Prophets Elijah Elijah and Moses turns to Israel for them for three and a half years it's the most beautiful thing when you see it brought out when you see it through the word of God so here you see what he's saying he the Gentile dispensation would be finished so all of this that is the next stage of Prophecy that is to take place in Israel is waiting on you and me to come into our fullness to come into the Gentile fullness of the Bride age where we recognize who we are in fullness and God raptures us out of this Dimension into that other dimension do you see how close we are we're at the fullness of the Gentile bride age amen I got so many other uh you know um here 70 weeks of Daniel brother you know William Bram speaks he says but now in this seven Church ages that we have went through in in the Gentile time it was all all the seven Church ages everything that happened from from when Christ rose from the dead until now was all to the Gentile Church Israel was in total blindness they were just going on as they were from from the crucifixion of Christ until the end of the church ages now we've been through it all down now we're getting to a place where we can go into the Seven Seals the seven vials the seven trumpets and all that it pictures together all dealing with the Jews and God's judgment to the people upon the earth and the remnant you see everything now is coming into fulfillment of the prophecy of what's going to take place with the nation of Israel okay and so remember in this great time of persecution there's millions of Gentiles that will die in that time because the world's going to go into World War III and there's going to be Gentiles worldwide that are going to be saying hey wait a minute this wasn't supposed to happen to us we weren't supposed to be stuck here going into into this uh you know tribulation I thought Jesus was coming I thought he was going to come in the clouds and he was going to he was going to just bring us up and we would just float up into the air you see it's all based on teachings of man but here we've got a word that is a supernatural word which brings you into a personal relationship where now you are being quickened by the word of God personally you have a personal testimony you you you you you you belong to the church because you have a personal revelation of who you are as a part of of the body of Christ and you're going to be raptured as a result of that personal relationship not as a result of this General teaching oh I'm just a Christian I'm gonna I'm GNA float up into the air one day and the world's going to go into chaos I'm sorry to say it but you know he's already come he's already here amen he's finishing up the work amen I know the YouTube channels are are blasting away and hundreds of thousands of views and millions of views of oh the next Bible prophecy and what is next to happen and what is going to happen here and people are just eating all of that stuff up all you need to do is come to church and receive the word for your day and meet Jesus Christ in the personal form where he comes into your life where you become naked before God and all your traditions and all your teachings and all your ideas get thrown away and you come into that relationship with Christ Millions will die they reject that rejected bride he says she was a rejected Church she thought that she had it but Jesus like he said I never knew you I never knew you there but wait a minute we did this in your name we did that I never knew you when my word came to you when I was trying to give you my word which is a seed and I came to you and I said hey you need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your unbelief you need to let go of all your teachings your Traditions you told me I was baptized as a baby that's good enough I was baptized into the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost that's good enough that's what you told me so I I realized right there and then when my word came to you and you rejected it it's because I never knew you you never knew me you see it's hard to say but how else can I say it you know if if we don't preach the truth Jesus said the truth it'll set you free I'm bringing you the truth about his word and so the the reject that that remnant of the woman's Siege sleeping virgin remember you know Matthew 24 talks about the sleeping and the wise the wise and the foolish virgins well it's talking about the churches remember anytime you you you hear women in the New Testament in the Bible he's talking about the church Christ and the church right it's all about the virgins and there was wise virgins and there were foolish virgins the foolish virgins are going to be the ones that didn't receive the oil remember read read the scripture that they wanted the oil the oil is the Holy Ghost you can't give oil to somebody no you can't give them the Holy Ghost Christ gives them the Holy Ghost when they accept him when they when they say I I just like Mary be it unto me according to Thy word not my traditions not what the priest told me not what this one's teaching I want the word and when that happens you receive him and now the spirit of God in you can never deny the word and now you're showing that you weren't a foolish virgin you were wise you had oil you accepted you took it you you you trimmed your lamps meaning that you stayed you stayed in the Holy Ghost you stayed you know when you trim a lamp it's because you're you're trimming off all the the things that you got to get rid of in your life to keep the oil burning in your life to keep your experience going with Christ and you're and you're and you're constantly feeding on the word of God and you're you're you're attending the services and you're reading the word and you're praying with a genuine heart not praying only when things go wrong oh God and blaming God when things go wrong why did this happen you have to have a relationship and build that relationship up so that you can be in a condition that when those things happen he's there you're already fortified by the word of God and he brings you through it she goes right through that it's just as clear as this 70 of weeks just as clear and they will go through it so if you haven't got the Holy Spirit you'd better get it as quick as you can we're at the end time notice he says 7 Church ages now I won't have to go through them because we've got them on tape and they're being put on books and everything that was that was the the that was the time that God never said there'd be so many days so many hours or so many years he never said anything he said until the Gentile dispensation be finished until the walls will be trod down until God quit dealing with the Gentiles let the musicians come what a Time Saints we're at the end we're at the maturity of the Gentile bride she's coming into her fullness she didn't do anything to deserve it you didn't do anything to deserve it it's God's mercy and Grace that's given you the ability to recognize we've just we're just blessed by God's grace amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus listen here just a couple of more quotes and we're going to end it and we are not living in Luther's age Wesley's age or the Pentecostal age that Pentecostal age was only a restoration of the gifts coming to the church but we're now living in the end time we're living in a time of the calling out of the Bride we're in the bride age we need to recognize how close we are to that fullness of the Gentile dispensation this is not the day of Pentecost the Pentecostal age is passed Pentecost is gone this is Harvest Time the invisible union he says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work today day no sir he says that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home of the Bride we we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bride age Feast of the trumpets he says and the seventh Angel's message under that same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement the word Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us I've heard but now I see and then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angel's message the Seven Seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared Revelation 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service you see this is not about you coming to church and getting healed God can heal you here God can God can transform you God can get you out of your financial difficulties God can restore your relationships but are you hearing the message that's coming because God's gifts God's signs and wonders they follow they follow them that believe you got to be a believer of the word first and everything is added to you you know here it is the last quote Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence in heaven Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself doesn't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven Thunders uttered their voices and John was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord that's why all this that's happening right now it's all happening because he's here he's present he's possessing his sons and daughters of God to recognize the hour that we're in he says and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven Revelations 108 all for the purpose that he might restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers so that he might call our names under the mystery of the seventh seal all these things that you know that you need to go and study you need to read the Seven Seals you need to recognize what uh was fulfilled under Malachi 4:5 what was fulfilled under Revelations 10:7 it was all to bring us to this time now this season now the fullness of the Gentile dispensation now where we come into the fullness of the word for this day and for this hour God God bless you Saints as we continue to bring present truth this ministry is about getting people to recognize their day amen and the message that God has provided for this day we believe that that's the message that will bring the rapture we become the Rapture when we believe the word for this day God bless [Applause] you the whole world's
