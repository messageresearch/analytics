[51:07] you appreciate it I really appreciate uh
[51:11] the wonderful Brethren and their service
[51:15] especially at this particular time where
[51:17] we have this uh virus challenge it's
[51:21] challenging us challenging the church
[51:24] you know it's consuming the societ in
[51:26] the community but for us the church it's
[51:29] a challenge right uh and uh especially
[51:34] the Lord has granted me right uh you
[51:37] know I might be like a like a
[51:41] mini what should I say anyway I got a
[51:44] lot of left hands and right hands and
[51:47] feet and I want to thank uh uh the
[51:50] brenon family so much for standing
[51:53] faithful and really serving the lord and
[51:57] helping in every aspect right uh from as
[52:01] much as uh buying groceries for me when
[52:04] I needed and I can't go out or something
[52:07] like that and and uh various things I
[52:11] want to thank like brother Phillip and
[52:13] his family that steps into the Gap
[52:15] sometimes when I need them praise God
[52:18] Raman family uh Amanda and and Alvin
[52:22] over here I want to thank God for them
[52:25] praise God Hallelujah especially I mean
[52:29] they their hands
[52:31] on right and praise God for that and we
[52:35] thank God and we pray that God will
[52:37] bless them there are others that do
[52:39] various things and I appreciate I want
[52:43] every one of you to know that I
[52:45] appreciate you very much and in general
[52:49] the fact that is in the midst of all of
[52:51] this uh you are here in the house of the
[52:54] Lord to worship and praise him praise
[52:57] the Lord you know uh I know we don't
[53:00] want to be uh unwise we don't want to
[53:03] provoke God just because he's given us
[53:05] promises that he'll protect us but um at
[53:10] the same time Solomon said uh uh the
[53:13] wicked sayth uh a lion is in the streets
[53:16] I'm not going out my
[53:18] house and
[53:21] uh it's only it's in his imagination
[53:24] right and he asse a lion is in the
[53:27] street so he's not going out well this
[53:30] is not an assumption a virus is out
[53:33] there and and we we know it's out there
[53:36] but we don't have to live in fear but at
[53:39] the same time we must use our wisdom
[53:43] right we it's as simple as that and and
[53:47] as it is a lot of people don't want to
[53:50] do it because they have their freedom
[53:52] and nobody can't tell them to do and I
[53:56] want want to thank God that there's a
[53:58] big difference between uh Canada and the
[54:00] United States in that part right that
[54:03] they just want their full freedom to do
[54:05] whatever they want to do and over um
[54:09] they talk about law and and and Order
[54:12] and that sort of stuff but they don't
[54:14] listen to the law and they don't have
[54:16] any order and here the people seem to be
[54:20] trained to obey the law and to to try to
[54:25] keep the
[54:27] the nation in order and regardless of
[54:31] all these parties and differences out
[54:33] there that has nothing to do with us
[54:35] right uh nothing whatsoever uh but the
[54:39] fact is we go by the law and we try to
[54:42] obate the best we
[54:44] can as a result we're not as such as a
[54:47] bad position as they there with all the
[54:50] craziness and stuff that's uh going on
[54:53] but thank God you know um um I was uh
[54:58] listening to them uh just before I came
[55:01] out they were talking about how this is
[55:04] affecting the the kids going to
[55:07] school and uh how they have to do a lot
[55:10] of online
[55:12] learning and while I'm listening to that
[55:15] then the holy spirit says yes that's
[55:18] Satan's attempt to ramp up
[55:22] selfishness
[55:24] isolation you take care of yourself your
[55:27] watch out for yourself and to bring out
[55:31] all kinds of things from inside of
[55:35] people and
[55:36] kids because of isolation so I'm just
[55:40] telling you so that you are warned
[55:42] against that and you don't think that oh
[55:44] I just take care of my family I just
[55:46] take care of myself I just protect
[55:48] myself and all like that because these
[55:50] things are designed by Satan he's
[55:52] changing the entire world system and
[55:55] he's trying to bring out uh uh all of
[55:59] these things from in the human heart
[56:02] that might have been hidden up all kinds
[56:04] of things coming out racism coming
[56:08] out oh you get quiet it's the
[56:12] truth it's starting to emerge these
[56:15] Monsters of evil starting to emerge
[56:19] praise God and we got to watch you may
[56:23] know in your head but you got to watch
[56:26] watch that not drawn into these kinds of
[56:30] things that spiritually you're not
[56:32] controlled by these kinds of things we
[56:35] are sons of the and Daughters of the
[56:38] Living
[56:39] God we are controlled by the Holy Spirit
[56:44] we are not supposed to be blind and say
[56:46] oh I didn't see it I don't know about it
[56:48] I know about it you know about it we all
[56:51] know about it but even though you see it
[56:53] and you know about it that is the the
[56:56] victory that you could see all these
[56:59] things going on around you but you're
[57:01] not part of it you're in the world but
[57:04] you're not of the world praise God
[57:07] you're under the control of the Holy
[57:10] Spirit of the Living God Amen and we
[57:13] pray that God will have his way in every
[57:16] possible way to keep every one of us
[57:19] because these things are swirling around
[57:22] you to see if it could carry away right
[57:26] it could carry your away on a flowery
[57:29] bed of ease and take you out so soft and
[57:32] simple that you carried away where you
[57:35] start regarding blood relations stronger
[57:39] than
[57:40] spiritual between you the and Brothers
[57:42] and Sisters in Christ we start to
[57:45] consider all these things so when you
[57:48] put it all together look to
[57:51] Jesus look away to the Lord let me tell
[57:55] you why do you think he said look except
[57:58] you see if the Lord hadn't elected
[58:02] there's not a one would be
[58:05] saved right for the whole Earth shall be
[58:10] deceived amen but for the elected if it
[58:14] were
[58:15] possible but it is not possible and it's
[58:19] not possible because we Are Spiritual or
[58:21] we pray more or we read the Bible more
[58:23] or anything like that but you have a
[58:26] anchor that was placed in you before the
[58:29] foundation of the world and you are you
[58:32] are kept by the power of God through
[58:37] Revelation through
[58:39] faith Hallelujah your anchor rests
[58:43] Beyond the Veil where the glories never
[58:47] fail Hallelujah to the lamb Hallelujah
[58:51] to the lamb praise be to God thank him
[58:55] for His Marvelous love and grace
[58:57] Brothers in these sisters in these
[58:59] Troublesome times dark chaotic times
[59:04] where all kinds of opinions and ideas
[59:07] are swirling all around we can keep
[59:10] ourselves anchored on the word of God
[59:13] hallelujah regardless of what's going on
[59:15] around us amen you'll find you get
[59:18] pulled this way in your flesh pulled
[59:20] that way pull that way that's just
[59:21] natural as human but spiritually you
[59:24] keep your eyes on Jesus
[59:27] keep your eyes on the word of God
[59:30] hallelujah we thank the Lord Jesus now
[59:33] for the past uh three weeks I've been
[59:36] trying to bring the message what have
[59:38] the seals done for us and I brought the
[59:42] message and you who are in here no doubt
[59:44] heard it but it seems like the Lord
[59:48] didn't want to allow it to go out
[59:51] everywhere so even though I'm on this uh
[59:57] uh on the internet where it could go all
[59:59] around the world for some reason it was
[1:00:04] hindered uh and if you listen to it you
[1:00:07] you could see my picture clear but the
[1:00:09] voice is all garbled and everything else
[1:00:12] like that you know the song service is
[1:00:15] fine everything is fine the minute I get
[1:00:18] up here and
[1:00:19] start it's gone right you see like that
[1:00:25] so so I want you to understand don't
[1:00:28] just look at these things and the devil
[1:00:30] is going to say oh this person didn't do
[1:00:32] that or I didn't do that or this one
[1:00:34] didn't do that and and and we start to
[1:00:38] but God allows sometimes these things
[1:00:42] you can have the best equipment in the
[1:00:46] world brand new and if he doesn't want
[1:00:49] it to
[1:00:50] work you waste the whole day and night
[1:00:56] here tling there tling there nothing
[1:00:58] work until he says so right so it's not
[1:01:03] just equipment or or or or looking at
[1:01:06] this person or that person or the other
[1:01:08] person no it's looking away like I said
[1:01:12] to Jesus of course we have to do our due
[1:01:16] diligence but the fact is it's looking
[1:01:18] to the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so
[1:01:22] let's keep our eyes on Jesus regardless
[1:01:25] of what happens around us may the Lord
[1:01:27] bless you pray for me and I pray for you
[1:01:29] look we're in a war we're in a battle
[1:01:33] praise God virus this that that behind
[1:01:38] all of that is Satan the Puppet
[1:01:41] Master he's pulling all the strings so
[1:01:45] don't look at this individual thing that
[1:01:46] individual thing look who's behind the
[1:01:49] scenes and he would want to quiet
[1:01:52] everything down oh there is no Satan
[1:01:56] you're crazy to be talking about evil
[1:01:58] spirits in the modern day you know what
[1:02:02] kind listen
[1:02:04] friends I I I've prayed for people and
[1:02:07] cast out Devils from people that had a
[1:02:10] nicotine
[1:02:11] Spirit nicotine Spirit oh that's just a
[1:02:14] habit right well said oh that man Jesus
[1:02:18] said come out you dumb devil you deaf
[1:02:22] Spirit come he called some of those
[1:02:24] things devil
[1:02:27] right but when you call it that today
[1:02:29] you sound like you're out of your mind
[1:02:31] you're out of sync with things you're
[1:02:32] not modern you're oldfashioned those
[1:02:35] were the days of superstition it it
[1:02:38] doesn't happen anymore let me tell you
[1:02:39] they're right here they're right among
[1:02:42] us but they tried to make the people
[1:02:45] dumb down and think oh there is no devil
[1:02:48] there was no Satan it's just the virus
[1:02:52] science will take care of that and so on
[1:02:55] well
[1:02:56] I I don't want to go into that
[1:02:58] discussion science is are from the
[1:03:00] branch of the tree of Good and Evil so
[1:03:02] it does some good but while it's doing
[1:03:04] you some good it does all the evil at
[1:03:06] the same time and uh uh he uses all
[1:03:09] those things to try to hide behind the
[1:03:13] scenes and then commit all these crimes
[1:03:16] or these evils upon the human race you
[1:03:20] know and when I see sometimes some
[1:03:22] people passing by my house walking and
[1:03:24] they could barely walk walking it going
[1:03:26] like that and I sometimes I shake my
[1:03:28] head look what Satan has done to the
[1:03:31] human race that we have to come down to
[1:03:35] old
[1:03:35] age no matter who you are king or
[1:03:39] commoner you get to a point you start
[1:03:41] feeling pains here and aches there
[1:03:44] praise the
[1:03:45] Lord amen you start feeling it whether
[1:03:48] you like it or not because that's what
[1:03:51] sin did to the entire human race amen
[1:03:55] but thank God God Jesus came to reverse
[1:03:58] the
[1:03:59] curse and take us back and bring us back
[1:04:02] to the way we were in the beginning

[1:12:46] be uh talking with a
[1:12:49] brother and that is how this message or
[1:12:54] this Revelation or you want to just say
[1:12:56] it's a thought well that's fine uh came
[1:12:59] to
[1:13:00] me that this
[1:13:04] thief represents every one of
[1:13:08] us uh because we in the last Church
[1:13:13] age you know we we condemned we lost
[1:13:16] without him we're finished the countdown
[1:13:19] is already on the ages are passed and
[1:13:24] and and and there's no no other person
[1:13:26] that can save us or pull us out of
[1:13:29] this and here is this
[1:13:33] thief no judge nobody not pilot nobody
[1:13:37] at that point and he turns around and
[1:13:41] says Lord remember
[1:13:44] me and when I was telling the story to
[1:13:47] the brother then the holy spirit says
[1:13:49] yes that is the attribute of God in him
[1:13:54] calling for
[1:13:56] remembrance so that is what I want to
[1:13:59] talk about here today for a short while
[1:14:01] attribute of God calling for
[1:14:06] remembrance and so this
[1:14:11] thief with the seed the gene of God in
[1:14:16] him and feeling that he was
[1:14:19] forgotten not knowing that Jesus went to
[1:14:23] the Cross to to save redeem buy back
[1:14:28] people like him and that he was only the
[1:14:34] representation that just as much as he
[1:14:37] would cry out for
[1:14:39] remembrance that he only represented the
[1:14:43] entire human race that had a gene a life
[1:14:47] a germ of God in them that in their soul
[1:14:51] will be crying out to God and say Lord
[1:14:55] remember
[1:14:57] me remember me with all the problems and
[1:15:01] troubles swirling around we want to say
[1:15:04] Lord remember me don't forget me
[1:15:07] Lord amen fny cross me said Lord when on
[1:15:12] others thou were calling amen do not
[1:15:16] pass me by Brother BR said he has to
[1:15:20] pass your way all the other ages you
[1:15:23] called out to PR you called out a little
[1:15:26] flock amen and now the last Church age
[1:15:29] has is here upon us we're at the last
[1:15:32] minute now right now Lord remember us
[1:15:36] there's supposed to be a
[1:15:37] Rapture we're supposed to be going out
[1:15:40] of here Lord and when I go I want to go
[1:15:43] with you I don't want to walk to Jordan
[1:15:46] alone but I want to go with you and I
[1:15:49] cross over to the other side by the help
[1:15:51] of God and by the anointing of the Holy
[1:15:54] Spirit
[1:15:56] oh the attribute of God in
[1:15:59] him was calling out for
[1:16:03] remembrance and now we can stay on that
[1:16:07] and expand the thought follow it track
[1:16:10] it down but I'm thinking of the children
[1:16:15] of Abraham the children of Israel when
[1:16:19] God promised him oh after 400 years
[1:16:26] your children going to be in
[1:16:28] bondage they're going to be there in
[1:16:31] Egypt and then after the 400 years I'm
[1:16:35] going to bring them out by a mighty
[1:16:39] hand hallu hallelujah oh praise God now
[1:16:44] when we look in the Bible Exodus 2:23
[1:16:48] to2 the Bible said the children of
[1:16:51] Israel groaning under the bondage of
[1:16:55] pharaoh and all the things that were put
[1:16:58] upon them groaning and crying out for
[1:17:02] Relief then the Bible says and then they
[1:17:05] Cried unto the Lord hallelujah and the
[1:17:09] Bible says and the Lord heard their
[1:17:12] cries the Lord remembered his promise
[1:17:17] that gave to Abraham and his seed
[1:17:21] forever oh praise God hallelujah every
[1:17:24] every attribute of God has a right to
[1:17:28] cry out Lord Remember Me Lord remember
[1:17:32] me praise God when Tears are Falling
[1:17:35] Down Lord remember me when there's
[1:17:38] struges all around remember me when I
[1:17:42] come to the river of Jordan Lord
[1:17:45] hallelujah Don't Forget Me Lord but
[1:17:47] remember
[1:17:49] me oh they cried to the Lord and the
[1:17:53] Lord heard the their cries because it
[1:17:57] was the attribute of Abraham in them
[1:18:01] that was crying out for remembrance
[1:18:04] glory to God hallelujah
[1:18:06] amen then I began also to think of
[1:18:12] Samson and I'm not dwelling on these
[1:18:15] individually because you know enough
[1:18:18] that you can go to your Bibles you can
[1:18:21] go to your sources and search out these
[1:18:24] things
[1:18:25] magnify and expand on them how that
[1:18:29] Samson as you know as a servant called
[1:18:33] by God to do the will and purpose of God
[1:18:36] and there he
[1:18:39] was in
[1:18:42] bondage bound made blind and there he is
[1:18:48] carrying out this great work of grinding
[1:18:52] meals oh my
[1:18:55] and the Bible tells us how he was
[1:18:58] blinded by this
[1:19:01] Harlot you think spiritually I I you
[1:19:04] know I just passed by that but he was
[1:19:06] blinded by this
[1:19:08] Harlot beautiful woman uh and and in you
[1:19:13] know he was attracted by her but the
[1:19:15] Harlot blinded him and we have another
[1:19:18] spiritual Harlot today according to
[1:19:20] Revelation 9 1819 in there but here he
[1:19:24] was was blinded by her doctrines and her
[1:19:27] teachings and her precepts and
[1:19:31] there he's by himself in the
[1:19:34] dark after she had him bound stripped
[1:19:40] everything taken away from him all every
[1:19:44] truth every Revelation from every age
[1:19:48] tripped away oh my and he's left in
[1:19:53] philistia
[1:19:55] my God and in the darkness of his
[1:19:59] dungeon and of his
[1:20:01] blindness he cried to the Lord and you
[1:20:05] know it he said Lord remember me
[1:20:09] remember your servant you'll find that
[1:20:11] in judges 16:28 he actually uses the
[1:20:14] word Lord remember
[1:20:17] me why it was an the attribute of God in
[1:20:22] him that knew that if God raised him up
[1:20:26] for a purpose and he hadn't yet finished
[1:20:29] or fulfilled that purpose then he got a
[1:20:33] right to cry out once more Lord once
[1:20:36] more father God hallelujah amen just
[1:20:40] like Abraham knew God gave him a son and
[1:20:43] then God said take the son and sacrifice
[1:20:45] him up on the
[1:20:47] mount and he says yes we're going to go
[1:20:49] and do it and then he tells the servants
[1:20:52] at the bottom of the mountain he says
[1:20:54] just wait here I and the lad will go and
[1:20:59] return amen hallelujah why he knew says
[1:21:03] I give you a son and he's going to be
[1:21:06] your Heir that's going to do this this
[1:21:08] this that and he hadn't done it yet so
[1:21:10] what's the difference to me whether God
[1:21:12] want me to sacrifice him and you raise
[1:21:14] him up whether what God do whatever the
[1:21:16] matter I coming back with a
[1:21:19] son I don't care what the situation is I
[1:21:23] am coming back with my son hallelujah
[1:21:27] praise God Amen so don't look at what's
[1:21:30] going on around you what this one is
[1:21:32] saying that one is saying all the
[1:21:35] circumstances keep your eyes on the
[1:21:37] promise Look Away to Jesus keep your
[1:21:41] eyes on the word of God and don't be
[1:21:43] swayed this way or that way God gave a
[1:21:46] promise for this age and we are resting
[1:21:49] on that glory to God hallelujah it's got
[1:21:53] to be fulfilled
[1:21:55] and the Fulfillment of it is complete
[1:21:58] when you're going to
[1:22:00] Rapture Hallelujah when you're
[1:22:03] physically taken out of here praise the
[1:22:06] Lord and so he says Lord remember
[1:22:11] me oh praise
[1:22:14] God I want in my heart to thank him that
[1:22:20] he remembered
[1:22:21] me and that is why he could come and
[1:22:26] reveal his word that I might Know Who I
[1:22:30] Am Lord who I am I can see now who I am
[1:22:37] I'm a part of that Revelation that I'm
[1:22:40] talking about I'm talking about it and I
[1:22:43] am part of it I'm part of that
[1:22:47] word glory to God Paul said if the
[1:22:51] princes of this world knew there would
[1:22:54] not have crucified the Lord Of
[1:22:58] Glory what they didn't know is that the
[1:23:01] wife was hidden inside the
[1:23:05] husband what they didn't know is that
[1:23:09] the bride was in the
[1:23:11] bridegroom what they did not know is
[1:23:15] that the word was in the
[1:23:17] word praise God hallelujah amen amen
[1:23:22] thanks be to God I give him glory

[1:23:30] things talking with the Lord the Holy
[1:23:34] Spirit and I just wrote it

[1:23:43] God are now
[1:23:46] revealed and manifested as words made
[1:23:52] flesh Hallelujah
[1:23:57] by now I'm putting my thought here by
[1:24:00] his spoken word we
[1:24:04] know what he was
[1:24:08] thinking

[1:24:14] was thinking

[1:24:22] original thought
[1:24:25] the spoken word is the Original Seed and
[1:24:29] that spoken word when it's manifested is
[1:24:31] the original thought of God now
[1:24:35] expressed upon the face of the Earth we
[1:24:38] want to give God praise and thank him
[1:24:40] and give him glory amen praise the name
[1:24:43] of the Lord hallelujah so here we are as

[1:59:51] vision
[1:59:52] of a baby being healed and so
[1:59:55] on and he went to the home to pray for
[1:59:58] the child it was
[2:00:00] inable and when he went in to pray for
[2:00:04] the
[2:00:05] child he prayed for it the child didn't
[2:00:09] get
[2:00:11] better and he said oh Lord what what
[2:00:14] what then the holy spirit says no you
[2:00:17] didn't
[2:00:18] wait you remember in the vision the
[2:00:22] grandmother is supposed to come
[2:00:25] in and she's supposed to sit on four

[2:00:33] on when you see that then you
[2:00:37] pray and all will be

[2:00:51] and he told them that he made a mistake

[2:01:03] patience with me do you still believe me
[2:01:05] uh to be his servant and that what he
[2:01:08] tells me is the truth he said when I
