[15:58] sister
[15:59] I thank everyone of you for coming out
[16:01] tonight in the name of the Lord and
[16:04] Savior Jesus
[16:06] Christ I know some of you has worked
[16:09] very hard it's but it's worth it for you
[16:13] to be here because when we look without
[16:18] Jesus we are
[16:20] nothing we all we give him all the
[16:23] praise and glory and honor amen
[16:26] because my wife was telling me even
[16:30] today he saw in my country news there
[16:34] was a guy that used to give when they
[16:38] vote he is the guy that give news and he
[16:43] in this studio the people that count the
[16:45] vote for the nation and he was working
[16:49] in a studio and all of a sudden he says
[16:52] I don't feel good and they pick him and
[16:54] to the hospital by the time they reach
[16:56] his dead so life is short so everything
[17:01] that we do we must give glory and honor
[17:05] to the Lord face because without him we
[17:09] are
[17:10] nothing and I won't take my
[17:14] time H I'll point you to the scriptures
[17:18] because uh blessed be the name of the
[17:21] Lord I know I'm not a a big
[17:25] speaker
[17:27] oh whatever when I say big speaker I'm
[17:31] not a a good reader and a good big
[17:35] speaker but hey whatever God give it to
[17:39] me that's what I'm going to
[17:41] bring because the scripture that I'm
[17:45] bringing today I tell you the
[17:48] truth I was not even thinking about that
[17:52] scripture at all I already have my
[17:55] scriptures I have my everything

[18:14] you know me you know me better than
[18:19] anybody and my education is not good I
[18:22] can read very very nice and things and
[18:26] all of a sudden
[18:28] the Lord brought this scripture to me
[18:31] alive and from I'll say from
[18:36] 5:00 to
[18:38] 8:00 I was
[18:40] weeping I was really really
[18:43] crying I cried to the Lord won't let it
[18:46] go because the scripture just
[18:50] like come alive to
[18:53] me I can't even explain it so anyway
[18:57] it's a simple simple simple like I know
[19:00] the scripture but it's a simple but that
[19:02] one that scripture I never even thought
[19:05] I was going to speak but he says this is
[19:08] what I give it to you
[19:12] so
[19:14] uh Cory lead us in prayer then we go
[19:22] it's yeah you can stand there the
[19:24] brother will give you the mic you pray

[19:33] the word approach your word anoint your
[19:35] servant tonight put the words in his
[19:37] mouth that you desire him to speak yes
[19:39] Lord move him aside go beyond his
[19:41] comprehension go beyond his speech go
[19:43] beyond his heart anoint and possess his
[19:46] vessel speak through him and in turn
[19:49] help us Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen
[19:52] amen uh the scripture we take in John
[19:57] chapter
[19:59] uh
[20:01] 21 verse
[20:03] [Music]
[20:04] 14
[20:07] to
[20:10] 17 and it read like this this is sorry
[20:17] this is now the third time that Jesus
[20:21] show himself to his
[20:24] disciples after that he was
[20:28] ER raisen from the dead so when they had
[20:35] D Jesus said unto Simon
[20:40] Peter
[20:42] Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me more
[20:48] than this he said unto him y Lord thou
[20:54] knowest that I love thee he he said unto
[20:59] him feed my
[21:03] lamb he said unto him again the second
[21:08] time Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me
[21:14] he said unto him yeah Lord thou knowest
[21:20] that I love thee he said unto him feed
[21:25] my
[21:26] sheep he said unto him the third time
[21:32] Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me
[21:37] Peter
[21:39] answer sorry Peter was grieve because he
[21:43] said unto him the third time lovest thou
[21:48] me and he said unto him Lord thou
[21:52] knowest all things thou knowest that I
[21:57] love of thee Jesus said unto him feed my
[22:05] sheep this is the scripture the lord
[22:08] gave it to me this
[22:10] morning
[22:12] and may you please everyone be
[22:17] seated I never even thought or think of
[22:21] of bringing this scripture but the Lord
[22:24] just give it to me says go and speak
[22:27] this
[22:30] to my
[22:32] sheep my children go and feed them with
[22:37] a word like
[22:40] that and my topic is
[22:46] God my title sorry my title is God
[22:49] revealing the hidden plan to his own
[22:55] wife because without him reveal
[22:57] revealing his own word to his own wife
[23:02] as
[23:04] individuals none of us will be
[23:08] saved
[23:10] but that's the reason why he himself had
[23:15] decide to come down amen that's why he
[23:18] told he brother Brown says I must
[23:21] decrease he must increase because he was
[23:25] here he himself is here and
[23:29] now he himself going to go to individual
[23:33] within even the message to reveal
[23:38] it because
[23:40] why
[23:42] God knows each and every one of his
[23:46] children more than even any preacher can
[23:52] speak because without he himself doing
[23:56] it all all of us will be
[24:00] lost and if you could watch the
[24:04] scripture that we read even though Peter
[24:07] had his brothers that
[24:10] time the which were called
[24:14] Apostles the Lord didn't speak that word
[24:17] to all the
[24:19] apostles he spoke to Peter alone
[24:23] amen because it was specific for people
[24:27] Peter
[24:30] alone Peter alone was the the the world
[24:35] that Peter was going to
[24:38] fulfill the Lord went to
[24:42] him and let him
[24:45] know that that is the pl the word that
[24:50] he has chos in him and sent him to this
[24:55] world to come and do it
[24:59] and I want to say this to
[25:03] you if you are God's Bri the wife you
[25:07] should not
[25:09] worry just Rel relax your
[25:14] heart just feed on the
[25:17] word in the season of time God by his
[25:22] grace will come to you as you feed on
[25:26] the word
[25:29] God will come to you and open your
[25:33] understanding and show you and
[25:36] positionally place you in
[25:40] him then you wouldn't
[25:43] struggle you wouldn't
[25:45] worry I'm taking my time because you
[25:49] know
[25:50] why I don't want to speed
[25:53] up I know that when I get too excited
[25:56] and I don't take my time and maybe I
[25:58] will go off the devil can take me and
[26:02] take my mind and go off little bit but
[26:05] no I'm really taking my time to get the
[26:09] word to Zeal in because God made this
[26:14] word plain to me
[26:19] today he said
[26:22] look my
[26:24] word All My Children
[26:29] I'm going to go to
[26:30] them one by one north south east
[26:36] west and I'm going to go to them like
[26:39] that and let them
[26:41] know
[26:43] what kind of Jo in me what kind of
[26:49] position I really place them what they
[26:53] must do for me because otherwise they
[26:57] they cannot even fulfill the
[27:01] word because if he leave it to man kind
[27:07] hands everything will go
[27:10] chaos that's why he is
[27:14] now
[27:17] here when he told Peter says Peter feed
[27:22] my sheep feed my
[27:24] land Peter even didn't know because
[27:27] because Peter was
[27:29] illiterate Peter couldn't read and write
[27:32] to Peter like he would go for Fisher
[27:35] fish fish to catch fish that was his job
[27:41] Peter was a man that will Cur will swear
[27:45] would do things that was
[27:48] ungodly but God knew his heart he knows
[27:52] what kind of seed he has placed in him
[27:56] amen and he knows how to get that seed
[28:01] out because no Priest No Pope no King no
[28:05] man could bring that seed out only the
[28:08] Lord and Savior Jesus
[28:10] Christ and so is each and every one of
[28:16] us that's why it's important to be in
[28:19] the presence of the Lord because as the
[28:23] word
[28:25] comes the word will reveal to
[28:29] you the world will put you in a
[28:32] preparation to go down into your
[28:36] knes the word will put you into
[28:39] preparation all the things that are
[28:42] hidden in you that is not
[28:44] right the word will clean you
[28:48] up there
[28:50] later here little then God begin to
[28:54] clean it
[28:55] up and positionally place you in him
[28:59] because he will speak to
[29:01] you believe me today only the Lord know
[29:05] this was like the the Bible was like
[29:07] lifting up a a man coming out from the
[29:10] Bible to me it was
[29:14] sry even 12:00 God is my witness he was
[29:18] saying to me go feed my sheep feed my
[29:22] lamb feed my sheep he he told me he says
[29:26] this scripture is
[29:28] you says forget about Peter I give it to
[29:32] Peter when Peter was I was dealing at
[29:35] that time with de generation but it's
[29:38] now your generation come on your hour
[29:42] that's it your time your season yes sir
[29:46] your oh
[29:49] my the word was making plain to me like
[29:54] I said my God
[29:57] this is so
[29:59] real
[30:01] because who am
[30:03] I I I even think
[30:07] that I Lord I can't do this because I I
[30:12] don't know what I'm going to even come
[30:14] even here what am I going to stand in
[30:17] front of my brothers and sisters and
[30:19] speak to them I don't know how what to
[30:22] say but he he has told me he says go
[30:26] feed my sheep he says look every
[30:29] scripture in the
[30:31] Bible that you pick and read it that you
[30:37] can read you just go and start and talk
[30:40] about me I will be there I will let them
[30:44] know it's not you wherever your foot
[30:47] will step I will let the people that I'm
[30:50] speaking to I will let them know that
[30:54] yes I'm in you because when I was in
[30:58] William Braham it was not William Braham
[31:01] that did it William Braham couldn't do
[31:04] nothing I the Lord thy God did it I the
[31:09] Lord thy God is going to do it for your
[31:13] generation I'm going to do it for you
[31:16] I'm going to be with you I'm going to
[31:19] show you my way things that you have to

[39:29] telling you tonight brother I was even

[39:34] should bring you tonight that's why for

[40:12] Him don't know how to give him praise
[40:15] don't know what he has done for us we we

[41:13] Braham he oh God when he was passing or
[41:16] preaching sometimes sickness free from
[41:19] the people that's why blind people I
[41:23] could go that's why oh Jesus Jesus Jesus
[41:29] the prophet saw it clear and clear as
[41:33] clean the best I can put it if you go in
[41:37] African jungle and there's water raining
[41:40] right in the jungle because there's no
[41:42] chemicals and the water becom so clean
[41:46] you could even pick that water and and
[41:49] and just drink it and it will be so good
[41:52] in your mouth because it's a real water
[41:54] not this chemical water we drink here or
[41:57] and even in Canada they have lot of
[41:59] waters if you go some part of Canada you
[42:02] can get clear water like that and drink
[42:05] it with no chemicals inside brother brah
[42:09] was seeing the word of God real like
[42:12] that and it's time for us to see the
[42:16] word coming to us real like that not
[42:19] that the word going to stay in in the
[42:22] page the word of God have to come alive
[42:26] so that you could see the path God chose
[42:30] you that if you are a sister we know
[42:33] that the sisters doesn't preach but
[42:35] there is something as a sister God want
[42:38] you to do some of them went with the
[42:41] brothers to Mission field some of them
[42:44] they they support the kingdom of God
[42:46] whether you cooking whether you sleeping
[42:48] whether you oh God help each sister to
[42:52] know their clear clear position in
[42:55] Christ so that this word of God it will
[42:59] line every person up that is my heart
[43:04] for you because God is calling he's
[43:08] calling us he's not going to leave us to
[43:11] warm the PE we are not P warmers God
[43:14] didn't call us to come to church just
[43:17] like the denominations are worshiping
[43:20] and going to church every day every day
[43:22] every day every day that's denomination
[43:25] way but as we are here for certain time
[43:29] and we will be gone cut up and meet the
[43:31] Lord in the air so we our time is short
[43:36] so let us be surrendered to the word of
[43:39] God if that word has come read to us
[43:43] like that let me tell you we cannot even
[43:46] stay home we can't even relax we can't
[43:49] even oh my God today the way the Lord
[43:53] was dealing with me my goodness
[43:56] I say Lord this is real to me if this is
[44:00] not you I don't know if this is not the
[44:03] god of brother Abraham I don't know any
[44:06] God of brother Braham then don't tell me
[44:08] about all brother Braham code or all
[44:11] brother Braham tape but this is real to
[44:14] me like that because he's so real he
[44:17] says I am God I change not I lie not I
[44:20] am God who does not sleep nor Slumber
[44:25] let me tell you all uh even by showing
[44:29] this scripture to Peter alone do you
[44:32] know God also was showing
[44:35] to we Gentiles that will come that he
[44:38] going to deal with us as individuals as
[44:42] acts
[44:43] 15:14 do you know as Simeon prophesy God
[44:47] will come to Gentiles and take a people
[44:49] for his name sake right and he says you
[44:52] Gentiles one part of the scripture which
[44:55] I forgot
[44:56] but I know he's in there he says I'm I'm
[44:59] coming to you Gentiles I one will be in
[45:02] the bed and I'll take one and leave one
[45:05] right because why he deal with us as
[45:08] individuals so the scripture puffer to
[45:12] me as individual so would you your
[45:15] scripture have to Puff off to you as
[45:18] individual then you will know you'll be

[50:42] and Mery to us he's pouring out his
[50:47] himself more and more and more that we
[50:50] can see that even Believers that W won
[50:55] won't come to service Believers there
[50:58] are his children that won't come when
[51:01] they when the god begin to do something
[51:05] for them their heart will be start to
[51:07] bubbling to be in his presence let me
[51:10] tell you no matter what happened unless
[51:12] you are working or something serious has
[51:16] happened be in his present be in the
[51:18] prayer meeting be in the tape be in the
[51:22] books those that can read read the books
[51:25] those that can H listen to the tape
[51:28] listen to it don't put it in the shf
[51:31] don't let the books stay in the shf
[51:34] don't let the service part oh this
[51:37] brother is preaching maybe he's not good
[51:40] his English is is not right proper so I
[51:44] don't come to church I love people that
[51:47] preach with fire and brimstone holy no
[51:50] it's 54 Ministry it's 54 Ministry
[51:56] whether is one word that will transform
[51:59] you come to his presence all those that
[52:03] are watching me tonight if you are
[52:06] watching you staying home come to his
[52:09] presence if you are unless you are old
[52:12] you are sick otherwise come to his
[52:15] presence we need the word of God to feed
[52:21] on because this word is the one that
[52:24] going to change you and I to meet the
[52:27] Lord in the air if you are waiting that
[52:30] the Lord going to come in flesh in our
[52:33] day then my brother my sister you don't
[52:36] know what you are looking for he's
[52:39] already here he's already here that's
[52:42] why the prophet says check 2,000 years
[52:45] ago John the Baptist saw Jesus he says I
[52:48] must decrease he must increase right
[52:51] that time Jesus was here alive
[52:54] physically but today is spiritually so
[52:58] when brother Brown says I must decrease
[53:01] he must increase he was here that's why
[53:05] William Brown said so so now he is here
[53:09] is US that have to feed on the word
[53:12] that's why he allowed the prophet to LIF
[53:15] tapes to leave the books so that we will
[53:19] come and CE it and we will eat those
[53:23] tapes and books we will read it those
[53:26] tips and book read the Bible and as we
[53:30] eat we we we become what we eat we
[53:34] change we are
[53:36] transforming there a little here a
[53:38] little there a little and one day you
[53:41] just you gone but if you are not eating
[53:46] the word then you will be like what as
[53:49] the word so check yourself who what
[53:53] thing are you feeding on
[53:56] what thing are you feeding on are you
[53:58] feeding on the word of God or are you
[54:01] feeding on the world then as you feed on
[54:05] the world you become the world the
[54:08] denomination feed on denomination
[54:11] Doctrine they become denomination
[54:14] Doctrine but if you feed on Christ you
[54:17] become what Christlike so Christ the
[54:22] anointed word is here is here in flesh
[54:26] the brother says preach brother Des one
[54:28] preach about light I was thinking about
[54:30] water I have a message about water I
[54:33] have a message about Stone I let me tell
[54:37] you I have a message about faith but all
[54:41] this the Lord has pushed it away says

[55:01] sheep feed my sheep feed my lamb and I
[55:05] said Lord me what am I going to say
[55:07] about this scripture but it doesn't
[55:09] matter what what I'm going to say or do

[55:17] I'm coming right to give it to you as he
[55:20] gave it to me and let me tell you eat it

[57:43] be what added onto you if you seek me
[57:47] first I'll add everything you need
[57:50] you'll never be lack you'll never be
[57:53] worried even if sickness hit you I I can
[57:58] take that sickness from you unless I'm
[58:01] ready to take you home you won't have no
[58:04] fear because you'll be strong you have
[58:06] you ever seen a a a weak Eagle have you
[58:10] ever seen you born check it you never
[58:14] see Eagle that is weak every Eagle is
[58:18] strong and tough every Eagle they can
[58:22] catch a sheep they can catch snake they
[58:27] can catch all kinds of meat and eat it
[58:31] they says I was checking H an eagle
[58:34] before he pass away he have eat almost
[58:38] close to 300 snakes only even snake
[58:41] alone on the head one Eagle so Eagle is
[58:46] not a something you could joke around
[58:50] don't you know that's why God typed his
[58:52] Spirit as Eagle you are eagle you are
[58:55] eagles of the day you are the ones that
[58:58] will if you allow the word to fortify
[59:02] your heart it all bring those that need
[59:05] to come in you don't need to do by your
[59:08] own power oh I'm going to meet this one
[59:11] and talk to him oh I know this I know
[59:14] that no you cannot do it I can do it but
[59:18] when you surrender the word is like a
[59:21] steam as soon as you see the person it
[59:24] will draw to them the word will pull
[59:28] them to you the word will bring them and
[59:31] you open your mouth that spoken word
[59:34] will be right in your lips to speak the
[59:37] right word the appropriate word it will
[59:41] pierce the person heart to go through
[59:44] hard the the heart and bring the person
[59:48] in it won't be you doing it you will
[59:51] know like as our pastor says when he
[59:54] went to Brother Gabriel it was the
[59:57] spoken word that pierced his heart but
[1:00:00] once they says brother God bless you it
[1:00:03] pieres heart but he couldn't see that
[1:00:06] time because when God do operation is
[1:00:10] not physical operation it's spiritual
[1:00:14] operation it pierc the heart without a
[1:00:17] person knowing he
[1:00:19] been the Lord Has Done surgery for him
[1:00:22] or her you are the
[1:00:25] God mouth God mouth is you don't look at
[1:00:29] anybody going to do the job it's you and
[1:00:32] me and if we don't do it who going to do
[1:00:35] it if we are not coming to service how
[1:00:38] we going to do it who are we feeding are
[1:00:43] we feeding from the devil more than
[1:00:46] feeding from God if we are feeding from
[1:00:50] God more then we need to show ourself
[1:00:53] and receive the the word of God that
[1:00:56] pertain to us so that God could do the
[1:01:01] work that he has promised us that he
[1:01:05] will do because each and every one of us
[1:01:08] let me tell you you have a work to do
[1:01:12] there is a work for you to do but when
[1:01:16] cultural hookers myself your you and K
[1:01:22] then we cannot do it because culture
[1:01:25] will make you feel oh if I do this and I
[1:01:28] make mistake and so what the Bible has
[1:01:32] completely told you the righteous man
[1:01:36] falls seven
[1:01:38] times he rise up what seven times those
[1:01:44] scriptures are not something push around
[1:01:47] it's real is real even preachers speak
[1:01:52] sometime they make mistake

[1:02:01] you know God can let his servant say
[1:02:03] something

[1:02:08] criticize him criticize this criticize
[1:02:10] that criticize that behind the scene
[1:02:14] don't you know when you do that you are
[1:02:15] criticizing God because let me tell you

[1:02:42] from that he says no let's go so finally
[1:02:48] we we were trying to go then we turn I
[1:02:51] turn him back then we went while you

[1:04:23] word
[1:04:24] let me tell you God have to come so hard
[1:04:27] on
[1:04:28] me then I open my mouth and I will
[1:04:35] speak not knowing the things the brother
[1:04:40] heart he has
[1:04:43] repented and God wanted to speak lip to
[1:04:48] ear to him to a point the Lord was
[1:04:51] speaking and asking him do you know his
[1:04:54] me standing here you know the man that
[1:04:57] is speaking don't know God was asking
[1:05:00] him have you seen it's me speaking
[1:05:03] direct to
[1:05:05] you says I'm speaking your
[1:05:08] heart he says yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord

[1:05:22] him his say in my eye what the people
[1:05:26] are criticizing you I have already
[1:05:28] forgive you I don't see you have done
[1:05:32] anything wrong just go and do my work I
[1:05:36] have the work for you don't worry about
[1:05:39] how they criticizing you just go do the
[1:05:42] work of
[1:05:46] God what are you going to say what I'm
[1:05:49] going to
[1:05:51] say brothers and sisters
[1:05:56] God we have to allow him to do his
[1:06:00] work we have to allow the Lord to do his
[1:06:04] work and our mouth should be
[1:06:09] zipped if he haven't asked you to speak
[1:06:13] let your mouth zip on the word but if he
[1:06:18] ask you to speak speak as Eagle wanted
[1:06:21] to catch a fish or submit to
[1:06:26] it
[1:06:28] come and speak
[1:06:30] it and just go and let the Lord have his
[1:06:34] way amen because if you do like
[1:06:39] that God will get the
[1:06:42] glory let me tell you God is not about
[1:06:47] you it's him it's all about him that's
[1:06:50] it it's all about Jesus Christ it's not
[1:06:54] this gospel is not even about brother
[1:06:57] Abraham I'm afraid sometime we mention
[1:07:00] brother Abraham name too
[1:07:02] much we've been mentioning the prophet
[1:07:05] name too much I know he was a prophet
[1:07:08] you know he was a prophet who sent him
[1:07:12] Jesus Christ we have to live Jesus we
[1:07:16] have to live
[1:07:19] Jesus that's why the Lord even when
[1:07:22] Moses was doing something signs and
[1:07:24] wonders the Israelites were looking at
[1:07:26] Moses that Moses was the one that was
[1:07:29] doing it the Lord took him of the
[1:07:33] sea that's why you have taken brother
[1:07:35] Braham of the sea so that our eye could
[1:07:39] go who Jesus
[1:07:42] Christ brother Abraham was pointing us
[1:07:44] to Jesus Christ but because God the
[1:07:48] fullness of God in these last days came
[1:07:51] on brother
[1:07:52] Braham
[1:07:54] and fulfill the
[1:07:56] word then the people were looking to
[1:07:59] brother Brown God use him he surrender
[1:08:04] let us
[1:08:05] surrender we know he's a prophet of 20th
[1:08:10] century I believe in that may the Lord
[1:08:13] bless every one of you I wouldn't
[1:08:18] take Give Me 2 minutes then I'll let you
[1:08:22] is that okay my brother
[1:08:24] all right brother
[1:08:27] Abraham let me tell you if you tell me
[1:08:30] that he's not a prophet you you better
[1:08:34] prepare because I believe every word
[1:08:38] William Braham
[1:08:40] spoke if William brah is not a prophet
[1:08:43] then this 20th century I don't know no
[1:08:46] Prophet because all
[1:08:49] what even
[1:08:51] me seeing from the scriptures is all
[1:08:55] about what brother Abraham preached
[1:08:58] otherwise I won't cease it because
[1:09:01] Christ was in Willam
[1:09:03] Braham and now the seven seal has opened
[1:09:06] to us and showing us a
[1:09:10] leading and now Christ is saying I am
[1:09:14] with
[1:09:15] you I will always be with you my
[1:09:19] blessing will always be with you
[1:09:21] wherever you are wherever you go
[1:09:24] whatever you
[1:09:26] do let your heart do it and God will
[1:09:31] honor you and bless you glory will go to
[1:09:36] God the
[1:09:38] hidden word of God is now revealed to
[1:09:43] God's
[1:09:44] bride that's all I have
[1:09:47] [Applause]
[1:09:50] tonight hallelujah thank you Jesus Jesus
[1:09:54] God bless you my brother amen the Lord
[1:09:57] has simple ministers too we know that uh
[1:10:01] brother coffee is a very uh humble
[1:10:04] brother and you know he just he just uh
[1:10:07] brought tonight the simple thought that
[1:10:11] Jesus was showing there because he made
[1:10:12] a good point there when he said that
[1:10:15] Jesus spoke to Peter Peter was just a
[1:10:17] fisherman he was illiterate he wasn't
[1:10:19] smart you know and knowledgeable all he
[1:10:22] knew was to fish that's all he knew but
[1:10:26] God still went to him and he asked him
[1:10:28] three times imagine he say why would he
[1:10:30] ask him three times because he wanted to
[1:10:33] make sure Peter understood who was
[1:10:36] talking to him do you really love me do
[1:10:40] you really know who's speaking to you do
[1:10:42] you know who I am he says because in the
[1:10:46] Simplicity of of the fact that you've
[1:10:49] been given eyes to see and to recognize
[1:10:51] Who I Am the rest of the world world
[1:10:54] can't see it and just as simple as you
[1:10:57] know our brother came here tonight and
[1:11:00] you know he's not a great reader he you
[1:11:02] know he he doesn't read a lot of quotes
[1:11:05] you know he doesn't uh you know he just
[1:11:07] he just speaks from his heart and God
[1:11:09] was showing us here tonight that when he
[1:11:13] speaks in Simplicity if you can hear his
[1:11:16] voice you'll be
[1:11:18] blessed okay brother brandham mentioned
[1:11:21] you know he was asked about this very
[1:11:24] scripture and and they asked him what do
[1:11:26] you mean by that and brother Braham says
[1:11:28] well it's just simple it's Jesus telling
[1:11:32] you that you need to feed on the word
[1:11:34] not on the teachings of man not on
[1:11:37] anybody else's interpretation on the
[1:11:39] word just speak the word the hidden Mana
[1:11:44] is the word when they were out in the
[1:11:45] wilderness for 40 years they were
[1:11:48] receiving hidden Mana they were
[1:11:50] receiving fresh every single day because
[1:11:54] it was God providing it and when a
[1:11:56] minister stands up here recognizing that
[1:11:59] he doesn't have anything but all he can
[1:12:01] bring is his word god rides that word
[1:12:05] and speaks to his sheep speaks to his
[1:12:07] Lambs lets them know exactly what they
[1:12:10] have need of amen God hiding himself in
[1:12:15] Simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:12:18] same way praise God so I trust that you
[1:12:21] were blessed tonight that there was
[1:12:23] something that was spoken tonight in the
[1:12:25] simplest way God speaking lip to ear to
[1:12:27] certain individuals letting them know
[1:12:30] that God's aware of their situations God
[1:12:32] wants to deal with your lives wants to
[1:12:35] you know pull you out of the snares of
[1:12:37] the enemy the enemy is always trying to
[1:12:39] snare Sons and Daughters of God but
[1:12:42] God's letting you know that he's he's
