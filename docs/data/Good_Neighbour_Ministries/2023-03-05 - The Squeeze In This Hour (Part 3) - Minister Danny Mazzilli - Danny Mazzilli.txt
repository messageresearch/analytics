[Music] the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble and fell though and who shouldn't come around me my heart shall not fear the world should Rise Against Me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord now will I seek Arthur I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle Shahi set up upon a rock [Music] and now shall my head be lifted up about my enemies run about me therefore will I offer in the stabner sacrifice of Joy I'll sing yay I'll sing praises unto the Lord hear oh Lord when I cry with my voice have messed yourself on me and answer me when that said seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face law will I seek hide not thy face

called which means to crouch the crawl the Fawn at the masses feet prostrate oneself to do reverence or homage the word is always active it means more than just a feeling of the presence of God it means to be actively involved in and be inside the presence of God it is an action an offering of ourselves before God worship is personal on both sides it is an individual experience for each of us

I talked to the guy at the intake office and he says he gave me number 520. I look up at the board and it's 450 somethings like 70 people behind I sat down for about 45 minutes and then I called my wife I said listen I'm not sure if I'm gonna get these plates today it's crazy it's starting to snow outside but I know I said I can't even put these plates back on my car because they're rusting anyway I got up again and then this lady comes out and she said listen it's about now four o'clock five after four and she said listen I'm just kind of you guys letting you guys know that everybody's gonna get served today it's very very pressing for time we're going on to like three people at 4 15 and everything just looks so bleak and I I'll tell you something I was I was kind of shaken up a little bit I was like no how I'm gonna get this and then a voice said to me did you pray so I sat on my apartment I said Lord you know my situation Lord I need this place on my car I've been trying for a month not to get it before I was even done saying amen a voice I walk I started work no he didn't tell me what to do so I was working I just take two steps I know what I'm doing I'm looking for a number that's better than mine I have 5 20. so I saw a piece of paper it was up somebody's band I kept walking the doors right there there's a hard way to go I kept walking and then I saw a piece of paper I pick it it's a bank statement so I felt a little bit oh man I thought I had certain things they keep walking as I walk and I turn the hallway I look in the corner there's a piece of paper opening the numbers say 484.

morning after uh weeks vacation sister Jennifer and I had a wonderful rest by the grace of God in Cuba um it was really really tremendous we had a good good rest uh the beaches the the water they can't be compared to I've never seen anything like it the water was warm I love the ocean I was in the ocean every day I rejoiced in the ocean every day I felt like Liberty and and just kept going under the water coming back up going under the water I don't know what it is but I just love the ocean and especially when it's warm like that so uh we're very grateful for that that rest the Lord provided everything um from start to finish no complaints we're very grateful to the Lord for a wonderful wonderful vacation Pastor Simon sends his greetings he said he's on vacation and having a good rest by the grace of God and you'll be back this week and we look forward to seeing him amen praise God and so this morning we're here at a feast on the word of God are you here to Feast on God's word this morning amen praise God because that's that's what's burning on my heart amen nothing else when we come into the house of the Lord we come for one purpose to Rejoice with him around the throne and receive the word that he has for us how many have been enjoying the the services last week there with brother Tim preaching on the Awakening power of the seed of God God placed something in you that that has been awakened it's a lot different than what's going on in the world out there it's something that once once it's awakened in you you can never be the same you will never be the same amen praise God and then uh wonderful service on Wednesday night brother Desmond ministering on the sovereignty of God in tragedy and situations and it really uh you know brought some clarity to uh you know to trials and and situations that come into your life regardless of what they are God Will Make A Way God has a purpose in it God will use it for his glory amen because he's Sovereign amen praise God the Lord has some wonderful gifts in our midst and we're very grateful for them that uh you know that's the beauty of the five-fold ministry that's the Glorious victory that that the Lord made available to us um you know don't ever underestimate when somebody comes up in this day and in this hour and they have a revelation of who they are it changes everything amen praise God so let's go ahead and uh and start the service this morning before we do let's pray father we are so grateful this morning Lord once again we prostrate ourselves before you and we acknowledge you father as the supreme authority in this church and in our lives and we give you the preeminence this morning we allow ourselves to be set aside for service as hearers and has speakers this morning of your word Lord and we ask that your spirit your anointing the mighty Angel himself will come and vindicate your word your presence your will and your purpose for each and every one of our lives this ministry Lord we place all things into your hands this morning anoint your word have your way in Jesus name amen praise God and so we're going to continue we've been ministering on the squeeze for this hour and uh this morning we're going to look at part three um just things that uh that the lord has laid upon my heart and you know when you think about the squeeze you think about you know uh pressure you know coming down you know when when we think about it and when we talk about it sometimes oh when the squeeze comes down upon the bride she will do things and and experience Supernatural like never before well you can look at it that way or you can look at it and recognize that you're in the midst of it right now because of who you are and because you're a carrier of the word for this day and for this hour that's what the pressure is on and we're living in a time in a season where this pressure is is creeping in in such a way that it would be so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect if it were possible but we know that's not possible let's read the scripture Colossians 1 21 to 29. foreign that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if ye continue in the faith in the revelation grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church whereof I am made a Ministry repeat he repeats that I am made a minister Pastor Simon has made a minister brother Tim brother Chris brother Philip brother Desmond brother Kofi brother uh Corey ministers God has provided ministers in this hour amen whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you we need to recognize the hour that we're living in the word that is being provided the five-fold ministry that God has provided for us to minister the word to give us the kind of faith that we are going to need to receive and go in the rapture notice according to the dispensation of God that's been given unto me that's been given unto us ministers in this hour to bring the mind of God and the will of God and the only way we can do that is recognize the supernatural element of the ministry that it's God that ministers and speaks his word to you as an individual it's God that is calling not a group he's calling you you you every single one of you to the attention of your position in the word of God Amen even the mystery which hath being hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would would make known what is the richest of the glory of this ministry among the Gentiles which is Christ in you wow you know this word it just becomes more and more alive every time you you read it and and you come under the anointing of the Holy Spirit amen the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily may the Lord add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I trust this morning that the word is going to work mightily in each and every one of us and it's going to bring us to a place where we can recognize the hour that we're living in the dispensation the time how wonderful is this dispensation how wonderful is the work of God in each and every one of our Lives amen you know go to the uh to the next slide now I only added this slide this morning because you know I've been reading the supernatural book I took it with me book six when we went down south and and I'm probably three quarters of the way through it now and I was reading it and I was getting so blessed Saints I adjure you read those Supernatural books as often as you can they will bless you they will give you present Revelation things that God is doing even right now in the midst of his people amen because remember he's the same yesterday today and forever I got nothing new to bring you to you this morning there's nothing new okay if there's if there was anything that that I had to do then Christ going to the Cross would have been for none he did it all he provided it all and and especially in the day in the hour that we're living in right now and so this morning I was reading it and uh you know I came to the place where where uh uh the brother that wrote the book he came to the place where where brother Branham preached on Christ The Mystery of God revealed and I realized as I was reading it that it was the scripture that the Lord inspired me to use uh days ago for this message and it was the same scripture of Colossians and it struck me and I thought oh so then as I was reading through his you know as as I was reading it I came to this place here and and this is you know around a lot around the thought of where we're going and the hour that we're living in and what it is that's really taking place in this hour and so I took this quote and and brother Bram speaking here in the in the message he says not knowing of course being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this God knows it but if you turn and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock the end of the second pull the third pull is at hand see at at the name of Jesus bowing falling prostrate At His Feet King of Kings in heaven will crown him when our journey is complete precious name second pull has been made manifest hope of Earth and Joy Of Heaven he's singing Here precious name oh how sweet hope of Earth and Joy Of Heaven did you notice the spirit take the song the same song and picking it up an octave higher like that that next pull is at hand amen uh-huh take the name of Jesus with you it's later than you think and that really struck me and I you know the spirit of God you know has been just blessing my heart with you know with the the the present stage of the ministry of the Bride of Jesus Christ and how that Ministry came about and how powerful that Ministry is and it's all under the opening of the word and everything that took place in 1963 when the spirit of God the mighty Angel himself came down to say that time shall be no more and that now there would be a message there would be a dispensational change that would take place that would come to the anointed Sons and Daughters of God in order to receive the word that they would need to overcome in this day and in this hour when Christ came down in 1963 we came down because the attributes of God were in him amen and he was expressing them and he was now coming to redeem them he was coming to call them amen praise God and so next verse uh Slide the God of this evil age now the little humble little bride of Christ just simply believes the word whoever she is it's individuals it's not God calling churches that party's over I mean we can get into all kinds you know we know that that brother Branham came here in 1963 those seals were open 1964 he preached the indictment of of of of the churches that there would be no more possibility that churches could actually repent it's God's individual Sons and Daughters of God that he's calling now it's no more to the churches it's God calling individuals out of the churches in leadership he says God's calling individuals I stand at the door and knock if any if any man any person one individual out of a thousand it could be one out of a million wow God is calling you amen God is speaking to you God wants you to recognize the time the season now here brother Branham was was living in in such a time when he reached the Pinnacle of his ministry where where he said in in the seventh seal I like to add this that of all the services I've ever had in my life I believe this week has been the most glorious time of my life in services no matter what I have I've seen great Miracles performed of course before in healing services but this is beyond that it's been one of the greatest time highlights of my life is is to be here and seeing this little Tabernacle take on the different look not only that but the inside has taken on a different look everything changed from that moment on and I want you to know that at that time in that moment a squeeze Came Upon Our prophet and pressure Came Upon him over the next few months over the next several months he was actually contemplating to quit and actually become a mountaineer just take his family and go into the mountains because he got so depressed because all the doors started to shut when the word was made manifest you see the word came on the scene and the word never changes Jesus Christ imagine God himself walking on the Earth and they rejected him they called him Beelzebub when the moment that he started to speak the word and he started to reveal the word because remember it's all about the word it's all about him bringing us back and there's only one way that we can come back and that's by the unadulterated word of God but we're living in a Time of great deception we're living in a time where the world in the same way that the world and that in the same way that we are Awakening in the same way that we're Awakening to Who We Are there's another Great Awakening taking place in the world let's look at the next slide there's a Rapture Awakening versus an astrological Awakening we're in right now in the age of Pisces the age of Pisces is now moving from the age of Pisces into the age of Aquarius we're in a transitional stage right now we're probably already in the age of Aquarius it's known that we're that likely because of the circumstances around it now the Lord led me to these things and I was wondering you know like because this Awakening is real to us but it's just as real to those that have not received this word they're being affected by the atmospheres of the spirit of God and the anointing because remember the white horse rider that that first seal that first right white horse rider that went out it was a writer of deception it it continued to ride through every one of those dispensations and it's writing today it still rides in this day and in this hour and it's purpose and its desire is to get you to disbelieve the word of God it's always been the purpose the enemy wants to do one thing gets you off the word he hates the fact that you can receive Revelation and he can't he can't stand that and so he fights up because he can't understand it he he it boggles his mind but he can never receive Revelation because he is not from God he was created and so anything that is created has a beginning and will have an end anything that is an attribute of God that comes from the mind of God had no beginning and can have no end and therefore Revelation is reserved only for Eternal attributes of God they can only be received by Eternal attributes of God and we need to recognize how significant that is because it's what differentiates the rapture from The New Age movement and the transition and the the Transcendence the journey into Collective Transcendence that they are experiencing which is becoming very powerful in this day and in this hour we need to be aware of that I believe that's why the Lord just led me into this let's go to the next slide it talks about the age of Pisces now I got this information in research over the internet and I thought yeah this makes sense to me and so here the age of Pisces has shaped human history for around 2 000 years and is slowly Con coming to an end as the age of Aquarius takes its turn there is no firm consensus among astrologers as to when the age of Pisces began and even less to when it ends exactly but what is certain is that the transition between these true these two astrological ages has already started and one of its biggest aspects is the battle between science and religion that has marked the development of Human Society for the past centuries the age of Pisces defines the time where human beings engaged more than ever in the matters of the Soul the ideas of human transcendence disillusion of the self and connection to a higher ideal Consolidated in the collective Consciousness and took shape in various forms the birth of Jesus Christ the founding of the church and the establishment of one fundamental religion were a few great marks of this time which influence human life until today did not Jesus say when he was on the earth I'm going to make you Fishers of Men the dispensation of Pisces did did not you know if you start to really pay attention you will see the fish symbol the fish symbol is the fish symbol for Christianity it's you know the pope has has a fish right on his head looks just like a fish with his mouth open you see all these things that that that we you know sometimes we don't realize it but it's happening it's a it's going on around us it's it's taking place and so we know that we've gone through a a huge Spiritual Awakening if there was ever a time where I mean God sent us a 20th century prophet in this day and in this hour for the purpose of opening our eyes to the revelation of who we were as Sons and Daughters of God we need to recognize just how powerful this dispensation was but we're now transitioning into Aquarius next slide the age of Aquarius symbolizes the time of Discovery Innovation and progress it represents the thirst for Change and the longing for a better future ruler of the collective Aquarius speaks of humanitarian ideals cooperation and Brotherhood it also rules the Realms of the personal and Collective mind the searching and sharing of information and the flight and the fight for personal and intellectual freedom have we not been experiencing that especially you know just you know probably started really strong in the days of Martin of Martin Luther King you know when when uh you know there was a a great movement you know I mean we know that there's been a lot of it in seed form that started with you know with the blacks and slavery and everything else but you know it just has been evolving in people wanting to be identified wanting to be identified and and recognized as individuals and that that they have a place and and and so forth and and so this has you know been been you know a fight for personal intellectual Freedom at the same time science has been developing in a faster rate each year I mean look at technology look at where we're at where are we going to be I believe it was Nikola Tesla said that that you know as science continues um to uh enter and and look into the the the metaphysical you know the the Beyond uh science into the into the metaphysical Realms that they'll be able to achieve in 10 years more than they've achieved in decades and hundreds of years why because Daniel said knowledge would increase in this day it's the hour for these things to happen and we need to recognize and so at the same time science has been developing a faster rate each year and has already completely changed societal structures technological advancement permitted the invention of machines internet opened a full range of new possibilities for social connections social media completely changed the way human beings interact and globalization may be one of the greatest marks of this age how else is the whole world going to know about Jesus Christ moreover Collective thinking and technological advancements are contributing to the fight against social and economic inequality and the fight for expression and freedom of identity has opened the door for more diversity and acceptance now today we've got he she them neutral gender you can call yourself a toothpick if you want it's opened up to absolutely a place where there's just no sense anymore the word of God has been just completely put aside it was Adam and Eve god listen in God like we can I've had Communications with with people about this topic and I tell them yes God in his Elohim position in the beginning Elohim the self-existent one there was male and female in God absolutely but you need to come to the to the understanding of the age the time the season and the planet that you're on I don't doubt that there was thousands of Worlds the Bible says that the worlds didn't say world it said worlds were framed by the word of God there may have been a thousand other existences and human civilizations before ours it's very possible and most likely was because God is eternal there's no time or space in God we only speak in time or space but the moment you break out of this Dimension you're in an eternal Circle where all things are now that's why you hear about people that have these you know uh near-death experiences and they enter into death for a moment and they say that their whole life flashes before their eyes well of course because the moment you step into that Dimension it's Eternal you'll be able to see past future what happened yesterday what happened a year 10 000 years ago because it's in the mind of God there's nothing impossible that's why when we receive these Revelations from the Lord Saints this is this is only the beginning what is going to take us out of this Dimension it's going to be the Revelation it's going to be God's mind being revealed to you more and more about why you were here where you are going where you came from and where you're headed everything that that all those questions in your mind but we are so human in these vessels of clay we get so discouraged we get so beat up sometimes we get so down on ourselves you know it's a paradox Saints once in a while you're going to sit there like I do and one minute you're you're you're you're down and you're out and you're thinking about your future you're thinking about your pension you're thinking about your retirement you're thinking about your health you're you know you're you got all these things hitting you from this side and this in the next second you're in this dimension of Eternal attribute that cannot disbelieve the word of God and God said you're Justified you're you're glorified you everything that you are you already were Glory I mean that blows my mind when that when that thought comes and and it just becomes a reality it just changes everything it's it sets you free it liberates you in such a way that you know that that yeah you know you it actually gives you the strength if you receive that in the right way you get overcoming power because that's the revelation God gives us he gives us Faith to overcome not to get discouraged and look at all of our all the issues and get to a point where we want to commit suicide that's a demon from the pits of hell and that suicide demon is so strong these days it's one of the biggest uh takers of of the young people's lives in North America right now because they can't fathom they can't get their mind around the pressure of this life and so they want to give up but we're not give upers we are Overcomers [Applause] all that all that you need all that all that God requires is for you to believe his word and faith will come to you I was saying the last you know the last time I ministered that you know Faith needs to come to the youngest of our children in order for them to overcome this age we as the parents all we can do is teach them and show them and read the word of God to them bring them into the house of the Lord teach him about the word of God but it's the spirit of God that gives them faith and when that faith comes in it's not something that they need to interpret it interprets itself you don't need to tell me or Pastor Simon or the deacons if you've got faith we see it because it's going to manifest in your walk it's going to manifest in your talk it's going to manifest in your in your life in your experiences because faith is is a substance it's something real Hallelujah let's go to the next okay the last uh uh paragraph but the fight for Freedom also pays a price On the Dark Side of Aquarian age lies disorder Rebellion breaking of rules skepticism and the change above everything mentality the current growth of progressive thinking has created a counter current of conservatism discrimination religious Fanatics and the obsession with technological advancements has also brought negative consequences to the world we live in now that's the truth my God if there's ever been a time of rebellion and disorder and and the things that we've been seeing people like Canada is a divided nation right now we saw it happening in the U.S when you know when the election took place there with Trump and and Biden and we saw a country that was completely divided well that's all part of this age that's all part of the deception it's all part of the plan of the God of this evil age to bring the world into Absolute Total uh chaos it's going to lead into the Great Tribulation that this world is going to be going into there's nothing that we can do to stop that the conditions of the world the conditions of Politics the conditions of the people the mindset of the people the Revelation that's that's being bombarded upon the people Satan's Revelation Satan's teachings New Age teachings on on you know that you you can be God that you are God I am I hear people saying I am God I know they got no revelation because of where they're coming from but if you say I am an attribute of God and I have a revelation of what God is doing in this day that's a totally different statement two different worlds you see because the minute you take Jesus Christ out of the equation everything falls apart it can only lead to destruction it's not going to lead to a rapture it's not going to lead to a millennial Reign where you will reign as part of God's economy listen this Plan of Redemption is what we are dealing with this is Who We Are the Bible was given for that purpose it's the game plan it's the instruction it's the doors that open other doors and in 1963 a door was opened let's let's move on because I don't want to get ahead of myself so in final words the Rapture dispensational change versus the astrological transition in final words the transition of the age of Pisces to the age of Aquarius represents the battle between two different systems progress versus tradition mind versus soul or God versus machine but it also represents the possibility for joining the spiritual to the collective a time in which the longing for Transcendence and divine connection surpasses the barriers of identity race color and social status to the place where all Humanity May reach the Eternal Universal collection it sounds great and there's a lot of Truth in that if you bring it into the context of who we are as Sons and Daughters of God as those that have that that have received the the the the word for our day that have received the instruction that God listen God has provided instruction just in the same way that he did with the children of Israel people believe the Bible there's so many different Christian denominations out there they're preaching from the same Bible every Sunday they believe the word but yet they're not willing to accept what God did that he's the same yesterday today and forever and that God deals with people in the same way when God was going to liberate the children of Israel out of Egypt God decided to send a Moses right he sent a messenger to liberate the children so God has a provided way of doing all things and we need to recognize that and come under it and come under that leadership come under that instruction recognize what God is doing in this day don't get caught up with going you know into science and and transcending into these areas because look Transcendence meaning in the dictionary is existence or experience beyond the normal or physical level they're trying to break into dimensional change they're talking about it if you talk to the New Age movement people that are that are that are in it and I'm not against them I I know many of them and I love them I'm not against them I'm talking about the missing link that would that would take all their thinking and bring it so perfect perfectly together if they could recognize the key element of Jesus Christ and all that was was that Jesus was God Source they call it Elohim the universe the self-existent one they've got so many names energy call it what you want we know it as Elohim God the self-existent one the Eternal God the Creator he's Eternal having no beginning and no end we're talking about the same thing here but yet you're missing the formula you're missing the game plan you're missing why Jesus Christ had to come to the Earth your your own birth certificate Bears record that he came when you look at your driver's license they ask you when were you born I was born 1961 years after Christ I don't care who you are that alone is going to be a testimony against you if you don't accept it but you need to recognize God's provided way let's move on now just to confirm you know we're talking about the astrological uh uh process and understanding astronomy you know that uh an astronomer came to brother Branham one day and I'm just going to read this and I just you know when I when I got that information I thought you know I'm just going to throw this in the Lord just led me to bring this in and and so I'm just going to read so the now the astronomer she was a psychic she's talking to brother Branham you can go back and read it how the angel came to me and his commission okay but he says she said maybe I better explain myself she said I am an astrologist and now I'm also bringing this for another reason the Holy Spirit showed me he says you need to let the people know the importance of William Miriam Branham his ministry was not something that was just another religious evangelist he's a huge Link in all of this and we're going to be looking at that and how important it is to recognize his ministry his dispensation and why God did what he did through him why the voice of God spoke through William Branham she said I'm an astrologer I said I thought you was something like that she said I'm on my way to Chicago to see my boy who's a Baptist Minister I said yes ma'am she said anybody ever tell you you were born under a sign I said no no ma'am I lied to her there a lot of people say the prophet never lied never said anything you listen only to the tapes you only listen to the tapes you say exactly what he said forget about you getting your own revelation no sir I got my own revelation but I'll say Amen to the prophet of God every time he said anybody ever know ma'am I lied to her see and I said just wanted to see what she was going to say and she said I said no ma'am and she said doesn't hasn't ministers ever told you I said I don't have nothing to do with ministers and she said uh-huh and I said she she said to me I said well she said if I tell you just exactly when you were born will you believe me I said no ma'am [Laughter] he was just a man of like passion no ma'am and uh um and she said well I can tell you when you were born I said I don't believe it and she said you were born on April the 6th 1909 at five o'clock in the morning now God can do anything he wants God can reveal in any way that he wants and he was making it very clear that another gift was coming to the Earth in the 20th century that would change religion and Christianity forever and I said that's right I said how do you know that well God knew it let's look to the next scripture Revelations 10. verses 1 to 7. you've still got about 45 minutes here and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet as pillars of Fire and he had in his right hand a little book open the book was open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and right them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets we have read this scripture many many times we know what it represents but even more so as as we approach that final stage of our ministry because I want you to know that you have a Ministry I want you to know that when the mighty angel came down in 1963 it was Christ himself coming down to possess and redeem every attribute son and daughter of God to bring them back into their position as miniature gods as little Messiahs now I say that in a humble way I don't say that in a way to say that oh we are Gods because then I'd be putting myself in the same category as as you know this New Age movement no God is God but God had attributes God expressed himself like he did in the Garden of Eden when he expressed Adam in His image Adam was in the image of God and God took from Adam the female aspect that's why from the womb of man he took one man and created the woman he took the female aspect of himself so that he could have Fellowship and we need to understand that as an attribute of God we are a portion we are a thought that has been expressed from God into this dimension because remember we got to deal with this dimension let's not get carried away you know you talk to people they want to talk about a hundred thousand years ago and about the you know the the different races and you can go into caves and you can see their writings on the caves and they're proven to be thousands of years old and all this that's great but that's not what we're dealing with we're dealing with a war right now in the Ukraine that could eventually turn into World War III and the world is in the condition that it's in because the scripture said it would be in that condition and so we need to realize as attributes of God now we are Awakening to Who We Are the position of who we are as Sons and Daughters of God listen to brother Branham next slide in 1963 the first seal and then there's coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all that's right I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because what we got right now we won't be able to do it you know you could take that statement right there and I'm telling you that you know well let's read on there's something we've got to step farther we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this Earth and will find that after a while the Lord willing find where it's written and so you're going to need I'm gonna need we're all under the expected we need to be under the right expectation of what it is that we need in order to take the rapture because remember even that new age teaching is telling us that the world in the age of Aquarius is going into total chaos there's going to be more war there's going to be destruction like never before but there's going to transcend a people out of that chaos that are going to not be part of that and so they look at it and I've talked to them they look at death in the same way sometimes like they welcome it they go I'm just going to go into that other dimension I'm looking forward to it s Earth is no good anymore look at there's nothing I can't I can't do anything of Great Value here on this Earth it's all political control and it's true it is all political control we talked about it's everything that they talk about is in the scripture that's where it started they're looking at the astrology which is also God's Bible by the way you can look at the 12 planets or the the the the 12 months of the year and then Jesus Christ as the son and those planets revolving around the Sun it's all there that Bible that they're talking about and they call it astrology it's all in the word of God Jesus Christ is the focal point of it all but they fail to recognize that they will not oh Jesus reached the State of Consciousness that we should all try and reach a state of I agree but they're leaving out everything that leads them to that condition and that's why it's so important to recognize the word for our day because in that word is contained the perfect Faith the rapturing faith rapturing Revelation the the mind of God what it's going to take if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it dwells in you it'll speed up your molecules it'll Quicken your mortal body you talk to the new agers they talk about yes it's a frequency if we can speed up to the frequency of the next Dimension it'll put us into that Dimension exactly right Hallelujah amen they're missing the quickening power which is the Holy Ghost you're going to need the quickening power in order to make that dimensional change and the moment you do not accept that he went to the Cross I'm going to make it as simple as possible even for the youngest person in here Jesus died and went to the Cross so that he could give up the Holy Ghost which is the quickening power so that it could come out of him and go into a multiplied form into each and every son and daughter of God so that they could be quickened from this Dimension to the other dimension and miss the Great Tribulation that's going to come upon the Earth that's why when when you when when you came to the Lord and you you had that experience of of meeting God the first thing I want the Holy Ghost I want the spirit of God in Me because that is the key that is the formula that is the only thing that's going to take us out of here next slide in the third poll he says now that's the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere no no the bride hasn't had a Revival yet now you got to remember I'm reading from the third seal in 1963 when the seals were being opened by this Mighty Angel himself to reveal what was coming down the road okay we need to understand where we were and where we're at and so he's saying here there was no Revival for the bride yet why because it was going to start right then and there on the opening of that seventh seal it was going to change absolutely everything and the whole Christian world was going to dispensationally change from allele to seeing time dimension into an eternal age led by an eternal messenger Jesus Christ The Mighty Angel himself and there is absolute scientific evidence that he actually came to the Earth there's a cloud right here look into the cloud Google search it mysterious Cloud 1963 sunset Mountain Arizona you will see that it was caught by many scientists and to this day they still can't explain it we can we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again see yeah he'll send it he promised it now watch and now watch look at where you are today here we are over 60 what 59 57 years after brother Branham uh ministered and the mighty Angel spoke on the opening of these seals and here we are and look at the dispensation that we're in look at the conditions of the world tell me that the prophet did not already tell us that this condition and these things were going to happen he told us already we knew that these things were coming it's the very evidence that we're actually going into that Transcendent stage of the Rapture that we are going to be quickened out of this Dimension but it requires a supernatural faith in order for that to happen next slide and just then from the seventh seal he picked me up he took me up and sent me way up high to where a meeting was going on look like a tent or a cathedral or some sort and I looked and there was a little box like little place over in the side and I seen that light was talking to somebody above me that light that you see there on the picture it Whirled away from me like that and went over that tent and said I'll meet you there now this is an in a vision that brother Branham was happening having and and the voice told them out the pillar fired I'll meet you there and a lot of people are still waiting for a tent Vision to be fulfilled they're looking for brother Branham some people are actually looking for brother Branham to raise up again and set up a tent and and where there'll be meetings again and people will go in and actually be discerned you know for situations in their lives and and and and there's going to be something that's going to happen in that form that's not what it is listen I'll meet you there and said this this will be the third pull this is so important for us to understand to realize that after 1963 and brother branham's dispensational change went from Brother Branham to the mighty angel I had the decrease he said so that he could increase Elijah okay there came a change and when that seventh seal was opened it released the seven Thunders it released the opening of the word and those unknown Thunders it's not something that we can explain that's why it's so important to go and listen to the seals read the Seven Seals again listen to The Seven Seals again tell people about the Seven Seals let them know uh that you know a lot of people they say oh you know what when we read the book of Revelation it's just so hard to understand it just say read the Seven Seals by William Miriam Branham there's information in there that can supernaturally Enlighten you but we also know that it's only if he wants to Enlighten them a lot of people say oh so what you're making yourself something no I'm not why did Jesus walk on the Earth walk down a street there was thousands of people hundreds of people they were all all kinds of them touching him because they knew he was a Healer and one woman touched His Garment and he stopped and he says somebody touch me you you tell me why if you can tell me why he did that I can tell you why he opens the eyes and he shuts the eyes he opens the ears and he shuts the ears it's the scripture I can't tell you why he does it I can only tell you what the scripture said but she had some sort of a representation just like the woman at the well when Jesus said I have need to go to Samaria tonight what for I got a need to go because there was a prostitute who happened to have an attribute of God in her she had representation from before the foundations of this world we need to recognize that it's not all starts right here it doesn't start right here your human life started here as a little baby but the attribute of God the soul the seed of God that came into you by predestination just by the grace of God that's why it says by grace are you saved because you can talk to a hundred people and out of those hundred people uh 90 of them will just walk away but ten will say Amen what is that it's because of Grace I didn't do this I didn't do anything to deserve you didn't do anything to deserve this but God elected God could see now it's not I'm going to choose him I'm not going to choose her I'm going to choose him I'm going to no God placed all of us on free moral agency but he knew that when the time would come that the word his plan his game plan would come and he would give the instruction through his fiery ministers because God uses man to minister his word God is using man right now God is not using tapes God is using man but the man that was in the tapes is still God's prophet and he had his time his season on the earth he fulfilled his purpose and God took him to his reward we'll see him again but now we've got a work to do and God is doing that work through man through us through ministers like Paul said this dispensation which has been given unto me I can't help the ministry that God gave me you can help the ministry that God gave you it's what God gave you to fulfill as a Son of God or a daughter of God in this time you can't change it nobody can change it and because you do it by Revelation and that's why Jesus himself said to Peter he says uh who do you say that I am because remember God walked on the earth he was amongst all the people and everybody was saying oh he's beelze above this one was saying he's the Messiah the other one was saying he's a Healer the other one was saying oh he can discern people's thoughts oh he can raise the Dead he turned to Peter he says Peter who do you say that I am he said Thou Art the Christ the anointed word for this day the prophecy of as I of Isaiah you are that prophecy that would come riding in on the fall on the ass of a mule that you would come riding into Jerusalem you are the Fulfillment of the word of God for our day now I kind of exaggerated a little bit but he recognized that he was the word and Jesus looked to him and says Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you Peter you didn't get this from mama or Papa or your priest you got this he says from the father the father is his spirit the father and the Holy Ghost are the same and Jesus Christ was a vessel that God created so that he could dwell in it that's it it's one God and he says flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven he hath revealed this unto you and then he adds and he says and I'm going to build a church see he had a plan I'm going to have a people in the last days and that's going to be built upon that Divine inspired Revelation faith that comes directly from the mind of God to you as an individual you as an individual you as an individual in perfect Faith where you can see yourself in the word of God now you can see the time that you're living in the season that you are in and recognize that you are a part of that word and that God is going to that you're going in the rapture you can't help it you're just a part of the word and the word is going to leave the Earth and this world is going to go into chaos the only thing that's keeping this world together right now is the fact that the word which framed the world is still here in a calling dispensation right now just to bring the last few in but we need to recognize what draws the last few the third pull it's not your ability to put this message together and and quote a million quotes and and you could know the Bible better than any minister in here but without revelation it means nothing the Bible says the letter killeth but the spirit gives it life and if you've been awakened by the life of Jesus Christ which only comes through the message of this hour God's provided way God is not the author of confusion he's the same yesterday today and forever if you want to know what he's going to do today just look at what he did yesterday that's why we say we as ministers we've got nothing new to bring we're bringing you the quotes we're bringing you the word of God we're we're bringing it to you the way the Lord inspires us to bring it by experience but it takes a supernatural element between you and God for you to receive it so that you can actually live it and overcome this dimension the seventh seal and just so he says that uh this is the third pull and there's three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it's an unknown language those seven Thunders it's an unknown language it's not something that we can interpret but it's supernatural it's it's it's calling your name right now as I'm ministering this word those Thunders are actually uttering through the word of God it rides the word and it allows you to recognize you you're placing your calling you're saying Amen to this you're putting it all together it's all making perfect sense that God had to send a prophet God had to correct all of the teachings do you know listen go back and read the seals do you know that it changed Christianity's interpretation on the Book of Revelation completely that where they thought that that first white horse rider was Christ going out to conquer the churches it was Satan going out to conquer the laity and and and then the second horse rider the red horse rider then the black horse rider and the pale horse rider that writer is still writing today if it wasn't for God sending a prophet to this 20th century in order to bring this message and the opening of the word to reveal the Mysteries like we just read there in Revelation 10 in the days of The Voice a lot of people they only want to hear Brother Branham they're listening and hearing brother Branham but they're failing to recognize that it is the voice of God that came through brother Branham that is what is the same yesterday today and forever and what you're trying to tell me that that voice now cannot go into individual sons and and Daughters of God and continue this calling of the Bride of Jesus Christ this calling of the Sons and Daughters of God it's doing it that's what called you and me some of you were in churches before and you were brought up in churches and you were taught the the the teachings of the church and the doctrines and the Creeds and the teachings of man and you heard a lot about the word of God you heard a lot about Jesus Christ but when God gave you one revelation of this message in the same way that when brother Branham said in 1963 that if the angel of the Lord had not come into that room I would have I would have been teaching something wrong to the people but God would not allow it because this was the time where where truth had to be brought in order to call the Sons and Daughters of God the attributes of God could never accept a lie they could never you could you just couldn't pinpoint it you'd be going to the church but he just just couldn't get into it now you were looking forward to the party on Friday night you didn't care about being a church you were there because your mom and dad said you got to go to church and they won't even go but when the spirit of God caught you and awakened you and this is the time in the season right now where we are under the third pull Ministry of the word where it's Christ himself it's under it's based on the opening of that seventh seal that is calling Sons and Daughters of God into their position so that they can take the rapture the whole purpose of the opening of those seals was to preach rapturing Faith so that the bride could be taken from this Dimension to go to a three and a half year honeymoon in a in another dimension and this world goes into three and a half years of total chaos then we come back but right now we're looking for that last one and let me remind you of something every single son and daughter of God was already known from before the the foundations of the world so don't you be trying to convince somebody no nobody had to convince me Gabriel would call me every couple of weeks three I'll be driving by over there I'm going to church tonight you want to come no all he did was he pestered me so much that I said okay I'm Gonna Come and he picked me up at Tim Hortons on them on on Mississauga Road in the QEW he pulled up in this van and he had he had all the United Nations in there and I thought what in the world am I getting into here I thought what is going on here and I went with him I got into the car and we went to the church and all I can tell you is when the word spoke and don't I cannot tell you I cannot explain to you and you will know what I'm talking about if you've received this that when God awakens you and you you you just something changes inside of you you can't put an interpretation on it but it was the spirit of God Awakening me from my amnesia it was God waking us up from our Amnesia that when we came to this earth and we got locked into these bodies we went into a a human Amnesia and and our spiritual position or where we came from who we really are why we're here on Earth it was not known it needed to be awakened in US and when that happens everything starts to change now you're being taught by the Holy Spirit In You it always was there it was just the time in the season for your calling some of us had to go through drug addiction some of us had to go through uh marital situations some of us had to go through serious health issues some of us go through nothing and then God just awakens you it's up to God it's his time and it's his season but it's a supernatural thing but he says here he says but I stand right there and looked right straight at it and this is the third pull coming he knocks on the pulpit three times and the Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the reason all heaven was silent if you look at the seventh seal and you read it in Revelations chapter 8 verse 1 you will see that the lamb left and there was absolute silence that's why he's here now that's what we're experiencing now that half hour of Silence I don't want to make it anything more than what it is Christ has come down Christ has come down he is the Capstone he has come down to reveal and make known unto his own who they are why they were here and now why we're bringing you home I'm bringing you home he's here to Quicken you by the word of God through the preaching of the word to recognize who you are and why you have come next slide Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man this from the token message and by the way the token message brother Bram said that that that became his very Pinnacle that became like uh the message that the Holy Spirit placed upon him and he you you look after the after he opened those after the Lord opened those Seven Seals brother Branham preached on the token many many times and he was he was saying you need the token you need the token what was he talking about he's talking about the Holy Ghost the quickening power of the word of God that's going to take you out of this Dimension because he realized now that it was going home time and he says here the message would not be till now the world wasn't in the condition until now this is the hour that Jesus could appear at any time the sleeping virgin coming in trying to buy oil that time when the bride went in and the rest of them was left there did you ever think what happened they were right ahead preaching they went right ahead preaching and thinking they were getting Soul saved and everything and did not know it they knew nothing about it the church will go on thinking souls are being saved and everything else and the church is already the brides sealed away they don't know it certainly that's exactly what the scripture said Noah went into the ark and God sealed it out truly and the time will come when men and women will cry to God and even think that they've got something when they haven't got anything and so this is a sovereign hour Saints it really is a sovereign hour it's it's it's a time where you know to miss what God has done in this day and in this hour means that anybody outside of Christ not outside of this church I'm not saying this church I'm not saying anybody outside of Christ will remain here on the Earth for the continuation of what is prophesied for this Earth and it's not going to be good it's not total Annihilation by the way but it's going to be pretty close to as bad as it can get but the only and you know people say oh you preach and Escape religion you you know you're preaching it to out of fear to scare the people I'm not preaching anything out of fear you need to make your own decisions on your own salvation your own future your this is not between me and you this is between you and God you and the source you and Elohim you and whatever you want to call it but you're going to need at some point to recognize that there is an absolute next slide like he give Egypt he give Egypt a place to repent what was that last plague was death anything outside of the blood of Jesus Christ when you reject Christ dying on the cross which is the formula Christ plus Calvary equals the Holy Ghost the spirit of God coming back on you to reject Christ going to the cross eliminates your ability to receive the quickening power now I'm not saying you're going to get it you're not going to get it if you're going to get it it was already in the mind of God because he could look down and he he knew that when the word was going to come to you you were either going to say uh I'm going to take the new age teaching that makes more sense to me fine and I tell them I say listen God bless you I tell him what I have to tell them and that's it after that they need to carry on and move on with their own decision and and that decision is their responsibility I'm not responsible for them and neither are you that's why this is not about getting out there and and slamming the Bible and slamming the messages in front of the people and condemning the people and saying you're living like a devil and this and that nah nah that's not what it is get them to Christ get them to this message they need to hear what God has done and what God is doing in this hour in order for them to trans to be translated into that other dimension and so the last plague that hit the Pentecostal Church its spiritual death and the last plague that now is hitting this world is spiritual death outside of Jesus Christ it's just as simple as that and to reject Christ is death and all death is is separation from God and so you do not go to a glorious Victory you go to whatever it is that God has for the world in the tribulation and the dimensions Beyond this and he says it's spiritual death she's dead that's in the name of the Lord she's spiritually dead he gave her place to repent and she rejected it now she's dead she'll never rise again and so as we wind down here the next slide Saints this is the greatest message that the world has ever received and it's taking place right now I want to I want to just highlight some of these things the Lord just I wrote these things the opening of the seventh seal is the literal coming of the Lord and that is why there is silence in heaven right now these are just straight facts right out of the word of God there's a lot of Christian teaching out there I challenge them to go and read the Seven Seals by William Miriam Branham and and and and take your Bible and put it together and see if there's something that isn't supernaturally revealed to you he came to call you personally brother Branham did not open the seals it was the mighty Angel himself that opened the seals we hear his voice we hear the voice of God you're not listen whatever struck your soul this morning it's not Danny's Voice if something struck you and opened your understanding or or quickened something to you that's opened your eyes of understanding is because he spoke to you he opened the understanding in your heart the lamb had the book in his hand and it was the only and he was the only one who could open the seals so it wasn't a man that opened the seals he was the bleeding bloody lamb everything was done from before the foundations of the world and when he opened that book and he opened those seals it was to reveal your name it was to call you out of this dispensation right now the Lamb's Book of Life has your name in it once you hear your name called you can never be the same and you can never be lost Hallelujah glory to God Amen we bypass the Great Tribulation next slide brother

got to come Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to a Living Word of a living God to rise in the sun look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the Seven Seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of God see the quickening power of God foretold this would take place the quickening power of God made the worlds testify to it it's the truth the angel of the Lord I told you was around in a pillar of fire quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was and we knew just look this way and it's our Lord up there you see he is the one who opened those seals he's those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ and every and and the Very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there Supreme judge showing that he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us it's going to take the quickening power to put us in the Rapture amen God hiding himself in Simplicity and we're gonna close out here right now just another couple minutes see that's the way we want the Bible just the way the Bible says it that's the way we want it just like that don't put your own no interpretation to it it's already interpreted now who has no you got to go back and listen to the seals and brother Branham opened up the services on God hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same God was going to be doing a mighty mighty thing right there in 1963 in the opening of these Seven Seals and look and look at the scripture that he takes now who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed let me read it again now closely who has believed our report question and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed in other words if you have believed our report then the arm of the Lord has been revealed if you can accept this message if you can accept that God sent a prophet that God has turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers it's because God has extended his grace to you God has given you the ability to recognize his word for your day and to be included in this in this wonderful glorious message that he's given to us in other words you have believed our report then the arm of the Lords now I want to read also in the book of Saint Matthew gospel the 11th chapter of Saint Matthew and now you bring your papers and things because constantly if you don't have a recorder you you bring your paper so you can get it he's white like he's letting them know like hey something's Great Is Happening Here he says now he says uh um uh the 11th chapter of Saint Matthew the 25th and 26th verses 11 26 and 12. I'll write Jesus speaking in prayer I want to begin a little bit behind that let's make it 25th and 26th verse I believe that's where I announced though for I had it marked here in my Bible at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seems good in thy sight catch those two scriptures who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed even then Jesus thanked God that he hid the Mysteries that were under those seals he hid them from the wise and the Jesus came to the earth and the Pharisees the Sadducees nobody could recognize that it was Messiah it was hit they were blinded for our sake and now this world is going into blindness to the Gentiles for the sake of the hundred and forty four thousand that God is going to call out of the Jewish Nation there's just so much Hallelujah he hid it from the wise and The Prudent would reveal it to babes such as would learn for it seemed good to do that Look Away to Jesus and if Christ lives in me the works of Christ you'll do it's got to be and what is it what is Christ the word he said if ye abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will it'll be done because the word is there just needs the light and the light makes it live so now I am going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along and that is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long for so many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pull has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there'll never be an impersonation of that this is not something that we can impersonate your Christian walk you cannot impersonate it you'll you'll be exposed like that this is the hour where Christ comes in and dwells in you and experiences through you and lives through you right at this time now it just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power Saints we are we are progressing into the squeeze in a in a different format where this world and the Council of churches and and there's going to be a deal that's going to come together with the Pope and with the with the with the Catholic church and and Wall Street and there's going to be things that are going to happen we're now moving into those things as we speak and Saints this is our time we have no message of Our Own we need to share that the Lord is revealed what the Lord is revealing to us today and the spirit of the Lord will reveal it to his own stay with the message that God has given you tell them of the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals tell them that God sent a prophet remember the Lord gives Revelation to awaken individuals you don't give revelation and in conclusion brother Branham left and I I just these things just came to me this week and I just I you know I was talking to Sister Jen and we were there you know because we just sit at the beach under a nice Cabana and we would just Ponder and you know I would say so you know I said brother Branham left in 1965. the Azusa Street Revival started in 1906 and we look at when brother Branham left the earth and the mighty Angel Ministry started into its fullness we have 59 years and if we add 59 years to 1965 when the prophet left we end up in around 2024. if Elijah Ministry Elijah and then the Elijah Ministry Came Upon Us to ride this Trail again thou must prophesy again this is Revelations 10 8 verses uh 10 verses 8 to 11 10 7 8 to 11. that we've got a Ministry and something is going to culminate at some point and when we look at the church ages we see that the last Church age the laodicean church age started in 1906 and it's supposed to be the shortest Church age when we add the shortest Church age the Ephesian Church age which lasted 117 years to 1906 we're right around 2023. I'm not putting a time or anything listen no man knows the time that's the beauty of what's going on here but how close are we Saints let the musicians come what a Time what a Time thank you I'm sorry I went a little over but I wanted to get this all done [Applause] there's something in you there's a pull inside of you see that's why brother Branham when the angel of the Lord told him how to fish he told them don't pull too hard on that third pull be careful you got to be wise you got to wait because we're looking for the rainbow trout we're looking for those that are that are the sons and daughters of God they're not going to be caught by the Small Things sure we got healings sure we've got prayer lines sure we've got Supernatural uh healings going on and so forth but the greater than all of that is when you can accept the word for your day which gives you the quickening power to be translated out of this Dimension into that Redemption uh Dimension the the red the the dimension of the redeemed that's what we're looking for and so we need to recognize that this message that we've got it attracts the attention of the rainbow trout that's what we've got here and we need to share it we need to understand what we need that's why the bride when brother Brown says she'll know what to do with the word sounds like a big statement she's going to speak this and speak that no God hiding himself in you and me in simplicity let us pray father we thank you for the word this morning Lord we appreciate father the grace that you have given us Lord to recognize this time the season that we're living in Lord Lord may you continue to speak to our hearts move in our lives do the simple things in our lives day in and day out Lord that help us to recognize that we are a part of that economy Lord It's just Grace Lord we didn't do anything to deserve it but we appreciate it father we appreciate your word we appreciate your ministers Lord remember the service coming up this Wednesday night Lord may your anointing move Upon Our precious brother to minister your word and Lord let this word just continue Lord we've just been feasting lately it's just been tremendous father what you've been doing in our midst Lord and father is it because it's really culminating and we're going to be leaving soon could this be the hour Lord blessed be your wonderful name come Lord Jesus remember our pastor bring him safely sister Desiree Lord protect them and guide them Lord we love you we appreciate you and we will never fail but to give you all the glory in Jesus name God bless you Saints [Music] [Applause] [Music] it is we are gone [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] when I said yes [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] the original [Music] it is [Music] how many enjoy the world today amen we have Grace to come and do the vision statement for us [Music] Hallelujah [Music] our vision is to be a life-changing Ministry transforming the world one person at a time our purpose is to bring people to Jesus for membership in his family growing them into maturity equipping them for his ministry to fulfill their life's purpose of glorifying God we are changing lives forever amen you are dismissed this morning first Rapture and faith is the hunger of my soul today [Music] everything changed [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh Jesus Christ [Music] or after and faith [Music] to change [Music] [Applause] [Music] it must change [Music] spirit not to raise Christ [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] no more tonight [Music] with me [Music] [Music] all right [Music] the words [Music] [Applause] [Music] batteries [Music] [Applause] [Music] take love [Music] the Lord [Music] is worth [Music] no matter what
