[41:40] old and uh
[41:42] he was converted in a ministry
[41:45] and god dealt with him you know he did
[41:48] the very things the brothers are doing
[41:50] now playing to get to our bless help he
[41:52] was a real good guitarist well known in
[41:55] the country for playing the guitar and
[41:58] he was supportive of the ministry and
[42:01] was a you know leading the worship
[42:04] sometimes playing the songs there were
[42:06] several of them so he was just one but
[42:09] finally he became the pastor of his
[42:13] little church
[42:15] back in the very village where he was
[42:17] the only con convert from that village
[42:21] and he went back there started a church
[42:24] and god blessed him
[42:26] now i looked look back and i see the

[43:51] revelation
[43:53] 12
[43:56] 7-12
[44:00] hallelujah
[44:04] let us read together
[44:08] and
[44:09] there was war in heaven
[44:13] michael and his angels
[44:16] fought against the dragon
[44:19] and the dragon fought and his angels
[44:23] and
[44:24] prevailed
[44:26] not
[44:27] well you think in light of gates of hell
[44:30] shall
[44:30] not
[44:32] prevail against the church
[44:35] and neither was
[44:37] their place found any more
[44:41] there's a that is happening right now
[44:43] while we speak
[44:45] that many
[44:47] there's no place found for them as the
[44:50] bible says judas went out and hanged
[44:53] himself because there was no place for
[44:56] him
[44:57] couldn't find his position or place
[45:00] because he he didn't fit in the body he
[45:03] started started to show now amen
[45:05] manifesting time
[45:08] where
[45:09] we stand from the inside out
[45:13] and the great dragon was cast out the
[45:16] old serpent that old serpent called the
[45:20] devil
[45:21] and satan
[45:22] which deceiveth the whole world
[45:25] he was cast out
[45:27] into the earth
[45:29] and his angels were cast out with him
[45:33] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[45:36] heaven
[45:37] now is come salvation
[45:40] and strength
[45:41] and the kingdom of our god and the power
[45:45] of his christ for the accused of our
[45:48] of our brethren is cast down which
[45:52] accused them before our god
[45:56] day and night
[45:57] and they overcame him by the blood of
[46:01] the lamb
[46:03] and by the word of their testimony
[46:06] and they love not their lives unto death
[46:11] therefore
[46:12] rejoice you heavens and you that dwell
[46:16] therein woe unto the inhabitants of the
[46:19] earth and of the sea for the devil has
[46:22] come down unto you having great wrath
[46:26] because he knew it
[46:28] that he had
[46:30] but a short time
[46:32] amen god bless the reading of his word
[46:35] father we commit ourselves to you as we
[46:38] have read the word now we pray he will
[46:41] apply the word apply the token of the
[46:44] word of our to our hearts that we may
[46:47] rejoice in thee and live now and
[46:50] forevermore in jesus name amen and amen
[46:54] praise the lord god bless you
[46:58] i want to thank god for you who are here
[47:01] in the house of the lord to identify
[47:03] yourself with the message of this hour
[47:06] because it's becoming
[47:08] more and more difficult for you to do so
[47:11] uh for you to carry the reproach for the
[47:13] word
[47:14] uh you see
[47:16] you apply that to the word back there
[47:18] preached by jesus which is true you
[47:22] apply that to the word preached back
[47:24] there by the prophet which is true you
[47:27] must make a reproach for the word but
[47:29] you realize jesus christ is the same
[47:32] yesterday today and forever so you have
[47:35] to bear the reproach for the word that
[47:38] you are even receiving now
[47:41] you got to carry the reproach for of for
[47:44] that word you are hearing now amen
[47:48] because
[47:49] as you know
[47:51] we've been preaching
[47:53] on the eternal church age
[47:56] we've been talking about the capstone
[47:58] ministry
[47:59] and we've been talking about how if you
[48:02] have an eternal church age then you have
[48:06] to have an eternal messenger to that age
[48:11] now of course we know god only let the
[48:14] prophet
[48:17] use that term
[48:19] because for you human to us humans to
[48:22] understand
[48:24] um
[48:25] when you say age you know that that's a
[48:28] period of time
[48:30] but this eternal and age the two words
[48:34] going together
[48:36] god just had to allow that
[48:38] right because one speaks of time and the
[48:41] other one speaks of eternity
[48:43] but
[48:44] for you to understand because you come
[48:46] through seven ages
[48:49] so he just said eternal church age
[48:53] at the end of the seals
[48:56] that's when people are going to start to
[48:58] go back and stuff like that i'm starting
[49:01] to preach but that's good because here
[49:04] to get in the spirit before you do
[49:07] anything
[49:08] before you accomplish anything for god
[49:11] you must get in the spirit
[49:13] amen today i'd like to talk about this
[49:16] great angel of the covenant
[49:18] the angel of uh in exodus
[49:22] 32 33 34 whom jesus said my angel is set
[49:27] to lead you he will lead you and guide
[49:30] you and protect you
[49:32] we know that same angel was the pillar
[49:35] of fire
[49:36] we know that same angel had the covenant
[49:40] over his head
[49:41] and the bible calls him the angel
[49:44] of the covenant
[49:46] revelation 10 1
[49:48] mighty angel came down with a rainbow
[49:52] around his head
[49:54] and his feet were like pillars of fire
[49:58] the spirit of god so surrounded him
[50:01] that when he came down the book which
[50:04] was in the hand of god on the throne
[50:09] that was shut up with seven seals and
[50:12] the lamb took the book
[50:15] but when we see the lamb in his other
[50:18] roll
[50:19] we see him coming down
[50:22] as the angel of the covenant because
[50:26] here it comes
[50:28] with the book not closed but the book is
[50:31] now open
[50:33] and it's in the hand
[50:36] not of the lamb that you saw there
[50:39] but in the hand of this angel of the
[50:43] covenant it's the same one just changing
[50:46] his roles just changing his title amen
[50:50] so this angel of the covenant
[50:53] is come back to us and prophesied
[50:56] according to revelation 10 1 to 7
[50:58] malachi 4 5 and luke 17 30 and 31 amen
[51:03] how that the word would come back to us
[51:07] in the last day especially the word
[51:10] would be restored back to god's people
[51:14] and he's telling you in what form what
[51:17] shape
[51:18] what it's going to
[51:19] and morph itself and then reveal itself
[51:22] back to us it'll come back to us in the
[51:26] form of this mighty angel of the
[51:29] covenant
[51:31] hallelujah of course
[51:33] the covenant
[51:35] is the agreement that god and pro and
[51:38] promises god has between himself and his
[51:41] people
[51:42] that is to say
[51:43] the angel of the word
[51:47] angel of the covenant just means angel
[51:50] of the word
[51:53] and the word of course brother branham
[51:55] says you know angel
[51:58] there is
[51:59] angels of earth which are man and there
[52:02] were angels of heaven
[52:04] right
[52:06] this mighty great angel he's not a man
[52:09] of the earth but he is the lord from
[52:12] heaven come down
[52:14] he said that was the second that was the
[52:16] coming of christ himself hallelujah
[52:19] therefore this mighty angel that we look
[52:22] at this great
[52:24] covenant angel he says and the word
[52:27] angel
[52:29] really means messenger
[52:32] so when you say angel of the covenant
[52:36] you are saying
[52:37] messenger of the word
[52:41] messenger of the word hallelujah praise
[52:45] god just just remember these things that
[52:49] for seven ages
[52:52] god sent
[52:53] prophets he sent various uh men
[52:56] reformers to bring his word but brother
[53:00] branham said in the end god became his
[53:03] own prophet
[53:05] hallelujah god become his own messenger
[53:09] god became the one speaking for himself
[53:12] but let's go back before
[53:15] time began
[53:17] let's go back before the beginning
[53:20] where the bible tells us in this book of
[53:22] revelation
[53:24] and there
[53:25] was war
[53:27] in heaven
[53:29] what was it like in heaven before the
[53:32] beginning
[53:33] absolutely
[53:35] we find out as isaiah tells us if you
[53:38] will search the book of isaiah you will
[53:40] find in there him telling this telling
[53:42] about how lucifer was there how he was a
[53:46] beautiful angel powerful angel how he
[53:49] was a great singer
[53:51] and worship leader
[53:53] and how he led the pipes when he let the
[53:56] flutes and he led all the instruments
[53:59] well you can see when
[54:01] revelation genesis begins to tell us his
[54:05] descendants from the time they hit the
[54:07] earth
[54:08] they start to create instruments all
[54:11] kind of instruments and organs and this
[54:13] and that they come begin to create it
[54:15] they were great anyway that's he was the
[54:18] leader over all of the worship and he
[54:21] describes heaven with all the beautiful
[54:24] precious stones and everything else like
[54:27] that
[54:28] of course we find out that he used his
[54:32] position
[54:34] instead of using to worship and glorify
[54:38] god
[54:39] he was doing it but while he was doing
[54:42] it he had deceit in his heart
[54:45] because he
[54:47] started
[54:49] a whisper campaign
[54:52] he is one of the whisperers spoken of in
[54:55] the bible for psalms proverbs uh over
[54:59] there in some of the prophets speak of
[55:01] these people that like to peep and
[55:03] whisper and mutter right like that and
[55:06] then he refers them to like the
[55:09] necromancers and the
[55:11] wizards and witches loving to whisper
[55:14] and so on like that whisperers which god
[55:17] doesn't like whisperers if you got to
[55:19] say something say it plain
[55:21] if you can't say it in front the person
[55:23] shut up
[55:24] don't go behind us whispering and so he
[55:26] started a whisper campaign as we say on
[55:30] earth behind god's back there's no such
[55:32] a thing no you're going to get behind
[55:34] his back but
[55:35] he thought he could get behind god's
[55:38] back and
[55:39] start to miss which means showing that
[55:41] he really really believe that god is who
[55:44] he says he is omniscient omnipresent
[55:46] knowing all seeing all whatnot and you
[55:49] know everything like that he's not
[55:51] really believing the depths of his heart
[55:54] and his beauty outside was just a mask
[55:58] to cover up the evil that was in him
[56:01] right and we see that everywhere right
[56:05] so he started this whisper campaign
[56:08] and this whisper campaign
[56:10] was made up of uh rumors
[56:14] usually when you try to track them down
[56:16] you don't know where it started
[56:18] you don't know who first said it because
[56:20] it's just a rumor that went out there
[56:24] and the rumor is based on innuendo
[56:28] which it's not somebody come out plainly
[56:31] and say something
[56:33] no uh it's just a little hint
[56:36] it's another word you can use there
[56:39] they just give you just a little hint
[56:42] or or inference or an intimation
[56:46] some kind of a
[56:48] suggestion right it's just suggested in
[56:51] that way
[56:53] behind the scenes and when that all that
[56:56] start to accumulate
[56:58] and you've seen some of this over in the
[57:00] united states if i might frankly speak
[57:03] it start with one little tiny inference
[57:07] and just go on and start to build and
[57:10] build and build until it grabs a hole of
[57:13] the consciousness of the people
[57:16] and then it comes out as a big lie
[57:21] but before he tell the big lie
[57:24] he told some tiny tales
[57:27] that's why brother branham said a lot of
[57:29] people think that the devil has tails
[57:31] like they're seeing those pictures
[57:33] he got a fork tail like that he said but
[57:36] it's not those tails that me he told
[57:39] tales in heaven he told little lies
[57:43] until their lies accumulate and build up
[57:47] amen and then he could he could uh
[57:50] openly now start to tell a lying story
[57:54] but he started with those behind the
[57:56] scenes things and
[57:58] fabrications that he started to make up
[58:02] and now you're going to find a lot of
[58:04] false religions are made up of a lot of
[58:06] mythology full of mythologies
[58:10] when you read them it's just tales
[58:12] it's things that uh satan inspire some
[58:16] man or somebody to write about something
[58:20] they saw and it ends up being
[58:23] some man-made tales made by man
[58:28] not a one of them is based on the
[58:31] fullness of the word of god
[58:34] if it was
[58:36] then they come to this world
[58:39] amen and they'll know him in the power
[58:42] of his resurrection hallelujah amen yes
[58:46] sir so he start to tell this little lies
[58:51] you know if you know god is dead
[58:54] god
[58:56] if they had even thought about it god
[58:58] dead
[59:00] how do the two things go together that
[59:02] god could die but he told that lie god
[59:06] is dead right then you tell this other
[59:09] lie it's all in the bible there is no
[59:11] god
[59:13] right not was he just like us
[59:16] we all the same thing oh we all gods so
[59:20] there's no real god sure so he says
[59:23] there is no god the bible said the fool
[59:25] says in his heart
[59:28] that there is no god
[59:32] then for those ones that still want to
[59:33] go on believing that there is a god he
[59:36] says yeah well even if there is a god
[59:38] he's a god of judgment
[59:40] he's a god of he has no mercy he'll send
[59:44] you to hell
[59:45] burn you in the pit of fire without any
[59:48] mercy whatsoever
[59:51] and not only that he brings hurricanes
[59:55] he brings earthquake
[59:56] he brings sickness
[59:58] he brings virus and disease
[1:00:01] and even kill your your loved ones
[1:00:05] god kill them and take them away from
[1:00:08] you how can you say god is love
[1:00:11] meanwhile they're listening to one of
[1:00:12] the biggest criminals the world has ever
[1:00:15] seen
[1:00:16] one of the biggest liars the world has
[1:00:19] ever known amen when he is the one that
[1:00:22] lights the fire turn around and says god
[1:00:25] light the fire and i'm going to put it
[1:00:27] out so i can look like a good guy right
[1:00:30] that's what he does so he brings the
[1:00:32] hurricanes he the bible the prophet said
[1:00:36] ten thousand devils stirred up that
[1:00:39] storm that wanted to take down the boat
[1:00:42] that jesus was in
[1:00:44] he said you could hear them howling in
[1:00:46] the winds
[1:00:47] you could hear them screaming even you
[1:00:50] might be able to hear them sometimes
[1:00:52] during the winter when that wind begins
[1:00:54] to scream and how and there it was the
[1:00:57] devil bringing all these hurricanes
[1:01:00] earthquakes disaster pain heartaches
[1:01:04] grief
[1:01:05] death killing the people destroying them
[1:01:08] and then he turns around
[1:01:10] and he wants to blame god
[1:01:14] and say god is the one
[1:01:16] that is really doing that
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:21] of course he is the one that started the
[1:01:24] war that in heaven you know but and
[1:01:26] there was war in heaven who started the
[1:01:28] war satan amen satan started the war
[1:01:33] and that is why his worship as the god
[1:01:36] of mars which meaning god of war
[1:01:40] right he started all wars to this minute
[1:01:44] and let me throw in all wars start in
[1:01:47] heaven as such either in the literal
[1:01:50] heaven or in this one
[1:01:53] right this part here it's got to start
[1:01:56] here first before it becomes physical
[1:01:59] altercation any anger anything it's a
[1:02:03] war in your mind and it has to start
[1:02:05] there before it translates into physical
[1:02:08] action right always the case like that
[1:02:12] amen so
[1:02:13] he is the god of war hallelujah and when
[1:02:18] god was ready god of course had to
[1:02:20] respond to his
[1:02:23] actions of subversion
[1:02:26] he started to subvert the kingdom of god
[1:02:30] hallelujah many years ago i preached a
[1:02:33] message on that subversion of the
[1:02:35] kingdom of god and showing that the
[1:02:37] devil and his actors usually come in the
[1:02:41] church
[1:02:42] and try to subvert the word
[1:02:46] and the messenger whoever he is
[1:02:49] in the house of god the representative
[1:02:52] god they want to subvert that and and
[1:02:56] subvert the power in the kingdom and
[1:02:59] tear it down with his strategy of strike
[1:03:02] the head and all the sheep will be
[1:03:05] scattered always the case of satan
[1:03:08] pulling that trick amen and so god
[1:03:13] was now going to act against what satan
[1:03:16] was doing and the bible reads and there
[1:03:20] was war in heaven for for there to be
[1:03:24] war you gotta have two contestants
[1:03:28] one just can't go warren
[1:03:30] with himself
[1:03:31] like paul said you know you fight and
[1:03:34] abuse and and and bite and envying and
[1:03:37] strife among your own cells and you know
[1:03:41] the devil spirit is like that even the
[1:03:44] devils without us preaching the word
[1:03:48] they're constantly fighting one another
[1:03:50] they're constantly cursing swearing
[1:03:53] they're constantly killing and abusing
[1:03:55] one another they don't need you to do
[1:03:57] that that's the nature to do that
[1:04:00] they're evil they're wicked amen and
[1:04:02] when they get somebody
[1:04:05] innocent believing god then they find a
[1:04:08] mutual uh a mutual person
[1:04:12] or thing that they can all come like
[1:04:14] wolves and attack that individual right
[1:04:18] but their nature is to be like that and
[1:04:21] they're fighting one another amen so
[1:04:25] this
[1:04:26] war there was war in heaven
[1:04:29] the war was a war of supernatural beings
[1:04:34] supernatural beings
[1:04:36] and in that war we know the bible tells
[1:04:39] us lucifer was defeated
[1:04:43] hallelujah you see brother brown said if
[1:04:46] god did something once
[1:04:49] he has to keep doing that same thing all
[1:04:52] the time
[1:04:53] so we are assured no matter where satan
[1:04:57] raises his head whatever he tries to do
[1:05:00] the bible said he was kicked out of
[1:05:02] heaven
[1:05:03] he was defeated by the holy spirit
[1:05:07] and every time he raise your his head
[1:05:10] whether in society within your life your
[1:05:12] family he is defeated by the word of god
[1:05:16] in the name of jesus christ
[1:05:20] he said god can't do something one time
[1:05:24] and don't
[1:05:25] continue to do that same thing all the
[1:05:28] time every time right back to eternity
[1:05:31] it has to be that way because god is
[1:05:34] perfect in everything he do
[1:05:37] so the devil is defeated
[1:05:40] what happens with because we are human
[1:05:44] we have this mental thing we have to
[1:05:46] deal with
[1:05:47] and we we have to deal with the truth
[1:05:50] the truth doesn't change
[1:05:52] the devil is defeated
[1:05:55] but the devil will play in your mind oh
[1:05:58] you know but i see this lump still on my
[1:06:00] hand
[1:06:01] even though the word tells me i'm healed
[1:06:04] oh i i feel this
[1:06:06] playing on your five senses i'm not
[1:06:08] going to preach on that i'm just past
[1:06:10] passing by this yeah he's going to play
[1:06:12] on those he's a master of playing on
[1:06:15] those five senses then he'll go and
[1:06:17] he'll give you an imagination
[1:06:20] either that you're already sick and
[1:06:21] laying in your bed
[1:06:23] or an imagination that you can't walk
[1:06:26] he throws that on your mind so strong
[1:06:29] that your mind tells your body and your
[1:06:30] body can't do it no more
[1:06:32] amen tells you i can't see tell your
[1:06:34] ears you can't hear oh it looks like
[1:06:36] you're losing your hearing
[1:06:38] amen the devil and tell you oh looks
[1:06:40] like you're losing your mind
[1:06:42] and so and the moment you start
[1:06:44] believing and receiving that of course
[1:06:46] it starts going into effect that's not
[1:06:48] my topic today i just happened to be
[1:06:50] passing by there but he kicked out to
[1:06:52] heaven
[1:06:53] and the bible tells us there were the
[1:06:57] devil and all the angels that followed
[1:07:00] him were kicked out upon the earth
[1:07:04] in jesus said
[1:07:06] and i looked and i saw
[1:07:09] satan fall from heaven like lightning
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:13] jesus is testifying
[1:07:15] that this literally happened and satan
[1:07:19] was kicked out and cast out that's not a
[1:07:23] story that's not mythology that is the
[1:07:26] word of god that he was kicked out of
[1:07:29] heaven light lightning and fell to the
[1:07:32] earth
[1:07:32] hallelujah
[1:07:34] the moment he fell to the earth
[1:07:37] woe to the to you on the earth for the
[1:07:40] devil your
[1:07:41] has come down
[1:07:42] and he knows he has what a short time
[1:07:46] amen praise god remember a thousand
[1:07:48] years is like a day to god and the devil
[1:07:51] being up there in heaven so seven
[1:07:53] thousand years
[1:07:55] it's just like a week to him
[1:07:57] right so he just go on like that right
[1:08:00] so here we do he knows his time is short
[1:08:03] and whatever evil he has to do he has to
[1:08:05] do it quick
[1:08:06] right he has to do it fast and that's
[1:08:08] why the devil and his people always like
[1:08:12] to be moving fast moving moving
[1:08:14] where you come from satan from going to
[1:08:17] and fro throughout the earth
[1:08:21] he is not omniscient and omnipotent like
[1:08:23] god
[1:08:24] he only can be one place at one time so
[1:08:27] he has to be quick all over the place so
[1:08:29] he can see and know everything so be
[1:08:30] able to
[1:08:31] yeah right he got to make it up with
[1:08:33] speed and running around and rushing
[1:08:36] around and god turns around and tells
[1:08:38] people don't worry about rushing around
[1:08:41] i'll tell you what to do
[1:08:43] be still
[1:08:45] and know
[1:08:46] be still
[1:08:48] and i'm going to let you know
[1:08:50] right and once you know you'll know how
[1:08:52] to act
[1:08:54] you have to rush
[1:08:56] and then after you rush around for days
[1:08:58] then you'll find out
[1:09:01] and then you're going to go and act no
[1:09:04] stop
[1:09:06] and ask him
[1:09:07] because he knows everything and let him
[1:09:09] talk to you
[1:09:11] hallelujah but the w think when he
[1:09:14] dropped down here he stopped fighting
[1:09:16] the war never ended
[1:09:18] the war now gone into another level
[1:09:21] because he dropped to the earth and he
[1:09:24] started to deceive the human race
[1:09:27] and of course at that time the human
[1:09:29] race was
[1:09:31] two people
[1:09:33] adam and eve
[1:09:35] and he looked for the weakest
[1:09:39] link in the chain
[1:09:41] the weakest weakest point
[1:09:43] so
[1:09:44] he knows that the man's weakness is his
[1:09:47] wife because he loves her
[1:09:50] and if he threaten the wife the man is
[1:09:53] going to do what he tells him because he
[1:09:55] want to save his wife
[1:09:58] and so he went and deceived uh eve
[1:10:03] hallelujah
[1:10:05] and true eve he started to blind
[1:10:09] the entire human race to the word of god
[1:10:13] he started to blind them and by blinding
[1:10:16] them he was start he he was able to put
[1:10:19] his coils
[1:10:21] and wrap around them and bind them
[1:10:24] so they were blinded
[1:10:26] and then they were bound
[1:10:29] and then after they were bound
[1:10:31] he was able to take them and cast them
[1:10:34] into his prison
[1:10:36] all right the whole human race
[1:10:39] imprisoned
[1:10:41] in satan's dungeons of sin
[1:10:45] dungeons of sin
[1:10:47] and later we will later on speak of
[1:10:50] those
[1:10:51] oh my
[1:10:52] as it was
[1:10:54] up there in heaven
[1:10:56] when the bible says
[1:10:59] and there was war in heaven
[1:11:02] and
[1:11:03] satan and his angels
[1:11:05] began to fight against god
[1:11:08] and the bible tells us god sent forth
[1:11:11] whom michael the archangel
[1:11:15] and michael with the rest of the angels
[1:11:17] fought against lucifer the great dragon
[1:11:21] called satan the old serpent

[1:11:27] there were defeated and cast out of
[1:11:30] heaven amen hallelujah once again

[1:11:46] boat ashore we're floating down the
[1:11:48] stream of time we have not long to stay
[1:11:52] amen but praise god

[1:11:58] once again michael comes on the scene
[1:12:01] with the angels of the living god to
[1:12:04] fight against the devil and all of his
[1:12:06] angels amen
[1:12:08] praise god michael take care of that
[1:12:11] problem
[1:12:12] genesis 3
[1:12:14] verse 15.

[1:12:40] hallelujah that seed is going to be
[1:12:44] known as the redeemer
[1:12:46] he's going to be known as the messiah
[1:12:49] he's going to be known as your savior
[1:12:53] praise god to deal with your invasion of
[1:12:58] sin he's going to deal with it

[1:13:04] engaged in this part
[1:13:08] in the engagement of the greatest battle
[1:13:12] that was ever fought
[1:13:14] we are just in another stage of the same
[1:13:17] battle
[1:13:18] that we are in
[1:13:20] and we are
[1:13:22] soldiers in the armies of the lord
[1:13:25] praise god
[1:13:27] where we come from
[1:13:28] you come not from time but from eternity
[1:13:33] because you are the seeds of god you are
[1:13:35] in god
[1:13:37] you are in the mind of god
[1:13:40] you know the scripture where were you
[1:13:41] when this morning star sang together and
[1:13:43] the sons of god shouted for joy but
[1:13:46] where were you when the war took place
[1:13:48] in heaven whose side were you on when
[1:13:51] you were up there who did you fight with
[1:13:53] when you was up there did you fight on
[1:13:56] god's side did you fight on the side of

[1:14:13] there you're going to be a part of him
[1:14:14] down there
[1:14:15] if you believed him up there you're
[1:14:17] going to believe him down here
[1:14:19] if you're fought in the war up there
[1:14:21] when you're confronted by the same old
[1:14:24] serpent the ancient old enemy again
[1:14:28] you're gonna fight against him again the
[1:14:31] same way you did as it was up there
[1:14:34] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:14:37] praise the lord well my friends
[1:14:40] since that fateful day in eden
[1:14:43] with eve in eden
[1:14:46] satan has spent
[1:14:48] thousands and thousands of years from
[1:14:51] that time and all they are engaged in
[1:14:55] is nothing good
[1:14:57] but evil
[1:14:59] because their thousands of years is
[1:15:02] spent
[1:15:03] with blinding the human race
[1:15:06] to the word of god blind you so you
[1:15:08] can't see it
[1:15:10] binding the human race
[1:15:13] and imprisoning the human race
[1:15:16] in
[1:15:17] his prisons
[1:15:18] of sin
[1:15:20] but thank god
[1:15:22] after thousands of years the bible tells
[1:15:24] us then jesus came
[1:15:27] praise god hallelujah then jesus came
[1:15:31] you know the song one sat alone beside
[1:15:34] the highway begging his eyes were blind
[1:15:38] the light the word he could not see what
[1:15:41] thy god jesus came open the eyes and
[1:15:45] made him to see the fullness of the word
[1:15:48] of the living god
[1:15:50] satan came again and on the earth
[1:15:53] defeated satan at every point and time
[1:15:58] that he met him to prove to your eyes to
[1:16:02] those who are instilling their five
[1:16:04] senses that i defeat him up there let me
[1:16:07] show you how and he does the same thing
[1:16:10] again here upon the earth that you might
[1:16:13] know that's thus saith the lord
[1:16:16] this is not some story was told how he
[1:16:18] was defeated in heaven and dropped down
[1:16:20] here because look i'm defeating him now
[1:16:22] i'm defeating him right in front of you
[1:16:24] i'm defeating him now praise god
[1:16:27] hallelujah
[1:16:29] you know he's being defeated now while
[1:16:30] i'm preaching
[1:16:32] in hawaii the prophet said don't you
[1:16:35] know
[1:16:36] it's not just the healing of the sick
[1:16:38] it's not casting out to the devils and
[1:16:40] seeing that that's good and that's
[1:16:42] supposed to happen but he says the real
[1:16:45] victory
[1:16:47] for casting out the devil
[1:16:49] is casting out unbelief
[1:16:52] from the hearts and minds of god's
[1:16:54] people that is the real victory amen
[1:16:57] praise god amen hallelujah
[1:17:00] the preaching of the revealed words sets
[1:17:04] the captives free
[1:17:07] it loses your mind
[1:17:09] it brings you out of the prison house
[1:17:12] it sets you free and it casts out the
[1:17:15] spirits of doubt and unbelief and fear
[1:17:19] out of your life out of your mind out of
[1:17:22] your family out of your existence that
[1:17:24] you might walk in the light of the world
[1:17:27] amen praise god hallelujah amen defeated
[1:17:33] satan and he is so mad you know praise
[1:17:37] god mad with his insane fury he start
[1:17:42] like
[1:17:42] forgetting himself
[1:17:44] he starts hissing around
[1:17:46] he start roaring like a like an old lion
[1:17:51] you know you know that a young lion
[1:17:53] don't have to be roaring roaring every
[1:17:55] minute
[1:17:57] he just stays in the grass and when he
[1:17:59] knows the prey passing he jumps out
[1:18:02] grabs a hole of it but the old lion
[1:18:04] already lost his teeth
[1:18:07] he lost his claws
[1:18:09] he don't have any means of being able to
[1:18:11] catch some animal so he has to
[1:18:15] roar
[1:18:16] when he keeps that noise the animals get
[1:18:18] confused and they run and sometimes they
[1:18:21] run right into him and that's how he get
[1:18:24] to feed himself he grabbed a hold of
[1:18:25] whoever runs to him and he eats that
[1:18:28] praise god so your adversary the devil
[1:18:31] goes around like a roaring lion
[1:18:35] an old roaring lion that lost his teeth
[1:18:39] lost his claws lost the means of being
[1:18:42] able to defend and so he has to go
[1:18:44] around roaring
[1:18:46] he's already defeated so here he is
[1:18:50] hissing
[1:18:51] and i've seen it casting all the devils
[1:18:54] i've seen the spirit of the devil
[1:18:56] on the people they fall on the ground
[1:18:59] and they start twisting and moving like
[1:19:00] a snake
[1:19:01] and out of their mouth comes the hissing
[1:19:05] carrying on like that
[1:19:07] amen sometimes they're snarling
[1:19:10] barking like a dog
[1:19:12] hear them barking turn on uh just the
[1:19:15] other day watching the tv and they said
[1:19:17] look the people don't even recognize
[1:19:19] what's happening
[1:19:20] they come to pass the whole world going
[1:19:22] in saying
[1:19:24] amen the devil possessing the people
[1:19:27] yeah
[1:19:28] is this person
[1:19:30] roaring and and spitting and snarling
[1:19:34] and turning on like an animal what was
[1:19:37] it it was demons
[1:19:39] and it's devils that do that on the
[1:19:41] people in them roaring you have seen
[1:19:45] them casting out them they're forming at
[1:19:47] the mouth you're foaming foaming foaming
[1:19:50] it's the devil
[1:19:51] mad and insane that again he's being
[1:19:54] kicked out that again he's being cast
[1:19:57] out again he got to go look for another
[1:19:59] new house he got to get somewhere else
[1:20:02] and so he is mad and he doesn't like it
[1:20:05] whatsoever amen
[1:20:08] yes
[1:20:09] hallelujah
[1:20:11] but this devil is a man of strategy
[1:20:15] and he knows when he try a frontal war
[1:20:18] an assault against jesus
[1:20:20] he's being defeated every single time
[1:20:24] so
[1:20:25] he takes another approach
[1:20:29] and he come to jesus master
[1:20:33] we know you're a teacher sent from god
[1:20:36] right
[1:20:37] oh my you know how he start with
[1:20:41] trying to play up on jesus's pride
[1:20:44] and position he's trying to play up like
[1:20:46] that and oh praise god
[1:20:50] any man of god knows that the devil does
[1:20:52] that
[1:20:53] oh brother simon i know you know the
[1:20:56] word
[1:20:57] and when i was a younger minister he
[1:20:59] said you know i wanted to ask what do
[1:21:01] you think about this
[1:21:04] and being a young minister you're not
[1:21:06] thinking and then you just say oh well i
[1:21:08] think so so so so
[1:21:10] the next thing you know you're in hot
[1:21:12] water
[1:21:16] because
[1:21:17] it's spread over you know i asked
[1:21:19] brother simon this and he said that he
[1:21:22] said this he told me this and he told me
[1:21:24] that and he told me this is all right i
[1:21:27] never did
[1:21:28] you just asked me something and i said
[1:21:31] well maybe it could be this it could be
[1:21:33] that could be the other but you making
[1:21:35] it a positive thing now he said this
[1:21:39] so they're asking jesus that to kind of
[1:21:42] trap him
[1:21:44] right
[1:21:45] of course i after a young preacher you
[1:21:47] get caught in that once twice how many
[1:21:49] times are they ever going to catch you
[1:21:50] with that you learn you know see you
[1:21:53] learn the hard way right right you pay
[1:21:56] it to learn praise god you gotta pay the
[1:21:58] head master pay the teacher or the
[1:22:00] principal before he admitted through
[1:22:02] that school of experience and life all
[1:22:04] right so the devil come back now they
[1:22:07] come to jesus he said master we know the
[1:22:11] word the teacher sent from
[1:22:13] god
[1:22:14] well what do you say about this and what
[1:22:17] do you see about that and jesus the
[1:22:20] bible says and jesus knowing in their
[1:22:23] heart
[1:22:24] actually who it was and what they were
[1:22:26] doing he answered them and stopped them
[1:22:29] and shut them out
[1:22:30] because they can't say nothing he said
[1:22:33] why are you asking me did not isaiah
[1:22:35] already say so so
[1:22:38] don't fight with me fight with isaiah
[1:22:41] right praise god and some of them come
[1:22:43] and say well
[1:22:45] they mark my mouth they mark his mouth
[1:22:47] and like i told you the holy spirit said
[1:22:50] that marking doesn't mean they just
[1:22:51] remember he said the scribes or those
[1:22:54] pharisees and sadducees were actually
[1:22:56] writing down what he said
[1:22:59] so that no matter how long after they
[1:23:01] can compare it
[1:23:03] and they can
[1:23:04] be able to accuse him
[1:23:06] so they're marking my mouth too now i'm
[1:23:09] saying that that not to tell you don't
[1:23:12] take notes like i explained it's the
[1:23:14] motive with which you are taking those
[1:23:16] notes
[1:23:17] right but here it is
[1:23:19] that even my mouth is marking
[1:23:22] praise god because you know i get the
[1:23:25] calls not from near here far away from
[1:23:28] here i stayed here on sunday but before
[1:23:30] you know it i'm hearing it way or
[1:23:31] somewhere else or something else right
[1:23:34] and totally different from what i
[1:23:36] actually say
[1:23:38] oh i don't believe that i don't believe
[1:23:40] there's no such thing as an eternal
[1:23:42] george age they know such a
[1:23:45] it's right there the prophet said that
[1:23:46] it's not me saying it
[1:23:49] i just repeat what he said i have my way
[1:23:52] of how i say things
[1:23:54] but
[1:23:54] did he say it or didn't he say it well i
[1:23:57] do the same thing that jesus did jesus
[1:24:00] said why you asking me did not isaiah
[1:24:03] the prophet say
[1:24:04] amen
[1:24:06] that he
[1:24:07] he was wounded he was afflicted he
[1:24:09] opened not his mouth did he not say that
[1:24:12] amen and i can say the same thing did
[1:24:14] not the prophet say
[1:24:17] page 6 that was a perfect man did he not
[1:24:20] say that he's waiting for that mad woman
[1:24:24] that man that will come to enter into
[1:24:27] that eternal church age
[1:24:31] it begins where at the ending of the
[1:24:34] seals
[1:24:35] they're going to be redeemed
[1:24:38] the man the woman that's going to be
[1:24:41] redeemed
[1:24:42] hallelujah i'm not going to preach on
[1:24:44] that because you know the real
[1:24:45] redemption is the resumption by
[1:24:47] revelation the real rapture is rapture
[1:24:50] by revelation of the word which i can't
[1:24:52] give you i'm only here preaching praise
[1:24:54] god but i can't give you you've got to
[1:24:56] have that spirit of revelation on you
[1:24:59] and you can't have it unless god give
[1:25:01] that to you in your spiritual dna your
[1:25:05] genes amen your seed life that you come
[1:25:09] from god in the beginning you come from
[1:25:12] god you're going back to god and it's
[1:25:14] embedded in you
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:17] it's only now god woke up
[1:25:21] because of the spirit of almighty god
[1:25:24] hallelujah amen they're praising him
[1:25:28] with their mouth but really they were
[1:25:29] trying to embarrass him
[1:25:31] by trying to catch him with a hard
[1:25:34] question
[1:25:35] brother bran said in taking sides with
[1:25:37] jesus they use every means the devil
[1:25:40] knew he couldn't come with a frontal
[1:25:41] assault every time he'd be cast out
[1:25:44] defeated and and whether it's dead or
[1:25:46] sick they raised up the sick healed so
[1:25:50] he still continues doing that but he
[1:25:52] come with this next strategy and
[1:25:54] approach of trying the prophet said now
[1:25:57] he's going to blacken his name
[1:26:01] and they try to blacken his name
[1:26:03] and say by the way
[1:26:06] who really is your father
[1:26:09] um
[1:26:10] god the father god the holy ghost
[1:26:13] or
[1:26:13] or or the son
[1:26:15] which one is your father
[1:26:18] father son or holy ghost
[1:26:20] do you know who's
[1:26:22] oh my
[1:26:24] they're trying to tell him like i tell
[1:26:26] you they start with rumors and whispers
[1:26:28] before they come and tell an outright
[1:26:30] lie they're telling him that he's
[1:26:32] bastard born
[1:26:33] that's what they're telling him you just
[1:26:36] hear me don't even know who your father
[1:26:38] is
[1:26:39] but jesus answered them of course i and
[1:26:41] my father are one
[1:26:44] the father that dwelleth me it dwelleth
[1:26:47] in me he do at the works
[1:26:50] i'm not doing of myself he said i don't
[1:26:52] speak of myself but i speak what the
[1:26:55] father tells me to speak hallelujah
[1:26:58] praise god
[1:27:00] hallelujah
[1:27:01] so all of his attacks proved
[1:27:04] unsuccessful
[1:27:05] praise god hallelujah amen
[1:27:09] and then
[1:27:11] they had a conference in hell
[1:27:15] i know many preachers have tried to
[1:27:17] describe this conference and hell in the
[1:27:20] old days they used to even have plays
[1:27:22] about it in the churches of how the
[1:27:25] devil going to hell with this little
[1:27:27] black demons and will all and they're
[1:27:29] having their little conference in hell
[1:27:33] and their discussion in hell was well we
[1:27:36] tried the frontal assault we couldn't
[1:27:37] defeat him
[1:27:39] we try the rumors and they we try all
[1:27:42] these hints and suggestions that we
[1:27:44] can't beat him
[1:27:46] therefore you know let's try a new
[1:27:48] strategy
[1:27:50] if you can't beat him
[1:27:52] let's join him
[1:27:54] right
[1:27:56] so he sent out
[1:27:58] judas you say oh you know that well the
[1:28:01] bible says and judas that son of
[1:28:04] perdition
[1:28:05] son of hell
[1:28:07] son of satan
[1:28:09] is that right
[1:28:10] satan was he was a son a satan and you
[1:28:13] know what sonship is
[1:28:15] the father that dwelleth in me he do at
[1:28:19] the works
[1:28:20] i am the son and the father dwells in
[1:28:23] the sun
[1:28:24] and so if the sun
[1:28:27] comes and is there as a inside of jesus
[1:28:31] congregation
[1:28:32] and the father that was there before the
[1:28:35] foundations that already defeated satan
[1:28:37] in jesus is the two contestants meet up
[1:28:40] again juan and judas
[1:28:43] and one and jesus
[1:28:45] and there is a great contest taking
[1:28:47] place here again not up there in heaven
[1:28:50] but now it's right down here upon the
[1:28:52] earth amen hallelujah praise god so
[1:28:57] the conference decided now they're going
[1:29:00] to take a religious approach of faith
[1:29:05] and they're going to infiltrate and
[1:29:07] subvert the church of god
[1:29:10] claiming to have the same faith you got
[1:29:14] and that we are all one
[1:29:19] and the rest of the story
[1:29:21] you know the rest of it how judas
[1:29:25] as one of jesus's
[1:29:28] congregation one of his church members
[1:29:31] sold out the savior
[1:29:34] for gold
[1:29:36] and
[1:29:37] he sold them out
[1:29:39] for
[1:29:40] the money
[1:29:42] my
[1:29:43] oh my
[1:29:44] and he was jesus of course was crucified
[1:29:49] dead
[1:29:50] and buried and first peter if you turn
[1:29:53] in his bibles right there
[1:29:56] chapter 3
[1:29:58] verses 18
[1:30:00] and 19.
[1:30:04] you know the scripture but i want us to
[1:30:07] read it again
[1:30:14] hallelujah
[1:30:16] praise god
[1:30:25] hallelujah
[1:30:30] let's read
[1:30:31] for christ
[1:30:33] also had once suffered for sins the just
[1:30:36] for the unjust that he might bring us to
[1:30:39] god being put to death in the flesh but
[1:30:42] quickened by the spirit by which also he
[1:30:46] went and preached
[1:30:49] unto the spirits in prison
[1:30:55] i don't see here
[1:30:56] that he went
[1:30:58] and while he was going down he first had
[1:31:00] to pass through a place called purgatory
[1:31:07] it doesn't say that in here
[1:31:09] that he first had to pass through a
[1:31:11] middle ground
[1:31:13] which is being told that lie has been
[1:31:15] told to a lot of people you first have
[1:31:18] to pass through purgatory before you get
[1:31:20] right into hell
[1:31:22] right
[1:31:23] and so um if you were to pay enough
[1:31:27] money they'll be able to pray for you
[1:31:30] and so you can pass freely through
[1:31:32] purgatory bible tells us nothing of that
[1:31:35] it says he went right down into hell
[1:31:39] and the same way with heaven too absent
[1:31:41] from the body present with the lord is
[1:31:44] that right
[1:31:45] the bible says it is given unto man
[1:31:47] wants to die and after death the
[1:31:50] judgment
[1:31:51] hallelujah you're going straight on
[1:31:54] there's no delay anywhere
[1:31:57] amen praise god so stop paying for your
[1:32:00] old mother or your dad stop praying for
[1:32:03] them to to get out of that awful place
[1:32:07] because that is not the truth you're
[1:32:10] being told lies the bible says he went
[1:32:13] down
[1:32:15] uh he went and preached unto the spirits
[1:32:18] in prison
[1:32:20] which sometimes were disobedience when
[1:32:23] once the long suffering of god
[1:32:25] waited in the days of noah while the ark
[1:32:28] was a preparing
[1:32:30] wherein few
[1:32:32] that is
[1:32:33] its souls were saved
[1:32:37] by water amen praise god
[1:32:40] hallelujah look there's so many things
[1:32:42] one verse i just reading the verse and i
[1:32:44] get an arrested because you see you have
[1:32:47] you see how that verse ended up eight
[1:32:48] souls were saved by what
[1:32:51] you know someone i'm preaching that you
[1:32:53] saved by water baptism
[1:32:55] and they use the scriptures like that
[1:32:57] i'm just passing over stuff like that
[1:32:59] but that's how when you don't have
[1:33:01] revelation
[1:33:02] they go off on all kinds of things
[1:33:05] right in that nature amen so the devil
[1:33:08] can't beat
[1:33:10] so let's join them
[1:33:12] and he joined jesus's church
[1:33:15] then sold him out
[1:33:17] but
[1:33:18] jesus
[1:33:19] of course went right down to the great
[1:33:22] battle in death valley amen went down
[1:33:26] into hell
[1:33:27] and the battle continued
[1:33:30] hallelujah because the bible tells us
[1:33:33] yes i'm taking my time because this here
[1:33:35] is going to lead us to something else
[1:33:37] something else something else so here we
[1:33:40] are brothers the battle went down into
[1:33:42] hell and jesus the bible says he rose up
[1:33:47] said he only died in the flesh
[1:33:50] amen but raised and went to glory in the
[1:33:54] spirit
[1:33:55] hallelujah and how
[1:33:58] that he came back down in the form of
[1:34:01] the holy ghost
[1:34:02] and now not a one-man body
[1:34:06] but a many-membered body
[1:34:09] dwelling in the apostles
[1:34:12] christ in the apostles working through
[1:34:14] them praise god
[1:34:16] hallelujah and the battle continued you
[1:34:20] read it throughout the book of acts
[1:34:21] prison doors shake devils cast out
[1:34:24] sicknesses were healed lame crippled
[1:34:27] walks again it's the battle going on
[1:34:31] and then it tells us right there how one
[1:34:34] day paul met this woman with a spirit of
[1:34:37] divination
[1:34:38] and she came with the same old trick we
[1:34:41] know you who you are
[1:34:43] you are the servant of the most high god
[1:34:47] oh if you got pride you got all you lack
[1:34:50] any of those virtues you don't have him
[1:34:52] in you
[1:34:53] then you say oh praise god she
[1:34:56] recognized who i am and so on and you
[1:34:59] drop your guard no
[1:35:01] but the bible says paul just left leave
[1:35:04] her and leave her to go on and he's just
[1:35:07] waiting on the spirit
[1:35:10] and on the day that the spirit of god
[1:35:12] spoke to him he called the devil out of
[1:35:15] her
[1:35:16] and she had the spirit of a fight python
[1:35:19] the spirit of the devil a snake spirit a
[1:35:22] serpent demon controlled her and she was
[1:35:26] divining and speaking things from off of
[1:35:29] that spirit
[1:35:31] and they were making money off of that
[1:35:34] right off of that psychic gift that she
[1:35:36] had they were making money right and
[1:35:39] therefore once the devil casts out she
[1:35:42] can't do it no more and they got mad at
[1:35:45] paul
[1:35:46] amen and
[1:35:48] and so the battle continued from the
[1:35:51] first church h messenger
[1:35:54] right through the seven church ages
[1:35:57] it continued right through luther wesley
[1:36:01] right down into pentecost the battle
[1:36:04] between truth and era
[1:36:07] true and false
[1:36:09] the word of god
[1:36:11] versus the lives of satan
[1:36:14] right until this last day
[1:36:17] when the great messenger came on the
[1:36:19] scene
[1:36:21] and you've seen the great battle
[1:36:23] all those healing meetings what do you
[1:36:26] think that was just god showing you that
[1:36:29] he can heal he knows he can heal he
[1:36:31] don't have to prove that to you but the
[1:36:34] battle was now on earth
[1:36:37] and it was raging right in front of you
[1:36:41] that devil bring in the worst cases to
[1:36:43] him
[1:36:45] just like he did to jesus if you if you
[1:36:47] if the son of god come off the cross if
[1:36:50] you disheal yourself if you're that do
[1:36:52] this you bring a dead man let me see if
[1:36:55] he's a real prophet uh bring some blind
[1:36:57] person bring somebody that did something
[1:37:00] way back way back and the prophet will
[1:37:02] just stand there and look at them oh he
[1:37:05] says when you were a child you were
[1:37:07] under a tree i see you looking towards
[1:37:08] the west and you were thinking
[1:37:13] you didn't even talk it
[1:37:15] but i see you
[1:37:16] when you were under that tree the same
[1:37:19] one that tell nathaniel i saw you before
[1:37:22] philip even called you
[1:37:24] i saw you when you were under that fig
[1:37:26] tree
[1:37:27] and when you were telling them boys this
[1:37:29] this this that and tell him what he said
[1:37:31] and here comes a prophet stands again
[1:37:34] and say yeah
[1:37:36] yeah yeah you you
[1:37:37] you were under that tree and you were
[1:37:39] looking towards the west and you were
[1:37:42] thinking
[1:37:44] and there you were thinking this this
[1:37:47] this and at the same time you were
[1:37:49] eating corn
[1:37:52] and you started eating but you ate too
[1:37:54] much and that trouble started right then
[1:37:57] from that time and it just followed you
[1:38:00] to this point and time
[1:38:02] but in the name of jesus christ you're
[1:38:04] healed by the power of god amen
[1:38:07] hallelujah the battle continue
[1:38:11] and the devil bring up every case every
[1:38:14] case theological problems
[1:38:16] you know scriptural problems problems of
[1:38:20] sickness disease trouble death whatever
[1:38:23] it was thousands and thousands of time
[1:38:26] and to prove who it was
[1:38:29] that was in him
[1:38:31] never once wrong
[1:38:34] not one time
[1:38:36] and the voice kept trying to tell them
[1:38:39] this is not william branham
[1:38:41] this is not william branham saying this
[1:38:44] thus
[1:38:46] saith
[1:38:47] the lord
[1:38:49] hallelujah
[1:38:50] they didn't even understand who really
[1:38:52] was speaking
[1:38:54] they they they were thinking that this
[1:38:56] william brother brilliant branham
[1:38:57] standing there and just telling them
[1:38:59] well well you're healed
[1:39:02] or or this or that they didn't realize
[1:39:05] who it was where he sometimes have to
[1:39:07] say well well what did i say
[1:39:10] what did i really say he didn't even
[1:39:12] know because it wasn't him it was god
[1:39:15] speaking through his vessel the spirit
[1:39:18] speaking through the prophet
[1:39:21] defeating the devil at every point that
[1:39:25] he tried to raise his head
[1:39:27] hallelujah and so
[1:39:30] he fought against the devil and his
[1:39:32] hosts
[1:39:34] and all sad to say it
[1:39:37] but he fought
[1:39:38] alone just like jesus had to go to the
[1:39:41] garden of gethsemane and fight alone
[1:39:45] until he dripped with drops of blood
[1:39:48] fighting against the devil in every step
[1:39:51] of the way
[1:39:52] that prophet fought every step of the
[1:39:54] way
[1:39:55] hallelujah he even said i look and see
[1:39:58] my end it's coming hallelujah i have to
[1:40:02] go two of us can't be on the earth at
[1:40:05] the same time
[1:40:07] amen why because it's the coming of
[1:40:09] christ
[1:40:11] oh hallelujah
[1:40:13] oh the mighty angel of the covenant is
[1:40:16] about to come on the scene and two of us
[1:40:19] can't be here at the same time
[1:40:22] i must go i must say decrease
[1:40:25] he might increase hallelujah
[1:40:28] so he fought against the devil until he
[1:40:31] come to the crowning of his ministry
[1:40:35] the crowning time of the opening of the
[1:40:40] seven seals
[1:40:42] hallelujah the greatest privilege that
[1:40:45] mary ever had
[1:40:47] is that god had prophesied she was to be
[1:40:51] the carrier
[1:40:52] of the word
[1:40:55] in her day amen that was the crowning of
[1:40:58] our life until this day she is crowned
[1:41:01] with that honor and that blessing that
[1:41:04] she was chosen to carry the word
[1:41:06] and saw was brother branham's ministry
[1:41:09] crowned that he was the messenger
[1:41:12] promised by the word of god to carry the
[1:41:15] word and to bear the reproach for the
[1:41:18] word in this our day our time and in
[1:41:22] this age
[1:41:25] oh and he carried it boldly
[1:41:28] he carried it without shame without fear
[1:41:31] without fable amen
[1:41:34] my friends
[1:41:36] and he came
[1:41:37] to the crowning time
[1:41:39] when
[1:41:40] he was able to bring forth the seven
[1:41:43] seals
[1:41:44] remember
[1:41:45] mary did not produce christ
[1:41:49] amen
[1:41:52] he christ the word only passed through
[1:41:55] mary
[1:41:57] she was a predestinated
[1:42:00] instrument
[1:42:02] to carry the word of god
[1:42:05] in time for a time
[1:42:08] and then the word came
[1:42:10] to its own manifestation
[1:42:13] and later maturity
[1:42:16] and so was brother branham
[1:42:19] the lamb
[1:42:21] hallelujah when those seals broke we
[1:42:24] were not conscious of it then
[1:42:26] but we should have recognized
[1:42:29] that every night we were given a display
[1:42:33] that not brother branham
[1:42:36] but some
[1:42:37] body was there
[1:42:39] with brother branham and brother branham
[1:42:41] true brother branham supernaturally
[1:42:44] drawing the seven church ages on the
[1:42:46] walls
[1:42:48] showing the end time for the gentile
[1:42:50] church age now also writing on the wall
[1:42:54] that
[1:42:55] it was the lamb
[1:42:58] that broke the seals
[1:43:01] through him
[1:43:03] to the glory of god
[1:43:05] let me repeat
[1:43:06] william
[1:43:08] marian branham
[1:43:10] did not
[1:43:12] and could not of himself break
[1:43:15] open the seven seals
[1:43:19] it is written in the scriptures
[1:43:22] there came a bloody lamb that broke
[1:43:25] those shields hallelujah
[1:43:28] the lamb took the seals and broke it
[1:43:31] and here we see it
[1:43:33] replayed before our human eyes
[1:43:37] how that the lamb
[1:43:39] has broken the seals
[1:43:42] and the last seal
[1:43:44] that was broken
[1:43:46] and is being still being broken
[1:43:49] amen hallelujah because as i have said
[1:43:53] and say to you
[1:43:54] yes
[1:43:55] the seals have been broken publicly for
[1:43:59] everybody can read the books
[1:44:01] right
[1:44:03] hallelujah
[1:44:05] but saying that the seals are broken
[1:44:08] doesn't mean that it's being revealed to
[1:44:10] you
[1:44:13] that we know they're open but is it
[1:44:15] revealed to you
[1:44:18] and then if you claim oh i got the
[1:44:21] revelation
[1:44:22] then it's supposed to know prove and
[1:44:25] identify itself by making itself
[1:44:28] manifested through you
[1:44:32] broken revealed
[1:44:35] and now
[1:44:36] manifested
[1:44:38] it must manifest itself through you
[1:44:41] and that's not something that we can put
[1:44:42] on like a religious cloak
[1:44:45] or satan can go and impersonate and put
[1:44:48] it on
[1:44:49] because the third pull cannot be
[1:44:52] impersonated or copycatted
[1:44:54] because it's god testifying of his gift
[1:44:58] god testifying it's him it's me i'm in
[1:45:02] here i'm here i'm doing this i'm the one
[1:45:05] that's living in there praise god
[1:45:06] hallelujah so we're thankful to god amen
[1:45:10] hallelujah and so
[1:45:13] we are happy now praise the lord for
[1:45:16] this coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:45:19] what is the seventh seal
[1:45:22] it's he said it it's the coming of the
[1:45:24] lord himself
[1:45:27] hallelujah
[1:45:29] this is not the prophet running between
[1:45:32] the lord and the bride carrying the
[1:45:34] message
[1:45:35] no
[1:45:36] but the lord himself
[1:45:39] has descended with a shout
[1:45:43] with the voice using the voice of the
[1:45:45] archangel
[1:45:47] and the trump of god hallelujah amen
[1:45:51] praise god and his seed would be alive
[1:45:54] at this time because the bible already
[1:45:56] promised he shall see with his
[1:45:58] generation amen praise the lord god
[1:46:01] hallelujah amen
[1:46:04] of course the seventh seal you know the
[1:46:07] prophet said i'm starting to wind up now
[1:46:09] hallelujah i can't
[1:46:11] continue
[1:46:12] right now but we will as i told you a
[1:46:15] fourth time that this is going to lead
[1:46:17] from one thing into another thing right
[1:46:20] i'm following the angel
[1:46:22] i'm following the covenant on the angel
[1:46:25] i'm following the spirit of almighty god
[1:46:28] hallelujah praise god satan has taken us
[1:46:32] let me don't go ahead of myself let me
