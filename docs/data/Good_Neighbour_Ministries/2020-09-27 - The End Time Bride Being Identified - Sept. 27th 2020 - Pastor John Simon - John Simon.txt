[Applause] amen amen glory praise be to god god bless every one of you here today the lord bless you real god [Applause] please be seated it's indeed a privilege to be here with you and to see a lot of your familiar faces i haven't seen for a long time and it's good that we can be together again as i said last week not just together here physically but it reminds us that once we were in the mind of god and we were there together and then we daniel said he saw trones cast down upon the earth and so kings and priests of god came down to the earth and because we didn't have our memory or from spiritual amnesia we could not identify ourselves or remember who we are but by the opening of the word of god we started to get back our our thoughts and our mind of who we really were in the mind of god because he took us back to familiar places meeting familiar people that we once knew back to the old school and the old home and we start to remember and that's the reason why we're excited here this morning because we're not only together spiritually in the world worshiping god but we are here together physically as a family as a people of god gathered in his wonderful precious name so i welcome you in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you very much sisters brother glory to god just so that you uh know we do have a water baptism after the service the preaching of the word we'll have a water baptism uh brother cupid's and sister cupid's daughter the sophia is to be baptized in water of her own desire god bless you real god praise god do you have those things for me brother okay praise the lord so we do have uh baptism certificates for those who have been baptized and the one that will be baptized here today uh brother philip the deacon will do the baptism as quickly as uh he can in water in the name of the lord jesus christ and we give him all the glory and you are honored guests to be witnesses to this water baptism that you are able to witness what god has done and what god is actually doing we're glad to see uh sister van rui here praise the lord back from south africa right praise the lord god bless you real good i know you've been back for a time but i'm only seeing you last week and this week for the first time so it's months i haven't seen her and i'm glad that she could be back in the house of the lord and as you know i've been sharing the word of god online and sharing the word of god online is a little different than speaking in the church itself to believers and of course i knew some brothers didn't understand and i believe that i should go out online and just blast everything that we have in the message but it's not like that you're trying to bring other lost ones in and you're trying to introduce them to the message and so you kind of um put it in such a way that believers can hear and if they listen they can hear also praise the lord praise god but we're glad that we could be here in the house of god and see every one of you and to feast upon the uh word of god angels food menace food uh eagles food whatever you want to call it i'm glad that i could be here in the house of god sharing the word of god with you glory to god today uh i would like to share with you the end time bride of christ identified uh praise god let's read the scripture i i'm ready wanting to go into it so let me read the scripture first of all from john chapter 14 verses 19 to 20. i want to thank god for all those who contributed all those who worked all those who did things during the down i mean we're still under it to a certain degree here um but all of you that did whatever it took so that we would be able to have the services today as you could see all the pews are marked and different things have gone into uh practice and we want to thank the lord for that that every one of you are working within those guidelines so that we can come up to whatever standards and beyond whatever government standards they require we are a different kind of people here on a different church because as i said last week the last time we got together here in the house of god they i don't know who it was but right online they were saying a lot of things i mean i was called crazy the people in the church called crazy they're getting church and all this stuff and we're breaking the law and they said the police you might not know that but the police came here and they sat outside in an unmarked car and they did all their counting and watching and everything else and at the end of it they found nothing everything was just absolutely right so they had to go away and and just give their report that everything was fine and so on but i'm saying that so that you can know that even though you don't see anybody you don't hear anybody eyes are upon us all right eyes are on us so let's conduct ourselves uh as as well as we can for the glory of god let us read god's word and then we are going to pray john chapter 14 verses 19 and 20. yet a little while and the world said me no more but ye shall see me because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you praise god god bless you real good for this word father we thank you for the reading of the word we ask now that the holy spirit will cause the word to move and live within our hearts within our lives so go forth to whoever and wherever you wish it to go for your glory and honor amen and amen god bless you please be seated now of course we know that the the catholic church has been putting wedding bands on the fingers of some people that are called nuns and uh they believe that they are the bride of christ and that they were chosen to be the bride of christ and uh there are uh the baptist methodist different ones they believe they are the bride of jesus christ and so they all making these claims that they have the right doctrine and they have the right word the right promise for the day and that they are the genuine bride of jesus christ the message is here the prophet has preached it and the people of this message the ones that truly believe believe that they are called to be the bride of jesus christ but we end with a problem here kind of a confusion here well who really is this bride of jesus christ that the bible talks about uh how can we just say we are the bride of jesus christ so that is the reason why we have this topic here today the end time bride identified because during his first coming jesus said that the world systems would not recognize him amen but true believers would the bible says he was in the world and the world knew him not but there's many hallelujah that believed him knew him praise god to them he began he gave them power to become the sons of god praise the lord hallelujah so we understand therefore that not that when it says become the sons of god you're now be going to become a son of god but we understand that you will recognize that you already wore a son and that is how you can be known as a son during this time now during this time of his second coming uh through the spoken word of the prophet of malachi 4-5 brother william branham we who are seated here today we have recognized by the opening of the word who we are we recognize and we received the word of god within our hearts and that's given us a certainty faith confidence in the recognition of knowing who we are yes indeed we are the supernatural products amen that were produced by the opening of the word of the living god the effect of the word of god upon our lives has transformed us changed us i know when it struck my heart to this very day from glory to glory is changing me for all these years he's been changing me giving me more wisdom more knowledge more understanding of the very word of god and i'm trusting it's the same thing for you today that the word of god is growing you and your understanding is growing and your your whole spirit being is growing so i want to thank god for his word in these marvelous days and times in which we live now we know it produced five supernatural effects within our lives one the creation of the bride hallelujah because remember she was only in spirit form i'm talking about the creation of the brain then the identification of the bride the manifestation of the bride as the son of man in the bright form and the invisible marriage with the bride or uniting time with the bride the oneness of the bride with jesus christ and lastly one of the last effects of the word of god that we have received what it will do is rapture us out of here the rapturing of the bride of jesus christ praise the lord and i believe i'm a part of it now in doing god a service jeffersonville indiana 6-5 page 34 brother branham speaking god has promised who's promised god has promised in his word how he would choose his bride the method by which he will choose his bride now in this last day hallelujah did you know that he promised it now let us first of all let me clarify something here jesus said in the scripture we read as a text that in that day there will know hallelujah praise god now change the word day or to age right it's really age in that age they will know there will be a certain age there's an age promise there's an age prophesied there's an age that's supposed to come in which people will know who they are and recognize who they are and in that day they'll know that i am in the father the father and me and i in you i believe we are in that day right now i believe we're living in this day walking in this day by the power of the holy spirit of the living god now he promised it but how would he do it and he will do it by his original plan of choosing christ hallelujah or not just choosing him but choosing the time or the time he would come or be expressed amen choosing the season hallelujah and now he can't miss it on this bride because she is part of the word he can't choose it by a denomination because he did not choose christ by denomination see oh my did christ come to a denomination did he come by a denomination no praise the lord see they rejected him that's what the denomination's done then then when he chooses the brain he can can he come any other way now how did he bring christ here he brought him here by his spoken word by the word of the prophets that is how he brought him here is that right how will he bring his bride here by the word of the prophets that is how he'll bring them here amen how did he identify christ when he come amen by the word of a prophet hallelujah the spirit of elijah upon a man coming out of the wilderness amen he identified him behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world so will he identify his bride amen by the promised word of malachi 4 that he would restore the faith the revelation that the father's had for faith is a revelation he'll restore that revelation back to the believers so that they will recognize in other words he'll restore back their right mind he'll restore to them the mind of christ so they can recognize who they are and who he is praise god and there could be a supernatural oneness by the holy spirit of the living god hallelujah the same thing that he did in the days of sodom is what he does here again do you believe that praise god hallelujah so we understand friends first of all that god creates by his spoken word in the beginning you know that the book of genesis chapter 1 and so on that everything was created by the word of god hallelujah and so we know that the brain also must be created by the word of god remember that i already told you that you were a soul you were a gene you were an attribute you were a spirit being in god you came down here but you have to have a body created that you could live in praise the lord and you come here and you are created together now we talk about that body and then we're talking about the body of christ then we all come together now physically we all look like we're separate seated here distance and all like that but because of the the revelation of the word of god it brings you back into a oneness not only of thought but the oneness of being you're actually one just as much but when god separated eve from adam the bible still said that he called their name adam yet they had their individual names adam eve but when he saw them when they were together he just called them the bible says adam so they had one name and even though we are thousands and thousands of real believers yet we are called christians we are called the brain because we all are baptized in his name we believe in his name we pray in his name we carry his name because there is only one name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ and that is the reason why we are one with him for the two who have become one flesh praise god hallelujah praise god so the bride created by the spoken word you can uh also get that out of the hebrews i believe it is chapter 11 by faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of god and there was nothing made that was not made except by the word of god hallelujah everything is by the word of god so the reason why you're here you heard first of all the word of a prophet and the word of the prophet attracted your attention hallelujah and so you the prophet said did you just walk in here just like that he said do you really think that he says no you did not just walk in here or stumbling here like that you were ordained to hear this hallelujah and that's the reason why you are here today praise god hallelujah other people hear the same thing and they run for cover you heard it and instead of running away from it you run into it oh what a difference to the true child of god the true sons and daughters of the living god that run into the very presence of the lord now you remember how isaiah stood up and said behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son hallelujah praise god remember isaiah was a prophet and once he spoke the word that word has to come to pass hallelujah so jesus christ was brought here based on the word of a prophet many prophets but i'm using isaiah because the prophecies of jesus christ coming come down through the entire bible from the very beginning genesis 3 18 right but i'm just highlighting isaiah that he said a virgin will conceive and bear a son and his name shall be called jesus hallelujah so the word of god in the moat of a prophet brought jesus christ on the scene hallelujah and the word of god in the mouth of a prophet in our day is prophesied to bring a bride upon the scene praise the lord hallelujah glory to god you'll find backgrounding for that in doing god's service without doing his will page 34 there praise the lord hallelujah amen so friends we understand now the reason for god sending brother branham on the scene the purpose and reason for a 20th century prophet it's not to just show off a man or say oh he's a prophet or oh i believe brother branham that's just what he is but the prophet was sent on the scene that god could have a vessel like he did in the time of israel when he came down on the mountain and he began to speak they were so scared and not only were they so scared just by being on that mountain any animal or person went and touched that mountain the bible said they died and so they got god said to moses okay i i won't come down on the mountain anymore i i'm going to use you as a prophet hallelujah and i'm going to speak through you so they can see somebody like themselves but it won't be that person it will really be me because in those moments when ice begins to speak through that person thus saith the lord that won't be the man that will be me and i'll speak through him and they lord me because every word i speak through him will come to pass every word i speak through him is going to create things and it will come to pass and so we understand brother branham was a predestinated vessel to be here in this age so that when god wanted to fulfill that prophecy of malachi 4 5 of uh joel 2 or he wanted to fulfill uh revelation 3 and so on and other scriptures he had a vessel already predestinated and placed on the earth that he could come to and use to manifest himself through hallelujah now that is why when brother branham went and he spoke the word and uh you know let there be a squirrel and there was a squirrel on a branch and he says no i'm imagining well speak again and see what's going to happen if it's just imagination or it's real so he said let there be another there's a squirrel so he got more confidence let there be and he spoke about i think it's five of them anyway he spoke them all into existence hallelujah of course god revealed to him what that was god was revealing to him now this is the third pull and this is not going to be just you talking to the people under the first and second pull healing and miracles just to attract their attention but i'm gonna be here now to talk through you directly to my own bride okay and uh and and so i'm gonna pull them by the opening of the word i'm going to pull them in by the opening of the word so therefore god began to use brother branham and he goes to sister hattie wright is that right yes how many knows her name hati right amen and he said you know the other day sister hattie and he told her tells her what happened and everything else she said what do you think about that and she said oh that's absolutely right brother branham hattie wright said he was right and right away she got the right birth and she got the right birth for her sons praise god hallelujah and so brothers what brother branham i won't go into the fact that he spoke about the resurrection of the fish when he gives the life to the fish and receive your life on the fish that was dead came to life again it was god in him illustrating this is not just a man it's not just the word of a man now i'm not saying brother branham wasn't a man he was a man but the being that started to operate through him at that point in time was not just brother branham it was god himself and so uh praise the lord he says oh what do you think she said well that's right but she you see she was more right than she thought because what he was showing to her that is how he's going to be creating his brain by the message the spoken word being revealed through a prophet and making himself known so this bride this group this little flock what brings her together we don't even know each other we come from different parts of the world different races different cultures different standards and status and everything else we would have never met or known each other except by the supernatural hand of god so we are brought here today as a manifestation of the word of god and the will and purpose of god we are here in the plan of god we are here in the day and the time the age the season in which he promised by his word that we would be here and it seems so simple that we can take it for ordinary but you are not here by chance you are here by thus saith the lord hallelujah you're here by the word of the living god hallelujah praise god hallelujah thank god so by the prophet coming and bringing the message of the hour he was bringing the end time pride on the scene bringing her hallelujah and just as the prophet spoke of him they spoke of us because jewel chapter 2 i will restore for you to restore you got to already have something and it got away from you or it fall away or went somewhere and then you're going to restore it back to where it was if something was lost it mean you once had it and then you lost it and now you're trying to get it back but we were lost but now we are found by the grace of god we have found hallelujah [Applause] the holy spirit has haunted us the great eagle flew across the entire world of billions of people and in the billions of people one in a million praise god he found you he found you he found you every one of you he found you by the grace of god that is the reason why you're here today hallelujah no brother simon but i still make mistakes you see that's the catholic view that they put out in the world that you got to be a physically outwardly perfect person before you can be called a saint but in the bible we find that paul constantly calling those believers saints is that right and then he goes to another chapter and he says how come you got wars and fightings amongst you how come you guys are arguing with one another how come when himself and barnabas and the other one had to go on a missionary trip and he said why don't you take mark with you he says no i don't want to take him with me as a troublemaker and the bible says that they got to such physical struggle those two apostles almost physically came against one another that's why paul said yeah we are christians we can be angry but sin not it's not that you can't be angry you don't have to go wrong as an actor now trying to give a outward view that you are a real christian so you don't get angry you always got to have patience you show the same virtues of love and broadly kindness and we ought to show it but not naturally trying to show it not naturally trying to put it on you just relax let the holy spirit show it through you let him relax let him manifest his self through you amen praise the lord if i if i don't agree with you with something you're doing i said well brother i don't like that i don't think that's that's exactly right praise god there's nothing wrong with that praise the lord hallelujah and we allow the holy spirit to have his way but we are not here to be religious actors we are not in general hospital we are not in one of these shows that you have on tv we are in the greatest drama of redemption praise god hallelujah the love of christ for his bride oh he loved her from before the foundation of the world and he loved our entire truth the entire time and he still loves her today and is that is why he died for our sins to redeem us back to him praise the lord just like the little boy who lost his boat and he bought it from the pawn shop went to sail it and some contrary wind got a hold of it and took it away and he lost it somebody got a hold of it brought the boat and sold it into the pawn shop for them to be able to make a profit off of it and as he was going by one day he noticed his boat in the pawn shop it is his boss but he still has to go and buy the boat he still has to pay the price for the boat he still has to pay the redemption price for the boat and so he went into the shop sold enough newspapers got his little money together praised god forevermore hallelujah and there he took his money and went and bought that boat when the owner gave him that little boat he took the boat clutched this to his little breast and said now you're mine but now you are twice mine you must be born again i said you must be born again born by the holy spirit you belong to him but yet because you were lost he had to pay the redemption price to bring you back unto himself aren't you happy this morning aren't you glad that you belong to him hallelujah jesus said john 10 16 are the sheep i have that are not of this fold praise god them also i must bring glory to god hallelujah paul said we are better grafted in branch israel the jewish people they are the true vine and we are a grafted-in branch we have life by the same god the same jehovah we receive life praise god hallelujah and luke spoke how that god in the book of acts would call out of the gentiles a people that he would marry a people for his name he would have a people that would take on his name glory to god all these are prophecies of the coming of the bride he expected to have a brain and then we find in revelation john on the isle of patmos revelation 3 14-22 revelation 19 1-9 and revelation 21 1 to 9 you will find uh john speaking of this brain he said and i heard a noise as it were of thunder amen and a rumbling and a thundering like the voice of many waters and i looked and when i looked i saw thousands yet thousands upon ten thousands numberless hallelujah oh and a voice from the temple crying out hallelujah the marriage of the lamb has come and all his wife has made herself ready glory to god hallelujah oh praise god forevermore brother sister all the billions millions of people that are the believers of this world wherever they are whether dead or alive they're crying out worthy is the lamb that was lame worthy is the lamb that was slain praise be the god and their voices going forth like thunder and lightning in this day and in this hour how happy to be that we are a part of this so various prophets speak in the word bringing forth a bride out of god's word remember i said out of god's word just as much as eve out of adam praise the lord and then when she got herself messed up with the serpent and as we could say lost her way then god had to bring her back hallelujah bring her back to adam's side this is the hour when we are all being brought back to his side to fit back to that place where we are supposed to be because as his great masterpiece was struck and a part of it broke off and was lost in time so he has to come back in time by his grace find that missing piece all praise god and fit it right back where it comes from but hallelujah during that time satan tried to make all kinds of counterfeit and copycats but you know when something breaks off you can't break it off with a certain special pattern and so when you take that and try to fit it back that in itself is a mystery and when you take it and fill it back only that piece that was broken off could really fit back into that spot praise god you remember the chinese tag how the chinese i can remember that way back praise god when they would just tear a piece of paper because at that time they came over they couldn't speak english it was just chinese and the only way they could identify a person's clothing is to tear a tag and each tag is torn a certain way and you can't bring a fake and try to fit it it's not going to fit only the genuine real one that was torn a certain way and a pattern a certain way is going to fit the other one so down with the impersonators down with the copycats down with the actors down with all of those who try to make up something and call themselves that it will not fit it would fit because the holy spirit himself being the other half when the thing comes together oh praise god that deep crawls to the deep and the deep must respond because the two are one praise god hallelujah amen and then we find out friends that when we heard this word of god it sounded so familiar to us even though we never heard it before but something in the deep of you that fits me that's exactly the truth that's right listen the first time i heard anything about the serpent seed i didn't even understand it but something in here tell me that's right when i heard about one god not three because i mean i i was in the uh bible uh college and you know you hear all humor suicide the greek for this and the oneness of god of one substance and so on so on my goodness and then all at once you heard hero israel the lord thy god is one lord and when did god change his mind about that where does he say that anywhere in the bible he changed his mind that i'm no more one i am now three i don't think one is a good number so i need to be break myself up in the tree no it's the same one god but he has offices i'm a father i'm a son and i'm a pastor it doesn't make me treat people i'm the same person but i'm in three offices it's the same way god came as his own son in other words he created the body that he could go into it that's why he said the father that dwells in me he does the works amen god in christ christ in the church the kingdom of god being restored back hallelujah amen that's the reason why we are gutted here together in his mighty name praise god hallelujah so we say we can say friends that the elijah spirit of malachi 4 5 was one of those prophetic beings that was sent down here that would have a message that would call out the bride out of the masses he would call out the bride chose her called her amen and then by the spoken word reconstitute restore recreate the body of christ again in bright form the son of man being revealed in this day and in this hour oh praise god forevermore hallelujah and then i look and i see myself in there and realize that in our day we have seen a new creation my father worked hitherto natural creation and now i work spiritual supernatural creation by the spoken word of the living god hallelujah can you say it in your creation hallelujah by god's spoken word say it again i'm a new creation my god-spoken word i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man old things have passed away i am born again more than a conqueror that's what i am i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man hallelujah that's wonderful but that's not all that the spoken word does hallelujah praise god and what it does of course is wonderful marvelous and it's also thrilling the spoken word creates the bride but it identifies the bride of who she is now remember it's not whether or not you or i say i'm in the bride i'm a christian i am this i'm not you can say whatever you want but the bible tells us that when there was a dispute between cain and abel the bible says god answered abel by setting his sacrifice on fire the bible says nadia about testifying but god testified of his gifts praise the lord now god will testify of his gift to you because unto you he gave what the gift of eternal life you have received the greatest gift which is the gift of eternal life and god will testify that the life that is in you i gave that life that is supernatural life that is not church life that is not religious life that is not theological life that is not a religious science life that is my life my original life eternal life that is a part of me there is nothing eternal there's only one eternal and i give up part of myself in you and i'm gonna testify of my life that is in you praise god oh the spoken word identifies the bride of christ [Applause] hallelujah praise god amen now jesus was spoken of by the prophets manifested by the word of the prophets but when he got here even though he knew who he was to the people around about the masses of israel they didn't know who he was so he was unidentified he was the bible says he was amongst them and they knew him not and now it's come down to his bride that she in the world she looks like everybody else he looked like everybody else he was just a man and he was and we are and we're not special better than anybody else but it's something that is in us and we didn't choose it he chose us i don't know why he would choose me i may use the words i think like me but but he chose me and he lives in me and i want to thank god for that choosing and that he lives inside of me but here we find out that jesus was in the world the unrecognized presence of god in the world the unrecognized presence of almighty god and so is the true child of the living god when god takes a whole of their soul that they become the unrecognized presence of almighty god because they make mistakes like anybody else's stumble they go through trials they pressure there's nothing different to you than anybody else praise god but there's something inside of you that's what makes you different it's not by your long prayers or you're much praying or the big bible at your arm or going around all the claims you can make you can say whatever you want but if he says you are then you are how could i be i'm making this mistake i'm doing that i don't even feel like i am or whatever that's fine that's you but he says you are and i believe you are who god says you are [Applause] you are who god says you are not who you think you are who you feel you are then you're going by feelings you're going by your own thoughts you're going by this you're going by that you're being swayed but there's one god and his word doesn't change amen hallelujah so here unknown unrecognized walking through this world to the people around about him what are you talking about i know you aren't you jesus the carpenter's son i mean i know your mother mary i know your brothers joses and and so on i know them so so what is this you're claiming now how could you be messiah how could you be so and so because i know you praise god isn't that the same thing today i know you i even saw when you made a mistake bill huh i saw when you made a mistake i said i heard you when you said this or said that that's fine you're seeing all that you're hearing all that and you could say all that but oh not of my will but of his choosing his election that he elected us hallelujah he was absolutely the sun the body the vessel that god was using in that day but he was yet unidentified hallelujah but it was most essential that he be identified that he was the one that the prophets were speaking of during all this time and it's essential that we be identified as the one spoken of in revelation 3 revelation 21 so on so on all praise god we must be identified by the great holy spirit now how was jesus identified he was identified by the word of a prophet and that prophet happened to be john the baptist you'll know the story how john when he reached i believe it was around nine years old or something like that he felt the moving of the spirit of god upon him left his home left his parents and everything else he thought he was a mad man went into the wilderness and if you ever saw the wilderness in the middle east there is no trees hardly there is nothing there's no grass you can hardly find water and all this stuff and snakes and scorpions and everything else and like that and he wandered away and went in the wilderness and literally grew up there in the wilderness amongst all of these wild beasts and wild animals and all he knew was the voice of god you see god took him away from all those rabbinical schools all those educated talks nothing's wrong with wisdom education or anything like that but i'm saying god him to be a prophet his mind could not be contaminated with men's thoughts men's ideas men's direction of looking at things he had to have a pure clean mind and so god took him away from everything so that he would only see and hear god's voice and god's point of view so that when he began to speak he would speak things as how god saw it not as he saw it but as god saw it amen so praise god so then we see that he jesus had to be identified and the bride must be identified praise god hallelujah now this man john with the spirit of elijah upon him and god used him in a mighty way until one day when jesus was coming down by the river praise god i'm going to wind things up in another 5-10 minutes then he looked on him and he pointed him out this is not the identification of jesus christ behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world the same man that you thought was ordinary the same guy that you felt was your schoolmate and all this oh no there's something upon him that's anointing him that makes him different amen and so god used john at that time well what i'm saying is that god promised according to malachi 4 5 that in the last day this last day that jesus spoke of in our text the last age or season he would send a prophet to the gentiles remember all the prophets were jews but he was going to call out the gentile people for his name and so he was obligated to send at least one gentile prophet and that is why i believe and teach william marion branham is that prophet that fulfilled malachi 4 5. and god sent him on the scene to speak his word and to create a bride and to identify a bride i didn't make it plain to you but just as he spoke with squirrels into existence that was just to illustrate how that his word his message would eventually create a bride we were the squirrels were just a type or symbol of us being created by the spoken word and so here we are by the spoken word of the living god hallelujah amen so jesus christ was identified by the spoken word of god in an anointed man of the living god hallelujah now praise god hallelujah oh my i tell you how wonderful it is to know that he's the same yesterday today and forever glory to god i believe i'm going to stop here now i know it's kind of sharp and short but i just feel that i need to stop at this particular point and for us to begin to prepare ourselves for this water baptism that we are going to have here is that okay with you remember i can always continue uh next week or something uh like that with the word of god that we have here and we want to thank god for this young person and it's beautiful this did not happen during a time while there in the church where somebody can say well your influence as the preacher you influence the young person or or something like that but this is when these young people were away they were not in the church and it's not like their parents preaching to them they must have been thinking of what they were hearing and reading listening and they come to a conclusion themselves so it's a personal decision personal choice that they have made to uh commit themselves and save you jesus christ and i want to get let's give them a hand not just her but them all of those that give their lives to jesus christ and were baptized in this name god bless every one of you [Applause] i want to thank god that brother philip is getting ready too right okay praise the lord i i just want to thank god brother mike could you maybe come back up here uh lean a few songs uh prepare the atmosphere um for these here uh let's try to creep keep it crisp and sharp and uh and short and detailed right to the timing so that we can be out of here as we propose okay praise the lord so i want to thank god for all of them and so sophia comes today by god's grace to be baptized in water and in this day when young people are bearing the brunt of all of the pressures of our age whether it's social psychological cultural whatever governmental economic and so on all these pressures are coming upon them and i tell you it's the pressure they have to bear is more than we ever had we thought we had pressure and we did but it's nothing to compare with what they have to bear now so let me say this let's do all we can to help them do i have an amen over here praise the lord let's do all we can to help them i mean i can go on speaking we know of course some of them just drop all their weight on you so well you brought me here you have to take care of me right and they're others with other excuses but it doesn't matter the fact is they're carrying more than we ever had to carry and they do a lot of foolish things unwise things sometimes that's part of learning to walk right you don't go and whip your child or come against your child because the baby is now trying to walk and it fell down it's trying to talk and it misplaced the words no failure is just a part of success and it's just a part of growing so therefore let's help them do as much as we can for them that they might be able to grow and walk as mature persons for the glory of god okay brother this is brother phillip bobbier and he will be doing the baptism this is sofia there's a dad over there [Music] who wants to make sure he has the picture of his daughter being baptized in water it's over to you now brother philip you can speak louder [Music] [Music] i believe the greatest thing that could ever happen to anyone and so far which means wisdom i believe made the right choice today and before i go ahead and we all know that baptism does not save it's time that she's doing today outwardly for people to see what has already taken place in the inside it is um it is there something that has once she has made this thing something great has taken place in the inside of her and she's projecting for the whole world to see it and you're all witness of what is gonna take place today without wasting much time my rate from [Music] in acts chapter 2 verses 37 and 38 now when they heard this they were prayed in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and all that are far off even as many as the lord and god shall call amen i believe this was not done only for that time it was [Music] own foreign and do you promise to renounce it and all these activities in your life okay so i'm just gonna pray then i'll baptize you oh hydration we thank you for a life of our precious sister the lord you have touched a heart and this has taken place before the foundation of the world but she's just demonstrating what has taken place but i pray that lord that she's gonna go inside the water may you fill hell with your true shining holy ghost because you gave a promise that when you repent and baptize you fearless with yourself i tell god that your spirit will incarnate her soul has spread every fiber of hey let it be your holy ghost protect you in this wicked age let your angels and camera let every steps it takes be your step
