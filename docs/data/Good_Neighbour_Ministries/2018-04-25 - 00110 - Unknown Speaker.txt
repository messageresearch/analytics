resource water water is the secret of a full spiritual experience John 7:37 it is often the symbol of the word of God and the Holy Spirit the word and the spirit know of God the hand and glove the word activates the spirit and the word only works or the Spirit of God is activated and John 6:63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you are spirit and life hallelujah we are on that journey amen becoming more like Jesus every way possible deeper is that bird that finds our desire for each person going a little deeper pushing out into the deep waters get the way from the north we have a deep spiritual hunger that resides in us and is calling out to God responding to God's call to those deeper the deep waters of God's Spirit is calling us to fill the deep places in our hearts brother Branham talked about the doors of your heart open up so many doors open up every door amen he wants full preeminence as we've been hearing he wants total control he wants total possession open up everything and how can you open up you open up as these shots you open up all your required this morning is whatever showing you do it obedience is better than sacrifice sometimes we fast and pray we come to church we do all the things of works and we do not open the doors we do nothing but in our hearts where we've shown us beginning and that's racist will be the better side place what good is all what good is love your works with another vain God oh that's a fearful thing it's not a fearful thing that a preacher prostitute and speak in God speaking to you that's the water beautiful thing not when you're not typical being the boss at work will be this or believe that when you're not obeying box they're conscious there's a witness we respond with our prayers our spiritual hunger that drives us to the Word of God worship there's a place in our worship where the waves of God's presence can come upon us again and again until we find ourselves in the deep waters and whatever we found ourselves with deep waters this morning if you might open to the deepest water than your worship to God you know that's all we really can do when God gives us when God sisters free gives us spinning he gives us delivers all we can do is really work worship is a pathway to deeper waters the presence of God reveals as we worship is like the relationship with Jesus Christ you know those life-giving worship we are willing we are thirsty we are pushed out from the shorelines determined and of deeper go deeper I will push the paths of my personal goods by distractions all those waves angled into the deep waters of God's presence with my breakfast for my worship with open expecting God villains brother shorelines this word we let the angle deep we might be knee-deep waste even those are losses the cecum 47 God's telling the prophet of all waving up into the deep spiritual waters of a spirit filled life can I ask you a question today are you afraid to wade into the deep because you think that God may require of you more honesty is one of the greatest greatest things that we can in our honesty request for anything honest one with the good I mean I got to a place where I don't myself I saw the end that's good I bring all that is what I don't know myself I don't like nobody to me go look at me go away you look at a man crying in a corner cry out to God for help that's how that's what I am but there's a God amen there's a God I put a seed put an answer you put a part of the self in you that's why I look to do you reason that if you don't commit your work fully than you won't be found give me a failing see if you saw that vision of the river as spring forth on God's throne and that river represents the power of the Holy Spirit there are a few truths here this is what I want to get into just a bulky one quickly I was the deeper depths on a relationship was God this passage talks about four stages of the flow of this river that takes us further steps and deeper our relationship with Christ and growth each time and the book to be more like Christ every purpose on the grounds of God's Word that was promised in the Bible that quickening power has given them to quicken that promise to them and when Jesus died he redeemed that back to them us the graves that belongs to the sons and daughters of God he demonstrated what God was how they're going to socialize that and put it into an organization we have no rights to do that it's the Holy Spirit today hunted on his heart that would believe the message everything in the Bible that was promised for that believer when you accept it in its fullness and the rose that you do he gives you the abstraction that when you accept it in its fullness and only God knows if you do you can't see you do and then you wonder why you're like the road you're walking going things ain't changing and you're not becoming like Christ because God knows that you're not accepting Vilnius accepted enough oldest is more than what we think and just believe it has left doors died out his commitment his Lord snow to the deep he gives you the abstract that and then they're promised that his name is in your possession and the Holy Spirit is there to quicken that to you know what kind of people should we be God's intention when he spoke the Word of God was that he may become materialized just like in the beginning he had an intention when he spoke the word the book in the book of Genesis let there be none to be better beat and her rods and there was and there was when he spoke of a ride let there be not to be that be dressed let there be a door letter be delivered letter be set free and there will be and there will be rest I don't know boom but there will be a bracket and door and his righteousness isaiah 55:11 so shall my word go forth out of my mouth and the shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish which i please and it shall prosper where goals we hear this let me tell you that word that blows out of his mouth that was born out of the mouth of the Pikeville ministry mmm that's the word because we have accomplished that part of accepted will accomplish that Burnham accepted shall prosper and where it goes is going right here because I accept it that's where it's going hey man we have an expressed image of the invisible God of his life what a revelation because we realized that pleasure then it brings forth life the Old Testament times in the taco taco which the Jewish people worship and pray constantly there were three main parts the outer Court the inner court and the most holy place which is the Holies of Holies but only the high priest could go behind that bear separated into intercourse or the holy holy series this was the place where the presence of God manifested in order to qualify for the privileges of meeting with God the priests have to undergo certain rituals and purifications and dressed a certain way act a certain way in a certain way to talk a certain way today they are all like to be and gods present not on the basis of rituals or traditions but the bases are not our righteousness in Christ we are called to that intimate fellowship with God related to him through prayer is our birthright as adoptions of sons of the Father elaborate bullet beyond the veil communing with God in his deepest levels that we'd be transformed you see back in the Old Testament that place of the Holies of Holies nobody can go in there just the priest was he here and go in there he had the dress he had to go through so many things and he could when he went in that place he still couldn't look upon the face of God he couldn't take it a smoke interract incident had to cover his face his eyes that's a holding on us and he had to go in there with a blood sacrifice of and the sprinkled on the mercy seat and he introduced and that did one person one priest go in there make the sacrifice all the sins of the people Jesus Christ on the cross when he died it was like a token now we come to that place with God and relationship with him but do you think this is toward the church you think is just keeping just believing God's an experience experience the deeper and deeper and deeper into that place with God give never satisfy your hunger and thirst thing all the way from the Living God for our fabulous Krypton and as you're peeking through and more and more because of my you have a willing heart a light that is Fredrik barbar you think God's gonna open up the boys here end episode have you know that their heart is not really belong the shorter their own comfort zone no but he knows he knows who this world he knows your thoughts that you're thinking right now he knows where you are good luck he knows your desires that you have [Music] the designers in here you can you fool can you say that you're sincere you're not can you say lots of you're not can you say all these things new compiler fun trying to be gonna put in front front of you but I've got not coming I tell you where the people is this is a simple message when people begin to a place in their hearts of the day they're honest before God my god your sins honest before God that something will take place Amen hallelujah the more even parts His grace the power of the working of the Lord in you you spirits the more the outer men will reflect his glory that's when his power will release through you the one problem we have in the message today is this too many believers talk about living behind the veil without even going away means too many preachers I expose myself you preach the gospel is best talk about the kind of available does it bring up you know the ability of knowledge because you can behind the veil to preach the gospel is human knowledge or you can preach this message to put it together those servants together occasionally denies people that are well educated at the bestest togetherness but you can behind the veil abrasive processes in your life like literally when you speak We Need to Talk testify business because behind that veil was kind of glorious you bring that into your life you are going to be walking there talking every decision that you can make everything that flows through you is godly is no Holies of Holies reflective your life that's what's lacking that's what changes people when God's Spirit is release a lot worse about you desire University of spirit and in truth not just truth about this knowledge of the truth but a spirit and in truth people are are sincere people are honest people aren't generally seeking God and what meet with God and what he changed but there has to be a person there has to be a minister be somebody that knows it that could bring God see that bring brother Chen for the Simon for the jack bring God draw yeah they're come like I said at the beginning we needed happen to come not me not you we need him to come our hunger their thirst before him I'm a characters and has a full of people here exported that are really desired for him to come I hope there's more than a handful but I'm John and not everybody desires for him to come because when he comes it changes everything you know how much have to do why behind the video it's not a one-time event it's an experience it's a lifestyle after you entered that lifestyle of intercession and prayer you live in that place living behind the veil is a supernatural lifestyle this means that whatever occurs in your life from that point on is the results of decisions you make that originate from the heart of God not your flesh every choice every decision every where your leg this is conducted controlled by that place that secret place where God speaks to you my glorious place they map yes it's not just my conviction of my heart Saints as I can feel my conviction of my heart is I just sell us the week on the pinky for things that he showed me to miss Ellison and I see it in such a way and I break it in such a way that it's real I don't put it in such a way that working all like flowers and you know all you know lightly lightly I see too many things being increased lightly enlightening people beloved brushes off though I don't see it that way every time God's peace the mountain rumbles the heart travels that's my experience I can only be that's all I can be now well this process is beyond the veil your spirit becomes more light than you dreamed possible it responds to the Creator it depends on the heights our unsearchable the heights your life is changed forever yet it is being changed that's the experience that you get my life has changed forever it's never the same that's why when I speak faith even though I'm strong with certain things in life left right and I need to overcome certain things like words are different I speak different life because my life it takes but at the same time this morning [Music] hallelujah you begun beginning to understand in a small way what deep the Psalms was that fella said when he wrote you hide you shall hide me and that secret place on your presence for the plot submit with the plots of flesh plots of this world pause even where all my ideas were all thinking you come to understand the difference between your cartr thinking and God's thinking you do you come to realize them when certain things always bump up Satan always tries to bring the urgency Saeko strives to bring something that gets you you know your anxiety level up or whatever company and he finished he sits in that car go by the populations looking at all the circumstances around you he starts burning fever he starts burning all these things and if he wants you to speak wants you to make a decision based on that I can begin to a place where you can control that you can get to a place understand your surroundings understand this is deceitful age understanding your flesh understand your weaknesses they need to say be still and not speak things not do things that happens on your flesh flesh profiteth nothing what brings you more battle scars it means total protection sickness is not allowed there fear all these things are not allowed there in that place the enemy of God Satan cannot enter there the understand cannot enter there that's a secret place for you and God you have paid the price you have died out enough you've gone to that place with God in your experience and only God and you were there why do I say that in the way it is because things no matter what things come into your life no matter what battles you get other words you get what things that may attack you it's you and God and God alone he does not touch that place he can never touch that person that's what God wants us to live out of that place was is to speak out of that place he wants us to make our choices and our decisions and everything that that that comes upon our lives out of that place but if I believe you cannot wait to return where you just begun your Spears of t see what it's like to be in that heavenly throne room the cost of moving into the Holies of all these few humans ever entered and the Holies of Holies spiritually speaking why why the price is simply more that most people are willing to pay you know for the psycho who says that a pension cost is plenty costs it is it is I cry out every single day because this or more deeper more deeper I get right the more there splashbacks up just think of it as we get into this a little bit here to go all this direction the Lord's gonna have us going but think of the prescription we read today when you heard ankle deep water it's not all that time to be negative when you're ankle deep water you know it's up to your ankles you've got a control system there's no resistance there's no straining you can walk never where you walk one get out of the water you can get out of the quick when I guess the ad is a little bit more uncomfortable you start feeling that that get to that place where goal control starting to lose a little bit of control a little bit longer you know then it gets up to your waist a little bit more you know when he gets up to your waist it starts getting that deep you know that yer possible because over for you [Music] just like the inner court you come in it cleanses you you repent of your sins it starts dealing with little things in your life you wanted a day out of court you start studying the Word of God are ruining the Word of God the Word of us are speaking to you more leading you into a deeper life what is pulling on you is pulling on that seat of God inside of you because there's a veil that has to be read in your life there's a bad line your heart that has to be ripped there's a seat of God behind that veil of the Spirit and you have to go behind that with inside yourself your experience with God and that transition with the Word of God speaking to you drawing me and asking you to give up and die out that's where it comes up to the waist it comes up [Music] [Music] but that is the greatest place for our you believer to get to because my you surrender to that goal and you know that he's faithful he's true promise that he spoke evil feeling like place so many people walk into these stages and these stages they stay a little deeper there they speaker sit on the church needy waist-deep never go all the way [Music] earth the usually takes the stress to bring the best out of the man God gets you down when you possibly many times get to yourself in a position to get yourself out of the way I think David got to these places when you begin to meditate over the Lord I begin to think of other things when you say when a time God puts us in tight corners where we look up many times he gets us on our backs in the hospital or our bed cellars so we can look up with great lessons but not comfortable the word thirst I was looking in the dictionary looking up this word Oh they descended by statute I believe were precious to meet life then when I was looking up I was thinking about the waters I looked up at the dictionary to see what it means and the Webster dictionary says have some painful desire a painful side I wonder if he came into the house of God today to worship the Lord painful as I know him when you want something so bad until he comes to painful autumn ties be one things so bad we want to be rich we want to be multimillionaires we want all the material things of this life we want all these things so bad this painting to us you want this nap but never this is a thirst of God with hunger for God is wheeled around life's become painful let me tell you when it does when it does then you can experience change it's none of the natural thing he's talking about here to thirst is a god-given thing every one of us that's why you see different religions different cults different clans tribes up there they've all have something inside them to worship even them up there they haven't worship the car they worship their their their wives they worship money they are small it's not a lot a natural thing to thirst you have this morning eight seven one of you have it inside of you to thirst after the Living God is David as brother Brandon did well different it's just your choice is where you choose to be you surrendered amen see David wasn't searching for his stomach Oh God or something that happened years ago but for the Living God the ever-present daughters his soul thirsteth for that God now we find God gives the control tower to you in you gives you the things that you have Nina now the control tower and you is what directs you and this thirst runs in on this control tower and tells you what you have Nina of spiritual speaking things there is a control tower in the body that tells you what you have Nina in your natural body and it brings it to you now first brings it to you you have got the trick it tells you you do it and also the control tower in the soul that tells you things that you have Nina something in your spirit and you can tell on what kind of light is controlling you and what kind of thirst that is fulfill it in your life when you can see what your desires are then you can tell by what kind of something that is in you that's creating this desire that you have you see it's creating a side of you by your choices in your decision by that control tower is how the leakage of the flesh are leading to you to the spirit to somebody who's walking behind that veil and walking with the Lord and that control tower is controlled by the Holy Ghost that's where brother have said you if you come up to somebody you talk to them for five minutes you can tell if they got the whole thing most of them what's the Holy Ghost holy Moses people still believe in this message of some experience of some finer qualities and evidence said on the screen that no it's the revelation of God inside of you controlling you controlling your thoughts controlling your desires controlling the trustus everything about you it's slowly possess me yes you're not what you used to be you're not where you want to be like that but you're certainly not what used to be not there and you're not what you want to be what you're changing but you've been changed my the things of God takes the mind I've got to understand them I don't to some of you but this might take men there's a certain thing in you thirst and Ferb it can tell me you can tell in your soul what your desire is by the nature of the thirst is inside of you there's a control tower in the soul and what in the body these tower is warning the caller for the needs of the other these calls to the needs of the caller and it sent up waiting a warning for instance the flesh versus the satisfies desires that was in the body and the spirit the things that are in the soul many times these war one against another you know the scripture says when I do good evil as president do you realize that these war has one another in this battle and so many times like feel open I feel we should do this or I feel should go here do this not realize that a lot of times instead of checking with the word and after waiting a lot of God speak to you is your clutch pocket is the choices under the car like you were led away by the desires of your flesh so you get to see me and tell me who God is not with nobody's it's a flesh and he controls with flesh he tries to manipulate the flesh he tries to dictate the flesh then he come to even said thou shalt surely not die he will die you listen to him you listened and disobeyed this Word of God you will die but this frog will not be deceived like he was she'll take every word of God because it's God himself he's alive Satan and he still hired this morning and he's lying and trying to lie to each and every one of us [Music] oh we skip over some things here swingers is where you are so deep with God that your feet can't touch the ground this is where faith and works you have faith in what God has done and is doing and will do but now jihad work I swing it you see that your works swingers move cops how they feel and worship anyways wow that's a big thing otherwise coming and I didn't I didn't erase it you know we talk about deep things in the Word of God what is worship worship Aaron worships is everything whether would God revealed himself and God showed himself any time in the Bible what what God did anything what was after worship worship you see how you feel you worship anyways water if we felt certain ways and you know let's we didn't feel certain ways we do have battles when we come in here we do go through things right horrible in this fight in this battle and we feel certain things but were you able to put it aside to worship that's your victory swimmers who paths how they look to mothers and take a stand for righteousness we've come in here looking at this one looking at that moment look at this one sins that one sins not behind the veil experience you don't go to those places because you know it's all of God that you see the eyes of God in that place swipers whoop-ass they want to fulfill God's commence to reach everyone everywhere with the message of Christ swimmers are survivors other batter says they have a pact with real Christians have a backdoor oh that's a tough that's a tough to be really tough sometimes we get offended sometimes somebody says something wrong about us and we get all covered up we get all you know upset otherwise - listen when the Prophet would somebody just up to the Prophet a brother juice up to the Prophet brother man says Lord so my brother it's not my sister I know that I know their hearts I know who they are the devil has been working on them instead of you know praying for the individual to have compassion for the individual knowing what they're going through people are going through things people are battling certain fights and battles in their life sir people don't be the way they are is because of the power that they're going through and he said Lord bless them bless my brother how cool overcome here he was offended here he was attacked and he requests his response because he recognized he realized he knows he understands what we're going through we need to understand brothers and sisters that we're all in this battle Bravo super great warfare we're all trying to struggle and fight this flesh and if I don't hear your heart is true I call that you're trying to overcome you're trying to depress on that they're not just treading water and staying afloat they are swimming in pursuit of God swimmers are spirits the fullness of God in this place for strength and this is where the believers appreciate God's strength in this place there's still levels that we have to go over the top they did their video the holy so mottley is where the water is risen deep enough to swim in rivers that no one could cross at this stage of Lieber's completely submerged out of sight the hearing in the wire this is the final stage of the monitor that is important you you are not using your own power to wait through the or you're rewarded in the fullness of the Holy Spirit this is where God wants us to be this is the goal that has for all believers the water is over your head you are submerged in the holy God swimming in it forget about your abilities knowledge and education is the total submission to the will and the flow of the Spirit it is leaving your comfort zone and thought real deep he says I mean real deep submission takes you to a place there are instance incidents of how the Prophet and the surrendered himself to be led to go into the river at the door walk down the stream never got up of the water you see even when he was ankle deep wasty needy you know you didn't get out of the water he couldn't walk out of the water of the shore when he did he trusted the Lord the Lord said angrily he said waste you trust them he said chesty be trusted he said over your head now we trusted him he didn't have a he didn't have nothing to go back to the shore burning the bridges behind you all the way are no way that's the way there's all the way of knowing hallelujah our personal life must grow larger and larger we need to depend on him for everything he must increase and our flesh must decrease John 3:30 are you holding back on total commitment to Christ because you are afraid of drowning God will not fail you he is faithful to take care of you he's Jehovah Jireh the Lord that provides if he gives you a vision remember another vision people perish a revelation he will make the provision spiritually financially in all areas of your life I will provide all your needs seek the kingdom of God first
