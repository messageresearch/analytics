[Music] more days [Music] oh [Music] on [Music] tell me praise the lord praise the lord on this sunday morning i'm especially happy and ecstatic to be in the presence of the lord and to have the opportunity to speak to his people and of course you know uh this does not mean speaking just to you that are in here because of our uh broadcast online it's going out across so we hear from nations and africa even from india and europe and islands of the sea so we thank the lord that his word is being scattered abroad as the scripture says the knowledge of the lord shall fill all the earth and the spirit of the lord will fall and we thank god for that today that he's accomplishing his will please god bless you please be seated just for a moment i want to say that um i thank god that today is the my 14th day after having my second vaccine where um of course they say at that time you don't really have to wear a mask and i'm away from you and i'm up here that's the reason why i'm not wearing a mask and i have the freedom to be able to book a light speak the word of god to you amen so just so that you know that we want to give him all glory and praise now we are just going to get to the point preach the word and after the service we would like to make an award and we pray that god you will remain while we do that um at the end of the service uh praise god the sound adjustment would be wonderful we give god glory and praise amen the la one of the last sermons i preached was on uh provoking him in the wilderness in which we touched on the fact uh not knowing that kovit of course was coming but on the fact that um children in the wilderness israel in the wilderness and we will be put in the wilderness and there in the wilderness you'll be on your own you're going to be tested and you're going to be tried as to your own faith and this business you're being kept by the pastor's fate kept by your brother your mother your sister the deacon of the fate always have to prop up the tomato plant that is over bro god is watching for his real true seeds and like brother branham said they look like scrub plants just like weeds but if you notice everything else die and the weeds are there they look like they're dried up just a little rain and up they come again and you have a time to try to kill them off you can't get rid of them but we are sweet seed of god and we thank god for that i was reading last night where he said that seed could even look dead all the pulp flesh on it dead gone and everything but just let that sunshine come out just let some rain fall and that seed gets a resurrection that seed comes to life praise god hallelujah so i'm glad we could be here in the house of god we're together again just praising the lord together again in one accord giving glory and honor and praise to his mighty and glorious name god bless every one of you here in the house of the lord now thank god for this new system that we have a new camera system and uh they're working on it they just had it and they're putting in their time and adjustment so let's pray for them that god will help all the singers everyone realizing that this to put it to good use after a while we'll get into the stream and the hang of things okay praise the lord so we thank the lord for that remember also i'm not ready to let you know that as yet but because of this broadcast a revival broke out in a certain country and in the space of two to three months there are 500 believers that are believing this message [Applause] and have been baptized in the name of jesus christ and as of last wednesday one of those persons was a woman from england who had a place in jamaica where herself and husband will go there and spend six months and then go back or whatever and uh she happened to be in the post office when we sent the first box because before this revival broke out god wanted us to know if you're not you're not doing it you're helping it i'm doing it so they had no books all it was was one or two books that the brothers gave to the one young man who had driven for about three or four hours to their hotel room because he saw them with this pin and he said for some reason he doesn't know why it bothered him he couldn't sleep he couldn't rest he had to find where they were to find out what this pin was about what is it what does it mean and of course they he found them in the hotel and they explained to him what it was he accepted the lord and the message they baptized him in water i'm at home in canada and i said well the brothers went over there you know and uh why don't i give them a call to see how they're doing and say oh brother it's good you call we just baptized the brother and he's just leaving so i said oh is that right can i talk to him they put him on and i spoke with him and when prayed with him spoke with him and then he was about to leave and uh just as he was about to i said just a minute brother by your name he said my name is stephen i said stephen my brother you have great work ahead of you stephen full of faith and power the holy ghost also amen praise god but of course when i said that i didn't think anything but my goodness the first week he baptized 10 people the next week it was 20 the next week 40 the next week 60 next week 70 and so on and it started building and building and it went up to that those numbers of of over 500 and as of last saturday uh 10 or 15 people were baptized in water in the name of the lord jesus christ but what i'm getting at is that he had um there were no churches really functioning in that country at that time but the minister of health whether by misadventure mistake or whatever had given him a signed piece of paper by him saying that he could run church because when he called he thought he was just getting a secretary but the secretary was busy so the minister himself took the call so he didn't know he was talking to the minister and the minister issued him the permit so he was functioning and what happened the the numbers are growing and they keep provoking them and stuff like that i'm just praising this but the fact is two weeks ago the elders of the churches called up the government and talked about partiality and this and that and ask for him to be arrested right this sounds like the bible with jesus it sounds like the book of acts with paul and uh stirred up the powers and so they sent in the police and while he was there trying to talk to the people from the pulpit they came and arrested him a riot almost broke out the sisters were crying and the men were angry and it was just two or three policemen so anything could have happened because they were really angry and so he said brother i don't know what it is but the same thing that i always feel came and i just felt calm and i started talking to the people and they calm right down and i was able to go out there with the police telling them not to worry but god everything is going to work out god will make a way amen and so he had to spend a night in prison and then they some of the believers bailed him out of the prison and so he's out now but in the case they they find him a fine of 3 500 canadian dollars and the reason for that is with that paper of the health minister the prime minister issued an edict for the entire country an order for the entire country that meant that no churches should function and so the policemen said we know you have this and it's valid but we can't pay attention to it because we have this and this supersedes that this is the prime minister this is the health minister obviously we have to listen to the prime minister so we have we're doing they didn't want to do it but they had to do it so they took him but anyway he's out right now and they brought him back on last wednesday and then it was put over again until this coming friday right this coming friday praise the lord so the lord bless our brother we try to help him with like a thousand canadian dollars of course i said trust the lord pray and let's see how the lord will meet that need and the sister that was baptized from england also was suffering from an issue and there god's holy spirit like the woman in the bible with jesus she got baptized and he was telling me about it i said you go right now lay your hands and pray for her because that is was then i can see this is what god wants now and that's what he did and this woman happened to be a a nursing sister in england they called them that means uh an experienced older registered nurse that's over a ward um she she ended up with it absolutely dead stopped gone and shouting and praising the lord so she has her friends in england uh you know hearing the word and believing and she's in quarantine but soon she'll be out and going to one of the churches there anyway our god is good isn't he he's the same yesterday today and forever well we give god glory and we give him all the praise and so let us continue to believe and trust the lord i'm not going to be uh up here for a long time but we want to take revelation chapter 4 verse 1. and just take a little thought every one of us come back here today we've been chased and we are changing because you have tasted your own personal freedom and life we are telling you over and over you are free but you're free with the boundaries of the word but no pastor which is wrong is here to watch you seven the life of god is in you and he watches over you you have to take care of yourself you have to put restraints on yourself it's you and him you and the holy spirit praise god and so i know i have changed i have been transformed i've experienced growth and i know you have experienced growth and you've experienced changed because when you hit your knees there was no pastor there to pick you up and rub the knee and put a plaster on it you had to pick yourself up right with his help you pick yourself up and the holy spirit helped you and straightened you and that way you're stronger than you were before and i give god the glory and the praise and the honor for that now if we will turn in our bibles reading from revelation chapter 4 verse 1 after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee which must be hereafter amen let us pray gracious father one said just the taste of thy word within our hearts is wonderful and we give you praise and honor for this lord asking your blessing upon your people near and far may you have take all the glory as you send out the gospel light from this lighthouse may the spirit of god shed forth this light lord upon the hearts that some drifting forlorn brother sister that's in some in some kind of a religious atmosphere be drawn out into your divine presence of the sunlight that you might receive growth light life fruit for your coming glory in jesus name amen and amen god bless you please be seated as our scripture read after this i looked praise god he was seeing before but he wasn't looking but now he says after this i looked i mean you walk around with your eyes and you look around you're seeing but look means paying particular attention to something that caught your attention and that's when you look right so he said and i look after this after what the seven church ages are now over and after this he got his sight was even brighter and clearer and he says now i looked not just seeing the word but i looked i i caught a revelation amen now he's a type of us now you if you're speaking of john as a person there as a prophet it he was already catching revelation but in order to type us god is placing it this way in his word that we might understand that now we can see clearly what is in the word so brother branham as you know taught us and spoke about the first poll how many knows about the first poll okay well the first bull as you know was healing and that went to your body the second pull was dissolved and that went to your spirit the third pull this word went to your soul the complete person amen body spirit or mind and soul praise god so those were the first three polls that brother branham spoke about but i want to say here i want to speak on heaven's pull praise god now we understand that the pull of course was this word by the messenger the prophet of malachi 4 5 that appealed to the soul of those seeds of god that were buried in the earth of human society and the holy spirit called them back to attention of his word by that third pope of course there are many other aspects to it but that is not their subject i'm speaking on the third pull appealing to something that's buried in you and i from before the foundation of the world so that when you heard the sound of that voice coming through that trumpet of the prophet you heard the voice and you hear oh you heard a call as the lord said in his word my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow and because we heard the voice by that third pull it attracted us now i i'm speaking on heaven's pole now we understand heavens pull heavens the catching up or the catching away the pulling up the pulling away praise god heaven's full now not just by the spoken word but heavens fullest by the revealed word and that goes only to the bride of jesus christ that only appeals to the bride of jesus christ that is the only thing that magnetizes our soul and catches her away into the presence of the living god amen the pull of the revealed word other things are beautiful wonderful but nothing else really attracts her accept the opening of that word when he opens his mouth and he speaks the word that is the attraction on the top of the pyramid oh blessed be the name of our god oh praise god hallelujah so the bride seems to be the fourth paul you say brother simon you ran into the word the prophet never spoke of any fourth paul well i know four is the number of the pride one two three but four is the bride's number that is the bridegroom's call that is the revealed word that is him now come to the bride to reveal himself to her personally and privately and he calls out to her she hears his voice and it pulls her into his presence amen this is the last poll i said this is the last poll and this is the pull into glory praise god hallelujah no one i ask this for the song to be sung or beulah land sweet bull the land oh praise god as we stand here brother sister and we look across to see heaven's glories and the coming of the lord the parting of the curtain of time oh my i heard the voice i feel the pull oh praise god amen it's not now it's not pulling me into the message like it did it has done that job it's now pulling me out into the presence of almighty god into heaven's glory into the presence of god hallelujah oh one song said you're in heaven's borderland amen we are on the borders of heaven we're right on the borders of heaven oh just about to cross the jordan amen glory to god thank god some of the priest's foot is beginning to hit that water and the water is parting the word is opening up the spirit is making himself clean and clear amen and the word is making itself know what i'm speaking about to you you understand it's light to you but to others it's darkness to you you rejoice others say what is he talking about to them it's like fun they'll make fun of this they'll make a joke out of it it's crude it's rough it's it's not symmetrical it's not intellectual it's not well you know beautiful with its presentation and so more praise god brother sister this has no appearance this has nothing that you got to love and like about it naturally speaking but something inside of you my man the deep crawls back to the deep and the deep response back to this world amen that's the authority of a true servant of god not his authority but the authority of the word of god he can speak the word knowing that the word will have a reaction in the hearts of the true believer amen praise god amen so view the land sweet beulah land upon the mountain top i stand oh glory to god i'm glad i'm standing on the mountain top of this pyramid i'm glad that we can look across the gap right into the fullness of the world oh praise this wonderful name yes earth is pulling its own the world is pulling its own to itself amen and heaven is pulling its own back to itself amen and it's all going on right now while we are speaking amen what are you talking about forceful second third pull now you were talking about heaven's pull yes well when we say pull we mean this is something that gets your attention amen the first ball something that gets your attention and when that broke out it got their attention amen pull something that will not only get your attention but attract you amen it will attract you praise god hallelujah pull magnetism amen magnetic pull something that draws you like the north pole back to itself hallelujah then we we see here when you talk about pull to understand it you understand the pull that gravity has on every single human being that is upon the face of this earth that we are living in praise god hallelujah oh my i feel the pull i heard voice praise god hallelujah i want you to know god is not the author of confusion god has a world that operates with laws amen no it operates with laws natural and spiritual laws amen we got the laws of gravity electricity and laws of growth the laws of reproduction laws of sowing and reaping if you saw he says you you got to reap you're going to reap whatever you sow so there's a law spiritual laws there's a law of compensation amen you you throw out a uh a brick or a rubber ball and it bounced right back to you amen law of harvest the law of cause and effect brother branham spoke on that and then there is the law of contrast amen praise god now earth has its main law and the main law of this earth or of this world is the law of gravity and that controls everything on this earth but god also has his law that controls his people and his children and everything that is really from him now earth's law says what goes up must come down but god law says no what comes down must go up amen so you decide which law you want to live by but our law god's law from his word is that what jesus said none can go into heaven except he that came down from heaven and if you come down from heaven out of the gateless past of the mind of god and you're broke into time amen hallelujah after you serve your sentence and time you're breaking right back into glory in the presence of almighty god there we are now praise god praise the lord we're not asking for no kind of a compromise with the devil we're not asking him for probation you leave alone for a short while and i leave you alone no we are breaking out of here the bible said peter and paul were put in prison but but one night that prison house began to shake it began to move amen and the bible says the gates were open amen i'm there walk out praise god i believe our house of this life is shaken right now it's shaken right now and we are walking out to here no matter what they say no matter what they do they could chain you to the rock wall they could put all kinds of chains on your legs they can put sickness in your body they could trouble your mind the devil could do all kinds of stuff but you're breaking out of here free at last praise god we are free in the grace of almighty god amen is god you see when they when they say what goes up must come down they are really right but they are going by the law of earth right that whatever came out of the bosom of the earth it must come back to the bosom of the earth and what came out to the bosom of god is back to the wisdom of god because that's where it came from so they are right on their hand but we are also right on what we see in this world we didn't come from earth you're not creatures of time we come from eternity we go back to the eternity of god go back to the bosom of our heavenly father glory to god amen we know according to the law of contrast everything that exists has its opposite listen to brother branham here hearing recognizing and acting on the word uh paragraph 12 in the garden of eden sin was so until it attracted eve from righteousness to sin and in the same garden remember this there was the tree of life but there also was the tree of death and of knowledge contrast amen so is the law of contrast today that there where there is good there has to be evil when there is right there is also a wrong we will never know matter our environment our state of life we will never be able to shake ourselves away from the presence of either is that right you see now we don't want to talk but kink on separation from unbelief and separating from sin how they just think of it physically you know and stepping away they don't realize what that separation is something changed in here and in here and that separates you you don't have to do nothing to separate it's all around you they're everywhere everything is around you amen everywhere what you want to do about it they go around marching against homosexuals marching against uh abortionists marching against this match and against that well you may look in the word and you see what the word says about such things but it has nothing to do with your relationship meeting them people dealing with them because they're human beings like you talking with them and loving them don't you think jesus loved judas just all the other ones he loved all of them even though he know they're going to hell he gives them rain he gives them water he gives them his food to give them everything just like you and me that's the love of god without impartiality it doesn't mean he agree with them doesn't mean that he support what they're doing but that's just the love of god is in all encompassing and encircling and it takes in everybody hallelujah praise god amen one minute brother simon you're against that kind of thing now i hear you talking it looks like you're for it well that's the way it always appear amen because we are walking the line we're walking god's ballot line of balance amen we're walking the line of his word amen praise god god's love contrasts everything exists has its opposite to it amen see that's the way it is you can't shake yourself away from that for it is a love it's there paul even said when i would do good evil present with me the sinner will never be able to shake himself away from the christian and the question of will never be able to shake himself away from the sinner that's the way it has to be and god has it that way brethren brethren praise the lord so don't go on a bus and then you're shifting over because you know a sinner or unbeliever comes beside you they're just like you only that you by the grace of god were chosen to be a part of his kingdom just like you amen there'll be a witness here of right and a witness or testimony of wrong also and that will be always but you as individual you must make your choice you have to take one side or the other that's the way that it is day and night male and female amen amen one time he says man without a without a woman is nothing and a woman without a man is nothing but together one together for his glory praise the lord so these two powers or forces exist in creation regardless of what we think they exist and they're here within the creation and so this law earth's law gravity controls uh our physicality of what we do because that's the what the paul called the law of the earth see the law of the mercy or arts law that controls the things of the law and that is the that is the pull of the earth the pull of the the pull of the devil the pull of this thing it has its pull also he's telling you there if he comes with the first second and third pull and everything goes by contrast so so what's the contrast it's out there and that's what i'm telling you that's out there the devil has this pull of gravitation pull on the world and gospel for you on that side but god's word is here to pull you to his side of his word amen praise god hallelujah yes sir so the physical activity of that law is to pull everything back to itself every thing that belongs to it back to itself as the book of genesis tells us in the bible and we say it as preachers at funerals ashes to ashes dusted us you come from the earth he says and to the earth you will return amen why because whatever belongs it's pulling that back amen it pulls all his children is pulling them back to the ground praise god and that's why as human beings our bodies when you i don't care how much weight you lift you can own a health food store and have all the vitamins you like and you can be eating all the precise right vitamins and doing everything and you're going to find while you start to hit certain age your body start bending over you see it's pulling it back to where it come from it starts to bend off you try to straighten up and try to it just won't do it's not the same it start to bend already it's going back to where it come from right praise god that's the way it is because your physical bodies actually come as the prophet explained from the elements of the earth every of all the vitamins all the elements it comes from the very earth that we are from praise god and unless we can break the power of that law of this gravity of this world we're gonna be pulled right back there and stay there amen praise god hallelujah oh my i don't care what you say you can do whatever you like your foot going to start dragging after a while you can't raise your hand over your head after a while you can't do it as you like to do i was speaking to a certain brother that's a wonderful preacher and missionary of the gospel and say oh brother he says now i i lost my sight you know age catching up with me i i can't see anymore i just came back from the doctor well you say oh he's a believer and he lost his sight well believer has nothing to do with it just living in this human flesh is what got to do with it and the earth is pulling back everything to itself and we feel that pulling power of gravity in us that's why we start to get lines on our face we call them wrinkles and uh you start to get bags under your eyes my wife was pointing to some i have and and so you start getting those things because the earth is pulling it's pulling and you can't you can't resist you can try to hold it back but brother branham says you can do that it's good he said even i tried it he says but you can he said i i'm eating more meat and vitamins than i ever did before when we were poor and i'm getting older i'm not getting younger right because that's the law and that's the nature of what it's doing to us at this time praise god and we start to manifest that law the scripture says it is appointed unto men wants to die and after this the judgment but we're appointed to die as long as we're in this body amen so gravity is pulling all his children back to the grave the earth is pulling his children back to itself and that is the laws of mortal existence amen we say like will always attract to like everything that are it will attract like that amen praise god but we don't all have to submit to that that's what i'm here to say amen everything has its opposite and that's how you have that law of gravity pulling the people and every one of us down to the grave if the rapture doesn't come and take you before then you are going to a grave and you don't have to fight and scroll and say i'm not going because you don't care anymore because you have another law operating in your life amen there's a spiritual law that's here to pull you into glory that's heaven's law and it's his fool who in heaven's pull amen god always keeps his law in balance paul speaks of it in the word of god amen and he says but we have the law of the spirit of life hallelujah the law of the spirit of life is here to quicken you amen quicken you and to pull you out of this break the gravitational pull amen oh my you already heard the come down you already been sealed in oh praise god this is the take off brother sister when you see those spiritual astronauts take off what do you think when you look at those rockets going off from miami they're in the earth's pool until they hit a certain place and all of a sudden that aircraft is moving fast but with the film we can still see it because it's moving like that right it's moving like that but then all of a sudden a certain spot you're here bam and when you hear bam you're just a big fan boom that thing has gone faster than many times the speed of light and it's headed for outer space lord of god that's what i'm talking about amen oh the holy spirit oh that's the law of life is in you taking you with sealing you in and that word in that rocket ship that cone that you are in all of a sudden the king blasts off into outer space and holds you into the presence of almighty god amen praise god genesis 1 the earth was without form and without void amen and it was like that until the sun came god called for the sun called for the rain called for the wind amen and they all came and give it life amen and we understand that brother sister came into our spiritual existence by the rising of the sun of the spoken word amen branham says it plainly in that message when he said now like the earth now the darkness and the gloom that was over your spirit all the clouds that were over your soul the sun of the world is risen upon you and is shining upon you and now the gloom has to go away that you can see the light of the word of god that's shining in this hour upon your heart and upon your life forgive me sister elaine praise god i'm sorry but praise the lord jesus amen our sister is doing translation and then i speed up like that all of a sudden and then i just got the realization oh my she's translating there praise god i i'm gonna try the best i can to stay within the boundaries but if i break out amen hallelujah praise god all the laws of this entire universe not only of earth is controlled by god's spoken word because there was nothing that was made that was made without god's spoken word so his spoken word controls everything amen and so friends the earth and even that pull that the earth has to pull you back to the grave that is under the power and control god's spoken word now the sun of course is under god's control too but that is a symbol of heaven's law it's there as a representation of heaven's law that just as the earth will pull you to the grave the sun will pull the little jew drops right back up where they come from so the sun is before you every day as a symbol and a promise amen you are not staying in no grave you are not staying the war in this earth you are not staying under the influence under the pull under all the magnitude charming serpent spirit that's upon this earth you're not i'm not going to stay under the spell but i'm breaking the spell i'm breaking the pull heavens pull to pull you out of this and to pull you into the very presence of god in the heavenlies amen praise god one pull pulls you to the grave and the other one pulls you into glory oh what a contrast this law of the spirit of life praise god i'm not using the quotes here i'm just telling you to a great extent what they say the lord but just so that you know if you ask that i got them here i got them here it's not me just talking i'm talking because it's pulled what is already been said and i just don't want to spend my time talking about page six six and page that and paragraph eight here whatever i just want to tell you what my understanding of what he has said amen out of the word of god amen hallelujah praise god so this law of gravity has its negative side and it has its positive side the negative side of course will take you to the grave amen it will take you to the grave and passing over this quickly the positive side of it if you understand it and can work with it it'll take you to success prosperity blessing and so on that's the natural positive side of using that law of gravity amen you'll attract certain things to yourself and so on we won't spend our time with that amen but it's continuously manifesting in our lives and you attract to this to yourself the things that you think you you pray about you meditate about you begin to attract those things to yourself or those things are drawn to you by the grace of god hallelujah and we attract ourselves all that belongs to us by predestinated will of the mystery of god is that right you believe that you believe in god has a mystery will you know just like how i i have a written will so that my children will inherit whatever you know crumbs i left leave behind but the thing about that is god also has a will but god's will like every every person's will is a mystery because the the benefactors don't really know everything that's written in the will they might have some idea but they don't have a clear revelation until the lawyers in the will and then they get an idea of it but what happens to you that everything that is in that will that belongs to you by predestination comes to you as you believe it in the word of god because i want you to know and i'm touching on this just briefly that you are here and god as i've said before knows you are his children you're going to be here and when she is here when he's here he's going to need this he's going to need that he's going to need this going to need that they're going to go through this problem and i got this solution that solution everything is already there and i mentioned it like a mother knows a child is coming in the world she just doesn't sit down until the child appears oh my god i have a child i have to know one run to get diapers i have to get this no they prepare that place that room that clothing every the food the child has to eat and drink and everything that the child needs is prepared not when the child is here before the child even gets there it's ready so god being a good father a good mother a good parent already has done that for you and mine and all we have to believe that all that is yours must come to you by faith not pentecostal faith not oh god no you just trust him lord i'm your child i don't even know what belongs to me i don't even know what's out there that you have for me but whatever it is just send it is that right just send it because i know apostle paul says all things work together for good to them that love the lord so whatever you want to send to my life send it because you're going to turn out for my good anyway so i'm trusting you and i believe in you and i'm called into god's unchanging hand amen praise god hallelujah yes sir so let the spirit of christ in you pull to you all the things by his spirit that belong to you and that you trust in him because of course like attracts like amen praise god and it will only repel or push away what is unlike itself i'm going to complete this just in a few minutes praise the lord because i pay attention to you but i got to pay attention to other things also certain boundaries here amen we know that thus the scripture said light cleaves to light and darkness gathers itself onto the darkness amen now brother brennan said don't you understand the darkness is gathering and that's why we're getting a blackout and a total blackness praise god but we're also having a uniting time because the light is also gathering to itself and we are walking in the light and let me say these words here amen and they're from a gentleman by the name of thomas tickle t-i-c-k-e-l-l 1685-1740 he says i hear a voice you cannot hear and i see a hand you cannot see that hands beckon me away it beckons me to a place you can't see amen i'm hearing a voice that many people can't hear and i see and i feel a hand in my life amen that is calling me come up here oh praise god and that hand is beckoning me come away come up here though hallelujah praise god revelation 4 4 1 come up hither and i sh i will show you the things that are going to be hereafter i can show it to you now because you're not going to be here to go telling anybody anyway so because i'm going to pull you out of here so let me show it to you start to show you some of those things that are going to be hey man because you won't be here it's human that things might come before that start to happen i'm going to pull you out of here amen praise god forevermore i'm so happy that i can say i'm one of them i'm glad that this great wheel that god has taken us to put us in the middle of that wheel that's in the middle of the wheel and it's the last other spinning they're turning and everything is happening all around only have to be in your right full position and place all the stars all the moons on the earth all these laws they're working together and they're working for what you're good they're they have to work so get back to where you come from hallelujah there's a voice calling us amen laws of that will transform you and glorify you i'm thinking of a quote here brother branham speaking here somewhere let me see if i can find that and close with that quotation here where he says you know what it means when he says here man from that law law given you'll find some of those quotes in restoration of the bright tree amen oh praise god returning of the sun back to the earth what does it do it forces death out the sun comes up and it forces death to lose its dead amen god set that law and the son is bringing it to pass god set law in gravitation and god sets that amen that when the flower has served its term amen this served the storm and it seems to have died on the earth amen then my friends there is a resurrection you see for the sons comes on the seed and forces life amen and death can't hold it anymore oh praise god for god's laws are now in motion and they work in harmony with his spoken word the love life that is in us will bring us into that pull us into that resurrection and that's what i'm telling you heaven's pull pulling you into the resurrection promised by the living god i am glad that i heard the voice many cannot hear and i see the hand beckoning me away to come away into his presence come up hither and i show you things that must shortly come to pass brother mike will you come up and let's sing together the holy hills of heaven calls me to mention sphere across the sea do you have that brother praise god the holy hills of heaven caused me do you have that praise the lord actually i went
