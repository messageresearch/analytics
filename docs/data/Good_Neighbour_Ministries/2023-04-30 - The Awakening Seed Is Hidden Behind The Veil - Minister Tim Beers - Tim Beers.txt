[Music] God bless you real good I'm glad that you could be here [Music] wow praise God of course we know that this is a marvelous and wonderful spiritual responsible every man and every woman has a capacity to bring forth a child as God has said we are to multiply we are to reproduce ourselves and as that has become so commonplace that people don't see the sacredness in it that God allows you can be a vessel to bring forth another life and it's a it's it's a natural but Supernatural because him the life that lives in this body though it's he's a child right now yeah you won't know that person until they begin to fully Express them right so God is saying to take responsibility for protection provision training uh guidance and everything of that nature until he comes to the age of accountability when he can understand for himself and begin to chart his own life's path but our responsibility that's given to us by God all parents regardless of who they are religion they are God gives that responsibility to every parent that that must be done and I'm sure your bear did that I know that praise the Lord so here we are today with this wonderful young man I can see a very healthy beautiful spirit on him and I pray that God will raise him up and bring him into His Marvelous Grace and knowledge amen how wonderful that is our prayer of dedication and pray God's blessing on him it's a wonderful thing to start the life millions of children out there and the parents have no time to at least let them have a start with God's blessing upon them if they divert from the pathway that will be their responsibility but they were introduced even now later on you can tell them you were prayed over you were dedicated in the house of God and that will always stay with them and the angels of God will watch over them protect them in all situations right praise God so let us pray our gracious God and Heavenly Father in this sacred presence of these marvelous clouds of Witnesses in this congregation we could commit Julian into your marvelous gracious ends oh May the supernatural presence of the almighty God rest and remain with this son let him be a blessed son let him be a useful son let him be a son that will make appearance proud and let him be a son that will warm the heart of God we ask your divine presence and your blessing upon him we also ask it for the appearance let salvation be within this house let peace and prosperity dwell Within These Walls let the great Harmony of the Holy Spirit the cloud By Night by day and the pillar of Fire by Night father to lead them and guide them in the way which they should take May the wells of Salvation be filled and made a refreshing of the Holy Spirit continue upon them wave after wave to the glory of God until they walk and move from Glory unto Glory unto Glory until they end up in the glory and your name we lift up now in the name of Jesus Christ I now dedicate Julian to the glory Praise of God God rest upon him now and forevermore in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you both congratulations [Music] [Applause] amen how blessed we are see addition of of natural children in the house of God is a wonderful symbol of the addition of spiritual children coming into the house of the Lord and we thank God for every one of you here from the youngest baby in here way up to brother Glenn he thought I was gonna bypass him he's used to me Originals been here for a long time so he thought I was going to bypass him and come up to me and say from the baby right up to me because I'm older than him but I just stopped this anyway we thank God for all of this now we want to prepare our hearts for the word of God I I believe that you're fully aware that the meetings with brother George Smith continues he may be at this very time not maybe right now he's ministering in Grace Tabernacle in Brampton and now after which he will leave and go into etobic coal Albion Road to minister the word of God in the Spoken Word Fellowship under the leadership of Pastor Gerard Samuels and may God bless us myself and wife we are going up there any of you that would love to do that you are encouraged to visit and bless them in every way remember the prophet already prophesied it he says right now the farmers have all the duck separated well one day the waters will rise and it'll rise so far until it go over every fence and then the Ducks will all start getting together getting together for the glory of God I believe that time is just about now it's starting to happen and to God be the glory as the minister prepares himself to bring the word of God let's bar heads look to the Lord in prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we bring to you Lord God one of the fruits from the Tree of Life we thank

Saints um good to be in the house of the Lord good have a dedication a spiritual type of our dedication to the Lord amen excited to uh come and and hear what God has to say to us today we are people that have crossed the inner Veil where the glories never fail amen live in in the presence of the king oh my Hallelujah I wish uh I wish uh uh any speaker could really uh Express the glory of this Revelation but uh there ain't words that can express it but he's called us to live it and let it live through US Amen in this hour so we're just privileged people here um to be even stand in here and even for you to be seated here amen to come we're called to come into His presence let us turn to the Bible let's get right into the word of God my desire and and all of the the ministers here desire let me tell you I was out in petroleum last week and you know God really uh bless them out there with the word of God and I hope that it really took root in what we're feeding off of here we don't realize what we got here you know you we we have such a foundational Ministry with Pastor Simon but the brothers that are here the gifts that are here it's just amazing if one one if a church can get one of these gifts in in their Church they'd be blessed and I'm not just boasting here if I am I'm boasting in the Lord right amen well we are so blessed here to get such a variety of the word of God and I'm just uh my heart's desires that I would bring something that would encourage you in this walk because a word has been given us today by a prophet to live to manifest amen we are part of that prophecy we must prophesy again we must bring forth this word again in this hour and that's all that's all my desire is something that would help you and sometimes it's uh you know this is a battle this is a battle right Bloodshed has to be shed sometimes and you know in in order for us to get the victory sometimes we got to be pushed right encourage all these things amen that's what it's all about amen I want to speak on the Awakening seed is hidden behind the veil we want to talk about the veil this morning I can't really bring it all out but if you really want to you know feed on that word this week uh the prophet's message go back after hearing this today uh the unveiling of God 1964. I tell you you'll be tremendously blessed there will be things in there that I can't possibly say that will just put things together and that's what we want to do in this hour amen feed on that word little by little and take that word what else what else are you going to intake what else is there if you don't recognize not veil of this world has not been broken out off of you that realize that that's nothing but death out there this is life he is life there's life here this morning amen and God wants to impart just like he and morphined himself he wants to impart his life to you this morning amen Hebrews 10 7. we got along first one is a little long scripture reading here and then we're going to go to Matthew 27 50. Hallelujah I mean there's thousands of messages right in here on these two scriptures right here then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God above when he said sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou wouldest not neither had his pleasure therein which are offerings by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the witch we are Sanctified through the offering of the blood of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest stand at Daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifice which can never take away sin but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down at the right hand of God which is the power of God Amen from henceforth expect until his enemies be made his footstool so his enemies are going to be made his footstool there is great victory that he is expecting you might not be expecting great Victory but he is expecting great victory Hallelujah for by for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he has said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin wow think about it haven't therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he had consecrated for us through the Veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near let us draw near the sacrifice has been made the blood has been shed we have entrance to the most holy place Hallelujah let us draw near with a true heart with in full Assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious and our bodies wash with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise oh my Matthews 27 50. so we see here that there's an offering made the old is done it's not by the law anymore he's right in in our hearts like John says he says the law we want him when you speak it comes alive in our hearts we want a living reality of God David says my my soul thirsteth for the Living God he's not a traditional God he's not a religion he's a living God Hallelujah Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghosts and behold the veil of the temple was rent in Twain from top to bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept a rose then and came out of the graves after this resurrection and went into the holy city and appearing unto many let us pray Hallelujah father we thank you Lord for this reading of your word as your Prophet said if we would just read your word that be sufficient of enough what we heard what we just read what you did you did this father before the foundations of the world this was your plan and you made a way father now we're rejoicing we're rejoicing in that father but Lord we here we are this morning Father veiled by by bodies of sin veiled by Traditions veiled by this world and the things that we have been taught indoctrinated Lord things that we believe our own interpretations our own ways as you said my ways are not your ways my thoughts are not your thoughts here we are this morning Lord oh God come as you tore that Veil father on that day on Calvary Lord there's veils here this morning tear them this morning Lord and open up the way father that we may enter into the most holies of holies where the Shekinah Glory is where the revelation of the word of who we are is Father without entering into that place father that was the token that your Prophet spoke about we must have the token the token must be applied that's the token oh God the pillar of fire lord come Lord the great warrior and do Great Mighty battles here today Lord and set your people free open prison doors break chains Lord God open the scales of the people's eyes the greatest thing in this hour is when she recognizes who she is she will be an invincible Army that's what you have purpose father come and do what you have spoken in Jesus name we ask amen you may be seated Hallelujah Great Awakening the hour where the bride must recognize who she is must take this word right to the resurrection because it's not what a man has said it's not what any Ministry has said but is what the word has said and that's what we're here for the hour has passed where we're just playing church and religion and coming to church because it's a good feeling no those days are done listen there's a door just like Noah had a door on the ark and Noah priest for 120 years that there's a coming of flood a rain nobody's seen a rain scientists proved that there was no rain up there just like in this day but he preached and he preached to the people but one day that door shut and then the rain came and God is still I believe on The Mercy Seat he is still calling and if he's still calling there's still Mercy On The Mercy Seat but there will be a day that he'll cease the call and when he ceased the call then that door will be shut the bride will be sealed in that Veil will be closed there's an individual closing of the veil behind individuals and then there's a a closing of the Bride of Jesus Christ of prophecies in this hour that God will close it to the rest of the world and tribulation will set in that time we will see the judgments of God upon the Earth but now now you're sitting here this morning you're listening there's Mercy On The Mercy Seat God has made himself available and he's available to us this morning Hallelujah Matthew 16 16. Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God listen to what his response was when Jesus asked who do the son they say the son of man am Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered him and said unto him bless it art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you or my father has started to rent the veil upon your life and your experience that's the first revelation that Peter caught that the father gave him and that was the beginning of the renting of the veil for Peter to see what was behind that Veil that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God many people didn't see him many people didn't understand him many people thought he was just the Carpenter's son born out of uh uh a false birth and all these things but the veil was rent for Peter and he took a look behind that Veil and he's seen who was behind there veils and I say unto thee Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church in the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now we can understand and see how can the Gates of Hell Prevail against he himself or else they would have prevailed In The Garden of Gethsemane when all of hell was Upon Jesus Christ pressing him that's oil press you know that the guardian Gethsemane is olive trees and and to get olive oil you've got to press it well it's just a perfect symbol and type that he was there as the olive around the olive trees being pressed so that the oil can be pressed out of him oh my we have our Garden of Gethsemane we have our cross we got to be pressed into this and we got to press into the kingdom of God it's not come without violence and force not physically but spiritually that's how it comes Hallelujah First Corinthians 15 49. and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this I say brethren flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither do corruption inherit incorruption if we bore this we're going to bear the Heavenly too Hallelujah that's what I see I see the coming of the Lord in my life I see I see that God is going to come behind this Veil I don't care what this Veil is I don't care how it was born I don't care if if uh if you had parents or you didn't have parents whatever circumstances that this Veil is under God is going to live behind it if his if he has put a seed an attribute in there he's going to live behind it this Veil Hallelujah not worthy we're not worthy none of us are worthy if we look at this this Veil but if we look to the word and what he has spoken I Look to Him in my walk in everything that's why I can believe right I can believe as John says those that are born of God do not commit sin for the seed remaineth in him and the seed cannot sin what am I making him if I believe that he lives inside of me and I'm born again what am I making if I put condemnation and guilt on myself who am I representing myself no there's a sacrifice for this I'm representing him he's behind the veil now he's sinless recognize Who You Are there's a powerful recognition that has taken place by the Holy Ghost in The Bride of Jesus Christ that's why he said she's going to be invincible brother Bradham came to a place Billy Paul said that he had Satan's number not that he was perfect in the flesh but he has Satan's number he was Saul behind the veil he was so shut in with God and the truth of who he was that word was so matured inside of him that he understood that this thing had nothing to do with him that's the place he got to my my scriptures use the term Veil in different settings to refer to whatever covers our eyes from seeing God the eyes and seeing are not used for knowing or Experiencing God and not in a usual physical sense of seeing therefore a veil is whatever keeps people from knowing god or experiences power and his presence so many veils Upon Our Lives and that's what you got to take the word you got to work out your own salvation right is when you understand and you see by faith the veils that are on your life and you start renting it it's not about the pastor or the preacher coming it's use your faith that you take the word that's what it's all about it's individuals taking the word and renting veils upon your life Breaking Traditions breaking habits like brother Brown says thus saith the Lord nothing won't move thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord keep speaking it keep believing it keep feeding on the word keep feed on who you are one day it'll break one day the revelation will come and just like he said in perfect faith when you know that Faith Comes it comes and nobody nobody can talk you out of that when that Faith Comes it's settled it's done it's over it's completed Hallelujah spiritual veils today cover people's hearts not their faces Paul says but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their hearts wow we can look back Moses in the types of Moses but who's our Moses veils even here today in the message veils valent people from sin and experience God look into what God did back there but not seeing what he's doing now not recognizing what he's doing now in your own life believing that God said a prophet is good believing the signs wondering Miracles are good believing that the prophet everything he said is true is good but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that has it become real to you in your life Hallelujah you keep praying for me as we press through here I was up most of the night not feeling well but here I am this morning the Press through amen because this is not about me you're looking at you're looking at this Veil out here right but this is not about me this is about him he's the one that died on Calvary not me he's the one that gave his life he's the one that's been walking in the middle of the church ages and all down Through the Ages he's the one that's kept the seed alive even to sometimes the very last time he's the one that planned all this he's the one that's purpose in his heart he's the one that has called you even to come and listen to the words this morning Hallelujah amen second Corinthians 3 15 when Moses came down from Sinai he put a physical Veil over his face because his face was glowing however this physical Veil on his face was a symbol of a spiritual Veil on the hearts of the Israelites covering their eyes from truly knowing and seeing God Hallelujah there's something wrong with man or woman that can't see the promises of God for this day and see it manifest and then refuse to believe it because of denominational pulls and veils you see they're all veils in order to do this our denominational tradition veils must be broken by God's spirit and Fire and sword which is his word always his word is the sword see and he took the sword that day full of fire and ripped the veil from top to bottom he does the same thing with the same sword today not my Creed book not my catechism Not My Thoughts my own ideas but the sword of the word you see that's what rips the Veil Down in our lives and then you can see God standing there in plain view what a glorious view to look at all right God's holy spirit and fire his sword rips it the word rips the nominational veils all different types of veils so that we can see him in plain view that's what we want to see is him we want to see Jesus we want to recognize him Above All Things he's our everything we are nothing without him but with him we're everything I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and I believe the bride is recognizing who she is I believe she's coming to a place amen behind that inner Veil why because I can see it manifest the bride has the ability to see that word manifest right before her eyes she's recognizing the same God that's in her she's recognizing it out there in individuals that have rent the Veil oh my thank you Lord amen the spiritual the scriptures also reveal types of spiritual veils first this is a veil of God the God of this world Satan that blinds unbelievers from seeing or accepting Jesus that's a big Veil today oh big Veil today of this world brother Brian cried out in the spirit and said blind laid osia you're so blind three times he cried out in the spirit the blindness of this age the darkness of this age is not only Darkness but it's gross Darkness if God didn't allow the prophet to draw a little bit of light that was the mercy and grace of God for me and you this morning that he drew a little bit of light that we could see our way out of this like brother George said last night they all came up how did you make it out of laosia I didn't think anybody was going to make it out of Laos here but let me tell you there's going to be a bride like never before in all ages they're going to bring a faith to Perfection that's going to change your body she has a backbone she's a warrior she's a fighter she doesn't give up when Satan comes and and Boo at her she boosts back she takes the word of God because she knows the word of God she knows that Satan cannot deal with that word when you try to deal with yourself you try to deal with your own thoughts your own interpretation you know that's that's when you get all tangled up and Satan takes you and and throws you around but you take that word of God you take that word of God he can't battle against that no way it's staying behind the word all right Hallelujah that has never changed and never will change Hallelujah how many times you've heard over the years our pastors screaming back to the word back to the truth back to the original way back to the Holy Ghost back to plenty class that's going to give you Pentecost in your life oh Hallelujah amen beneath that clip wired up here amen thank you Lord Hallelujah the second Veil of the Tabernacle which separates the people from God's presence Hebrews 10 20 later revealed that this veil was Jesus body that had to be sacrificed for us to come to know the father in The holies of holies the third Veil is the law you see this is a strong Veil because the law is spiritual and and people like to mix today law and Grace here today but you can't mix law and Grace because Grace fulfilled law and you got to walk in Grace not in law because law brings Traditions rituals habits that you get yourself locked into and you don't see God one thing I've always recognized as I grow that we feel grown and maturing you know the wave sheep being waved before us we know he's the wave sheet but he waved himself when he came to the Earth here was God unveiled in flesh wave into the people his own people and they didn't see him they rejected them they were blind and here come a prophet in this day and age all the reformers but a prophet in this day and age God Valen behind that Veil that skin amen and waving himself what was that was it just the gifts was it just a discernment it was a life I detect a life there when I hear that voice I see and recognize a life I wanted God I wanted God when when when my life was so messed up and and and God came and spoke to me I wanted him I wanted I was empty I knew who I was I was lost I was lost you need to recognize that you're lost without him I needed him and that was it that's all I knew I needed the true and living God to come inside of me and do the changes that I need religion can't do that for you Traditions can't do that for you the law can't do that for you only he the Living God come behind the veil your Veil can do those changes that you need in your life listen young people Mary was only Young she's only a teenager when the angel came to her and said Mary this is what's going to happen this is what's going to take place behind your Veil you're going to conceive and that's going to be the Son of God that you're going to conceive and she said how how can this be I know no man and that's that's typical of a human being oh how can this be I I don't pray enough I don't study enough I don't do this enough I don't do that my good works my sins my mistakes in my life how can it be that the Son of God is going to be born inside of me but he told he said the Holy Ghost not you not your church the Holy Ghost young people the Holy Ghost will overshadow you and come into you and let that be born what do you got to do young people maybe older people here today be it unto me according to Thy Word according to Thy word be it unto me and then start your journey this glorious Journey of dying out daily as Paul says I Die daily I can't die I can't die a true Christian can't die I'm dying right now I'm dying daily to myself you know you understand why your brother and your sister is not your enemy you understand the prophet what he said your greatest enemies yourself and it says work out your own salvation keep your eyes on Jesus Christ pray for your brother and sister because you know the sin that they're struggling with might not be the sin you're struggling with but it's still sin amen that's why who is love God is love you can have all these gifts and all these manifestations it says but if you don't have love you have nothing love governs and conquers everything Hallelujah what about us today what could prevent us from knowing and experience God's power and his presence since there are three veils above have been removed in Christ the believer's problem today is that we could call it functional veils or spiritual blindness in general for instance a lack of understanding will prevent us from knowing god Ephesians 1 18-20 while a lack of faith will hinder us from seeing the power and glory of God John 11 14. the Bible says if you lack wisdom you lack Faith ask and God will give it liberally there's no shame in lock in faith or experience with God but there's shame when you don't get desperate before God you don't be perseverant before God you don't be like the unjust judge and keep knocking on the door Lord It's Me Again Lord It's Me Again Lord not my brother not my sister but it's me in the need of Revelation it's a constant unfolding like the Roman Candle it's constantly involved in itself a morphing in itself bringing itself down just like he condescend down into flesh he's doing the same thing in our lives he's condescended by the word of God believed by faith in our hearts he's condescending into us today Hallelujah John 16 13. when the spirit of truth comes it will guide you into all truth man's teachings are veils that keep us from recognizing God and recognizing our position man is always trying to take the law and mix it with Grace because of unbelief or lock of Revelation there are always motives and intentions behind doing thank you the spirit of Revelation is what tears and rips the veils Upon Our Lives we recognize our sins then we confess them then we believe that we are set free then the veil of sin is ripped and we enter more little by little into most to the most holy place the holies of holies with Jesus Christ little by little will I deliver my people little by little will I give you the land Hallelujah don't look for great great land to be taken and great things to happen but little by little God will give you Victory he'll give you a peace one step at a time he'll give it to you but don't stop walking keep walking in the light keep walking in the spirit you'll overcome you will overcome one day you will get the victory that you need that revelation will break through remember Daniel pray 21 days for the answer he said the angel said I had a resistance against me I had a battle believe me there's battles here today there's Angels warring around here but there's angels of God here so that the word can go forth into your heart into your soul and maybe start ripping the Veil when that Veil starts ripping you ain't going to see me you ain't gonna see brother Simon you ain't going to see any ministers you're going to see Jesus Christ a pillar of Fire and you know what would I know you know when you see him you know when you recognize him just like Peter when he recognized him Thou Art does Christ the son of the Living God that's who this is that's who this is that's who this has always been for me and I'm recognizing it more and more and more as I walk the scales are being lifted the veil is being rent more and more until we walk right into the glory Hallelujah thank you Lord we make a lot of things in our lives hinder the word of God and make the word of God a none effect think about that not God us we do that it does not take effect like Jesus said my word will not return unto me void but it will accomplish you wonder why God has to break you sometimes you wonder why you have to fall sometimes because his word must accomplish it must be completed what he sent it for and sometimes we're not walking in the program of God we're not seeing and Understanding God's will for our lives so he has to redirect us listen Peter said rejoice when trials and troubles come in our lives Rejoice because it's God's favor upon us I love those who I rebuke and I chase and I love you he says and I love that I never I couldn't say that for many many years but I love that oh and God's chastening comes upon me and and he he he just grabbing my attention doing things to stir my life up and turn it around oh yeah it's not funny in the flesh it's not doesn't feel good in the flesh but in my soul all is well God is interested in me God's favors with me he's paying attention to me and that's the greatest thing to a sudden daughter of God when God turns his face towards you and looks towards you Hallelujah I have chosen you you haven't chosen me I've chosen you Oh Glory to God that's enough when you recognize that oh thankful you talk about being thankful oh my God Jesus yes Lord Satan hindering us so we know when we are hindered or distracted or LED away and other priorities or something else but the word of God in order for the word of God to take effect we must be in the word feeding on the word expecting the word to be revealed and to be made known to us you see the difference expecting the word to be revealed it may known to us when I read the scriptures when I put on a tape and I listen when I go down into prayer I expect God to meet me there I expect the word to open up to me something Lord give me something that I can feed on my soul can rest and strength upon especially in times of trouble and need and he never fails we're serving a living God here behind the veil Hallelujah amen thank you Lord in second Timothy 3 the Apostle Paul describes the nature of people in the last days in this description he warns a people who are characterized as having a form of godliness but denying the power to live this word he's warning the Church of the Living God he's warning the bride and even more so in this message having a form of godliness you're you're formed up as a message believer oh you you you you you automatically by the law dress yourself with the law of the word but deny the power that's what we're talking about here today the power and the seed the night of power to live this word I want to live this word I want to become this word I want this word to have preemness in my life I don't want my life anymore you talk like this out there maybe even some of you are thinking it right now you're crazy to you I am to you I am and that's fine that's a compliment to me thank you the spirit is still a discerner in verse 5 he tells Timothy devoid those who State they are Christians with their mouths and have a form of godliness but who act as unbelievers they deny the power of godliness those who have a form of godliness and those who make an outward display of religion they present themselves as golly but it is all for show there is no power behind their religion as evidence in fact that their lives are unchanged they speak of God and live in sin and they are fine with that arrangement yes living in sin is living in unbelief and what are we talking about Who We Are thus faith when when you don't recognize who you are or don't believe what the word says you are that's that's what makes the difference here it's not whether you're better than me or I'm better than you I'm more holier than you you're more holier than me that's not that's not what is that's not what's being judged here by the by the word of God and the word of God judges all things and judgment starts in the house of the Lord with the word of God that's not what being judged here it's whether you believe what has been spoken of you whether you believe the prophecies that have been spoken about you that you are those prophecies that you and the word are one in the same for this day and for this hour that you are the one that's going to produce a body change listen there's seven billion people on the Earth and if there's only one out of a million you know that makes it 7 000 people that are going to be going and there's approximately two or three million people in this message but let me tell you this morning by the grace of God that I'm one of those 7 000 people that are going and if you don't believe it that way then what are you believing for what are you believing for what are you coming to church for if you don't believe that you're one of those Hallelujah thank you Lord this is the hour of perfect faith so more faith is needed to overcome the Flesh and the world modern vents made clear by Vindicated prophecy we are awake we have been ordained to be awake in this hour away from all the lies and to recognize the revealed truth to to awaken to our calling in our position Awakening and recognizing our true identity in Christ The Awakening of the Bride is happening it's here it's now that's what that's what's been taking place whether you fully understand it or not truth that is being revealed to you God dealing with your life dealing with areas of your life and showing you this showing you that you know back in the beginning we're you know we pray God moves this happens that happens over here we talk about this we listen to this we come to church we hear the word being preached Vindication after Vindication is happening all the time you see you started Awakening you started recognizing something you don't fully understand what it is you don't fully understand and see who you are but you're seeing a lot of different things but you can't place it all together but let me tell you the words coming in this hour by the spirit of God not by men but by his Spirit his spirit is preaching amen the word of God Paul says I Don't Preach in word but I preach in spirit and in truth what is the truth when they ask Jesus Jesus said I am the truth the way in the life he goes what is truth I asked you this morning what is truth what is truth under the word of God what is truth to you in the word and what you've been receiving all these years what is truth to you Hallelujah I know what truth is I'm not going to answer for me you answer for yourself what is truth for you Hallelujah God knows and he discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart and motives he knows the people who want to go behind the veil and see that word he knows the people that are desperate and that are persevering and that are pressing into the kingdom he knows like Jacob Jacob wrestled with that angel Jacob wanted that Birthright let me tell you young people old people you got to be like Jacob you gotta want that Birthright you've got to want to know what has taken place here because his head even this morning it's hid the word is hid behind a veil this morning and only he can open that Veil and let you see behind that Veil the word of God the word of life but you got to be like Jacob you got to wrestle and say Lord I'm not letting you go you imagine that he fought with an angel an angel he's a human he fought with an angel he said I ain't letting you go he knew he could be destroyed he could be ripped apart he could be dead but he said I ain't letting you go until you give me my Birthright my right birth I want it never going to come any other way my brothers and sisters not going to come any other way and each process of your walk even if you bent birth each process of your walk has to come the same way Hallelujah we're going to fight until the day we leave here but we're going to fight in the flesh we're going to fight in this Dimension but inside all is well all is well I have crossed the ribbon Vale where the glories never fail I'm hidden with god with the Shekinah Glory there's rest there's peace there's healing there's comfort in there hallelujah oh glory to God thank you Lord God is just not on my mind all the time but God is my mind the mind of Christ is me Hallelujah oh it's always living in every moment and constantly changing and coming through every channel of the ten senses to my soul the seed of God to bring the word to manifestation amen oh yes that's what it is to a child and of God he's not only on my mind oh I think about God I hear all people saying that I think about God all day long and they go do this and they go do that he is my mind he wants to be your mind that's why he said put on the mind of Christ put away your mind die out to yourself lose everything about yourself the greatest Revelation you can catch today to realize that you need to dial to yourself that you're no good in yourself in your flesh I'm talking about and realize that you need him Hallelujah if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead his dead body if it be in you Jesus Christ was the first one to come to maturity and he was waived over every seed of God and the prophet came to maturity and his sinful flesh and was waved over the bride and still is until the same overcoming power is restored in her to her to bring her flesh under control and being waved to this dying generation I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ is the next wave she that is happening now because it's Christ in her waving himself again she's coming to that maturity she's coming to that place my brothers and sisters oh yes oh yes I don't I I you know it's such a fine line it's such a fine line Jesus didn't have a problem saying I and the father are one and the same but it's such a fine line when you say in this day look at all the confusion that has happened around the prophet's message with calling him deity saying everything that he said was thus saith the Lord that's impossible because if he's everything that he said was thus saved the Lord he would be God and that's what they make him God but she is when the veil is over people's eyes and that Veil is not rent to see what was behind him you see god Jehovah poured himself into Christ poured himself into the church the Holy Ghost and that's what it is Christ The Mighty Angel poured himself into the prophet Hallelujah and now Christ has poured himself into the bride Hallelujah Hallelujah brother George said it last night is going to come a time it's coming right now where where where where these manifestations of of the prophecies are going to be start being fulfilled in her life and people are going to say you say you're that you see you're the yes he said I'm not Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Lord I still got a few minutes here amen we read in James 1 2-4 consider it pure joy my brothers and sisters when You Face many trials because you know the testing of your faith produces perseverance well it produces perseverance thank you Lord that's what we need and let perseverance finish its work and ripping the veils and open it up so you can enter in God knows what he's doing God knows what he's doing in your life he knows why you're going through what you're going through he knows exactly where he's leading you we need to surrender into his leading into his hands and just say Lord I let go of my life and surrender to you because I know you know what's best for me Hebrews 12 1 wherefore see and we are so compass with a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith let us lay aside the unbelief that constantly tells us who we are not but let us take the faith hey man let's lay that aside Satan is going to constantly bombard you constantly being bring condemnation upon you and guilt constantly telling you who you're not let me tell you if he's telling you you're not bride is there good evidence that you are because if he's after you he does not got you but if he's not after you that means he's got you you're comfortable I don't hear none of that stuff going on in my life well watch out be careful you might be in his claws his claws of unbelief Hallelujah so let's lay aside everything that comes into our minds and in our hearts everything that Satan tries to speak to us trying to tell us who we're not let's lay all that aside and let us look to him for he's the one that told tells us who we are amen I'm more than a conqueror Hallelujah I'm more than a conqueror Hallelujah he's the one that started my faith he's the one that started Peter's faith look Peter started that Veil started renting and Peter seemed that he was the son of God but then Peter denied him but then Pentecost came and you talk about Pentecost ripping the veil from top to bottom and each in those lives and the pillar of Fire coming down think about it and dwelling over them they got to that place amen pillar fire dwelling over them it didn't stay over them but it went inside of them and that's why they produced a life that they produced after Pentecost that's why the book of Acts produced The Book of Acts Hallelujah so don't get discouraged if you start seeing that he's the son of God that you start seeing that this message is Christ The Living Word and then you fall back into sin or you fall back into uh uh discouragement or anything like that keep pressing through keep walking where can you go listen every child and Son and Daughter of God knows something deep inside and one thing they know like Peter where can we go you have the words of life if they go out from us because they're not of us they've never seen this word of life I went through many things walking this walk for 32 years many things that could have took me out many times I was down but it always came back where can I go you got the words of Life This Is The Word of Life Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord amen oh Hallelujah amen the human being is made up just like a grain of wheat it's a seed the human being is a seed and any seed has a shell on it on the outside the inside pulp and inside the pulp is the German life we are Body Soul and Spirit you find out that the outside body has five senses that contact we're contacted by which is see taste feel smell in here that's the five senses that control the body inside the body is the soul and that soul is controlled by imagination conscience memory reason and affections and that's our battle those 10 senses but God has given us a word he said the prophet said that God gave him the greatest battle ever fought message and said bring it to the church and let me tell you this is the Avenue this is the instruction if you catch it by faith that God has given us so that that word become flesh in US Hallelujah this will always be our battle and this is where brother Branham had Satan's number because he had all these 10 senses under the control of the word of God if they did not agree with the word of God Amen he cast it out that's why he said he doubted his doubts we got to doubt our doubts sometimes sometimes we don't know we don't understand we don't see and doubt comes in in a situation but we gotta doubt those doubts if it don't line up with the word of God because this is God's Channel now listen Hallelujah that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit it only has one sense let's get it he says the spirit has one sense and that sense either dominates it is Faith or doubt now listen to the soul is the spirit and what does the spirit feed on other faith or doubt why do you think the Bible says and Jesus himself says if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not inside of you or it's not inside of you enough you know why because the things of the world your spirit feeds off of that and when your spirit feeds off the things of the world which is doubt it can't bring you faith in the word it can't bring you faith in who you are and what God says you are it brings doubt and unbelief into that channel and then when that happens now it starts going through and feeding through every other channel of those ten senses and you wonder why sometimes you're in the condition that you're in you see that's what God is building soldiers of the cross building an army an invincible Army that's going to take control and Conquer every one of those enemies so that she her spirit only feeds on the word of God she only believes the word of God she never doubts the word of God whatever he speaks she obeys it this might sound crazy to some depending what Veil that is covering you but this is real to the Bride of Jesus Christ oh yes now listen there's only one Avenue that's three more ages God ain't gonna force your hand God ain't going to tell you to come back here the church God ain't going to tell you and twist your arm to read the Bible and all that no he set you free he set everybody free that's why people don't understand why the world is why don't God do this why don't God do that God set everybody free he's given us his word he's given us his word he wants to see with that freedom what you believe what's inside of you what seed is inside of you Hallelujah you can either accept doubt or you can accept Faith either one you want work on that you want to work on therefore Satan began at the principal part to cause the spirit of man to doubt God's word that's where he goes that's where all the distraction in this world is to go to your spirit so that you can doubt who you are doubt the word of God Hallelujah but God began at the principal part laying his word in that spirit but your mind accepts it what is your mind control by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it and brings life into you when that takes place when life comes down that channel into you the word of God is made manifest in you that's how life comes into you it has to come God's provided way through that channel it can't come any other way you can make you can have your own interpretations your own thoughts of what Grace is all about but what Grace really means is not you can do anything you want to do and expect God to do what he said he's going to do but Grace gives you the ability to do what God wants you to do that's what Grace is he gives you the ability to do what God wants you to do so Lord give me Grace in this hour give me Grace in this trial what give me the ability to overcome give me the ability to press through this trial give me the ability to press through this unbelief let's try to hold me and keep me in Chains and bind me down Give Me Your Grace Hallelujah okay Hallelujah thank you Lord from the middle of the heart which is the soul there goes fourth feet in every channel the trouble of it is we're standing here with a lot of Doubt trying to accept that which is out there how can you accept the word how can you accept what's being preached service after service when you're standing there out there except in that you can't it'll never work it'll never mix God's word don't mix with nothing it's got to be God's word or nothing you've got to accept God's word or nothing he won't mix it not even for you not for nobody some people say oh God loves me so much he'll let me do whatever I want to do and mix this and mix that no he won't no I won't he doesn't mix nothing he won't let he won't let a true trial of God you know what a true son and daughter of God don't want to do that anyways that's not in her heart that's not her desire she wants to do his will even Jesus when he was in the garden he says oh if you can remove this cup how many times we say Lord could you remove this cup this trial this pressure upon my life but something inside of you raises up that new birth amen from behind the inner Veil not in my will but thy will be done if I have to suffer whatever I have to go through to bring forth Christ in my life that's what I have to go through he had to suffer he had to die we don't even understand we don't even understand the pain physically that he went through on the cross what he had to go through and he knew it but he still went through it why he had to go through that to bring this to bring you here today to give you what you got in your life if you got something from God because it came from Calvary it came from that sacrifice you think of what he's asking for us to do is nothing you think the trials the Bible says that you go through now they won't compare to the glory I think about when the saints move on and they move into that other dimension what they're going through oh my oh the glory never expected it never even entered in their minds and even in their hearts when they enter to that place Hallelujah that's why we'll we enter in that place you know I told my wife if God's taken me and I interned in that place don't think I'm going to want to come back here no way I won't want to come back here I'm gone as soon as God rips my soul out of this body if it's before the rapture I'm gone I'm not coming back no way this world is not my home I'm just the passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue Hallelujah Oh Heaven is calling us great cloud of witnesses are here this morning I think about all the saints that have gone before us cheering us on I feel it sometimes in the spirit I feel the encouragement they're real just like the angels are real oh encouraging us this morning I can imagine them on the other side brother Peter and all them brother Daniel all of them come on come on keep going come on oh my sister Shirley on the other side well done good and faithful servant preach the word whether they like it or not preach it anyhow glory to God hallelujah this is real

Hallelujah oh my oh you don't mind if I take a drink another thing he must be anointed before he goes in the anointing oil was made with the Rose of Sharon and the crushing of the Rose brought forth perfume and they put it on the oil that ran down Aaron's beard plumbed to the Hem of His Garment this skirt covering all over him with that anointing oil I just don't want a little bit from head to toe that that anointing oil but remember it has to be crushed it has to be crushed are you willing to go through Garden of Gethsemane are you willing to pick up your cross it's been our theme in this ministry all these years take up your cross and follow Jesus Hallelujah that anointing oil walking right live and write not you not anointing oil move and ripe dress and write there he went taken before him the blood as he went behind the curtain into the third room there was a veil that dropped behind him and that the outside world could not see him no more oh Hallelujah what a place for a Believer to get with with the Lord walking that close with God that that curtain shuts and the world don't see you anymore you're veiled to everything everybody you're veiled behind with the Shekinah Glory your neighbors look at you people your workplaces look at you they look at a veil walking around but behind that temple veil and that Tabernacle was the pillar of fire the Shekinah Glory behind that that people could not see that people were not permitted to see that back in that day or else they died even come close to that they'll die and those who touch my anointed ones and do them harm it'd be better if Millstone was cast around their neck and be cast in the middle of the sea it was the same back in that day because that Pillar of Fire that Veil is here today it's not me it's not any one of us it's Christ you don't say nothing against me this morning you're saying against Christ the word Hallelujah let us stand invite the mission's up Hallelujah every man or boy or woman or girl that ever is Anointed of God and Walks Behind that temple veil of God the Holy Ghost puts them in a secret place that Veil drops behind him and the world and all the things of the world are cut off behind him Hallelujah that's the reason brethren that we're holding up this adoption this this rapture we got to get these differences these fussing all these things out of our lives and get that Veil drop behind us and go into the presence of God where the Shekinah Glory is Hallelujah thank you no thank you Lord the Rapture is here now in the bride the overcoming power is here now in the

she will be called the overcomer in this day and age to him that overcometh we are Overcomers there is nothing that we're not going to overcome we're going to overcome everything and the Rapture is going to prove that that nothing is going to Hold Us Down nothing this ain't gonna hold us this world ain't gonna hold us all the powers of hell ain't going to hold us for the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against her nothing could harm her when you're shut away with God you are with God you and God become one and who is greater than God who can stand before God who compares to God who can

experienced and seen here today is a spiritual battle while the brother was preaching his message as he tried to deliver that message the devil of course tried to put a very oppressive Spirit down on the congregation and not only does he have to preach but you have to start understanding you need to pray and you need to push that Spirit out of here while he is waving The Sword and battling his way through it all you don't just leave the preacher or you're in a bathroom real and because one soldier Got The Bravery to run out ahead and start firing the gun you leave we all got to charge the enemy and drive him out of the camp are you willing to do that amen that's what we have to do praise God but somebody had to portray that so you can see the manifestation of the word that is put a blessing and it's also a battle and we are part of it amen we are all a part of it praise the Lord so whenever Ministry comes here brings glory to the name of the Lord but the beauty of it is that when the battle is over we will bear a crown praise the Lord hallelujah just for a short while and I'll give it over and when the battle's over we're a crown [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in
