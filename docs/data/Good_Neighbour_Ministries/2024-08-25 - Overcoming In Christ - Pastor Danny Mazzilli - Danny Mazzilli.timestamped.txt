[40:34] he can meet your needs and you
[40:36] definitely need to hear this word today
[40:38] amen because we're going to be talking
[40:40] about overcoming in Christ you know
[40:43] we're living in a day where uh
[40:46] overcoming is something that you know
[40:48] people they talk about it they speak
[40:50] about it but you know there's only one
[40:53] way to truly overcome in the age that
[40:57] that you are living in and that is in
[41:02] Christ let's read our
[41:04] scripture slide three 1
[41:07] John 4:
[41:11] 1-4 says beloved believe not every
[41:16] Spirit but try the spirits whether they
[41:18] are of God because many false prophets
[41:22] are gone out into the world hereby know
[41:26] ye the spirit of of God every spirit
[41:29] that confesseth that Jesus Christ is
[41:33] come in the flesh is of
[41:39] god listen carefully I'm going to repeat
[41:41] that statement every spirit that
[41:45] confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in
[41:49] the flesh is of God and the Bible says
[41:53] and the Word was with God the Word was
[41:57] God God and the Word was made flesh and
[42:01] dwelt Among Us so who is the word it's
[42:05] Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ the
[42:08] self-existent one Elohim the one that
[42:12] was the word in the beginning that
[42:14] created all of Heaven all that's on the
[42:17] earth everything that that is consists
[42:21] of Jesus
[42:23] Christ and so and every Spirit now
[42:26] listen here now and every spirit that
[42:28] confesseth
[42:30] not that Jesus Christ is come in the
[42:34] flesh is not of
[42:36] God and this is that Spirit of
[42:40] antichrist whereby ye have heard that it
[42:43] should come and even now now already is
[42:49] in the
[42:50] world ye are of God little children and
[42:55] have overcome them
[42:58] because greater is he that is in
[43:02] you that is in you amen that is in you
[43:08] and you and you and every one of you
[43:10] than he that is in the world let us pray
[43:15] father we so appreciate you this morning
[43:18] Lord and father we're we're excited this
[43:20] morning to know that you're mindful of
[43:23] every need and every situation and the
[43:26] circumstances that we are all facing
[43:28] because I know we're all overcoming
[43:31] something Lord and we're asking you to
[43:33] come and give us the wisdom the
[43:36] direction and your spirit that gives us
[43:40] the overcoming power in this hour Grant
[43:43] it we pray Lord bless speaker and hearer
[43:48] in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints
[43:50] you may be
[43:52] seated glory to God Amen listen
[43:57] I know that um you
[44:01] know not not uh um everybody likes to
[44:04] hear these you know these these kinds of
[44:07] scriptures you know sometimes people get
[44:10] you know a little bit um red up and you
[44:13] know they just um don't want to hear
[44:16] about the Antichrist they don't want to
[44:18] hear about you know that uh that that
[44:20] that God is is almighty God and that
[44:23] he's and his name is Jesus Christ you
[44:26] got so many different interpretations on
[44:28] the word of God and and and and about
[44:31] God in the world today and so there's
[44:33] there's you know people that are Buddha
[44:36] people that are Hindu people that are
[44:38] that are Muslim people that that that
[44:40] believe in the Trinity people that that
[44:42] believe in Jehovah Witness and you've
[44:44] got all these different interpretations
[44:46] on the word of God but when somebody
[44:48] comes out and brings the word pure right
[44:52] from the scripture amen it it it stirs
[44:55] Hearts it stir individuals and it stirs
[44:59] Spirits amen praise God but we know we
[45:03] know that the word of God is is is
[45:06] perfect it's true it's just amen you
[45:10] know it was CS Lewis you know people
[45:14] don't like hearing about Satan they
[45:15] don't like hearing about hell but it was
[45:17] CS Lewis in his book in screw tape
[45:21] letters he wrote indeed the safest Road
[45:25] to Hell is the gradual
[45:29] one one the gentle
[45:35] slope slope
[45:37] underfoot without sudden turnings
[45:40] without Milestones without
[45:43] signposts although a born again believer
[45:47] has no fear of death and hell you must
[45:50] watch out for the oppressing burden of a
[45:53] spirit whose entire purpose
[45:58] listen the enemy's entire purpose from
[46:01] when Jesus walked on the Earth from when
[46:04] Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden
[46:07] his entire purpose was to cause you
[46:12] cause anyone that believes and confesses
[46:15] that Jesus Christ is Lord caused them to
[46:18] what
[46:22] fall gradual you know you look into the
[46:25] world everything is just you know like
[46:27] look these elections are are are you
[46:30] know really I mean you could get caught
[46:32] up watching these elections it's almost
[46:34] entertaining yes amen you know but it's
[46:38] serious too because this world is in a
[46:40] mess you've got a nation in the United
[46:43] States of America that's completely
[46:46] divided you've got you've got uh um uh
[46:50] so much going on where you know this
[46:52] political party is bashing that the
[46:55] Democrats are bashing the Republic
[46:56] Republicans the Republicans are bashing
[46:59] the Democrats and they're in a war and
[47:02] the people are trying to find out you
[47:04] know so many people one minute they're
[47:06] on this side the next day they're on
[47:08] that side they can't figure out what
[47:10] side to get on because one minute you're
[47:12] hearing and the way they bring these
[47:15] these accusations against each of the
[47:18] you know the the the the presidential
[47:20] candidates and their and their parties
[47:22] and so forth you wonder my goodness who
[47:26] do you believe
[47:28] aren't you glad you believe the true
[47:31] report listen no matter who goes into
[47:33] government whether it's Trump or whether
[47:35] it's Harris I'm telling you there's a
[47:38] power behind
[47:42] it which is which is not of
[47:46] God I'm just going to tell you the way
[47:48] it is amen we're going to be looking at
[47:50] it today amen we're going to see certain
[47:52] things today that that we're going to
[47:54] realize that no matter which side gets
[47:56] into the power there's a higher power
[47:59] that that that that is that is evil that
[48:02] is powers and principalities and
[48:04] dominions amen and Satan is the head of
[48:07] it all but there's one more power that
[48:10] goes above that one there and that's the
[48:12] one that we serve amen and so you can
[48:15] know and rest assure that you are in
[48:18] safe hands and your future I know the
[48:22] Americans are wondering about you know
[48:24] they they keep saying an America a
[48:26] future for America a future for the
[48:29] people of America and that's what
[48:31] they're promoting they want a future but
[48:33] I'm telling you there is no future but
[48:37] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[48:40] the government shall be upon his
[48:42] shoulders and that government will reign
[48:46] for 1,000 years right here on the earth
[48:48] amen praise God Amen let's let's move
[48:51] along here I want you to notice here
[48:53] we're talking about overcoming today how
[48:56] many needs to overcome how many wants to
[48:59] know how to overcome it's one thing to
[49:02] overcome and one thing to know that you
[49:04] need to overcome and even the
[49:06] circumstances that you need to overcome
[49:08] but it's a better thing to know how amen
[49:12] praise God and so I I truly believe that
[49:15] that we need to uh dig a little deeper
[49:18] into this and we'll see where we get
[49:19] today and how far this is going to go
[49:22] but I believe there might be you know
[49:24] one or two or maybe a couple of more
[49:26] services amen but let's just see what
[49:28] the Lord is going to do and so let's go
[49:31] to the next slide in Revelations uh
[49:34] chapter 2 verse 7 in in now I want you
[49:37] to see here that we're going to be
[49:38] looking at each of the church ages and
[49:40] each messenger we're not going to be
[49:42] looking specifically and in depth but I
[49:44] want to bring something to your
[49:46] attention here there are things that are
[49:49] promised to the
[49:50] Overcomer I want you to know that you
[49:53] can overcome and you can know that there
[49:56] are bless
[49:57] blessings that come from overcoming amen
[50:01] praise God and here the Lord is speaking
[50:04] and it's red letter because it's the
[50:05] Lord that's speaking in the Book of
[50:07] Revelation here chapter 2 and he's
[50:10] speaking to the to the first church in
[50:12] Ephesus and he says he that hath an ear
[50:15] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[50:17] the churches to him that
[50:20] overcometh there's got to be an
[50:22] overcoming every age had to overcome the
[50:26] spirits and the age and the oppression
[50:29] and the lies and the deception of the
[50:32] enemy I want you to see this is a this
[50:35] this is a a a a strain that started
[50:39] right back in the Garden of Eden and
[50:41] it's going to end up right here right
[50:43] now in this generation it's going to be
[50:47] it's going to be an overcoming amen for
[50:50] every individual that's called to each
[50:54] dispensation and time that you're living
[50:57] in and he says to him that overcometh
[51:01] will I give to eat of the Tree of Life
[51:04] Oh Glory to God which is in the midst of
[51:07] the paradise of God do you know that
[51:09] Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden
[51:11] and they were feeding off of the Tree of
[51:14] Life God would come you know who the
[51:16] tree of life is right it's it's God it's
[51:19] Jesus Christ he is he is the one that's
[51:22] going to feed us that you know the
[51:24] Revelation that you're that you're
[51:26] receiving right now you think oh wow
[51:28] praise God what a mighty God we serve
[51:31] Revelation that's going to give us the
[51:33] strength to overcome the Gates of Hell
[51:35] will not Prevail against God's
[51:38] revelation directly to you directly from
[51:41] God but you're going to be feeding on
[51:43] that for eternity
[51:47] amen sometimes you know you go to an
[51:49] event and the event is fantastic and my
[51:52] God you have such a great time but then
[51:54] it comes to an end well there's an event
[51:58] which is called feeding on the
[52:00] revelation of God's word that'll never
[52:03] stop it'll take you and Quicken you
[52:06] right out of this Dimension into another
[52:09] dimension it's going to be a lot better
[52:11] than this it only gets better you think
[52:14] this is good you think you're going to
[52:15] be excited by the word today it only
[52:18] gets better praise God forever more and
[52:21] so we're going to be feeding from the
[52:23] Tree of Life you know that tree is an
[52:25] eternal tree it's the tree that only
[52:28] those that are that are branches like
[52:31] Jesus said I am the branch ye are the
[52:34] Vine I am the vine ye are the branches
[52:36] only the branches that come from that
[52:39] tree can actually feed on that tree
[52:43] that's why you know he keeps saying to
[52:45] them that overcome but guess what you're
[52:48] designed to
[52:49] overcome you were designed before the
[52:52] foundations of the world to come into
[52:54] this age this dispensation
[52:57] this world condition and don't tell me
[53:00] that the world is not in chaos and in
[53:02] trouble Wars and everything else that's
[53:04] going on but you were designed to come
[53:07] into this time to
[53:10] overcome and that's why you're going to
[53:13] feed on the tree of life and that's why
[53:15] you're feeding on the tree of life amen
[53:18] cuz you've already
[53:19] overcome this is the Paradox amen go to
[53:23] the next slide
[53:27] Suna he that hath an ear to
[53:29] hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith
[53:33] unto the churches he that overcometh
[53:36] shall not be hurt by the second death
[53:39] you see samna that was the age that was
[53:42] a dark age and a lot of the Saints their
[53:47] fulfillment and
[53:49] manifestation of fulfilling the word in
[53:51] their day was death they would have to
[53:56] die for the gospel and millions of
[54:01] Christians were put to death in that
[54:03] dispensation in in that age but God
[54:08] promised them that you're going to
[54:11] overcome and when you overcome you're
[54:13] not going to be affected by the second
[54:15] death that's the one that that's the one
[54:17] that kills the soul that's the one that
[54:21] puts you right back into the Lake of
[54:23] Fire you know hell is not Eternal let's
[54:27] make it clear here there's no such thing
[54:30] as an eternal hell people talk about it
[54:33] they say you know but there's no such
[54:35] thing God created those that would have
[54:39] a beginning and would have an
[54:42] end okay so anything that has an end
[54:46] cannot be Eternal because Eternal has no
[54:49] beginning no end so hell is not
[54:53] somewhere Eternal but it is a place
[54:57] that's not going to be fun and that a
[55:00] lot of people that rejected the word of
[55:02] God are going to be in that place I
[55:05] don't know how long but it's not going
[55:07] to be Eternal they had a beginning after
[55:10] the great white Jo uh White Throne
[55:12] judgment and everything else some will
[55:15] be cast into the Lake of Fire well guess
[55:18] the Lake of Fire is Christ it's God he
[55:21] is an all-consuming fire and so if you
[55:24] had a beginning you're G to have an end
[55:26] and so your beginning was here on the
[55:28] Earth but some people that had a
[55:30] beginning and came into this Dimension
[55:32] as human beings they will reject and
[55:35] deny and just like the scripture says
[55:38] they will say that Jesus Christ did not
[55:41] come God did not die for me he did he is
[55:46] not my
[55:48] savior and to
[55:53] them guess what they don't go in the
[55:57] Blessed place they don't go to the
[56:00] redeemed they don't go to Glory they're
[56:03] going to have to face whatever they did
[56:06] they're going to be judged at the white
[56:08] Throne judgment according to the works
[56:11] in their flesh that's what the scripture
[56:13] says a lot of people oh I never killed
[56:16] anybody oh you know Danny I know you go
[56:19] to church a lot but you know I want you
[56:20] to know I I never killed anybody like
[56:23] killing somebody you know like Paul turn
[56:26] around and tell him right away well
[56:27] what's that got to do with it Paul who
[56:29] wrote most of the New Testament killed a
[56:31] lot of people so what are you trying to
[56:33] tell me he was saved he killed a lot of
[56:37] people if you don't accept Jesus Christ
[56:39] right now like the way Paul got knocked
[56:41] off his horse and accept Jesus Christ in
[56:44] in in today in the power of his
[56:47] resurrection today you're lost If you
[56:50] deny the word of God you're lost I'm not
[56:53] going to say that to them but that's
[56:55] what the scripture
[56:57] says because we can't tell we listen you
[57:00] don't know who's lost and who's not so
[57:03] don't be going out there thinking
[57:05] because you believe this message and
[57:06] this word that you can identify lost
[57:10] saved lost saved bride foolish
[57:15] virgin get away from all of that
[57:18] nonsense just feed on the word of God
[57:21] and you will be exactly who you're
[57:23] supposed to be and they will manifest
[57:26] exactly who they're supposed to be but
[57:29] all I can say is that if you overcome
[57:32] you don't face the second death because
[57:34] all of these promises I want you to know
[57:37] they all come down and they all come
[57:40] down upon the Believers in this day and
[57:42] in this hour am amen next
[57:46] slide in pergamus he says he that hath
[57:49] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[57:51] saith unto the churches to him that
[57:53] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[57:56] hidden Mana Oh Glory to God and will
[57:59] give him a white stone and in the stone
[58:02] a new name written which no man knoweth
[58:05] saving he that receiveth it Oh Glory to
[58:10] God my God we could preach a sermon
[58:12] right there amen your name was written
[58:15] in the Lamb's Book of Life when before
[58:18] the foundations of the world you might
[58:21] have come down on this Earth as Gabriel
[58:23] Fetti but really back there you are an
[58:27] attribute of God and God's got another
[58:29] name for you although I think his name
[58:31] might end up being
[58:33] Gabriel because he's a messenger like
[58:35] nobody else Hallelujah I thank God for
[58:38] Gabriel the messenger amen praise God so
[58:42] I believe that you know we are feasting
[58:45] now on this this wonderful revelation of
[58:48] knowing who we are and that we actually
[58:51] feed on hidden Mana every time we come
[58:53] into the house of the Lord because what
[58:55] is the hidden Mana it's a revelation of
[58:58] the word it's the understanding of the
[59:02] word that when you talk to somebody and
[59:05] you tell them about you know you need to
[59:07] be baptized as an adult in the name of
[59:11] the Lord Jesus Christ just according to
[59:13] acts chap
[59:15] 2:38 just the way Paul told it in Acts
[59:18] chapter uh 19 you know like the water
[59:23] the baptism in the name of the Lord
[59:25] Jesus Christ and you tell them that but
[59:28] yet for some reason they can't see it
[59:32] you tell them about the God Head he's
[59:35] not a trinity it is one God I am one he
[59:42] told the children of Israel here ye oh
[59:44] Israel the Lord iy God is one not two
[59:48] three you see but you need a revelation
[59:51] on that where God reveals it into your
[59:54] heart it's the hidden Mana that you're
[59:57] feeding on right now and it brings you
[1:00:00] into Christ and if you're in Christ
[1:00:04] you're ordained to overcome am
[1:00:07] Hallelujah so only those that receive it
[1:00:10] are going to know and I know that I know
[1:00:12] and I know that you that know that you
[1:00:14] know where you stand you know that this
[1:00:17] word is a reality you know that it's not
[1:00:20] just some other church that you joined
[1:00:22] amen praise God let's go to the next
[1:00:24] slide in thara he says and he that
[1:00:27] overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the
[1:00:30] end to him will I give power over
[1:00:33] Nations and he shall rule them with a
[1:00:36] rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter
[1:00:40] shall they be broken to Shivers even as
[1:00:43] I received of my father and I will give
[1:00:46] him the Morning Star he that hath an ear
[1:00:50] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[1:00:52] unto the churches that in a nutshell is
[1:00:55] saying I'm going to come in you I am
[1:00:58] going to rule and Reign on this Earth
[1:01:04] and you are going to be able to rule and
[1:01:07] Reign your
[1:01:09] life your
[1:01:11] world your
[1:01:14] circumstances because he's going to
[1:01:17] place himself the morning star in you
[1:01:21] that's your overcoming power you
[1:01:24] overcome you you you you you receive the
[1:01:27] blessing that comes with overcoming
[1:01:30] don't think it strange Saints when
[1:01:33] you're under circumstances and and
[1:01:35] trials and oh why did this come to me
[1:01:38] why did this have to happen to me why
[1:01:40] did this circumstance why did this bill
[1:01:43] all of a sudden show up because God
[1:01:46] wants you to
[1:01:48] overcome God wants you to know that
[1:01:51] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:01:53] that is in the world and when you
[1:01:56] recognize that there's a there's an
[1:01:58] anointing that comes upon you and
[1:02:01] there's a quickening that happens in
[1:02:03] your life that you can't you can't
[1:02:06] interpret that I'm not going to try to
[1:02:08] interpret that but you're being changed
[1:02:12] you're being transformed you're being
[1:02:15] translated into another dimension every
[1:02:18] time you
[1:02:19] overcome that's why Peter said count it
[1:02:22] all
[1:02:24] joy when you come under to those fiery
[1:02:27] trials because something is happening in
[1:02:30] you that's transforming you Amen to
[1:02:33] become an over to to to show this world
[1:02:36] that you are an
[1:02:39] overcomer but you're doing it in
[1:02:43] Christ next one Sardis he says he that
[1:02:48] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:02:52] white rment and I will not blot out his
[1:02:56] name out of the book of
[1:03:00] life but I will confess his name before
[1:03:02] my father and before his angels he that
[1:03:05] hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what
[1:03:07] the spirit saith unto the churches and
[1:03:09] by the way this is Revelations chapter 3
[1:03:12] verses 4 to 5 that's an error up there I
[1:03:15] corrected it amen praise God so here
[1:03:19] when we look at
[1:03:21] this we can see here that somebody can
[1:03:24] actually be written
[1:03:26] into the book of life now we're not
[1:03:28] talking about the Lamb's Book the Lamb's
[1:03:31] Book of
[1:03:33] Life Is Christ and his attributes you
[1:03:38] had no beginning you can never have an
[1:03:41] end but there are those that are here on
[1:03:44] this Earth that are going to a lot of
[1:03:46] the different Christian churches sincere
[1:03:50] people sincere but there there listen
[1:03:54] there's categories Within in the
[1:03:56] Christian Body of
[1:03:59] Christ worldwide Christian churches and
[1:04:03] so forth and there are those that are
[1:04:06] sincerely living good Christian lives
[1:04:09] even better than some of
[1:04:12] you but by the grace of
[1:04:15] God you're an attribute whose name was
[1:04:18] written in the Lamb's Book of Life you
[1:04:21] need to do some research and read on
[1:04:23] that I don't want to get into into a
[1:04:26] indepth study on it but there are those
[1:04:29] whose names can be blotted out of the
[1:04:31] book of life that's those that all exist
[1:04:36] and consist by the life of God because
[1:04:39] everything lives by God Amen and there
[1:04:43] are going to be a lot of people that
[1:04:46] that are going to be saved that are
[1:04:49] not the
[1:04:53] bride okay there's going to be people
[1:04:56] saved that are going to go to heaven
[1:04:58] that are going to be in heaven but
[1:05:00] they're not going to be the bride
[1:05:03] they're going to be servants they're
[1:05:06] going to be those that were good brother
[1:05:08] Bram says you're going to be shocked
[1:05:10] when you get there there's going to be
[1:05:12] people there that you didn't know would
[1:05:15] would you thought oh maybe they weren't
[1:05:17] going to make it listen I believe my
[1:05:19] whole family is going to be there if
[1:05:21] they're not in the bride they're going
[1:05:22] to be there anyway Hallelujah praise God
[1:05:26] I I believe we should all love our
[1:05:29] families and and treat them as though
[1:05:31] they're going to be there because you
[1:05:33] don't know who is and who
[1:05:35] isn't you need to express Christ in the
[1:05:39] love of God and you need to express that
[1:05:41] love towards them you need to stay with
[1:05:43] the word okay because you're designed
[1:05:47] remember you you were ordained to
[1:05:49] receive this messag amen you you
[1:05:52] couldn't miss it I couldn't miss it
[1:05:54] there's just no way because because it's
[1:05:56] not given by intellect it's not
[1:05:59] intellectually taught it's not you know
[1:06:02] forced upon anybody no no no no this is
[1:06:04] something that is supernaturally
[1:06:07] revealed by divine revelation it's the
[1:06:10] hidden Mana it's something Jesus said
[1:06:13] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:06:15] unto you but my father my spirit my
[1:06:19] anointing my the Christ has revealed
[1:06:22] this unto you and that's why no matter
[1:06:26] what anybody tells you you just stand on
[1:06:29] the word of God Amen because you know
[1:06:32] where you're standing he said the Gates
[1:06:34] of Hell will not Prevail against this
[1:06:37] way of divinely revealing himself to
[1:06:41] each individual that's why don't be
[1:06:43] trying to force people come to my church
[1:06:47] I don't I'm I'm not forcing anybody but
[1:06:50] if you hear his voice he that hath an
[1:06:52] ear oh boy come on now he that ear let
[1:06:56] him hear what the spirit is saying amen
[1:06:59] praise God and so let's go to the next
[1:07:02] slide him that overcometh in
[1:07:04] Philadelphia age will I make a pillar in
[1:07:07] the temple of my God and he shall go no
[1:07:11] more out and I will write upon him the
[1:07:14] name of my God Amen praise God and the
[1:07:18] name of the city of my God which is the
[1:07:20] New Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:07:23] Heaven from God and I will write upon
[1:07:27] him my new
[1:07:30] name oh my goodness Hallelujah glory to

[1:07:52] you his name listen when a bride goes to
[1:07:54] the altar
[1:07:56] I mean in the old
[1:07:58] days nowadays they keep their own names
[1:08:00] and you know it's just one of these
[1:08:03] things but the wife would always take
[1:08:06] the husband's name because they two
[1:08:09] became
[1:08:10] one and he was the the the head and and
[1:08:14] and the
[1:08:15] headship like a man you know protects

[1:09:30] is going to defeat and overcome the
[1:09:32] enemy it'll never be anything less than

[1:09:55] your back this
[1:09:57] morning amen let's go to the next slide
[1:10:01] CU this one pertains to this
[1:10:04] hour and this one says behold I stand at
[1:10:08] the door and knock you know that this is
[1:10:11] the only
[1:10:12] age where he's not in the church he's
[1:10:16] actually outside the church and that's
[1:10:19] why we are who we
[1:10:22] are we're non- denominational we're not
[1:10:25] affiliated with anything but the word of
[1:10:28] God somebody says to me well what is
[1:10:29] your church all about I said just read
[1:10:31] the book of Acts it's the acts of the
[1:10:35] holy spirit in the church and the spirit
[1:10:39] of God is still acting in the church and
[1:10:43] if you want to know what he's acting and
[1:10:44] what he's doing then you know what you
[1:10:46] can come to church amen because that's
[1:10:49] what we represent the book of Acts of
[1:10:52] the holy spirit in his discip IES in his
[1:10:57] Apostles in his five-fold ministry amen
[1:11:00] praise God so he's outside of the
[1:11:03] churches
[1:11:05] today and he's sitting there and he's
[1:11:08] knocking to say hey there's a message in
[1:11:11] the land amen praise God that's calling
[1:11:14] a people back to the original word back
[1:11:18] to the faith of the fathers amen and God
[1:11:21] has sent us a Prophet by the name of
[1:11:23] William Branham another messenger
[1:11:26] another church age messenger just like
[1:11:29] there was one for each and every one of
[1:11:31] these ages here Martin Luther broke away
[1:11:34] from the Catholic church he was the
[1:11:37] messenger to
[1:11:39] the Sardis or no the the uh let me just
[1:11:44] go back here not Philadelphia because
[1:11:47] that was Wesley
[1:11:48] Sardis okay Martin Luther he was the
[1:11:52] messenger to the Sardis age and he he
[1:11:55] went right up before the Catholic church
[1:11:57] and all of their dignitaries and he says
[1:11:59] hold on a minute here the just shall
[1:12:03] live by their own revelation of the word
[1:12:07] of God not by what you're saying by what
[1:12:11] you're interpreting we don't have how
[1:12:13] come how come the people don't have
[1:12:15] their own Bibles the people need to read
[1:12:18] the word for themselves because Faith
[1:12:21] cometh by hearing the word and when you
[1:12:25] you're actually hearing the word
[1:12:27] too and so Luther broke away from the
[1:12:30] church and he was the messenger to that
[1:12:32] age well Wesley come along to the
[1:12:35] Philadelphia age and he says hey hang on
[1:12:37] a minute here you guys got Revelation
[1:12:40] now you know who you are you know that
[1:12:42] you need you know this personal
[1:12:44] relationship with Jesus Christ and you
[1:12:46] don't need a mediator between you and
[1:12:49] Christ okay but you need to sanctify
[1:12:52] your lives he was all about
[1:12:54] sanctification ation about cleaning up
[1:12:56] your lives you know you're cheating
[1:12:58] you're stealing you're drinking you're
[1:12:59] smoking you're you're doing all these
[1:13:01] things and taking other wives and other
[1:13:03] men's wives and all this no you got to
[1:13:05] sanctify your life and allow the Holy
[1:13:09] Spirit to live now you're not going to
[1:13:10] be perfect there's nobody perfect you're
[1:13:12] not going to be perfect until you leave
[1:13:14] this place you're going to have to
[1:13:17] overcome amen praise God but God has
[1:13:22] given us that ability by sending us a
[1:13:25] messenger in our day in the 20th century
[1:13:29] by the name of William brandham that
[1:13:31] restored the word of God you go back and
[1:13:33] study you know that's why we quote
[1:13:36] things that that he that he that he
[1:13:39] preached and that he wrote because they
[1:13:42] are relevant today amen they are they
[1:13:46] are truths that pertain to the church
[1:13:49] for this day and for this
[1:13:51] hour we don't make William brandham the
[1:13:54] absolute
[1:13:56] we recognize the Fulfillment of
[1:13:58] scripture just like we recognize Moses
[1:14:01] Elijah all the other prophets of the Old
[1:14:04] Testament they were prophets but we by
[1:14:07] the grace of God had one come to America
[1:14:11] Hallelujah in the 20th century and if
[1:14:14] you go back and study that life you will
[1:14:17] see clearly that it was a Supernatural
[1:14:20] Ministry there's no way you could see it
[1:14:23] any other way you might still deny it
[1:14:26] you might call it a cult you might call
[1:14:28] I don't care what you want to call it if
[1:14:30] if you're calling it a cult or you're
[1:14:32] calling it and denying it is because you
[1:14:35] do not have a revelation of it that's
[1:14:38] the difference it's not been revealed to
[1:14:41] you that's why to them that hath an ear
[1:14:45] unto you it has been given to know the
[1:14:49] mysteries of the Kingdom amen glory to
[1:14:52] God he revealed and fulfilled Rev
[1:14:55] Gans 10: 1 to7 amen you can go back and
[1:15:00] look up all of those things but here now
[1:15:03] here Jesus is standing outside of the
[1:15:06] church in the leodan church age which is
[1:15:09] the age that we are now translating from
[1:15:13] okay we're we're we're in transition
[1:15:16] right now we're in the
[1:15:18] Rapture actually you know those that are
[1:15:20] alive and remain they shall be caught up
[1:15:22] together to meet those that those you
[1:15:24] know
[1:15:25] all of that is it's all in progress
[1:15:27] right
[1:15:28] now one's going to be taken one's going
[1:15:31] to be left one's going to be in the
[1:15:33] field the other one's going to be left
[1:15:35] you see that's all happening it already
[1:15:37] happened in your life and in my life and
[1:15:39] that's why you're here the Holy Spirit
[1:15:42] already called you pulled you out of the
[1:15:44] world snatched you out you know some of
[1:15:46] your family they're saying no thanks you
[1:15:49] say no problem praise God this is where
[1:15:53] I am because this is the voice that I
[1:15:55] heard call my name amen and so this is
[1:15:59] all in progress right now so he's
[1:16:02] knocking at the door aren't you glad
[1:16:04] that you opened that door aren't you
[1:16:06] glad that you were able to hear his
[1:16:09] voice that you know that that he knew
[1:16:11] that the churches would get so out of
[1:16:14] cater that the word of God would become
[1:16:17] of none effect to the people anymore to
[1:16:19] the point where he had to stand outside
[1:16:21] and says I'm not even in those churches
[1:16:24] anymore
[1:16:25] they've they've they've organized me out
[1:16:29] yeah they've made me a trinity they've
[1:16:31] made me one a mighty God and then an
[1:16:33] almighty God they've made me all kinds
[1:16:36] they've made me a New Age movement
[1:16:38] they've made me a just a you know a
[1:16:41] master of the teachings of of of levels
[1:16:45] of conscious they've made him all kinds
[1:16:47] of different interpretations but he says
[1:16:50] I am Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:16:53] today and forever ever and you and my
[1:16:56] sheep will hear my voice no other
[1:17:00] they're going to follow amen so he's
[1:17:02] outside the church and he's knocking but
[1:17:04] you
[1:17:05] answered and because you answered he
[1:17:08] says on that day he shall know that I am
[1:17:09] in the father ye and me and I and you am
[1:17:13] I in you am so that you can overcome the
[1:17:17] things that you have to overcome in the
[1:17:19] age that you're living in you know Jesus
[1:17:22] had to overcome you know that amen
[1:17:25] let's keep going praise
[1:17:28] God listen to brother brandham here next
[1:17:31] slide he says in the leoan church age
[1:17:34] William Bram
[1:17:36] says now what are we to
[1:17:40] overcome this is the normal question to
[1:17:43] ask here but that is not the actual
[1:17:46] thought of this verse for it is not so
[1:17:49] much what we are to overcome but
[1:17:53] how how
[1:17:55] we are to overcome now this is logical
[1:17:58] for does it matter what much what we
[1:18:02] overcome as long as we know how we
[1:18:05] overcome a quick look at those
[1:18:07] scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus
[1:18:10] overcoming will bring out the truth of
[1:18:14] this proposition in Matthew chapter 4
[1:18:17] wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he
[1:18:21] overcame the personal Temptations of
[1:18:23] Satan by by the word and by the word
[1:18:28] only don't you be looking to do or
[1:18:32] overcome anything in this
[1:18:35] world other than by the word of
[1:18:39] God and when I say that a lot of people
[1:18:41] say oh so you just you just got to go to
[1:18:44] the word and and and and only whatever
[1:18:47] the word says that's what you're going
[1:18:48] to do no it means that when you read the
[1:18:52] word and the word is revealed to you
[1:18:55] and it becomes life to you it's no
[1:18:59] longer just quoting a scripture it's
[1:19:02] actually having the ability to live the
[1:19:05] scripture to live because
[1:19:09] Satan he's not interested in how much
[1:19:12] you can quote the
[1:19:15] word just like when he when he when he
[1:19:17] came up against those Sons ofke he says
[1:19:20] Paul I know Jesus I know but who are you
[1:19:24] and he St dripped them he he he slapped
[1:19:27] them around like a couple of uh
[1:19:30] uh
[1:19:31] ding-dongs left them there completely on
[1:19:34] their on their backs not knowing who
[1:19:37] they were because all they could do was
[1:19:39] quote scripture we're not talking about
[1:19:42] quoting scripture we're talking about
[1:19:43] the scripture becoming your life he's he
[1:19:48] listen Satan doesn't want he he's afraid
[1:19:51] of that life he's afraid that you know
[1:19:54] by Revelation who you are and when
[1:19:57] somebody knows who they are they can
[1:19:59] stand in front of a bear and they can
[1:20:02] tell that bear where to go and yell a
[1:20:04] lot louder than that bear and that bear
[1:20:06] will run because of the spirit of God
[1:20:09] because of the anointing because they
[1:20:11] can sense Bears animals they can sense
[1:20:15] that's why dogs I've owned dogs that are
[1:20:17] dangerous dogs German Shepherds but when
[1:20:21] you upsert authority over those dogs by
[1:20:24] the way you speak to them and by the way
[1:20:27] you know that you have authority over
[1:20:29] them they bow they immediately submit
[1:20:34] themselves but if there's any fear in
[1:20:37] you then they know that and they can
[1:20:40] sense it and they will attack you that's
[1:20:42] how the enemy works that's why Satan he
[1:20:45] looks to see if there's fear in you
[1:20:48] that's why don't speak
[1:20:50] fear speak Faith speak the word of God
[1:20:55] God don't speak lack but speak
[1:20:58] Prosperity into your lives I got a bill
[1:21:01] so God is going to bless me with more
[1:21:03] Finance to pay the bill Hallelujah you
[1:21:07] see it's how you approach every
[1:21:10] circumstance and every
[1:21:12] situation it's knowing that the word is
[1:21:15] in you in each of the three major trials
[1:21:19] that corresponded exactly to the
[1:21:21] Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the
[1:21:23] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:21:27] and the pride of life Jesus overcame by
[1:21:32] the
[1:21:33] word eve fell to the personal Temptation
[1:21:37] Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam
[1:21:42] fell in the direct Disobedience to the
[1:21:45] word but Jesus overcame by the word and
[1:21:49] right now let me say that this is the
[1:21:51] only way to be an overcomer amen also is
[1:21:56] it is the only way that you can know if
[1:21:59] you are overcoming because that word
[1:22:03] Can't Fail Oh Glory to God Amen thank
[1:22:08] you Jesus you can leave here today
[1:22:11] fortified by the word of God knowing
[1:22:13] that God listen you can't fail you might
[1:22:16] fall but you ain't going to fail you
[1:22:20] might be knocked down but you ain't
[1:22:22] going to be knocked out Hallelujah
[1:22:25] brother praise God because God is God
[1:22:27] has designed you to be an overcomer amen
[1:22:31] praise God hallelujah next quote here he
[1:22:34] says in his personal life now contending
[1:22:37] with himself now listen Jesus himself he
[1:22:40] overcame by obedience to the word of
[1:22:43] God imagine the word was in the
[1:22:47] beginning the word was made flesh and
[1:22:49] dwelt among us but yet the word had to
[1:22:52] overcome
[1:22:55] that's
[1:22:57] interesting God in
[1:23:00] you because there's a
[1:23:03] connection Jesus would say I do nothing
[1:23:05] L the father reveals
[1:23:08] it I don't do anything unless the father
[1:23:10] shows
[1:23:12] me I and the father are one he had that
[1:23:16] relationship he needed to he needed to
[1:23:19] remind himself because remember he was
[1:23:22] in human flesh listen here he said in
[1:23:24] Hebrews 5:7 it says who in the days of
[1:23:28] his
[1:23:30] flesh when he had offered up prayers and
[1:23:34] supplications with strong crying and
[1:23:37] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:23:40] from death and was heard in that he
[1:23:44] feared he was at the Garden of
[1:23:47] Gethsemane he was he knew what he had to
[1:23:50] go and face he knew what they were going
[1:23:52] to do to him he realized that he was
[1:23:54] going to have to take a beating but he
[1:23:57] came under obedience to the word of God
[1:23:59] Amen praise God listen you are going to
[1:24:02] have to suffer sometimes let's not start
[1:24:04] there just yet though he were a son yet
[1:24:09] learned he obedience by the things which
[1:24:13] he
[1:24:15] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:24:17] became the author of Eternal salvation
[1:24:20] unto all them that obey him
[1:24:24] what was he obedient to the word of God
[1:24:29] a lot of people say the word Danny you
[1:24:31] always talking about the word you're
[1:24:32] talking about the word that is the
[1:24:34] absolute no man is any better than his
[1:24:37] own word hallelujah if you're going to
[1:24:41] trust in something you need an absolute
[1:24:43] in this hour I'll tell you right now
[1:24:45] people out there they're trembling
[1:24:47] they're trembling they look at you and
[1:24:49] they know you're so confident about God
[1:24:51] and you know that you've made him your
[1:24:53] absolute and they know that they don't
[1:24:54] have an absolute their absolute might be
[1:24:57] the doctor's report there my God I hope
[1:24:59] the doctor he's got that that test and
[1:25:03] oh man oh boy if he tells me I got
[1:25:05] cancer I'm done oh boy and all it's all
[1:25:09] fear it's all fear you're all worried
[1:25:11] about this cancer you're worried about
[1:25:13] that when when if you've got Christ and
[1:25:17] you know that you're in Christ you know
[1:25:20] that you've received his word you know
[1:25:23] that you've obeyed his word word you
[1:25:24] know you've come God's provided way
[1:25:27] according to the word then you should be
[1:25:29] able to stand and like the scripture
[1:25:31] says be still and know that I am God and
[1:25:36] I don't change I will be there it might
[1:25:40] be at the last minute might be at the
[1:25:42] last second but I'll be there he says so
[1:25:46] you know when you're standing like
[1:25:48] that it's a totally different situation
[1:25:52] the circumstances all complete
[1:25:54] different you know what the word says
[1:25:57] about you amen the word of God now then
[1:26:01] there will not be one person who will
[1:26:04] sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:07] Christ unless he has been living that
[1:26:12] word can we go back two slides please
[1:26:15] because I just
[1:26:16] realized we didn't read verse
[1:26:20] 21 he
[1:26:22] said I'm standing at the door I will
[1:26:24] come into him and will Su with him and
[1:26:27] he with me to him that overcometh will I
[1:26:30] grant to sit with me in my Throne when
[1:26:34] is that going to happen that's going to
[1:26:36] happen in the Millennium and that's
[1:26:38] already happening to some of us even now
[1:26:42] we're seated with Christ in Heavenly
[1:26:46] places in Christ Jesus right now you're
[1:26:49] seated with him and you've been given
[1:26:52] the authority you've been given the
[1:26:54] power power to overcome this age amen
[1:26:59] praise God he that ha an ear so now
[1:27:01] let's go back to the
[1:27:03] quote I I realized that I had missed
[1:27:05] that because you know those that
[1:27:07] overcome in this age they go to the
[1:27:10] Millennium in the body change to rule
[1:27:14] and reign with Christ who's going to
[1:27:17] have the government upon his shoulders
[1:27:19] for 1,000 years of peace right here on
[1:27:23] this Earth
[1:27:24] so you can tell your friends it's not
[1:27:27] the end of the
[1:27:29] world okay it's the end
[1:27:32] times but those that are being prepared
[1:27:36] by the word that are being fortified by
[1:27:38] the word today and have accepted Christ
[1:27:41] and are overcoming this age by believing
[1:27:44] the word they're going to sit with him
[1:27:48] they're going to go in a Rapture they're
[1:27:50] going to bypass the Great Tribulation
[1:27:53] amen so here it is and so now he says
[1:27:56] sit with the Lord you will not unless
[1:27:59] you've been living that
[1:28:01] word so that word has got to be alive in
[1:28:05] you it's not only when you come to
[1:28:07] church on Sunday you put on that happy
[1:28:11] face you put on the dress and then
[1:28:12] Monday morning you got your tight skirt
[1:28:14] and jean back on that's not living
[1:28:18] Christ Living Christ is an everyday
[1:28:21] experience knowing that he is is in you
[1:28:25] he's with you he'll be with you right
[1:28:27] until the end of this age and the age is
[1:28:31] coming to an abrupt end very soon saints
[1:28:35] of God we're living in troubled times
[1:28:38] amen praise God and so your prayers your
[1:28:42] fastings your repentances no matter what
[1:28:45] you present to God none of that will
[1:28:48] gain you the privilege of sitting in
[1:28:51] that Throne it will be granted only to
[1:28:54] the word bride in other words the church
[1:28:59] that is living by the word of God in
[1:29:02] this day and in this
[1:29:04] hour and we're not like like menites
[1:29:08] people say oh you dress like menites you
[1:29:10] you live in a certain you know no we're
[1:29:12] Freer than anybody
[1:29:14] else we dress the way we dress because
[1:29:18] we love the Lord because we have a
[1:29:20] revelation that you know that a woman
[1:29:22] shouldn't be going down the street with
[1:29:24] a mini skirt on because she Jesus said
[1:29:26] whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[1:29:29] after her has already committed adultery
[1:29:32] with her so they're both going to be
[1:29:35] held accountable for committing adultery
[1:29:38] like spiritually speaking your thoughts
[1:29:41] are a lot louder in heaven than they are
[1:29:44] here on Earth I can tell you that amen
[1:29:47] God's going to flash everything before
[1:29:49] you so it's not a matter of you're
[1:29:51] living a certain way like you you you've
[1:29:54] got certain Rules by the way that you
[1:29:56] live no we live because we love the Lord
[1:30:00] and we have a revelation and a
[1:30:02] relationship with Christ that's why you
[1:30:04] don't hear me taking the name of the
[1:30:06] Lord in vain my friends every time you
[1:30:09] know they're around me stuff they you
[1:30:10] know they they'll they'll shoot the this
[1:30:12] word that word and they'll turn to me
[1:30:14] sorry Dan I said
[1:30:17] listen it's what comes out that defiles
[1:30:21] the individual okay I appreciate the
[1:30:24] fact that you know that that you're
[1:30:26] showing respect unto me because I I love
[1:30:30] the Lord and I don't use that kind of
[1:30:32] language I appreciate that and and so
[1:30:36] for whatever reason you're feeling that
[1:30:37] little conviction in your heart listen
[1:30:40] to it prise the Lord it'll make you a
[1:30:41] better person because it's not what goes
[1:30:44] in that defiles it's what comes out and
[1:30:48] I hear people swearing and taking the
[1:30:50] name of the Lord in vain and this and
[1:30:52] that they've got no
[1:30:55] relationship a man who sits and talks
[1:30:58] about his wife and you know says all
[1:31:01] kinds of things you know you hear it all
[1:31:03] the time you know oh man I a trador in
[1:31:06] you know and this and that you hear
[1:31:08] people talking like because you know you
[1:31:10] get you know people get older and and
[1:31:12] and they start you know it's just
[1:31:15] natural right it's just you know people
[1:31:17] just the way they are you know it's just
[1:31:21] you know people have certain
[1:31:22] relationships you know I overheard this
[1:31:24] guy was talking he was you know they
[1:31:26] they were in Jerusalem together with the
[1:31:28] family and they were all there and and
[1:31:30] he was there with his wife and his
[1:31:31] mother-in-law was there and the you know
[1:31:33] the the husband uh had already the
[1:31:35] father-in-law had already passed away
[1:31:37] but while they were there and they were
[1:31:38] there you know right at the site where
[1:31:40] they were you know where Jesus had died
[1:31:42] and Rose from you know at the cave and
[1:31:44] everything else and the the the
[1:31:46] Mother-in-law had a heart attack right
[1:31:47] there and then and died right there on
[1:31:49] the spot and they and then the people
[1:31:52] got together and they said listen you
[1:31:53] know what um we can take care of the
[1:31:55] funeral here uh you don't have to worry
[1:31:58] about shipping her back home it's going
[1:31:59] to cost thousands of dollars and

[1:32:05] father-in-law immediately said no no no
[1:32:07] no no no no no no we're shipping her
[1:32:08] home I don't know how I don't care how
[1:32:10] much it cost he says somebody died here
[1:32:12] and three days later they rose from the
[1:32:15] dead you see that's the kind of stuff
[1:32:19] that people you know they talk about
[1:32:21] those things yeah it's a little bit
[1:32:23] funny but this is going on all the
[1:32:26] time and and people they they have this
[1:32:30] concept of of relationships and
[1:32:33] everything else but we need to have the
[1:32:35] right concept of our relationship with
