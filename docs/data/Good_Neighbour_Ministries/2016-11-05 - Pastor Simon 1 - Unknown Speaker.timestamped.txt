[0:01] here it's not like you're going to lose
[0:03] your
[0:05] position you know it's not like the
[0:07] young Bulls are going to come charging
[0:10] down the p and and and in like in Spain
[0:13] and just uh bully and push out to uh the
[0:17] older lions or something like that but
[0:20] the fact is that's what's happening
[0:22] right
[0:23] now and whether we like it or not you
[0:26] can't turn back the time right can't
[0:30] turn time back we're all getting
[0:33] older and they um are young and
[0:37] strong and smart and everything else and
[0:42] we need to see how we can integrate them
[0:46] into what God is trying to do for their
[0:49] hour how they can find their
[0:52] places in the body of Christ and in the
[0:56] kingdom of God amen amen praise the Lord
[1:00] because then all it will be to them is
[1:02] just a sing
[1:04] song and this is not just a sing song
[1:07] Amen it's more than music and and and
[1:10] everything else like that it's more than
[1:12] that every True Believer whether there
[1:15] be a young person or an adult must catch
[1:19] a genuine revelation of God
[1:22] Amen I'm not talking about the knowledge
[1:24] of the message I know people been in the
[1:27] message for 30 40 years and they still
[1:29] have really called a
[1:32] revelation when you C called a
[1:34] revelation then nobody has to actually
[1:38] be your um give you an Impulse you
[1:43] actually have it within you and and you
[1:45] want to do it you want to do something
[1:47] for God because you got something not me
[1:50] telling you not the pastor telling you
[1:52] but you got something because you C the
[1:56] Revelation then that Revelation RS you
[1:58] up and you equi by the Holy Spirit to do
[2:02] things for the glory of God Amen I
[2:05] didn't plan to talk like that it just
[2:07] happened to say that in passing but I
[2:09] hope it applies to you and touches your
[2:13] heart happy to see every one of you here
[2:16] praise the Lord good to see you sister
[2:18] glad that you're here in the house of
[2:19] the Lord glad to see every one of you
[2:22] God richly bless you here
[2:26] today um we're going to also have the
[2:30] Lord's supper or brothers prepared for
[2:33] that right right after the service uh
[2:36] we're going to have the Lord's
[2:39] Supper um and the washing of the Saints
[2:43] feet which means that the the the
[2:46] sisters will go
[2:48] downstairs and that's where they will do
[2:50] that and brothers will uh stay up here
[2:54] just like lighting this before I go to
[2:57] the uh teaching for today and you I've
[3:00] made allowance for the fact that we have
[3:02] to do all these things so it's not like
[3:05] I'm going to preach a 4-Hour sermon
[3:07] right or anything like that I factored
[3:10] it in because I I realized many years
[3:14] ago as I was the very first in Toronto
[3:18] um to change from the two services that
[3:21] we used to have um and that's way back
[3:24] in
[3:25] 19 uh 74 somewhere in there and
[3:30] 74 uh and
[3:34] um
[3:38] amen
[3:40] wow amazing wow anyway just to let you
[3:45] know that
[3:48] um there in Toronto of course there was
[3:52] only
[3:53] um there wasn't even a church there was
[3:56] no church there brother Bob ivany that
[3:59] was in in Miss Saga which was just a lot
[4:01] of farms and Bush and trees and stuff
[4:05] like that and that church has marked and
[4:08] changed they went to Streetsville and
[4:10] they went to Milton and uh and that
[4:12] church of course stands today as a
[4:15] testimony testimony to that um old
[4:19] brother's um
[4:22] work and victory I was talking this with
[4:26] uh brother Sak who was one of the early
[4:28] ones that was done basement just a few
[4:31] of them in basement and now there's a
[4:33] wonderful Church in Milton um where
[4:35] they're giving God glory and praise amen
[4:38] then because they were out in missa and
[4:41] of course the Subway Lines only ran as
[4:44] far as
[4:46] isling you didn't go any further um
[4:49] there's no way to get into Miss unless
[4:51] you got a taxi or a bus being a new
[4:54] immigrant at the time uh coming in
[4:57] 1972 um is hard to find a bus and a taxi
[5:02] plus it will take you so long that uh it
[5:05] was a waste of time so I went a couple
[5:07] of times and stop and then later on as
[5:10] you know witnessing to people that my
[5:12] house got filled and and then the church
[5:14] next door we started in the church next
[5:16] door brother Nelson at that time came
[5:19] his wife my wife we started just
[5:23] fellowshipping and then the church grew
[5:25] by the grace of God um and uh from that
[5:29] um from that uh later on as the Lord uh
[5:33] should gave me uh the vision of my car
[5:36] coming in this direction and going into
[5:38] the micro area and uh the tire blowing
[5:43] up and Sur enough when I obeyed that and
[5:47] we were on our way moving my furniture
[5:50] and coming down the tire went um on the
[5:54] car by the grace of God and so from that
[6:00] this church started in St
[6:03] Catherine uh by the grace of God started
[6:06] there and the church in Toronto that was
[6:09] there went into two parts brother Luke
[6:13] and brother uh Nelson uh there but we
[6:17] know that they both still exist um
[6:20] they're still there by the grace of God
[6:22] later on brother John T joined me when I
[6:26] was in um moved from St Catherine the
[6:29] church had grow and I was in uh Stony
[6:33] Creek wion Winona and the white church
[6:36] there and um was the worship leader now
[6:40] when I'm saying these things the devil
[6:42] is so cunning sometimes it makes it
[6:44] sounds like you're trying to put down
[6:46] the preacher but it's not that's not
[6:48] what I'm trying to do here I'm just
[6:50] trying to give you a background of the
[6:52] history of what went on um actually in
[6:56] this onario if you want to put it back
[6:58] way and so um as you know later on
[7:02] brother John felt the calling of God and
[7:04] he started the work up there and this
[7:07] church supported that by the grace of
[7:10] God did you know that yeah uh how many
[7:15] how many 100 chairs we literally gave
[7:19] 150 chairs and stuff like that you know
[7:22] we we gave for the for that church to
[7:25] really start to find its foing and to
[7:27] grow by the grace of God
[7:29] as to the petrolea church that's myself
[7:32] and brother uh Humes brother Brandon's
[7:36] old friend brother Tim Humes as father
[7:39] um that went in of course the olon
[7:43] brothers were in there first but what
[7:46] happened is that Jerry also left and
[7:48] went away and left about five people or
[7:52] so in there and so they they called for
[7:55] us and brother hes and myself went in
[7:58] there and preaching an old United Church
[8:01] Revival broke out we baptized sister
[8:04] Annie and her husband and several others
[8:08] and the Genesis of the church started to
[8:10] grow now that church still stands there
[8:13] today what I'm saying is you don't look
[8:17] at this church look at just the people
[8:19] in it the size of it or anything like
[8:22] that to know the real power of a church
[8:26] right that's not the power of a church
[8:30] look at all the churches that came out
[8:31] from this
[8:33] church and we don't hold any control or
[8:36] anything like that we just released it I
[8:38] mean if you start to talk about Grado if
[8:40] you talk about Africa if you talk about
[8:43] here and there it's there praise the
[8:44] Lord so just so that you know that that
[8:48] that's what the Lord has been doing um
[8:51] in this area but I'm sure to get more of
[8:53] I drift away from what
[8:55] really intended to tell you what uh let
[8:59] me get get to my subject here today
[9:01] we're going to be chatting all
[9:03] [Music]

[10:45] and amen praise the Lord read out of
[10:48] Romans now I beseech you therefore
[10:54] Brethren by the mercies of God let you
[10:59] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[11:03] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[11:07] reasonable service let me completed with
[11:10] the second verse and be not confirmed to
[11:14] this world but be ye transformed by the
[11:18] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[11:21] what is the good and acceptable and
[11:25] perfect will of God may the Lord bless
[11:29] our words please be
[11:33] seated of course we want to talk about
[11:37] sacrifice and mainly about a Living
[11:42] Sacrifice and Lord placed that uh so
[11:46] much on my thoughts so I just thought
[11:47] I'd talk about it for a while first of
[11:50] all the meaning of the word sacrifice
[11:53] out of
[11:54] dictionary.com no more finding a big
[11:56] dictionary and twisting the pages but
[12:00] digital they said here um it says here
[12:04] to make a sacrifice or offering to
[12:09] surrender or give up
[12:12] something or permit injury or
[12:16] disadvantage to forsake or forsake
[12:20] something for something else to
[12:23] dispose of your goods property Etc
[12:29] regardless of
[12:31] profit right uh as such
[12:37] now the sacrifice itself may be a animal
[12:41] a plant or human life or some material
[12:45] possession to a deity as in
[12:49] propitiation or in worship or
[12:53] homage the person or animal or the thing
[12:56] being offered is called that
[13:00] sacrifice the thing surrendered or
[13:04] devoted to the deity is called a
[13:09] sacrifice a loss incurred in selling
[13:12] something below its value is called a
[13:17] sacrifice also called
[13:21] sacrifice burn
[13:24] sacrifice amen just a few things I
[13:27] wanted you to have that
[13:29] now of course that's the natural meaning
[13:33] of that word um
[13:36] sacrifice a sacrifice is actually an
[13:39] outward expression of man's Duty uh
[13:42] towards God uh and this uh man's uh
[13:47] sacrifice is a symbol of his communion
[13:50] with God and it's a very important
[13:54] ingredient in our relationship with God
[13:57] let's talk a little bit about history as
[13:59] I lay in just a bit of a background here
[14:02] of course uh sacrifice uh started in the
[14:06] beginning the first evidence of it is in
[14:08] the Book of Genesis with uh Abel the
[14:12] Bible tells us Abel offered a better
[14:15] sacrifice in actual fact it seems like
[14:19] God instituted sacrifice because it
[14:23] wasn't
[14:24] strange um for Cain or Abel to bring a a
[14:30] sacrifice they knew they had to do some
[14:33] kind of a sacrifice to God but one had a
[14:37] revelation of what the sacrifice was to
[14:40] be and the other one had no
[14:43] understanding whatsoever but it started
[14:46] with uh Abel then later on we know that
[14:52] uh the heathens had their own way of
[14:55] sacrifice they sacrificed animals
[14:59] they sacrifice even humans we know
[15:02] parents will take their God and their
[15:05] child and throw it to the crocodiles in
[15:07] the Nile uh because they believe that
[15:10] was of God then we know that the um
[15:15] Philistines the amalekites the
[15:18] midianites they took their child and
[15:20] give it to the god shos which is a great
[15:24] big Stone god with a with fire in his
[15:27] belly and they would go and throw uh
[15:31] their child into the belly of that God
[15:34] thinking that that will create blessing
[15:36] for them and then later on you know
[15:39] other cultures other societies it was
[15:41] adults it was maidens that were taken
[15:45] and and offered to these Gods all uh all
[15:49] trying to uh of course appease that God
[15:53] of course as Believers now we know that
[15:56] they were just under the Same Spirit of
[15:58] King they they had no revelation of what
[16:00] kind of sacrifice they ought to offer
[16:03] righten and therefore they offered what
[16:06] they believe was the best thing they had
[16:09] right they choose the choices of their
[16:11] flock their best looking daughter the
[16:14] their most perfect looking and that's
[16:16] the one that they'll take and offer to
[16:18] these gods and of course that was wrong
[16:22] it was against the word of God Amen and
[16:26] now uh of course you know God himself
[16:29] said you know uh the Lord needed nothing
[16:34] the Lord has need of nothing other words
[16:37] that he doesn't really need anything
[16:40] praise the Lord the C on Thousand Hills
[16:42] belong on him what can you offer me that
[16:47] I don't already have you see so really
[16:51] the offerings that we make and the
[16:53] sacrifices we make it's not for our for
[16:57] for God
[16:59] really it's not for God it's for
[17:02] ourselves Because by the offering you
[17:04] make God knows what's in your heart and
[17:07] God knows your loyalty to him and your
[17:09] surrender to him okay so now so before
[17:14] the law that's the way it was then we
[17:17] understand later on how Abraham came
[17:20] along and Abraham offered up Isaac uh up
[17:26] on and Isaac went and he obediently
[17:30] obeyed his father and laid
[17:33] himself on that uh fire ready to be
[17:38] offered up and you know the story God
[17:40] stopped Abraham when he was about to uh
[17:44] stabed Isaac and uh told him no there's
[17:48] a ram over there he turned and there was
[17:50] a ram in the thicket and later on he
[17:53] went got the ram out and offered that uh
[17:56] to God um so so we see there clearly of
[18:01] course that God later on uh during the
[18:04] law instituted animal sacrifices animal
[18:09] sacrifices and of course that was only
[18:12] temporary because it was a tipe for the
[18:15] reality that was yet to come so now what
[18:19] happened is that they started to abuse
[18:21] even the sacrifices they started buying
[18:23] and selling of cows and sheep and you
[18:26] know and selling doves and and gradia it
[18:29] putting it in grades that if you're rich
[18:31] you can offer a cow if you're a little
[18:34] less Rich then you can come with a sheep
[18:36] uh if you don't have money for sheep
[18:38] then you can offer a pigeon right and
[18:41] then if you got no money even for that
[18:43] then you can offer a little Dove right
[18:46] you come with a little money and you at
[18:47] least you can get two dos and sell so
[18:50] they had a bre they ended up having a
[18:52] commercial uh situation going on in the
[18:56] temple courts right where they were
[18:58] gathering there and selling cattle and
[19:01] everything else like that so that's what
[19:05] the background of sacrifice is but of
[19:08] course sacrifice also has its
[19:11] significance which is it was
[19:14] anticipatory or a type of the Lord Jesus
[19:18] Christ who was to come that would be the
[19:20] ultimate
[19:22] sacrifice okay now in
[19:25] Switzerland there came uh this uh young
[19:29] man by the name of Abraham
[19:32] bener himself and his family left uh
[19:36] that Nation to come to the United States
[19:38] of America but while they were on the
[19:41] Atlantic Crossing it's not like today
[19:43] you getting a plane and Zoo you know
[19:45] you're there within hours or you get on
[19:48] a ship and the ship is going to take uh
[19:51] you know a couple of days or so to cross
[19:54] the ocean um my goodness it it took
[19:58] months right so during that Journey his
[20:01] parents died he was just a young boy I
[20:05] think he was about 10 years old and what
[20:08] happened that Dy he made the crossing
[20:10] landed in the United States of America
[20:13] here he was in a strange country a
[20:16] Strange Land but he did not give up amen
[20:19] he did not cry and
[20:21] complain somehow he managed and began to
[20:25] work brothers and sisters let me tell
[20:27] you uh by the way his parents were were
[20:30] were Believers but he wasn't converted
[20:33] but anyway the fact is that he was able
[20:35] to hold on amen amen and I want to
[20:38] encourage you whatever you may be going
[20:40] through right now hanging there amen
[20:43] hold on and allow God to have his way in
[20:46] your life amen anyway as he grew older
[20:50] teenag or so uh he happened to come in
[20:54] contact with a church and the preacher
[20:56] preaching the word he got converted he
[20:59] repented of his
[21:01] sins and became a Believer but that set
[21:04] his soul on
[21:06] fire that's the kind of young people I
[21:09] would like to see
[21:10] today uh who when they receive the word
[21:13] of God and their candle got lit
[21:15] according to the prophet he said then
[21:18] they need to go out with that Lit candle
[21:21] and spread the word amen instead what we
[21:25] find today we are encouraged to sit
[21:28] and serve right but God didn't call us
[21:32] to sit down God didn't call us to
[21:36] spectate he call us to participate amen
[21:39] he called us to be a part of his work of
[21:41] what he's trying to do and what he's
[21:43] trying to accomplish that's what God is
[21:46] doing in this hour in this season and
[21:48] time so this young man was on fire from
[21:52] God and uh he had heard about the
[21:55] suffering of the slaves in uh St Thomas
[22:00] the Virgin Islands under the US uh
[22:04] control uh and so back then there were
[22:08] uh s the slaves there some were s there
[22:10] some were in the South picking cotton
[22:12] other ones were uh doing the sugar and
[22:14] the rum and stuff like that on uh in St
[22:18] Thomas so he heard about their suffering
[22:21] and he decided he was going to go there
[22:24] and see how he could help them to his
[22:26] surprise when he tried to get there he
[22:30] was told nobody is allowed to go and
[22:34] preach to the
[22:35] slaves so he was shocked he was amazed
[22:38] nobody allowed to preach to those slaves
[22:42] except for slaves themselves a slave
[22:46] that's already a slave he can preach for
[22:48] a slave
[22:50] so he sat down he prayed to God but he
[22:54] was so on fire and he wrote a letter to
[22:57] the governor and the letter to the
[22:59] governor was to ask the
[23:01] governor to make him into a slave
[23:05] because he willingly now give up his
[23:08] entire rights to his freedom and
[23:12] everything else I'm talking about a
[23:15] young man just teenage give up all his
[23:17] rights because he wants to be a slave so
[23:21] he can go preach to the slave it so
[23:24] touched the governor that an knowing to
[23:27] him the Governor transferred the letter
[23:29] to the
[23:31] king and uh there the king sent back an
[23:36] authorization which was never given to
[23:38] anybody else to give him complete
[23:41] freedom of all the territories there so
[23:46] that he could go wherever he wished to
[23:49] go and preach to whoever he wished to
[23:52] preach to amen praise the Lord what I'm
[23:55] trying to show you is this man was
[23:57] willing to sacrifice himself and his
[24:01] freedom for the sake of the Lord Jesus
[24:04] Christ The Gospel of our Lord Jesus
[24:07] Christ amen yes sir but here we are
[24:11] today we got all the freedom in the
[24:14] world that we can speak to any and
[24:18] everybody and now we don't use that
[24:20] freedom for God's
[24:22] glory uh we actually hold on and don't
[24:25] use it because of chist
[24:30] shamefacedness you know
[24:32] selfishness
[24:33] carnality oh you know somebody's going
[24:36] to insult me well they whipped him to
[24:39] death I mean he led himself to death um
[24:44] spit upon and everything else he said if
[24:46] I suffer I'm your Lord and Master and I
[24:49] suffer he said aren't you going to
[24:50] suffer too are you gr than your lord you
[24:53] going to have to have some of those
[24:54] things happen too if you're going to win
[24:56] people to Christ amen uh you uh uh he
[24:59] came to us when we were
[25:01] unlovely and when we were
[25:04] unloved is that right then he reached
[25:07] down his hand for us and we have got to
[25:09] learn to go beyond our comfort zone amen
[25:13] amen go beyond your comfort zone to
[25:16] reach out to people whom you may not
[25:18] personally
[25:20] like is that right people you may not
[25:24] personally like or love but you got to
[25:27] reach out
[25:29] that is Our obligation as Believers to
[25:32] make a sacrificial gift to the glory of
[25:38] God now I beee you therefore
[25:41] Brethren
[25:44] amen by the mercies of God that you
[25:47] present your
[25:49] bodies as a Living
[25:53] Sacrifice holy acceptable un to God
[25:56] which is your reason
[25:58] service now you know all
[26:03] sacrifices if they're going to be
[26:05] offered they first had to be
[26:07] killed you kill the Sacrifice from
[26:09] Elijah to Elisha to everyone and they
[26:12] kill the sacrifice the only sacrifices
[26:16] that we see in the Bible where the
[26:20] sacrifice willingly went and lay itself
[26:23] on the altar is Isaac who was a type of
[26:26] Christ
[26:28] who like a lamb allowed himself to be
[26:30] led to the slaughter and before his
[26:33] sharers he stood dumb right what was he
[26:37] doing he was showing us an example that
[26:40] we had to be living sacrifices for his
[26:43] glory amen all the sacrifices of the
[26:45] heathens had to die and when they were
[26:49] dead then they were offered but we are
[26:51] allowed the opportunity to consciously
[26:55] be aware of what they're doing and yes
[26:58] Lord surrender ourselves to him and give
[27:02] him our service not because somebody
[27:05] beat us there or or or we we have to be
[27:08] killed in that fashion but we willingly
[27:11] give him our service and everything we
[27:14] do for him we are ready and willing to
[27:18] sacrifice for the glory of God Amen now
[27:22] we thank God of course that uh for that
[27:25] he set us apart from all creation
[27:28] amen you are set apart from the whole
[27:30] creation as Servants of the Living God
[27:33] and called out for his glory that you
[27:36] might do what that you might offer him
[27:39] the sacrifice of your life of your
[27:42] service and David said I want to offer
[27:45] him the sacrifice of
[27:47] praise I want to give God the sacrifice
[27:51] of praise that is so important now
[27:55] friends when you offer that sacrifice of
[27:59] praise it's not always easy to praise
[28:02] God is that right yes sometimes you got
[28:05] to wake up yourself to praise God
[28:09] Hallelujah the sacrifice of prayer you
[28:12] got to offer to God sometimes you got to
[28:14] shake yourself to pray amen especially
[28:17] in this age that we're living in where
[28:20] Darkness seems to come right down and
[28:22] press on
[28:23] you heaviness comes and press on you
[28:26] sleep and press on you is that right oh
[28:32] yeah of course the devil don't want you
[28:34] to just pray to God or C down the holy
[28:38] ghost or like that so um he'll you know
[28:42] just make you fall asleep come
[28:45] absolutely I've literally been in a
[28:48] prayer meeting where there's an elder of
[28:50] the church and prayers going on and
[28:52] everybody glory to God hallelujah and
[28:55] everything else going and he falls
[28:56] asleep in in the middle of all that
[28:59] R and so around that time you know we
[29:04] had a visiting uh speaker from the
[29:06] United States and so the minister one of
[29:10] the ministers turned and said and now we
[29:13] ask our precious brother mallister to
[29:16] take our brother that's visiting before
[29:19] the Lord in prayer that God will have a
[29:21] breakout in signs and wonders and
[29:24] miracles Among Us the word to be
[29:26] fulfilled in everything
[29:27] like that and and then uh as in a SP
[29:31] second we realized that he's sleeping so
[29:34] one of us that was near him give him a
[29:37] little what like that but he's an old
[29:40] veteran you know so he starts out
[29:43] praying but he doesn't start out like
[29:45] you would have started out father
[29:48] tonight know he starts out at a high
[29:50] pitch as if he was in everything else oh
[29:53] God I come in the name of Jesus to pray
[29:58] for our
[29:59] brother our
[30:01] brother what's the brother's
[30:10] name Lord help us you know and there he
[30:14] was caught you don't want to be caught
[30:17] like that do you I said you don't want
[30:19] to be caught like that
[30:22] you it sounds like
[30:24] you well I hope you're not C like that
[30:27] to
[30:30] amen praise the Lord I hope everybody's
[30:32] a bit
[30:34] now everybody away now come on show
[30:43] that you know preaching is Warfare the
[30:46] devil is going to do his part and the
[30:47] preacher has to do his part to R back
[30:49] the
[30:50] territory so that's all I'm trying to do
[30:53] here for the glory of God glory to God
[30:56] so friends we are not here to offer dead
[30:59] meaningless
[31:01] sacrifices praise the Lord or worthless
[31:05] sacrifices amen and I'm not talking
[31:08] about when it comes down time for Lent
[31:10] you say brother I'm going to sacrifice
[31:13] fish
[31:15] today but it's only one day and tomorrow
[31:19] you can make up for the fish that you
[31:20] lost for the for the one day so that's
[31:23] no sacrifice whatsoever you need a real
[31:26] sacrifice f is that right and so you
[31:29] know you got to be able to really give
[31:31] up something you really got to let go of
[31:34] something completely with whatever that
[31:38] is you got to cease doing something that
[31:41] you used to do and say I won't do it
[31:43] anymore then you're talking about a real
[31:46] sacrifice other than that it's not a
[31:48] very real sacrifice so friends we don't
[31:52] want to offer dead sacrifices but living
[31:54] sacrifices to the glory of God so we
[31:58] know that the Lord himself is the
[32:00] ultimate sacrifice and he offered
[32:03] himself up for us amen praise the Lord
[32:07] now what can we do what can we sacrifice
[32:09] for him and for his
[32:12] glory if I want to turn let me turn this
[32:15] conversation have you ever stop and
[32:17] think about all the Young
[32:21] Veterans that died in the last Wars for
[32:24] us to be able to get our freedom
[32:28] you know most of them were just like 18
[32:31] between 18 and 20 something years old
[32:35] they were just
[32:36] boys and they went to bathroom to be
[32:39] able to allow us to keep our freedom an
[32:43] old German submarine was found as far in
[32:46] the St Lawrence
[32:47] River so if they had a little bit more
[32:51] time they would have been trying to take
[32:53] North America to so don't think because
[32:57] Europe is far away we are over here that
[32:59] we were actually safe no they had
[33:01] already gone into Africa gone to South
[33:04] South America and they were penetrating
[33:06] North America too if that war wasn't
[33:09] stopped so you've got to understand here
[33:12] that we have got veterans that fought
[33:14] for our freedom and sacrifice what the
[33:17] ultimate sacrifice of their lives am
[33:21] praise the Lord their lives is the
[33:24] sacrifice that they make I want stop and
[33:27] talk also mention here and I'm just
[33:30] being brief with this subject here today
[33:32] I want to mention uh many of you can
[33:35] think about your own parents amen I
[33:38] don't think I have much to explain there
[33:41] but I know the sacrifices my parents
[33:45] made what about your parents they make
[33:48] any sacrifices
[33:50] amen and when it comes to parents uh
[33:55] it's equal because sometimes times I've
[33:58] seen some fathers that made some
[34:01] sacrifices that was so unbelievable they
[34:04] work themselves to the Bone to make sure
[34:08] that their families are taken care of is
[34:10] that right and any any real genuine man
[34:16] uh would want to be that way is that
[34:19] right a real a real man that's the way
[34:21] he wants to be want to provide he wants
[34:23] to protect um you know and he wants to
[34:26] uh preserve whatever is his uh by the
[34:29] grace of God so when I think about the
[34:32] sacrifices of my parents of the
[34:35] appearance of many other people that I
[34:37] know uh and mothers that I know would
[34:40] rather to go without eating a meal so
[34:45] that their children could have a
[34:47] meal amen I seen fathers that go without
[34:52] meals for days so that their family
[34:56] could have meal
[34:57] and that they could be taken care of by
[35:00] the grace of God you're talking about
[35:02] people that give that really offered up
[35:06] a real sacrifice it's in that light I'm
[35:09] asking you how far are we willing to go
[35:12] to serve God this is something that we
[35:14] just want to talk about you know we
[35:17] ought to be able to offer up the
[35:19] sacrifice of
[35:21] praise there's a scripture I'm looking
[35:24] at it 2 Samuel uh 2 4 around verse uh 24
[35:30] also when David actually went to buy a
[35:32] piece of ground
[35:34] ground and uh uh and then this gentleman
[35:38] Aruna said to him you no you're the king
[35:42] you can have it I I'll give this uh land
[35:44] and property to you for free and David
[35:47] said no I will surely buy it from you
[35:51] for a price nor will I offer any burnt
[35:55] offerings to the Lord Lord my God which
[35:58] cost me
[36:00] nothing he will not offer any the god
[36:04] that cost him nothing and that he did
[36:07] not feel some sense of sacrifice amen
[36:12] many times we want to make sacrifices
[36:14] that cost us nothing amen well I guess
[36:19] I'll give a little extra in the offering
[36:22] this week because I have so much money
[36:24] left over and I used the word leftover
[36:28] advisably but um I'll just give the Lord
[36:30] a little extra because I have some
[36:32] leftovers and and you're not giving out
[36:35] of your need you're not giving it out
[36:39] like the Widow who actually needed that
[36:42] and yet by a revelation gave it for the
[36:44] glory of God so that's when you're
[36:46] talking about a real sacrifice right or
[36:50] else you you say you know brother Simon
[36:54] I don't have nothing to do today maybe
[36:57] this is the day to do something for the
[36:59] lord well that's good but uh that's not
[37:02] a real sacrifice because in the first
[37:05] place you have nothing to do you have
[37:07] all the time in the world and that's
[37:09] when you offer yourself to do something
[37:12] for the Lord we still welcome that but
[37:14] that's not a real Living Sacrifice
[37:18] praise the Lord but when uh you know I
[37:22] couldn't I don't know about brother
[37:23] Chris or brother this or brother that
[37:25] but uh somebody that's working for a few
[37:28] thousands of dollars a day and decide to
[37:31] say well brother you know I feel L the
[37:34] Lord that I should be in the church and
[37:36] I should do this and I should do that
[37:38] and I should do that so that's what the
[37:41] sacrifices they're losing something on
[37:44] one hand to be able to serve God on the
[37:48] other hand amen and so when we begin to
[37:51] die out to ourselves we begin to be
[37:54] ready and prepared to lose certain
[37:56] things that we can gain the grace of God
[38:00] and the love of God hallelujah
[38:05] amen Living Sacrifice I'm winding this
[38:08] down already because we have the Lord's
[38:10] Supper we have the baptism I'm not going
[38:12] to be but the fact is is that church
[38:19] attendants while you're alive and you're
[38:23] living you got to make the choice
[38:24] whether you be a church or not be a
[38:26] church
[38:27] right oh well I'll be in church on
[38:30] Sunday when everybody's there you know
[38:33] it's a good time for them everybody at
[38:35] least will know I'm in church but uh
[38:38] wednsday night there not you know not
[38:40] that many of them there so nobody will
[38:42] know that I'm there I'm not there so
[38:45] that's not important but you forgot the
[38:47] overall scripture for sake not the
[38:49] assembling of yourselves together at the
[38:52] manner of some
[38:53] else we don't want to get into all the
[38:56] little little um parts of it where okay
[38:59] I'm working on the ship that's why I
[39:00] couldn't be there or this or that as
[39:03] long as that's not the case we need to
[39:04] be in the house of the
[39:07] Lord amen praise the Lord okay we need
[39:10] to be in the house of the Lord and you
[39:12] say oh I went to work and I was tired
[39:15] well everybody and a worker was tired
[39:18] praise the Lord glory to God even the
[39:21] housewife at home that not a full day is
[39:25] time praise the Lord and of course if
[39:29] you have got work plus you got your
[39:31] regular work outside that you have to do
[39:34] then I know you're dou tired but then
[39:37] God didn't put in there um and if you're
[39:40] not tired forsake
[39:44] not is that how read
[39:50] it no he he didn't put anything on his
[39:54] said for sake not theing of yourself
[39:57] together as a manner of some else praise
[40:00] the Lord so we have to be in the house
[40:02] of God praise the Lord Brother himself
[40:06] talked about how many times he he had to
[40:08] get the church you know and and and he
[40:11] just hustling to get there because he
[40:13] was working on the lines and he had to
[40:15] run down because you know he used to the
[40:17] part lines run down get down get them
[40:20] from off of there quick and run and get
[40:22] this old beat up truck and scoop down
[40:24] the road he said and sometimes I only
[40:26] had enough time to uh pump some water in
[40:29] those old pumps they had there so he can
[40:31] wash his hands um like that and uh with
[40:34] all that sweaty clothes and everything
[40:36] else but he made sure he ran in the
[40:38] house of the Lord is that right brother
[40:42] Simon I can't come like
[40:44] that no you got to have a feather in
[40:46] your C right but God invites us to come
[40:50] into his house it's the act of obedience
[40:54] that's more important to God amen that
[40:57] you are in the house of the Lord because
[41:00] God has something for you to hear amen
[41:04] every Christian ought to read their
[41:05] Bible and pray amen of course if you
[41:09] want to make that that's a sacrifice
[41:11] that you have to make to read your Bible
[41:13] and pray every day praise God so you
[41:17] have to make that sacrifice that people
[41:20] will uh will see from the fruit of your
[41:22] life that you are a real genuine
[41:25] believer
[41:26] as you read your Bible and pray every
[41:28] day also it's a sacrifice to pay the
[41:31] tithes of your
[41:32] offering I was listening to hear I'm get
[41:35] a loud amen I want to pay my ti to my
[41:39] offerings praise the Lord yes sir uh
[41:43] it's something that we need to do for
[41:45] God's glory and uh sometimes it's a
[41:49] sacrifice at other times it's very easy
[41:51] for you to do but uh in all seasons and
[41:55] in all times
[41:56] we ought to obey the word of God and do
[42:00] what God says according to his word
[42:04] praise the Lord um and most of all when
[42:09] we come in the house of the Lord maybe
[42:11] you're down maybe you're feeling
[42:13] discouraged but let's offer him the
[42:15] sacrifice of praise amen and worship is
[42:19] that right God didn't call you as a
[42:22] Christian to be a
[42:24] firefighter when the fire God starts
[42:27] moving in the church God doesn't want
[42:29] you to put it out with your attitude and
[42:32] with your you know uh just a
[42:35] lowkey uh spirit and D everything no God
[42:40] wants us to add our lip of fire together
[42:43] with one another so that the place could
[42:45] be a blaze for the glory of God and
[42:48] praising God is a sacrifice but
[42:52] sometimes you got to sacrifice your PR
[42:54] your pride is that right because oh
[42:57] sister is not very expressive because
[43:00] she doesn't raise up her hand like that
[43:02] you know don't scream this way or
[43:05] whatever I'm not encourag you to be a
[43:08] vard you know uh that's not what I'm
[43:11] encouraging you to be but I'm telling
[43:13] you the same holy spirit that hit Miriam
[43:15] the same holy spirit that hit Mary the
[43:18] same holy spirit that hit them on the
[43:20] that Pentecost if it genuine she's going
[43:22] to make you act the same way or El out
[43:26] the spirit praise the Lord it'll make
[43:28] you be different you can't help it but
[43:31] that's the problem some people are
[43:32] afraid of how they might act if they let
[43:34] go and let the Holy Ghost have his way
[43:37] they're going to act different from
[43:38] themselves you're supposed to act
[43:40] different from yourself because it's not
[43:42] you as him and it's not yourself but the
[43:45] god of Heaven working and moving through
[43:47] your life praise the Lord so Brothers
[43:50] let me say this if you are going to
[43:54] finally uh off yourself to to be a
[43:56] Living Sacrifice you must repent of all
[43:59] your sins amen all your mistakes give
[44:03] them up and let go and let the Lord take
[44:06] charge of your life the greatest
[44:09] sacrifice you can make is to make your
[44:12] life an offering unto him amen Paul said
[44:17] that he has given his life to the Lord
[44:20] until he has offered it and now it has
[44:22] become a sweet smelling Savor or
[44:26] sacrifice unto the Lord his life his
[44:28] entire life become a sacrifice unto the
[44:32] Lord may the Lord bless you with this
[44:35] this meditation here today not really a
[44:38] message or a sermon but just a short
[44:40] meditation for you to think on this and
[44:43] see what it is that you will sacrifice
[44:47] for the Lord don't tell me
[44:49] pork don't tell me fish don't tell me
[44:53] any of those things I explain that to
[44:55] you because that's just natural I'm
[44:58] talking about spiritual things in your
[45:00] own life your own walk that you know
[45:04] within yourself that you would like to
[45:07] have transformed and changed uh by the
[45:12] spirit of almighty God praise the Lord
[45:15] we're going to change the order the
[45:17] service I'm going to ask for the might
[45:20] to come back up here uh maybe lead a few
[45:24] uh songs
[45:34] I'm going to let them
[45:41] um you leave a few songs
[45:44] brother
[45:46] uh Danielle uh you can get
[45:50] prepared now I'm going to look at myself
[45:53] from here while brother in this part of
[45:56] the service and as soon as he has been
[46:02] baptized we're going to do the Lord's um
[46:06] supper here Michael will take it U Back
[46:09] from me at that
[46:11] point give me a chance to do a quick
[46:16] change and be right back up
[46:21] okay bless you
[46:24] brother
[46:30] maybe we can stand at this
[46:32] time
[46:35] lord offer my life simple uh words but
[46:40] uh
[46:42] genuinely the truth I like what he said
[46:44] at the end there especially but Paul
[46:46] came to that place where his whole life
[46:47] became just a
[46:50] a perfume unto the Lord a sacrifice unto
[46:53] the Lord you know that happens today you
[46:55] know
[46:57] you just keep on surrendering keep on
[47:00] battling keep on pressing then one day
[47:01] you you find
[47:04] that it's like it just starts to become
[47:07] a perfume man automatically so uh praise
[47:12] God all that I
[47:15] am and all that I
[47:18] have I lay them down before
[47:24] you all
[47:27] my and all
[47:30] my
