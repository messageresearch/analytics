[24:59] and I got um Hebrews
[25:09] 6:18 okay you got
[25:12] it there shall
[25:14] not okay verse three say every place
[25:18] that the soul of your foot shall Trad
[25:23] upon that I that have I given unto you I
[25:28] as I said unto
[25:31] Moses from the Wilderness and this
[25:35] Lebanon even into the Great River the
[25:38] river ephra all the land of the Hees and
[25:41] onto the great sea toward the going down
[25:45] of the sun shall be your
[25:50] Coast there shall not any man be able to
[25:53] stand before thee all the days of th
[25:56] life
[25:59] as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee
[26:03] I'll not fail thee nor forsake thee
[26:07] God's giv us that promise he will never
[26:09] leave us nor forsake us and Hebrews
[26:15] 6
[26:20] 18 that by two imitable things in
[26:25] which it was impossible
[26:29] for God to
[26:31] lie we might have a strong
[26:35] consolation
[26:37] who have fled for The Refuge to lay hold
[26:42] upon the Hope set before us which hope
[26:46] we have as an anchor of the Soul both
[26:49] sure and steadfast and which entered
[26:51] into the that within the veil whether
[26:54] the Forerunner is for entered even J say
[26:58] made and high priest Forever After the
[27:00] order of MEC the m is the two imitable
[27:04] things in which it was impossible for
[27:07] God to lie you might have a strong
[27:10] consolation who have fled for The Refuge
[27:13] to lay hold upon the Hope set before us
[27:17] Heavenly Father please bless the reading
[27:20] of the word in Jesus name amen please be
[27:25] seated yeah so as we just read from the
[27:29] scripture
[27:30] that the Bible said that every place
[27:35] that your footstep God says that given
[27:38] to them you
[27:41] know we spoke of this on Friday prayer
[27:44] meeting and I just feel led to just
[27:46] continue with
[27:49] it
[27:51] God could have wiped out all the heti
[27:55] ties all the jebusites all the
[27:57] Canaanites
[27:59] all those
[28:00] inhabitants and gave the city to
[28:03] them but remember in
[28:07] numbers there were 12 Elders from each
[28:11] of the
[28:12] tribes and God chose them to go and spy
[28:16] the land and as I was reading what
[28:19] really strike me was that when God told
[28:23] them to go and spy the land Moses told
[28:26] them to be courageous
[28:28] and bring fruit of the
[28:31] land and it strick me so much that these
[28:36] people were very courageous and truly
[28:39] they were able to bring the fruit of the
[28:42] land and say yes this place is what full
[28:48] of milk and honey it's a wonderful place
[28:53] the fruit the food is
[28:55] good and God has given them that
[28:59] courage yet when they came back they
[29:03] came back with evil
[29:06] report
[29:08] why will you have the courage to do
[29:11] something and then you still coming back
[29:14] with evil
[29:15] report and I was just looking into all
[29:18] those things and you see sometimes and
[29:22] not sometimes those
[29:24] people who evil report even though they
[29:28] have came out from Egypt Egypt was still
[29:32] in
[29:34] them Egypt has not left
[29:38] them so if you read the scripture they
[29:41] were even looking for a leader to take
[29:43] them back to eat their
[29:47] garlic they were looking for a
[29:50] leader but you know what um there was
[29:54] two of them before I go
[29:56] there um every human
[29:59] being whatever comes out from you is
[30:03] something that is already inside of you
[30:06] you manifest whatever is hiding inside
[30:09] of you a very good friend of M always
[30:11] say that money does not make people
[30:14] Pride they have that Pride hiding
[30:17] somewhere so the money come to manifest
[30:20] whatever is inside of them if somebody's
[30:23] abusive husband he always have that
[30:26] thing in him so when the situation comes
[30:29] it man it magnify it so so is a seed of
[30:34] God if you are son or daughter of God no
[30:38] matter what situation will be pushed
[30:40] under whatever pressure be pushed under
[30:43] because that seed in you it will come
[30:46] forth and manifest Christ so all these
[30:50] people those 12 leaders they still have
[30:54] the Egypt in them it hasn't gone as of
[30:58] them so that's why they were able to
[31:00] bring the evil report even though they
[31:03] have grapes wonderful food that they
[31:08] brought from their
[31:10] spine you know and I don't know
[31:14] sometimes people get attached with fears
[31:16] and they act so quick even yesterday I
[31:20] was talking to a friend of mine he has a
[31:22] lot of he has Farms chicken gold this he
[31:27] said f third word is coming I'm not
[31:29] selling my chicken to nobody I'm going
[31:31] to eat everything by myself J you see
[31:34] people tend to accept evil report easily
[31:37] and act right away and they got all the
[31:41] camp to follow them and they were meming
[31:45] and crying and everything
[31:48] but the Bible said that Caleb was of a
[31:52] different
[31:54] Spirit Caleb Tes a bride amen he has a
[31:58] different Spirit he didn't look at the
[32:02] condition himself and Joshua they saw
[32:05] the camp and they said that our God is
[32:08] able to deliver us our God is able to
[32:12] give us the land only thou can believe
[32:15] all things are possible Hallelujah so
[32:18] now the people of the Joshua character
[32:22] with a Caleb character in them can stand
[32:25] on the word of God and believe that all
[32:28] things are possible to them that believe
[32:32] because they believe God's report yes
[32:34] sir tonight what are you believing are
[32:37] you going to accept that doctor's report
[32:41] and just accept it and embrace it and
[32:44] live in fear or are you going to accept
[32:48] God's report the true report that said
[32:52] by his stripes I am healed by his
[32:54] stripes I am made whole by his stripes I
[32:58] made whole he was wounded for my
[33:01] transgression bruised for my iniquities
[33:04] the chastisement of my peace was upon
[33:06] with him and by his stripes I'm Healed
[33:10] tonight I'm accepting God's true report
[33:14] regardless of what the doctor is saying
[33:17] regardless of my financial situation I'm
[33:20] not looking at the condition going on
[33:23] I'm looking at the true report that said
[33:26] that Above All Things I wish thou May
[33:29] prosper and be in health even as your
[33:33] soul prospered that's the report for me
[33:37] and I'm standing on that good report
[33:41] regardless of what around me because I'm
[33:44] not looking at my
[33:46] circumstances those people were looking
[33:48] at their
[33:51] circumstances they have a shallow mind
[33:58] excuse
[33:59] me they forgot
[34:01] easily what God did to them what God did
[34:05] for them they forgot how God by his
[34:11] servant
[34:12] Moses spoke and they have Locust all
[34:16] around their water turned into blood
[34:19] they forgot how God delivered their
[34:23] first children when they applied the
[34:25] token on the on the on the lamp post
[34:28] but Joshua and Caleb never forgot they
[34:32] forgot when they got to the Red Sea
[34:36] Pharaoh's Army was after them brother
[34:38] Danny and the Red Sea was in front of
[34:41] them they didn't know which way to turn
[34:44] and God spoke to Moses and they went on
[34:47] a dry
[34:48] land there was a time there was no food
[34:51] for them and God re Mana to feed them
[34:56] they forgot of all all the goodness that
[34:58] God has done for them and any little
[35:01] thing they begin to complain what I hate
[35:04] is people always complaining in
[35:06] memory because those things will not do
[35:09] you any
[35:11] good it will make you more
[35:14] miserable it will make your situation
[35:17] worse but if you can stand on the faith
[35:20] of God maybe it may linger but it will
[35:24] come to pass am it may come to pass amen
[35:28] the vision may stay long but it will
[35:31] come to pass because one thing is the
[35:34] word of God said by his stripes you were
[35:36] he he said that lay your hands on the
[35:38] sck and they shall recover God never put
[35:41] a timeline on
[35:43] that he just lay your hands on the sck
[35:46] they shall recover there was no timeline
[35:49] he will do it on his own time I think
[35:53] that's the tactic Nat is using said that
[35:55] I'm not giving anybody a timeline when
[35:57] I'm going to strike when the time comes
[36:00] I'm going to strike God never gave us a
[36:04] timeline it's the
[36:06] scoffers it's the unbelievers that try
[36:09] to put a Time on God's promise but a
[36:14] True Believer will stand on the promise
[36:17] of God regardless of the situation
[36:21] regardless of the condition regardless
[36:24] of what he's going through he will
[36:28] because the Bible has let us know
[36:30] clearly that there's two imitable things
[36:35] God can not
[36:39] lie said let every man's word be a lie
[36:43] but mine be the truth amen so God keep
[36:48] his word yes sir he kept his
[36:51] promises it should it should stick right
[36:54] in our heart our soul mind everywhere
[36:58] listen if you human
[37:00] beings sometimes I do work for some
[37:04] Builders we are build that
[37:07] relationship and I have confidence brani
[37:11] that these people will pay me so when
[37:13] I'm doing the work for them I'm not
[37:16] scared I'm not scared to start the job
[37:19] without even a deposit because they have
[37:22] built that reputation of keeping their
[37:25] word and you can multiply by million and
[37:29] billion and trillion times with God
[37:32] because even though I have confidence in
[37:34] these people their company can go to a
[37:37] bankrupt they can be in a situation that
[37:39] they cannot pay me but I'm still half
[37:43] confidence because they keep their word
[37:45] what about God who created the entire
[37:48] universe who is infinite God that knows
[37:52] today from tomorrow when you make a
[37:55] promise to Abraham you SW SW by himself
[37:59] he never swore by anybody else because
[38:02] there's no one greater than him and our
[38:04] God is on he kept his word he keep his
[38:08] promises and if this God keep his word
[38:12] and keep his promises then we have to
[38:15] put our
[38:17] confidence everything that we have in
[38:20] this word because that word will never
[38:24] fail and he has given us that promise I
[38:27] will never fail thee nor forsake thee so
[38:32] why are you worried
[38:34] tonight we should be the most happiest
[38:37] people on the face of this Earth because
[38:41] what God has done for us is beyond our
[38:45] comprehension the greatest thing that
[38:48] could ever happen to any human race any
[38:52] human being on this Earth that's what
[38:54] the Lord has given to you and and me the
[38:58] salvation of our soul is the greatest
[39:01] thing that you can talk of in this world
[39:04] there's nothing that come close to it so
[39:08] we should be the most happiest every day
[39:11] on this Earth no matter what we are
[39:14] going through because remember because
[39:17] we are Sons and Daughters of God all the
[39:20] enemies attack will be of thir all the
[39:22] time but the Bible said said many
[39:25] afflictions of the righteous
[39:27] but God deliver him out of it all so no
[39:33] matter what comes our way our God is in
[39:36] control greater is he that is in you
[39:39] tonight than he that's in the world amen
[39:43] amen so our focus should be on him our
[39:47] confidence should be on this great God
[39:52] hallelujah amen so what am I trying to
[39:55] say
[39:59] so as Joshua said and God told Joshua
[40:04] everywhere that your footstep he has
[40:07] given it to
[40:09] you
[40:11] so you have to have that confidence and
[40:15] step on the word of God outside our
[40:19] comfort
[40:20] zone we have to go beyond the
[40:23] camp and step to the
[40:26] Unseen and trust God that the god that
[40:29] has revealed the thing to us will keep
[40:32] his word because he's on time God and I
[40:37] believe that's the same
[40:40] confidence that
[40:42] job
[40:44] had no Noah
[40:48] have because in the time of Noah Noah
[40:52] was told to believe something that has
[40:55] never happened in his time
[40:57] that there is going to be a
[41:00] rain and it has never ever rained in his
[41:05] time but he has confidence in God that
[41:10] gave the promise it took
[41:14] 120
[41:16] years they scof at him they mock at him
[41:21] they did everything to him but he stand
[41:24] on the word of God and said said my God
[41:28] have said it I believe it the rain will
[41:32] come even though beyond all the
[41:34] scientific thing they have moveed they
[41:37] can move to the moon and check
[41:40] everything and said Noah you are an old
[41:43] man you don't know what you are talking
[41:45] about there's no rain in the sky but
[41:49] Noah said my God have said it and I
[41:52] believe it I'm standing on it he kept on
[41:55] building the ACT he kept on pushing he
[41:57] kept on pushing he kept on pushing he
[42:00] kept on doing it until God came and and
[42:04] and closed the AR by
[42:07] himself and then the rain came and what
[42:11] did he do it destroyed all those what
[42:16] scers that same God is here with this
[42:22] tonight we have been told to believe
[42:26] something that it has never happened a
[42:29] group of people in the world
[42:31] before and the people think that we are
[42:36] sometimes cucko here but we are not
[42:39] cucko Paul said the way they call heresy
[42:43] that's the way I worship my God one of
[42:46] these days in a twinkle of an eye we be
[42:49] changed and move up to be with our Lord
[42:52] amen the people like it or not we are
[42:55] going up you are not going down before
[42:59] as Mike was saying standing before any
[43:03] third world began this bride of Christ
[43:06] will take a flight amen so we are not
[43:08] scared of third world war we are not
[43:11] scared of the
[43:13] circumstances our confidence is in God
[43:16] of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that our God
[43:21] keep his promises yes he does he keep
[43:24] his promises so if he keep his promises
[43:28] then we have to stand on that Promises
[43:31] of God
[43:33] regardless of what we are going through
[43:37] tonight all that I want to leave here
[43:40] with you that we going to stand on that
[43:43] promise of God regardless of the
[43:46] situation regardless of the
[43:48] circumstances we're going to stand by it
[43:51] because we have a confidence we have a
[43:53] example here in Hebrews 11 some of them
[43:56] were son understand that some of them
[43:58] were put in firey furnace some of them
[44:01] were in the um in Lion's Den but they
[44:05] look to God promise and believe God and
[44:10] stand on the word of God one thing I
[44:14] think I'm going ahead of myself but
[44:16] regardless is
[44:18] that God doesn't like
[44:22] procrastinators when God reveals
[44:24] something to you you act on the word
[44:27] amen don't
[44:29] procrastinate L tomorrow may not be
[44:31] there for
[44:33] you act on that word of God once it's
[44:36] revealed to
[44:38] you because you read at the Bible I
[44:41] think I'm going over the place but I'm
[44:43] going to go I don't care just what is in
[44:45] my heart I'll spoke Abraham and the
[44:49] Patriarchs if you read the scriptures it
[44:52] said the self same
[44:54] day God spoke to Abraham he acted on the
[44:58] word by doing the circumcision
[45:00] circumcising himself and Isaac and and
[45:03] oh ishma and all his household you check
[45:07] all of them the selfs that the
[45:10] Patriarchs when God speak to them they
[45:13] act on it right away so whatever God is
[45:17] revealing in your heart to
[45:20] do don't wait because tomorrow may not
[45:23] be for
[45:24] you tomorrow May will not be for you you
[45:29] have to act right away so that the enemy
[45:32] will not mle the waters for you because
[45:36] when God reveals something for you act
[45:39] on it when you act it will come to pass
[45:43] because he that has revealed to you he
[45:46] that has made a thing known to you he
[45:49] going to bring it to pass
[45:52] regardless because God cannot fa and God
[45:56] cannot lie
[45:58] that's
[45:59] why okay I'm this I'll I'll talk about
[46:04] myself that I'll talk a little bit about
[46:06] myself too so God cannot lie and God
[46:10] cannot What fail so when
[46:13] God tell you to do something he expect
[46:17] you to act on
[46:20] it Abraham did that Isaac all the
[46:24] Patriarchs they never
[46:27] wait once is clear to them they act on
[46:31] that word of
[46:34] God that's why someone like
[46:38] um um blind
[46:42] bimus braam talk about his
[46:47] life being
[46:49] that
[46:52] um his
[46:54] wife was sick and at that time he has
[46:59] they use that turtle dove that's what
[47:02] they use to
[47:03] attract the rich people to give them
[47:07] money so that's what he used to make his
[47:11] jokes his his play so he can attract
[47:14] people to give him money when his wife
[47:17] was
[47:19] sick he what he told God that if you
[47:23] heal my wife I'm going to offer this
[47:25] totle Dove to you
[47:28] and God heal the wife he offered the
[47:31] ttle
[47:32] D and before I go there there was one
[47:35] time that even there was a prophet or a
[47:37] King when he went the war he promised
[47:39] God that the first thing that will come
[47:41] and dance he sacrifice that and his
[47:45] daughter that he loves he came she came
[47:49] the first thing and that King sacrificed
[47:52] that daughter because that was a promise
[47:54] he made to God and
[47:58] the Patriarchs those people they kept
[48:02] their promises so blind matimus when his
[48:08] daughter God sake I know you know about
[48:10] the story I'm just repeating it he asked
[48:14] God if you heal my
[48:17] daughter I'm going to sacrifice with the
[48:21] lamp the very lamp like dog that lead
[48:24] the blind people the very lamb that lead
[48:29] him he promised God to offer that lamb
[48:36] and when
[48:38] God healed that daughter he kept his
[48:42] path of the
[48:45] promise
[48:47] so
[48:49] when I came God called me to this
[48:53] message and I'll see with that proper
[48:56] immigration papers and trying everything
[49:00] I know you guys were born here you don't
[49:01] know what it is to be in the country
[49:03] without that um permanent residence even
[49:07] though I have the um the insurance C to
[49:11] work everywhere I was working with my
[49:13] own papers for like seven years six
[49:15] years and eight years that I still
[49:17] didn't have that and when I read about
[49:21] black
[49:23] bimos I believe it literally BR whenever
[49:28] I read and listen to that voice on the
[49:30] tape it become so real to me that my
[49:34] this is so clear this is rare I'm going
[49:36] to do exact same thing because this
[49:39] thing was so rare and clear when I
[49:41] listened the prophet talking about him
[49:43] the inspiration caught me so much and I
[49:47] said no I'm going to act the same way
[49:49] this man has acted and I promise God
[49:52] that when he opens door for me I'm going
[49:54] to send th000
[49:57] support the missionary work at that time
[49:59] of voice of God and I gave that promise
[50:03] and then I went to see Pastor Simon and
[50:07] it's like my situation at that time the
[50:10] was saying the only way that you can get
[50:12] a right to live in the country you have
[50:14] to get married and I told pastor but
[50:17] deep in my heart I didn't believe that
[50:20] but that's what I was being told and
[50:22] Pastor said no Phillip I don't believe
[50:25] in that we serving a living God who has
[50:29] done for so many people if you have met
[50:31] somebody's different story but let's
[50:33] trust God and all my heart that was what
[50:36] I was looking for and within a couple of
[50:40] weeks BR Simon came and preached very
[50:45] powerfully and said that the
[50:49] Patriarchs because they believe that the
[50:52] god they are serving will always keep
[50:54] his part part of the promise he will
[50:57] never fail them God honest his word more
[51:00] than his name so when they have any
[51:03] Covenant with God they don't wait for
[51:06] God to do their part of the bargain they
[51:09] go right away and do their part because
[51:12] they are human and they can fail but God
[51:15] will never fail so when P Salon spoke
[51:19] that that W strike my soul like a magnet
[51:22] within that very night you preach on
[51:25] Sunday Monday I send that ,000 to pay
[51:28] for to support that missionary work and
[51:31] within a week that problem was solve why
[51:35] because it's the same yesterday today
[51:38] and forever so what am I saying it's a
[51:40] little small a tiny a testimony but I'm
[51:44] just saying that God can do more in a
[51:48] bigger picture whatever you going
[51:50] through tonight you have to keep your
[51:52] part of the promis keep your part of the
[51:56] by gain because God will always keep his
[52:00] part there's a part you have to play you
[52:05] have to put your foot forward footsteps
[52:09] mean possession that's why in Revelation
[52:13] 1 to3 it says Those Who overcome I'll
[52:16] give you to do this the Overcomers the
[52:18] Overcomers it's all being the Overcomers
[52:21] how can you overcome except God in you
[52:23] overcome for you but you have to give
[52:25] him an opportunity and Surround every
[52:28] because he overcame death hell and Grave
[52:33] and sickness and everything and he that
[52:35] overcame that is in you so you have to
[52:38] accept it what he did on
[52:42] Calvary every death was was was
[52:47] everything death hell and Grave were all
[52:50] what were were were conquered by him so
[52:54] he that overcame that is in you and in
[52:57] me amen so he has already conquered so
[53:01] all that you have to do take him at his
[53:04] word you have to overcome yourself it's
[53:07] yourself that you have to overcome you
[53:10] have to overcome your pride you have to
[53:12] overcome your unbelief you have to
[53:14] overcome the little things that SP the
[53:17] vine you have overcome things that is
[53:20] you know that's not right that you are
[53:22] feeding on you have to overcome the
[53:25] things that is H distracting you
[53:28] especially in these days the social
[53:29] media you have to overcome
[53:32] yourself and make sure that those social
[53:35] media is not using
[53:37] you you are supposed to use
[53:41] it but we become so distracted because
[53:45] it's all over you can't it's a it's an
[53:49] age they know exactly things that you
[53:52] like so immediately you just go on those
[53:55] things just come popping up it pop up on
[53:57] you and then he begin to use you move
[54:01] here left right left right left right
[54:03] left right by time you realize you come
[54:05] like two three 4
[54:06] hours but you have to say no I'm
[54:10] controlling you I'm just going to search
[54:12] what I like I spent couple of once I'm
[54:15] throwing away you cannot control me you
[54:18] have to fight it's a battle it's a b to
[54:21] get
[54:22] hereon yeah it's a
[54:25] fight but you have to keep on
[54:28] fighting keep on keep on he say if you
[54:31] know what await for
[54:35] you I have not seen ear have not heard
[54:39] what God has in store for them that love
[54:44] him and that God loves you he cares for
[54:48] you he cares for one on all of us the
[54:52] main is sometimes
[54:58] sometimes we forget who we
[55:02] are and
[55:04] sometimes we neglect one another we
[55:07] think we can make it by ourselves but we
[55:09] need one
[55:11] another very very we need one another
[55:14] very important I remember sometimes
[55:17] certain things even your body you don't
[55:20] see how important they are unless
[55:23] something happen to
[55:25] it and I remember couple of months back
[55:28] I have a problem with my tooth and that
[55:31] tooth about 10 or 8 years back the
[55:35] dentist did
[55:37] um Ruth canine and put a gold on it and
[55:42] after like years I'm having pains so I
[55:45] went back to him he said oh I got to
[55:48] take this out I have to fix it I said no
[55:50] I'm feeling pain take it out I don't
[55:52] need it he said no let me let's maintain
[55:56] this I said no I'm feeling pain just
[56:00] take it out and I know how important
[56:02] that tooth is to me until you took it
[56:04] out then I realized my mouth is my
[56:07] tongue is going there this is happening
[56:09] there that is happening there so I
[56:11] didn't see the importance of that until
[56:14] the the Mind took it out so it is you
[56:17] and me sometime you don't see the
[56:19] importance of one another so you have to
[56:23] respect and love one another once you
[56:26] have an opportunity let's appreciate one
[56:29] another let's know that we need one
[56:31] another because I need I I covered your
[56:33] prayers I need your prayers you need my
[56:36] prayers so little things that you need
[56:38] from one another but we don't sometimes
[56:41] think that we are full of
[56:43] ourselves but let's pray for one
[56:46] another let's stay for one another let's
[56:49] trust for God for one another amen our
[56:53] God is good all the time and another
[56:58] person who
[57:02] never who
[57:05] never um who stood by the word of
[57:10] God is
[57:13] Abraham and we are abrahamic
[57:16] seed the Bible said that
[57:19] Abraham never sted at the promise of God
[57:24] he was constant
[57:26] ly giving praise to
[57:30] God and that God is in you and in me
[57:34] Abraham didn't look at his
[57:38] conditions he have
[57:40] confidence in God that gave him the
[57:44] promise even though it seeks to be him
[57:47] it seeks to him to be to able to give
[57:51] birth
[57:53] scientifically there was no way Abraham
[57:56] or Sarah could give birth at their
[58:00] age so Abraham initially in his
[58:05] own natural life he was telling God that
[58:09] God give me um um elazar to be my thing
[58:15] he said no no no you're going to have
[58:17] someone from your own what
[58:20] loons and Abraham believed that true
[58:25] report from God it doesn't matter how
[58:28] old he was it doesn't matter how old
[58:32] Sarah was he look to the one who gave
[58:36] that promise that he's able to keep his
[58:40] word so he never stacked at that promise
[58:45] of God he was constantly giving praise
[58:49] his confidence in God was so much great
[58:54] that when the time came
[58:56] for God to ask him to
[58:59] sacrifice the very child that he has
[59:02] been waiting for for 25 years he was
[59:06] still
[59:07] willing he never
[59:09] complained he told them the servants
[59:13] that the lad and I we are going to
[59:16] worship and what we are we come back yes
[59:18] sir he didn't know how he was going to
[59:20] come back but he believed he was going
[59:23] to worship and come back and it God
[59:26] spoke his needs into existence by
[59:30] providing a sacrifice for
[59:33] himself and you been a daughter or son
[59:36] of Abraham the same God that spoke
[59:41] Abraham need into existence tonight is
[59:44] able to speak your need into existence
[59:47] if thou can believe whatever you going
[59:50] through
[59:51] tonight my God is able to supply all
[59:55] your needs amen let's keep him at his
[59:59] word at his promise he said he has his
[1:00:03] Variety Store everything you have need
[1:00:06] of go to that supermarket and grab it
[1:00:09] healing Deliverance children whatever
[1:00:12] you have it's free of
[1:00:15] charge it's free it's not for sale
[1:00:19] without minding without price and the
[1:00:22] people don't want
[1:00:24] it why the people worry thems no wonder
[1:00:29] that the prophet asked the king is not
[1:00:32] not a a b of Gilead in in um there's no
[1:00:37] B of Gilead over there why the people
[1:00:40] are talk about why the people are
[1:00:42] worrying our God is more than able to
[1:00:47] supply all your needs to speak your
[1:00:50] needs into existence because as he did
[1:00:53] through Abraham he's going to do it
[1:00:55] through you going to do TR me because
[1:00:58] he's not a dead God he's a living God
[1:01:02] and God kept his promises he said that
[1:01:05] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:01:07] our Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:01:08] Forgiveness of your sins and you shall
[1:01:11] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if
[1:01:13] you genuinely repent and you baptize in
[1:01:16] his name God is going to fill you with
[1:01:18] himself it's simple as that he keeps his
[1:01:21] promises he said the promise unto you
[1:01:23] and to your children and to them that
[1:01:26] are far off as many as the Lord Our God
[1:01:29] shall call is God still calling if he
[1:01:32] still calling then he's still able to do
[1:01:34] that because God hasn't changed he's the
[1:01:37] same yesterday today and forever as he
[1:01:40] did through the apostles he promised to
[1:01:42] leave we are the new book of us another
[1:01:46] book of us being written we are the
[1:01:49] written Epistles read of all
[1:01:53] men don't look down upon yourself
[1:01:56] he one time somebody came to this
[1:02:01] church a friend of mine left him here he
[1:02:04] came couple of months and I thought that
[1:02:09] I was just saying what the Lord has done
[1:02:12] for me just to encourage him God knows
[1:02:16] my heart and this man said oh you brag
[1:02:20] too much just like bra Bram asked the
[1:02:23] person I'm not bragging about myself and
[1:02:26] bragging about the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:02:28] problem that people forget is that this
[1:02:31] Bible that you reading brani is the life
[1:02:34] of the Apostles it's the life of the
[1:02:37] Patriarchs it talks about the life of
[1:02:39] Abraham it talks about the life of Job
[1:02:41] it talks about the life of all those
[1:02:43] things when the people are reading they
[1:02:44] feel so God but when that life has come
[1:02:48] right now in me it came like he said
[1:02:52] that he is
[1:02:53] um Jesus Christ all that God was he
[1:02:57] poured into Christ and all that was in
[1:03:00] Christ he poured into the church so like
[1:03:03] he was the one he died on Calvary and
[1:03:07] divided himself and came on day of
[1:03:09] Pentecost in the apostles is that right
[1:03:12] and then he used the braam as a wave
[1:03:14] sheath he took his Prophet that same
[1:03:16] spirit is here with us so that same God
[1:03:20] that was in the prophet that was in the
[1:03:22] apostles that same God is in you and in
[1:03:24] me so whose life do you think you going
[1:03:26] to read again it's your life it's my
[1:03:29] life God has done through them and our
[1:03:32] life has to line up with what is in the
[1:03:34] word once your testimony lines up with
[1:03:37] this gospel then don't don't don't feel
[1:03:40] shy to talk about it let everybody know
[1:03:44] what God has done for you let the people
[1:03:46] know what God has done because he's the
[1:03:49] same yesterday today forever some people
[1:03:51] they feel good when they read what he
[1:03:54] has done in the past but when you tell
[1:03:56] them what God is doing now at present
[1:03:58] tense they begin to M against it they
[1:04:01] begin to whisper against it they been to
[1:04:04] gossip against it but the same God
[1:04:07] remember those people are what as scers
[1:04:10] if they were to believe in the time of
[1:04:12] Noah they'll be scoffing Noah if they be
[1:04:15] living the time of Paul and the apostles
[1:04:18] they'll have that Spirit of Demas and
[1:04:20] forsake Paul those are the people they
[1:04:22] were to be in the time of the 12th of
[1:04:25] the
[1:04:26] of the of those um two million people
[1:04:30] who the 12 leaders who who doubted and
[1:04:33] bring an evil report that's what they're
[1:04:36] going to be doing because when the word
[1:04:38] is put in flesh it becomes a trouble for
[1:04:41] them no wonder about whoever deny Jesus
[1:04:44] Christ has come in has not come in flesh
[1:04:47] is Antichrist because he's in flesh now
[1:04:49] it's the
[1:04:50] body and they are failing to recognize
[1:04:53] it and they're criticizing the body they
[1:04:56] don't know that they're criticizing God
[1:04:58] in the body is the same God the was the
[1:05:02] P they feel so good about him oh they
[1:05:05] like to read about him but they fail to
[1:05:07] recognize when he's you know walking in
[1:05:11] two feet on the a that's what is going
[1:05:14] on now God even his bride doing exact
[1:05:17] same thing he did back then because he's
[1:05:19] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:05:23] yeah God is awesome God hallelujah it's
[1:05:26] wonderful God Amen praise God
[1:05:32] hallelujah all that God is looking for
[1:05:35] now is an
[1:05:38] individual it's
[1:05:41] one that will
[1:05:44] become will let God have full
[1:05:48] preeminence will let God have full
[1:05:52] control because God don't need so many
[1:05:54] people he had only one Samson and he
[1:05:58] conquered the whole Philistines he one
[1:06:01] David just one Noah just all one person
[1:06:06] who are willing to die to himself and
[1:06:10] let God have preeminence one person like
[1:06:14] Phillip who was so obedient the word of
[1:06:17] God that he left all the um the Revival
[1:06:21] that he having Samaria and listen to the
[1:06:24] voice of God and go and meet only one
[1:06:26] Enoch that's what God is looking for
[1:06:30] that the bride of Christ will come to
[1:06:32] the
[1:06:33] place that we will be so preminent we we
[1:06:38] give him so preeminence that we not even
[1:06:42] going to say anything unless he tells
[1:06:44] you to
[1:06:46] move you won't do anything unless he
[1:06:48] tells you what to do and he's directing
[1:06:51] all your footsteps and he's getting the
[1:06:54] glory for himself oh man how God will be
[1:06:58] so happy when their sons and daughters
[1:07:01] reach that stage and they fully know
[1:07:04] full
[1:07:06] preeminence yes he's using this don't
[1:07:08] get me
[1:07:09] wrong he's doing here little here little
[1:07:13] there little there little there but
[1:07:15] before we leave it has to be
[1:07:18] foolest so that it's in full
[1:07:21] control that there won't be nothing to
[1:07:24] hinder his FL low amen so that he can
[1:07:27] have the full preeminence and use as
[1:07:30] mightly because God wants to pour
[1:07:33] himself more into us more than what we
[1:07:36] even think or expect he's an awesome God
[1:07:40] and He Loves Us amen so I'm just going
[1:07:43] to read this to just um cap it
[1:07:48] off in how can I
[1:07:51] overcome paragraph 68
[1:07:58] okay from step now think hard now if you
[1:08:03] are laying around getting dirty get in
[1:08:06] hurry quick cuz the door might close at
[1:08:09] any
[1:08:09] time and there is
[1:08:12] always been an act in God's
[1:08:16] economy there was an act in the days of
[1:08:20] Noah for the saving of his people the
[1:08:25] was an act in the days of the
[1:08:28] Law act of
[1:08:30] testimony in the days of the law they
[1:08:33] followed the ark and there's a third
[1:08:36] dispensation now like Noah's time L's
[1:08:41] time and now this time there is an AR
[1:08:46] now and that AR is not a
[1:08:49] denomination neither is it a good work
[1:08:51] that you do is by one's spirit Romans
[1:08:55] 8:1 we are all baptized into one body in
[1:09:00] the domain of that Kingdom one spiritual
[1:09:04] baptism no matter how good how bad
[1:09:07] whatever you are in that Kingdom by the
[1:09:10] Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only
[1:09:13] way you overcome is all that's under the
[1:09:16] shed blood is overcome it CU you cannot
[1:09:20] overcome yourself it is he that overcame
[1:09:24] for you you you are resting amen it's a
[1:09:31] resting time Bron you can please come

[1:09:46] and in his guidance that's what we are
