TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hallelujah. Then then he says that's for members of the church. But then if they are not members of the church, not members of the congregation, they should be made to be in a position to be ruled or governed. They've got to listen to our orders in here because this is the orders of the local church. This is things we don't want to do, things we don't like to do, but it's things that must be done. Amen. And I'm exposing myself here by telling all this on the deck. It's me. They can hear me talking and know that it's coming from me, not just from you men. Talking about the deacons and the trustees. You've asked me these questions. I'm giving it to you the best I know how from the word of God. And if these people get angry and go out from you, what does the scripture say about it? They went out from us because they wasn't of us and that settled them. Right. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now you say they will not listen because of children. The children are supposed to know discipline from hope. Amen. Right. That's right. The children are not to come to Sunday school to learn the Sunday school is not to be the uh kinder garden, right? It's it's to be the house of God where they taught the word of God, right? And brought up in the faith. But in the modern age, we find parents that just dump their kids even in the schools and and the and the teachers unsaved or saved makes no difference. Uh the teacher supposed to train them. They're supposed to get manners from the teacher. They're supposed to have this. But yet, you are not to discipline them. Don't raise your boys. Matter of fact, one grandfather, one man took a a teacher to court because the teacher mentioned something about hell and said the child couldn't sleep all night. And you know, he just talk about, you know, something the kids were talking about and we asked him if there's a place called hell and he made a mistake of telling them what he knows about hell from the Bible. And actually, you know, the guys before the court because he described hell so graphic that the child went into a nightmare and and the parents were so angry. They didn't understand that they that was the opportunity to lead that child to Christ. Amen. They didn't know that that was the opportunity to lead that child to Christ right there because why did all the kids in the whole class, why did they not sleep the whole night? Because it wasn't for them. It was for that one child. and that child would have been led to Christ. But of course, they didn't understand that. But here we are. Praise God. He's saying here now children are supposed to know discipline and they should get it from home. And even if it's mine and my kid come here and get disorderly, I don't want you to draw back and draw one string uh because it's brother Brandham's kid, Sarah, Rebecca, Joseph or Millie, whoever it might be. You tell me and I'll see to it. And if they don't behave, then they'll stay away from church till they learn to behave. This is not an arena. That's right. Is that right? This is the house of God. Amen. This is not a place to play. Amen. And skate and write notes and laugh and joke. This is the house of God and is to be carried out. You come here to wash, not even to visit. It's not a picnic ground. It's not a visitation place. This is if you want to say it's a visitation place, it's a place for the Holy Spirit to do a visitation. Listen to what he has to say and to look not to one another. We don't come here to fellowship with one another. We come to fellowship with Christ himself. This is the house of worship and children must be disciplined by the parents. Let it be known that if these parents and the children will not listen to what these deacons say, then the parents should be corrected themselves. Right? Praise the Lord. You remember the other place where we said it's not a problem of juvenile delinquency. It's parental delinquency to their duty. Right? Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. The children are behaving that way because of delinquency of parents and it shows up. Praise God. Okay. Hallelujah. Now, so that's where we we we we have got through this now. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I don't want to repeat myself. He says, "Now then you may have to call in say, "Brother Jones or sister so and so, we've called you here for a meeting. You're part of us. You're one of us. Let me set this straight now." Amen. We have asked you to make your children behave. If they won't behave and you can't make them behave in the church, then we are going to advise you to leave them with someone while you come to church until they learn how to behave themselves in the house of God or you teach them to behave in the house of God. See, but this is an order for God's house and it's got to be carried out. Praise the Lord. Is that right? Praise God. Notice I like I mentioned to you that wasn't just for the natural children. That's for spiritual children too in Christ. Amen. We got to have godly behavior if we want to attract um invite, attract and keep the presence of the Holy Spirit working among us in such a way that at any time anything can break out. We don't have to have a special time, right? We don't necessarily have to jump like um prophets and keep a whole lot of noise and then we say that's the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit should be able to come anytime he chooses. Amen. Amen. Whether we are talking, whether we are singing, whether we shouting, whether we are quietly praying, he is sovereign and he reserves the right and we should allow him to step in the middle of the service at any time. Amen. Praise the Lord. Do you believe that? I believe in the Holy Spirit. I believe in the power and presence of God. And I um dedicate myself to um the restoration uh of the gifts, not only justification and sanctification. Amen. But I also believe in the restoration of the gifts that brother Brandon did only come to restore the word, but to demonstrate the gifts and then let us know that they're not gone back in the days of the apostles, but they are here for us today. Is that right? Too many pregnant only believe in the restoration of the word for the hour. But they don't realize they're looking for restoration and gifts back in the church too. And it's all here again for us. But if you're not conscious of it and you're not aware of it and then it begins to break out amongst you, if you don't know it, you could criticize it. You're going to call it this, you're going to call it that, and whatever else. But then if you understand what is really happening is that the church has to be perfect exactly like it was back in the beginning and God was just adding all the virtues that were in that church. All of Samson's hair that was on his head has to grow back. Every strand has back got to be back in place. Amen. So that he has the strength to defeat the devil. That's right. As we come to the end of jour of of the life's journey. Amen. Praise the Lord. Shall we pray? Our gracious heavenly father, once again, we thank you that father uh we welcome you and we thank you that you showed up and you took the word and spoke to us and we are living here with more understanding than when we came in. We are living here with a clearer uh crisper walk with God. We pray you'll strengthen everyone. And father, if there be one here tonight, uh troubled heart, troubled mind, we pray that you will speak peace to their soul. Peace be still. Let there be a great calm and confidence that we serve a living God who is able to deliver, able to provide, able to protect, able to watch over us, our children. our belongings, our home, everything that we have, everything that we love, you promise you'll watch over it. You'll protect it. Our children near and far, wherever they might be, Father, overshadow them with the great wings of the great Jehovah, Father. And now, as we go from this place, we come again on Sunday. We pray for the minister, brother, lighter gifts. May he truly be an enlightened spirit, anointing of the Holy Ghost to bring the word of God. Bless us, Father, as we come with thanksgiving in the house of God. I was glad when they settled on me. Let us go into the house of the Lord. My feet will stand within your gates, oh Jerusalem. Father, we grant it, Father God, and bless your people. And Father, add something to the church that will take us in another dimension every day, in every way. Let things in our lives get better and better and let us grow into your grace. Thank you, Father. Dismiss us with your blessings and your protection on the road and for the rest of the week. Give us, oh God, wisdom, knowledge, and favor with man, course favor with you, and favor with the people we have to deal with, so that all things should go smoothly and sweetly under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. As we walk right into our blessings, as we walk right into our inheritance reserved in the heavens for us, we surrender to your perfect will and let the wind of God blow us where it will. The wind blows where it lists. No man knows where it goes. But sons of God, daughters of God, led by the spirit of God, this is what we surrender ourselves for. You take the praise, though. You take the honor and the glory, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. The Lord bless you, brothers and sisters. Amen. Praise the Lord. And follow Jesus to the cross every day. Don't be ashamed.
