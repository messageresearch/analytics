maili and his dear wife Jennifer uh their friends maybe relatives in the front here and of course the rest of you Believers that have gathered with us this morning to give God praise now as you know we are gathered here not to have h a sermon from me or from anyone else but we are gathered here this morning to celebrate the ordination of veto Danny maili uh this really is not a celebration for Danny uh himself though his presence here with us of course is greatly significant rather We Gather here to celebrate the supernatural activity of the holy spirit in our midst in the fact of his choosing of Dany for this position of pastoral Ministry and authority of course uh Danny is of God's own choosing it wasn't my choosing there was no headquarters choosing it was no superintendent or or anybody's choosing but God's choosing amen and in all this we are here first of all to celebrate the Supreme deity of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ can you say Amen to that and it's to him we present this church we present Our Lives we present Danny to him for his Blessing and his the wonders of his divine presence of course we also celebrate the Lord for it's he that directs our missions he's the one th that directs our purpose of changing the world one person at a time do you believe that amen I was standing in the middle of the city of Lagos in Nigeria one time on a mission trip that city has 20 million people and as they were passing by like rivers of humanity the thought hit me so strongly Lord what can I do to help these masses of people and like a voice speaking inside of me saying just do what you can just do the little that you can I in other words I understand the implications I have many others to use for other things but just be faithful in doing what you can so we celebrate the Lord Jesus who calls men as his agents on earth into Ministry for his glory and for his honor amen and I want to thank God also for helping us to experience Dan's Ministry and also to recognize it in our midst we thank God for that from right Among Us God has raised up someone to fill this position of being pastor of this local church we give God the glory amen hallelujah so we honor God's choice of Danny in this wonderful position so I'm asking you right now and I'm going to ask the musicians just to come back right you don't mind uh I'm just going to move along as I feel led to move along here I don't feel any restrictions bondage legalisms or anything like that on me is that okay am so we want to join our hearts and hands and our voices and praise God and give him glory we want to sing one song uh here at this point one song maybe not all the verses but the words are very significant for what we are doing as God calls Dany into Ministry speak my Lord speak my Lord musicians here someone to play the piano war huh all right uh piano or no piano that's my you can't play a guitar you can't play a sitar I at least I can play the motar so so we're going to sing and we're going to praise God Amen even just one verse he the Lord of harvest sweetly calling who will go and work for him today who will bring to me the lost and dying who will Point them to the narrow way I just said those words and my heart is touched already praise God here the Lord of harvest sweetly [Music] calling who will go and work for me today will bring to me the lost and [Applause] d who will Point them to the narrow way speak my Lord speak my [Music] Lord speak and I to answer the speak my Lord speak my Lord speak and I will answer Lord send me thank you very much God God bless you all and thank you so much I want to call for Minister Tim beers to read for us a very significant scripture out of the New Testament reading from Ephesians 4 starting from verse 7 come Minister B years according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he said when he ascended up high he captivity cap and gave gifts unto ascended what is it but he also descended sorry about that now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all Heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto perfect man unto to the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ God bless you thank you Minister beers and now we will have Minister Christopher Fong reading to us out of uh John praise the Lord reading from John 5 from verse 14- 16 afterwards Jesus finded him in the temple and said unto him behold Thou Art made whole sin no more lest the worst thing come upon thee the man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him hold and therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the Sabbath day day amen thank you Minister beers but I have to thank you very much for reading that that's my mistake and writing it down I wrote down the wrong scripture that's not the scripture I wanted but somehow God knows where it fits in to this this entire thing right uh let me uh read what I have here John 15 reading from 14 you are my friend s if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you no more servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth much fruit and that your fruit should remain and whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you now you must understand that the word ordained is really nowhere else in the Bible except when Jesus used it here saying I ordain you now we know that n's ordination is not uh just here on the Earth But as God spoke to Jeremiah and said I know you from before you were even in your mother's womb and I called you to be a prophet thank you Jesus and so we see at this time that God's call has come to our precious brother now the word ordained really means to appoint I've appointed you to be a prophet it means also to place someone in a position Place placing of a son so so I have ordained you or placed you or set you apart in this particular position to do a certain job and so as it was in the book of Acts we find out that Paul and Barnabas were set apart you know how the elders the spirit of God revealed it to the elders these are the ones to go out and to be missionaries and then what did the elders do they laid their hands upon Paul and Barnabas prayed over them and then sent them out as missionaries to the glory of God we want to do the same thing here for God's glory and for God's honor so ordination in short uh reveals to us God's call to Ministry and to carry out his Divine will it also the Earthly ordination I'm speaking of speaks of the church's approval of that individual as they carry out God's will it is also an acknowledgment that God has bestowed certain spiritual gifts into the life of this individual we know and call Danny to be able to perform the the work that he has prepared for him for God has said clearly I will send no one into battle without providing them with the weapons that they need he says first of all who will send a soldier to war and not provide him with the weapons he needs will I send you to go to my work and not provide you with the gifts the weapons that you need to do the job that is the way God looks at this of what he is doing therefore when we pray here uh we are we are not here to impart any gifts we are not here to lay hands and to add something to the individual we cannot do that God has already bestowed upon that individual and fill them with those things for his glory now what I'm saying that the individual may not even be conscious that those qualities powers and influences were embedded within their lives but as they step into the office they grow in maturity in that position and then these things begin to exude it begins to flow out of them and they become a greater blessing than they thought in their own mind because it's God's will being done his glory that we are here for today and I pray that God's spirit will rest upon our brother God will fertilize his mind his heart God will bless him in such a way that he will go beyond himself amen and move as we say in the spirit of almighty God Amen and become a blessing to all who come in contact with him amen amen yes sir so this individual now being ordained I believe he should live an exemplary life I believe he's already living one but I am still here to say these words that he might hear it again by repetition that it might rest within his soul that he should live an exemplary life he becomes the model for the church the model for the young people the model for all those who cast their eyes upon him he is the representative uh here that you should model and recognize that God is using him for his glory praise the Lord amen of course uh brother Danny your first responsibility is to the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen and your second responsibility is of course to the local church right that's what it is and to be in that position functioning as a leader and functioning in that way by your behavior uh the way you carry yourself so that uh the Jesus Christ may be reflected through your life to others amen and may you also grow into a greater and greater sense of responsibility to carry out this office amen hallelujah now I want to give brother Danny a charge and when I say I'm not using the word charge in the sense of an rest but just as God charged Joshua and says go but uh go but go with courage don't go in fear just go forward keep going forward Don't Look Backwards whatever happened behind there in the desert that's all behind you go forward amen and remember this I'll be with you you're not walking alone this unseen presence of a living God Who We Believe lives and Reigns today he is not dead he is no more in the grave he is not a statue on the wall he is not just a picture you have in your house you can't warm Yourself by a painted fire and we are here to live by the power and the presence the experience of a living God this God whom we talk about this eternal spirit when we come into a real Church of God like this and begin to talk about him his presence draws near we can't see him with our eyes but he promised us one day there'll be a Rapture and when there's a Rapture then we'll see him face to face and thank him and tell the story save by Grace Hallelujah Danny God has called you to this work of the ministry and the people sitting here has a have affirmed you in that position of this ministry because they've seen what has happened through the Expressions coming out of your life and out of your word words and preaching and work they have seen that in your life and the church today recognizes your call they recognize your call and we recognize it by setting you apart publicly as the prophet said a son comes to a certain place of maturity then he's taken out into a public place and there he is placed into his position right so we thank you for being here today and trust God that you will live up to this great responsibility I recommend you and commend you to the scriptures that God has given us hold to God's word as we love to sing that old song Hold to God's unchanging hand hold to God's unchanging [Music] hand build your hopes on things Eternal hold to God's unchanging hand amen I want you to pay attention especially to the words of our Lord Jesus and allow his words and his teaching to be a directive a charge to your entire Ministry oh may God help you I've been to the Mount of Beatitudes several times I wish that you could be there even if it's in your mind's eye and it sit with the young ministers the disciples that were sitting at the feet of the Lord Jesus as he instructed them on what it means to minister and to be a minister so what I'm saying is that you should allow the instructions that he gave those young ministers the Beed to as we know them to be let them be a a a direction a beacon for your life that you might live by the word of the Living God Amen let that be a charge for your ministry and remember you are the salt the influence that comes from your life comes from your heart through your lips by the preaching of the word it goes out it touches the light of others to transform lives to change Hearts change homes change young people deliver people just as Jesus preached the word and deliver men and women from demons now you said oh the devil has disappeared there's no more devil there's a still a real devil in the world he still corrupts he still lies he still cheats and robs you of your peace of mind he'll rob you of your health he'll rob you of of your the the Tranquility of your home he'll rob you in every possible way he'll addict you to something or the other he will misdirect you from off of the genuine Bible in some way or the other but you stay close to the word and hold to God's unchanging hand amen that's the way you ought to do it amen you are the salt of the earth you know salt is a great preservative if things are uh before things can even start rotting and you put some salt it will preserve that amen so God wants to use you as a preservative he wants you to be one that sheds forth uh light and life and Power and his presence working within your life amen amen so you are God's light to a world of Darkness you're finding and you know this there are less and less people in the world that have integrity honesty truthfulness that will live by God's word they think it's oldfashioned to be honest to be truthful to have integrity to Stand by Your Word and to Stand By God's word you think that's oldfashioned and that's just for you people go to church and you get emotional they don't realize it's real and when you check when you realize it it's real and then you want to live your life that way praise God hallelujah so that's my chge so you be a light so that others can see they won't see the original Jesus that was back there 199 100 years ago but they can see at least men and women and pointing to you as the new pastor of Good Neighbor Ministries that they can look at you and see the Life of Christ reflected through you thus bringing glory and honor to his great name amen praise God and we being as the scripture says Jesus said be ye perfect as your heavenly father is perfect amen so you are to try to be perfect as much as you can Hallelujah now we know no earthly man can't really be perfect you're going to stumble here you're going to stumble there you'll make mistakes but the point is God is letting you know I've placed something in you that will keep you I plac the word which is an anchor in you storms may come your mass may be broken your ship may be shattered it may move from every side to side but you have an anchor that will keep your soul it keep your being amen he'll hold you amen so hold to God's unchanging hand God bless you in every possible way and you know even though I'm using some notes that I plac together here during the week that is not just the notes you know this is coming from my heart uh to you and may God bless you in every way praise God follow the lord Jesus's directions to pray be a man of prayer that will separate himself every servant of God in the Bible right through were men of prayer they'll steal away somewhere by themselves they'll quiet themselves that they can hear the voice of God speaking to them either in their conscience or sometimes literal all of us are not blessed to hear the vocal or uh you know auditory um God's voice like that but most of the times he'll speak into our heart and we recognize that's different that wasn't my thought I never thought of any such such a thing and when you know that God will use that for his glory amen hallelujah now learn to be forgiven giving and also learn to forgive yourself right uh that's very important that we learn to forgive ourselves because some people don't know how to forgive themselves and they keep condemning themselves for one little mistake or stumble that they made yeah no you must not only forgive others but also learn to forgive yourself very important amen and put your trust your faith your confidence not in natural things right but put your uh trust in Heavenly things think about the things that are above praise the Lord and God will bless you in every way amen heaven the kingdom of God will provide all your needs God will provide your needs we know God has a plan and his plan is right here in the church you've heard it preached God said it that he sends his servants and even from the Old Testament he says the priests are going to minister to you as you plow the fields and King your uh you know carry on your flocks from that you will take at least least 10% and let that be given to that priest and that has followed right down through the Bible to the New Testament and so to this time we know God will provide our brothers needs it's not us because what you are giving there is not even your own right because God said it's my tithe that's the my tith you give it to me I give it to the priest that he might might be able to take care of himself and of the house of God that is here before you amen so build on the Lord Jesus Christ because you're building on a rock and when the storms come it won't be able to shake that house because you built it on a sure Foundation amen I repeat again pattern your ministry after the Lord Jesus himself and thus you will become his hands amen you believe we can become his hands amen you can become you will become his voice praise God hallelujah you become his heart loving the world loving the suffering the dying the trouble the tried the tested the tempted yes your whole heart will go out as his went out he'll give that that to you that you might be one with him amen praise the Lord so be like him a teacher be like him one that is filled with the meekness feed my sheep he said to Peter and feed my Lambs don't only feed those mature ones that need uh the mysteries of the word of God being preached to them but learn how to teach the young those that are just coming up teach them the ABCs of the gospel and bring them into Christ Paul puts it this way the older ones they can eat the meat just like you wouldn't just take a piece of steak and put it in a baby's mouth and then Paul goes on to say the sincere milk of the word so some needs the milk of the word and some needs the meat of the word and you need to know when to minister that to that particular individual for God's glory amen so then go to all places that God will call you go to all people to whom God will call you go and make disciples as he said in Matthew 24 go and baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost who we know is the Lord Jesus Christ for Peter in Acts 2 238 knew what was the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost and he didn't go and just repeat that over people but he says go baptize them in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah and teach others to observe only scriptural things things let them practice only scriptural things and as you go Remember You are not alone for Jesus said go For You are not alone I will be with you always even to the very end of the age that's why I say he's not in the grave but even now that we're talking about him he's here amen you believe that amen I believe he's here while the disciples were walking on the street on the road to EMAs they were talking about him and the Bible says and as they were speaking of him he drew near he drew near he was supposed to be dead but he drew near and this is the same way we are on our way to glory and we're just talking about him and you just think it's casual but it's not because when you begin to talk to him his presence draws near to us praise the name of the Lord God hallelujah brother Danny sister Jennifer you come before this platform it's just if you can KN do you have a couple of um things they can kneel on here very good you came prepar with that is there other one no not face face the congregation if she needs it more than you then she
