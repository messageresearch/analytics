TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] Let's give God an applause. [music] Happy to be in the house of the living God today. Our psalms will be taken from Psalms 34. I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord. The humble shall hear thereof and [music] be glad. Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let [music] us exalt his name together. I saw the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears. They looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed. This poor man cried and the Lord heard him and save him out of all his troubles. The angel of the Lord encamp [music] round about them that fear him and delivered them. Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed is the man that trusted in him. Fear the Lord, ye, says, for there is no one to them that fear him. The young lions lack and uh and suffer suffer hunger. But they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. Come ye children hearkening unto me. I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is he that desires life and love many days [music] that he may see God? Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips [music] from speaking God. Depart from evil and do good. Seek peace and persecute it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his airs are open unto their cry. The face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off [music] the remembrance of them from the earth. The righteous cry in the Lord [music] heard and delivered them out of all their trouble. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and safe such as of a contrite spirit. Many are the afflations [music] of the righteous, but the Lord deliver him out of all. He keepeth all of his bones, not one of them is broken. Evil shall slay the wicked, and they that hate the righteous shall be [music] desolate. Let's read the last one together. The Lord redeemth the soul of his servants, and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate. Amen and amen. Praise God. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand this Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Change my mind.

I give you all [music] the glory. I give you all the honor. [music] Oh, you are [music] great in your miracle. So great.

Amen. Bless the Lord. Amen. Give him a hand clap of praise this morning. Hallelujah. [applause] Oh, if he's not here, [music] what are we doing? But he [music] promised he'd be here this morning. You believe that? &gt;&gt; If you believe it, then act like it. that the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, the most high [music] God, the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the Lord Jesus [music] Christ is here. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. Heavenly [music] Father, we appreciate you so much this morning, Lord. You are great indeed. Father, you are mighty [music] and true, and you're great in battle. Oh, the lies that would be told in the years of your people, [music] they must depart because you indeed are great in battle. You have [music] never lost a battle. Lord, you are the great physician this morning who cannot be denied. Lord, you are the one who has taken us from the uh from the low points and taken us and placed us on higher ground. Lord, you are the one who has opened our eyes. You are the one that has made a way that where there was [music] no way. Father, you are the one who has sent your word in this last day. Father, if it wasn't for that, Lord, where would we be this morning, Lord? But that's why we sing, you are great, God. We're not just singing a song or just mouthing [music] words, Father. Truly, you are the mighty God unveiled before us, Lord. [music] And we bless your name this morning. We bless your name. and we bless your name. We praise you. We glorify you. We magnify the name of the Lord this morning cuz there's no one like you, Lord. You are so true to your people, Father. You are so wonderful this morning, Lord, that we don't have words to describe the mighty God in our [music] midst this morning, Lord. The word unveiled, oh God, and the things that you're doing, Lord. Oh, God. Raise a standard this morning, Father. If there be anybody, Father, that needs a touch from the mighty hand of God, may the Holy Spirit just sweep over their soul and cause a change to take place. Oh Lord Jesus, we thank [music] you, Lord. We thank you. We bless your name this morning. May the word just penetrate our the [music] the the darkness and may it penetrate the the shells and the all the things that Satan, your your enemy, has tried to put up. May the word just penetrate, break through, and [music] and may it find a resting place in our souls this morning, Father. And we will give you all the glory, Father. We will give you all the honor. We'll give you all the praise because we know, Lord, that without you, we are absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; Not a match. We're not a match for the Satan and his works. But with you, we can do all things. [music] Father, we [snorts] thank you this morning, Lord. May you bless your people. bless our [music] time that we spend here this morning. In Jesus lovely name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated. God bless you. A flat if you would, Michelle, please. Oh my my my. It's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. I [snorts] heard this yesterday. [music] Brother Brandham speaking. He says, "This church never takes a tribulation period." [music] You believe that? You cannot put nowhere the church in tribulation. And I'm going to say church with a capital C. All right? You can put the [music] you can put the church there, the nominal church, but not the bride. &gt;&gt; See, the bride has gone on. She has not one sin, not a thing against her. [music] The grace of God has covered over her. And the bleach has took away every sin so far away. [music] There's not even a remembrance of it. Not a thing of but purity [music] perfect in the presence of God. Is anybody identifying with that? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a day of identifying with something you identify with that. How many can say that's me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Is a glorious church without spot wrinkle. [music] She's washed in the blood of the lamb. [music] Oh, it's a glorious church. [music] It's a glorious I [music] [music] [music and singing] standing on the promises of Christ my king and through eternal [singing and music] Just let his praises for glory [music] in the highest standing [music] on the promises of God. We are [music] standing of God. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We are standing on the proes of God. [music] We're standing on the promises. [music] I now can see there's perfect in [music] the for [music] everybody. [music] This is &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, we [music] are standing. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; We are standing [music] on the promises of [singing] God. Oh, it's a glorious [music] church without wash. [music] [music] [music] Heat. Heat.

Everybody should be smiling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you ready? Are you ready for your trip? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "The bride has made him herself ready." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you. You can [music] be seated for a few minutes. And I I can say one thing about that bride [music] being made ready or has made herself ready. What you're doing right now is you're making yourself ready. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; But if you walk out of here and you don't receive the word, you made [music] yourself unready. All right? So, let's have a good attitude this morning and and with the word and let uh [music] let the master just come and and do his thing. You got the brothers are ready. They're at the they're ready for the take up the offering. Praise God. Come ahead, brothers. And we'll we'll do that. Praise the Lord.

Brother &gt;&gt; Bill, come and and bless the offering. &gt;&gt; Uh let's [music] bow before the presence of the Lord. Father, we're so thankful, Lord God, that you give to [music] us, Lord God. And we didn't even ask for it, Lord. But Lord, here we are again. Time to take up the offering, [music] Lord, to give that little portion back, Lord God, that blesses you [music] to where you need it to be, Lord.

We have [music] another one. [music] Oh [music and singing] my lovely. You are my own. [music] Have you consider [music and singing] all you know [music] from [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Have you consider [music] you consider this [music] little off to dece her. Oh, you [music and singing] have tried no fair [music] from east to west or danger to see [music] a great [music] God bless. Bless you all. It's good to be here with you once again. I just want to give a very brief testimony before I sing. Um on New Year's Eve, um we were here in this in the service and uh brother brother, um the pastor was brother Danny, sorry, brother Danny preached a sermon on uh burning the ships. And if you recall, he had each one of us write on a piece of paper uh [music] the things that we wanted to burn. And there was a fire pit here and we all walked and burnt those pieces of paper. Um I made my list and at the top of my list was [music] unbelief. And since then, I'm beginning to realize that what took place in that service has ignited a series of occurrences that have started a transformation. And what is happening in my life right now is a result [music] of what happened in that service. And so fast forward in August, at the end of August, there was a youth meetings here. Um, and on Sunday, Brother Diggs preached a sermon called, "If not me, then who?" Now, I was diagnosed [music] with cancer on August the 12th. And when the doctor called me and told me that you have cancer, I laughed. [music] And the laugh was not due to disbelief or um uh denial. The laugh was because I had been dealing with the tumor for several years. And to me, it was dead. It was gone. It was not an issue. It was [music] like history. And so I laughed kind of to say, you know, it's kind of late to tell me that now. And I went into the washroom and I just hysterically burst out laughing. And a voice from within me, it wasn't audible. The voice said, "Who told you that?" And that was the sermon that Brother Miguel preached on the Saturday. [music] Now, 10 days later, on August 22nd, I was talking with my brother Ben. And we were talking about how we need to really put our faith [music] in action and and mean business with God. And I made a statement. I said, "If not me, then who?" And that's the title that Brother Digs preached on the Sunday at the end of August. Now during that service he had he talked about David and Goliath and he uh demonstrated [music] how David cut off Goliath's head and held. He had each one of us holding our hands up like this to testify that we have Goliath's hand. I was sitting around about the third row from the back. I had the tumor on my left breast. My hand was sore. It was difficult for me to raise my hand. But I raised it in faith and [music] I was testifying Goliath is slain. And in my heart I was praying. I said, "Lord, please let this hand of mine show up in that camera as a [music] testimony because I wanted that to be recorded." And sure enough, when I [music] went to check out that video, the camera zoomed back [music] and my hand is there in the video. And I held my hand up high longer than everybody else just to be sure that my hand would appear. And I was saying that this Goliath is slain and I'm going to come back with Goliath's head. So when I after the surgery, I talked to my surgeon and I I asked her for Goliath's head. She looked at me as [music] though I had three heads on and but I was very serious and [music] um you know this is uh it's a big deal and this situation is bigger than the physical aspect of me having the tumor and the cancer and uh I won't go into detail it will be recorded so all the details will be provided but just to hit the highlights [music] is uh I do have Goliath's head [music] and the rest of the Philistines are in trouble. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; So I just want to sing this song to give glory to God. What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer? [music] There is no more [singing] for heaven now [music] to give. He is my joy, my rightousness [music] and freom, my steadfast [singing] [music] love, my deep and bounding peace. [music] To [singing] this I hold. My hope is only Jesus. [music and singing] All my life is wholly bound to him. [music] Oh, how strange and divine I can sing. [singing] All is mine yet [music] not I, but through Christ in me. The night is dark, but I am not [music] forsen. [singing] For by my side, the [music] Savior He will stay. [singing] I [music] labor on in weakness and rejoiceing. [music] Oh, in [singing] my need his power is [music] displayed. To [singing] this I hold. My shepherd will defend [singing] me. Through the deepest valley [singing] he [music] will lead. know the night has been won and I [music] have overcome yet not [singing] I but through Christ in me. [music] No fate I dread. I know I am [music] forgiven. [singing] My future sure the price [singing] it has been paid. For Jesus [music and singing] bled and he suffered for my pardon. [singing] [music] And he was raised to overthrow the grave. [music] To this [singing] I hold. My sin has [music] been defeated. Jesus now [music] and ever is my plea. [singing] Oh the chains are released. [music and singing] I can say I am free and not [music] I but through [singing] Christ in me. [music] To this I hold my hope is only Jesus. [singing] All the glory ever more to him. [music] For when this race is [music] complete, still my lips shall repeat. Yet not I, but through Christ in [music] me. With [singing] every breath [music] I long to follow Jesus for he has [music] said that he will bring [singing] me home. And day by [music] day he is [singing] renewing me [music] until I stand before him on the throne. [singing] To this I hold. My hope is only [music] Jesus. All the gloryy [singing] ever more to [music] him. When this race is complete, [music and singing] still my lips shall repeat. Yet not I, [music] but through Christ in me. Oh, when [music and singing] this race is complete, still my lips shall repeat, [singing and music] yet not I, but through Christ in me. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [singing] [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise [music] God. What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Healer of the broken pieces. If you put that up for us. [music] Praise is wonderful. We'll [music] do the verse uh chorus first. Healer of the broken [music] pieces. You [music] touch my heart and bathe in you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Now my whole life I [music] surren down before the men. Lord I give my life to you. [music] Love that s before I knew you. Amen. You [music] brought me near has brought me near to where you are. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Now I live to praise you ever [music] may I praise you healer of mine. [music] Everybody know you're the healer. [music] Oh, you [singing] are the heer, [music] the heater of my heart. [music] The [singing] maker and the go of all we are. [music] I was the broken. I was the broken [music] vessel in your head. You look beyond the hurt and made me. [music] Oh, he of the broken pieces. You touched my [music] heart and made it. [music] And now my [singing] whole life I surrender. Lay down before the [music] I give my life to you. Love that [music] song [singing] before I knew you has brought me [music] here. Oh, praise God. This is the now I live [music] and now I live to praise you. [music] Now my life is yours forever. [music] Oh, and now my life is yours forever. [music] How many can say this this morning? I'm in [singing] awe [music] of who you are. Now I praise you, and now I live to praise you. [music] [music] Amen. Glory to God. [music] Glory. Hallelujah. He's the healer of our hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the keeper of our soul. He's the deliverer in our midst. [music] Amen. Praise God. God bless you. Welcome everybody into the house of the Lord this morning. [music] God bless you musicians. Thank you so much. Praise God. We just want to welcome all of our guests and visitors this morning. God bless you, Sister Ruth, Brother Bernard. It's good to have you here this morning. We enjoyed your testimony. Praise God. Welcome everybody into the house of the Lord this morning. I trust that you're all uh here to uh be uh you know caught up into heavenly places where you can receive a portion of word today that you can you know this is this is where God um feeds us. Amen. This is the house of the Lord where he prepares a meal for us &gt;&gt; and uh we come here and we get strengthened by the word of God. We go back into the into the challenges that we must face because we're all going to face challenges until we leave here. We're going to face them. But by the grace of God, he gives us word so that we can overcome them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, um, next weekend, um, we're having our general meeting, um, and it's for tithe paying members next Sunday, November the 9th. You know, um, you might wonder, tithe paying members? Um well you know tithe paying members are members of the church that belong to the church have identified as being a family member of the church have taken a position in the church and it's not a position like you have to have a position like a trustee or a deacon or or an usher or whatever you know a position is when you've identified that you are a part of the body of Christ, you recognize that you're a part of the father's business. Like Jesus said, I must be about the father's business. And this is this is what and who we are. We're about the father's business. Amen. Praise God. And in every business, there's there's workers, there's uh leaders, there's managers, there's uh cleaning committees, there's all these different aspects of a natural business. Well, we operate the spiritual house of the Lord. Amen. And this is the house that God has given us. And so, as a a true um faithfilled believer, you need to understand your your obligations as a son or a daughter of God. And that is that you've recognize you're part of God's business. You recognize that God is the provider. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the giver of your paychecks. &gt;&gt; Listen, when you identified yourself as a son or a daughter of God, you come under the economy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a blessing to come under the economy of God. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it's beyond it's just it's beyond financial blessing. I'm not talking about financial bless. That's just one of the aspects of the blessings that come as a part of God's economy. But it's understanding that God is the one that he brings you into his business. He gives you and pays you the funds that you those paychecks you receive every two weeks. Listen, God can cut those paychecks off at any time &gt;&gt; and he can increase them at any time. You either believe God is God or you don't. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. &gt;&gt; And when God gives you a $100 and all he says is to give back to me a tithe, a tenth of that. And when you do that, you're identifying that yes, Lord, you are my supply. You are my provider. You are the one that that that that provides all of my needs. And that revelation on tithing is only one revelation that actually expresses through your entire walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's only a small aspect. But when we come to dealing with the business of God, we're dealing with God's building, God's expenses, God's renovations, God's mission work. &gt;&gt; Dealing with God's mission work and supporting the work of God. If if we can't go, then we'll send somebody. &gt;&gt; We are an we are we are a an active missionary church. We're building. Next week, you're going to hear about the building programs and some of the different things that we are uh supporting, you know, um in different areas in different parts of the world for the work of God. Amen. Praise God. I don't know why, you know, I'm going into all of this, but but you need to understand that our meeting next week, we want those that are that are really a part of the body. And if you haven't been identifying as part of the body, then you can start right now, right? Amen. If maybe you've missed something, maybe you're you're you're you're deceived in some way or whatever. I don't know. But, you know, just let the Holy Spirit speak to your heart here and identify yourself and and and you know, take your stand. Either you're with or you're not and your life is going to express it one way or the other. Amen. Praise God. So, we certainly appreciate um you know that uh this ministry has always operated that way. You you're never going to hear us as the leadership pulling on money. Oh, you gotta give. you got, you know, you're not you're not guilty. We need this or we got this and you know, no, we just present to you what God has laid upon our hearts. And God has always provided more than enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we don't rely on certain individuals. We rely on the Holy Spirit to move into into people's lives. And and those that are open to God's blessing, God just pours through. &gt;&gt; God just gives opportunity. God just blesses and opens the doors. This is this is the God we serve. This is this is how we are in a Listen, this is about probably a four to5 million property and we owe peanuts on it now. &gt;&gt; And that's not something that we did. That's something that God did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no way we can look back and say, "Oh, we did this. Look at you know how many of you can do something like that?" It's not something that when you come into God's economy, you trust God, you stand behind the vision of the leadership and you and you catch that vision. You become a part of that vision. You start to see yourself in the walls. You start to see yourself in the instruments. You start to see yourself in the chairs. What is it? It's the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so I'm so glad. And this is the message of the hour. Amen. Let's go to the word of God. Praise God. We've been on this series of uh you know the purpose of God and we've been um you know talking about adoption, how we've been called unto adoption and God is you know bringing us into maturity and all these aspects of you know of what we just talked about here. It's all part of showing where your level of maturity is in the body of Christ. Where how are you walking with God? where where are you at? What like what what's your understanding of a of of a son or a daughter that's come to maturity and to stand and you know to to understand that God is you we've been looking at obtaining our inheritance. Amen. You go to the next slide. You know, we've been looking at obtaining our inheritance and today we want to continue. The last couple weeks we were looking at it and we just we're just letting the Holy Spirit, you know, unveil and open up things. As I study and as you pray and as you believe, then God just comes and meets our needs. Amen. This is the mystery of preaching. Amen. I I I'm not a deep preacher. I get scared every time I come up here. That's the honest to God's truth. God is my witness. Okay? Because I realize that this is the living God. This is the this is the the ministry of Jesus Christ. And the and the only thing that we can do is get out of the way and allow him to do his part and to reveal. I'll do my part. I'll study. I'll do I'll pray. You guys do your part. You need to pray for me. You need to pray for for for the ministry that the God that the Lord will just give us exactly what we need so that we can fulfill our part. We have a purpose. We have a part. Amen. Praise God. So um today we want to continue on. Let's go to our scripture. It's from 1 Peter chapter 1:es 3-5. It says here and before we go there, let's just pray. Father, Lord, we we invite you to come this morning, Lord. I'm needy this morning. Father, I need your your your inspiration, your your anointing to come into the atmospheres to feed your people. Father, Lord, won't you come and just break the bread of life this morning and and do for us, Lord, more than what we could even possibly imagine. Lord, we want to leave here rejoicing. Father, this is this is uh our uh portion of the word here this morning. So, we receive it, we accept it, and we believe it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Praise God. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible. Amen. Praise God. That just jumps right out of the scripture. to an inheritance because we've been talking about, you know, coming into our inheritance. And here it kind of just, you know, identifies the inheritance a little more. And, you know, especially in this hour, amen, that it's an incorruptible inheritance. It's something that that's never going to fade away. So, incorruptible means it's not even of this world because anything that's of this world corrupts. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, this is wonderful. Undefiled. and that fadeth not away. So, it's undefiled. It means that it's it's completely sinless. Praise God. Amen. And it and it can never fade away. And where is it? Reserved in heaven for who? &gt;&gt; For you. &gt;&gt; So, you've got an inheritance. It's got your name written all over it. It's undefiled and it's reserved for you in heaven. Amen. And then look at look at verse five. Who? Not what. Who? So it's talking about a person. &gt;&gt; It's talking about you. It's talking about an individual. Amen. Are kept by the power of God through revelation. Faith unto salvation. But this is the beauty. Ready to be revealed in the last time. Amen. the Lord add his blessing to the word of God. You may be seated. What a wonderful scripture. Amen. You know, um it's just tremendous. There's so much that we're going to be drawing out of this um scripture here over the next couple of weeks because I believe that, you know, it'll be today and maybe next week that that that the whole, you know, um revelation and and the thought and what it is that that I saw, you know, as I was studying and as I was looking into these things that that, you know, the the the picture just becomes so real that this incorruptible inheritance, it, you know, it just speaks the word of the hour. It just speaks the revelation of the hour that we're in the season of the rapture. Amen. Because this corruption is going to put on incorruption. &gt;&gt; This mortality is going to put on immortality. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's all around the revelation of our inheritance and the word for this day and for this hour. Listen, when you got called to this message, I remember when I came, you know, and the Lord called me to this message and we started to and I started to hear about the rapture. The rapture. I said, "Wow, this is this is incredible. This is supernatural. This is where we're actually going to be translated out of this dimension." Because listen, you know, you know that when when you know when you you come to an understanding of God, you've got to know that God is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when then you go back, you listen to the prophet, you hear the supernatural that took place around his life, the things that that that he did supernaturally, how people were dead, were raised back up again. Amen. That, you know, discernment in ways that only could be God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of a sudden when you hear those things and then you know you hear of the rapture then you come to understand that the rapture is absolutely what this world needs &gt;&gt; especially in this hour because the world is going into total chaos. Amen. And so God has made a way for us to to uh be delivered from this dimension by way of a change from mortal to immortality. That's why Jesus said, "I go to prepare a place for you." Amen. That where I am, you may be also. He's talking about that dimension. And we've, you know, we've covered all of those things. But this this revelation just never stops unveiling itself. Amen. This incorruptible inheritance is what, you know, excites my soul. Amen. Here I was thinking, you know, I was going to inherit, you know, the blessings of God by him just blessing, you know, here on earth. He says, I'll bless you. I'll prosper you. I'll, you know, I'll give you houses in this world. Amen. So, so there are blessings that can come from serving God in this dimension. And it's wonderful to receive all of those blessings. But then he's talking about an inheritance that goes beyond this time dimension here, this mortality over here. Every day aches, pains, it's it's I look in the mirror and I, man, you're getting old. &gt;&gt; You know, you you you not getting any younger when you look in the mirror, okay? You get disappointed sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you young people enjoy your youth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And praise God. Enjoy that that muscle that you know like man I used to go like this and it was like now I go like this and it's like man you know it's just it's just not there anymore. What is it? Because this this vessel is is in corruption. &gt;&gt; This earth is in corruption. Amen. There's nothing here that that that is eternal. The only thing that is eternal is what we feed on, the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what's translating us into our position of sons and daughters of God. Amen. Praise God. And so, you know, I want to look at this and it's going to kind of evolve in a way, but you know, our destination or the completion of this inheritance, this incorruptible inheritance for us, it's the it's the rapture. Amen. It's the body change. It's the revelation on our translation from this dimension to the next. Amen. That's what the culmination of the inheritance of the incorruptible inheritance is all about. Amen. Praise God. But here we are now. I want to read the um the next quote. Okay? Because you know we we we would need to know and understand why God chose us. What it is that God is accomplishing in this day and in this hour. And he goes here. He goes and he says, "Now, now what do you think the writer of this book?" Now, he's talking about the scripture that we just read. You know, the he's talking about Ephesians, right? the writer of this book that seen it and seen where it would be manifested in the last days, waiting and groaning for those sons of God to rise in the last days with the power of the Holy Ghost at the end of the age to reveal the secret things from the foundations of the world to bring it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. And here now, brother Brandham's talking about the adoption of the sons and daughters of God. That the that the earth is actually in groaning. It's groaning to bring forth the the the manifestation of the sons of God. Because listen, the manifestation of the sons of God is going to fulfill the scripture of the rapture in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why she she's she's the she's she's the the the the the super church that's been raised up in the last days to bring forth the sons of God. Amen. And we are in the adoption stage that leads us into our position as sons of God. And it's only in this time that we come to this level of maturity that will actually produce the rapture. &gt;&gt; There's elements that God ordained because you know if you look back and you go back into the mind of God before he was even God, he was the self-existent one. And what he did was he created angels. Okay? And those angels were basically created and it was at that point that he became God because they worshiped him. Without the angels, he could not have been God. But then he goes and he creates a son and he he he expresses himself an Adam. And it was at that point that he actually became a father. So it was there that sons were actually manifest at the very beginning. That was his original plan at the very beginning. Amen. And so the what he had planned in his mind at the very beginning is what he's going to actually manifest and fulfill in the end time. Amen. Because everything you know you know what happened? The fall took place. Adam forfeited the book. Amen. What what book? the book of inheritance, the book that the sons of God in the last days are to take and to fulfill the the the original plan of God from the beginning from before the foundations of the world. That's why he knew that you would come to this church. You would come to this revelation. You would come to this understanding of sunship. Amen. That's why, you know, there's so many different churches out there and they're talking about, you know, being a son of God and being a Christian, but what what where's the revelation on their true position as a son of God when they read the scripture that says that you were predestinated &gt;&gt; unto the adoption of sons &gt;&gt; from before the foundations of the world. Where's the revelation on all that? Where's the understanding all that on all that? What? That God just predestinated and says, "I'll make you a son. I'll make you a son. I'm not gonna make you one. I'm not gonna No, that's not the way he did it. &gt;&gt; He saw exactly what he would require. He saw before the foundations of the world that his thoughts would go forth into the world in order to manifest what he saw." He said, "My word shall not return unto me void." Amen. &gt;&gt; And he and and if you are a son or a daughter of God, you were not created. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you were expressed &gt;&gt; Adam, let us make man &gt;&gt; in our image &gt;&gt; in the image of God. So when God expressed Adam, he was in the very image of God. He was in theophony. &gt;&gt; He had a theophony body. He had a body that was eternal, that looked like a man, that was expressed on the earth as a man. Amen. And God knew that when the word went forth and he sent you, where were you when the sons of God shouted &gt;&gt; together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that all took before the foundation. Where were you? He was telling Job, when when I when I laid the foundations, when I did this, where were you? You see all what was what was God saying? He says, "I've got a plan. This plan is going to be manifest. It's going to it's going to come to pass." That's why Job said he caught the revelation. He says, "Though the skin worms eat this flesh, I will I he saw the resurrection." &gt;&gt; He saw the revelation on the body change. He saw that he would be in a theophony body. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew that there was that there was a plan that that God was going to fulfill. Amen. and you being a part of the thoughts, the attributes that were expressed from God in this last day, you can't help but recognize the word. That's why you heard this message all of a sudden catches your attention, draws you into the church. You start feeding on the word. You start to hear about a prophet. All of a sudden, you take it back to the word of God. Everything starts to kind of ful, you know, kind of make sense. Everything starts to open up. All of a sudden, you start to see this. Then you, you know, then then then you see the the the that that by God's fornowledge, he could predestinate you. So, he actually saw you knew that you would want this. &gt;&gt; He knew that you would want this salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew that you would want this revelation on who you are because he knew that you were he knew that that that when when he woke you up that the that the revelation in you would immediately go and and reflect the word of God. &gt;&gt; It would just look to the word. Look to the word. The word says this. This is what the word says I am. This is who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so all of this started to manifest itself around your life. Amen. And so we we uh you know, we're in a progression right now &gt;&gt; of our sunship. We're in the adoption stage. Amen. But at some point, we're going to manifest sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now by revelation we are we are expressing the nature of God. The Holy Ghost that's in us has a purpose within us to express God's nature, God's purpose, God's desire. That's why you separate from the things of the world. That's why you you you become a part of this ministry. That's why you can't identify with with the denominational teachings on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's an element that that you just cannot be deceived. You just don't understand it. But there's there's it's the Holy Ghost. It's the nature of God that's come and take and possessed you and taken over you as a son. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. And so you're you're you're anointed by the Holy Spirit to overcome the age that you're in. &gt;&gt; You face challenges. You face situations. you, many of you, I know it was a challenge even to get here this morning. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; But there's something in you that overcomes &gt;&gt; and you're going to look back even a year from now, you'll look back and you'll still you see yourself in the house of the Lord. And if you can't see yourself progressing in God, then you need to go back where you left them. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you find yourself in a in a condition where you're just never satisfied, you're you're you're you're you're just, you know, you're not a like a Christian should be the happiest person in the world. I'm not talking about putting on happiness, but I'm talking about the joy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The joy of the Lord. Amen. This listen, the rapture is all about bringing you into ecstasy of the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what the rapture actually is. Amen. Even if you look up the word rapture, it means extreme joy. Amen. Praise God. This is what you are. This is the part of the word that you are. And you cannot remain the same. You've got to be growing and expanding your revelation of who you are in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, you know, there's there's so I want to read some scriptures here. The Lord led me to these scriptures here from the book of Hebrews because I believe that, you know, because of the the the time and the season that we're living in right now, okay, there's an element of deception in the land. And this is always going to be an aspect of your walk with God to overcome the deception that's around you. until we get out of here. The Bible said it would get so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect &gt;&gt; if it were possible. So, so if if this is the hour that we're in and there's a and there's a deception that's still around us as sons and daughters of God in this process of adoption, we need to recognize the character and who we are and what it is that we're actually supposed to be expressing. Because a lot of people, they just say, "Oh, I belong to the message of the hour. I believe God sent a prophet. I believe I I belong to a message church. That doesn't place you into the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; You see, it would be so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect. Means it's got to be right close by. &gt;&gt; The deception's got to be right around you. &gt;&gt; It's got to be right there to the point where whoa, &gt;&gt; you're going to say, "Are you kidding me? You mean I've been this brother and sister have been coming to the church for so long. This brother, this individual, this one here, and all of a sudden there's a there's a there's a there's a seed of discrepancy within them. There's a there's an element within them that that that that that they've for some reason they're not they're not walking in the same revelation that you are in the liberty of the sons of God under the anointing of the mighty angel himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that whole element now is what we want to just take a look at as we mature because this is all about adoption, right? Adoption is where the sons and daughters mature. They they they they start to, you know, become aware of their their calling. They become aware of who they are. They become aware of who they're working with. You know, sometimes you work in a company and there's one guy that's after you all the time trying to get you fired, trying to trying to bring you down. You know, he's not your he's not your friend. He pretends to be your friend. [laughter] That's the enemy. That's the devil. Amen. Praise God. So, so we need to, you know, we need to come to a place where we need to mature. We need to, you know, stand as as true mature sons and daughters of God. So, here now, let's read from Hebrews chapter 3. Amen. We're going to take some scriptures here and we're just going to comment on it as the Lord just kind of unveils certain aspects here. For every house is builded by some man, but he that built all things is God. So we know that God has this great plan and he's the one that's built it all. Amen. And look, and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after. But now here, so here now we want to see here. We want to bring it to the message of the hour. Amen. Praise God. We want to we want to we want to come home. We want to recognize where we're at. We want the Holy Spirit to just, you know, lift off any hidden things because we're the ones that that that are actually going to manif uh manifest the mysteries that were kind of, you know, hidden, the hidden mysteries. Amen. And we come into this what's called the fellowship of the mystery. We're going to be looking at more of that later on. Amen. And so this whole element here now Moses being a type, brother Brandon being a type of Moses, he was faithful to all that he was given in his house. Amen. But Christ as a son over his own house, whose house are we? Okay, now we're talking about adoption. We're talking about sons of God. You got to follow me here. Okay, this is very simple, but there's something that we're that we're that we're going to, you know, that the Holy Spirit, you know, is going to bring out for us. Amen. And it says here, but Christ as a son over his own house, whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end, &gt;&gt; unto the end. And there's going to be sons of God that are going to come out on the end in the end time that are going to stand firm, that are going to hold firm to their sunship &gt;&gt; because they're under Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go to the next scripture. Wherefore, now he goes on to explain, "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith today, if you will hear his voice, &gt;&gt; amen." A lot of people say, "You only got to listen to the voice on the tapes." They're the only thing you need to listen to. You don't need anything else. You need to just listen to the voice on the tape. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the voice on the tape. I believe it was the voice of God speaking through our prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I listen to those tapes every single day. But Christ is alive and well now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to bring this to a place where we get a a clear understanding of of where the voice is now today. Amen. Can you still get fed? Can God speak to you through the tapes? Can God do supernatural through the tapes? Absolutely he can. &gt;&gt; He's done it for me. He's spoken lift to ear. I listen every single day to those tapes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But I want to know what God's doing in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. So that they can come into their full maturity and full manifestation of the part of the word that they are. &gt;&gt; William Brandham fulfilled his part in the word. But like we read last week, Joshua said, he was told by the Holy Ghost, "My servant Moses is dead." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you you take them over. Amen. Praise God. So here he's and this is what this was talking about. This is what Paul he was going back and he was explaining to the Hebrews. Amen. The Jews about, you know, because they were all stuck under, you know, oh, we believe Moses, we believe Abraham, we believe Moses, we believe Abraham. And there's a people in the land today that's, oh, we believe William Brandham. We believe, listen, I believe William Brandon, &gt;&gt; we believe this ministry would not even have come forth without the teachings and the and the and the fulfillment of the seventh angel messenger. We're going to see how important he really is. Amen. But they're they're they're missing the element and and the and and the part where where where it brings us to the day that we are right now and what what it is that's going to actually bring into manifestation the sons of God in the last days. He says here verse 8, "Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of the temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works 40 years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do ear in their hearts and they have not known my ways. Listen, God did so much supernatural through William Branham. His ministry went around the world seven times. He unveiled he listen he exposed all of the mystery and of iniquity. He exposed the Catholic Church. He exposed mystery Babylon. He his message was come out of her my people. Amen. Praise God. He exposed all of those things. Amen. But but that's not our ministry. &gt;&gt; That's not our ministry. That we're we're we're the continuation &gt;&gt; of the revelation that he brought forth when the mighty angel came down in 1963. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to recognize the handing off of the ministry from Malachi 4:5, Revelations 10:7, the angel on on earth when he introduced us to the mighty angel. We need to recognize there is a transformation there there's there's a there's a a you know a dispensational change of the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's always been what he's doing. Amen. Praise God. But there's people that have hardened their hearts. They're staying un they're staying in that one place. &gt;&gt; They hear me talk and they, you know, maybe, you know, you hear a minister saying, "Listen, it's not just the tapes." And you think, "Oh, they're against the tapes." We're not against the tapes. &gt;&gt; We support Voice of God every year. &gt;&gt; We support them. We believe that that that that the message of William Brandham needs to be sent out throughout the world because the people when they receive the Holy Ghost, they're going to see the importance of his message &gt;&gt; because God has an elected people. God has not one of them is going to be lost. Every single one of them's got to come in. They're going to see every aspect of this message. Amen. But there's many that have hardened their hearts. They've come to a place where they don't want to move on. They don't want to they don't want to let the five-fold ministry take control and and and bring Christ into the present stage of his ministry. What and and bring into fulfillment the manifestation of the sons of God which is going to produce the rapture. Let's read the next scripture. For we listen he goes Paul he says for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end. We're partakers of the word. We're partakers of the anointed word. That's what Christ means when we talk about Jesus Christ. He was the word. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. Amen. And so the word being manifest in this day and you catching the revelation of the day means that you're a part of Christ. You're actually a part of the manifestation of God's word in this day. Amen. While it is said today, if you will hear his voice, you got to continue to listen for his voice. They'll tell you, "Oh, you got to just play the tapes." They'll tell you, "No, no, you you should be just playing the tapes." And yes, you can have a pastor. You there, you know, it's fine to have pastor and everything else in the church, but you should be playing the tapes and then the pastor can come up and he can comment on it and, you know, he can exhort, but he's just to say basically and exhort on what the prophet said. Well, we actually do that. I don't play the actual tapes, but when we put up all the quotes and we're exhorting and we're we're we're actually bringing forth the message of the hour in the same way, but we're we're allowing the mighty angel himself, Christ, &gt;&gt; to come on the scene himself &gt;&gt; so that he can speak to your personal situations, &gt;&gt; bring you out of your personal deceptions, take you out of your conditions that you're in. Amen. Praise God. He never said, you know, like that like he said the Holy Ghost would come upon you. &gt;&gt; And would show you things to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the provocation." My praise God. Let's read the the next quote here. And this is all from adoption. Listen here. He says, "Then did you notice Moses?" Pay attention. That great miracle performer that brought down that brought down Israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land, but did not place their inheritance to them. &gt;&gt; Listen, Brother Brandham, he he brought us right to that very place. Amen. He brought us right to 1963. The mighty angel was right come down. He comes down with an open book. We know who that mighty angel was. It was the Lord Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; But there had to be an earthly angel to introduce him, &gt;&gt; to identify him so that the seals could be opened. Amen. And look now, he goes on. He says, "He did not give them their inheritance. He led them up to the land." But Joshua, &gt;&gt; Joshua, divided &gt;&gt; the land &gt;&gt; to the people. &gt;&gt; This is the ministry that we are under. &gt;&gt; Our Joshua, which is the Holy Spirit, which is the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; which is our Ephesians, is the one that's right now positionally placing every son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into their rightful position in the message of the hour. Amen. Look, he says Joshua divided the land to the people. Is that right? And Christ brought the church up to the place to where their possession was made to them was given to them. Just the Jordan to cross. Oh, hallelujah. We've crossed. There's people that have already crossed. You know, you know the capstone. You know that gap between the seven church ages and the and the and the capstone. Amen. That's our Jordan. Amen. Only the Holy Ghost can take you over that. Not the tapes. &gt;&gt; The tapes ain't going to take you over that. &gt;&gt; It's going to take Christ himself in you. Your your your own revelation of who you are. The word. He says, "And Christ brought the church to the place where their possession was made to them, was given to them just a Jordan to cross, but the Holy Spirit is the one who sets the church in order." The Joshua of today puts the church in its order, giving to each one gifts, &gt;&gt; places, positions, and he is the voice of God speaking to the inner man. He is the voice of God speaking to the inner man. I'm going to say that again. He is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; They want No. The voice of God is only on the tapes. No. No. He &gt;&gt; is the voice of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; To the inner man that Christ has saved. &gt;&gt; That means every son and every daughter of God that's been saved by the Holy Ghost. Amen. The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, how much clearer do you need it? Just a simple quote right from the book of adoption back in 1960. He had the revelation and here now the sons of God that are to manifest that are groaning. Now you understand what it is to be groaning. That the earth is is is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God because there's barely there's barely any that are catching the revelation of what God is doing in this day and in this hour and they're being caught up into into you know spats between and ministers you know uh lashing out at one another and and and different doctrines coming. We're not interested in any of that. &gt;&gt; We're here to preach the word. We're here to give you a clear understanding of the word of God so that you can know who you are &gt;&gt; and understand the day that you're living in and why you identify yourself with this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You know, last week we were we were reading from You can go to the next slide. Just stay on that for a minute. Last week we were reading from Romans chapter 8. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Amen. We're not led by by man. We're led by the Holy Spirit. That's what makes us heir. You've received the spirit of of bond. Listen, you have not received the spirit of bondage. &gt;&gt; Okay? You're not to come under any kind of bondage. Not any where where man's teachings start to override the teaching of the Holy Ghost. We're not bringing anything here that's not in the word of God and not what the pro and what the prophet didn't say. The prophet said it. We line it up with the word of God. The word, the prophet. You hear it, you understand it, you believe it. That settles it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's It's got to make sense. So, we're not under we're not under bondage of fear. Amen. We've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Father, we have a relationship with the father." Our relationship is not with any organization, not with any message, you know, camp or teaching or anything else. We are not a message camp. We are the mystical body of Jesus Christ. That's what we identify with. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And there are men in the land that are recognizing that the Holy Ghost is is is now moving forward, progressing, has turned another dispensational corner to where they've they've come to recognize that, hey, there's a message that you have, which is Christ in you, your hope of glory, &gt;&gt; and this is what we're preaching. Amen. Glory to God. And so we're not under any of that kind of uh anointing or or or or meshes camp anointing or or you know tape, you know, only listening to the tapes and this and that. We listen to the tapes and we listen to the Holy Ghost. Amen. That's that everything has to line up together. Amen. Praise God. I can only say it the way I see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Trust you're seeing what I'm trying to express here. Amen. Glory to God. Now, when you look at this scripture that we just all read here on the provocation and everything, there's a scripture from Psalms 95. And if you go and read Psalms 95, it was basically what Paul was was, you know, um identifying when he was talking to the Hebrews where he was talking about how, you know, um in Psalms 95 it says, "Oh, come uh let us sing unto the Lord. Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. and let us come before his presence. Amen. With thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms for the Lord is great. Now he goes on here. He starts to go on. He starts talking about exactly what what took place back in the wilderness. And he says, "And great and and uh for the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods. In his hand are the deep places." Amen. are the deep places. And he goes on here uh the strength of the hills is his also. The sea is his and he made it and his hands form the dry land. Amen. Oh come let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before the Lord our maker for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. Today if ye will hear his voice. This this scripture pertains to this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have to see the compound revelation. Amen. Glory to God. Harden not your heart as in the provocation as in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work 40 years along. He says, "I was grieved with this generation and said, it is a people that do ear their heart that do ear in their heart and they have not known my ways." He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He does not change. Unto whom I swear in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest. Saints, &gt;&gt; this rest that we have &gt;&gt; under having this revelation of who we are, it gives us a rest that's beyond human understanding. &gt;&gt; It it it it it just separates us from all of the noise, &gt;&gt; all of the confusion. &gt;&gt; You you don't have to you don't have to worry about uh you know, when when you hear certain people trying to pull you certain ways and draw you certain ways. You've heard his voice. You've recognized his voice. Amen. Praise God. And in Hebrews chapter 3, here Paul is using the reference to Israel's wandering in the desert from the story of Exodus. And here in this incident, the nation of Israel came to the border of the promised land. There's a lot of people. They've come right to the very border of the revelation of the opening of the seven seals. Amen. They've come right to that place where they they'll tell you, "Oh, God opened up the seals and all the mysteries have been revealed." And they don't actually have a revelation on the mysteries. Because first of all, it's the it's it's not the mysteries that that that that give us rapturing faith. There's a lot of people that know about what took place through the seven church ages. All of those things was that that's all history. That's all history. That's, you know, like we know that there's going to be a great tribulation. We know that the sixth seal still has certain aspects to unveil. But we've already been taught, we've been given the teaching and the understanding of the great deception that started right from the right right from the first church age, Paul being the first church age messenger, all the way to where we are today. That's not going to give you rapturing faith to know those things. That's history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's rapturing faith that can only come by if the same spirit &gt;&gt; that raised Christ from the dead, &gt;&gt; the resurrection power, if that same spirit dwell in you, it will quicken. &gt;&gt; It will produce a rapture. It will take you from this dimension into that other dimension. This is what we're interested in. &gt;&gt; This is what we're feeding on. So here the the many have been brought right up to the promised land and then lost confidence in God. A lot of people are losing confidence. &gt;&gt; You'll hear people where is the coming of the Lord? My God, this is going on here. This is happening around my life. This is falling apart. I thought God was supposed to, you know, do this and do that and look at my children and look at this situation here and look at my finance. You start to get discouraged because you're starting to look at the circumstances instead of looking at the promise. &gt;&gt; It's said in the scriptures that we read that the trying of your faith, it's it's going to it's going to reveal something in you. It's going to be so much more glorious. what's going to be revealed through the the through the trying, through the testing, through all the things that you have to go through. But many have come right up to that place. Rather than trusting God, most of the people are given up hope. And as a result, only a tiny remnant of the nation was allowed to actually enter into Canaan. Amen. And this chapter from the book of Hebrews explains, now this is important, that Jesus Christ is superior to Moses. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is superior to Moses and all of Moses's accomplishments. &gt;&gt; Christians therefore need to encourage each other to fully trust in the word. Amen. In order to see the fulfillment of his promise in you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know, listen, we need to recognize that Jesus Christ is the voice. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Glory to God. Let's go to the next scripture here in Matthew chapter 17. Do you know that Jesus had an adoption process? Amen. And that we're we're the ones that are in Christ that we identify with his house. Well, let's read the scripture. And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart, and was tr transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun, and his reignment was white as the light. And behold, there appeared unto them the Old Testament and the New Testament, Moses and Elijah, talking with him. Then Peter answered, then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Oh, they want to they want to listen. They want to talk about the tent vision. They want to they want to create a tent for William Brham. They want to bring him back again so that he can meet the people in the tent. No, no, no, no. Listen, listen to what what the Holy Ghost said. Listen to what God said. He said, he says, "If thou wilt, let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses and one for Elijah. While he yet spake, &gt;&gt; behold, a bright cloud." Oh, glory to God. I'm glad that cloud showed up in 1963. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God forever more. And and behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice out of the cloud &gt;&gt; which said, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." What did he say? Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the voice that we're listening to. That's the voice that we're feeding on. That's who we that that's what we've come to recognize is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Adoption &gt;&gt; of sons. &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brandham here &gt;&gt; next in the hidden life. He says if you'll notice in a perfect type God did his own son the same way he taken three as a witness where the mouth of two or three witnesses every word to be established. Peter, James, and John, love, faith, and hope. And he taken them up into a mountain apart from the rest of the world. And there, before the official witness, God adopted his own son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is showing exactly what he's going to do in you and me. Amen. Glory to God. God, he was transfigured before the official witnesses. God adopted his own son. He was transfigured before them. And his reignment did shine as the sun. And a voice out of the clouds said, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." Set him upon a mountain. Put the witnesses there to see. Clothe him in a robe as bright as the sun shining in this. Then then even shined like the sun in its strength. Oh, listen. These bodies that God has taken us to, let me tell you. Hallelujah. And God spoke out, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." God adopted his own child into the family. Hear me no longer, but this is my beloved son who takes over from here on. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Still the voice of God. And look, he goes that adoption is near the time in parable of the church. &gt;&gt; It's time for that &gt;&gt; for what? the manifestation and the adoption of the sons and daughters of the living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where now the voice of God has moved from the prophet of Malachi 4:5, Revelations 10:7. It's moved into the the the the church, the bride, this this the ones who God has said, "Now you take the book. &gt;&gt; You take the revelation. You start to speak and prophesy this word. you start to manifest my voice in the last days because there's something in that book of inheritance that needs to be displayed to the people. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But listen, all of this is great. It's all wonderful to hear that. &gt;&gt; But you've got a part &gt;&gt; in it. &gt;&gt; You've got something to do. &gt;&gt; You've got to surrender to it. &gt;&gt; You've got to you got to check your heart. You got to see if you've if if by if by chance your heart's been hardened in some way &gt;&gt; because of of of sin, because of something that you're not willing to surrender. Do you know that if you like, you know, we we were talking about, you know, where where you're part of God's economy, you're part of the body of Christ, and God wants to place you into a certain position, but you you you you got this hardened heart. You've got this condition in you that that that maybe is a a selfish kind of a spirit that you don't want to let go and you don't want to let God into every part of your life. You don't want to let God deal with those things, get those things out of your life. But this bride, this this this uh uh church, these individuals that were attributes of God that God sent forth from before the foundations of the world, they're different from the from other people in the world. They feel the conviction of the Holy Ghost. They know when they're doing wrong. They recognize that it's wrong. And they want to change. They don't want to stay in that condition. They want to let go of those things. They want to be right with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You've got to surrender your will. &gt;&gt; You've got to surrender your hardness of heart and your your own interpretation on the word of God and let the Holy Spirit, let his will become your will. &gt;&gt; This is the only hour where the fullness of the word &gt;&gt; is made available. Amen. &gt;&gt; To the sons and daughters of God. There was never a time. Everything prior to the seven seals was all history. Was all the Holy Ghost operating in each church age. But none of those individuals had achieved actual sons of God status. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. They died and and listen, even the ones before the coming of Christ, &gt;&gt; they never reached sons of God's status &gt;&gt; until they until Christ himself had to come &gt;&gt; go to Calvary so that he could remember when he went to Calvary, he went to hell &gt;&gt; to loose those that were in prison, those that were shackled. They had not come into sun. They they had not because it was not available to them yet. The sixth dimension was not even available yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. God had to resurrect so that he could take them to the sixth dimension so that they could meet with their theophony bodies. &gt;&gt; It's only then that they actually reach their their status of of theophony which is full sunship. &gt;&gt; Amen. But even they are not complete without us. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's something that Listen, why does the scripture say that there's got to be that that there's that they cannot be made perfect without us? &gt;&gt; What is it that that that that we're going to do? What what what part of the word are we that we're going to actually bring this whole thing into the fullness? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what this is where we're going, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see here, &gt;&gt; there's a will. Their will, God's will. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, even Jesus had to overcome his own will when he went to the Garden of &gt;&gt; Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he went there and he said, "Oh God, if there be any way that this cup could be could could be removed, but he said, "But not my will, thy will be done because there's a there's something in you that's purposed in you to fulfill this this manifestation of the sons of God. You you can't you can't avoid it. It's it's who you are. It's it's what's it's what's it's what's bubbling on the inside of you. It's what's giving you faith to overcome every situation that you deal with on a daily basis. &gt;&gt; Now listen here. Here brother Brandham in from the message leadership. Now he's talking about the rich young ruler over here. But here he goes on. You got to go to the next slide. He says here sometime in life like we have to confront the things just like this young man did. &gt;&gt; There's things in our lives saints. &gt;&gt; God wants to set us free. God wants to bring us into our full adoption. Are you interested? &gt;&gt; Then let's let the word do it. Amen. He says because you are a mortal being and you are given you are given the opportunity of choice. &gt;&gt; A lot of people say I'm a son of God. I don't got to do nothing. God is in me. He'll do it all. H that's not character. That's not the right kind of character. No sir. You're given the opportunity of choice. You have a choice. God made it so you can choose. If he put Adam and Eve on free moral agency so they could choose. And then they made the wrong choice. And see, he could do no more to you than he did to them. He's got to put you the same thing so you can choose or reject. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is like we got to come to a place where you know like when a son gets placed into a place of authority, he's given the character and the authority to hire what he hires, fires what he fires. Amen. He signs the checks. He understands what's going on. He does his research. He looks in to the business of God. Amen. And he understands what God requires of him. Brother Brandham himself said, "This bride, she'll come to a place where she will know what to do with the word." &gt;&gt; This is what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Go to the next slide here. In Revelation chapter 4, listen to what brother Brandham says here. He says, "How did it self-will?" Why will you call that self-will, brother brethren? Because it puts a man and a woman back again just like Adam and Eve at the Garden of Eden. Oh, what? The two trees. Self-will. This one is death. This one is life. Self-will. Immoral. Free moral agency. God placed the first man, Adam and Eve, right here on free moral agency. He places you the same place. And the only way that you can get this thing fixed in here in your own self-will, hallelujah, is your own self-will. Your self-will. You have to will to do God's will. &gt;&gt; You got to will to do God's will. &gt;&gt; An announcement goes out. We need volunteers to do a church cleaning. That's God's business. That's God's voice through the offices calling on the sons and daughters of God to override their own will if they've got the ability to do it. You've got the power of choice. You can choose to go or you can choose not to go. You can choose to receive the blessing of being a part of the body or you can choose not to. It's as simple as that. &gt;&gt; You see, these are simple things. But let's let's listen your self-will. You have to you have to will to do God's will. You have to get rid of your own will to let God's will come in. For this is the only channel that leads to the heart. &gt;&gt; God wants to be enthroned in our hearts. Hallelujah. Go to the next slide. Oh, you can join church. You Baptists, you Presbyterians, you message believers, and you Methodist and pilgrim holiness can come to sanctification. But you have to will to do God's will, self-will to let the Holy Spirit come in here to bring forth these signs. Shall follow them that believe in my name. They shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall lay their hands on the sick or take up deadly things and so forth. These signs shall follow them that has let their will become my will &gt;&gt; and the works that I do shall they do also. I hope you don't miss this. &gt;&gt; He says, I hope you don't miss it. There's a will to do God's will. You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; He goes on, amen. Praise God. Go to the next slide. He says here now we're all born a free moral agent to make any decision that we wish to. God justly does that. &gt;&gt; Because he must put every man on the same basis. &gt;&gt; Listen, God don't God doesn't have clones. &gt;&gt; God wouldn't have been fair to just say, "I'm going to save this church and I'm going to I'm going to send this one to hell." That's not God. God so loved the world that he gave his only he gave his only begotten son. He gave himself that whosoever would believe in him &gt;&gt; should not see death but should receive life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He doesn't he doesn't operate that way. But he had to put us on free moral agency on the same basis. And he put the wrong man on he put the first man on the wrong basis that he put on free moral agency. See, we're just exactly tonight like Adam and Eve. There's no difference. Right and wrong sets before either one of us. &gt;&gt; Life and death. We can make a choice. It's up to you to make it. See, that's the way Adam and Eve did. And see, and they made the wrong choice. And now by that put the whole race of human race under death the penalty of death. Amen. Next slide. And then God came came down in the form of a man and took that death and paid the penalty of death that his subjects that desired to be free could go free. Now, if he took us without the same way that he did Adam and Eve, just pulled us through something, said, "I'll save you whether you want saved or not," then he put Adam and Eve on the wrong basis. &gt;&gt; No, sir. You see, but each one of us has to choose this day between death and life. We can do it as I just expressed. If your light will prove, if your life will prove exactly what side you're on, I don't care what side you say you're on. What you do every day proves what you are. You've heard the old saying, your life is so loud, I can't hear your testimony. See, your actions is so loud. &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. God wants, he doesn't want clones. He wants sons. &gt;&gt; He wants adopted sons of God that are going to manifest him. &gt;&gt; They're going to express his word. Amen. They're going to show that he is the living God. Amen. Praise God. Let the musicians come. Hallelujah. Praise God. Next week, we're going to be moving forward here. I'm going to read this one last quote here from brother Brandham. If you go to the next slide, adoption, he says, "In this promised land, everything belongs to us &gt;&gt; as sons of God. Everything belongs to us in the promised land." See, brother Collins, see, everything is promised land. When Israel crossed over this Jordan into the promised land, fought down everything, you got to overcome all these these things that are trying to pull you to the wrong side, trying to pull you left, trying to pull you right, trying to pull you to believe this, try pull you to believe that. He says, "No, you have to fight." And you fought down everything. Now, remember this in this promised land, that don't mean that you are immune from sickness. That don't mean that you're immune from troubles, but it does spell this. Oh, let this sink deep. He says, it says this, it's yours. &gt;&gt; Go rise up and take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're a son of God. God's given you the will, the ability, the free will to take this message, to take this word to to allow the Holy Spirit to place you, position you, use you. Amen. Don't you fear anything once you know you're in the promised land. God's given you everything in that promised land. You just walk with God. You fight. You fight the battles. You overcome what you need to overcome. And if you're doing it with a sincere heart, with a revelation of who you are, don't worry. God's got angels all around you, encamped about you. He's stoning the enemy. He's taking care of those things that you can't deal with. Don't you don't you worry about those things. You do your part. You let his will become your will. Amen. Praise God. So that you can overcome all the things. So, next week, I'm just going to give you a quick little uh uh scripture here on where we're going next week because this was just laying in more of a foundation about us coming into our positions, understanding our will, our our our position, our authority that God has given us as adopted sons and daughters of God. Amen. You need to know who you are. Amen. You need to know what you're what you're what you're to produce in this hour. Amen. And God's given us free moral agency. God's given us his character, his spirit, so that we will reflect him [music] in our lives. Amen. Glory to God. And if you read the next scripture here from Ephesians, go go back this week and read the book of Ephesians. Amen. But here, for this cause, Paul, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles, [music] if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to you [music] word, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, the mystery, as I wrote a for in few words, [music] whereby when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ. This is what we are feeding on. This is this is what we're uh bringing forth here through this whole entire series. [music] Amen. It's going to it's going to culminate whereby when you read and did you hear you s you heard what Paul said there? It comes by revelation. Paul's telling you this was not something that that that I had to you know uh be given you know to study all these manuals and listen to all these tapes and you know no this comes by revelation. And he says here, "Whereby when we read, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ." Amen. which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellows of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ by the gospel, whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working [music] power. working of his power. Next week, we're going to look deeper [music] into the fellowship of the mystery and how it is that [music] when we hear the word, when we read the word, when we listen to a preacher, you know, like brother Mike was saying earlier today, he was saying, I [music] listen to certain preachers, you know, you listen to a Pentecostal preacher, you know, sometimes you come across something and you just [music] you listen to it and nothing there's there's no stir. There's no there's no nothing that identifies. Why? Because the [music] part of the word that you are of the mystery of God, that element of the word that you are, [music] that attribute of God that you are manifesting in these last days is the word. You are the word. You are manifesting [music] what God wanted to bring to this generation in this hour. You're the ones that will fulfill the rapture. You're the ones that are going to fulfill the body change. You're the ones that have identified uh the the the the scriptures that have been fulfilled in your day. They're they're they're preaching on scriptures from a day gone by. They don't understand that that the the that the second coming of the Lord, they're they're still preaching the second coming of Christ. Meanwhile, he's already here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't realize the progression of the word and what God is doing in our day. But unto you, it has been like Jesus said to know the mysteries of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God forever more. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want Listen, I want my will to be completely surrendered to his will so that I can so I can feed on on on the mystery [music] of who I am, the mystery of who he is, the part of the word that I am to fulfill in my day. I want to know my part. I want to fulfill my part. I want to be in in perfect faith. I want to be walking with God. Amen. [music] Praise God. There's only one way that we can do that and that is that you got to sing that song. This is my desire. This is my desire. This is my desire to honor [music] you. [music] All I [music] worship you.

So, we're glad that uh they chose us. I don't know why they skipped the church down the road there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; They can't rate to us. They're paying for it.
