presence father your word said wherever two or three people are gathered together in your name you are there and we believe you are here father we are in your presence father Take This House of Clean the stamen lives Lord my broken English and the words Lord would you come and take it and speak to your children as we walking through this way father we thank you we invite your presence to be among us bless your word in Jesus name we pray amen and amen we're gonna read 21 18 to 22. Matthew Saint Matthew thank you Lord now in the morning as you return onto the city he hanged and when he saw a victory in the way he came to it and find nothing there on but lives only and said unto it let no food grow in grow on tree henceforward forever and presently the fig tree waited away and when the disciples saw it they marveled saying how soon is the Fig Tree wooded away Jesus answered and said unto them very I say unto you if you have faith and that not you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever he asked you shall ask in prayer believing he shall receive may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be said see that Hallelujah this is this was a a marvelous story that we read there the event happened when he was working with his disciples along the road and the Bible said he was hungry to find something to eat by they couldn't find nothing and when that thing happened remember that he was he was working with his disciples that they've been with him for a long time day in Day Out Hallelujah day in Day Out they saw so many things that the Lord Jesus Christ did but they still couldn't and couldn't understand why why that thing happened so fast before that he has 10 5 fishes then bread for the people to eat he walk along the sea he spoke to them so he spoke to the wind the wind stopped for all these things here they couldn't they couldn't understand so my topic today is do you really know him since you believe it's a question do you really know him since you believe we know we've been here for a long time so many years 30 20 40 whereversoever but I believe by this time everybody understand who the Lord Jesus Christ is you know the the Lord Jesus Christ will make a statement right there he said very I say unto you if you have faith and don't that that that is the key faith and that faith is of god that is not of God if you dab God you cannot receive nothing why do people why are the people in the presence of Lord Larry night and day after afternoon morning and everything May distilled lack sometimes wisdom and understanding of the word of God with so many years why we can ask ourselves why the same thing happened to the disciples they saw so many things let's talk about the the disciples that time we can say oh that time they were living off from the presence of God the Holy Ghost was not given yet so they were living for what they see what they saw every day in their lifetime but right now the Holy Ghost is given so there is no excuse so it's very very very very very important you know you cannot get nothing from God for dieting nothing because God he said only believe all things are possible and he may declare if you have faith and you tell this monkey to be moved and you don't doubt it will happen so this word here is the key word faith is the key word brother that is poking that faith is the one that is taking us home so if you know you are lack for some faith please the time is approaching why the people lack of faith because they do not stay in the presence of God lack of prayers lack of fellowship with God hallelujah you need to have fellowship with God you cannot you can you will not you will not know God without talking to him because you can see me here you can see me every day without having fellowship with me you see me brother Desmond you don't know me the only person who knows me well well is Sister Elizabeth Hallelujah she know the food that I like she knows my footsteps the Lord would want you to know his footsteps he loves you so much Hallelujah our God is good thank you this brethren saw so many miracles but they fail to recognize who the Lord is so when that thing happened what happened because why because they were adapting they don't have fully understanding of who he is so they depend upon what it did what he do he does daily Hallelujah but we don't depend upon what he does say that the Holy Ghost is in us already hallelujah thank you Jesus they failed to recognize him thank you Lord that statement that he made was was very very crucial faith and that Hallelujah as human we live in the spiritual relief two things faith and that either you believe God or you don't believe God in your soul what do you have there faith and that that we know that is not of God God is faith Hallelujah thank you Jesus the dance is the enemy either you believe that of faith you know Abraham through faith he begot Isaac the promising he never staggered started with with that he hold on as we always said Abraham he was so old nobody would like him what kind of regular could he imagine somebody who is about maybe 90 years old right now as we always said how can that 90 year old man can have a baby you you think about it even me now 66 or something I don't desire to have a baby I have all already and about 90 years old with a woman maybe 75 years old but he held on Step By Faith Abraham received the promised son Faith he never adapt he believed when he met God know what time he ever adapt the word of God is absolute you take God you live you reject God you die and we thank God the mercy and the grace of God he as far we have found Grace in his sight and we are sitting here glory to God not so many people has that glory to God not so many people has that Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for a righteousness thank you Lord maybe I cannot read this Roman Roman 4 20. Roman 4 20. mm-hmm he is staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief he is Target not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith you know unbelief can cause your big trouble you will never receive your promises Hallelujah but was strong effect giving glory to God and be fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform God has promised us that we are going through rapture so that promise God speak once I always say he can speak and come back and speak another thing he speak once and that's it he promised us already and thank God he has ordained us it's not our own work here ordained us whether you like it or not you ordain you so you have to stay with the word of God the word of God is real it's not just you see everybody come and stand here don't think he just stand here just like that God ordained that person to stand here whether you like it or not I'm I'm standing here whatever comes from my mouth as I pray and God give me the message so I have confidence for what I'm speaking right now because you have to know that every preacher does stand on the pulpit bring forth the word of God he's going to answer one day and that person that preacher have to know that the people that is speaking to is God children you cannot fool around you have to be serious because it's life and death is somebody's life somebody's salvation Hallelujah I tell you I struggle I pray almost one week to bring this message was not easy but I was happy that God put something in my heart to share with my brethren it will encourage us to even one step we are not we are moving forward Hallelujah it's a precept upon precept Hallelujah thank you Lord amen let me tell you I don't think anybody is happier than me I am happy you have you have to know by yourself glory to God there is no place Wherever I Go the people don't talk about why are you smiling you look happy he said wow they open the doors open I can share my testimony can't you see why I'm so happy I accepted the word of God hallelujah thank you Lord the word of God must be happy no man can be happy unless you have God in your life Hallelujah what do you think Paul said grief what is your victory therefore she has think because he cannot hold him glory to God accept right here presence with the Lord why you worry about sickness worry about this and that and that keep moving keep pressing on we are pressing on he's going home time brother Hallelujah every time I come here I want to encourage you I want to encourage you God the world is not easy but don't look at yourself Look Away to Jesus Hallelujah sometime when I think a minister he God can call a minister and he can raise up the church and the last minute something happened I leave the children just like that and leave if Moses could do that where we where would we stand right now a minister when God could no matter what happened he said if you fall seven times you rise up seven times just get on on your knees God doesn't want nobody to fall God wants everybody to press her whether your minister whether your congregation member no matter what it is don't let your trials to a relation and stuff like that to put you down because Satan is already conquered Hallelujah victory has been won we are victorious Glory Hallelujah you don't look what your circumstances looked at the victory that God won on the cross Hallelujah what can hold God remember is a God who created everything and little ants on the floor he know about that you think God doesn't know everything that you go through everything that comes to your mind every day you think we are righteous the Holy Ghost made us gracious not yourself the Holy Ghost In You as bro Simon always says he said the the the dove the oil is inside cleaning outside God is in you so all the trials comes there he pushes everything out it doesn't stay it's like you throw that thing on the bus and go back on the floor it cannot stick on you Hallelujah who have ever get tried that has no end everything that you go through you look at yourself have anything happened to you that is still there all the time it comes and go you never stay so that's why I say you are invisible you are invisible the sins of God are invisible God I is upon you no matter where you go even the person who look you like this is in trouble we are investigation angels Hallelujah thank you Lord you know everybody that you talk to you pray for you put your thumb there you stand your signature we are the real celebrity celebrity of God not out there the Hollywood you are dead already because everything that you do concerning God is written there Hallelujah your signature is there you don't know who you are that's what Brahm said the day that the Christ recognize who they are my brethren we will just pry away I fly away praise God hallelujah Hallelujah why the people can grow in the Press where the people can grow in the presence of God why because the lack of knowledge they don't pray they don't talk to God why don't you talk to him talk to him God wants you to talk to him God wants you to have conversation with him don't get yourself planned up and thinking oh poor me oh poor me oh I have a problem here oh today like this one here when when you wake up and you stretch your leg you get a little much oh I'm going you are not going nowhere pray Hallelujah pray ER you pick up you pick up oh brother let the same prayer for me why are you doing can't you pray Hallelujah pray pray pray pray prayer bring God's blessing Hallelujah he said if you have faith and you pray you can get anything that you want there is nothing that you lack when you sitting here nothing you don't like nothing everything belongs to you Hallelujah glory to God when when when when Judas spent all the money and they're looking for tax what the Lord what the Lord did he said go inside the fish there it's my fish I I I I I I I reserve some money inside it bring it out they went there and it really the money was that it was that so if you don't have money and you stay there thinking thinking let your hand wear because you cannot bypass GoPro he said buy you a sweat you shall eat bread you cannot bypass that you got to work you don't get nothing free you got it once you have to sweat you have to sweat that's where we used to put you come pray for for for a brother or sister to jump a lot of money inside your pocket it cannot work Hallelujah there's a there's some time God can do God can do anything but if you do what you're supposed to do the rest is up to God Hallelujah God won every believer to talk to him he wanted us to be familiar with him so that when we talk to him you have to be in a relationship with God if you build a relationship with God and you speak with somebody all the time let me tell you if 500 people stand here and Brother Sam will speak no I will hear his voice five thousand whatever I'll hear his voice because why I've been with him for a long time and I listened to him you understand I listen to him he is my pastor he feed me every day Hallelujah so if you talk with God you pray with God and when you speak you will hear his boy let me tell you God speaks God talk the Holy Ghost is a being Hallelujah he's even here right now Hallelujah thank you Jesus my brother we are not just sitting on the pill we admit we are here the same God that Abraham talked to him and said I was the back there the same God is here tonight thank you Lord because why what he choosing for Abraham to see him in physical you think every time he comes to Abraham was because sometimes he speak and Abraham hear his voice you don't see him physically all the time but Abraham doesn't see him physically all the time he hear the voice he's the same God now is the bright time the bright time God is here so if you lack wisdom please pray pray and seek his face you will hear his voice he will talk to you Hallelujah God wants to be his friend brother sister he is everything God can speak to I I it's so real that's sometimes when you speak sometimes people may think who are you no it's real we speak what we hear what we witness from God because what God has done for me he does different you may do what's different but nobody can take that thing away from me Hallelujah nobody on this Earth can take that because I I I can't speak what is what I what I see and what I do and what I saw God does with individual and all what I'm telling you God is real don't doubt him do you really believe the god that you worship and God comes to your house your heart and find something to eat you see that tree there when you didn't get nothing to do what is that he crushed the tree the tree dead he is God let God comes to you he save you can he find a favor when he comes to your house can you recognize him can you see him maybe you're on the field maybe you're on the car when you speak can you hear do you recognize his voice it's not just the minister comes here but someone please so many years here we come and go we come and go we cannot come back and sit here the same way that so many years the same way if something like that there's something wrong somewhere something has to build inside here what is inside here the door is shut or is open that door has to be opened by you God cannot open that door unless you open before he can come in you can let this world here bless you and you come here you will listen to the message you go home it's done no feed yourself feed yourself we eat When We Were Young we eat food and we grow but I didn't grow Too Tall because maybe I didn't eat too much when you eat more you grow tall see that young mother you know how much food you can eat whoa Hallelujah thank you Lord God bless you my brother Hallelujah you adapt and you are Furious are blocking your blessings you adopt and unbelief are broken your blessings brethren this brethren I believe somebody was adapting that's why the Lord made that statement if you done that and believe and said this this woman thing to be moved it shall be moved you cannot get nothing done with unbelief or that you cannot get nothing from God you're gonna stand still you're gonna stand still Hallelujah if God uses you so many times somebody come and say testimony testimony if God is so many times and you see God can't you build confidence how evidence I guess you got real confidence in God even if I pray for somebody and it didn't happen it's not my business as president said I've done my part the rest is God Hallelujah I see God in my life so I that's what makes me happy so no matter who you are when I'm with you I will introduce him to you how can you pray for somebody he can't just go and pray for somebody you got to meet that person in the presence of God invite that person in the presence of God to build his faith before you can pray for that person Hallelujah he has to get a grounds what you are talking about my God Is A

he had Abraham and Sarah to look at he had Hannah at the temple in Eli her husband to think of but that callous priest doubted God's word but his brother sakarian said the other day over in the island when I saw my mother-in-law die five days before it happened and my brother-in-law had a hemorrhagen blood out from his mouth just according from his mouth brother Stein Moore said let us go in and pray that this won't happen I said it won't do one bit again God has already said it it's got to happen God when he says anything it's impossible for it not to happen therefore When God says in the books all things are possible for them that belief is about to happen no way to explain it away you can't believe God will perform every promise that he made then when she never waited little Mary didn't now she had to believe something had never happened but look at her little childish heart I'm going to thank her to be just a young woman about 18 20 years old she never taken the seconds off as soon as she's seen and know that was the angel of the Lord that know these things and told her exactly according to the scripture she had been thinking on and told her her name she know that messenger come from God and the scripture that she had been thinking of was confirmed right there to her Mary the Holy Ghost will come upon you as if Almighty shall overshadow thee and that Holy thing that will be born will not be a man but he'll be called the son of God she threw her little hands up the tears running out of those beautiful eyes said this hold the hands made of the Lord bid unto me according to Thy Word she didn't wait till she was positive of this she didn't wait till she felt life or some kind of a sensation to prove that she was to be a mother she just took his word and that was enough amen that's what God wants you to do tonight not wait till you feel better not wait till you can move your hand better and walk a good step not wait till the doctor says you're improving but take off at his word that's the only way to please him take his word that's the way Miracles are performed when God is touched by his word The Impossibles Are Made Real when God is stuck at his words not questioned just keep it from your mind behold the hands made of the Lord while she was so happy about it she just couldn't stand still and nothing had showed up yet but she knew it was going to be called God's heads off if Christ says these signs shall power them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover take him out his word don't doubt anything just for I don't believe him it'll be all right God's promised it God will perform it God watches over his words to keep it and to answer prayer then she started on her way she heard good news of her cousin Elizabeth an old thingy see he just believed his way God promised it he will perform it you don't pray for something God has already said it are you going to pray that it will not stop no God said he said it praise the Lord so this is what I have for you tonight hold on the word of God don't doubt know him more and more you know I came to this country I went to Ghana I never go to Ghana that time I went there my mother has nine nine children and then we never met so like that so I went to Ghana and that day all the nine children we don't know what happened they from here from here all came together

going to happen and I Cry I Cry everybody start crying they thought something was wrong with me but God has spoke to my heart and I know the word does not lie the word is truth and I believe my thoughts because it's happened to me all the time so when that thought comes I just believe it I believe is going to happen and as soon as I left I came here less than one year my big sister just
