[41:55] the word of God
[41:58] um for today and pray that God will
[42:01] bless us uh I'd like to read for a
[42:04] scripture which they can put up behind
[42:07] me while I'm just talking here Romans 8.
[42:12] verses 18 to 23.
[42:17] if you have your Bible you can find it
[42:19] or you can read it right there before
[42:23] you
[42:25] okay Romans 8.
[42:29] or I reckon
[42:31] that the sufferings of this present time
[42:35] are not worthy to be compared with the
[42:39] glory which shall be revealed in US
[42:46] for the earnest expectation of the
[42:50] creature waited for the manifestation of
[42:54] the sons of God
[42:57] for the creature was made subject to
[43:00] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[43:04] him who had subjected the same in Hope
[43:11] because the creature itself also shall
[43:16] be delivered from the bondage of
[43:18] corruption into the Glorious Liberty
[43:22] of the sons of the children of God
[43:27] amen for we know that the whole creation
[43:32] grown it
[43:33] and travail it in pain together until
[43:37] now
[43:39] and not only they
[43:41] but ourselves also
[43:45] which have the first fruits of the
[43:48] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[43:52] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[43:55] wit the Redemption of our body
[44:00] praise the name of the Lord God bless
[44:02] the word my key verse here is verse 19.
[44:09] which
[44:10] um I'd like to read you from the
[44:12] Amplified version
[44:14] for the whole creation
[44:20] which expectantly
[44:24] for the sons of God
[44:27] to be made known
[44:31] waiting for the revealing
[44:34] the disclosing
[44:37] of the sons of God Amen now when it says
[44:41] sons of God you we were reading the
[44:44] scripture It also says children of God
[44:46] when it says sons of God it means
[44:48] children of God okay so there it is uh
[44:53] waiting so my subject or topic for today
[44:56] is not the unveiling of God but the
[44:59] unveiling of the sons of God
[45:02] the unveiling of the sons of God let us
[45:04] pray our gracious Heavenly Father
[45:08] we thank you for Thy Word
[45:11] but Thy word as we know written upon the
[45:14] page Lord can be understood by just the
[45:17] human mind and
[45:19] knowing grammar English and syntax and
[45:24] so on Lord but we thank you for this
[45:26] that we even have that natural knowledge
[45:28] but we're asking Lord that you will come
[45:32] and walk up on the waters once again
[45:35] that the word that we have read we have
[45:38] heard for so long will come to life
[45:41] before us not imaginary life but real
[45:45] life oh God may your presence Circle and
[45:49] swirl and move amongst us made a great
[45:52] Pillar of Fire of the Living God live
[45:55] among his people and shine above us
[45:57] father the pillar of cloud by day and a
[46:01] fire by night your name be glorified
[46:04] here today as we commit ourselves to you
[46:07] in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless
[46:10] you is preceded we welcome you here in
[46:14] the house of the Lord and most of all
[46:16] into the presence of almighty God
[46:20] see what I want to talk about and what I
[46:24] want to show you
[46:26] is how
[46:28] uh that the whole creation all creation
[46:32] especially at this particular time
[46:36] amen
[46:38] is in a condition of birth pains
[46:43] for the whole creation groans
[46:46] and it's in the birth pains to for a
[46:49] delivery it has to deliver something uh
[46:54] it has the whole world is now in that
[46:57] pain and it's in that chaos and that
[47:00] pain and chaotic condition uh because it
[47:04] has to bring forth something
[47:06] and what I'm saying to you is that I
[47:10] believe the times that we are going
[47:12] through and experiencing now is because
[47:15] the entire universe recognizes that this
[47:19] is the hour of the unveiling of the sons
[47:21] of God
[47:24] and
[47:25] the season
[47:27] now according to the scripture that we
[47:30] just read
[47:31] Paul and all those Believers back there
[47:35] he was speaking of this as something
[47:38] coming in the future
[47:41] that this manifestation or unveiling of
[47:45] these children of God was an event in
[47:49] their minds that was yet to come
[47:52] that's what they were looking for but we
[47:56] understand now that uh time has passed
[48:01] church history has moved on we have come
[48:04] through the seven Church ages we have
[48:08] come to the end of the last Church age
[48:11] and now I'm I believe and I'm saying to
[48:15] you we are now in that season when the
[48:19] grain has ripened and the sons of God
[48:22] are coming into a spiritual maturity
[48:25] that's never seen before and it's now
[48:29] being made known and revealed to the
[48:32] world that the world may recognize them
[48:36] not by sayings wonders and miracles
[48:40] not by Town's interpretation of tongues
[48:43] and all those gifts which I've
[48:45] experienced but the point of it is God
[48:48] wants to reveal himself
[48:52] his person
[48:53] his personality and to display his
[48:57] virtues of his life through his sons and
[49:01] daughters Hallelujah that they become
[49:04] many uh trees of life
[49:07] that has the fruits of righteousness and
[49:12] the sweet fruits of his coming Glory
[49:14] moving and shining through them living
[49:18] for him and for him alone they have none
[49:21] other amen I believe a great song what
[49:26] was a song uh some time ago about the
[49:30] Iowa stand for the lamb what was that
[49:33] song I'll just stand for the lamb I'll
[49:36] I'll be faithful to the Lamb on the
[49:39] whole to the lamb amen praise God
[49:41] because he is the one that died for us
[49:44] amen praise God forevermore hallelujah
[49:48] amen but you understand why Paul spoke
[49:53] of it
[49:54] as a future event he was in the first
[49:58] church age
[50:00] we are now in the last uh Church age
[50:05] which spiritually has ended but time is
[50:10] marching on
[50:12] but really we understand where we come
[50:16] from
[50:17] and this was given to us because of the
[50:20] opening of the seals
[50:22] we understand that we come from the womb
[50:26] of God the mind of God
[50:29] where we had the true Immaculate
[50:32] Conception
[50:34] where we were conceived in his mind we
[50:38] are thoughts that were conceived in the
[50:41] mind of God
[50:42] and God after a while knowing that we
[50:46] were there in this mind of course let me
[50:49] slow down a bit here we were him in the
[50:53] mind of God
[50:55] because while you or I are yet thinking
[50:58] nobody knows your thoughts
[51:01] because your thoughts then are in a
[51:04] state of a mystery right your your
[51:07] thoughts are in the state of a mystery
[51:09] so we were in the minds of God
[51:13] and we were hid in this mind and we if
[51:17] we are part of that brain we are the
[51:21] mystery of God that was hid from Satan
[51:24] with which Paul spoke about when he said
[51:27] if the princes of this world knew amen
[51:30] hid for ages and times it was hid from
[51:34] them they could not recognize that we
[51:37] are serving a God that already had a
[51:40] plan
[51:41] I said we serve a God who already had a
[51:44] plan
[51:45] and we were and are a part of his plan
[51:50] do you believe that
[51:52] and so we were here in the mind of God
[51:57] and it was all a mystery because as his
[52:02] thoughts were conceived as or as he
[52:05] conceived his thoughts we see my friends
[52:08] that the time came when those thoughts
[52:13] would have to be manifested
[52:16] or bursted or come to uh visibility
[52:20] recognition uh people will be able to
[52:24] see them know them they may not
[52:27] recognize them at first of who they
[52:29] really are uh but they may not even
[52:32] recognize themselves and who they really
[52:35] are but God promised in the last day
[52:38] that he would let them know by the
[52:43] opening of his word and the people that
[52:46] come to know their God will do exploits
[52:50] because they know their God hallelujah
[52:53] amen and God of course is the word
[52:56] praise the Lord now we know just like in
[53:01] the natural birth and I'm doing a little
[53:03] bit of recapping here but at the same
[53:06] time you must hear the word of God
[53:10] in a natural birth time of conception
[53:14] it's really a time of Mystery
[53:16] because now the child being now
[53:19] conceived is hid and his head where in
[53:24] the mother's womb it's hit there unseen
[53:27] unknown uh people may know something's
[53:30] going on but they don't know what's
[53:33] really happening what kind of child is
[53:35] going to be born what's going to take
[53:37] place that child remains a mystery right
[53:41] there in a head in the mother's womb
[53:44] then comes the time of manifestation or
[53:49] birth
[53:50] when they come to be seen unknown
[53:54] they get to be seen and they come to be
[53:57] known that is the same thing happening
[53:59] with the Sons and Daughters of God in
[54:02] the hour in which we are living right
[54:04] now
[54:06] where God is making his children known
[54:10] to the visible world Amen and let the
[54:15] world know that you are your father's
[54:17] child
[54:18] I said you are your father's child
[54:21] I thank God I am my father's child amen
[54:25] God is my father amen and he has wealth
[54:30] Untold amen praise God and I'm a child
[54:33] of the King and I give him glory and
[54:36] praise and honor for that because that's
[54:38] his word amen praise the Lord amen glory
[54:42] to God now I I touched on this from
[54:45] another perspective
[54:47] um you'll see I'm bringing it three ways
[54:49] one the womb the mind of God hidden the
[54:53] mind of God secondly naturally to
[54:55] illustrate it we were hid in our
[54:58] mother's womb we were hit there we were
[55:00] a mystery until we were born and become
[55:03] visible and known and then God also now
[55:07] wanting to still as we begin to come
[55:11] into manifestation to keep us there he
[55:15] hid us
[55:18] in
[55:19] the
[55:21] Church womb or the womb of the church
[55:24] world
[55:26] okay among the masses of church members
[55:30] masses and masses of church members
[55:34] millions of people claiming to be
[55:38] Christians God hid his elected ones
[55:42] in the midst of that mass he's just hit
[55:46] them in there you've heard the terms the
[55:48] Baptists have used it one in a million
[55:51] million more in 44 or 84 and stuff like
[55:56] that but you see it's really that was
[55:59] really foretelling and predicting how
[56:02] God many are going to be called to come
[56:05] into Christianity but few are chosen
[56:08] right and many comes into the net which
[56:11] Jesus spoke about them A wise man throws
[56:14] his net in the sea and he gathers in and
[56:16] then when he gathers in then he turns
[56:19] around and he throws away the frogs gets
[56:22] rid of the snakes gets rid of the crabs
[56:25] and all those things and what does he do
[56:28] then he takes the rainbow trout he takes
[56:31] that the salmon he takes that in Praise
[56:34] the Lord that's what God has done and
[56:37] what God is doing right now
[56:39] now some of you sitting right here
[56:41] before me just so I'm just pausing for a
[56:44] while
[56:46] you may have recognized even when you
[56:49] were young you did not have an
[56:53] explanation you don't know why you were
[56:55] different
[56:57] sometimes you're by yourself I don't
[56:59] know about you but I can tell you about
[57:00] myself
[57:02] I always knew I I put it this way I used
[57:06] to put it this way in my own way what's
[57:08] wrong with me why can't I be like these
[57:11] other guys but why can't I just be as as
[57:15] they say normal like these people and
[57:19] just do anything I want and whatever
[57:21] there was something holding me
[57:24] and if you are that kind of a person
[57:26] there was something holding you in the
[57:29] middle of all that you might have uh
[57:32] experience all that might have
[57:35] transpired in your life there was a hand
[57:38] guiding you there was a hand
[57:41] guiding you all the way in an eye that
[57:44] was watching over you every step of the
[57:46] way amen because you being one of his
[57:50] own God had his guiding hand his
[57:54] protective care and his love to surround
[57:58] you at all times no matter what you have
[58:00] gone through he brought you through to
[58:03] this day and to this hour
[58:06] thanks be to God
[58:08] amen thank God he had a plan
[58:12] and God has a plan and which we call the
[58:15] Plan of Redemption
[58:16] right the Plan of Redemption now this
[58:19] God's Plan of Redemption as you know uh
[58:24] or should know it was hidden in the
[58:27] seven dispensations of time
[58:30] according to theologians and men that
[58:34] know the Bible that time was broken up
[58:37] into seven dispensations starting with
[58:40] the dispensation of Innocence we don't
[58:43] want to talk about before that right but
[58:46] now the dispensation of innocence and
[58:49] that's the time of Adam and Eve when
[58:51] they live in absolute innocence
[58:53] they're not aware of nothing else but
[58:55] being just innocent child until sin came
[58:59] into the world to make them
[59:00] self-conscious and aware okay so sin now
[59:05] from the ad from the time of Adam to the
[59:09] millennial Kingdom of Jesus Christ is
[59:13] seven dispensations of time right now I
[59:16] won't go over them now but you can find
[59:19] that and you can understand what they
[59:22] are now so we find out now that's what
[59:26] God hid in these seven dispensations and
[59:31] there was a dispensation which we are in
[59:35] called the dispensation of Grace
[59:38] and it's here because the Jews knew
[59:41] nothing about the dispensation of Grace
[59:44] all they knew about the Skilling Rams
[59:46] and lambs and doves and and uh and uh
[59:49] making their sacrifices but they did not
[59:53] know that there was a time coming where
[59:56] the Gentiles would be actually brought
[59:59] into the kingdom of God and that there
[1:00:02] will be absolute and total freedom no
[1:00:07] more law but now Grace
[1:00:10] no more bondage but Liberty amen you are
[1:00:15] brought in by the grace of God by the
[1:00:17] power of almighty God and the Holy
[1:00:20] Spirit of the Living God moving within
[1:00:22] our hearts and lives amen so they did
[1:00:25] not recognize it you can read that in
[1:00:27] the Epistles where Paul said well they
[1:00:29] were blinded for our sake amen and he
[1:00:33] uses various analogies and so on about
[1:00:35] us being grafted in and so on yes but
[1:00:39] they were not allowed to see it because
[1:00:42] God had a plan and he wanted no one to
[1:00:45] know his plan
[1:00:47] until he was ready to reveal it or to
[1:00:51] make it known so it was hid from them
[1:00:55] and they were not aware of it and so
[1:00:58] those are precious Jewish brothers
[1:01:01] because we know that their blindness is
[1:01:04] only for a Time
[1:01:06] it's only for a season as Paul said they
[1:01:09] were blinded for our sakes right and
[1:01:12] that's only for a certain period of time
[1:01:14] we know out of them will come to 144 000
[1:01:17] we know and so on Amen but the point of
[1:01:21] it is right now the the law of Moses the
[1:01:26] traditions of the elders the talmuds and
[1:01:29] so on
[1:01:30] that stands as a veil that hides the
[1:01:34] fullness of the word for away from their
[1:01:38] eyes and they can't fully recognize it
[1:01:42] it's not that they're not smart people
[1:01:44] you know they are some of the smartest
[1:01:46] people intellectually and so on you know
[1:01:49] that so it's not an intellectuals but
[1:01:52] the fact is it doesn't matter how
[1:01:54] intellectual you are if God wants to
[1:01:56] hide something from you you can't know
[1:01:58] it it's hidden and as simple as that
[1:02:01] right so there it is so God hid it from
[1:02:05] them but that time is coming when the
[1:02:08] dispensation the gentle dispensations
[1:02:11] will come to an end and the Jewish
[1:02:15] people will have to come into power
[1:02:19] they will come into recognition and
[1:02:21] power Hallelujah because the sun rose in
[1:02:26] the East set in the west and it's going
[1:02:29] back East again amen and saw the light
[1:02:33] of God will rise and shine upon the
[1:02:36] nation of Israel once again praise God
[1:02:39] hallelujah amen and I'm looking forward
[1:02:42] to that though I don't believe I'll be
[1:02:45] here
[1:02:46] amen praise the Lord hallelujah so they
[1:02:49] knew about the law but they had no
[1:02:51] revelation
[1:02:53] about the age of Grace
[1:02:56] and that in that age of Grace there
[1:03:00] would be hidden seven Church ages
[1:03:04] and there was hidden seven Church ages
[1:03:06] during that age of Grace
[1:03:10] and now we find out in this age of Grace
[1:03:13] wonderful Christians marvelous women and
[1:03:16] men of God dedicated people who whose
[1:03:19] their lives used for the glory of God
[1:03:22] Amen all wonderful people and I'll tell
[1:03:26] you because I've met some of them I know
[1:03:28] some of them and marvelous wonderful
[1:03:31] people but uh you see it was not their
[1:03:34] age so God doesn't make things known
[1:03:37] before the time he lets you know when
[1:03:41] it's time for you to know amen so so
[1:03:44] here it is my friends that they were
[1:03:48] wonderful but they knew nothing about
[1:03:50] the Seven Seals they might have read it
[1:03:54] in the Bible they heard about it but
[1:03:55] they don't know what it was
[1:03:57] but God has already promised according
[1:04:00] to Malachi 4 5
[1:04:02] that he would send unto us a prophet in
[1:04:05] this last day
[1:04:07] now they don't want to believe that but
[1:04:09] the fact is every prophet in the Bible
[1:04:12] has been Jewish
[1:04:15] and the Gentiles coming on the scene God
[1:04:18] sent a gentile prophet
[1:04:22] and that Gentile Prophet with a name
[1:04:25] that we know brother William Marion
[1:04:28] Branham
[1:04:30] now just as it was all through the
[1:04:33] centuries but Hebrews 11 will tell you
[1:04:36] all the prophets persecuted maltreated
[1:04:39] called all kinds of names they'll kill
[1:04:42] them they'll bury them centuries later
[1:04:44] they find out they were right and they
[1:04:46] dig them up and try to
[1:04:49] give them a great name but they already
[1:04:52] who they are they don't care about those
[1:04:54] things they just want to do the will of
[1:04:56] God you see when they were standing
[1:04:59] there and and saying oh I see a highway
[1:05:03] I see chariots moving faster than horses
[1:05:06] and they have some big bright eyes
[1:05:09] shining they told them they were mad but
[1:05:13] they were seeing the cars that we have
[1:05:15] today
[1:05:16] and they didn't know how to describe
[1:05:18] that or when another one says and I see
[1:05:21] him bringing Israel Back On Eagle's
[1:05:23] Wings well the biggest bird was an eagle
[1:05:26] and a plane when they see a plane how
[1:05:29] they're going to describe something that
[1:05:30] was never seen so they call it a a great
[1:05:33] big eagle bringing back the people back
[1:05:36] to their land amen they tell them
[1:05:38] they're crazy they're mad you know I
[1:05:41] talk Mandarin names and that's the same
[1:05:43] thing it goes right to this day that we
[1:05:46] are living any yeah that we are living
[1:05:48] in any body that is there uh working
[1:05:52] Between Heaven and Earth working between
[1:05:55] God and man when the Holy Spirit takes a
[1:05:59] man and begins to use him for his glory
[1:06:02] and honor he is looked upon in the same
[1:06:04] way that's why Jesus said if they
[1:06:07] persecuted me they'll persecute you also
[1:06:11] amen why he had his years my friends of
[1:06:14] popularity he had yes of preparation
[1:06:17] here in the wilderness he has his years
[1:06:20] of popularity or the young Rabbi the
[1:06:23] healing the Miracles the signs the
[1:06:26] Wonders and so on but when he begins to
[1:06:29] preach to speak the word by saying I and
[1:06:33] my father are one
[1:06:35] now they don't want to hear that oh
[1:06:38] before Abraham was I am oh no no you
[1:06:42] being a man make yourself God who are
[1:06:44] you and you see it created that
[1:06:47] atmosphere every time it does that if
[1:06:51] you begin to preach to the people in the
[1:06:53] church tell them oh there's a whole lot
[1:06:55] of love in here we have to love one
[1:06:57] another and preach all this chocolaty
[1:07:00] type of substance uh you know and you
[1:07:03] know feed them every day with a slice of
[1:07:05] bread and chicken soup made from the
[1:07:08] shadow of a skinny chicken and they're
[1:07:10] shouting and they're rejoicing they're
[1:07:12] happy to get such a meal and oh man well
[1:07:16] you see but the moment you get down to
[1:07:18] it says no the word says so the word
[1:07:21] says this the word says that and the
[1:07:24] word directs us to live a certain way to
[1:07:27] walk a certain way no they don't want to
[1:07:29] hear that they want their own way they
[1:07:31] want to go what they want to do and then
[1:07:34] then the
[1:07:35] resplendent uh you know Prince of the
[1:07:39] church will tell them oh no don't you
[1:07:41] worry with that
[1:07:43] you know those were the old times these
[1:07:46] new times he forgot that the word God
[1:07:48] does not change we serve a God that
[1:07:51] don't lie a God that don't change amen
[1:07:55] he remains Supreme forevermore one God
[1:07:59] Everlasting Eternal praise God in the
[1:08:02] heavens and the Earth amen yes sir so we
[1:08:06] see the Seven Seals have to be revealed
[1:08:09] in this age and in this time and said
[1:08:12] God sent the prophet and the prophet
[1:08:14] brought the word and the Seven Seals
[1:08:17] have been opened up to us praise God and
[1:08:21] now we know friends that this the mighty
[1:08:26] ones of power of the air I'm talking
[1:08:28] about the devil and his princes in the
[1:08:31] parts of the air they had no idea my
[1:08:34] friends
[1:08:35] that the coming of Christ was hid in the
[1:08:38] last seal
[1:08:40] in the seventh seal if you look at all
[1:08:43] I've been saying here is just seven
[1:08:45] seven seven seven seven seven seven

[1:08:49] Grace seven seven seals comes out of
[1:08:52] that you know an unfolding seven seven
[1:08:55] seven full unfolding from the other one
[1:08:57] and now in this seventh Church age a
[1:09:01] several seal opens up and what is it the
[1:09:05] mystery coming of Christ
[1:09:08] when you promise I'll come as a thief in
[1:09:10] the night not like they're expecting one
[1:09:14] morning they'll wake up because I
[1:09:15] remember when we were young and we heard
[1:09:18] the word and we were so happy there was
[1:09:20] one sister there jumped in the morning
[1:09:22] she was living near the army camp and
[1:09:25] you know they have the they would wake
[1:09:27] up all the soldiers
[1:09:29] he jumped out to bed oh praise God Jesus
[1:09:32] I'm coming
[1:09:33] her mother says go back to bed Phyllis
[1:09:37] that's the that's the army camp
[1:09:40] and that wasn't Gabriel blowing any
[1:09:43] trumpet
[1:09:46] see that's how they imagine it's going
[1:09:48] to be
[1:09:49] they don't realize that that trumpet
[1:09:51] voice that Trumpet of the word of God is
[1:09:55] blasting forth now
[1:09:57] they don't understand that the
[1:09:59] revelation of the word is going forth
[1:10:02] now
[1:10:03] they're looking for their human
[1:10:05] expectation for something for their ears
[1:10:08] their eyes and their feelings to to
[1:10:10] register that is happening but it's
[1:10:13] happening in God's Own mysterious way
[1:10:16] amen hallelujah and it's going forth
[1:10:19] upon the people now praise the Lord so
[1:10:23] we thank him and praise him for the
[1:10:26] understanding praise the Lord so he
[1:10:28] promised he would come as a thief in the
[1:10:30] night how many knows that
[1:10:32] Amen on it this night
[1:10:35] spiritual it is night
[1:10:37] and we don't want to go to all these
[1:10:39] scriptures Palestine shall come things
[1:10:41] will wax worse and worse there'll be
[1:10:43] Wars rumors of wars earthquakes or it's
[1:10:46] all there in the Bible you must read
[1:10:48] your Bible you know that every Christian
[1:10:50] ought to read their Bible and pray every
[1:10:52] day
[1:10:53] is that right
[1:10:55] if you're not reading your Bible you're
[1:10:56] not praying every day then uh and you're
[1:10:59] suffering from spiritual malnutrition
[1:11:01] and all kinds of uh spiritual birth
[1:11:04] defects come start coming up in your
[1:11:07] life then you've got to realize you're
[1:11:09] not feasting on the word you're not
[1:11:12] listening to the word you're not reading
[1:11:15] the word you're not praying you're not
[1:11:17] talking to God hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:11:20] Lord of God so he has come now and in
[1:11:24] the middle of this little decent night
[1:11:26] that we are in
[1:11:28] and it's so dark we are almost in a
[1:11:31] state of spiritual blackout not almost
[1:11:34] we are in spiritual blackout as as we
[1:11:38] were as it was back in Egypt's land when
[1:11:42] it the darkness was so sick that you
[1:11:45] could literally almost feel it and it's
[1:11:48] like that right now you see the mental
[1:11:51] problems everywhere that Prophet already
[1:11:55] spoke it shall come to pass long after
[1:11:58] I'm Gone the whole entire world will go
[1:12:02] insane except those members of the Bride
[1:12:05] that will hold God's unchanging hand
[1:12:08] hold to the word of God that keeps your
[1:12:11] mind stable amen because you're Anchored
[1:12:14] In Jesus amen you'll go over every storm
[1:12:18] in every wave amen praise God
[1:12:20] forevermore hallelujah amen yes sir now
[1:12:25] we know of course that this coming of
[1:12:28] Jesus is asleep in the night was spoken
[1:12:30] of already by Paul but they don't
[1:12:34] understand many still don't understand
[1:12:36] but Paul already told us the Rapture
[1:12:39] mystery and the three stages of it how
[1:12:41] that Jesus will start coming with a
[1:12:43] shout
[1:12:44] a voice a trumpet right we understand my
[1:12:49] friends that the message going forward
[1:12:51] the word going forward we understand
[1:12:54] very much that went from Britain to
[1:12:57] spoken word you're the voice sending for
[1:13:00] the word of God hallelujah but thank God
[1:13:03] they understand that he was just the
[1:13:05] voice of the sign
[1:13:07] he was just the voice of the sign they
[1:13:10] needed to go where that sign was
[1:13:13] pointing amen and then they will find
[1:13:16] the Lord Jesus amen praise God forever
[1:13:19] not more Hallelujah now we who are True
[1:13:23] Believers we see him clearly as the
[1:13:27] revealed word for the hour
[1:13:30] is that right
[1:13:32] you know
[1:13:33] um I was speaking to somebody yesterday
[1:13:37] and explain to them letting them know
[1:13:39] that just reading the Bible is wonderful
[1:13:42] doing all the Bible studies of marvelous
[1:13:45] but that is just enough for you to be
[1:13:49] able to analyze for you to be able to do
[1:13:52] your scholarly work and stuff like that
[1:13:55] and uh it doesn't go where God wants you
[1:13:58] to be that's another dimension what all
[1:14:02] together praise the Lord whatsoever I
[1:14:05] told him about this great lawyer that
[1:14:08] who has now gone on he never lost the
[1:14:10] case in uh in his lifetime not one he
[1:14:14] never lost it and um how that this man
[1:14:18] murdered his wife
[1:14:20] and they heard the screaming they heard
[1:14:22] the shouting and everything else and uh
[1:14:25] he came out of the door with the blood
[1:14:28] all on his clothing and and and then he
[1:14:31] says that uh get away from my yard is a
[1:14:35] me feed them me me me claudum me kill
[1:14:39] them
[1:14:40] in other words
[1:14:42] I fed her I clothed her and I have a
[1:14:45] right to kill her
[1:14:47] that's how he was saying
[1:14:49] it went to court
[1:14:51] the case went on for a whole week
[1:14:53] and every time they would ask this
[1:14:55] lawyer would you like to cross the
[1:14:58] question this person that's testifying
[1:15:01] he said no no no he did not say a word
[1:15:06] for a week and there were
[1:15:09] lots of people that were there as
[1:15:11] Witnesses
[1:15:13] and then the judge says but what's the
[1:15:16] Lionel you need to you need to say
[1:15:18] something how are you going to defend
[1:15:20] your your your client against these
[1:15:23] charges right here listen to these
[1:15:26] charges there are people are gonna think
[1:15:28] that he did it he said well uh I can't
[1:15:32] say he did it but what they're saying he
[1:15:35] did say it he he did say those words I
[1:15:40] fed her I clothed her and I killed her
[1:15:43] but he says your honor I listened all
[1:15:47] week
[1:15:48] foreign
[1:15:50] none of them
[1:15:52] were able
[1:15:54] to convey to us
[1:15:57] the truth of what he really said
[1:16:00] what did you really say
[1:16:03] now
[1:16:04] did my client said I fed her and I
[1:16:08] killed her he says no I'm putting it to
[1:16:11] you today what my client really said was
[1:16:15] I fed her
[1:16:17] include her all her life
[1:16:20] I kill her
[1:16:24] kill her you see it's the same words
[1:16:28] but behind those words are certain
[1:16:31] nuances
[1:16:32] unspoken Unwritten things that are
[1:16:36] coming forth out of that
[1:16:38] is that right we know that's what
[1:16:40] lawyers deal with that realm they're
[1:16:42] just on the edge of it but but we
[1:16:45] understand that that is what he did and
[1:16:48] that's what I'm trying to tell you God
[1:16:51] speaking and dealing with his people is
[1:16:54] not just by the written word
[1:16:56] that serves its purpose but he uses the
[1:17:00] written word to bring you further as you
[1:17:03] get to know him into himself
[1:17:06] where he can have fellowship with you
[1:17:08] and talk with you heart to heart is that
[1:17:12] right talk with you heart to heart
[1:17:14] praise the name of the Lord amen glory
[1:17:17] to God let me go Advance with this amen
[1:17:21] praise the Lord hallelujah so now we
[1:17:24] know that in the last days that we are
[1:17:26] in that the Lord has come he has
[1:17:30] descended from the shout The Voice he's
[1:17:33] here Among Us do you believe that
[1:17:36] in the Simplicity of this moment that he
[1:17:39] is here Among Us not visible but when
[1:17:42] he's ready he will make himself visible
[1:17:45] and take us out of here who are True
[1:17:47] Believers amen now we know that my
[1:17:52] friends that he has making himself known
[1:17:55] to us and he's also making himself known
[1:17:58] through us
[1:18:00] is making the world to come to know him
[1:18:03] through us but The Lies We Live how we
[1:18:07] conduct ourselves we can't help it
[1:18:10] because we are Sons and Daughters of the
[1:18:14] king amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:18:16] hallelujah now this last day Bride As we
[1:18:21] have said before we came out of the uh
[1:18:25] out of the upside the mind the womb
[1:18:29] however you want to describe that of God
[1:18:34] we came from him just like Eve
[1:18:38] was brought from the side of Adam
[1:18:42] by using the figure of Adam God was
[1:18:45] trying to illustrate if we could have
[1:18:47] understood it we would have known that
[1:18:49] that that is what he did
[1:18:53] his wife was a part of him
[1:18:56] and we if you are a true chosen son and
[1:19:00] daughter of God you are actually a part
[1:19:04] of him
[1:19:06] and that means that you can't you didn't
[1:19:10] have salvation on a certain day
[1:19:13] because if you are a part of him and God
[1:19:16] is eternal it means you have to be
[1:19:19] eternal
[1:19:20] and when I say you I'm not talking about
[1:19:22] your flesh which will die and pass and
[1:19:24] become ashes or whatever I'm talking
[1:19:26] about you I've never seen you you have
[1:19:28] never seen me but we live in these
[1:19:30] bodies of time which will soon pass away
[1:19:33] but we understand that we are Eternal as
[1:19:36] God is eternal
[1:19:38] amen and we were hid in him by his
[1:19:43] Spirit praise the Lord and now he has
[1:19:46] come to the place where he is unveiling
[1:19:49] to the world yes his book of the
[1:19:53] redeemed

[1:19:57] redeemed or manifested book of
[1:20:00] redemption being made known to the
[1:20:03] people they're looking for it here and
[1:20:07] it's not here anymore it's walking
[1:20:09] around
[1:20:10] it's walking around amongst the people

[1:22:59] down check it out for yourself I don't
[1:23:02] want to be bogged down by going into all
[1:23:04] of these various quotes and things like
[1:23:06] that you don't mind that okay you just
[1:23:09] go look at it yourself you read it for
[1:23:11] yourself and it's better that way praise
[1:23:14] the lord we understand brother Brandon
[1:23:17] is speaking about the bride
[1:23:19] and when a bright in the Middle East or
[1:23:21] the Eastern peoples whether it's India
[1:23:23] China or or uh wherever in there when
[1:23:27] they get married they come and they're
[1:23:30] wearing a veil
[1:23:32] before their face
[1:23:34] they have a veil on
[1:23:36] right
[1:23:38] and the bright room has to come or she
[1:23:42] will take the veil away
[1:23:45] but before that time she has to wear
[1:23:47] that Veil
[1:23:49] and I'm trying to tell you this is the
[1:23:51] hour and this is the time when God Is
[1:23:54] Lifting the veil off of his sons and his
[1:23:57] daughters in this nearness hour Amen in
[1:24:00] the same in that way in a larger sense
[1:24:03] he is unveiling himself it's the
[1:24:06] unveiling of God going on whether in
[1:24:08] word form Spirit form or in Bride form
[1:24:12] it's the unveiling of God that's now
[1:24:14] taking place in a mighty way amen praise
[1:24:18] God the prophet said and then Jehovah
[1:24:21] will take the veil off of God
[1:24:24] amen but you see we couldn't understand
[1:24:27] back then what he was talking about he's
[1:24:29] talking about the bride taking the veil
[1:24:32] off of his bride for this day and for
[1:24:35] this hour praise the Lord Jesus
[1:24:37] hallelujah amen glory to God look let me
[1:24:41] just jump across some things here and
[1:24:44] and move on
[1:24:47] amen so the veil is being lifted and
[1:24:50] it's being lifted so now the public is
[1:24:53] ready to see her right Prophet said
[1:24:56] she'll be put on public show for for a
[1:24:59] short while and then the Rapture will
[1:25:01] just take place but the world is shall
[1:25:04] be put on public show for that right
[1:25:06] back then we used to think that it will
[1:25:09] be just in the ministries of power and
[1:25:11] and speaking in tongues and massive
[1:25:13] revivals and then he turns around and
[1:25:16] says no no no no he says to brother
[1:25:18] Madison Bose up there in Chicago he says
[1:25:22] that he says you're thinking wrong
[1:25:24] you're thinking that because we didn't
[1:25:27] have thousands come out of the meeting
[1:25:30] that no that that wasn't a Revival he
[1:25:32] says no a Revival
[1:25:35] it's just the calling out of the elect
[1:25:38] in that area whether there be five or
[1:25:40] five thousand right that is the Revival
[1:25:44] amen it's going into a tongue which he
[1:25:47] was led sometimes just to preach the
[1:25:49] word to 20 people in a little school
[1:25:52] room and nobody knew anything about it
[1:25:54] so that one could hear the word and
[1:25:57] recognize what was going on that's the
[1:26:00] real Revival and I believe it's still
[1:26:01] going on right now by the grace of God

[1:26:41] find friends
[1:26:43] now he's bringing her into a plain view
[1:26:47] you know Songs of Solomon said
[1:26:50] I believe it's uh chapter 2
[1:26:53] verse 16. I am my beloved and my beloved
[1:26:58] is mine how many ever heard that I am my
[1:27:01] beloved and my beloved is mine we are
[1:27:05] the Lord's own thanks be to God I said
[1:27:08] we are the Lord's own we belong to him
[1:27:11] and he belongs to us now I'll just talk
[1:27:14] with you here you know that the children
[1:27:17] of Kings Queens put them dates and very
[1:27:22] wealthy people they just can't
[1:27:25] go wrong like ordinary children
[1:27:28] they they got to be hid
[1:27:31] usually they are hit their parents try
[1:27:33] to hide them
[1:27:35] you are here right now you're sitting in
[1:27:38] here let's not to say that you're going
[1:27:40] to go and buy a lottery ticket
[1:27:44] but let's just say a friend who bought a
[1:27:47] lottery ticket for you
[1:27:50] laughs
[1:27:53] and it just so happens that that lottery
[1:27:58] ticket wins right it sounds like a
[1:28:03] certain preacher who was thoroughly
[1:28:05] preaching against that and Blasting and
[1:28:08] shopping and everything else and his
[1:28:11] wife behind his back went and bought a
[1:28:13] ticket and she won
[1:28:16] and it was many many many millions when
[1:28:19] they asked him about his wifey I have
[1:28:21] nothing to do with that the Lord has
[1:28:24] blessed her in that way and if it's
[1:28:26] going to bless me too I know what can I
[1:28:29] do
[1:28:30] well
[1:28:32] see that's that's life that's just human
[1:28:35] life but let's come back to where we are
[1:28:38] here the children of wealthy people have
[1:28:41] to be protected
[1:28:43] where you are right now you
[1:28:46] you're just a regular person and you're
[1:28:48] still your child has to be protected
[1:28:50] but you know the moment you have a lot
[1:28:53] of money
[1:28:55] the protection guns will not give us the
[1:28:57] next level
[1:28:58] they really have to be protected
[1:29:01] and
[1:29:03] um up to the grandkids and the little
[1:29:06] they have to be protected in every way
[1:29:09] possible because they're in danger of
[1:29:12] being kidnapped
[1:29:14] right and look the devil hasn't gone
[1:29:16] anywhere he's looking to kidnap you
[1:29:19] if you don't behave yourself and be the
[1:29:23] way you're supposed to be the devil will
[1:29:25] kidnap you you're kidnapped or you're
[1:29:28] killed are you in prison he'll do
[1:29:31] anything like that and the devil is such
[1:29:33] a one and take me seriously we have got
[1:29:37] to realize we are the sons and daughters
[1:29:40] of God
[1:29:41] and the devil is out there trying to
[1:29:44] kidnap you amen so God had to hide us in
[1:29:48] a mystery uh until our time of maturity
[1:29:52] or until this time of the church world
[1:29:56] the church the elect come into her
[1:29:59] maturity and understanding of him his
[1:30:02] word of who he is amen praise God so
[1:30:06] these many wealthy people their children
[1:30:10] comes from foreign lands to United
[1:30:13] States to Canada and they go into
[1:30:16] various uh universities or schools and
[1:30:21] they move around like they're ordinary
[1:30:24] and they're knocked
[1:30:26] I've seen them come from Nigeria I've
[1:30:29] seen them come from China seen them come
[1:30:31] from other lands and uh friends of my my
[1:30:36] daughter and come to find out
[1:30:40] when the season is over this one's
[1:30:42] father comes with a plane and picks her
[1:30:44] up at this Jet and gone to France or
[1:30:46] gone wherever and the next one
[1:30:49] and it's like that but when they are
[1:30:52] here they just move around playing an
[1:30:54] ordinary
[1:30:55] and that's what you're doing right now
[1:30:58] you realize that
[1:31:00] your father is the king of the universe
[1:31:03] and you're walking around like an
[1:31:05] ordinary person and I don't even just a
[1:31:08] regular right and you just move around
[1:31:10] like that because the devil is looking
[1:31:13] to kidnap you or he's looking to
[1:31:15] imprison you or even to kill you if he
[1:31:18] can in every possible way but these
[1:31:22] people come from across the seas and
[1:31:24] they come to a foreign land and hide
[1:31:26] themselves I thank God that God allowed
[1:31:30] us to come from Heaven to Earth and to
[1:31:33] be here in this earth filled with sin
[1:31:36] filled with deception filled with evil
[1:31:39] amen but we don't worry because of the
[1:31:42] end of the season praise the Lord
[1:31:44] there's a land beyond the river that we
[1:31:49] call a sweet forever
[1:31:52] and we'll only reach that Shore by
[1:31:56] Faith's degree
[1:31:58] one by one will gain the portals dare to
[1:32:04] dwell with the Immortals when their rank

[1:37:49] knows who the Blue Jays are
[1:37:52] oh my this guy's preaching and he's gone
[1:37:54] now to baseball but that's the holy
[1:37:58] spirit amen but here it is that they had
[1:38:01] a fellow from the
[1:38:03] um Philadelphia that was a wonderful
[1:38:06] picture my goodness when you see he
[1:38:09] reared back and he comes with one of
[1:38:11] those balls over 90 something miles an
[1:38:14] hour
[1:38:15] just blowing those guys out of there and
[1:38:18] but then they were down to the last
[1:38:21] inning it was a 19 I think it's the
[1:38:24] ninth inning and just the last inning
[1:38:26] and the last person to bat
[1:38:30] and there were even oh my but there this
[1:38:34] guy's name was what JC

[1:39:06] and he cracked it right out to the top
[1:39:10] of the stadium amen and the place went
[1:39:14] wild oh lord of God I think that
[1:39:17] sometimes we are to go wild over this
[1:39:19] word of God I I believe sometimes we
[1:39:22] have to go wild over this promise word
[1:39:24] of God for the hour Hallelujah because
[1:39:26] Jesus knocks him out to the ballpark
[1:39:30] and I believe right now that's what the
[1:39:32] word of God is doing with the devil
[1:39:34] knocking him out to the ballpark any one
[1:39:37] of these brothers will knock the devil
[1:39:39] out of the ballpark the Holy Spirit
[1:39:41] anointed their lies will knock him out
[1:39:44] of the ballpark amen amen an individual
[1:39:47] Believers you should start to recognize
[1:39:49] the word enough to kick him out your
[1:39:51] house

[1:39:54] house amen turn him into your football
[1:39:57] amen glory to God Amen yes sir that's
[1:40:01] what you got to do praise the Lord so

[1:40:06] Trails the display of the Bride the
[1:40:09] display of the unveiling of these sons
[1:40:11] of the Living God coming to what we come
[1:40:15] into our adoption time go read the
[1:40:18] adoption book coming into our adoption
[1:40:21] time but you see a lot of them uh
[1:40:24] believe the adoption time was a time
[1:40:27] when you were an adopted son now you
[1:40:29] come into power and you come into power
[1:40:32] you come into this you come into that
[1:40:34] you don't understand that's part of it
[1:40:36] Paul already told us what the adoption
[1:40:40] time is
[1:40:42] you can read it in your own Bible if I
[1:40:45] have the scripture here he says Romans 8
[1:40:48] 23 could you put that up
[1:40:53] Romans 8 23.
[1:40:59] Hallelujah
[1:41:04] but not only they
[1:41:07] but ourselves also which have the first
[1:41:11] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[1:41:14] groan within ourselves waiting for
[1:41:20] which is what
[1:41:25] is right there in your word
[1:41:27] that is what adoption really is
[1:41:31] but you know through the years in the
[1:41:33] message Brothers preach about the
[1:41:34] adoption and make it so mysterious and
[1:41:37] so my goodness you know like that but
[1:41:40] really this body change
[1:41:44] The Mystery of the body change that you
[1:41:47] can be alive
[1:41:48] and still you're being changed
[1:41:51] and you don't feel anything and you
[1:41:52] don't even know that you're being
[1:41:54] changed except that we have a revelation
[1:41:57] that we are being changed
[1:41:59] and we've been changed and the Bible
[1:42:01] tells us Paul said it you're gonna be
[1:42:03] changed from glory to glory to glory and
[1:42:06] like Alice you walk through and step
[1:42:08] into the Wonderland you step right
[1:42:10] through the Looking Glass world that
[1:42:11] we're living in and you're on the other
[1:42:13] side
[1:42:14] oh praise God aren't you looking for
[1:42:17] that wonderful time
[1:42:19] amen yes sir the Redemption of our
[1:42:22] bodies think about that being Redeemed
[1:42:25] by the grace of God hallelujah so as the
[1:42:28] as our heavenly father has begun
[1:42:33] to acknowledge us uh before the public
[1:42:37] so that all can see and experience his
[1:42:41] Divine and Supernatural approval
[1:42:45] like the prophet said when God sees us
[1:42:48] time he'll take you aside in front of
[1:42:51] the public
[1:42:52] and or approve of you before the people
[1:42:55] so that the people will know
[1:42:57] that you are approved by him not you are
[1:43:00] proving yourself I'm Christian I'm a
[1:43:02] Believer I I alter the word I got the
[1:43:05] message I got that's wonderful that's
[1:43:07] nice but it's God has to come and
[1:43:09] approve you supernaturally when you're
[1:43:12] not even thinking you're not even
[1:43:13] looking for it and then God will come to
[1:43:16] approve you amen
[1:43:18] now let me get into a few things here
[1:43:20] would you give me just a little more
[1:43:22] time it's not one o'clock yet anyway but
[1:43:24] I'd like to get you out earlier than
[1:43:26] that if I can
[1:43:29] do you know
[1:43:31] devils and demons
[1:43:34] are going to start having to testify of
[1:43:38] you
[1:43:39] of Who You Are
[1:43:42] who we are that you are the sons and
[1:43:45] daughters of God
[1:43:47] they'll have to do it
[1:43:49] they have to testify they say how do you
[1:43:51] know that well when Jesus came what
[1:43:54] happened he was just walking down the
[1:43:56] street and all of a sudden Here Comes
[1:43:58] This demons criminal oh we know you who
[1:44:00] you are we we know you who you are
[1:44:03] you're the Holy One Of God
[1:44:05] they'll know you who you are
[1:44:09] remember Paul when Paul was out there
[1:44:12] the Seventh Son of Siva went there and
[1:44:16] what did the demon say Paul we know we
[1:44:19] we know who you are Paul but but these
[1:44:23] guys they have no representation they
[1:44:25] have no seed no election
[1:44:28] oh my goodness ended give me back those
[1:44:31] clothes and others wealth that I give
[1:44:33] you the the the and then now you coming
[1:44:35] against me to cast me out and so the
[1:44:38] devil tore the clothes up and threw them
[1:44:40] out out of there like that amen yes sir
[1:44:44] but the devils
[1:44:46] and you're gonna start experiencing that
[1:44:50] right
[1:44:51] devils are literally
[1:44:53] going to start to obey you and fear you
[1:44:57] and want to get away from your presence
[1:45:00] because of the God who lives in you
[1:45:04] and not only that
[1:45:06] is because what myself and other
[1:45:08] ministers that recognize are doing is
[1:45:11] causing you to recognize yourself
[1:45:14] of Who You Are
[1:45:16] and that you become certain of God
[1:45:20] and know that you must be obeyed and
[1:45:23] that Satan is a defeated foe
[1:45:26] and is under your feet Lord of God
[1:45:29] hallelujah amen yes sir so you see
[1:45:32] because they went to see if you know who
[1:45:36] you are
[1:45:38] once you are not certain of Who You Are
[1:45:42] and you don't know who you are the devil
[1:45:45] will play with your mind
[1:45:46] he'll try to scare you and everything
[1:45:49] else and Bluff you on everything else
[1:45:52] out of your own property he will Bluff
[1:45:54] you uh if you don't know yourself but
[1:45:57] you see you we have come to hear the
[1:45:59] word of God to make you certain of God
[1:46:02] and to recognize who you really are amen
[1:46:07] yes sir and when they can see that you
[1:46:11] have not come to recognize who you are
[1:46:14] and you don't realize the extent of the
[1:46:17] power that that is in you and that can
[1:46:20] flow through you then he's they're not
[1:46:24] going to obey you
[1:46:26] you're not gonna obey your commands
[1:46:28] oh my goodness but when you recognize
[1:46:32] your position and who you are that you
[1:46:36] are a child of the king the Devils will
[1:46:38] scream and come out at your very

[1:47:02] Hallelujah not that I walk around like
[1:47:04] that every day but the times you'll be
[1:47:07] surprised just shake their hand of

[1:47:12] in the societies well God it's nice to
[1:47:14] meet you people up in the air down on
[1:47:17] the ground
[1:47:17] well I can't help that because I don't
[1:47:19] know what flew out of me I just was
[1:47:22] shaking his hand I wasn't thinking God I
[1:47:24] wasn't thinking scripture or anything
[1:47:27] like that just shocked the person's hand
[1:47:28] and and they gone into whatever you call
[1:47:31] it they call it this or that whatever
[1:47:34] but that will happen but you will find
[1:47:36] out that will start to happen you're
[1:47:39] going to see it start happening you hear
[1:47:41] what I'm saying I'm telling you now that
[1:47:44] the true sons and US of God you don't
[1:47:46] have there's nothing you have to do say
[1:47:49] oh I'm going to pray and ask God to give
[1:47:51] me a miracle ministry I I gotta really
[1:47:54] pray up until I'm filled with the power
[1:47:56] of God no just do your normal life the
[1:48:00] prophet said be simple be humble be
[1:48:03] reverent and God will bless you
[1:48:07] that's all God asks you to do and the
[1:48:10] Holy Spirit Will flow through you you'll
[1:48:12] be surprised how the holy spirit will
[1:48:15] use you and they will recognize amen but
[1:48:18] not only these Devils all nature
[1:48:22] will will start recognizing
[1:48:25] that the sons of God have come to
[1:48:27] maturity
[1:48:29] and they are now being unveiled and all
[1:48:32] nature and all the heavens and all the
[1:48:36] worlds that are in the heavens they're
[1:48:38] going to start to recognize who we are
[1:48:41] and come back into harmony
[1:48:43] with us
[1:48:44] according to the scripture I think that
[1:48:48] is in uh Genesis 1
[1:48:52] 26-31 could you put that up praise the
[1:48:55] Lord
[1:48:56] you don't mind my taking my time
[1:49:01] it's all right you can sleep and wake up
[1:49:03] and you hear the rest of it
[1:49:08] like somebody's sitting for an hour
[1:49:12] they're gonna feel a bit you know so
[1:49:15] what can you do about that and I said
[1:49:17] let the Holy Spirit have his way you
[1:49:19] hear what you need to hear
[1:49:21] praise the Lord
[1:49:23] okay let's read it and God said let us
[1:49:26] make man in our image after our likeness
[1:49:29] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:49:32] the sea over the fowl of the air over
[1:49:34] the cattle over all the Earth and over
[1:49:37] every creep every creeping thing that
[1:49:40] creepeth upon the earth now first of all
[1:49:43] image of God we know that that doesn't
[1:49:45] mean this that this is the image of God
[1:49:47] that's what they try to tell you but the
[1:49:49] real image is the image the seed the the
[1:49:53] attribute of God in you right let us
[1:49:56] make man in our own image the spirit man
[1:49:59] right praise the Lord as we preach
[1:50:02] explained before at one time Adam
[1:50:04] couldn't he couldn't kill the soil he
[1:50:06] couldn't do anything but he was yet a
[1:50:08] spirit man until God created a body and
[1:50:10] put him in that body and breathe the
[1:50:12] breath of life then he could go kill the
[1:50:14] soil and do those various things right
[1:50:18] so we see that so but all the all the
[1:50:23] animals all the plants
[1:50:26] are coming back into harmony with the
[1:50:30] True Believer
[1:50:32] brother Branham give us that in a nice
[1:50:35] way he didn't say it like that but
[1:50:38] that's what was happening with him when
[1:50:40] he crossed the field and the bull run
[1:50:42] out to go and Gore him and he just said
[1:50:45] oh I'm sorry I Disturbed you your rest
[1:50:48] under the tree just go back and rest and
[1:50:51] then the bull just went off and went
[1:50:53] back to Wrath
[1:50:54] because the bull realized he recognized
[1:50:57] who he is
[1:50:59] and he has no hatred he has to know
[1:51:02] there's no sin in him that brings
[1:51:05] dangerous feelings in the animal so it
[1:51:07] just went back and rested right he's in
[1:51:11] his house he'd go out the morning and he
[1:51:13] opens the door and there is a possum
[1:51:16] and a possum comes right comes right in
[1:51:19] front of him and looking up and and it
[1:51:22] was wounded and you know the story he
[1:51:25] prayed for the possum what was it this
[1:51:27] is what I'm telling you about I'm
[1:51:29] telling you about it because though it
[1:51:32] was happening or some of it was
[1:51:33] happening with me I only now I'm
[1:51:36] consciously recognizing
[1:51:39] what is going on what is actually
[1:51:42] beginning and as you sons and US of God
[1:51:46] I want you to be made aware so that you
[1:51:49] can be conscious of what is taking place
[1:51:52] around us I'm going to close this I I
[1:51:56] have more that I could say but they are
[1:51:59] willingly bringing themselves
[1:52:02] um back under our Dominion
[1:52:06] to finish that Genesis that we were
[1:52:09] reading it tells you that I give you
[1:52:12] dominion over all pla all the animals
[1:52:15] everything all all of them have to be
[1:52:17] under your Dominion that is what we are
[1:52:20] going right back to that state
[1:52:23] we were in and when they recognize it
[1:52:27] they are bringing themselves back into
[1:52:30] harmony with you
[1:52:32] bringing yourself back to a place where
[1:52:36] they begin to obey the word of God
[1:52:38] within you praise the Lord so don't look
[1:52:42] at the chaos
[1:52:44] don't look at the madness that's taking
[1:52:46] place in the world around you
[1:52:49] you should rejoice
[1:52:51] because that is just letting you know
[1:52:54] that's the labor pains
[1:52:57] Arts labor pains to bring forth
[1:53:01] the sons of God
[1:53:03] the children of God being born and being
[1:53:08] made manifested in this day and in this
[1:53:11] hour
[1:53:12] if you were not fully conscious and
[1:53:14] fully aware of some of what I've said
[1:53:16] here today I pray that God will bring
[1:53:19] into a state of full Consciousness and
[1:53:22] awareness of what he is doing now not
[1:53:26] what he did back in the Bible days we
[1:53:29] read that we get inspiration we have
[1:53:31] faith from that but what God is doing
[1:53:33] right now
[1:53:35] Open Your Eyes Open the Eyes of your
[1:53:37] heart and see what he's doing in this
[1:53:39] hour and it happens so simple the
[1:53:42] problem said it happens so simple so
[1:53:44] humble that if you're not really
[1:53:46] watching you won't even recognize it you
[1:53:49] won't even know what's happening that's
[1:53:51] the way God works right he says the a
[1:53:54] whole lot of noise but he says look they
[1:53:57] got pumps pumping water oh my and they
[1:54:01] boast about it well you know 50 000
[1:54:04] gallons a minute and so on like that he
[1:54:07] says in the Sun comes out
[1:54:10] and in one day all the place dry up they
[1:54:14] don't know where all these millions and
[1:54:16] millions of gallons of water disappear
[1:54:18] to with no noise no sound it's all gone
[1:54:22] up that's what's got how God works and
[1:54:26] that is what is happening right now
[1:54:27] praise the lord we are going through a
[1:54:30] change I'm going through a change you're
[1:54:32] going through a change I don't fully
[1:54:34] recognize it yet but praise God May the
[1:54:37] Holy Spirit bring you into the fullness
[1:54:39] of his divine presence amen praise the
[1:54:42] Lord shall We Stand look to the Lord in
[1:54:44] prayer
[1:55:00] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:55:03] for the word that we spoke here today
[1:55:06] and Lord it this really wants to uh
[1:55:11] Enlighten your people father
[1:55:14] as you it's not a sermon to
[1:55:17] uh heal the sick which though they can
[1:55:21] be healed in the midst of all of this
[1:55:24] it's not one preached and evangelically
[1:55:28] though they can come and surrender
[1:55:31] themselves to you and make their
[1:55:35] confession of Faith trust you and lay
[1:55:39] their lives into your marvelous hand and
[1:55:42] your gracious keeping father but just to
[1:55:46] shine the light upon the word upon the
[1:55:50] moment and the hour of what is happening
[1:55:53] what is taking place
[1:55:55] and father I'm announcing this to them
[1:55:58] so they can now become conscious
[1:56:01] be able to look around them
[1:56:03] and see
[1:56:05] people
[1:56:07] circumstances
[1:56:09] plants animals objects
