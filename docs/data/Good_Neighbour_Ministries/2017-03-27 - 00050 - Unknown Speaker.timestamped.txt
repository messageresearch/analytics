[11:16] [Music]
[11:22] that's brother glory to God now you can
[11:25] put up the background please be
[11:27] seated
[11:33] our scripture is right there before
[11:36] you first Thessalonians oh I
[11:39] didn't anyway then we which are alive
[11:43] First Corinthians we which alive and
[11:46] remain shall be caught up together with
[11:51] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[11:55] the air so shall we ever be with the
[11:58] Lord Lord amen amen we have been
[12:02] speaking on this last week we spoke uh
[12:05] on this topic of the Rapture and uh
[12:09] today uh we will continue and it's
[12:11] possible I may have another week
[12:13] speaking on the Rapture and we found
[12:18] that uh for us to be in the Rapture uh
[12:22] there are some
[12:23] requirements and if I were to ask as you
[12:26] heard the prophet himself
[12:29] are you
[12:32] ready in your heart of hearts do you
[12:35] know that you're
[12:38] ready are you really certain of
[12:42] God are you living as close as you
[12:45] possibly
[12:47] can we're not talking about
[12:50] fanaticism but we're talking about
[12:52] reality amen because as this message of
[12:55] the prophet of Malachi 4 seems to be a
[12:58] advancing and going
[13:01] forward it seems like the message is
[13:03] starting to become like a
[13:05] fantasy or a story that was told long
[13:09] ago or something that the younger folks
[13:12] just
[13:14] imagined uh so we have to keep it before
[13:17] you to remind you that it's
[13:20] real and that if you die tonight without
[13:24] uh Christ without being born again
[13:28] without this Revelation you're lost and
[13:31] you're gone to a devil's
[13:34] hell we need to talk a little bit more
[13:37] about
[13:38] hell because we talk about
[13:41] heaven it's Christ Our
[13:44] chaos amen it's Heaven or Hell one of
[13:48] the two what are we living for we got to
[13:52] live and be real to God and to
[13:56] ourselves and not just be a put on to
[13:59] the other message Believers around you
[14:02] that we can produce prophets words that
[14:05] we people can manufacture produce such a
[14:10] front that we look all we the mest
[14:13] religious and everything else and you
[14:14] can be a renegade a scadron a Outlaw a
[14:18] liar a
[14:19] cheat a no good
[14:22] arrest from the word of God we got to be
[14:26] real within ourselves listen I'm not
[14:29] just talking to you I'm feeling it while
[14:31] I'm talking because it's real to me if I
[14:35] don't live it that way it's no use my
[14:37] getting up there I'm talking to you or
[14:40] even making a claim that I'm a Believer
[14:42] right amen we've got to get this thing
[14:46] right where the rubber hits the
[14:48] road not on our lips but in our heart
[14:51] and in our feet walk with God God yes
[14:55] Lord until it grips you not you got the
[14:58] message but the message grips you until
[15:02] it let you go you're a prisoner you
[15:05] can't get away from it amen look I know
[15:09] Brothers uh that you know they go back
[15:12] up wide in the world and they try to

[15:27] Christian you shouldn't be here I I and
[15:29] the spirit of God rebuking that believer
[15:33] through Sinners that don't even know
[15:35] their background and tell them you're
[15:37] out of place you shouldn't be here at
[15:40] all amen let me tell you sometimes God

[17:45] them and pull them out amen we see
[17:48] several of gravs grow in this church
[17:52] from Sunday school listen we not here to
[17:55] to to push you and force you to be a
[17:58] Christian
[17:59] because it's all by lecture it's not
[18:02] because my father was Abraham and my
[18:04] mother was Sarah mean that I am going to
[18:06] be automatically saved I'm automatically
[18:09] going to be a Christian or there a
[18:11] failure if you don't get saved because
[18:14] let me tell you out of the same place y
[18:18] the prophet said come go good and evil
[18:20] yes out of the holy mother and father
[18:23] come Jacob and Es yes that's not their
[18:27] problem it's why you
[18:28] [Music]
[18:30] but they need to at least create the
[18:32] environment of Christianity they need to
[18:35] at least create the uh all the things
[18:38] that will be needed so that the child
[18:40] has no excuse you train them to talk
[18:43] them to show them everything andc to go
[18:45] other way you can advise but let me tell
[18:49] you every man have to answer for
[18:52] themselves
[18:54] Hallelujah why under your control uh in
[18:58] in terms of age and they get to a
[19:00] certain point when they become out
[19:02] they're still under your your guidance
[19:04] your counseling and everything else like
[19:06] that but become more mature they have to
[19:08] answer for themselves amen amen is that
[19:11] right yes praise God they have to answer
[19:13] for themselves yes sir and we're in a
[19:14] serious time where the devil's machine
[19:17] is grinding meat into uh you know I'm
[19:21] I'm just visualizing taking beef and
[19:24] throwing it in a grinder and grinding it
[19:26] that's how the devil is doing today and
[19:28] turning people into uh you know just
[19:31] grinding them up if God says who are
[19:34] these that eat up of the people eating
[19:37] up the people all the day long oh my
[19:40] that's why he said here the only things
[19:43] going to be in the Rapture is the Bride
[19:44] of Jesus Christ amen it will come to
[19:48] pass there would be genuine love among
[19:51] the people except for those that are in
[19:53] the bride of Christ make up put on
[19:57] everything is fake is that right even
[20:01] the women they giving them
[20:03] makeup right so and they end up they
[20:07] they're calling it to a mask it's not
[20:09] their real face what you see is a mask
[20:11] when they finished with with everything
[20:13] else they end up in a mask I'm talking
[20:15] about the Rapture but I'm trying to tell
[20:17] you the environment we are in that we
[20:20] have to be in that Rapture and the only
[20:23] way you're going to get in
[20:24] listen I truly be believe that before
[20:28] the church can have the rapure it's got
[20:31] to have rapturing
[20:33] faith amen you're not going to the
[20:36] Rapture unless you have rapturing faith
[20:40] rapturing faith amen listen we can't
[20:43] even have fi for our own Divine
[20:46] Healing let theone Rapture in faith we
[20:50] can't even uh God got to have faith we
[20:55] got to have faith now that will change
[20:58] and quit this Mortal body so it can be
[21:02] taken
[21:03] away Hallelujah I believe that there is
[21:08] a church like that on it Road tonight
[21:13] that church is a power of the Living God
[21:16] that that man will speak the word here
[21:19] and the word will go forth and Flash
[21:22] lightning from the amen and the church
[21:25] is coming out amen is coming out now not
[21:30] some psychologist church not some put
[21:33] onen not some make believe but a real
[21:38] genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out
[21:42] Church of the Living God prise be to God
[21:46] that's the Church of God the prophet of
[21:48] God looked and saw a church coming out
[21:51] believing the
[21:53] word now we know we talked about this
[21:57] rapture faith and we realize friends
[22:01] that rapturing faith means rapturing
[22:05] Revelation on the video you saw there
[22:08] they the Bible with the sword and across
[22:11] the revealed word amen not just the
[22:14] message not just the reading the Bible
[22:17] but the word revealed to
[22:20] you and then what does that do it gives
[22:23] you the rapturing faith rapturing fath
[22:26] he said is found in these
[22:29] messages rapturing Faith what is it it's
[22:33] not rapturing
[22:35] believing would be he no Rapture in
[22:40] faith and I show to you that Luther had
[22:44] one Faith
[22:45] justification amen sanctification that
[22:48] was the faith of the hour or the
[22:50] revealed word of the hour or the
[22:52] Revelation for the hour that would give
[22:54] those people in that age rapturing faith
[22:57] that was the faith to Rapture them out
[23:00] they just have to have justification to
[23:02] Rapture them out the next one only had
[23:04] to have this to Rapture them out now we
[23:07] are the ones at the end of the age and
[23:10] everything the whole world has been
[23:11] revealed to us and it's not rapturing
[23:14] believing it's the rapturing with the
[23:17] revelation of the prophet's message when
[23:20] it's made clear and plain to you and
[23:22] grips your heart you become Serv of God
[23:27] and that
[23:29] in
[23:30] you praise God hallelujah so it's not
[23:33] you got to walk around
[23:35] believing go rap tomorrow your faith
[23:38] week I may not go no once is revealed to
[23:42] you in that way and you recognize your
[23:45] position Hallelujah that there is only
[23:48] not many FS not this one that one but
[23:52] one thing one more one baptism praise

[25:28] mes as he was in the El God was speaking
[25:32] through the prophet I'm here
[25:36] [Applause]
[25:41] now you see what
[25:44] I'm he said I'm just standing here I'm
[25:48] just honored to be just aess instrument
[25:52] from God to you and the voice spoke out
[25:55] thus said the Lord
[25:59] amen your
[26:01] time your grace we get ready to go now
[26:06] hallelujah amen any day now he can split
[26:10] the Eastern Sky I'm not talking about
[26:13] the second coming when he comes back in
[26:15] flesh to Earth again like the last psong
[26:17] that was really talking about when he
[26:19] comes back to Earth again the next time
[26:21] but what I'm saying I'm talking about
[26:23] the Rapture right now amen hallelujah
[26:26] but he takes us out here now he told
[26:29] John to
[26:30] write write everything you see but yet
[26:34] when Revelation Ed the voice and
[26:38] Revelation 7 begin to preach it he turns
[26:42] around and says joh all right that's why
[26:45] people say the Bible contradicts but it
[26:48] doesn't contradict at all there's a
[26:50] reason why he said don't right now we
[26:53] understand that John only had a a
[26:58] glimpse of it and he did not have the
[27:00] full Revelation and John could only
[27:03] write the written word but there is no
[27:07] way for John to uh ascribe or inscribe
[27:12] the unwritten word right right because
[27:16] the unwritten word that it can't be
[27:19] written down that has to be
[27:22] re not written word but Ral word where
[27:27] God now reveals it to the individual
[27:30] because you see the Theologian can take
[27:31] the written word and teach it the
[27:34] masses they can teach you to make money
[27:37] they can teach you to become famous they
[27:40] can teach you for various reasons
[27:42] because that's the written word and it's
[27:45] like you're speaking in
[27:46] general but when you come down to the
[27:49] revealed word it starts to get
[27:51] specific an individual Amen to this one
[27:56] I Ral to that one to that one and each
[27:59] one at a different time it's not M thing
[28:01] where you just preach and everybody
[28:03] catches it at the same time that's why
[28:06] in every Church Believers are at
[28:07] different levels of spiritual growth
[28:10] never be the same like that not nature
[28:13] tells you that you look at the field the
[28:15] whole field doesn't come up all at the
[28:18] same time right no they one by one they
[28:21] G
[28:23] Port amen I'm not talking about heaven
[28:26] now I'm talking about breaking in to the
[28:28] revelation of the word amen hallelujah
[28:31] one by one we the P there to dwell with
[28:36] the Immortals because when the
[28:38] Revelation breaks into you breaks and
[28:40] you break into that realm he says you
[28:43] you you enter already into eternity
[28:45] you're potentially resurrected you're on
[28:48] the way the the process start turn
[28:54] imortality
[28:56] imortality
[28:58] of the word of God getting a hold of
[28:59] your soul amen begin to work from your
[29:02] soul Spirit right into your body Same
[29:06] Spirit that ra Christ from the dead when
[29:10] Quicken

[29:22] resurrect the dead body so that you
[29:25] would have fith for
[29:28] so when he comes again that you can
[29:31] believe that he's able to raise you up
[29:34] and that power is PA said that power
[29:37] work in us
[29:39] now work in us now the change is right
[29:43] on now brother B said it's going on now
[29:46] he says you're raised up from sin didn't
[29:48] you he says your soul changed didn't it
[29:52] yes your mind change the way your think
[29:55] change it's of process changing and now
[29:58] it's going to your body and St to work
[30:00] on your body and the change is a we in
[30:03] progress God hallelujah if the same
[30:06] spirit that raised Christ from the dead

[31:54] to church because we want to have a
[31:56] meeting but there's going to be a
[31:58] meeting over there a meeting like never
[32:01] have before if be noy let me warn
[32:07] you
[32:10] Shing millions of people shouting
[32:12] together why because they're seeing the
[32:15] same thing
[32:17] hallelujah amen because you're see what
[32:20] I'm see
[32:23] hallelujah oh if you could only stand on
[32:26] the rock where Moses stood because if
[32:29] you stand there you're going to see what
[32:30] he saw if you stand on the Rock
[32:33] revelation
[32:34] of you want to see
[32:37] what you need a vision to see what he
[32:40] saw you just need
[32:44] a need a revelation from God to see what
[32:47] he
[32:48] saw brother God we need rapturing faith
[32:53] and that's what we preaching here we are
[32:55] preaching the rapturing faith
[32:57] this is the faith that going to take the
[32:59] people out and they can get the
[33:01] revelation of the word of God listen we
[33:05] don't
[33:05] know what those Mysteries are yet back
[33:08] then he's
[33:10] speaking but in my my opinion they're
[33:14] about to be revealed right away glory to
[33:17] God hallelujah and when they
[33:22] do it will give fit for rapturing Grace
[33:28] for the Church of the Living God
[33:30] hallelujah and so we are in the season
[33:34] now what back then it was prophecy now
[33:37] we are the prophecy we are the
[33:40] Fulfillment of the prophecy and we're
[33:42] walking in the prophecy many of us our
[33:45] parents was in this message my mother
[33:47] and father God blessed his soul I
[33:50] baptized him in water in the name of the
[33:52] Lord when I was just about 18 years old
[33:54] glory to God many other sitting in here
[33:57] their mothers and their fathers were in
[33:59] this message Hallelujah they didn't come
[34:01] this far up to catch all this Revelation
[34:04] but we going to me that
[34:07] over why because the standing out on the
[34:11] right message going to the right
[34:13] direction as long as they D going in
[34:15] that direction they're going to end up
[34:17] in the right
[34:18] place Hallelujah they don't need the
[34:21] rest of it to make it but the B says
[34:24] once they CAU Luther's justification the
[34:26] genuine ones that's it the veil is
[34:30] already ripped Hallelujah he says that
[34:33] wash woman she just needs one
[34:36] Revelation amen that is enough to take
[34:39] her opens the door brings you into the
[34:42] presence of Mighty God and then he
[34:44] reveals to each one how much he wants to
[34:47] reveal he might reveal more to a
[34:49] preacher might reveal he says you know
[34:52] little F great F much F he shows that
[34:56] that happens that that's the way it is
[34:57] in the P presence of God so don't you
[35:00] start mourning because oh I don't know
[35:02] as much as brother Mike no each one is
[35:06] individual and God will reveal something
[35:08] different to you Hallelujah God gives us
[35:12] Ace separately as he will every one of

[44:11] consumption praise the Lord hallelujah
[44:14] and that's what he's talking about but
[44:16] people don't have any respect some
[44:18] people don't have no respect for the
[44:20] minister of this the Ministers of this
[44:21] day because they're not the
[44:24] prophet they don't torch has been passed
[44:28] and that Spirit broke itself up and went
[44:31] into a whole bunch of men a little piece
[44:34] little piece there again a little piece
[44:36] little piece there little piece over
[44:38] there and then breaks up when it sees f
[44:41] for his glory and for
[44:43] his and he will make it PL in time and
[44:47] he feels that he wants to make it play I
[44:50] not believe that time is
[44:52] now I think this message has been
[44:55] setting in in the jar and it's being
[44:59] fermenting and dis distilling until you
[45:03] know all the MU come on the top and we
[45:05] able to skim it off and throw it theide

[46:04] message it was to gather up these
[46:06] Mysteries to make it clear Seven Seals
[46:09] page 143 now at the end of that
[46:12] Pentecostal age we are supposed to
[46:15] receive according to the word God help
[46:17] me tonight a messenger that will take
[46:21] all the new STS and reveal the whole
[46:24] secret of God
[46:26] for the rapturing of the church amen
[46:30] hallelujah the secret is right there now
[46:33] to us it look like a simple as plain we
[46:35] can even rle it up with
[46:37] shout you think the people in those
[46:39] denominations really know anything much
[46:42] about that they read it but they don't
[46:44] have no understanding of what they're
[46:45] reading amen they don't have no
[46:48] understanding but but because we in a
[46:49] message we just take these things for
[46:51] granted that oh we know this we know
[46:53] that oh I heard that already I heard
[46:54] this already you know I'm understand
[46:56] that you dealing with jewels you dealing
[46:58] with Rich stuff is that right praise God
[47:02] you know when people get really really
[47:04] really
[47:05] rich the woman will toss all the jewelry
[47:08] like that on the you know on a dresser
[47:11] like if it's just
[47:12] nothing right and those of us who have
[47:15] just a couple thing here and there we
[47:16] want to lock it up and safe everything
[47:19] else because that might be the only one
[47:21] you
[47:24] have TR but you find people like that
[47:27] when they're really
