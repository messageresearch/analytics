in the presence of the Lord amen um there's a little song that I love um we're together again can you can you remember that one all right let's let's try to sing it doesn't matter if my voice warbles instead of singing right we're together again just praising the Lord we're together [Music] again in one [Music] Accord something good is going to happen something something good is in store we're together again just praising the Lord one more time we're together again just praising the Lord we're together again in one Accord Hallelujah something good going to happen something good is in store we're together again just praising the [Music] Lord God bless you we want to welcome our pastor back into his place and position here praise God God bless him God bless sister Jennifer I was so happy to see uh her yesterday and to see him here today in the house of the Lord praise God God bless every one of you some of the Saints of course some of the faces Hearts I missed you all and uh the love of God uh dwells within us we just can't help us help it because this world is not our home uh we we sing it as a song but when the reality begins to strike you that we are not from this place uh this corrupt cess poool as brother Brandon call it this hell on Earth now uh that's going on we're going to be taken out of here I'm not in a rush to go but I'm just telling you the facts that we will be taken out of here so while we are here live live every moment that you can live amen you don't know how long you are uh will be allowed to be on this Earth uh so uh he gave us Abundant Life go out and live Abundant Life live abundantly let God have his way within your heart praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus God bless every one of you uh I have a scripture here out of Exodus chap 32 verse 26 you know every speaker has their own way or or every uh Son of God called by the Holy Spirit God shapes them uh a certain way and they can't help that they have to be who and what they are and to bring the word of God to you so uh that's why Paul said let us not compare ourselves among ourselves because there's only one of you God has never made two things the same that is why he's the Great I Am no matter if you have twins they're not the same God knows the difference and so each one of us here is unique in in our own way praise the lord we all built that you understand we are the stars that were up there so you're a star that's what I'm telling you uh literally we're not talking about Hollywood we're talking about the Holy Woods of God we come from from the presence of almighty God and we are thankful for this great opportunity that we can be here on this Earth for this brief period of time to serve him down here while we are here praise the Lord uh if I can put H half of how I served him up there while I'm down here oh my goodness I'll be more than happy but praise the Lord let us just come together as one United and praising the Lord God bless you Exodus chapter 32 uh verse 26 let's read that together one voice then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the Lord's Side let him come unto me and the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him praise the Lord father we thank you for the reading of the word and we pray that the great Holy Spirit whom seems to be a stranger to many uh not uh just hearing about him just worshiping him in a tradition but not recognizing the personal reality of your presence that you are really here and that you are really among us and that you really walk up and down among us when we come together oh God bring this reality right to us that we might recognize your living personal presence father not just another worship uh come together to sing sing on to read the scriptures but to experience and to be in the presence of the Living God we ask your blessing upon the word the stirring of the waters the quickening of the word let this word become wine to our souls and may the great Holy Spirit take all the praise the honor and the glory in Jesus name amen and amen amen please be seated did it doesn't matter which preacher it is how marvelous and how wonderful this ministry is in every congregation every congregation uh there was always these Kora and dayon spirits that always gain say the prophet as they gain say Moses in the wilderness how many knows the scripture amen well um I'm not going to preach on that but you have those same Spirits usually in every church and they G saing the pastor the question uh uh what the pastor is saying how he's saying it his style of saying it whether uh uh he's this or he's that way or the other way but God is warning all the church that regardless of way back then brother Brandon even said it don't say anything just don't say nothing you even have your own thoughts talk to God but don't say anything keep your heart and your mind upon the Lord praise the Lord uh I woke up early um uh a few mornings ago and I saw a certain uh Preacher Brother in um Toronto area I already spoke to him and saw this kind of thing going on in his congregation um of course I just spoke to him in general terms and let him know he needs to be vigilant watchful prayerful and let the great Holy Spirit um have his way within that congregation so we believe that the God we serve is still alive and living and that he keeps his word uh we all built differently but it's all for the glory of God and so a lot of these personalities because God takes the man but not the spirit so cor and dayon are gone but the spirit that was upon them it is still around and it will settle on anybody that uh creates the environment for for for them to settle on a bird will make a nest on your head if you make the environment right uh you see and that's what I'm trying to say in a nice way a thought will come in your mind if you create the uh mental environment for it and uh it'll just settle right there okay so we find out that there was a separation time in the wilderness and today what I'm talking about that that separation time has gone through several cycles and now that separation time is here it really is here and I'm not talking about you separating yourself from somebody else or from some Christian or some believer but there is a natural a supernatural separation taking place by the Holy Ghost brother brandham often Illustrated it by talking about the uh the the shock uh and talk about when the heat of the Sun comes upon it the shock naturally just curls away from the seed it not that it uh the seed wants to separate itself from the shock but the heat the the shock just can't take it anymore and it naturally just curls away uh from that seed right praise the Lord now so there was a separation in the wilderness and that is why Moses is saying there's now the time has come when we must make a a sober and serious decision amen of which side we are on who is on the Lord's Side who is on the side of the revealed word stand on that side Take A Stand upon on that revealed word hallelujah and who is just uh following the message uh take a stand for that if you want to do that but who is on the Lord's Side amen come nigh unto me not Moses it's the spirit of Christ in him was calling come nigh unto me as the spirit is crying out and calling for his sons and others to come close to him well some accepted the word that came through the prophet and understood by Revelation that that was God hiding in Moses and when he went to pharaoh and he asked who sent you Moses answered and said I am that I am of course he thought he was just telling him well I was told to tell you I am that I am but but he didn't realize it was God speaking through him and telling pharoh I am that I am amen I'm in him here now when I'm talking to you amen and if you don't listen this going to happen Frog's going to happen that's going to happen fli is going to happen uh uh snow is going to come this is going to happen like we are here today if God were to bring any of those things who's going to stop him you think you can take a gun and fire at the snow and say go back to the north no no sounds funny but God is saying like what he said to Job he said if I send the the the snow and the hor FR us who is going to tell it anything who's going to stop it he can just pile it up wherever you want and shut down everything if he wants to just like that don't even have to raise his finger what a mighty God we serve of course when we talk like this it sounds like you are talking vain imaginations to these people it sounds like you caught up in some religious fiction you know they caught up in a religious spirit and so they they're saying all these things but to those of us whom the reality of this word has struck our hearts you can't take this away from us and and I mean reality reality as much as you can be sitting in a room and literally feel the next person walk into the room you can be praying by your bed and you can actually know when that other person come and sits on one end of it listening to you the reality of God unfailing realities of the Living God Amen so you'll find out friends that we have got to take sides with this revealed word of the hour right and we found out that many people have walked with us as we sing the song there were many who started out in this race but but with this word going forward and moving on they failed to keep Pace when the rhythm of the word changed they didn't change with the Rhythm and they just want to keep playing the same music that was being played before but it's not the same amen even though we hear the same quotes we read the same scriptures we we sing the same songs but there is a an understanding and a revelation that only the Spirit of almighty God can give to you amen no preacher no teacher no matter how look my God I tell you I had an office there filled with loaded with books everywhere you talk about that you know the librarian in the in the um denomination at the time and you talk about the Greek and the Hebrew and the let me tell you those things are wonderful but when you come to understand God isn't asking for that we only need that for Earthly survival you've got to go and get schooling education as bright as you can to survive while you're on this Earth but for God to use you he doesn't eat any of that thank you Jesus all he needs for you to do is to surrender to him hallelujah hallelujah so that he can live in you and anything you want to know he'll let you know in other words instead it's not God coming to use your brains it's not God coming to use your mind he's invited us to come and use the vast uh uh intelligence of his mind the mind of Christ so you are Unlimited in your spiritual understanding not because you studied that's natural and that's good but that's not we're talking about that's good but I'm talking about spontaneity of the Holy Spirit flowing through the individual and God glorifying himself by him speaking his own word through the individual or individuals for his glory that's some of what we're talking about I can't even fully explain it but I just want you to understand that's why Paul said don't you understand that preaching is really a mystery it's not just uh getting up and uh putting together a nice uh um uh word of God whether extemporaneous whether it's uh one that's topical uh doing uh religious and exegesis and all this type of stuff it's good it's good and what those men whether they're in the denomination or outside what they're doing is good but that's not what he's asking for he's asking for us to surrender ourselves that he could live in us and through us that the Holy Spirit can glorify his own self amen Hallelujah flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me oh my that is what we need get out of the way and let him flow through you amen praise the name of the Lord godj hallelujah amen yes now a lot of people walk with us through the years but where are they now you see each one finds their position when water comes it drops to its lowest position or wherever it has to go it just trickles and goes there and so many come in to the message and then all of a sudden the many are not there wonderful people that you think were so strong and so firm and in natural things maybe they are but spiritually because of not really fully seeing the glory and magnificence of and Splendor of the scripture uh they just walk away thinking it's a normal natural thing they can just uh move from a church and move to a next church and uh every church is not the same and uh uh when you use the word church one by tradition and another one by Revelation amen you see praise the Lord I don't know what I'm saying fully here all of what I'm saying but if I say one thing that can lift you one step higher I leave here happy glory to God thank you Lord now they turn back and they died and are dying in this world's Wilderness y it's a Wilderness here today you know we living in a desert without bread and water you know Amos said the hour will come that the world will become so uh desperate like a desert spiritually no bread no water nothing amen you go out there searching for the fullness of the truth and you can't find it anywhere Amen brother brandham said a world built upon deceit and lies everywhere from the sales clerk to the boss to the this to the that it's just a lies pouring out everywhere you understand we are in the middle of a stream of s satanic and demonic activity this it's getting so thick and dark as it was in Egypt but this is a spiritual Darkness until people are comfortable living walk and existing in that manner and the devil is normalizing his lies his murder his hatred his stealing everything he's normalizing it and the people are dying in the willness again you know what testings and the trials of this life are killing a lot of people's faith and they don't realize it the Lord test them test them test them burning them through the fire and everything else he already told you there is no testing I can give you that can really overcome you not testing that I will give you he says that I'm going to give it to you that's going to really kill you or take no see you of yourself you got to give him you got to surrender right you got to give up and then that will happen but the people the the trials and testings are killing them so many are dying through their testings but they you see the the elect bride she lives ripens and matures by those same testings The Heat Of The Sun dries up the spiritual life of one and it ripens and puts sweetness into the other one as they continue walking with the word and living in the s o n light shining upon them it baks the greenness and the sourness and the and the hatred and the unforgiving spirits and lying Spirits cheating and everything else it takes it out of them amen the Holy Spirit working by the word begins to take it out listen to brother brandom here in the unveiling of God now what's the shik kind of Glory today to break Beyond the Veil to see who God Is Standing before you now remember the Sho bread seed amen the word that we are living on in this day by these promises the sh kind of Glory right s up that true bread and brings it to pass makes it bread to the believer and that laid in the pages of that this Bible year after year after year the word for this age amen it's been laying in the Bible years year after years and men and women reading it but not seeing these things but the time has come when the word of God is being fulfilled now so while they were all in the desert Joshua Caleb and all the others were in the desert they were all suffering for lack of water is that right there's one time all of us were suffering for lack of the word we out in the denominations you know I'm reminiscing with the with a couple of Brothers how we were all out there in the denomination hungry for something you know something isn't right you you you but you don't know what and you don't know where to go or what to believe but that there was that thirst within your heart so there were suffering without water uh uh and here uh Joshua and Caleb were tested and suffering without food uh they felt the same heat they felt the same burning and uh they were burning up because of the sun amen just like anybody else if we're all outside we all going to feel the heat of the sun same as them unbelievers praise God I'm going to stop a moment you know the word unbelief unbelief is not disbelief right the person believes but uh to convey what I am is in my thoughts here on untie what do you mean something that was tied up you loose unravel something that was you know all together all of a sudden it starts falling apart now the Bible says unbelief the faith of that person begins to unravel it it starts falling apart because of what the heat of the way the along the way the testings the trials that come why would God put this but he knows why no wonder job says my God I never heard of anybody else been through trials like me I I can almost seeing job says but I don't care I though he kill me though he slay me I am going to serve him I'm going to worship Him brother Bram said even if he sent me to hell I'll still love him praise God but Abraham said shall not the judge of the Earth Do Right amen so if he send me to Hell he's still doing right whatever he does is right I I just lay my life in his hands and whatever he wants to do with me is Right amen so brother sister I don't know the toils of this road when you come to understand it will seem as nothing when we come to the end of the way amen Joshua and Caleb live under the same circumstances same conditions like the unbelievers but the scriptures say the difference was they had a different Spirit the scriptures said they had a different Spirit they had a different attitude upon them and I thank God that uh I didn't cultivate a different Spirit you didn't cultivate one you didn't go to Dale Carnegie courses or something like that to develop a a a a dynamic personality or read some psychologist or listen to some preachers as lot of message preachers are doing today preaching psychology instead of preaching the word of God uh how to be happy and how you can be this and how to be that and whatever else rather than sticking and staying with the word for the hour uh that type of thing but Brothers here it is even though they were undergoing the same trials they did not murmur even once they did not murmur against God or against the word against the prophet not even one time amen hallelujah I'm telling you brother sister we come into this world and there is something God deposited in us we call that the gene yes the seed in us God deposited it not because we have a better personality a better this than anyone else but against our own self God put something in there amen he put a captain that can control the ship for his glory for his honor and for his praise amen and that genuine certified seed of God in you gave you a different Spirit go back to when you were just young maybe just a child and somewhere in your heart you know that you were different doesn't matter I can remember I would stand there and I it could be a thousand people around me and yet I would suddenly feel alone yes I'm different but I didn't know why why I was like that how can I be in a whole crowd people all around me everybody's rejoicing happy with what they're doing and I'm there in the midst and I feel alone thank you Jes different God made us different for a purpose and for his glory amen hallelujah so because of that seed in you it makes you different and it gives you a different understanding to the same word that they brething you get a different understanding to that word that God gave to us hallelujah praise God praise the Lord but you know when all of these trials and testings are over God will lead us over to the promised land and all the other ones they borns are going to be found in the wilderness quotation again praise praise the Lord the pilgrim fathers oh so can we be thankful oh my I thought we were having that up there as pilgrims like Abraham separated uh himself from the things of the world all of our Associates Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all the dead religions amen separated us and opened to us a new land a new message for this day am I saying that he's telling you that though we have the message he's saying but God has opened up a new land yes a new message for this day am I making up something no it's it's right there in front of you it's just that we don't want to accept what what's been given to us because it sounds too good to be true or unbelievable but it's the truth you see Pentecost came and it dried up how many knows that Pentecost has dried up back there and all of the rest of them good but there are good people in there you know that the scriptures telling you that and they have to come out so we have a Ministry and our ministry to do what you talking to your church friends you're talking to your religious friends share with them this message that a prophet has come amen it sounds simple but you have you heard that a prophet has come did you know about William brandham yes I heard about William brandham how they say he's this he's that and that you see but the way is opened already you can start talking about the prophet you may have to be the reproach for the word of God but you still have to share the word be share the word that's what you need to do praise God this is not the to day do you walk up to some do you know Jesus have you been born again it sounds good but that's the Pentecostal approach what we have to talk about is that God has sent a prophet in this 20th century amen and the name of that Prophet happens to be William man Mar and Brandon amen and he's proven by God by multitudes of signs wonders and miracles and then he progressed to where God Vindicated his word through him amen now Pentecost dried up see what did he do he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message amen he opened up the Seven Seals for us to the glory of God hallelujah amen let me tell you all of our trials and testings down here will soon be over and all those persevering Joshua's and calebs the great holy spirit is going to lead them to their Homeland bright and fear I I I want to uh go back to some of by the message I preached a few weeks ago and talk about the eagle again can I talk about the eagle again and brother brandom I want to quote him the female eagle is sometime the largest the eagle sometimes their wingspan is like from 14t from tip to tip they can pick up a calf and fly away with it oh my 14 ft see Wings can and go right across now she gets up there before them little fellows because she's going to take him on a flight amen praise God he's never been out of that Nest she's going to take him up into the heavens praise God to learn how to fly she wants to show her Authority praise God hallelujah see when God starts to open up the word of God to you you start get a fuller revelation of God's authority over your life his rulership as the headship of the body she spreads forth her big wings strutting them feathers screams so they know her voice they know her Authority and then she starts flapping her wings right the feathers fly out of the nest as we spoke on you know God knock out the loose feathers from us all the looseness about this or that the Holy Spirit begins to knock it right out and then she flaps her wings and the wind he says like a jet plane it gets so strong it knocks them fellows on our back on their backs amen I believe sometimes the Holy Spirit literally have to take some of us and knock us on our back literally until you come to yourself realize that no other help I know I got no other help my help is in the Lord my faith is in the Lord my hope is in the Lord amen he is my rock he's my Fortress he is my everything I'm resting in him only he can take me out of this fiery furnace only he can open the prison doors at midnight only he can send an angel and cause the Earth to quake and bring me out at any time and I rest my case upon him that this is the word this is the promise amen hallelujah sometimes you got to get knock on your back I'm not going to go down that road preaching the knock on your back could be sickness can be the Holy Ghost knock you on your back so you receive the Holy Ghost can knock you on your back by situations and circumstances amen Oh my he says but it's when they're on their back they look up and they say oh mother how powerful you are oh my they start to realize how powerful she is oh my and then she said oh my How Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art and then he says see how strong my wings are I can eat even pick you up and pack you anywhere I want to I powerful when God begins to show you that he is so powerful if in these little thing he things he can deliver you and bring you out can't he use that same power and take you right into a Rapture right into Glory he's trying to let you know he is able he is capable of doing it all and to take us out of here glory to God amen amen she's telling those little legal believe I'm powerful to do what I'm telling you I'm powerful enough to do it Hallelujah I'm capable of doing it just in these little things you've seen through William Brandon just in these little things you see over here if you see those things yet you believe I'm so powerful I can take you out of here whenever I want to amen yes sir Hallelujah he can tell you that it don't matter what trouble you are in I'm sitting on the mountain and I'm looking I'm seeing what's going on when it gets to a certain point where it's going to really endanger your life then I'm able to soup down and take you out of your [Applause] troubles amen but you know he told Israel he says I can take you out your troubles uh but I'm not going to do it in a day L you start to think because of you're much prayer and screaming is what forced me to do it if you think by by your sacrifices you make me to do it he says no I'm going to take you out but will not I'm going to take you out month by month year by year I'm going to take you out in that way rather than just doing it like that amen and most of us we want to have instant Miracles we want to have instant deliverance we want to be taken out of situations right away but God said says no no no bit by bit little by little I'm going to take you out I'm going to take you out of itall praise God hallelujah oh my you get praise God you get caught up in any trouble I can come down at any time and pick you up on them these 14 ft wings and take you out of your troubles that you're in amen oh praise God showing them how our Authority our capability and our power of our presence but she's there always watching brother Bram says I stood there in the wild and there was that eagle sitting on a high Rock she said she took her those little eaglets put them on the valley floor left them down there and just flew up and sit there and looking down she said and there they were having a wonderful time but watch he says if a wolf or a coyote or some other animal thought they can come close and and harm them Oh my he said she'll be down there like a bolt of light amen and so is God trying to tell us when you get into trouble when the devil is after you when the problem surround you you don't know where to turn you don't know what to do amen oh praise God he'll swoop down when you least expect and take you out of your troubles wonderful he's greater than all your problems I said God is greater than your problems he's greater than your trials greater than any storm greater than anything that will come your way amen hallu that's what God was doing through brother brandham when he was doing all the miracles signs wonders he's showing you look you don't understand how powerful I am you know how many times the dead was raised by the ministry of William Marian Branham amen but it was not the man William brandham it was God in him using him as a vessel the Creator had come in his creation which he used as a disguise to display his presence his power his authority and his ability to Deliver Us from any trouble we glory amen praise God hallelujah showing us that he's powerful marvelous and all we have to do walk with him amen I told the story back when I was just a little boy well I'm short now as I've always said but imagine when I was just a boy at school how short I must have been and uh you know I always want to those guys will come and Chuck you and try to bully you but then I just go tell my elder brother and then he'll come in the afternoon and I'll walk out with him but by then I have courage I'm walk out with him and I walk up to those guys knowing that he's standing there watching and say oh you're talking to this morning what is that you were saying you see you see that's what he wants you to know why don't you have courage I'm standing here I'm with you amen God in the shadows is watching over his own he loves his children he loves his people he will not let us go no matter the devil's job is to tell lies constantly suggest things to you see God don't care you see you you think a loving God God will allow you to go through this you think he he that's his all the time he's trying to flood your mind flood your thoughts all the time with with with things like that not knowing that God is using the testings the trials that's burning up some others he's using it to shape you he's using it to make you he's using it to mold you and to make you into whatever he wants you to be and I want to be whatever he wants me if he wants to make me into a bell and I want to be a bell is that right even if the Bell happens to be a dumb Bell I still I still want to be a bell if that's what he wants that is what I want amen praise God are you going through situations now that you can't control explain understand private personal financial whatever the situation is God wants you to know he is capable and he knows about it thank you if a prophet can stand on the platform and I'm telling you because this husband and wife spoke personally to me and they gave their testimony and the brother even became a preacher that how he was dying with cancer and the cancer was eating up his stomach to the point that his dying while alive his body was giving off a horrible stench that the wife drove from Arizona to Brother bram's house in Indiana right and had to do it with the windows of the vehicle open right because of the Sten that was coming from him and brother brandham prayed and said God go bless you go on your way you're healed God will deliver you well he wasn't healed right instantly a year later he wasn't healed two years later he wasn't healed she drove him back to brother brand said but you said he says sister only believe all things are possible to them that believe they went back to Arizona and all of a sudden uh he just start feeling different go to the doctor check up on him you have no cancer they don't know how you can come back from the dead literally with a cancer already eating up your insides and all of a sudden you're made whole by the power of God because God is able to do anything all things are possible to them that will believe the word of God do you believe does thou believe thank you Jesus if you don't believe ask God God help my unbelief do something to cause me to believe that I can see you in your glory and recognize your presence breing the power of the devil set you free bring you out of your prison in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah take you out any problem take you out of any sickness you're in take you out of anything as long as you walk with him oh let's walk with him many of the Saints KN there's a old song I love so much come walk with me the way is straight and narrow the holy spirit is asking us to walk with him come walk with me you cannot walk alone for the way is rough and there are many dangers come walk with me and I will see you home and so today I walk with Christ my savior my blinded eyes had caused my feet to roam oh my and then I Heard a Voice so sweetly calling oh Bride come walk with me and I will see friends he'll see us home in the Rapture he'll see you home between now and the Rapture there may be still test trials but hold on I said hold on change is coming hold on the Rapture is coming hold on Jesus is coming praise God the body changed they've been preaching in for years that your body is just going to change but we understand now is that you're going to change from a flesh body to a theophany body that's going to become and so we as Christians we don't die we just move from one body to another body right praise the name of the Lord we move into another body and we thank the Lord praise God hallelujah yes sir see we got to be careful we don't start murmuring and complaining yes because there's a price to pay for murmuring and complaining God God Is Watching he listening hallelujah look many for many years a lot of people follow this message and if I'm going pause here it has nothing to do with how many years you're in the message amen some people want to establish their their eldership their power and their presence by how many years they been in the message has nothing to do with it a young man can walk in into the message tonight and the Holy Spirit can reveal himself like he did to Paul by the next day midday and he can walk away and be the most powerful apostle that God wants to use it has nothing to do with how many years you've been following this how many courts you know is how much God favors You by revealing his word to you but Paul said but Lord why me why me I was a murderer not of even Ordinary People I murdered Christians I put them in prison I put them in jails I am I am the chief of Sinners oh God hallelujah my God but when he was on that roadway and heard that voice out of that bright shining light brighter than the sun he says amen Saul Paul why persecutest thou me not the people not the the church is him because she is him revealed is that right praise God she is him now being revealed praise God and they they don't they read Christ is the mystery of God revealed yeah Christ back there was the mystery of Jehovah revealed but now this one Christ is is the mystery of God reveal is this bride is revealing him now him in you making himself known to the world Hallelujah you said me I I I I got this I got that don't worry there is something in you even there is one quality that God is going to shine it out to somebody and they'll recognize that wasn't him that was something Beyond him that's Supernatural in him doesn't matter who you are how the devil tried to get you twisted up in your mind that I am this and I am that and I got this flaw and I got that flaw Prophet said you going to out flaws till right that sticky nature will be with you until you go into Rapture you're going to have it and the devil is going to play on that but don't keep your eyes on the Storm keep your eyes on the word and let that take you right in for the glory of God the devil with his trouble with his lying deceptions and distractions get your mind focused on this and that stay on the word of God hallelujah amen yes sir praise God so now you remember that the apostles followed Jesus like a lot of people have followed this message how many knows that praise the Lord but amongst those that was following the message or following Jesus who was the message of that day there was one named Judas Bible says and Judas was amongst them and uh they came out of Egypt with Mo Moses and Kora and Dayan was amongst them we're talking about spirits now we're not here talking about people but those spirits come upon people and use them and they think because they're thinking their own private sec secret thoughts nobody knows God doesn't know God knows everything he knows you you can't he says um brother Bram said look an insect can't even move the antenna and he doesn't know about he knows about he does you can't even move it you know I was like I said brother Ernest fander was telling me he says you don't understand how sensitive the spirit on that man was that he was telling me how great God used him with the miracle and healing over here and raising up the dead here and I just thought uh you're just boasting you're talking about yourself he said that man immediately turned and said what did you say Arie my God and he said oh no I didn't say because he really didn't say anything he didn't say anything so he said oh no I didn't say anything he says come on Ernie you know better than that you know better than that telling me you didn't see anything he said well you know I just thought that you were boasting about yourself he says you're right but not the way you're thinking I was talking about those things because he used me to do those things but I was really boasting in him like David said in God I boast all the day long right but I'm boasting in him because those things were done through me as an instrument right but it's given him glory and honor and praise Hallelujah but so sensitive that just one little thought picked it up right away see God is like that you can't even think you know any un we think sometimes you can be in prayer I can talk myself being in prayer and and your thoughts just go off a little bit like that and right away you have to pull yourself back and say oh my goodness Lord Jesus help us amen and allow because that's a human being is built that way and Satan is constantly bombarding your thoughts your mind the greatest battle ever thought is to keep yourself focused and let the word of God take control of your life amen praise the Lord can I go on a little bit more amen praise the Lord hallelujah praise God so three and a half years they were following Jesus you know that Jesus lived for three and a half years praise the Lord and the other three and a half Daniel 7th weeks you know that and how he's going to come down in Israel there but anyway praise the Lord they followed they were actually following Jesus the word he was the Living Word and they were following that amen you just was following that so following the message what are you talking about I followed the message I've been in it for three years Judas was too so so what it's not just following the message it's coming to a place where the Holy Spirit begins to give you a revelation of the message an understanding between you and him amen like an understanding comes between husband and wife amen unspoken understanding but it's there and they can talk without talking because they have that spiritual understanding they're United the spirits are one spirit with spirit will meet the Holy Spirit deep calls to the deep and they will meet and they will be able to fellowship and Converse praise God and sometimes uh the conversations uh the human part of you can even put it in words cuz there's not words to put it in praise the name of the Lord hallelujah remember that they all heard the message from Jesus we all heard the message from the prophet in this day we all heard the message it right directly but they were hearing this message not from just brother William brandham but from Jesus himself who was the god Prophet amen you know I said God Prophet because all the others were prophets of God who had sent them right but now Jesus was God himself come down in this body named Jesus to be his own prophet and to speak through him God speaking to the world through him and that's why the Pharisees come to such trouble because they didn't recognize who that really was they recognized the body that it come from Nazareth that it come from Mary that it come from Joseph over there over here and they were just talking about that but they weren't looking at the other part that can break bread and all of a sudden showing that I am still the Creator break the bread like that all of a sudden it becomes all thousands of Loaves and thousands of fishes I'm just in a body but I am still the Creator he's trying to show them who he was he goes to Lazarus grave who can call call back the dead gone for three 4 days into the great beyond and say Lazarus come forth that voice went right out to the great beyond and bring him right back to where who can do that he showing them I am powerful I am capable I have the authority I'm the great Creator I I I'm just limit myself into this body so that I can just display some of myself to you not all but some of myself and you can be able to see what nature what personality what kind of being that I am invisible or your eyes can't see me yet you will be able to recognize amen by seeing all of this glory to God hallelujah hallelujah amen yes sir praise God they heard the word but you know even though they heard the word you know what Jesus said before he left he says you need to go up to Jerusalem and receive the Holy Ghost but you shall receive power amen after not before even though you got all that word all that message all those quates you can put them all together you can preach like Peter and Judas and all of them did with that and have even powerful min ministries of preaching the word and and casting out devils and even Healing The Sick and yet he said but you will receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you amen then you'll be Witnesses unto me praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God the Holy Spirit breaks all of this to you himself praise the Lord yes sir and so we find out that Judas was hearing Jesus himself and yet he was deceived right you heard this message and a lot of people still deceived uh what they were uh in what they doing praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and you know with Judas that how you know he had a Ministry the Bible says he had a Ministry I think it's in Acts chapter 1 where Peter was speaking Peter was saying and you know he had a part of this ministry right he was preaching the word when the disciples came back said Lord even the devils are subject to us in thy name he was casting out Devils yes he was he was going up around telling that Jesus was the Messiah he was preaching the literal message amen but Le said yes that's wonderful you're doing it at that level because the message tells you to do do it because I said to do it you you just went out and you start doing it and of course you're going to get the confirmation of it that what I'm saying is the truth but you shall receive power only after the Holy Ghost has come upon you so you can be Witnesses of me Hallelujah so today we have a lot of people who walk with him the same way the message right uh through the they walk through the first pull they walk through the second pull and under the third pull the word went into another dimension the word went into another dimension is that right praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so so we see the the the music score just suddenly change and and they realize it change and they keep walking and yes they're walking they're walking with him and a lot of people are going to be saved that are not in the bride you know that you realize the book of life has different uh parts to it those who are the har for the 4,000 going to be like guards and those who are going to be servants and those who are going to be this and be be that but the bride elected lady elected for himself that's going to be with him in the throne and there are going to be other believer but they'll have to take a lower place somewhere else they the same piece of cloth but it's just wasn't allowed to be within the pattern but God by his grace put you in the pattern that you can be a part of him praise God forever more hallelujah amen the word goes into another dimension and this is a dimension of Revelation just like it was in the old Old Testament when he died on Calvary crucified the word of God there what happened the veil of the temple rent the veil of the temple rent the Bible says an angel came and rent it came with a sword and rent it praise God but look look it's it's all in the scriptures it's your eyes got to see it's the Holy Spirit got to make it known don't you understand the prophet himself go and preach that uh Resurrection the the crucifixion of Jesus Christ Christ was the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ well isn't the temple veil going to be rent again don't you understand the word is ripped again and only the elect allowed to go in and see what's in there for the glory of God hallelujah amen and God unveiling himself and revealing himself by the word hallelujah amen yes sir the disciple had the word but Jesus told them plain you got to have acts 1 18 right praise the Lord how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come you have the truth you got the message but when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise God they were told by the Lord Jesus in simple words that when the Holy Spirit comes that he will give you Revelation power to preach and teach the word the power of Revelation you'll be teaching the word but for with the power of Revelation to teach the word to heal the sick and even perform Miracles you believe that God still perform Miracles you don't go out for a Healing Ministry but God performs Miracles and he will do it too even now even this day praise the Lord hallelujah even while I'm talking now as simple as this you don't have to talk about miracles uh have a special healing meeting preach and miracles no because our God is a miraculous God he's a supernatural God anything he's able to do it's you what you pull like brother brandom said if you while I'm preaching here the anointing is here and you say oh God you know this problem nobody else knows about it just between me and you but I need to be delivered from this thank you I need this cancer to pass out of my body I I I need this this back ache here this arthritis that the the devil tried to convince me I having in my back I want it to end oh my praise God you think he's able to do that am Hallelujah right now oh my he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the lord we believe thank you do you know that uh last year I went to Africa and the morning before I went to Africa uh my wife literally had to help me to the bed because all of a sudden a back pain hit me like I never had before and she literally have to lift me not lift me but help me to get to uh the bed and the next day I have to fly to Africa the devil is saying don't go don't even bother you know look at the pain you're in the Dr so but said no the Holy Spirit sent me I still have to go so got to the airport got in a wheelchair going in a plane on wheelchair come out use another wheelchair in England move to the next plane wheelchair all the way going and coming so when I come back I have to see my doctor go and see the doctor afterwards and the doctor says I don't understand this you went you had this bad back pain and you went there how do you go there with a bad back pain like that oh my he says but the thing about it is what I'm looking at here it looks like all that banging and dropping in all those pot holes shift everything back into place Hallelujah I'm I'm standing here and walking around right now because what shift everything back into place but I would he told me that but I'm still feeling pain two three days for but I'm a week past the Pain's gone hallu [Applause] H somebody didn't come and say John Simon in the name of Jesus Christ rise up I'm just trying to let you see God is doing things now so that he can get the glory but see when he lifts up men men gets lifted up because they may not lift themselves up but just by being used of God with these various things people start looking oh brother so and so God is really using him he's a miracle man he's got a lot of faith you see God is now pulling back all that stuff so that you will look to him him alone person you know he will use Brothers but he only passing through them he's just using them but it's not them there's no great man little man no big man amen praise God look through the years have seen it some use money to make themselves big some use education to make themselves look big some use their cultural background and this and that to elevate themselves that's not what it is might give you a Earthly Ministry that looks big that's fine but that's not what this is brother sister this is a letting go and letting God have his his glory through you for his glory and honor Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord God Amen we still have some time you don't mind okay hallelujah praise the Lord you remember you know that Peter had a spoken word from Jesus himself you know Peter had the spoken word the literal because Jesus was speaking so if you had talk about spoken word it was coming out of the mouth of Jesus right to Peter and when Jesus was speaking the word listen what he says in Matthew 28 18-20 and Jesus spake unto them saying all power is given unto me you don't mind my kind of taking my time right take your time in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name notice it don't say names singular one name for this person that is Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm just taking a natural thing here just look at it naturally it's not plural it's already telling you it's one person so it says here name in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things wheresoever I've commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even today end of the world but on the day of Pentecost it's got to be that Peter disobeyed Jesus it means that uh Peter maybe rejected what Jesus said but that's not what happened before he had the Holy Ghost Jesus said that after he received the Holy Ghost and it comes upon Him amen by Revelation Peter OD what Jesus meant in Matthew 2818 and 19 by Revelation he understood and therefore he didn't go back and repeat the quote and say in the name of the father Glenn I baptize you in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost I'll dunk you one more time no he didn't repeat that because he knew the name of that person who is Father Son and Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ so when they ask him men and Brethren acts 238 what shall we do to be saved he says repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah praise God is right there for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the the Holy Ghost praise God hallelujah you see the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is not just a simple thing sometimes we think that it's the just the preaching on the pulpit is powerful but the water baptism the person just goes into the pool and go under and they come back out it's not as simple as that you receive the Holy Ghost after that the spirit of the you gone through the water baptism the spirit will come upon you and begin reveal himself to you Peter says don't you know you go in the water as a as a old man you come up as a new man amen you go into the water and you come back out and it's it's like your sins being washed away amen you're leaving them behind you're planted as a old man you come up as a new person to live for Glory of the glory of God hallelujah how many people out there are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ are you talking about it are you letting your friends know about it you know the Bible tells us Ezekiel that son of man you know these things and if you don't warn the wicked their blood will be required at your hands but if you warn the wicked and they don't want to listen and they go on then the blood is on their own head but you be sure you warn them let them know it's not just going to a church you're religious you're a good person you're you're moral you have integrity and that sort of thing that's wonderful but you must bear the name of your husband and the name is Jesus Christ amen you come to him and you take him in your life you take him in your heart you're baptizing his name you're walking his name praise God you wear the the Ring of righteousness upon you uh praise God and he cover you with the robe oh Hallelujah you're ready for the Rapture glory to God God hallelujah yes sir so Peter only begin to get Revelation fully after the Holy Ghost came upon you I won't talk about that but they can get Revelation before but it's just spotty it's just here and there they get little breaks in Revelation right in the message they'll get a little break here a little break there but to have continuous Revelation where it it literally takes you over and controls you praise God for his glory amen hallelujah Peter said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises what unto you that's them that were back there unto your children and to all that are a far off even as many as our Lord our God shall call Amen brother Bram said don't you understand is God still calling yes if he's still calling then this is for you yes this Holy Ghost is for you but you see the devil is cunning brother brandham talked about oh the days uh of all those Miracle meetings and those revivals are passed so some of them don't expect to have healings and the Holy Spirit moving in that kind of way anymore the prophet said says oh towns is not the initial evidence that doesn't mean that there is not real towns I speak in towns but I privately amen yes sir but you you understand see the devil always wants the Believers to throw out the baby and the B water the the the dirty water throw out the baby also no but no Mother's going to do that she'll throw out the dirty water and keep her baby amen and that's what exactly what God did through out the dirty water and keep his Jing right now what I'm saying to you brother and sister is that people say oh look I've gone to some of the major Church in this message these are churches with thousands maybe a few thousand people and I just start talking I haven't even gone five 10 minutes and people start shouting and crying and spirit of God start moving and after I'm done Minister may get up and said you know uh we are not Pentecostals we are believers of the message of brother brand well of course it's an it's a indirect uh you know uh thing to me that uh you're too much Pentecostal they don't understand that the foundation stone brother brandham said and the Capstone is the same Stone Alpha and Omega is the same amen they don't understand it one is here without having maybe a full Revelation Paul was the one that caught the full Revelation and began to spread it there but over here was everybody capable of receiving it right now Alpha Omega right so what I'm saying to you we are the original Pentecostals but the devil got it so much that it becomes like a curse word in the message if you say Pentecostal but you it's the Holy Spirit working on the life of the believer it will not be behave like it in the Pentecostal denomination uh um a pause here you know before Jesus came the devil sent the Pharisees and the Sadducees to start to put on an act of how a a a real righteous person should be and it was just a act so that when Jesus would come the people won't believe him because he's we have already already a pattern here and we've seen through a hundred years how a really good person will act and you come here and you breaking the whole thing up you saying that you're they're the devil and and and you are the Son of God and before Abraham was I am my goodness you see it's the same thing so the devil does the same thing Prophet speaks about healing he speaks about miracles he speaks about Pentecost said the system the days of the Pentecostal system is done it's dried up it's over it's gone not the spirit that was there that spirit is for every one of us it's Jesus Christ but the devil wants to scare you off from that amen praise the Lord look you know that right in this church when the little Revival broke out uh on in The Little White Church which would even people weren't even considering in the church it was just the thought it was like a barn or something but nevertheless people people would come in full of demons and scream and run out the doors some will fall on the floor the Holy Ghost would would be having his way praise God people will come in sit down and then the Holy Spirit start telling them their whole say not by calling them out but the preacher will start talking and preaching exactly their situation you can't know that somebody told you I want to fight the preacher but it was the whole Holy Ghost you see and and the church was like that day after day some of you are still here that saw some of those things and my goodness people were coming as far as windso Aur they coming they were coming from everywhere filling that place that could that only had we only had a um what you call it we are only allowed by theity to have 12 people in there but it was filled filled always filled up and the spirit of God was moving well of course they said oh you guys are all Pentecostals oh my goodness what is this going on how can you leave the messaging and then another day after the preaching of the word that same brother will come back and say oh man Brothers you brothers are so full of the word I don't understand uh my God is something else I said brother why don't you make up your mind we full of the word or full of the spirit or which which one is it but you don't understand the word works with the spirit the White Horse is the word and the rider is the holy spirit he rides on the word and comes to us praise the name of the Lord so again we see the separation time that was in in the wilderness we see it here now in the book of Acts because the the Holy Ghost made a difference and without doing anything they were separated from anything that was not like him you know Judas went and hanged himself how many knows that Akil D the field of blood he hanged his own self and anybody that may they smart they're good people but you'll hang yourself after a while you're own life and your own actions and activity you're going to be left hanging right that way and you'll be doing it yourself now let's go to the Old Testament we find out here in J I'm going to move quickly now because we're almost uh to our time in Joshua 2224 uh praise the Lord you don't need to put it up now sister I'm just going to run through a few things here before we leave this is talking about giving you so you can write that down I'm not going to read out the scripture the the the tribe of Reuben after they had had the battles and they fought and defeated the enemy and they followed Joshua you know when Joshua was giving out the lands they they had a desire because Moses while Moses was alive to that tribe of Reuben he spoke to them that they could live on the side the Wilderness side of Jordan so you understand the Wilderness side of Jordan and the Canaan or Promised Land side of Jordan right so when the battle was over instead of them staying in the promised land with Joshua and the others they said oh no we listening to the message of Moses and we going back and we going to live on that side back in the wilderness side they decide to go back you can read the whole chapter when you have the time right so what I'm saying it was a natural separation Joshua didn't chase them out Joshua didn't send them back Joshua didn't tell them anything they decided this is not for me I prefer and they even set up their own altar in their own way and Israel wanted to go fight with them and then Joshua said no no no leave them they want to do that leave them alone and um they just let them go so that separation is here now it's happening right now and so um we see that's going on as we speak now then we go Jesus now we come to Jesus and he said you know the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who threw a net in the sea right do you know the prophet calls the message like a big net and that he would throw the net out he says but when the net comes in he says quoting here uh this is in um is that scripture I think it's in Matthew anyway Matthew 1347 to 51 just so you can study it when you go home uh see you have that he said the scavenger fish the prophet says man brings the net in and he brings in scavengers right Turtles crawfish fish is in there too and then uh other he says snakes spiders crabs all coming in the same net right praise God my goodness of course we know that um um that he's speaking of Believers those Spirits are around people right praise the Lord praise God and so the time has come now he said when The Messengers the angels are going to start separating separating finding the fish right and those ones can go back in the sea if they want to but they got to keep those fish for the glory of God read the scripture and you can go through that yourself Hallelujah now I'm going to bring this thought where the brother brandom is speaking about the Kent Vision when he said I was standing in the Sun and I I preached the word and came to a climax and wanted to go to another Climax by the time he finish the second pull people start uh walking away because when the seven seal was open there was nothing in it in the sense so that your eyes could see you can read it over a thousand times and it doesn't say anything in there like the other ones tell you this this this that uh and it don't know what opening on the seven seal what was there because it's something Supernatural came out of the seals it was the coming of the Lord the coming of the Lord to his bride coming as a thief in the night coming to his bride to get her out of here and he never understood that praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so we see therefore that Jesus spoke about that separation coming but the preachers The Messengers The Angels will do that by the preaching of the word they're not going to deliberately go out there preaching to uh no they just preach the word and the word is going to allow that to happen praise God next brother brandom speaking about uh that's the 10th Vision about the people walking away from him before he could get to his climax because they felt natural hunger they got to they got to make money they got to have a job they got to eat they got to wear he says you know they had natural longer he says but for biscuits rather than this Rich word that they're receiving they rather to go find biscuits and he tried he said he tried to call out to say no don't go stay I am coming to my climax this is the word of God it's it's being Vindicated stay with the word amen nevertheless they went out he says but you know I wa I stood there because I knew a small group will come back when the evening Shadows Fall evening time when the Shadows Fall there's a small group coming back that they're going to hear the rest of that message when it hits this Climax and I believe that it's hitting the climax right now praise God hallelujah because when they came back and and the people start asking where where is the prophet where's the prophet praise God hallelujah he said oh he's resting praise God well I don't have to explain that the prophet is resting right now am praise the Lord and in that time that little group that comes back goes into his climax praise God and that's the group praise God I'm talking about they're separated by the word itself praise God hallelujah Now quickly closing now amen in you remember he spoke about the preview of the church how many many talks about those young ladies that were marching and they were marching to the sound of the music you can find that I'm going to give you I got these Pages here but this you know not going to go through all of that just going to give you words choosing of a bride and it starts paragraph 198 to paragraph 214 you have all weak to be able to look at these things oh my goodness see so they were marching he says on one group when they're marching looking so Grand as they went past but the other group were so filthy amen filthy dressed and filthy how they're walking and twisting and moving themselves like that and then he ends up by saying and these started marching one One Step Up they marched right up into the skies and then they went to marching amen and other ones they marched too to the they March to the edge of the cliff but instead of going up they went down amen praise God hallelujah oh my and one of them that was marching tried to look look back some foreign girl either this or that he mentioned a few countries here and he said and I woke up saying don't do that don't do that don't get out of Step Hallelujah I screamed like that and woke up with my hand out like that hallelujah oh my praise God my friends I want to ask you is it later than we think could she already be called Chosen and sealed away there were won't be one extra one in that you know could it be possible oh yes oh yes praise the Lord hallelujah so I believe the time is now when the bride is going to start coming out of the shadows out of the kitchen where she was with all the pots and pants and them old cousins making a mockery of her she's coming out of the Shadows now God is going to bring her into public view praise the name of the Lord and um he's going to and she's coming with the same sound of the same uh if you want to call it music amen as they had in the first church age when they March P she's coming back now with the same sound of the same music amen praise God and not only that she's keeping ranks right coule brother Braham said one of them looked back and starting to misstep and he said no don't do that keep in step Hallelujah so we got to keep ranks we got to stay disciplined with the word and move with the same sound of the music amen praise the Lord hallelujah keeping step with the message and knowing the Rhythm and changes of the word like the men of isachar the tribe of isachar men the Bible say men who knew the times and the seasons when Israel how they should go out when they should come in when they should turn this way or that way these men were given inspiration that tribe to tell the leaders elders of Israel this or that or the other praise God hallelujah I want you to notice that both groups thought they were going into heaven both groups thought they were going in the rapture and both groups walk to the edge of the cliff confident that they're going in the Rapture but when one group steep down step out they went down and the other group went up so you see brother brandham said after you caught in the Rapture there's a lot of people going to still be preaching what do you think they're going to be preaching it's this message and they going to be preaching about the Rapture and wake up to realize the Rapture is gone how could it be gone wasn't this supposed to happen that supposed to it's already happened but it happened so simply that you didn't know it right you didn't recognize what was going on it's all look look took place finished gone already closing with this thought of the deep call to the Deep that's the last quotation he says now friends when our life here on this Earth is over and our last prayer and all our battles are all done all the smoke is dried up gone away all the arms are now stacked the bibles are now closed and we come to your house Lord that great morning breaks Eternal bright and fair when the chosen ones Shall Gather to their home beyond the skies the poet said Lord as we see the great table stretched out there for that supper thousands of miles long looking across the table at each other battles scarred veterans tears of joy running down their cheeks the king comes out in his beauty of Holiness walks along the table take his own hands and wipe the tears from our eyes saying don't cry no more it's all over enter into the joys of the Lord Friends toils of the road as the musicians come of will then seem as nothing when we get to the end of the way praise the Lord may God bless your hearts today if there any that's not baptize be sure to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ speak to one of the elders amen and that God will use you and that God will grant you the baptism the Holy Ghost as the prophet said the baptism Holy Ghost in This day without sensation amen praise God hallelujah let the Holy Spirit have his way in your life let him show you that you have a different Spirit on you no matter what your family says what your relative says your workmates say you stay with the word of the Living God we are not here for recognition we are not here to be seen to be known to build up look all those things you know when I think about it studying all those kinds of things how to promote yourself they even have all those things how to actually promote your ministry how to promote yourself how to do this how to do that and then come to a place where he said drop all of that Lord Jesus I'm in your hands just use us for his glory For Your Glory take all the honor the glory and the praise so you you want to say oh brother Simon doesn't know what he's talking about he's a dummy he doesn't know this well that's fine I don't need to know anything all I need to know is him amen right and if he can flow through me you praise God then he can do a great work do you believe that you know there's great work to be done here you know there's a great work to be done here you know the whole of Burlington doesn't know what you know only a few people praise God wherever you're living the people don't know about the prophet they don't know about the water baptism they don't know about the one God and his name is Jesus Christ they're still worshiping uh um a paganism paganism the devil got you quiet down and say oh they're going to church no you understand they're pagans pagans to what we have got from this message from this Prophet paganism versus true Christianity the revelation of Jesus Christ over to you brother brother Danny Pastor Danny God bless you come on God God bless you Pastor Simon amen what a wonderful message praise God Saints listen
