God bless you Saints it's good to be once again at another another Crossroads praise God every time we we cross into a new year we're leaving the past in the past by the grace of God like the scripture says leaving those old things behind and looking forward to the new things that are coming forth and for us as Sons and Daughters of God it's all about the word of God and the uh the the word in its season and I know that 2022 has been just a a tremendous year of Revelation that's been uh given to the Sons and Daughters of God and the responsibility of that Revelation to live the word and to allow it to interpret itself because as we've been hearing over the last year God is his own interpreter and he's here now on the scene interpreting his own word and uh he's by his grace using each and every one of us as the attributes of God you know it's a wonderful thing when you think about it as an attribute you were always in God and everything that he overcame when he came here you already overcame the victory was given and we can live a Victorious free like never before we are the freest people on this planet and we should be living that way we should be feeling and experiencing that revelation of the liberty of the Sons and Daughters of God coming into full manifestation you know um 2022 was uh was a an amazing year um personally um you know in in many ways a lot of ups and a lot of downs um each and every one of us uh have to deal with the Paradox of Being Human and being a son of God and God has uh you know gifted and placed certain characteristics in each and every one of us to manifest and those characteristics that he's placed there they're going to get tested they're going to be tested for the real character of Christ to see how you respond how you react you know to certain situations and circumstances and God is watching those things he's he's mindful of those things you know I had an experience this year um as a human uh you know I was I was unloading things out of my vehicle in my underground there and I pull my vehicle up to the door and um you know I unload all my stuff but if somebody happens to come in behind me then uh I you know I asked them oh I'm finished can you just back up about you know 30 40 feet and allow me to just back my truck into my spot and you know I've done it like countless number of times and every single neighbor has been oh yeah no problem Dan they back it up you know I back my truck in thank you well just so happened you know I went nicely over to the neighbor and I said hey you know sorry I just finished unloading with you back up please you know and he looked at me and he says no and and uh and you know as a human right I thought oh I said well that's not neighborly you know and and like I reacted in a certain way and I called him a and every single time that I've ever asked anybody they've always moved and you you kind of expect that to happen but you know and right up until the moment that I had done it and everything else I felt that was fine and everything you know and I just went I said okay fine I pulled my truck because I had to go up all the way up back up to Brandt Street turn around and come back in and let him go by but uh anyways you know a few days go by right and every time I drive out I'd see his vehicle and the Lord started to talk to me and he said that guy had every right to say no he had every right he you were in the wrong just because 98 of the people that you asked were kind enough to do it it doesn't mean that you know and it was like it was strange and I felt so bad and I thought oh man I gotta I gotta make that right and you know it's funny because today my wife and I were sent were talking about you know things and saying you know you know like what do you think about 2022 and we were just talking about it and you know what would you see change in 2023 and we were talking about those things and what kind of things would you like to leave behind and everything else this thought about this guy that wasn't even in my mind but anyways um I said Jen you know what after we finished talking I said I'm going to go for a nice walk before dinner feel more Justified to really have a good meal and so I went for a long walk but as I walked out the door and I'm walking out there he is I said hey neighbor and he looked over he goes hey I go listen I just want to make something right that was absolutely wrong what I said and what I did that time and I apologize and I you know I'm asking you to forgive me oh come on man no problem no problem you know and we we touched and I said I just you know this is a great way to end the year I said to him and it felt so good and I said Lord you never forget and I so appreciated that little thing and because the timing of it was like it had to be God I want to go for a walk and there he is you know what I mean so anyways praise God um those are the little things that God you know wants to you know it sounds like really simple but you know we're human uh we're going to make mistakes but the blood of Christ justifies us as though we never done it in the first place and we just keep walking we just keep walking amen so I sing this song here um very simple because in every situation there was Jesus amen praise God [Music] every time I try to make it on my own [Music] every time I try to stand I start to fall and all those lonely roads that I have traveled on there was Jesus Jesus [Music] when the life I build Came Crashing to the ground when the friends I had were nowhere to be found I couldn't see it then but I can't see it now there was Jesus [Music] in the waiting in the searching in the healing and hurting like a blessing buried in the broken pieces every man every

around all you Hallelujah [Music] glory to God you know I was listening to brother dany's testimony there and one of the scriptures that came to me this week it was it said I let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable and pleasing in your sight and I thought about that scripture and that's one of the things I mean not make it a resolution but it's more of Lord sometimes things might come out of my mouth external you know you want God to help you to be better you know like that person that that road rage or somebody at work might say something and you might say something back or or the internal part was what's he meditating on about Unity so they take my brother speak about it a confession and I add this confession of my my mouth I wanted things that is right to come out of my mouth Lord for this year and whatever I meditate on is the right things you know sometimes we find ourselves you know thinking about all the problems we have but he wants us to be acceptable what we meditate is not be acceptable unto him so everybody Mike is going to come and give us a testimony and you may be seated well praise the Lord testimonies are a great thing none of us have one except that Lord give us give us a testimony right so and uh even even just a few minutes ago I was sitting there and Satan was just all just battering at me saying don't give that testimony don't give that testimony don't give that testimony like that and I was thinking how am I going to get out of this how am I going to get out of this seriously and then the next thing I hear is I know the master of the Wind that's what this testimony is all about you'll see so uh brother Brandon said that he was a typologist and he also said that God himself is a typologist so it behooves us I think we should be typologists as well right not fanatics but see the types in the shadows and everything like that and as I'm going through this um just uh you know you'll see the types and shadows and where we're at this is not a 2022 kind of testimony it's uh it happened last week and the Lord really laid it on my heart to speak it because you know to me it was it was a tremendous thing and uh it's it's been with me every day since waking up in the morning thinking seen it and you know just sweeping and crying and saying thank you Lord um last week going on going into Christmas we always go up to sister Elaine's parents place and and spend Christmas there in Quebec and we heard about how many heard about the the oncoming storm the one that was a generational storm that was a a storm of this Century or whatever you wanted to call the thing and uh it was coming and it was going to hit on the Friday and that was the the day before uh Christmas Eve and her their celebration is always on Christmas Eve on the 24th and we we always try to be there for the 24th we all we've always been there for the 24th and and and uh had a dinner with their family and whatnot but um her mom just had an operation uh a minor operation that went very well and and uh I had to work on Friday and Michelle and Madeline both had to work on Friday and so we sent sister Elaine and and my other daughter Sarah up on Thursday before the storm right and and they left on Thursday and they went up to go back and spend a little bit more time and uh got there safely everything was good and of course on Friday we had the rain and we had the um flash freezing and we've had the snow and you you went through it right and it was a big event and they actually closed the the schools on Friday um and both Michelle and I are educational workers so we we had the day off uh snow day as they say and it was great but but Madeline she had to uh she had a shift late at night at Subway and and she really couldn't turn it down because um she hadn't been working because of the her exams and everything so she had to she had to go into work she worked at midnight Friday night so I said okay um we'll get up we'll go fry Saturday morning and we'll we'll head down to Quebec if everything is okay if the roads are okay and everything is all right because this thing was big on Friday and so I was checking the uh everything I could get on the internet and everything every time I put in the 401 um road conditions it would always come up for about the London you hear about the London accidents that took place in London Ontario well that's the other way okay Montreal is the other way and I could never get anything about between Toronto and Montreal about 401 conditions so I thought okay the storm went through on on on Friday and um we're going on Saturday and we'll see what it's like Saturday morning so I got up Saturday morning looked at the window five o'clock in the morning nothing had changed since the night before everything was peaceful calm quiet I said okay girls let's go we'll we'll head out um we left at 705. a little bit of Grace in there and we needed it believe me um and we got across Toronto in record time it seemed like nobody was on the road everybody was saying opting out but the roads were perfect Toronto was fantastic we got on the other side and I called my son Ben because he was coming up uh two hours later he was leaving at nine and he was going to be coming up with his fiancee and uh called him up and I said Ben I said man we made it across Toronto record time everything's good everything's fantastic he goes okay Dad we're getting ready to leave too you know we'll be leaving at about nine o'clock I said all right you know give me a call and I'll let you know of any any problems come up or whatever happens I said all right so but before we left um the Lord was kind of really dealing with my heart because I was getting kind of nervous about this thing I've been in I've driven in bad bad conditions before but uh anyway so I I said okay uh so before we left we prayed and I knew that I had to speak a word it wasn't something that is just off the top of your head no it was something that was impressed upon me and I said let there be blue skies and sunshine along the way in the name of the Lord let it be like that and the girl said amen and looked at me because everything was gray and everything but anyway so we left we got we got into um Port Hope which is on the other side of Toronto and when we did the road conditions began to change we lost one lane became snowy but it still it wasn't bad it's okay we lost one lane and we started driving like that and but as we were driving we started to see what was happening the day before I mean we saw a car you know if you if you go down the highway on one lane like that and then there's an off ramp and there's a guard rail that comes on an angle and comes like a little little angle like that there was a vehicle that was on top of the guardrail setting about this High I said how did that get there and not only that but what is it still doing there and how did those people get out of there so we started to see signs of of of tribulation trouble was on the horizon I mean it's a you know I may remember the Twilight Zone it was like the Twilight Zone and anyway you started moving like that and then of course you saw vehicles in the ditch over here all from yesterday's storm and we thought okay as we drove a little bit further we uh we came to a town called kohlberg and Coburg is is the place where we always stop it has two uh off-ramps exits to Coburg one first one and the second one I know the 401 between Toronto Montreal like the back of my hand um we always get off at the second one it has a Tim Hortons it has gas stations has everything we need so I said okay we're going to get off at the second one we're going to look for kohlberg the only problem is the storm got worse and worse and the wind started to pick up it was going like 100 kilometers an hour it was we were we started to go about 20 kilometers an hour um and I I said okay we're going to get off at the second exit the only problem was we went past the first exit so I thought the second exit was the first exit because we didn't even see the first exit because you couldn't see the first exit because the wind was blowing like that I said okay number one phone bin we phoned up man we said Ben and caught him he was sitting in his car getting ready to pull I said forget it I wouldn't have my worst enemy come into this disaster right and uh so he said okay dad we'll come tomorrow so doctor said you do that so we went past kohlberg we missed we missed getting off the highway and we started seeing signs those construction signs that they put on on the side of the highway Kaplan it said 401 it's closed the next one 401 is closed and I was thinking okay obviously it's not closed I'm driving on it what does it mean 401 is closed and I thought maybe somewhere down the road they've closed the highway and I'm going to have to get off and go around and come back on or something like that anyway so we're going along like that in in this the snow was blowing the wind was uh fierce we all had our hazards on for the rest of the trip the hazards were going to Blink they're blinking and I was following the car in front of me and uh you would call it White Knuckle driving except for for one thing is for me I for some reason I just was not what didn't have no White Knuckles I didn't have no no pressure at all I was just driving and thinking okay this is really something um they have on the highway as I'm sure you know they have those on route gas stations we're in Tim Hortons and all that stuff you can it's it's on the highway you can get off and get right back on and one came up so we got off at this on route because we wanted we hadn't eaten anything or and uh inside when we walked inside there were hundreds of people and they're all setting down in in the in in the seating area and everything like that I thought that's pretty strange we went to the washroom and then passed your Simon calls but am I did you end up going I said yeah we're in the middle of it right now I was so glad to to know that uh you've said well have a good trip and everything like that and and I said okay thanks I was on his mind and I was glad for that we went to the Tim Hortons in the en route they didn't have any food and uh said you don't have any food what's going on here all they had and it was in the store across the way was was just a few chocolate bars and stuff like that and we realized and and the employees said they'd been there for 30 hours you hadn't gone home all those people were people who got off the highway and we're set staying put and they've been there for a day and I looked at that and I I just said that ain't me I'm not sitting here I can tell you that much so I just said come on girls you're ready to go they go yeah we're ready to go so we got in the car and we we started going again and this time we got on on the highway and uh started going to Kingston and and Elaine was in in Montreal and and they were having the dinner that night and and we were in contact she was asking us how it was going and she's and we started telling her and it got to the place where she was phoning us every half an hour because you know where she was there was nothing going on but there was a blizzard in her in her heart because she knew that we were in that far from going off the road at any particular time and it just got worse and worse so she was calling us and and giving us Alternatives and saying the road conditions in Quebec are good and uh and and so on and so forth and then Sarah started calling and and it was just like we could see that the concern was getting greater on their site so they informed the family and everybody about uh what was uh happening that we may not make it for dinner I didn't think we were going to make it for dinner and and but I was so glad that uh those that had gone on before us started getting desperate and Elaine and Sarah and they were um because then without us cannot be made perfect you know that huh and uh they were getting desperate in all eyes for those who've gone on before on us watching us as we went down the highway um but for me all I could hear was Press On Press On keep on going through the storm anyway uh I believe the focus in heaven is on this little bride right now and uh what's happening right here and right now no wonder there's silence in heaven you know who's here right all right so we were following the car ahead of us and his lights were he had his hazards on and all I could see was the car in front of me and the car behind me it's all I could see you couldn't see beyond anything else and then we passed through uh um they're going about 30 kilometers an hour and all of a sudden we passed through a stretch of highway where there was like nine or ten cars there were cars in the ditches all over the place that goes without saying but these cars were all spun out on the highway and we just drove through I knew we couldn't touch our brakes because it would have been sheer ice we would have been all over the place and people were getting out of their cars and it was quite again surreal it was It was kind of unbelievable and here we were just moving through don't touch your brakes because they're all you're going to join them and uh and just looking at these people getting out of the cars in in disaster and everything happening and off we went next thing I know a trailer a tractor trailer zoomed past us missed us by about that much I don't know where the guy came from I don't know where he went because we didn't see him we saw him when he was right beside me like that I don't know how he got through that situation but he did um so as we left that scene that's what happened and and just to to show you the next day I just wanted to show you what a um that the warning came out I read this the next day a little bit too late but it said there's going to be a crippling blizzard conditions we'll be continuing this until this evening travel will be extremely difficult and impossible at times impossible and is not advised this includes Highway 401 near Kingston to Cornwall it's exactly where we were blizzard conditions with wind gusts of 80 to 100 kilometers an hour in snowfall amounts of 20 to 30 centimeters and all this and here we were worried about I didn't realize that this storm had had stopped over Kingston and it was just battering it all between between and here we were in the middle of it um we are approaching Kingston and the lanes went from two to three lanes that's what happened they give an extra Lane there because of it's a busy place and uh everybody was had gotten off the highway except us we were the only car for half an hour I did not see another vehicle on the 401 if you can believe that um for me I was a little bit of a boon because I had three lanes I had no other cars I said okay I'm going to pick it up a little bit and we did and Michelle said to me at that point she says hey Dad you want to listen to some music yeah and she put on a a song service from a church down in Phoenix and uh from one of their services and and the first song was something keeps holding me and as I began to play the Lord the Lord just came and started dealing with my heart and made it all soft and everything like that and I I was sitting there wiping tears away something keeps holding me here we are in the middle of a crazy storm and wind gusts and everything and then they went through the song service and then the pastor came out and he wasn't preaching that day but he came to introduce the guy who was the brother who was preaching who I happen to know and hadn't heard of in two three years and uh he's from Ireland and I I stayed with his parents in Ireland anyway I was amazed that he that he was preaching but anyway um the pastor come out and he said this he made a few comments and then he said uh foreign let's sing a a song that I love so much I know the master of the Wind because he says I'm quoting him okay because I realize there are times when storms and tempests are going to come your way not everything is going to be easy sailing you're going to go through some good times and bad times but Jesus said lo I will be with you always and then they said I know the master of the wind I know the maker of the rain he can calm a storm and make the Sun shine again and I looked at Michelle and she looked at me and we smiled and it was like we were in a bubble everything going crazy outside and we were there we were just presence of God just beautiful and Madeline was in the back sleeping rest little bride rest for all is well so you know you begin to notice these things you say what is going on here and that word was so perfectly uh in season for us in our spirit's sword when we heard that and say those words and they started singing Master of the wind and it seemed like we were it was just it was beautiful in the middle of that storm but anyway we pressed on and and uh we were going for a town called Brockville Brockville is about three quarters of the way to Montreal going 20 kilometers an hour 30 kilometers an hour and we we uh we we got off in in Brockville and then that's when I realized how what they meant by so uh when we got off of that off off ramp they had closed all the on-ramps so we could not get back on the 401. so now I understand the sign sometimes you can't interpret a sign until you actually experience it and we got off there we said well the only other way to go is along Highway too is Highway 2 is the little highways it's it runs right along the St Lawrence River um you do not want to be in a blizzard driving along the St Lawrence River right because the wind's coming off there it was so bad you would drive and have to actually stop because of the it would be a whiteout condition you got to stop wait till it dies down and start driving again because you couldn't see from here to the microphone and uh and that's what we were in I said we're going along Highway 2. and through Highway 2 there was a lot of small towns this is Christmas eve two o'clock in the afternoon downtown small town and every store was closed they had locked up it looked like it was the apocalypse it looked like it was all everything was finished the busiest day of the year for stores I'm sure um we found a Tim Hortons and and that was closing and we managed to get a muffin off of them they had everything packed away he managed to get out before they they shut down went on our way again and um before everywhere we went with the 401 was closed closed closed closed till finally we we as I was driving I saw an opp officer sitting on the side of the road I pulled up beside I said listen I said we got to get back on the 401 because you know this is we got to make Quebec and he's if she said uh she said I said is the 401 open she says I don't know it's conflicting reports here's the authority that she didn't even know whether the highway was open or not and I know we get a lot of conflicting things about is the word open or not it's open um but she said maybe you just better stick on Highway 2 until you get to lanecaster maybe that'll be safer I said okay so we left there and Lancaster was like 50 kilometers away he was now approaching four o'clock and I said oh my goodness if it starts getting dark in this thing we are it's going to compound the problems right so it's four o'clock and we're driving slowly down Highway 2 which is called the King's Highway and something just said look up and if I looked before me it was nothing but gray and stormy if I looked my rear view is gray and stormy left and right gray and stormy but said look up no in order for me to look up I I had to go like this and look up because the the roof came over like that and when I did I thought I saw blue sky I sat back I looked again I said Michelle look up and she looked down she was Dad that's blue sky up there and sure enough at four o'clock in the afternoon in the midst of the storm everywhere there was a patch of blue sky that was right above us and the Sun was shining and a plane was flying through it you could see the sun glistening up she said Madeleine wake up look up there that's what that spoke from the very beginning his blue sky and sunshine and that patch of Blue Sky never went before us it never went after us it never went to the left or the right it just stayed there the whole time until 4 30. for half an hour or about the space of half an hour and I said Lord what can I say you are you're you are wonderful and we ended up getting to Lancaster safely by the grace of God went on to Quebec when we walked into his brother's uh her brother's uh home we knocked on the door and and they opened the door and spontaneously they told me afterwards they all started clapping and because they were really concerned and they all started clapping and gave us a hero's welcome and they welcomed us then a few minutes later brother Desmond I was sitting at a table with a Christmas dinner sitting in front of me and I sat there and I said oh God it's from beginning to end it's an oncoming storm but one day we're going to sit at a table and we're going to eat a fruit praise God but the main thing is I hope you're hearing those voices keep pressing on praise God and this is the hour where the spoken word is with us let God interpret that that one for you God bless you that's my testimony amen I know the master of the start for a minute I know [Applause] [Music] the sun shine again [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] so every year there's I was told this is my first New Year's service and every year I was told that there is a testimony of someone coming to the Lord and um today is my turn to sort of give my testimony but my testimony will be a little bit different because it is I was at the age of five my parents came to the Lord but then I didn't really have an understanding of who this God really was so I had paxland and came back to the Lord so bear with me as I go through my little testimony here so I was born in Trinidad and Tobago to two parents um Betty and Anthony John around 1975 they accepted the message of the hour um message and they came to the Lord um around that time 1975 1976 I was a young young man then but I remembered there was so much talk of um brother but Abraham had predicted but they were saying that Jesus was coming in 1977. so around that time there was so much um okay we got to take the kids out of school we don't need school we don't need work we don't need jobs we we we gotta that's homeschool them and whatever to you know to keep them away from this world and and with that Looking Back Now there was a lot of legalism you know going on where people were kind of you know like we basically um they put us in a in the back of the church and we just read the Bible to us all day we didn't need school right there's no need for school there's no need for education um you know a lot of weapon a lot of beating um spirited right to spoiler child right so it was a time where you were kind of like okay um what is really happening um around in the early 80s now my parents now was they were hearing about brother Coleman and you know the seven Thunders so they decided okay well where they were fellowship and at the time it wasn't a place where they felt that it wasn't getting a full understanding of the word so they they decided to move on to another church I wouldn't name any any any anybody I'll just kind of say that and um so growing up we were encouraged to read the Bible we were encouraged to you know to pray and with that there was definitely a love for God growing in our hearts as young as young men and young my young sisters um my father didn't just talk about the Lord he lived a life and I say that because um I I remembered there were times when I was a young person and I reflected on this last and as you know you realize how they sacrifice you were making as a young person but at the time I didn't understand it so where we were going to church we were going to church like in close to like a place called Barataria and but of course you know where Toco is so Toko is probably three hours away from there service will be done at 10 30 and my father in a station wagon with about seven kids um pack us all up like sardine in the back and then we will have to drop three or four people in Toco so by the time we go to drop them in Toko um I'm probably coming back home probably four in the morning you know you have to go have to go to school my father had to get to work but it wasn't something that he was like you know what these Saints needs are left he needs to do it so he's he's taking them so but not only growing up around that I grew up around the supernatural a lot and I say that because I didn't realize until a later in my life what the environment was for instance you know my father was considered a man of faith and everybody would know who's and he said you say brother Johnny Brother John man with feet and there was so much experience was happening that led to that sort of a label on him um one of them I remembered as a young child we were coming from service one night from church one night and there was a an accident a car came in our lane hit our car and my mom pitched out of the window um the door it always closed I don't know how she got out there my little brother was in her in her arms um my father driving my brother a big cut along his eyes for me I just blacked out just saw stars but my father's feet was pinned between the clutch and the accelerator and both feet broke just broke up because it was after the car was written off you you there was amazing to see how we lived through that because it was just the car was just demolished So Gone to the hospital my father my mom is in hospital my dad's in hospital and the doctor says tell them listen Mr John we have to try to put a pin in your feet because if we don't you're never going to walk again and this man being a fate said to doctor doc there's nothing going into my feet God is going to heal my foot and well anyway we a couple days we were supposed to see a specialist he was supposed to see a specialist this doctor was supposed to come in and say you know um okay how are we going to do this surgery on the night before this doctor was supposed to come my father tell us a story that he prayed he asked God he said Lord before the doctor lays hands on my foot I want your hand to touch my foot and heal my foot so the day come and the doctor is doing the the extra on his feet and my father said he stops and he says Mr John why did you put your hand there he says I never put my hand here but no let me back up a little bit the night prior to that my father is there and he says about midnight he feels like somebody's massaging his foot so he's he turns to the guy about in in the hallways did you touch my funny guys no I'm I can't touch you for that I can't get up and he is on his bed I can't touch your foot so he felt this hand touching his foot and lo and behold the morning when they did this x-ray they see our hand with flesh on his feet and they're amazed because there's no broken bones my father foot is completely healed right so I I I I still tell my brother I said what did we do with that extra because it was all over Trend that everybody saw this physical hand with with flesh on it when you take an extra it gets you get bone this is flesh on my father's hand not a broken bone in my father's foot the doctors in them they don't know they're just looking around it's like you don't know what happened here so as stuff like that was happening and you know you're being around the supernatural I remember another time when my mom having my my sister um she had something called uh placenta previa where the placenta is blocking where the uterus something new uterus and is blocking where the baby is supposed to come out and full some people are partial she was full and um the doctor said listen we gotta cut her open and my father there I go again he says God is going to heal us and lo behold the day before this they were supposed to cut her open they said it's gone so you see a lot of these things I was growing up around so I was seeing the supernatural but taken not taking heed of what was happening but I understood I always had the desire to love the Lord but it was just that thing where you have that will push you say okay this is your experience you're seeing these things and put it into together to where you can have a relationship with the Lord um around 18 years old I moved to in my grandparents and it was partly to help because my father had gotten really sick diabetic and I decided to work after school to try to help the family just to you know put make ends meet and stuff like that and around that time a lot of the kids around the church now started exiting because you know over the years a lot of the legalism a lot of the people would see on the streets and they'll condemn you and it was always a battle with the brothers and so I said you know one of the things okay I need to get out of here so started making my plans to move to Canada finally in 1990 I moved to Canada and um say Lord I I'm like I'm getting away from these church people I love the Lord but it's just the just the whole thing around it was just so much a battle I came to Canada and my first job the real job I got was in 1992. um God placed me 600 6 360 kilometers away from Trinidad in a company called Campbell Soup where three Believers is is working there what's your chances of that happening three Believers with a mic brother Paul and brother Mark I can't run [Laughter] so I remember the scene but I'm like I don't know what year it was I was working 92 but I remember seeing a bit of Mike and reading a spoken word book I said hey you better break you believe but Brian was a prophet and he goes yeah you got it all excited like you said somebody you want to start appreciate the word too and I said to him yes I do and I walked away and I said I gotta stay away from that man foreign because one of the things that I I I knew is that um the word was true the message was real and I didn't want him to tell me about The Mercy Seat the mercies is done the doors are closed I didn't want to hear that I have to have fun so I stayed away from brother Mike but in 2002 um my father-in-law got stricken with cancer um prostate cancer and took him to some chemotherapy and different things and for a little while he started to feel a lot better but around 2007 it just came back with a vengeance and he saw a deteriorating by 2008 2007 he was you know we knew that if the Lord didn't intercede around that time I started really talking to the Lord and quite quietly I would listen to messages and you know the Lord said kind of dealing with me because I was back and forth in the hospital with him I kind of wanted to do that because I felt like you know it was my way because I looking I'm looking at him and I you know wanted to pray for him but the devil said you can't pray for me look at your life you know look look look look look how you're living you know the truth he's gonna go to hell if he doesn't know God and all of these things is going through my head and I'm thinking Lord you know how can I help this man foreign late I think early 2008 I invited brother Mike to come over to the house where he was um you know whatever got laid on his hand to pray for him whatever um he brought along with a Chris and sister Shirley and sincerely stood up there and she gave her testimony and I tell you her testimony was just so moving you know she talked about her conversion from Muslim to Christianity and in the home it was everybody was in tears you know but a Michael but a Christian and they prayed for him but there was a piece that came over the home from that day on you know everybody it just seems like something took place it was like just a atmosphere there's change in the home because before it was just okay you know it's almost waiting you know for his his time you know watching my father-in-law go through all that stuff um it just drove me to pray pray more and and you know to see God's see God's face it's February 20 2008 um my uncle who was a very healthy man you know I was in communication with him like two days ago he was planning on coming to Canada to visit um he passed away that's February 2008. how to talk then in March my mom died April 2nd of the same year so in February March April second my daughter was born Janae and then on April 20th my father passed away so you see like in three months I lost three people and it was it was a very difficult thing because I think the one other thing is is greatest one is my father-in-law watching him deteriorate and have you ever see somebody you know go through that and as you see that and you're Desiring to help and there's more like the spiritual side here and in my soul to help him and I felt I was you know I wasn't able to help him um all that time you know I had I suffered a mental breakdown it was just too much I felt like this Darkness everywhere it was sadness and everywhere I turn like there's light here but it actually felt dark in my in my in my head and I believe that Lord passed me through that so I can I could have compassion for people who have gone through that before right um well that Sunday morning when my mom passed I got myself together and the church wasn't Walker's line and um came to church this Sunday that morning I came in late but Tim was praying and he he was saying in his prayer he says um he says God um this morning would you heal anybody suffering with mental illness this is the words I heard coming out of his mouth and at that time I just felt like you know what is this is my time so I asked God right in my chair I said Lord if you would heal me of this thing that I'm going through I would serve you I would doesn't matter what it took because I always wanted to come but I always thought about the friends I was going to lose um what is my wife gonna say um you know what am I gonna do you know it felt like all of these things was just stopping me from succeeding because I was putting all of these things before the Lord but that place I was in that dark place I didn't want to stay there it was hell so I a lot and so that that morning when I came and I asked her that I literally felt like somebody took a vacuum and just grabbed my head and just like was sucking all the darkness out of my head right in my seat right so all of a sudden I felt like I can see again you know there was light so I got all excited and I went home and I said to my wife I said hey honey you know I went to the church today and I got healed I told him my experience and you know what happened and it's all gone and and she looked at me and she says I hope you're gonna still go and see the psychiatrist because I had made an appointment to see his psychiatrist my wife is a psychologist so she knows all about mental illness so she's like I think he's going a little further now right so you know um I still I went to see him actually and um I sat in his chair and he took grab his pen he starts asking me about my life and you know I've abused and all this stuff and but I all I wanted to do is tell him how much I got healed and um in the end he just put his pen down and he said listen I've heard these stories before and I've seen this happen before but keep your file open if you want to come back and see me but he didn't have time for me because I kept talking about how much God healed me so he didn't want to hear too much about that everything [Applause] I so that's in a nutshell really is my testimony it's the struggles of not wanting to surrender and God knows that in my heart I always had a desire I loved the Lord but it was that point where he had to bring a a little bit of Rumble in my life to sort of bring me to that place where I cannot worry about all of these extra external things that I was so scared about the family what's this one going to say what's that gonna say because I knew to walk with God is a total different walk of just just joining Church you know it's a total separation I knew that and but when the Lord takes over and he comes and he deals with you I didn't care who left or who did what I just wanted to serve the Lord and my scripture I read Hebrews 20 10 20 and she says Let Us whole unswovenly to the hope we profess for he whose promise is faithful and I was telling him with Aquaria about you know I heard somebody describe this as you know you haven't played that game where you hold your friend Han and you swing around what are you guys you swing around like you're holding but you depend on that person to hold you because if they're not holding you you fall down that is how God is holding us you know he we he we can let go but he is still holding us right and I I thank God because if I didn't have a grounded fate for the things I went through and I I I don't talk about it and I can't talk but you can't tell because it's your trials and your intestines but if I didn't have something to hold me as brother Mike said something keeps holding me and I'm I'm grateful for the Lord you know up to my life you have to watch your life closely and as you go back and you look at the experience you realize the Lord was always there even you know times when I was partying coming from drunk in the highway driving home and you hear the voice of God's son this is not what I want for you you know I was about to hit somebody Dead on and I knew him with myself I had no strength in my feet to take my feet off the accelerator and to see just as the nick of time just as and I said okay this is it I'm done I'm done and then all of a sudden there's strength come in your feet and you your hand you feel your car is moving and it's God God took care of you you go back and you realize all those times he was there even when I was clubbing and partying and doing what he never let me go so I just want to give him thanks tonight I want to give him praise for his love and kindness his goodness throughout my whole life you have kept me and today you know we we look forward to a new year and and tonight I'm stepping on in faith because my wife is such a traditionalist These are times where you know Christmas and New Year's Eve These are times this is very special to the family and that's why over the years I've I've used wisdom but I just felt in my heart the Lord step out and Faith a little bit tonight and put on a bulletproof vest and go home and take some shots but you're gonna be okay right I just want to say thank you for listening to me and may you have a wonderful New Year [Applause] if it wasn't for the grace for the grace of God in my life where would I be today why would I have done in my life if it wasn't for the grace for the grace of God in my life [Music] it was not you sorry but only was Jesus [Music] [Music] oh I was so lost and blinded walking in the darkness alive [Music] [Applause] [Music] I be today what would I have done in my life every one of you yes brother you can put this on for me press that amen it's all working very well now thank God good to see you brother Billy good to see you sister Julie and good to see every one of you here in the house of the Lord may the Lord bless us tonight please be seated we are going to for this is not a tradition I I just want you to know that there's no scripture telling us that we have to do this on the last night of the year but we have been doing this uh for as long as we have had the church right so there is no scriptural command to do this okay but together we come to Worship the Lord we feel that it's the best way to start our year re-ending our year this way and we start in the New Year this way in the presence of the Living God hallelujah and may the Lord bless you uh here tonight we are going to have the word we're going to have the Lord's supper and the uh

praise God I think we have an exciting year ahead of us you see the pulpus passed away you understand the significance of that time for the Catholic Church to start coming now manifesting itself into preeminence and to go to another level we see that obviously happening so we look forward to a great year praise God hallelujah now let's turn in our scriptures foreign Matthew Chapter 2 verses 11 and 12. Matthew chapter 2 verses 11 and 12. are you happy to be here oh no you don't sound very happy oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah you won the lottery and you just said oh yeah no not I'm going to tell you now to go and buy lottery tickets but you know praise God I am happy I said I'm happy I'm here in the presence of God and I'm here to give him glory honor and praise amen praise the Lord you can call me a Pentecostal and the real one praise God hallelujah I mean Martin have been stamped and approved by the Living God I'm the real Pentecostal praise the Lord your Original Seed praise the Lord Matthew Chapter 2 verses 11 and 12. the wise men come by the grace of God the wise men had their interview with King Herod who knew nothing about the Stars the wise men knew nothing about the bright shining star they knew nothing about this great Mystic light but the wise man came to have their interview with him and being crafty and cunning having no Revelation he tells them after you got it come back and let me know how I can get it uh let me know where to go and worship him oh and the Bible tells us here as we read and uh when sorry it says here good gracious what's happening to me um okay and when and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod should not return to the king's Palace they departed into their own country another way they departed another way I'd like to call this let's turn aside let's just turn aside amen praise the Lord father we thank you for the reading of Thy Word and we ask that the Holy Spirit of the Living God will help us to turn aside and father may the great Holy Spirit Bear witness today word which we are now bringing to your people and that's the wise men were warned may we be warned and they are that we are living in darkness all around but by your predestinated will we have come to see a Mystic light we have caught the revelation of this last star this prophet's message of this hour we feel the vibrations of the Redeeming Grace of God flowing from it into our lives and we are so inspired we are so imbued father God we pray you bless every one here tonight and those that may be hearing my voice online may you bear witness to what is being said and receive all the praise the honor and the glory in Jesus name we ask it and everybody said hey praise God you're saying you approve before you heard what I said but anyway praise God that's your faith your confidence God bless you please be seated Hallelujah I want you to understand that these wise men even started on their Journey because they saw this bright shining star they saw this Mystic light and that caught their attention and caused them to turn away from whatever life that were living before whether there were intellectual men smart men wise man whatever they were doing that turned away from their former ways of living to follow this star that they saw in the sky I'm putting it to you tonight that if in your heart you know you have caught the revelation you have seen the light of God shining upon your life for this hour I pray that like them we will all turn aside and ask God to take us to the fullness of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so that turned aside and it turned away from what that turned away when they went to Herod we will not talk about the period between when they started to when they arrived but now their herod's palace they have had the interview with him they have told him that it's not just a message not just a star like that but we receive the revelation we came to understand that the scripture said that uh when the star of Jesse when you see the star we recognize that the king is on earth now the king is here and because we recognize that we want to go to him wherever he is we are wanting to go to him well I want to say by the grace of God I believe that I caught that Shining Light coming off of the word of God I've caught the light because God sent the Western Star to light up their spiritual universe that men and women who are wise could recognize this is not just an ordinary uh evangelist this is not just an ordinary teacher this is not just a religious man this is not someone trying to come with some religious scheme but our eyes have seen the glory of God manifestable life of our brother William Mary and Branham without a doubt we know that he is the seven messenger set by God from Heaven amen and it's striking me more and more as I walk with God and get closer to him amen praise God so they came to Herod amen and after they left heron seen the world may manifest to them and surrendered the gifts that they had to the word of God for that hour like you and me coming with the gene that was in us the seed of God which was given to us by grace of God predestinated in us not by our will but by his grace amen not by our wisdom our smartness but by his grace that we are saved here tonight amen glory to God I'm so thankful but my eyes have been opened I'm so thankful that our hearts have been opened to the fullness of the word of God now they come they had their interview they're going away Herod tells them come back and let me know where you found him oh my well thank God we have a third pole Revelation and refunds all you know and even though you have caught it you there is there is not set up in such a way that you can convey it to somebody else each one has to come individually each one has to recognize and that is the very Grace and choice of God being made manifest who is his and who is not his or who is a half but I've beg believer and who is a make-believer who is a True Believer God is doing all of that right now by his grace amen so after their great interview they went to uh where Jesus was they presented their gifts don't you want to do that that's not don't I want to do that since I've caught the fullness of this I want the life the gene the gift that is in me I place it in his hands for him to use it however he Wills amen I am no more my own I don't have my own thinking I don't have my own way I don't care about a parent's strange to anybody anywhere or even till you wore right in front of me amen I Just Surrender whatever this gift of life there is place within this life that he might glorify himself through it amen and break the chains of Satan wherever it may be found amen glory to God so after they have seen the word I know they are returning back to where they come from like us I believe after we have seen the word what are we here doing we are on our returning Journey going back from whence we came and we know we came from God we're going back to God Amen Hallelujah but going back to God is not just normal four they they expected and I'm sure Herod must have had his spies on the roadways on the various places going out to Jerusalem that he might know where they were going but these men were warned of God in a dream amen praise God and God warned them not to walk the way of the world don't go by the systems of the world don't go but the accepted way of the world don't go by the expected way of thinking of the world but go according to this word that God has given to us in this day and in this hour praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so they return once they came not by the acceptable acceptable ways of man not by the expected ways of man but by the word of God Hallelujah but thank God God always has a witness whichever age that we are in God has a witness God had a witness by in Abraham for God spoke to him and said come out from amongst your people leave them and go into a country where I have called you recognize no Bible was written there was no priest no pop no superintendents no man of that he just heard a voice he heard an Unwritten War he heart the spirit speaking to his heart and it caught his attention and he turned aside oh God is asking us tonight as this new year approaches to turn aside amen he said but I'm a Christian even as a Christian God is calling you up high up God is calling you into another dimension he's calling you to put board from more effort amen put yourself into the world pray some more than you ever prayed before read the Bible read the messages listen to them day and night let them consume your soul amen until you can break the power of Satan because that's right will act just like he did in this Bible amen all that happened with him in the Bible the bride is going to repeat it all Hallelujah and God is calling on us to recognize this and turn away from the blind everyday Church Life oh I'm going to church let me tell you when you start us you understand that going to church all is Supernatural you don't even know what's going to happen any night while you're in here you don't know what's going to happen any day when you come to church you don't know when the fire of God will fall you don't know when the light of God will make itself manifest you don't know when the supernatural will decide to come on the scene Hallelujah so we must come with expectation amen don't come with your with your church Unity back into you in other words you're saved and you and you walk away from that but you've been so long in that that you you soak in some of it and then you come in the house of God and you want to act the same way but no sir no brother no sister we are God's Jew drops we don't come to stay here we didn't come to fit in here we didn't come to conform here but we're going back by the pull of the sun back where we come from in the presence of the Living God hallelujah I'm on my way amen praise God if you don't want to go don't hinder me but I'm pressing on to Higher Ground Lord of God hallelujah amen yes he heard a voice cause them to turn aside no written bible just a voice in the just in the air he hears a voice oh my and uh most of us who of course would be scared no doubt he was scared but something in him let him know that that's not an evil voice is that the comforting from that voice something warm coming from that voice and he listened to the voice and that voice God telling him come out from your own people come out and go to a land Canaan that where I have called you and the Bible says us says that he not even without the question obeyed the voice of God hallelujah amen so what he turned aside in attracted by a voice have you been attracted by a voice in this day have you been attracted by a voice in this hour let me tell you even now even though I've heard that voice thousands and thousands of times there is no voice like that voice there is not a spirit upon any man in this hour like that voice that came through that man Hallelujah because it's the voice of God to us in this last day amen oh it caused me to turn aside uh oh our brothers the first time I heard it I was still in the bible college and hearing that voice right away I said that man is a real servant of God and he's saying thus yet the Lord that means he's got to be a prophet oh my I I'm telling you of course it tumbled and turned everything that was inside of me upside down as I began to read those books what I'm saying is Brothers No matter that we are believers now let us turn aside even from The Limited among the of knowledge or wisdom that we think we have and cry out to God we consecrate ourselves to God and ask God take me higher take me deeper whiten my my wisdom in you Lord Use Me For Your Glory father amen I'm not here just to receive the supernatural knowledge but I'm here to manifest it for the glory of God and you must be here for the same purpose amen not to talk about it but let's leave it praise God let's make it manifest for the glory of God amen we don't we're not here to force it we're not here to prove it because truth is stated truth you don't have to prove it but you're making yourself yield and surrendered and available that God could use you you say oh brother Simon you're preaching to to all these dedicated ministers in here and brothers that we have thank God for every one of them but no it's not like that I'm talking to every young woman in here I'm talking to every young man in here I'm talking to every person in here I'm talking to every child in here amen because God came to me when I was just 12. amen whoever come forth by 14 and preaching ever since for the glory of God hallelujah amen the spirit of God is still here and he can still do the same things here today for his glory and praise amen Lord of God Amen yes sir and that caused Abraham to turn aside what turn aside from his idolatry you might be a message believer but a lot of us still got Idols in this message and God don't want you to have no Idol in front of your face amen amen break your Idols cast them away from you and press on into the presence of almighty God hallelujah amen get away from all idolatry and I tell you the Bible says he journeyed and he met those Canaanites as he's journeying well these things just speak to us that God says keep on your journey you're not in Canaan yet you got to pass through the land of the Canaanites who are on your on your course of your journey and we are passing through those Canaanite lands we are passing through enemy territories we are passing through Darkness Hallelujah but that is not where we are headed we are heading through the darkness into the Perfection of the light of God within our lives hallelujah amen Journey take your life this past year no doubt many of us face opposition and now many of us face obstacles in our lives in our work in our walk we face that amen every way that we face it but despite all of that God is saying you're young press on Don't let them you haven't reached your goal yet amen praise God oh my and so we have got to Journey we have got to Journey until we go to the promised land for the Bible says and so Abraham journeyed going towards the South amen hallelujah and that's where we are journey into we are going towards the South at the rising of the sun Hallelujah and what happens look all you know you always got some Johnny crows a farmer caught you know the story a farmer caught this crow that was wounded fixed him up and then he made him into some kind of a pet church member and tied him to the uh to the uh barn door or the post or something and when it became you know starts becoming winter and if you don't know it it's becoming winter in this

moving from his original position on the post you see but God is saying that we have got to not let this stop us regardless of who you are amen I'm not talking I'm talking to Believers here tonight we've just passed through a trying testing year full of covert full of devils full of ever casting every trial you can think about but we are fasting a new year amen never mind what they are saying and what they're talking about amen that's their way but God has his own way for us amen through it all through it all we'll learn to trust in Jesus and we learn to trust in God Amen praise God

bridegroom to come and pick us up amen praise God the limousine is coming The Chariot is coming you got the ring on your finger already you've been covered by the blood of Christ the Rob Hallelujah is on you all you're waiting now is your chariot right amen let's stand upon God's unchanging word and press on by his grace amen hallelujah yes sir and there was a Man Called Moses did he not turn aside the Bible even uses the very words amen hallelujah how's that he was there with the flock and he maybe was preaching in his limited way in some denomination but in any case he was there with the flock but again he looked and he saw the Bush on fire and this light in the bush attracted his attention and the Bible says and he turned aside amen and then he said to himself let me turn aside and go see what this is all about amen praise God make God speak to your heart tonight and may you if you were just coming into church just listening to the services just being a religious person oh that's not enough may you turn aside tonight and may the spirit call to you to stand with God's despised you and hold to God's unchanging word amen may the Lord bless you amen praise God hallelujah what about Paul Paul didn't not Paul turn aside Paul had a successful career Paul was at the height of his mental uh Acuity Paul was at such a level that he was unparalleled with wisdom and knowledge and degrees and everything else and he was still young amen but at midday let me tell you when your time comes it doesn't matter where you are who you are God knows how to strike you off of your your high horse that you're riding amen and a lot of people are writing a lot of these hobby horses of Education even religion even preachers in the message have their own hobby horse that they're trying to write but God knows how to knock you off your hobby horse into the dust amen and to Humble Us in his divine presence praise the Lord because what Paul turned aside because he saw the light may God turn you aside here tonight because you are you really seen the light Hallelujah out of the word of God Amen praise God and in our day not just from the Bible days but in our day there's a prophet called William Marion Branham and he turned aside because he saw the light he saw the light coming to him in the prayer room and out of the light stepped at 200 pound man with folded arms amen I am sent from the presence of almighty God to tell you about your peculiar life and about your ministry and then he began to tell him a lot of other things amen but to see that his life his ministry and his life turned aside because he was a Baptist preacher amen but he turned aside he turned aside from what denominationalism he turned aside from the system that he was in who the person that spoke to him caused him to see the light hallelujah oh praise God no wonder I think Hank Williams saying that I saw the light I Saw The Light No More in darkness no more at night oh hallelujah praise God I thank God that I've seen that I hope you've seen the light I said I hope you've seen the light oh praise God turn him aside oh my from his denominationalism and then all of a sudden he was a one of the greatest Pentecostal preachers then all of a sudden they started to hear him talking against the nominations why he saw the light oh praise God and now he's talking against the systems that are out there in the world Amen and there his ministry God began to use it for his glory and for his honor then one day he was in the hotel room and the voice said rise up start walking he came out of the hotel he started walking oh as he started walking he went for a great distance he wasn't he wasn't seeing anything or LED to nothing he said he wanted to stop the boy he said no keep walking amen Brothers No Matter What comes your way don't let the devil tell you this is too much this is too hard I can't go on I don't know what I'm really doing what is this all about you trust God that God will lead your right straight to the promised land irrespective of your human wisdom our knowledge our intellectuals amen doubt your doubts and believe God's word hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah keep walking as he walked up the street there he saw a woman leaning on a white picket fence with her here all wrapped amen praise God I can't say like back there in the South because women are wrapping their head in that same old Jemima Aunt Jemima way with the head wraps amen oh my and when he saw the woman he still didn't clue into anything but the woman's morning person he said how you know I'm a a person she said well you see last night I had and she's beginning to tell him the dream and she said but where is the briefcase you're supposed the brown briefcase is supposed to have he said oh my goodness he said I left it in the hotel room according to God oh my her face gone up and his fate God to pray for her and them two are manipotences meet is that right oh praise God and so he prayed for you know the great uh results of that her son was delivered and and what became a conductor and years later brother Bradham going to catch a train and hear a voice and there is the young man now God now he's a young man he's not a boy anymore and rejoicing and praising God forevermore but you see what I want to say there brother Branham even though he was already a Christian already a Believer already preaching the message to a certain level he's still in his mind had his own plans he had his own way of when and how he wanted to do certain things and God has got to fine-tune our training on our teaching and bring us to a place where individually we begin to understand how to be led by the spirit how to understand the voice of God how to recognize when to turn this way when to turn that way when to stop the conversation when to speak when not to speak when and so on praise God God is wanting to fine-tune us and bring us under his Divine complete control for his glory amen so he had to turn aside from his own mind his own thoughts his own ways to obey God and God Alone amen yes sir and that's where we are at here today by His Marvelous Wonderful Grace amen I thank you friends I want to thank God for this great gift that he has placed in us how many here wants to raise their hands together with me and thank God for this great gift [Music] hallelujah amen oh praise God because what is in you is similar to that great star that passed passed across so many different civilizations and if I remember quoting from uh we have seen a star in the east also from God's appropriate gift and a few other uh books like that brother Branham said it passed over all those countries all their wise men all their smart men he says because remember they had no clocks in that time they measured the time by the Stars so they had to pay attention to the stars but even though they were paying attention to the Stars none of them saw this star amen because that star was meant only for those wise men of that day and this star this light this Shining Light spiritual light that's shining out of the world Amen is not meant for everybody else they can see all the stars they can see all other stars all the men or the difference and that but thank God forevermore my lives are seen the coming of the glory of the Lord my eyes are seen a word might manifest and I give God glory for it hallelujah amen all their observatories amen all the theological Institutes set up to observe the world and to catch any little change or any little thing that take place out of that word amen hallelujah he said they looked and didn't see it but them not seeing it listen here he says oh my God yet it was there Hallelujah even if they deny and said what Revelation you're talking about they can deny all their wants you are seeing it you are seeing it because you are predestinated she's here like he said they'll begin to know when it's time for them to know amen praise God forevermore hallelujah amen praise God oh I bless God forevermore and now God's Great and applying this to you now God's Great appropriate gift for this hour that is in you is what led you to this word amen it led them to the Christ back there physical it leads you to Christ today the word itself being born since 65 amen and here we are led to this perfect word of God for this hour amen amen praise God I pray that God's spiritual light will come to every heart here tonight believer or unbeliever May the light shine into every dark place of Our Lives every little thing that we may have hidden doesn't mean you have to go and just throw it open but it means you got to have openness of heart and let the spirit of God shine into the recesses of your soul the dark places of the caverns of the mind that God's spiritual warming glow of his light remember God's light it it's so warming it's so gentle to shine upon your soul and in your soul into every heart here amen praise God and simple as you're listening to me here it may come to you with no emotion is that right it may come to another one with great emotion but it'll Dawn on you and other ones it'll break on them like a midday Sun but the light of God will come and speak to your soul hallelujah amen praise God and maybe no one else nobody else around you will know but you will know that something happened tonight something happened to your heart something happened to your life something broke amen all the scars all the shackles all the dried up Clay that imprisoned you the eggshells that you are in God's spirit breaks the chain that sets you free for his glory and for his honor amen the devil Can't Hold You No More yes claim your your mind Hallelujah you belong to him praise God he alone is the one that can do that amen praise God hallelujah oh praise His wonderful name I praise my prayers my joy tonight May the gift of God in you begin to anoint your life praise God he is not just there to set in you but may the spirit of life that is in you begin to anoint your life to you for to use you for his glory and for his honor that you truly can be a changed woman I'm not talking about change from sin to Salvation I'm talking while you are in Salvation while you are in the world that you become a changed man a changed woman that looks on this word in a different way until the word becomes so bright hallelujah oh praise God brighter and brighter until you walk into the perfect day hallelujah amen praise God shall we not turn aside shall we not turn aside from the things and the systems out there that are in the world when I say assist them right away you may think denomination but no even in the natural world it's set up with systems Educational Systems this system that system and they try to train on the culture rate the people to work walk in these circumscribed areas that they have put and they call it keeping the law well we are supposed to keep the law but God knows how to make you walk through their Maze of life and walk right out under his divine inspiration Hallelujah God wants us all to turn aside amen while we were in Israel we were taken to a shopping area no cars allowed you can just walk and shop from Little Store to little store wherever you wanted to shop but you know even the Jews they I said dim and the uh the seraphim Jews the ones that are conservative they were even looking at our sisters how they were dressed because the rest of them will be at Arab or Jews they dressed as we would call here like the world they're dressed the same way with their pants or this or that and we'll go about their business uh like that but when they see our sisters it catches their attention in every uh possible way like that and God is calling on us to turn aside is that right turn aside turn your eyes away from the things of the world uh sisters God is calling us because you see the spirit is here the spirit of the devil is there to try to make us as Christians to live as close as we can to the world to look a little bit like them but yet not like them or else we gonna be mocked uh are we gonna be scar scoff that we're gonna have to bear some reproach so we try to skirt The Edge and to live this way amen or that way praise God hallelujah but God wants us not to go back to those Fashions of the world God don't want you going back to the king's Palace to see how he is living and they are living over there you don't want you as a wise woman or a wise man to go back to herod's Palace and fashion yourself after that no sir hallelujah oh my and as men God don't want the same thing with us either praise the Lord let's all turn aside for the glory of God may God help every one of us here tonight as we hear the word of the Living God praise God forevermore amen hallelujah amen I trust while you're listening to this that you are wise enough to want to turn aside and not to go back anymore to the things the thoughts and ways machinations and behaviors of the world that is out there I trust God will help us to to really be truly wise Hallelujah and may this great Supernatural a Mystic Voice and sign and light that God had said to us for this hour to Bear witness to our souls to recognize the Deep still calls out to the deep and the Deep response because it recognizes Hallelujah it recognizes the spirit of Christ the voice of God hallelujah in this last day o my praise God hallelujah I pray that tonight somewhere in your heart will be that desire Lord I want to be here with yes I want to manifest your word I want to live according to your promise hallelujah amen oh praise God I'm praying that the Holy Spirit of the Living God as we used to sing a long ago flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me as I raise my hands to worship and to glorify thy name O Holy Spirit flow through me amen yes sir there is a river that flows from the Throne of God and it flows from deep within amen and God sends forth that River to cleanse our hearts from sin and to make us blessed men and women that will bring forth the correct fruit in his season and for his glory amen I trust God will help us to turn aside amen because look it's not that because we preachers make sometimes preach so hard that we don't recognize that our sisters do have a hard time in coping with the way they have to dress with the way they have to behave we recognize that but we have an obligation to preach the word of God Amen but not all of us preach it in love we preach it but not all of us do preach the word of God in love so the way they dress and the length of the dresses amen praise God if you don't understand talk to your Deacon talk to your ministers that are in here amen praise the Lord so they have a hard time sometimes keeping that and they get a hard time sometimes and even being able to buy it in a store because the devil's making sure you take it off the shelf so you can't get it and then you say the prophet says oh go and make it just get a sewing machine there well remember they hardly know how to sew you can hardly patch a shirt or patch or pants or patch their own clothes much less so I know sisters it's you it's a hard season and a hard time we're in but remember as the Press is coming down upon us we are getting ready to go up for his glory and for his honor amen praise God hallelujah I tell you friends it's really tough and it's tough again uh also in the message amen for women sisters to take off all day what you call it the makeup praise God why you have to make up anyway praise God hallelujah God made us the way we are is that right you can say whatever you want you're black you're white you're Chinese you're this so what God who is God made everything and he said it's perfect because that's the way he wants it he didn't make one set of flowers he make all kinds of flowers and when those flowers get together and the contrast between them you see the beauty of God while they're nodding their heads in the Winds of the spirit as the spirit of God passes by oh blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah so you have a hard time with with taking off all that stuff amen our time with your hair and a hard time with this I'm not going to go through the list but I'm just letting you know that uh recognize you do have a hard time but that's what each one of us has a journey and each one of us has got to come to the place where we break through where we have entered into his rest and it's no more a battle with things like that because now I'm resting in his care I'm comforted by his love I'm walking in his light and I know that I am led by the God's holy spirit amen may God help us men that are here tonight anywhere that claims to believe this message May the Holy Spirit teach us how to conduct ourselves in this world that we can walk out of it in white to conduct ourselves with our friends family Neighbors how to conduct ourselves either with our wives and I'm saying what I'm saying because just a couple of nights ago is something that the Lord just showed me said see I made you see this when you were just a boy so that you might know how to act and move in this certain situations and God wants every one of us by the Holy Spirit of almighty God to know how to walk how to live with him and in him and to manifest the flow of this great gift that God has given to every one of us may God help us to turn aside from all the things that are in this world here tonight and may we all together here bring glory to his name because friends simple as it is there were warned of God by a dream you're not being warned of God by a dream you were warned of God by a simple message that you're hearing from the prophet and you're hearing here tonight and you may hear again from some other brother as God would reveal it but praise God we're no more in the endemic dream we have woke up by the rising of the sun when we're walking in the light of the day for the glory of God hallelujah amen hallelujah I tell you Mary turn aside and walk with him for all the rest of our days and for the glory of God hallelujah we're going back another way right I'm going to use the wise men here we're not going back by the expected way they expect us to act according to where they act we are not going back the expected way uh we are not going back the acceptable way uh we are not interested whether we are accepted we are prepared and ready to Bear the reproach for the word amen yes sir we're going back another way a way they know not of they don't know this way that we are walking in praise the name the Lord hallelujah amen yes sir praise God I know we all trying to live like Christians we are trying to be Christians where we all going to make mistakes and anytime you make mistakes the devil will sure be right there to take advantage of it amen may God help us to turn aside despite that that this look it's a despised way after clearing your mind this is a despised way we are in you are not of that group of so-called Christians where you wanted to be known you're a Christian and uh it's acceptable to society to recognize that you are born again and you become more so-called respected if you are a church man or looked upon as a church woman that woman prays in church that woman goes for this mass that woman who goes for this certain service or the no no no that's wonderful for outward uh appearances but God wants that worship and that service to pulsate within your own heart within your own life may the spirit of God help every one of us here tonight amen praise God I know brothers sisters especially you're going to be called old-fashioned I've heard them say it myself amen praise God say oh look the way she's dressing you know especially uh women are like that men have their own way but women are like that they they may observe each other praise God and I oh look at how old-fashioned she is look at her hair styles look at that dress what dresses that you say you're wearing oh my God and she got no lipstick and she got no real makeup on her she didn't even know that she can plaster her face and then smooth it off nice with some smoothing cream or something oh my I'm making these things up I don't know nothing about that but the fact is brother's sister the the devil will make you feel old-fashioned and the devil will get some of them to even tell you you're old-fashioned amen but thank God we acknowledge we are all fashioned because we come from the old time religion we come from the all-time worship we come the all-time praising God like we were up in glory there is not all the former worship no all no way of hearing glory to God than that when we were in his divine presence yes praise God hallelujah along with him we are of the Ancient of Days amen praise God hallelujah God is asking us to turn aside amen yes sir and I'm not even call you everything else I can't even think of anything else but they can make up things you never even dream of to call you other than calling you old-fashioned they may call you all kinds and other names and you might be able to give some of them to me so I can know what they are amen oh my us man it's very easy for men to tell men off because men are more uh bold and brave and they wear talking and God are you not mad at all fanatic is that right yeah you're out of uh line with the times I don't want to be in line with the times I want to be in line with the Timeless one I want to be in line with the word of God hallelujah amen and let us all here tonight say Lord I want to go the way you want me to go I want to live the way you want me to live I want to turn aside from these attractions that are out there in the world and while I'm talking I just thought of something I read today where brother Brandon said when those sheep are following a Shepherd he saw them he said he wondered why they weren't turning aside a juicy piece of this is over there that he knows sheep like but they're still not going to eat it they go on a little more there's another Bush that sheep love but they're not going there they just keep their eyes on the shepherd and they keep walking following him that's what we have to do Look Away to Jesus come look to the left not to the right don't look at though storms that are all around you the troubles and the trials keep your Eyes On Jesus and he will bring you safely through amen hallelujah oh praise God the great Minister Oral Roberts once preached a great message of these few words I always remember you can't go under when he says you're going over I said you can't go under because God says you're going over no matter what Temptation whatever trial whatever pressing the devil brings against you your mind you can't go under amen because God says let's go over to the other side it settled when he once he says that oh praise God hallelujah amen praise God amen amen praise God fanatics Fanatics Billy Fanatics brother Mike oh my Fanatics brother Josh amen that's what the world would call some of us men who holds to God's word and the promises of this day with Divine understanding praise the name of the Lord you know it's hard for men to because sometimes they want to share like you would whatever to their family to their dear loving friends to their work Associates to their neighbors they want to share it with people whom they appreciate and love with all their heart but yet this those very people will turn around and call you a fanatic until you shut up when you come around here when you're talking to me don't talk nothing about nor Jesus and about no uh prophet and about no message and all the stuff and we don't want to hear it and they'll turn you down and shut you up amen but you know we'll go another way because God taught the prophet how to go another way the prophet will start talking about cars and Automobiles and then you'll talk about fishing or to another man as God will lead him he talked about hunting and then later on maybe they talk for an hour and then the conversation would somehow merge into what the Holy Spirit really wants him to say so you've got to talk to God let God teach you and show you how to go another way by the grace of God hallelujah how to take God's despised way and bring glory to his name amen praise God I tell you I want God that's living in my heart to be made manifest perfectly for his glory amen because he's not a dead God and he's a living God I can feel brother Mike's desire amen I know you all have desires but praise God we want to see a living God we've been preaching about him to you we've been talking bringing the word but you see God wants us to a certain place before he can make himself manifest amen before he can do this praise God and that he might be glorified amen praise God and I pray tonight that we would all reconsecrate ourselves to him praise God would you do that we consecrate Our Lives to him praise God may we pray a prince and Lord help me let me turn aside let me really turn aside take a good look at ourselves and I pray praise God that the angels of God will sweep down Among Us Praise the Lord you know he said that he said you'll be in them meetings at that time and suddenly you'll feel a sweep of divine love go through that place before you anoint you're traveling like a sock amen praise God before you can recognize your little presence of the Living God hallelujah brother sister I believe we're living in those kinds of times right now things are striking my soul striking your soul amen the time is at hand amen glory to God Amen I pray will turn aside from these systems of the world and turn aside from even our own cares that are in the world oh my God I don't have enough money saved up and now uh what you call it the recession coming inflation eating away at everything can't pay the rent can't pay my mortgage can't do this can't do that devil does that like Russia is doing bombing and everything else to bring fear this is what he's trying to do upon you but I'm here to steal your heart to comfort your soul that you might recognize the god you serve and the god you believe Watches Over You amen you're in the palm of his hands hallelujah praise God and he'll never let you go because you belong to him praise God oh Praises wonderful marvelous name amen praise God hallelujah be warned of God the time is at hand this time that we are seeing around us is the time the time is a Time Jesus is coming Jesus is here Hallelujah I was corrected right there he's here because you see the wise men when they saw the star that was the sign the prophet William Branham or God's only uh certified Prophet has said in this age when they saw that star in the sky they were sure Messiah is on earth now it made them no Messiah is on the Earth right now amen amen hallelujah it's just it's not the time for him to come come in Corporal body make himself manifest in that way all of that Rapture time amen and we're living in that time right now praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I pray my friends that may the Holy Spirit given us personal revivals amen and I'm praying not I'm not not preaching to you because I'm praying for one within my own self that I will renew my strength and I'm not talking just physical that that one we know that's wasting every day as a human but I'm talking about the inward man growing in the spirit of almighty God stronger in his grace amen renewing the strength that I might fulfill his Divine word hallelujah and let us do that tonight by our reconsecration of our walk our dedication with God and let him have his way with us Once you turn aside tonight turn aside from however you were living and come back into His Marvelous and Wonderful Grace as we reconsecrate ourselves can we just say Lord receive me Lord receive me take me to a higher level take me Lord to a higher dimension move me up o God into a higher Realm that I might look and see into tomorrow you might see your promises your will or your word being made manifest Lord

become weary with the journey and begin to murmur begin to complain begin to find fault with the preacher all kinds of things that they began to do in that way but I pray that the gift of God in us amen will cause us to go out as we have enjoyed the beauty of God and enjoy the beauty of God within our hearts and within our life and I pray that the spirit of God will put in us now a desire to win souls to Christ amen not to sit at ease in Zion amen but to search to find I mean with desperation and urgency amen oh praise God to win that last one wherever they are here there across the world
