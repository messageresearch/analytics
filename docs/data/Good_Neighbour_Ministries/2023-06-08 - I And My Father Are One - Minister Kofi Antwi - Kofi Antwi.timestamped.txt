[24:15] in the devil and there's no batting in
[24:18] God our God is real let me tell you we
[24:23] have seen God so much in Good Neighbor
[24:29] since
[24:30] I always said those that have been in
[24:33] the church here for long
[24:35] we have seen the power of God
[24:39] made manifest right in Good Neighbor
[24:45] the time that was Eagle cry God was
[24:48] manifesting the pillar of fire was
[24:51] demonstrating to us
[24:53] that God is real through our precious
[24:56] brother and I always said that if it was
[24:59] not him I don't know God
[25:02] [Music]
[25:03] I in my heart I wanted to see reality of
[25:07] God but when I came in went oh my
[25:10] goodness the White Church
[25:13] I saw God so much
[25:17] and I'm not lying not because he's here
[25:19] his wife is here or anybody is here if
[25:23] you and I always said is if you think
[25:25] I'm just talking about Pastor Simon
[25:28] that's all right with me but let me tell
[25:30] you even in the message
[25:33] message you can't find so many preachers
[25:37] like him
[25:39] and let me tell you we have to praise
[25:42] God for that we have to thank God for
[25:45] that for a man to surrender for God to
[25:49] move him to use him Timber you are
[25:53] eyewitness of that
[25:56] right you see the way Timmy is preaching
[25:58] you see the way Danny is preaching you
[26:00] see the way Crystal I was here
[26:03] before all of them started preaching and
[26:07] I saw everything
[26:09] that God has done through our pastor and
[26:13] through them
[26:14] I have seen it I am eyewitness
[26:18] I speak from my heart I don't know why
[26:22] even God will call it a dummy person
[26:26] like me to come to the pulpit but it
[26:28] doesn't matter whether I'm dummy or I'm
[26:31] right or this let me tell you God is
[26:34] real I know that from the bottom of my
[26:37] heart Pastor you have preached for me to
[26:39] see it I'm eyewitness I've seen I've
[26:42] gone to places even rich people I'm
[26:45] talking with them the power of God in Me
[26:48] pick them up throw them in the ground
[26:52] they cry like a baby in front of me so I
[26:56] know what I'm talking about I know God
[26:59] is real I don't want hypocrisy too many
[27:03] hypocrisy people in the message
[27:06] is the truth
[27:07] too many hypocrisy hypocrisy is not good
[27:11] let's throw away anything that will
[27:15] hinder the Holy Spirit
[27:17] to move
[27:19] to
[27:21] bed witness in our heart in the people
[27:25] that are listening to us the people that
[27:27] we meet recently I was talking to a
[27:31] Muslim
[27:32] who is Imam in my country
[27:36] sorry please be seated
[27:39] I listen and this man I think Daniel
[27:44] have told you about him he was the man
[27:46] that used to
[27:48] take his one plate and feed me I'll
[27:51] preach but I'm coming
[27:53] and
[27:54] the thing that this man did for me in my
[27:57] life
[27:58] I I can't if even if it was me I can do
[28:01] it the man have one plate of rice
[28:05] and he shared with me if he didn't give
[28:08] me I was gonna die I I don't know who in
[28:10] Nigeria so every time I go home I see
[28:14] him
[28:15] but I have nothing to offer him and I
[28:18] was afraid if I tell him the message he
[28:21] won't listen
[28:22] and it will be in my heart pain but you
[28:25] know what God Made A Way
[28:27] not knowing he has become a man
[28:30] and the Lord made a way for me to share
[28:33] the word with him
[28:35] he confessed that Jesus Christ is god
[28:39] with his own lips
[28:41] I use the Quran
[28:43] talking with him
[28:45] let me tell you
[28:48] when you believe the message brother
[28:50] Brown preached and the Bible
[28:52] and you surrender your heart it will
[28:56] bring you to Christ
[28:58] it will lead you to cause it will lead
[29:00] you to the reality of Christ
[29:03] because a lot of people in the message
[29:07] are still in the message as I said last
[29:10] time they know the cause they know that
[29:13] that the Bible but they haven't made the
[29:16] author of The Bible which is Jesus
[29:18] Christ
[29:21] they haven't made that altar even in the
[29:24] message they were long clothes they
[29:26] don't wear earrings
[29:28] and the woman they don't paint their
[29:32] face the men they don't wear shorts they
[29:35] don't do things widely but still they
[29:39] come to church and go come and go come
[29:41] and go come and go but they themselves
[29:44] have never experienced
[29:48] Christ who is our life Christ in reality
[29:53] listen for me if you wanna tell me about
[29:57] the Bible don't just give me quotes
[30:00] cause won't be enough for coffee
[30:03] I need reality and that's what I saw in
[30:06] Pastor Simon
[30:08] that make me stay here
[30:10] when I saw the power of God moved I said
[30:14] if this is not Pentecost
[30:17] then let me I don't know no Pentecost in
[30:20] the Bible but I'm seeing reality of
[30:23] Pentecost right in the church
[30:29] this Muhammad priest I spoke with him
[30:34] told him the churches has failed the
[30:38] Quran
[30:39] on the people has failed
[30:42] but Quran tell us that because I've been
[30:45] in Muslim before
[30:46] people don't know but I was a Muslim too
[30:50] in my life
[30:51] So I says Quran
[30:55] inside Quran Quran says
[30:58] [Music]
[31:01] sorry I says Quran says God is the only
[31:05] one that can create he says yes
[31:08] I want to get into Christ but see the
[31:11] wisdom God gave me
[31:13] and I says to him
[31:16] Christ sorry
[31:19] which is Christ when Muslim call anabisa
[31:23] they mean Christ anybody that has gone
[31:25] to Muslim will tell you and ABI says
[31:28] Jesus Christ I says
[31:30] [Music]
[31:32] took the dust and make the bed he goes
[31:37] that's true
[31:39] then I says to him
[31:41] he says oh I never he said so many
[31:43] things
[31:44] and I said yeah he did a lot of things
[31:46] now I'm bringing him to
[31:48] to show him my what is behind me I said
[31:52] Mustafa who is
[31:56] your Quran says God is the one that can
[32:00] create another took the Das and make a
[32:02] bed since you born and you come to the
[32:05] Muslim your great great grandmother all
[32:08] of them are heavy Muslims and they all
[32:11] bowdy ahead have you ever seen that God
[32:13] that they talking they are Allah that
[32:15] they are talking
[32:17] he goes no I says the Quran says
[32:22] only God can create
[32:24] have you heard Muhammad create no have
[32:28] you heard Buddha create no then I says
[32:31] only annabisa take the bed take the dust
[32:34] and make
[32:36] bed who is an abisa he goes God
[32:43] and says praise the Lord
[32:46] praise the Lord that says you see now I
[32:51] can get something from him he has
[32:55] confessed that anabi says God I was
[32:58] thinking even he was a teacher
[33:00] in the Muslim he says no I'm Imam while
[33:03] I was talking with him they go a lot
[33:06] that their time was time for service he
[33:09] goes all Kofi let's talk I love your

[33:28] message
[33:29] and using the wisdom of God and going to
[33:33] him and he is confessing that Jesus is
[33:36] God why I was talking with him the line
[33:38] was crinkling and cranking and he could
[33:41] I do everything I couldn't get him I
[33:43] said okay thank you Lord now I know it's
[33:45] a seed some seed is there I'm gonna go
[33:48] to Ghana

[34:26] much Hypocrites too much intellectuals
[34:28] where is the power of God where is God
[34:32] where is brother Abraham God that he
[34:35] used to talk not as our pastor says a
[34:38] lot of them know God on the wall they
[34:41] have done the same thing Pentecostals
[34:43] used to do
[34:45] the same thing
[34:48] but they don't know God in reality
[34:51] let us move to the reality
[34:54] the god that is
[34:57] just in some people mind
[34:59] just in their mind bring him on the sea
[35:04] to the people
[35:06] that they will know Jesus is real
[35:09] otherwise I don't care how much you call
[35:11] Jesus Is Dead other is dead in your life
[35:15] oh he's not real
[35:18] if he's real bring him on the sea
[35:21] wherever you go bring Jesus on the sin
[35:24] Jesus want to know
[35:28] that you love him more than anything
[35:32] if you love him more than anything he
[35:35] will come on the scene he knows my heart
[35:38] my heart he knows your heart
[35:40] every heart Jesus knew
[35:44] I can fool you
[35:46] but I cannot fool Jesus
[35:48] you can fool me but you can't fool Jesus
[35:53] blessed be the name of the Lord that is
[35:55] the appetite
[35:57] that is the appetite I'm just giving you
[35:59] an appetite
[36:02] I haven't started my message yet
[36:06] that is the appetite I'm trying to give
[36:08] it to you to wake you up if you are
[36:10] asleep you wake up because listen
[36:15] sister Palm has stood behind Pastor
[36:18] Simon sister thank you
[36:21] let everyone that know say thank you
[36:24] sister it's not easy this country
[36:30] it's not easy
[36:32] for pastor Simon to preach sister salmon
[36:34] to be at the back for them to grow like
[36:37] this and they still
[36:39] believe in the message we're still
[36:42] seeing the power of God we still seeing
[36:44] their life oh I don't know what to say
[36:47] but it is the grace of God
[36:51] sister thank you if nobody will say
[36:54] thank you I will send it to you praying
[36:57] before the people listen
[37:00] give honor to whom the honor desired to
[37:04] give it to
[37:07] our pastor has done a work for us
[37:10] he has Brothers if he's not here to Bear
[37:14] Danny Christopher everyone that stand
[37:17] here they preach with their heart you
[37:20] can see
[37:23] Desmond myself whoever God chose let us
[37:28] back him up
[37:29] for the Holy Spirit to do the work
[37:32] because it's the holy spirit is not the
[37:35] man
[37:36] God
[37:37] will move and I believe Pastor Simon has
[37:41] poured his heart and the Holy Spirit in
[37:44] him as it was in Moses as Moses go
[37:50] Joshua took over
[37:52] the Lord says my servant Moses is dead
[37:56] Joshua
[37:58] take the people to the promised land
[38:01] and as our pastor Aid has come the one
[38:06] that will stop in this Pulpit let us all
[38:09] back him up let us all be behind him
[38:14] so that the world will come fast
[38:17] with power and demonstration
[38:20] with reality
[38:22] listen God
[38:25] the way pastors preached to us if we
[38:27] surrender our heart let me tell you
[38:30] Devils cripples blinds any pain can
[38:35] happen here
[38:36] because the Holy Spirit
[38:39] is here
[38:41] the holy spirit will do the job
[38:46] but if we don't surrender the Holy
[38:49] Spirit can do the job
[38:52] God can do the job when we don't
[38:55] surrender so as we go into the the new
[39:01] finding I'll say the new pastor will
[39:05] take over
[39:06] Daniel timbir let us pray for them let
[39:11] us pray that God will chose the right
[39:14] one that he has ordained to be here not
[39:18] a man
[39:19] I don't believe in a man preaching no
[39:22] I Believe In Christ
[39:25] the Lord Christ The Mighty God Christ
[39:28] our savior Christ Our healer Christ that
[39:32] will lead us to the promised land which
[39:34] is rapture
[39:37] he's the only one let us all stand up is
[39:40] look
[39:42] say look 10.
[39:45] 10
[39:54] 25
[39:56] to
[40:00] 38
[40:08] okay
[40:09] brother and he just pray before I read
[40:12] we read the scripture
[40:25] amen
[40:28] Saint John my my topic
[40:31] is I give it to the brother
[40:36] I give it to the brother to put it on
[40:39] the board
[40:40] I said I and my father are one
[40:44] that's what I'm speaking
[40:46] Jesus answered them and told
[40:50] you
[40:52] and ye Jesus answered them I told you
[40:58] and ye believed not that the works that
[41:02] I do in my father's name they bear
[41:06] witness of me
[41:11] but ye believed not because he are not
[41:15] of my ship
[41:17] as I said unto you
[41:20] my sheep hear my voice and I know them
[41:25] and they follow me
[41:28] and I gave unto them eternal life
[41:32] and they shall never perish neither
[41:36] shall any man plug them out of my hand
[41:40] my father who gave them me is greater
[41:45] than all and no man is able to plug them
[41:50] out of my father's hand
[41:54] I and my father are one
[41:58] then the Jews took up Stone again to
[42:02] Stone him Jesus answered them many good
[42:07] work Have Eyes show you from my father
[42:13] for which of those work do ye Stone me
[42:18] the Jews answer him saying for a good
[42:24] work we strongly not but for blasphemy
[42:29] and because that thou being a man making
[42:35] thyself God
[42:37] Jesus answered them it is not written in
[42:43] your law I said you are gods
[42:47] if
[42:48] he called them gods
[42:52] unto whom the word of God come and the
[42:57] scripture cannot be broken
[43:00] say ye of him
[43:03] whom the father had Sanctified and sent
[43:07] into the world
[43:09] thou blasphemies because I said I am the
[43:14] son of God
[43:15] if I do not the words of my father
[43:19] Believe Me Not
[43:21] but if I do though he believe not me
[43:25] believe the words that ye may know and
[43:30] believe that the father is in me and I
[43:35] in him
[43:36] may the Lord add his Blessing
[43:39] please be seated
[43:42] we all know the scripture that we have
[43:45] read
[43:52] brother you can off some of the light
[43:54] it's too hot for me here I know
[43:58] we all know the scripture that we have
[44:00] read
[44:02] why the Pharisees
[44:05] wanted to Stone Jesus and kill him
[44:09] why
[44:11] the Pharisees were people that know the
[44:14] letter
[44:15] they know the code just like today
[44:18] as I said Lord no brother Abraham quote
[44:22] know the Bible quote
[44:25] but they don't know Christ
[44:28] because
[44:30] it is not given unto them
[44:34] but we who are bright the wife of Christ
[44:39] no matter what
[44:42] we were chosen before the foundations of
[44:45] this world so Christ
[44:48] has given to us before even we were born
[44:51] the seed of God was lying in our hearts
[44:54] that's why when we came here look
[45:00] so many has come here when the world
[45:02] come they cannot take it
[45:06] but ask yourself what make you come back
[45:09] again
[45:11] what make you stay here
[45:14] you think it's yourself
[45:16] is the Holy Spirit
[45:19] that has call you out
[45:22] has chose you before the foundations of
[45:25] this world is Christ in your soul so
[45:30] recognize it allowed him
[45:33] because one point when Jesus was here he
[45:36] said the son can do nothing
[45:39] unless the father shows him
[45:42] so Surrender Your Life
[45:45] for the Holy Spirit
[45:48] to use you
[45:51] the way God has ordained for your life
[45:55] not just the Lord don't call us as
[45:59] pastor of the brother says all the time
[46:01] to warm the people
[46:03] we're not going to be pure warmers
[46:06] because if you check
[46:09] Pentecost was Pentecost
[46:12] and a lot of people
[46:14] sorry to say we become afraid to step
[46:18] out
[46:19] to take the message to the people
[46:22] to let the people know that Jesus Christ
[46:25] is alive
[46:26] Jesus when he was here
[46:30] he did what the father shows him one
[46:33] point he says not my will
[46:37] but the father will
[46:39] right if you are a sheep
[46:42] you hear the voice of God coming out
[46:46] from the pope from fellowship
[46:50] from the street God can use anybody to
[46:54] speak to you because he is God
[46:57] he can do anything he wants in your life
[47:02] commit your heart fully unto him and
[47:06] says father is not my will your will
[47:09] should be done in my life
[47:12] like Esther said if I perish let me
[47:17] perish I'm going to see the king
[47:20] because tomb yourself
[47:23] to the voice of God in this last days
[47:26] because he is speaking
[47:29] a lot of people
[47:31] they thank God like before when I was in
[47:34] Africa and I was small
[47:37] my grandmothers and my mom when they
[47:41] talk about God or something they look in
[47:43] the sky they always think God is in the
[47:46] sky
[47:47] sister brother God is in you
[47:50] the father that dwell in you he will do
[47:54] the works
[47:55] come up to him you will hear his voice
[47:59] and when you hear that voice don't hide
[48:02] in your heart
[48:03] if you had in your heart
[48:06] things will bypass you
[48:08] because the voice of God
[48:11] like Desmond was saying sometimes most
[48:15] of all the time he comes to you like a
[48:18] thought
[48:19] and when it comes to you you act on the
[48:23] thought that coming to you the Bible
[48:26] says think not what you shall say
[48:29] because why when you have yield yourself
[48:32] to the word
[48:34] God will just flow out of you like a
[48:39] river like a sea bubbling bubbling
[48:42] bubbling bubbling if you watch the sea
[48:44] it comes with the wave right it's
[48:47] bubbling just
[48:49] coming out like that time to time God
[48:52] will speak to your heart he will show
[48:55] you things never mind
[48:58] you know
[49:00] yourself better than anybody God don't
[49:04] deal with us as a group
[49:06] he speak to you as individual
[49:09] and when he speak you are responsible to
[49:12] act
[49:13] sometimes you are working God will bring
[49:15] somebody to you he wanted you to speak
[49:19] to
[49:20] and some of us because of Canadian
[49:24] cultural is called the prophet said
[49:28] Canadians are called so you are called
[49:31] but get warm the word of God is come to
[49:36] warm you
[49:37] come to bring you to what you don't like
[49:42] what the culture does not teach you they
[49:46] can teach you you gather from your
[49:49] comfort zone so many of us sometimes you
[49:53] know
[49:53] because of
[49:55] this place they call
[49:57] first class
[49:59] and they call Africans
[50:01] the third word the Caribbean third word
[50:04] but let me tell you human being is a
[50:07] human being
[50:08] woman being only the clothes or maybe
[50:12] the hair you make the style because of
[50:15] money you have you you have
[50:18] right you are able to buy nice clothes
[50:20] nice perfume nice house nice car but let
[50:26] me tell you whether you go in Africa
[50:28] jungle log Caribbean some Bush there the
[50:33] human beings and you are the same thing
[50:36] they think the same thing
[50:38] they think the same thing
[50:42] yes the only difference is the close but
[50:46] the culture the devil has put into US oh
[50:48] these are third world people these are
[50:51] the high class people and they train you
[50:54] to be cultural proper for me
[50:57] I don't believe in that
[51:01] I believe what God teaches me
[51:04] God says be who you are
[51:08] okay be who you are God give you a mouth
[51:14] I watch the way white people go to
[51:16] soccer game or baseball or hockey all
[51:19] the time I love soccer
[51:21] and I watch the way they react
[51:24] damn and we Africa jungle watching
[51:27] soccer there no difference
[51:30] no difference that's the reality in the
[51:34] people
[51:35] watch Canadians in hockey game
[51:39] and come to my Village in soccer games
[51:43] Sister Mary used to have an uncle as
[51:46] soon as the soccer started we have two
[51:49] teams
[51:52] and yeah kotoko is for Ashanti house is
[51:55] for Yuji tribe Accra people he will go
[51:59] on the village with head red random back
[52:03] and forth even the game hasn't started
[52:06] but it's charging for the game
[52:09] all right
[52:11] the same thing like the hockey and and
[52:14] basketball and the football
[52:17] the white song I watch them they take
[52:20] their shirt and they draw their Germany
[52:23] I know
[52:25] England
[52:27] my goodness
[52:30] what do you think we come to church
[52:33] and sometimes even you live nearby with
[52:36] them they says oh the black people make
[52:38] too much noise
[52:41] [Laughter]
[52:45] people and yet they're going hockey all
[52:47] I really don't throw everything that is
[52:50] you there
[52:51] that is the way you react when you come
[52:54] to Christ lose everything let the power
[52:57] of God flow
[52:59] let God come reality in your life
[53:03] shout jump praise him let me tell you
[53:06] Praise Jesus
[53:09] what is the best thing in your life to
[53:11] praise
[53:12] the Lord
[53:14] if you praise him the glory of God will
[53:17] come down
[53:19] let me tell you God love the presence of
[53:24] his people
[53:25] if you won't praise him he can raise up
[53:27] stones and bring them to praise him
[53:31] and if we praise him
[53:33] that's why let me say this
[53:36] you may not like it but it's the truth
[53:38] the little people don't have nothing to
[53:41] lose when they are serving God they have
[53:45] nothing to lose you watch Peter in the
[53:48] Bible
[53:49] that's why you could go to the Lord
[53:51] because he knows he got nothing to hide
[53:53] he throw everything if he's wrong he's
[53:56] wrong the Lord will correct him
[53:58] right but sometimes educated people and
[54:02] one day the Lord let me walk through
[54:05] some people who have pad doctor and so
[54:08] and so in Toronto October Philip I go
[54:11] and I sit down and I watch them they
[54:14] come put their leg and this and I look
[54:17] and I said what is this even I went to a
[54:20] big Abigail graduation it's nice but let
[54:23] me tell you
[54:25] that's not the way God
[54:28] will take it and says if they give me
[54:31] chance on that platform to speak oh my
[54:35] goodness
[54:37] you see how they will run left right
[54:43] oh my God damn glory to God you bless
[54:47] the gospel in front of them tell them
[54:50] root everything up you see how the
[54:53] spirit of God will chain them up and
[54:56] bring those that one Christ
[55:00] a birth does not come easy
[55:05] a true birth
[55:07] does not come easy
[55:09] the Holy Ghost does not move easy
[55:14] if you sit in your comfort zone God
[55:16] doesn't like it
[55:18] I tell you the truth
[55:21] move out of your comfort zone
[55:24] you see the message preach
[55:27] rejoice
[55:28] you give him praise
[55:31] you come out from your comfort zone then
[55:35] the Holy Spirit can pick you do things
[55:39] heal the sick delivering you all your
[55:43] trouble let me tell you I'm Free by the
[55:46] power of Christ
[55:48] don't you know
[55:49] look at me the doctor says I'm sick with
[55:53] cancer days I run to Pastor someone I
[55:55] said brother pray for me I'm still alive
[55:57] today
[55:59] I said I am still alive today and I'm
[56:03] praising God because why the Lord know I
[56:06] am one of the stone that was laying in
[56:08] in the street he brought out inside and
[56:11] I'm gonna give him praise
[56:13] you may think I'm crazy you may think
[56:17] I'm not right but that is the way of God
[56:22] yes sir
[56:24] God
[56:25] the Bible says they that will worship
[56:28] Christ will worship Him in spirit and
[56:31] Truth
[56:32] the churches they don't want worship of
[56:36] God
[56:37] they don't want men that will speak the
[56:40] truth
[56:42] they don't want the Holy Spirit that's
[56:46] why the Pharisees
[56:47] don't want her to kill Jesus
[56:50] but what they fail to recognize he was
[56:53] the storm that they need to build their
[56:56] churches he was the stalled that they
[57:00] need in their life to make themselves
[57:02] good if you want to look good let me
[57:06] tell you none of us look good only
[57:09] Christ Lord God so if you are allowed
[57:12] Holy Spirit to take your life
[57:14] inside the people seeing the people
[57:17] you're gonna look back but God gonna
[57:20] rejoice
[57:21] God gonna say this is my beloved Son
[57:24] this is my beloved doctor I am well
[57:28] pleased to dwell in him you remember
[57:30] David
[57:33] the Lord took him from a ship fall
[57:37] when he was looking after a ship his own
[57:40] father
[57:41] Jesse even didn't choose him because
[57:45] there was no Beauty to desire of him his
[57:48] own father refused the prophet refused
[57:51] him
[57:53] like he won't choose him but God has
[57:55] chose him when he came and you think
[57:59] David you talk about Christ he gonna sit
[58:02] warm and then look at you with his face
[58:05] like that no say David gonna praise God
[58:09] David gonna dance because he knew what
[58:13] God has done for him he know that God is
[58:16] real to him he know that he have nothing
[58:20] to lose if it wasn't God what is his
[58:23] life
[58:24] we went and look at former brother in
[58:27] the hospital Timber myself Philip
[58:31] and you face when we saw him in hospital
[58:35] bed it was so sad
[58:38] the flesh we are not worried
[58:42] then you ask yourself
[58:45] the earth I live
[58:47] is that if the Lord tells this flesh
[58:51] gonna come to an end like that
[58:54] then if I don't Praise Jesus
[58:57] what have I done
[59:00] you want to be like that
[59:02] we women's we want to shovel things
[59:04] around
[59:06] shovel things around
[59:08] and put Jesus last
[59:11] when is he he's supposed to be number
[59:13] one in our life
[59:15] he's supposed to be the king of King in
[59:18] your home
[59:19] King of Kings in your home he is
[59:22] supposed to be the Messiah
[59:25] the Eternal one that you bow down to
[59:29] look at the heaters
[59:32] the Muslims the Buddha the the
[59:37] Buddhists Muslims
[59:40] they go to Temple they don't know Christ
[59:46] yes they worship in vain but let me tell
[59:49] you that's why when a true Muslim gets
[59:52] salvation
[59:54] you talk about worship
[59:56] you talk about praising God
[59:58] you talk about
[1:00:00] knowing god the power of God
[1:00:03] they are not gonna joke
[1:00:06] they put their hand
[1:00:10] they want to die for it because the
[1:00:14] reality has shrugged your heart
[1:00:17] and let me tell you if reality has
[1:00:20] struck in your heart
[1:00:22] you don't take Christ as a second hand
[1:00:25] like I just bought a second-hand car
[1:00:29] no sir Christ is not second-hand car
[1:00:33] is the first car is the priority
[1:00:37] his everything
[1:00:39] that's supposed to be in you in reality
[1:00:43] he's supposed to be all of all of your
[1:00:47] life
[1:00:48] then you tomb up
[1:00:51] to him
[1:00:53] listen I have seen God does so many
[1:00:57] things in my life
[1:00:59] and I'm not just talking for joke
[1:01:02] when I came to the message
[1:01:05] I used to
[1:01:07] if that's what I see I will tell you I
[1:01:09] used to fast Monday to Friday the time
[1:01:11] brother I used to come to wawuna I don't
[1:01:14] even know how to wear better clothes and
[1:01:16] better chew a better suit when I was in
[1:01:19] the world I used to dress nice but when
[1:01:21] the Lord called me I make my heart I
[1:01:24] give all
[1:01:25] and I used to fast I used to see God
[1:01:28] knows my hotel
[1:01:30] brother Desmond and brother Michael told
[1:01:33] me no brother you can't do that
[1:01:36] because the word has come to you
[1:01:39] live the word
[1:01:41] God will take care of the rest
[1:01:43] that time I was not joking because I
[1:01:46] came from the street and I was looking
[1:01:49] for God
[1:01:50] and that time let me tell you this
[1:01:52] message God is my witness flip is
[1:01:54] sitting here
[1:01:55] when I'm talking to somebody on the
[1:01:58] street

[1:02:04] professor now uh no pad I told Philip

[1:02:17] and the Holy Spirit says speak one word
[1:02:19] in your mind
[1:02:21] don't tell me I will speak it
[1:02:26] right away it started he recognized

[1:07:54] offering they don't want to give it
[1:07:57] he took them to court all kinds of
[1:07:59] things
[1:08:00] brothers and sisters
[1:08:03] that kind of gospel
[1:08:06] is price paid
[1:08:08] Pastor have paid a price
[1:08:11] we you and I
[1:08:15] is our time
[1:08:17] pay the price
[1:08:19] and see Christ
[1:08:21] in your life
[1:08:23] all
[1:08:25] get up
[1:08:26] those that who do the job
[1:08:29] will do it
[1:08:31] Jesus doesn't care whether two or three
[1:08:33] or four or five
[1:08:35] one one is majority
[1:08:38] when he got hold of something
[1:08:40] how many did something kill 3
[1:08:44] 000 Philistines
[1:08:45] it was the spirit of God in something
[1:08:49] the church spirit is in you
[1:08:53] it sounds very that was in something is
[1:08:56] in you is in me
[1:08:59] what are we gonna do with that message
[1:09:02] pray around
[1:09:03] the importance
[1:09:06] to the life
[1:09:09] electric Pole
[1:09:11] he pointed he says go beyond the camp
[1:09:15] is that not what he said
[1:09:18] what is the camp go beyond the message
[1:09:20] camp
[1:09:22] the message come
[1:09:24] when you go beyond you see Christ
[1:09:27] then he picks you up
[1:09:30] then you do things that surprise you
[1:09:34] things that even Church
[1:09:37] not many knows him
[1:09:39] not many cc
[1:09:41] not many will allow themselves to go
[1:09:44] through that way
[1:09:46] and when you do those things you know
[1:09:48] how you're gonna become to the some of
[1:09:51] so-called Believers sometimes
[1:09:54] you become like a bomb to them you
[1:09:56] become like a dog oh these guys dummy he
[1:09:59] cried too much this guy is he yelled too
[1:10:02] much this guy think he knows all the
[1:10:04] quotes he knows everything
[1:10:06] but let me tell you
[1:10:09] you are hearing the voice of God
[1:10:14] when they begin to shut you out Jesus
[1:10:17] will take you in
[1:10:19] you want Jesus to take you in all you
[1:10:22] want the church to accept you then Jesus
[1:10:26] shut you out
[1:10:28] salvation is you and Christ
[1:10:32] just like a wife and a husband a husband
[1:10:36] and wife you and your husband alone do
[1:10:40] you sisters that are married do you see
[1:10:42] your mommy and your husband and you
[1:10:45] sleep in one bed
[1:10:46] it doesn't work that way
[1:10:48] is you alone in Christ
[1:10:51] and so is it with church if you are with
[1:10:56] Christ you become wine with him he pick
[1:10:59] you up
[1:11:00] and said daughter walk with me
[1:11:03] walk with me
[1:11:06] Christ is looking for the people that
[1:11:09] will walk with him
[1:11:11] Christ is looking for Souls that are
[1:11:15] desperate
[1:11:17] that will move up out of their own way
[1:11:20] give up
[1:11:22] the world and take Jesus
[1:11:25] but when you walk with Jesus
[1:11:28] you're gonna be eyeball
[1:11:30] you're gonna be no good because your
[1:11:34] life gonna be different
[1:11:36] different walk
[1:11:39] before you were walking straight like
[1:11:41] everybody was looking now you're gonna
[1:11:43] walk sometime like this and sometimes
[1:11:46] like this sometime like this because
[1:11:48] Jesus is leading right when he lead you
[1:11:52] he don't let nobody know
[1:11:56] is shutting with you and you alone
[1:11:59] because we are Gentiles we are
[1:12:01] individuals
[1:12:03] we are not
[1:12:05] body it's nice we come together but when
[1:12:08] you come here bring your the the fire
[1:12:12] that is in you if you are bright bring
[1:12:14] the fire
[1:12:15] that is in you
[1:12:18] don't think the preacher you're gonna
[1:12:20] drag the preacher to speak
[1:12:23] to you
[1:12:24] you'll come you pray
[1:12:27] you come you are you tired
[1:12:30] because when you charge
[1:12:33] pray for the preachers the brothers pray
[1:12:36] for our pastor
[1:12:38] pray for him then the holy spirit is
[1:12:42] able whoever stand here whether it's
[1:12:45] done in Timber Christopher Desmond
[1:12:48] Phillip myself whoever God chose to
[1:12:51] stand here
[1:12:53] pray for them it's not easy
[1:12:57] because
[1:12:59] let me tell you if God really chose you
[1:13:02] to be
[1:13:04] I haven't stepped up to be a pastor and
[1:13:07] I that part no say in my mind I don't
[1:13:12] want it no in my life I don't want it
[1:13:15] because I know I can
[1:13:17] but it's not easy
[1:13:21] I respect that's why I respect the
[1:13:24] brothers
[1:13:25] nothing I respect you
[1:13:27] tell my respect you feel it I respect
[1:13:31] you Christopher wherever you are Desmond
[1:13:34] Glory I respect all of you because you
[1:13:37] know why
[1:13:38] to bring one word you don't know what we
[1:13:42] go through
[1:13:43] you may think it's easy
[1:13:45] the devil fights
[1:13:48] to bring the word
[1:13:50] he fights for you to deliver the message
[1:13:54] and you will see
[1:13:56] that
[1:13:58] your heart you want to bring aware that
[1:14:01] God wants you to bring to the Believers
[1:14:04] and the devil will be fighting you like
[1:14:07] crazy
[1:14:09] he don't want you to do it but let me
[1:14:11] tell you God
[1:14:14] whom he has chosen doesn't care when you
[1:14:17] see that you rejoice
[1:14:19] you inside your heart then you know you
[1:14:23] are doing something good you know that
[1:14:25] you are doing damage to the devil you
[1:14:27] see there's money preacher a very nice
[1:14:30] sermon last time
[1:14:32] test
[1:14:33] today what he we do we have to pray for
[1:14:36] him brother Philip told me just pray
[1:14:39] they call him to pray for this more
[1:14:42] what is that that devil is attacking
[1:14:46] because he don't want the word
[1:14:49] they see that it is there to come out
[1:14:53] and speak to God's children
[1:14:55] because this is
[1:14:57] this church
[1:14:59] I always had it Pastor used to have the
[1:15:02] cake now the cake is divided
[1:15:06] Danny have is Timber Havis Philip
[1:15:08] Harvest that's one Harvest Christopher
[1:15:10] Harvest I have mine right Curry have his
[1:15:14] part
[1:15:15] the devil is Happy is the same thing
[1:15:19] going on the same thing like when the
[1:15:22] prophet was here preaching
[1:15:24] when the prophet was here
[1:15:26] he preached then the word goes to
[1:15:30] a people
[1:15:31] sometimes when they go home they can't
[1:15:34] even sleep
[1:15:35] preachers can't even sleep
[1:15:38] Pastor is sitting here if I'm lying
[1:15:40] she'll tell me
[1:15:42] sometimes the devil want to attack your
[1:15:45] wife your children
[1:15:48] my goodness the whole week my leg
[1:15:51] this leg
[1:15:53] but let go no leg
[1:15:55] I'm calling
[1:15:58] let me tell you Lego no leg pain I'm
[1:16:02] coming
[1:16:04] some people they get a little bit
[1:16:05] headache they want to stay home do you
[1:16:07] know how much the preacher they go
[1:16:09] through
[1:16:10] with this kind of preaching that we get
[1:16:13] here
[1:16:15] we go to ask brother darling sister
[1:16:17] Jennifer you know Sister Deborah you
[1:16:19] know because you live with the brothers
[1:16:22] for pasta
[1:16:25] I won't even go there
[1:16:27] what they go through
[1:16:30] and if you're a good preacher
[1:16:33] God see this in you
[1:16:35] even the message they don't want you to
[1:16:37] preach you go someplace they want to
[1:16:40] shut you back off the door
[1:16:43] but let me tell you God word will get up
[1:16:47] this is the hour
[1:16:49] no matter what they do
[1:16:52] Judah did everything he took all the
[1:16:56] money from the treasury
[1:16:58] right
[1:16:59] he was a trustee he took all their money
[1:17:01] but did that stop Jesus
[1:17:04] because the elect the seed of God is
[1:17:07] there already before they were born
[1:17:10] who were chosen before the foundations
[1:17:13] of this world at the day of Pentecost
[1:17:15] one day the unwritten part of the word
[1:17:18] came on them
[1:17:21] did you saw Judas part of it
[1:17:23] he was not part of it because that one
[1:17:27] you can't take intellectual to
[1:17:29] impersonate it
[1:17:31] you can't take cause and impersonate it
[1:17:35] and we are heading to the same thing
[1:17:38] with the message the prophet William
[1:17:40] Abraham brought
[1:17:42] we are heading to the same thing
[1:17:46] because
[1:17:47] the devil is Connie
[1:17:50] we have here had knowledge but God have
[1:17:54] us here
[1:17:58] he's hidden in the heart
[1:18:00] so the devil think he can take the
[1:18:03] prophet quote slapping back forward and
[1:18:06] put it together sounds good and they
[1:18:08] think that's the message no
[1:18:11] now the message
[1:18:13] has moved
[1:18:15] from
[1:18:17] the written part to the unwritten part
[1:18:19] is now not in man's hand
[1:18:22] now it's not anybody has
[1:18:25] to control the message
[1:18:27] before people try to use their five
[1:18:31] sense to control the word of God
[1:18:34] but now God is saying I had enough
[1:18:39] I'm coming on the scene
[1:18:41] myself I'm coming
[1:18:44] I'll speak to my children I'll speak to
[1:18:48] the ellipse lips to lips ear to ear
[1:18:51] heart to heart and they will accomplish
[1:18:54] what I have spoken my word will never
[1:18:58] return unto me boy it will accomplish
[1:19:02] what I have spoken
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:09] yes
[1:19:11] it will accomplish
[1:19:14] what I have spoken because I am God I
[1:19:19] tend not I not
[1:19:23] I am the creator of heaven and that I
[1:19:27] like not I cannot
[1:19:30] I will accomplish what I have spoken
[1:19:35] that is the word of God
[1:19:39] couldn't can't you see
[1:19:42] when I was in the prophet
[1:19:46] you think brother Abraham did it
[1:19:49] what Abraham can do nothing
[1:19:52] was I the Lord
[1:19:54] I did it
[1:19:56] and I'm gonna do this champagne my wife
[1:20:01] I'm gonna do the same thing

[1:21:01] god of Jacob the god of William
[1:21:04] the world has turned my word upside down
[1:21:07] they don't want to believe what I spoke
[1:21:11] Abraham they're taking it as a joke
[1:21:16] they're taking it to play game
[1:21:19] let me tell you
[1:21:21] what I have spoken will be fulfilled
[1:21:25] whether you like it or not no man can
[1:21:28] argue no man can challenge me because I
[1:21:32] am God
[1:21:33] are lie not
[1:21:35] I change not
[1:21:38] brothers and sisters
[1:21:40] let us love the Lord with all our heart
