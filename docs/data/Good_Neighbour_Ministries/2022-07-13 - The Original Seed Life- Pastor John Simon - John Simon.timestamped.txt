[22:49] god bless you
[22:50] amen
[22:52] uh our scripture will be found in
[22:55] genesis 1
[22:57] verse 11.
[23:08] our our
[23:09] lesson for tonight
[23:12] is the original seed life
[23:15] the original
[23:16] seed life
[23:18] genesis
[23:20] 1
[23:21] 11.
[23:23] and
[23:24] our scripture
[23:26] reads
[23:31] and god said
[23:34] let the earth bring forth grass
[23:37] the herb yielding seed
[23:40] and the fruit tree
[23:43] yielding fruit
[23:45] after his kind
[23:47] whose
[23:48] seed is
[23:50] in itself
[23:52] upon the earth
[23:54] and it was so praise god our gracious
[23:59] heavenly father
[24:00] we are so thankful
[24:02] for every
[24:04] individual soul
[24:07] that is represented here upon this earth
[24:12] in this mortal realm
[24:14] and physically they stand before me
[24:19] as i stand before them
[24:22] spirit with spirit will meet
[24:25] god's spirit with our spirit
[24:28] and together fellowshipping with thee
[24:32] under the divine
[24:34] inspiration of the word of god
[24:38] we pray that your holy presence
[24:42] will draw us together
[24:44] draw our minds and thoughts away
[24:48] from the
[24:50] toils of the road
[24:52] and lord the various distractions
[24:56] that will come into our lives
[24:59] we pray now
[25:01] just for a
[25:02] few
[25:03] moments time lord of time
[25:07] that you will just bring us into your
[25:09] word
[25:10] that we might see thy glorious light and
[25:14] give you praise and honor and glory
[25:17] for we ask it in jesus christ's name
[25:20] amen and amen the lord bless you
[25:24] please be seated
[25:27] now
[25:28] we know of course
[25:30] that god
[25:32] in
[25:33] before the foundations of the world
[25:36] god
[25:38] wanted to
[25:40] uh plant or place his sea life
[25:44] on this earth
[25:46] right we see that in all the parables
[25:51] that he
[25:52] spoke about the
[25:54] sower and the seed really which was god
[25:57] speaking about himself and what he
[25:59] wanted to do and what he did
[26:01] and how satan corrupted the entire way
[26:05] and
[26:06] so god wanted to plant his seed upon the
[26:09] earth the seed of his life upon the
[26:12] earth
[26:13] and
[26:14] that life should have traveled through
[26:17] adam through eve and then it should have
[26:21] multiplied itself throughout the entire
[26:23] earth
[26:26] and that is why that even after they
[26:28] sinned
[26:30] uh
[26:30] before they sin and after he says go and
[26:34] multiply
[26:35] right before go multiply
[26:38] and replenish the earth now watch the
[26:41] word replenish because there's a little
[26:44] topic there but we won't go to that now
[26:47] uh praise god here it is friends
[26:50] and so god's
[26:54] seed life
[26:56] came
[26:57] on the earth
[26:58] but then
[27:00] you know the great war the battle that
[27:04] was going on in heaven
[27:06] how
[27:07] lucifer
[27:09] at that time he wasn't called satan the
[27:12] devil the old dragon the old serpent he
[27:14] wasn't called those names but these
[27:18] names reflect his character
[27:21] and so he was the light bearer
[27:25] lucifer the one who was there
[27:29] leading the rest of the angels
[27:32] but then
[27:33] he started to
[27:35] raise up himself
[27:37] and say i will lift myself up i'll be
[27:41] greater than god and i'll do this and
[27:43] i'll do that and we know the rest of the
[27:47] story how through his scheming through
[27:50] his lies through his rumors
[27:52] he created a lot of problems in the
[27:56] heavenlies
[27:57] and war really started in the
[28:00] heavenlies and so then
[28:03] uh the war dropped from the heavens and
[28:06] came down to earth
[28:09] man
[28:10] god's creation became the focus of his
[28:13] anger his hatred right so
[28:17] he wants to get a hold of man who is
[28:22] supposed to be god's crowning creation
[28:27] to this day he's trying to make a better
[28:29] man better woman better everything he's
[28:32] trying to do that
[28:34] and so he defiled eve the bible used the
[28:37] word
[28:38] beguile
[28:40] but you look at it defiled eve and so
[28:45] by defiling eve or planting his seed
[28:50] now
[28:51] god
[28:52] to reverse that
[28:55] had to have his seed life planted
[28:59] also
[29:01] and so that is why you will find out in
[29:04] the bible
[29:05] that eve actually bore twins
[29:09] she bore
[29:10] twins and
[29:12] one called kane and the other able not
[29:16] to go around go over that entire story
[29:19] but just to give you a background to
[29:22] where where i'm going here
[29:24] and twins
[29:27] but just as it was in the heavens
[29:30] the one was fighting against god
[29:33] it dropped on the earth
[29:34] so he acted exactly like his father
[29:38] and he fought against abel
[29:41] who was
[29:43] the direct descendant of adam
[29:47] and so
[29:48] they
[29:49] had this
[29:50] battle amongst
[29:52] themselves in the same womb
[29:56] and yet one of god
[29:59] and one of the devil
[30:03] very
[30:04] symbolic
[30:06] you can have a whole church one of god
[30:09] one of the devil
[30:11] i'll take one and i leave one
[30:14] god said that in his word
[30:18] all right
[30:19] so then we find out friends
[30:22] that whoever is of satan's lies
[30:27] that is
[30:28] their origin
[30:31] that will be
[30:32] the motivating factor of their character
[30:37] that will be the thing that inspires and
[30:40] moves them
[30:42] but
[30:43] a bell being from god
[30:46] the seed life of god in him
[30:50] would cause him to
[30:52] have the character
[30:54] uh and the nature
[30:57] like the lord god himself had
[31:02] therefore if we claim
[31:05] that we are sons and daughters of god
[31:09] how can we reject the word of god
[31:14] which the bible says the word is god
[31:18] right so
[31:20] then
[31:21] we find out that if a person claims that
[31:24] they're a christian
[31:26] they claim that they are a believer
[31:29] and turn around and deny the word of god
[31:33] then we know that the spirit that is in
[31:36] them
[31:37] that spirit that is in them
[31:39] is absolutely a hypocrite
[31:44] for
[31:44] its claiming to be
[31:46] a child of god
[31:50] out from the seed life of god which is
[31:53] the word of god
[31:55] and turn around and deny the same word
[31:58] it's impossible
[32:00] it cannot do that
[32:02] it proves right there it's a hypocrite
[32:06] look it's like you take a mule
[32:11] i have to chuckle because i'm thinking
[32:13] of it now
[32:15] and the mule comes if he could talk and
[32:18] tells you i am a sorrow bred horse
[32:25] of course
[32:26] because he is saying something that he
[32:28] really is not
[32:31] it's not just nature
[32:33] he he
[32:34] his nature is to be stubborn his nature
[32:38] is to act like a real brute
[32:41] that is his nature uh he'll go every
[32:43] year he'll just fight against everything
[32:46] that you try to tell him he'll bite yell
[32:49] he'll he'll stomp he'll kick he'll do
[32:52] everything else
[32:54] right but he's claiming that he's a
[32:57] horse
[32:58] then if you kind of put him in a corner
[33:01] and say well you can't be a horse
[33:03] because man you can't even beat that
[33:05] cult over there that young believer that
[33:08] that's there you can't even
[33:10] deal with them so well i'm not really uh
[33:13] you know
[33:14] i was just making a joke i'm not really
[33:16] a horse i'm a donkey
[33:19] well you see he's still lying
[33:22] he's still a hypocrite
[33:24] he's neither one
[33:27] he's a bastard born
[33:29] he's illegitimate
[33:31] and he's against the word of god
[33:34] because the word of god is clear that if
[33:38] you are a part of him you can't reject
[33:41] him you will obey his word because you
[33:44] are part of that word
[33:47] you are part of that life
[33:49] and then for you to reject that is to
[33:51] reject yourself to reject your origins
[33:55] and everything else like that amen
[33:57] praise god and so therefore that is why
[34:02] we see jesus christ
[34:05] was the perfect manifestation
[34:08] of god himself that is why he is called
[34:12] the word
[34:14] for all of god's word god's thoughts
[34:18] god's expressions
[34:20] god's motives and intentions were all
[34:24] in him
[34:26] he was the sum total of it
[34:29] there is nothing more to be added to him
[34:31] or taken away from him no glory can be
[34:34] diminished
[34:36] none whatsoever he stands as the eternal
[34:39] word of god
[34:41] amen he cannot change for that's who he
[34:45] is amen
[34:47] yes sir
[34:48] no
[34:49] satan gave eve a seed
[34:52] but god also gave her a seed
[34:56] and gods gave her that seed so it could
[35:01] comfort
[35:03] conquer
[35:05] and correct
[35:07] these uh
[35:08] thoughts that satan would begin to spew
[35:11] in the world
[35:12] the chaos and the confusion
[35:15] that he would begin to
[35:17] create in the world
[35:19] god made sure that his seed will bruise
[35:24] the serpent's head
[35:27] and that is what i'm talking about he
[35:29] will uh he will conquer satan conquer
[35:32] his works conquer his thoughts conquer
[35:36] every suggestion that comes from him and
[35:39] overcome him and correct every spirit
[35:42] that is in the church of the living god
[35:45] the true church of the living god amen
[35:48] you see god had to do that that way
[35:51] because if his plan was corrupted and
[35:54] obstructed
[35:55] by satan working through a woman then he
[35:59] had to correct it again through a woman
[36:03] is that right
[36:04] so we know that uh in the beginning he
[36:07] did it
[36:08] in a minor form through eve herself
[36:14] by abel coming on the scene
[36:16] but that was foreshadowing
[36:20] the lord jesus christ himself coming
[36:24] through a woman
[36:26] amen
[36:27] a prepared vessel for the hour
[36:31] that god's purpose plan will be
[36:35] fulfilled and the curse will now begin
[36:39] to be reversed
[36:42] amen and so here we find my friends
[36:46] that god moved in such a way
[36:50] one disbelieved his word
[36:53] and disobeyed his word
[36:56] and caused the
[36:58] whole entire
[37:00] world
[37:01] creation
[37:03] to go
[37:04] into chaos confusion and what we say sin
[37:10] evil on every hand
[37:13] but the other
[37:14] uh one my friends that came later
[37:19] she believed god
[37:22] mary believed god
[37:24] she believed god's word hallelujah
[37:27] praise god now you always remember
[37:30] uh in the scriptures a woman
[37:33] is symbolic of the church
[37:37] symbolic of the church
[37:40] it can be symbolic of a false church or
[37:43] of the true church of course jezebel
[37:45] delilah some characters like that are
[37:48] you know symbolic of the false church
[37:52] and people like sarah ruth uh mary they
[37:56] would be symbolic of the true church
[38:00] so here we find out god is showing one
[38:03] took it away and i'm bringing it back by
[38:05] another
[38:06] and here it is we see that god so women
[38:11] you have your place you are blessed by
[38:13] god
[38:14] god placed you here for purpose he
[38:16] placed man on the earth as men for his
[38:19] own purpose to fulfill his word and god
[38:23] bless you amen in every way praise god
[38:27] hallelujah oh my praise god and take my
[38:31] words what i'm saying it doesn't matter
[38:33] whether the woman is a ceo or whether
[38:36] she's a housewife
[38:38] hey man she is a woman that god placed
[38:42] here amen
[38:44] and god placed them here so that they
[38:47] can be vessels for him to fulfill his
[38:50] word
[38:52] amen thank god hallelujah praise his
[38:56] marvelous and wonderful
[38:59] name praise god
[39:01] now
[39:03] god in the beginning all of his children
[39:06] would have been the same
[39:08] i don't mean same in looks
[39:10] and that way but they would have been of
[39:12] the same nature
[39:14] and the same character
[39:16] and that character would have been the
[39:19] word of god in them
[39:21] that is their character that they would
[39:24] have had
[39:25] but
[39:26] satan by his sawing
[39:28] of the seed of discrepancy
[39:32] now he created chaos
[39:34] right created chaos
[39:36] i've told the story over and over how
[39:38] when i was younger i i had this whether
[39:41] you call it vision or dream whatever of
[39:44] a hand
[39:46] with a white coming with a bag of uh
[39:48] coming coming out like that and dropped
[39:52] one coin
[39:53] and i looked at the coin as i bent over
[39:57] to pick it up another hand came out of
[39:59] the heavens filled with a bag of coins
[40:02] and dropped them around the first one
[40:05] and if i did not keep my eye on the
[40:08] original one i would be confused
[40:12] because they all look the same
[40:14] is that right
[40:15] that's what i'm talking about satan
[40:17] create complete confusion on the earth
[40:20] where people are wondering oh is this
[40:22] the word is that the word is it is is
[40:25] that what's preached over there is a
[40:27] word that people are in absolute total
[40:30] confusion and as jesus said it's gonna
[40:34] wax worse and it's waxing worse in sin
[40:37] in
[40:38] everything is waxing worse in unbelief
[40:42] because more and more confusion is being
[40:45] sowed in the earth
[40:49] and men are so confused that we find out
[40:53] they're going insane and don't know it
[40:56] they're going over their mind well
[40:58] insane in sin it's not too far apart so
[41:01] you just put that together and you'll
[41:03] understand see but it's going in that
[41:05] direction
[41:06] right now brothers and sisters
[41:09] confusion everywhere on the earth
[41:12] hallelujah and god's children
[41:17] amen
[41:18] should like i said be of the same
[41:20] character
[41:22] now
[41:23] back then
[41:25] we understand that god wanted to
[41:28] actually speak
[41:30] his children
[41:31] into
[41:32] existence just like he spoke adam
[41:37] into existence molded the body part and
[41:41] then spoke
[41:42] breathe
[41:43] the life in him
[41:46] god wanted to do it that way
[41:48] and the plan got up uh upended
[41:52] but he returned back to his plan like i
[41:55] said he placed mary there in history
[41:58] down the line so that the gods of this
[42:01] world or the evil one would be confused
[42:04] he didn't know what was coming he didn't
[42:06] know there was a plan of redemption he
[42:08] didn't know what god had in his mind so
[42:11] god carried out his plans and then we
[42:15] find out that uh
[42:17] god now is able through jesus christ
[42:21] coming on the scene
[42:22] to
[42:23] bring a new creation
[42:26] my father were credited to and now i
[42:28] work
[42:29] so here
[42:30] a new creation by what this spoken word
[42:34] of god
[42:35] the spoken word of god
[42:39] restoring back god's original life
[42:44] right by his spoken word so we find out
[42:48] that uh
[42:50] pause here for a moment jesus is the
[42:53] word all
[42:55] all of the word
[42:57] but what he typified on the day of
[42:59] pentecost with a pillar of fire breaking
[43:02] into small pieces was that god was now
[43:05] kind of placing himself into men and
[43:08] women that would believe his word and
[43:11] allow him to live in them dwell in them
[43:14] walk in them be their god and they are
[43:16] his people and he's living in them right
[43:19] on the earth
[43:21] his name shall be called emmanuel that's
[43:24] not just jesus back there but that is
[43:27] the living epistles of this hour when
[43:30] the spirit of christ strikes your heart
[43:32] lives within your being and moves you
[43:35] amen
[43:36] praise god i'm not talking about moving
[43:39] around with your nose stuck up in the
[43:41] air i'm a christian and walking around
[43:43] with uh
[43:44] religious pride uh that you're a
[43:47] somebody but in the humility of the
[43:49] spirit amen
[43:51] in the reverence of the holy spirit
[43:54] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[43:57] amen so the sons and daughters of god
[44:00] when we say they are born
[44:03] again
[44:04] they are born
[44:07] by his spoken word
[44:10] how shall they hear unless the preacher
[44:12] is sent see the preacher speaks the word
[44:16] and when he speaks the word which is
[44:18] god's seed life
[44:21] amen you receive that word of god within
[44:25] your heart
[44:26] and when you receive that word you
[44:29] believe it receive the word of god
[44:32] within your heart
[44:33] then you are impregnated by the word of
[44:37] god and by the spirit of god to bring
[44:40] forth the life of god
[44:42] amen oh praises marvelous and wonderful
[44:46] name amen
[44:48] now
[44:49] we know
[44:51] that if eve had stayed within god's
[44:54] original plan
[44:57] she would have brought forth the true
[45:00] word child
[45:03] in other words
[45:05] mary would not have had to be
[45:07] down the line
[45:09] jesus
[45:10] would have come
[45:12] way up there
[45:14] but because it was up ended here
[45:16] then you had to have this plan
[45:19] where later
[45:21] uh mary had to be
[45:23] down the line
[45:25] amen
[45:26] because remember god that was um
[45:28] that was god's intention
[45:31] because he'd already told her multiply
[45:33] and replenish the earth
[45:35] right so that he showed his intention
[45:37] was to do that
[45:39] and he was to do it by his word amen
[45:42] praise god so
[45:44] god's children are really
[45:48] his word
[45:49] made manifest
[45:52] the spoken word in a human life
[45:56] made manifest
[45:58] now you may not be conscious
[46:00] that you're a part of that word
[46:03] but you will find some things
[46:06] i'm speaking now humanly speaking um
[46:09] there's certain things you just can't do
[46:11] and you don't know why for myself i knew
[46:16] when i was just a boy at school and
[46:18] we'll be fighting and things like that
[46:20] and
[46:21] back in those days i don't laugh but we
[46:23] used to have slates
[46:26] and we'd have to write on the slate and
[46:29] then
[46:30] some guys would get mad break the slate
[46:33] and just whack hit somebody on the head
[46:35] cut them or cut into some of their body
[46:37] or something like that
[46:39] and for the life of me why can't i be
[46:43] like vicious like these other guys why
[46:46] can't i be a real man
[46:50] but
[46:50] something
[46:52] was holding me on the inside but i don't
[46:55] know what it was
[46:56] i could only go so far and no further
[47:00] and
[47:01] therefore you that made me be like a
[47:04] little loner so that kind of oh wait you
[47:07] see
[47:08] but my god
[47:10] we find out that god's children are not
[47:12] mixed up like the mule
[47:15] and then exactly who they are once he
[47:19] makes them conscious of who they are
[47:23] because you can be around in the world
[47:24] living the life of the world having a
[47:26] great time but god will one day stop you
[47:30] in your tracks and make you conscious
[47:33] of who you really are
[47:36] is that right
[47:37] yes your human being physically but on
[47:40] the inside there's a man inside there
[47:43] paul said this outward man may die get
[47:46] old go to the grave but the inward man
[47:49] is being renewed daily daily the word
[47:52] man is being renewed amen
[47:55] glory unto glory unto glory until one
[47:58] day it goes back to the glory from
[48:00] whence it came
[48:02] so here we find out that we are not
[48:05] mules
[48:08] we are god's sons and daughters
[48:12] because a mule doesn't even know who his
[48:14] daddy is
[48:16] he doesn't really know who his father is
[48:19] you find out that
[48:21] just being a church member
[48:23] they don't even know who god is
[48:26] they just say god
[48:28] and well god is just an object of
[48:30] worship which god are you talking about
[48:32] uh
[48:38] what are you talking about god just
[48:40] means object of worship right okay but
[48:44] god's children who they are who who
[48:47] their father is
[48:49] right oh my say well my father is god
[48:53] the father
[48:54] my father is
[48:56] god the son
[48:58] no i was born again by the holy spirit
[49:00] they've gone into that confusion the
[49:02] devil created that
[49:04] but we know that the bible tells us
[49:06] plainly hero israel
[49:09] the lord thy god is one
[49:13] one lord they're not two gods there's no
[49:16] tree gods
[49:17] amen once the devil can shift you off
[49:20] from god's word which is one god and he
[49:23] shifts you to believing too
[49:26] and gets you
[49:28] three then he might as well he can get
[49:30] you to believe a million
[49:32] he can get you to believe in thousands
[49:35] of god god for the weather god for for
[49:37] traveling god for sickness god for
[49:40] hunger god for pain a god for this and a
[49:43] god for that he can do all that
[49:45] and get you to believe that but the
[49:48] bible doesn't change it remains the same
[49:51] hero israel the lord thy god is one
[49:57] oh lord says marvelous and wonderful
[50:01] name so he doesn't even know who his
[50:03] daddy is but we know who our daddy is
[50:06] is that right that is why
[50:09] i'm named simon and that is why your
[50:12] name your family name and that is why we
[50:15] are called christians amen praise god we
[50:18] are not this we're not that we're not
[50:20] not denominationalists we're not a
[50:22] baptist we're not a methodist we're not
[50:24] the wonderful people but not
[50:27] understanding clearly the word of god
[50:30] amen amen praise god hallelujah amen
[50:34] praise god say oh but i'm a christian
[50:37] just like you that's wonderful and uh
[50:40] i'll speak with you i'll deal with you
[50:43] such praise god because we don't know
[50:46] who is who
[50:47] is that right why because you'll find
[50:50] out you can be in the same field but not
[50:54] of the same fold
[50:57] is that right
[50:59] what i'm thinking of is like you you get
[51:02] pigs and sheep
[51:04] feeding together in a field
[51:06] it doesn't make the pig turn into a
[51:09] sheep because he's in the same church
[51:13] they're all in the same church feeding
[51:16] on the same wheat that's left in the
[51:18] field feeding on the same word of god
[51:21] but it will never change that pig into a
[51:25] sheep
[51:27] the sheep had to
[51:29] be a sheep to begin with
[51:32] and you did not become a christian on a
[51:35] certain day
[51:36] you did not become a son of god on a
[51:39] certain day
[51:41] you had to have the same eternal quality
[51:45] that is in god himself
[51:48] why because god's eternal
[51:51] and every seed shall bring forth after
[51:53] its kind that is his own principle and
[51:56] if you are his seed his children then
[51:59] you have got to have that spark of
[52:02] eternal life in you and come to the
[52:05] earth with it in you already
[52:09] and all you need is an awakening
[52:12] to recognize your day your train the
[52:16] message of the hour of god i'll speak to
[52:19] your soul amen
[52:21] recognize your day in the message of
[52:24] your day hallelujah amen praise god
[52:30] you know
[52:31] because the the mule is not the torah
[52:33] bread to begin with
[52:35] he doesn't even know his pedigree
[52:39] he doesn't know
[52:40] his spiritual ancestry as far as it goes
[52:44] back but the true child of god knows
[52:46] their ancestry
[52:48] we come from god
[52:50] and we're going back to god
[52:53] is that right
[52:54] hallelujah we are not creatures of time
[52:57] we are creatures from eternity
[53:01] you come from eternity you're going back
[53:03] to eternity
[53:05] hallelujah
[53:06] amen god calls you children of god
[53:10] people don't understand the vastness of
[53:13] that statement he's telling you you're a
[53:15] chip off the old block
[53:17] or the old rock if you want to put it
[53:19] that way
[53:20] you see we come with his qualities in us
[53:24] but it takes the holy spirit the word to
[53:27] and the word to quicken us to who we are
[53:30] amen and that we have the ability to
[53:33] live up to our father's expectations
[53:36] amen praise god hallelujah
[53:39] so
[53:41] god in other words
[53:43] he used a woman in the beginning he was
[53:45] a woman in the middle of the bible
[53:47] god
[53:48] was showing he wants
[53:51] to use a church or the church
[53:54] to manifest himself
[53:57] to manifest his sons and his daughters
[53:59] to manifest his children
[54:01] bring them on the scene
[54:03] and let them live
[54:05] the way he wants them to live
[54:08] not to be
[54:10] a snake
[54:12] a crab
[54:14] or a toad
[54:15] that was caused
[54:17] jesus said a man cast
[54:19] a net into the sea and when he pulled it
[54:21] in it had all kinds of
[54:23] denizens of the deep inside of it you
[54:25] pulled them in and when he pulled them
[54:28] in um crab snake this that in there but
[54:32] the fact because they're in a net with
[54:35] rainbow trout or tilapia or whatever was
[54:38] in that net doesn't turn them
[54:42] by being in the church
[54:44] being in the confines of a church being
[54:47] religious doesn't turn them into a son
[54:51] or a daughter of the living god amen
[54:54] hallelujah amen praise god i'm glad that
[55:00] the son of god is identified by god
[55:03] himself
[55:05] manifesting himself through that son or
[55:08] daughter of god
[55:10] is that right
[55:11] now you just go back to the gospels and
[55:14] watch that thought in jesus christ
[55:16] himself he didn't what did he have to
[55:18] prove he didn't have to really prove
[55:20] anything because his whole walk his
[55:23] whole life was a manifestation of god
[55:26] working through him and making himself
[55:29] manifest through him and that identified
[55:31] him if the people wanted to see it
[55:33] identified him amen praise god and they
[55:37] were telling lies because uh they said
[55:41] we we are abraham's seed
[55:44] europeans above the devil and jesus just
[55:47] calmly turned to them said see
[55:50] you're of your father the devil
[55:53] in other words you're referring back to
[55:55] the beginning because he was there he
[55:57] knows everything so he says you're of
[55:59] your father the devil he's a liar to
[56:01] begin with and a murderer to begin with
[56:05] because abraham rejoiced
[56:08] which means abraham had a vision
[56:11] back there
[56:13] to see my day
[56:16] is that right
[56:18] see why he's the father of the faithful
[56:21] and he rejoiced
[56:22] it was so compelling to him it caused
[56:25] him to rejoice
[56:27] oh praise god and now you claim that you
[56:31] are sons
[56:34] children of abraham
[56:37] but you don't really have abraham said
[56:39] because you don't act like abraham you
[56:42] don't react to the word of god like
[56:45] abraham would have
[56:47] abraham rejoice to see my day rejoice to
[56:51] see the word coming
[56:53] right
[56:54] but but but you want to kill the world
[56:56] you want to
[56:58] take is bear false witness against the
[57:01] word you want to call him every other
[57:04] name except the word of god
[57:07] amen
[57:08] yes sir hallelujah so how can you be
[57:13] uh abraham's children amen uh they said
[57:16] hush up we don't need anybody to teach
[57:19] us the same spirit of the devil you know
[57:21] he thinks he already knows so god isn't
[57:24] gonna teach him anything whatsoever like
[57:27] that
[57:28] but you know this is all going to come
[57:29] to an end and it's going to wind up in
[57:32] the lake of fire
[57:34] amen
[57:36] just to think of it
[57:38] this uh world filled
[57:42] with spiritually
[57:44] illegitimate children
[57:47] claiming
[57:48] to be children of god
[57:51] or professing
[57:53] to be children
[57:54] of god
[57:56] amen
[57:58] jesus was so plain
[57:59] said you are of your father the devil
[58:02] and his works
[58:04] you will do
[58:06] exactly what works
[58:08] what works
[58:10] he's saying you'll do exactly what your
[58:12] father did now i want to bring a thought
[58:13] here see
[58:15] what did the devil do he high breeded
[58:19] you know the devil is into high breeding
[58:21] that's what he did he high breeded
[58:24] right when eve should have brought forth
[58:27] a pure sun
[58:29] she was hybrid
[58:32] and there that principle by breathing
[58:35] is brought down right
[58:38] through
[58:39] the jewish age right to this to the
[58:42] church age
[58:44] right mixing creeds
[58:47] and catechisms whatever else
[58:50] fundamentals whatever
[58:53] and using the mixing it hybriding
[58:55] because it's mixed in with the word of
[58:57] god
[58:58] but it's not the pure word of god
[59:01] it's not the true word of god
[59:04] watch what it produces what's coming out
[59:07] of it proves and shows what it is amen
[59:12] absolutely and i want to thank god that
[59:15] jesus came and died for us
[59:19] hallelujah that is why he said except
[59:22] the corn of wheat fall into the ground
[59:25] it will abide alone but if it goes into
[59:28] the ground it will come back up and then
[59:32] it will produce itself again a
[59:35] thousand-fold he was just speaking of
[59:37] the resurrection his deathbed and
[59:39] resurrection to come and that's what his
[59:42] life would do so that when he went to
[59:44] the cross and said he gave up the ghost
[59:47] hallelujah which i believe to be the
[59:49] holy ghost he gave up the ghost
[59:52] hallelujah three days and then he came
[59:56] that's it was jesus christ
[59:58] but the spirit that was in him now
[1:00:01] it's the same person it's not another
[1:00:03] person but he came back in the form of
[1:00:06] the holy ghost amen
[1:00:09] and then now now to this day he's
[1:00:12] available for all true believers
[1:00:17] it's not whether i tell you that you're
[1:00:19] a believer even if you were in this
[1:00:20] church for 40 years
[1:00:22] it's when he witnesses to your heart
[1:00:26] that you are a believer
[1:00:28] you know that you're a believer for
[1:00:31] yourself
[1:00:33] you have that conviction
[1:00:35] praise god hallelujah it's not my trying
[1:00:39] to
[1:00:41] persuade you it's not my trying to
[1:00:44] uh bring forth religious propaganda or
[1:00:46] or trying to sway you this we are that
[1:00:48] way no
[1:00:50] but it's you recognizing who you are
[1:00:53] it's you looking in the mirror of the
[1:00:55] word of god hallelujah and saying by god
[1:00:59] that's me
[1:01:01] amen that's me oh it's talking about me
[1:01:05] praise god why because that's the way
[1:01:07] god works
[1:01:09] hallelujah amen
[1:01:11] praise his name
[1:01:14] hallelujah
[1:01:16] and that's why the book of revelation
[1:01:18] tells us
[1:01:19] come out of her my people
[1:01:22] be not partakers of our plagues
[1:01:26] so that i have to judge you along with
[1:01:28] her
[1:01:29] and with the things that she is doing
[1:01:31] but back to the start he being the
[1:01:34] original seed
[1:01:36] he said i've got to be planted in the
[1:01:38] ground so that i can come back up
[1:01:42] manifest is that right
[1:01:44] wow
[1:01:45] he's talking oh this is wonderful
[1:01:48] marvelous brother danny talking about uh
[1:01:52] uh adam slept fella was put to sleep in
[1:01:55] the garden and then a
[1:01:56] wife taken from his side you know a
[1:01:59] ribbon around that you know then the
[1:02:01] scriptures speak of it he goes to sleep
[1:02:04] speak spiritually speaking on the cross
[1:02:07] and from his side blood and water comes
[1:02:10] out amen praise god and our life comes
[1:02:13] from his blood not the chemical that
[1:02:16] fell on the ground red
[1:02:18] but the life was in the blood
[1:02:21] hallelujah and when the blood came out
[1:02:25] it was a symbol for our eyes because our
[1:02:28] senses wouldn't pick up a spirit leaving
[1:02:30] him but he says
[1:02:32] the life came out his life came out and
[1:02:35] that life is now in this world available
[1:02:40] for every single one of us
[1:02:42] that can and would believe the word of
[1:02:45] god hallelujah amen you say well brother
[1:02:49] simon i'm i know i'm a believer
[1:02:52] i i am positive i'm a believer i believe
[1:02:54] i'm a christian a real christian that
[1:02:57] amen that may be good
[1:03:00] but the word of god has to identify you
[1:03:03] and will show you who you really are
[1:03:06] just like it said i believe it was abel
[1:03:10] that by faith abel
[1:03:13] knew
[1:03:14] what sacrifice to put on that altar
[1:03:17] amen
[1:03:19] why didn't he go and offer a fish
[1:03:23] why didn't he go
[1:03:24] offer up some uh
[1:03:27] you know a snake why didn't he go off a
[1:03:29] bird or something like that but it was
[1:03:32] revealed to him
[1:03:35] to put a lamb on that altar
[1:03:38] hallelujah
[1:03:40] but he could have put anything he wanted
[1:03:43] if he did not have a revelation
[1:03:46] but he did it by revelation
[1:03:48] that's why god's church jesus said is
[1:03:52] founded on
[1:03:53] revelation
[1:03:55] right and then oh praise god it says and
[1:03:59] then god
[1:04:01] testified of his gifts
[1:04:04] the fire came from heaven and burnt the
[1:04:06] sacrifice up
[1:04:08] proving it's not a balance gonna prove
[1:04:11] now it's god proving that abel was right
[1:04:15] abel's revelation was right hallelujah
[1:04:18] praise god so it doesn't even my talking
[1:04:21] here
[1:04:22] is the holy spirit will prove whether
[1:04:25] this is right
[1:04:27] praise god hallelujah amen glory to god
[1:04:31] of course you know the principle you
[1:04:33] reap what you sow
[1:04:35] is that right
[1:04:37] just imagine
[1:04:39] that you
[1:04:41] want to have
[1:04:43] limes and you go plant cucumbers
[1:04:46] you're planting cucumbers every seed
[1:04:49] must bring forth after its kind
[1:04:52] it's going to produce cucumbers
[1:04:55] not limes and if you were to tell people
[1:04:57] that they're going to think that that
[1:04:59] guy's
[1:05:00] he kind of losing
[1:05:03] something is getting uh empty up there
[1:05:06] as the west indians would say cockroach
[1:05:08] went into his ears and cut out his
[1:05:10] brains
[1:05:14] right
[1:05:15] so here it is
[1:05:17] you reap what you saw
[1:05:19] and if you plant cucumbers you're going
[1:05:22] to get cucumbers
[1:05:24] you can't get anything else
[1:05:26] because that's what it is
[1:05:28] you say well uh brother simon i don't
[1:05:31] know what you're talking about this is a
[1:05:32] different day
[1:05:34] that we're living in uh uh today but you
[1:05:37] know
[1:05:38] uh i read it some time ago i believe it
[1:05:41] was in time magazine many years ago
[1:05:43] that the the garners where
[1:05:46] joseph
[1:05:48] uh the pharaoh's tomb wasn't garner uh
[1:05:51] some of the wheat that was in the
[1:05:54] uh patriarch joseph's day
[1:05:57] was found in the pharaohs tomb
[1:06:01] thousands of years in the tomb they
[1:06:02] thought it was all dead
[1:06:04] but they decided to put it on some
[1:06:07] uh on blotting paper moist with water
[1:06:09] under it to cause it to see if it has
[1:06:11] any life to their surprise
[1:06:14] it brought forth a crop i'm not you know
[1:06:18] it's germinated and they were able to
[1:06:21] take it and uh create a crop from the
[1:06:25] wheat seeds that were sitting in there
[1:06:29] for thousands
[1:06:30] of years
[1:06:33] what i'm saying is
[1:06:35] thousands of years
[1:06:36] these wheat seed didn't change
[1:06:39] they didn't become some other seed
[1:06:42] it didn't become something else
[1:06:45] let me have a revised version of the
[1:06:47] seed here
[1:06:48] let me have the authorized version of
[1:06:51] the seed let me have this version that
[1:06:54] version no
[1:06:55] it's
[1:06:56] it's wonderful that man thinks like that
[1:06:59] but god's word does not change
[1:07:03] so let every man's word be a liar and my
[1:07:06] word be true
[1:07:08] because i'm god i can't change i can't
[1:07:10] lie
[1:07:12] i won't do these things your word
[1:07:13] remains the same amen
[1:07:16] but you see the houses change the
[1:07:18] dressing change the style change
[1:07:20] and then we try to change the word of
[1:07:22] god
[1:07:24] to suit that
[1:07:25] we want to make the word of god suit the
[1:07:28] changes civilization
[1:07:31] and society and culture brought along
[1:07:35] but we can't change the world because
[1:07:37] the word itself is god amen not speaking
[1:07:41] only of the written representation amen
[1:07:44] here we know it's the bible but god is a
[1:07:47] spirit
[1:07:48] right he can't change praise god so
[1:07:51] there we find out
[1:07:53] that women
[1:07:55] will want to start acting like men
[1:07:58] yeah right
[1:08:00] uh just yesterday i saw one return
[1:08:03] great big um heavy steel toe boots
[1:08:07] walking
[1:08:08] like that and you know talking like that
[1:08:12] and then
[1:08:13] i
[1:08:14] turned on the tv
[1:08:16] last night to
[1:08:18] um
[1:08:18] hear some of the
[1:08:20] um
[1:08:21] news that was on yesterday and
[1:08:25] later on there
[1:08:26] my back was turned i was doing something
[1:08:28] else and somebody was talking there and
[1:08:31] everything else and
[1:08:33] i turned her and it was a man
[1:08:36] a pure if my back stayed turned
[1:08:40] i would think that that was a woman
[1:08:44] but when i turned around and look it was
[1:08:46] a man what i'm saying
[1:08:48] is the seeds on this earth are all
[1:08:52] hybrid
[1:08:53] it's so mixed up on everything else
[1:08:56] that's naturally speaking and saying
[1:08:58] that to reflect spiritually speaking
[1:09:01] that's exactly also what is really
[1:09:04] happening upon the face of the world
[1:09:07] amen thank god
[1:09:09] as it's written on the wall behind jesus
[1:09:12] christ is the same
[1:09:14] yesterday today and forever hebrews 13 8
[1:09:20] amen he doesn't change
[1:09:22] the word does not change praise the lord
[1:09:26] uh
[1:09:26] i'll wrap things up here now praise the
[1:09:28] lord
[1:09:29] because we can go on talking like this
[1:09:32] and i can keep you until midnight and
[1:09:34] then you fall over
[1:09:36] but i may not be able to raise you up
[1:09:38] like paul did
[1:09:45] i have here and i'm going to quote it
[1:09:47] again
[1:09:50] let every man's word be a lie
[1:09:53] and mine
[1:09:55] be
[1:09:55] the truth
[1:09:57] thank god
[1:09:59] i believe that we all need to come back
[1:10:03] and be rooted
[1:10:05] and grounded
[1:10:08] securely in god's word alone
[1:10:11] so that we can
[1:10:13] manifest
[1:10:14] and bring forth
[1:10:16] god's life
[1:10:18] the life of god in this modern
[1:10:21] wicked chaotic age that we're living in
[1:10:25] like daniel we can still live godly in
