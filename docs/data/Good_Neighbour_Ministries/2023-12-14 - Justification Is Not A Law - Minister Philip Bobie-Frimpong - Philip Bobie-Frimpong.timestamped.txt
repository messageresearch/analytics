[13:39] oh God we pray in Jesus name amen
[13:44] amen we will enjoy the service last
[13:47] Sunday
[13:50] God okay so um without wasting much time
[13:55] I go to my scripture I have like three
[13:57] scriptures but I'm going back and forth
[13:59] fourth
[14:03] um okay is first scripture is Romans 7
[14:14] 1-6 and then Galatians
[14:17] 21621 Psalms
[14:21] 10312 said know you not brethren for I
[14:25] speak to them that know the law
[14:29] how that the Lord had OB over a man as
[14:31] long as he liveth question mark for the
[14:34] woman which had an husband is BN by the
[14:37] law to her husband so long as he liveth
[14:39] but if the husband be dead she's loose
[14:42] from the law of a husband um over here
[14:45] we are not legalistic we're not talking
[14:48] about marriage and divorce it's just
[14:50] that we're talking about the law and
[14:53] Grace and we know that some people got
[14:56] deceived into a marriage and other
[14:58] Factor say with some people stand on the
[15:00] way but that's not our main purpose it's
[15:03] mostly on Grace and uh thing so then if
[15:07] while husband leaveth she be married to
[15:09] another man she shall be called
[15:11] daughters but if her husband be dead
[15:12] she's free from that law so that she's
[15:15] not she's no adulterous though she be
[15:17] married to another man wherefore my
[15:20] brethren ye also have become dead that's
[15:22] the main thing to the law by the body of
[15:26] Christ that you should be married to
[15:29] another even to him who is raised from
[15:32] dead that we should bring forth fruit
[15:35] unto God for when we were in the
[15:39] flesh the Motions of sin which were by
[15:43] the law did work in our members to bring
[15:47] forth fruit unto
[15:51] death but now we are delivered from the
[15:55] law that being dead wherein we were held
[16:00] that we should serve in the newness of
[16:03] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[16:08] letter um Galatians
[16:27] 21621
[16:30] okay Galatians
[16:36] 2:21 knowing that a man is not justified
[16:40] by The Works of the law but by the faith
[16:44] of
[16:46] Jesus Christ that ye we might be
[16:49] justified by the Faith of Christ and not
[16:53] by The Works of law for by The Works of
[16:56] law shall no flesh be justified
[16:59] but if while we seek to be justified by
[17:03] Christ we ourselves also are found
[17:06] Sinners is therefore Christ the minister
[17:09] of sin God forbid for if I build again
[17:13] the things which I destroyed I make
[17:15] myself a
[17:16] transgressor for I through the law am
[17:20] theread to the law that I might live
[17:23] unto God I'm crucified with Christ
[17:26] nevertheless I live yet not I but
[17:31] Christ liveth but Christ liveth in me
[17:35] and the life which I now live in the
[17:37] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[17:40] God who loved me and gave himself for
[17:45] me I do not frustrate the grace of God
[17:48] for if righteousness come by the law
[17:51] then Christ death is in vain and Psalm
[17:53] 103 verse2 said as far as the East is
[17:57] from the West so far has he removed our
[18:00] transgressions from us heavenly father
[18:04] bless the reading of the word we commit
[18:08] the rest into your hand I pray that you
[18:11] close my lips from saying anything that
[18:14] you don't not want me to say but help me
[18:16] to say only thing that you desire me to
[18:19] say to bless and encourage and bless
[18:22] your children in the name of our Lord
[18:24] Jesus Christ amen please be
[18:26] seated so as we read about
[18:30] it there's a story that someone like
[18:34] Dwight Moody when he read about Romans
[18:37] chapter 7 he got so excited that when he
[18:42] went out the first man he met he asked
[18:44] him that do you know the grace of you
[18:46] know do you know Grace and the person
[18:48] that Grace what he said the grace of
[18:51] godallah Amen so it's more pertain to
[18:56] the grace of God is the law because most
[19:01] of the time people tend to stay with the
[19:04] law but when God giving them Grace they
[19:07] don't want to even get away from the law
[19:10] so God has given us Grace and as he
[19:15] Illustrated your first husband Eve H
[19:18] husband because we were born all from
[19:21] Eve because of what happen in the Garden
[19:23] of Eden we are being attached to this
[19:26] natural flesh but it's to say that when
[19:30] Christ comes into you when you receive
[19:33] the true birth then that that first
[19:38] husband is anal that first marriage is
[19:40] anal because a new creation you marri to
[19:43] Christ the second Adam who is the new
[19:46] what the new husband so all old things
[19:49] are passed away amen that's what the SC
[19:53] so we are married to Christ the word of
[19:55] God in the beginning was the word the
[19:57] word was made flesh and the Word was
[19:59] dwelt Among Us so that's what we are
[20:02] married to Christ that's what the bride
[20:05] of Christ is married to not to the first
[20:08] um husband because that first husband
[20:11] that nature is all in everyone that
[20:15] nature you want
[20:16] to is
[20:18] still um adultery all kind of stuff you
[20:23] fill with that first thing but when
[20:25] Christ comes into you what it you are
[20:28] delivered from all those like the woman
[20:30] at the world she was all her time was a
[20:34] prostitute but when Christ the word came
[20:37] to her we never see her going back to
[20:40] that prostitution that was what analment
[20:42] from her first husband so that's what we
[20:46] are trying to focus on deliverance from
[20:50] your first birth to your new birth and
[20:57] as is saying because God predestinated
[21:01] us it all comes about what it's a
[21:04] predestination because he said why it
[21:07] was put in there by
[21:09] predestination you were forain to be a
[21:12] Son of God you were in God before the
[21:15] foundations of the world invisible of
[21:18] the Christ paragraph
[21:19] 241 you were in God before the
[21:21] foundation of the world you were only
[21:24] manifested in the day of for his honor
[21:26] and Glory how can you do it without
[21:29] honoring his word and stand with every
[21:34] word of God yes sir which you are part
[21:37] of the word by predestination because
[21:41] look the God is the word you believe
[21:45] it well then if he always was the word
[21:49] in the beginning was the word and if the
[21:52] Word was God then you were in God
[21:55] Hallelujah the word the part that you
[21:57] were to play was in God before the
[22:00] foundations of this world he seen you he
[22:04] knew predestinated you to it so because
[22:08] of that seed God J in you but because of
[22:13] your first birth it becomes like
[22:15] sometimes mother or whatever it is it's
[22:17] like M Satan can put all kind of M
[22:20] around it but one day like the eagle
[22:23] story when he heard that voice of God he
[22:26] won't go back to that he recognized who
[22:29] he is so when he recognized who he who
[22:32] he is everything changed there's a me a
[22:36] Son of God I'm not going to live in this
[22:38] kind of life he moved from it so what
[22:41] I'm trying to say is that from all the
[22:46] beginning God is was given what Grace
[22:50] Grace
[22:51] Grace but Adam when the fall came they
[22:56] wanted to have something into it that's
[22:58] a religious he he he put a thck leaf
[23:02] around himself that's was a religion so
[23:06] a lot of people are hiding behind
[23:08] religion doing all kind of stuff but God
[23:12] said your religion that fig religion
[23:15] will not be accepted so he he killed the
[23:17] blood and that blood was even slain
[23:21] before the foundation of the world but
[23:23] he killed the blood and gave it to Adam
[23:25] to cover his nakedness but but because
[23:29] they when that happened they use the
[23:32] human blood the animal blood as
[23:35] sacrificial H sacrifice to what for
[23:39] atonement of their sin but that blood
[23:42] because it's less than human blood it
[23:46] didn't have the power to anal the sin so
[23:49] when they go back that desire was always
[23:53] there they go and cry to God and that
[23:56] desire is still there it doesn't leave
[23:58] them but when Christ came he made one
[24:01] sacrifice one sacrifice and that are not
[24:05] all sin and not all our first husband we
[24:09] have no part to deal with that anymore
[24:11] we are new creature in Christ and we
[24:14] have been delivered we have been
[24:16] Justified if we haven't even done it in
[24:19] the first place because it's not you
[24:22] that do the bad thing it's not you that
[24:24] did all those mistakes it's the devil
[24:26] the flesh that hasper that but the gene
[24:29] that seed that came from God that is
[24:32] sinless blameless there's no spot in it
[24:35] it's part of God it's attribute of God
[24:38] and that part cannot sin because it's
[24:40] God himself hiding behind the the the
[24:44] Sons and Daughters of God Amen praise
[24:52] God so
[24:54] God he realized that Adam could not keep
[24:58] the
[24:58] law so when he made a New Covenant with
[25:03] Abraham that Covenant was
[25:07] what not Abraham do this or do that if
[25:11] you do not do this because in the first
[25:14] commandment said that if you do not
[25:15] partake of if you partake of this you
[25:17] die but when he came to Abraham God
[25:20] sworn by himself it was unconditional
[25:24] Covenant he said I have sworn back
[25:27] himself and there's no one greater than
[25:30] God he is greater than everybody so he
[25:33] swor by himself by myself I will deliver
[25:38] you I will do this it was I will give
[25:40] you a son a unconditional promise that
[25:44] promise is for every true seed of Royal
[25:47] Seed of Abraham even now our covenant
[25:50] with God is Not By Law do this or do
[25:53] that or do that because one thing is
[25:56] human being that we always always want
[25:58] to have our hand to do something it's
[26:01] too hard for human being just let it go
[26:05] and let God take control we want to have
[26:08] a path to deal with it because if you
[26:10] read the Bible said that by Grace Moses
[26:13] by Grace Noah by Grace Al God gave Moses
[26:17] found Grace in the sight of God but the
[26:19] children of Israel following Moses they
[26:22] want something to do so God gave them
[26:24] the law and they couldn't keep the law
[26:26] and so they want to keep the law and
[26:29] when the Lord Jesus Christ was here he
[26:32] being the God himself in flesh talking
[26:37] to them they also wanted to have
[26:40] something the Lord they wasn't
[26:41] recognizing he said that if you do not
[26:44] believe me search the scriptures the
[26:47] scripture tells who I am but still they
[26:51] couldn't recognize that they were so
[26:53] much tuned in their own mind what they
[26:57] say what I do with it so they couldn't
[27:00] let it go and that has gone on and on
[27:03] and on and on from time M and it's even
[27:06] still going on now because God hasn't
[27:11] changed and the people hasn't changed
[27:14] God takes his Spirit he take his people
[27:17] but not the spirit so the spirit comes
[27:18] anoint different some The Same Spirit
[27:21] anoint different people at different
[27:23] times so the Jesus Christ is the same
[27:27] yesterday today and forever God has
[27:33] never changed so what am I trying to say
[27:37] what I'm trying to say is
[27:40] that in every
[27:42] age when God send someone with the word
[27:47] of God it becomes different to the
[27:50] people in their age but that word the
[27:54] way become different to them but that
[27:56] word is that said the
[27:58] Lord in the time of Moses it was
[28:01] different in the time of
[28:03] Noah Noah found Grace in the sight of
[28:06] God God told him to build an ark they
[28:10] haven't found it in such fashion before
[28:14] so what did they do they began to mock
[28:16] at him they began to do all kind of
[28:19] things at him mocking at him and doing
[28:22] everything and he preached for 120 years
[28:25] but that preaching was able to what get
[28:27] his family to believe what he was saying
[28:31] all the rest in the world it was
[28:33] different to them they didn't accept it
[28:37] and Moses exact same thing but we thank
[28:41] God there was Joshua and
[28:43] Caleb who took God by his word they
[28:48] didn't look at the conditions they
[28:50] believed God and they love God so much
[28:54] that their confidence was not was in God
[28:58] so when they went to see the spice they
[29:02] didn't look at how great those spice how
[29:05] giant they were their eyes was on the
[29:09] promise of God and on that promise of
[29:12] God it defies all logic it defies
[29:15] everything because God have said it and
[29:19] he will keep his word what cannot lie
[29:22] God cannot change so he honors all his
[29:25] word and if you are obey God because God
[29:30] is obligated only to his word the
[29:34] revealed word when I talk the word is a
[29:37] reveal what I'm talking about not just
[29:39] the letter because the letter kill but
[29:41] the spirit giveth life so God Hest his
[29:44] word so when that word you obey that
[29:47] word god becomes obligated also to you
[29:50] so it's offing is his word so when you
[29:53] obey that word and is revealed to you
[29:56] then God becomes obligated to you when
[29:59] that word was revealed to Abel God
[30:02] testified of his gift and the same thing
[30:05] God is doing now when that word is
[30:08] revealed to you and you manifest it God
[30:10] is going to testify that he is behind
[30:13] that so it's a reveal word that God
[30:16] honest it's not just the letter because
[30:18] the letter will kill you that letter is
[30:20] the one that they used to crucify the
[30:22] Lord Jesus Christ the same letter he was
[30:25] standing before them and they have read
[30:28] the Torah from years but they still
[30:30] couldn't recognize him being the word
[30:32] for the hour and that same thing is
[30:35] repeated itself in our day because he
[30:38] the same yesterday today and forever
[30:41] when the time came for them to receive
[30:43] his holy ghost when he gave himself to
[30:46] only 120 in the time of what um Israel
[30:51] in the time of Pentecost ear went up her
[30:54] room to receive a spirit it what it was
[30:57] was different to this people they
[30:59] haven't seen it in that fashion like
[31:01] before no wonder Granda said that Paul I
[31:05] all you almost persuaded me because
[31:07] agria hasn't heard it in that fashion
[31:09] before and in that fashion when it comes
[31:12] is the word of God but the people they
[31:14] become foreign to them they don't want
[31:16] to accept it but that's that said the
[31:18] Lord and he said that if you do not
[31:21] believe me you going to die in your sins
[31:23] amen what say what disbelief in his word
[31:27] there's only one thing is unbelief in
[31:29] God's word and if you believe in God's
[31:31] word you get everything you desire
[31:34] because in his word is everything's life
[31:37] amen so our god is awesome he's marching
[31:40] on with the word God hasn't stop he's
[31:43] the word is marching on so you got to
[31:46] match on with the tune of the word if
[31:48] you stay behind you'll be left behind no
[31:51] one that there will be a lot of people
[31:52] left behind because they left the word
[31:55] the reveal word for their day they
[31:57] looking back all the time and and look
[32:01] and saying something the for but they
[32:03] fail to recognize what God is doing in
[32:05] his present state of his ministry amen
[32:09] that's what the the secret lies that's
[32:11] what the strength lies that's why they
[32:13] that's what all the anointing everything
[32:16] that's why Abraham he was so bold
[32:18] because he recognized that he was
[32:20] fulfilling Mal 456 when you can so B and
[32:24] said I am the one fulfill revelation
[32:26] 10:7 Amos 3:7 all those scriptures Luke
[32:29] 17:30 you are so confident of that and
[32:32] all the word that you have been
[32:34] receiving that the prophet has preached
[32:36] to us all these years and the brothers
[32:39] in our
[32:41] church
[32:43] dtim BR Chris desm all everybody is
[32:46] going on what is he doing to you that
[32:49] word is what supposed to what give you
[32:51] faith and stand on the word of God we
[32:54] are not here to just um admire the word
[32:57] that is coming oh it's a good preaching
[32:59] and all that that's all night those days
[33:00] are gone you are here to apply the word
[33:03] of God because remember if you don't
[33:05] apply the token you're not going to get
[33:07] it all your children will going dead in
[33:10] the time of no in the time of Moses they
[33:12] have to apply the blood on the door post
[33:15] if that blood is not applied all your
[33:17] children your first born is dead and
[33:19] it's the same thing today you have to
[33:22] when you receive the word of is hearing
[33:25] recognize Lord and acting
[33:27] the portion the way that you have
[33:29] received how are you going to live it
[33:32] that said that some um lady who was the
[33:36] housewife the little that she received
[33:39] that she going to go through with that
[33:41] because it's not how much you know it's

[38:44] going to go back to um Romans chapter
[38:47] 7 verse 15-
[38:53] 24 Romans 7:15 to2 24
[39:03] for that which I do allow
[39:06] not for what I would that do I not but
[39:11] what I
[39:12] hate that do I if then I do that which I
[39:17] will not I consent unto the Lord that is
[39:21] it is good now then it is no more I that
[39:25] do it the sin that dwelt in me for I
[39:29] know that in me that is in my
[39:32] flesh dwelleth no good thing that's your
[39:36] first
[39:37] husband for to will is present with me
[39:42] but how to perform that which is good I
[39:44] find not for the good that I would I do
[39:49] not but the evil which I would not that
[39:52] I do now if I do that I would not it is
[39:55] no more
[39:57] I that do it but sin that dwelleth in
[40:03] me is it keep on going I think I find a
[40:07] new law that when I will do good evil is
[40:10] present with me for I Delight in the law
[40:13] of God after the inward
[40:16] man but I see another law in my member
[40:19] Waring against the law of my mind and
[40:22] bringing me into captivity the law of
[40:24] sin which is in my members
[40:27] oh Wretched Man that I am who shall
[40:29] deliver me from the body of this
[40:33] death I thank God through Jesus Christ
[40:35] Our Lord so then with the mind I myself
[40:38] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[40:41] the law of
[40:43] sin okay in other
[40:46] words just trying to let us know even
[40:50] since we are children there's always
[40:52] been the battle going on in our mind yes
[40:56] sir your conscience some sometimes you
[40:58] want to do this this one is fighting
[41:00] with this that is going on every time
[41:03] but as the Indian chief ST which one you
[41:08] feed on most that get what the victory
[41:13] so you have the right to
[41:16] accept the good things and move on with
[41:19] it and reject the bad ones it's not you
[41:24] that done that because in you that seed
[41:28] of God cannot sin but it's the flesh the
[41:31] path that has that F that has that PA
[41:35] that does that but that has no power
[41:37] over you you ignore it and feed on the
[41:41] true word of God what is happening is
[41:45] that some people they keep on
[41:48] digging and going back to your memory
[41:52] for the mistakes they did they don't
[41:54] want to set themselves free
[41:56] and feeding on all those things and
[41:58] thinking about how people did Bad Thing
[42:01] to them and they can't forgive and
[42:03] forget they can't forgive from their
[42:06] when someone deal with something wrong
[42:08] that bothers you as God use barad to
[42:11] speak that that time you have to pray
[42:14] and forgive that person and let it go
[42:18] you have to release that person once you
[42:20] pray and release that person you become
[42:23] free don't hold those things in your
[42:26] mind don't dig them and visit them going
[42:29] to make you miserable but if the
[42:33] victories that you have if the things
[42:35] that God revealed to you when God visits
[42:38] you when those good things that have
[42:40] spot in every Christian life that you
[42:43] always remember how God came to you
[42:46] there are so many things that the devil
[42:48] cannot take it away from even if you
[42:50] attacks you you can get back to and say
[42:52] what about this what about that what
[42:54] about this that God did to me what about
[42:56] this happened he going to run away from
[42:58] you because you a Son of God and God has
[43:00] given you evidence he has given you
[43:03] victories upon victories and Vis and
[43:05] reveal himself to you that's what Samson
[43:08] did when it came down that he was blind
[43:13] and everything was like he didn't know
[43:15] what to do and he saw that he has that
[43:18] mistake he began to think about the
[43:20] victory what God didn't to that was he
[43:22] was thinking about and when he was
[43:25] thinking of all those things then he
[43:27] said once more Lord let me die with my
[43:30] enemies so what I'm trying to I don't go
[43:33] and D past H past
[43:38] um P past sin and past mistakes but you
[43:42] can remember the good part and meditate
[43:45] on it because you have the
[43:48] right you have the right what you feed
[43:51] on what you think what you you think on
[43:54] that what forms atmosphere around
[43:56] brother said on Sunday so let's go dick
[44:00] let's not concentrate on those things
[44:04] and one other thing too our God is good
[44:08] God he honest his word he he keeps his
[44:12] word and one thing is like if you plant
[44:17] something you don't go and dig every
[44:20] week to see that thing is going to grow
[44:22] so it is with some people you pray and
[44:26] you believe and you move and you move on
[44:28] and you commit to God's hand
[44:31] amen commit to God and live it there but
[44:35] some people come so hard for them they
[44:38] always want to visit it because it's not
[44:42] how much you visit that going to bring
[44:44] it to pass but one Faith you believe in
[44:49] God you accept that way Lord this
[44:52] situation I commit to you like that
[44:54] Prophet that King did did he said that
[44:58] yes those people are what they are
[45:01] strong the Army is great they can do all
[45:04] this he just wrote a letter and give it
[45:07] to the Lord and leave the go and said
[45:08] Lord the battle is yours it's not mine I
[45:12] cannot fight the battle and God said the
[45:14] battle is mine I will fight your battles
[45:16] for you and he fought and they got what
[45:19] victory so all I'm trying to say tonight
[45:21] that any battle anything you facing
[45:25] leave it in in God's hand and leave it
[45:28] there leave it there Hallelujah don't go
[45:31] and visit it here I said that Jesus
[45:35] Christ is the
[45:37] same yesterday today and
[45:42] forever is that right in 20 years of
[45:45] research of the Bible and talking with
[45:47] the angel of the Lord and many
[45:50] things I find there is two things that
[45:53] is love and faith
[45:57] if you love God just purely
[46:01] unadulterated love you've got to have
[46:04] faith in him it to accompany Faith every
[46:10] time and when love and faith gets
[46:13] married you ask what you want to and you
[46:18] will have it that's when you know that
[46:21] your heavenly father cannot tell you any
[46:25] lie
[46:27] here is very important your heavenly
[46:29] father cannot tell you any lie he is
[46:33] God he can't lie and when you believe
[46:37] him with all your heart and you believe
[46:40] that what you ask for you ask it not for
[46:43] any selfish motive but your right motive
[46:46] behind there is ask it for the glory of
[46:50] God and believe without a shadow of
[46:54] doubt that your father wouldn't lie you
[46:57] something's going to take place when you
[47:01] get all the co out of the way and just
[47:04] look right straight there to Calvary and
[47:07] believe it with all your heart in other
[47:11] words we have to have
[47:13] confidence no matter what comes your way
[47:16] that the god that we are serving he
[47:19] cannot lie he cannot change you lie this
[47:23] one lie but nobody I lie but no God
[47:25] cannot lie he keeps all his appointment
[47:29] he keeps all his
[47:31] promises listen God
[47:35] satisfied desire of every living thing
[47:40] including the small animals the fish the
[47:45] um the fish the the the ants and he
[47:49] knows the every bite of their of their
[47:53] eyelid and everything even the heads on
[47:56] her

[48:14] you talk to us said I'll raise a prophet
[48:16] unto myself and he going to talk to you
[48:19] and then this Mighty God was so great
[48:22] that if you check in the
[48:26] Tabernacles the holy of
[48:28] holies those time you take only the high
[48:31] priest to go there once a year and even

[54:16] praise God
[54:19] hallelujah I'm not a long I don't speak
[54:24] for long so I'm going to read Galatians
[54:26] chapter 2 verse 20 and try to wrap up
[54:30] now Galatians 2 20 so I think I gave you
[54:36] the title my title
[54:39] was justification is not a
[54:44] law okay in Galatians
[54:49] 2:20 I'm crucified of
[54:53] Christ never delay L I live yet not
[54:59] I but Christ liveth in me and the life
[55:03] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[55:08] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[55:12] and gave himself for me in other words
[55:18] we have come to the place that we have
[55:21] he said come unto me all ye that is
[55:23] heavy laden and I will I will give you
[55:25] rest unto your soul so you have gone to
[55:28] that rest that Christ the life that we
[55:31] are living now is not you or me but
[55:35] Christ is the one that liveth in me and
[55:39] in you he's the same yesterday today and
[55:43] forever because he lives in you he lives
[55:46] in me and if he lives in you he lives in
[55:48] me as
[55:50] God send
[55:54] it
[55:59] as
[56:00] God spoke through
[56:03] Jeremiah and
[56:05] Daniel read Jeremiah writings what did
[56:10] he do to Daniel when he read that
[56:12] writings and he saw that the end was
[56:16] closer to come it put him under
[56:19] desperation to see
[56:21] God and at that desperation
[56:26] God show him everything that was going
[56:27] to happen to the end same thing applied
[56:30] to us God sent us a Vindicated prophet
[56:35] and if you are reading his writings and
[56:38] if you are checking the modern events
[56:41] being made clear by Vindicated prophecy
[56:44] nobody going to tell you that it's a
[56:46] desperate hour it's time for us to be
[56:49] desperate more for God because the B say
[56:51] if you SE me deligently with all your
[56:53] heart you shall find me because it's a
[56:56] desperate hour because all the things
[56:59] that we were expecting to come we have
[57:01] seen them fulfilling in our own
[57:05] eyes if we are seeing them I'm not
[57:08] trying to put any interpretation to what
[57:11] is happening back in Israel but if you
[57:15] can watch just last
[57:18] Sunday Saturday there were some people
[57:21] who even got an order from the police to
[57:25] go for what to the that Temple to go and
[57:30] make a demonstration to do something
[57:32] they wanted to do something over there
[57:34] and later on they take that permit from
[57:38] them they not allow them to do that
[57:41] demonstration but if you read by Daniel
[57:46] and even in Matthew
[57:48] 24: um I think 25 was so going he said
[57:51] that when you see the abomination of
[57:53] that coming then then it means that the
[57:56] end is near I'm not saying that they're
[57:58] going there to get rid of the temple and
[58:02] build the new Temple right now what I'm
[58:04] trying to say is that if you check
[58:06] before Jesus Christ was born there was
[58:09] anointing in the air and he put some
[58:12] people to act before the time Judas Maas
[58:16] and all those things they did all that's
[58:18] why gamia said that if this is of God
[58:21] when they arrested um Jesus Christ
[58:25] if it's God it will come to pass not
[58:27] from him it will not come to pass
[58:29] because they saw people arising and do
[58:31] that so when the thing is happening it
[58:33] brings the atmosphere in the air and
[58:35] people began to what act right so if
[58:38] your eyes are open you can see that we
[58:42] are in a desperate hour it's not time to
[58:46] joke the coming of the Lord picking up
[58:49] the bride is closer than we think and as
[58:52] our pastor has already taught us in
[58:54] every age the overlaps it doesn't come
[58:57] just like that it overlaps like that I
[59:01] read in the overlapping stage say is it
[59:04] the time when you see things going on so
[59:08] I encourage
[59:09] everyone let's be
[59:11] desperate
[59:13] because is a grace of God but we have a
[59:18] boundaries to be around that God has
[59:21] given us if you don't run within the
[59:23] boundaries of God
[59:25] um plan you are in trouble one time one
[59:28] Wednesday I wanted to come I I was
[59:30] supposed to preach over here and
[59:33] then I didn't know what to say a thought
[59:35] thought a thought came to me to preach
[59:38] about driving in your lane I said what
[59:42] what can I say about driving your lane
[59:44] so I just leave it and then I was that
[59:47] time I was leaving MGA I was just
[59:50] driving down the dandas coming I was
[59:54] right in my Lane and somebody came
[59:57] making a left turn he hit my driving
[59:59] mirror I said oh my God wants me talk
[1:00:02] about it what am I trying to say so I
[1:00:05] talk about it and then it blesses the
[1:00:07] Saints why because if you are driving in
[1:00:12] that lane you have room to play around
[1:00:15] that lane but if you go outside the the
[1:00:19] lane you are in trouble the guy went
[1:00:22] outside the lane he got accident he got
[1:00:24] fine he has to fix my driving mirror for
[1:00:27] me so as far as you are within the
[1:00:31] boundaries of God's word you are fine
[1:00:34] you are free in there to do anything you
[1:00:37] go outside it you got in trouble and
[1:00:40] some people also when they are
[1:00:44] driving you
[1:00:46] see because somebody's in front of them
[1:00:50] you can see that maybe the car is moving
[1:00:53] like that within the lane but it's is
[1:00:54] not being steady so they watch and they
[1:00:58] criticize that driver he's not a good
[1:00:59] driver meanwhile they don't know how
[1:01:01] their car is to is driving so the
[1:01:04] scripture is saying that um seek your
[1:01:08] own salvation with fear and tremble even
[1:01:11] as the time what approach as the time so
[1:01:14] it's a time that God is not giving you
[1:01:17] to be watch man of other people you
[1:01:19] examine yourself to see if you are in
[1:01:22] the faith examine your life EX I me your
[1:01:25] own self first and if you see somebody
[1:01:28] is going wrong you go on your knees and
[1:01:31] pray for
[1:01:32] them there's no need to gossip there's
[1:01:35] no need to this that let's pray and
[1:01:38] bound and be a true brothers and sisters
[1:01:41] love one another let Love Project When
[1:01:43] Love Project Grace takes over there's no
[1:01:47] time to gossip about people and all this
[1:01:49] and all that yes you see a lot of fault
[1:01:52] about me I I can see your fault but it's
[1:01:55] not what I'm concentrating on I'm
[1:01:58] concentrating on the gift the path that
[1:02:00] edifies me that's what important to me
[1:02:03] all those mistakes God will take care of
[1:02:05] it if you see you pray for the person
[1:02:08] unless it's a bad that you need then you
[1:02:11] go with somebody take the tell the deons
[1:02:13] or your pastor but let's examine
[1:02:15] ourselves let's consecrate ourself let's
[1:02:18] rededicate our life knowing that the end
[1:02:22] is near our time on this he is
[1:02:26] short and if there was ever a time that
[1:02:29] I want to live Asam said is this time
[1:02:32] because it's the Golden Age this is the
[1:02:35] time that all the culmination everything
[1:02:37] was he going to go to take us up to the
[1:02:40] Rapture because listen it's the most
[1:02:42] wicked
[1:02:43] age with a lot of demons and everything
[1:02:46] but it's also a glorious age because all
[1:02:49] the saints before us all of them are
[1:02:51] cheering for us all those Spirits is a
[1:02:54] head on Amen and we are Marching on so
[1:02:58] even though that when the enemy rise
[1:03:00] like a flag the spirit of God raise a
[1:03:02] standard so every time he rise up the
[1:03:04] spirit of raising a standard so we are
[1:03:07] the last end we are the last one and
[1:03:09] they all cheering let's let's press on
[1:03:12] let's let's let's run with the rest the
[1:03:14] patience set before us and go because
[1:03:19] nothing going to hinder us we are on our
[1:03:21] way to um can that BR to the can you
[1:03:24] please come so it's going home time amen
[1:03:28] praise God so all that I'm saying
[1:03:29] tonight let's cheer let's Dare for one
[1:03:33] another and examine
[1:03:35] ourselves and just let's consecrate our
[1:03:40] life more and let God have the prance
[1:03:43] and have the glory I'm done for
[1:03:53] tonight
