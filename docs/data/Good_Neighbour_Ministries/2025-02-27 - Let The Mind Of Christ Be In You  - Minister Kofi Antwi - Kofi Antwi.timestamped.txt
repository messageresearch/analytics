[19:14] while all what I would say go back and
[19:19] read and let the holy
[19:22] spirit that spoke Sunday speak to you
[19:27] get your portion
[19:29] on Sunday message amen because it was
[19:33] God that came down and spoke to US
[19:36] Direct amen uh I'm not saying that our
[19:40] pastor is not preaching every time he
[19:43] preach and I told him already I can see
[19:46] Christ in him but Sunday God came down
[19:51] to speak direct to us sometime he he
[19:54] will just keep the pastor aside and
[19:57] bring the former pastor and
[19:59] just bless us with his Blessing so I was
[20:03] so blessed on Sunday and I was saying
[20:08] what can I I was telling philli I says
[20:10] what can I bring even today but God
[20:14] knows because he have his children to be
[20:18] fed it's not because brother Kofi is
[20:21] holy or brother Kofi is righteous or
[20:23] brother kofy is so powerful it's all
[20:27] about Jesus
[20:29] only him when you came here tonight to
[20:31] see brother Kofi you won't get nothing
[20:34] but if you came here to see Jesus Christ
[20:37] he have something for you so let us all
[20:41] pull together tonight and rejoice in the
[20:45] Lord because our God is up to something
[20:49] big we can see the Fulfillment of
[20:52] scriptures we see even the pope is
[20:55] getting ready to go there I was watching
[20:58] watching him in the TV I saw they they
[21:02] tried to do his ceremony about his
[21:04] burier brother the man hasn't gone but
[21:08] they are propelling his H parade for his
[21:12] burier and things just imagine our God
[21:15] is not like that he's a living God that
[21:20] every day is alive and if you believe
[21:23] him you will be always alive that's why
[21:26] he says absent from this body be present
[21:29] with the Lord anyway let us stand up and
[21:32] glorify our King because National in
[21:36] time when we sing National in time we
[21:40] stand up so when we must we come
[21:43] together to read the word we must stand
[21:46] up for the word not for brother koffy or
[21:49] for the pastor or for anybody but for
[21:51] the word of
[21:53] God
[21:55] so my scripture
[21:58] I'll take it from Philippians
[22:03] 2:5 that's where I'm going to use
[22:08] today
[22:11] Philippians chapter
[22:13] 2 verse 5 it's just a short
[22:20] scripture let us bow our head and
[22:26] pray gracious Eternal Father father Lord
[22:30] Jesus once again father Lord God
[22:33] Almighty we give thee thanks we give
[22:37] thee praise father Jesus forgive us of
[22:41] our sins Lord God
[22:45] Almighty Lord you know I'm the least in
[22:49] the kingdom of God
[22:51] father I don't even sometime understand
[22:55] myself why you chose me because father
[22:59] you know that I myself know that I don't
[23:03] know nothing and if you don't come it
[23:07] will be a disaster but father I'm not
[23:10] trusting myself I'm trusting in you that
[23:14] you will come and take my lips and speak
[23:18] true because Lord you promise us that
[23:22] you will never leave us nor forsake us
[23:24] let the word be a blessing to each and
[23:27] everyone
[23:29] of us here tonight those that are
[23:30] listening online that they will also be
[23:34] blessed each and everyone will get their
[23:36] portion it's not because of brother Kofi
[23:39] but it's all about Jesus father draw
[23:42] nigh in Jesus name we pray amen
[23:47] amen okay Philippians chapter
[23:51] 2:5 let this man be in you which was
[23:55] also in Christ Jesus
[24:00] please s sit
[24:07] down you know we live in the day when
[24:10] the
[24:12] enemy if you are not watching you are
[24:15] bright the devil know we are all bright
[24:18] those that were chosen before the
[24:20] foundations of this world but what he
[24:24] will do to you is once you are on the a
[24:28] here
[24:29] he want your
[24:31] mind he don't want you to manifest
[24:35] Christ he want you to manifest
[24:38] him so the only way you can do is always
[24:44] concentrate yourself towards Christ
[24:47] because if you concentrate your mind
[24:50] towards Christ word you'll be able to
[24:54] accomplish what Christ want you to
[24:57] accomplish other otherwise you'll be
[25:02] bombardment because let me tell
[25:06] you even sometime when sickness hit you
[25:10] or poverty hits you or your children are
[25:15] so far away from serving
[25:19] God and you look you may say why am I a
[25:25] Christian believing God but
[25:29] but why this tries coming to me why am I
[25:35] so have I done something
[25:38] wrong have
[25:40] I misinterpret
[25:43] God no brothers and
[25:47] sisters it's nothing but the devil
[25:50] trying to take your
[25:52] mind because
[25:55] recognize 24 hours God is in
[25:59] you if you recognize like that no matter
[26:03] how the enemy
[26:05] comes right he will not able to take
[26:10] your mind to fulfill his
[26:12] way but you will fulfill the master word
[26:17] that he has sent you here to do because
[26:23] remember everything that you need is
[26:26] already provided
[26:29] amen
[26:31] Jesus has already provided everything
[26:35] that you need even if you are sick and
[26:38] Jesus is standing here physically and
[26:41] you goes to him and say Lord Heal me he
[26:43] cannot do it he can't why because he
[26:47] will tell you I've already done
[26:50] it I've already healed you already so it
[26:54] is up to you to claim
[26:58] your healing it is up to you to claim
[27:03] your children it is up to you to claim
[27:07] your Prosperity it is up to you to say
[27:11] Lord I am your son I am your
[27:15] daughter by Your
[27:18] Word nothing shall harm me amen by your
[27:23] word I can defeat the enemy Hallelujah
[27:27] by your
[27:28] word I am not afraid of anything that
[27:32] comes to me by your
[27:35] word the devil can do nothing yes sir
[27:39] because it's Jesus when he was here he
[27:44] defeated
[27:46] Satan by the
[27:49] word and how do you
[27:52] think you can defeat Satan
[27:57] today my brother just said it by the
[28:00] word the same way Jesus defeated
[28:04] him you it is your
[28:07] turn God is a finished work salvation is
[28:11] a finished
[28:13] work listen not because we came to this
[28:18] message that's why and even God baptized
[28:21] that's why we we we seeing God if you
[28:25] are God son or god daughter since you
[28:29] born because the Bible says gifts and
[28:32] calling are without what
[28:36] repentance God was revealing things to
[28:38] you here and there here and there here
[28:40] and
[28:42] there
[28:44] before a time will
[28:47] come then you will recognize no there's
[28:51] I'm
[28:52] different I'm different like as our
[28:55] former Pastor was saying even one he was
[29:00] young he used to
[29:03] see himself he will be in a crowd and
[29:06] he'll feel like he's
[29:08] lonely why he's he recognized that
[29:13] no I'm
[29:16] different don't you know
[29:19] God was even showing him I'm using him
[29:22] as example that he was
[29:26] different let me tell you
[29:28] brother Braham says every check there's
[29:31] three class of
[29:33] people if you are the bride of Christ
[29:37] the pastor don't have to tell
[29:40] you the Deacon don't have to tell you
[29:43] anybody don't have to tell you within
[29:46] you yourself between you and the Mighty
[29:48] God you
[29:50] know that you are a child of the
[29:54] king you know how do you know it
[29:59] God him will testify himself in you
[30:04] amen not just you come to
[30:09] church what did the Bible the scripture
[30:11] says it says to Jeremiah before even you
[30:16] were in your mother womb I knew you I
[30:20] ordain you
[30:23] right orain or even getting saved it
[30:28] just come by
[30:29] today you were chosen before the
[30:32] foundations of this world you are part
[30:36] of the pill of fire put into a body in
[30:41] the flesh now is your time that you are
[30:45] manifesting as a woman being this is
[30:49] just like you are in a put it this way a
[30:52] share but the main spirit that is in you
[30:56] came from God if you are
[30:59] bright so God is telling you recognize
[31:04] that recognize it and take authority you
[31:09] have power more than Satan amen don't
[31:12] you know when Satan was create created
[31:16] you were there you saw everything about
[31:20] him but he can never see everything
[31:23] about
[31:24] you do you know that because you are
[31:27] eternal
[31:28] if you are a bride you are Eternal so
[31:32] when you were there you were
[31:34] Eternal so Satan don't
[31:37] know you he knows only this but he don't
[31:42] know who really live in you come on
[31:45] because the one that live in you is
[31:47] eternal it's portion of the pill of
[31:51] fire and the only how can he defeat you
[31:57] God is they recognize who you
[32:00] are and if you are portion of God let me
[32:05] tell you you can run even in the body
[32:10] you try to run but you cannot hide the
[32:13] Holy Spirit the Deep call to the deep
[32:17] and the Deep must respond as the word
[32:21] been
[32:22] preached it's not brother Kofi or
[32:25] brother Simon or brother ch or Pastor
[32:28] dannyel or brother Tim or Phillip or
[32:33] whoever comes here it's all about Jesus
[32:38] Christ and if it is Jesus Christ he know
[32:43] how to take the preacher
[32:45] Tong without the preacher knowing it and
[32:50] let the word come and search your
[32:53] heart and if there is a pill of fire
[32:56] there inside you amen
[32:58] that word will go through like
[33:01] a like a surgeon doing
[33:05] operation and that word will go through
[33:09] that your heart to call that seed that
[33:13] is hidden in you and you can run you go
[33:17] home sleeping he will that voice will
[33:20] speak to you you'll be
[33:24] crying you go to work that voice will be
[33:27] speaking to you you are walking that
[33:30] voice will be speaking to you that voice
[33:32] won't leave you
[33:34] until you come to the water and repent
[33:38] and surrender to Jesus Christ in Acts
[33:43] 2:38 but if you are not part the
[33:46] preacher May preach preach preach preach
[33:48] preach nothing will come
[33:51] out but if you are part of God myship
[33:56] hear my voice
[33:58] yes sir a stranger they will never
[34:01] follow stranger doesn't follow the voice
[34:04] of God who are those
[34:08] strangers that's the devil
[34:11] children because when your father call
[34:15] you you you know your father voice you
[34:18] know your mama voice right you don't
[34:21] know a stranger voice Jesus when he was
[34:24] here he says I know my sheep my sheep
[34:27] know my voice voice you are part of him
[34:31] that's why you have come to hear the
[34:35] word of God Amen that's why you believe
[34:38] the prophet William Braham take William
[34:42] Braham message to the world how many
[34:44] people are responding but look our
[34:47] pastor he was going to buy furniture he

[41:46] I'm saying to you and I challenge you by
[41:49] the the power of
[41:52] God what brother Brown preached is the
[41:55] truth but the the message is carrying
[41:59] on is writing on the prophet has turned
[42:05] the Bon to us you and me so let us
[42:11] believe what the prophet
[42:14] spoke that has brought Christ on the
[42:18] earth Christ is now in you he's trying
[42:22] to tell you surrender to me like suay he
[42:26] was saying I don't need nobody God don't
[42:30] need nobody
[42:33] education God don't need nobody's
[42:36] smarted
[42:38] mind you understand sometime he want you
[42:41] to be like you you look into the people
[42:44] like a
[42:45] dummy do you know that God will let you
[42:48] look like a
[42:50] a a dummy in front of the people like
[42:54] you don't know nothing that's what I'm
[42:55] trying to say
[42:58] okay and the people take Glory ah this
[43:00] brother don't know nothing this sister
[43:02] don't know nothing and God will get the
[43:07] glory I remember sometime when I came to
[43:10] the message first I go at work people
[43:14] ask me questions you said you are
[43:16] Christian this that that and I tried to
[43:18] answer them and all of a sudden I I
[43:22] can't my mind
[43:24] block and I went to washroom and I'm
[43:27] sitting down there say oh God forgive me
[43:30] I don't know what to say and I thought
[43:33] the questions they are asking will just
[43:36] drop on my mind and I
[43:38] just watch myself come to them and tell
[43:43] them the answer that they
[43:46] were the question they were asking me
[43:49] that they themselves know that I don't
[43:51] know God will give me the right answer
[43:54] and and they shock my friend they used
[43:57] to be shock how did you know
[44:00] that that's the way that it is because
[44:04] why when you surrender to the one that
[44:08] live in you now now you know who live in
[44:11] you he will overcome Satan for
[44:15] you he will Ambush him for you he will
[44:20] do the work for
[44:21] you because Jesus when he was here he
[44:27] know who he is he know his purpose
[44:30] that's why he came here for so you
[44:35] now the message has come to
[44:38] you and always
[44:41] recognize who you are God want you to
[44:45] know that if you recognize who you are
[44:49] no matter what happen to you Satan
[44:53] cannot defeat you amen no no matter
[44:58] what because take
[45:02] Jesus as your
[45:05] example if you take Christ as your
[45:09] example did Satan conquer
[45:13] him Satan couldn't conquer
[45:16] him and he has promised
[45:19] you he said I will never leave you nor
[45:23] forsake you I will be with you in you to
[45:28] the end of the
[45:31] world he didn't said I'll be with you
[45:34] half of the world he didn't said I'll be
[45:37] with you cut out of the world so as long
[45:40] as you are in this world and the Rapture
[45:43] hasn't taken place no matter how you
[45:47] think recognize that God live in you and
[45:53] once God live in you Jesus live in you
[45:56] you'll be able to conquer the
[45:59] devil let me tell you me I'm not scared
[46:04] of
[46:05] nothing nothing I am not scared of
[46:08] nothing no more through Christ I can do
[46:12] all things through Christ I can overcome
[46:17] every Temptation the devil will bring
[46:20] upon me and so is
[46:23] you so recognize that

[53:46] living in the day of
[53:48] intellectual yes it's not quote
[53:52] unquote will take us to
[53:55] Heaven it's not not how we think we
[53:59] know the te based on Christ Christ the
[54:04] Lord he has done it for
[54:07] us right he have his way like as our
[54:11] pastor was
[54:13] saying every preacher that God has
[54:16] ordained he have a certain ways they
[54:19] talk they do you may not like it you may
[54:23] not think they know too they don't know
[54:25] nothing it doesn't matter how much they
[54:30] know it's whether Christ is in
[54:33] him
[54:35] or Christ is not in
[54:38] him because he ordained them for certain
[54:43] way right sometime I'm sitting down
[54:46] there and I I says to myself Lord why do
[54:50] you even call me to
[54:51] pophead I can't even speak you know how
[54:55] I struggle to read the Bible if you only
[54:59] know to read the Bible is a big
[55:03] like I can't even explain it right one
[55:08] time the Lord told me he says scovi I
[55:11] can let you read the Bible from Genesis
[55:13] to Revelation it just opened my mind
[55:16] boom and I can see I was reading so easy
[55:22] and all of a sudden it
[55:24] Clos it BL do my then he left some part
[55:29] for me and sometime I pick it I see here
[55:34] I know it turned like a preaching for me
[55:37] I says what is this I don't
[55:42] know when I was in school I was no
[55:45] good it's not that my family are
[55:48] literate or something no but I I can't I
[55:52] couldn't understand
[55:54] it but now
[55:57] I
[55:58] know I'm so happy I'm so thankful unto
[56:03] the Lord I'm so trusted in him oh you
[56:08] can call me whatever you want I don't
[56:11] care I don't truly because I see the
[56:18] light like Moses when the Lord spoke to
[56:21] him in the burning bush you think Moses
[56:24] care about what you think about him
[56:27] you think Moses will be afraid of going
[56:31] to pharaoh to take Egypt no because he
[56:35] has made a
[56:37] king all my doubt all my problems has

[57:18] it but I said in my
[57:22] heart I am not going to grave yet unless
[57:25] the Lord said
[57:27] so unless Jesus said
[57:31] so but someone was talking about cancer
[57:34] going days going do you know last time I
[57:37] testify about they they checked me put
[57:41] me into a machine inject me let me go
[57:45] home come back

[1:07:09] wonders than
[1:07:12] God brother Braham God sometime the
[1:07:16] message people they think oh it's just a
[1:07:20] message another church this is not a
[1:07:24] church this is God's Own people that he
[1:07:29] love he came here to die to demonstrate
[1:07:34] because you have people that are part of
[1:07:37] him that because the serpent sodu Eve we
[1:07:41] are trapped in a body so he have to come
[1:07:45] here to pay the price to redeem us so
[1:07:49] that put it in the paper book form so
[1:07:54] that when we come here he know the world
[1:07:57] will be so
[1:07:59] scientific that we have to some we have
[1:08:02] to read it but the more they read it
[1:08:06] then and and take it by Revelation B by
[1:08:11] bit it revealed to them who they are and
[1:08:15] we who can read as Pastor
[1:08:19] Simon Pastor
[1:08:21] Danny who has
[1:08:24] ERS and all the other brothers as they
[1:08:27] preach and I'm sitting in the bench for
[1:08:30] so
[1:08:32] long what does he do it bring my my
[1:08:35] position it bring God to me he reveal
[1:08:39] Christ to me then I begin to see
[1:08:43] myself all right when
[1:08:47] Jesus preached to Peter that was spoken
[1:08:51] word slowly slowly Jesus telling him he
[1:08:56] revealed to
[1:08:57] himself oh so I'm not just a Fisher mind
[1:09:02] I'm not just going to sit in the bench
[1:09:04] and warm the
[1:09:06] bench I am not a bench
[1:09:10] warmer but I am one who will carry the
[1:09:13] the Bible and and speak God
[1:09:16] word and preach the
[1:09:20] gospel I didn't ask for it never I don't
[1:09:24] even ask as for that it just come to
[1:09:28] me God just give it to
[1:09:31] me let me tell
[1:09:34] you that's why you you see people
[1:09:37] rushing to the pulpit God hasn't called
[1:09:40] them a true preacher doesn't
[1:09:44] Rush as a matter of fact they stay be
[1:09:47] away from the
[1:09:48] popit but if you are one that God is
[1:09:53] calling no matter what
[1:09:55] what you're going to come if you are one
[1:09:59] that God is calling you to be
[1:10:02] saved you can run but you cannot
[1:10:06] hide you're going to
[1:10:08] come because not one hoof of God's
[1:10:13] children is going to be
[1:10:15] lost because you know what
[1:10:19] sometime some
[1:10:21] people like you visit this church
[1:10:26] and even
[1:10:28] go but the word that is

[1:10:50] already
[1:10:51] there you can go wherever you want
[1:10:56] it going to bring
[1:10:57] you because why we are prophecy in this
[1:11:02] world do you know you are a
[1:11:05] prophecy do you recognize
[1:11:08] yourself that you sitting here you are a
