[40:07] turn our attention to the word of god
[40:10] giving him all the glory and the
[40:13] honor and praise and our
[40:17] text will be found
[40:21] in genesis 1
[40:32] and we'll read verse
[40:36] 3 and then verse 14
[40:41] genesis 1
[40:44] and god said let
[40:48] there be light and there was light
[40:53] verse 14 and god said
[40:58] let there be lights
[41:01] in the firmament of the heaven
[41:04] to divide the day from the night
[41:09] and let them be for signs
[41:13] and for seasons
[41:16] and for days and years
[41:21] now we will turn to
[41:24] john chapter 1 and we'll read from
[41:28] verses
[41:28] 1 to 14.
[41:36] in the beginning was the word
[41:40] and the word was with
[41:44] god and the word
[41:48] was god the same
[41:51] was in the beginning with god
[41:56] all things were made by him
[41:59] and without him was not
[42:03] anything made that was made
[42:07] in him was life
[42:12] and the life was delight
[42:16] of men and the light
[42:19] shining into darkness
[42:23] and the darkness comprehended it
[42:29] not
[42:32] there was a man sent from god
[42:35] whose name was john this same
[42:39] came for a witness to bear witness
[42:43] of the light and all men
[42:46] through him that all men through him
[42:50] might believe he was not that light
[42:55] but was set to bear witness of that
[42:58] light
[43:00] that was the true light
[43:03] which lighted every man
[43:06] that commit into the world
[43:10] he was in the world and the world was
[43:14] made by him and the world
[43:19] knew him not but as many as received him
[43:24] to them gave ye power to become
[43:29] the sons of god even to them
[43:32] that believe on his name
[43:36] which were born not of blood
[43:40] nor of the will of flesh nor of the will
[43:44] of
[43:44] man but of god
[43:48] and the word was made flesh
[43:51] and dwelt among us and we
[43:55] beheld his glory the glory
[43:58] as of the only begotten
[44:02] of the father full of grace
[44:06] and truth amen gracious
[44:10] father we have just read the word
[44:14] and as you have said revelation
[44:18] faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[44:22] by the word of god granted to us
[44:25] now as we wait upon the father
[44:29] in jesus name amen
[44:32] god bless you please be seated
[44:39] now last sunday we spoke on the subject
[44:42] of god's great shining light
[44:46] how many of you were here praise god
[44:49] god's great shining light
[44:52] and we brought to your attention
[44:56] how that god was alone
[45:01] as he inhabited
[45:04] all of eternity god
[45:08] in the darkness by himself
[45:12] all alone and the bible tells us
[45:17] and the earth which was
[45:20] already there was
[45:23] without form and void
[45:26] you see between verse one and two uh
[45:30] which i would take the time to explain
[45:33] uh that's where this scientist gets all
[45:35] mixed up
[45:36] because millions of years could have
[45:38] passed between there
[45:39] in the beginning god created the heavens
[45:41] and the earth
[45:43] period and then we don't know how long
[45:46] that is
[45:47] and then it says and the earth was
[45:49] without form and boy
[45:52] so we do know from uh
[45:55] as i said dr pember other um
[45:59] writers uh of that nature
[46:02] that the earth was in a chaotic state
[46:07] from some previous uh primordial
[46:10] uh upheaval that took place
[46:14] the world was in a terrible state at
[46:17] that time
[46:19] from earth's el earliest ages
[46:23] in genesis 1 though the bible tells us
[46:26] that god's holy
[46:28] spirit god's spirit began to move
[46:31] on the face of the waters over all of
[46:34] the chaos
[46:36] god's spirit began to brood
[46:39] right because that would be the word
[46:43] that you would have but it says god's
[46:45] spirit
[46:46] move but god's spirit brooded like
[46:49] him trying to bring forth something
[46:52] to make something come alive god's
[46:56] spirit
[46:57] moved or brooded on the face
[47:00] of the deep amen and that's the same
[47:04] thing he does with
[47:05] every sinful heart that's in a chaotic
[47:09] confused
[47:11] uncontrolled state the spirit of god
[47:14] comes to the individual and begins to
[47:18] move
[47:19] over their life over their soul they may
[47:22] not yet
[47:23] understand what is happening but it's
[47:26] god's spirit moving trying to
[47:29] shape form and to create something
[47:33] that will live and do according to his
[47:36] will
[47:38] then in john
[47:41] in genesis 1 3
[47:44] the bible tells us for tells us
[47:48] that before he created the moon
[47:52] and the stars god spoke
[47:55] out of the darkness let there be light
[48:00] yes amen and the bible tells us
[48:03] there was light but then when we go
[48:07] on after the creation of many of the
[48:10] other
[48:10] species we get to verse 14
[48:14] where he said and let there be
[48:17] lights not one light
[48:20] but lights in the heavens
[48:24] the amen to be four times
[48:27] so you can be able to count time while
[48:29] so many years past
[48:31] so many sundowns so many moons or
[48:34] whatever
[48:34] you'll be able to count time you'll be
[48:37] able to know
[48:38] seasons right you'll be able to
[48:41] recognize those things
[48:42] but first light was not for that purpose
[48:45] but
[48:45] this these lights they are
[48:48] for this purpose to the earth
[48:52] okay now we understand therefore
[48:57] and we try to make clear to you that
[49:00] that first light
[49:02] was totally different from
[49:05] this second set of lights
[49:08] that god created amen
[49:12] one of course was spirit
[49:15] light spiritual light amen praise god
[49:18] and they're proving now that that's a
[49:21] fact
[49:22] because they have actually um used some
[49:25] kind of an instrument
[49:28] on uh oral robert's hand when he was
[49:31] praying for the sick
[49:32] and they could see life coming off
[49:35] of the man's hand amen they have other
[49:39] things where they're
[49:40] whole persons and they could see
[49:44] light emanating from the person's being
[49:47] and of course brother branham's was
[49:49] obvious he was standing right there with
[49:51] your natural eyes you could see it
[49:53] you didn't need a machine for that but
[49:55] they
[49:56] realized that there is some form
[50:00] of other light let's not talk about
[50:02] tesla and all that because he was
[50:04] already
[50:05] breaking into god's laboratory right
[50:08] because he everybody knows that well no
[50:12] everybody doesn't know that
[50:13] but the man was working most of his
[50:16] stuff by the number three because he
[50:18] knows there's something
[50:19] about three and everything he did he did
[50:22] with a lot of trees
[50:24] and multiplied the vision and whatever
[50:27] he did
[50:28] use a lot of trees amen but anyway
[50:31] they started to break into these things
[50:36] but god had spiritual light
[50:40] and in reading some of uh the
[50:43] backgrounding for
[50:45] what we're talking about here because
[50:47] what i'm talking about
[50:48] here is not something that i
[50:51] learned my bed and i got a big
[50:53] revelation remember
[50:55] the prophet william marion branham of
[50:58] malachi 4
[50:59] 5 and revelation 10 7
[51:02] uh put all of this into the storehouse
[51:07] you can read volume 1 of conduct
[51:09] ordering doctrine
[51:11] around the starting right
[51:14] through 15 16 17 the pages
[51:18] and you'll read most of this there i'm
[51:20] just putting
[51:21] understanding knowledge on to what is
[51:24] already there
[51:26] in other words you may go read it and
[51:28] you may not see all of what i'm saying
[51:30] but i'm just saying it so when you go
[51:32] back and you look at it
[51:34] it opens up and it blossoms forth amen
[51:38] all i'm doing is what we are supposed to
[51:41] do
[51:42] the the sheep eats the the food
[51:45] and then takes it and sits
[51:49] underneath a tree and then
[51:52] regurgitate it oh i'm i want to tell you
[51:56] what we're having is regurgitated holy
[52:00] ghost school
[52:01] the holy spirit granting to you
[52:04] amen because great men of this
[52:08] message have broke into pieces and
[52:11] pieces and
[52:12] parts of this but the earth
[52:15] has come in the power of god where the
[52:18] holy
[52:18] spirit is taking the word and the word
[52:22] is beginning to take form
[52:25] amen not only the revelation of the word
[52:29] but the word is starting to take its
[52:31] form
[52:32] amen the word you believe within your
[52:35] heart
[52:36] will one day become personalized before
[52:39] you
[52:39] amen you'll recognize it's god
[52:42] making himself manifest amen by the
[52:46] unveiling
[52:47] of the word amen praise god
[52:50] one light of course was god himself
[52:55] the unseen spirit for when god
[52:58] said let there be light out on himself
[53:03] came forth brother brennan describes it
[53:08] a little halo of light began to whirl
[53:11] around
[53:12] amen and here it goes it began to whirl
[53:16] around
[53:17] and there comes the pure of fire amen
[53:20] there comes the logos there comes it my
[53:23] brother sister
[53:25] hallelujah forming itself
[53:28] into something that the eyes can now see
[53:31] and perceive and and god
[53:35] called it light amen but now
[53:38] he made himself now that you can't start
[53:41] seeing him
[53:42] in his first form amen
[53:46] now that was going to condescend down
[53:49] through the ages and we know
[53:52] that after centuries and ages it
[53:56] culminated into the person
[53:59] of the man christ jesus
[54:03] god in christ amen hallelujah
[54:07] and now in our day it's taken
[54:10] another step hallelujah
[54:13] because just as the wife had to be taken
[54:17] from adam
[54:18] a bride is taken from the word of god
[54:22] that he could make himself manifest
[54:25] one more time through his people who are
[54:28] the children
[54:29] of that light oh blessed be the name of
[54:33] the lord hallelujah
[54:35] amen so he could be seen
[54:39] now as the pillar of fire praise
[54:42] god amen or as
[54:45] sunlight s.o.n
[54:48] light and this
[54:52] was the beginning of the creation
[54:55] of god not that god
[54:58] himself can be created but it's the
[55:01] beginning of god creating
[55:03] and the first thing he did was to create
[55:06] light to represent or himself amen
[55:10] hallelujah praise god now
[55:13] brothers and sisters we then
[55:16] touched after that on the creation of
[55:20] man genesis 1 26-31
[55:24] praise god then on to genesis 2
[55:27] verse 7 where god
[55:31] not he created man first
[55:34] in genesis 1 when he says
[55:38] let us make man in our own image
[55:41] and lightness hallelujah praise god
[55:45] but in genesis 2 7
[55:48] he got the bible says god formed the man
[55:52] from the dust of the earth praise god
[55:56] so we're just making plain to you
[55:59] since god was an ears
[56:03] spirit amen and he made
[56:06] man in his image
[56:09] and likeness that man was a spirit man
[56:15] that was the spirit man adam
[56:18] was first the spirit man amen
[56:22] and then leica he formed
[56:25] man or he shaped man
[56:28] just as much as he gave himself
[56:31] something that you could recognize him
[56:33] perceiving with your eyes he began now
[56:35] to form
[56:37] a body for man right that
[56:40] man is his likeness would go
[56:44] into that flesh body that was formed
[56:48] by his mighty hand now remember
[56:51] people think that though we are
[56:54] fearfully and wonderfully made
[56:56] that this is what's in the image of god
[56:58] this is not what is in the image of god
[57:01] it's the man in here that is in the
[57:04] image of god and likeness of god
[57:06] amen we are spirit like god and if
[57:10] you're neglected
[57:11] you are in the nature and the image and
[57:14] the likeness of the living god
[57:16] on the inside praise god hallelujah
[57:19] oh my he is the light these are the
[57:23] lower lights amen
[57:25] oh let the little lights be burning
[57:28] and send a mighty wave across the seas
[57:32] amen some ship wrecked or forlorn
[57:35] brother
[57:36] seeing men take heart again amen
[57:40] lord of god hallelujah saw god
[57:43] first created the man
[57:47] in his image and lightness
[57:51] and he was a spirit man and i recap
[57:54] this soul that you might pick up and
[57:57] begin to
[57:59] understand how that while he was in the
[58:02] spirit form he could
[58:05] command the trees he could command
[58:09] the animals and tell them come
[58:12] or grow or do this but
[58:15] he could not kill the soil there was no
[58:19] man to kill the soil man was there but
[58:22] he couldn't tell the soil
[58:23] amen and that's what the bible says god
[58:26] perceived that man couldn't
[58:28] kill the soil and therefore he formed
[58:31] man
[58:32] amen he made a body for the spirit
[58:35] man adam to go into so that he can begin
[58:39] to
[58:40] kill the soil do some gardening
[58:43] not work because at that time you didn't
[58:45] have labor and all that sort of stuff
[58:48] right not labor there was just natural
[58:51] normal
[58:52] work that people did and that's the
[58:54] state god wants every one of us to be in
[58:57] to get to a place where you free up
[59:01] you don't have to labor but if you want
[59:04] to go in your garden and pick a rose
[59:05] today
[59:07] that you pick a rose you want to sit
[59:10] under your own fig tree and have a
[59:12] coffee have a coffee
[59:13] preach the lord amen but when you're in
[59:16] your garden you're doing the work
[59:18] right but you're not on the label
[59:20] because you're not under
[59:21] some kind of person or persons or
[59:24] organization behind you pushing you that
[59:25] you got to finish this quota
[59:27] you got to finish now no pressure
[59:30] whatsoever
[59:31] you are now under a different absolutely
[59:34] different situation
[59:36] and that's what we're talking about
[59:37] that's how adam and eve were
[59:39] it's not that their layer running on the
[59:41] trees like you see in some
[59:43] of the drawings and they just pick a
[59:45] fruit and they sit there
[59:47] like that oh well they couldn't do that
[59:49] if they wanted but the bible said the
[59:51] man
[59:52] they killed the soil they were taking
[59:55] care of the
[59:56] garden at that time praise the lord and
[59:59] they rest when they want
[1:00:01] they stop when they wanted and they at
[1:00:03] when they wanted and they
[1:00:05] took brees when they wanted whatever
[1:00:07] praise the lord
[1:00:08] amen so god formed him a body
[1:00:12] so that he could be seen
[1:00:16] and that the spirit man adam
[1:00:20] could now make himself manifest
[1:00:24] or manifested through that outward form
[1:00:27] that god had created for him
[1:00:30] praise the lord hallelujah and i'm so
[1:00:33] thankful
[1:00:34] that the man christ jesus whom we can't
[1:00:38] see with our eyes
[1:00:40] is in this allah forming another body
[1:00:44] that he might get into it make himself
[1:00:48] manifest and glorify himself
[1:00:52] in the body that is called the bride of
[1:00:55] jesus christ
[1:00:56] in this last day all thanks be to god
[1:00:59] on high that he's once again fulfilling
[1:01:03] his word
[1:01:04] amen yes sir praise god
[1:01:07] so the jehovah who could never be
[1:01:11] seen but the old testament
[1:01:14] is now jesus of the new testament
[1:01:19] the alpha and the omega the
[1:01:22] first and the last the unseen
[1:01:26] word now mad flesh
[1:01:29] in the man christ jesus hallelujah amen
[1:01:32] so first he made himself
[1:01:36] into light praise god
[1:01:39] and then condescended
[1:01:43] from that light into the form
[1:01:47] of a man christ
[1:01:50] jesus who said i
[1:01:54] am the light of the world amen
[1:01:58] praise god you understand he is the
[1:02:02] light
[1:02:03] of the world amen hallelujah
[1:02:07] thank god and we taught that
[1:02:10] as we began to wrap up what we were
[1:02:13] saying
[1:02:13] we told you that the bible tells you
[1:02:16] clearly
[1:02:17] that there's a light going to shine
[1:02:20] in the new jerusalem that light will
[1:02:24] not be the light of the sun or of the
[1:02:27] moon
[1:02:28] but the lamb himself shall be the light
[1:02:31] thereof
[1:02:33] he will change the new jerusalem praise
[1:02:36] god
[1:02:37] why he's shining into the hearts of all
[1:02:39] his elected
[1:02:40] seed and the light will be everywhere
[1:02:43] in the new jerusalem no need for sun no
[1:02:47] need for moon because the light of god
[1:02:50] is there amen now i want to take your
[1:02:54] thoughts to
[1:02:55] something else as we begin to move
[1:02:59] to our subject
[1:03:02] how that brother branham said i was
[1:03:05] praying
[1:03:07] and around 2 30 to 3 o'clock in the
[1:03:10] morning
[1:03:11] as i was praying praying praying
[1:03:14] he said uh i could perceive like some
[1:03:17] kind of a light
[1:03:19] ah and i thought someone was shining a
[1:03:22] torch
[1:03:22] so i opened my eyes to see where's this
[1:03:26] light coming
[1:03:26] you know if your eyes are closed and
[1:03:28] somebody shines a light you could still
[1:03:30] get some kind of a perception that
[1:03:34] there's a light shining
[1:03:35] right praise god that's why mommy tried
[1:03:39] to go to sleep somebody has the light on
[1:03:41] bright
[1:03:42] it's still kind of penetrates to you and
[1:03:45] you want to turn off that light but
[1:03:47] praise god so he said i opened my eyes
[1:03:50] to see
[1:03:51] what this light was he said and there
[1:03:54] was just a little light up
[1:03:57] coming down from the ceiling and
[1:04:01] it was like a star amen
[1:04:04] but as it came down it grew in size
[1:04:08] and i kept looking at it and i was so
[1:04:10] fearful
[1:04:11] that i stepped i i moved backwards and
[1:04:15] out of the light hallelujah
[1:04:20] genesis 1
[1:04:23] john 1 the light of genesis 1
[1:04:27] became a man in
[1:04:31] john 1 and the word
[1:04:34] the logo the pillar of fire became
[1:04:38] flesh and grant among us hallelujah
[1:04:42] and here brother branham sees the light
[1:04:45] coming down
[1:04:46] he says and out of the light there
[1:04:48] stepped a man of 200
[1:04:51] pounds dressed in white robes
[1:04:55] his arms folded and said i am
[1:04:59] sent from the presence of almighty god
[1:05:02] amen and delivered to him god's message
[1:05:06] he says do not
[1:05:07] fear i am sent from the presence of
[1:05:10] almighty god hallelujah
[1:05:13] and spoke to him that thought that i
[1:05:16] am bringing to you is out of the light
[1:05:19] step
[1:05:20] the form of a man
[1:05:23] amen and we are seeing the same thing
[1:05:27] out of the light step
[1:05:30] the form of the man jesus christ
[1:05:34] and he said i am the light of the world
[1:05:37] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:05:40] darkness
[1:05:42] but he shall have the light of life
[1:05:45] amen praise god i want to thank god
[1:05:48] right now brother sister
[1:05:50] out of this great revelation
[1:05:54] hallelujah under this great revelation
[1:05:57] one day hallelujah will stop
[1:06:00] the fullness of a man the man
[1:06:04] christ jesus once again hallelujah
[1:06:07] because that's the same life making
[1:06:10] itself known
[1:06:12] the logos the word making
[1:06:15] itself unveiled you're taking the cover
[1:06:18] off of the light and the light shines
[1:06:21] and the darkness
[1:06:22] and the darkness understands it not
[1:06:25] amen but those who understand it those
[1:06:29] who get the revelation of it
[1:06:31] to them gave me the power to recognize
[1:06:34] to become
[1:06:35] to recognize that their sons are doctors
[1:06:38] of the living god
[1:06:41] hallelujah amen got a branham met him in
[1:06:45] the light
[1:06:46] and out of the lights that the man
[1:06:48] hallelujah
[1:06:50] amen when we look my friends
[1:06:53] how abraham met him
[1:06:56] and when abraham met him to the man
[1:07:00] by the name of melchizedek without
[1:07:03] mullah
[1:07:04] without father without beginning
[1:07:07] eternal without end o praise
[1:07:10] god brother sister
[1:07:13] met that man while he was
[1:07:16] in a state of a morphe transformation
[1:07:21] and change in coming down
[1:07:24] until it will come to its fullness
[1:07:27] in the person of the man christ jesus
[1:07:31] amen are you following me here
[1:07:34] praise the name of the lord forgive me
[1:07:36] when i speed up it's because i'm getting
[1:07:38] excited
[1:07:40] you know i'm just thrilled beyond belief
[1:07:44] at the fullness of the word of the
[1:07:47] living god
[1:07:47] hallelujah do you remember that god the
[1:07:51] pattern
[1:07:52] god came to a man by the name of moses
[1:07:56] and when he came to moses how did he
[1:07:57] come he came as a light in a bush
[1:08:01] he came as a pillar of fire inside
[1:08:04] of the bus amen and another time
[1:08:08] when moses prayed he said lord show me
[1:08:12] that glory
[1:08:13] and he see the light and out of the
[1:08:16] light he was barely able to see the back
[1:08:17] parts of a man
[1:08:19] you see the the the fullness of the man
[1:08:21] wasn't yet to be revealed it was just
[1:08:23] shaping it was just forming
[1:08:24] he couldn't see the whole thing but he
[1:08:26] just the back parts of a man just went
[1:08:28] by
[1:08:29] the light was shaping and forming itself
[1:08:32] amen into the back parts of a man oh
[1:08:35] glory be
[1:08:36] to god hallelujah so abraham
[1:08:39] saw him moses saw him the man stepping
[1:08:43] out of that light amen praise
[1:08:47] god and we know of course that that
[1:08:50] melchizedek later became
[1:08:53] jesus christ how many knows that
[1:08:57] amen paul hallelujah
[1:09:01] oh my paul on the road to damascus amen
[1:09:06] paul a master of the written word
[1:09:10] a theologian that if you challenge him
[1:09:13] he knows this bible he had every
[1:09:17] course everything you could go studying
[1:09:19] now in the best university
[1:09:21] he already had it and he was a master
[1:09:25] at the the youngest age
[1:09:28] at that particular time but when he was
[1:09:31] going down to the mascots
[1:09:33] the bible tells us that a light shone
[1:09:37] upon him
[1:09:39] that light was brighter than the sun
[1:09:42] hallelujah and it struck him off his
[1:09:45] horse
[1:09:46] and the voice spoke out of the light
[1:09:50] saul saw why persecute this
[1:09:54] thou me over and over again you're
[1:09:57] seeing the same thing the light is
[1:09:58] really a person
[1:10:00] the light is a person and the person
[1:10:04] is the man christ jesus amen
[1:10:07] hallelujah oh my the light
[1:10:10] shine unfall it was not regular sunshine
[1:10:14] amen it was not regular sunshine
[1:10:17] amen it was heavenly sunshine
[1:10:20] that could flood your soul with the
[1:10:23] glory divine
[1:10:25] it was the sunshine of the living god
[1:10:27] coming down
[1:10:28] into the human heart amen oh praise
[1:10:32] god it was not natural light but it was
[1:10:35] heavenly light
[1:10:37] that was shining down upon paul
[1:10:40] and paul my friend fell off his horse
[1:10:44] now remember paul was already like i
[1:10:46] said a
[1:10:47] master of the word of god already
[1:10:51] theologian whatever you want to call it
[1:10:53] paul knew it
[1:10:54] all but then the spirit took him to the
[1:10:58] deserts of arabia
[1:11:00] and begin to shine that light in his
[1:11:03] heart
[1:11:03] upon the word amen oh my
[1:11:07] when he came out he said oh that i could
[1:11:10] make all men
[1:11:12] see what is the fellowship of the
[1:11:15] mystery
[1:11:16] oh praise god philip said paul
[1:11:19] the things god is revealing through you
[1:11:22] he said
[1:11:23] some of them are hard to understand amen
[1:11:26] but he still recognized that there were
[1:11:29] thus
[1:11:30] saith the lord
[1:11:33] because paul had yesterday he said the
[1:11:36] things i'm
[1:11:37] saying to you it is not i but the lord
[1:11:41] other places he said what i say to you
[1:11:43] they are not just my
[1:11:45] words they are commandments of the lord
[1:11:48] hallelujah praise god therefore he said
[1:11:52] if an angel from heaven
[1:11:55] was to come down and stand before you
[1:11:58] and try to change what i am telling you
[1:12:01] amen let him be a quest
[1:12:05] in just the same way that same holy
[1:12:07] spirit
[1:12:08] that visited this prophet of this last
[1:12:11] day
[1:12:11] amen anybody trying to explain away
[1:12:15] try to attack try to change try to
[1:12:18] mutilate
[1:12:19] try to fabricate my friends dislocate or
[1:12:22] misinform
[1:12:23] people let them be a curse according to
[1:12:26] this world
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:32] amen god
[1:12:35] in other words sent the holy spirit
[1:12:40] and the spirit that brooded over the
[1:12:42] waters
[1:12:43] back then brooded now over the water of
[1:12:46] the world
[1:12:47] that paul had flooded his mind and soul
[1:12:50] and spirit with
[1:12:52] but he as a man it was just chaos
[1:12:55] there's no way he can put the gods
[1:12:58] jigsaw puzzle all together
[1:12:59] and the holy spirit had to come
[1:13:03] and brood over it and begin to say this
[1:13:05] goes here this goes there
[1:13:07] this is that this is that this
[1:13:08] dispensation this that over here
[1:13:10] here and start to bring it and out of it
[1:13:14] he begin to see christ revealed in his
[1:13:17] own word
[1:13:18] oh praise god hallelujah god
[1:13:21] make himself manifest and revealed
[1:13:24] in the word of the living god hallelujah
[1:13:28] amen in john 1
[1:13:31] verse 9 we read in the
[1:13:34] word of god here let me read that
[1:13:37] briefly
[1:13:37] praise the lord hallelujah verse 9
[1:13:41] what does it say the word was made flesh
[1:13:46] that was the true light
[1:13:49] which lighted every man that cometh into
[1:13:53] the world
[1:13:54] i want to take for a subject here
[1:13:59] the true light is now shining
[1:14:04] the true light is now shining
[1:14:08] and when we use the word true we
[1:14:11] use the word true
[1:14:14] uh if you look into a any good
[1:14:17] dictionary
[1:14:19] or you were to go to the church age book
[1:14:22] in the laodicean church age brother
[1:14:25] branham
[1:14:25] speaking when he was describing
[1:14:29] when jesus said i am the true
[1:14:32] witness amen brother branham explained
[1:14:36] he was not
[1:14:37] saying i am the true witness in
[1:14:40] opposition to false even though there is
[1:14:43] a measure of that
[1:14:45] but true he says in the sense of
[1:14:48] saying i am the real
[1:14:52] i am not the type or the shadow
[1:14:56] i am not any of that i am the reality
[1:15:00] amen and when you want to look even in
[1:15:02] the normal
[1:15:03] natural everyday dictionary that word
[1:15:07] true
[1:15:07] means the real or the genuine thing
[1:15:13] so the true light now shine it
[1:15:16] the genuine light the real light
[1:15:20] now shines now you understand that the
[1:15:23] sun
[1:15:24] the moon the stars were only put in the
[1:15:26] heavens
[1:15:28] to shine on the natural earth
[1:15:31] typing how god himself would be the real
[1:15:35] sunshine to shine upon
[1:15:38] the elect seed that's on the
[1:15:42] natural in this natural body that he
[1:15:45] will be able to shine the light of god
[1:15:48] hallelujah and bring everything back to
[1:15:50] life for his glory
[1:15:52] [Applause]
[1:15:54] amen the true light is now shining
[1:15:58] we're not talking about s-u-n light
[1:16:02] we're talking about o
[1:16:05] n light i want to tell you right now
[1:16:09] it is the rising of the sun
[1:16:12] amen and the light is shining
[1:16:15] now on the earth but most of the people
[1:16:19] as the bible says
[1:16:20] they comprehended not they don't
[1:16:24] understand even while i'm speaking there
[1:16:26] might be many saying
[1:16:27] what's he talking about what's that that
[1:16:30] don't sound a
[1:16:31] you know i don't read that in the bible
[1:16:33] you know praise god
[1:16:34] not here not there you see but that's
[1:16:37] what it is
[1:16:38] amen because the pillar of fire
[1:16:42] amen was not just fire
[1:16:45] anymore it went into a man
[1:16:48] and it wasn't seen again until
[1:16:52] jesus wept the glory hallelujah
[1:16:56] for all the attributes all the genes all
[1:16:58] the word
[1:16:59] was in him and when he gave up the ghost
[1:17:04] that same holy ghost came down the
[1:17:07] unseen part of him
[1:17:09] came back down hallelujah
[1:17:12] and oh i'm getting ahead of myself oh
[1:17:17] amen oh praise god hallelujah
[1:17:21] yes sir so here we find uh let me just
[1:17:24] move on here
[1:17:25] by the spirit of god of course you know
[1:17:28] adam
[1:17:29] did not come born of a woman
[1:17:34] first adam did not come born of a woman
[1:17:38] amen he was born by the spoken word amen
[1:17:42] god spoke his word and adam
[1:17:45] came upon the scene amen
[1:17:49] so he was a created son
[1:17:52] of god and he of course
[1:17:56] adam himself the man not not his body
[1:18:00] later on
[1:18:01] but adam was eternal amen as god was
[1:18:05] eternal
[1:18:06] for he was a spoken word son of god
[1:18:10] hallelujah you know that this earth
[1:18:13] you're standing on is eternal
[1:18:15] how many knows that
[1:18:18] amen heavens and earth may pass away
[1:18:22] but my word will not pass away but you
[1:18:24] know
[1:18:25] that saying god doesn't mean that this
[1:18:27] earth gonna
[1:18:28] burn up and come to nothing it's going
[1:18:30] to be renovated
[1:18:32] it's going to be renovated well we're
[1:18:34] going to explain that future home of the
[1:18:36] heavily bright bright room
[1:18:37] how the fire of god will burn off all
[1:18:40] the germs all the
[1:18:41] sin all the demons all the powers all
[1:18:44] the spirits
[1:18:45] will be burnt off hallelujah and the
[1:18:48] whole thing will be
[1:18:49] renovated amen praise god hallelujah
[1:18:54] so brother sister i want you to know
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:57] god's sons and daughters are eternal
[1:19:02] hallelujah that's why over and over i
[1:19:05] repeat this
[1:19:06] you are not born you are not of time
[1:19:10] your body is of time your big body
[1:19:14] began somewhere and they begin to count
[1:19:18] the years of how old you are
[1:19:20] but the being on the inside there you
[1:19:23] come from god you're traveling through
[1:19:26] time
[1:19:26] and you're going back to god hallelujah
[1:19:29] because why
[1:19:30] you're eternal as god himself
[1:19:36] you come from light that's why you can
[1:19:40] see
[1:19:40] the light you are children of the light
[1:19:43] and you're going back to the light where
[1:19:45] you come from
[1:19:46] oh praise god forevermore you cannot
[1:19:49] walk in darkness
[1:19:51] because you yourself is a light wherever
[1:19:54] you go you
[1:19:55] light up you'll light up the place
[1:19:58] you'll light up other people's lives
[1:20:00] you'll light up their experiences
[1:20:03] you open up their understanding you
[1:20:06] bring them to a clearer
[1:20:08] oh condition in the word of god amen
[1:20:11] why because you are part of that light
[1:20:14] oh praise god shine all around us but
[1:20:18] day and by night jesus the light of the
[1:20:21] world
[1:20:22] oh my my my lord of god hallelujah
[1:20:27] amen hallelujah praise god
[1:20:31] amen oh i thank god
[1:20:34] that all of that all the attributes all
[1:20:38] them
[1:20:38] genes all all of the germs of you
[1:20:41] however you want to describe it
[1:20:43] was all in god in that
[1:20:46] logos you're already
[1:20:49] part of that word amen and when it was
[1:20:53] spoken
[1:20:54] all of that word was all wrapped up
[1:20:57] there
[1:20:58] amen together all was in him
[1:21:01] that's why brother branham is trying to
[1:21:03] get us to understand don't you
[1:21:05] understand just like how
[1:21:07] all your father's kids were in in him
[1:21:10] just we were all in christ hallelujah
[1:21:13] and when he went to
[1:21:15] calgary and he died on the cross the
[1:21:18] holy spirit came
[1:21:19] back in spirit form hallelujah
[1:21:22] the genes in him were now freed up
[1:21:24] they're released now
[1:21:26] praise god hallelujah oh
[1:21:29] my glory to god hallelujah
[1:21:32] amen glory to god hallelujah
[1:21:35] just just i have several things in front
[1:21:38] of me here
[1:21:39] but just i'm taking a glance here just
[1:21:42] to
[1:21:42] orient myself please praise the
[1:21:45] name of the living god amen praise god
[1:21:49] listen he says here no i won't touch
[1:21:52] that he's talking about the sacred
[1:21:54] lights in the
[1:21:55] conduct order and doctrine of how that
[1:21:57] light began to form
[1:21:59] amen he created the word
[1:22:02] you see he had to create the word in the
[1:22:05] form of a light
[1:22:06] first amen or in the beginning
[1:22:10] was the word and the word was
[1:22:14] with god you see that thinking is
[1:22:16] another person with god
[1:22:17] just like my thoughts are with me until
[1:22:19] i speak it
[1:22:21] it's with god amen the word was
[1:22:25] and the word was god because a man and
[1:22:28] his thoughts are
[1:22:29] one amen praise the lord so it's not
[1:22:33] something else it's god himself praise
[1:22:35] god
[1:22:36] hallelujah and so that
[1:22:39] word became flesh
[1:22:42] amen praise the lord o
[1:22:46] praise god of course you couldn't see
[1:22:49] all of the word going out in time and
[1:22:51] space because it's spiritual
[1:22:54] and you couldn't see it in that form
[1:22:57] praise the lord and so the word
[1:23:00] went out and jesus himself said my words
[1:23:04] their spirit and their life
[1:23:08] so the word is spirit it's not people
[1:23:11] the word is not writing
[1:23:13] the word is not something some thesis or
[1:23:16] something like that
[1:23:17] uh that's okay but that's not the real
[1:23:20] word
[1:23:21] my word they are spirit
[1:23:25] and they are life
[1:23:28] amen so the moment god said let there be
[1:23:33] the spirit of god the word
[1:23:36] in spirit form went out hallelujah
[1:23:40] amen and the sun has began to
[1:23:43] move and hover over the earth amen
[1:23:47] and doing what waiting waiting
[1:23:50] waiting so that it could start that
[1:23:54] spark
[1:23:55] to let the light begin to shine
[1:23:59] amen hallelujah praise god
[1:24:02] amen so the word of god
[1:24:05] moves like that and it'll wait it'll
[1:24:08] wait
[1:24:09] until the apostles are in the right
[1:24:13] shape
[1:24:13] and then all of a sudden the spirit of
[1:24:16] god will come on them
[1:24:18] and reveal the word of god to them light
[1:24:21] amen same with us in this last day
[1:24:25] god will take you in all manner of areas
[1:24:29] down through all kind of torturous
[1:24:31] trails god will take your mind this way
[1:24:34] that way
[1:24:34] that way but the spirit is waiting
[1:24:38] the spirit is brooding the spirit of god
[1:24:41] is waiting
[1:24:42] once you get to that right place and the
[1:24:45] right condition
[1:24:46] then the spirit of god descends and the
[1:24:49] world begins to unfold
[1:24:51] the light begins to shine life begins to
[1:24:54] come out of the light amen
[1:24:57] and you begin to live the way god wants
[1:24:59] you to live
[1:25:02] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:25:06] praise god listen praise the lord
[1:25:10] think of it think of it
[1:25:15] that sacred light forming like a little
[1:25:18] halo
[1:25:19] coming forth on the whole banister
[1:25:22] of heaven was watching no
[1:25:26] no one has seen god but now the next
[1:25:29] thing we begin to see
[1:25:31] by the eyes of the supernatural
[1:25:34] looking we see a white light forming
[1:25:38] out there what is it it's the logos
[1:25:41] it's what we call the anointing today
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:45] that part of god to develop itself into
[1:25:49] something human that could have
[1:25:52] some type of idea so that we could have
[1:25:56] some idea
[1:25:57] of who he was now god
[1:26:01] himself gave birth to
[1:26:04] this son which was the light
[1:26:08] amen before there was even
[1:26:11] air before there was even
[1:26:15] atoms see oh my
[1:26:19] jesus said glorify me father
[1:26:22] with the glory i had with thee
[1:26:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:26:30] glory to god hallelujah listen when you
[1:26:33] get tired let me know
[1:26:34] oh praise god hallelujah so
[1:26:38] glory to god so here we are brother
[1:26:40] sister
[1:26:42] and we see that word of god that
[1:26:46] when god said let there be let there be
[1:26:48] light
[1:26:49] god said let there be a redeemer let
[1:26:51] there be a savior
[1:26:53] let there be a pride hallelujah that
[1:26:56] same spirit of god
[1:26:57] goes out hallelujah and begins to cross
[1:27:01] crisscross the entire world searching
[1:27:04] where
[1:27:05] searching to find that germ
[1:27:08] seed of god just to find the
[1:27:12] dirt the form that that germ is hiding
[1:27:15] in
[1:27:16] oh my glory god to bring a resurrection
[1:27:21] to bring an awakening back to life again
[1:27:24] by the light of the word of god the sun
[1:27:27] shine of god's word shining on you oh
[1:27:31] praise god forevermore i'm gonna i'm
[1:27:33] gonna have to stop because
[1:27:35] my physical body amen glory to god
[1:27:39] hallelujah
[1:27:40] amen praise god of course you know
[1:27:44] that the spoken word is the original see
[1:27:48] and you know that the spirit as it says
[1:27:50] in the book of romans
[1:27:52] comes like rain that he allows to come
[1:27:54] down on the just
[1:27:55] and upon the unjust amen
[1:27:59] and so the spirit comes like rain
[1:28:03] amen now ever again just go after
[1:28:07] understand the the false teaching of
[1:28:10] what even some believers in this message
[1:28:12] don't recognize
[1:28:13] they think the holy spirit comes to give
[1:28:16] you
[1:28:16] life the holy spirit comes to
[1:28:20] make you have eternal life or to bring
[1:28:22] in eternal life
[1:28:24] the holy spirit doesn't come to bring an
[1:28:26] eternal life you have to have
[1:28:28] eternal life from the for the foundation
[1:28:31] of the world
[1:28:34] hallelujah the spirit reigns
[1:28:37] of god only comes to wake up the germ
[1:28:40] that's inside
[1:28:42] it comes to reveal or to manifest
[1:28:45] that sun that seed or that
[1:28:49] weed weed or wheat to show what the
[1:28:52] nature that's behind there
[1:28:54] is praise god so that's why jesus said
[1:28:58] you ask him for the baptism the holy
[1:29:00] ghost you know not what you asked for
[1:29:02] amen people say i want the holy ghost
[1:29:05] you know not what you asked for
[1:29:07] maybe you want the one they have that
[1:29:09] makes you jump up in the pentecostal
[1:29:10] church
[1:29:11] maybe you make the one that will make
[1:29:12] you shout and holler and scream
[1:29:14] you know but my god he says you're
[1:29:17] asking for the baptism
[1:29:19] i am baptized with amen he says that one
[1:29:23] he says you know not what you're really
[1:29:25] asking for
[1:29:26] oh my my my brother sister what an hour
[1:29:30] what a day what a season what a time
[1:29:34] praise peter god hallelujah you see
[1:29:39] the spirit of god goes out and as you
[1:29:42] know
[1:29:42] eternal life will
[1:29:45] will only come to eternal life
[1:29:48] [Music]
[1:29:50] for only eternal life will
[1:29:53] recognize eternal life
[1:29:57] you see if it's not eternal can't really
[1:30:00] recognize
[1:30:02] it might recognize and even recognize
[1:30:05] partially
[1:30:06] and say oh oh that's eternal life and
[1:30:08] even describe it and even use
[1:30:10] all other words to describe it but it
[1:30:12] wouldn't really know
[1:30:14] eternal life only eternal life
[1:30:18] will know eternal life praise god
[1:30:21] in other words the seed germ and you
[1:30:24] is why the holy ghost came to you to
[1:30:27] baptize you
[1:30:29] is that right in other words the ring of
[1:30:33] on the unjust don't fall even where
[1:30:34] there is no seed and all
[1:30:36] rains go fall everywhere but it really
[1:30:38] is coming to germinate the germs see
[1:30:42] so oh i got the spirit that is wonderful
[1:30:45] but that's not what we're talking about
[1:30:47] here amen that's why the prophet said
[1:30:49] the real baptism holy ghost the first
[1:30:53] thing it will do
[1:30:54] is open your eyes to see the world
[1:30:58] amen that germs start to recognize now
[1:31:00] who it really is
[1:31:02] start to recognize itself not just
[1:31:05] hearing somebody quoting something but
[1:31:07] the reality begins to strike your soul
[1:31:11] i am really and truly a part of that
[1:31:15] life
[1:31:16] of that purifier of that living god
[1:31:20] hallelujah amen and i'm not just
[1:31:24] talking amen it's something like a like
[1:31:27] a
[1:31:27] anchor in my soul i
[1:31:30] know who i am and what i have been
[1:31:34] raised up for
[1:31:35] and i praise god this day for the
[1:31:38] original life
[1:31:40] the original life the original war
[1:31:43] your original seed is what happened oh
[1:31:46] my
[1:31:47] glory of god hallelujah amen
[1:31:51] oh satan infiltrate even this message
[1:31:54] until we got message theologians we got
[1:31:57] people that can give you so much
[1:31:59] information out of this message you
[1:32:00] really think they
[1:32:01] have the holy ghost amen but we're not
[1:32:04] here for information we're not here for
[1:32:06] you
[1:32:06] look i know i'm giving you what i'm
[1:32:08] giving to you is
[1:32:09] also supernatural spiritual knowledge
[1:32:12] but it's what it's going to do to you
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:15] i can talk all i want but all i say
[1:32:19] don't mean nothing unless the holy
[1:32:21] spirit can take
[1:32:22] what i am saying and make you take it
[1:32:25] now
[1:32:26] and your mind and your heart start going
[1:32:29] off here
[1:32:30] there there in the word of god places
[1:32:32] where i couldn't touch
[1:32:34] because with your mouth you can't talk a
[1:32:36] million things you can only give the
[1:32:38] general direction
[1:32:40] and the rest is god has to take you in
[1:32:42] out those places
[1:32:44] god has to take you there i can't take
[1:32:46] you each one you have to have
[1:32:47] individual experience and revelation of
[1:32:51] god
[1:32:51] taking the word of god as i've always
[1:32:53] tell people that's why
[1:32:55] i don't really disagree with people
[1:32:58] right not because you want to compromise
[1:33:01] but i understand that here
[1:33:05] is an elephant like i've always said and
[1:33:07] one of these brothers grab a hold of the
[1:33:09] tail
[1:33:11] he said i know this is a rope
[1:33:15] i am positive i got it in my hand i
[1:33:18] understand it i got a revelation of it
[1:33:20] it's true also i'm not going to disagree
[1:33:24] amen another one coming in he touched
[1:33:27] the foot
[1:33:28] he said why are you talking about rope

[1:33:41] going to arm you over it

[1:33:58] and he is going to argue and he's going
[1:34:01] to prove
[1:34:02] back forth and his right
[1:34:05] he's right it's the elephant's ears
[1:34:10] the other ones sit back
[1:34:13] lisa listen to the whole pack of them
[1:34:16] the
[1:34:17] thing is a holes because he got a hold
[1:34:21] of this
[1:34:24] what are you talking about you see but

[1:34:47] partially the other
[1:34:48] partially but you see the whole picture
[1:34:52] praise god christ revealed in his own
[1:34:56] word
[1:34:57] christ is the mystery of god now
[1:35:00] being revealed the true light now shines
[1:35:04] upon us
[1:35:05] amen praise god hallelujah
[1:35:08] amen yes sir so eternal life comes to
[1:35:12] eternal life
[1:35:14] why do you think the word is coming to

[1:38:09] word can't go up to an altar and just
[1:38:12] repent and say they're sorry for their
[1:38:14] sins
[1:38:15] and i could say oh i had a thousand
[1:38:16] people come to my meeting
[1:38:18] and oh the altar was full and and all
[1:38:20] those people repent
[1:38:22] no eternal life doesn't come there
