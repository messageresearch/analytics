rejoicing like we were when we just came in I remember we came in these Easter weekends we're just on fire for God Amen I mean every week every Easter it's been 33 34 years every Easter is good right but something just stirred this Easter in my heart e amen the fire of God just stirring I believe God is doing something and I believe I'm a part of it why because of the Spirit the spirit testifies amen that I'm a part of it Hallelujah not because I come to church not because I'm a good church member or good church attendance which I'm not I'm not always here but it's because of his grace amen hallelujah glory to God Amen we want to continue in the series The Power of tradition part three there's going to be another part to this um we um we're going to just be looking tonight uh the the title here is come deeper into the truth my bride the last service we preached was come out of her my bride but now it's come deeper into the truth my bride amen hallelujah glory to God Amen so just recapping a little bit here before we read our scripture in the last two Services Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free Hallelujah and that's what that's the truth that God is revealing to his bride and that's the truth that is calling us to come into Hallelujah see when the spirit of truth comes it will guide you and lead you into all truth that is the evidence we know of the Holy Ghost that you're born again that the spirit of truth comes it guides you it it do say it guides everybody it guides you you into all truth hallelujah amen we can see in the days of Jesus the Pharisees and Sadducees and the scribes created hundreds of traditions and the oral law and covered and made of none effect the Mosaic law and we see that when Jesus came they couldn't even recognize him because of all their Traditions now listen Spirits people die but Spirits don't die amen and like history repeats itself these are all being said here Amen to show you the day that we are living in because if you can't place this word in today in modern events being made clear by the word prophecies coming to pass then what are you doing you're living in a past age you're not living in the bright age and that's what we want to get into tonight passing from the seven Church ages and moving into the bride age amen hallelujah amen so we can see that we can see the Dark Ages the Roman Catholic Church bringing the nickan spirit Traditions Hallelujah dogmas and Creeds again amen bringing it back into the church the Dark Ages came it cut out the truth from the beginning and here we go again again Hallelujah and I emphasize that very importantly that that nicadan Spirit the conquered theity that Jesus himself said in the Book of Revelations I hate that Spirit also amen and we know that the Roman Catholic Church the denominations BR that in what's that have to do brother Tim with right now you're going to see what it has to do hallelujah amen amen then the spirit of God through Wesley Luther Wesley in Pentecost started to restore the word and at the end of the leosan church age remember at the end the prophet always comes at the end of the age all right amen he came at the end of the age to bring the bride into the fullness of the truth again again because the message started at Pentecost it started remember the message started in Pentecostal age that's where it started this message that we are all believe in and claiming to be the truth started in the Pentecostal age and grew and manifested in the Pentecostal age okay until the opening of The Seven Seals oh I did my research I know where I'm talk I know what I'm talking about until the opening of The Seven Seals and then the Pentecostal age died Dead Brother Braham says I am no longer after the seals a Pentecostal and I am no longer in the Pentecostal age done over with Hallelujah Hallelujah and when that changed it went from the seven Church age into eternity or brother bradam says many times the Eternal Church age or the bride age the rapturing age all these things oh Hallelujah and it became amen but people are still feeding off the Pentecostal age message what listening to the tapes listening to things in the message that we call the message of the hour feeding off of a Pentecostal age you know who people don't like this kind of preaching is people who preach and still under the influence in this message Pentecostal Hallelujah but here we got we got the message of the hour to recognize that the age has changed and God has turned a corner brother Bram says You must recognize when God turns the corner amen amen God turns the corner Hallelujah constantly turning the corner amen let us turn in our scriptures now to First Corinthians that was the recap a little let us get into the little bit of the message tonight what I want to do in the next two messages is like I said slowly show you coming out of the leoan age coming into the Rapture age and then the next message I really want to get into it's taken me a lot of studying to do it but really get into the message as whole and show you two parts of the message one part in the message where people are living in the Leo in acting behaving and manifesting the spirit of the of the Pentecostal age and then the ones that is living in the bride Age The Eternal Church age by the doctrines and the teachings that are going around amen 1 Corinthians 2:9 29-13 but as it is written eyes have not seen nor ears heard neither has it entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that love him we use that scripture a lot amen eyes haven't seen ears haven't heard what's it hasn't even enter into the hearts but let's go to verse 10 here but but God had revealed unto them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God so God is saying but God has revealed those things that eyes haven't seen ears haven't heard in this hour God has revealed it to us hallelujah for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God hallelujah that we may know not be in dis deceived or not be uh uh in in uh kept blind but we shall know this is the hour this is the day that we shall know all things which things also we speak not in Words which men's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual Hebrews 10:19 Hallelujah amen so next time anybody says eyes haven't seen ears haven't heard just say but God has revealed Hallelujah but God has re maybe your eyes don't see your ears don't hear but God has revealed to somebody the bride Hallelujah Hebrews 10 19 having therefore Brethren us boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near not draw back let us draw near with a True Heart in foolish Assurance of Faith Revelation having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies wash with pure water let us not draw back now amen the way he been made we can go boldly before his throne and find out the truth amen that he's made a way he has consecrated and he's prepared that way for us hallelujah amen let us pray father thank you than you for your word tonight Lord Lord come father and speak to our hearts take me aside anoint me anoint Thy word into the people's hearts we cannot do nothing without you lord you said in that hour and we are in an hour of preaching right now take no thought that what you would say but my heavenly father will speak through father speak through us tonight hear through US Lord and reveal yourself to each and every one bless each and every one here online and whoever be watching in Jesus name we pray amen hallelujah glory to God John in the pergamus church age I don't want to get ahead of myself so John 1613 Hallelujah brother Brandon speaking here when the spirit of truth comes the word word the word will guide you to all truth Thy word is truth and he shall not speak of himself but whosoever shall hear the word of God that shall he speak he shall show you things to come Hallelujah and Daniel 2:22 he reveals deep and hidden things he knows what lies in Darkness and Light dwells with him not not only did God reveal the dream to him he also gave him the interpretation of the dream that is why Daniel call God the one that unveils Secrets he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what's in Darkness and Light dwelleth in him Hallelujah glory to God now the word deeper means is looking deeper into yourself looking into your values what's important to you and determine what you want your life to stand for finding your deeper meaning can help you to create a meaningful life for yourself where your actions and decisions are based all around thoughtful purpose purposeful thinking and we know Hallelujah that we take this meaning they take it out in the world but we take this meaning and we line it up with God's word amen because our purpose in life is to fulfill his will and let his word be manifested in our lives because that's what he's doing in this hour my word won't return to me void but it shall accomplish what is set forth to do and we are a part of that scripture Amen in our lives to yield Our Lives to the word that's being revealed in US amen and he is the one that reveals the Deep things Hallelujah in our lives Oh Glory to God Amen he wants the bride to get to a place amen of understanding of realization remember one of the greatest quotes when the bride recognizes who she is she'll be Invincible God wants us to understand recognize amen that the spirit within us reveals all the things that we need to know and the Deep things of God within us amen nothing is withheld to the Bride of Jesus Christ nothing at all God Reveals His secrets to her oh my glory to God but you know she's a seeking bride she's a obedient bride she doesn't love the world she doesn't even love her own self her flesh she loves the will of God she loves doing the will of God hallelujah amen brother Brown speaking here the Queen of Sheba I'm just trying to lay something back here so we we get to the end here you'll understand a little bit better and as long as a human being searches in hungers and thirsts calling for the power of God there's got to be a power of God somewhere to respond to it oh my if we got a thirst and hunger tonight amen for change in our lives for Faith to come in our lives for transformation for our lives to turn into a different direction there's got to be a power here there's got to be faith in the room here tonight to to supply that need that you have Hallelujah before there can be a creation there's got to be a Creator in their creating that creation when man longs to see God hallelujah there's got to be a god somewhere that created that desire in him do you hunger do you thirst and long to see the Lord hallelujah I remember just coming into my mind I was in a meeting many years ago when we first came in we went down into Michigan and I was called out in a prayer line amen and and and what was spoke over me was a few things but one of the things that were spoke over to me says my brother you're Desiring more of God and that's what I was thirsting and hungering for God more of God and he said God is here tonight to give you more of himself you don't have to be called out in a prayer line Hallelujah you can be here right here tonight Desiring and hungering for God and there's a God here that will give you more of himself oh my Hallelujah if there's a deep call into the deep there's got to be a deep to respond to that because the Deep has to be first there to create that call in you oh my do you got a deep call in tonight do you got to hunger to know the Living God tonight Hallelujah then blessed are you blessed blessed are you that hunger and thirst after righteousness Hallelujah in this hour blessed are you in this most wicked deceiving lukewarm lazy powerless age that we're living in blessed are you that hunger and thirst for righteousness for you shall be filled [Music] Hallelujah glory to God amen amen we see in this age Satan's purpose is to deceive us into discrediting God's word as he did Eve in the Garden of Eden yes that's his goal to deceive the bride if it were possible to discredit God's word how did you how does she discredit God's word by telling her amen the script scriptures but twisting it Hallelujah twisting the scriptures twisting present truth twisting Prophecy of the Bride in this hour and what she ought to be twisting her not not the not to go into the the the bride Age The Rapture age amen but to stay in leosan twisting the scriptures and keep her there under the gifts under justification under sanctification but not move in her on just keeping her there you're saved you're okay but the spirit is constantly calling out to the Bride come deeper in my truth there's more for you Hallelujah more in this hour than just a Pentecostal experience Hallelujah glory to to God Amen this is what he has done with the denominations today a different thinking to God's thinking it will separate us from God which results in death Amos 3:3 how can two walk together unless they be degreed Hallelujah Satan's Eden now we find out in every every seed brings forth of his own kind there there was no death in that Eden we are now entering in where Satan is taking the throne as the Antichrist in an Eden of this Earth an Eden of sin perverted religion he started not upon I am Satan I am the great Angel no not upon that but upon perverting God's word hallelujah you know where is it going to be my brothers and sisters where the scripture be fulfilled if it were possible toce the very elect can Satan take that denominational teaching out there and pervert that and almost de deceive the very elect or is he going to come into the m message Hallelujah maybe maybe the the the lady o seeing part of the message the Pentecostal age of the message I know this is not popular that's okay I know where I stand and try to take that and keep oh we're all in the message but keep you under that influence of that Spirit of that denominational Spirit of the message and keep you from moving forward Hallelujah now you can see how it could be so close yep and that's how he's brought that's how he's brought his kingdom in in every age and now in this great deceitful age ready to take his thrown by his people he builds himself an intellectual educated scientific Eden write scientific preachers scientific Church scientific theology Hallelujah everything is scientific everything is based on knowledge the whole church is based upon knowledge it's it's not based upon Faith but the bride shall live by faith the just shall live by faith by Revelation my brothers and sisters this this is here today Hallelujah this is what Satan is taking in this hour he's taken that quote right there and he's taken the part of the message that is back in Pentecost back in a past age that God has already moved on from and he's taken that and taken the knowledge of it the very quotes Hallelujah oh what are you talking about brother Tim you know this can't really be explained in its fullness it can only be understood as a as close as possible as a preacher can preach it as he understands it but the Revelation comes by the spirit that reveals it that shows it a light clicks on and goes my God I see it Hallelujah I see it I know what I'm seeing here I I wasn't what I'm seeing here is not what I'm preaching here what I'm seeing here in my experience was not taught by man how great man is uh brother Simon all these wonderful preachers how great they are even brother bradam on the tapes it was not taught to me and revealed to me and show to me by man but by his Spirit Hallelujah not by might not by power but his spirit and that's it is with every individual amen we can only preach the word in this way and in this form but he's got to come and Quicken it and open your eyes to see what age that you living in hallelujah amen we must come in Union agreement with the revealed word and that seed produces a new birth the true word birth not a false birth 1 Peter 1:23 being born again not a corruptible seed but Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever oh a new birth oh my so many people are claiming to be born again in this message but born under a different age not born under the revealed word not born under the opening of The Seven Seals being revealed to them and they sit there I'm born again I believe the prophet I'm in the message I quote the quotes we're going to get into lining our lives up a little bit down the road here in our lives the way our lives look and haven't crossed over wearing long skirts long hair proper talking everything but have have not crossed over have not crossed over the seven Church ages that Chasm that only the Holy Ghost can bring you into the Capstone haven't crossed over this is the age my brothers and sisters the crossing over is taking place Hallelujah glory to God we're going to get into the foolish verses next next next uh next message and show you Hallelujah that this bride could be already sealed in already Hallelujah you say when the last one comes in brother Tim the Rapture would take place what is the last one have you studied have you seen have you heard who is the last one remember the foolish virgins got to come in study the message they're not saved in Tribulation they're saved over here right now they all got to come in everybody that has to be saved has to come in here for the word says that when this Rapture takes place God is finished with the Gentiles he goes over to the Jews he's left the mercy seat at that time go study the message write down what I'm saying here and quote it go go get it and see what I'm saying you'll see it there I know what I'm talking about Hallelujah the end time message has restored the thoughts of God by restoring the truth of the scriptures without man's denominational thoughts being mixed with it this pure seed will produce true Sons and Daughters of God again for the manifestation of the sons of God this word is only made known to the bride the word has been fully restored in this hour so that God and man could be fully United again in Union together in these last days this is the season for the prophecy to be fulfilled and God is achieving through his revealed word of this hour it is the invisible Union of the bride of Christ and we are very privileged we are very privileged to be a part of that now brother Brown is speaking here hallelujah amen saying that we are privileged to be a part of it and then in another verse he says we are living under our privileges Hallelujah amen God don't want the bride to live under her privileges What a Sad thing when a when a when a husband and wife get married and the and the wife don't recognize who the who the husband is and her her her her privileges of being married to that man Hallelujah you imagine that Daniel if if Christine don't know who you are that you're her husband you imagine that Hallelujah glory to God now the mystery continues doesn't stop it continues God's truth keeps marching on God's truth keeps revealing somebody told me brother Tim there is no progression of the word there's no progression of Faith it's all been restored has all been here it's now it's done true it's true but it's not been revealed in the fullness it's got to progress in the bride the truth is here faith is here perfect faith is here God is here the mighty Angel is here he descended but now we got to grow into it now our Amnesia our eyes Revelation upon revelation line upon line we are moving into it and it's being revealed to us hallelujah so we are progressing and that's where people don't understand they say no I got perfect faith I'm complete yes potentially you're complete but now you got to go through the manifestation or why didn't Jesus take when he resurrected and he rose back then why didn't he take all the bride with him he could have the prophet said he could have he had the power he had Authority and he had the right back then not before then but back then he had it but he didn't because he wanted her in every age to come into manifestation Hallelujah glory to God the ministry continues then stop with brother brandham Hallelujah you think just listening to the tapes can get you into the Rapture that's not what gets you into the Rapture and not just by coming to the church gets you into the Rapture but the ministry the fivefold ministry the ministry of the Holy Ghost amen the word in the fivefold ministry continues and he is still speaking in this hour man is speaking you hear man tonight but the Holy Ghost is still speaking oh Hallelujah he says you just go out there and amen you just be a front for me Hallelujah but I will be the one behind I will be the one Speaking I will be the ones going up and down the Pew into the hearts I am the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart I know where each and every one of my children are in their walk in their Journey amen I know what I need to do to bring them higher God's not to bring you down that's the devil God brings you higher and higher and higher he takes you out of that complex he takes you out of all insecurities he takes you out of fears he takes you out of all these things and brings You Higher by showing who you are who you are there's going to be two three kinds of people here tonight or listening online but the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to recognize who she is she's going to hear the word and the spirit's going to speak to her she's an Eagle Hallelujah she's a bride amen glory to God hallelujah brother Tim nobody can do this no man can do this only God can do this amen yes the ministry continues the voice of God the voice continues it then stop with brother brandham the voice of God is still continuing it's not just plus Play Hallelujah it's just not on the tapes amen but that message has g into the bride and if that message is in the bride then the voice is in the bride not only in preaching but the Ley this is not nickan spirit it's the Ley it's each and every Born Again believer glory to God Amen when the Suns made son of man is being revealed in Bride form again see the message without re Revelation makes religious people and forms and Creeds and dogmas and traditions and all kinds of things the message without Revelation it's good you have the message you have the books the tapes but without Revelation Hallelujah every false Doctrine now listen Hallelujah every false Doctrine starts out with a scripture or a quote from Brother bradam that's where it starts from just like Eve in the Garden of Eden he ain't going to start making some kind of you know some somebody out there some stupidness that they're Elijah and this and that they're going to call the heavens and all that you can see through that but no it starts with a scripture and a quote from Brother brandom Hallelujah and then it starts with man interpreting it Hallelujah Satan quoting to Eve Revelations 22:18 we have no new revelation the message we have received is not only brother brandom's message but it has become the bride's message so the prophet lived this message and now the bride is living and displaying the same token that the messenger displayed how can it be any different how can God have respect to a person if you can't difference between a gift yes he was a prophet he had a gift of being a prophet to the age to restore the word but remember that message the word comes to a prophet he's not just the word the word had to come to the prophet and the same word that came to the prophet and manifested through the prophet that same word was spoken out to the bride now that word comes to the bride now and here she is in this hour living that same token manifesting the same power to become Sons and Daughters of God to become the image of Christ in this last day no difference my brothers and sisters that's what we should be seeking for that's what we should be hungering for hallelujah we're not going to get it any easier you young people you young adults you're not going to get it any easier the birth is the same way for everybody it's a mess it's a perseverance it's a striving it's a pressing into the kingdom it's a fight it's a fight a fight against yourself a fight against your own self your own thinking your own ideas it's a desperation in his presence not your mommy and daddy's desperation your desperation in his presence pres I want to know the god of my parents I want to know this God of Elijah Hallelujah he's my God hallelujah amen yes the same token is it the Bride riding this Trail again just think about it people waiting for the prophet to rais from the dead to ride this Trail again all kinds of doctrines all kinds of teachings doesn't the bible say that uh I forget who it is himas or whatever said that the Rapture has passed in the Bible and over through the faith of many people saying these kind of statements and believ in these kind of things and preaching these kind of things underlying that the prophet is going to ride this Trail again he's going to come back in a tent Vision Hallelujah people going oh and I know people I I I discern when they speak you just listen to somebody for a couple minutes if you got the Holy Ghost you know where they're at oh when that great squeeze comes on that great tent Ministry comes on oh my some of them won't say oh the prophet will rise and come back again oh my overthrowing the faith of many my brothers and sisters that's just a lie from the pits of hell trying to deceive the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour but she can't be deceived oh she can't be deceived my brothers and sister hallelujah oh he fights that the revelation of Jesus Christ he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is now think about it what she stands for and that she does she can do the greater work Works she can do the Greater Works not waiting for anybody else to come back she she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church or the message and by God's spirit deser and withstand the Antichrist spirit so she's got to this bride in this message you listen L to me has got to withstand the Antichrist spirit because it's here it's moving in the ranks oh my she's got to withstand it then Satan will be powerless powerless before her now listen my brothers and sisters time is flying here hallelujah I'm just going to read three things we must must not do misinterpret the scriptures Hallelujah to change so much as to create a wrong impression or alter the meaning of his word is to seriously misinterpret the author's meaning very important God is his own interpreter he will make it plain to you he will reveal it and when he reveals it like brother BR says when Jesus Christ reveals anything any truth of himself you'll be able to see it from Genesis right to Revelations amen it'll line right up there will be no contradiction Hallelujah and you'll know with inside yourself it was a spirit that revealed it not you second don't misplace the scriptures to put it in the wrong place put it in the wrong time put it in the wrong season amen using the very Bible using the very quotes you think about it if most of the quotes are back in the age that brother bradam says I'm no longer in after the seals and I'm no longer a Pentecostal you using those quotes to try to Perfect The Bride of Jesus Christ am I saying am I saying that before 63 there's not some nuggets in there no serpent seed is some nuggets the church ages are some nuggets they're all the true doctrines of Christ but remember one thing my brothers and sisters that brother bradam said the woman came to brother bradam go look it up write these things down and and and and she said to brother brandham brother brandham you mean that God allowed you to say things to make people go this way to make people go that way and to make people go down straight down the road you mean in the message of the hour on the tapes on the books there are things that are deliberately said from God to make people go this way that way and the bride Knows by The Spirit right down the middle because of Revelation brother Brandon says yes God deliberately made me say things and God did it don't get mad at me you can go look all the stuff up don't get mad at me hallelujah hallelujah and third don't dislocate the scriptures put it out of place oh my is there a lot of this stuff going on sure there is a lot of this stuff going on and it it would go on in each and every one of us if it wasn't for the spirit of God it's the spirit of God that keep Keeps Us straight brother Bram said did he not say if the angel did not come in the room every night when those seals were being open I would have preached this I would have preached that I didn't know what it was I preached love for many years that that was the evidence of the Holy Ghost until an angel comes and tells you that when the spirit of truth comes it'll guide you and lead you to all truth that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen the importance of Revelation to a True Believer hug nice quotes amen hallelujah glory to God he shows her her Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her he shows her that's why she never doubts it that's why she receives it because why he shows her he reveals it to her by Revelation Hallelujah that's why the most important thing that we seek for is the spirit of Revelation Hallelujah not the gifts Hallelujah The Giver of the gifts Hallelujah not a possession Hallelujah not a an authority or anything we seek Him The Giver of the gifts the Holy Ghost you don't stop I know my experience I didn't stop Hallelujah and till I got him and I knew I got him I knew things how did I know how did I know I knew what I was seeing was different than a lot of people moving around the messes moving around the churches fellowshipping here and there I see people seeing the same thing and I see people not seeing the same thing and at the beginning you're going am I seeing something weird or different or you know you go through that when you're mature and you're growing up am I seen something something different or weird like why am I seeing this I still get that to this day things are still breaking on me to this day that's separating me that's what it's doing to the Bride of Jesus Christ it's constantly separating that's what the word does it separates and separates Hallelujah and when that Separation by Revelation is taken place then the other parts of the body of Jesus Christ they are being separated and in the Paradox in separation for the bride there's uniting Hallelujah uniting under the same Revelation under the same umbrella not we're all one big family we're all one sweet church and we're all walking in the Revelation no when you're separated by Revelation then you're United together as the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah let me find my place here H Allelujah he shows her a Word of Life here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word so she doesn't misplace it she doesn't dislocate it she doesn't misrepresent it she knows what he wants done with the word oh by your own intellect no no no no no no she's walking by faith she lives by faith everything she does until Faith Comes she doesn't move she doesn't speak speak is life life is living life is actions life is uh uh decisions life is everything that we are she lives by faith faith gives her life amen faith is life Revelation is life it's not knowledge knowledge puff is up knowledge goes away but when Revelation comes it's life it changes you Hallelujah it changes you it makes you different it makes you live Revelation makes you live this word and people don't understand that very few in the message understand that they think it's knowledge but Revelation is not knowledge it's life it makes you live this word and become part of it Hallelujah they took in Jesus teachings and made certain doct doin they took uh the Apostle Paul's teachings and made doctrines out of them they're doing the same today they're taking William bram's teachings and making their own doctrines and traditions the spoken word is the Original Seed you can't mix that word with dogmas and Creeds the Apostle Paul said all that I have learned that people hold on to to the past and do not let it go but they add it to the new oh there's a lot of going on they don't die out Paul said I had to die to everything I knew I couldn't bring over the Old Testament I couldn't bring over the law I had to die to that so I can see the new the New Testament too many people bring over hallelujah oh I was in Pentecost and maybe Pentecost is still in you oh I was a cathic but I'm no longer Catholic anymore there's no Catholic in me now Hallelujah I've crossed over the Riven Veil where the glories never fail I've passed through that Riven Veil I passed through the inner Veil Hallelujah into the holies of holies I know Hallelujah I know my redeemer liveth I know Hallelujah and that's like you you shall know amen glory to God hallelujah you can't put new wine in Old bottles my brothers and sisters it'll burst your life is going to burst people are starting to burst [Music] Hallelujah a great falling away yeah great bursting are going on right now they didn't die out Hallelujah they weren't given the grace Hallelujah election predestination in this hour to die out to let go Hallelujah get rid of the old they're bursting Hallelujah most of us are aware of the Ten Commandments now listen Hallelujah that God gave Moses I want to point out something here to you all those Ten Commandments which you have have noticed up there until now if you haven't noticed up until now if we understand that we see a little bit of the reason why God gave the law even though he knew that the law could never lead people to become spiritual or live a Godly life in fact Hebrews 86 we see very clearly that the old Covenant was faulty this is the word used in that old Covenant the law was faulty God did God give us something faulty did he make a mistake he certainly didn't he knew the end from the beginning he gave it with a purpose for our help for help to us to see our need the law was given to expose sin we could also say that the law was given to test man to see how many people would be satisfied with the external oh my my brothers and sisters the test man to expose sin to test you to test the people that are legalistic living by the law in this message that want to live by an external not an internal but an external life is a test my brothers and sisters to see how many people would be satisfied with an external righteousness that God brought honor to man and how man would seek God for the inner Purity which alone pleases God hallelujah we see that going on right now my brothers and sisters people living off the external Hallelujah and not going for the inner the inner Purity now listen in the Old Testament time Tabernacle God illustrated by putting a thick curtain between the holy place and the most holy place called The Veil he told the Israelites nobody can come into this Most Holy place the veil blocks you you can come for come so far but no farther Beyond the Veil of God himself living in that Temple the Old Testament Temple nobody could go there even the high priest couldn't go only what once a year and that was only as a token but nobody could ever go there whenever they liked but when Jesus died on Calvary the veil was rent from torn from top to bottom showing that the way of God's presence was open so let me ask you now that Veil is torn and the way into the most holy place in God's presence is open should our standard of Life be higher or lower than the people of the Old Testament the answer is clear if without personal fellowship with god with just the law people can come to a certain standard of life but how much higher of a standard should there be once when you come into Fellowship behind that veil with God himself behind that torn Veil yet many and many Christians don't seem to understand that don't seem to get it Matthew 13:11 because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but it's not given to them to know this is our day my brothers and sisters Hallelujah this is here I'm not preaching denomination out there I'm preaching here the only way that we're going to be build faith is we got to preach it today the day that we are living in we should never live under our privileges as we are today the great powers of God lay Within Reach of every member of the body of Christ things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them and it shall be given unto you you remember when Jesus was speaking to the Pharisees he told them you people who just clean the outward of the cup but don't see your hearts and he wants the inside of that cup cleanse you people will do all the right things externally so people are impressed but God sees deep within he looks into the inner Purity inner motives we can see the Pharisees like Adam covering with fig leaves do you know from the previous study that there is a curse upon that you know that there is a curse upon cursed is everybody who do not live the law but Jesus came and took that curse if we don't take what Jesus did we don't take his atonement and we try to live that law we tried to be legalistic we are actually taking on that curse from the previous study y that is that is why you find that Jesus was in constant conflict with the Pharisees the spirit was always in constant conflict and a True Believer will be always in a constant struggle in the spirit with somebody who lives by the law somebody who outwardly they don't they're they're deceived they don't see it outwardly live in righteousness but inwardly Hallelujah there's a constant conflict the Pharisees who kept the letter of the low down to the Last Detail those doctrines were so correct that we read that even Jesus now listen told even his disciples to follow the teachings of the Pharisees Matthew 23 write it down 2 and 3 have you noticed that he said because whatever they say is right the only thing he said is that they do not do what they teach they don't follow their own example in their life because they're teaching things that they don't practice so there you are nothing wrong with the doctrines of the Pharisees but they don't live what they teach oh there's nothing wrong with the doctrines of the message message people can take it and take it but they don't live what they teach hallelujah amen they didn't have the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament times and yet Paul could say I have lived now listen I have lived with a good conscience before God from my childhood up until this day think about it no Holy Spirit but I've lived with a good conscience acts 23:1 Paul's saying that the Rich Young Ruler when Jesus pointed out these Commandments to him he said I have kept all of these from my childhood up Mark 10:20 I've kept them all Mark Paul says I have a good conscience that I'm pure that I kept it all the laws of God the Ten Commandments it was possible for a God-fearing person to keep these Commandments without the help of the Holy Spirit just by his own strength what did it mean today people talking taking the Law and making their own traditions and to make an outward man look good but the inward Man is dead hiding behind the message of the hour hiding behind truth taking the Law same as Paul did before this conversion the Rich Young Ruler but listen those were nine Commandments but the 10th commandment we look at the 10th commandment and what was the 10th commandment it wasn't external it was internal it dealt with something inward that commandment was you shall not lust or Covenant or strongly desire all these three words mean the same unold unfortunately lust has got an evil Association in people's minds but all it is means is a strong desire like it says in Galatians 5:17 the SP Holy Spirit lusts against the flesh what does that mean the Holy Spirit does not do evil it has got a strong desire against the opposite which is the flesh it Wars against one another and the flesh has got a strong desire against the holy spirit so here is think about it my brothers and sisters here it is Paul the Rich Young Ruler in the message you can live but at the same time the inward there's a struggle with the Holy Spirit there's a conflict you mean that there are people in conflict in war with the Holy Spirit believe in the same message of the hour quoting the same quotes going to the same message Church and living in that constant battle oh yes Colossians 2:6 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the traditions of man after the ruent of this world not after Christ the power of tradition of traditional teaching stops you from going deeper in revealing of the word in your position oh tradition closes the door to your heart the Holy Spirit cannot come into into your experience when you place and believes in something else than the revealed word what is the revealed word you say brother Tim I believe the r you don't see and understand the revealed word until he reveals it to you that's the problem I believe the reveal word I believe I see the problem is my brothers and sisters where people are dis not knowing that they're under this curse under this fulfilling this is that they think they got to reveal word because they can listen to the tapes and they can understand what's being said but that's not what he's saying here Traditions blocks you from receiving the revealed word it blocks you from staying in a position a condition that you're waiting upon God God those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength by what by faith it's staying in a place where you're waiting on God not following Traditions not following the law not following the out outward appearance but waiting in his Spirit a life in his presence waiting for the revealed word to come listen the revealed word you can say in letters that you understand is here it's here in the message the seals have been open but listen have they been open to you they might be here but are they revealed to you is the revealed word being revealed to you or are you blocking it are you blocking it with Traditions are you blocking it with external living and law believ in the same things or are you waiting are you waiting in his presence do I know everything no I'm waiting constantly for that word to be constantly being revealed to me over and over and I can see when you're in that position you can discern when the Devil comes and tempts you like he did Eve and take the word and try to get you off of where you need to be in that place in a certain place with God so he can reveal what he needs to reveal to you Satan blocking what God wants to do hindering what God wants to do in your life what he wants to reveal to you that's the battle that's the greatest battle that's ever being fought right now that's the battle in the mind never been an age so deceiving as this age never been the opposition the distractions of this age like we me and you each and every one of us here are fighting tonight to be in that place with God to wait upon the revealed word to be revealed to us as individuals so that we know how to walk not walking by the law not walking by by the legalist of spirits or any other Spirit thinking we're righteous thinking we have a good conscience like Paul like the like the Rich Young Ruler I've kept it all from my childhood Hood I've obeyed everything in the message let me try to wind this down I got so much I'm just going to continue in the next but God wants this to be brought out the law is not going to reveal to the bride who she is in this hour it's going to take the opening of those seals those Mysteries being revealed to show her who she is that's why we go deep Deep In Christ that's why the treasures that's where the treasures are when she recognizes who she is then she goes deep and deeper and deeper as God is bringing her deeper the open of those Seven Seals was the beginning of the Deliverance of bondage of the great from her false teachings and all her lies about the Bible yes that great Harlot that great don't think it's out there in the Roman Catholic Church that spirit is preminent that's what's causing the mess age that's what's causing the mess in the message people not with a revelation not with a true calling of God upon their life to take this word nothing wrong with the word nothing wrong with re it's pure it can't be handled by man's hands you understand it's got to be revealed by him the spirit in his time and in his season man is trying to handle it do you see what I'm saying man is trying to handle it nobody can handle that I can I give you a revelation tonight no I can't give it you that's what I'm saying but man is trying to handle it the law the letter of the word and try to interpret it as the truth as the truth Jesus said I am the truth the way and the life Jesus says I reveal to my bride nobody else I show her the truth that's where all the Deception comes from hallelujah hallelujah the Lord Jesus was setting his bride feet to manif free to manifest his life the quickening power what did it do Quicken power let see his coming quickening power snatch us as the musicians come from Death To Life quickening power gives us discernment to know what's wrong with you Hallelujah what's wrong with you I don't know what's wrong with you but the quickening power gives you and what to do and what you have done and what you have not done and what you should should have done and what you should be the Quicken and power does all these things the rising of the sun Romans 1:17 for therefore is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written that just shall live by faith the Seven Seals opening those Mysteries should be finished it shows up makes plain Hidden Truths that are sealed and hid all these years years through all the churches and denomination it's revealed Hallelujah the anointed ones at the end time he's opening up the seals and showing it to his church that's what Easter morning did Death seals could not hold him any longer he broke the seals and Rose up providing himself oh that's what he did in your life that's you if you got a true experience with the God and you're really Born Again by the word of this hour that's what happened to you Hallelujah he broke the seal upon your life Hallelujah and he rose up proving himself in the last days that he's alive he's in the church he's in the body he's the same yesterday today and forever and that's been hid from seminaries it's been hid from organization it's hid in these last days in the message is hid amongst the people and it's revealed only in the presence amongst those who are the bride the open of those seals gets the world out of you gets the world out of the bride and the worldly things out of her and church anity out of her Revelations chapter 5 hallelujah amen hallelujah let me just it's revealing the bride and that she's predestinated and her election that she was in his mind before the foundation of the world and remember the third poll was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it the first pull healing second pull prophesying the third poll the opening of the word the Mysteries now being revealed in her our headship is in heaven not on Earth not in Rome but in heaven Hallelujah don't fail to get this the body therefore can cannot recognize any other headship but the word because the head is connected to the body and the body is the head of the word therefore denominations now listen and holy fathers and holy men and holy personalities and everything else like the traditions of man man's opinions man's interpretations is dead dung in the eyes of God he is our headship I will continue this my brothers and sisters hallelujah amen glory to God tonight Hallelujah if this was kind of a mystery to you this kind of preaching you you go home and you listen and you pray Hallelujah you pray and ask God to reveal it to you because remember in this time in this age we're going to bring it out the next service Hallelujah very clearly that we're living in a day and an age that only God can reveal these things and show these things amen and only him hallelujah it's not by man's interpretations man's opinions man has a right to have your opinion but let me tell you state your opinion say it's my opinion unless you can back your opinion or your statement or your interpretation up by the word of God that's what it is that's all it is is your interpretation and your opinion we want to preach the word amen that's what's going to change us and transform us that's what's going to bring us the greatest thing brother bradam seen in the day that he was living in and moving in was the churches were not bringing the people to Christ they were failing to bring people to Christ we don't want to be that we don't bring them to Christ by our own thoughts and our own opinions and our own ways but by the word the revelation of the word we bring them to Christ in this hour he said preach my word and let me reveal it let me interpret it let let me unfold it that's my
