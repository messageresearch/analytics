TRANSCRIPT
========================================
go back to the old history you will see that when God wanted to deal with people the people of Israel and he go into all the different churches and say okay if you start to say that who starts a 90-second no he goes he says Farrell it's time that my people are going to get set free and I'm going to teach what they're not the oldest one that you brought up with me that's how God works and he calls Moses and those who the spirit Moses want to assess that wasn't posted that was Moses that's like you and me the part of us twenty-five years ago I walked into my family [Music] [Music] [Music] so in 1906 there was a man who was born into this world prepared that life brought a message that was going to liberate and you go back and stuck it and you do an actual study on it there is absolutely no way that it happened exactly the way that it all happened to help there's just too much to talk about that but it is what God was doing in the compression of the order and that's why we have the activation because you know since I've talked with ministers I've set to talk to them for for you know four hours we do the word of introducing what seminary to come like the beginning the whole structure like that and start talking to the bringing revelation Genesis to Revelation and tied the word together this no 27 this is the Holy Ghost they wondered why and what is that it's not really himself to an individual he took Paul it's all the Bible the New Testament when God takes an individual now Paul was a theologian filled with all kinds of teachings of God God says go to the desert I'll meet you there you know he was taking them to the desert for to take all of that theology out of it the cleanup a lot of I was only speaking native tradition what mommy said that that isn't in the preset what this was - no this is not even gonna speak you to get a preach my word we're gonna see what mother bird says because that's the only way I can honor my word to stand behind it and so he received the Holy Ghost Paul had received the Holy Ghost of the digna that he was riding on a big horse there and think he's been both killed Christians got whacked about his high horse and filled with the Holy Ghost and all of a sudden his eyes were shattered and blindness but then God says no the meticulous chapels huh and all of a sudden he wasn't dealing Christians anymore he was talking he was out there preaching the Word of God what the power of God was going to do for them and that's what God did for us God's 10 that Samantha Paul was a messenger all of us would be to be easy to change you know you tell people have we got that's right try to come back in the loopers that so many people actually believe Luther when people are saying either he brought the message of justification you need to come out of bondage they're telling you what to do their baptizing babies baptize babies babies a lot of people said here's a cuckoo who's under now he's in history was sleep now he's in history the Pentecostals now they're in history we have analysis into assertiveness find out because of God his truth without promoting man here they're devoting God but without recognizing God's generals and God's prophets and dogs provided way of sending the word to go back to read every one of those books if you see the word of the Lord came to the properties and he said see you can these bones these ep-1 as is our story he said prophesied to those bones you're going to speak to those dry bones in all most churches novels sons and daughters of thought that are bound up under the chains of tradition and circumstance and all those elements you're gonna speak to those trifles and they're gonna rise up as a mighty all these things you know it's [Music] because a son or a daughter thought just when you talk to the all-tournament that see you with your position so that he can use you to hold those planets all hear my voice you cannot deny this truth you cannot deny the stirring in your heart will you hear this word case focusing glory to God let's move along here here brother brother speaking out he goes on to get out and then this is her the message works is faith expressed you know if there's faith in you if there's faith God this dark places faith in his church he's gonna vindicate his church this is not about a man trying to clean what God said no no this is God he puts his word inside of you he starts to manifest the works of faith basis of Revelation a lot of people talk about faith what this big gate is because soon as clear as I can possibly meet you it's the mind of God being telepathically we kneel to you through this work so in other words it gets to my wife and that letter says I'll never forget that night that I asked it was an afternoon she'll remember all the details of that it will comfort her totally just like that I didn't speak that's how this with God in His Church God is people he speaks to you [Music] [Music] there was an enol and then he was he pleased the Lord the dimensional change that's how you change [Music] [Music] [Music] so you're the fantasy now to speak expressed the message now and you might understand now because I preach the scriptures here that's all for preaching Greeks the scriptures here the dates of stop so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man in the days that the church is being redeemed Church P he said in the days that the son of man is being Christ now giving himself in human vessel again a lot of people shocked when somebody says it's greater is He that's in me you really have to believe that in order for it to have effect it's like somebody saying that I know my big brother is right there and he's gonna he's got my back and he knows he's there because his big brother says how he I'll never leave I'll be with you on in every time that he got into a situation if you believe that that itself you're not to fear anything you're not a greater kind apology so here he is now the giving of something the same way he says as was the basis officers should do this come on man in the days that the church is being revealed though in the basics I'm asking what is revealed we know God is making to solve know that right we need the day that the Son of Man is being revealed it will be a big tomorrow is that right well this is the Saints to go back and study Sodom Gomorrah you look exactly what discipline history just look at the Google search so easy you can find out what was going on in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah those were two coastal cities that were an absolute disgrace homosexual ISM at the highest levels you know immorality at the highest levels you know and there was a bed in there unlocked which was Abraham's nephew was inside and they were in there and he was out the bear he was participating in all things it was all part of the situation but yet he knew that it was not right it's like a lot of people that live in this world they're looking at all happen around them this is that we're not to walk there and start condemning the whole sexuals in the lesbians of this madness they're all there because the word said thing would be there and we cannot change those things that's part of the prophecy you can still love them the same way you love anybody else because God can change translate transform and do anything that he wants with anybody okay so don't ever talk to somebody else because of a certain situation or condition they've got to take you not protect me from a life with drug addiction and take that might interfere around and put it into the service if you take a prostitute that he could meet at 11:00 and that's over there and that still got five husbands and the one she's with now is not even hers and God speaking a couple of words to that woman and you know that her testimony have to fuels warned again that she we see the word her testimony converted the whole city and she told him of the power of God for the book amen why because God can take any life he can do whatever he wants with it so we're not right about people's conditions will not look at people's situations [Music] [Music] because okay but we have to do something as a it's got to be awesome Deacon whatever it is you see because that's God's anointing on those officers in those positions but generally sons and daughters of God should be the happiest people on earth they should be happy people they should be always welcoming always ready to put up your hand and say god bless you no it's good to see you god bless you sister every day you need to get on your knees god help get some sanity newbies say alright get this thing away from my life get this atmosphere out of my life I'm not watching anymore I cannot I cannot [Music] [Music] because of my experience at everything so please people on earth who the uprise yes I'm not praying for you that this invisible union is is to bring unity to Prague and prosper the bodies that they strengthen and encourage the body of Christ that's what and who we are is that simple there's no other compromise Christian's down there in their right date they have to be messengers down that right this is not look we have never in all the history of the church ever had a universal messenger to the church then his need ended it had now people at the end of the day it's directly related to God it means that sent from god the father of nation individual and goddess is we giving himself through now brother brother Dileep Rahab was a messenger to the just like the messengers that God sent in two messengers into southern North Billy grave and all robbers were two messengers that God sent into the world and there was no two messengers that preached repentance and those two messages like the other like brother Billy Graham on on repentance and brother Robert something gives to the spirit receiving the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostal movement to call into they were calling [Music] in there Abraham go back to read the book of Genesis Genesis 15 apron and God community when Abraham and Abraham same horn because they practice God showed Abraham come to the discourse on the door of a sense of elation unweighted it up because there's no there's there's not one register I'm just going to whatever the Colorado and his family everything else is going to be the spices when winters 50 40 he says causes I was spared in the world or this tournament obscure there was what 2010 because of the horrible against the you cannot change that prophecy States as was the days of son we're entering into those changes now become public knowledge you cannot be more than talking against homosexuals and it's against the law they've gotten out where it's all become just playing it's simple it's just the way it is you're nothing you're not to walk there and try to protest against it everything else that's not your department work there's people up there that do it because they don't understand the prophecy of this world has to come people God can bring the property judgment and break the rapture and then for us to go into the 1000 year millennial which is 1,000 years of peace here on this earth so this small part of dogs behind Upton sonicator everything is working perfectly together well this is whether the Brotherhood was a and here now these hop the see overall purchase office e-rep yeah william branham is off the seat oh brother look at the he grandma's teeth are any age eight out of six letters everybody knows that the number six represents man is all commands the number seventeen recipe six numbers six digits Brandon never in the history of church charismatic movements and leads of God and everything else was just a coincidence because and aged 87 number condition number that God just like the seven churches seven messengers everything is all perfectly put together and if you look at the name-brand and brandy the wheat he's going to take the wheat it's going to put it into the dark and everything else everything else it's all part of God's plan is just the way this we can't change that but God do these things [Music] but Abraham's name was a TBR aah ATM you go back in the Bible the book of Genesis Abraham father of Nations talks about Abraham's faith in the book of the New Testament in the book of Hebrews talks about Abraham's bacon how he staggered not at the promise of God because they were chosen people Abraham population to the nation of Israel out of people Israel as to the title of the Christian church God's called the elected people everything runs in perfect light perfect turnouts 84 heaven here downtown sense of bread had seven digits safe last three digits at at the end because now the hearts of the children would be see it's all perfect it's everything is the perfect God those ways so the universal church being the letter of and six men made organization yet has received their messenger it had a safety Moody foody knocks counters over the never I have that daughter said the dog says a grand and then he sends a friend they even butter billy graham new brother brandon big to each other he came up from each other's meetings they came up really great came up brother credits meetings all rockets they work together they were listeners never on the field but brother Brandon had a messenger that was going to the sons and daughters of God the elected from the foundations of the world those whose names were written in the last of the white folks who said my sheep hear my voice those that would receive the opening of the seven seals those that without the revelation of the seven churches so that they could place everything age of decision everything and so they didn't look back to industry and denying everything lining up perfectly together because God has a plan God's make it simple enough we can go to you so that you can stand with confidence that you're not just believing some tables this is not me not this is not these are these are people do your own research you will find that this is God's Word maybe this is God's revealed word for this day for this our dividend we're not making another just giving you what was in the industry of what products of the day that were innocence but he says but look but never had is that right but they got and these ambassadors and he's backing that walls as hard as he can never did everybody preach like duty great went around the world from the top he preached the president she prayed for precedence he was all over the world because to the and that's the way it got center grant sent a messenger about sent us a word but return with the investment we destiny for Dane covenant Abraham and his group got a messenger to watch he didn't he'd give them a scientist that the time was near to the fired upon now it's firing out we're looking for there's going to be an atomic there's gonna be a tug of war it's going to be something that's going to spread we already know that there's it will build these bombs because they're not going to use them they're both there there's there's going to be a pretty severe World War there's going to be some pretty devastating defense that are going to take place on the earth no we can't stop that though we're not food sayers you know what I was reaching out sides of us here googled revealed already that's not who we are we both thought was going to take us out of this and we've got faith to live and to love and to be who we are because we can't change it you're who you are because God made you he cannot change this is that simple now that messenger did something he spoke about a woman that he had his back turned to and told her told her she was dummy when he was say her remember when Abraham went and were labelled peasant when God came to visit with Abraham and his wife was there and he was telling Abraham that he was going to have a son that's just like the promise that that God has given us that we were going to bring forth Christ in our lives it's all the titles like the Virgin Mary with the age of 1 to the Virgin Mary or a certain I shall call his name Jesus she will lead the word Angela literally translated a body a seed word body into her that God spoke in turn and it's the same thing now that God was coming to gaybraham and tell them that your wife Sarah she's going to have a son and they were already 75 years old he was older but yet she laughed because she couldn't believe that this was that every body was actually changed a lot of us don't believe there's a lot of service that are in the camp that are there in the world that that are claiming all Abraham and this is not the right seraphim the rapture it will lead to the body change that God's going to make us kill together that thoughts going to translate into the preform is this glorious victory which is Christ his bride and a great feet in the air and she's not in the air somewhere on a cloud it's another dimension just like this one here and we're going to gather into a corner into a supper and that's going to be very long with the sons and daughters of God we're gonna rejoice we're gonna have a good dinner together for three to five years while there's a lot of tribulation we're not in this dimension just as I mention will change all of this it'll be me up Scotty you see that you're in there it's just that simple Jesus group that we came to the earth he walked right through the wall he came right into the room he said that it was sure that there's a there's an eternal body there's one way to this birth the tabernacle Peter saw there's another one that's why this party is going to be but this time it's actually going to be changed it's gonna be like just like Star Trek that's as easy as you can describe it it's going to be putting so much that it's just going to translate and it's not going to give in an old body or it's gonna get brand new 21 year old maybe 20 years old whatever and they don't brag good luck what's holding up and here he's saying now that he spoke about a woman that he had his back to her and told her and told her she was done it he was saying talk to her her condition and what was going to happen is that right that he say that the son of man would be dealing something the same way in that date he's doing the same well do you believe that the truth will here stands a woman and now he was out of meeting now and he was converting they kind of divided listen to this message here that faith is works as expressed he's not leading to a paradigm and look what he says here he says here that luck here stands a wooden dock with surety people got to listen to that message brother Brennan was there he had thousands of fair lives and the Holy Spirit the angel of God would come right variant that we would be standing right next to him and would tell him every detail of the person here league is Andrea best you live at 12:22 Yonge Street yesterday humor and their doctors and the doctor said that you've got cancer and that you are only got four months to live and the doctor had a white gown on it is a black hair that stuff said born before that wouldn't even breathe it off she would jungle rejoice and right there he says appear healed and she never was it wasn't brother gratitude was the power of the Spirit of God vindicated and saying that we better listen to this revelation of this message because the best of days bringing is for my people and I'm not doing these signs and wonders because I want to show up because I'm indicating that means God's healing the Nitza that needs a community we thought we did have communion and it's not about just coming together the deep breath if you want it you're hungry you want to drink a little bit of water you need to do that at home okay you can feed it all beat up get your food and uh this is not about coming together for us as a tradition to eat the Lord's Supper this is about communion with God this about you recognize that human restore you give you a total deliverance from whatever situation financially relationship [Music] because he's still sitting on the support assessor he says well here stands a woman and in the invisible union of the church the pride to Christ that messenger is here which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now I got that whole disorder and I realized how hard was leading and where he was leading us and how he was gonna bring us into communion and how it is that God can do something here this morning we're not here because of a traditional Lord's Supper no sir we've come here because we have come here because my brother hasn't possessing all things is here since under the but by faith tonight in Christ Jesus we shall not take the community not the community you commune as you eat with one another just communing with God he says the communion is not the bread it's not the why is because you have a revelation the community is talking back and forth [Music] and this is a simple that we take that we believe in his death that good body his burial his resurrection we believe in the presence of the Holy Spirit and we believe that he gave us eternal life that we cannot die we have passed from death unto life and some people when we separate from one another here will rise again in the resurrection with each other joined together with Christ Jesus as a that's what the communion because we believe that he's here that we can receive a healing that what we're taking that breath it's not that's incited with Jesus because he were in when he went to the cross you were on his mind you were there you were with him you were born we were going through this experience you were doing you were there his song move before you cite yourself here today and in July 14 2019 before you were here he saw you here he saw you commuting he saw that you have a desire to be to be healed to be restored to be be dedicated to the Lord whatever it is that you have with you God wants to do it for you this morning God wants to set you free gonna give you strength of your body God wants to give your back God must have built a human earier blood pressure got us to deal with that with that power condition gotta move all these things aside diabetes whatever it is I believe it with all my heart amen this week when I was working and I was doing things but life even knows it and something [Music] and within just like that and so I heard your testimony I was blessed Wow and he was fighting up these he wants to send the board at that time he was but he kept at the top and God knew because given the strength that he was doing everything he ever knew and everything else but God is able he's still got something that's cost promises that's God's Word that's available to us this morning there's one testimony after the other after the other that says that God can do it other than we and solar heater count up the votes coming so we're going to go to the Lord's Supper and we will be done by 1:30 by the grace of God and so the ground of speaking here is saying I come this is the best the door he says I come to I come into some what suffering is fellowship you got publishing one with another how about the Lord and you are buddies you are partners and whatever you have he has to whatever he has you have to you see you he becomes you that you might become him and everything is in common then there is another little door in your heart I'd like to speak of this this morning and that other door is the door to me so many Christians now you say Lord you can come in that's right but I don't believe that all the Bible is right I will see what the church says but I let take the wrestler how does the Lord ever going to question them how can he be your Lord and even if he can't get your hearts door of faith you know that feeling is a revelation from God all got us to do is say here to you I mean this have to speak that way he did it right by speaking through the kingdom but it wasn't another kind of set it was the fact like God said to brother Mike through what he said here he and right there and then it materialized in his body because faith is a substance you just have to open your heart to believe that is possible that's it it's as simple as that so just hold whatever it is that you have all the Lord keep it here possible the local medical just hold on to that of us people over here he says my you see already be company he says now over never got a question about can he do to you they'd be here Gordon here if you can't even get near her and you accept it by faith he can come in and you welcome him you open that door and you walk into that faith of yours and you suck with you in the Lord of faith all I want to welcome him this morning to my heart other roots every door how about a sweet I stand there and kiss the cup of blessing with him in the door and sickness Lord all I have and all I have all is yours let's stand at this door Lord and commune with each other let's have communion at the door of faith Lord let's have communion at the door of pride Lord what's happening you have the door of salvation Lord take it all for me Lord fate oh you say off to the church but I believe that the days of miracles is past then you refuse to let the door come even used door upbeat and manifest himself to you you gotta believe that miracles are still possible today you can experience miracle dis morning right now because he still singing he didn't change oh yes you say brother Branham I'm Monty says I'm a Christian he says I grown I mean here you are a Christian and I appreciate that by accepting the Lord but you're living under your privilege you're keeping your door closed you are running from pillar to post and so forth because you don't believe you must open that door faith and back give in then he will give you the desires of your heart upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall walk in that relationship I like to speak to that situation and certainly Greek man shall be raised up and brought into the see and believe that's being done all I believe man is beat that you shall [Music] for I received an amorphous Corinthians 11 that which also I delivered up to you at the Lord Jesus the same magnet which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me you give thanks [Music] [Music] after the sigmundur he talked about when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this Duty is often as you drink it in remembrance of me verse often is eat this bread and drink this cup [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as we take this sanctified [Music] he goes on to say here wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread drink this cup not a man examine himself and let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup but he that eateth and drinketh unworthily in the drinking that we should do soft like the street towards this cause many are weak and sickly among you is or if you judge yourselves and we should not be judged but when we are judged we are cheese therefore my brother when you come together
