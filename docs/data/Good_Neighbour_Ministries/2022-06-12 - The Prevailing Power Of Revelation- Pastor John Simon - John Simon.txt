like to read from psalm 66 man make a joyful noise onto the god holy lands sing forth the honor of his name make his praise glorious say unto god how terrible are thou in thy works through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee all the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee they shall sing to thy name salah come and see the works of god he is terrible in his doing towards the children of men he turned the sea into dry land they went through the flood on foot there did we rejoice in him he ruled by his power forever his eyes behold the

thank god for every one of them let's give them a hand [Applause] amen everyone musicians singers worship leader you can tell effort and faith and sincerity is being put into all of this and that it's been received by the congregation with great joy amen matter of fact i uh heard the deacons and the uh praying praying sincerely that god blessed the worship team and bless the singers and bless the people and everything else they were just praying uh carried away by the holy spirit but we thank god for that amen glory to his name hallelujah i want for us to read from matthew chapter 11 verse 25 i'm going to meet afterwards with the deacons trustees and then i'm going to meet just briefly with the worship team praise god and we'll just try to move along praise god matthew 11 verse 25 and that reads like this at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight thank god we thank the lord for his word let us pray father we thank you for the reading of the word now lord it's all up to us and you father for it's your glory your word your promise and we are gathered together on your day as your people to receive the bread of life from you we pray you'll bless us everyone we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen god bless you please be seated hallelujah we come together to praise and magnify his name and i want to talk today on the prevailing power of revelation the prevailing power of revelation we have always talked about revelation you've heard me preached about revelation and it's not a time we come together and we speak about the word that we don't speak about revelation because as you know in the church age message the prophet said the importance of revelation by this spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized but you see we've always talked about revelation through the message we've always talked about how god makes himself known to us but what really caught my attention maybe later late you may say i'm a lit learner but that's okay but it's just struck me that he said the importance of revelation by the spirit not to the church not to the group not to anything else but the power of the revelation is to the individual believer and that is what i'm here to talk about he said the power to the individual believer that's when the revelation becomes powerful because it goes into the individual combustion chambers and then when that blasts out there's sparks of fire uh and the holy spirit is able to grant that believer dynamics on the mechanics that they have already received you'll receive the teaching the mechanics of the word and that was piled up into you but now let the fire fall upon the mechanics that were there and set the fire that we might go forth in the power of the holy spirit to carry out the will of god now he said when i say revelation i'm talking about all revelation see it's important to the individual true believer and it's tremendously important to the church now he brings that afterwards right only because when many people with individual revelation come together that you have an assembly a called out assembly right so there is where he's talking about praise god and with a revelation is what is the key to the entire bible because if you don't have it you can read it that's fine but you don't have the key so the door will not open it will not reveal and so revelation is the key that god has given to us now you know these things when he said the key of david and all of that and i alone have the power to open a power shut and when i shut no man opens when i open no man's shots praise god it's god using the power of revelation to the individual hallelujah now as an individual uh listen matthew in the book of matthew when he said here to them matthew 16 whom do men say that i am and you say oh lord some say you're jeremiah some say you are uh you know you're this one moses some say you are elias some say lord john the baptist or whatever uh you know and then he says oh so that's men's interpretations and men's ideas of who i am maybe they've written great treaties and great books on the matter of who i am maybe they've raised up colleges and seminaries and gave great bible studies and eloquent talks of who i am but ah that's good but i don't want to hear that who do you as an individual say that i am have you got a personal private relationship from god of who i am oh my so but whom do you say that i am oh my praise the lord hallelujah now we know that the catholics do say uh that the church is built on peter but we know that that's not so the pentecostals and the protestants say it's built on jesus and that's all also not so it's not built on jesus but it's the revelation on who jesus was and is the revelation that not this flesh called jesus that god dwelt it was not built on that but it was built on who he truly was that he was jehovah god manifesting himself through that flesh that was called jesus god in flesh appearing praise god it's not built on the man jesus that was born of mary but is built upon jehovah god of heaven that lived in a man named jesus christ hallelujah oh praise god amen oh my praise god now my flesh and blood has not revealed this to you not theologian can no school can flesh and blood has not revealed this onto you and can never reveal this onto you no matter how eloquent no matter how well spoken no matter how well trained they cannot reveal this onto you amen flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven hath revealed this onto you and upon this rock this rock of the revelation of who jesus really is amen i will build my church hallelujah so the church is built on what on the revelation of who jesus was when we look at this the church ages what do you see the foundation no i i just place in there jesus christ son of man but you'll see when uh brother branham's written it just has a thin sliver at the bottom he doesn't say anything but really what he's showing you is that the foundation of the entire pyramid of the church ages is built upon the foundation of the thin three and a half years ministry of who jesus was and that's what the entire church is built upon oh blessed be the name of the lord god now he says here how did abel know what to offer how did he know what to offer as a proper sacrifice to god what book what what book did he read where did he learn what school did he go to no bible was written nothing was written flesh and blood did not reveal this to him but the father in heaven reveal this unto abel he said but did cain get such a revelation no he said cain and abel they had a commandment to sacrifice they had a commandment but one by revelation with the one hung on to the commandment if you had the written word then cain would have held on to that written word and said look what it says here and he's arguing with you on that but abel had the written word but he also had a revelation from god on that commandment that was received hallelujah and we have it even today a lot of people are living christ living christianity by commandment they're living but look i see it there we supposed to do this i'm not supposed to be angry under this circumstance i'm supposed to act this way and i'm supposed to do that they're doing it by my script you understand they're doing it like you have a play and you have a script and you have to act according to that script they don't realize the holy spirit is there with the believer who believe that they are improvising but they are not because the spirit in them is moving them spontaneously by divine revelation hallelujah praise god hallelujah i want you to know my friends the greek word for revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling hallelujah let me just join a few more here unveiling or exposing uncovering or revealing praise be to god hallelujah i want you to see this now you see about by faith received the revelation of the blood can did not get such a revelation he had a commandment see he could offer a sacrifice too but one did it by what revelation the other did it by commandment see oh my oh and it was just that revelation that made the difference for abel and gave him eternal life or recognized that he had amen and that's the difference brother sister don't underestimate the little thing you think oh you we especially if you're in a message you start taking it ordinary oh i i got the revelation of the last prophet's message and you just sing it it becomes a sing song and the people don't realize the importance of it that that one little rock that you're standing on that one little faith one little scripture one little thought that's empowering you that is the thing that makes the difference between you and billions in this entire world that you are different you're born for a purpose you place them here with a purpose from the presence of almighty god amen listen individual you might even take what your pastor says now somebody may say oh i'm i'm putting down pastors uh or we don't need the five-fold ministry because here the prophet is saying no that's not what is being said but your eyes should be off the pastor of the prophet and on to the bridegroom amen that's where your eyes ought to be on the bright room get your eyes on him by revelation praise the name of the lord see all my you may take what the pastor says you may take what the seminary teaches they may teach it with eloquence but until god reveals it to you you don't have nothing amen god has to reveal his word to you and then that word becomes something to you that jesus is the christ hallelujah reveals to you that the blood cleanses you reveals to you that it is god that is your savior amen not now a third person or whatever but god himself amen you're saved by the blood of god you're redeemed by the blood of god hallelujah that's why we here this morning praise god not by formality but by revelation of the holy spirit of the living god amen yes sir it is this spiritual revelation that does it now here's another thing why revelation is of great importance to you for offense and for defense listen satan hates revelation amen he hates revelation and why because it reveals his end but let me let me let me give you some things here he hates revelation because revelation is really god telling us about the devil his character his works and all the strategies that he gonna try to he's going to use against you before he does it god reveals it god reveals all his moves that he he's gonna do god revealed to us the devil's beginning and right there we know he's not a god he's coming to an end because he at the beginning he's not the creator he is a created being he is subject to the almighty god hallelujah he's nothing but another subject but a wicked one hallelujah god showed his beginning that even though he is a spiritual being even though he's a religious being amen yes his beginning was in the midst of wars miss whisper campaigns rumors lies and everything else god reveals to us his beginning and he reveals to us the trail of the serpent his entire uh walk through the entire earth god reveals that to us also that he is his trail that he's walking on and then reveals to us his final end so we don't have to look in the crystal ball we just look in the bible we exactly can tell the devil his future like the one man came to me on the street and said oh i see this light around you i see this light around you i want you to know that i was sent to you uh to well when he got there to tell me this that i said just a minute you were sent to me i said you you've got it wrong i was sent to you and you're going to tell me my future i know my future i'll tell you your future you step back i said i see flames and when they started talking he took off in a speed he just ran for his life let me tell you something the devil is scared of being exposed if you can hide behind a religious mask and captivate your credibility and captivate your emotions captivate your sight your hearing your smelling use all kinds of means to control and to contaminate your faith he will but the moment he's exposed the light shines on him he runs for cover like an old rat roach or something else i thank god in this hour that there is a man here we can't see but he's here turning on the light for us that we can recognize who we are who the devil is what his end is going to be blessed be the name of the living god he hates to be exposed and he is coming to his end and not only him but all his followers whether it be angels that fell down here with him or whether it be human beings on the earth that he controls and manifests himself through they're coming to their end for the word of god says so hallelujah now you see right now he is fighting everything and doing all he can to do what destroy confidence in the world but when the church believes satan amen disbelieve satan and believe the spirit's revelation of the word then that gates are hell cannot reveal against her hallelujah then he begins to talk about his gift and then in talk speaking of his gifts he said you know when the devil can sense with the gift that is in my life of discernment that is now about time when i'm going to start calling names and when he knows i'm going to start calling names then he says he starts to manifest and you i can look and see the prophet is talking how some people faces begins to you know change and gets grotesque and showing various things amen you see for satan got a hold of their lives through sin indifference and true disease and you should see their faces because satan knows he is going to be ex exposed and the most peculiar changes come over them people's county nonsense why satan is afraid he knows the spirit of god is about to let the people know about his works of what he has done in their lives see the whole night and that's why he had meetings like this you see for when names are called and disease is revealed satan hates it because it's by revelation of the holy ghost oh praise god forevermore i want to thank god my friends that when satan hits now the opening of the world for the world is revealing his true character even though he hid in the church for seven church ages hiding under this guise of religious and enticing spirits hiding there and trying to undermine and contaminate and create chaos in the kingdom of god now the seven seals have been revealed and his character and his true works are now being exposed in a brighter light by many brothers who have received the genuine revelation of the word of god hallelujah and worst of all the revelation has come down to the individual and the seventh seal is now calling the names of the elect blessed be the name of the lord the devil can't stand it because your name is being called why he said not not james jim or whatever but while the word is being preached the revelation that is going forth is calling out to somebody some heart the deepest calling back to the deep and the deep response back to the word hallelujah god calling our names by the opening of the word that part of the word that called me might not be the partner called you the part that called him might not be the part that calls her but my god your name is in there praise god and when that word is preached when the seals are open your name is being called [Applause] hallelujah he hates the book he hits the revelation of jesus christ when it's in the church because he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today forever he knows amen more he knows that he knows more than 90 percent of them so-called theologians he knows that god has never changed his nature and he knows that if the church gets back to the original church like it was a pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action the true church and all its claims oh my all else will be proven to be false and counterfeit hallelujah see oh my yes sir for the true church is a continuation of the book of acts blessed be the name of the lord god he hates people also knowing of the revelation of two spirits operating right in the church in the religious realm he said he hates people knowing that he wants them all to think that that that yeah but uh there's another quote i'm just bringing this to my mind now he says yes he says the church what he says god deals with the individual not with the group because in any group there is renegades there is wickedness there is all kinds of rebels in there so he says organization groups and all that out the door god is dealing with individuals hallelujah and so he he doesn't want to expose that he is operating in the church in the religious realm or to the people hallelujah because there's one brother sweet as anything else and there's another one over there also sweet but underneath that sweetness using that outside character for all kinds of wickedness and evils and manipulation and lies right the devil can lead you along for years and all of a sudden that brother who you were putting your faith on bang he falls he said well if that man was so true and he fall i might as well forget all this you see you weren't looking the right place your eyes your heart wasn't based on the right thing amen hallelujah now think of it this means this revelation is not to anyone it's not to everyone hallelujah praise god it will take a special class of people do you believe that yes praise god people with spiritual insight praise god it not mean you're smart therefore you got all these smart sharp intellectual insights no but he's talking about you having the inside teacher that the holy spirit in you who is going to teach you and be a witness to you to the word by saying in your heart that's right you just heard it but you don't know why you believe it but something and you spoke to you and say that's right just as simple as that that's right he's a witness in you testifying back to the world that that word is right it's thus saith the lord hallelujah amen praise god so satan hates that he hates that he doesn't want it see praise god for we will be powerless when the true church knows that amen hallelujah oh my when this particular church private i'm talking about the local church here hit some years ago at that point where the holy spirit revealed to us not to be just naive and every religious uh so-called person that says they believe the message every preacher that comes by and say i'm a preacher the message he exposed some of those before us he exposed even individual brothers that come in the church and they are doing this and doing that and then pulling all manner of tricks and all kind of things on the side and the holy spirit exposed them and what was he doing teaching us not to rely on just sight and sound and emotions and your own impressions but to rely on the revelation of the holy spirit by the word of god hallelujah blessed be the name the lord and two spirits operating in the church and he hates that revelation but we love it because with that true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us amen but we will prevail against him praise god so it takes a special class of people praise god and that's something else you sit here so ordinary and god is calling you a special class of people you're special in his eyes he calls you the apple of his eyes he calls you the stars in this crown that calls you his glory the joy of his life amen praise be to god hallelujah oh praise god a special class of people people with spiritual insight listen to god's prophet it will take a people with the ability to hear from god some don't have that ability unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom unto them it's not given amen you're all praise god hallelujah oh my you might have been born deaf or thinking that you're deaf but the holy spirit casts out that death devil from you that you can hear praise god by the spirit of almighty god amen now you're hearing the word of god hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah oh a special class of people willing to with the ability to receive spiritual instruction the willing to learn hallelujah become children in the sight of god unwilling to learn praise god let me say to you there there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the world and that's why i'm talking about it the prevailing power of revelation and in particular to the individual when they have received it and then no i'd like to repeat it let me say it again somebody may catch it they know and they're certain of god that they know they know and they know that they know praise god it is it's like because now he can't shake you anymore because you know that you know and when he starts coming and talking to you get away from me the word is says so so so it's been revealed to me praise god hallelujah i know it by revelation no the pastor didn't give me the deacon didn't give me it's the holy ghost that gave me praise god and it lines back up with the word it lines up with the entire message from genesis to revelation most that's why brother branham said you know the revelation that you will get most of the time it'll take you from genesis you may be right away you can't see it but it will always take you from genesis right back to revelation right back to revelation it runs through the entire bible because it's all in him it's all in him and he is perfect every everything blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah but remember revelation of god must come for each age and it only comes at a specific time you could have received the message been listening to the prophet of malachi 4-5 for 40 years and that's fine but the revelation of what he has said and what he has he's put out in the storehouse he said that is only going to be revealed at a specific time and you remember also i've always used that quote he said they will know when it is time for them to know and i believe now is the time i believe this is the hour it's breaking everywhere brothers are catching the word of god catching the revelation of the word of god not just the written word but the revelation of the word of god hallelujah oh blessed be the name of god i give god praise and honor and glory amen think of it some of them getting it by education oh they think they get it by education oh but the spiritual sages of god are getting it by revelation oh hallelujah oh praise god and let me tell you i'm quoting brother branham here one by revelation one by education or if we can just open that up you because you know there is lots of material laying behind that there amen praise god hallelujah one by education and one by revelation hallelujah o praise god so the church is really built on the individual revelation of who do you say that i am praise god hallelujah oh my think of it oh my now you cannot make a holy church there is no holy church nor no holy organization you know if you even take this message and start thinking one particular church is a holy church you're right off the word right there see god did not send the prophet to set up shrines sacred places he did not even he did not even pray god will make his bones sacred even though we know just as elijah's bones the quickening power will still be there with him but that does not mean that we have to go and pray by his grave it doesn't mean that his grave has to become an international shrine we respect it we love him we recognize who and what he represents but my friends the glory of god is in this world the power of god is in this world the revelation of god is in this word hallelujah there is no such thing as some holy church all the organization yes the holy spirit can be preached in it but in that group that you'll find good you will find the bad you'll find the renegades you'll find the indifferent you'll find everything else hidden in there see er no organization or group can hold see you can't say we got it none of the rest of them has it for the holy spirit is not poured out on groups it's poured out on individuals let me repeat it's the individual praise the name of the lord hallelujah oh my oh praise god now all down to the edges they receive the holy spirit but not in the measure we have it now praise god because the look it's been rising higher and higher the octaves going higher and higher the tide rising higher and higher and now we have to battle against all the demons of all the other ages and so god had to raise the standard oh praise god and the measure of the holy spirit they he said they don't have it in the measure we have it now because this is a restoration back to the first hallelujah amen now he's talking to the church ages there so he's talking about going back to the original pentecost but what we're talking about now is going right back to jesus christ the seed is that right going right back to the original seed where we come from the mind of god and we're going back to the mind of god but before you go to that you got to pass through the original church age thing right you got to pass through that but we are back to the original seed where god is making himself known through the individuals blessed be the name of the living god now he said this tabernacle here we'll say this is where he comes to church this tabernacle is not a holy ghost tabernacle there is no such a thing it's talking about the building right it doesn't matter whether it's this building that building even this building that we're sitting in here today that he's talking about he's saying this tabernacle this building is not a holy ghost tabernacle you see individuals that come into this church is the holy ghost tabernacles hallelujah they are the tabernacles that really contain the holy ghost but not the church not the group amen for there it runs out hallelujah praise god these individual tabernacles are in that tabernacle or in that building or in that group praise god hallelujah oh blessed be the name aren't you glad to be one of them amen now remember individual the power of prevailing revelation to the individual everyone has to live a private life with god for it's an individual private individual affair with these things of the spirit that carries you off into places that sometimes you dare not even speak of oh praise god hallelujah oh praise god i'm so glad for that because that is the truth now the pregnant person with the seed of god there alone is enough there for you to chew on the word in there now manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of god that the word and the word alone begins to manifest itself through that person that prisoner that individual hallelujah what he's saying here that when the person really catches a true revelation it starts helping them to clean up their life until he uh he begins to project himself in a clearer and brighter manifestation of his divine person through the individual and that makes them use the word prisoner a prisoner to christ the anointed world it makes them a prisoner to the world hallelujah praise god i wonder how many prisoners are in here i believe i'm one of them i believe i'm one of them i i like i always said it's too late for me to turn back now it's too late for me to stumble along the way hallelujah pressing on the upward way praise god now it's to the individual listen close and all hell is against this teaching now i've always read that and believed that it meant just everything that he said his entire message the devil is against his entire of course the devil is but what he was emphasizing here now the devil is against this teaching of him showing that the individual revelation is the foundation of the anti-church of the living god hallelujah and all hell is against this truth and it is the truth for jesus never said peter you and john and all the rest of you you've got the revelation now uh the whole church is saved because you got it no he says jesus said it's to you unto him personally i say unto thee peter hallelujah he didn't say but i'm calling brother branham he didn't say not to them right but to thee thou art peter and upon this rock of individual revelation to one individual person upon this rock is what i'm gonna build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it hallelujah flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but upon this revelation amen i'll build my church listen in them right in them and all the gates say hell will never be able to prevail against that or withstand that amen praise god hallelujah well of course he's telling you ahead of time prepare for a battle because all hell is going loose against that teaching all hell is going to be loose against you when you realize your importance of who you really are and what is inside you sometimes you're going to even wonder when you're on your job where you're on the street why why did that person get angry at me for no reason why did that person want to lash out against me i didn't do them anything i tried to be good do everything i can for them and all of a sudden they hit me for what and you don't know but that devil knows what is in you hallelujah and he hates the revelation of jesus christ that's reflecting itself through you effortlessly you don't have to walk around trying to be a christian or let people see you that you're praying at six o'clock early in the morning and that you're uh this man is always up very early at 4 30 and he's walking down in the gardens with his book open praying what a godly man what a godly woman amen amongst the world we're going to have a fast from fish on a certain day oh what does man sacrifices all life that he might live for you see it's not based on that it's based on the revelation of the word of god and the power of the holy spirit in the life of the individual and the devil hates that when you recognize that and you you realize what god is doing with you amen praise god hallelujah all the gates of hell will never come be able to withstand that and just after that listen what he says and not one hair on your heads will perish hallelujah because when the devil comes he knows coming against you as an individual and most of the time you can wait while you are by yourself you got no helper wrong you know other brother you can call on the only person you can call is look onto the rock from whence come with your help your help coming from him oh above christ god that's where you got to look for your help praise the name of the lord jesus amen there is the revelation there it is it's never to them but it's to him an individual not to a group but to he repeats an individual all hell is against that that's what the the devil is against hallelujah and so you see his mystery is really only revealed to his beloved bride and no one else can see it hallelujah but god reveals it to his beloved bride can i share some more things with you here praise the name of the lord hallelujah i don't want to run so far ahead that you're not seeing me anymore and you can't follow or you start falling asleep on me is that right i want you to wake up and recognize what you're hearing spiritually and naturally whatever is the case raise love listen listen one side has got it by intellectual conception but the true sight of god has it by the revelation of jesus christ not by the written word they have it praise god this is a message called escape hither come down quickly amen are we going to escape and go to him quickly are we going to escape out of here and go home quickly be with him quickly he is saying here not by intellectual conception from one side but the true sight of god has it by revelation of jesus christ and not by the written word i hope a lot of brothers would but see this and recognize what he's saying it's not that you put away the bible you're not going to read the bible you don't know what the bible says but he's saying that is not what if they had that for hundreds or hundreds of years and it didn't get any better it's a revelation that elevates the church and puts her in the rapture amen you see blessed be his holy name for his god himself must reveal it to an individual and quickly they become deity on the inside of them praise god you believe deities on the inside of you it's not me saying it i'm quoting it here right here praise god the spirit revealed truth of the word of god blessed be his name god revealing himself to the individual and quickly he becomes deity within within the inside of him or them amen praise god that's how he takes his enthronement in you the individual by the revelation of the affair with the word of god hallelujah then if the personal individual affair with the person is revealed to you and you say he's been revealed to me then the life of christ produced here in the bible that same life that was in him if that does not produce itself in you you've got the wrong revelation it doesn't mean that you caught the revelation the veil has ripped all of a sudden you become a saint john or a saint jim or whatever no but the life that was in christ will begin to project working out your salvation day by day and moving you from glory on to glory onto glory because it's working in you the individual praise the name of the living god hallelujah for his presence in that individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself as the living word that's promised for that day he begins to express through you have you got that he begins to express to you and that's a vindication of the great revelation of god your little small revelation of your life amen is the revelation is the vindication of the overall great revelation of god hallelujah and look it's never like that in a group it's only in an individual never in a group for his identification he says remember is with the individual not the group do you get that the congregation said amen he said let me say it again he is not with the methodist not with the baptist not taking that to the press material not to deluterant not to the pentecostals hallelujah that's the prophet stop there because that was his day but not even as believers and followers of william branham's message it's not coming to them as a group it only comes to you as an individual hallelujah see but it comes as an individual him taking one and leaving one you believe that amen that's right two working in the field and he takes one and he leaves one both preaching what laboring in the gospel feel but he takes one and he leaves one oh my oh see that's the way it is it's not a group it's a personal vindication of the pregnant child of god with the holy spirit in them they don't care about nothing else hallelujah but allowing the holy spirit to live and to pulsate his life through them and express himself to the people and to the rest of the world praise god you see now that's his crisis the mystery of god revealed and now um that's another page he's speaking here and when it comes he said it comes to pick up the predestinated seed that god had already predestinated in his mind before the foundation of the world so the great eagle is flying over and he's coming now to do what he says here he picks up only the predestinated seed of god that's what he's doing right now calling your name calling the sons and daughters of god and calling you up to come up here though fly up where mommy daddy is flying praise god come into the greatness and the power of the holy spirit amen oh how wonderful to know praise god now identify christ of all ages i'm quickly coming to a close of this but i want to get this all in is that okay now remember this is to you as an individual before god and you have now got to take this and stand on your own two feet did you hear what i said there oh my i don't need the pastor no it's not that you don't need the pastor but god is telling you stand on your own two feet not on your pastor's faith not on the deacon's faith not on your mother your brother your sister whoever holy person not even on brother branham's faith hallelujah but catching the revelation because another place brother he's saying here in the church age book he says you see they have to see what the messenger of the age had already seen what was already revealed to him right and when they began to catch what was revealed to him what was in his mind when he's saying certain things when certain things was being oh my he says that's here praise god you catching the revelation of god he said which is first given to the messenger and he broadcasts it matter of fact i should quote that and let you hear it he says see each one has got to stand on their own two feet is that right you believe that and that's the testing time we're going through right now the devil is buffeting all the oak trees to see which ones are going to fall over which one the branches are going to break off you know which one all the leaves uh strip off from it all the joy gone all the salvation gone and all the peace of mind gone this gun brotherly kindness gone you know the wind passing false winds all kinds of ideas from your friends your family associates blowing away your your thoughts on the word of god and you it begins to shake you and that's god's plan in this hour to shake the heavens shake the earth shake it again and let everything get exposed and everything find its rightful place where it's supposed to be for the glory of god hallelujah yes on your own two feet for you are the one that has to make that testimony individually oh not my church and being said oh that's a good church that's a godly church no it's you the individual for each one of you has got to answer to god now for the revelation hallelujah you got the answer to god for the revelation what did you do with the pearl of great price that god placed in your heart what did you do with that it's just he said here like on the day of pentecost people were laughing at them and saying what they're talking about these men are just full of new wine that's why they're talking that way amen they weren't too far gone they had new wine in them but it was different from what they were thinking right now wha you see why you see it was god that's what was happening it was god revealing himself to them individuals and that's what made them behave that way they are saying tongues they don't understand what got them so excited and make them start jabbering and jibbering and speaking in tongues it was not the tongues that got them filled with the holy ghost but they got filled with the holy ghost by the revelation of what the holy ghost was revealing to them and they got so excited with it they tried to talk to one another and their words start coming out like that amen you see they were rejoicing because it was the individual revelation which is faith that was being revealed hallelujah and that's what it was all about amen praise god hallelujah oh praise god each one of them receiving and now this is our time isn't it this is pentecost back there i'm quoting from trying to do god's service without it being god's will but now this is the pride calling this is the calling of the bride the seven seals have been opened your names is what is referring to there your name's now being called praise god and the complete things that them reformers and all them is now opened up to you amen hallelujah it takes the revelation straight from god to the individual to do so it can't come to that group no it has never done one man one person individual it is always that way that's what god promised in the shadows of the coming for his bride praise the lord here and i wrote a note there rebecca rebecca when that messenger came to her he came to her and she saw that she had the qualities of hearing and so on in her she went to her uh to her family and told them what who this man was what happened to him and this and that and then what happened the oscar will thou go with this man whatever he told her about isaac without seeing him with her eyes she said yes i will go amen and that's what we did we haven't seen him yet but but we have heard but the the hour is coming now you see praise god oh my she said i will go with this man amen praise god and she accompanied the messenger talking with him along the way which brother branham has done and sharing with us all the wonderful things about isaac he did this he did that he's that kind of person he's this kind of person and she asked all the questions questions and answers and everything else and you know honey begins to answer and talk all the way but the bible says isaac loved to go for a walk and as he was walking in the fields praise god remember jesus is going to meet us in the air halfway right while she was yet on her way she looked and saw this man walking in the fields oh praise god hallelujah and she said it's that and he said yes behold the lamb of god this is the man oh praise god hallelujah oh my listen go read the scripture she lifted up her eyes she's not looking at the sceneries and all these churches and all these kind of beautiful things and wonderful things around her she lifted up her eyes oh my and the bible says and she looked but then it says a very important thing after that and she saw praise god when you look what do you see what do you recognize amen oh praise god the rest of the love story you know she jumped off the camel and run towards him amen and he runs towards her the deep calling to the deep they recognize one another the word calling back to the word amen oh bless god i was reading there brother branham said that he said the wolf called he said and they answer their make answers in the valley the eagles screamed hallelujah and he says now jesus calls from his word amen hallelujah calling to what calling and he uses the word he is now calling to his mate amen calling out to his mate amen oh praise god hallelujah i'm closing with this quote now this is expressed to one person relative to the word only one messenger comes to each age and receives what the spirit is saying to that age that one messenger to the true church he speaks for god by revelation to all the churches bought true and false right he's speaking to both true and false he speaks for god by revelation the message is then broadcast to all everybody hears his message but so it has brought cast for all who come within range of his message the message is received only individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of of that group is the ones who have the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by the way of the messenger and those who here are not getting their own private revelation that i used to first of all uh you might have had that problem i had that problem when i was crossing over from just uh you know written word to revealed word and like that and what are these things where am i getting these ideas is am i making these things up in my own mind or the devil starts playing tricks with you to try to tell you oh that's you just you it's not a private interpretation it's the holy spirit revealing himself to you see oh my see those who hear this are not getting their own private revelation nor is it a group getting a collective revelation there's no uh william branham group getting a collective revelation they got a collective message but they're not getting a collective revelation see oh my but each person individual again hearing and receiving you can hear it and not receive it but hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from god hallelujah so we are now seeing what one man already saw it's nothing new that we're adding on making uptake in a way nothing like that you maybe don't understand that you may be in seeing it but this is what the messenger already had and this is the hour when they will know when they are time for them to know and we are knowing it now as it's being revealed to us by the holy spirit and i want to praise god come on up musicians and i want to praise and thank god that i can say like bartenders i was blind but now i see oh praise god once sat alone by the highway begging his eyes were blind he could not see but thank god this message the word of god has been revealed amen oh praise god i thank god everybody making claims of of catching revelation the devil isn't confusing trying to confuse even at this stage where we're talking about revelation revelation revelation everybody all of a sudden we're talking about catching revelation but you know what you're gonna know because if you have it the genuine revelation and you hear it you see it you discern it the watchmen on the walls of zion are going to see eye to eye you don't even have to know the individual you don't have to know them they just start talking and you see the whole thing fits fits fits fifth fifth fifth fifth and you know they got the same thing you got you got nothing different we give god the praise and so it's supernatural and the devil hates it because it's not nobody organizing a bride organizing a group it's nobody's hands in getting all the ministers together it's not anybody's hands and pulling all the churches together no that's the job of the holy spirit working in the individuals and letting them do it not because of emotions because of loving this brother loving that sister loving this group or loving that group no it's the holy spirit will do it on an individual basis and all the redeemed are going to be gathered in for the glory of god hallelujah you got a song from your brother praise god you got one praise the name of the lord i asked him if he got one but you really got two so we think god bless you brother we have this for brother uh uh brother joshua ancestor he's behind me oh it changed places oh you let him sit down today and you change places you can take this when you're going praise god hallelujah god bless you everyone [Applause] i'm going to meet with the trustees and deacons i'm going to meet with a worship team and i'm going to just briefly i'm going to talk with them also about setting a date or a time for a general church meeting is that right okay so um prepare yourself for that let me also mention to you that um i've had contact i've received a brochure or pamphlet of brother george smith making a trip to israel once again and i told him uh i would like to go to israel at least in my mind one more time that should be on the 28th of november coming back on the 8th of december praise the lord and it's going directly to israel and spending the time there two nights or two days and nights will be spent at the dead sea uh at the dead sea and uh also of course many sites that will be seen there uh you know masada you know banya uh uh caesarea philippi caesarea uh by the sea and uh and so on capone um many many sites you'll be able to experience you'll be able to see the caves where the uh where the dead sea scrolls were found and so on and uh may god help you i would like to go and i would like um whereas many of you that may feel led to go and certain individuals i would love to for them to go to have the experience and come back with a first-hand experience and to speak from the word it makes a whole lot of difference when you know and seen some of these things we'll go to the garden tomb where where jesus was joseph of aramethia and see the place of skull you know of course as usual people breaking off pieces here and there but the first time i went to see it there was a skull outline clear you can see it clear uh you know just like we had the word eagle in the rock there when i saw it it was there clear i go back years later people dug it out i was to me i didn't want to even touch it but brother pear green looking at it there when they go back nothing is there they dug it all out the rocks that were on the ground that were in the little pyramid shape all gone you know until the owner of the place were restricting people from going up there but i would love for you to go even if it's once in your life once in your lifetime and so we're going to have that put up in the back it should be there by wednesday afternoon and you'll be able to see it all to you and then you put your pennies dollars pounds whatever you have you put it together pennies doesn't work anymore praise god you start from now and you put it together now uh brother george is saying a 500 down payment now and the rest you can pay incrementally as you go or you can pay towards the end i think at the end of september you can pay the rest of it and uh everything else will be taken care of hotels food buses traveling around there all is covered within that amount amen praise the lord you of course will want to work walk with your own extra for purchasing anything else you're going to see there because a lot you know they have a lot of products of themselves for health for beauty for whatever it's all there that you can purchase so you walk with your own and if you want to tip anybody or anything else you want to walk with that of your own but all in all start putting your treasures together and prepare to go we'll be by the wailing wall by the way we have a day where we are allowed to go to the whaling wall and um we'll see solomon's temple where all the all the pillars tumbled down broken down not one left on the other praise god so uh it's something for you to go and see even if it's once twice three times in your life for me i've gone there seven times and i want to go for the eighth time i believe that will be the last time i will return there praise god but i want to do it for this uh it time and praise god his god hasn't gotten old-fashioned to me but every time something newer is revealed and made known to me we will stay again uh some different hotels better newer and the last place we'll sit ramat rachel hotel which i know is near by the mediterranean and you know this beautiful site and then from there we go up to jerusalem you know jerusalem is on a hill down hills we go up to jerusalem and then we'll spend time in there walking around seeing where jesus was imprisoned seeing where the valley that they led him over to the pilot's judgment hall we'll see all of that and uh where they prayed in the garden the olive trees are still there after thousands of years they are still alive and they're still growing maybe some are dead i don't know but most of them are still there in the garden the only thing you'll have to put up with is the catholics have gone in there and quickly they bought up a lot of these places and built cathedrals around them and put a wall or whatever and of course you you you either have to pay to go in to see some of it but like i said all of that is think care of but the fact is that um i was thinking when i first went that my that um they've got everything they take up all mary's well and this place and that way they've gone all over the place and i was it was no i made them do that to preserve it for you you know if god didn't use them to preserve those places the prevailing um culture of that place they would have broke up all those things and tear them down they get rid of all the things of jesus christ and christianity but i use them to preserve those things that you might be able to go and see them hallelujah so i thank god for them that god bless them praise god god bless you praise god brother priest another i preach another mini sermon brother now i'm really gonna let you john saw the pride he was before [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am [Music] three destiny [Applause] [Music] john saw them [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] number
