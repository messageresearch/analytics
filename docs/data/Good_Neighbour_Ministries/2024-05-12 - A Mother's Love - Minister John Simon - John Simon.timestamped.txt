[28:25] salvation baptism that's not saved
[28:28] but it's an outward expressing what has
[28:31] already taken place in the inside so
[28:34] it's that there something has touched
[28:35] his heart taking place inside his
[28:38] expressing outside for everyone to Bear
[28:40] witness of that so without wasting much
[28:43] time you read our first scripture here

[28:49] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[28:52] world and preach the gospel to Every
[28:55] Creature he that believed and is
[28:59] baptized shall be saved but he that
[29:02] believeth not shall be damned and in
[29:05] Luke and in Acts chapter
[29:11] 2 verse
[29:17] 37-39 now when they heard this they were
[29:21] prick in their heart and said unto Peter
[29:24] and to the rest of the Apostles men and
[29:27] Brethren what shall we do then Peter
[29:30] said unto them
[29:32] repent and be baptized everyone of you
[29:35] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[29:38] remission of sins and you shall receive
[29:40] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the

[35:19] realize that this is Mother's Day and uh
[35:24] you'd like to get out there and
[35:28] celebrate motherhood and be a blessing
[35:31] to your own mothers right so God bless
[35:34] you we'll look to the word in Exodus
[35:37] chapter
[35:46] 20 open your Bibles you have a Bible if
[35:50] you don't have one just tell the deacons
[35:53] and they'll see about it right
[35:59] okay Exodus 20 and this is a scripture
[36:03] we all should know if we don't know and
[36:06] it reads briefly honor thy father and
[36:12] thy
[36:13] mother that thy days may be long upon
[36:17] the land which the Lord thy God giveth
[36:22] thee amen may the Lord bless this
[36:27] scripture
[36:28] words of God to our hearts and Minds
[36:31] today let us pray our gracious God our
[36:37] heavenly father as we enter into thy
[36:43] presence just by speaking about the word
[36:47] of God like the disciples on the road to
[36:52] OS uh when they began to talk about you
[36:57] your presence Drew near we will ask that
[37:02] that will repeat again that while we are
[37:06] thinking and talking and uh worshiping
[37:10] thee and thinking about thee that you
[37:13] will draw near to us in reality that we
[37:18] might not have to imagine it but we
[37:20] shall realize Lord God that not just
[37:24] brother Simon speaking up here but you
[37:26] are here behind us with us around us
[37:30] surrounding us embracing us and showing
[37:33] your great love to us bless us today as
[37:37] we honor mothers we thank you for this
[37:42] opportunity and bless your holy name in
[37:46] the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless
[37:50] you please be
[37:54] seated I am sure that as Believers as
[37:59] Christians you may know the old song
[38:03] that speaks about the love of God the
[38:07] love of God is greater far than any
[38:10] tongue of P or pen of men can ever tell
[38:14] oh yes God's love is deep God's love is
[38:19] wide indeed and I certainly believe that
[38:22] do
[38:23] you yes well I mentioned that because
[38:28] A Mother's Love is akin to God's
[38:32] love in other words words God portrays
[38:38] himself through a mother's love for her
[38:43] child to reflect his love for his
[38:47] children now he couldn't find like a
[38:51] better uh example to show his steadfast
[38:56] unmoving
[38:58] unswerving love regardless of what
[39:03] circumstances their child find itself in
[39:08] a mother's love is like that now uh our
[39:14] Prophet brother Branham the 20th century
[39:17] prophet and not just our Prophet but he
[39:19] was and the prophet to the 20th century
[39:23] whether you're saved you're unsaved
[39:26] Elijah was still the pastor to the
[39:28] entire all of Israel and there he was
[39:32] and uh brother brandham says plainly his
[39:37] father was a
[39:38] drunkard his father loved to
[39:42] drink and uh I and he but he also worked
[39:47] hard to provide for his family to take
[39:51] care of his own he says I seen my f
[39:55] daddy worked so hard till he would come
[39:58] home his back would be
[40:01] sunburnt until his shirt would be
[40:03] sticking to his back and mother would
[40:06] have to come and clip that shirt loose
[40:10] from his back let me tell you I don't
[40:14] care what he's
[40:16] done he still my
[40:19] daddy he didn't approve of what his
[40:21] father did but he said I don't care what
[40:25] he done he still my dad
[40:28] in simple terms you can't change that
[40:33] fact you can't change the fact of who is
[40:36] your mother or who is your
[40:38] father and so you love them anyhow
[40:44] regardless of what they might have done
[40:49] he says uh today I have if you're
[40:54] fortunate today if you have a daddy and
[40:57] a Mothers still
[41:00] living love
[41:02] them is that right love them honor them
[41:09] for the hour will come when you think
[41:12] you're the they're the greatest people
[41:14] in the world Amen and so one of these
[41:19] days when they go out of the room in a
[41:24] casket filled with flowers
[41:27] you see them Lord in the ground and hear
[41:32] the pastor say ashes ashes dust to dust
[41:37] oh then you won't call him old man then
[41:43] you won't say my old lady then you will
[41:46] want to say oh mother oh mother you'll
[41:51] be ringing your hands and crying that's
[41:55] right while she's living
[41:58] give her
[41:59] flowers is that right in other words

[42:13] will right my goodness you see people
[42:18] die and then they fill up their casket
[42:21] with flowers all around it looks good

[42:26] have given them theow flowers you should
[42:28] have given them the flowers while they
[42:31] are alive while they're living while
[42:33] they can hear you and while you can talk
[42:35] to them and express your love your

[43:06] can ever give them is to obey them while

[43:14] Bible First uh
[43:16] commandment uh promise commandment with
[43:20] a promise in the Bible honor thy father

[43:47] mother would you obey that be kind to
[43:51] your mother right and when he was dying
[43:55] he just beginning to gray a bit in the
[43:58] temples laid there in the casket I
[44:02] picked up his head which he dyed right
[44:05] on my arm and I picked up his head his
[44:09] locks of hair fell down and I thought oh
[44:12] Dad I looked at his hand and he had one
[44:16] of his fingers cut off in a shredder
[44:19] from hard work one day I thought of all
[44:23] the heartaches that I caused him while
[44:26] he was alive see oh my that was my daddy
[44:32] I don't care who else what they thought
[44:34] about him he is still my dad amen praise

[45:17] said to a young girl he says you look
[45:21] like a sweet fine healthy girl but

[45:29] see you have asthma don't you honey you

[45:44] and she has to set up and and you cough
[45:47] isn't that right and I look and I see
[45:51] your mother just working working she's

[46:05] baby you're just a child you're sick
[46:07] might be just a cough might be AIC you
[46:10] have a little fever or something and you
[46:13] begin to cough and and you have a little
[46:17] you know some stomach ache or something
[46:19] your mother doesn't care the tiniest
[46:22] thing that happens to you right away she
[46:25] she turns right right away you would
[46:28] think that she is sleeping in the
[46:30] deepest sleep and if that child over
[46:33] there just begin and oh she comes awake
[46:37] I don't know it's a gift it's given to
[46:41] mothers to be that way they come wide
[46:44] awake and their attention goes right
[46:46] straight to that child and that's a part
[46:50] of a mother's love that God gave them
[46:54] the mothers tend to care to take care of
[46:56] the that child and they'll stay up all
[46:59] night without any sleep watching and
[47:03] staying right by that child oh my
[47:07] goodness yes sir I tell you that's
[47:10] something that shows the love of God it
[47:13] displays God's love that if a mother
[47:16] loves her child in that way that her
[47:19] eyes or ears are all tuned to that child
[47:23] all night I don't care how Darkly you
[47:27] may get or any age may get God's eyes
[47:31] are upon you his eyes are on the sparrow
[47:36] and he cares for you he cares for you
[47:39] and I and that's what I would like you
[47:42] to know here today God's love is greater
[47:46] far than any tongue or pen can ever tell
[47:50] and a mother's love just gives you a
[47:53] little idea to show you that he cares do
[47:56] do you care do you care your mother
[48:00] cared for you do you care oh let our
[48:04] love go forth now and express to them
[48:09] what God has done in their life and has
[48:12] done in our lives and we want to share
[48:15] that with them must Jesus bear the cross
[48:19] alone and all the world go free no sir

[49:45] that prayed for me and that Stood Beside
[49:48] Me every step of the way amen praise
[49:52] God I was very young but at the time

[50:12] school and I started to teach but let me
[50:16] tell you when the call of God is upon
[50:18] you I could not stand it because all was
[50:22] coming to me while you're doing this you
[50:24] could have been speaking my word you
[50:26] could have been teaching the people
[50:29] about me and I couldn't stand it oh I I
[50:32] just lasted for a week or a week and a
[50:34] half and I was out of there I I
[50:37] absolutely and my poor mother that had
[50:41] prayed and prayed for me to get a good
[50:45] job and to advance in life all of a
[50:48] sudden you've got a good job and now you

[50:55] disappointed but you see see I have from
[50:58] that time I kept I've been keeping my
[51:00] eyes on the word of God and I believe
[51:03] not believe now but while she was still
[51:06] alive and she could witness and see the
[51:10] mighty hand of God and the Holy Spirit
[51:13] God blessed me enough to lead both
[51:15] mother and father to Jesus Christ and
[51:19] they can see the hand of God they were
[51:22] uh there to witness the Revival while I
[51:26] was was just 14 years old in the in the
[51:29] city that we were in and the church
[51:32] Still Remains there they were able to
[51:34] witness that I believe that she started
[51:36] to get her spiritual reward and more
[51:40] than that receiving this message of this
[51:43] hour both of them were able to receive
[51:46] the message of this hour and I want to
[51:49] thank God and praise him for
[51:51] that and I tell you she just went with
[51:55] the Lord quite ly she was not ill sick
[52:00] you know she had her sight uh she had
[52:03] her mind and still a woman of prayer and
[52:08] a blessing to the local Christian
[52:10] Assembly in New York what a blessing
[52:14] that she was yes sir so remember you
[52:17] mothers you are the Fifth Gospel said
[52:20] let me listen let let me show you
[52:23] something don't you know when Moses was
[52:27] a boy when he was a boy it was his
[52:31] mother who gave him his first
[52:35] instructions do you know in life that is
[52:39] automatic it's the mother that gives the
[52:41] first instructions like that it was
[52:45] mother who gave him his first
[52:49] instruction it was a Godly mother who
[52:52] took this child upon on her knees and
[52:55] said Moses
[52:57] and there she began to teach him the
[53:00] things of God she taught him all that he
[53:05] knew she was his teacher even though he
[53:11] was in the atmosphere that was around
[53:14] pharaoh and let me tell you Pharaoh is
[53:17] still here I mean the spirit of pharaoh
[53:20] is still here and you say oh in this
[53:23] Godless world of chaos all around what
[53:26] what am I going to do you can take your
[53:29] children you you don't have to wait for
[53:32] Sunday school on Sunday you can have uh
[53:36] Sunday school every day every night
[53:39] whenever you want to and take them and
[53:42] teach them about the
[53:45] Lord amen yes sir and she said Moses and
[53:50] she began to speak now these things
[53:53] Moses I see someday you're going going
[53:56] to deliver the children of Israel you
[53:59] are that boy that's going to do that so
[54:03] she began to teach him saying Moses
[54:06] teach him keep yourself pure keep
[54:10] yourself unspotted from the world you
[54:13] are the one amen no place do we have in
[54:18] the scriptures where he went to a
[54:21] seminary yet we know that any teaching
[54:26] that that he got he stayed was from his
[54:29] mother but he stayed right in Pharaoh's
[54:33] Palace yet being taught by his mother
[54:37] amen now we know he went to normal
[54:41] school because they said he was the
[54:43] wisest among those that were there at
[54:46] the particular time but it was his
[54:49] mother in the midst of Pharaoh's Palace
[54:54] in the midst of heathens you talk about
[54:57] heathens we have heathens
[54:59] today you say oh you got to you have to
[55:02] have a bone in your nose and you got to
[55:04] have feathers and you got to have for
[55:06] all over you and a batlax in your hand
[55:09] and then you're a heathen no you can be
[55:11] an educated Heathen a Godless Heathen
[55:14] that knows not the power of God the
[55:17] presence of God knows not the love of
[55:20] God and the Lord Jesus Christ and what
[55:22] he has done for us absolutely we are
[55:25] surrounded by by heathens around us
[55:27] don't you know that can you say Amen oh
[55:30] my don't be afraid and think that the
[55:32] population or the people will turn
[55:34] against you it's the truth it's the word
[55:37] of God amen hallelujah we're surrounded
[55:40] by heathens everywhere pagans like it
[55:44] was back then it's pagans today better
[55:47] dressed but still paganism because it's
[55:50] away from The Lord of word of God Amen
[55:54] she told him she Tau him the precepts of
[55:58] the Lord she told him how he must be
[56:01] holy told him how he what kind of a life
[56:05] he should live how and what God would do
[56:09] for him and you know what it stuck with
[56:12] Moses all the days of his life you know
[56:16] when children are young sometimes we
[56:18] think oh they don't know what we're
[56:20] talking about but something sticks in
[56:24] there you think they don't understand
[56:28] and some but something sticks in there
[56:30] that's why the Bible says teach them and
[56:33] even if they Wonder away doesn't matter
[56:35] it might take years but he you know he
[56:38] says that branch is going to bend and
[56:40] come right back it's going to come back
[56:43] to where it was because that's its
[56:45] origin that's its origin it comes from
[56:48] that
[56:49] origin Paul prays Timothy I see you come
[56:53] from your Godly grandmother Lewis a a
[56:56] and and now here you are today and and
[56:59] he's ordaining him as a preacher amen
[57:02] and to take over the local church that
[57:05] Paul was preaching in he says because I
[57:08] see God rais you up to be a bishop
[57:10] Hallelujah Bishop just really means
[57:12] Pastor preacher right but he raised him
[57:15] up to be that oh because of The Godly
[57:19] influence that come from his mother and
[57:22] from his Mo grandmother I believe that
[57:25] with all my
[57:26] heart God doesn't ask necessarily for
[57:30] that pre for that woman to be a preacher
[57:33] going around in the streets preaching or
[57:36] going anywhere preaching he just wants
[57:38] her to be Godly and holy and moral and
[57:42] pure and live according to his word and
[57:46] God promised that he'll bless you for
[57:49] fulfilling your purpose in life amen God
[57:52] promised that he would bless you for
[57:54] fulfilling your purpose in life
[57:56] glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir and
[58:01] it stuck with Moses all the days of his
[58:04] life any good true loyal mother will
[58:07] take her little babies and instead of
[58:11] sending them to picture
[58:14] shows instead of taking them out to
[58:17] little
[58:18] dances and so forth she'll put them on
[58:22] her knees and teach them about the Lord
[58:25] Jesus Christ Christ amen oh my yes sir
[58:30] the I he's speaking now he said I was
[58:33] speaking with uh a a lady the other day
[58:36] that called on the phone and she said oh
[58:39] brother brandham I want you to pray with
[58:42] me and pray for my son you see he's so
[58:46] wrong one says this about him the other
[58:49] says that about him uh you know they
[58:52] talk about him I don't even know whether
[58:54] he's right or wrong but whether he's
[58:57] right whether he's wrong I love him I am
[59:02] his mother and I love him there you are
[59:05] said God's servant listen listen to this
[59:09] oh see he said this is his mother and
[59:13] she says I love him and he said to her
[59:17] one day mom I've been so deceived I've
[59:22] been deceived I believe you're the only
[59:25] sweetheart in my life that really loves
[59:27] me and sometimes it comes right down to
[59:30] that the whole world turns against them
[59:33] is that right and that's how they feel
[59:35] that the whole world turns against them
[59:38] but no matter if the World Turns against
[59:41] them that's still their mother and the
[59:44] mother still loves them amen I don't
[59:48] care how they curse and swear and carry
[59:50] on and whatever else still God put it in
[59:54] the human heart that they Revere and
[59:57] love still that person that is their
[1:00:01] mother amen praise God now if you agree
[1:00:04] with me say an amen praise God
[1:00:07] hallelujah you can say oh me or oh my if
[1:00:10] you don't agree right
[1:00:13] but amen you see that's where it is
[1:00:17] that's a mother's love the real mother
[1:00:21] that will put her arms around her baby
[1:00:25] right right her baby and you know uh
[1:00:28] somewhere else he said you say I say
[1:00:30] baby he says but he talks about when he
[1:00:33] went to another place and there was a
[1:00:36] 180b man and the mother was still
[1:00:39] calling him her

[1:08:25] Hallelujah now I want to tell you a
[1:08:27] story here that is very uh figurative
[1:08:31] and indicative of a real Mother's Love
[1:08:35] and brother Bram is telling one time he
[1:08:37] was in
[1:08:39] Tennessee passing through and he had to
[1:08:43] take a plane after his meetings were
[1:08:46] over to go
[1:08:48] home and while he was in the hotel room
[1:08:54] he wanted to go out on the street to
[1:08:56] post a letter at the post office so he
[1:08:59] left and uh went out but he said when I
[1:09:04] got to the
[1:09:06] crossing I suddenly heard his voice
[1:09:10] saying
[1:09:12] stop so he said I stop the voice says
[1:09:16] turn back turn back so he turned back
[1:09:20] just keep walking and he turned back and
[1:09:23] he started walking he said but I didn't
[1:09:26] know where I was going and what I was
[1:09:28] doing because the voice told me to go
[1:09:31] back and uh you see I started out this
[1:09:36] is The Sovereign Grace of God I was
[1:09:39] going down the street like any Christian
[1:09:42] would and I was just singing in my heart
[1:09:46] I'm one of them I'm one of
[1:09:49] them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[1:09:53] of them Hallelujah one of them he said I
[1:09:57] was just singing in my heart and walking
[1:10:00] along as I was going along like that one
[1:10:03] of them little Pentecostal songs them
[1:10:06] people sing glad I can say I'm one of
[1:10:10] them people from everywhere filled with
[1:10:13] the Holy Ghost in that upper room and I
[1:10:16] was just rejoicing in my spirit in the
[1:10:19] Lord see and then as I started to cross
[1:10:26] again something said to me stop I
[1:10:30] thought what I said Lord what would you
[1:10:33] have me do and he says look just as
[1:10:37] plain not in my mind you know what I'm
[1:10:40] talking about I heard it and there it
[1:10:44] was that light was right before me
[1:10:47] whirling around
[1:10:49] see we we the Lord's is a light onto our
[1:10:53] feet and a lamp onto our path
[1:10:55] amen he is our guide he is our
[1:10:58] leadership he is our all in all he leads
[1:11:02] us and guides Us in reality oh when when
[1:11:06] are believers going to come into the
[1:11:08] perfect realization of the reality of
[1:11:11] the presence and the power of almighty
[1:11:13] God hallelujah oh praise God I'm holding
[1:11:17] myself not to go really preaching but to
[1:11:21] bring this word of you in this way amen
[1:11:24] because he is our guide and he literally
[1:11:27] guides us it it's not a joke it's not an
[1:11:31] imagination uh you know he may not
[1:11:34] always show you a light like he did to
[1:11:36] brother brandham but he has so many ways
[1:11:38] that he can tell you that he's leading
[1:11:40] and guiding you amen every day we leave
[1:11:43] our homes we don't know if we're going
[1:11:45] to go back safely every day we come out
[1:11:49] on the street but God's hand is guiding
[1:11:53] you you say oh my my god look this guy
[1:11:56] is in front of me he's stopping my car
[1:11:58] and you're getting mad with the guy and
[1:12:01] and then the next thing you know there
[1:12:04] is a roadblock the cops stop you lights
[1:12:06] flashing and you got to get to work oh
[1:12:09] the lights are flashing turn back go
[1:12:11] down that street you go down that street

[1:12:15] accident took place and if that guy was
[1:12:18] not uh whatever made him do that be
[1:12:21] deliberately driving slow in front of
[1:12:23] you you would have been right there just
[1:12:26] like the taxi driver where that said the
[1:12:29] um where the ship hit the bridge I think
[1:12:31] it's in Boston or something like
[1:12:34] Baltimore and yes she said I thank God

[1:12:40] thank God for saving my life I went to
[1:12:43] pick up this client and the client I got
[1:12:47] there on time five minutes before time
[1:12:50] and I'm sitting there waiting and the
[1:12:52] client still not out the house and then
[1:12:55] when the client comes out the house it's
[1:12:57] past the time and because of that when I
[1:13:01] took off I was just approaching the
[1:13:04] bridge when the Collision of the ship
[1:13:08] hit the bridge and I was able to back up
[1:13:11] and get away from it all so she was
[1:13:14] thanking God for saving her in that hour
[1:13:17] let me tell you all things work together
[1:13:19] for good to them that love the Lord they
[1:13:22] are called according to his purpose

[1:13:50] right the devil says oh man give up

[1:13:56] stop you know I just can't continue this
[1:14:00] way but let me tell you friends just

[1:32:29] that preacher I know that that's all
[1:32:31] fashion but it will do for you when
[1:32:34] you're dying oh my Lord look at the
[1:32:38] mental conditions in the world today how
[1:32:40] many knows that the prophet's words are
[1:32:42] coming to
[1:32:43] pass it shall come to pass long after
[1:32:47] I'm gone that the entire world be will
[1:32:49] begin to go insane is that right all
[1:32:53] right right going insane see look at it
[1:32:57] for it's a nervous age that them people
[1:33:01] are living in see oh it's driving them
[1:33:06] out of their
[1:33:07] mind and exactly fulfill what the
[1:33:10] scriptures said and promised hideous
[1:33:13] things will come upon the Earth things
[1:33:16] they coming on the earth Lord look at
[1:33:19] them in that mental condition deluded
[1:33:24] conditions and screaming for rocks and
[1:33:27] screaming for the mountains women who
[1:33:30] would rather give their mother's love to
[1:33:33] a
[1:33:34] dog you see that's what draws them to
[1:33:37] have a dog right like that and not to
[1:33:41] raise children to honor you see those
[1:33:45] that you did give children to and they
[1:33:48] did conceive them instead of loving them
[1:33:51] and raising them right they they loose
[1:33:54] them in the streets to do as they want
[1:33:58] and to live as they want no wonder you
[1:34:01] said Lord when you were going to the
[1:34:03] Cross then they'll cry to the rocks in
[1:34:06] the mountains to fall on them at that
[1:34:09] particular time oh my goodness think
[1:34:12] about it God is God I believe him don't
[1:34:16] you now this uh here is talking
[1:34:21] about this
[1:34:24] wonderful wonderful King George was
[1:34:27] driving along the street and you know
[1:34:29] back in the in the old um country that
[1:34:32] I'm from and lot of other countries that
[1:34:36] we know the king would come to visit
[1:34:38] that country from time of time the
[1:34:40] Commonwealth at that time and he just go
[1:34:42] around to visit and they'd have him in
[1:34:45] his beautiful car and out Riders and
[1:34:48] horse riders with it and and then he
[1:34:50] would be waving to the children that
[1:34:53] school would be out they would let you
[1:34:55] come from school and holding a British
[1:34:57] flag and waving the flag and shouting
[1:35:00] God Save the King and that sort of thing
[1:35:04] and they were waving it like that and
[1:35:06] there was this little girl after it was
[1:35:09] all over she was not in a number of kids
[1:35:12] and the teacher turned back went back
[1:35:15] and there she was leaning against the
[1:35:17] wall and she was crying she was crying
[1:35:20] like that and she says why are you
[1:35:22] crying she says didn't the king pass by
[1:35:25] he said yes did you see him yes did he
[1:35:27] wave towards you yes I did wave he says
[1:35:31] yes H I did I did he waved towards my
[1:35:35] Direction but what she expresses that
[1:35:38] the king is just a general wave he
[1:35:39] didn't see every individual what he was
[1:35:42] waving to and so the king could not see
[1:35:45] me because I was so little right I was
[1:35:49] so little so small brother Brandman
[1:35:52] speaking now and this is what I I want
[1:35:53] you to get but now I want you to know
[1:35:57] it's different with
[1:35:59] Jesus no matter how little how small a
[1:36:03] thing you do in his name he knows all
[1:36:06] about it it might seem insignificant to
[1:36:10] you but yet if it is done in his name no
[1:36:15] matter how little it is amen he knows
[1:36:20] all about it he once said if you give
[1:36:23] one one of these my little ones my
[1:36:25] servants just even a cup of cold water
[1:36:29] right only in the name of a disciple
[1:36:33] verily I say unto you you shall not lose
[1:36:37] your reward amen praise God hallelujah
[1:36:42] and so I'm glad of that aren't you he
[1:36:45] sees our the little things we do this
[1:36:48] little portion of scripture if you can
[1:36:51] understand and properly receive it he
[1:36:54] will understand and he will bless you
[1:36:57] amen praise God honor your father and
[1:37:01] your mother right the important role
[1:37:05] that they play in your life especially
[1:37:07] your mother the role that she plays in
[1:37:11] your life if you're a real mother stay
[1:37:13] at home take care of your children she
[1:37:16] will keep your clothes clean and she'll
[1:37:19] send you to school and today she'll meet
[1:37:22] you when the bus brings you back from
[1:37:24] school all right and there she'll be
[1:37:27] help you to cross the street oh my and
[1:37:30] she'll teach you about Jesus you will
[1:37:34] honor the you should honor that sweet
[1:37:36] old mother that with all that is in you
[1:37:39] respect that woman because she is a real
[1:37:45] mother and real mothers are becoming an
[1:37:48] endangered
[1:37:51] species is that right
[1:37:54] real mothers are becoming an endangered
[1:37:58] species they talk about oh save the
[1:38:01] whale
[1:38:02] and saved of this saved of that they
[1:38:06] don't look and see that mothers are out
[1:38:08] there that are Godly faithful helping to
[1:38:11] save the let's save the Civil the
[1:38:14] civilization save the children save the
[1:38:17] soul of the children and being a
[1:38:19] testimony to the world Amen praise God
[1:38:23] many of those prophets only prophesied
[1:38:25] one time and you never hear or read
[1:38:28] about them in the Bible again and
[1:38:31] sometimes people think that when there
[1:38:33] the simple things of God sometimes in
[1:38:35] this whole life which you think 60 70 50
[1:38:39] 80 is a lot of time that's not a lot of
[1:38:42] time and in that span of time God maybe
[1:38:45] only want you to do five acts of
[1:38:47] kindness for people out there and you
[1:38:50] don't even have to know them say oh only
[1:38:53] I'm going going Jesus said what is it if
[1:38:55] you do love those that already love you
[1:38:59] those that already believe like you
[1:39:02] those that already this what is that
[1:39:04] that's good but that's not it but it's
[1:39:06] to reach out to them that that even
[1:39:08] deceive you that lie against you
[1:39:11] persecute you say manner of love them
[1:39:15] show the love of God to them and let
[1:39:18] that love go out and bless the world
[1:39:20] because that's the love of God that will
[1:39:23] project out there and bless the world
[1:39:26] I'm going to close with this thought
[1:39:28] here this is another person brother
[1:39:30] Brandon was called to an emergency
[1:39:33] room and he rushed into the emergency
[1:39:36] room and there was a beautiful young
[1:39:40] woman with dark hair could have been a
[1:39:44] queen in any man's Palace or home and
[1:39:48] she and and said to me how do you
[1:39:51] do and I looked around
[1:39:55] the rest of them behind her in this room
[1:39:59] were in straight
[1:40:01] jackets have you ever been in a room
[1:40:03] like
[1:40:04] that and screaming some Screaming in
[1:40:09] there others
[1:40:11] cursing a woman another
[1:40:15] one dipping her hand into the bed pan
[1:40:18] that was there and wiping it all over
[1:40:20] her
[1:40:22] face excuse me for saying that brother
[1:40:24] bradam says after eating your breakfast
[1:40:26] coming here me saying
[1:40:30] that he said but I was in the midst of
[1:40:34] insanity it was Insanity all around
[1:40:38] that's you see I I I just don't know
[1:40:42] where to start Lord and I said it out
[1:40:44] loud I said I just don't know where to
[1:40:46] start with
[1:40:48] this and the young woman that was
[1:40:50] sitting there said I wish you would
[1:40:52] start with me
[1:40:54] I said you're not a patient she said yes

[1:41:05] people everyone as a matter of fact I
[1:41:09] was raised to honor
[1:41:11] God and one time I went out with a boy
[1:41:14] my mother and father warned me not to go
[1:41:18] with such a boy but I said he was
[1:41:21] cute and and he had you know that pretty
[1:41:25] little curl that pretty
[1:41:28] hair oh my and of course that's that's
[1:41:33] right he said that's all right too I
[1:41:35] don't blame any woman looking uh your
[1:41:38] best whatever be clean look your best
[1:41:42] that's all right lady that's all right I
[1:41:45] just hate to see somebody though trying
[1:41:48] to look their best by disfiguring
[1:41:50] themselves
[1:41:55] them women don't even look like human
[1:41:57] when they're finished you know putting
[1:42:00] on you know I'm just in my parlament
[1:42:02] putting on such uh what you call this
[1:42:08] uh I eyelashes as long as an umbrella
[1:42:12] over your
[1:42:15] face oh Lord he says they don't even
[1:42:18] look human see but you try to look clean
[1:42:23] and to be a lady right and you men don't
[1:42:28] be sloppy about
[1:42:30] yourself oh my place come quiet dead I
[1:42:34] can drop a
[1:42:38] pin I can drop a pin like oh my Lord he
[1:42:43] says men don't you be sloppy with
[1:42:46] yourself how many of you seen brother
[1:42:48] Brandon pictures of brother Brandon when
[1:42:50] he's not hunting or when he's going to
[1:42:53] preacher when he's out normally he
[1:42:56] always was dressed
[1:42:58] sharp you how many knows that you seen
[1:43:00] pictures of him so always dress clean
[1:43:03] sharp right Oh my he says don't don't
[1:43:07] dress Slappy like that and then think
[1:43:09] that that's being
[1:43:12] humble I used to think that and do you
[1:43:15] believe that I I I used to think riding
[1:43:18] a bicycle and just having a crushed up
[1:43:21] suit or whatever and not too clean
[1:43:24] because you're going to start looking
[1:43:26] too fancy and people not going to
[1:43:28] believe you and and I was Dr preaching
[1:43:31] like that and going around like that and
[1:43:33] when the first the church started and we
[1:43:35] were down there in the little white
[1:43:37] building that spirit of God spoke and
[1:43:39] said
[1:43:41] no the
[1:43:43] people are seeing you they're seeing the
[1:43:47] outside of the church and just like I
[1:43:49] want you now to paint this church white
[1:43:53] was gray and very terrible looking do it
[1:43:56] up so not only do up the church you
[1:44:00] start dressing better carry yourself
[1:44:03] with dignity so that the people can
[1:44:06] respect that he said first the reason
[1:44:08] why that's the first thing they
[1:44:11] see right and if their carnal senses can
[1:44:16] only see and he let them see the best
[1:44:19] you can be and then you can lead them
[1:44:22] for
[1:44:24] right into the things of God but don't
[1:44:26] go around sloppy looking no and think
[1:44:29] that that's being humble that's not
[1:44:30] humble he says that's being
[1:44:33] dirty that's not me now I say that
[1:44:36] brother brah said
[1:44:39] that he says be clean now and try to do
[1:44:45] that you know it's just you know it it's
[1:44:49] just don't try to do things uh like
[1:44:53] other people just be a ordinary brother
[1:44:56] just be yourself I hate to see anybody
[1:44:59] try to put on something now this young
[1:45:02] lady I said what happened and she began
[1:45:04] to tell me her story
[1:45:07] right well this boy he first of all he
[1:45:12] smoked he tried to get me to
[1:45:16] smoke and I wouldn't do it one night he
[1:45:21] just gave me a piece of candle while we
[1:45:23] were sitting there
[1:45:26] talking that candy had been documented
[1:45:30] brother brandham said what he meant it
[1:45:32] was laced with
[1:45:34] drugs right he says you doctors know how
[1:45:38] to say that you know what that means I
[1:45:41] just said it that way right but that
[1:45:45] candy just a piece of candy not a
[1:45:48] cigarette not a drink because now he
[1:45:51] knows that devil on him knows that she
[1:45:53] ain't going to take that so he bring a
[1:45:56] simple simple thing just a piece of
[1:45:58] candy and the candy was laced with drugs
[1:46:02] she said and
[1:46:03] so he got me on the wrong road I ate the
[1:46:07] candy thinking it was all right I woke
[1:46:10] up the next morning and my morals as a
[1:46:13] young woman was
[1:46:16] ruined then I thought what's the
[1:46:18] difference now so I started drinking and
[1:46:22] going around
[1:46:23] and then I joined this church I did
[1:46:25] everything I went to the good Shepherd's
[1:46:27] home I went to the Catholic church I
[1:46:30] joined the Catholic Church thought that
[1:46:33] would help me didn't do a thing I I
[1:46:36] became a street
[1:46:38] walker I became a
[1:46:41] prostitute I I began to drink alcohol
[1:46:45] then when I quit that they pick me up
[1:46:48] again and I served two years in a
[1:46:51] women's Penitentiary
[1:46:54] when I come out of there I joined
[1:46:56] another church thinking it would help me
[1:46:59] didn't do me one bit of good and then I
[1:47:03] heard about your meetings oh my yes sir
[1:47:07] and I thought I'd come down and see if
[1:47:09] you could help me I looked at her a
[1:47:13] beautiful woman I thought what she could
[1:47:16] be the queen of some child evangelist
[1:47:19] when he comes home she could say darling
[1:47:22] I know your child tired put her arms
[1:47:24] around him encourage him you don't know
[1:47:26] what that does to a man we do when times
[1:47:30] are going there's no one can take the
[1:47:33] touch of a real sweet mother think of it
[1:47:38] God could give a man some couldn't give
[1:47:41] a man something better you see because
[1:47:44] here he had done it by giving him a wife
[1:47:49] what a sweet little thing she would be I
[1:47:51] was thinking like that amen oh my I I
[1:47:55] turned to her I said I want to ask you
[1:47:57] something didn't you ever in your life
[1:47:59] ever feel like you'd like to have a h a
[1:48:02] husband and have little babies around
[1:48:05] you see and be a mother she said sure
[1:48:09] brother brandham but what would that
[1:48:11] would be the desire of my
[1:48:13] heart but who would have me
[1:48:17] now who would have me now I I couldn't
[1:48:22] even say speak I feel embarrassed to
[1:48:25] even speak before a minister I I I I
[1:48:28] wouldn't be able to express the low down
[1:48:30] dirty things that I have
[1:48:34] done and yet there she was a young woman
[1:48:39] of only
[1:48:42] 20 I said well we can B our heads now
[1:48:47] and pray there one thing we can do you
[1:48:50] can pray she said said yes sir I got
[1:48:54] down I want to pray you ask God to
[1:48:57] forgive you of these things I want you
[1:48:58] to pray and she began to pray I've done
[1:49:01] so many things it won't work he says you
[1:49:04] try praying
[1:49:06] again she got down and she prayed she
[1:49:08] got back up he says now brother brandham
[1:49:11] with that prayer I think I'm going to
[1:49:13] turn a new page here tonight he says no
[1:49:17] you'll turn it back that page back
[1:49:20] tomorrow I said that W work turning a
[1:49:23] new
[1:49:24] page I want to ask you something you
[1:49:27] don't want to do these things do you
[1:49:30] honey she said no I don't and I said
[1:49:34] this may seem oldfashioned as it would
[1:49:36] be you join every Church all you done
[1:49:40] all that he said I want you to know why
[1:49:43] that has been and why you've come this
[1:49:46] far this way you were under bondage of a
[1:49:51] devil
[1:49:53] causing that in your life causing that
[1:49:56] to happen those big bright eyes looked
[1:49:59] up to me and she said Mr brandham I've
[1:50:03] always believed that something was
[1:50:05] driving me to do them things I didn't
[1:50:07] want to do he said that's it it's demon
[1:50:11] power demon power oh my I said now let's
[1:50:16] pray again she got down and prayed and
[1:50:19] prayed I laid hands on her and she
[1:50:23] she stayed right there and we prayed a
[1:50:27] little while longer and all that once
[1:50:31] the fire struck amen yes sir and when it
[1:50:35] struck she raised up and them eyes had
[1:50:38] changed how they looked she said brother
[1:50:41] Bram something happened something
[1:50:43] happened he said I know it's over now
[1:50:48] Hallelujah you don't have to join
[1:50:51] nothing now
[1:50:53] you don't have to do nothing only
[1:50:56] believe she's married now she's got
[1:50:59] children no more drinking and that quote
[1:51:03] comes out of this message called from
[1:51:06] that time from that time she walked
[1:51:09] another road and another life well what
[1:51:12] I've talked about today is a mother's
[1:51:15] love the love of her of a mother for her
[1:51:18] own and in closing I want you to know
[1:51:21] that he showed that there was a good
[1:51:24] mother and how she raised the child how
[1:51:26] she taught the child how she brought
[1:51:29] down the scriptures the word of God to
[1:51:31] the child maybe tell them Stories the
[1:51:33] scriptures in story form how many knows
[1:51:36] that that's the best way to start
[1:51:38] teaching children in story form and uh
[1:51:41] related that way and brought Moses up to
[1:51:45] the point where he became a great leader
[1:51:48] and deliverer and an immortal engraved
[1:51:51] within the scriptures and then the other
[1:51:54] mother herodias who raised her daughter
[1:51:57] to be a dancing queen and a model and
[1:52:00] all that sort of thing and to be the
[1:52:02] best so that she could make money off of
[1:52:05] her uh live off of her and there are
[1:52:08] many stars you know that like that out
[1:52:10] there and uh and and what came that
[1:52:13] child became What whose Generations had
[1:52:17] prostitutes and murderers in them
[1:52:19] because that's the seed they come from
[1:52:21] and that's how it went out and then
[1:52:24] brother brandham tells us about this
[1:52:26] colored woman and then about this woman
[1:52:29] um whom in one meeting even wasn't
[1:52:32] ashamed no more she even got up in one
[1:52:34] of his big meetings and
[1:52:36] testified amen it's in the books you
[1:52:39] know her name is there rosett Ro sister
[1:52:41] Rosetta and testified about it because
[1:52:44] she saved God wiped her clean you can
[1:52:46] talk all you want it's gone it's behind
[1:52:48] me I don't care that that's that's just
[1:52:50] a past life amen don't let the devil BG
[1:52:54] you down with your past amen we're
[1:52:56] living in the present we're living in
[1:52:58] the great I am right now we're walking
[1:53:01] with him praise the Lord glory to God
[1:53:03] father I thank God for the love of a
[1:53:06] mother because and I close with this
[1:53:09] with this thought and it's just me
[1:53:10] talking about uh my mother a Praying
[1:53:13] Mother and I remember that in the midst
[1:53:17] of brother Bram talking of this woman
[1:53:18] praying for her son and the here
[1:53:21] standing on the back of your
[1:53:24] head I I can remember as a child waking
[1:53:28] up in the night why my mother was
[1:53:31] praying in the middle of the night and
[1:53:34] the whole house was taken up with the
[1:53:36] presence of God not so much the noise of
[1:53:40] our prayer but the presence that was
[1:53:43] coming forth from our prayer you
[1:53:44] couldn't sleep just called to sleep you
[1:53:47] just had to listen and hear uh like that
[1:53:51] and that's why like the good songwriter
[1:53:54] he said oh if I could hear my mother
[1:53:57] pray again if I could only hear her
[1:54:00] gentle voice praying again weeping for
[1:54:03] her sons weeping for her daughters may
[1:54:06] God help every one of us to honor
[1:54:09] respect and love our mothers and be a
[1:54:14] blessing to them especially now in these
[1:54:18] their last days and even before they
[1:54:20] come to their last days let this love

[2:00:28] the part of the tree of good an
[2:00:31] evil and this and today it's un evil
[2:00:34] side because uh I was up to late last

[2:03:24] on behalf of good neighbor ministri
[2:03:26] Sunday school we are grateful for this
[2:03:29] opportunity to say a very happy Mother's
[2:03:32] Day to to all
[2:03:34] mothers today we would like to share a
[2:03:37] few scriptures and quotes from God's
[2:03:40] 20th century Prophet brother William
[2:03:44] brandham our first quote reads I thank
[2:03:48] mother the good true mother is the Fifth
[2:03:51] Gospel
[2:03:52] Matthew Mark Luke John
[2:03:56] mother mother gets them first that's the
[2:03:59] one who brings them up first is
[2:04:03] mother our theme today is Mother The
[2:04:06] Fifth Gospel we choose to honor our
[2:04:10] mothers and thank the Lord Jesus for
[2:04:11] using them for using each of them to
[2:04:15] teach us about him his word and being an
[2:04:18] example of God in flesh she is TR truly
[2:04:22] The Fifth
[2:04:26] Gospel bless all these these dear
[2:04:30] mothers sitting here Lord master of Life
[2:04:34] bless them Lord and may they be blessed
[2:04:37] blessed too and may their children's
[2:04:40] memory be as theirs is with their mother
[2:04:44] if she's gone beyond the veil to a
[2:04:47] glorious Haven Grant it
[2:04:50] Lord now
[2:04:52] there's nothing any sweeter on Earth
[2:04:55] that we know of than a real genuine
[2:04:58] mother God bless her Gallant Soul a real
[2:05:02] real
[2:05:06] mother God grant this morning that
[2:05:09] mothers women who are wandered away from
[2:05:13] God that they will come to themselves
[2:05:17] this morning and will recognize what the
[2:05:20] word mother means
[2:05:22] one who ha begotten may she realize that
[2:05:27] The
[2:05:28] Offspring from her Union with her
[2:05:31] husband has been sacred Little Gems that
[2:05:35] God hath placed under her
[2:05:38] care then God will hold her responsible
[2:05:42] for the rearing of those children and as
[2:05:46] the scripture says that the good woman
[2:05:50] and the mother
[2:05:52] what she is that her children will call
[2:05:56] her
[2:06:00] blessed mothers I respect and honor you
[2:06:04] and if you want to do anything for your
[2:06:06] mother do it
[2:06:09] 365 days a year go to our house and
[2:06:13] offer her a prayer and live forget
[2:06:23] that's the thing to
[2:06:25] do and bring up bring up your children
[2:06:28] and when your children comes up they
[2:06:31] call you blessed after you have passed
[2:06:34] beyond the
[2:06:35] Val that's the spir spirit of
[2:06:40] motherhood the real Spirit of Mother's
[2:06:43] Day Mother's Day is
[2:06:47] 365 day days a year
[2:06:54] mother would appreciate a whole lot more
[2:06:57] it's just to sit down and talk to her a
[2:07:00] little bit write her a line Pat her on
[2:07:03] the shoulder kiss her on the cheek tell
[2:07:06] her you love her it'll go a lot farther
[2:07:09] than the flowers you could buy from the
[2:07:11] floor that's true mother is first with
[2:07:14] the child and she is a great
[2:07:16] responsibility of what the child will be
[2:07:19] it will be based upon the way that
[2:07:22] mother starts that child on the path
[2:07:25] that it must travel mother has the
[2:07:28] responsibility from God to place that
[2:07:30] child on the right Road and that's why I
[2:07:33] think mothers have a special little
[2:07:37] touch you see when a child listens to
[2:07:40] its mother some touch a little bit about
[2:07:43] that mother that a child will listen to
[2:07:47] it when it's hurt it will go to the
[2:07:50] mother for consolation before we go to
[2:07:54] the father because she was first with it
[2:07:58] you know and there's some gift that God
[2:08:01] gives a mother to be that way I mean a
[2:08:05] real mother now I believe that mothers
[2:08:09] are honorable and
[2:08:13] golly I think that a mother a mother
[2:08:16] should be respected every day the same
[2:08:19] that's right a real mother a real mother
[2:08:22] is a woman that raised you and you love
[2:08:25] her and you see her and talk to her all
[2:08:28] the time mother is so great you know the
[2:08:32] first one that receives you in this life
[2:08:34] is your mother no one can touch you
[2:08:37] because you're conceived and she Bears
[2:08:39] you under her heart and she is the first
[2:08:42] to know you and in this life the first
[2:08:44] to hold you then when you're born she is
[2:08:47] one of the first hands that touch you
[2:08:50] and wipes backs back the tears out of
[2:08:53] your eyes she is the first one to Pat
[2:08:56] you and to love you and to coup over you
[2:08:59] in this life is your mother now I think
[2:09:02] that there is not enough honor that we
[2:09:04] could give to a
[2:09:06] mother proverbs 31 verse 10 to
[2:09:12] 31 who can find a virtuous wife for her
[2:09:16] worth is far above
[2:09:19] rubies the heart of her husband safely
[2:09:22] trust her so he will have no lack of
[2:09:25] gain she does him good and not evil all
[2:09:28] the days of her life she seeks wool and
[2:09:31] flax and willingly works with her hands
[2:09:35] she is like the the merchant ships she
[2:09:39] brings her food from
[2:09:41] afar she Also Rises when it is yet night
[2:09:45] and provides for her household and is a
