[40:01] Empire uh and to assist uh brother
[40:05] Branham the seventh angel to minister
[40:09] under Divine gift by the power of the
[40:13] Holy Spirit we ask now that the same
[40:17] great angel of God will be present

[40:30] being revealed and made known that your
[40:34] people might walk out of here healed and
[40:38] whole in mind heart body that we may be
[40:43] glorified and lifted up but we ask this
[40:47] all in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord
[40:51] amen and amen God bless you please be
[40:55] seated uh my subject today is inheriting
[41:00] the prophet's
[41:04] mantle
[41:05] amen now we all know about the
[41:11] Life Ministry and message of our
[41:16] precious brother and Prophet brother
[41:18] William Marian
[41:20] Branham of course we believe him to be
[41:23] the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 five amen
[41:28] is that right we believe him to be the
[41:31] Fulfillment of Revelation
[41:35] 107 The Angel to the seventh Church Age
[41:40] We believe that amen not just saying I
[41:45] believe but we seen something we
[41:49] recognize something and it brought us
[41:52] into a a state of faith that we could
[41:57] not have
[41:59] ourselves so I'm here this
[42:02] morning
[42:04] speaking on inheriting this prophet's
[42:09] mantle and just to be careful I'm not
[42:13] here to speak or
[42:17] to um what should I say give hits as if
[42:22] I am inheriting the prophets
[42:28] mantle that would be
[42:30] foolish that would be
[42:33] presumptuous that would be false
[42:36] Doctrine I want to say that emphatically
[42:39] so that you know I'm not bringing this
[42:41] message with even that thought or
[42:44] insinuation back of
[42:47] me I'm not even here
[42:50] speaking um that there is any man now
[42:55] alive
[42:57] that just goes out and inherits the
[43:02] prophet's
[43:04] mantle because that again would be false
[43:10] Doctrine absolutely in
[43:13] conclusively we know that the genuine
[43:17] original Spirit are you listening amen
[43:21] that was on and in Elijah
[43:27] that spirit of God was in brother
[43:31] William Marian
[43:34] Branham that same original spirit and it
[43:38] manifested itself in the person of
[43:42] William
[43:44] Branham now I want you to see here that
[43:48] and we know this brother William Marian
[43:51] Branham has left this world he's gone
[43:54] yes he's not here
[43:57] many are living on dreams others are
[44:00] living on you know figments of their
[44:04] imagination of of when he was here but
[44:07] he is not here he is dead he is gone
[44:13] amen but while he was here on this Earth
[44:18] if there ever was a man and there is and
[44:23] was such a man his name being William
[44:26] Maran Branham and he moved and lived and
[44:34] operated under the power the spirit and
[44:37] the anointing of the spirit of Elijah
[44:42] anointed by God and by the Holy Ghost to
[44:46] fulfill Malachi 45 and 6 behold I will
[44:52] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[44:58] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[45:01] the Lord and he shall turn the heart of
[45:06] the fathers to the children amen and the
[45:10] Heart of the children to the fathers
[45:14] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[45:19] curse amen I want to say this 20th
[45:22] century has been blessed with this great
[45:26] Supernatural occurrence right of The
[45:29] Descent of the seventh angel with the
[45:33] message yes and spirit of Elijah that
[45:38] went on
[45:40] before but I want to say he's
[45:43] gone but when he went up in the Bible
[45:48] and I believe in our time his mantle did
[45:52] not go up with
[45:54] him the mantle did not go up into the
[45:58] heavens with him but instead it fell
[46:01] back to Earth and it fell upon
[46:06] Elisha the mantle came back on
[46:10] Elisha
[46:11] amen I want what I'm presenting to you
[46:15] is that the
[46:16] message and the mission and the life of
[46:20] brother Branham that he lived did not
[46:24] stay with the Prophet amen but when he
[46:29] was
[46:30] dead he did not go up and still remain
[46:36] pastor and Prophet on the earth that's
[46:40] right because he is dead amen he is gone
[46:44] that Ministry is over the seventh Church
[46:48] age is still in process but that purpose
[46:53] and fulfillment is already fulfilled
[46:55] fill Malachi 4:5 is fulfilled it's still
[47:00] in the process of the finishing parts of
[47:03] it and I tell you Revelation 10:7 is now
[47:07] is in progress Hallelujah and I thank
[47:10] God that I'm a part of it we not denying
[47:14] I'm not denying I'm not putting aside
[47:16] any of those things but I'm saying he is
[47:20] dead he's
[47:22] gone
[47:24] listen how how can he uh remain Prophet
[47:30] amen how can he remain Pastor after he's
[47:36] dead amen the only person who came back
[47:40] or showed themselves to be that was
[47:43] Samuel and he did it to a witch uh he
[47:47] didn't have to come back to know beli to
[47:50] to prove that they already knew he was
[47:53] the prophet amen and brother brandham is

[48:39] them just another one but he happened to
[48:41] be named Joshua amen and the spirit of
[48:45] God spoke to Joshua
[48:50] saying Moses my servant is
[48:54] dead

[48:59] are still going to be intrigued by Moses

[50:27] discernment like you've never
[50:30] seen
[50:31] nobody other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:35] himself has ever had such a display of
[50:39] the power and the presence of almighty
[50:41] God working through their life but he
[50:44] was ordained for that purpose
[50:47] predestinated by the hand of God to be a
[50:50] prepared vessel in this hour for God to
[50:55] use
[50:56] that he might represent himself praise
[51:00] the Lord hallelujah amen I want you to
[51:04] know my friends as we are here speaking
[51:08] we are speaking the truth in love am for
[51:12] there are many precious and wonderful
[51:16] Believers around the world who are
[51:21] misled misled into believing that
[51:25] the dead Prophet William Marian Branham
[51:29] our
[51:30] brother that he is still their
[51:33] Pastor even though he's
[51:36] dead and they don't
[51:38] recognize that they're going off into a
[51:42] false
[51:44] belief amen amen that teaching is not in
[51:48] line with any
[51:50] Scripture it's not in line with any
[51:53] type it's not in line with any of the
[51:56] Shadows that you can find in the word of
[52:00] God that will cast their Shadows on the
[52:06] wall of time there is no such a thing
[52:10] amen listen my friends I tell you what
[52:15] they should have seen is that when
[52:18] Elijah went up the mantle came
[52:21] down and the mantle fell on the
[52:25] shoulders of
[52:28] Elisha amen listen brother Branham
[52:31] himself in the trial paragraph 102
[52:36] listen to me God takes his man that's
[52:40] right but he never takes his
[52:44] Spirit the spirit that was upon Elijah
[52:48] came down upon Elisha and from then it
[52:53] come on down down and down and down and
[52:58] on down that Spirit was Upon Jesus and
[53:03] now it come down on the
[53:06] church Hallelujah it come down on the
[53:10] church the bride it comes down on the
[53:12] elect Hallelujah and so it goes on and
[53:17] on because we know it has to come again
[53:19] to the Jews right praise the Lord when
[53:22] she goes up then that Spirit now goes to
[53:25] the Jews but he is saying here that
[53:28] Spirit has come back since it left Jesus
[53:32] Christ and it's come back on the Church
[53:35] of the Living God hallelujah how many
[53:37] believe that thank you Jesus amen now we
[53:40] know this truth or if you want to call
[53:43] it a princip this
[53:45] principle that that that Prophet just
[53:48] spoke is still lives today it's
[53:50] efficacious it's effective still today
[53:54] because God did not put away the mantle
[53:57] of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that some
[54:00] of us we've seen that mantle manifested
[54:04] as a pillar of fire above his head we'
[54:07] seen that a mantle
[54:10] manifested as a mantle across his
[54:14] shoulders we have seen that pillar fire
[54:17] in many forms hallelujah amen that same
[54:23] holy spirit of God was the mantle and is
[54:27] still the mantle today praise the Lord
[54:31] hallelujah fulfilling Malachi 45 and 6 I
[54:36] as I've said before amen but now that
[54:41] same spirit is here to fulfill Ephesians
[54:45] 4 thank you Jesus Ephesians 4 Listen
[54:50] from verse
[54:51] 7 but unto every one of us us is given
[54:56] Grace according to the measure of the
[54:58] gift of Christ could you put the
[55:00] scripture up please
[55:02] amen wherefore he said when he ascended
[55:08] up listen on high he led captivity and
[55:14] gave gifts unto
[55:19] men all things and he gave some upon
[55:25] Apostles some prophets some evangelists
[55:30] some pastors teachers for the Perfection
[55:34] of the Saints for the work of the
[55:36] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[55:40] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[55:45] the
[55:45] faith Hallelujah and of the knowledge of
[55:50] the Son of God unto a perfect man
[55:55] W unto the
[55:58] stature measure of the stature of the
[56:02] fullness of
[56:04] Christ that we
[56:07] henceforth having received such
[56:10] Revelation such
[56:12] understanding be no more
[56:16] children tossed to and
[56:18] fro carried about by every wind of
[56:23] Doctrine
[56:25] or by the the
[56:28] slight of
[56:30] mans and cunning
[56:33] craftiness whereby they lie in weight to
[56:38] deceive whether consciously or
[56:41] unconsciously but speaking the truth in
[56:46] love may grow up into him in all things
[56:52] which is the head even Christ
[56:56] Hallelujah now Elijah the prophet of God
[57:00] said that types the
[57:04] bride Hallelujah of course nobody was
[57:07] understanding that elishah types the
[57:09] bride and a lot of stuff preached about
[57:11] that but when the mantle in the first
[57:15] Elisha came down it went straight to
[57:19] Elisha don't tell me the scripture
[57:21] changed and it went somewhere else now
[57:24] if it's right here with the bride and on
[57:27] the
[57:29] bride and it's on her in the form of the
[57:35] fivefold ministry that God has given to
[57:38] this bride in this
[57:41] hour hallelujah hallelujah now she has a
[57:45] manyfold
[57:46] ministry as she ministers back to her
[57:51] husband amen the word that he worked to
[57:56] provide
[57:58] hallelujah amen thank God our ministry
[58:03] is to the glorified
[58:06] Jesus the one who died for me amen
[58:10] hallelujah now let's look into the life
[58:13] of Elijah and Elisha to see the truth uh
[58:18] of this false belief that has misled
[58:22] many of God's precious and one wonderful
[58:25] people and may the Holy Spirit cut off
[58:29] the head of this snake and get rid of it
[58:32] but the True Believers does not look
[58:35] back they don't have any if Wonder with
[58:37] if butts or anything they are certain of
[58:41] God and their faith is placed upon the
[58:45] foundations that was laid by the Master
[58:49] Mason God using a prophet to lay it out
[58:53] Hallelujah pra praise God Amen this
[58:57] belief as I repeat has misled a lot of
[59:01] God's wonderful precious sincere
[59:05] people nothing wrong with the people
[59:08] God's blessed them anointed them but
[59:11] theyve been misled by this false
[59:16] belief now in our scripture reading
[59:20] we're looking at the last days of
[59:23] Elijah as El Elijah was
[59:27] walking and talking with
[59:31] Elisha as they journeyed from
[59:34] gilgal
[59:36] amen beel and Jordan praise the Lord I
[59:41] thank God we have three plls in this
[59:43] message and all through those three plls
[59:47] that Prophet was talking to his
[59:50] disciple to his follower Elisha talking
[59:54] with him
[59:55] whether he understood everything at the
[59:57] beginning uh uh by the time they get to
[1:00:00] Jordan I believe he understood then uh
[1:00:03] clearly because he even knew without
[1:00:06] being told that Elisha is going away uh
[1:00:09] it was revealed to him praise God
[1:00:12] hallelujah amen hallelujah and you see
[1:00:16] that Journey from
[1:00:19] gilgal to beel to Jordan was the testing
[1:00:23] ground for Rel
[1:00:25] elah because under the mockings the
[1:00:29] scoffings the hardness of the journey uh
[1:00:32] he he could have turned back from
[1:00:35] Elijah's message he could have given
[1:00:38] up oh but he stayed with the message
[1:00:42] stayed with that Prophet was speaking
[1:00:44] the word to him Hallelujah just like
[1:00:48] know me gave root the same tree test oh
[1:00:53] even the prophet of himself saying some
[1:00:55] things that if you don't careful it'll
[1:00:57] discourage you it'll tell you go
[1:01:01] back you know uh go back to your mother
[1:01:05] and your father take care of your old
[1:01:08] Daddy what about your aunt that used to
[1:01:11] live with now if you follow me then
[1:01:14] there's nothing there's no money you can
[1:01:16] get there is no big uh worldwide
[1:01:19] Ministry that you can have there is no
[1:01:22] uh big crowds big chur Church it it's
[1:01:25] just me and you walking together here so
[1:01:29] so go back he said no I'm not going back
[1:01:32] Ruth said no I'm not going back amen
[1:01:35] hallelujah your God is my
[1:01:38] God hallelujah I'm seeing what you're
[1:01:41] seeing now I'm not going back because
[1:01:44] I'm holding to God's unchanging hand
[1:01:46] amen praise God hallelujah you see the
[1:01:51] parallel there no he said well uh or go
[1:01:55] back and ARA said you know what you're
[1:01:57] saying makes sense I think I am going to
[1:02:00] go back and she turned back and went
[1:02:02] back to her relatives but Ruth said no
[1:02:07] amen I am going on with you where you
[1:02:10] die I'll die where you live I live
[1:02:13] wherever you are that's where I'm going
[1:02:16] wherever the prophets come to that's
[1:02:18] where we going we're not turning back
[1:02:21] we're not turning to the left or to the
[1:02:23] right but we're going like he did in the
[1:02:26] first
[1:02:27] resurrection amen oh my but you know
[1:02:32] what just like
[1:02:35] Ruth Elijah stood
[1:02:38] faithful he stood loyal to that prophet
[1:02:43] and to the word of God and stood firm in
[1:02:48] the midst of a faithless idol worshiping
[1:02:51] generation they held to the word of the
[1:02:54] words of the Living God hallelujah and
[1:02:57] they did not twist to the left not to
[1:02:59] the right I'm can you say I'm pressing
[1:03:02] on say I'm pressing on say it again I'm
[1:03:06] pressing on I'm pressing on I'm pressing
[1:03:09] on the upward way and New Heights I'm
[1:03:12] gaining every day still praying as I'm
[1:03:16] onward bound Lord plant my feet on
[1:03:19] higher ground amen praise the Lord I'm
[1:03:23] sure while there were
[1:03:25] walking and the Bible says it took the
[1:03:28] time to say they were walking not just
[1:03:30] walking but they were also talking and
[1:03:33] walking and talking my friends no doubt
[1:03:36] they were they looked and they seen the
[1:03:38] sceneries and everything else like that
[1:03:41] you know like right now I'm thinking
[1:03:44] about when I walk through the valley of
[1:03:46] doves where where where Jesus walked to
[1:03:50] to go over to the other side amen praise
[1:03:53] God but but anyway they're my friends
[1:03:57] they were walking and talking but I
[1:04:00] believe their entire conversation was
[1:04:03] not about not just about the scenery
[1:04:07] amen I'm sure Elijah knowing where he
[1:04:12] was going and what was going to happen
[1:04:15] was talking to Elijah and what seems
[1:04:18] like simple
[1:04:20] stories and what seems like just chat he
[1:04:24] was instructing
[1:04:26] elishah he was instructing elishah
[1:04:30] through just simple things as they
[1:04:32] walked and talked along the way and I
[1:04:35] believe God's holy spirit did the same
[1:04:38] things for us through this elishah
[1:04:41] Prophet that God sent in this last day
[1:04:45] hallelujah praise God Amen I believe my
[1:04:49] friends he also was building up Elisha's
[1:04:54] spirit amen he was in other words
[1:04:58] encouraging him that you can do without
[1:05:01] me I don't have to be around uh you know
[1:05:06] uh two of us can't be on the ark at the
[1:05:08] same
[1:05:09] time I I I have to go I got to decrease
[1:05:14] that he might increase you see I can't
[1:05:18] be here encouraging him preparing his
[1:05:21] mind and his heart for
[1:05:25] departure you also he was no doubt
[1:05:29] directing him giving him little hints of
[1:05:33] uh in your work you're going to have
[1:05:35] Kings oppose you mighty men oppose you
[1:05:39] you're going to have to come up against
[1:05:40] kingdoms priests all kinds of people all
[1:05:44] kinds of situations but the Lord our god
[1:05:47] Jehovah is with you amen and he was
[1:05:51] encouraging amen just like like God said
[1:05:54] to him just as I was with Moses I will
[1:05:59] be with
[1:06:00] thee hallelujah praise God but not only
[1:06:04] that he was quickening him he was
[1:06:07] walking talking and speaking words of
[1:06:11] inspiration that will set his soul a
[1:06:14] fire to fulfill the word of God for
[1:06:17] their day and for their hour praise God
[1:06:20] the Bible says in 2 Kings verse 8 and
[1:06:24] Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it
[1:06:28] together and smoked the waters and they
[1:06:32] were divided hither and sther praise God
[1:06:36] I'm so thankful that when that Prophet
[1:06:39] put his hand on the word when he began
[1:06:42] to speak that word that word began to
[1:06:45] break that word begin to open up hither
[1:06:48] and T and everywhere the word start to
[1:06:51] open up and the eyes of the True
[1:06:53] Believer could see it so they know how
[1:06:57] they can walk over they know how they
[1:06:59] can walk in the Rapture they receive
[1:07:02] Rapture and Faith by the words of God
[1:07:05] through the prophet of Malachi
[1:07:08] 45 and it came to
[1:07:11] pass amen they and they too went over on
[1:07:16] dry ground Hallelujah it came to pass
[1:07:20] not it not muddy ground I just pause
[1:07:24] there I want you understand even in all
[1:07:25] them little things God a taking you over

[1:07:31] mind what you believe and everything

[1:07:35] they went over on dry
[1:07:37] ground in other words time tested Faith
[1:07:41] praise God they didn't go over on Guess
[1:07:44] work amen maybe I'll step in quick sand
[1:07:47] maybe this will Happ no no no there's no
[1:07:49] maybe now they are certain of God they
[1:07:52] stand upon the word of of the Living God
[1:07:54] they cross over on dry ground amen and
[1:07:58] it came to pass when they were gone
[1:08:01] over that Elijah said unto elishah ask
[1:08:07] what shall I do for thee before I am
[1:08:12] taken away from thee of course he''s
[1:08:16] already done it amen and Elisha said I
[1:08:21] pray thee let a double portion of th my
[1:08:24] spirit be upon me oh my think about that
[1:08:30] let the double portion of thy Spirit be
[1:08:33] upon
[1:08:35] Me 2 Kings 2:10 and he said th was us a
[1:08:40] hard thing nevertheless if thou see me
[1:08:45] when I am taken from thee it shall be so
[1:08:49] unto thee but if not it shall not be so
[1:08:55] you know many years ago I told Believers
[1:08:59] oh somewhere I don't know I said this
[1:09:01] thought that brother so and so a great
[1:09:04] mighty brother that had captured the
[1:09:06] world and everybody I I believe he
[1:09:09] preached the message called if you see
[1:09:11] me go if you see me go and uh said I
[1:09:16] never heard that message what was in the
[1:09:17] message and I start telling them what I
[1:09:20] think I heard in the message and it's
[1:09:22] only this must we were 20 something
[1:09:24] years later the Holy Spirit saying no he
[1:09:27] never preached such a
[1:09:29] message you that was for you to speak
[1:09:33] now that message right if you see me go
[1:09:37] praise the Lord but he didn't but in my
[1:09:40] mind I was certain that he had preed it
[1:09:42] but he
[1:09:43] didn't and it came to pass as they went
[1:09:47] on and talked behold there appear paed
[1:09:50] Chariot of fire horses of Fire part Ed
[1:09:54] them b a su and Elijah went up by a
[1:09:57] whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it
[1:10:02] just to show you brother brother Elijah
[1:10:04] went up with the Chariots of Fire
[1:10:06] brother Brandon went up in a Kash right
[1:10:11] uh this is a modern Chariot with horse
[1:10:13] power and and you know and Elisha saw
[1:10:18] it and he cried my father my father The
[1:10:23] Chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[1:10:27] thereof and he saw him no more did you
[1:10:32] read that scripture
[1:10:34] again and he saw him no
[1:10:38] more he saw him no more I think that's
[1:10:42] speaking to us it's speaking to everyone
[1:10:46] that will read the scripture itself
[1:10:48] telling you as much as he loved Elijah
[1:10:51] as much as he was loyal to Elijah as
[1:10:54] much as he honored Elijah oh praise God
[1:10:58] he saw him no more praise God and that's
[1:11:03] what we are here not to see him no more
[1:11:07] our eyes are to see Jesus
[1:11:11] only recognize the Lord Jesus
[1:11:15] Christ Hallelujah he who is the
[1:11:20] foundation that one came through the
[1:11:22] seven Church a
[1:11:24] using even this Prophet as a messenger
[1:11:28] and then he comes right back to the
[1:11:31] fullness of the Capstone revelation of
[1:11:35] himself praise God back to the word amen
[1:11:39] back to the original faith in our Lord
[1:11:42] Jesus Christ hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:11:45] and he took a hold of his own clothes
[1:11:47] all the denominational things he used to
[1:11:49] wear before and all the other
[1:11:52] conceptions and beliefs he had had even
[1:11:54] while he was in the message and he rent
[1:11:56] them and tore them to Pieces amen and he
[1:12:00] took up also the mantle of Elijah praise
[1:12:05] the Lord and that fell from him and went
[1:12:10] back and stood by the bank of Jordan
[1:12:15] that's where we are right now is that
[1:12:17] right you believe that's where we are
[1:12:19] right
[1:12:20] now hallelujah oh my my my we're
[1:12:23] standing on the banks of
[1:12:26] Jordan praise the name of the Lord what
[1:12:28] a hour what a time brother
[1:12:31] Believers oh any moment now our Lord can
[1:12:34] come praise God ready for the crossing
[1:12:38] ready for the going over amen praise the
[1:12:41] Lord hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[1:12:45] amen oh praise God then came that
[1:12:51] eventful hour
[1:12:54] of course Elijah was caught up into the
[1:12:57] heavenlies by a band of
[1:13:00] angels that were perceived by the human
[1:13:04] eye as
[1:13:06] chariots and as
[1:13:08] Horses uh in going to the background of
[1:13:10] this you will see that it means
[1:13:12] cherubims and seraphim are the ones that
[1:13:16] really came to take him home seraphim
[1:13:18] means fiery ones and uh cherubims mean
[1:13:22] Chariots of God
[1:13:24] and and and they came to take him back
[1:13:27] home but also it's elishah was speaking
[1:13:31] also what are we going to do now because
[1:13:35] uh the Chariots of Israel the horses of
[1:13:38] Israel that's the strength of a nation
[1:13:41] in those days hallelujah and what he was
[1:13:44] referring to is that your presence in
[1:13:47] Israel was equally or more important
[1:13:52] than Israel having an an
[1:13:54] army because as long as you are there
[1:13:56] and if they had recognized you they
[1:13:58] wouldn't have need to have no
[1:14:00] Army because you are there the enemy
[1:14:02] can't move oh they're coming around the
[1:14:04] site oh they're coming over there or
[1:14:06] they're doing this they're doing that
[1:14:07] even the king's bed chamber telling what
[1:14:09] he's talking about in there no secrets
[1:14:12] from the prophet praise God hallelujah
[1:14:15] amen and it would be would have been the
[1:14:17] same for this Prophet had they looked to
[1:14:20] that and taken that amen praise the Lord
[1:14:23] Lord just before the Rapture just before
[1:14:27] Elijah went up before his
[1:14:31] Rapture is when Elijah asked this
[1:14:35] question asking for a double portion H
[1:14:39] the thing about it you have to notice
[1:14:41] that Elijah didn't rebuke him Elijah
[1:14:44] says how dare you ask for such a
[1:14:48] thing why would you do it no he did not
[1:14:51] rebuke him from ask asking for a double
[1:14:54] portion of what he had what he was
[1:14:58] asking for is I want to inherit your
[1:15:02] mantle I want to inherit the prophet's
[1:15:04] mantle praise the Lord hallelujah see
[1:15:08] see he didn't ask God lord I want twice
[1:15:13] as much as Elijah had that really wasn't
[1:15:16] his prayer he wasn't asking for twice as
[1:15:20] much as Elijah had H his it wasn't a
[1:15:25] prayer of spiritual ambition amen and a
[1:15:30] desire to excel Elijah on the world
[1:15:34] stage it was no such a thing it his
[1:15:36] request was actually one of
[1:15:39] humility because and Elijah understood I
[1:15:43] I I need that double portion to to even
[1:15:46] walk and follow your message and to
[1:15:49] follow in your footsteps I I need to
[1:15:51] have a double portion on me that I might
[1:15:54] do the will of the Living God hallelujah
[1:15:58] praise God so he needed a double
[1:16:01] portion what he was asking for there as
[1:16:04] this opens up a little more is
[1:16:06] Deuteronomy
[1:16:07] 21:17 which speaks about the rights of
[1:16:11] the of a firstborn son that he has the
[1:16:15] right to ask and receive a double
[1:16:18] portion from his father amen and this is
[1:16:22] what Elijah understood all that so this
[1:16:24] is what he was really asking for he not
[1:16:27] Pride it's not asking for power he not
[1:16:30] going out and praying that he might have
[1:16:33] more miracles than brother Bram had
[1:16:35] brother Bram already explained that that
[1:16:38] the the the the the bride collectively
[1:16:41] is going to have more they're going to
[1:16:43] do Greater Works than even Jesus but not
[1:16:46] individual but as the bride as a people
[1:16:49] of God they'll do great Mighty Works Hal
[1:16:53] Hallelujah some you'll never hear of
[1:16:55] until you get to heaven because some of
[1:16:56] those men and women that God will move
[1:16:59] with in that way living hidden lies they
[1:17:01] will even want to cover it up and hide
[1:17:03] it so you don't even know anything about
[1:17:05] it amen but those ones who wants to puff
[1:17:08] and to know and to be known and to be
[1:17:11] recognized and to be seen I did this and
[1:17:14] I did that and I'm not even uh praise
[1:17:18] about it you got to know they will be
[1:17:21] the ones that brother called living a
[1:17:24] hidden life amen they're going to Pro
[1:17:27] classet and they pray quietly amen and
[1:17:31] God manifesting himself by the word
[1:17:34] Hallelujah by the Holy Spirit praise God
[1:17:37] Amen yes sir he wanted the rights of the
[1:17:42] firstborn in First
[1:17:45] Kings chapter
[1:17:47] 19 vers 15 to 21 you will see the call
[1:17:55] of Elijah Elisha sorry Elisha and in
[1:17:59] this you will see that God it wasn't
[1:18:03] Elisha thought I want a good man to
[1:18:05] follow me after I leave or after I uh
[1:18:10] retire not that he could say that back
[1:18:12] then but praise God I I I want God uh
[1:18:17] you no he didn't pray like he didn't
[1:18:19] even pray about anything God came to him
[1:18:21] the Bible says if you read that chapter
[1:18:24] and said
[1:18:25] Elijah
[1:18:27] arise go down to so and so place you
[1:18:30] will there you will find safat Elisha
[1:18:34] the son of safat the
[1:18:36] farmer amen go to him and anoint him
[1:18:42] amen what he is going to be propit in
[1:18:46] your stad Oh Glory to God the voice is
[1:18:50] now in the bride Hallelujah and she
[1:18:53] knows what to do with the word there's
[1:18:56] not the prophet isn't here but the bride
[1:18:59] Saints of the Living God elected are
[1:19:01] here and the same word the same message
[1:19:04] the same power in the Holy Spirit
[1:19:06] Hallelujah working through the bride
[1:19:09] hallelujah amen yes sir yes sir so we
[1:19:14] find out that Elisha Elijah went by
[1:19:18] Divine
[1:19:19] command which means that Elisha
[1:19:24] was elected that's right by God himself
[1:19:28] amen
[1:19:30] before he elishah himself knew it
[1:19:32] abolutely he was already
[1:19:35] elected but then God had to send
[1:19:38] Elisha to call
[1:19:41] him is that right and you read the
[1:19:45] scripture the Bible says and when Elisha
[1:19:47] got there he he told him uh leave the
[1:19:51] father mother far and everything and
[1:19:53] come and follow me and the Bible says he
[1:19:56] took the mantle from off his
[1:19:58] shoulder and he laid it on top of
[1:20:02] Elisha's shoulder this is just in the
[1:20:05] beginning when he just get the call

[1:25:03] or anything like that it's you
[1:25:04] recognizing your day your message
[1:25:07] Hallelujah you recognizing the word for
[1:25:11] your
[1:25:12] hour praise the name of the Lord praise
[1:25:16] God later on we didn't even see the man
[1:25:20] we heard his tapes on some of those big
[1:25:22] old Wen sack with corners and all kinds
[1:25:26] of books man I go far back enough when
[1:25:29] there were still typing some of the
[1:25:31] books to the books were not out as yet
[1:25:34] and people were trying to hand type them
[1:25:35] as fast as they can and give them to
[1:25:37] whoever else and pass them around and
[1:25:40] photocopy them or whatever and pass them
[1:25:42] on now we got all the equipment is being
[1:25:45] uh translated being printed and many
[1:25:48] hands make light
[1:25:51] work praise God and then finally we were
[1:25:54] able to actually see the man on video
[1:26:00] praise God God using Brother uh perig
[1:26:03] green to obtain that from uh the brother
[1:26:07] over there I think in New Zealand amen
[1:26:10] uh who had the tape but he didn't know
[1:26:13] uh because he he used to attend the Full
[1:26:15] Gospel business man's meetings and he
[1:26:17] didn't know he had the tape called Deep
[1:26:19] to the deep and in talking with Brother
[1:26:21] P
[1:26:22] it came out that he had a tape of
[1:26:24] brother brandom and when brother Perry
[1:26:26] looked at it whoa he said I got a we got
[1:26:30] to take this and multiply it and give it
[1:26:33] to the world and you know the rest of
[1:26:34] the story we have it now right now
[1:26:38] praise God hallelujah but I want to tell
[1:26:41] you with all the books with all the
[1:26:42] tapes with all those things and with the
[1:26:44] video and all it's wonderful but the
[1:26:47] greatest thing he left us is his
[1:26:50] character his example that we can
[1:26:54] follow Hallelujah a Christlike life that
[1:26:58] impressed us touched us changed us
[1:27:01] transformed us hallelujah and I thank
[1:27:05] God for it amen oh praise God I believe
[1:27:10] that our calling to the message that
[1:27:13] mantle already came on our shoulders in
[1:27:16] the form of the message itself and the
[1:27:19] word of God hallelujah we we continue to
[1:27:22] speak on this we have some more time and
[1:27:24] we'll speak on it is that okay
[1:27:26] amen hallelujah so
[1:27:30] then that mantle was
[1:27:34] already on and is already on our
[1:27:38] shoulders in baby form from the time you
[1:27:41] received the message God already
[1:27:43] identify you you know I don't want to go
[1:27:46] off on all kinds of angles but you know
[1:27:48] God already identified you and placed
[1:27:51] you called you and plac you right beside
[1:27:55] the prophet doesn't mean we could to
[1:27:57] walk with him everywhere he went but
[1:27:59] we're walking with the message am some
[1:28:01] of us go to work with it some of us
[1:28:04] listening to it in the car some of us
[1:28:06] listening to it before we fall asleep we
[1:28:09] wake up we hear the message we we're
[1:28:12] following him we're walking with the
[1:28:14] prophet hallelujah amen we're walking
[1:28:17] with him every step that he's taken
[1:28:20] hallelujah amen and then we answered
[1:28:24] that call praise the Lord so when Elijah
[1:28:29] went up when brother Branham died
[1:28:33] Hallelujah we find out the emphasis
[1:28:38] was what Elisha told him if when I am
[1:28:43] taken from you if you see me go if you
[1:28:47] see and I emphasize the word
[1:28:49] see if you see me go you can have it you
[1:28:54] can have what you ask for first of all
[1:28:56] let me back up here to explain to you
[1:28:59] that
[1:29:00] Elijah knew that he couldn't really give
[1:29:04] his mantle to
[1:29:07] Elisha and he knew it was somebody
[1:29:09] else's right to do the giving so he said
[1:29:13] this is a hard saying who knows I don't
[1:29:15] know if he pray or what he did but the
[1:29:18] god already watching and know those
[1:29:19] things Hallelujah so it's a hard thing
[1:29:23] because he can't give a prophetic gift
[1:29:26] to anybody he he can't pass on an
[1:29:29] apostleship to somebody else he can't
[1:29:32] give a gift of Prophecy to another young
[1:29:37] man that he wants to that might have
[1:29:39] been his human desire but as he he is a
[1:29:43] prophet know that he can't do that he
[1:29:46] don't have the power to do that and
[1:29:48] those things are by Grace it's by God
[1:29:51] himself has to do that Hallelujah so he
[1:29:55] says you're asking me a hard thing
[1:29:57] nevertheless if that shows he himself
[1:30:00] don't know he said if you see me go the
[1:30:03] thing the emphasis is you got to be able
[1:30:05] to see me you got to have something in
[1:30:08] you that will enable you to see me go oh
[1:30:14] isn't that wonderful I think that's
[1:30:16] really wonderful and um God bless him
[1:30:19] because Elisha was a loyal father
[1:30:22] follow even in the times when we didn't
[1:30:26] understand everything we we didn't
[1:30:29] understand even the first thing you
[1:30:31] heard the serpent seed you didn't
[1:30:33] understand it but you didn't understand
[1:30:36] marriage and divorce you didn't
[1:30:38] understand and you can go down the line
[1:30:40] but the thing about it is not the actual
[1:30:44] writings the sayings of the doctrines
[1:30:47] the Unseen presence of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:51] was witnessing you speak for yourself
[1:30:53] I'm speaking for me now that he was
[1:30:56] speaking to my
[1:30:58] heart that's thus say it the Lord that
[1:31:03] is the word of God that's the truth
[1:31:06] praise God hallelujah and I'm rest my
[1:31:09] entire life future Ministry and
[1:31:12] everything on that because I believed it
[1:31:15] from the bottom of my
[1:31:16] [Applause]
[1:31:18] soulall praise God there was no you said
[1:31:22] oh I believe the message but back when
[1:31:25] this message first came and dropped down
[1:31:28] there was no preaching circuit for
[1:31:31] anybody to go around and possibly to
[1:31:34] raise funds whether for themselves or
[1:31:36] for Missions there was no such a thing
[1:31:39] you had to be you had to come to the
[1:31:40] word by faith Hallelujah I came to North
[1:31:44] America you can come maybe five or 10
[1:31:47] churches on your hand there was nowhere
[1:31:50] else there was nobody else else so you
[1:31:53] you couldn't think that you're going to
[1:31:55] make a fortune or you going to have this
[1:31:59] big Ministry or this or that your entire
[1:32:03] Reliance was upon
[1:32:05] God your missionary trip was not made up
[1:32:08] of going to from church to church and uh
[1:32:11] automatically raise enough funds and
[1:32:13] then you have the faith to go oh no you
[1:32:18] went completely by raw primitive
[1:32:22] Christian faith relying on no man no
[1:32:26] nothing but resting upon God's Divine
[1:32:29] Providence on the Promises of his word
[1:32:32] hallelujah amen praise God Amen I want
[1:32:37] you to know that he was a loyal follower
[1:32:41] and supporter of Elijah doesn't matter
[1:32:44] what and he was obedient to Elijah's
[1:32:49] teaching he was humble and when I I use
[1:32:53] that term I place that there because
[1:32:55] remembering all the mockings and
[1:32:56] scoffings of them sons of of uh of the
[1:33:00] prophets uh these so-called Christians
[1:33:04] nominal
[1:33:05] Believers uh oh there's Elijah pass
[1:33:09] Elisha
[1:33:10] passing you know he used to wash the
[1:33:12] hands of
[1:33:14] Elijah of course that's a he's telling
[1:33:16] him that he's nothing like a footwash
[1:33:18] flunky that he was Elijah's flunky
[1:33:22] why why you know I've heard people say
[1:33:24] that to brother like Peter why do you
[1:33:26] have to listen to brother Simon like
[1:33:27] that why why you have to go uh Always by
[1:33:31] his side why you always asking him
[1:33:34] questions why you always want to go
[1:33:36] where he go why you you want to do this
[1:33:38] you want to do that but you see they
[1:33:40] don't understand that man saw something
[1:33:43] he wasn't looking at me he was looking
[1:33:45] at what was there and manifesting itself
[1:33:50] and he could see that if nobody else
[1:33:51] could see it he saw it and therefore
[1:33:55] praise God God blessed him and manifest
[1:33:58] himself through him don't know how he
[1:33:59] got into this but anyway praise the
[1:34:04] Lord thank you
[1:34:06] Jesus all them wonderful things were
[1:34:09] good he took all the mockings all the
[1:34:11] scoffings praise the name of is that
[1:34:13] right I come to this message and I would
[1:34:16] walk down the street of of the village
[1:34:19] or the tong and you would hear the
[1:34:21] people say saying there goes the serpent
[1:34:22] seed
[1:34:25] man look a bromite passing oh my all the
[1:34:29] mockings and all the scoffings you bore
[1:34:33] the reproach for the word of the Living
[1:34:35] God hallelujah amen praise God all of
[1:34:40] that was good but the promise was that
[1:34:43] was good if you see me
[1:34:46] go
[1:34:48] Elisha we know received Elijah's
[1:34:53] Mantle and the reason why he received
[1:34:56] the mantle is because he saw the word in
[1:35:01] its
[1:35:03] Ascension he saw the word Prophet back
[1:35:06] then physically going up in his
[1:35:09] Ascension surrounded by the fires of God
[1:35:12] the pillar of fire the Living God Amen
[1:35:16] Hallelujah to the elected bride in this
[1:35:19] day and in this hour we don't see the
[1:35:22] physical Prophet caught up and see the
[1:35:25] pillar of fire taking him up in the
[1:35:28] presence of the Living God but when we
[1:35:32] look at the message the word the body of
[1:35:35] truth that he has left behind we see the
[1:35:38] pillar of fire we see the revelation of
[1:35:41] the word as it's in its Ascension from
[1:35:45] octave to acave to acave Glory unto
[1:35:49] Glory Hallelujah oh praise God and God
[1:35:53] says if you see that amen if you see me
[1:35:56] go the mantle is there for you to use
[1:36:00] for his glory and for his honor amen oh
[1:36:04] my we seen it glory to glory until it's
[1:36:08] shining brighter and brighter until we
[1:36:10] step into that perfect day oh praise God
[1:36:14] forever more verse 12 2 Kings 2:12 says
[1:36:19] and from that time he saw him no more
[1:36:24] how he going to see him he seen the
[1:36:25] purifier he see he seen the lights of
[1:36:28] God he seen the fire of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:31] around him he saw him no more listen to
[1:36:35] brother Brandon speaking and the message
[1:36:37] called the rising of the
[1:36:41] sun oh
[1:36:43] friends if I can only get myself out of
[1:36:49] the way so that when William brandham is
[1:36:54] thought of that you is not even thought
[1:36:59] of
[1:37:01] anymore and you not even he repeats and
[1:37:05] you not even sought of him
[1:37:09] anymore till we can see
[1:37:12] Jesus glorified Among Us seeing him that
[1:37:18] is our
[1:37:19] desire and that gives us the quickening
[1:37:23] power the mantle the quickening power
[1:37:26] comes upon you Hallelujah it gives you
[1:37:30] Joy to know that we are with him both
[1:37:34] flesh and born of him for We Are The
[1:37:36] Bride of him and see him with his
[1:37:40] Vindicated means and methods and proving
[1:37:44] by that in us and through us that he is
[1:37:48] now risen from the dead Jesus Christ
[1:37:51] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:37:54] forever Elijah then Elijah in Elisha
[1:37:57] Elijah in John the Baptist the spirit of
[1:37:59] Elijah moving in Christ which is the
[1:38:01] spirit of Christ The Same Spirit back in
[1:38:04] our day in Malachi 4:5 Hallelujah and
[1:38:08] continues to move on and on and on to
[1:38:11] fulfill the word of God
[1:38:14] hallelujah amen
[1:38:17] hallelujah you see Elisha had to see him
[1:38:21] go in that
[1:38:24] way Isaiah chapter
[1:38:27] 6 you don't have to put up that
[1:38:29] scripture because most of you know
[1:38:32] it it starts in the year that King
[1:38:37] Uzziah died Isaiah saw the
[1:38:42] Lord is that right you see my
[1:38:45] friends once that uh hero uh you know
[1:38:51] your Boyhood
[1:38:53] friend your your brother because Elijah
[1:38:57] I mean Isaiah and Uzziah were good
[1:39:01] bodies they grew up together one are
[1:39:05] maybe his father was well off but this
[1:39:08] is the king and they grew up together so
[1:39:10] he always walking with Uzziah and they
[1:39:13] together in that social status that line
[1:39:16] that they were in they walk like that
[1:39:19] but the year God had to live literally
[1:39:21] take away Isiah so that Isaiah can get
[1:39:25] his eyes off of him and Look to Him
[1:39:29] Jehovah and the same God had to take the
[1:39:33] prophet out of the way that you and I
[1:39:35] can keep our eyes on Jesus Look Away to
[1:39:40] Jesus Look Away to Jesus let my eyes see
[1:39:45] Jesus only let my feet walk in his way
[1:39:49] oh blessed be the name of the Living God
[1:39:52] as Elijah ascended Elisha saw what not
[1:39:56] Elijah but he saw the power and the
[1:39:59] glory of the re revelation of God
[1:40:02] hallelujah God revealing himself that's
[1:40:05] what he saw and he saw Elijah no more
[1:40:09] because what he want to see now is that
[1:40:11] revelation of God continuing on
[1:40:14] Hallelujah and when the elect of God
[1:40:17] sees the great words of God in this last
[1:40:21] day set on fire amen when that word
[1:40:25] begins to shine light upon your pathway

[1:40:46] Illusions Jesus is our
[1:40:48] lord Jesus died for our sins Jesus H on
[1:40:53] the cross Jesus rose again Jesus lives

[1:41:01] dead the prophets are dead but thank God

[1:41:07] today
[1:41:08] amen it is the rising of the sun
[1:41:13] hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the
[1:41:17] Lord oh the eyes of this elect bride
[1:41:21] see only Jesus Christ the revealed word
[1:41:26] remember what I say doesn't mean they
[1:41:28] forget brother Bram don't mean they push
[1:41:30] him in the background push him somewhere
[1:41:32] else Hallelujah they know who he is they
[1:41:36] know his position even more than they
[1:41:38] knew before they honor him they love him
[1:41:41] they respect him Hallelujah he was just
[1:41:45] one of our brothers with the highest
[1:41:48] calling of our age to carry out the will
[1:41:51] and purpose of the Living God and he
[1:41:54] completed his
[1:41:56] work amen and now he has placed Us in
[1:42:01] the hands of the bridegroom of our Isaac
[1:42:05] and our eyes are on Isaac only our eyes
[1:42:09] are on Jesus only our eyes is on the
[1:42:13] Lord not the messenger but on the Lord
[1:42:16] himself and we give him the glory and
[1:42:18] the honor and the praise
[1:42:21] thank
[1:42:23] hallelujah praise God forever more thank
[1:42:27] God that
[1:42:29] Elisha inherited Elijah's Mantle but why
[1:42:34] did he uh inherit it like
[1:42:40] um where was I yes he was saying it is a
[1:42:43] hard thing but really when I looked into
[1:42:48] that that's really saying in the Hebrew
[1:42:53] it is not mine to
[1:42:55] give
[1:42:57] right he can't give it uh but but yet he
[1:43:01] had it why can't he give it you see then
[1:43:03] it becomes a puzle he got it why can't
[1:43:05] he give it but he can't give it but it's
[1:43:08] not his to give and so there but Elijah
[1:43:13] got it well how did he get it not from
[1:43:16] Elijah but he got it from the one who
[1:43:19] told Elijah go and call him out of this
[1:43:22] whole rotten stinking world I want to
[1:43:24] call him out I want to call her out
[1:43:26] Hallelujah and his understanding his
[1:43:28] Revelation his discernment and all that
[1:43:31] that is going to come back and work
[1:43:32] through them Hallelujah uh Discerning
[1:43:36] the age bringing the word for the age
[1:43:39] the voice now in the bride the Holy
[1:43:42] Spirit working through a many membered
[1:43:44] body Hallelujah not Malachi 4:5 anymore
[1:43:48] but Ephesians 4 making itself manifest
[1:43:51] Hallelujah a bride ministering back to
[1:43:54] her husband oh praise God hallelujah
[1:43:57] amen so then we can clearly see now
[1:44:02] elishah did not receive the mantle by
[1:44:07] blood
[1:44:09] relations is that
[1:44:11] right he did not receive the mantle by
[1:44:15] natural
[1:44:17] sunship he could not get it by natural
[1:44:20] sunship even if he was a natural son he
[1:44:22] wouldn't get it that way because it's
[1:44:25] it's God has to give that it can't be
[1:44:29] passed down there is no such a a a lie
[1:44:36] such a Doctrine as Apostolic
[1:44:39] succession that's a madeup Doctrine by
[1:44:42] the Babylonian
[1:44:44] cartel and and and people are living off
[1:44:46] of that uh Babylonian belief to this day
[1:44:50] that that there's such a thing as
[1:44:51] Apostolic succession Peter couldn't give
[1:44:54] anybody
[1:44:55] anything none of them could hand off
[1:44:57] their they they their thing to somebody
[1:45:00] else they could not do it God has to do
[1:45:03] that and such it and so there is
[1:45:07] therefore no teaching also of prophetic
[1:45:11] succession no it's not in the scriptures
[1:45:16] there's no example of any such a
[1:45:19] thing and if you look on it you'll never
[1:45:22] find it in the entire
[1:45:25] Bible but he did receive the mantle by
[1:45:28] his spiritual
[1:45:30] sunship is that right you see Elisha had
[1:45:34] no
[1:45:34] children and when Elisha came out God
[1:45:39] told him to take him he became his
[1:45:41] spiritual son and Elisha Elijah became
[1:45:46] his spiritual father right so
[1:45:48] automatically he was Elijah J firstborn
[1:45:52] if you want to put it that way he was
[1:45:54] his firstborn so when he was claiming
[1:45:56] that double portion it was the
[1:45:59] birthright of the firstborn or the right
[1:46:02] of the firstborn to ask for a double
[1:46:05] portion over the rest of all of them
[1:46:09] amen there might be a lot of other
[1:46:10] Christians a lot of other believers but
[1:46:13] he had and she had the right to ask for
[1:46:16] double
[1:46:17] portion hallelujah amen
[1:46:21] and he received the mantle also because
[1:46:24] of adopted
[1:46:26] sunship because Elijah adopted him from
[1:46:30] his father if you want to put it that
[1:46:32] way you got I don't want to preach on
[1:46:34] that but you come through the same
[1:46:35] stages right uh like that adoption and
[1:46:39] so praise the name of the Lord
[1:46:41] hallelujah amen so he received that
[1:46:44] mantle by the rights of the firstborn
[1:46:47] son repeat the scripture for you that
[1:46:50] you might know where it is Deuteronomy
[1:46:53] 21:17 praise the
[1:46:55] Lord re elected remember
[1:46:59] called placed by God's Mighty hand and
[1:47:05] listen what Matthew 10:41 could you put
[1:47:07] that up for me it's important that they
[1:47:09] read that Matthew chap
[1:47:12] 10:
[1:47:14] 41 and let's read
[1:47:19] that he he that receiveth a prophet in
[1:47:23] the name of a prophet what
[1:47:28] shall

[1:57:32] amen and it makes no difference to us
[1:57:36] let God take care of if one tribe wants
[1:57:39] to stay on the other side of the
[1:57:42] Jordan then that's up to them that's
[1:57:45] their decision but I come on this side
[1:57:49] of the
[1:57:50] Jordan but you know you'll find that let
[1:57:53] me give you uh somewhere I have a
[1:57:56] scripture uh for that somewhere in here
[1:58:00] just a minute maybe I did not write it
[1:58:02] down I think it's Joshua the Book of
[1:58:04] Joshua somewhere in there chapter 14 but
[1:58:09] it talks about when the children of
[1:58:12] Ruben after they went in they went into
[1:58:16] the message they went into the land they
[1:58:19] they overcame the land the the the it
[1:58:22] was established now and what happened
[1:58:25] they say Reuben manasse and God they
[1:58:29] said we we we going to stay on the other
[1:58:32] side of the river right there certain of
[1:58:34] Moses you know they know who Moses is
[1:58:38] right but Joshua is Young and yeah you
[1:58:41] know he's just talking like that you
[1:58:43] know so we're going to stay on this side
[1:58:46] anyway for to be safe we're going to
[1:58:48] stay on the side where Moses was and
[1:58:51] they stay on that side of the river and
[1:58:53] the rest of the Brethren at first thing
[1:58:56] they pull their swords and Spears and
[1:58:59] came down there to have War amen just
[1:59:02] like in this message you they came down
[1:59:05] for war amen oh my you oh my goodness
[1:59:10] one brother told y he said Brothers sit
[1:59:12] down or I'll bury you with coats here

[1:59:19] for war amen but my when they came for
[1:59:23] war the tribe of you Ruben and them said
[1:59:26] let's talk first and they start to talk
[1:59:28] and they start to talk they didn't
[1:59:30] change their view that they want to stay
[1:59:33] on that side of the river and this side
[1:59:35] didn't change their view but this one
[1:59:37] said look if you get a war across the
[1:59:40] river we're coming over and we're going
[1:59:42] to fight the war with you because we are
[1:59:44] one with you is that right we just
[1:59:46] choose to be on this side of the river
[1:59:48] amen but if you got a war we coming
[1:59:51] we're going to be there fighting for you
[1:59:52] and then they say oh if you got a war
[1:59:54] then uh even though we don't believe you
[1:59:56] should be staying over there we're
[1:59:58] coming to defend you we're going to
[2:00:00] fight for you amen because we are all
[2:00:03] Brethren praise the name of the Lord Oh
[2:00:06] Glory to
[2:00:08] God hallelujah amen oh praise God so I
[2:00:13] want to say regardless of what views and
[2:00:16] ideas you have you look when you give to
[2:00:19] a man of God you're not a real man of
[2:00:24] God you're not given to the
[2:00:29] man of course the man will receive it
[2:00:32] but it's not the man you're giving that
[2:00:34] giv you're giving it to God than look
[2:00:38] this is no trick this is no smart ideas
[2:00:43] like I am putting out here to say that's
[2:00:47] why you should give no no no no no it's
[2:00:50] Absol you're giv to God Amen so then
