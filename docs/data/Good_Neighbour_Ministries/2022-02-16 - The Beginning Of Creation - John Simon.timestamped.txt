[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] good evening friends
[0:18] it is with great joy
[0:20] that we come together
[0:22] in the presence of the lord
[0:25] may his divine presence
[0:28] bless us may he pour out
[0:32] of the fullness of himself
[0:34] upon us
[0:36] god bless everyone everywhere
[0:41] that
[0:42] will hear or see
[0:44] this word of god
[0:47] now we will speak
[0:50] tonight on the subject of
[0:54] the beginning
[0:55] of the creation
[0:57] of god
[1:00] and this
[1:01] is found
[1:03] in revelation chapter 3
[1:06] verse 14.
[1:08] it reads
[1:10] thus
[1:12] and unto the church
[1:16] of the laodiceans right
[1:20] these things
[1:22] said the amen
[1:25] the faithful and true witness
[1:29] the beginning
[1:31] of the creation
[1:33] of god
[1:35] amen
[1:36] gracious heavenly father
[1:40] we pray that thou wilt so fertilize and
[1:44] anoint our understanding
[1:49] that the great holy spirit
[1:51] of almighty god
[1:54] will
[1:55] open up and magnify
[1:58] thy word to us
[2:02] that our
[2:03] spirit our
[2:05] being
[2:06] may be able to grasp it all
[2:10] into our hearts father
[2:13] and that by that
[2:15] we'll receive divine strength
[2:18] to come against
[2:20] the falsehoods
[2:22] the lies
[2:23] discrepancies and illusions of the devil
[2:28] may you take all the glory
[2:30] praise and honor father
[2:33] as we surrender ourselves
[2:36] as vessels
[2:38] for you to
[2:40] manifest yourself through by the
[2:43] opening of the word and manifestation of
[2:45] the holy ghost
[2:47] in the name of our blessed lord jesus
[2:52] amen and amen
[2:57] of course the scripture
[2:59] that we read
[3:02] if not understood
[3:07] many will take a wrong interpretation
[3:12] they will take a wrong
[3:14] understanding
[3:16] of it because these
[3:20] words
[3:21] that you may read
[3:23] the beginning
[3:25] of the creation of god
[3:30] it means more than what it sounds like
[3:36] because those words don't mean exactly
[3:40] how it sounds to us
[3:43] and in fact multitudes of people
[3:48] have carnally
[3:50] misunderstood
[3:52] the word of god
[3:54] and around that was built a great
[3:57] organization
[3:59] that taught
[4:01] and still teaches
[4:04] that
[4:05] jesus was just the first creation of god
[4:08] the very first
[4:10] thing that god created was jesus
[4:14] and then
[4:16] the first creation
[4:18] jesus created all the rest
[4:22] of
[4:23] the creation universe and whatever is
[4:28] contained
[4:30] within that universe
[4:33] but that is not right
[4:35] that is unscriptural
[4:37] that does not agree
[4:40] with the rest of the scriptures
[4:43] for the words are
[4:45] that he is the
[4:48] beginner
[4:50] or in other words the author
[4:55] of the creation
[4:57] of god
[5:00] every one of us surely we would know or
[5:03] should know
[5:05] that jesus christ is god himself
[5:11] and
[5:12] the very idea
[5:16] that
[5:17] some one would think to believe
[5:20] that god created
[5:22] god
[5:24] is is absolutely
[5:27] nonsensical
[5:29] it doesn't make any sense for god
[5:33] the eternal being
[5:36] the moment the word create how can you
[5:38] create another eternal being so god
[5:42] did not create jesus for jesus himself
[5:46] is god
[5:48] he is not another god
[5:50] he is not a secondary god
[5:53] he is not a younger god
[5:56] oh he is
[5:58] very god the only god the same one
[6:03] yesterday today and forever and thank
[6:08] god i can testify
[6:11] he lives in me
[6:14] he lives in me the god the creator of
[6:17] all heavens and earth has returned back
[6:20] to earth again
[6:22] and he lives in me to the glory of his
[6:25] mighty name hallelujah
[6:28] amen praise god
[6:30] amen we find in the scriptures
[6:35] john 1
[6:38] amen
[6:39] the bible tells us
[6:41] it all things were made by him
[6:45] and without him was not not anything
[6:50] made
[6:51] that
[6:52] was made
[6:54] he is the one of whom it is said in
[6:56] genesis 1 1.
[6:59] in the beginning
[7:01] god created
[7:03] the heaven
[7:05] and the earth
[7:06] and again
[7:09] in exodus chapter 20
[7:12] verse 11
[7:14] for in six days
[7:17] the lord made heaven and earth
[7:21] the sea
[7:22] and all
[7:24] that in them is
[7:26] and rested
[7:28] on the seventh day
[7:31] but there is no doubt that he is the
[7:34] creator
[7:36] and he was the creator
[7:39] of a finished
[7:41] physical creation
[7:43] amen praise god hallelujah remember john
[7:48] 1 1 says in the beginning
[7:51] was the word
[7:53] and the word was with god
[7:57] and the word
[7:58] was god
[8:00] amen
[8:02] and that word which was god
[8:06] became flesh
[8:08] and without him was nothing made that
[8:12] was made all thanks be to god
[8:16] that he lives forevermore
[8:19] and a god eternal god
[8:22] my god he is
[8:24] he cannot die
[8:26] he always has existed
[8:29] is present tense now
[8:32] existing
[8:33] and will exist forevermore praise god
[8:38] hallelujah
[8:39] amen
[8:41] now we understand hallelujah god created
[8:45] all these things because he is
[8:48] among all things he is the creator
[8:52] take god
[8:53] and first
[8:55] he created a physical creation
[8:59] and that physical creation of the earth
[9:02] the days the the seas the uh the light
[9:06] the
[9:07] sun the stars
[9:09] all those things mentioned in genesis 1
[9:14] created adam
[9:16] out of adam he took
[9:19] eve the wife
[9:21] so god created in the physical creation
[9:24] the earth
[9:26] the man
[9:28] and then the wife
[9:30] out of that man
[9:34] hallelujah
[9:37] so he was the author
[9:39] he was and is the beginner
[9:43] of the physical creation
[9:46] but now he is in these church ages he is
[9:50] presenting himself
[9:52] and saying
[9:54] i am not only the author
[9:57] of the physical creation
[10:00] but i
[10:02] am the author
[10:05] of this spiritual creation
[10:08] which we know
[10:10] by from the apostle paul
[10:12] is called the new creation
[10:16] which is what jesus himself was
[10:18] referring to
[10:20] when he said when he was in spirit form
[10:22] he said uh you know my father worked
[10:27] hitherto
[10:29] amen
[10:30] in other words when i was in spirit form
[10:34] this natural creation was made
[10:37] now he came to earth and he was in flesh
[10:40] he says but now i work
[10:43] amen
[10:44] he is now
[10:46] working
[10:47] to bring about the
[10:49] new creation
[10:51] praise god hallelujah amen
[10:55] so he is the author of both natural
[10:59] and spiritual
[11:01] creation
[11:03] hallelujah and we thank god
[11:06] that he stands here again
[11:10] in the midst
[11:11] of his
[11:12] church glory to god hallelujah
[11:16] and he calls himself
[11:18] the author
[11:20] or the originator
[11:22] or the beginner
[11:24] of this new creation
[11:27] that is emerging
[11:29] even as i speak
[11:32] the new creation
[11:34] is manifesting and emerging
[11:37] oh praise god and he's saying
[11:41] my hands are
[11:43] manifest and involved
[11:46] in their life
[11:48] and in the power of the holy spirit
[11:51] working in and through them to bring me
[11:55] glory
[11:56] and honor hallelujah so he is the
[12:00] creator
[12:02] of the true church
[12:05] that he builds himself
[12:09] man no group
[12:12] no administration or association
[12:16] can truly build
[12:18] the true church
[12:20] they can build churches but i'm talking
[12:23] about the
[12:25] bride herself
[12:27] i'm speaking of the true elected church
[12:31] the elected lady of god
[12:34] only god
[12:36] can she originate from
[12:39] and god is saying here
[12:42] i am the originator the beginner the
[12:45] author
[12:46] of this new creation
[12:49] by the power
[12:51] of the holy spirit
[12:53] the heavenly bridegroom
[12:56] now creating his
[12:58] his own pride
[13:01] in the
[13:02] genesis
[13:04] we see god
[13:07] spirit coming to adam
[13:10] and
[13:11] god
[13:13] creating the wife
[13:15] out of adam
[13:18] notice he did not take
[13:21] another different piece of earth
[13:25] to make her
[13:27] but she took apart he took a part of him
[13:31] to make her the wife
[13:35] now in this last day
[13:38] on the divine inspiration
[13:41] the same holy spirit
[13:44] because the heavenly bright groom
[13:47] is the word of god
[13:51] god has taken
[13:54] hallelujah
[13:56] he the heavenly bridegroom
[13:59] god himself has taken
[14:02] a part of himself
[14:07] to
[14:08] bring his bride
[14:11] into her fullness of manifestation
[14:15] praise god
[14:17] displaying in in adam and eve
[14:21] what he would do now
[14:23] at the end of the age
[14:26] and what he is doing
[14:28] now in this hour oh praise be to god who
[14:32] lives forevermore glory to god
[14:36] hallelujah
[14:37] amen
[14:38] notice
[14:40] he created his own body
[14:44] he created his own temple
[14:47] said i would let solomon you you can't
[14:49] really build me a temple
[14:52] amen and so i'll build my own house
[14:56] and so
[14:57] when
[14:59] it is claimed
[15:01] by another group
[15:04] that mary
[15:05] is the mother of god
[15:08] for she
[15:10] produced and created that body
[15:14] that came from her
[15:16] amen
[15:18] but that is simply unscriptural and
[15:21] wrong
[15:22] for it would mean
[15:24] out of sinful
[15:27] mankind
[15:28] came the sinless one
[15:31] which is unscriptural
[15:33] uh you know saying that
[15:36] out of the uh dirty
[15:40] you're going to take something clean and
[15:43] pure out of that it is impossible and it
[15:46] is unscriptural
[15:48] for
[15:49] god himself
[15:51] has spoken
[15:54] amen
[15:56] that he will build his own temple
[15:58] natural spiritual
[16:00] hallelujah
[16:02] praise god
[16:04] no natural man could produce the last
[16:08] adam christ
[16:10] the word of god hallelujah
[16:13] the bible speaks of him
[16:15] and says
[16:17] law
[16:18] a body
[16:20] has thou
[16:21] prepared for me
[16:23] hallelujah amen so god provided the body
[16:28] not mary provided the body
[16:32] the body simply passed through mary but
[16:36] did not come from mary
[16:39] for the scripture tells us
[16:41] that god prepared him
[16:44] a body amen glory to god
[16:48] she was just a human vessel
[16:51] to carry that child
[16:55] and bring him forth to birth
[16:58] amen
[16:59] and that is why
[17:01] jesus the god
[17:02] man god and yet man
[17:06] man and yet god
[17:08] he was the jehovah of the old testament
[17:14] now the jesus of the new testament
[17:18] not another god
[17:20] but the same god
[17:22] in a visible form for the word was made
[17:27] flesh
[17:28] and dwelt among us
[17:30] oh praise god hallelujah thanks be to
[17:34] god you see
[17:36] it was a he was a god man
[17:39] for my friends
[17:41] he was
[17:43] the first
[17:45] or let's
[17:46] let me say this way he was the wave
[17:49] chief
[17:50] of the new creation hallelujah to be
[17:54] resurrected and waved over us as if to
[17:59] say many of the others will come forth
[18:02] from this field of earth
[18:05] and they will come forth
[18:07] and there will be of the same kind as
[18:10] the scripture has said as he is so are
[18:15] we
[18:16] in this world praise god by the word of
[18:20] god making itself known we recognize
[18:24] that we are of that same god gene god
[18:28] quality god's attribute we come from god
[18:32] and we go to god by the great holy
[18:36] spirit of almighty god oh hallelujah
[18:40] glory to god listen what the scripture
[18:42] says amen
[18:44] therefore
[18:47] if any man be in christ
[18:51] he is a new creation praise god for the
[18:56] all things
[18:58] have passed away
[19:00] behold
[19:01] all things have become new amen or
[19:07] praise god so
[19:09] this old order this old man will pass
[19:13] away
[19:14] but the man inside the soul man
[19:18] is renewed day by day and he will never
[19:23] die but this old man will pass away that
[19:27] new creation will never pass away glory
[19:31] be to god for he created in union with
[19:35] jesus christ
[19:37] ephesians 4
[19:39] 24
[19:41] amen
[19:42] put on the new man put on jesus christ
[19:45] hallelujah
[19:47] amen and i thank god
[19:50] this new creation that is in me now by
[19:53] the word
[19:55] amen hallelujah is not of this old order
[20:00] of it is not carnal it is not of this
[20:03] old creation that will pass away
[20:07] hallelujah amen but placed or created in
[20:12] this body amen it it was placed here on
[20:16] the earth with god's divine purpose
[20:20] jesus had his purpose the prophets had
[20:23] their purpose the apostles had their
[20:25] purpose the members of god's bright body
[20:29] each one
[20:30] individually have their purpose for his
[20:33] glory and for his honor there may be
[20:37] despised decried they may be called
[20:40] names they may be laughed up they may be
[20:43] quietly chuckled at mock that scuff that
[20:46] not a word may be spoken but in your
[20:49] heart you you it's just a uh something
[20:52] to laugh about joke about chuckle about
[20:55] amen but friends back up all of that
[20:59] amen it's the new creation it's a brand
[21:02] new man god by his holy spirit moving in
[21:06] the human heart has done something that
[21:09] the world cannot see but the holy spirit
[21:13] has produced amen for his glory and
[21:16] honor amen glory to god thank god
[21:21] that god is no longer dealing
[21:25] with the ways of the flesh
[21:28] but god is dealing
[21:31] not with the old abraham
[21:33] he is now dealing with abraham's faith
[21:37] seed
[21:38] that had the quality
[21:41] of being able to receive
[21:44] revelation even when there was no
[21:48] written bible abraham received the
[21:51] revelation
[21:53] and his faith seed proves that they are
[21:56] right for his faith seed they identified
[21:59] i identified themselves as part of his
[22:02] faith seed by being able to catch the
[22:06] revelation of god's
[22:09] word hallelujah by
[22:12] inspiration hallelujah
[22:15] amen not just the written word but by
[22:19] inspiration you're able to catch it so
[22:22] god is dealing not with flesh anymore
[22:26] but now
[22:27] out of every kindred
[22:31] every race of people
[22:33] red yellow black white brown
[22:36] whatever color they might be out of all
[22:40] creation every tribe and every nation
[22:44] hallelujah god has purposed
[22:48] to have himself
[22:50] a new creation
[22:52] hallelujah and he is here saying
[22:56] i
[22:56] am the first
[23:00] one of that creation
[23:03] hallelujah why because he came from the
[23:06] realms of glory
[23:08] he is showing you the pattern
[23:11] of how
[23:12] every single elected seed will come to
[23:17] earth
[23:18] and just as jesus was placed
[23:21] to marry
[23:23] god by his spirit
[23:26] place every single elected seed
[23:30] to whichever
[23:32] parent
[23:33] he wanted them to be with and in and to
[23:37] pass through
[23:39] so they could be physically manifested
[23:42] on the scenes of earth to make
[23:46] manifest his glory honor and purpose in
[23:51] and through
[23:52] their lines hallelujah so he is the
[23:56] beginner
[23:58] the beginner
[24:00] the author
[24:02] the originator
[24:04] the first one to comfort of the
[24:08] of god himself coming into flesh
[24:11] in the form of jesus christ the fullness
[24:14] of the godhead bodily but now the
[24:17] individually individual attributes and
[24:21] genes of god
[24:23] because he has shown the pattern
[24:26] also come in flesh
[24:29] flesh that was what was placed here
[24:33] saying oh mary you will bear a son well
[24:36] an angel didn't come to your mom your
[24:38] father your dad but certainly by the
[24:41] purpose of god there were
[24:44] predestinated by him that there may be
[24:48] the originators
[24:49] there would be
[24:51] the
[24:52] uh there will be the vessels is the word
[24:55] i wanted to use there would be the
[24:57] vessels through whom you would pass
[24:59] through so that you could be here to
[25:02] glorify magnify and worship his great
[25:06] name and bring honor to our great
[25:10] eternal father blessing him in all
[25:13] things amen hallelujah
[25:16] praise god amen
[25:19] let me emphasize
[25:22] as spoken by our prophet in
[25:26] the rising of the sun
[25:28] he is the wave sheath
[25:32] the first one
[25:34] to come on this earth god manifested in
[25:37] the flesh
[25:39] hallelujah
[25:41] now his wife comes on the scene
[25:44] and where does she come from from out of
[25:47] himself
[25:49] the word
[25:50] and
[25:52] has been being formed over seven church
[25:56] ages
[25:58] and now we've come to the rest
[26:00] within this eighth day
[26:03] oh god
[26:06] building his own temple
[26:09] amen coming forth now
[26:12] o blessed be the name of the living god
[26:15] hallelujah
[26:16] amen so
[26:18] god
[26:20] literally created himself to be a part
[26:24] of his own creation thank god
[26:28] and this my friends
[26:32] in all simplicity
[26:34] is the true
[26:36] revelation of god
[26:39] god in heaven god on earth god and
[26:43] morphine himself
[26:46] from a single
[26:48] man
[26:50] god man and morphed
[26:54] transform changing
[26:56] himself
[26:58] into a bright form of a many-membered
[27:01] body
[27:02] manifested
[27:04] as he is says the scriptures
[27:08] so are we in this world
[27:12] and we are the same
[27:14] he is the great melchizedek
[27:17] we are priests
[27:19] after the same order
[27:22] or origination
[27:24] of that melchizedek we come from the
[27:28] same source
[27:29] we come from the same fountainhead
[27:33] we come from god and we're going back to
[27:35] god hallelujah amen yes sir
[27:40] god can look down through the ages
[27:44] hallelujah
[27:46] and
[27:47] all would be over
[27:49] and he still would see himself
[27:53] in the midst of his church
[27:57] as the author
[27:59] of the creation
[28:02] of god
[28:04] and it was
[28:06] his sovereign power
[28:08] that brought all of this great mystery
