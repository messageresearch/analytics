[46:39] then he's still going to be working amen
[46:41] praise God you know what we had
[46:44] uh uh some of our young people went down
[46:46] to uh a youth camp down in uh Michigan
[46:50] so glad to have them back and from what
[46:54] I understand is uh out of I don't know
[46:58] must have been 200 young people but it
[47:01] seemed
[47:02] like uh young Gabe here was the hit of
[47:05] the
[47:08] party everybody in Michigan believing W
[47:11] Believers wise knows who brother Gabe is
[47:15] now so we're glad that his influence
[47:18] went out and that he was a blessing to
[47:20] them down there I believe he was because
[47:22] you know sometimes you just got to
[47:23] loosen up a little bit right how many
[47:26] believe that you got to loosen up a
[47:27] little bit and and be free right
[47:30] absolutely and and that's uh that was
[47:31] their testimony but um right now we're
[47:35] we have uh is is uh is it confirmed
[47:38] brother coffee Adam the return of Adam
[47:42] is that is that
[47:45] confirmed I think it
[47:47] [Music]
[47:48] is so our African singers Adam are going
[47:52] to do something that's a little bit off
[47:53] the off the top right it's not they they
[47:56] didn't practice it a whole lot but you
[47:58] know since when do you got to practice
[48:00] being
[48:02] African doesn't make sense right so we
[48:04] know they're good and God bless them as
[48:06] they come but let thing he didn't bring
[48:08] us this far to leave us just the chorus
[48:10] of it we'll have them come and then

[55:03] songwriter uh he put it this way and and
[55:08] I want to sing this and I'll tell you
[55:10] why I want to sing this because one
[55:13] thing I've noticed over the
[55:15] years that
[55:18] probably 75% of the
[55:22] time if not more and I probably didn't
[55:26] sing it on purpose but we sang this song
[55:28] every time brother Danny would come to
[55:30] preach and I kept on noticing why is
[55:33] this song keep on coming up every time
[55:36] brother Danny come in and preach and now
[55:39] I know why because the song writer says
[55:42] how lovely on the mountains are are the
[55:46] feet of them who bring good news good
[55:51] news praise God you know who he's
[55:54] talking about don't you
[55:57] and the preachers and the ministers and
[55:59] the five-fold ministry and uh so let
[56:02] sing that brother Danny is going to come
[56:04] and give us a little bit of his
[56:06] testimony we know what's happening in a
[56:07] very short amount of time he's going to
[56:09] become become the pastor of Good
[56:11] Neighbor Ministries so we asked him if
[56:15] he thought it would be a good idea and
[56:16] he agreed to come and give a little bit
[56:19] more of his testimony does that sound
[56:21] all right with you in the meantime how
[56:24] lovely
[56:26] on the mountains are the feet of them
[56:32] who bring good
[56:34] news come on now oh good
[56:40] news announcing
[56:42] peace proclaiming news of
[56:48] Happiness our god
[56:52] reigns our god reigns everybody now oh
[56:57] Our God R come ahead brother
[57:00] Danny Our God
[57:03] [Music]
[57:09] R sing my god reigns oh my god
[57:16] reigns my
[57:20] God my
[57:22] [Music]

[57:30] amen praise God our god reigns amen he
[57:34] has reigned you may be seated for a
[57:37] little bit praise God
[57:41] um so um they asked me if it would be a
[57:46] good idea to give uh a short
[57:49] testimony and um just uh so what I'll do
[57:51] is I'll I'll just I gave this testimony
[57:55] um back in actually it was December
[58:00] 31st uh
[58:02] 200
[58:04] N exactly 14 years
[58:08] ago and um it's interesting because it's
[58:12] exactly the halfway point of my serving
[58:16] the lord to date by the grace of God and
[58:20] um I am just as
[58:23] zealous maybe not as
[58:25] wild as I was when I first came to the
[58:28] Lord but uh still very very zealous and
[58:31] still very thankful for the grace of God
[58:34] in my life and in my home amen so I'm
[58:38] gonna I'm gonna make it brief I'm GNA Go
[58:40] real quickly through some of the the
[58:43] background um and my desire tonight is
[58:46] truly to give the Lord Jesus all the
[58:48] glory through this
[58:51] testimony because it was his mighty hand
[58:53] and his work
[58:55] in my life um from from a very young age
[58:59] I realized that uh uh I was having
[59:02] certain experiences that I couldn't
[59:04] quite understand couldn't quite uh you
[59:07] know they would just be strange events
[59:09] that would happen while I was young but
[59:12] I was born in 1961 February of
[59:15] 61 as veto Dany
[59:18] mailli and as a child it was decided
[59:21] that I'd be called Danny using my second
[59:25] name and um I I guess the Lord had a
[59:28] purpose in that because we know that um
[59:31] there's something in the name right and
[59:34] so uh the Lord decided that uh that it
[59:37] would be Danny and it was something that
[59:39] came strong on my mother's heart that um
[59:42] I not be uh called veto but Dany and uh
[59:48] so that's that's how I got my name and
[59:51] um as a child I remember having
[59:55] uh strange moments of bliss I would just
[59:58] have these moments when I was you know
[1:00:01] young and all of a sudden I would feel
[1:00:03] such a Euphoria around my life and I
[1:00:06] couldn't quite understand what it was
[1:00:08] but I just I just felt so good I loved
[1:00:12] everything and then I realized that you
[1:00:14] know at some point as I started to get a
[1:00:17] little older and it would happen I would
[1:00:20] start to wonder why am I here why am I
[1:00:24] on this Earth You know and that was
[1:00:26] something that always stayed with me um
[1:00:29] from a young age and uh you know as time
[1:00:32] went on I came to realize that uh the
[1:00:36] Lord had a plan but I also remember some
[1:00:39] extreme moments of
[1:00:41] fear and I mean I would have nightmares
[1:00:46] after nightmare of of a presence around
[1:00:50] me at times that would just paralyze me
[1:00:54] and I realize now the difference between
[1:00:57] the two and and um you know one was you
[1:01:01] know that somebody was chasing after me
[1:01:03] and that was always going to kill me and
[1:01:06] come after me and kill me and and I used
[1:01:08] to have those dreams and I'd be running
[1:01:10] for my life running for my life and uh I
[1:01:13] realize that uh you know now as time has
[1:01:16] gone by I don't have those dreams
[1:01:18] anymore by the grace of God but I have
[1:01:21] the
[1:01:21] fights mentally and spiritually which
[1:01:24] you all know about which are the
[1:01:27] greatest battles that we will fight as
[1:01:29] we grow in the Lord but I was born in
[1:01:32] Toronto at Mount siai hospital I grew up
[1:01:35] in Scarboro till I was 16 years of age
[1:01:39] and then my family moved to miss
[1:01:41] Saga it was at this time when we moved
[1:01:44] to miss Saga that my life took a a very
[1:01:48] bad
[1:01:49] turn and you know it was all because of
[1:01:52] your you know like one thing I can say
[1:01:54] say young people is your peers and those
[1:01:57] that you hang around with um will have a
[1:02:00] definite influence on your life and it
[1:02:03] was at that time you know when I was 17
[1:02:05] 16 17 18 that I started to experiment
[1:02:08] with drugs and by the time I was 21 I
[1:02:12] was addicted and drugs was just a
[1:02:16] regular part of my life I got involved
[1:02:19] into a rock and roll band it was a
[1:02:21] professional band we used to play at you
[1:02:23] know V use all over Toronto and we'd be
[1:02:27] paid like you know thousands of dollars
[1:02:29] to play you know for a one night uh uh
[1:02:33] performance and along with that came all
[1:02:35] of the more of the drugs more of the
[1:02:38] drinking more of the you know the life
[1:02:41] that um that you know that Satan had a
[1:02:43] con absolute control over my life and
[1:02:47] you know um however that didn't stop me
[1:02:50] from working I always had this desire to
[1:02:54] be successful and that I would have my
[1:02:56] own business um and so I would you know
[1:03:00] work hard wherever I worked I would
[1:03:03] immediately you know grow in that work
[1:03:07] environment I'd get you know raises and
[1:03:11] then promotions and I ended up at a
[1:03:14] company um started working at a company
[1:03:17] when I was 17 years old the company was
[1:03:20] uh Caravan trailer
[1:03:22] rentals and um Caravan trailer rentals I
[1:03:26] worked there for about six
[1:03:27] years and um it was there that uh that I
[1:03:31] actually met my beautiful wife
[1:03:34] Jennifer um you know she had come to
[1:03:36] work at the company um and I was working
[1:03:41] in the rental office at the time I was
[1:03:43] 19 years old and the guys were telling
[1:03:46] me hey have you seen the new girl at the
[1:03:48] front there's a new receptionist she's
[1:03:51] beautiful you know I said oh I gota
[1:03:53] check her out out you
[1:03:56] know and so I went there and um you know
[1:03:59] I was going up and I remember this very
[1:04:02] very clearly because this was another
[1:04:05] event that took place that I realize now
[1:04:07] that it was God putting us together
[1:04:11] because I went up into the office and I
[1:04:13] remember it clearly I came up these
[1:04:15] stairs and I went to the reception and I
[1:04:17] was looking to see where she would be
[1:04:18] you know just nonchalantly and then she
[1:04:21] wasn't there and then I turned around
[1:04:24] around and she was filing some papers at
[1:04:27] a filing cabinet and then I looked over
[1:04:31] at her and she looked at me and I
[1:04:34] immediately had a flash like a light
[1:04:37] flash that just kind of struck me was
[1:04:40] kind of unusual but I just didn't really
[1:04:45] you know make anything out of it I
[1:04:47] thought maybe it was a sun or something
[1:04:49] that hit my eye or whatever but not
[1:04:52] realizing you know that that was my wife
[1:04:55] and that God was you know showing me
[1:04:58] that um that you know later on I didn't
[1:05:00] know then believe me I I had I only had
[1:05:04] you know a few things on my mind as a
[1:05:06] young man right and you know and uh you
[1:05:09] know we just want to go after the girls
[1:05:11] that are pretty
[1:05:13] right but anyways um time went on and uh
[1:05:18] our relationship started to
[1:05:20] develop uh the company was owned and
[1:05:23] operated by a a gentleman by the name of
[1:05:26] Gabriel
[1:05:27] alter okay he took a very strong liking
[1:05:30] to me and within a few years I was
[1:05:35] actually seated in the office next to
[1:05:37] him and I was the head P purchasing
[1:05:40] agent for the company buying millions of
[1:05:43] dollars of raw materials and I was only
[1:05:45] like 21 years old and I was making an
[1:05:48] income that was you know almost twice my
[1:05:51] dad's income he thought like what the
[1:05:54] the world is going on you know but that
[1:05:57] was just the grace of God and um you
[1:06:00] know that company did a lot in building
[1:06:04] a certain character a certain um
[1:06:08] attitude towards business and I believe
[1:06:11] you know God used a few people within
[1:06:13] that company to mold and shape me to um
[1:06:17] have the the kind of positive outlook
[1:06:19] and positive mental attitude that led me
[1:06:22] to be an entrepreneur and to be
[1:06:26] successful in business so there was good
[1:06:29] seeds planted there um and it was there
[1:06:32] that I met my Rebecca praise God because
[1:06:36] the company had three camels as their
[1:06:38] logo and uh it was owned by Gabriel
[1:06:41] alter and uh you know there's just you
[1:06:44] know certain things that we look back
[1:06:46] now and we realize you know strange but
[1:06:50] just the grace of God Amen but I was a
[1:06:54] real big risk taker and by the time I
[1:06:56] was 22 years old I had decided that I
[1:07:00] wanted to be on my own I wanted to have
[1:07:02] my own business I wanted to get out and
[1:07:04] I left the company and um uh went and
[1:07:08] started a cleaning business and while
[1:07:11] all of this is going on I want you to
[1:07:13] know that I had a drug addiction to
[1:07:16] cocaine okay and it was a Strong
[1:07:18] Addiction but yet I was able to function
[1:07:23] you know that drug is is a is a powerful
[1:07:25] drug and Satan used it to lure me in and
[1:07:31] you know I was still able to function I
[1:07:33] was still able to do business I felt
[1:07:35] Invincible at times when I was on it you
[1:07:37] know it was just the the the the effects
[1:07:40] of it but it gave you know it did
[1:07:42] certain things um and Satan was actually
[1:07:46] um trapping me because I thought I was
[1:07:49] in control of it at the time but let me
[1:07:52] tell you young people
[1:07:55] uh you're never in control when you're
[1:07:57] under the influence of
[1:08:00] drugs he is absolutely in control of
[1:08:03] your life to the point where by the time
[1:08:06] I was um you know just before I came to
[1:08:09] the Lord I was I was so addicted that
[1:08:12] you know I was um being pulled anytime
[1:08:15] he wanted me to to be on on the drugs he
[1:08:19] would take me to places to go and get it
[1:08:22] and you know Satan Made A Way that I had
[1:08:24] a friend who was a very close friend who
[1:08:27] was a dealer and he used to just give it
[1:08:29] to me you know and that was and that was
[1:08:32] even worse that's what made it even
[1:08:34] worse and you know um so it it was
[1:08:38] really all of this was all happening but
[1:08:41] yet I was in business for myself and
[1:08:44] within a couple of years of leaving
[1:08:46] caravan trailers I was
[1:08:49] broke and and uh but but I never gave up
[1:08:53] and and so I started another business
[1:08:56] and it was in
[1:08:57] 1985 that I started um in the fruit
[1:09:01] market
[1:09:02] business with a friend in
[1:09:04] Oakville and um uh within two years of
[1:09:09] that starting that Fruit Market
[1:09:12] business um and another store we were
[1:09:15] broke again and it was in 19 late
[1:09:20] 1986 when um we decided that the only
[1:09:24] thing that we could afford was a
[1:09:25] bankrupt business because we lost
[1:09:27] everything and so we went and took over
[1:09:30] fantasy Fruit Market which is the the
[1:09:32] one that we eventually had right up
[1:09:34] until now um in
[1:09:37] 1987 and we were able to build that
[1:09:39] business up and it started to become
[1:09:41] very successful and we started to do
[1:09:44] very well and by
[1:09:47] 1990 I was um in the real estate
[1:09:50] business building with two other
[1:09:52] partners we were building a $10 million
[1:09:55] townhouse
[1:09:57] complex and we were doing well I had a I
[1:10:00] had my own stretch limousine I had a
[1:10:04] Jaguar I had a
[1:10:06] $120,000 yacht parked up in Midland
[1:10:08] white Heritage Marina my wife and I and
[1:10:12] Christina when she was just a baby we
[1:10:14] would go boating into Georgian Bay and I
[1:10:17] was with you know multi-millionaires and
[1:10:20] I was moving at levels but all at the
[1:10:23] same time
[1:10:24] I was under the influence of this drug
[1:10:28] addiction and so it was in
[1:10:31] 1991 that the real estate market crashed
[1:10:35] and it was bad and we ended up losing
[1:10:41] everything I lost everything plus by the
[1:10:44] time all the smoke cleared I still owed
[1:10:47] about
[1:10:48] $600,000 in
[1:10:50] debt and so I
[1:10:52] remember very specifically we were in a
[1:10:55] rental home and Jennifer you got to
[1:10:58] understand something I protected her
[1:11:00] just unconsciously I protected her from
[1:11:03] all of this it was I kept so much out of
[1:11:08] her all she all I wanted her to do was
[1:11:11] just worry about taking care of
[1:11:13] Christina and by that time we had
[1:11:15] Michael in 1991 and I didn't want to
[1:11:18] tell her you know that that things were
[1:11:20] as bad as they really were but they were
[1:11:23] really bad and I remember I was sitting
[1:11:25] up in our bedroom um at a rental home in
[1:11:28] Miss Saga and uh I had just received
[1:11:31] another court order the lawsuit for
[1:11:36] people that we owed hundreds of
[1:11:37] thousands of dollars to that were suing
[1:11:39] us and I went up into my bedroom I never
[1:11:42] told her nothing I would just say yeah
[1:11:44] you know things are not going well but
[1:11:46] we're GNA we're going to be okay you
[1:11:49] know but I remember going up into my
[1:11:50] bedroom and I was sitting on my bed and
[1:11:53] I was actually contemplating how to
[1:11:57] commit
[1:11:59] suicide
[1:12:01] because I just didn't see a way
[1:12:03] out you know you can get so deep you
[1:12:07] know into despair at times that you just
[1:12:11] don't see a way out and I
[1:12:13] remember looking up and I said if
[1:12:17] there's a
[1:12:19] God I need
[1:12:22] you
[1:12:25] after
[1:12:27] that we still had fantasy Fruit markets
[1:12:30] but I went back because I had left
[1:12:32] fantasy Fruit markets kept a small
[1:12:34] ownership in it and had sold a portion
[1:12:36] to some partners and they had literally
[1:12:40] um destroyed the business it was going
[1:12:43] under so that was in despair I was in
[1:12:47] despair but I but it was the only thing
[1:12:49] that I had that I could go back to not
[1:12:52] realizing that it was at that time that
[1:12:54] God started to do things supernaturally
[1:12:57] in restoring my life and all I remember
[1:13:02] is putting my head down and doing and
[1:13:05] working and working and working doing
[1:13:07] whatever I had to do in order to keep
[1:13:10] food on the table I was negotiating
[1:13:12] deals with all the creditors I had
[1:13:15] negotiated deals the you know uh the
[1:13:18] finance companies would call they they
[1:13:19] said we're we're we're picking up your
[1:13:22] boat I said that's fine you know where
[1:13:24] it is go pick it up you know they they
[1:13:26] repossessed everything I had to sell the
[1:13:28] limousine you know for a cheap price
[1:13:31] just had to get rid of everything that I
[1:13:33] had just to survive and meanwhile God
[1:13:37] was working in in getting us back on our
[1:13:40] feet again and within about four years
[1:13:44] fantasy had really started to grow to
[1:13:47] the point where we were um uh expanded
[1:13:51] to two other locations
[1:13:54] actually we were at we were at two
[1:13:56] locations we had just gone from one to
[1:13:58] the second location um uh we still had
[1:14:02] just a single location when the Lord
[1:14:05] came into my life in
[1:14:06] 1994 and it was in 1996 that we went to
[1:14:10] the second and then the Third location
[1:14:13] in
[1:14:13] 1999 but God was restoring everything
[1:14:18] and it was at that time that you know
[1:14:21] while I was in the restoration stage um
[1:14:25] sister Jennifer and I had moved into a
[1:14:27] house in Miss Saga and I was going to
[1:14:29] buy furniture and it was at that time
[1:14:32] that I went to see brother Gabriel
[1:14:34] faretti and uh purchased some furniture
[1:14:37] from him uh he was a friend of my
[1:14:39] partner my partner's wife was in the
[1:14:41] interior decorating business and
[1:14:45] so uh he he was the person that she
[1:14:48] dealt with and and my partner said Dan
[1:14:49] if you need any furniture go and see
[1:14:52] this guy he'll take care of you he's a
[1:14:55] great Furniture maker so I went there
[1:14:57] and I bought all this furniture anyway
[1:14:59] long story short he gave me an
[1:15:01] incredible deal on furniture that I was
[1:15:04] shocked and I looked at him and I said I
[1:15:07] said this is incredible are you are you
[1:15:10] satisfied with this you know with this
[1:15:12] price he goes yeah yeah that's fine you
[1:15:15] know the way Gabriel is right he looks
[1:15:16] at me goes you a
[1:15:18] Christian I said uh I was brought up
[1:15:22] Roman Catholic I said um if that's
[1:15:25] Christianity then I'm a hypocrite I just
[1:15:28] told them because I knew I would go to
[1:15:30] church on Sunday and I would be a devil
[1:15:33] on Saturday night and you know so it was
[1:15:36] all hypocritical and and I knew it but
[1:15:39] you know he he said so I said to him I
[1:15:41] said and he looks at me he goes yeah
[1:15:42] that's good he says here listen to this
[1:15:46] tape take it so I took it and you know
[1:15:50] while I was at gab's place there I
[1:15:52] noticed that there was some people there
[1:15:54] I didn't know who it was I realized now
[1:15:55] it was brother Tim and and I believe
[1:15:57] brother Vishnu was there at the time and
[1:15:59] I heard I heard like God bless you or
[1:16:02] God something and you know I it just
[1:16:05] caught my attention but it didn't really
[1:16:07] I was chasing Michael because he was
[1:16:09] running around in the showroom and um
[1:16:12] and so that's just a side note of
[1:16:14] something that was there at the time
[1:16:16] that I that I recall but um anyways I
[1:16:19] listened to the tape sister Jennifer and
[1:16:21] I listened to it on the way home it was
[1:16:22] brother brandom preaching on uh the
[1:16:26] Hebrew series on uh Paul being knocked
[1:16:29] off his high
[1:16:30] horse and you know I'm listening to that
[1:16:34] and I'm and uh but I didn't I couldn't
[1:16:37] understand what it was but something was
[1:16:39] striking my soul that was speaking to me
[1:16:42] out of this tape that I couldn't quite
[1:16:44] understand so by the time I got home I
[1:16:46] realized that I'd left my sunglasses at
[1:16:49] the donnut shop just down the street
[1:16:51] from Gabriel's so I phoned Gabriel just
[1:16:53] as we arrived home in this 45 minute
[1:16:56] drive I said and I called him I said
[1:16:58] Gabriel I got to come back there I left
[1:17:00] my sunglasses at a doughnut shop I said
[1:17:02] but do you have any more
[1:17:04] tapes he says yeah yeah yeah so I went
[1:17:07] there and he gives me a whole box full
[1:17:10] of tapes and there're the old brother
[1:17:12] brandham you know the cassette tapes and
[1:17:14] I listen to those tapes every single day
[1:17:19] for about 3 four months and every now
[1:17:22] and then Gabriel would call me you know
[1:17:24] and he would say Dan he says uh I go
[1:17:27] right by you sometime you want to come
[1:17:28] to church I said when you go to church
[1:17:31] he goes I go Tuesday I go Thursday and I
[1:17:33] go uh Sunday I go
[1:17:36] what three times a
[1:17:38] week and then I thought in my mind I
[1:17:41] said no no I'm not going I said what is
[1:17:44] this you know and I said well maybe
[1:17:46] sometime gab maybe sometime you know
[1:17:49] okay and then he you know a few months
[1:17:51] with another month or so and and stuff
[1:17:53] and then we're talk and then I call him
[1:17:55] sometimes and about the T and then he
[1:17:57] call me again he goes I'm going right by
[1:17:59] your place tonight you want me to pick
[1:18:01] you up I can pick you up right there
[1:18:03] miss Saga Road at the Tim Hortons so he
[1:18:05] pulls in there I said okay I'm coming I
[1:18:07] said okay I gotta go I let me go and see
[1:18:11] so Gabriel pulls in at the Tim Hortons
[1:18:13] he pulls in a van he had about 12 people
[1:18:15] in the van it was Filipinos Africans uh
[1:18:20] all these different I got into the front
[1:18:22] seat and I looked back and I
[1:18:25] thought oh my God what am I doing
[1:18:29] here and and uh so anyways long story
[1:18:33] short he took us to the service and it
[1:18:36] was at the Little White Church in Winona
[1:18:39] and Pastor Simon stepped out you know
[1:18:42] there was uh about 50 to 60 people all
[1:18:45] worshiping I've never seen anybody
[1:18:47] worship like this people worshiping the
[1:18:50] Lord Pastor Simon stepped out and he
[1:18:53] preached a message that night and it was
[1:18:55] on the woman at the well and while he
[1:18:58] was preaching that message talking about
[1:19:01] that prostitute's life my whole life was
[1:19:05] flashing by and I realized that that he
[1:19:09] was talking to me that I was I was that
[1:19:12] individual and something Supernatural
[1:19:15] happened that night because I was
[1:19:17] weeping and crying I'm trying to hide my
[1:19:19] my face from Gabriel and you know like I
[1:19:22] just I felt you know just overwhelmed by
[1:19:26] what was being preached and that was the
[1:19:29] start of you know coming to the Good
[1:19:31] Neighbor or to at that time it was
[1:19:33] Eagles crime Ministries I had no idea
[1:19:36] that a man that was 5
[1:19:38] foot4 could pack that kind of power and
[1:19:42] anointing that was speaking to my heart
[1:19:45] like that and so it was there that the
[1:19:48] Lord really spoke to me I started to
[1:19:50] attend the churches I came to get
[1:19:53] baptized um in
[1:19:56] 1994 and um uh you
[1:20:00] know it just it just went from there I
[1:20:04] don't want to really uh you know I can't
[1:20:06] really go much further than that here I
[1:20:07] am now today after 29 years um I'm
[1:20:12] excited about the Lord I'm excited about
[1:20:15] the word why because he's a supernatural
[1:20:18] God he did so much Supernatural I mean
[1:20:21] it would take me out hours to give you
[1:20:24] the testimonies of the supernatural that
[1:20:26] took place in my home in my wife her
[1:20:30] testimony and how the Lord delivered her
[1:20:33] it was Supernatural I realized at the
[1:20:36] time that God had called me I was crying
[1:20:38] out I said Lord you got to call my wife
[1:20:42] how in the world because our marriage
[1:20:43] was going opposite ways at the time I
[1:20:46] remember I would come home from church
[1:20:49] you know and I'd be praying for my wife
[1:20:52] that the Lord would somehow open the
[1:20:54] understanding to her to make her see
[1:20:55] this I remember you know I'd come home
[1:20:58] from work and she'd be going out with
[1:21:00] her girlfriends you know and I'd be
[1:21:02] going you know to church and she'd be
[1:21:04] going out with her girlfriends you know
[1:21:05] and I remember one night I called
[1:21:07] brother Mike and I said brother I said
[1:21:11] can you please pray for my wife she's
[1:21:14] going to a
[1:21:15] bar you know
[1:21:18] and supernaturally I'll tell you she
[1:21:22] came home early that night she was
[1:21:26] petrified of of an experience that she
[1:21:28] had at that bar of of demons that that
[1:21:32] that that she never went back again and
[1:21:35] I remember that so well and it was at
[1:21:37] that time that she said I'm coming to
[1:21:41] church and it was at that time that uh
[1:21:44] you know she came to hear Pastor Simon
[1:21:46] and she heard some tapes before and she
[1:21:48] says wow he's got a sense of humor uh
[1:21:51] you know I I I'll come I'll come and uh
[1:21:55] did uh did he have a sense of humor yeah
[1:22:00] he sure
[1:22:01] did and he
[1:22:03] called my wife and I and our family by
[1:22:06] the grace of God to this message that
