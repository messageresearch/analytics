[45:04] thank god
[45:05] for his goodness
[45:09] we've all come through
[45:11] a real traumatic year
[45:14] and
[45:16] this covet culture seems to have set in
[45:19] on the entire world
[45:22] and it's transformed and changed
[45:25] um society and even changed individuals
[45:30] in the way of acting and thinking
[45:32] and we know that god is moving into
[45:36] another phase of his entire plan
[45:39] and we are just happy to be a part of
[45:41] what he is doing
[45:43] as long as we keep our mind our hearts
[45:46] in the word of god we know we'll be in
[45:48] our rightful position
[45:51] to bring glory and honor and praise his
[45:55] name
[45:56] we want to thank you very much
[45:58] for all the various um
[46:02] gifts and thoughts
[46:04] towards myself and wife for pastor
[46:06] appreciation
[46:08] i have to be honest with you
[46:11] i got
[46:12] home since
[46:15] that took place
[46:17] and i went home with one briefcase
[46:20] and i was so tired i put it down there
[46:23] and fell asleep in our chest of field
[46:28] and
[46:29] from then i've been using another
[46:31] briefcase
[46:36] and i did not go back to that original
[46:39] briefcase until i believe last week
[46:43] then i said oh my goodness
[46:46] oh so i want to thank you all for
[46:50] everything that you did
[46:52] for us and i want to give god the glory
[46:54] and praise
[46:56] amen
[46:58] also
[46:59] now here we are at this time
[47:02] of the year
[47:04] and i don't want you to get into a
[47:09] christmas spirit
[47:12] i don't want you to get into the church
[47:14] spirit
[47:15] uh i don't want you to get into the
[47:18] commercial spirit
[47:20] that gets you all caught up in the hype
[47:22] on the holly and the mistletoe and all
[47:26] that type of thing right and the jingle
[47:29] bells and dashing through the snow
[47:32] well
[47:34] these things are there
[47:36] there's no doubt about it
[47:38] the trees are there the christmas trees
[47:40] are there these things that they aaron
[47:42] it's wonderful you know the devil made
[47:45] an airplane and that will make all this
[47:47] stuff through science and god shows his
[47:50] servants how to use it
[47:52] because they turn around and use the
[47:53] airplane to go spread the god spell
[47:56] so now he's gone to rocket ship you know
[47:58] we'll see what else is going to happen
[48:00] but anyway
[48:02] whatever is there
[48:04] that they create and they call it
[48:06] christmas
[48:07] well we use it and we give god glory and
[48:10] praise
[48:11] um
[48:12] we don't curse it and cheer it down
[48:14] anything like that but we recognize it's
[48:17] wrong it's not according to the word
[48:20] but we still enjoy the season and the
[48:23] time
[48:23] because we know
[48:25] what it represents or who it represents
[48:28] in reality
[48:30] so here we find ourselves in the midst
[48:34] of a changing world
[48:36] and we remaining
[48:39] as the word unchanged
[48:42] and holding to god's unchanging hand
[48:45] praise the lord
[48:46] god bless every one of you
[48:49] thank you so much for your contributions
[48:52] much more can be said but my mind keeps
[48:54] going back to the word here now so but
[48:57] let's get to the word of god is that
[48:59] okay
[49:02] i think some of you are going to be uh
[49:05] leaving
[49:06] um
[49:07] during these holidays we're going to
[49:09] miss some of you
[49:10] and we pray that god will keep you
[49:13] safely take you safely bring you back
[49:15] again safely wherever you are
[49:18] or you may be right in town but you may
[49:20] be occupied with your family and things
[49:23] like that you know everything is
[49:25] tightened up now because of the
[49:28] latest variant of the virus
[49:31] and therefore they've tightened things
[49:33] up
[49:34] outside of churches
[49:37] it's down to 10
[49:39] people
[49:40] but so far
[49:42] they've allowed and are allowing
[49:44] churches to go at 50
[49:47] right so uh let's thank and trust god
[49:51] for whatever god is doing
[49:54] and
[49:55] don't
[49:56] uh again let me repeat
[49:58] my stand on the word
[50:01] don't listen to silly people
[50:04] who tell you
[50:06] they don't need to take the vaccines
[50:11] it is absolute
[50:13] ignorance
[50:15] nonsense
[50:17] and try to use the word of god to
[50:20] justify it
[50:21] saying that they have faith so they
[50:24] don't need to take it
[50:27] well
[50:28] you you're gonna have to dismiss a whole
[50:30] lot of scriptures i won't get into that
[50:32] now but you're gonna have to dismiss
[50:34] miss a lot of scriptures and get away
[50:37] from it by just saying oh i believe i
[50:39] believe
[50:40] don't worry with them even if you happen
[50:42] to be in the minority stay with the word
[50:45] stay in the house
[50:48] don't come out
[50:49] stay right there don't let that angel
[50:52] pass your way but stay inside of the
[50:55] house praise the lord may the lord bless
[50:58] you stay with your family enjoy your
[51:00] family
[51:02] and
[51:03] if you're used to being
[51:05] um
[51:06] with prayer like a person who is used to
[51:09] being alone with god and in prayer
[51:12] um you'll find that
[51:15] it doesn't make much difference much to
[51:17] them but those who are used to jumping
[51:20] around and running here running there
[51:22] running all the time and not a god
[51:25] having a chance to settle them down then
[51:28] you have a problem you'll have a problem
[51:30] in your spirit praise the lord however
[51:33] today i want to talk
[51:35] much not just about see people are
[51:38] looking at the birth of christ and
[51:41] they're looking back at jesus back there
[51:45] they don't realize that what we should
[51:48] be for god has allotted his word to each
[51:51] age
[51:52] there's a certain amount of the word has
[51:54] to be fulfilled in each age
[51:58] and this is the day when the son of man
[52:02] is being revealed again
[52:05] in the bright form
[52:07] so
[52:08] whose birth is it
[52:11] the one back there
[52:14] or hers
[52:17] which is really him revealed
[52:21] so we are celebrating that birth
[52:24] and especially because we are a part of
[52:27] that
[52:29] amen
[52:30] inside of this word of god part of him
[52:34] and here he is again according to his
[52:36] word
[52:37] that it would come to pass let's look in
[52:39] the book of hebrews chapter 11 we want
[52:42] to read verse 3
[52:44] and we'll start from there praise the
[52:47] lord
[52:48] amen
[52:50] and let's have a real wonderful
[52:52] christmas time
[53:02] let us pray
[53:04] our gracious father we thank you for the
[53:07] uh by open bible we thank you for the
[53:09] reading of the word and we do pray
[53:12] father that the great holy spirit will
[53:16] anoint our hearts together and bless us
[53:21] as a family of gods sons and daughters
[53:24] of god rejoicing together not in heaven
[53:27] but in heavenly places in christ giving
[53:30] you glory as we did before the
[53:33] foundation of the world
[53:35] go father now we submit and surrender
[53:38] ourselves to you in jesus name amen
[53:45] true faith
[53:47] we understand
[53:50] that the worlds were framed
[53:53] by the word of
[53:54] god so that things which are seen
[53:59] were not made
[54:01] of things which
[54:03] do appear praise the lord thank you lord
[54:06] for the reading of the word god bless
[54:08] you all please be seated
[54:14] by faith by revelation by faith we
[54:17] understand
[54:19] that the worlds were framed
[54:22] by the word of god
[54:26] amen
[54:28] now we understand that when god made or
[54:32] created
[54:33] the earth
[54:35] uh this world the world let's use the
[54:38] world not earth because the earth is
[54:40] only part of god's world that he created
[54:45] and that world is made up of many
[54:47] universes galaxies suns moons stars
[54:53] endless layers and of various dimensions
[54:57] and
[54:58] so on that we are not even fully aware
[55:00] of the enormity of even the natural
[55:03] creation but the world was formed by the
[55:08] spoken word
[55:10] of god
[55:12] amen
[55:13] and we find out that the manifestation
[55:17] of god's
[55:19] word
[55:20] when god said
[55:22] let there be light
[55:24] and the bible says and there
[55:27] was light
[55:29] now light was a mystery
[55:32] because when god said let there be light
[55:36] if there was if there was anybody there
[55:38] where there was none
[55:40] uh they wouldn't know what light was
[55:43] light would be a mystery to them
[55:46] but when the light appears in the sky or
[55:51] wherever when they see this bright
[55:54] object
[55:55] they didn't have to ask what is light
[55:59] you see for the manifestation
[56:02] what
[56:03] is the interpretation
[56:05] amen that's what it is hallelujah now i
[56:09] want to go to brother
[56:12] branham's quotes here
[56:14] god is his own interpreter you know how
[56:17] many believes that
[56:19] amen see that's why paul said the word
[56:22] is of no private interpretation
[56:25] you see amen you see when god said let
[56:29] there be light there was light
[56:32] that was the interpretation of it
[56:35] amen see
[56:37] for the manifestation it was manifested
[56:41] and the manifestation
[56:43] is the interpretation it brings
[56:45] understanding so you will know what
[56:49] light is see
[56:51] when he said that
[56:53] it was in his mind before he said it
[56:56] see
[56:57] before he could say it it was in his
[57:00] mind it was in his thinking
[57:03] that there was such a thing as light
[57:06] and then he spoke it
[57:09] let there be light and the light sprung
[57:12] up across the skies
[57:15] that
[57:16] is the interpretation
[57:18] nobody has to
[57:20] give any interpretation of that because
[57:23] god has already given the interpretation
[57:27] and when god speaks
[57:30] it's manifested
[57:32] god makes a promise
[57:34] god unlocks his word or promises to each
[57:39] age
[57:40] and it comes down
[57:42] through the ages from beginning to end
[57:46] so much poor age so much for age and it
[57:49] keeps coming down see
[57:52] and the world has got these things mixed
[57:55] up
[57:56] and they have done it with all their
[57:58] traditions
[58:00] and mixed it up with so forth like that
[58:04] hallelujah and now we see this christmas
[58:07] season
[58:08] is all mixed up with traditions
[58:12] mixed up with satan's claws
[58:14] and mixed up with all kinds of uh uh
[58:20] old nick and uh mixed up with the tenon
[58:25] bomb and trees which the bible tells you
[58:29] in the bible there not to go out in the
[58:31] forest and cut them and nail them up so
[58:33] they can stand up and stuff like that in
[58:35] the book of jeremiah you'll find that
[58:37] right there where it tells you that but
[58:40] we are here like as i said
[58:42] not to celebrate the birth of jesus
[58:46] christ
[58:47] back there 1900 years ago
[58:50] but really with the clear understanding
[58:54] of the revelation of god's word
[58:58] she being a part of him
[59:01] and the head already having its birth
[59:05] there
[59:06] now
[59:07] it's her birth which is really
[59:10] the son of man being revealed again
[59:14] in this day and in this hour
[59:17] praise god
[59:19] hallelujah now just to give you some
[59:22] more
[59:22] background on that so we'll bring a
[59:24] clearer understanding
[59:26] god had spoken his word
[59:29] and told law he said
[59:32] it's not going to rain
[59:35] you've heard this before nobody knew
[59:37] what rain was
[59:39] there was no rain anywhere no such a
[59:41] thing as rain they had no idea so god's
[59:44] word was spoken through the mouth of a
[59:47] prophet
[59:48] hallelujah matter of fact there are
[59:50] certain parts in the bible where it
[59:52] calls the spoken word of a prophet for
[59:55] the mouth of the lord has spoken it amen
[59:59] right the prophet is counted like god's
[1:00:01] mouth
[1:00:02] all right speaking the word
[1:00:05] hallelujah so
[1:00:08] noah says
[1:00:09] reign praise god and they were all
[1:00:13] looking for whatever this rain was
[1:00:16] but
[1:00:17] they didn't believe law
[1:00:19] they didn't understand what he was
[1:00:21] saying
[1:00:22] they were misdefined by him talking
[1:00:24] about reign
[1:00:26] so
[1:00:27] when they rejected his word
[1:00:29] and the reigns began to fall it was too
[1:00:32] late
[1:00:33] because by then
[1:00:35] not just noah understood amen but
[1:00:39] everybody knew now what rain was
[1:00:42] but it was too late
[1:00:44] because the rain was already on the
[1:00:46] scene
[1:00:47] hallelujah and the manifestation of what
[1:00:50] was written was the interpretation of
[1:00:53] god's spoken word through that prophet
[1:00:55] noah
[1:00:57] amen hallelujah that's the way it was
[1:01:01] in the same way
[1:01:03] god spoke through the prophet isaiah
[1:01:06] and he said a virgin will conceive and
[1:01:10] bear a sound hallelujah
[1:01:13] praise god
[1:01:14] and
[1:01:15] when he spoke
[1:01:17] we know the scripture quoting is of no
[1:01:21] private
[1:01:22] interpretation when god said a virgin
[1:01:25] shall conceive and she did that just
[1:01:29] settles it right there
[1:01:31] see
[1:01:32] god himself is the one that does the
[1:01:36] interpretation
[1:01:38] many people may love him
[1:01:40] many people may even believe in him
[1:01:44] but yet
[1:01:46] when he speaks it's so much a phenomena
[1:01:50] that can't understand
[1:01:52] it when you talk about it
[1:01:54] see
[1:01:55] and being just the same
[1:01:58] as he was yesterday
[1:02:01] they couldn't understand him then they
[1:02:03] can't understand him now they claim they
[1:02:06] believe it but when it takes place right
[1:02:09] before them they don't understand it
[1:02:13] amen they can't believe it but it's the
[1:02:16] same thing happening happening again you
[1:02:18] understand
[1:02:20] one place here he says it's the same
[1:02:22] jesus christ yesterday today and forever
[1:02:27] hallelujah and the word making itself
[1:02:30] manifested so much to each age as it
[1:02:34] comes down
[1:02:35] hallelujah you see god has promised
[1:02:38] certain things for even this age that we
[1:02:42] are in
[1:02:43] and it has got to come to pass
[1:02:47] and what it does
[1:02:48] you don't need no interpretation for it
[1:02:52] you know you see the theologians are out
[1:02:54] all these seminaries are out you don't
[1:02:56] need that to get god's interpretation of
[1:03:00] what he's going to say or saying in his
[1:03:03] word for it is not of any private
[1:03:07] interpretation hallelujah praise god
[1:03:10] hallelujah when the bible tells us
[1:03:13] clearly your king is going to come
[1:03:16] writing on a quote the fall of an ass
[1:03:18] and then jesus comes writing in and they
[1:03:21] say who is this
[1:03:23] you know
[1:03:24] but those who were elected the moment
[1:03:27] they saw that they caught him that's
[1:03:30] what we're talking about revelation the
[1:03:32] moment they see him riding in they begin
[1:03:36] to shout out zamla hosanna and they
[1:03:40] welcome the word of god on the scene
[1:03:44] amen even if it doesn't come on a donkey
[1:03:48] like it did back there but it comes back
[1:03:51] to you in word form you're still saying
[1:03:54] amen hosanna yes it is he that cometh in
[1:03:58] the name of the lord because you
[1:04:01] recognize it hallelujah
[1:04:03] amen praise god
[1:04:06] god spoke it his name shall be called
[1:04:08] wonderful counselor mighty god
[1:04:11] everlasting
[1:04:12] father the prince of peace and then
[1:04:15] jesus is born and he comes on the scene
[1:04:19] and we understand his work is the
[1:04:23] interpretation of the word of god
[1:04:27] hallelujah
[1:04:28] amen so
[1:04:30] we understand it clearly here now i want
[1:04:33] you to see here
[1:04:35] i'm going to get to the heart of it
[1:04:38] i can go through there are more coats
[1:04:40] here but brother branham speaking here
[1:04:44] he talks about jesus having triples
[1:04:48] and he said
[1:04:50] i have triples
[1:04:53] and he says every minister has three
[1:04:55] pulls
[1:04:56] in their ministry
[1:04:59] but at this point he specifically
[1:05:02] began to emphasize how that he came
[1:05:05] through the healing
[1:05:06] then he came through prophesying
[1:05:09] popular when you're when the healing is
[1:05:11] going on
[1:05:12] unpopular when you start to prophesy
[1:05:15] teaching and doctrine of the word of god
[1:05:18] because a lot of them believe that
[1:05:20] prophesying
[1:05:21] is foretelling
[1:05:24] they don't understand that prophesying
[1:05:26] is also telling forth
[1:05:29] the word of god
[1:05:31] right so they're looking for somebody to
[1:05:33] prophesy and tell the future all the
[1:05:36] time not seeing that the restoration of
[1:05:38] the word comes back to
[1:05:41] tell forth the doctrines and the truths
[1:05:45] that were lost and were scattered
[1:05:48] throughout the ages amen praise god
[1:05:52] hallelujah now back to this pose then he
[1:05:55] came to the point where he began to
[1:05:58] emphasize the third poll
[1:06:02] and the uh main point of the turtle is
[1:06:06] creation
[1:06:08] is that right
[1:06:09] by the spoken word
[1:06:12] the spoken word creation taken place by
[1:06:17] the spoken word of the living god
[1:06:20] hallelujah amen
[1:06:23] and you know how the experience with
[1:06:26] sister hattie wright
[1:06:29] and how when god used him to speak the
[1:06:32] word and tree squirrel and the squirrels
[1:06:34] appeared
[1:06:35] and he shot them to show that they were
[1:06:38] real
[1:06:39] amen
[1:06:40] and we know
[1:06:42] he talked about the manifestation of
[1:06:45] that but in actual fact do you
[1:06:48] recognize and understand this is what he
[1:06:52] was pointing to
[1:06:54] that the bride
[1:06:56] would come forth
[1:06:58] by god's what spoken word
[1:07:02] like how he could speak
[1:07:05] he
[1:07:05] a man a prophet speaking the word
[1:07:09] who squirrels were created by the spoken
[1:07:13] word
[1:07:14] through the mouth of the prophet
[1:07:16] and god is strengthened to us through
[1:07:19] that
[1:07:20] that he who spoke in the beginning
[1:07:23] before anything was and said let there
[1:07:27] be light
[1:07:28] that same god said let there be a bride
[1:07:33] let there be a bride let there be a
[1:07:36] people that are a bride amen and that
[1:07:39] has to come to pass
[1:07:42] that has to come to pass
[1:07:45] amen and when she appears on the scene
[1:07:49] when she appears and is right there in
[1:07:52] front of them the manifestation is the
[1:07:55] interpretation praise god there's
[1:07:58] nothing they have to do say or explain
[1:08:01] because they themselves become the
[1:08:04] interpretation of the word of god from
[1:08:07] the hour that they are living in for the
[1:08:10] word of god is allotted to every age a
[1:08:14] portion to every age
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:19] do you understand
[1:08:21] the bible was saying
[1:08:23] malachi 4 5 i will send unto you elijah
[1:08:28] the prophet
[1:08:29] amen and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:08:31] church of the fathers fathers to the
[1:08:33] children amen let's let's smite the
[1:08:35] earth with a cross
[1:08:37] curse revelation 10 1-7 it tells you how
[1:08:41] he's going to send the seventh angel
[1:08:44] and the seventh angel will come and open
[1:08:48] up all of the mystery of god that was to
[1:08:51] be known in these days there is no more
[1:08:54] last days we are in those days right now
[1:08:58] and that seven angels will do it in
[1:09:00] these last days hallelujah amen when
[1:09:05] brother branham appeared on the scene
[1:09:07] started off with his ministry and the
[1:09:10] war began to flow through him spiritual
[1:09:13] elected people those who are elected
[1:09:17] began to recognize that is the
[1:09:20] fulfillment of malachi 4 5 just like
[1:09:24] they let in the book of matthew
[1:09:27] recognize that is the interpretation of
[1:09:30] our king coming sitting on an ass as
[1:09:34] quote the fall of an ass i thank god we
[1:09:37] have recognized what god has done
[1:09:41] i want to thank god that we recognize
[1:09:44] what god has done and is doing in our
[1:09:47] day and in our age blessed be the name
[1:09:50] of god of our god
[1:09:53] if he can speak he was trying to get you
[1:09:55] to see if he can make a man speak
[1:09:58] squirrel into existence can he speak his
[1:10:01] bride into existence
[1:10:04] his entire bride
[1:10:06] and uh like brother branham said
[1:10:08] concerning light for him to speak that
[1:10:11] thing in existence it means that he had
[1:10:14] the light had to be in his mind before
[1:10:17] the foundation of the world so then he
[1:10:20] could speak what is it was in his mind
[1:10:23] he spoke what in his mind and it was
[1:10:26] done lord of god and if you were in the
[1:10:29] mind of god if you're elected and you
[1:10:32] are in his mind his thoughts and god
[1:10:35] spoke the word in this last day and you
[1:10:38] appear on the scene by believing his
[1:10:41] word that you become what the
[1:10:43] manifestation
[1:10:45] of the word of god for this hour
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:51] praise be to god hallelujah amen see
[1:10:56] that's where it is
[1:10:58] the word god speaking his own word out
[1:11:02] and taking the word for that age
[1:11:06] life
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:09] the word for that is life and giving
[1:11:14] interpretation of it back then it was
[1:11:17] god in christ
[1:11:19] what is it today
[1:11:21] god in the pride
[1:11:23] interpreting his own word
[1:11:25] bringing his own word to pass because
[1:11:28] christ is the word and whenever that
[1:11:32] word is made manifest wherever it is it

[1:11:38] in every age amen hallelujah christ
[1:11:42] making himself manifest oh
[1:11:46] how could we apply that to this day oh
[1:11:49] when the holy ghost comes they lean on
[1:11:53] their own understanding
[1:11:57] and they cannot see it
[1:11:59] amen and they think that is not the word
[1:12:03] of the lord amen but the
[1:12:06] identification of it the age in which it
[1:12:09] is
[1:12:10] god's is his own interpretation and the
[1:12:14] interpretation
[1:12:15] is the manifestation of the promise lord

[1:12:21] it brother sister

[1:12:55] real let me shoot one issue and there's
[1:12:58] the blood and everything else he shoots
[1:12:59] another shoots another and then he took
[1:13:01] them home cooked them and at them to
[1:13:04] show that they were real and so he's
[1:13:07] what he's really saying there is that
[1:13:10] his spoken word produced a living
[1:13:13] present day manifestation
[1:13:16] of the word of god right in front of him
[1:13:19] amen and god is by that was letting you
[1:13:22] know

[1:13:29] living manifestation of the word of god
[1:13:33] hallelujah and the bride is that
[1:13:36] manifestation of the word of god
[1:13:39] hallelujah praise god forevermore amen
[1:13:43] the coming of a bride
[1:13:45] amen
[1:13:46] who am i in this age
[1:13:49] you are living manifestations of this
[1:13:51] message you know
[1:13:53] hallelujah
[1:13:55] you and i
[1:13:57] are the
[1:13:58] manifestation of the prophet's word
[1:14:05] the prophet's words that were spoken
[1:14:08] always talking about the bride prank
[1:14:10] coming son of man being revealed
[1:14:12] hallelujah and you and i by believing
[1:14:16] and receiving the word are the present
[1:14:19] day living manifestation of the word of
[1:14:22] god hallelujah
[1:14:24] look i'm not talking about creation back
[1:14:27] there
[1:14:28] because you're gonna find here
[1:14:31] matter of fact uh
[1:14:32] where where will i find that amen notice
[1:14:36] when he did that creation
[1:14:39] then
[1:14:41] later on
[1:14:42] he went to make water into wine
[1:14:46] he took water first
[1:14:49] as a an already created substance
[1:14:53] and turned it into wine
[1:14:56] and fed 5 000 people
[1:14:59] then he took fish
[1:15:01] that was one swimming in the water
[1:15:03] somewhere
[1:15:04] broke it handed out
[1:15:06] multiplied it was a multiplied creation
[1:15:10] he took bread
[1:15:12] hallelujah that was baked in an oven
[1:15:15] broke it and so on handed it out to the
[1:15:18] people and it returned back notice i
[1:15:20] repeat it was a multiplied creation
[1:15:26] but now
[1:15:27] in these last days
[1:15:30] there is no sign
[1:15:32] of that kind of a creation
[1:15:35] for this
[1:15:37] he speaks this into creation
[1:15:40] hallelujah in other words this spoken
[1:15:44] word again is original seed
[1:15:46] he's not going to need nothing that he's
[1:15:49] got to pick up anywhere to multiply it
[1:15:51] but he speak his bride into existence by
[1:15:55] the spoken word amen and shows it to be
[1:15:59] the same god
[1:16:00] that created in the beginning with
[1:16:04] nothing but the spoken word
[1:16:06] hallelujah the same god with that spoken
[1:16:10] word can create squirrels
[1:16:13] he can create whatever he wants because
[1:16:16] he is god hallelujah and the word is
[1:16:20] infallible and it has to be manifested
[1:16:24] and fulfilled so god creates the bride
[1:16:27] in this end time of the world again but
[1:16:31] by this spoken word
[1:16:34] clean clear just by the spoken word you
[1:16:39] remember i'm continuing the same quote
[1:16:42] that is from shalom
[1:16:45] he says remember seventh is the finish
[1:16:48] could this be the finish it's over now
[1:16:51] amen seven is always the finish three
[1:16:55] polls jesus ministry three polls oh my
[1:16:59] notice that carefully how it was three
[1:17:02] poles oh my then we see here that
[1:17:06] they're still doubting it
[1:17:09] he was here they doubted him that he was
[1:17:14] the manifestation
[1:17:16] of moses prophecy
[1:17:19] when he said i
[1:17:21] am the prophet that moses spoke of
[1:17:24] and when he told them that that
[1:17:27] how they were living in things he became
[1:17:29] unpopular they didn't want to hear it
[1:17:32] they called him the altibul
[1:17:35] do you realize
[1:17:37] that those same spirits
[1:17:40] are living in the same kinds of people
[1:17:44] in
[1:17:45] condemned people
[1:17:48] that can never be saved
[1:17:50] because they were condemned before
[1:17:53] just like judas has carried
[1:17:56] born son of tradition
[1:17:58] amen
[1:17:59] he was very religious
[1:18:02] but remember
[1:18:04] in that day he could not go all the way
[1:18:09] and he got it here
[1:18:10] with the message
[1:18:14] he couldn't go all the way
[1:18:17] with the message now what he's really
[1:18:20] saying there just like when jesus was
[1:18:23] back there in that body fulfilling
[1:18:26] uh the word of
[1:18:29] moses
[1:18:30] right
[1:18:32] now we come here
[1:18:34] to fulfill the word of this prophet
[1:18:38] amen and when we come here we are going
[1:18:42] to be confronted by them same spirits
[1:18:46] that's what he's saying there
[1:18:48] he said that's going to call you blg bob
[1:18:51] and everything else
[1:18:52] he said but you must expect it
[1:18:55] because it's the same spirits that was
[1:18:58] on judas down through the ages
[1:19:01] they're gonna come back that only makes
[1:19:03] you know who you are
[1:19:06] is that right because they're not going
[1:19:07] to waste their time with anybody else
[1:19:10] they recognize they recognize who is
[1:19:12] going there and they want to do
[1:19:14] everything they can praise god to give
[1:19:17] you a black name see they can take
[1:19:19] healing they can take all them things
[1:19:22] but when it comes to believing god
[1:19:26] speaking squirrels into existence things
[1:19:30] into existence
[1:19:31] that's too deep for them
[1:19:34] see
[1:19:35] too deep it can't be
[1:19:37] you see and that's the spirit of judas
[1:19:41] i'm talking about and his spirit can
[1:19:43] live right up to that spot
[1:19:47] when that word manifests itself on going
[1:19:49] to the stage where it becomes the
[1:19:51] interpretation of it then it can't move
[1:19:54] beyond that spot
[1:19:56] amen for the word of god itself fulfills
[1:20:00] itself right there glory to god
[1:20:03] hallelujah
[1:20:04] amen
[1:20:05] amen hallelujah so now we're living in
[1:20:08] the days of the what
[1:20:11] not they as they think they the coming
[1:20:14] of christ
[1:20:16] yes
[1:20:17] but the bright coming of christ
[1:20:22] the bright coming of christ
[1:20:24] hallelujah
[1:20:26] the son of man
[1:20:28] being revealed in our day in our time
[1:20:31] and we are conscious of it but such
[1:20:33] stuff
[1:20:34] telling others
[1:20:36] they they want to know what are you
[1:20:37] talking about
[1:20:39] we read in the same bible we don't see
[1:20:41] that we're in the same prophet amen you
[1:20:44] see the coming
[1:20:47] of the bride was prefigured and
[1:20:49] prophesied just as much as eve
[1:20:52] was in adam we were in christ as we have
[1:20:56] taught before
[1:20:57] and just as she was made
[1:21:00] of the same material adam was made of
[1:21:04] god put you here your soul being a part
[1:21:08] of the same material he was made of
[1:21:12] amen which is the word he is the word
[1:21:16] you are part of that word he is eternal
[1:21:19] you are eternal because you are a part
[1:21:21] of it and we are in him because we are
[1:21:25] a part of any of him praise god
[1:21:29] but one day
[1:21:31] eve wandered away
[1:21:33] from adam
[1:21:35] just as we wandered away from the word
[1:21:38] of god amen
[1:21:41] and we did we wanted away
[1:21:44] from the mind of god and into this world
[1:21:47] of sin
[1:21:48] and of course we suffered and passed
[1:21:51] through our spiritual amnesia
[1:21:54] but god thank god he sent a prophet
[1:21:57] a man to try to ring our bell
[1:22:01] right
[1:22:01] uh you know just to bring you back to
[1:22:04] yourself
[1:22:05] that you might recognize who you are uh
[1:22:08] who
[1:22:09] you want to live uh like a beggar and
[1:22:12] yet i'm telling you you're the child of
[1:22:14] the king you want to
[1:22:16] live like you're a
[1:22:18] sinner or this or that whatever but you
[1:22:21] are not that you are this is the devil
[1:22:23] that tie you up and tell you this but
[1:22:26] you are justified
[1:22:28] you're justified
[1:22:30] you're sanctified by the blood by the
[1:22:33] word washed by the washing of the waters
[1:22:36] of the word of god hallelujah amen
[1:22:40] praise god amen yes sir oh my so god by
[1:22:46] revelation
[1:22:48] brings his members of his body my
[1:22:52] friends
[1:22:53] into manifestation of this message sure
[1:22:57] as we've said before perfect for a
[1:22:59] perfect
[1:23:00] realization of who you are
[1:23:03] that you are the present day
[1:23:05] manifestation of the word of god i don't
[1:23:08] want to repeat myself but you go to
[1:23:10] every prophet and you'll find they were
[1:23:12] the
[1:23:13] present day manifestation for the age
[1:23:15] there in god already said i'm gonna do
[1:23:18] this
[1:23:19] and then when the time comes a prophet
[1:23:21] comes on the scene god i'm going to do
[1:23:23] that and then a prophet comes on the
[1:23:25] scene they were not just the
[1:23:28] interpreters of the word in the sense
[1:23:30] that they're going to speak the
[1:23:31] interpretation but they were the living
[1:23:34] interpretations
[1:23:36] of the word they were the present day
[1:23:39] manifestation of the word of god we are
[1:23:42] the present day manifestation of god's
[1:23:45] word hallelujah amen praise god and so
[1:23:50] by perfect realization the bride begins
[1:23:53] to move to her rightful position what is
[1:23:55] her rightful position her position she
[1:23:58] was positioned in adam in his side and
[1:24:02] so we are moving back to his side we we
[1:24:06] are here we are siding with the world
[1:24:08] we're moving back to be living in him
[1:24:11] and being a part of him praise god
[1:24:15] hallelujah
[1:24:16] amen amen so
[1:24:18] here we are
[1:24:20] walking and talking with him and the
[1:24:23] rapture takes us back where we come from
[1:24:27] hallelujah put you back where you were
[1:24:31] in him and when you use the term i i'm
[1:24:35] gonna even preach and talk about that
[1:24:36] just pass over it ah el no him
[1:24:41] oh my glory god you go right back in him
[1:24:47] where you were to begin with
[1:24:49] hallelujah for his glory
[1:24:52] praise god brother sister
[1:24:55] let me just go over a
[1:24:58] bunch of things here praise god and just
[1:25:02] move right on and to show you
[1:25:05] how the third pull was to demonstrate
[1:25:08] the progression of the word of god
[1:25:11] you know from healing to discernment the
[1:25:13] word progressing in its power to
[1:25:16] transform
[1:25:18] and then it went into a higher
[1:25:20] octave of speaking things into existence
[1:25:24] amen or it moved from the realm of
[1:25:27] taking visible things to make another
[1:25:30] visible thing in a multiplied form
[1:25:33] now it's taking nothing just like he did
[1:25:36] from the beginning of the world just
[1:25:38] spoken word and taking that and speaking
[1:25:42] things the bride into existence and the
[1:25:46] word that he spoke
[1:25:48] after a while
[1:25:50] began to materialize until he become
[1:25:53] visible
[1:25:54] praise god when this prophet come on the
[1:25:57] scene began to speak the word bring his
[1:25:59] message there wasn't anybody that
[1:26:02] understood him or believed this message
[1:26:04] amen but way back somewhere one two
[1:26:09] three it begins to build what what a
[1:26:12] bride starts to materialize
[1:26:14] something began to form hallelujah right
[1:26:17] now just scattered around the world we
[1:26:20] don't have a denomination we don't know
[1:26:23] who she is she could be here she could
[1:26:25] be there she cannot be everywhere in the
[1:26:28] east the west the north the south but
[1:26:30] the form is taking shape hallelujah and
[1:26:33] the materialization
[1:26:35] of the spoken word of god is now on the
[1:26:39] scene amen
[1:26:40] lord of god hallelujah amen
[1:26:44] christ
[1:26:45] uniting with his bride
[1:26:48] praise god moving within and you moving
[1:26:52] with that bride uniting with her in
[1:26:55] every way praise god eternity
[1:27:00] present
[1:27:03] you understand
[1:27:04] humans we think in terms of oh eternity
[1:27:07] way back there sure it was way back
[1:27:10] but eternity doesn't have past present
[1:27:14] and future
[1:27:16] eternity is right now
[1:27:18] that's why god said i am the i am
[1:27:23] not i was
[1:27:24] no i am he always is there
[1:27:28] and when you come to understand that and
[1:27:30] recognize your position in christ you
[1:27:33] are the living present-day manifestation
[1:27:38] of god's spoken word hallelujah
[1:27:41] manifested right now hallelujah eternity
[1:27:45] again has come down
[1:27:47] amen
[1:27:48] and under the great power of the holy
[1:27:51] spirit
[1:27:53] amen he's catching us away in the
[1:27:55] rapture
[1:27:57] and when you're caught away in that
[1:27:59] rapture then he takes you for a thousand
[1:28:03] year honeymoon after that
[1:28:06] after that thousand-year honeymoon is
[1:28:09] over
[1:28:10] then here comes the white horse rider
[1:28:13] the word of god
[1:28:15] with his bride
[1:28:17] riding on powers of heaven charges of
[1:28:20] god
[1:28:21] horses the bible has it as horses but
[1:28:24] it's powers of god and charges of the
[1:28:27] holy spirit
[1:28:28] anointed and coming back together with
[1:28:31] him for the world to see that who they
[1:28:34] are that she and him are one together
[1:28:38] for the glory and praise of god amen
[1:28:41] prophet
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:43] and then
[1:28:45] the prophet
[1:28:46] and then it moved to the prophet's
[1:28:47] prophecy
[1:28:49] and then
[1:28:51] you start walking in the manifestation
[1:28:54] of that
[1:28:55] prophet's word that has taken place amen
[1:29:00] how wonderful and blessed to know that
[1:29:03] he is the same
[1:29:05] yesterday today
[1:29:07] and forever praise god hallelujah now
[1:29:11] remember the bible tells us and i'm
[1:29:13] going to start winding down
[1:29:15] how that a sower went forth to sow
[1:29:18] and when he sow
[1:29:20] he sowed seeds
[1:29:22] praise god
[1:29:23] and
[1:29:24] uh if you know the sowing of seeds it
[1:29:27] always was they have a bag at their
[1:29:29] sides will take out and it will throw
[1:29:31] the seeds and then it's moved on to
[1:29:33] machines and technology that we have
[1:29:36] today amen but god already has higher
[1:29:39] technology than that because to sow his
[1:29:42] seed god uses prophets
[1:29:47] and his seed is his word
[1:29:50] and the spoken word is the original
[1:29:52] scene
[1:29:53] and the prophet when he speaks the word
[1:29:55] of god it is actually god
[1:29:58] sowing his seed
[1:30:01] his seed word
[1:30:02] the word is being so
[1:30:04] oh praise god hallelujah right through
[1:30:08] the prophet's mouth
[1:30:10] and so the word is planted in your heart
[1:30:14] my heart
[1:30:16] is planted in my heart your heart by the
[1:30:19] spoken word of god true a prophet
[1:30:23] for his glory amen praise god god spoke
[1:30:27] through a prophet and said there's going
[1:30:30] to be a bright tree
[1:30:32] hallelujah
[1:30:33] that word once is spoken he said my word
[1:30:36] wants to go out it cannot return void
[1:30:40] doesn't matter it's a thousand years
[1:30:42] that word is going to circle until it
[1:30:45] creates what god spoke it to create what
[1:30:48] god told it to do that world is going to
[1:30:51] go out and do exactly what god told it
[1:30:54] to do
[1:30:55] amen hallelujah
[1:30:57] spoke about a bright tree
[1:31:00] and how that bright tree is going to be
[1:31:02] restored brought back by redemption
[1:31:06] brought back by what brought back to
[1:31:08] heaven by what prophesied a rapture
[1:31:13] you know the prophets preaching
[1:31:16] filled with is speaking about a rapture
[1:31:19] jesus himself promising a rapture i've
[1:31:22] got to prepare a place for you that
[1:31:24] where i am you may be also he spoke the
[1:31:27] word there's gonna be a rapture this is
[1:31:29] not a myth this is not a story but this
[1:31:33] is the fullness of the word of the
[1:31:35] living god that this is going to be a
[1:31:37] rapture hallelujah amen
[1:31:40] now
[1:31:43] see all of god's
[1:31:46] words are seeds
[1:31:49] his spoken word and when he had spoke
[1:31:53] i'm speaking from the power of
[1:31:55] transformation
[1:31:56] here that he has spoke
[1:31:59] his word always brings forth of its kind
[1:32:04] the earth come
[1:32:06] and there was light
[1:32:08] there was sunshine when he said let
[1:32:10] sunshine
[1:32:11] amen see he had it in his mind
[1:32:15] and if the sun did shine the flower
[1:32:18] would grow that he's he spoke into
[1:32:21] existence so he makes everything to
[1:32:24] fulfill and meet its purpose
[1:32:28] whatever it is
[1:32:30] like
[1:32:32] just like speaking a tree
[1:32:35] amen i'm talking about the bright tree
[1:32:37] here now
[1:32:38] the bright tree spoken into existence by
[1:32:41] the word of god hallelujah then if it's
[1:32:44] to bear a certain kind of fruit a corn
[1:32:48] or apple or whatever he makes that fruit
[1:32:52] so forth because it is here to serve his
[1:32:55] purpose and it must come to pass
[1:32:59] hallelujah the only thing he had to do
[1:33:03] after he spoke it
[1:33:05] amen then he has to watch and wait i
[1:33:09] don't know how much that thing had to go
[1:33:12] through
[1:33:13] before it come to pass i don't know how
[1:33:16] many times
[1:33:17] it how many rejects it must have had and
[1:33:21] whatever more it had to come true but it
[1:33:25] has to come to pass amen listen there's
[1:33:28] got to be a bride tree there is a bright
[1:33:31] tree there is a bride on the scene by
[1:33:34] the spoken word of god the great shore
[1:33:37] showed the seeds through the
[1:33:40] ministry of malachi 4 5 and revelation
[1:33:45] 10 7 and we are the manifestation of
[1:33:49] those seeds that have come up to their
[1:33:51] rightness and fullness in this hour and
[1:33:54] in this day praise god
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:58] we are the interpretation of his message
[1:34:03] we are the manifestation of the word of
[1:34:06] god
[1:34:07] hallelujah oh my don't you understand
[1:34:10] what i'm saying i'm continuing the quote
[1:34:14] the same thing
[1:34:16] is him
[1:34:17] about having his church here now in
[1:34:21] these last days
[1:34:22] so he talk about the tree and talk about
[1:34:24] all those things he said but really what
[1:34:26] i'm talking about is the same way scott
[1:34:30] spoke the word there has to be a bride a
[1:34:34] church in this last this matter of fact
[1:34:36] he says it here he's he is going to have
[1:34:40] a bride
[1:34:42] hallelujah
[1:34:44] for he has spoken the word hallelujah
[1:34:47] and now the word is making itself
[1:34:50] manifest
[1:34:51] now
[1:34:52] and again it repeats he is able of these
[1:34:56] stones to raise up children to abraham
[1:35:01] if we don't follow him he'll get
[1:35:04] somebody else
[1:35:06] that will follow him he's going to have
[1:35:09] it he's going to have that bride because
[1:35:11] he has already spoken whatever he says
[1:35:15] it has to be that way it cannot change
[1:35:18] it must comfort the way he said it
[1:35:21] because he said it would happen in this
[1:35:25] day amen praise god so that's the
[1:35:28] genesis of the genesis and that is the
[1:35:32] uh what should i say the fullness of
[1:35:35] what i'm trying to say here today is
[1:35:38] that
[1:35:39] we are the manifestation
[1:35:42] of god's spoken word
[1:35:45] through the mouth
[1:35:47] of a prophet
[1:35:48] that has gone on
[1:35:50] you see
[1:35:51] the prophet spoke the word
[1:35:54] and he's left the scene but the word
[1:35:56] continue to percolate and work
[1:36:00] right
[1:36:01] like one quote he says yes they may take
[1:36:03] the messenger the messenger may go but
[1:36:05] it's not the messenger it's the message
[1:36:09] and that message is still working in the
[1:36:11] world today because it's the spoken word
[1:36:13] of god still vibrating and moving and
[1:36:16] quickening and just working its way into
[1:36:19] the hearts of men and women
[1:36:22] changing lives transforming people
[1:36:25] the elected of god
[1:36:27] pulled by the word of god
[1:36:29] into the presence of the living god
[1:36:32] hallelujah
[1:36:33] not by
[1:36:35] multiplication of what was already there
[1:36:39] right he did that like he said with the
[1:36:41] wine and did that with the fish and the
[1:36:43] bread he says but now
[1:36:46] this
[1:36:47] is coming forth from pure spoken word
[1:36:51] just the words spoken
[1:36:53] no other material
[1:36:55] just spoken word material
[1:36:58] and then creation in the beginning
[1:37:00] ending of the world the same kind of
[1:37:03] creation taking place here again by
[1:37:06] god's spoken word and we thank god that
[1:37:10] we are in it
[1:37:12] we are a part of it and we are in it
[1:37:15] because we are that creation
[1:37:17] that's why he called us his masterpiece
[1:37:21] we are that masterpiece
[1:37:23] and the birth that we are here to
[1:37:25] celebrate
[1:37:26] is the birth of christ the lord once
[1:37:29] again the word made flesh you see i'm
[1:37:32] saying the same things but you see it
[1:37:34] meaning something else to you because
[1:37:36] you know what i'm saying the word made
[1:37:39] flesh not in him just back there but the
[1:37:41] word made flesh in you
[1:37:44] the word making itself manifest in you
[1:37:47] and declaring itself to the people
[1:37:51] that they may start to understand this
[1:37:53] book
[1:37:54] but you become the
[1:37:56] living epistles
[1:37:59] the living interpretations
[1:38:01] of this word of god and not because you
[1:38:04] have to try and make yourself look holy
[1:38:07] or try to work yourself up into
[1:38:10] something that is why he started the sim
[1:38:12] he said remember with these seals
[1:38:14] it's god hiding in simplicity
[1:38:17] just be simple
[1:38:19] be humble
[1:38:20] be reverent
[1:38:22] and go about your business
[1:38:24] and god will bless you
[1:38:26] just that's all
[1:38:28] you have to do because it is salvation
[1:38:31] is of the lord
[1:38:33] it's not of you
[1:38:35] it's not of works it's not of you trying
[1:38:38] to perfect yourself or to do this or
[1:38:40] that or whatever
[1:38:42] or or whether you drink a less coffee
[1:38:45] then you'll be more of a christian or if
[1:38:47] you don't drink tea
[1:38:49] you know what i'm saying all these kinds
[1:38:51] of things like that
[1:38:53] the spirit of god start taking your mind
[1:38:56] away from all these weird fantastic
[1:38:59] uh things like that and bring you to a
[1:39:02] sanity and a stability
[1:39:04] back on the foundations of the word of
[1:39:07] god
[1:39:08] amen
[1:39:10] so i believe that praise the lord so
[1:39:13] that is my subject for today and i trust
[1:39:16] it has touched your heart
[1:39:18] and bless your soul
[1:39:20] [Applause]
[1:39:25] i know i might have gotten so excited in
[1:39:27] certain parts of it that i might have
[1:39:29] just been flying over things and
[1:39:32] running you know like that but
[1:39:34] bear with me because i'm just a human
[1:39:37] just like you
[1:39:38] and
[1:39:39] i'm just as excited if not more excited
[1:39:42] for what i'm seeing in the world praise
[1:39:45] the lord and i want to thank god for the
[1:39:47] blessing of brother thomas brady
[1:39:51] spoke or touched
[1:39:53] on this
[1:39:54] subject
[1:39:56] uh
[1:39:57] in a small way and
[1:39:59] went on
[1:40:01] but
[1:40:02] i caught the seed of that
[1:40:05] praise the lord but it's only now
[1:40:07] many years because i'm talking about
[1:40:09] since like in the uh 90s early 90s uh
[1:40:14] that the thing has resurrected and said
[1:40:17] now is the time this is the hour right
[1:40:20] praise god not you're not just the
[1:40:23] manifestation of the prophet's spoken
[1:40:27] word
[1:40:29] for god uses the prophet to be his mouth
[1:40:32] you're the manifestation of god's word
[1:40:35] spoken through the prophet
[1:40:38] and now you are his creation
[1:40:42] standing living in this present age
[1:40:46] this present time
[1:40:48] standing on the face of the earth you
[1:40:51] not need no interpretation of that for
[1:40:54] the manifestation
[1:40:56] is the interpretation
[1:40:58] you need to go interpreting the message
[1:41:00] and people taking parts of it and trying
[1:41:03] to splice it here or splice it there on
[1:41:06] the tapes or take in pieces and coats
[1:41:08] here and coats there and putting it
[1:41:10] together to show their their dexterity
[1:41:13] and stuff like that just living and
[1:41:16] walking
[1:41:17] in the word
[1:41:19] and being at peace with god and with
[1:41:21] yourself with your brothers and your
[1:41:23] sisters you become and you are
[1:41:26] be conscious of god
[1:41:28] and be conscious of that fact that we
[1:41:32] are
[1:41:33] the present day
[1:41:35] living manifestation
[1:41:38] of god's spoken word through the mouth
[1:41:42] of a prophet that has passed our way
[1:41:46] and he had to pass our way
[1:41:50] because his ministry had to call out the
[1:41:52] elect of this age
[1:41:55] and if you are you are one or were one
[1:41:58] of the elect no matter how much dirt
[1:42:01] where you were buried or if you were
[1:42:03] living in a palace he had to pass your
[1:42:06] way and call you out of the path for the
[1:42:09] world
[1:42:10] [Applause]
[1:42:11] amen praise god so come
[1:42:14] let us adore him
[1:42:17] christ
[1:42:18] the lord
[1:42:19] same yesterday
[1:42:21] today
[1:42:22] and forever
[1:42:24] amen praise the lord he's a wonderful
[1:42:27] god isn't he
[1:42:29] lord of god as this that's this
[1:42:31] wonderful roman candle keeps bursting
[1:42:34] and keep going higher and higher and
[1:42:36] keep going like that praise god i thank
[1:42:39] god for his word
[1:42:41] i feel so
[1:42:43] badly for many who believe that brother
[1:42:46] branham is the pastor
[1:42:49] to
[1:42:50] the or this age that we're living in
[1:42:54] they don't understand yes he is the
[1:42:56] pastor of the seventh church age
[1:43:00] ah
[1:43:01] but
[1:43:02] he himself tells you clearly
[1:43:04] the seventh church age is finished it's
[1:43:07] over
[1:43:08] done is that right
[1:43:12] and now we're under the leadership of
[1:43:15] our bridegroom
[1:43:17] the headship
[1:43:19] of the word of god
[1:43:21] and more so
[1:43:23] because it is true the holy spirit the
[1:43:26] word of god
[1:43:28] that's why he said several times also no
[1:43:31] he says i'm only hitting the highlights
[1:43:34] wait till them young men come
[1:43:37] on the scene
[1:43:38] amen
[1:43:39] and they'll break it down they'll take
[1:43:41] it and they'll break the whole thing
[1:43:43] down well it's not them the holy spirit
[1:43:46] through them is going to take that word
[1:43:48] and break it down so that we can all
[1:43:51] feast upon the words that were placed
[1:43:54] the food that was in the storehouse
[1:43:57] is that right praise god
[1:44:00] hallelujah
[1:44:01] oh i just said that and when i said that
[1:44:03] your the holy spirit says almost like do
[1:44:06] you realize what you set food in the
[1:44:07] storehouse
[1:44:10] how could you how how could israel store
[1:44:12] up mana
[1:44:14] they couldn't store up manna
[1:44:17] the only food that could be stored up
[1:44:21] was
[1:44:22] the angels food was put that was put in
[1:44:26] the golden pot
[1:44:29] within the holy of holies
[1:44:32] and the pillar of fire standing above it
[1:44:35] that's the only
[1:44:37] only one
[1:44:39] that can be stored up
[1:44:40] right
[1:44:41] so that's what happened in that minute
[1:44:44] that's the second when i said storehouse
[1:44:47] that's what the holy spirit said look
[1:44:49] there it is you see what he placed there
[1:44:53] is food but that food is behind the veil
[1:44:56] right it's behind the veil only those
[1:44:59] who are permitted to go behind that veil
[1:45:02] those elected seed of god are going to
[1:45:05] feed on that storehouse and eat the
[1:45:08] present day word of the living god that
[1:45:11] is going to keep them for the journey
[1:45:13] amen god bless you god bless your hearts
[1:45:15] praise the lord hallelujah of course you
[1:45:18] know this is eternal
[1:45:21] and if i keep talking like this even if
[1:45:23] i calm down and smoke casually it's
[1:45:25] going to keep breaking and breaking and
[1:45:27] breaking so we give god praise honor and

[1:53:46] today we're going to be handing out
[1:53:49] um let me grab it
[1:53:51] we've got a gift for you this year
[1:53:54] from the ministry
[1:53:55] and
[1:53:56] what it is
[1:53:58] is
[1:53:59] a pocket calendar
[1:54:03] you'll be getting one as you leave today
[1:54:06] and you know um
[1:54:08] written on there you're gonna see that
[1:54:10] at the front you know with the uh with
[1:54:12] the picture of the cloud it says
[1:54:14] transforming the world one person at a
[1:54:16] time and our actual
[1:54:19] writing the way that we do it is
[1:54:21] changing the world one person at a time
[1:54:23] but somehow
[1:54:24] it just
[1:54:26] it got done this way and you know pastor
[1:54:29] simon brought it to my attention and i
[1:54:30] thought
[1:54:31] wow we both missed that you know
[1:54:34] when we checked the uh you know the uh
[1:54:36] the proof and everything but then how
[1:54:38] did it get there and something kind of
[1:54:40] tells me that
[1:54:42] i unconsciously did it right because
[1:54:44] when i you know when i wrote it out but
[1:54:46] anyways i thought you know
[1:54:49] the word transforming is a powerful word
[1:54:53] and
[1:54:53] you know i looked it up and brother
[1:54:55] branham preached on the you know the
[1:54:58] power of transformation
[1:55:00] and this is what he said he says what is
[1:55:02] it transforming
[1:55:04] transforming by the word of god

[1:55:10] transformed today

[1:55:36] you know and i brought that up and i
[1:55:37] said praise the lord and then you look
[1:55:39] at the definition
[1:55:41] of the word transform
[1:55:44] and
[1:55:45] it's make a thorough or dramatic change
