whom we don't see with our eyes but by faith we feel him and sense him within the heart hallelujah oh praise god thank you lord oh my praise god shall we look to the word of god amen galatians chapter 3 reading from verses 6 to 9. amen praise god hallelujah it reads thus even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know he therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham and the scriptures for seeing that god would justify the heathen through the faith through faith justifying the heathen the eden is talking about the seven church ages that's when they he didn't start coming in right but justify them by faith preached before the gospel unto abraham amen so in the gospel was preached to abraham amen by revelation of course god let him foresee and whatever amen in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with the faithful abraham praise god because they are manifesting the same qualities that he had he abraham believed god by faith like i always he didn't have a written bible what was it he believed but you see the spirit of god manifests himself and reveals his word to those individuals that he has elected before the foundations of the world and this same quality has come back now to individuals and believers in this last age to be able to believe like abraham believed therefore god conquest them as children of abraham praise god let's pray and then we'll go into the word and god will make that better for us and clear it for us praise the lord father we thank you for the reading of the written word but you know we come here to serve worship adore and honor the living word the spirit of the word spirit of the letter lord that that lives that caused this written word to live again lord jesus bless us here today for we gather in your name under the great and blessed anointing of the holy spirit so we ask father that you will bless us now take glory and honor in jesus name amen and amen god bless you please be seated hallelujah amen the last time we were here together we spoke touching on certain themes called fro from the dust of the earth and we talked about the waving of the sheath the word of god coming to full maturity in this last day the accumulation of the word revelation through the ages come to the point where the word has come back to its full maturity in other words a seed was planted in the ground and there on golgotha's hill and that seed went through its cycle of the seasons of the church ages amen you know the summer and spring and and and so on right right to the fall and winter and then rise again and here we are the word coming back seed back to seed amen praise god see and there we are now the word is back to its original maturity right the mature word was who jesus christ he was the full matured word and so now he has come back to his full majority praise god that the prophet said remember in the restoration of the bride it's not just justification for justification makes way for sanctification it has to move out the way when sanctification comes sanctification made way for the baptism of the holy spirit but now he says the the baptism of the holy ghost makes way for the holy ghost himself that is what we're talking about and that is the thin veil deception religious reception that has caught and envelops the minds and hearts of many brothers and sisters that they do not recognize it's not in the so-called baptism of the holy spirit that's though even though that is of god and that is wonderful but coming to the place of recognizing and uh having the person of christ revealed to you and indwelling you showing you that he's indwelling you praise the lord hallelujah everything i'm saying there you know um we can go off on them and spend a long time so i better move on amen well we talked about the full maturity of the word now not in the flesh anymore but he came back as the holy spirit and now he's waving himself above the church of the living god in the last day praise god and as the wave sheath is waved he is waving it over the attribute sons of the spirit of almighty god hallelujah amen all them attribute sons that have and are living in the dust of the earth amongst these billions of people like dust amen and god is waving the word above them to catch their attention that they come back to the world because they are not of the pentecostal age they may see signs he want to see miracles but they are not attracted by that they are only attracted their thirst their hunger for the bread of life they test for the ever-present waters from the rock it draws them into the presence of almighty god hallelujah they can't deny what they're seeing they can't deny their own heart because they recognize and they recognize that this is their day they recognize this is their message and now they're acting upon that message that they have received by revelation through the holy spirit amen hallelujah now them attribute sons were laying in the dust of the earth you know the scripture i should and every preacher knows it ashes washes dust the dust from the dust you came to the dust you will return it's in the bibles in the message everywhere that is an accepted fact we come from dirt cosmic lights and everything else chemicals in the earth we're going back to the earth if we die amen but when god's spirit looks down searching for those attributes sons and daughters that was scattered among the billions of the dust of the earth here praise god and living in the dust and the earth then we understand that only the spirit can energize the world so the spirit comes to energize the world energize the seed worm like the seed that was laying in the in the coffin in in egypt and then they put moisture on it and behold after a thousand three thousand years them seeds come back to life amen praise god that's the same thing god is doing he hid the life in the seed they read the seed in the dirt but at the season and time god sends the latter reigns of the spirit the teaching reign of the prophet and it moisturizes and bring about oh my those seeds come back to life hallelujah energized by the word of god hallelujah amen praise god so we are thankful to god for all these sons object of the attributes of god who come and we're here upon the earth praise god quickening us back to our resurrection praise god because that quickening by the spirit raising up them sons and daughters from the dust of the earth that is our resurrection that's why he said don't you recognize you are already resurrected this physical body can't do nothing else but go in the event of the resurrection when that takes place but your resurrection spiritually is right now it's taken place by the holy ghost amen and believe me oh i believe i am speaking by the holy ghost i believe i'm delivering this to you by the holy ghost not an imagination of a religious spirit but by the anointing of the blessed holy spirit of almighty god amen oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah amen so he sent the spirit to energize the word sent the dynamics to uh manifest the mechanics praise god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah so i thank god that we it's not looking for our bodies to come from a literal grave down the road but to recognize right now what the holy spirit is doing and the misconception that but the church ages have taught the people to look for bodies raising up with gums on and slowly going up in the air and god says he's coming as a thief before your voice happened it's gone you're left behind that twinkling of an eye that's only that's just this left now just like that but the rapture and the resurrection already take place and taking place in many inside us right now oh praise god forevermore hallelujah oh my my mind listen let me go now to what we're talking about here today of course we know that jesus is the seed not a seed but he is the seed and the various seeds come from the seed amen so when isaiah prophesied and said he shall see his seed in their generation whatever age they're supposed to come up in but he will see the seeds that are predestinated for that time hallelujah remember says the prophet's morning and church age jesus is this seed and with him is counted this seed children praise god because his seed children are in him us and their children of the promise hallelujah and you see promise has to do with election promise has to do with the choosing of god hallelujah these are the royal seeds of abraham they are the ones that are elect of god and therefore means that they were already foreknown of god and predestinated by the living god and they were in the mind of god and in his thoughts of god hallelujah in plain language then the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally hallelujah but were never expressed hallelujah we were in this thoughts eternally oh blessed be god forevermore amen see all though they were not expressed until each one came forth in their designated and decreed age he's a seasoned age hallelujah everyone had to come in a designated age is that right so if your attraction was to be justification the people of that age that were designated for that age that would be their pool and that would pull them into the neck of god's spirit but that's not our attraction that's what every time you hear in repeating repeating that's what he was trying to get the people to understand he says you you you're in this age you can't go even if luther were to come here and preach to you it wouldn't mean much to you it won't pull you if if wesley any of those other ages pentecost wonderful as they are you will not have a pull on you because that's not the age you were decreed and designated for you designated for this age this is your time this is your day your hour you were shaped for this you were born for this god placed you in the season oh praise god hallelujah oh my amen so you become manifested when you were in this mind you were not expressed but when he sent a prophet and the prophet spoke the word them thoughts that expressed through that word that was lost and then restored yet by those prophets the son of man expressed in the form of a prophet gathered that is the reason why we are here physical representation of the invisible spoken word oh praise god hallelujah you are the real me you can't see the real you i can't see is that right we can't see but but that's the man that's been restored that's the man that woke up from his sleep amen that's the person praise god i rise now that sleepiness and he will give you the light amen you're sleeping in the dust of the earth the spirit of god is here to wake up every soul every life and every mind back to the word back to the original cape amen glory to god hallelujah amen so each member comes forth in their decreed season and become expressed or manifested which is same as saying manifested and then take its place within the body so this right then is the literal spoken word seed bride of jesus christ hallelujah oh my and though she is called feminine in designation she is called the body of christ for remember it is a pirate that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated and he got it here predestinated in him coming from the same source that he come from and therefore she was always eternal with him now and is now manifesting god but now in a many-membered body whereas once god only manifested it in one member called jesus christ now he is manifesting it in a many-membered body the revealing of the son of man in the book of acts one person the one person on the earth again in the time of jesus but now the son of man is supposed to reveal again hallelujah in this time of uh that looks like a time of lot and law to be revealed again and he is being revealed again for he is in the sons of men that were predestinated in the dust of the ark and now called forth to life by the power of the holy spirit amen oh my the husband or the head of the body was by himself then but now the entire body is called in other words he he was not complete without her like a man is not complete without his wife praise god now the fourth seal do you know god is like a big contractor he lays out all his material and he lays them out on the earth see back then brother bran speaking like this how does that sound he's just talking about the contractor and how the man is going to build a house and then lays out his materials on the earth but there is not the real understanding of what that really means amen then he begins to build his buildings now before there was ever a grain of seed on the earth before the sun even struck the earth your body was already laying on the earth amen hallelujah oh my because you are the dust of the earth hallelujah yes you are the dust of the earth and god is the contractor now the way he was going to do it now what he's going to talk about is how god was going to bring forth his sons and daughters i'll give you a quick thing but then i'll go back to the quote but then show how eve contaminated the bloodline or interrupted the program of god and god had to have a plan to restore back that bloodline amen back to the word amen remember see god was i'm sure you how he was going to do it was to reach down and like he did with adam and get a bunch of earth calcium potash cosmic light and then the spirit there is my other son amen then he'd bring up some more some more some more and there's another one there's another one that's how he was going to do it by his spoken word there is a son there is another one there's enough by his spoken word by his creative voice but what did eve do no she corrupted the way of it and she brought forth that through a sexual act then gets tracked now what is god doing now he still got so many of them seeds down there and they are predestinated what's he going to do see in other words the rest of us got trapped we all got trapped because the whole plan got interrupted and we got trapped in these physical bodies and there we are praise god but then you see amen many seeds of them that's predestinated oh my so much of them predestinated but then at the end time now he won't go back saying eve bear another child another mortal child like that no he'll just again he'll go back to that spoken word is that right creative voice seven thunders he'll go right back to his original plan once the people start to catch the revelation of his original intention then he goes back to his original plan i say go back he doesn't have to go back it's always there it's just that we didn't understand that catch it so he'll he'll just say and call amen he'll call that means spoken word there and then we'll answer i'll answer that's all that's what it is that's the idea see how simple amen but god hides in simplicity and reveals himself in the same so we you and i before we have come to the revelation of the lord you the spirit of god was just waving over you and on the voice from the word called out amen and when it called out to you amen you answered the call he said and i'll answer when i hear that i'll answer praise god when you heard it you answered the word you answered you responded to the call of the word of god hallelujah amen when and then when that last one hears it and is brought in that settles it amen amen bringing them souls out of prison by the preaching of the world preaching to souls that are imprisoned now amen bringing them out and taking them with him back to where he was amen so as we predestinated where of course i repeat again for retention uh we're trapped in this mortal bodies because of eve's sin but in the end time god promised he is not going to go along with that satan-inspired plan that satan put down here but and he's not going to have more children by sex relations but he's going to have more children by revelations the revelation of the word will bring his children back to the original plan and thought in other words he will resume his original plan by the holy spirit praise god and when that last seed child that was trapped in a mortal body is called out by revelation through the spoken word of god then that last seed is then expressed or amen and christ's body will then be complete male and female together again by invisible union hallelujah they're brought together again blessed be the name of the lord for seal that was now uh we are going to talk about the token is that all right amen so then that there could be no mistake the seed of this life natural life must be planted in the earth but this body that is in is a perishable body see and the life if it's a perverted life in that seed it will then have to perish with that seed oh my but when that body has he put eternal life into it oh there's a big difference do you believe that hallelujah and identify that life in that as his own praise god that is that in the resurrection he'd raise it up again and nothing of them will be lost i said nothing will be lost praise god oh my there it is it cannot perish see because his life lays over it praise god oh my when you use that term you remember um is it elijah elijah elijah and the boy that died amen is using that kind of imagery for you to understand his life lays over that sea lays over it for it is a token and if you look how it's written here capital t it's part of god himself is that right and so he lives over that little body and he repeats it now again but listen how he says it yes he lays his life over that soul that person there is a token over there the holy spirit that that belongs to god then that is when he said when i see that token i will pass over you hallelujah what is why it's a positive token the holy spirit is our token therefore when you receive the holy ghost you have passed from death to life that's all there is to it cause the life is in you you can no more perish hallelujah what god what is the prophet is talking about using the typology and imagery of exodus there when god said stay in the house the blood will lay right over the door his blood types life will lay over the door and when the death angel passes and he sees that life or blood laying over the door i'll pass over you type of these last days when his life lays over that seed protecting it and preserving it as a designated time that it's woke up it's brought to life hallelujah and he's telling the angel of spiritual death don't touch that one don't you touch that one hallelujah i'm that one i'm passing over that's a royal seed that's a predestinated seed amen so you project you're protected from death spiritual death and damnation while you are in the house of the holy spirit covered by his life hallelujah not talking about being in the natural building like there were and then they were protected by not going out the building but you are staying in christ and you are protected from the angel of death that is going out now as you can see out there corrupting the people are being corrupted they're becoming evil doing everything else bringing death and damnation hallelujah but you can't come to that because the scene is your anchor on the inside of you that seed is there to keep you your conscience it's a work through every fight where you're being hallelujah not that you will make mistakes stumble here there whatever but the moment you get quiet thoughts hear god will begin to talk to you you all praise god hallelujah listen your pastor is only here to be a physical leadership for you but there's a man inside like the gem said you have a witness in you hallelujah they call it intuition tuition means teaching you got an inside teacher amen i'll send the holy ghost he'll be in you he'll teach you he'll die for he'll lead you praise god hallelujah amen oh my praise god i i want to briefly mention uh this misconception of the baptism holy ghost we're thinking that the holy ghost is just going to come something is going to come from the outside of you and and just baptize you and then you got the holy ghost not realizing he was talking about the holy ghost for our age and that chinese laundry tag how the original owner holds a half and the other half stays in the shop amen and it's only when those two deep cross to the deep respond hallelujah only when male and female come together they fit amen because there's no you can't impersonate that because that is god's will god's plan god's purpose god wants amen oh my praise god hallelujah oh praise god so thank god that we understand now that the spiritual supernatural resurrection is the awakening of the seed within your heart within your life praise god amen resurrection your resurrection body but some first corinthians 15 if you can uh somehow be able to do that if you can't that's fine first corinthians 15 reading from verse 35 but some men will say how are the dead raised up with what body do they come thou fool that which thou shalt is not quickened except it die and that which thou shares those who has not that body amen that shall be but their grain but chance of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it a body amen let me read that first corinthians let me give it to you first corinthians 15 and this is verse 38 where paul said don't you understand it's not just this body that you come here and then it dies and they put it in a grave but god giveth it a body as it had pleased him and to every seed he gave his own body everyone you got a designated body i said you have another body that god decree and designate and predestinated to you and you know what body i'm talking about you have a theophany absent from the body present with the lord leave this body go to another one you're in a natural body where you are a creature of time and time limits you you're limited to a position a place a location and so on because of time but when you break out of time like jesus did when he went to his glorified body you or he can make you faster walls or be here be wherever he wants praise god because now you've been quickened hallelujah you broke through all the limitations of natural gravity has no control over you oh blessed be the am i dreaming are you dreaming are we fanciful something's wrong with us no we see clearly what is before us [Music] hallelujah oh my for let me read it again i love it but god giveth it a body as it had pleased him god giveth every one of those seeds have their own theophany and every seed he says every seed has his own body or theophany amen oh you remember all these other teachings when he's saying yes there's bodies terrestrial bodies celestial and so on so but god given everyone their own body hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah now notice this is of the seed of discrepancy as soon as jesus went away and went into heaven the holy spirit was sent back that was the seed amen but the holy spirit is jesus christ just in a spirit form not more poor in the physical form but now in his spirit form he he's come back in the form of the holy spirit praise the lord amen and so he went into heaven the holy spirit came back and that was the seed that was the life giver of the word amen hallelujah well listen friends i don't care how long you have a seed on the shelf you have that seed and the scientists get twisted turn it magnify it use every means on it they can't see the life that's hiding in that sea is that right impossible they can't see the life that is in that seed but under the right conditions and circumstances that seed can live again oh praise god notice see the life giver has now come what come to the word hallelujah the word was sleeping in the dust the seed was sleeping in the dust it seems like it was dead but in the decreed season and time hallelujah not in the winter but in the right time the sunlight the rain the conditions become right and then that seed finds something blossoming in within it praise the name of the lord hallelujah oh by the way i have a little the little plant the little seed it's an old poem by i've read it to you before some years ago by kate l brown hallelujah praise god let me finish this quote and then i'll read it see he comes to quicken the word comes to quicken the word quentin quicken really means to bring it to life bring to life the seed that was in the earth spiritual earth it would bring a creed to life it can't it's nothing of a creed it's the life of the word of god for that is god see and it quickens that body amen quickness the spiritual body amen quickness your soul quickens the spiritual body to bring them back together in contact that's right so you hear from your theophany by the word of god hallelujah quickens it now listen to about this little poem the little plant in the heart of a seed buried deep so deep a tiny plant was laying there fast asleep work said the rising of the sun wakes as the sunshine and come to the light wick said the voice seven thunders of the raindrops bright the little plant heard and it rose up to see what the wonderful outside world may be oh praise god hallelujah i'm talking to you little thanks you little seeds of god that's in your heart the holy spirit has walked you up to recognize what a wonderful world that you're living in [Music] not that outside there but this world that the spirit of god has opened up to us jesus john chapter 5 verse 24 verily verily i sent to you jesus speaking he that heareth my word and believe it on him that sent me half everlasting life see we never noticed these things for cook less number your years past tense hats everlasting life you didn't just get it it had to be in you before the foundations of the world he had it this is just proving what you're doing now that you are identifying who you are he has everlasting life hallelujah and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into life verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god not son of man but the holy spirit son of god hallelujah son of man son of david son of man right hallelujah son of god son of man praise god hallelujah so there it is comes in three sons names and we find out whenever it's mentioned son of god is talking about the holy ghost amen son of man is when he comes back in flesh whether himself or in his children but the hour is coming when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god now listen this one here is two passages like this in the gospels but one is talking about the physical dead being raised up this one is talking about us who are dead and sins trespasses and laying in the dust of the earth hearing the voice of the son the holy spirit is going to come and move over them and they're going to hear that voice hallelujah and there that here shall live for as the father had life in themselves so had he given to the son to have life in himself hallelujah oh and had given him resurrection hallelujah praise god now looks the second part here the first part is one but here is the second part for the hour is coming in which they that are in the graves shall hear their voice hallelujah and shall come forth they that have done good into the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation you got that hallelujah he's talking about your spiritual resurrection you'll be spiritually resurrected to go out and what live a good life not to condemnation or damnation but to live god's life but the other seed can do nothing but the life is that's where it's leading right to damnation that's where it's going to take them right back to oh my remember when jesus came out of the water the heavens opened the prophet saw it he saw the heavens open and out of heaven came a form of a dove and with the dove there also came a voice saying listen how he says it that voice was saying this is my part of the earth that i have redeemed hallelujah and from this part of the earth i will redeem all the rest of it for he is my word made manifest on the whole world i spoke into existence by my word hebrews 11. do you believe this was god speaking through the prophet and satan held it up all this time but now i've come to redeem it who's speaking brother bran just speaking oh my i've come to redeem it so much of it has made up his body and i'm coming to dwell in it just like he dwelt in him i'm coming to dwell now in this amen this part of this body amen hallelujah praise god for john saw it and he said i saw the holy city the new jerusalem descending out of heaven as a bride or dawn for her husband and where did it set long just exactly like it did back on there upon the earth hallelujah it settled right on jesus back then hallelujah and now you are i as the bride it settles on you if you are part of that election scene but in a larger sense he's also trying to he gets satan's words he's just got to keep the line he's on but by revelation do you understand that he's saying that when the spirit of god came down and those words were uttered we were still in him this is my part of the earth i have elected it i chosen it to manifest my word hallelujah praise god that part of it died on calvary to release the other part and now he says i have come to redeem this part hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah for jesus was part of the earth and the holy ghost descended upon him and remained upon him forever it never can leave him it is always there he and god are one always to remain one and you in that day you'll know i am in the father the father and me and i in you and together one hallelujah not father son and bride no but one hallelujah said the spirit and the bride says come the spirit in the bride says call for is one god working in his spirit hallelujah see now you remember john saw that the holy city is telling us the whole thing again so we understand the new jerusalem descending like a comet or like a dove coming down out of heaven and settling upon a redeemed entire earth to do what that he might claim every attribute that he made on that earth hallelujah every man that was represented in that any eternity or praise god hallelujah you think you have representation [Music] i'm using his words here every man or woman that was represented in that in eternity amen hallelujah you were represented in the water there because you already was represented in eternity you were he was all the world wrapped up together so when he come down we were all in him and he goes and he gets baptized people are all in him hallelujah when god spoke over him we were all in him this is my beloved child this is one amen oh my god and i choose them and i please to dwell with them praise god hallelujah ever you see and that's the way it is with every man or woman that is redeemed for that means they have been scoured out and burnt out by the fires of god that's what he was talking about in the future home not just the literal orc burning the germs in the skies and chasing out the devils there maybe that will be also but he's talking about you and i all the germs and demons that haunt your thoughts your mind your being constantly harassing you and everything else but to cast them out and burn them out with the fire of the holy spirit amen glory to god hallelujah oh my don't you see how's he gonna burn it up what's the fire he gonna use what fire you think god is gonna use a spiritual fire now listen how are you gonna explain that do you see it scared out burnt by fire remember jesus when he had his fiery temptations you see the fire you see how he's going to burn it out to you you see how he's going to shape you and make you what he wants you to be you see jesus in his fiery temptations in the wilderness that's why for us the wilderness we on this earth right for them 40 days for whatever period of time you're on this earth amen and notice after that happened to him he was then ready for his ministry amen hallelujah now you are ready for your ministry hallelujah now get away from that thought they have up there once you say ministry thinking preaching amen prophet said i don't care he says your ministry you say you could be a housewife you can be a dishwasher you can be whatever wherever you find yourself you come awake and you find yourself in that part of the body stay right there that's your position stay in your position where you are amen hallelujah praise god hallelujah amen oh my think of it that's future home of the heavenly bright and earthly bride and hallelujah now uh you give me a chance to go on a little more praise god hallelujah hallelujah let me say let me just say it this way see he came down here in that body and he overcome by these fiery trials you overcome every one of them we come also and are trapped in these mortal bodies just as he was but we overcome as he overcame and the prophet gave us that assurance he says don't you understand overcome you overcome by him who already has overcome that is in you you already overcome before you even before the challenge the devil even brings it to you you're already overcome you're ready and overcome god because the one who overcome is in you amen praise god hallelujah remember he will speak and we will come forth all of us i'm quoting him listen just like in the beginning see it was not god's perfect will for children to be born on the earth through sex no see god created man out of the dust and the earth breathe the breath of life into him and he become a living person a living soul hallelujah praise god remember god was supposed to create by his spoken word he was to create by what the seven thunders hallelujah oh my because the perfect word seven calls the bride the seventh thunder calls the bride it's the voice of god sundering fort the prophet said in sweetness calls out the bride of jesus christ amen oh blessed be his name now he took from that man a helpmate and made a wife to him that was god's first and god's original will do you do you have that but when then sin came in and did the thing it did and then god permitted man to marry a wife wife to marry a husband but that was his what permissive will he allowed it but that was not his perfect will right he said the prophet says here and legally you have a right because that is god allowed amen and to have children because he himself said multiply and replenish the earth amen if that's the way you want to do it if that's the way you're going to do it you see then go ahead but that was his permissive will you see that was never his perfect will but we are permitted therefore all these things that had a beginning even that has to come to an end all sin will go to annihilation all sin has to be done away with amen when the resurrection comes you will not have to be born again by your mother or your father but god just like he did in the beginning will call man from the dust of the earth and his help made with him hallelujah praise god hallelujah is he calling is he calling amen see for god never did change or god never changes his mind about his work about his plans whatever he wants to do hallelujah he doesn't change his mind he says here about anything but he will permit the rest of us and permit you to go on see this what you are taking a long way around to get to what you see what god wants now see but i want you to understand this god will permit you to do some things and even bless you while you're doing that but it is still not his perfect will hallelujah praise god oh my i'm going to end uh our talk here today with this last uh these last comments and this last quote that uh came from out of does god ever change his mind about his word and i'm saying this because you may go back listen to this message and you want to go search the word of god and you will find it what i'm saying it's already in the word i will confess his name before my father and all the angels praise god isn't that wonderful listen what he says roll call in heaven oh praise god how many remembers roll call i i don't know if they have it in the schools anymore but i remember a roll call in the school the for you and me when that school bell rings brother bill every one of them children have to run in from the schoolyard oh you're playing we're around and fooling around not to stop amen and you run in and everybody either lines up or everything else and the teacher that teacher stands there typing the church age messenger for every class and they're going to call how many of the students they know they got under them and they have the list and they're going to call their name to see and then you have to answer a present amen hallelujah present present they call your name no answer that person couldn't answer it you know so there's nobody there so the preacher scratches the name off because you're not there oh my praise god well this is this is the picture that he is saying here right praise god just like i tell you when the prophet is speaking he just speaks the word but the the ones ordained to revelation by the holy spirit that one word expands and grows because they see they get a chance to see even some of what he was thinking while he was saying these things right roll call in heaven if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait until my change come oh my god we don't want we're preaching but job now brother but job said that he said when job caught the revelation of it job said i know my redeemer liveth hallelujah and i'm gonna see him oh my oh and those skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i will see god what flesh the same flesh that jesus said come give me the sandwich let me eat it come and touch me and see see if this is not flesh and bones amen hallelujah but not natural it was supernatural it was glorified amen praise god and oh so here it is thou will call and i will answer that will have a desire to the work of thy hand do you see friends the great shepherd is now calling his sheep you believe it come here let me see how many believes my glory god the great shepherd is now calling his sheep and he is calling them by name thank god hallelujah it's not calling a group it's not calling a whole bunch of people there like that but by their individual names and god knows us brother branham says when that seventh shield was open that was the coming of christ and doing what he's calling out your name when the seal opens when it breaks amen he said he's calling your name he says not just saying susan john jim or whatever oh my but whatever name he knows from he had with you before the foundation of the world which was part of the word oh praise god that's why the preacher can come now and preach the word of god certain parts will attract you certain parts will that attracted him will attract you whatever is your portion will attract you is calling them by their name hallelujah and they hear and they answer his call oh praise god god is calling them for what is it the creative voice the same one that was doing the creating of his children from the beginning and he got interrupted he said he'll call them last ones now when he comes again at this time in our day it is now that create the voice of god and it's calling them forth from the dust of the earth just like it was in the beginning oh or or changing their atoms even though they have not fallen asleep they're not dead yet but god will begin to change the atoms hallelujah what is that he said it is the rapture praise god so so are we putting the rapture i don't know up the road somewhere that part of the rapture the event of the rapture this is not the event he's talking about he's talking about the rapture started already it started now and from glory to glory the word is changing you and me and he's getting your pressure rise like he used in another term pressurized he says oh no other bird can go there only eagles can go there and they're being pressurized amen to do what to go from glory to glory to glory step into that theophany and then off to glory as a thief in the night may god bless you all everyone hallelujah what is that he said it's the great mark separate lamb it started on his bride amen what we're feasting on the word right now praise god hallelujah will there be a great marriage supper somewhere in heaven hallelujah maybe there will be but we're talking about right now we are partaking at this word of god and feasting upon it and we can't get enough of it it's the physical body that get tired get bored get upset get this get itchy get scratchy get sweaty get hot or whatever and then we can't we can't listen anymore not because we don't want to but because the devil will use that part of his creation that not creation he can't create but what he has made amen see he will use that influence that manipulate that in every possible way to obstruct to deny to that you cannot receive the word of god is that right but god will work around all of that and i'm so glad that there are some of us here today that have heard that voice and we have answered the call praise god hallelujah we've answered the call of the holy spirit and we are literally represented here today on this in this hour and in this time praise the name of the lord may god bless you everyone praise
