[36:34] God I know tonight we're going to be
[36:36] celebrating this weekend we're going to
[36:38] be celebrating our precious John and
[36:41] Desiree Simon who God has given us in
[36:44] this life but I see something much
[36:47] bigger Hallelujah much greater praise
[36:50] the Lord much much more than what we
[36:52] could ever possibly imagine but just to
[36:55] know that we're a part of it amen just
[36:57] to know that God called us and gave us
[37:01] this representation here amen I want to
[37:04] welcome each and every one of you here
[37:08] tonight um praise God um you know before
[37:11] we get into uh acknowledging so many
[37:15] that are here I want to just acknowledge
[37:19] our Pastor John Simon and sister desire
[37:22] because it's this weekend that we've put
[37:25] together to acknowledge and to celebrate
[37:28] their Ministry amen praise God he might
[37:32] think he's
[37:34] retiring but God's got a greater
[37:38] work because there is no age in
[37:43] God there's no time in God Amen God is
[37:48] God and he's got a program and he's
[37:51] doing something and and John and Desiree
[37:55] they have a huge part and they're still
[37:59] in that plan praise God you know um as I
[38:03] was thinking about it there was two
[38:05] scriptures that came to my
[38:07] mind Jeremiah
[38:10] 3:16 or sorry Jeremiah
[38:12] 3:15 and I will give you pastors
[38:15] according to my
[38:18] heart and that just that just really
[38:20] struck me which shall feed you with
[38:25] knowledge and understanding
[38:28] if there's ever been a Ministry of a
[38:30] true
[38:31] Pastor it is in John
[38:33] Simon because I know and there's many
[38:37] out there that know that are here
[38:40] present now that have been a part of
[38:43] that Ministry years ago and
[38:47] know that God fed them God spoke to them
[38:53] God delivered them you're looking at a
[38:56] living testimony of a total Deliverance
[38:59] of the word of God that came through
[39:02] John
[39:05] Simon and there's many others
[39:08] here in James 4:10 it says humble
[39:11] yourself in the sight of the Lord and He
[39:14] Shall lift you up we are not lifting up
[39:18] our Pastor John Simon and sister Desiree
[39:21] God is declaring his word and how
[39:26] pleased he is
[39:28] with the ministry and the life and the
[39:30] dedication that he gave and that he
[39:33] continues to give amen praise God he's a
[39:38] he's a front runner of the word yet he
[39:40] stayed in the
[39:43] background we were never a Ministry that
[39:45] was pushed up in front of the people he
[39:48] was never a man that was pushed up in
[39:50] front of the
[39:51] people but he was a front runner of this
[39:54] word and this message
[39:57] this weekend we're here to celebrate
[39:59] John and uh John Simon's Ministry in the
[40:02] service of our Lord Jesus Christ for

[55:29] 27th
[55:36] chapter appreciate
[55:38] you it's been a long time since I've
[55:40] seen brother
[55:42] Ro amen and we appreciate him by the
[55:45] name by God's grace it's been a long
[55:47] time
[55:49] and we want
[55:51] to go ahead forward within the word of
[55:54] God tonight
[55:56] Matthew
[56:05] 27
[56:07] amen we're going to start at the 51st
[56:13] verse and behold the veil of the temple
[56:16] was rent in
[56:18] Twain From the top to the
[56:21] bottom and the Earth did quake and the
[56:25] Rocks rent
[56:27] and the graves were opened and many
[56:30] bodies of the Saints which slept
[56:33] arose and came out of the graves after
[56:36] this after his resurrection and went
[56:39] into the holy city and appeared unto
[56:43] many let us pray our gracious father God
[56:47] we thank you for your grace we thank you
[56:50] for your mercy we thank you for all that
[56:53] you have done for us and everything that
[56:55] you doing for us on tonight Lord we pray
[56:59] that you would break the bread of life
[57:00] to us oh God give us what we stand in
[57:03] need of encourage us rebuke us whatever
[57:06] you need to do Lord give us Grace to
[57:09] move completely out of your way in Jesus
[57:11] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[57:19] seated when
[57:21] we think about the last days and we're
[57:26] living in a time where the world is
[57:29] truly falling
[57:32] apart even among the
[57:35] Christian uh people we realize that
[57:40] something strange is
[57:42] happening there are those who are
[57:45] getting closer to
[57:47] God and then there are those who are not
[57:51] so and we realize by the grace of God
[57:53] there is a pull upward
[57:56] and there is a pull
[57:58] downward I would like to entitle this
[58:01] message the veil is
[58:04] rent when I think
[58:08] about what took place
[58:11] there we know that it was
[58:14] necessary for Jesus Christ to
[58:18] die and to raised from the dead had he
[58:22] not done that we would not be here
[58:27] today enjoying his
[58:31] victory uh I thank God
[58:34] for the message of the hour thank you
[58:37] Jesus had not God sent Malachi
[58:41] for uh where would we
[58:44] be but I wanted to say these things to
[58:49] so that we can see that no matter how
[58:52] great the Revelation or Revelations are
[58:57] we must always come back to the place
[59:02] where it was made
[59:04] possible uh we understand the grace of
[59:07] God we understand how in the book The
[59:10] Bible itself was a closed
[59:13] book and everybody couldn't read it and
[59:17] even those who were ordained to read the
[59:20] scriptures were blind by their own
[59:23] traditions and we realize by the grace
[59:26] of God that even when Jesus was
[59:29] crucified oh Satan thought he had gotten
[59:32] the
[59:33] victory uh but he he failed to
[59:36] understand the
[59:37] scripture even so the Bible said had he
[59:40] known the princes of this world had
[59:42] known who he was they would not have
[59:45] crucified
[59:46] him and so we realize by the grace of
[59:49] God when Jesus uh uh uh descended into
[59:54] hell uh you know brother Adam said that
[59:56] when he went to Calvary he went as a man
[59:59] he died as a man and when when he went
[1:00:02] into hell he came to do one thing and
[1:00:05] that was to
[1:00:07] conquer and we realize by the grace of
[1:00:09] God according to the way brother bam
[1:00:12] described it he Satan said oh I got you
[1:00:16] now yeah I wish he I know he wish he
[1:00:18] hadn't had him but he had him right but
[1:00:22] he thought he was the
[1:00:24] Victor but we know know that Jesus came
[1:00:27] and he conquered Satan on his own
[1:00:31] territory I mean he took the keys of
[1:00:33] death hell in the
[1:00:35] grave and brother R said he kicked him
[1:00:37] back inside I like that drama I kind of
[1:00:41] wish it was my
[1:00:43] foot amen but
[1:00:46] nevertheless amen he he he he made an
[1:00:50] open show of his victory praise the Lord
[1:00:53] and you part of it
[1:00:56] Hallelujah see when you see me you don't
[1:00:59] you're not looking at
[1:01:01] defeat you're looking at
[1:01:04] Victory when I look at you knowing what
[1:01:07] this message have gone through many who
[1:01:10] started out with us is no longer here
[1:01:14] hallelujah but you see when you catch
[1:01:17] the truth of the revelation of this
[1:01:20] message you like Peter where else can we
[1:01:23] go Hallelujah amen because we realize by
[1:01:28] the grace of God no matter how much
[1:01:30] Satan has tried to destroy it you cannot
[1:01:34] destroy the true word of
[1:01:37] God hallelujah and God has said he'll
[1:01:40] never come back void now Jesus this is
[1:01:44] what I love it I love about the word
[1:01:46] that that here was Jesus in in in hell
[1:01:49] in the reason of the loss and you know
[1:01:52] he couldn't even resurrect
[1:01:56] here there was an appointed
[1:01:59] time and that time no matter it doesn't
[1:02:02] say what he what all he did now brother
[1:02:04] random said he preached he preached to
[1:02:07] those souls in the ant that was in the
[1:02:09] anal luian day right why didn't you
[1:02:13] believe but however long it took him he
[1:02:16] could not get up
[1:02:19] until he had an appointed time to
[1:02:24] resurrect because the scripture says as
[1:02:27] Jonah was at in the belly of the well so
[1:02:31] sh shall the son of man be Hallelujah
[1:02:35] and then there was another scripture
[1:02:36] says I will not leave your soul in Hell
[1:02:41] neither will I allow your flesh to see
[1:02:44] corruption so he had a time period that
[1:02:47] he could remain in hell you understand
[1:02:50] me he could not even get up if he wanted
[1:02:53] to Hallelujah as a a man he had to wait
[1:02:57] to that appointed
[1:02:59] time now listen the Bible says that when
[1:03:03] the When when when when the when the
[1:03:05] veil was rent the graves were open they
[1:03:09] were open but they couldn't get
[1:03:13] up until see they had an appointed time
[1:03:18] because Jesus had to be the first one
[1:03:20] get up he had to be the first fruit of
[1:03:24] the Resurrection
[1:03:25] and then after he got up they could get
[1:03:28] up y'all understand what I'm saying so
[1:03:32] we
[1:03:33] realize amen as I say all the time
[1:03:36] everything's
[1:03:38] moving by the power of
[1:03:41] God
[1:03:43] hallelujah yeah Lord so
[1:03:46] now people don't understand and they
[1:03:50] looking at this message and say you know
[1:03:52] we've been gone a long time it hadn't
[1:03:55] happened yet
[1:03:56] but what they failed to see is already
[1:03:58] happened
[1:04:00] sir I don't know about you but the Bible
[1:04:02] tells me that when I receive the Holy
[1:04:04] Ghost I am now sitting in Heavenly
[1:04:08] places in Christ Jesus yall understand
[1:04:12] me you said well brother Brooks you
[1:04:13] haven't made it yes I have brother
[1:04:16] Brandon went behind the curtain of time
[1:04:18] and when he went there he saw
[1:04:20] me he saw
[1:04:23] you Hallelujah which was a Vindication
[1:04:26] to me that I have a a a theophany you
[1:04:31] understand me that there is no way that
[1:04:33] I can appear before God naked Hallelujah
[1:04:37] because I have a body but I'm
[1:04:41] waiting for that appointed
[1:04:44] time see here was Jesus many of them saw
[1:04:48] him as Mary's baby or Joseph's baby or
[1:04:53] carpet's son and here he was now being
[1:04:58] crucified by his own people sounds
[1:05:01] familiar and We Know by the grace of God
[1:05:04] that he
[1:05:06] knew these things were to take place he
[1:05:10] wasn't ignorant of it matter of fact
[1:05:13] when he was in the garden of Ed uh in in
[1:05:15] the Garden of Gethsemane he prayed
[1:05:17] father I would that this cup pass from
[1:05:19] me but nevertheless not my will but
[1:05:23] thine be done see that that there
[1:05:25] there's a great uh lesson in this
[1:05:28] because here was the son of God who was
[1:05:31] God cu the Bible said the fullness of
[1:05:34] God the fullness of the godhead dwelt in
[1:05:36] him Hallelujah but here as a man he's he
[1:05:40] had a
[1:05:41] will Hallelujah and he had to take his
[1:05:45] will and bring it to the will of God
[1:05:48] y'all understand me being in the flesh
[1:05:52] because the flesh has a
[1:05:54] will and You' got to kill it Paul said I
[1:05:57] I crucify this old man every
[1:06:00] day Hallelujah you see there's a purpose
[1:06:04] for this there's a walk going
[1:06:06] on my wife and I we we flew here from uh
[1:06:11] uh uh New York and and and we it was to
[1:06:16] to Toronto it was the worst turbulence
[1:06:19] that she and I had ever uh flown
[1:06:22] together you know with uh it was
[1:06:25] terrible
[1:06:26] and and she she she was terrified and uh
[1:06:29] one thing my wife got out of it she said
[1:06:32] to me she said it looks so peaceful from
[1:06:41] here but she says up there there's a war
[1:06:44] going
[1:06:45] [Laughter]
[1:06:47] on Hallelujah that's right you might
[1:06:51] look at me and it it may look peaceful
[1:06:54] but inside
[1:06:57] there's a war going on Hallelujah yes
[1:07:01] sir and I am determined to win the
[1:07:04] battle
[1:07:06] Hallelujah yes
[1:07:08] sir here was Jesus in plain
[1:07:11] view they didn't even know who he was
[1:07:15] they were still making mockery right I
[1:07:17] mean it's amazing that that that they
[1:07:20] couldn't see
[1:07:22] him that's right hanging there amen
[1:07:26] dripping with blood he was the true
[1:07:29] Mercy
[1:07:30] Seat he he was the one that they should
[1:07:32] have turned to but instead they walked
[1:07:35] away from him we realize by the grace of
[1:07:39] God that God intervened I love this
[1:07:42] because when Jesus said father is
[1:07:45] finished and he gave up the ghost it was
[1:07:48] like a amen from God he
[1:07:52] split he he he WR the faing to from top
[1:07:57] to bottom Hallelujah so when Jesus said
[1:08:02] it was finished it was
[1:08:04] finished I don't I'm not concerned about
[1:08:07] making the Rapture or whether I'm saved
[1:08:09] that has already been
[1:08:12] settled Hallelujah and you ought to know
[1:08:16] it's already been set out Hallelujah
[1:08:21] because he rent The Veil he was the only
[1:08:24] one that was qualified to take the book
[1:08:27] out of the right him hand of him who sat
[1:08:30] on the throne the Bible said no man was
[1:08:33] worthy that means me that means you that
[1:08:37] means everybody in here not one man was
[1:08:42] worthy Hallelujah except the
[1:08:45] lamb the bloody lamb Jesus himself was
[1:08:50] the only man worthy you say well brother
[1:08:53] Brooks how you going to make it to
[1:08:54] heaven I made it to Heaven by riding in
[1:08:59] him Hallelujah is that right cuz Paul
[1:09:02] said now my life is hid in Christ Jesus
[1:09:07] that's right I'm accepted into heaven
[1:09:10] only by him because I am accepted in the
[1:09:14] Beloved y'all hear what I'm saying you
[1:09:17] sure what brother Brooks we've heard
[1:09:19] this before it ain't about hearing it in
[1:09:22] your ear it's about hearing it in your
[1:09:24] heart Hallelujah but when you know that
[1:09:28] you've truly been set free some of us
[1:09:30] haven't been set free but the Bible said
[1:09:33] he whom the son is set free is free
[1:09:36] indeed Hallelujah free from what condemn
[1:09:42] Nation Oh my right he hung there they
[1:09:47] looked right at him and then see him
[1:09:50] hidden from them because they were
[1:09:52] blinded the Jews were blinded and of
[1:09:55] course Paul's uh Revelation and and
[1:09:58] words we realize that the Jews were
[1:10:00] blinded for
[1:10:01] us right but now the Gentiles are
[1:10:05] blind y'all hear what I'm saying that
[1:10:08] means the the Gentile age is almost over
[1:10:12] can I say it like that amen and and and
[1:10:15] and once that door is shut yeah brother
[1:10:18] random said not one
[1:10:20] extra only those whose names are written
[1:10:24] on the L Book of
[1:10:26] Life Hallelujah you don't have to worry
[1:10:30] about that why why would you you can't
[1:10:34] do nothing about
[1:10:37] it you might as well enjoy Jesus yall
[1:10:41] understand me so I look at this thing
[1:10:43] and I just believe it I don't know when
[1:10:45] it came to me I was bride but it's a
[1:10:48] revelation I have you see that
[1:10:52] Revelation keeps you from follow
[1:10:54] following
[1:10:55] all these winds and
[1:10:58] doctrines Hallelujah because you
[1:11:00] recognize no man put me in and no man
[1:11:03] can take me
[1:11:04] out hallelujah it's not about your a
[1:11:08] system this is not a system this is
[1:11:12] every individual coming to know Jesus
[1:11:15] Christ for
[1:11:17] themselves Hallelujah this is not a
[1:11:20] group
[1:11:22] Revelation some I was telling my church
[1:11:24] I was telling my church I said you know
[1:11:26] what you got Baptists who are Baptist
[1:11:28] because they go to a Baptist Church you
[1:11:31] got message people who claim to be
[1:11:32] message because they go to a message
[1:11:34] church and that's that's
[1:11:38] false that's false because you go to a
[1:11:41] message Church don't make you part of
[1:11:43] it Hallelujah you got to come into
[1:11:47] Christ hallelujah it's about being in
[1:11:52] him Hallelujah you love the Lord see
[1:11:55] that's what the Jews messed up they
[1:11:57] thought because they were Jews that
[1:11:59] settled it but no sir it didn't matter
[1:12:02] whether you was a Pharisees sadducee
[1:12:04] herodian it doesn't matter Jesus said
[1:12:07] except you believe that I am
[1:12:11] he Hallelujah they can say whatever they
[1:12:14] want to say about Malachi 4 Hallelujah
[1:12:17] except you
[1:12:19] believe that he is he now you say oh
[1:12:23] what brother explain that way
[1:12:25] he was human
[1:12:27] flesh but that was God
[1:12:31] manifested in that flesh the son of man
[1:12:35] right amen a son of man revealing the
[1:12:39] son of man Hallelujah but many people
[1:12:42] missed
[1:12:46] that Hallelujah that day Jesus was the
[1:12:49] mighty conqueror Hallelujah is that
[1:12:53] right and it proved moved it amen
[1:12:56] because he was the only one that was
[1:12:59] able to take the book but it doesn't
[1:13:01] stop
[1:13:02] there he says unto John you take the
[1:13:05] book and eat it all
[1:13:08] up Hallelujah he didn't say smack at it
[1:13:12] he said eat it all
[1:13:15] up and that John represents the bride I
[1:13:19] don't want part of the message I want
[1:13:21] all of the message Hallelujah now how
[1:13:24] I'm going going to get all of the
[1:13:26] message by taking what the prophet said
[1:13:30] and looking through the UR thurm yes sir
[1:13:32] Hallelujah you said why would you do
[1:13:34] that because he declared the book is now
[1:13:38] open y'all understand me shadows and
[1:13:41] types and all the things that that once
[1:13:44] was a mystery is now
[1:13:47] available Hallelujah don't be afraid
[1:13:51] that's right a lot of time we afraid of
[1:13:53] uh how brother them call it the doomed
[1:13:58] Devils the devils are doomed they know
[1:14:01] all about it why would we be afraid of
[1:14:04] them Hallelujah when we know what we
[1:14:07] have y'all hear what I'm saying you know
[1:14:09] what I'm trying to do I'm trying to take
[1:14:12] the responsibility of your salvation off
[1:14:14] of your
[1:14:16] shoulder and put it on his shoulder
[1:14:19] because the Bible said the government
[1:14:21] shall be upon his shoulder not yours his
[1:14:26] and when you can see that you're
[1:14:28] free and when you can understand what
[1:14:31] God has done for you then your joy will
[1:14:35] increase Hallelujah that's the truth
[1:14:38] people are sad because they don't
[1:14:41] understand who they really are
[1:14:44] Hallelujah but once that seven Thunder
[1:14:47] miss you or that seven seal mystery
[1:14:49] strike your soul then you become the
[1:14:52] word right
[1:14:55] yes sir Hallelujah you love the
[1:14:59] Lord hallelujah the Lord is so good to
[1:15:02] us I I I have a few quotes and I hope
[1:15:05] that's okay he said I tell you when you
[1:15:08] break that traditional barrier see that
[1:15:11] Jesus is way back and he he isn't now
[1:15:14] you know how people say like I try to
[1:15:16] tell people at my church your revelation
[1:15:18] of Jesus Christ is your
[1:15:22] strength if Jesus is not the same
[1:15:25] yesterday today and forever in your life
[1:15:28] you've got a weak
[1:15:32] Jesus that's right he is the same he
[1:15:37] cannot
[1:15:38] change Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[1:15:42] Jesus Christ of the
[1:15:44] new Hallelujah and when you can I say
[1:15:48] see that but I mean receive that
[1:15:51] understand it here not here you become a
[1:15:56] Victor Hallelujah why because you
[1:15:59] realize that you are now just a model of
[1:16:04] of what Jesus wants he wants to act his
[1:16:08] life out through you Hallelujah and no
[1:16:11] matter what it is whether it's the
[1:16:14] experiences in the valley or whether
[1:16:16] it's on the on on a Mountaintop wherever
[1:16:19] it may be you say Lord not my
[1:16:22] will but thine be done
[1:16:25] Hallelujah is that all right see when
[1:16:28] you find out he's the same yesterday
[1:16:30] today and forever there's no limit to
[1:16:32] what God could do right here in this
[1:16:37] convention hallelujah it's the truth sir
[1:16:40] people think oh I got to feel a m
[1:16:42] rushian win you don't have to feel no no
[1:16:44] might rushian
[1:16:46] win Jesus said in that day you'll know
[1:16:50] that I'm in the Father the father's in
[1:16:52] me and I am in you
[1:16:56] Hallelujah have you ever felt how can I
[1:16:59] say it like have you how do you know
[1:17:01] your heart is in
[1:17:05] you you've never seen your
[1:17:08] heart but it's in there hallelujah amen
[1:17:13] and let me say it like how do you know
[1:17:14] cuz sometimes you can feel it
[1:17:17] beaten and that's how it is with God
[1:17:20] when God is in there you'll know it
[1:17:25] you understand me and when you packing
[1:17:27] God let let me say it like this because
[1:17:30] when I think about him and sometime the
[1:17:33] devil tried to take it from me but when
[1:17:34] I think about how magnificent he
[1:17:38] is he created the heavens he created the
[1:17:42] Earth he created the universe and as the
[1:17:44] prophet said nothing is out of beat or
[1:17:48] time and then we think to
[1:17:51] ourselves is he strong enough to handle
[1:17:54] my battle
[1:17:57] let me tell you something he created
[1:18:02] it he started it and he knows how to
[1:18:06] finish it Hallelujah whenever God puts
[1:18:11] you through a battle he's expecting you
[1:18:13] to come out as a
[1:18:16] winner
[1:18:17] Hallelujah yes sir I don't care what it
[1:18:21] is he expects you
[1:18:25] that's the
[1:18:26] truth that is the truth than Lord
[1:18:29] hallelujah you know and and this is why
[1:18:32] when people don't understand I I say it
[1:18:34] like
[1:18:35] this when when the Old Testament dealt
[1:18:38] with the
[1:18:39] law you know the law we might look at it
[1:18:42] in this day of Grace like oh that's just
[1:18:44] too much but you got to realize that God
[1:18:47] gave them the law just to protect them
[1:18:50] that's right it wasn't like he put it
[1:18:52] there to imprison them but he put it
[1:18:55] there to protect them all those filthy
[1:18:58] Nations that they had out there all
[1:19:01] kinds of aeral diseases and all kind see
[1:19:04] it was a lot going
[1:19:06] on that's why God said don't don't
[1:19:10] mingle with that A little leaven leav
[1:19:13] the whole lump y'all understand me but
[1:19:16] see this is how it is and this is the
[1:19:19] the devil's program being in the message
[1:19:23] may even look boring to some
[1:19:26] compared to what the churches out there
[1:19:30] doing y'all understand me and somehow
[1:19:34] that Hollywood Swinging
[1:19:37] stuff seemed to appear to the
[1:19:41] flesh Hallelujah it was that that then
[1:19:45] when Israel with Moab and all of the
[1:19:49] others out there see when they had
[1:19:52] Church they had Church
[1:19:55] yeah but it involved a lot of Filth
[1:19:59] y'all hear what I'm saying and here was
[1:20:01] Israel look like they locked down Thou
[1:20:05] shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not
[1:20:08] they didn't understand it so but when
[1:20:11] they would get into these kinds of
[1:20:14] Acts they seem to forget
[1:20:17] God you understand me they got into Idol
[1:20:21] worshiping and all of these things are I
[1:20:25] didn't mean to go this way but this is
[1:20:26] the way he's got me going see
[1:20:29] listen and and what happened is God was
[1:20:32] trying to get a a pure seed keep it
[1:20:36] clean keep it pure Hallelujah it it
[1:20:40] wasn't the people it was what they were
[1:20:42] worshiping how they were worshiping that
[1:20:45] God wanted to keep them away from it
[1:20:48] Hallelujah now we see the same thing
[1:20:53] happening even Among Us yes Hallelujah
[1:20:58] we look at them and say if they can do
[1:21:00] it we can do it but we need to stop that
[1:21:03] foolishness God has set the order of
[1:21:07] worship for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:11] and we need to stay with that
[1:21:14] order don't look around don't get out of
[1:21:18] Step see because let me say it like this
[1:21:21] there's nothing you can do to save
[1:21:26] yourself you're already
[1:21:29] saved is that the truth yes sir the
[1:21:31] prophet of God said before the
[1:21:33] foundation of the world he not only
[1:21:35] called you he elected you he chose you
[1:21:37] he put your name in the book the blood
[1:21:39] was shed for you way before you even
[1:21:41] came into Consciousness hallelujah oh my
[1:21:44] God so no matter how big the threat
[1:21:49] is can't stop
[1:21:52] this you love the Lord
[1:21:55] when people get hungry in their hearts
[1:21:58] there's a veil ready to be broken and
[1:22:01] I'm going tell you like this if you're
[1:22:03] not careful you'll think that you got
[1:22:06] the real
[1:22:07] Goods but you need to make sure you do
[1:22:10] have them you understand me because we
[1:22:13] have been called in this hour to be the
[1:22:15] Tabernacle of God hallelujah and like I
[1:22:19] tell my my my my church at home God
[1:22:22] don't live in a duplex
[1:22:25] hallelujah it's a one room
[1:22:28] house Hallelujah there ain't no two
[1:22:31] Thrones in this this chamber there's
[1:22:34] only one throne and he is the one that
[1:22:37] sits on that
[1:22:38] Throne Hallelujah now the thing is
[1:22:42] you're the greatest enemy you are your
[1:22:45] greatest
[1:22:47] enemy and God has to conquer you you say
[1:22:50] what yeah the devil's been conquered
[1:22:52] over 2,000 years ago you're the one that
[1:22:55] needs to be
[1:22:58] conquered Hallelujah is that all right
[1:23:02] it's nothing but the truth you know a
[1:23:04] lot of time we say well Lord why did you
[1:23:06] let me this happen to me no you failed
[1:23:09] the
[1:23:11] test let's move
[1:23:14] on See Jesus still stands among the
[1:23:18] among the people tonight Hallelujah and
[1:23:21] he's here to conquer your traditions
[1:23:25] y'all love that because everybody's got
[1:23:28] them I I was thinking the other day I
[1:23:30] said oh my God the work Paul had moving
[1:23:34] from Judaism into christianism and he
[1:23:37] had to deal with
[1:23:38] Gentiles my God didn't call us dogs for
[1:23:43] nothing see L literally I I don't know
[1:23:47] about brother John Simon but I've had my
[1:23:50] church had me on my knees crying
[1:23:54] not because they hurt my feelings
[1:23:57] because I'm crying out for their
[1:24:00] souls y'all got quiet on that
[1:24:04] one y'all don't know what a pastor goes
[1:24:07] through God bless him he's made it long
[1:24:10] enough to even
[1:24:13] retire praise the Lord amen God bless
[1:24:18] you brother brother Smith how are you
[1:24:21] amen I had brain freeze when I was
[1:24:23] calling earlier but still God is good to
[1:24:25] us isn't he no matter how people do and
[1:24:28] how they act you know I I'll say it by
[1:24:31] the grace of God God stands among his
[1:24:34] people you got to realize that how can
[1:24:37] you get rid of God anybody knows how to
[1:24:39] get rid of
[1:24:41] it the psalmist says I'll make my bed in
[1:24:43] hell Thou Art
[1:24:45] there he's always here but we fail to
[1:24:49] recognize who he is oh Lord have mercy
[1:24:53] upon us right
[1:24:55] really what was behind the veil brother
[1:24:57] let me go back to where I started what
[1:24:59] was behind the veil and and I'm not
[1:25:02] going to name off all of the the the
[1:25:04] symbols that was there the chairs and
[1:25:06] all but what was behind the
[1:25:08] veil was the allmighty
[1:25:11] god let's just go to the spiritual
[1:25:14] aspect of
[1:25:15] it we call it the holies of
[1:25:19] holies and we understand by by the word
[1:25:22] that there was there was only one one
[1:25:24] person or priest that could go back
[1:25:26] there was and that priest was the high
[1:25:28] priest and that was once a
[1:25:29] year but when that veil was
[1:25:33] rent that that's when God opened his arm
[1:25:36] and said whosoever will let him
[1:25:38] come now you got to realize amen that
[1:25:42] behind the veil was not only the
[1:25:45] anointing but it was the
[1:25:46] word and that word amen that that was
[1:25:50] delivered by
[1:25:51] Moses was kept for thousands of
[1:25:55] years Hallelujah and and it showed by
[1:25:59] the grace of God God had it written in
[1:26:01] stone to show you that the word can
[1:26:03] never change no matter how you think
[1:26:06] it's going to change it can never change
[1:26:09] Hallelujah but that
[1:26:12] anointing that power of God Amen was
[1:26:16] given amen at that time of of Pentecost
[1:26:19] because what God was doing was
[1:26:21] restoring because you got to realize by
[1:26:24] the grace of God when Adam and Eve fell
[1:26:27] they literally changed the dimensional
[1:26:33] World Hallelujah there's a Time Adam
[1:26:37] could hear God and God could hear Adam
[1:26:40] that's right but that that sin brought a
[1:26:44] breach something happened Hallelujah and
[1:26:48] we realize by the grace of God God the
[1:26:51] elect of God those who are of God God
[1:26:54] had had a place for them we call it
[1:26:57] under the altar Hallelujah it was once
[1:27:01] paradise and that paradise was split in
[1:27:04] two that was for the rich man y'all know
[1:27:07] how that was and it was for for for the
[1:27:10] the the the beggar that was there you
[1:27:13] know and they could commune or talk or
[1:27:18] see how it was but after the
[1:27:21] resurrection something happened
[1:27:26] and things began to
[1:27:28] move back in his
[1:27:30] position and you got to realize that
[1:27:33] here was Jesus the Chief
[1:27:35] Cornerstone he was the one that was
[1:27:37] going to operate everything and bring it
[1:27:39] back to his proper place why do you
[1:27:41] think when the seals were
[1:27:44] open brother random said it took us
[1:27:49] back to the Garden of
[1:27:52] Eden before the
[1:27:56] fall now I believe
[1:27:59] that and I believe that if you really do
[1:28:02] believe that you can glean from
[1:28:07] that Hallelujah now listen to way he
[1:28:10] says it he says before the fall so if
[1:28:15] you put yourself in that position you
[1:28:18] stand holy before
[1:28:20] God there is no sin in your life
[1:28:25] you stand powerful before God you become
[1:28:29] a
[1:28:30] messiah you become oh my God you become
[1:28:34] an AM to God that's who you
[1:28:38] are it can't be just
[1:28:41] here it's got to be
[1:28:44] here oh God help us here because I I
[1:28:48] found out that among my people if I
[1:28:51] could say it like that I struggled for
[1:28:55] years trying to help them
[1:28:58] see what I knew they did could not
[1:29:01] see and then you know I had a few
[1:29:03] Witnesses come to me and say you know
[1:29:05] what these people just need to be
[1:29:10] saved I'm trying to teach a message when
[1:29:14] they need acts
[1:29:17] 238 you understand me and you find that
[1:29:21] all among the churches people belong to
[1:29:24] message churches but that don't mean
[1:29:26] they're in the
[1:29:27] message Hallelujah and we preach to them
[1:29:31] like they in the message and they're
[1:29:32] scratching their head like what does he
[1:29:35] mean you understand me because he hasn't
[1:29:38] yet been born an
[1:29:40] eagle and you got to be born of Eagle I
[1:29:44] can't teach that to
[1:29:47] you glory to God right so we're in this
[1:29:51] time and and we're celebrating I'm
[1:29:53] celebrating I have I haven't gotten to
[1:29:54] the Celebration part yet but I'm
[1:29:57] celebrating amen what God has
[1:30:02] done in this
[1:30:04] ministry as I know some of the
[1:30:07] testimonies how how how the Lord allowed
[1:30:10] our brother John to be able to present
[1:30:13] Jesus to you yes sir you say you can't
[1:30:17] give nothing you don't
[1:30:19] have you got to have it to give
[1:30:22] it Hal Hallelujah and so we realize by
[1:30:26] the grace of God here God in this
[1:30:28] ministry you say has the brother been
[1:30:30] perfect he hasn't but you don't know
[1:30:33] it he hasn't but you don't know it cuz
[1:30:37] you looked at the false of the man you
[1:30:39] looked that things God don't look at
[1:30:42] right Hallelujah and you better be glad
[1:30:44] for your sake he
[1:30:46] doesn't Halle y'all hear me you can't be
[1:30:50] holy and Unholy at the same time
[1:30:54] you can't be a sinner and a saint you
[1:30:57] either one or the
[1:30:59] other Hallelujah and one thing I know
[1:31:02] about the Lord Jesus Christ he's does
[1:31:04] not he does not vindicate a
[1:31:07] lie hallelujah what is it we got I don't
[1:31:10] mean no how but I got to say it we got
[1:31:13] such cheap
[1:31:16] imitations of Jesus
[1:31:20] Christ I call them fake AI
[1:31:29] because you know they can say well
[1:31:31] brother brand say You must love your
[1:31:33] brother but ask him what is love and ask
[1:31:37] him do you love your
[1:31:39] brother but see a computer can answer
[1:31:41] that a computer can tell you amen what
[1:31:45] it it it's been programmed to say and
[1:31:48] that's what's happened to a lot of us
[1:31:51] we've been programmed to say but do you
[1:31:54] know
[1:31:56] him do you know him Paul said I don't
[1:32:00] want to know nothing except Jesus Christ
[1:32:03] and him crucified I want to know him in
[1:32:06] his suffering and I want to know him in
[1:32:08] his
[1:32:09] resurrection
[1:32:11] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my
[1:32:15] God if we could get the people to see
[1:32:18] that there is a real
[1:32:21] life some people I'm going tell you
[1:32:23] something I've seen God baptized people
[1:32:25] with the Holy Ghost and I didn't I never
[1:32:27] had to preach to them any kind of
[1:32:28] doctrine of what to wear and what not to
[1:32:34] wear cuz when you get the real
[1:32:37] deal the Holy Ghost will tell
[1:32:40] you is that right and when the preacher
[1:32:43] says it you say amen hallelujah but you
[1:32:47] see people struggling they're not there
[1:32:50] yet oh but I saw them shouting I saw
[1:32:52] them dancing I saw them speaking
[1:32:53] speaking in tongues they're not there
[1:32:55] yet Pentecost did that ain't that
[1:32:59] amazing and they call themselves
[1:33:01] Apostolic but never got up to that
[1:33:05] place help us
[1:33:08] Jesus see we call ourselves message but
[1:33:10] we got a place to come up to y'all
[1:33:13] understand me the real life of Jesus
[1:33:16] Christ the real word
[1:33:19] manifested is is who the bride is she's
[1:33:22] not a fake she can't help
[1:33:25] herself I love that she can't help
[1:33:29] herself it's what she
[1:33:31] is hallelujah you know I was telling
[1:33:34] somebody I said you know how people say
[1:33:36] you know you too
[1:33:40] sheepish I'm a
[1:33:45] sheep it's my
[1:33:47] nature Hallelujah you know what I'm
[1:33:50] saying you you you're fnati you're too
[1:33:52] much of a Christian I'm a Christian it's
[1:33:55] my nature to be like
[1:33:58] Christ hey Hallelujah glory to God so we
[1:34:04] realize by the grace of God people want
[1:34:05] you to be what they are no sir I can't
[1:34:09] help it to be what the nature that's in
[1:34:12] me Hallelujah is that right that's why
[1:34:15] they couldn't understand the prophet of
[1:34:17] God because he was another nature he
[1:34:19] wasn't a denominational seed he was a
[1:34:22] word seed that's why why they don't
[1:34:24] understand you because you don't have a
[1:34:26] denominational brand on
[1:34:30] you you like a woman with no
[1:34:38] name huh but we do have a name is called
[1:34:41] the word of
[1:34:44] God you say brother Bo what are you
[1:34:46] talking about you know when the prophet
[1:34:48] of God went across the uh he had that
[1:34:51] vision of coming before when they was
[1:34:54] giving out
[1:34:56] rewards and they called William
[1:34:59] brandom he said oh I wasn't aware that I
[1:35:01] was supposed to go through
[1:35:04] this you know what I'm saying he said he
[1:35:07] started walking and all of a sudden his
[1:35:10] first wife grabbed his arm and his
[1:35:12] second wife grabbed the other arm well
[1:35:15] God never called their name yet he
[1:35:20] did cuz when he called William brandham
[1:35:23] he called them
[1:35:25] too because they were married to him
[1:35:29] yeah that's why the Bible said the whole
[1:35:32] family of Heaven and Earth is named
[1:35:34] after
[1:35:36] him oh somebody help me
[1:35:40] here is that right God couldn't destroy
[1:35:43] Sarah because what
[1:35:48] Abraham and when you see these things
[1:35:52] you realize
[1:35:54] no matter how what kind of tactic Satan
[1:35:57] formed against me I understand it now no
[1:36:01] weapon formed against me shall prosper
[1:36:05] hallelujah it's because of who I am it's
[1:36:09] because of who you
[1:36:10] are that's when that veil was rent the
[1:36:15] revelation of God
[1:36:19] overflowed
[1:36:21] see it's it's it's amazing
[1:36:24] how people struggle and and I said well
[1:36:27] if William Brandon wasn't the Elijah of
[1:36:29] this day we might as well look for
[1:36:30] another but we don't have
[1:36:36] time the world is falling
[1:36:39] apart y'all understand but if if he
[1:36:42] didn't introduce us to the
[1:36:46] Messiah wait a minute he introduced us
[1:36:50] to the Messiah John the B introduced the
[1:36:54] Jews to the Messiah and the Elijah of
[1:36:57] this day introduced us to the
[1:37:00] [Applause]
[1:37:02] Messiah Hallelujah that was him in
[1:37:06] 63 oh come on
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:10] somebody people can say whatever they
[1:37:12] want to say I remember when I was a boy
[1:37:14] a little boy I was out there playing
[1:37:16] football and a white man I may have
[1:37:18] testified about this a white man came in
[1:37:20] my neighborhood well that was not
[1:37:24] the usual thing normally if they came it
[1:37:27] was on the
[1:37:28] weekends collecting
[1:37:30] insurance or a Milkman or the
[1:37:38] policeman that's the
[1:37:40] truth but I remember when I was a boy we
[1:37:43] was out there playing and this white man
[1:37:45] came to me with the Life
[1:37:47] Magazine
[1:37:49] oh and he opened the
[1:37:51] book he said can you see the Lord he
[1:37:54] said the Lord is soon to come now I
[1:37:56] don't know who it was but I do know
[1:37:58] Willam Brandon was in town during that
[1:38:00] time in South Carolina I don't know but
[1:38:03] the man had on a black suit white shirt
[1:38:05] and black tie I don't know I can't
[1:38:07] remember the face but I do know one
[1:38:09] thing this man opened that book and out
[1:38:11] of those boys I was the only one that
[1:38:13] could see that cloud and you know what
[1:38:16] he did when I said oh I can see it I can
[1:38:18] see it that was my almost exact response
[1:38:21] you know what the man did Clos the book
[1:38:23] walked off and I never seen that book
[1:38:25] again until I came into this
[1:38:28] message now I that's my
[1:38:31] testimony that's my testimony and let me
[1:38:34] say it like this how often I mean what
[1:38:37] is the ratio of that ever
[1:38:43] happening that's all I'm saying see one
[1:38:46] thing I know about me and I know about
[1:38:49] you those who are
[1:38:50] truly called of God you are the
[1:38:55] invisible
[1:38:58] script you are the ones that are living
[1:39:00] this message out even in your lives now
[1:39:04] you may not be casting out Devils but
[1:39:06] you living the life amen you understand
[1:39:09] me everybody ain't ordained to cast out
[1:39:12] devils like everybody ain't ain't
[1:39:13] ordained to fast y'all know that one
[1:39:16] don't
[1:39:20] you so I'm just saying by the grace of
[1:39:23] God you have been ordained for certain
[1:39:25] things in your life recognize what it is
[1:39:28] and be
[1:39:30] happy but we were looking at everything
[1:39:33] else and God said don't look at every
[1:39:34] listen the Bible say don't examine your
[1:39:36] brother the Bible said examine yourself
[1:39:39] see whether you be in the
[1:39:42] faith
[1:39:44] hallelujah oh the Living Word of God is
[1:39:47] now on display and everybody think we
[1:39:50] supposed to be acting like Pentecostals
[1:39:53] you're beyond
[1:39:56] that that's all I'm trying to tell you
[1:40:00] you got something they don't have and
[1:40:02] that is life and let me tell you like
[1:40:05] this amen we needed the message we
[1:40:08] needed the opening of the word because
[1:40:11] that was the only way the veil to the
[1:40:12] soul could be
[1:40:16] open people say I had the Holy Ghost way
[1:40:18] before I'm not saying you
[1:40:21] didn't but I'm going tell I tell you
[1:40:23] what there was another room that needed
[1:40:25] God needed to go
[1:40:29] into is that the truth and only this
[1:40:32] message could have told us that cuz I
[1:40:36] was
[1:40:38] Apostolic and I thought I had it all of
[1:40:45] it y'all better hear me but one day I
[1:40:49] realized the power I thought I had was
[1:40:52] dis appearing and I remember what he
[1:40:55] said to me I'll never leave you nor will
[1:40:58] I forsake
[1:40:59] you and if he's leaving me something's
[1:41:03] wrong glory to God see you can't take
[1:41:06] that you got to have a birth in this
[1:41:09] [Applause]
[1:41:16] message I was telling somebody the other
[1:41:18] day I said brother bam said say it just
[1:41:21] like I said
[1:41:23] and people don't even know what he
[1:41:27] meant he well how you going to tell you
[1:41:29] don't be a parent don't be a bird a par
[1:41:32] key and just
[1:41:34] repeat it's like AI
[1:41:37] right don't just
[1:41:39] repeat understand what I'm
[1:41:42] saying re see every quote however you
[1:41:45] quote it has to have a revelation behind
[1:41:48] it Hallelujah you don't understand this
[1:41:51] thing intellectually you understand it
[1:41:54] by Revelation and Upon This Rock I build
[1:41:57] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[1:42:00] not
[1:42:01] Prevail Hallelujah Jesus made a lie this
[1:42:05] is where we supposed to be in a time
[1:42:08] this is the time that Jesus is supposed
[1:42:11] to be made alive in you you are the
[1:42:13] light of the world Hallelujah Elohim
[1:42:17] dwelling in you you're the ones
[1:42:20] Hallelujah is that right she is the word
[1:42:23] and I know you've heard these things but
[1:42:25] it ain't just hearing it's manifestation
[1:42:29] time when I see the blood I'll pass over
[1:42:33] you amen and we know the blood of this
[1:42:36] day is the life of the blood when I see
[1:42:39] the life of the blood I'll pass over you
[1:42:42] I say that again when I see the life of
[1:42:44] the blood in you I'll pass over you the
[1:42:48] foolish version thought they had the
[1:42:50] blood but see that it has to go down to
[1:42:52] the soul Soul it's the soul that sinth
[1:42:55] shall surely die and this down in the
[1:42:58] soul is where life comes it is God's
[1:43:01] temple in the soul y'all understand that
[1:43:05] I'm not saying people are not saved I'm
[1:43:07] talking my bride right now yeah there'll
[1:43:10] be a lot of folks come
[1:43:12] up yes that'll be saved but when it
[1:43:15] comes to bride she's got to go through
[1:43:18] every one of the cours courts she's got
[1:43:21] to meet God but behind the veil is that
[1:43:25] right you know and I know it was one
[1:43:27] time illegal unlawful Amen to to for
[1:43:32] mankind to go behind the veil especially
[1:43:35] if he wasn't appointed to do so it was
[1:43:38] automatic death but since
[1:43:42] Calvary since Calvary sir amen it is
[1:43:46] death if you don't go back there
[1:43:49] Hallelujah and the only way you can get
[1:43:52] there is to die
[1:43:55] there you got to
[1:43:59] die if Jesus had to die for you to be
[1:44:04] free you must die in order to Be Free
[1:44:09] Die to what all your Traditions oh and
[1:44:12] we got a plenty of those we won't even
[1:44:13] go there but the Bible says whatsoever
[1:44:16] you do in word or deed do it all what in
[1:44:18] the name of Jesus giving thanks to God
[1:44:21] and the father by him think about what
[1:44:23] we do during the day can you do it all
[1:44:26] in the name of
[1:44:30] Jesus I'm laughing like you now that's
[1:44:34] the truth that's the truth we all come
[1:44:38] short but by the grace of
[1:44:40] God he's Justified us and this is what I
[1:44:45] love about the Lord Jesus when he sets
[1:44:47] you free you are
[1:44:48] free Hallelujah now the the Bible says
[1:44:52] this that the whole family of Heaven and
[1:44:54] Earth is named after him right and and
[1:44:57] and and and and the whole thing is about
[1:44:59] this mystery as Paul said is to make men
[1:45:02] all men see what is the Fellowship of
[1:45:05] the
[1:45:06] mystery you what this it's not just a
[1:45:09] mystery but it's supposed to be
[1:45:12] Fellowship right fellowshipping in this
[1:45:15] mystery and in other words whatever God
[1:45:18] say you are you say
[1:45:21] amen that's the truth
[1:45:23] if he says you are an invincible
[1:45:26] Army
[1:45:28] amen if he says you are without spot
[1:45:30] wrinkle of
[1:45:32] blemish amen if he says you're a
[1:45:36] messiah amen is that right if he says
[1:45:40] you're
[1:45:42] omnipotent amen see some of us you
[1:45:46] looking at your
[1:45:48] flesh your flesh will never be
[1:45:50] omnipotent sir
[1:45:53] amen he's talking about your soul the
[1:45:56] thing that makes you
[1:45:58] operate and I'm going to tell you what
[1:46:00] the the problem the problem with most
[1:46:03] people say Lord I want to be desperate
[1:46:05] but if you don't love him you'll never
[1:46:06] be
[1:46:07] desperate Love Makes You
[1:46:10] desperate you understand me love for
[1:46:13] Jesus Christ will make you
[1:46:16] desperate and if you don't love him
[1:46:18] you'll never get
[1:46:20] desperate Lord I want I want desperation
[1:46:22] I I got to make it you got to love him
[1:46:25] why do you want to make
[1:46:27] it let me move on by the grace of God
[1:46:30] the Bible says set your affection on
[1:46:31] things above and not on things of the
[1:46:33] earth is that right so what are we doing
[1:46:36] setting our affection on heaven in
[1:46:37] Heavenly places it says therefore put to
[1:46:40] death what belongs to your Earthly
[1:46:42] nature put to death your sexual
[1:46:45] immorality your impurity Your Lust your
[1:46:48] evil desires and Creed witches idolatry
[1:46:51] put them to death Lord how I'm going to
[1:46:53] put him to death down on my
[1:46:57] knees can I get a
[1:46:59] witness I shouldn't have to ask for
[1:47:02] it but that's how we do it prayer I'm
[1:47:07] almost done I'm
[1:47:08] coming when when I look at this thing
[1:47:12] this is this is how the the prophet God
[1:47:14] says I'm identified with a group that
[1:47:18] knows he's unveiled
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:23] Hallelujah you see and and when you see
[1:47:26] that the word has been unveiled that
[1:47:28] what we experience in this day was Jesus

[1:53:37] that right he's the same yesterday today
[1:53:39] and forever is that all right it's
[1:53:41] unveiled I I can't preach it like I want
[1:53:43] to but I'll tell you like
[1:53:46] this coming to
[1:53:48] see what the message has meant to me
[1:53:51] there were things in my life I thought I
[1:53:53] could never
[1:53:54] overcome even as a
[1:53:57] Pentecostal Apostolic whatever you call
[1:53:59] us oh I could shout I could dance I
[1:54:01] could speak in tongues run up and down
[1:54:02] the aisle the only thing I didn't do was
[1:54:04] a
[1:54:06] cartwheel I wanted
[1:54:10] to but I didn't want to hurt myself
[1:54:13] either I'm just being
[1:54:19] honest amen but by the grace of God
[1:54:24] oh man I tell you what he's still the
[1:54:26] same God and you know the prophet of God
[1:54:29] said it was Christ in Moses it was
[1:54:31] Christ in Joshua it was Christ in Jesus
[1:54:36] and it's Christ in his church and it's
[1:54:38] Christ in
[1:54:40] you but the Satan will always keep you
[1:54:43] down until you come to recognize he's in
[1:54:46] you and he not he because you don't feel
[1:54:49] him don't mean he's not there
[1:54:52] sometimes your body will be racked in
[1:54:54] pain you don't feel like speaking in
[1:54:57] tongues huh but you got to know he's
[1:55:00] there you got to know you got to know
[1:55:04] you can't fear the devil that's what he
[1:55:06] wants you to
[1:55:07] do no sir no ma'am I'm almost done just
[1:55:11] give me a
[1:55:12] minute I'm alone with the preacher if I
[1:55:15] don't be careful I'll be here you know
[1:55:16] how that works but uh so I'm trying to
[1:55:19] trying to we at a place where the Bible
[1:55:22] says says this Kingdom cannot be
[1:55:25] removed you know what I'm saying once
[1:55:27] you in the Kingdom you're in the
[1:55:30] kingdom and Satan's job is to keep you
[1:55:33] away from being getting there but a word
[1:55:37] of of uh
[1:55:39] encouragement he
[1:55:42] can't if God has predestinated you if
[1:55:46] God has chosen you to be
[1:55:48] bride there's nothing he can do to stop
[1:55:51] you
[1:55:53] it it's just how can I say it it's like
[1:55:56] being born well they trying so bad
[1:55:58] nowadays trying to change a man into
[1:55:59] something else but if you're born a
[1:56:03] man but if you're born a man you're a
[1:56:06] man I don't care how you fix it up shape
[1:56:08] it up cut it
[1:56:10] up the truth of the matter is your DNA
[1:56:14] is going to show you what you really are
[1:56:22] I didn't even mean to say all of
[1:56:26] that you know what I'm saying listen we
[1:56:28] are a Time the Bible said my sheep
[1:56:30] heareth my voice and a stranger they
[1:56:33] will not
[1:56:35] follow and I always try to tell people I
[1:56:37] said well then where was the
[1:56:40] voice but that voice wasn't wasn't it
[1:56:43] wasn't there to remain in William
[1:56:45] brandham or Elijah however you want to
[1:56:47] put it I have to say that name sometime
[1:56:50] because if I don't y'all going to think
[1:56:51] I'm not in the message
[1:56:55] and you know what that is
[1:56:59] tradition if I don't say Jesus Christ
[1:57:02] then you need to be wondering what I'm
[1:57:04] preaching
[1:57:07] about but anyway we look at these things
[1:57:09] and we find out by the grace of God and
[1:57:12] I'm I'm going quick cuz I'm I'm I can
[1:57:13] feel it
[1:57:14] moving but let me let me my
[1:57:19] she he gave me permission so set you
[1:57:22] know fasten your seat belts no to be
[1:57:25] truthful let's move
[1:57:27] on my sheep hears my
[1:57:31] voice but that voice is supposed to be
[1:57:33] in you
[1:57:36] now because the voice is the
[1:57:38] word and you've been commissioned to go
[1:57:42] look for the
[1:57:44] Sheep right you have been commissioned
[1:57:47] so when you preach or when you speak
[1:57:49] it's the same voice see brother brandom
[1:57:53] didn't have another Holy Ghost there's
[1:57:56] only
[1:57:57] one and when you get the Holy Ghost it's
[1:57:59] the same Holy
[1:58:00] Ghost now you might be commissioned to
[1:58:03] do something different than him but it's
[1:58:05] the same power is that right that's what
[1:58:08] he said he said a spoonful of the ocean
[1:58:10] is still the
[1:58:11] ocean all the qualities of the ocean is
[1:58:14] in the
[1:58:15] Spoonful and we need to recognize what
[1:58:18] who we are stop letting the devil beat
[1:58:21] you up
[1:58:23] we got to stop being carnal because
[1:58:26] that's the
[1:58:29] problem and you don't realize and I'm
[1:58:31] not screaming to fuss at you I'm trying
[1:58:34] to encourage you because I'm trying to
[1:58:36] tell you we need to Get Up Stand Up Get
[1:58:38] Out of the Dust of the earth you know
[1:58:40] stand up and be the bride and do what
[1:58:43] God tell has told us to do so we can get
[1:58:45] out of here that's what I'm interested
[1:58:48] in you're not tired I'm tired of this
[1:58:54] that's why I don't chew gum to this day
[1:58:56] I get tired of
[1:58:58] it right I just
[1:59:01] it and you know it's amazing how we we
[1:59:04] we don't but God is go he has a way
[1:59:07] doesn't he you know he had a you know
[1:59:09] Samson lost his way didn't he but God
[1:59:12] knew how to bring him back to
[1:59:14] censes and whatever God needs to do to
[1:59:16] bring you back to your senses he's going
[1:59:19] to do it he will do it and I trust he
[1:59:22] will because I like to see everybody on
[1:59:25] the other
[1:59:27] side
[1:59:28] everybody on the other
[1:59:31] side you love the Lord know that the
