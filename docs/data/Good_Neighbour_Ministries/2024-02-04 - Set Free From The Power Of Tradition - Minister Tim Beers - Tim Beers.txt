and praise you to your gra the mer has brought me amen praise God God bless you Saints you may be seated for a minute worship team just stay praise God it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning prise the Lord we had a little bit of a setback this week with a cold but we're feeling much better by the grace of God we thank you for your prayers and for um uh for your support amen praise God um I've just got a couple of um announcements and then just some comments that I'd like to make first of all um we'd like to congratulate brother Jose and sister hope on the uh new coming of their baby girl Leah praise God she was born this week 6 and 1 12bs you know the first labor is always a little tough and so you know he was in constant contact with brother Phillip and saying brother you know this is happening and then brother the high blood pressure is happening and you know and eventually we know the baby will come amen and she came healthy and strong and mom and daughter and father are all doing well by the grace of God Amen praise God last week we had um in our prayer meeting we had asked for the Lord to um you know to help us with um the water leak problem that we had in the basement we asked them to help us with the roof situation out the front foyer that's been an ongoing situation for many years and so we said Lord we just want this done we we want it you know we' love it for you to just take care of it show us direct us bring us the right people and so the Lord made a way that uh you know we were able to fix the the problem in the basement it's fully um you know it's not completely all done we still got to repair the the ceiling and so forth but that'll all be done but the actual leak and everything's been identified and brother Alvin you know did a wonderful job in doing that the Lord led him and directed him and uh so we thank God for that and then we also had um you know this problem with the roof and so we said that we wanted to get somebody to come in and so uh I had a friend of mine who's a contractor and owns many buildings in Oakville and I said Tony come on down and you know have a look at this these two problems and so he was here with me on Friday we went up on the roof we looked at uh you know the situation there on the roof and um you know and he says you know what Dan he says call this person um he's somebody that I know he's reliable and I believe he can take care of this problem for you and I said okay wonderful so we called him he came right away within a couple days uh went there he looked at the whole situation he saw everything he says yes we can repair this and you know over the years we've had you know many different quotes and all I can say is that the Lord supernaturally is doing this for us at a price that is very affordable and it's going to be done and over with and we want to give God the glory it'll probably be done you know within the next two weeks also which is good so the Lord just continue to give us this beautiful weather I thank God for the sunshine this morning are you glad for the sunshin amen you don't realize how much you miss it until it's gone for about a month or two right and you know all of a sudden you go out there and boy you just absorb that sun and it lifts your spirits praise God because we know that it's a perfect type of Christ when Christ is not in our lives things can get pretty gloomy amen but when he shines upon your life and he starts to allow his Spirit to move in and through you it lifts you up it perks you it gives you Vision it gives you uh hope it it starts to give you confidence and and so we thank God for that amen praise God and so also I'd like to um you know correct something that that took place here on Wednesday night um you know uh brother Chris was here Wednesday night and he started a wonderful new series on women of the Bible and you know it's um something that you know it sparked something within me right away and uh so I'm certainly looking forward to that series as brother Christopher would bring it on our Bible study nights on Wednesday nights and so this Wednesday while he was ministering you know uh you know near the beginning of the service he made a statement and the statement was that you know Eve is and was the mother of all living and nowhere in the Bible does it say that Adam was the father of all living and so when he made that statement something now call it what you want you can say I had a senior moment okay or or a a hard drive froze up but all of a sudden all I could see was wait a minute Adam is the the father of all living in my mind this thought came into my mind and I went to the scripture in St Luke chapter 3 and I saw the lineage and all that was in my mind was the lineage of Christ that's all I could see and so I I I made some notes and I gave it to brother Christopher and I said brother uh you know just some notes Here a correction that Adam is the father of all living and then that was absolutely wrong Adam is not the father of all living brother Christopher's statement that Eve is and was the mother of all living was absolutely correct and that Adam is not the father of all living is absolutely correct so brother Christopher was 100% correct I was 100% wrong okay so that night when I went home I was just falling into my sleep and I Heard a Voice is clear in my mind and it said Adam was not the father of all living Eve is was the mother of all living He said the serpent placed a seed in Eve and it was like I jumped out of my bed and I looked at sister Jennifer I said brother Christopher was 100% right the Lord just released me from this blockage in my mind it can happen Saints I believe God had a purpose in it and so I immediately contacted brother Christopher at 11:30 on Wednesday night and I told him and he responded and he says brother praise God I I'm so grateful that the Lord has cleared up this situation and I was rejoicing amen praise God now we need to understand that Eve was beguiled by the serpent beguiled means she was defiled okay and it wasn't an apple that she ate it was adultery that took place in the Garden of Eden and she was beguiled and Cain's seed or or the serpent seed placed uh in Eve brought forth Cain and when she went and participated with Adam there was a seed there for Abel okay and Abel killed his brother it was a perfect uh you know clear understanding and then the Holy Spirit you know and then in Genesis 3:15 it says and I will put emity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed he was he was talking to the serpent there amen it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel in 1 John 3:12 it says not as Cain who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous the serpent seed brother brandham preached on the serpent seed in 1958 but you know that in 1957 he made a statement and he said this he said in questions and answers 1957 and I had actually brought this quote up on Wednesday night too and this was part of the blockage that was going on in my mind and when when I read the quote I read it and said that after the flood in the Tower of Babel when they began to scatter out that's when they taken their colors and so forth they're all come from the same tree that's exactly right Adam and Eve was the father and mother Earthly of every living creature of human beings that's ever been on the earth that's right black white pale Brown yellow whatever color you might be that's absolutely the place that you live in and that's the way now you look at that quote and you think well wait a minute here but you see progressive revelation was even happening in the prophet and that's why we cannot say in this day that you only play the tapes and you only listen to what and what exactly what the prophet said repeat only what the prophet said that's thank God that we have the holy ghost that can come and correct us am amen and correct the word and and progress his Revelation because it wasn't until 1958 that brother brandham preached the serpent seed and brought forth all Clarity and Revelation on the word of God and so I want to thank God I want to thank God for brother Christopher I want to thank God for all the ministers that that are around this ministry praise God the Lord had a reason in allowing this to take place on Wednesday night it's for somebody this is a learning moment amen praise God it's a learning moment for each and every one of us not one of the ministers that was here on Wednesday night came to me after the service and said brother what about this what about the serpent seed nobody it just somehow it was just supposed to be and we let the Holy Spirit work it all out and here now now he comes right back around and I believe somebody needed to hear this amen praise God thank you hallelujah amen thank you Jesus so at this time let's just change the order of the service we're all under great expectation this morning let's sing that song Kumbaya amen praise God kumay my Lord k [Music] am whom I [Music] [Applause] am I am alone whom I oh Lord whom my come by here my Lord my [Music] Lord come here my Lord come by come by my Lord [Music] come oh Lord one more time one more time you want him to come by here here hallelujah come by him oh great spirit of the Living God H come by yes great Holy Spirit by here my Lord come [Music] by [Music] oh hallelujah amen amen glory to God and the most high God bless you Saints amen as we gather together today to worship him to surrender Our Lives to him amen hallelujah glory to God Amen how many you are expecting how many been praying Hallelujah glory to God when we come into His presence Hallelujah we recognize that he is here and all things are possible to them that believe Hallelujah we don't have to leave here amen without a touch from God from a not from a word from God God can give us a word he can give us an experience Hallelujah he can take us higher because he's here amen hallelujah we thank God for the Holy Spirit that's what we want in the church amen the testimony from our pastor was we want the Holy Spirit here without him the church dies amen he is the Supreme one that is here in charge of us all Hallelujah and he's the one that's going to lead us and guide us right to the end amen hallelujah amen prise God oh there's so much I can say but let's get into the word of God I'm starting a series myself this is part one an introduction Hallelujah and then we're going to continue in The Prayer in the Bible studies and get a little deeper into it but we just want to lay a little Foundation this morning hallelujah we're going to go to Mark 71 and we're going to be talking about set free from the power of tradition Hallelujah my lord it's about setting us free it's always been about setting us free from day one Hallelujah when when when he came into our lives and birthed us it's all about a progression of redemption of setting us free are we are are you believe we're totally free this morning yes we are totally free in Christ yes we are but are you manifesting that freedom in fullness no we're not that's the reality because that's his word and his word has come so that you may recognize like like you said it's a progression of faith that is happening in our lives in our experience and as that Faith Comes amen we get set free more and more and more Hallelujah and God wants to break everything that is not of him off our lives amen hallelujah we hold on to so many things we don't I I know I hold on to things I didn't even realize I was holding on to things until he comes and we want him to come and speak to our hearts amen not brother Tim but we want the spirit of God to speak to our hearts open your heart to his spirit this morning Hallelujah Mark 71 Jesus talked and preached a many sermons in Parables but he said to the those it's given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom it's given to you to know so if this may sound like a parable this morning this message but it's given to the elect to know what he's speaking and what the spirit is saying then came together unto him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from Jerusalem and when they saw some of the disciples eating bread with defiled that is to say with unwashed hands they found fault for the Pharisees and all the Jews expect they wash the their hands off eat not holding eat not holding the traditions of the elders and when they came when they come from the market expect they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold as their washing of Cups and pots Brazen vessels and of tablets then the Pharisees and scribes asked him why walk not thy disciples according to the traditions of the elders but eat bread with unwashed hands he answered and said unto them well had Elias prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written this people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me Hallelujah Look what Jesus answered them here was the the the scribes and the Pharisees with all the traditions of the law coming against Jesus the god of the law and telling him think about it telling him and look at Jesus's response how bit in vain do they worship me teaching the doctrines and Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandments of God ye hold the traditions of man as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things you do many other different things Jesus is saying that you do and that you follow other words it's not of me he's saying and he said unto them full well ye reject the Commandments of God God that ye may keep your own traditions for Moses said honor thy father and thy mother and whoever whosoever cth father or mother let him die a death but ye say if a man shall say to his father or mother it is cin that is to say a gift by what by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or for his mother making the word of God of none effect through your Traditions which you have delivered and many such things like things do you let us go to John 8:31 lots of things he's saying he's pointing else something here but many different Traditions Hallelujah John 8:31 then Jesus said then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we were never in bondage to any man you see the response how sayest thou ye shall M be made free Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is the servant of sin and we know sin is UN belief and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the sun therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed oh glory to God help me this morning amen I need my amen Corners I need I need your faith this morning Hallelujah because we are in a battle we are in a Warfare and it's not just me against you it's it's me and you against the devil Hallelujah let us be spiritually awakened this morning to realize what's taking place Hallelujah let's pray father Lord we just read your word Lord we cannot do nothing without your spirit father it's not by might not by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord come this morning Lord Jesus because your children are here expecting your word to be manifested in their lives and amongst us father come and break the chains for who the son of man has set free Lord and you have started the freedom in our lives Lord and you will continue the work until it's done come and set your people free this morning show that you're king of kings and Lord of lords and the Conqueror of all things on this Earth father and in our lives oh God come and reveal to our hearts oh God one word from you speak into our lives speak faith into our lives and let us walk out of these doors acting upon that Faith father and I know when we obey that faith that comes to our hearts changes Deliverance will take place father Grant these things in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you as you're seated you Hallelujah glory to God Amen you know I was thinking uh about this um message and it came to me the power of tradition and it's been with me for a long time and then I was just thinking about it and putting some things together and then God gave me the opportunity I got a call from Brother Dany and said you'll be up this Sunday so I was thinking about it in bed I said Lord I got this thought here but what direction because I can preach on anything I can put anything together at this stage of my walk now and preach on it but we want the mind of the Lord amen we want what we know that when we're in his mind and his will then he comes amen and that's all I want to be is a a surrender vessel to him so I was thinking you know about this and then this song came into my head and I remember this song by in the world by the band Queen and when when when I heard this song all the time in the world it always struck me and I just got so excited and I want to read the lyrics to you and it just kept going over and over in my head and he starts singing and this man that was the the lead singer of Queen he was in bondage to a homosexual lifestyle but when you hear him singing you can hear something coming out of his voice especially this song and I believe all of them inside all of them that are in sin have a cry inside of their hearts to be set free and and the lyrics goes I want to break free I want to break free I want to break free from the lies amen and I put in this that the devil's put on me Hallelujah he goes and then he goes God knows I got to break free God knows I got to break free God knows I want to break free oh only God knows me only God knows you this morning Hallelujah that you want to break free is that what you want this morning you want to break free do we want the freedom that Christ has given us amen this morning we are all struggling we are all overcoming something in our lives that we need to break free but we got to cry out to God God I want to break free I need to break free this morning from every bondage of the Flesh and of Satan that has put on us through down the generations things have been put on us we didn't we didn't ask for those things but they were put on us but God gave us his word God gave us a calling he called us out to set us free to break free and the call in our hearts by the Holy Ghost I want to break free God knows this morning I want to break free does God know in your heart this morning that's why you come into the house of the Lord because you want to break free Hallelujah brother Brandon speaking here in the greatest battle ever fought but do you realize that there's really only two powers in all the universe out of all the differences between nations differences between each other there's only two powers and two kingdoms all the rest the little minor things are connected to either one of those powers are we listening this morning yes thank you Jes and those Powers is God's power or Satan's power so we're only dealing with two Powers this morning not any other power and and Satan's power is the flesh the carnal mind which is our greatest enemy not one another but our greatest enemies ourselves and then God's power is the word of God that is plac within us the attribute of God hallelujah amen and those are the two Powers within you this morning that are at War and it's like the old saying is who's going to win this war it's whoever you feed the most amen whoever you accept the most you're going to continue to accept the devil's lie and traditions of man and works of man or you going to accept the word of God truth when it comes because he said you'll know the truth and if you accept that truth it'll set you free Hallelujah Jesus said who the son of man sets free is free indeed Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power not some all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth in the spiritual and in the natural don't let the devil lie to you and say he has any power over you that he has any right to control you and tell you what to do cuz Jesus said all power is given unto me now he conquered at Calvary he shed his blood and we got the blood this morning amen behind us behind our words this morning behind our lives this morning to claim the victory that we can walk out of here free indeed Hallelujah and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth Jesus sets us free from all sin all sin Hallelujah listen I'm not what I used to be and I'm not what I'm supposed to be but to this morning Hallelujah I'm at a place now where I believe I'm going to be what he wants me to be I believe that with all my heart do you believe that every every time I every day I wake every time I hear that word of God I expect the word to speak to me and speak to my life and change me amen hallelujah because in reality there's no sickness there's no bondage there's no change no tradition no devil can overcome the bride because it's promised to her perfect faith not just Faith to overcome but perfect Faith to overcome perfect realization perfect clarity in the word that what God has promised he'll do it God is making clear to the bride he's saying what I have said what I have spoken in this hour I will do it I will perform it and when that becomes a reality in your heart that's perfect Faith thank you Jes that's perfect faith not just Faith see they had Faith back in the p Pentecostals they had Faith back in the the Luther Wesley days but it wasn't perfect Faith because they didn't see all the word they didn't see the promises in the fullness God did not make it clear to them that what he said he was going to do because that's why Luther he was set free by the just shall live by faith that was a great Revelation that was Freedom that was the Holy Ghost but he still smoked the pipe and did all these things see all the word wasn't made clear because God God did not make it clear to them in that day but God has hidden nothing from us in this day amen all the Mysteries the Seven Seals are open everything is revealed to the Bride of Jesus Christ he's made known all his word so all the Freedom Is Here For Us in this hour will God do this if he said it he'll do it if he said it in this hour he'll do it no question no doubt no no reasoning it's going to happen so I don't care if you're taking pills this morning because you're sick I don't care if you're in pain I don't care if you're in bondage or nothing whatever it is this morning you are free amen you are free cuz he set you free the blood set you free you got to get to a place Amen in desperation in the word of God that you believe it do you hear me that you believe it and you accept it and you can walk out in it oh well God do it God's done it God finished it he said I I finished the work I completed the work you

your heart you're far from acting on it you're far from applying it to your life and your situations I'm not speaking to nobody particular this morning I'm not like that I if I don't come up here with a pure heart I don't come up here I got nobody and nobody in my heart and my mind amen hallelujah glory to God Amen yes sir it doesn't matter my brothers and sisters we're not safe in any messes Church no way the Bible does not say that that we're safe in a mess's church we're not safe because we believe God s a prophet or we believe he was a prophet many people believed he was a prophet and then the same people deny him and call him a false prophet we're not safe in that we're not safe we belong to this ministry or that Ministry or this personality or that personality we're only safe in Christ that's the only safe place in this hour in Christ amen a real Minister will lead you to Christ put you in Christ that's your freedom that's your deliverance that's your change in your life it's in Christ thank you Jesus no true minister of God wants the burden of the people Moses you seen it back in the Bible took the burdens of the people look what it did it destroyed them hallelujah it's lead the people to Christ come unto me those that are heavy lad in the burden I not the pastor not the deacons not the ministers I will give you resten we point you to somebody that know that we know and believe will do the job Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah God has always been about setting this people free from Adam and Eve right from the beginning when the sin happened in the garden he came down with a s sacrifice a lamb Hallelujah he's always been about he used Moses to set the Israelites free from slavery from Egypt Jesus died to set the world free from sin which is the worst bondage of all and when he sets us free he empowers us to help others find Freedom in Christ as well he didn't set you free just to be there he set you free to go and take that freedom and speak that freedom to other people and set them free I don't care what it's from God that's that's the mystery in this hour where God and his bride are becoming one and the same you'll know in that day that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me I don't care what they say that there's you know there's so many doctrines out there so many teachings that these people who preach God in in in that God is in us and that we are the same as God is well we're not the God but if God birth me amen any animal that births its own kind brings forth of his own kind Hallelujah and you're born again by the spirit of God you can only bring forth a part of God Amen and that God and inside of you amen God could have called The Rapture way back there but he didn't because he wants to manifest and this morning we are here because God wants to manifest in us hallelujah he wants to express himself in us the problem is we're in so much of the way Hallelujah I'm laying a foundation here I'm not getting into it yet a lay the foundation we're getting so much ourselves in the way but when we we come to understand that we move out of the way by faith and God reveals To Us by faith how to move out of the way then God steps on the scene and he starts doing what he says oh I don't see God doing this I don't see God he said this he said that he said that I pray I pray I pray I pray I pray this I pray that doesn't happen it doesn't happen there something wrong with God automatically yeah there there's something wrong with God be honest there's something wrong with God when we when we think that we never think to ourselves there's something wrong with me but when you come to a place of maturity in God you realize Lord Lord you said this Lord you promised this so what's in the way father in my life because we hate surrender oh we just sing about it I surrender all I give all my life to Jesus Take It All Lord whatever you want but when he asks us for something little small like that my God don't want that what does he want with that okay amen hallelujah yes sir and when he says us free empowers us to set others free he gave us a prophet a pillar of fire a sacrifice lamb to deliver power we are free to set other people free Paul explains it well in Galatians 5 listen to what he says it is for Freedom that Christ sets us free stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by the Yoke of slavery Hallelujah going back to our old ways going back to the ways of the flesh going back to Traditions that God has broken off our lives didn't the Lord God say I got no pleasure in a soul who turns back God Don't Look Back he looks forward he goes forward he walks forward those bloody Footprints didn't go for backwards it went forward right up to Glory that's what God does you don't look back don't look back Saints don't listen to the lies of the devil Hallelujah stand firm you my brothers and sisters are called to be free for the entire law is fulfilled in keep in one this one commandment love God with all your heart love your neighbor as yourself so I say walk in the spirit and you will not citate or desire the of the flesh for the flesh desires what is contrary to the spirit and the spirit what is contrary to the flesh but if you are led by the spirit of God you know that word if is in a lot if the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal body it's always if and it's saying right here if you are led by the spirit you are not under the law under the law of bondage anymore but you have been set free by the grace by faith in your life the just shall live by faith by revelation it's not just a saying amen it's a lifestyle it's a believer's lifestyle that we live we wait upon God for faith we pray in situations we pray in P Pinnacle points of our lives and decisions we have to make and we wait upon faith upon God because the justs wave upon Faith the just live and walk by Faith Hallelujah not by sight not by other men's opinions that's why I don't like giving my opinions a lot I I I discern the questions that are asked me and if it's a question that you should be taken before the Lord and waiting upon God for God to speak to you unless he gives one of the ministers a word you wait upon God amen hallelujah amen the first verse is one of the most powerful in the scriptures for it is the freedom that Christ has set us free stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again with the Yol of slavery some preachers say that this is a center message of a Christian's life it is the key verse to the entire book book of Galatians and it was the message that fueled Martin Luther's protest Reformation but what does it mean it is freedom that Christ has set us free Hallelujah that's what burdened that's what empowered Luther in his day just imagine coming out of the Catholic Church you talk about coming out of tradition Breaking Free from that bondage of tradition while he had to break free but imagine how powerful that Revelation when it struck him what did he see when he said the just shall live by faith he seen Freedom he seen God setting them free from the bondage of slavery bondage of man's traditions we can look back and see that amen but remember we're going to get into the I'm just going to pass over but all the church ages Blended right down into this age and even the seven Church age messenger hallelujah oh even the seven Church age messenger was under a lot of those Traditions but there came a place there came where the Bible became a new Bible to him and he spoke a lot different and remember he said a lot of things he said I I have a lot of things I cannot tell you I cannot say because he knew the Holy Spirit would go to the individuals to the Bride of Jesus Christ and personally reveal it to them Hallelujah last week in Matthew 24 it was the most deceiving age of all ages this age all the ages of Deceit from the Garden of Eden and way down has never been an age so deceiving and deceptive as this age you talk about back then when he was speaking that back in the 1960s what about now what about now you talk about the pale horse rider mixing everything together people don't know where they're going and coming they're they're coming to and fro even in this message what a deception going on here we got the truth here we got the reveal word we got a prophet's word in this hour and people are all messed up confused don't know where to go why why because the spirit of God is the one and the only one that can take his word and reveal it to you amen and show you he says I will show you things to come I will make known to you Hallelujah all the Mysteries you will not be deceived you will walk in your flesh as you are maturing and growing there are going to be a lot of things around the Bride of Jesus Christ that will deceive her temporarily or put her in a state of this being in deceit but the holy spirit inside of her will be constantly revealing the word and breaking her free out of the bondage of lies of men's traditions we are all if we're the bride of Christ being set free day by day he set me free hour by hour Revelation by Revelation oh God help me Lord Jesus thankes amen yes false prophets will rise show signs and wonders if it possible dece the very elect now just a cold formal starchy churches and so forth of man-made theology that the elect would never pay no attention to that not the elect she knows she knows her God amen amen and and when you know your God you'll do great things in the spirit you do great things for God in the spirit when you know your God you don't know your God you're going to fall into that cold starchy lukewarm powerless Satan will get a hold of you and make you like this but if you know you're God you know how to take the spirit and you know how to shake yourself you know how to stir yourself up you know how to get yourself ready to come into the house of God you know how to pray up you know what to speak in prayer you're like Jesus Jesus knew how to pray to the father CU he knew his commission he knew his commission he knew what God sent them on Earth to do we are sent here to do something Hallelujah not just to be set free in ourselves but to set others free oh God wants us set and let the power flow through you and me to set people free Hallelujah if we just let him do it thank you Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah glory to God but it's upu up there almost like the real thing just leaving one word out that's all you have to do the promise of the age very great time Christians everywhere take heed to the hour we're living in mark down read study listen closely to the word of God what would God call people out of this age for for his name for his power for his demonstration the reason it is to try a bride perfect a bride get a bride ready to show the bride off oh Hallelujah when she's made manifest she's been tried she's been proven Hallelujah to Satan to Satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end brother brand 65 God of this evil age oh my Hallelujah glory to God my brothers and sisters mixing up the message with law and grace and the Theology of man and their intellect intellectual interpretation of the word of God with the power of the traditions of man will kill any church any life any walk because we're we're removing the one main thing which is him that's why Jesus constantly rebuked the Pharisees and Sadducees think about it I don't want to get ahead of myself but think about it here was God himself the god of the law God who wrote the law coming to fulfill the law and because the Pharisees and Sadducees just think are we going to think this morning yes the Pharisees and Sadducees because of all the hundreds and there's literally hundreds of traditions that they made up with the law if they were to just stay with the law that was their portion Israel's portion is to stay with the law not the Gentile church if they would have just stayed with the law they would have recognized him but they made up so many hundreds of different traditions and rituals that of manmade that they were looking they were when they when Jesus was speaking speak and speaking to them and speaking the word to them and saying isn't it written isn't it written they look back and and and call them be called them this called them that when he was pointing out the word because all they were looking at was their Traditions oh you know brother Bram seen the devil like a serpent coming right into this message and he said I tried to get it he said I tried to get it but it just snuck right in snuck in that Spirit Hallelujah listen to me God permitted Israel to take the law in Exodus 19 when Grace already had given them a prophet a pillar fire a sacrificed lamb to deliver the delivering power but they cried out for the law it wasn't God's will but it was injected now listen it was injected because man wanted it it wasn't God's Will and Jesus said let thy will be done not my will but thy will be done even Jesus himself as a man said not my will but thy will be done he recognized that he wanted to inject something father remove this cup from me but he said nevertheless because the word can't be deceived he knew because he was the word and it answered right back and said not my will but thy will be done but man will wants these things injected we don't have to inject nothing in our walk we don't have to help the spirit of God for nothing he does everything we just got to be youi that surrendered vessels unto him he knows what he's doing he knows why we're going through the things we're going through he knows why you're going down that path don't be scared of the hard decisions that you're going to have to make don't be scared of anything that you're facing in your life have faith in God it's so simple have faith in God believe in God stand and wait in prayer am in much prayer maybe in some desperation oh I wait to hear from this person or that person or that person oh brother so and so is Anointed so and so is Anointed God will shut everybody's understanding of your situation because he wants you and him he wants you to get to a place where you seek Him and He will speak to you how do you know he's your God how do you know that he's with you and he's walking with you how does it build confidence when he doesn't speak to you when you don't hear his voice I know that voice who spoke to me many times in the past many different Pinnacle times in my life he has spoken to me I know that voice just like brother Brandon when he he knew that voice when that voice spoke to mother of the tree spoke to him when the angel came in the room that voice spoke he knew he recognized that voice listen you want to put it back in the day gone pie you want to put it in brother br's you want to put it in Jesus day you go ahead but that God is the same God to me he's the same God to me hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah amen now listen meaning of [Music] tradition Hallelujah and inherited established or traditional pattern of thought action or behavior such as religious practice or a social custom a belief or a story or a body of beliefs or stories relating to the past that are commonly accepted as historical though not able to be checked you listening to be checked or demon rated or to be accurate or justified by the word of God if the Pharisees only knew that the things that they were saying to Jesus were not accurate they weren't checked they weren't with the word of God they wouldn't have crucified him they wouldn't have but we know they had to got it that's the Bible it says study yourself approved and to those who know their God shall do great things you know the Bible says that study yourself approve oh I I I read my Bible 10 minutes a day I listen to a tape here and there maybe two or three times a week that's not what the Bible's saying that's not studying yourself approved there's a different spirit that God anoints you with when you come and study the word it's not only for the preachers to study the word it's for you every individual Paul said it he says I praise you for taking the things I say and going back and studying in the word of God and seeing that they're in there amen that's when God opens up our understanding even greater I listened to tapes I read my Bible for many many years but then when I started studying God started bringing because I'm not a studier okay my my my uh my education is not great my ADHD helps me to not be focused right so I'm not a great studier but God I started praying for many years Lord I want to study more and study more your word hallelujah and he started helping me study and I'm telling you things that were coming out that God was revealing is a lot more richer you talk about uh this plastic food out there the SP food food out there you know some of you sisters you know how to cook those spices up and cook for hours a dish man that that tastes good that is not good that's what studying does that's the difference between studying hallelujah what is tradition on the other hand is a more specific term it's often used to describe an individual event or practice such as removing your shoes when you enter your home Traditions are ideals and beliefs passed down from one generation to the next from one Church age to the next oh my where's the heart of all these TR Traditions these doctrines these dogmas come from right from the Catholic Church the mother itself passing down how many times has brother Simon said to us amen you come in the message but you carry a lot of your Traditions you carry a lot of your beliefs that were taught to you back there but you got to die out to those things do you understand you got to die and let go of a lot of things for from the past because that's the very thing that's hindering the holy ghost in your life from doing what it wants to do Paul says I Die daily well brother Tim I thought you're supposed to build my faith you know to make me a real Christian you don't die there's no life you don't die there's no life you don't let go there's no letting God bottom line amen hallelujah amen like that uh saying what's that saying that you said with the beliefs yeah I like that I like that because I was studying this and that forms a belief around you amen that's the Holy Ghost forms a belief around you and anything that comes that is different than that belief even though you know true you talk about powerful you talk about deception even though you know it's true even though you know it's God speaking to you and revealing to you the truth in your life oh it's hard to break through that it's hard to let go of that because you you believe that's your foundation that's the only thing that's holding you together but God is saying let it go let it go I want to set you free I want want to take you higher this very thing that you're holding on to is holding you down he keeping you down from growing in christall you got to break that if you got to fast you got to pray some come up by fasting and praying you got to break that demon upon your life when I say you you just got to get a place and be available for the Holy Spirit and that's your fasting and praying you don't mind if I take a drink brother Bill gave me two of these up here what did you what did you see brother Bill did you see a vision listen I don't know when God's going to take any one of us home right and every time I stand up here I'm giving my all I'm giving my all I almost pass two two Services ago I almost passed out here I'm giving my all that's all I want to hear well done good and faithful servant enter into the that's all I want I don't need nothing else I don't need nothing else I don't need great Treasures or anything I just need to hear the voice of God more and more in my life as this thing Narrows down it gets sweeter and more simpler I just need to hear his voice well done you know what that will mean all the struggles that we go through especially the ministers that we go through that Satan hits us on levels of discouragement lies you're nothing you're not effective you're not getting through to the people you are you you know you're uneducated all these things that we fight at every sing single level and God gives us the grace to press through and to stand up here and the battles that we go through before and the battles that we go through afterwards why just to please him to deliver the word it's not going to be on me my brothers and sisters if God speaks to you today it's not going to be on any of these ministers if God speaks to you it's going to be on you it's going to be on you to take the word of God God is going to allow you to answer before him I want to deliver the blood the life the blood every single time then it's on your hands what are you going to do with the blood are you going to apply it are you going to be like pilot and wash it off this is life and death this is a great battle here this morning oh Satan brother BR s in great battlefly he's standing right to every heart this morning it's true this morning he stand to every heart what will you do will you stand like the soldiers of old will you stand and take the word of God and break every chain Hallelujah and take the word you take the word what are you waiting for oh God culture culture is a collective term to identify certain ideas customs and social behaviors it represents a group of people or Society combining their knowledge beliefs and morals and laws all these things tradition culture all these things mixed in in our lives we come to Christ dirty we come to Christ filthy we come to Christ with all our sins but we come to Christ because we know he can clean us up that's that's do you believe that amen will you let him amen will you let him amen hallelujah oh glory to God I'm going to skip over some things and bring it in part two with the N of Rome we want to bring and and expose a lot of the doctrines a lot of the traditions and see where we are in the message today and what we're doing today Hallelujah glory to God Amen look the scribes of the old created an oral law now think about it here an attempt to protect the Jews from breaking the Mosaic law so God gave them the Mosaic law but they created the aura law to protect the people from breaking the Mosaic law oh my do you see anything such efforts not only don't work but the results of applying the oral law often directly contradicts the Mosaic law isn't that their government today they they pass a law and then they they got to create another law to to to to guard that law and then because that law needs another law to guard that law and it just goes on and on the next thing you know you don't even know what you're doing you don't even know what law to believe or what law to follow isn't that the truth out there do you do you know your government do you know the the laws of the land or you just you know caught up in the upper room every day Hallelujah well that's the way it is in Christian ity not in Christ but in Christianity these churches out there that's why there's so much confusion oh this truth that truth this truth that truth this doctrine that Doctrine this belief that belief this way that way Jesus said I am the way I am the truth I am the life not any of these things hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen the oral law listen is a Code of Conduct in use in given culture religion or Community application by which the body of rules of human behavior is transmitted by the human behaviors of people of body is transmit it humans transmit it man transmit it not God that's why the Bible says examine yourself oh uh I think I'm a CR no examine go deep go deep you know your thoughts right yeah better than anybody not better than God but he knows you're better than yourself but you know your thoughts right you know what you think what you believe you know if you're alive you'll know that so you examine yourself do we examine a lot of the thoughts do we examine a lot of the behaviors in our lives our actions day by day whether you're at work wherever you are do we examine those things by the word of God do we take those things back into the word Lord show me my behavior is it in there is it pleasing to you no we just accept it this is me this is who I am and you wonder why Where's God always the question comes up why are you blessing other people's and not me Lord what about me because that person there is doing one thing that you're not doing they're examin themselves they're examin their actions back in the word of God and they're seeing because God is revealing to them and they're letting it go they're surrendering and they're dying out to it listen the bride is being judged now the house of the Lord is the beginning of judgment we judge ourselves now amen because he can't judge us there we're being judged here now so we must judge ourselves now not Let It Go not Loosely and laziness and lackness and believe the devil's lie or you're okay one minute he tells you you're not okay and the next minute he comes back and says oh you're okay he always tells you let me tell you when he tells you you're okay is because he doesn't want to let go he knows when he's losing power over an individual power power over your life power over your mind he'll come and tell you you're okay you don't have to go that far Grace will cover you but God is saying something different and your heart is saying something different we need to get in contact with our hearts with our souls more than ever in this hour and be truthful to that I thank God for your works I thank God for your faithfulness so is the pastor we thank God for your your giving we thank God for all these things well let me tell you one thing you're going to thank God when you surrender that to God and then you're going to be a blessing not a burden not a burden upon the ministry oh the Lord wants this train to move faster he wants his progress to go faster my brothers and sisters he wants his mature mat to grow I believe this is the hour who are you brother Tim who are you brother Danny in this hour to take this to the Rapture well who was who was brother Simon who was uh brother uh anybody brother Brandon who was anybody in God's eyes in Man's eyes in your eyes you judge who's equipped and who's not equipped but God doesn't if you look back at the prophets and you study all the prophets and all the man of God they all had weaknesses they all had failures in their lives they all made mistakes but God choose to use who he wants to use to bring his word and God regardless if you like it or not God is choosing raising up man in this hour to bring this to the resurrection to bring this to Total Deliverance hallelujah amen I'm going to try to wind it down here you see this was something that the Jewish rabbis came up with over time listen they studied the Old Testament and came up with a list of hundreds of Commandments that are not found in the Old Testament these were what they ought were reasonable applications of the Old Testament so they studied the Old Testament they knew the Old Testament but they still came up with hundreds of things isn't that the Catholic church we are the church the pillar and founder we are the church so we have a right to change we have a right to change the word of God God does more than what the Bible says I heard I heard a priest say that God does more than what the Bible says and I believe that too but God said don't add or take away see everything I do sayeth the Lord will reflect in the word of God you'll see my character in the word of God you don't need to add nothing I don't need you sayeth the Lord I have promised I will perform sayeth the Lord hallelujah Isaiah's prophecy about the Commandments of men in Mark 7:6 Jesus did not correct his Apostles in the washing of hands when the Pharisees approached him he did not correct them but he pointed out the Pharisees and their wrongs and rebuked them them Isaiah rebuked the Jews of his generation for honoring God with their lips yet having their hearts that were far from God they did worship God but they worshiped their worship was in vain wow this is deep my brothers sisters vain worship is empty worship to take God's name in vain is to use it in any empty way to worship god with your words while your heart is a million miles away from him is vain worship your heart are million of miles away from him other words when God speaks into your heart you have no intention of obeying it is that you this morning no God knows I don't God knows I Isaiah said that the reasoning of your hearts were far from God and they worshiped in vain because their tra because of the traditions of men there are many traditions in Christianity Today that are deeply ingrained Christians have been influenced by our churches Christian authors preachers church history culture schools the press the movies how do we decide which Traditions are good which Traditions are bad if a tradition contradicts the word of God then it's bad and should be rejected because we know that there traditions of the fathers it's in the Bible the apostles talked about traditions of the fathers but it never contradicted the word it never added anything to the word so there is Traditions that don't add or take away from the word of God and those are the Traditions that he wants us to keep like come together at the Lord's Supper pray all these great Traditions that we have but it doesn't contradict the word of God legalism may be good intentions but is laying aside rejecting and nullifying God's commands the Bible makes it very clear that we should discern God's guidance regarding each tradition in our lives 2 Corinthians 13:5 examine yourself and see whether you be in the faith or not hallelujah amen let us examine ourselves you know the Lord woke me up this morning for a reason and I'm going to talk to you sisters he woke me up this morning and you sisters know those sisters that know me how I encourage you how I pray with you how I love you in Christ the lord woke me up this morning and put thoughts in my head and said speak speak to that spirit and that spirit is a preaching Spirit now my sisters God has gifted you and blessed you with gifts in your life he uses you but he only uses you according to the word of God there's a circle there's there's a guidance of circle that you are free and you are free and this ministry is always allowed our sisters to be free I've been to other churches and I look and I fellowship with many other churches in private fellowships and those sisters are in bondage they're in slavery and I've listened to a lot of testimonies of sisters who have left the message saying that they wish they were born a man because man in this message have everything well we don't believe that we believe that you are gifted we believe that this world if they're going to see an influence of Christ in this hour it's going to be in you it's going to be in your life do you understand what I'm saying but he doesn't want you to preach why man has given authority to women in the world man has given authority to women in the world to preach but God has never given you authority to preach he's done so much for you and made you without my wife I don't know where I'd be she's the PowerHouse behind our relationship behind my home amen I want you to understand something here without her brother Danny with his wife with all of our wives they are a Powerhouse but that Spirit of preaching God said it shall not be done God said You shall not do it amen when we pray sisters when you're pray to ask and pray for a request pray for that request don't start preaching from Genesis Revelation don't start what is preaching what is preaching I know what is preaching when I pray I preach cuz I'm a preacher but not you preaching is when you're taking scripture after scripture after scripture taking brother Brad's quote after brother bram's quote when you were asked to pray for a situation testimonies you're allowed to pray you're allowed to give testimonies testimonies give a testimony God did something tell the people what God did don't bring up sermon Before You Preach before you uh While You Preach you bring a sermon before you testify oh brother Abraham said this and God said that and God said this and God said that listen I'm obeying the Lord right now okay this is he woke me up to say this I love you sisters and those who know me know that that I don't put it on I I I encourage you I send things to you and I pray for you I pray with you but the Lord woke me up and says God said You shall not preach get rid of that Spirit pray to God and loose that thing from your life because it's actually you don't even realize it it's a religious spirit that is hindering your progress hindering your deliverance in your life and you think it's God's will it's not God's will cuz he said You shall not preach that's Spirit of preaching amen now this ain't putting you down this is setting you free amen this is set you I fought with this I wrestled with this to get away from it and I came to the page I thought I was going to close before it and here it is it's up to you now it's up to you what will you do what will you do with this word that God has given me Hallelujah let us close invite the musicians up Hallelujah there are traditional voices religious voices false Doctrine voices satanic voices false belief voices and when you see the word made flesh you you don't see traditional ways of thinking about God's word you live in the Unseen everything is different now you see God's Plan of Redemption the power of the people's influence and interpretations of the blood is none effect to you when you see the truth you see the life moving forward in you and manifesting and being fulfilled all the promises of this day coming to pass yes sir sir the church brother Brown speaking here in leoan church has got to a place where he said the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouthpiece with all his traditions and doctrines so God is turning on her the church he will confront her through the prophet and the bride you hear the voice of God will be heard in her yes it is to say in the last chapter of Revelation 17 the spirit and the bride say come nothing else the spirit and the bride say come in this hour we are not to follow this is Christ that is Christ go over here this is Christ this ministry is Christ no the spirit and the bride say come in this hour once more the world will hear here directly from God as it did Pentecost now he cries out in the last age you have the word you have more Bibles than never before what are you doing with it you're dividing it you're hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you want you're not interested in living it are we interested this morning in live in this word become in this word surrender to this word oh Lord help us Jesus but debate in it debate debate debate I'm right you're wrong you're wrong I'm right I will sooner you'd be cold or hot because if you were cold then reject it then I can see it and accept that Ephesians 10 no sorry Ephesians 610 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil Hallelujah for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places therefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand take the word of God that's the the only way you're going to stand in this evil day and having done all the stand taken that word and stand there just stand my brothers and sisters just stand on that word when you're in a situation wherever you are in your walk in your life right now stand on that word don't move from it stay on that rock oh it's happening the miracle is happening when you stand on that word it's coming to pass God can do nothing but honor that the voice of the Bride Grom is the final voice to the bride I know it's a long service I know our minds can only take so much the voice of the bridegroom not the voice of men not my voice not any man's voice behind his fo bit but the voice of the bridegroom the bride hears is a voice to the bride in this hour the first family failed because they listen to the voice of the serpent through the woman or the wife they welcome another voice into their home don't welcome any other voice into your home they listen to that and obey the Serpent's voice and stay instead of staying with the voice of the bridegroom only only let's stand you Lord hallelujah Hal [Music] Hallelujah I appreciate the claps I appreciate your listening coming here but more and more I'd appreciate that you listen to the voice of God obey the voice of God Amen brother bradam want to see and any man of God that leades his people want to see you make it we don't stand stand up here so that you can go to hell oh yes we stand up here that you can surrender your lives and that you'll make it you say how can I make it I don't know cry out God's Mercy is great his Mercy endures forever his grace is beyond our understanding no matter what it looks like what your sit situation is oh you'll always put yourself down I'll never let me tell you something I'll never find myself with inside myself myself I said worthy of this worthy of standing here this morning worthy of this calling worthy of talking to you but he his blood his life I cannot bypass what he did for me he said you are forgiven you are cleansed you are saved you are healed he said you are he says I love you I love you or it takes so long for us to accept that but when you get to a place where you accept his love his forgiveness Everything Changes Hallelujah my brothers and sisters I believe because I know the way that I was studying but you see we study and that's good but we let the Holy Spirit took me in ways this morning that only he knows for you here you on the on the internet and for you that will here it's your opportunity now it's your opportunity now this ain't no religious game this ain't no religious showing off this is between you and God you might never I don't know but you might never have this chance again that you got this morning to let go and let God have his way if he has spoken to your heart and if he hasn't spoken to your heart you don't leave this place you hear me you don't leave this place until you cry out to God and he speaks to your heart this is the hour that we're living in Father oh God we thank you
