the spirit said unto the church amen we're gonna read another one's Saint John 5 4. the first John sorry first John first John five four whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but but he that believeth that Jesus the son of God this is that this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood it is and it is the spirit that buried Witness because the spirit is truth amen you may be seated tonight my my subject is Overcomers we're gonna talk about talk about Overcomers you are Overcomers Hallelujah the meaning Overcomers meaning of win a victory overcome all difficulties defeat your enemies overcome infirmities Hallelujah the before you become overcome something there has to be something that you have to overcome Hallelujah and we thank God we we overcome this world here through our Lord Our Savior Jesus Christ thank you just bear with me we have some stuff to talk about it amen we are sitting here because we didn't come by ourselves we were in the world doing all what we have to do it wasn't easy to come down here and sit down and hear the ball head at bowhead brother I have another boy head here we come here because something over power overcome us before we can come here because we were living in the world all the things that we were doing was not easy to overcome them because the Lord Jesus Christ overcame that's why we can come here Hallelujah you know there's something about humans we love to complain everything you're gonna complain but let me tell you you are more than what you are especially Christians in this world we supposed to be the last people to complain but we are the first people to complain sometimes you're sitting here after the church the message come out you go outside you sit and come fellowship with the brother then he started bringing his trouble taking everything that you have got from your mind started complaining all this year all this year all this year all this year why are you complaining we supposed to be the last people to complain why because we have God the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who overcame everything and you didn't take it back he gave everything to you and me or what you need to recognize yourself brother Brown preacher on recognize presence of God you always surround with God he's in you so when something happened what you have to do you have to become yourself say why who I am my God overcame everything and he placed everything in my hand so what do I repeat for the worst it wasn't easy look what about Moses ah Elijah not Elijah ah ah Joshua remember those brethren the blood was not given yet so if they complained they have something to complain about we God came and overcame everything for us he made it easy for us Moses has to go through the people two million people for one man he has a big challenge before him but he stood perfectly with God because why he saw God have you seen God is in you you have to know the God that he said he said I will never leave you nor forsake you till the end of this world it's a promise and This Promise has no end two million people remember Moses LED them then Joshua came if you complain he doesn't care we are moving forward if you want to live here stay here and rot we will leave you here some of them said we will not cross over he left them and cross over there's no time to joke this time everybody has to be serious because God is here he said I will not leave you nor forsake you Hallelujah God is here you know how the Lord overcame how many of you have you ever hit your you have seen here somebody ever hit that before how do you feel it oh man five to ten minutes is still going like this see going like this you know what the Lord went through to overcome everything for us he went through so much but he never opened his mouth they caught him what happened they crossed the leg and put nail from here two legs and nearly on the wood they put the tongues in the head they split his arms put their nails he never opened his mouth for me and you he overcame the world they speak to him they did so many things to him his own people that he came to save he never opened his mouth each and everywhere sitting here if he comes to a home you have your car your wife has your car your son has a car everybody have a car driving day in day out and they're still complaining they don't have money they still complaining they don't have money they still complain they don't have this why are we complaining for you are overcome he came down here during purposely because of us he overcame everything no one thing he left it over you are Overcomers Overcomers because he overcame the word I I said was preaching he chose you he mentioned something I cut something there he said Adam was eternal and God bring brought him out to tell the land okay we're gonna read here Janice Genesis I I have something here I'm gonna read to you here Genesis 2 67. okay this is Genesis 2 6 7. oh I think I missed my foreign six to seven and the Lord God for man of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nozzles and breathe and Breath of Life and Man became a living soul you know Adam was eternal and and God said he took ground and form a man you know before God has already created ground the Dead so he used part of that dead and make man so that body that was there was was weak already because God didn't create Direct any right and that's why I said honey you use a photocopy all the time you become a lighter right so that body there was weak I placed Monday but God know what he was doing so when my fault that that time there when got my fault God didn't make another debt he used the same death and passed through to come to this world because he cannot create another debt he's already been created it's like somebody fall in the water that is drowning you have to go through that the same order to bring him out you can't get another water to be good you have to go there so the same death the god went through Mary and came out to overcome for you and me the only person that can take Adam from that that crisis was only God because he is the one who put him inside there so he has to go through there and bring a reverse everything that Adam was the state that Adam was everything every one of us we were in the attributes of God so when you pass through Adam right there everyone of us has to go through the same Adam went through so he came down that I reverse everything that happened in the Diary of Eden and went through because he knew what he was doing because the enemy was there Satan was created but he doesn't know how God create because he knew God is Holy God will never pass through the place where he passed through that's why he couldn't recognize him Satan could you recognize the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't believe that God the creator of Heaven and Earth will come to that kind of that kind of uh the image that he passed through we were States nothing good for us we are all gone everything was done but through his mercy and Grace he knew his children was inside of him and they have to pass through all this in here to bring the end of Satan so he has to go through that and he came Satan couldn't recognize him that's why he said if you're a son of God cast this Stone he didn't know was God himself inside that body there so when what the Lord Jesus Christ went through all this year and he went to the cross and he said it's finished Hallelujah he said it's finished Satan thought that is already done it's finished he went through where hell and took the key that time all the Patriots everybody was there that's why they called that place a word Paradise they were all locked down there look inside the dungeon and you went inside there and took that key and said them feeling the Bible said they all came out and he ascended with them to heaven so when Paul was talking to thesaurus he said because this this was a drama that was is not was for is still unfolding but God have he has already paved a way for all the attributes all his children he has to take them back where they were before where Adam was what Adam what Adam passed through all his attributes as he passed through there because otherwise it's not fair how you want only Adam to pass through that stage all his attribute if God give you a pie he has a right this man has a right to get a pie too everybody has a has to get a pie to eat so when he went there down there and took the saint with them and Paul was speaking to the theory and he said you know this drama is folding we know but but the sense of God in this world here before this drama ends we know not all these Saints will die but before this drama ends there will be people here that God will attack them because he saw a Enoch go went through the Rapture and the same time he went to down there what happened he took all the saints and went to heaven with them and the Bible says even some people saw them on the street of Jerusalem oh why you overcame that because there was people inside the dungeons or Abraham or the prophet all of them were down there so you have to go through what he went through so he overcame everything and you took that key and that key he didn't give back to Satan again so that place there there's no key there that's why they said when you die straight down you have no key to lock you out there from there all the same they go up straight Hallelujah nobody can lock there no more we supposed to be happiest people I've sent from this body present with God and Paul says some of you will be leaving before some and those people who when they die they go straight down there there's no more key there it's empty Satan has no more power over you you are overcome because our Lord overcame and we are the Overcomers so why you cry every day day in Day Out you look to the world or you look to the word of God he said ask whatever you ask in my name you will get it he said I will give it to you I will give it to you presentation no no I'm gonna give it I will give it to you why are you murmuring you are more than a country remember my message last time you are the celebrity the real celebrities God heart of famous you think God care of you so much he care of you he care for you so much stand on your grounds stand on your grounds and recognize the god that you serve he does not sleep or no slumber Hallelujah his awesome God he is a deliverer He Is A Healer he's a conqueror he's a he's a counselor he's a provider he's a comforter he is all you know so why you cry there's nothing left for you to be crying nothing left for you to be sad what are you thinking about the day Brahman said the day that the bride knows who they are something will take place Hallelujah God's stupid that body that he made on the air the same body he came down and feel you how is your feeling how is your tormenting in this world here he finally you cannot Satan cannot torment it like that so he went to the cross and took everything away with all the pain and agony the Sheamus death that he went through God himself came down he went through he went through Manger well cows and so smelled God himself you because he wants you to overcome the world and he overcame the world not that he did not he overcame the world God is God he does not change it's time for us to live here no time brother Danny can give you Pastor can give you the Ministers of this world this church here cannot give it to you their job is to tell you to wake up recognize Who You Are let me tell you this message is real it's no joke it's real if you don't see

that left that he did not conquer he conquered everything there you see he stood there and you see the people tormenting he called the new monster from them leave my people the demon has to free he

we are pregnant strangers here you see here brother you understand that what to say it doesn't mean nothing to you because you don't understand so when you speak God where they don't understand because we have a different language get in the water and give your life to Christ they don't understand what are you so it's a different language unless God himself open your understanding like the day of Pentecost every time don't criticize them it doesn't matter how many times you talk to them one day to hear something Hallelujah is going home time he said this one come Paul knew that the last

him in this body God came through the same body and picked him up and what happened he's taking every one of us so everybody that attribute of God we came through the same Adam King because God knew what he was doing Satan cannot create because he didn't know how God does his things because God fool him that God cannot go through this kind of body that he has made he's thinking about him but God preaching Mercy he passes there the same ground that is made he didn't make another he didn't form another ground the same ground through Mary is the same girl every girl is down we are all dead he knew this that this right here he's picking up he's gonna leave it here but inside there that's what he's looking for so he went through there and pick it up Hallelujah and he took all of them and while he was going Hallelujah glory to God he sent the power of them with him now we who are remaining a person that day that day after the drama or when the order of drama finished my brother whether
