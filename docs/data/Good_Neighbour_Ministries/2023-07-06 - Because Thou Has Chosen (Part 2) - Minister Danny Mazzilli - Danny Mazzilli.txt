again in the house of the Lord we certainly had a wonderful time on Sunday in the presence of the Lord and uh just looking forward to what he has for us tonight amen praise God if you came with a little bit of expectation in your heart and you prayed a little bit today and you said well Lord I'm coming to meet with you again I'm looking forward to your spirit your anointing your word your inspiration God chose preaching to give us instruction to give us what we have need of in this day and in this hour amen praise God glory to God it's hot out there but it's much cooler and much better in here amen praise God let's turn to um the Book of Joshua we're going to continue along um the same thought just from a different perspective tonight because we know that um it's all him it's all him Joshua chapter 5 praise God let's just pray before we go to the word father thank you tonight Lord for another opportunity to be with you and to allow your spirit to come and plant seed within our hearts give us strength to encourage us Lord to manifest yourself and Lord you chose to preach your word so that you could place it into the hearts of your children and then you would interpret it through them in them you would be the greatest part of our lives Lord you are everything to us now Lord this has changed our lives and Lord we just look to continue this change little by little you said you will deliver your people and tonight Lord we're just looking for another one step closer one Revelation closer to that final change that we are under great expectation to receive granted we pray father bless and anoint your your word use the speaker use the hearers oh God to just bring your sweet spirit and your anointing in our midst granted we pray in Jesus name amen praise God forevermore Hallelujah amen you got to just be patient with me one second here because my my computer Rebooted and we're going to be reading from Joshua chapter 5. verse 13. we're going to start right there amen and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standeth is Holy and Joshua did so amen may the Lord add His blessings to the word of God Amen praise God what a wonderful um time on Sunday you may be seated on Sunday we were looking at how you know in the Book of Joshua chapter 1 the Lord said my servant Moses is dead he says now you Joshua you're going to take the people into the promised land you are going to go and I'm gonna be with you he says just be courageous be strong and know that I'll be with you and we know that the Lord moved in a supernatural way in the ministry of Joshua and as long as Joshua was under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and recognized who his instruction was coming from and did all that the lord gave him to do he would prosper everything that he did when he when he when he heard the Lord he obeyed the Lord he recognized the voice of the Lord he prospered amen praise God but I want you to notice here now Joshua's commission had started he had gone to the River Jordan he had crossed over by the spoken word he had recognized that the supernatural was with him he realized that that that this was not an ordinary Ministry that he had amen praise God we need to realize and recognize that we're not under some ordinary Ministry we are not under a church ministry we don't just belong in and are members of a church we are under the mystical body of Jesus Christ we're under the anointed Living Word of this hour and there's an interpretation that must be fulfilled through each and every one of our Lives amen praise God and so here I want you to notice that Joshua when he asks he says are you with us or are you against us well the angel of the Lord didn't turn around and say you know the captain you didn't say I'm with you and he didn't say I'm against you he just had some instruction for him praise God you see God's not interested in your plans God's interested in his plans God is going to stand behind his plans and will always do his own will purpose and plan regardless of how we see things how we interpret things how we want things to come to about how we expect things to happen amen praise God God had his own plans for Joshua God's got his own plans for you God's got his own plans for this church amen praise God it's not going to be according to our ways our thoughts our interpretation we've got many different kinds of interpretations but we're not interested in that we're interested in the word being fulfilled in this day and in this hour you see because God is only going to back his word he'll only back you if you're in the word glory to God Amen he'll only back you because he's the captain of the host he did not say he was with him he did not say he was against him because he has his own agenda Hallelujah that's what we're interested in amen we want his agenda we want to know what he has planned for us and we must be led by the spirit because the Lord is not going to change his plan for us hmm hallelujah praise God he's not going to change his plan for us Hallelujah glory to God not my will that's why not my will thy will be done Jesus came to the Earth imagine God made himself a body to dwell in came into a human form and when he came to the Earth he said very clearly to the people I come to do my father's will I don't come to do what you think there was so many interpretations on the on on on the Messiah when he was to come to the Earth you know they've got so many interpretations in this day of what they're expecting the Messiah to do but guess what they're always looking to what he's going to do they're always looking back to what he's done but they failed to see what he's doing right now Hallelujah and that's what we have come into that's what our calling is out of all about that's what called us he called us to fulfill the word in our day can you imagine that we've been called just like he called the disciples he was he was he was the Mighty God here on the earth and he was walking on the Earth but yet when he crossed by you know Matthew the tax collector you know seeing his condition seeing the way that he was seeing how he was hated he was not a loved person he was not popular he was popular but very unpopular in his popularity Hallelujah but Jesus turned to him one day and says Matthew follow me imagine you see God does things in such a strange and mysterious way and you just gotta look at your own life and you got to wonder why did he say follow me and why was it that when you heard it at the time and in the season that you were supposed to hear it that it completely changed your entire life changed your walk completely you had no idea what you were going to be coming into you had no idea that God could do the supernatural things that he was doing in your life because a lot of us we had some serious Jericho walls in our lives foreign hallelujah we're going to be looking at that we can't let squatters in our land When God Says listen I've called you out I'm going to use you I'm going to place you and he starts to give you the instruction for this day in this hour we got to watch how we walk with the Lord remember he's got a plan he told Joshua he says go and possess the land he says little by little I'm going to give you that land I'm going to give you the victory I'm going to give you the body change Hallelujah it ain't going to come just like you know just like you know in the way that you think it's going to come but it's going to come in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye and it's probably going to happen when you don't expect it but what what what do you got to be doing you got to be walking in the word you've got to be uh possessing your land you got to be taking possession of your calling your position in Christ you know Ephesians is all about placing and positioning Joshua went in took the land started to divide the land started to place the people in the land but they also had to possess the land they were not to allow the Canaanites and the jebusites and all the all the uh you know the squatters to come in and start you know taking control over their their their their their lives amen praise God it's still the same today we don't want to allow these things to come into our lives because God is obligated to his word he's not obligated to you as a human that has your own interpretation on how you're going to manifest or how you're going to live this word you got to let the spirit of God live in you that's your hope of glory that's your only opportunity amen praise God remember the Lord is watching over his own word not our interpretation ideas ways but his and interpretation so don't let down the bars because when sin comes into the camp God is not obligated to fight for you when you start to choose to go off into certain ways and you decide that you're gonna you know you're just gonna be a little bit slack in going to church you're just gonna any little excuse comes along ah I'm not gonna go you know oh well they need cleaners in the church uh I'm busy this weekend I'm tired you know you start to lose focus of your position in the body of Christ that that all that you're doing now is all that really matters in the in the in the spirit of God anything that you're doing now under the leadership of the spirit of God is all that really matters in your life did you know that I'm not saying that you got to forget about your normal Natural Life you've got a natural life but all that you do do it in the spirit of God do it with a right relationship with God we were talking about uh you know on Sunday how it's so important to approach every situation with the right relationship with the right kind of uh you know um position within the body of Christ knowing who you are knowing your responsibilities and knowing your obligations to God your respects unto the Lord your respects unto the house of the Lord your respects unto the leadership that God has given you it's so important not to lose sight of these things Hallelujah the mighty captain of the host is here today you see this was all a type everything that Joshua was experiencing was because God knew that they would have to face some serious Giants in the land they were going to have to face you know Jericho was on nine acres of land that's all it was it was a nine Acre parcel of land but it had walls and those walls were I don't know how many feet thick but I can tell you they were 66 feet high can you imagine that kind of a you know that's why Joshua was out there and he was looking at these walls and he was saying the Lord said that he's going to give me this land he's given me these he's given me the these people how in the world am I going to get over these walls how how are we going to get through these walls you may ask yourself those same questions but you know when you get to a place like that that's when God comes on the scene it's when you get to the to to a situation in your life that you just you don't know how you're going to get over it you don't know how you're going to get through it but God is going to make a way because he's going to honor his word when God honors his word the supernatural takes over remember God is Not natural he is Supernatural there's nothing natural about the Lord Jesus amen praise God hallelujah he's a mighty captain of the host he's here today and what's he doing he's revealing the word for our day he's giving us our instruction on how we are to overcome how we're going to get through these Great Walls you know you might look at a body change and you might think oh boy this is this is a major uh thing like how's we're not concerned about how God's going to do it we believe he's going to do it God is only interested in US believing amen praise God second Corinthians 10 3-4 says for though we walk in the flesh you might be in the flesh we do not war after the flesh we're not dealing with flesh and blood he says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they're not our ways they're not the way that we see things well there you go but Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and if there's any strongholds in your life guess what you stay with the word you stay under the leadership of the mighty Angel you allow your spirit to come under subjection you get into your position in the word of God halleluia you find your place in Christ and then you get into partnership with the Lord greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and everything starts to change amen hallelujah glory to God we need to you know but the thing is this we need to come to a place where we find that balance between us and the Lord you know it's a balance between God doing it all and you doing it all because in your mind as a human being remember as long as you're human you've got a will you've got this thing that that that's been placed in you which is called Pride to do things to be good at it to to to be better than than the rest you know that's all characteristics of this nature that God placed you know on us here on this Earth because of the human nature but there's a supernatural change that's taking place within us that the carnal mind is being moved aside and the supernatural mind of Christ is taking over amen but my spirit and your spirit should not lead us it should be the Holy Spirit that's leading us amen because if we're going to partner with God and and we're and and we're gonna work together in bringing this uh Supernatural body change that we're looking forward to then we need to partner with god with the right attitude Alleluia praise God it's a paradox but attitude is important your attitude will determine your altitude with the Lord because when you get rebellious and you get you know where you want to do it your way and it's my way or no way then God can't use you it's as simple as that Alleluia we have no confidence in the flesh so never overestimate the value of yourself you know it's part of humility it's part of humbling yourself before the Lord you know we we need to be you know uh we need to be very reverent towards the Lord and towards one another towards situations that we're dealing with on a daily basis you know tonight we're talking about you know because we chose because he chose because we chose a harder way because he's chosen a harder way for our lives when he chose our lives he chose a harder way but we need to realize that he's the one that chose he's the one that's taking control he's the one that's directing us guiding us and so we need to submit ourselves to that Supernatural element and allow him to do it glory to God Amen every thought that we think as human beings are against God our carnal Minds everything the way we see things the way we want to do things it's foolishness unto the Lord but when we filter it through the word of God it comes out a lot different and all of a sudden the supernatural can anoint the word of God and move us by the spirit Hallelujah we cannot trust our thoughts and actions we're too carnal glory to God the word is what judges all things not you not me but the word will judge the circumstances will judge the situations in our lives amen we need to recognize Who We Are and to deny that Christ Is In the Flesh and that he's now taking control is Antichrist we should not allow you know ourselves to to just become so carnal that we that that we don't recognize that there's a supernatural element within us that's fulfilling the word of God amen praise God listen here in Matthew chapter or sorry in Mark 16 verses 15 to 20 I want to read this now bear in mind we're we're we're we're working with the Lord everything that we're doing we're doing it so that perfect faith can come into our walk so that we can recognize that God is using us God needs us God wants to use us God wants to do great things through our lives we need to realize the balance between us our choices and God's choices but listen here in Mark 16 he says and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature this is our commission he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them now this is where you got to pay attention he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere now the key words the Lord working with them God is working with us God desires to do great things but he needs us to recognize that we have a part to do with it but he's the one that's doing it it's almost a paradox but we need to believe the Paradox because when we believe the Paradox it it humbles us it allows us to submit to the word of God it allows us to come under the leadership of the ministry and the way that God has designed the church that God is now using a five-fold Ministry to minister and speak the word of life and position each and every son and daughter of God so that they can fulfill this partnership with the Lord hallelujah the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following Hallelujah God is going to confirm his word and there's going to be Supernatural signs that will follow your life you need to recognize that that if you are now in the in the under you're under the leadership of God you recognize your day in the message you've recognized that God has called you he hasn't called you to just be a church member he's called you to fulfill his word he's in you greater is he that is in you that's going to fulfill the word but yet he needs you Hallelujah glory to God Amen amen listen in um in numbers 33 50 to 55 and the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you and destroy their pictures and destroy all their molten images and and quite pluck down all their high places and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein I have given you the land to possess it but yet he says you got to go and possess it you've got something that you've got to do but yet he says but I've given it to you so so so there's the Paradox right there so here we are now we're living this word we're walking this word we're we're we're we're the word made flesh in this hour and yet you know we're in a human form and and we're having battles in our minds as to whether things are going to work out or not God has a plan even when you walk the wrong way it's going to turn you back and bring you back because all things are going to work together for good to them that are called according to his purpose Hallelujah glory to God and he's you know he goes in here and you shall divide the land by lot and inheritance among your families and more and you shall give an inheritance glory to God Amen praise God look god listen to brother Branham here the Good Shepherd of the sheep look God told Israel way down in Egypt I have given you Palestine now he couldn't just just went up there and excommunicated the whole thing run them all out of the with a plague God could have done that God could have killed every every one of them off he could have went up there and sent fear among them and drove them out of the country but he said Israel it's yours you go get it so you've got a work to do you've got to possess this position that God has given you in Christ glory to God because the land that was given that was that was being given on his inheritance was their position in the word that's your position in the word and if you are slack and you're not doing what God wants you to do you're not assembling yourself you're not joining the ministry you're not supporting the ministry you're not paying your tithes you're not giving your offerings you don't got a revelation of this message it's as simple as that if you have a revelation you will support the work of God hallelujah praise God God doesn't listen go reach down and get them by the neck he says the land is yours every bit of it now the people today are expecting God to reach down and get them by the neck say yes that's right you bring me out clean me off heal me and I'll believe you God doesn't do his business that way Hallelujah he gives you the promise but you have got to fight for every inch of ground that you possess you see so many people say oh well you know brother how's how's it going you know how's it going with that job did you get that job he says well yeah you know we're working on it the Lord's gonna open the doors yeah but you know are you doing your party you're getting out there you're knocking some doors are you are you are you throwing the rock up because if you don't throw the rock up I'm just using that as an example I don't care what it is whether it's a sickness you know you there's whatever it is you've got some part to do you've got to possess that possession that God has given you he said I'm the Lord God that healeth all of thy diseases amen praise God you've got to possess that promise you're not going to just lay back and say oh well if it's the Lord's will for me to die I'm gonna die that's true but he's looking at your attitude he might knock you down because he wants you to get up he wants you to know what's in you that he's there but you've gotta you gotta you gotta take a step you gotta move forward there's something that you've got to do amen hallelujah glory to God yes he gives you the promise but you've got to fight for every inch why didn't God just go over there and just run out all the amorites and the Hittites and the and the parasites and all of them why didn't he just run them all out in the in the message stand still no Israel had something to do and you've got something to do he says God said the land is yours go and possess it hallelujah praise God amen glory to God listen Noah Genesis 6 13 22 and God said unto Noah we're going to look at some individuals that partnered with God and when they came under that that partnership and that leadership of the Holy Spirit they recognized they had a part to do like we said on Sunday if I'm going to choose a partner if God chose you it's because he knew that you would be able to do it God chose you because he knew you'd say Amen to his word God knew that you would take on the responsibility you would take on the challenge you would you would you would fight the good fight amen praise God and so here now Noah God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh has come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms Thou shalt you know and he gives them all the instructions and then write down to verse 21 and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them thus did Noah according to all that God commanded him so he did and when Noah did what God commanded him to do guess what he built an ark he built the the the the very uh uh word of God that God had given him that he was to manifest built everything that he needed to be delivered and to interpret God's word which said that only you in your household will I save he obeyed God he did everything Against All Odds they thought he was a cuckoo God gave him instruction to go and gather all this wood build this huge Ark but he did it against all the odds he didn't care what the people were saying he recognized that God had spoken to him have you recognized that have you come into a realization that you've come into contact with the Living God that's what's called us Saints we have a relationship with the Living God hallelujah praise God and then in Hebrews 11 7 by faith so by revelation God made known unto Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith aren't you glad you can receive revelation you know Satan hates revelation we talk about it all the time every time he hears that word it just hmm because he can't receive revelation Revelation is divine and only to the attributes of God do you know that only an attribute can receive perfect faith Revelation from the Lord you can't get it any other way oh but I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you don't need a revelation on that that's as plain and simple as it's right in the scripture nobody can tell me that anybody was ever baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost I don't care who you are bring me your Bible and show me where somebody was ever baptized into the titles of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost I'll show you 8 000 baptisms in the Bible where every one of them were in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so you do not need a revelation on the baptism you need a revelation of Who You Are once you come into a revelation of Who You Are then everything just makes sense all the word starts to become simple and plain because now God has given you his thoughts on what he meant in the word Hallelujah glory to God Amen praise God you know David one time you know in the book of Samuel David one time um then said David listen Samuel 17 45-52 David came into a relationship with the Lord you know he was out in the fields you know he was tending over the Sheep he was just a an ordinary guy you know he had other brothers that were a lot bigger than him and Dad thought that you know that David was just you know like uh like you know a ruddy you know kid you know out there you know smelling with the Sheep but God was building a relationship with David because David had a work to do David had to interpret the word of God in his day amen praise God and listen to David here and to Samuel then said David to the Philistine thou cometh to me with a sword now this is after you know David had a good relationship with with the Lord I hope that you've developed this kind of a relationship with the Lord amen I want you to put yourself in this place like David halleluia thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts Hallelujah the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defiled he said this day will the Lord deliver thee unto my hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give the carcass of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel Glory Hallelujah my God David when he stood up against that 14-foot giant all the people were looking and laughing at him and saying look at that look at him imagine him thinking that he's going to go up and he didn't even put any armor on and even even Goliath looked at him and laughed and was laughing and saying what you send me this dog you send me this this this little runt over here and you think that you're gonna no no David had a revelation David had an understanding in him he knew God was a deliverer amen do you know that God is a deliverer tonight do you know that God regardless of whatever you're facing I don't care what you're facing whatever regardless of what it is he's still the same God that can deliver you Hallelujah and if you've got a revelation on that then you've got something in your hand like David had Hallelujah he had some stones in his bag and he pulled one out Hallelujah glory to God and he put it into that sling and he knew that when he was when he was slinging that thing he knew that listen he he knew that a rock a small rock was not going to take down a a man of that stature of that size but it took the supernatural to come on the scene brother Corey oh yeah God knew that he would have to come on the scene to honor his word to back up his word he says I've made you my partner David don't you worry you've you've done all that I've asked you to do glory to God you've taken the instruction you've obeyed the instruction and now you're standing up against this giant he's going to be nothing to you just the same way I slew that lion that bear he says I can slay anything in your life glory to God he had faith and it wasn't the stone it wasn't the stone and the speed of the stone it was the anointed word of God that got behind that stone and honored the word of God and that stone smote him right between the eyes and he had to fall I don't care what you're dealing with it'll fall if you believe if you're in that relationship with the Lord there's nothing that can stand before you he says I'll be with you he said just be of good courage be of good courage he said a couple of times be of good courage there's nothing that can stand before you I've given it to you God has given you the rapture God has given you the body change this is the message of this hour we can talk about all kinds of things it doesn't matter we can get into all kinds of studies but it's always going to come right back to the Rapture of this church I couldn't get away from it I remember the very first when the Lord asked me to minister the word the only thing that would that would inspire me was the rapture my first message I remember it as you know because once in a while I go through you know some of my messages and I go right back and I see 1995 and the first message was caught up together caught up together to be with the Lord and I thought where in the world did you get that it's because the word the attribute was in here it was it was coming into manifestation and the word for this hour is the rapture Hallelujah everything that we've preached is about the rapture everything that the mighty Angel is giving you is Faith for the Rapture it's giving you faith for the change giving you Faith to walk this walk with confidence Allelujah glory to God Amen thank you Jesus having a good time by the grace of God because this message is is just remarkable glory to God hallelujah bless the name of the Lord Romans 7 for I know that in me that is in my flesh you know that you can't be looking to your own ability here in me that is in my flesh you know he had he had a revelation here dwelleth no good thing for to do for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not you see that's that's the Paradox Saints but he didn't say anything about the attribute he said greater is that that's in you and me that will overcome that will meet the challenges of the day that will overcome that will do listen listen to brother Brown here he's speaking here in 1955. he says did you know a man's worth only 84 cents in chemicals just enough chemicals about him a little bit of calcium and just enough whitewash to sprinkle A Hen's Nest and you know just just a few chemicals and then you walk around like you're worth a hundred million dollars and what are you anyhow that's what any of us is after a while we're going to lay out there in a graveyard and rot away we're not we're going to be changed now if God decides that we're going to lay this thing down well the Lord's will be done the lord giveth the lord taketh but I believe we're going to see the change halleluia I believe we're right there but that soul brother that's in there tonight in the front of God is worth 10 million worlds that's right you'll take care of that 84 cents but you'll just let anything come into that Soul no sir we feed on the word of God that's what we feed on that's that's our that's our life source that means everything to us amen glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord in John 15 four to five abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you accept you abide in me he said I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing but the Lord says I I need you I need you to come into your position I need you to stop with all your own interpretations don't look to the left don't look to the right just look straight down the middle of the road and stay balanced in the word of God allow the spirit of God to lead you and guide you this is the hour where we're being refined Ephesians chapter 4 for the perfecting of the church that's the Joshua commission amen halleluia God always likes to work through men God is working through us God needs us hallelujah it's God's program to work through men God wants to work through us men and women by the way Hallelujah do you believe that God works through men he made man his helper on Earth he made he made man a Lesser God than himself that's 1960 the unfailing realities of the Living God amen glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus thank you Lord glory to God therefore listen brother Brian the identified Christ of all ages so therefore he could tell the end from the beginning and in each age he lauded so much of his word in each age you know that you're that little lot that came in under that seventh seal you've heard about you know the seals in the Army there are special Elite group of individuals that are sent out as a special force they're like the special forces the seals they go and they deal with with things under inspiration and Revelation that nobody else has not even the other people that are in the lower ranks of the armies they don't know what they're up to God has a people like that here on this Earth right now we seem very strange in our ways we seem very strange in in our preaching it's it's like it's like our preaching is different but why is it different because it's it's full of Revelation it's full of inspiration it's full of God it's God speaking lip to ear to individuals giving them personal experiences and and and walking with them in a special Supernatural personal way and it makes us completely different Hallelujah but here he says he allotted a portion in each age and then usually man gets its Soul twisted up and the world gets in such a shape until he has to send some man anointed all ages has been the same this is from the message the identified Christ of all ages he's identifying himself again tonight in the message of this hour halleluia he says all ages as being the same he identifies himself upon the Earth in man God does nothing without man the Bible said so you know see he's always takes man because it was man he had to use and let the man put him on free moral agency knowing that he would fall in order to display his attributes as a savior all these things for there was nothing lost and therefore he chose man he could have chose Stars he could have chose trees but he chose man glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord in 1959 now he says well here Luke Luke chapter 10 verse 2 he says therefore said said he unto them the Harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth laborers into his Harvest why why is it that if God chose us God knows each and every one of us he chose us from before the foundations of the world but yet he's calling laborers to the Harvest he's saying come on take possession of your land take your position in Christ do what God has laid upon your heart God has placed certain gifts in you he didn't Place those gifts in you so that they could just sit idle he said stir the gift stir the the the the placing that God has given you get into your position and do what God needs you to do so that he can accomplish his plan why does he need to call laborers he says now watch it says in in my new ministry he says now now you say well if he knows it then then why are you preaching that's God it's part of God's program if God knew that everything if God knew the end from the beginning then why does he need to preach why does he need us to go and preach the word of God why am I up here tonight why do we have a church that we have to gather into because God has a program God has a plan God's calling a people into their positions so that they can go in the Fulfillment of the Rapture amen glory to God when he looked upon the apostles he looked upon the Harvest he said the Harvest is ripe but the laborers are few pray the Lord of the Harvest that he will send laborers into the Harvest how many remembers that well why would they have to pray to the Lord of harvest to send laborers into the into his Harvest if the lord of the Harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why God has so arranged it that's his now listen to this God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I hmm and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're in God's will doing his program let the musicians come Hallelujah glory to God the unveiling of god notice then we then we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him you and I are veiling the interpretation of God's word for this hour Christ in you as Christ was of God because God was in him made him God and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ he that believeth on me the works that I shall do he also see you become part of Christ as long as Christ is hid in you then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he is in you you are the temple you are templing Christ that's behind the veil the skin that we behind because of this Veil The Veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever aren't you glad that you're a Believer tonight aren't you glad that God by his grace and mercy has allowed you to hear his word recognize the day that you're living in recognize that he's doing something in this day that's going to change and because you were called to it everything concerning your whole life all your all your fears all your doubts all your plans you know people have oh I gotta I need a big retirement fund you know when I retire I I'm gonna need a lot of money for my retirement you know I need to have this and I need to have that and you know all these things are good there's nothing wrong with it you should have a retirement fund because nobody nobody's going to say oh the Lord's coming next week We Know by the word that that's being revealed to us that it could be at any time but remember brother Branham in his day with the Supernatural and the anointing that was happening around him he thought it was going to be that same night he said it could be tonight but then the Holy Spirit would come and unveil more of his word all of a sudden there was an opening of the seals there was an opening of the word and and now there's a calling that's going on and there's and there's a people that have come under this tremendous leadership of the mighty Angel the captain of The Host and he's calling us to speak Shout because remember they went seven days they were given instruction walk each day walk around the walls then go home day number two walk around the walls then go home you see just like the seven Church ages they all had an age and they all went home when they fulfilled their part in every age but then the seventh age came and he says on that seventh day I want you to go around seven times and I want you to gather the people together and I want you to come into a Unity I want you to recognize what I've done in your day I want you to see that there's a great shout right now that's taking place because there's a there's a people that are coming under a unified leadership of the mighty Angel himself bringing us together to to speak this word to shout this word there's a shout that's going on right now and that shout is breaking down every barrier every wall every unbelief everything that you thought that you couldn't overcome all the situations that you're dealing with in your life there's a supernatural anointing because of the unity of this bride she's shouting she's shouting together because they have the the same Revelation they've caught the word for their day they've recognized what God is doing today and the trumpet and the voice is all shouting together and it's going to bring about a supernatural change and all the walls are going to crumble down around our lives whatever situation and we will move out of this Dimension and we will go into a new dimension we will go into a place where nothing but perfect love can enter into that place nothing but perfect Unity can enter into that place so let go and let God get rid of all that garbage in our lives amen hallelujah because there's a shout in the camp let us pray father we thank you tonight and
