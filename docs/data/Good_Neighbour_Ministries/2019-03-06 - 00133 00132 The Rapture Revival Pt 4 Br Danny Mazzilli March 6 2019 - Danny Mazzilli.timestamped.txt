[0:20] [Music]
[0:40] this is the moment that Satan who's in
[1:12] tries to give you a bottle yeah they
[1:16] don't appreciate you
[1:19] [Music]
[1:31] [Music]
[1:46] [Music]
[1:51] [Music]
[2:10] [Music]
[2:26] [Music]
[2:54] [Music]
[2:57] just like God use it you want to get
[3:01] better and better the better you watch
[3:04] God just say okay
[3:13] [Music]
[3:22] because people recognize how God is
[3:27] using you you think you're on earth yes
[3:30] if you get a huge blessing
[3:32] God said to a billion dollars or
[3:34] something like that you just want to
[3:36] hide if you give you actual ordinate you
[4:17] can't be anything that they're not it's
[4:19] God leads you the way that you are if
[4:23] you're seeing certain things and you're
[4:25] able to see beyond and and certain
[4:28] change of circumstance of st. Matthew
[4:30] bound in your thinking in certain ways
[4:32] then the Word of God is here tonight so
[4:34] release you from
[4:37] three Purple's bondages we'll have to
[4:40] change that are holding you back from
[4:42] d-day men it'll be in the line for as
[4:49] the body is one and hath many members
[4:51] and all the members of that one body
[4:54] being many our luck so awesome
[5:00] see this is all very clear right here so
[5:03] for by the one spirit are we all
[5:05] baptized into one body whether we be
[5:08] Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or
[5:10] free and have been all made to drink
[5:13] into one spirit for the body is not
[5:16] whatever beautiful let's look at the
[5:24] next slide the Spirit of God when you
[5:28] get a chance I'm not gonna be on
[5:30] Corinthians well you get a chance though
[5:32] and read it after you hear the word and
[5:36] after that you know the fact that were
[5:37] that were that were allowing only
[5:40] spirited to search and dig into our
[5:42] lives with go back read the scriptures
[5:45] you will see how they come alive how
[5:47] they come to life in your day right now
[5:49] how the Greeks feed into your position
[5:52] as a son or daughter of God but God's
[5:55] Spirit displays God's power through each
[5:58] of us as a means of the entire body it's
[6:03] a means of the entire body because using
[6:06] every one of us but it's actually him
[6:09] displaying himself in his entirety to
[6:14] this world
[6:25] so what a spiritual gift so in part
[6:30] because it helps a lot in a row you see
[6:34] whether the gifts get into their
[6:36] positions the body grows the body gets
[6:40] healthy the body gets strong the body is
[6:44] able how to to do greater things you
[6:48] know what can cast out a thousand two
[6:51] can cast out 10,000 imagine that we get
[6:55] into the into the unity of the Spirit of
[6:57] God in our position and allow the Holy
[7:00] Spirit to operate that way but this
[7:02] church special church Saints this is not
[7:12] this is not a normal ministry if you
[7:15] recognize over the years you must've
[7:18] realized God gave us a unique leader
[7:20] Todd gave us unique leadership Pradas
[7:24] placed within the church body certain
[7:27] aspects of the positive he is working by
[7:30] firefight by a level of Revelation that
[7:33] you seldom know unless you're here
[7:41] listen to other ministers and because
[7:49] God place you believe this is where we
[7:55] get
[7:56] this is where we received a supernatural
[8:01] inspiration of God that gives each one
[8:03] of us and empower us every one of us in
[8:07] our positions in need
[8:09] it just it just simplest it comes so
[8:12] simple there's an anointing on the Word
[8:14] of God sometimes you listen and you know
[8:17] you're listening to surface and there's
[8:19] just no anointing there's nothing that
[8:21] that's feeding you well maybe it's
[8:23] because that's not your pastor and you
[8:26] are not clear yet who their customers
[8:30] [Music]
[8:32] you can be done for 10 years and still
[8:35] be done in London because you're
[8:41] watching me because you're not allowing
[8:43] the Spirit of God to settle you and you
[8:47] know to just let go of certain attitudes
[8:51] and certain you know negative stinking
[8:56] thinking that's just where we're
[8:58] creatures of the environment right so
[9:00] sometimes we pick up steam can take
[9:02] another get rid and allow the Spirit of
[9:05] God to move us into our position
[9:15] [Music]
[9:34] [Music]
[9:36] cleaner hops over there cleaning your
[9:43] your attitude is not just right and you
[9:48] feel I shouldn't be doing this or what I
[9:52] do this I'm just using that as an
[9:54] example could be whatever it is what
[9:57] weird is that God prepared to be in your
[10:03] position when you're in that position
[10:08] understanding how to identify how it's
[10:11] so necessary to strengthen identify the
[10:14] body of Christ
[10:15] it changes your attitude they don't
[10:18] waken to you to see your position a lot
[10:20] clearer next slide when we read Matthew
[10:26] 25 over here read this
[10:28] but it's all about with the court you
[10:30] know you can engage so many talents to
[10:34] serve servants now they've had some of
[10:37] them they took those talents and they
[10:39] put into service and put them to work
[10:41] they put into action they use them for
[10:43] the glory of God and they multiply they
[10:46] multiply they started to bring forth
[10:49] fruit that their ministry began to grow
[10:52] all of a sudden you know from one
[10:53] individual that was you know clean the
[10:56] church the others and competitors a team
[10:58] there's a there's a group disembodiment
[11:01] that's working together they're things
[11:03] joined together in there they're
[11:04] operating my faith and they realize that
[11:07] how important it is for the body to have
[11:10] you know a clean house the Lord's house
[11:15] [Music]
[11:42] [Music]
[11:47] [Music]
[11:54] [Music]
[12:02] [Music]
[12:17] [Music]
[12:38] [Music]
[12:43] it's just gonna be a sweet you know
[12:46] honeymoon when you come to Christ
[12:48] there's a great battle but you can know
[12:51] that the great Jehovah God stands right
[13:02] [Music]
[13:17] [Music]
[13:32] [Music]
[13:45] [Music]
[13:56] [Music]
[14:12] [Music]
[14:22] the Church of God be perfected
[14:30] [Music]
[14:38] [Music]
[15:06] [Music]
[15:12] [Music]
[15:32] he was somebody in while that one little
[15:56] gift is so important in the body of
[15:59] Christ so important this church you need
[16:04] to realize that these are not God to use
[16:07] you and place you and give you their
[16:10] position no matter who you are how old
[16:13] you are it's irrelevant if you
[16:17] that's the spirit of God and realizing
[16:20] that this is the truth that this message
[16:23] there's no higher revelation of the
[16:26] Spirit of God on this earth than this
[16:28] revelation of what God is doing in this
[16:31] day I'm not talking about this church
[16:32] I'm talking about the body of Christ the
[16:35] Church of Jesus Christ the Spirit of God
[16:38] because Jesus is very much alive
[16:41] he rose in order to fulfill the
[16:45] scripture see he rules in order to come
[16:48] into you and me so that he can fulfill
[16:50] his purpose and plan and take this plan
[16:53] of redemption right to the next page
[16:59] that's like so five-point conscience
[17:04] these are things that we want to just
[17:06] look at don't confuse gifts with natural
[17:10] talents you could have natural talents
[17:15] but yet it's not the gift that God gave
[17:19] you for the body you see there's there's
[17:24] like you know it's almost like a paradox
[17:28] right because you don't think we can be
[17:30] gifted in many different ways but it
[17:33] doesn't mean that that's the thing that
[17:35] you're going to fulfill in the body of
[17:37] Christ
[17:39] don't confuse gifts with the fruit of
[17:42] the Spirit fruit shows maturity as you
[17:47] grow in front of the fruit of the Spirit
[17:49] which is the spirit of love compassion
[17:52] and love for one another and all of
[17:55] those things that that shows maturity
[17:57] but the gifts they show your mystery
[18:02] they show you a ministry in the body of
[18:05] Christ the purpose and oncology deal
[18:09] where give protection tendency in other
[18:13] words expecting others to serve the way
[18:15] that you
[18:22] you want to look at something because
[18:25] you're doing a certain thing and becomes
[18:27] your your puck gets seen right your Park
[18:31] gets seen and it could become depleted
[18:33] it could be with whatever mystery and
[18:35] then you expect somebody else to be
[18:38] doing that why are they because maybe
[18:45] you got my own business too many people
[18:50] gossiping talking about other people let
[18:59] the Holy Spirit move through the Word of
[19:02] God God could speak he's no continues to
[19:06] do tend to direct dye to lead this
[19:09] church run from this place here
[19:11] gentlemen starts right here in the house
[19:14] of water needs to say something position
[19:16] people and give them a little push he'll
[19:19] do it don't worry about need we don't
[19:21] need to allow that spirit because Satan
[19:24] what he tries to do he just I put a
[19:26] little pasta party tries to put a little
[19:28] credible spirit on you and before you
[19:30] know it you're starting to put little
[19:33] edges between brothers and sisters no
[19:36] baby that has to stop
[19:39] just saying that these types of things
[19:42] are the kinds of things that the Delta
[19:45] tries to use to try to get people to you
[19:48] know print division between one another
[19:50] that's the tactics of the depth don't
[19:58] feel your gifts make you superior to
[20:01] others these are the things that we need
[20:04] to just know we need to help the more
[20:06] you humble yourself to greater time can
[20:08] you realize that using your gifts
[20:11] without love is worthless
[20:14] so you wanna exercise you know your
[20:18] office in your position and you want to
[20:20] exercise it like that like a dictator
[20:22] you wanna you wanna so dark places you
[20:25] over the cleaning crew and you want to
[20:27] be a dictator instead of loving each one
[20:30] of those individuals that's working with
[20:33] you and having that Satan purpose and
[20:36] plan and mold which is the rapture
[20:38] that's our goal our goal is the rapture
[20:42] in our illness that translation so that
[20:44] we can go for a mess
[20:48] [Music]
[21:01] I may be able to speak the languages are
[21:05] very even angels this is the interpreted
[21:08] right from the first Canadians I'm they
[21:10] have gift of inspired preaching I we
[21:13] have all knowledge and all the things to
[21:15] do problems but if I don't have love I'm
[21:21] talking genuine love of God now when you
[21:25] see one of your brothers and sisters
[21:27] down or or in a bad attitude because
[21:34] sometimes you know listen we're in human
[21:38] flesh sometimes the powers of the
[21:40] defects are Pierce and they can get
[21:43] pretty beaten up and all of a sudden is
[21:46] you know there's an atmosphere around my
[21:48] brother sister like you that's not what
[21:57] it is you need to realize if you're in
[22:00] the body of Christ that you know that
[22:01] your son or daughter God you gotta
[22:04] realize that that is your flesh that is
[22:07] human weakness
[22:08] you gotta see beyond that and you can
[22:14] [Music]
[22:24] [Music]
[22:27] Christ you
[22:30] it's not question dealing with and so
[22:34] you can actually project that love of
[22:36] God into that situation and I'm not
[22:38] seeing you've gotta be a pushover and
[22:40] you gotta let them push forward and this
[22:42] is not dog but you can simply double you
[22:44] say listen brother the system that we
[22:47] need to sit down and we need to pray
[22:48] together so that so so that we can both
[22:53] overcome this thing that that you know
[22:56] that that is challenging both of us
[22:58] because I'm involved for some reason and
[23:02] if I have been both because God is
[23:04] building and shaping needed certain ways
[23:06] through my position for my office
[23:09] whatever it is has a deacon dealing with
[23:12] individuals dealing with families
[23:14] dealing with certain situations we've
[23:16] got to have certain you know patience in
[23:19] the way that we deal with certain things
[23:20] but God knows how shape us for parents
[23:24] hold us so that we can operate in these
[23:27] positions but if we have a revelation of
[23:30] that the power of love what is projected
[23:34] into a situation
[23:36] grayskin table and the saints not just
[23:39] talking if i have seen it with my only
[23:41] twice and i know you have to when you've
[23:45] been genuine and you can you can weep
[23:48] deprive that person you see it change
[23:50] you see it like like all the sudden they
[23:52] just you have to tell
[24:03] [Music]
[24:16] these are gifts that were just looking
[24:20] at gifts within the body of Christ these
[24:21] are gifts that communicate God's work
[24:24] and communicates the unbelievers and
[24:26] believers first gift is preaching we
[24:31] realize that there's you know that all
[24:33] these these are all different gifts but
[24:34] we need to see how they activate within
[24:36] the body of Christ and they communicate
[24:38] birth management that's discernment of
[24:43] the Spirit you know when you go to your
[24:46] pastor you go to your deacon or you go
[24:49] to fellowship with certain brother or
[24:52] sister you know that there could be a
[24:54] gift of discernment that's right there
[24:57] in the midst of your fellowship and it
[24:59] will supernaturally discern certain
[25:02] situations and speak to your situations
[25:05] and deliver you it will deliver you
[25:10] because certain individuals have that
[25:13] gift in them and it just activates
[25:16] because it's the Spirit of God because
[25:19] the person has the love of God as a
[25:22] revelation of third up they're placing
[25:25] in the body of Christ that their desire
[25:27] is only to see them the further lift of
[25:30] the body to see them be strengthened to
[25:32] see it be encouraged right next slide
[25:35] next slide and then an apostle the
[25:40] ability to start new churches know
[25:42] received a boat these are all arms
[25:44] within the church and we've got some
[25:47] individuals that are anointed
[25:49] they're pulling out that are there on
[25:51] the mission field that are out there and
[25:54] they're actually assisting other parts
[25:57] of the body in different parts to world
[26:00] and that's a gift and that's the
[26:02] position that God has given them and
[26:04] they need to operate in that position
[26:06] they can't be held back
[26:08] they have to be encouraged they have to
[26:11] be supported if we know we've got
[26:13] certain broken in the church for that
[26:15] for certain gifts certain abilities
[26:18] God will fade away got to open the doors
[26:20] stop we use them in those areas next I
[26:25] get educators people teaching we got
[26:29] Sunday school of course anetha teaching
[26:33] that comes from the bulkan front of the
[26:34] five for visiting they go be a pastor
[26:37] they asked all all kinds of gifts within
[26:40] them to teach to inspire to preschool
[26:52] teacher because that's you know you take
[27:06] that gift serious it's because God is
[27:09] still working on you got still hoping
[27:14] [Music]
[27:28] [Music]
[27:47] because now they're seeing the purpose
[27:53] now I see what they're supposed to be
[27:55] doing instead of encouragement to us you
[28:10] know we should all be encourages I
[28:12] believe children of God there encourages
[28:14] we should always be looking for the good
[28:17] don't worry talking correct about
[28:21] correcting in the body of Christ is kind
[28:24] of obvious positions through the Word of
[28:26] God but we should be encourages you can
[28:30] correct by encouraging certain
[28:36] individuals that just filled encouragers
[28:40] I'll sit and eventho shoot with everyone
[28:43] I feel the birds I'll feel strengthened
[28:45] I feel I feel like I feel incurs I feel
[28:50] straight out to go on and overcome in
[28:53] this situation wisdom God places wisdom
[28:58] in the body of Christ
[28:59] these are certain gifts that embraces
[29:01] within the body in order to build the
[29:04] body in order to direct the body you see
[29:12] you've got to be willing he come from
[29:19] it comes from God and it comes in its
[29:24] season and it comes through its office
[29:27] and through its position at the right
[29:29] time the season when certain wisdom
[29:32] needs to come from the pasture to the
[29:35] individuals he has certain offices and
[29:37] certain positions God who's in that
[29:40] plate because there's faith on both ends
[29:43] in that particular circumstance or
[29:47] situation when it comes to the film the
[29:50] major aspects of leadership are financed
[29:54] with motorbike as much as the trustee
[29:56] you know in dealing with finance dealing
[29:58] with them with the church in certain
[30:00] ways and God direct the pastor given the
[30:03] inspiration and
[30:07] [Music]
[30:17] [Music]
[30:21] when you just when you can just give
[30:24] ourselves missions
[30:25] it's another you might find yourself
[30:29] inspired to get more towards the
[30:31] missions to maybe support Commission's
[30:34] in certain ways are however these are
[30:37] all triggers this is a Bible study
[30:39] tonight so that we can be triggered in
[30:42] the Word of God to see where it is that
[30:44] God wants us to operate next it's the
[30:47] ability to adapt to the different
[30:48] culture in order to reach unbelievers
[30:51] and how believers from that culture
[30:53] through missions next gives them educate
[31:01] possible service certainly whatever be
[31:07] needed by the service you'll be like
[31:09] whatever there's events readily ready to
[31:13] serve you sisters you know when it comes
[31:15] to certain things we have guest speakers
[31:17] we have you know guest
[31:19] visitors to the church and all of a
[31:22] sudden we have like you know the sisters
[31:24] prepare meals and all these things the
[31:26] simple things but when you're ready to
[31:29] act when you aren't all the time it
[31:31] shows that you have faith and you're
[31:35] ready to serve God's people
[31:37] amen mercy you know these are these are
[31:41] little things have no we should be able
[31:45] to come to one another and go to one
[31:47] another and not be condemned you know we
[31:51] should be able to find mercy if it's not
[31:54] in our circumstance
[31:56] one another we should be merciful people
[31:59] I bought cells still these are unique
[32:03] things by kilowatt it's true we need to
[32:07] get over we're dealing with certain
[32:08] situations and circumstances we should
[32:11] have these situations because we should
[32:25] be there could be other pastors we don't
[33:10] know only God knows but it's it's a gift
[33:15] people give is
[33:21] it's a revelation but suddenly catch the
[33:25] revelation of giving
[33:27] it's a powerful link they can change
[33:30] your financial life because you're doing
[33:35] it my fate you've been placed into the
[33:38] body
[33:38] given that ability now you can actually
[33:41] allow it to operate through you thanks
[33:44] the ability to generously contribute
[33:47] material resources and we were running
[33:51] the other 10% time so that the body that
[33:54] probably be strengthened the ability to
[33:57] earn advantage money so it may be given
[34:00] to support the ministry others powerful
[34:05] the gift and the reputation are giving
[34:09] his next intersection
[34:12] these are gifts that celebrate God's
[34:15] presence he's a good beaten to be a
[34:18] prayer warrior to be faithful in prayer
[34:21] to intercede for the body of Christ for
[34:24] the local church for the leadership for
[34:27] your pasta for your career offices in
[34:31] the church the trustees and the Deacons
[34:33] of the prison and the Sunday School

[34:39] individual that that intercedes
[34:41] constantly in prayer using if you've got
[34:44] to give it to music

[34:47] operator to really get into that
[34:49] position and encouraged opposition

[35:21] is going to heal you hungry so they have
[35:23] shown you something in your heart and

[35:27] going to do it you don't have to be you
[35:32] have to be you know publicly you know
[35:36] keep that gift people about the Spirit
[35:39] of God to use it it'll build the body it
[35:41] will strengthen the body and then will
[35:43] be an encouragement to the body of
[35:45] Christ the ability to prison faith
[35:48] specifically for people who need
[35:50] physical emotional or spiritual healing
[35:52] and seek on its merits this we hope
[36:03] witness miracles and we witness them
[36:06] through our intercession and prayer
[36:09] through our you know directing and
[36:15] guiding leading through the preaching of
[36:18] the word God
[36:20] we've heard testimonies of individuals
[36:22] receiving miracles because the word God
[36:24] spoke from to that situation they live
[36:27] that's tongues and interpretation of
[36:31] tongues if it's a genuine gift it's
[36:34] gonna operate it's gonna operate by the
[36:36] Spirit of God there's going to be
[36:38] speaking in tongues there's going to be
[36:39] an interpretation it's not going to be
[36:42] confused
[36:43] it's not going to be but they're not
[36:44] give this in the body of Christ and when
[36:47] it was the operating will not operate in
[36:49] such a way that it will be confusion
[36:54] that God's given you a different
[36:58] interpretation of the tongues when you
[37:00] hear the toxin will have interpretation
[37:03] supernaturally placed in you to speak
[37:06] that's the way I was given the gift of
[37:15] interpretation and finally the gifts
[37:20] that supported all purposes and give
[37:23] some leadership but you know places you
[37:26] into leadership positions for a reason
[37:29] because he wants you to direct the God
[37:32] in most areas of the body of Jesus
[37:34] Christ and they need to stay in those
[37:37] positions of God's place you there and
[37:39] you need to move in that position you
[37:42] need to strengthen that position you
[37:45] need to do things that will that will
[37:47] strengthen your gift read research it'll
[37:53] do what you need to do in order to you
[37:55] know become more effective than that
[37:57] gift to get the leadership and to give
[37:59] the demonstration and so the next line
[38:04] says think it's a it's a it's a
[38:10] tremendous thing to go that you've been
[38:13] given the revelation of God's Word on
[38:15] the organization the part that you are
[38:19] the faith of operate in that position in
[38:23] whatever capacity God has given it and
[38:28] so it's the ability to trust God and
[38:31] what cannot be seen and God's promise
[38:35] regardless of what
[38:39] it's a willingness to risk failure
[38:41] pursuit of a body provision expecting
[38:45] God
[38:47] this is just a plain simple
[38:50] interpretation but we know that faith is
[38:54] when God supernaturally reveals to you
[38:57] that you know God revealed that God is
[39:07] able to do it you don't you know you
[39:10] don't fear don't fear the devil you
[39:13] don't fear the lies about that was gonna
[39:15] tell you all you're not gonna do it
[39:17] you're not though you do believe that
[39:19] you move forward
[39:20] what because the next slide says that
[39:24] this bride here is the secret the word
[39:27] is enterprise it's the same spirit is
[39:31] Christ in you and the mind of Christ to
[39:36] know what he was done she does it in his
[39:42] name she has thus saith the Lord that an
[39:46] experiment eyes so all these spirit
[39:48] waters in my brother's broad and serves
[39:51] its purpose
[39:54] so it's not about currently positioning
[39:57] people into certain positions and
[40:00] currently we are maturing now we are
[40:06] will be beyond that you need some help
[40:09] we need some direction
[40:10] it will be there you will know God is
[40:13] inspiring
[40:14] you've got us beaten God give you a
[40:15] dream God lead to the search scripture I
[40:18] will show you who you are in the Word of
[40:21] God because this is what he's done he's
[40:24] placed the spirit at you let the
[40:27] musicians come the next line says and
[40:34] this is the conclusion the word bride
[40:38] have made yourself so it's it's a
[40:45] paradox we're being given the faith
[40:49] we're moving into our positions we're
[40:53] doing that sometimes unconsciously but
[40:56] this is the other word becomes conscious
[40:58] we're now you see yourself more that's
[41:01] called perfect faith when you see
[41:04] yourself your decision the part that you
[41:06] are operating in that position and see
[41:10] it actually right here
[41:18] god bless your six
[41:20] I trusted you even stir in certain ways
[41:23] you know kind of just about yourself to
[41:26] assert yourself and look at these
[41:29] different aspects and it should be
[41:31] encouraging because a lot of you are
[41:33] doing with a fantastic
[41:41] your dedication here in your time you
[41:44] know your sincerity towards the body of
[41:48] Christ right here we need each other
