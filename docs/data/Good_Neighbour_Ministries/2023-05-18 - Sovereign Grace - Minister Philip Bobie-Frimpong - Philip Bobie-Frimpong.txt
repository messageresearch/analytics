few years watch his hair turned gray and slipped out his shoulders dropped down a beautiful young girl standing with it with a scented Godly face on her and standing and praising God and I come back in a few years and find her stupid shoulder back in two or three children well my day it shows that in this body there is death no matter how well and how lovely it looks it still got death in it no I watch which a way that is spread in their leans it was always representing light speaking of light talking of light it'll go with the light but if it's always on the other side of the world on the things of the world influenced by the world there is nothing but to turn into darkness when it dies into the outer Darkness so you see what we are we must remember we are only what we are by the grace of God and none of us can brag about it we can only bow in our adoration and humility before God and give him praise amen as though that was saw a really nice quote there let's sing the anchor holes

praise God let's go spot on our clouds I know some of you work some of us work in the day and it's not easy to be here on the weekdays but let's check everything out from us and just come to the presence of God Amen um okay I think okay let's pray first oh our heavenly most gracious wonderful father God your name is the Lord Jesus Christ and you never lose a battle you never lost a patience you never lose a case father we come here tonight knowing very well that we ourselves we are nothing without you we invite the great Holy Ghost who spoke to Adam the call of the evening to come and speak with us we have confidence that anytime we come here father you you meet us because if the prophet said when we come at a certain point in time he knows we're going to be there that angel of God cast there before we even get here so we know you are here with us come and speak take me aside Lord and use me for your glory and honor may you anoint your children to hear from you oh God and it's all like you will come against it in the name of Jesus during the day if you have done anything wrong or any thought pass through our mind all ID we ask for forgiveness you have confidence that the blood of Christ it washes us from all unbelief so may you come and take absolute control of the reminder of the service father we thank you and we love you in Jesus name amen okay um as scripture will be taken from the career the career chapter Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse 1 to 7. I was just trying to print some quotation and just struggle with it so you just bear with me and couldn't print it at home came here couldn't print it still but God is in control no worry amen so the career chapter 4 verse 1. and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is weak out of his sleep and said unto me worst years down and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of God with a bow upon the top of it and this and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olives three by eight one upon the right side of the ball and the other up on the left side thereof so I said it I answered and spoke the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me no words not thou not what this be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spoke unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto this is the word of the Lord unto zeruba bell saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit said the Lord of hosts most of my thoughts were here who are thou o great Mountain that shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace on trait let's pray Heavenly Father may you bless this Rhythm of the word bless your people and bless and bless take control of that reminder of the service we thank you for the victory in your name amen please be seated Hallelujah so um if I were to title it I'll tell it to my title will be Sovereign Grace um as we read it said not by power not by might by my spirit says the Lord so has been coming to my heart from the whole last week it's not the mountain that is Holy by the holy God in the mountain make the man thing holy it's not a holy church may God in the people make the people holy so if you come here and think that this because you've come to this year will take you no but you have to be in the mystical Body of Christ you have to your name has to be written in the last book of life before the foundation of the world coming here with the same people with the same Faith congregate for us to receive the word of God to just identify us and to bring us more closer to God so it's not the church but the holy ghost in the church make the difference it was never the apostles but Christ in them that makes a difference the book of us where the holy ghost in the people that makes the difference and somebody like Samson said that he was very short and like mommy's boy but when the spirit of God comes to him he do wonders he can kill the lion he can do so many things so it wasn't something but it was a spirit of Christ in Samson that made the difference so tonight is not by your power or your might but by the spirit of God is the spirit that quickened to making life and that spirit is singing which is the Holy Ghost God himself that's why I said that um those who worship me will worship me what in truth and in spirit you need both the mechanics and the Dynamics amen there has to be a balance you can't just stay all of the mechanics but you also cannot stay all of the Dynamics both have to come together then it does the work amen so it's the same yesterday today and forever amen so Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God Amen if you are a son or a daughter of God nobody can determine your moves because you are not bound by a system when you are bound by a system the devil knows you every move but they said the the world it listed and it goes forever it goes so when you are led by Spirit of the Living God you can be led to do something today God will move rather way other way so nobody can really determine and pinpoint and kind of um see or move because the devil doesn't know what God is doing that's why it's important that when God reveals something to you you have to keep it to yourself don't just go ahead speaking everything that God wants you all your plans don't speak it out because those who are speaking to them they cannot do nothing to you but when you speak the devil hears it and sometimes go ahead and make things um mess things up but once it's in your heart nobody knows it when they move then they surprise everything it surprised everybody so it's better we try to keep things in our heart until when God wants you to speak amen so all that I'm talking today when you read the scripture is what Grace Grace we all know that Jesus Christ is The Headstone and the Cornerstone at the same time but the headstone the Cornerstone the Hearthstone was rejected is that right when you look at the pyramid it has no Capstone The Headstone was not there it is Christ which is capping the bride now and it cannot it could never have come in the time of Luther and all those pages couldn't come it only came when God sent the prophet of God to restore all things that was the right time to bring it in and now it's a bride of Christ Christ is the head in the body moving and doing the same thing he's in the bright riding the trail Once More Jesus Christ is for the same yesterday today and forever whatever his date in the past is gonna be doing the same thing amen If they raise the dead we are raising the dead in Jesus name they heal their state the sins of God are Healing The Sick because the same God if you ocean the ocean over there you take a glass of water it has the same water qualities but you are not the fullness but we are part part of that and it contains so the same God said I will be with you even in you unto all the consummation of time so the same God that created heaven and earth he seen you and in me today all that you have you have to have confidence that God that has brought us this far is able to take us the end amen he's a wonderful God Hallelujah praise that God so what are you am I saying I'm talking about the grace of God and Grace is unmerited favor a favor that God gave to you and me that none of us Merit it because not by words of righteousness but his grace and grace and grace alone the first time thy judgment Came Upon the Earth was the Garden of Eden the next judgment will be on the white throne the white throne and the right Throne judgment and in the Garden of Eden man Adam and Eve disobeyed God's word and when that happened the whole thing was black the human race was supposed to be black out there was no way for man because God has said in his word the day you partake that off you will die and God couldn't kill Eve and leave Adam because Adam took part knowing that he loved if he didn't want God to destroy him so he also partake part with it so God couldn't destroy Adam by the grace of God came and killed an animal to cover what to cover their sins and you cannot cover your sins with religion it has to be the blood of Christ you have to repent you must receive the Holy Ghost amen so when that thing happened it was so black and God came Grace took over and gave life back to Adam but what did that Grace did when the grace took over God stepping and make a promise that the woman's seed will bruise the head of the serpent and the serpent was also what Bruce the hill will will also bruise the heels is that right okay the woman's seat will bruise the head of the serpent seed and the Seven also bruise the hill that means that you're gonna go to afflictions Christianity is not a bed of ease we're gonna go through afflictions but God promised you're gonna have to have triumphant in all afflictions that we ever gonna go through because there's a way God said I'll never give you anything that you cannot what bear so by the thing of it is you must go through afflictions you must go through trials he said those that I love I chastise and what I rebuke so you're gonna go through trials some people when they see their crowds and see the trials that they facing they don't want to face it they just run away but no wonder Peter said that where can we go thou alone has eternal life preaching the gospel dedicating yourself to serve God it doesn't come easy it comes with a cross you're gonna go through a lot of things the brightest people that nobody said for you to know what people are going through at the background everything you do the devil is there to attack you another way but God greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so you promise he will conquer through you he's the same yesterday today and forever I just now give an example just recently it's just a little bit thing it's already the big thing but just for you to know just something small I gave that um on the 10th of March I went to work whilst on the or I went to meet somebody to give a quotation for a job his name is Frank when I went there we began to talk and I told him how that um my uh my wife is going to Africa Ghana and when she left now I really appreciate her more because now I've got to do most of the things taking care of the case preparing food doing this you have to do all the trust plus working at the same time so I said that I really appreciate him when she comes then she sorry he opened up and also told me that Phil I am a builder I'm a framer and the man is in his late 70s or early 80s he said that um I've been building for years I've been doing a framing I'm doing everything my wife is home and he's always taking care of house chores but recently but yeah also she's been striking with sickness and she can't do anything so this man in his late 70s has to go home take care of every trust at home and he said he's getting tall on me and I began to uh feel for him so whilst I was coming home about five minutes to get home I began to think about him and I said okay I'm gonna put a prayer request I was thinking how to go about the prayer request how to grow everything about two minutes to get to my house boom I step on the black ice have a big accident and my car went like that hit it he came back and then you begin to spin and facing some oncoming traffic and I have to scream Jesus Jesus and the Lord helped me to navigate away from it but I'm trying to say that I went there only last week the man I saw the lady she's healthy moving around perfectly we're doing everything right but you know just a little prayer to go for somebody to get delivered from her infirmities you see how the enemy tried to attack me everything to destroy me so it's not a bed of ease but you got to take the cross that thing has come upon us we must take the charge we must face the enemy we must cut all the amalekites and move on because God Is So this he will never leave us and forsake us just two weeks ago too I have to they gave me a rented car the max is new I went to a a car base to wash my car I hang it there a young kid but 23 years he saw the car he has the same to began to talk then it led to the scriptures and I began to speak and I saw the anointing of what came on me speaking boldly cartoon has everything from the boy that is not right to help him by the time I realized the new match that's the car I wake up is gone why the enemies to also try to attack me just not to to say that you are gonna release that boy I'm not going to attack you here is that the little thing that I'm just letting you know but all I'm trying to say is that you're gonna go through afflictions but don't give up because I said many are afflictions of their righteous but God was what would take would take care of this though don't worry about your afflictions just move on and serve God because he gonna make a way for you Hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah and Abraham Noah also found Grace in the eyes of God it's not how handsome no one is or how brilliant to anything by the grace of God came to Noah out of Brilliance in his age is him alone that God save him and his family because of the grace of God Abraham was not even a duty began he was a gentile he was living in a city called children and God and he led to all he had the voice of God through the grace of God and he followed that voice but the thing is when God called Abraham he called him alone to separate him from his his descendants his people but Abraham had a great he carried a a weight on him he went with his father he went with his nephew and God could never fully bless Abraham until his dad died and he separate from Lord so what I'm trying to say is that God is going to is willing to bless us but unless we separate ourselves from every unbelief anything that you know that will hinder you from the presence of God you have to cast it out we're living an Haze that all these gadgets it takes all our time they know the things you like he opened it that gives you this give you this you have to be able to balance it and you have to search anything that is going to um going to hinder your work with God you have to cast it off you got to cut it off no wonder Abraham said that we are not Canadians we are not Americans we are not Africans we are Christians because he knew there is going to be a time people are going to be attached to their culture they are going to be attached by the way they do things so you want us to forget all about that and follow him because he's calling you and you alone God wants you and you alone so you've got to separate yourself from everyone belief anything that is contrary to God's word separate yourself from it and Abraham was called by the grace of God but when he went to that place that God told him to be and open that voice of obey that voice of God God told him to stay there don't move but Abraham tested God's patience by moving to Egypt and when he went what happened he lied and said his wife is his sister and that man that Pharaoh was gonna take Sarah to wife Abraham repented and God's grace took over the grace of God took over why God has promised that his seed will come true Sarah so God has to situate that he protect that seed so that nothing can disturb that seed so is you and me because we are children of God he said that I love you even before you came to know who you are so in the time of our ignorance he went and he lovers even before we recognize who we are so many of us the prophet of God gave an example how he went through that even hold an electric post to die that God not let him die because God was protecting his seat our pastor gave an example that he was following a kite and God protected him at that time so many of us tonight you can go through our lives and realize that it was the grace of God that kept us from so many circumstances someone said wasn't supposed to have been dead long time by the grace of God came in at the right time to prevent any catastrophe from happening to you I can go to my own life at the age of 12 Years I went to watch a soccer game in Africa Ghana and whilst watching the game something came on me told my friend I got to go home and they said Oh I said no I got to go so I began to leave whilst I was living there was a commotion because when church has a soldier in Army went to a church and then he went to make a commercial over there and the church people killed him so in Africa if you touch one soldier you touch all of them so the Army got loose and they came to the stadium where we were watching them the game and began to beat everybody killing the people everything they will do so I have to run at the age of 12 from like maybe saying from like are here to like Mississauga and whilst running for my life and right now they couldn't even take a car anyway I saw a van coming and then I I jumped at the back so whilst on the back of the of the truck I don't know how to explain business like um like a steps that goes on the back of those vans it's a big van so I jump on it and whilst on it I fell down the grace of God that came because the next guy could have just ride over me and destroy me but God was protecting me that same God has protected you all the while since you're a child so don't ever give up God that has brought to this will ever take you the end of the road never give up he's the same yesterday today and forever the grace that brought me through that same Grace is going to see us through the grace of God is Not By rest of righteousness that grace Amazing Grace will lead us through amen hallelujah and when you come to the children of Israel God in determining chapter 7 verse 7. God gave them a commandment if you follow me I'll do this I'll do that I'll do that and they never follow God's Commandments it's just like you get married to a wife and that wife promise you she'll do this you do that you wash your clothes you do all those things which is part of them and it's part of it and that man will work hard until his friends to take care of that woman but if the woman begins to be lazy she doesn't listen to you doesn't do anything for you it takes the grace of God keep that marriage and he took the grace of God to keep with the children of Israel because he gave their way they didn't have food he gave their manner they complained later he do everything to them they complain and that complained God so much that it even made Moses angry and made Moses make a wrong decision by his tracking the rock instead of us speaking to it and God could have struck Moses dead but by the grace of God he didn't strike him dead all of us who have been dead by the grace of God grace came in and saved Moses that's why we saw him back in the advanced transgression with Elijah because God took care of him he said you see okay you seek you see it with your eyes by you'll physically go there but all came to be a type because God everything works together for good to them love God says Sovereign God it ended up working for him now you can have the type of God finishing with Moses and Joshua who type the Holy Ghost taking the church to their Promised Land so he stays the grace of God and God is the same yesterday today and forever amen so God take care of business Hallelujah and the next person I'll talk about is David and King David was man after God's Own Heart and urea urea if I pronounce the best husband was a proselyte um when you say a prosely light a Pros like yes sir plus a Prost light and it was hitty tight so they were not fully Jews but who came to convert it to be Judaism because they saw what God has done through David so it is his people you know when David had that desire to drink that water it was Europe people that put their life at rest and fought through the enemy's camp to bring water for David to drink so is you and me we have to take the thought of the work the sword of the word which is the word of God and Cast Away through everyone believe and trust God because perhaps some preached a summary about that as salt don't polish the salt and let it look so shiny and everything you got to take the sword and cut everyone belief out let that Soul put it to work because those people just the desire of David they took that sword and cut their way through they put their life at race for him and King David made a mistake he saw Bathsheba and he did what he was not supposed to do and had a baby with her so he planned and let um the name is one of his captains to make sure that Uriel go onto the wall and died so after he died he was happy and married that woman but one thing that David forgot that God knows everything that is going on and even tonight whatever you thinking whatever is going through your heart God knows it you can't hide from his presence nothing can be hidden he said everything that will be hidden was going to make known so you better set your heart make sure everything is right so that God sent Nathan to go and speak to David but one thing that I could I could catch from it was that Nathan could have gone and said hey David you took somebody's swipe blah blah blah blah he didn't go that God gave him wisdom so sometimes when God reveals something to you about a situation about somebody the way to go about it you have to know when to go about it and how to go about it to speak it to laugh when you correct with love and bring results because remember is a Grace you could have been in that situation by the grace of God delivered you from that so God gave the the the prophet the wisdom to speak because a word spoken in due season how correct that is it has to be spoken in due season at the right time so when David was exposed and he told him that there's somebody in your kingdom that has only one land he cherished the lamb he sleep with the lamb the lamb is is everything and I reached my heart like 99 more lands more ships but this rich man left all the sheep and went and took this man's only man and right away David pronounced judgment In My Kingdom I'll make sure this man life I kill him he's dead for doing that by grace took over grace of God came from the prophet Nathan he said David you shall not die but sword will never leave from your heart your home in grace that took over it's not grace of God David have pronounced his own judgment by God's grace greater than his sin it took over Jacob David's judgment and gave him Grace so he said Grace that gonna take us through so the one thing is when you receive correction how do you react that's why God said David is a man after my own heart because after he went through that um after David went through when Dayton spoke that to him after that he wrote Psalm 51. that's why you wrote something and repented of his things and ask God to give me a clean heart and renew the right Spirit within him all those songs came after he did that so the question is how do you react when You Face correction are you those that get angry like King Uzziah in that altar doing what he was not supposed to do and the prophet Isaiah told him now that the high priest told him King you can't do that you are so angry that God strike him with leprosy so what I'm saying tonight how do you react with correction one brother was telling me that him was a brother or sister say anything to him you never argue he just leave it and accept and thank the person for it this is no time to prove who is right and who is wrong if you are wrong you are wrong make things right move on with your life no need to try to prove I'm right I'm this Mr right there's no such as Mr Right as a true Christian you don't even have rights so it's time we have to accept Corrections because it will it drives closer to him and Corrections will always help us I couldn't print anything but I'm just gonna read this here in a message of Grace paragraph 130. it says Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign one Sovereign Grace from a sovereign one sovereign what can he do Sovereign can do whatever it wants to do listen just now so vereign Grace can only be only be given by one that is sovereign and God is sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody they don't have to if that's what it wants to isn't that wonderful it don't have to ask can I do this or shall I do this can I massage will I doesn't do it it does itself Grace is Sovereign therefore you can save the violence he can save the words he can save the impurities the dying teeth the dying thief on the cross just last minute somebody that never thought about God in his life but when you say remember me Grace came to him and he has salvation nobody can tell God what to do is that Sovereign God he does what is right shall not the just of the earth do right he is a Potter we are the clay we only have to ask them to share personal models after his own will not your will but my thy will be done he is higher than you said my prayers are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts whatever God does is right we have to love him regardless when you say yes or no to our prayer we still have to thank him because he knows the best he knows why you are in that situation he knows why those things are happening our God is awesome God whatever God does is perfect so no body has a right he said that Isaac and Esau and Jacob before they were even born he said I love Jacob I hate Islam who are you to tell what God has to do he is God he knows better so we all have to do is just humble ourselves and let him have his way in our way and things will be what better for us because one thing is if we are truly a child of God or a son of God listen whatever God has promised to come through your life you cannot stop it even your unbelief cannot stop it the king that no the John the Baptist that Zechariah this is a career to all whatever he doubted the Angel's way he had the example even the high priest he doubted it but still it didn't prevent God from letting John the Baptist come through him he suffered for a while by being disobedient but that promise came through himself by Mary an 18 year old girl she said be unto me according to you Thy Word and it happened so we have the Mary's belief and before Mary could even say that the importance of reading your Bible and praying every day is very very important that's the best thing you need to read your Bible you need to pray you're listening you need to listen to the tips when you do those things forms like a fire around you because then my word is fire it's consuming fire the pillar of fire God's word is truth he said it takes everything it protests does everything for you Mary Brown said that before he met that she met that angel that angel met her him her and Joseph was talking about Isaiah 96 so she was thinking on those words the angel appeared unto him on the way to emails those disciples were thinking on the word of God the Bible as a man thinketh in his heart so is he you become what you eat that's why you have to watch what we're listening because there are so many distractions now there are so many things that you can feed your soul that do not help you so you have to be able to and what do you call it you have to be able to have that discernment and see to what will help you and what would I help you those that will not help you got to cut it off because if you don't cut it off you're a Son of God a daughter of God but you don't have the joy of your salvation that's why there is a result unto me the joy of thy salvation you and I'll be always happy and enjoying God's blessings you have to set your heart and cut things that will distract you from the presence of God there are so many of them here but you have to press your way through you have to fight if you might reign it's a battle it's not that easy but God promised he will lead us through and he said that even if your heart condemns you God is greater than your heart looked out upon yourself let God have his own way through you and all things possible to Doom to them that love God Amen to those that believe if thou can't believe all things so let's cast out anything like Christ and serving because he will never leave us nor forsake us listen there has to be a balance because some people have taken Grace and making disgrace is that right we don't want that he said if you love me you obey my Commandments the love of God will let you obey those after you have become a Christian and God is in your heart then you do those things that works to appreciate what God has done for you because you are not doing that to us say that you are doing that to buy your way to heaven you can't buy Grace you can't buy those things from God God give to those he wished you cannot buy Grace from God you cannot tell God what to do but all that you can do is do your part and love God as Brian Brown said that even if he sent me to Hell he's still right but he said also that he knew the love he has for God and how God will have him he know there's no way he's going to send him to her but even if he chose to he's still right so let's just love God respect the elders respect our pastor whatever after a pastor retire whoever gonna take position let us support and respect the man regardless of what you have seen him in the past forget about all those things your eyes could see and just support the man with your prayers and with your heart and God will bless you too amen it's time to respect as you will respect God's Anointed God also bless you no one that David said that I I cannot touch God's anointed do my preface no harm and touch not my anointing my anointed was you all have gone through I remember one time I was working in a place the first time I did a job for standby it was the house was like 24 000 square feet in Bayview over there and the Builder that gave me the job took five percent from me and the taper was giving those helping me a lot of help didn't want them to work messing up everything and I was talking to him something said that nowhere come from against you will prosper that standing spoke in my heart then The Nest I heard the man fired the taper the guy that took me over there that took the money from me that my fire he lost like 150 000 at that time and I that he was tormented um giving trouble to my guys I have to go back and fix his mistakes for him so people has to watch what you say even your closet and what you think about God's anointed because you will receive your reward he said if you accept the prayer for you respect the prophet you get the prophet reward you respect him you get the reward too so it's very important that we watch what we thinking and what we are saying so um I'm just gonna end it over here and just say that the grace of God that has brought us through that same Grace will lead us home but Antonio please come His Amazing Grace Grace is greater than all my sins of this brand too [Music] amazing I know the love [Music]
