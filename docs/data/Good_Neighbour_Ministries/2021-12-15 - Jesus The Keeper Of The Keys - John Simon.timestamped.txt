[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good evening friends it's wonderful to
[0:17] be together once again
[0:20] as the people of god
[0:22] gathered together
[0:24] around his throne
[0:26] of his word
[0:28] here we are on this wonderful wednesday
[0:32] evening
[0:33] and may the lord jesus christ bless you
[0:37] richly and wonderfully praise god
[0:42] hallelujah our topic
[0:46] is
[0:47] jesus
[0:49] the keeper of the keys
[0:52] i repeat
[0:53] our subject
[0:56] for tonight is jesus
[0:59] the keeper of the keys
[1:02] and our scripture is found in
[1:04] revelation chapter 3
[1:07] verse 7.
[1:10] and to the angel of the church in
[1:14] philadelphia
[1:16] right
[1:17] these things said he that is holy
[1:21] he that is true
[1:24] he
[1:25] that had the key of david
[1:29] he that opened it and no man shut it
[1:33] and shut it
[1:36] and no man
[1:38] open it thanks be to god let us pray
[1:44] our gracious loving
[1:47] heavenly father
[1:50] with joy we come into your presence
[1:54] boldly before the throne of grace
[1:58] thank you lord
[2:00] for including us in your great purpose
[2:03] and plan
[2:05] and here we are in this day
[2:09] speaking the word of god back to you
[2:13] as you have taught your little children
[2:16] take glory and take honor for we are
[2:20] dying and thine alone
[2:22] in jesus name
[2:24] amen
[2:25] and amen
[2:29] now
[2:30] for this topic of jesus
[2:34] the keeper of the keys
[2:37] i would like to for you to focus your
[2:40] thoughts
[2:42] upon the the
[2:45] fact
[2:46] of the importance
[2:48] of revelation
[2:50] as found
[2:52] in pages
[2:53] 13
[2:54] to 17
[2:56] of the church age book
[2:59] now
[3:00] the importance of revelation
[3:04] to the true believer
[3:06] should never be
[3:08] underestimated
[3:11] or it can never be over emphasized
[3:16] because revelation means to us
[3:20] more
[3:21] than many of us
[3:23] realize
[3:25] and we are not talking about the book of
[3:28] revelation
[3:30] we're talking about all revelation
[3:35] now jesus
[3:37] did say
[3:39] that he would build his church
[3:42] up on
[3:44] revelation some say god built his church
[3:48] on a rock
[3:51] some say
[3:53] he built his church
[3:55] on
[3:57] you know jesus
[3:59] jesus himself
[4:02] but the bible says
[4:05] let me give you the words of the bible
[4:07] itself
[4:09] when peter answered him
[4:11] and said
[4:14] flesh jesus said
[4:16] flesh
[4:17] and blood
[4:19] had not revealed it
[4:22] but my father
[4:25] had
[4:26] revealed it
[4:28] and upon this rock what rock the rock of
[4:33] revelation
[4:35] i will build my church
[4:38] and the gates of hell
[4:41] shall not prevail against against it
[4:44] because
[4:45] of revelation
[4:48] oh praise god so the church's true
[4:52] foundation
[4:54] is revelation
[4:56] is thus saith the lord
[5:00] now i want to ask you a question from
[5:02] the book of genesis showing the
[5:04] importance of revelation the flow
[5:07] and continuity of revelation
[5:10] from eternity back to eternity
[5:14] here we find abel
[5:18] in the
[5:19] uh
[5:20] beginning of the world
[5:23] off in hebrews
[5:26] 11
[5:27] by faith
[5:29] a bell by faith
[5:32] faith is what faith is a revelation
[5:36] so then
[5:37] let us say this way
[5:39] by
[5:40] revelation
[5:42] abell offered a better sacrifice
[5:46] notice carefully
[5:49] by
[5:50] faith
[5:52] by revelation
[5:54] he was shown
[5:56] or told
[5:58] how
[5:59] to offer his sacrifice
[6:02] and what sacrifice
[6:05] it was
[6:07] that he had to offer
[6:09] hallelujah
[6:11] he did it by revelation
[6:14] uh
[6:14] cain offered up
[6:16] a sacrifice also but he did that by
[6:20] commandment
[6:22] not by
[6:24] god opening his
[6:27] his mind his soul to revelation from the
[6:31] word
[6:33] so he could not offer the right
[6:35] sacrifice
[6:37] he was doing it
[6:40] by commandment
[6:43] he was spiritually blind
[6:46] to the real things of god even though he
[6:50] was religious
[6:53] and ready to offer a sacrifice also
[6:57] oh praise god
[7:00] but it was revelation
[7:03] that made the difference
[7:06] between the two young men
[7:08] at that particular time
[7:11] twins then twins now
[7:14] revelation then
[7:16] revelation now
[7:19] just reading
[7:20] the bible theologizing studying
[7:23] analyzing debating doing these various
[7:27] things with the bible it's wonderful
[7:30] that's all by commandment
[7:34] oh praise god one may say oh i'm obeying
[7:38] the word
[7:40] yes
[7:40] that is obedience to the word indeed but
[7:45] not by revelation for by
[7:48] faith
[7:49] by revelation
[7:52] abel offered a better sacrifice
[7:56] now let me give you some insight into
[7:59] what i am
[8:00] uh trying to say if you have the
[8:03] facilities to be able to catch it absorb
[8:07] it and go out and live it
[8:10] remember in the days of a ballon cane
[8:14] there was no not yet any written bible
[8:19] there was no written scriptures
[8:22] so how did a bell no
[8:27] in contrast to his brother how did he
[8:30] know what to offer
[8:32] and i've said this before uh did he
[8:35] stand there wondering if he was to offer
[8:37] a fish or or or
[8:40] a bird or or or some fruits on the altar
[8:44] or something else no
[8:47] he did not have to wander
[8:50] abel was certain of god
[8:53] for he had received a revelation which
[8:56] only will come from god and only could
[9:00] be given by grace
[9:03] amen
[9:04] and god making known to him
[9:08] amen to offer up a lamb
[9:12] and the shed blood
[9:14] would be a type a shadow but he was to
[9:17] offer that meaning
[9:20] revealing to him the entire story of
[9:23] what actually happened before he was
[9:26] even born again born or on the scene
[9:30] amen praise god of course a true son the
[9:33] same thing will take place to him god
[9:36] revealing to him or her what happened
[9:38] from way before the foundation of the
[9:40] world until this time revealing it right
[9:43] through the word so they're not
[9:46] worshiping serving and living for god by
[9:51] guests by by commandment but by faith by
[9:55] revelation out of the mouth of god
[9:59] revealed to his servants praise god amen
[10:03] hallelujah
[10:04] amen amen so revelation is the true
[10:08] foundation
[10:11] of the church and in particular the
[10:14] revelation of who jesus christ really is
[10:19] that he is god
[10:21] he is very god
[10:23] and god
[10:25] manifested in the flesh as we say
[10:29] emmanuel
[10:31] god with us
[10:33] the god who was above us
[10:36] came down from his glory
[10:40] put on a tent of human flesh
[10:43] that he might walk with us talk with us
[10:46] oh that he could be tried tempted and
[10:50] and be touched by the feelings of our
[10:54] infirmities
[10:55] to recognize and know what it
[10:59] is to be a human
[11:02] and to uh have a a taste of these things
[11:06] for this he learned or obedience that he
[11:09] might know amen praise god hallelujah
[11:14] yes sir oh
[11:16] we are here my friends
[11:18] not to just be a christian by taking
[11:21] what the pastor says or even what i say
[11:25] even though it may be a blessing to you
[11:28] to try to bring you to the fullness of
[11:32] revelation amen
[11:34] praise god this is not by eloquence
[11:38] this is not my logic
[11:41] this is none of the religious things
[11:44] that we receive in schools
[11:47] but thank god
[11:49] i tell you my friends
[11:51] god has to reveal it to you by grace
[11:55] amen
[11:56] god has to turn on the light
[12:00] god is the one who has to open
[12:03] the eyes of your heart
[12:05] that you might see the word
[12:09] that it is jesus christ
[12:11] that is his blood his spirit
[12:16] that washes and cleanses you
[12:19] and reveals to you
[12:21] hallelujah
[12:23] that you might recognize
[12:25] that god is your savior
[12:28] that salvation
[12:29] is of the lord
[12:32] amen
[12:33] only spiritual revelation
[12:36] will do that for you
[12:40] for revelation
[12:42] is the key
[12:45] it is the master's key
[12:48] by which we are given supernatural
[12:53] understanding
[12:55] of the scriptures
[12:57] which their world
[12:59] cannot withstand
[13:01] for it's the wisdom of god flowing
[13:04] through men and women of this hour
[13:08] anointed by the holy spirit
[13:12] here we stand
[13:14] and here we believe
[13:16] that once again
[13:18] the holy spirit has returned to man
[13:22] anointing
[13:24] men and women
[13:26] that
[13:27] are given
[13:29] this
[13:30] facile faculty
[13:32] uh
[13:33] and this ability of reception
[13:36] of the gods broadcast of revelation
[13:40] through the voice
[13:41] of this prophet that was set upon the
[13:44] face of the earth
[13:46] by which we
[13:48] can enter in
[13:50] to another dimension through revelation
[13:53] of the holy spirit
[13:55] this master key
[13:57] is given
[13:59] that we might open up god's treasure
[14:02] house
[14:03] of his word
[14:05] of all the precious things
[14:08] hidden things
[14:10] the secret things of god
[14:13] are made known
[14:14] hallelujah and i want you to know
[14:18] that jesus christ himself is the keeper
[14:22] of the keys
[14:25] to god's treasure house
[14:27] of
[14:28] revelation as the old song says
[14:33] no
[14:34] only to him
[14:36] are the great hidden secrets known only
[14:41] to him
[14:43] are the great hidden secrets
[14:46] oh praise be to god
[14:49] hallelujah and that is why satan
[14:53] hates these two books
[14:55] of
[14:56] genesis and of revelation
[15:00] because it shows his beginning and his
[15:03] end
[15:04] that he is not god but a creation of god
[15:08] and as a creation he has a beginning
[15:10] and will have an end
[15:13] my friends
[15:15] i thank god that as we study this
[15:19] church age of philadelphia
[15:23] we can
[15:25] accept the reality
[15:28] of jesus christ
[15:30] that is why in our last talk we spoke
[15:33] about
[15:34] perfect realization
[15:37] showing that all the type shadows
[15:40] coming to their fulfillment
[15:42] magnification and reality in jesus
[15:45] christ
[15:47] jesus christ lived displayed and
[15:50] manifested to us
[15:52] these marvelous wonderful hidden truths
[15:56] and secrets
[15:58] of the word of god
[16:02] even my friends as we look
[16:05] we find this beautiful phrase
[16:09] he that hat the key
[16:11] of david
[16:13] hallelujah
[16:15] and it comes out or flows
[16:18] from the
[16:19] preceding phrase he
[16:22] that is true
[16:25] jesus christ
[16:27] the per the perfect realization
[16:32] contrasted with partial
[16:35] realization
[16:37] or recognition
[16:40] hallelujah
[16:42] partial and a partially f epiphany
[16:46] uh in contrast to
[16:48] uh you know a partial uh a complete
[16:52] epiphany a perfect epiphany
[16:55] in contrast to a partial epiphany ah a
[16:59] moment when you come to yourself a
[17:02] moment when you wake up a moment when
[17:05] you are struck by the light of god or
[17:08] lightning of god
[17:10] and you recognize what god has been
[17:13] trying to say to you
[17:15] all through the years
[17:18] jesus
[17:21] is the perfect fulfillment of all
[17:24] prophecy
[17:26] jesus christ
[17:28] is the perfect fulfillment or the
[17:31] reality
[17:33] of all the types
[17:35] all of the shadows
[17:39] and the perfection of all realities
[17:42] thanks be to god
[17:45] now moses was a prophet of god
[17:48] but when jesus christ came on the scene
[17:52] he was god come to be his own prophet
[17:56] and to speak his own word and say moses
[18:00] said but i say unto thee for it was the
[18:04] great i am
[18:06] speaking true
[18:08] a
[18:09] veil of flesh named jesus christ and
[18:12] saying i
[18:14] am that i am
[18:16] hallelujah
[18:18] praise god
[18:20] it's clear in the word of god
[18:24] oh
[18:25] that my friends david
[18:29] being king of israel
[18:31] but jesus
[18:33] is the greater
[18:34] king of israel
[18:37] david was just foreshadowing
[18:39] christ
[18:41] hallelujah
[18:42] amen
[18:43] david was casting a shadow on the wall
[18:47] of time
[18:48] so
[18:49] for folks everyone to know
[18:52] that a real king
[18:54] the real king is coming
[18:57] and i'm only a partial reflection of the
[19:00] coming of that king and we know him to
[19:04] be jesus christ king of kings and lord
[19:08] of lords hallelujah
[19:10] amen praise god listen what the
[19:14] scripture says in isaiah chapter
[19:17] 22 verse 22
[19:20] and the key of the house of david will i
[19:24] lay upon his shoulder
[19:27] so he shall open
[19:30] and none shall shut
[19:33] and he shall shut
[19:36] and none
[19:38] shall open
[19:40] praise god
[19:41] the spirit of god is using this old
[19:44] testament
[19:46] scripture and prophecy
[19:48] and referring and pointing directly to
[19:52] jesus christ
[19:53] himself who stands in the midst of his
[19:57] of the lamp stands type of the church
[20:00] ages
[20:01] and showing that rep the this this
[20:04] revelation he is the keeper of the keys
[20:08] and he will reveal or open the heart
[20:11] eyes of the heart of those who he will
[20:14] and shut the eyes of those to whom he
[20:18] also will amen praise god
[20:22] now we know jesus standing in the midst
[20:26] of the lampstand
[20:27] this has to do with jesus christ
[20:31] after his resurrection
[20:33] i spoke on this last sunday
[20:36] talking about knowing jesus
[20:39] in the flesh before the resurrection
[20:42] that's just knowing the written word
[20:45] that's just knowing the bible but when
[20:48] that word was crucified buried and rose
[20:52] again
[20:53] and then met him then
[20:57] explained he to them
[20:59] the scriptures from moses right on down
[21:02] to himself
[21:05] and the bible records then were their
[21:08] eyes opened
[21:10] that they might
[21:12] no really know who he was may the lord
[21:15] help us may the lord bless every one of
[21:18] us may that god open the eyes of our
[21:21] understanding to recognize that he is
[21:25] the keeper of the keys there is no bible
[21:28] teacher
[21:30] there is no human element
[21:33] not by the will of man
[21:35] the word of man
[21:37] only by the grace will purpose and
[21:40] election of the living god can the eyes
[21:43] of the heart be really opened all thanks
[21:47] be to god
[21:49] yes
[21:50] he is the one
[21:52] who opens the door of revelation
[21:56] he opens the door of opportunity to
[21:59] salvation
[22:00] as he did
[22:02] with noah in the ark
[22:05] yes
[22:06] he holds the keys
[22:08] of death hell and the grave he is the
[22:12] eternal warden
[22:14] of the great temple of god
[22:17] where god he holds the responsibility
[22:21] of opening and shutting praise god he
[22:26] shuts up my friends
[22:29] and he opens up
[22:32] he shuts
[22:33] the door
[22:34] of time
[22:36] and opens the door of eternity
[22:39] to those
[22:41] who he wants to enter when it is their
[22:44] time
[22:45] for them to enter
[22:48] hallelujah
[22:49] not to know him
[22:52] while he was in his earthly pilgrimage
[22:55] of his flesh
[22:57] but to know him
[22:59] in his glorified
[23:01] resurrected
[23:03] body of truth
[23:05] made manifest in this hour by the spirit
[23:09] of the living god
[23:10] hallelujah
[23:12] oh glory to his marvelous and wonderful
[23:16] name
[23:17] now what does the key signify
[23:22] this key
[23:24] as you see in the scripture
[23:27] it's the position of the key that speaks
[23:30] to us
[23:31] and gives us insights
[23:33] into the word of god
[23:36] for this this key
[23:38] it is not
[23:40] found in his hand
[23:42] it is not worn around his neck
[23:47] neither
[23:48] does he give the keys
[23:50] to anyone else
[23:53] is not placed in the hands of any man
[23:57] or praise god hallelujah
[24:00] amen he was giving peter revelation at
[24:04] that time
[24:06] but my friends it was not a natural
[24:09] ordinary key that can be handed down or
[24:12] passed down
[24:15] for up the gifts and things of god are
[24:19] not by spiritual inheritance or
[24:21] succession
[24:23] but by revelation through the holy
[24:25] spirit
[24:27] amen so he never placed the it in the
[24:30] hands of other men
[24:33] he alone uses that key
[24:37] for he alone opens
[24:40] and he alone shuts
[24:42] and the bible makes it clear
[24:44] for no man
[24:48] can open or shut but he alone
[24:51] and no man has the right
[24:53] to say he can open and shut
[24:57] for only jesus christ alone
[25:01] can do that
[25:02] now where is this key
[25:04] the bible tells us it is on his shoulder
[25:08] what does his shoulder speak of rev
[25:11] isaiah chapter 9 verse 6
[25:15] and the government shall be upon his
[25:17] shoulder now what does that mean
[25:20] the answer speaks to us out of the
[25:24] jewish
[25:25] tradition and practice of their the
[25:28] wedding ceremony of the east
[25:32] now when
[25:34] a bride has committed
[25:36] herself to a groom
[25:39] then
[25:40] she takes off
[25:42] the veil that she had upon her face
[25:47] and places the veil on the groom's
[25:51] shoulder
[25:53] and that is significance
[25:57] but she is signifying by that
[26:00] that she willingly accepts him
[26:04] as her
[26:05] head
[26:06] her master
[26:07] her leader her guide
[26:10] her provider her all in all
[26:14] and she now surrender herself
[26:17] to his dominion
[26:20] she has transferred her rights
[26:23] to him
[26:25] and that he now bears responsibility
[26:28] protection and care
[26:31] for her
[26:33] and she looks to him and him alone
[26:36] no other man no one else
[26:39] no other power in in the heavens or in
[26:42] the earth
[26:45] has any right or any responsibility
[26:48] of making any such claims
[26:50] for she has committed herself to jesus
[26:53] christ
[26:54] and jesus christ alone yes beloved
[26:58] only he holds the key of david
[27:02] for god being sovereign
[27:05] already foreign
[27:08] who would be his bride
[27:10] and in his bride
[27:12] hallelujah
[27:14] and
[27:15] he chose her
[27:17] as he said in the book of john you have
[27:19] not chosen me
[27:21] but i have chosen you
[27:24] and ordained you
[27:26] hallelujah before the foundation of the

[27:50] uh you know
[27:52] wonderful uh ability of choice
[27:56] here we are in this age and we are able
[27:59] to choose

[28:05] because her acceptance of her bread room
[28:09] that
[28:10] points to her choice
[28:13] but not her looking
[28:17] at him and choosing him
[28:20] no

[28:58] amen
[29:00] he is the one
[29:02] that redeemed us
[29:04] paid the price
[29:06] for our salvation
[29:09] brought us back out of the devil's old
[29:12] pawn shop
[29:14] and we belong to him
[29:18] and to him
[29:19] alone
[29:21] is our heart committed
[29:24] and that is why
[29:26] we are committed to him
[29:29] and thank god he accepts
[29:32] the obligation
[29:35] and responsibility and of protection
[29:38] provision guidance every supernatural
[29:41] thing in our lives he accepts the
[29:43] obligation and the responsibility for
[29:47] the government
[29:49] is upon
[29:50] his shoulders thanks be to god for he
[29:55] is the head of his church

[30:19] and that is our joy and our delight
[30:23] is to obey the word of the lord
[30:28] hallelujah yes full sovereign authority
[30:33] over his own amen
[30:37] my friends
[30:39] he does not have sovereignty in the
[30:41] modern nominal church
[30:43] no
[30:44] he does not for in every age
[30:48] the church so-called
[30:52] the has
[30:53] allowed itself not to be ruled
[30:57] by the headship
[30:59] and preeminence
[31:02] of the
[31:03] word of god the revealed word of god
[31:08] instead
[31:10] the church has allowed itself to be
[31:13] ruled by hierarchies
[31:17] by priesthoods
[31:20] by
[31:21] various forms of church boards
[31:26] and has allowed herself
[31:29] to be ruled by claims
[31:33] of apostolic succession
[31:37] which are totally on scriptural
[31:40] and not within the boundaries of the
[31:43] word of god
[31:47] these
[31:48] close the door
[31:50] of mercy and grace
[31:52] upon multitudes
[31:56] and keep them from
[31:58] the very hand
[32:00] and will of god
[32:04] instead of assuming
[32:07] love and responsibility
[32:09] of the church
[32:11] of the living god
[32:13] we find
[32:15] these church spirits
[32:18] these
[32:20] spirits of religious devils
[32:24] on the various
[32:26] hierarchies church boards
[32:29] uh priesthoods
[32:31] apostolic successions
[32:33] have become so mercenary
[32:37] and have prayed
[32:39] upon and are praying upon
[32:43] that church of the living god
[32:47] and destroying her
[32:49] in every possible way
[32:52] most and many
[32:53] of the
[32:54] clergy live in luxury
[32:58] while the poor church
[33:01] feeds on the husks
[33:04] of their continuous
[33:06] abuse
[33:07] over and over again
[33:10] you hear you read or you may have
[33:13] experienced
[33:15] the abuse and abuses
[33:18] within
[33:19] the so-called church
[33:23] and not one age
[33:25] has been
[33:26] any different listen to me i'm speaking
[33:29] to you the word of god for this day and
[33:33] for this hour
[33:34] may the holy spirit break through my
[33:37] friends the crusts of unbelief and
[33:40] churchianity so that you might recognize
[33:44] jesus christ making himself known in the
[33:47] present stage of his ministry by the
[33:50] opening of your understanding to the
[33:52] word of god hallelujah amen
[33:56] oh praise god
[33:58] every one of these ages before us
[34:03] and even the present age
[34:06] they bound themselves to an organization
[34:09] or to that organizational spirit
[34:14] yes
[34:16] and
[34:17] committed
[34:18] the church to the government of men
[34:22] and the government
[34:24] of that organization
[34:27] and if any of the people
[34:29] were to see some glimmer of light
[34:32] and to try to raise up
[34:35] and break away from
[34:37] the cage
[34:39] the prisons with stained glass windows
[34:42] to break away from it
[34:45] then
[34:46] they're brutally suppressed
[34:48] or excommunicated
[34:51] cast out
[34:53] oh god have mercy
[34:56] and every single denomination
[35:00] upon the face of the earth has that same
[35:04] kind of spirit upon it
[35:08] every denomination
[35:10] swears
[35:12] that it has the
[35:13] real genuine key to church government
[35:19] everyone claims
[35:22] that they have the key of opening the
[35:25] door
[35:27] but that is not true not at all
[35:31] for it is jesus
[35:33] oh it is jesus
[35:36] it is jesus in my soul oh praise god my
[35:41] friends jesus and jesus alone
[35:45] opens up the eyes
[35:46] of our understanding
[35:49] the eyes of the heart
[35:51] and makes himself known
[35:54] he is the one that sets every member
[35:58] into his body and positions them for his
[36:02] glory
[36:03] he endows an ordains
[36:07] with their various ministries
[36:11] he puts the gifts
[36:13] into the church of the living god
[36:17] oh thank god
[36:19] he cares for his church his bride
[36:22] he leads and guides her
[36:25] and she is his sole
[36:28] property through
[36:31] the price of redemption
[36:33] not by with silver and gold but by the
[36:37] precious blood of jesus christ who was
[36:40] wounded for our transgressions blows for
[36:43] our iniquities amen the chastisement of
[36:47] our peace was upon him and by his
[36:50] stripes we are healed oh thank god
[36:54] he has no other
[36:56] wife no other one but her and her alone
[37:00] thanks be to god amen what a what a far
[37:04] cry
[37:06] from this church age and every other
[37:09] church age
[37:10] hallelujah
[37:12] men now even
[37:13] purport
[37:16] to speak for the church
[37:22] my friends
[37:23] out of that kind
[37:26] of religious lie
[37:28] will arise the economical council
[37:32] and the ecumenical move
[37:35] they're trying to create a ground swell
[37:39] a wave
[37:40] towards an ecumenical move
[37:43] so that they may place a living
[37:46] antichrist
[37:48] at the head
[37:49] of their organization
[37:52] and dispose of the word
[37:56] the lord himself
[37:58] while making lots of religious
[38:00] phraseology
[38:02] and using bits and pieces out of the
[38:05] scriptures
[38:06] they shift the attention
[38:09] away from the lord himself
[38:13] excuse me and begin to place it first
[38:18] on the mother
[38:20] and soon it shifts again and he'll keep
[38:23] moving
[38:24] until
[38:25] the washer will go towards the
[38:28] antichrist
[38:30] himself who will sit on the throne of
[38:32] god claiming that he is of god meanwhile
[38:36] the real christ
[38:38] is put outside of the door
[38:41] as is found in revelation chapter 3
[38:44] verse 20.

[39:47] are drawn by the presence and power of
[39:50] almighty god

[47:16] heart be opened oh hallelujah amen
[47:21] the jews of his day refuse him
[47:25] and all that he was
[47:28] they rejected their own messiah their
[47:31] savior
[47:33] on all that he meant to them
[47:36] and now in our day
[47:38] in the gentile dispensation
[47:41] that is exactly what the nominal church
[47:44] has done to him and the nominal believer
[47:48] has done to him
[47:50] and just as the jews
[47:52] crucified him
[47:54] through their spiritual blindness
[47:59] and then turned on the disciples and
[48:02] apostles at that time
[48:05] that they had to flee
[48:07] so is it happening in our time
[48:10] the nominal church
[48:12] again
[48:14] having a second crucifixion
[48:17] of jesus christ
[48:19] the word
[48:20] crucifying him again
[48:23] from off of their pulpits
[48:25] from off of their high places of worship
[48:28] their high altars
[48:31] blaspheming his name crucifying the word
[48:36] calling him wrong calling this false
[48:40] oh my giving him a name of a quote
[48:43] blackening his name
[48:46] and everything else oh my
[48:50] crucifying him afresh
[48:52] and then turning
[48:54] on the true church
[48:56] of the living god which is in the
[48:58] minority
[49:00] but god is true
[49:04] and god is real
[49:07] and he's above all
[49:09] and he has promised
[49:11] that he would yet return
[49:15] oh my friends
[49:17] and when he does
[49:19] let me say
[49:21] that he
[49:23] is the only true potentate
[49:25] the only great sovereign
[49:28] of our heart and he proves himself and
[49:32] will prove himself to the entire world
[49:37] and make all the world bow at his feet
[49:40] that he is king of kings and
[49:42] lord of lords
[49:44] above all and in you all that truly
[49:48] believe and at that that time
[49:52] the world will come
[49:54] and bow at the feet of his saints
[49:57] proving that they were right
[50:00] in their stand in the position that they
[50:03] took within his body
[50:05] oh my with him blessed be our god
[50:09] forevermore amen for the far for the
[50:13] bride to the bride their rapture
[50:17] is their ultimate vindication
[50:21] of their rightness of the rightness of
[50:25] their belief
[50:27] of their revelation
[50:29] of their faith
[50:31] and their love
[50:33] submission on obedience to the word of
[50:37] god that has been given to them
[50:40] in this day and in this hour by the
[50:43] voice of god for our day and time and we
[50:47] thank the lord jesus that he has done
[50:50] this for us to him be all praise honor
[50:53] and glory
[50:55] and john said i heard a voice like
[50:58] sundering waters in the heavens saying
[51:02] honor glory and power be unto our god
[51:06] the 24 elders cast down their crowns and
[51:10] said amen amen and together they
[51:15] worshipped the lord god in the temple of
[51:19] heaven they were allowed to worship him
[51:22] for jesus christ himself is the keeper
[51:26] of the keys and thank god the keys have
[51:30] turned in the lock
[51:33] and the lock has opened up
[51:36] in the doorways of the dimensions
[51:39] of the glory and presence of god
