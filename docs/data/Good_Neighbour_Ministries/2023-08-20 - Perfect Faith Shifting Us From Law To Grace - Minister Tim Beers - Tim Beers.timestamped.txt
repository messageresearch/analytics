[39:23] word this morning
[39:25] Hallelujah Romans 4 13
[39:30] and Jeremiah 31 31. I hope that I can
[39:35] maybe lay a foundation this morning
[39:39] and we're going to continue because
[39:40] there's so much in this but if you want
[39:43] to really enrich yourself those who are
[39:45] really seeking for God
[39:47] and to know him in a greater way the
[39:49] book of Romans the book of Ephesians
[39:53] the message of Grace
[39:56] brother Branham
[39:58] and perfect Faith you get into those
[40:00] amen that's what I've been feeding on
[40:03] for this message this morning
[40:06] Hallelujah
[40:09] thank you Lord let us pray father
[40:14] one day you were on the cross and you
[40:16] said
[40:18] into thy hands I commit my spirit
[40:21] father
[40:23] into thy hands we commit ourselves this
[40:25] morning Lord
[40:27] as speaker and as hero Lord
[40:30] you said if I be lifted up
[40:33] I draw all men unto myself
[40:36] father we don't want man to be lifted
[40:39] this morning well but we we want men out
[40:41] of the way
[40:43] both speaker and here are out of the way
[40:45] this morning
[40:46] because we have our own opinions we have
[40:48] our own thoughts Lord
[40:50] my Lord
[40:52] your mind
[40:55] is greater than that father and that's
[40:57] what we want this morning
[40:59] there's an obstacle Lord which is our
[41:02] flesh and this carnal mind that is in
[41:04] the way that battles in and is that
[41:06] enmity with you and it fights us every
[41:08] day father and it's here this morning
[41:11] it's it's the tool that Satan uses to
[41:14] try to distract us from hearing your
[41:17] voice
[41:18] but Lord by your grace this morning
[41:20] father we ask Lord that you give us the
[41:24] grace Lord that we may walk out of here
[41:27] and be like those that were on the road
[41:29] to Emmaus then our hearts
[41:32] burn
[41:34] along the way as he spoke to us
[41:37] and he broke the bread break bread this
[41:40] morning Lord
[41:41] break bread to your children father
[41:45] we invite you Lord Jesus
[41:48] I can't do nothing without you
[41:50] but I stand Here by faith believing that
[41:53] you will come and do it Lord
[41:56] Grant these things Lord bless each and
[41:59] every one
[42:00] we bless your holy name in Jesus name
[42:05] Romans 4 13 4 The Promise
[42:09] that he should be Heirs of the world was
[42:13] not to Abraham or to his seed through
[42:16] the law
[42:17] but through the righteousness of faith
[42:21] for if they which are of the law be
[42:25] heirs faith is made void
[42:29] and the promise made of none effect
[42:33] because the law worketh Wrath for where
[42:37] no law is there is no transgression
[42:41] therefore it is a faith
[42:44] that it might be by grace to the end the
[42:48] promise might be sure to all the seed
[42:52] not to that only which is of the law
[42:55] but to that also which is of the faith
[42:59] of Abraham who is the father of us all
[43:04] Jeremiah 31 31.
[43:08] now the Lord here
[43:10] is speaking because he knows
[43:14] he's looking ahead in the future and he
[43:16] knows that nobody can keep the law
[43:22] so he's speaking here in Jeremiah
[43:26] 31 31 behold the days come saith the
[43:31] Lord that I will make a new covenant
[43:34] with the house of Israel
[43:36] and with the house of Judah
[43:39] not according to the Covenant that I
[43:42] made with their fathers in the day that
[43:44] I took them by the hand to bring them
[43:47] out of the land of Egypt
[43:50] which my Covenant they break although I
[43:54] was a a husband unto them saith the Lord
[43:58] but this shall be the Covenant that I
[44:02] will make with the house of Israel after
[44:05] those days saith the Lord I will put my
[44:08] law in their inward parts
[44:13] and write it in their hearts and I will
[44:17] be their God and they shall be my people
[44:20] and they shall
[44:23] teach no more every man his neighbor and
[44:27] every man his brother saying know the
[44:29] Lord
[44:30] for they shall all know me from the
[44:34] least to the greatest of them saith the
[44:37] Lord for I will forgive their iniquities
[44:41] and remember their sins no more
[44:44] God bless you as you seated
[44:46] you see
[44:48] many many things here
[44:52] the scriptures are saying
[44:56] for all will know me
[45:00] and no man is going to have to say you
[45:03] know know the Lord
[45:05] because he will come and put the laws in
[45:08] their hearts
[45:10] and write them in their hearts and their
[45:12] minds
[45:13] for all will know the Lord
[45:15] by the by the spirit of Revelation in
[45:19] this hour
[45:21] Hallelujah
[45:23] I broke my other glasses and I got these
[45:25] glasses and I realized they're falling
[45:28] off my face so if they fall off
[45:31] just give me Grace this morning
[45:34] Hallelujah Paul labels life before his
[45:38] conversion as life under the law and we
[45:41] know Paul was a Pharisee of the
[45:44] Pharisees
[45:45] amen no man it was taught
[45:49] or highly educated and knew the law like
[45:52] Paul knew it
[45:55] and after the life of his conversion
[45:59] he called his life under grace
[46:03] so before his conversion
[46:05] it was law after his conversion it is
[46:09] Grace and that is the way it is today
[46:11] before the New Birth it's law
[46:14] after the New Birth it's Grace
[46:18] Hallelujah
[46:21] what was The Blessing of Abraham
[46:24] so the blessing That Came Upon Abraham
[46:27] and Genesis 12 1-3 was the blood
[46:31] covering over his sins which came upon
[46:34] him because of his faith
[46:37] and hope in the sacrifice of the Messiah
[46:40] to come
[46:41] that's why when God said offer up your
[46:44] son Isaac
[46:46] and and Abraham when his son asked him
[46:49] where's the sacrifice and Abraham said
[46:52] God will provide himself a sacrifice
[46:56] because Abraham was the father of faith
[46:59] of Revelation he seemed to come in
[47:02] Messiah
[47:03] Hallelujah he's seen the grace of God
[47:06] coming amen do we see God's grace in our
[47:10] lives do we see his grace Amen in our
[47:13] lives and come into us
[47:16] oh I see nothing but Grace amen I don't
[47:20] see law this morning amen I see nothing
[47:23] but the grace of God if it wasn't for
[47:26] the grace the grace of God in my life
[47:28] where would I be this morning where
[47:30] would you be this morning you're sitting
[47:33] here this morning by his grace and his
[47:36] grace alone
[47:38] Oh Glory to God Amen
[47:41] Hallelujah
[47:44] amen and once that covering was there
[47:47] God could bless and multiply increase
[47:50] him in so many ways until he became
[47:53] quite wealthy
[47:55] but Abraham did not receive the promise
[47:58] through the law he received it because
[48:01] he was right with God through his faith
[48:05] amen
[48:07] glory to God he became quite wealthy
[48:10] doesn't the scripture say Seek first the
[48:13] kingdom of God that's the key
[48:16] that's the grace of God in our lives
[48:18] that we in our lives can seek his
[48:21] kingdom his righteousness for our lives
[48:24] his will for our lives first
[48:27] that's what faith leads us
[48:30] he wasn't worried about money
[48:32] he wasn't worried about prospering amen
[48:35] he was worried amen he was seeking God
[48:39] and the kingdom of God first
[48:43] don't you understand when you find him
[48:46] and you seek him and you hunger for him
[48:49] you attract everything else
[48:52] that's his scripture
[48:54] we worry so much
[48:57] Hallelujah we worry so much about the
[49:01] material things about this of this life
[49:03] we look at the world today we see what's
[49:06] going on and we worry about tomorrow
[49:10] he said don't worry about tomorrow don't
[49:13] worry about what you'll eat you'll drink
[49:16] oh my
[49:18] seek my face
[49:20] Hallelujah
[49:22] if God will feed the birds simple things
[49:25] Jesus said God will feed the birds
[49:28] God will allow people to reap where they
[49:31] didn't sow how much more you
[49:35] what do you think about yourself this
[49:37] morning

[49:43] God
[49:47] my what a position
[49:49] glory to God
[49:51] amen I'm just excited up here
[49:54] like I always say I just the way I
[49:56] preach
[49:58] I can't deliver it any other way if I
[50:00] deliver it in a softer way I'll just
[50:02] mess up everything
[50:03] I get excited and I preach Hallelujah
[50:07] I'm not angry amen I'm rejoicing glory
[50:11] to God Amen sometimes you gotta nail it
[50:14] home eh
[50:15] you gotta nail it home I understand I I
[50:18] I'm in the same boat as you
[50:20] amen I sit down there sometimes and I
[50:22] have to shake myself
[50:24] glory to God I'm fighting the flesh I'm
[50:27] fighting the obvious theory of the devil
[50:29] I fight him all week like you did and we
[50:31] come in here amen and he's still
[50:33] lingering Hallelujah sometimes you need
[50:36] the word to come hot and heavy with fire
[50:39] amen so you can leave here different
[50:42] than what you came in because that's
[50:43] what we want don't we or you just coming
[50:46] to church to be religious
[50:47] and and take up a Pew and show God your
[50:50] good works
[50:52] we're not coming for that we want to
[50:55] leave different here
[50:56] I want to know him as Paul said in the
[50:59] power of his resurrection I want to walk
[51:01] out of here different today even myself
[51:03] I want to know him in a greater way as
[51:05] the words coming forth
[51:08] oh my
[51:10] what is Abraham's greatest example of
[51:12] obedience to God by faith Abraham obeyed
[51:16] when he was called to go to a place that
[51:20] he received as an inheritance you see
[51:22] the greatest
[51:25] part of Abraham is he oh the calling of
[51:29] God in his life
[51:31] oh how we fight that so much when God
[51:34] calls us in many different directions in
[51:37] our lives many different simple things
[51:40] in our lives God leading us along the
[51:43] path amen
[51:44] speak into our hearts amen you ask God
[51:49] to speak to you and you asking for your
[51:52] direction
[51:53] and his perfect will for your life he
[51:56] will speak that to your heart
[51:58] amen but it's whether you'll be obedient
[52:01] to it
[52:02] oh you think it was easy for Abraham to
[52:06] leave his home
[52:07] you think it was easy for him to leave
[52:09] his family and everything behind and
[52:12] goes to a land that he knew nothing
[52:14] about that was a Strange Land to him
[52:18] it wasn't easy for him
[52:20] but he did it
[52:21] because he obeyed God
[52:25] he had faith
[52:27] when God speaks
[52:29] Faith speaks into our hearts
[52:33] and he went out not knowing where he was
[52:35] going by faith he went to live in a land
[52:38] promise as a foreigner
[52:40] in a foreign land intense with Isaac
[52:44] Jake Heirs of the same promise
[52:48] Abraham was the father of faith not of
[52:50] law
[52:52] his whole experience and his calling was
[52:55] by Grace he walked and lived and gave
[52:59] was by grace not because he was told to
[53:03] do it by men but God spoke to him
[53:08] God wanted to lead his children the
[53:11] children of Israel by Grace but they
[53:13] wanted the law of Moses they didn't want
[53:16] to hear God's voice
[53:18] but they wanted to hear the voice of men
[53:21] God has always wanted to lead his
[53:24] children right from the beginning of
[53:26] Adam and Eve by grace
[53:29] amen he wanted to speak with them he
[53:32] wanted the relationship with them
[53:34] but they always wanted the law they
[53:36] wanted something to do they wanted to
[53:39] Pat themselves on the back amen
[53:43] oh my
[53:45] we're back to Grace
[53:48] God is doing a great shift in this hour
[53:51] there's a great shift going in in a lot
[53:54] of Our Lives
[53:55] if you're walking in the spirit and
[53:58] you're walking with God I know you're
[54:00] going through a shift right now you may
[54:02] or may not understand it but God is
[54:05] Shifting things around
[54:07] oh my
[54:09] bringing things into the rightful
[54:11] position do we trust him
[54:13] do we believe him
[54:16] Hallelujah well you know there's going
[54:18] to come times in our lives when there's
[54:21] going to be a great shift great changes
[54:23] are going to take place and that that
[54:25] that that that area where you say you
[54:28] trust him is going to be tested right to
[54:31] the Core
[54:33] this is the hour
[54:35] well if there's never been a day that
[54:37] God has to shift his bride amen is this
[54:40] the hour in this day
[54:42] amen
[54:44] Hallelujah
[54:46] what happened to the law when Jesus came
[54:49] Jesus does not say no part of the law
[54:53] will ever pass away he says no part of
[54:56] it shall pass away until is fulfilled
[55:00] in living a perfect life Jesus fulfilled
[55:03] the moral laws in his sacrificial death
[55:06] Jesus fulfilled the ceremonial laws
[55:10] Christ came not to destroy the old
[55:14] religious system but to build upon it
[55:18] he came to finish the old Covenant and
[55:21] establish the new the old Covenant where
[55:24] the shadows of good things to come
[55:28] that we're coming but not the reality
[55:32] we are in the hour of the reality of the
[55:35] word of God
[55:36] where the word of God is becoming a
[55:39] reality in our lives amen we don't want
[55:42] the word of God just to stay in in a in
[55:45] a place in our experience amen where
[55:49] it's just by law just by tradition
[55:52] just play rituals amen that most of the
[55:57] church world is doing out there but we
[56:00] want the reality of what God has spoken
[56:03] in this day through a prophet of the
[56:05] Living God we want the reality and in
[56:08] order for that amen you got to know
[56:10] truth because Jesus said You shall know
[56:13] the truth and the truth shall set you
[56:16] free
[56:18] Hallelujah
[56:22] first the Bible teaches plainly that
[56:24] Christians
[56:26] is not under the law of Moses
[56:29] the law was given to Israel
[56:32] Paul explains clearly in the book of
[56:36] Hebrews
[56:37] chapter 5 how the high priest in Israel
[56:40] was only a symbol of the real high
[56:43] priest Jesus Christ who made the
[56:46] ultimate atonement for our sins
[56:49] for all the people and then entered into
[56:52] the presence of his father
[56:54] secondly the Bible teaches that no man
[56:57] can meet the test of the law
[57:00] whether
[57:01] Jew or Gentile Every Man Has Broken the
[57:05] law as James says if we break even one
[57:09] law
[57:10] we're guilty of the whole law
[57:13] amen and that's what he was explaining
[57:16] how can you keep the law how can you
[57:19] keep the whole law
[57:20] because you break one
[57:23] you want to teach one
[57:25] you'll break and if you break one you
[57:28] break it all
[57:32] that's why it's by grace
[57:35] he knew that
[57:37] and even more so in this hour that we
[57:40] live
[57:46] in fact the Bible says in Romans that
[57:49] the purpose of the law was simply to
[57:52] reveal our sins
[57:54] it was not intended to be a medicine or
[57:56] treatment for sin or give us a recipe
[57:59] for reducing sin but the law came to
[58:03] expose our sin
[58:05] and that's what it does
[58:07] amen it exposes our sin to a T
[58:11] we would not know amen
[58:14] sin in our lives if we did not know the
[58:17] law
[58:18] for what the law has spoken amen
[58:21] Hallelujah but there's no way we could
[58:24] ever
[58:25] before and now ever keep the law that's
[58:29] why the great high priest Jesus Christ
[58:31] amen
[58:33] but we are still living in an hour in a
[58:36] day amen where God
[58:39] by Perfect Faith amen he is Shifting his
[58:43] bride in this hour from law to Grace
[58:46] because you know why law will never
[58:49] produce perfect Faith law will never
[58:52] produce the Rapture it's the grace of
[58:54] God by Faith by Revelation that is going
[58:58] to produce the body change in US
[59:00] and the Rapture is in us now changing us
[59:03] now every time you get experience every
[59:07] time you get a truth that sets you free
[59:09] inside of you that is the rapture
[59:11] changing you
[59:13] and you realize you know it
[59:15] you
[59:16] will you know when your you truth is
[59:19] being revealed to you because you shall
[59:21] know the truth and the truth shall set
[59:24] you free so don't tell me you don't know
[59:26] that you're being set free from truth
[59:29] amen maybe truth is not being revealed
[59:31] to you and you need to get your life
[59:33] right maybe you need to repent in your
[59:36] life
[59:38] because truth
[59:40] you will know it sets you free
[59:43] Hallelujah you keep praying for me my
[59:46] saints of God
[59:48] as I'm battling up here
[59:50] to bring what God wants me to bring
[59:53] the Tabernacle in the temple where the
[59:55] holy Place made with hands
[59:58] but they were never meant to be
[1:00:01] permanent
[1:00:02] they were but copies of the true things
[1:00:04] Hebrews 9 24 the law had built in had a
[1:00:09] built-in expiry date
[1:00:12] being filled as it was external
[1:00:16] regulations applying until the time of
[1:00:20] the New Order
[1:00:21] Hebrews 9 11. but Christ being come a
[1:00:25] high priest of good things to come by
[1:00:28] greater and more by a greater and more
[1:00:30] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[1:00:33] that is to say not of this building
[1:00:36] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[1:00:39] through the eternal spirit offer himself
[1:00:42] without spot to God Purge our conscience
[1:00:46] from dead Works to serve the Living God
[1:00:50] wow
[1:00:52] amen that's what it does my brothers and
[1:00:55] sisters that's our experience that the
[1:01:00] word when the word gets inside of you
[1:01:02] amen it does that that's what Grace is
[1:01:07] it purges our conscience from sin that
[1:01:11] we have no more conscious of sin dull
[1:01:15] sin is in this flesh and we make
[1:01:17] mistakes every day
[1:01:19] but it's different and separated that's
[1:01:22] what the new birth does it separates you
[1:01:24] the attribute from the flesh with inside
[1:01:27] and your conscience is purged by the
[1:01:31] blood
[1:01:32] the blood that cleanses us
[1:01:36] oh my
[1:01:40] Hallelujah you talk about
[1:01:43] an experience when you come into that
[1:01:46] and I'm not saying who is and who is not
[1:01:49] this morning but you come into that that
[1:01:51] changes your whole life
[1:01:53] when you come into a realization
[1:01:56] amen and experience
[1:01:58] every day you're walking
[1:02:01] that's why you don't worry
[1:02:03] that's why you don't fret that's why you
[1:02:05] don't fight
[1:02:06] amen your conscience that's where he
[1:02:09] goes the blood goes to your conscience
[1:02:11] and purges your conscience
[1:02:13] from all sin of this flesh
[1:02:16] I never did it in the first place
[1:02:18] or you can say it all you want but you
[1:02:20] walk outside these doors you make a
[1:02:22] mistake you're under the law you're
[1:02:23] condemned
[1:02:25] condemnation comes That's the Law that's
[1:02:29] not Grace
[1:02:31] that's the word of God but when your
[1:02:34] conscience has been purged amen you make
[1:02:37] a mistake you fall you're pressing
[1:02:39] towards the mark of the high calling in
[1:02:41] Christ Jesus you're pressing on Amen you
[1:02:44] take the blood the atonement and wash
[1:02:47] this flesh but you yourself keep
[1:02:50] pressing on
[1:02:51] oh my you talk about confidence you
[1:02:54] can't preach confidence out there to you
[1:02:56] like he like he can do when he comes
[1:02:59] inside of you there's this kind of
[1:03:01] confidence amen is going to shake the
[1:03:03] world it's shaking the world now it's
[1:03:06] going to shift everything what's being
[1:03:08] preached today around the world the true
[1:03:10] Ministers of God Amen is putting every
[1:03:14] prophecy into place there's control in
[1:03:17] the world events that are taking place
[1:03:20] right now
[1:03:21] we are nothing
[1:03:23] then you're saying he is nothing
[1:03:27] we are weak then you're saying he is
[1:03:29] weak
[1:03:31] no no no
[1:03:32] not this man
[1:03:35] I know who he is
[1:03:37] and I'm getting to know him greater and
[1:03:39] greater
[1:03:40] Hallelujah
[1:03:43] one problem with the Eternal priest
[1:03:46] was that they were sinful
[1:03:48] they had to bring a sin offering for the
[1:03:50] people as well as a sin offering for
[1:03:53] themselves
[1:03:54] Jesus Christ did not bring any sin
[1:03:56] offering
[1:03:57] the scripture speaks of him in this
[1:03:59] manner
[1:04:01] for such a high priest was fitted for us
[1:04:04] who in the whole holy harmless undefiled
[1:04:09] separated from sinners
[1:04:11] and has become higher than the heavens
[1:04:14] unlike the other High Priestess
[1:04:17] he does not need any to offer any
[1:04:20] sacrifices day after day
[1:04:22] for
[1:04:23] his own sins
[1:04:25] and then for the sins of the people
[1:04:28] he sacrificed for their sins now listen
[1:04:35] oh my
[1:04:36] he sacrificed for their sins once
[1:04:40] for all
[1:04:42] when he offered himself
[1:04:51] Hallelujah
[1:04:53] I can just stop right here and walk out
[1:04:56] that's so beautiful that's all we need
[1:04:59] that's all we need
[1:05:02] when you catch a revelation of that
[1:05:05] and that becomes real into your heart
[1:05:08] it's over
[1:05:10] the sin question is over
[1:05:13] the law is finished
[1:05:15] Grace has taken over
[1:05:19] Hallelujah
[1:05:21] glory to God
[1:05:24] for the law appoints and high priests
[1:05:26] men who are weak
[1:05:28] but the oath which came after the law
[1:05:31] appointed a son
[1:05:33] who has been made perfect forevermore
[1:05:36] Hebrews 7 26 the 28.
[1:05:40] Hallelujah
[1:05:42] John 3 3.
[1:05:44] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[1:05:47] verily except the man be born again he
[1:05:50] cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:05:53] oh my I keep I keep on this
[1:05:57] amen I can't get away from this Amen in
[1:05:59] this hour and this day
[1:06:01] oh my Born Again free from sin amen I'm
[1:06:07] happy night and day
[1:06:09] Jesus said must must it's a must and the
[1:06:13] people in this message must get it must
[1:06:16] get the must it must be
[1:06:19] born again our experience must be a

[1:07:44] you hear people testifying you hear
[1:07:46] people speaking I'm talking message

[1:07:59] speaking oh they're testifying amen
[1:08:02] they're talking about the message but
[1:08:04] all it is is law law not the life of
[1:08:08] Jesus Christ not the experience
[1:08:12] I believe the same Jesus if he's in you
[1:08:14] he's in me he'll testify and confirm
[1:08:18] back and forth amen the word of God
[1:08:23] what he's doing in The Bride of Jesus

[1:08:43] until it's revealed to you but until
[1:08:46] that time it is a mystery
[1:08:49] oh like the Angel's desire to to to seek
[1:08:53] into it they desire to look in and see
[1:08:56] what said many people in this message
[1:08:58] are looking into the tapes looking into
[1:09:00] the letter of the word Desiring to see
[1:09:03] what's there
[1:09:05] but there are people that are
[1:09:06] predestinated that can see what's in
[1:09:09] there
[1:09:10] oh that's the short quick work my
[1:09:13] brothers and sisters is coming quickly
[1:09:15] upon us
[1:09:16] God is dealing oh you say oh brother you
[1:09:21] know this is just preaching I just come
[1:09:23] there oh God is dealing every service
[1:09:25] that we come in here every time we make
[1:09:28] a step of faith God is dealing with us
[1:09:30] and there's going to come a time where
[1:09:31] it's going to be finished the door is
[1:09:33] going to be closed it's going to be shut
[1:09:34] amen and God's going to do a short quick
[1:09:38] work he's going to manifest himself what
[1:09:40] he's been doing and revealing halleluia

[1:09:51] part of it
[1:09:52] every single one of you
[1:09:54] I'm not preaching against nobody here in
[1:09:56] particular
[1:09:58] that's not my job
[1:09:59] I'm not the judge
[1:10:01] God knows his own
[1:10:04] Hallelujah
[1:10:07] if I can get your hearts
[1:10:09] to seek him
[1:10:11] Hallelujah
[1:10:12] the Holy Ghost makes Christ in charge
[1:10:15] and he inspires us to cease from our
[1:10:18] sinful works
[1:10:19] and we never desire to go back to them
[1:10:23] again the Holy Ghost is the inner
[1:10:26] teacher who enables us to understand the
[1:10:29] truth in the Bible when we read it
[1:10:32] he explains the scriptures to us
[1:10:35] the understanding of the scripture ends
[1:10:38] our unbelief completely
[1:10:40] Matthew 16 15 Simon Peter answered them
[1:10:44] and said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:10:47] the Living God Jesus answered and said
[1:10:49] unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona
[1:10:52] flesh and blood has not revealed it to
[1:10:54] you but my Father which is in heaven and
[1:10:57] I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon
[1:11:01] This Rock I will build my church and the
[1:11:04] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:11:07] it
[1:11:08] and we know it's built we heard this
[1:11:11] over and over
[1:11:13] built upon Faith revelation God

[1:11:20] and we look and we repeat it and repeat
[1:11:22] it even myself each and every one of us
[1:11:24] but when the spirit strikes you amen and
[1:11:28] realize what God is revealing to you
[1:11:31] how powerful it is first of all that's
[1:11:35] how he builds the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:36] his church
[1:11:38] nothing else not on law
[1:11:42] not on education but upon faith upon
[1:11:45] Revelation and not only that the gates
[1:11:49] of hell

[1:12:11] prison doors it breaks the chains upon
[1:12:13] your life
[1:12:14] but like Abraham you've got to step out
[1:12:16] on obedience by faith and take that

[1:17:13] human race was first created in the
[1:17:16] Garden of Eden on that dark morning when
[1:17:19] that little woman that stepped across
[1:17:21] the separating line and had gone against
[1:17:24] God's Commandments and enticed her
[1:17:26] husband to do the same thing then the

[1:17:44] repentance and the grace of God to cover
[1:17:46] your sins for the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:49] that once that God killed at Calvary to
[1:17:53] cover our sins they're in the garden
[1:17:56] that morning
[1:17:58] When sin was so black Jehovah come in
[1:18:02] there stood a couple stand and condemned
[1:18:06] there would be no human race
[1:18:09] they had died they had to die
[1:18:12] death on the human race give the world
[1:18:16] black to the back to the wild beasts and
[1:18:20] there would be no more human race
[1:18:23] but in that Darkest Hour

[1:18:50] the opposite direction that he's telling
[1:18:51] us to do

[1:19:38] Serpent's head
[1:19:40] the guilty one and his head shall bruise
[1:19:43] her heel showing that there will be an
[1:19:45] Affliction to the church but he promised
[1:19:48] Triumph

[1:20:45] bit Shake yourselves go ahead it ain't

[1:20:50] what you're screaming amen hallelujah I
[1:20:53] take my time I go if I'm going to sit
[1:20:56] all weekend and pray and and seek God
[1:20:58] and be on hours and hours on the
[1:21:00] computer looking for the word of God
[1:21:02] Amen and stand up here while you're
[1:21:04] sitting down
[1:21:07] sorry
[1:21:09] this time there's no Grace for you
[1:21:13] Hallelujah
[1:21:16] amen but we do it out of love
[1:21:19] amen if I didn't love you I would not
[1:21:21] have a right to be up here
[1:21:22] God would not put me up here
[1:21:25] God has shifted
[1:21:29] faith for the rapture
[1:21:32] God is Shifting you into position for
[1:21:34] the promise that you have been praying
[1:21:36] for
[1:21:37] sometime a god shift looks like a chaos
[1:21:40] a setback and even defeat but God is
[1:21:45] saying to you when the dust settles
[1:21:49] Hallelujah
[1:21:50] you will understand why you had to go
[1:21:53] through what you've been going through
[1:21:56] oh yes
[1:21:58] a god shift is the not easy
[1:22:01] it's not pleasant sometimes
[1:22:03] oh yes he's got a shift sometimes we go
[1:22:06] through hard things I look back at my
[1:22:08] life and I look the way I was thinking
[1:22:10] about the word the way I was applying
[1:22:13] the word the way I was speaking the word
[1:22:15] even the way I was acting the word was
[1:22:17] under law amen and God had to bring
[1:22:20] experiences in my life to shift me out
[1:22:23] of that condition amen he doesn't want
[1:22:25] me to walk by law he wants me to walk by
[1:22:28] grace in the grace of God
[1:22:30] we walk in Grace we walk in love we walk
[1:22:34] in harmony
[1:22:35] we walk in patience we walk in
[1:22:38] Temperance love and pray for one another
[1:22:41] encourage one another lift one another
[1:22:44] up when we walk by log we walk in
[1:22:46] criticism
[1:22:47] we're critical amen we're judgmental
[1:22:51] oh my don't tell me my brothers and
[1:22:54] sisters I come out of a lot of that and
[1:22:56] maybe I have to come out of more and I
[1:22:58] know you do too
[1:23:01] that's what he's shifting out of us amen
[1:23:05] oh Grace Grace
[1:23:08] the spirit of God is crying Grace this
[1:23:11] morning
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:13] shifts are those changes in our thinking
[1:23:17] and our attitude that involves as we age
[1:23:20] sometimes making use of indirect methods
[1:23:24] to achieve something or spontaneous
[1:23:27] other times profound and life-changing
[1:23:31] these shifts can shake us to the very
[1:23:33] core of our being
[1:23:35] oh yeah
[1:23:37] if you're getting shooken to the very
[1:23:39] core
[1:23:40] your faith is being tested to the very
[1:23:42] core and lift your hands this morning
[1:23:45] and praise God
[1:23:47] Hallelujah that's why Peter says oh
[1:23:51] blessed are you amen when you're tempted
[1:23:54] and vile amen you win trials and
[1:23:57] tribulations come upon you the favor of
[1:23:59] God is there because he's shifting you
[1:24:02] into position amen and he's shifting you
[1:24:04] out of certain conditions to get into
[1:24:07] position Hallelujah so you can fulfill
[1:24:10] what he has for you to fulfill remember
[1:24:12] he said my word won't return to me void
[1:24:16] but it will accomplish amen I have sworn
[1:24:19] by myself this Covenant is not what we
[1:24:22] can do by the law but what he's already
[1:24:24] done
[1:24:25] so he's going to fulfill it
[1:24:30] the thing is will you surrender
[1:24:34] that's the battle
[1:24:36] oh sometimes all the struggle in our
[1:24:38] life
[1:24:40] all the hardships in our life we when
[1:24:43] the dust settles you realize it was just
[1:24:45] me fighting up
[1:24:46] if I would have just let go and let God
[1:24:50] let go of a lot of things a lot of ways
[1:24:53] in my life and just let God take his
[1:24:55] position
[1:24:57] and and what he wants to do
[1:24:59] but it's so hard for us
[1:25:01] it's so hard for us
[1:25:04] that's why I guess look at the sinless
[1:25:05] one Jesus in the garden Gethsemane even
[1:25:08] when he was getting tested by every
[1:25:11] Temptation that there is no one to man
[1:25:13] he said father if it be possible remove
[1:25:16] this cup from me but nevertheless
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:20] I look at that and I say oh wow oh God
[1:25:25] hallelujah it's not easy
[1:25:28] but the grace of God
[1:25:31] when God comes
[1:25:33] your inside shifts
[1:25:35] every time you get an experience there's
[1:25:38] a shift that moves you in a different
[1:25:39] direction
[1:25:41] you do what
[1:25:43] do you want to start prospering in your
[1:25:46] life obedience to the voice of God start
[1:25:49] saying no to the things that you know
[1:25:52] that are not good for you
[1:25:54] and the people
[1:25:56] that are around you with the habits and
[1:25:58] traditions and rituals that they keep
[1:26:01] that they do in their lives that God is
[1:26:04] seeing
[1:26:05] separate from that

[1:26:10] choices that you make to say no to the
[1:26:13] things

[1:26:28] yourself

[1:27:35] in the world
[1:27:39] within our lives

[1:27:48] bride to another level in this hour he
[1:27:52] has to it doesn't matter which man is
[1:27:54] standing here or anywhere else
[1:27:57] God has a word to fulfill he has a
[1:28:01] Rapture to complete amen
[1:28:04] and that's what he's doing in this hour
[1:28:07] Hallelujah
[1:28:10] being chained to Life's disappointments
[1:28:12] circumstances Bound in these mental
[1:28:15] shackles causes anger and bitterness you
[1:28:19] prayed and plead to God to deliver you
[1:28:21] from this evil Taskmaster but is our
[1:28:24] hearts and Minds truly open to God's
[1:28:27] Direction
[1:28:29] we need to be true to ourselves more
[1:28:31] than ever before you talk about honesty
[1:28:36] honesty is of hard to find in this hour
[1:28:39] even amongst believers
[1:28:41] to be honest
[1:28:42] listen if you can't be honest with God
[1:28:44] truly honest with God how can you be
[1:28:47] honest with your brothers and sisters
[1:28:50] you can't be
[1:28:54] Hallelujah
[1:28:58] because even in the wilderness of Our
[1:29:01] Lives where there is no surprises to God
[1:29:04] God is all seeing
[1:29:06] omnipresent and he's seen what's going
[1:29:10] on around you and around your life
[1:29:12] life's continuous circle of emotion and
[1:29:16] mental frustration and now he's saying
[1:29:19] like he said to Israel
[1:29:21] you tread this rut
[1:29:23] in this wrong direction long enough
[1:29:27] amen
[1:29:29] you know people are still going through
[1:29:30] that
[1:29:32] mental frustration
[1:29:35] depression
[1:29:37] anxiety yes those things are real
[1:29:40] those things are real
[1:29:42] but do you believe God is greater than
[1:29:44] those things
[1:29:46] oh yes he is
[1:29:48] it's not it's not God's uh fault
[1:29:53] or God's issue like everybody in the
[1:29:55] world they're always when something bad
[1:29:56] in the world happens they always blame
[1:29:58] God always blame God and I always say so
[1:30:02] there's no devil eh
[1:30:06] there's an old devil that does evil it's
[1:30:08] just God
[1:30:10] well my Bible says and my experience
[1:30:13] says and the God that I know is good and
[1:30:15] he's good all the time
[1:30:17] amen his grace is good all the time
[1:30:21] amen so I I when I look at my own life
[1:30:24] and I see things in my own life you know
[1:30:27] where it comes depression and anxiety
[1:30:30] and all these things come most of the
[1:30:32] time is self-pity we pity ourselves too
[1:30:35] much
[1:30:36] then we get into an emotional state amen
[1:30:39] those are spirits amen that we got to
[1:30:42] recognize and cast away from us it's our
[1:30:45] choices in our mind what we choose to
[1:30:48] believe what we choose to feed on in
[1:30:51] this hour
[1:30:52] listen no matter how dark it gets I
[1:30:55] choose to believe in the light
[1:30:57] I choose to believe there's a light at
[1:30:59] the end of the tunnel
[1:31:00] Hallelujah no matter how sick I get I
[1:31:03] choose to believe in healing
[1:31:05] oh yes I choose to believe in it no
[1:31:08] matter how bound I feel I choose to
[1:31:10] believe in Deliverance because his word
[1:31:13] has testified over and over and he has
[1:31:16] demonstrated it in my life so many times
[1:31:19] that he is more than able
[1:31:22] not able but more than able
[1:31:26] to do what he said he was going to do in
[1:31:28] my life and he's more than able to do
[1:31:30] what he's going to do in your life
[1:31:32] depression can't stand in the presence
[1:31:35] of God
[1:31:36] anxiety sickness can't stand in the
[1:31:39] presence of God
[1:31:42] death can't even stand in his presence
[1:31:46] the problem is we need to get into his
[1:31:48] presence
[1:31:49] we need to repent
[1:31:51] and get in his presence and turn our
[1:31:54] lives around
[1:31:57] moving and trying to work this out work
[1:32:00] that out intellectually trying to figure
[1:32:03] things out in our lives when God his
[1:32:05] word is standing right here Deliverance
[1:32:08] standing right here especially as
[1:32:10] Christians
[1:32:11] believe in the word of God
[1:32:14] Hallelujah
[1:32:17] he's our savior
[1:32:20] look at Paul's life
[1:32:24] God shifts Paul's life
[1:32:27] when the light knocked him off his high
[1:32:29] horse
[1:32:30] oh yes
[1:32:32] don't worry if you're a child of God
[1:32:34] you're like Paul you're on a high horse
[1:32:36] of life right now God's going to knock
[1:32:38] you off
[1:32:39] amen
[1:32:42] look what it did for Paul though
[1:32:44] Paul found his true identity in that
[1:32:47] experience
[1:32:49] he found this true identity
[1:32:53] you know sometimes when it gets hard
[1:32:55] it gets confusing
[1:32:57] things are shifting so much in our lives
[1:33:00] we realized like we said when the dust
[1:33:02] settles we find our true identity we
[1:33:05] find who we really are
[1:33:08] we think we know who we are but until
[1:33:10] God comes and shows us who we are
[1:33:14] Paul found this true identity in that
[1:33:17] experience
[1:33:18] he had when the voice of God spoke to
[1:33:20] him
[1:33:21] when a shift comes God is moving you in
[1:33:24] a different direction for his purpose
[1:33:26] there is no greater shift that can
[1:33:28] happen to a person outside the new birth
[1:33:30] being born again you talk about a shift
[1:33:34] you talk about your life being the chaos
[1:33:36] and all upside down
[1:33:38] when you're truly born again
[1:33:40] Hallelujah I know when I was born again
[1:33:43] all hell broke loose I didn't even know
[1:33:46] there was so much hell around my life
[1:33:48] amen I mean everybody came against me
[1:33:52] everybody's tried to tell me that this
[1:33:55] was a lie amen every demon in Hell tried
[1:33:59] to keep me in the Catholic church and
[1:34:00] under the traditions of thy law amen
[1:34:03] bound up by the sin in my life
[1:34:07] oh but I know amen like the song says oh
[1:34:11] I know that I've been born again I know
[1:34:14] that I've been set free amen Born Again
[1:34:18] Hallelujah and set free by the grace of
[1:34:21] God hallelujah
[1:34:23] glory to God Amen

[1:34:30] down in your life and puts You On A New
[1:34:33] Path of life
[1:34:34] oh you might feel uncomfortable things
[1:34:36] might be uncertain
[1:34:38] oh I might look out of order
[1:34:40] Hallelujah there's somebody here that
[1:34:42] needs this this morning it might look
[1:34:44] out of order amen the way it used to
[1:34:46] look or the way you used to act or used
[1:34:49] to believe but all things are shifted in
[1:34:52] your mind in your heart sometimes a god
[1:34:54] shift can feel very very confusing
[1:34:58] you say oh the devil's the author of
[1:35:00] confusion yeah we know that we know that
[1:35:03] the devil's a liar too amen but
[1:35:05] sometimes when God is Shifting we don't
[1:35:07] understand everything it could seem like
[1:35:09] chaos a confusion in our lives
[1:35:12] Hallelujah that's where we need to have
[1:35:14] faith like Abraham when Abraham was
[1:35:16] called out you don't think he wasn't
[1:35:18] confused you don't think that he didn't
[1:35:19] know but he know he heard the voice of
[1:35:22] God that's all he knew he knew God said
[1:35:25] go to a to a land which I will show you
[1:35:29] and that's what God is saying to us I
[1:35:31] know you don't understand everything in
[1:35:33] your life but go and I'll show you as
[1:35:37] you walk amen as we walk up that that
[1:35:41] shining way brother I'm seeing the bride
[1:35:43] walk in and step with the gospel amen as
[1:35:47] we walk it will unfold to us hallelujah
[1:35:50] that's what it means by walking by faith
[1:35:52] we don't know everything we don't
[1:35:54] understand everything but we move and
[1:35:57] operate by faith
[1:35:59] hallelujah amen
[1:36:02] when you feel everything is falling
[1:36:04] apart
[1:36:05] it can make you feel like you're losing
[1:36:07] everything how many feel that
[1:36:10] I felt like I was losing everything
[1:36:12] everything that I knew in my life
[1:36:14] everything that I built in my life when
[1:36:16] this new birth came
[1:36:18] I felt like I was losing everything but
[1:36:20] you know what it was the greatest
[1:36:21] feeling in my life
[1:36:24] because you know at the same time where
[1:36:27] Everything feels confusing every
[1:36:30] everything you feel like you're losing
[1:36:32] everything amen you feel like you're
[1:36:35] gaining the everything
[1:36:38] because you're gaining him
[1:36:40] and as he reveals himself listen when he
[1:36:42] reveals himself to you there is a love
[1:36:45] of God there's a grace of God that that
[1:36:48] that comes into your life that
[1:36:50] overpowers everything
[1:36:52] and 32 years later amen I've gone
[1:36:57] through ups and downs ins and outs amen
[1:37:00] hallelujah if it wasn't for the grace of
[1:37:03] God it wouldn't be standing here this
[1:37:04] morning but that love that first love is
[1:37:07] even greater in my heart
[1:37:10] him in my heart more than ever before
[1:37:14] you that's not law my brothers that's
[1:37:16] the grace of God hallelujah
[1:37:19] when your mindset shifts your life
[1:37:23] shifts
[1:37:24] that's why he says put on the mind of
[1:37:27] Christ
[1:37:28] God says think on these things and put
[1:37:30] your mind on Christ When You Say Yes to
[1:37:33] God God leads you and everything around
[1:37:36] you shifts into position to fulfill the
[1:37:39] word of God and he places inside of you
[1:37:42] and that's why he said that my word will
[1:37:46] not return void
[1:37:48] the greatest shift that is going on
[1:37:51] today is the rapture God wants to finish
[1:37:54] the work that he started in this age
[1:37:57] he came and he sent the prophet and
[1:38:00] delivered a message of perfect faith
[1:38:04] and listen my brothers and sisters God
[1:38:06] is more determined than ever before to
[1:38:09] finish what he has spoken through a
[1:38:11] prophet
[1:38:12] in a people brother Branham Cried Out
[1:38:15] many times because he's seen the
[1:38:17] condition of the people
[1:38:19] and you can look at the condition of the
[1:38:21] people in the message today but he cried
[1:38:24] out and he said there will be a bride
[1:38:26] because God spoke to rubia bride he
[1:38:29] didn't care about the condition of the
[1:38:31] people he looked at the Prophecies of
[1:38:33] the word of God and said there will be a
[1:38:36] bride and let me tell you this morning
[1:38:37] by the grace of God by the grace and
[1:38:40] grace alone there will be a bride in
[1:38:42] these last days there will be a perfect
[1:38:45] faith that will manifest in a people
[1:38:47] today
[1:38:48] there will be my brothers and sisters
[1:38:50] there will be such an overcoming power
[1:38:52] sweeping over her in her life
[1:38:57] oh my the world's never going to see it
[1:38:59] like this again when this happens
[1:39:03] amen
[1:39:04] thank you Lord
[1:39:06] Hallelujah
[1:39:08] Deuteronomy 2 2.
[1:39:11] Moses stated that the Lord spoke to him
[1:39:13] and said you have compassed this
[1:39:15] mountain long enough turn northwards
[1:39:18] look up
[1:39:20] look up
[1:39:23] go ahead watch them in the wilderness
[1:39:25] moving along around the border of the
[1:39:28] promise
[1:39:30] there's no more moving around the border
[1:39:31] of This Promise of this word of God in
[1:39:33] this hour God has watched this bride
[1:39:36] he's watched this message long enough
[1:39:39] now he's speaking by faith to the
[1:39:42] individuals and says turn northward look
[1:39:44] up it's no more wandering around the
[1:39:48] border of these promises but now it's
[1:39:50] time to manifest these promises now I'm
[1:39:54] shifting you into gear I'm shifting you
[1:39:56] into a different direction amen you're
[1:39:59] going into Cadence land and you're going
[1:40:01] to manifest the word that I've spoken in
[1:40:04] this hour this is the time in the day
[1:40:07] that God is going to do it
[1:40:10] oh man great preachers are not going to
[1:40:12] do it but the Holy Ghost is here he's
[1:40:15] going to do it
[1:40:16] he's going to do it in this hour
[1:40:20] oh my I'm so glad he's determined I'm so
[1:40:24] glad his grace His Amazing Grace in this
[1:40:26] hour I'm so glad that he pushes me
[1:40:29] through the pipe I'm so God he pulls on
[1:40:32] me when I need to be pulled on I'm so
[1:40:34] glad Hallelujah
[1:40:37] oh my
[1:40:39] God
[1:40:40] Amen and he's getting getting ready to
[1:40:44] have them turn northward to go and
[1:40:46] inherit the promise of Canaan
[1:40:49] Hallelujah God's purpose for this Divine
[1:40:52] shift was to move them back on track
[1:40:55] because they've lost their spiritual
[1:40:57] Direction what
[1:41:00] what
[1:41:01] we got all the tapes we got all the
[1:41:05] Bible
[1:41:06] and you lose your spiritual Direction
[1:41:08] yes it could happen when you get your
[1:41:11] eyes off of Jesus oh simple eh a simple
[1:41:15] statement get your eyes off of Jesus but
[1:41:17] we let so many things distract us
[1:41:20] and get our Focus
[1:41:22] off of what he called us to do
[1:41:25] his purpose has not changed since the
[1:41:27] New Birth has hit your life if the New
[1:41:29] Birth has hit your life it has not
[1:41:31] changed the purpose is the kingdom of
[1:41:34] God press into the kingdom of God
[1:41:37] we are here to press into the kingdom to
[1:41:40] manifest the kingdom Amen to do his will
[1:41:43] in our lives and that's how we lose our
[1:41:46] spiritual Direction have I lost my
[1:41:48] spiritual rejection yes we all have it's
[1:41:50] all part of brother Brownstein the bride
[1:41:52] getting out of line and screamed in the
[1:41:54] spirit stay in line
[1:41:57] and the spirit will speak to us in our
[1:41:59] lives amen and that's why there's some
[1:42:01] shifts in certain turmoils that come in
[1:42:04] your life get back in line
[1:42:07] Hallelujah this is not your purpose what
[1:42:10] you're concentrating on what you're
[1:42:12] going after in life that is more
[1:42:14] important than the word of God is not
[1:42:16] your purpose
[1:42:18] God's will for your life his word that
[1:42:21] he has spoken to your heart is his
[1:42:23] purpose
[1:42:25] she loves to repent like David
[1:42:29] don't think I Repent I still repent I
[1:42:32] don't care how much faith I got
[1:42:34] I don't care who you are
[1:42:37] we all children of God repent because we
[1:42:40] all constantly we're in a flesh we're in
[1:42:42] a dimension here that we need to get
[1:42:44] back in line constantly as you grow and
[1:42:47] you mature and all you're doing is
[1:42:49] yielding yourself to the Holy Spirit
[1:42:50] more and more in your life as you mature
[1:42:53] you repent less because you stay in line
[1:42:55] more
[1:42:58] Hallelujah
[1:43:00] amen
[1:43:04] during this Divine shift
[1:43:06] God told Moses that they needed to turn
[1:43:10] Earth northward to complete their
[1:43:12] 40-year Journey that should have taken
[1:43:15] 11 days think about it
[1:43:18] think about the Revelation behind this
[1:43:21] do you think God wanted them to go 40
[1:43:24] years
[1:43:26] because he said in his word it should
[1:43:28] have taken 11 days
[1:43:31] he wanted 11 days God
[1:43:34] you know God wants to move this thing
[1:43:37] but God all know and knows everything
[1:43:40] he knows everything he knows the timing
[1:43:43] of everything in our lives that's why
[1:43:45] God's timing whether you think is right
[1:43:47] or wrong is always perfect because he
[1:43:49] knows it
[1:43:51] but also God has a desire in his heart
[1:43:54] amen and that 11 days is what God
[1:43:58] desires and God desires for you not to
[1:44:01] take 40 years or four years or whatever
[1:44:03] to go through the same thing over and
[1:44:05] over again
[1:44:07] he desires 11-day process for you to
[1:44:11] come into this land that he's promised
[1:44:13] you
[1:44:14] but their stubbornness
[1:44:17] their Rebellion their disobedience
[1:44:20] caused the 40 years
[1:44:22] that wasn't on God
[1:44:25] listen
[1:44:27] so despite their complaining
[1:44:29] their Disobedience they're murmuring and
[1:44:32] sinning
[1:44:33] God's mercy and Grace guided them to
[1:44:36] inherit the promise
[1:44:38] they were about to walk into their
[1:44:41] wealthy place
[1:44:43] so God's Divine shift
[1:44:46] Ed them from complacency to display a
[1:44:51] friendly and pleasant manner emotionally
[1:44:53] mentally and spiritually he changed
[1:44:56] their character
[1:44:57] so that their personality can come alive
[1:45:00] he doesn't change their personality he
[1:45:03] changes your character
[1:45:05] so that your personality can come alive
[1:45:08] you see somebody who's bound up in their
[1:45:10] personality
[1:45:12] oh there's a lot of people like that
[1:45:14] they're bound up
[1:45:16] they're quiet
[1:45:18] they're unsociable
[1:45:21] even like I forget the name of it what
[1:45:24] they call these people that like like to
[1:45:26] be by themselves all the time why
[1:45:28] because there's a character flaw God
[1:45:31] wants to get into that character
[1:45:33] amen and deal with that character
[1:45:36] transform that character brother Brian
[1:45:38] says the only thing that we take with us
[1:45:40] is our character that's how we're known
[1:45:43] by and our personality reflects our
[1:45:46] character
[1:45:52] Hallelujah
[1:45:56] God has shifting us from law to Grace
[1:45:59] the just shall live by faith you cannot
[1:46:02] mix law and Grace in this hour and
[1:46:04] expect to walk in perfect harmony with
[1:46:06] the Holy Spirit and expect perfect faith
[1:46:09] Galatians 3 23 but before Faith came we
[1:46:14] were kept under the law shut up unto
[1:46:16] Faith which should afterwards be
[1:46:19] revealed therefore the law was our
[1:46:22] Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ
[1:46:25] that we might be justified by faith but
[1:46:28] after that faith has come we are no
[1:46:32] longer under the Schoolmaster
[1:46:36] Hallelujah
[1:46:38] Jesus came
[1:46:40] and there was a big shift in his hour in
[1:46:42] his day
[1:46:44] when he came to fulfill the law and
[1:46:47] declare it was over by faith in him
[1:46:50] that's what he did you know that eh
[1:46:54] he declared it over
[1:46:58] but do we understand that
[1:47:01] we need to understand that
[1:47:04] God is trying to reveal that to you
[1:47:06] because walking in Grace in this hour is
[1:47:09] the only victory that we can have to
[1:47:12] produce this word
[1:47:14] he declared it over
[1:47:18] they wanted the law so much
[1:47:20] think about it they wanted the law so
[1:47:22] much
[1:47:22] that they killed him
[1:47:25] for it
[1:47:28] they killed him for the law
[1:47:31] oh my
[1:47:37] people want the law
[1:47:39] of this message so much
[1:47:43] they're crucifying Jesus Christ again
[1:47:46] they're killing him for the law
[1:47:53] I stand here I know have to answer for
[1:47:56] what I say
[1:47:58] but I know what I see
[1:48:04] that's why
[1:48:07] Paul rebuked Peter for trying to make
[1:48:09] the Gentiles live like the Jews
[1:48:16] our Prophet came in the same mess that
[1:48:19] Jesus had in this day
[1:48:22] law and Grace all mixed up
[1:48:25] by the opening of the seals
[1:48:28] the bride sets her free to live by faith
[1:48:34] that's why this message is the message
[1:48:36] of Grace not of law
[1:48:39] you see brother Brandon was sent as a
[1:48:41] seven Church age messenger into the
[1:48:43] seven Church age
[1:48:45] and that's where the mess was
[1:48:50] and the process of the word of God
[1:48:52] from law to Grace even in this hour in
[1:48:55] this day was manifested through a
[1:48:58] prophet
[1:49:00] where the Bible became a new Bible to
[1:49:02] him when those seals open
[1:49:05] everything became Grace
[1:49:08] Amazing Grace
[1:49:11] in his life
[1:49:12] yes he was a seven Church age messenger
[1:49:16] to the seven Church age which isn't was
[1:49:18] in a mess at that time
[1:49:21] think about it my brothers and sisters
[1:49:24] think about the process think about the
[1:49:27] transition
[1:49:29] I won't say certain things
[1:49:31] that will stumble people
[1:49:34] but that's what happened in this hour in
[1:49:36] this day
[1:49:37] there was a process a shifting
[1:49:40] out of the seven Church age to the
[1:49:42] Eternal Church age out of the seven
[1:49:45] Church age Messenger to the
[1:49:47] Eternal messenger
[1:49:49] Jesus Christ
[1:49:51] and this Jesus Christ in this hour is
[1:49:54] the same one that was back there that
[1:49:57] came and said I have come not to destroy
[1:50:01] the law but I have come to fulfill the
[1:50:04] law
[1:50:06] there's the same Christ in this hour
[1:50:11] Hallelujah
[1:50:14] that's what it is the grace of God
[1:50:18] the grace the god that brought forth a
[1:50:21] shadow
[1:50:22] God brought Grace into our lives by his
[1:50:25] love for us here's something else Grace
[1:50:28] Can't Do Grace cannot be bought
[1:50:32] Grace cannot be sold it's Grace and by a
[1:50:37] sovereign one you cannot bargain for it
[1:50:40] you can't say God if you do this if I'll
[1:50:44] do this and so and so you'll do this
[1:50:48] you can't do that
[1:50:50] God won't do it you can't pull nothing
[1:50:53] out of God God gives it by his grace and
[1:50:57] his grace alone
[1:50:59] Hallelujah
[1:51:03] nothing but Grace
[1:51:07] Hallelujah Galatians 3 10. I'm winding
[1:51:10] it down
[1:51:11] I still got 15 minutes
[1:51:15] for as many as are under the works of
[1:51:18] the law are under the curse
[1:51:21] for it is written cursed is everyone
[1:51:23] that continent not in all the things
[1:51:26] which are written in the book of the law
[1:51:28] to do them the curse of the law never
[1:51:31] made people into better people when they
[1:51:34] did these works
[1:51:36] another curse is that it's impossible
[1:51:38] for a person to keep every law all the
[1:51:41] time however many laws you keep if you
[1:51:45] break one law then you're in trouble of
[1:51:47] all the law
[1:51:49] the law was like a chain with many links
[1:51:52] one link broken snapped the whole chain
[1:51:55] is broken Galatians 3 13 Christ has
[1:51:59] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[1:52:01] being made a curse for us for it is
[1:52:04] written cursed is everyone that hanging
[1:52:07] on a tree the biggest curse of the law
[1:52:10] is that it told us what sin was but it
[1:52:15] never took away from us the desire to
[1:52:18] sin
[1:52:19] law will never do that and never Purge
[1:52:22] your conscience
[1:52:23] Colossians
[1:52:26] Colossians 2 14 blotting out the
[1:52:30] handwriting of ordinance that was
[1:52:31] against us which was contrary to us and
[1:52:35] took it out of the way nailing it to the
[1:52:37] cross
[1:52:38] Hallelujah
[1:52:39] you see brother Brad I'm speaking here
[1:52:41] and perfect faith
[1:52:44] here was the apostles
[1:52:47] in the time
[1:52:49] Walking With Jesus
[1:52:53] and he gave them power
[1:52:57] he gave the church power
[1:53:01] but here it is again my brothers and
[1:53:03] sisters how important faith is to us
[1:53:07] you can have all the gifts all the power
[1:53:11] but no faith to operate that power
[1:53:14] then what good is it
[1:53:17] Jesus had given them power to heal the
[1:53:19] sick
[1:53:20] to raise the dead think about it
[1:53:23] it's all good
[1:53:25] isn't it good to raise the dead heal the
[1:53:28] sick cast out Devils it is good
[1:53:31] just a few days before that they had the
[1:53:34] power but not the faith to use the power
[1:53:37] there's a church the bride today the
[1:53:40] holy spirit is here with the power
[1:53:42] but you haven't got the faith to move it
[1:53:44] we need faith
[1:53:46] we need understanding
[1:53:48] in God's will in our lives the grace of
[1:53:51] God to move it
[1:53:53] that's the most important thing in this
[1:53:55] hour to move this thing forward then
[1:53:58] move it forward in your life is faith
[1:54:01] that's why it's you don't even realize
[1:54:04] how important it is to you
[1:54:06] more than all these things
[1:54:08] Hallelujah
[1:54:10] the holy spirit is here with the power
[1:54:14] but you need the faith to move it
[1:54:16] see what I mean
[1:54:17] it takes Faith to move it it takes What
[1:54:20] It Takes see perfect Faith to ignite the
[1:54:23] power the Holy Ghost which we have now
[1:54:26] since he's come upon us Faith to unite
[1:54:30] it to see great things
[1:54:33] to see great things
[1:54:37] Faith to know that you are free
[1:54:41] by the grace of God
[1:54:44] Faith to sing the song Thank God I am
[1:54:48] free free free from this world of sin
[1:54:52] I'm washed in the blood of Jesus I've
[1:54:54] been born again
[1:54:57] my brothers and sisters that never gets
[1:55:00] old
[1:55:02] that we are free
[1:55:04] by the grace of God we are free this
[1:55:07] morning
[1:55:08] Hallelujah
[1:55:11] you know with that kind of Faith Jesus
[1:55:13] lived in a world that nobody knew
[1:55:15] he lived in a world of perfect Faith
[1:55:17] walking and operating
[1:55:20] my brothers and sisters that's what he
[1:55:22] says when the bride comes into this kind
[1:55:24] of faith
[1:55:26] when the bride comes into this kind of
[1:55:28] Grace in her life and she surrenders to
[1:55:30] it she lives in a world that nobody
[1:55:33] understands don't try to explain I'm I'm
[1:55:37] done with trying to explain this world
[1:55:40] that I'm walking in
[1:55:42] you see the outward man but there's an
[1:55:45] inward man that's walking with God every
[1:55:48] day walking in the grace of God every
[1:55:50] day
[1:55:53] Hallelujah let us fight the musicians up
[1:55:57] amen
[1:56:05] I just feel the spirit this is enough
[1:56:13] Hallelujah like I said I'm just laying a
[1:56:15] foundation for this
[1:56:17] I want to read a quote here it's a
[1:56:20] pretty lengthy quote
[1:56:24] from the message of Grace
[1:56:28] but there's a great story behind this
[1:56:33] I think this is our story
[1:56:36] this is the bride story
[1:56:39] Hallelujah
[1:56:41] they put him in
[1:56:42] into the Inner Cell
[1:56:45] they locked the doors
[1:56:46] they put pads on it the guards all
[1:56:49] around it
[1:56:51] because we know what kind of horrible
[1:56:53] punishment this boy was going to receive
[1:56:57] because he killed the King's son
[1:57:00] the Royal King's son
[1:57:03] stripped with nothing
[1:57:05] but loincloth on him
[1:57:08] and there he was
[1:57:10] sit there in that condition
[1:57:13] that was us my brothers and sisters
[1:57:17] starving
[1:57:19] wouldn't give him nothing to eat you
[1:57:21] think those denominations would give you
[1:57:23] anything to eat
[1:57:26] then they brought him out for trial
[1:57:30] he was found guilty and proven guilty
[1:57:32] and the sentence was made
[1:57:34] that he was to be executed under
[1:57:36] horrible capital punishment
[1:57:40] he was to be killed by inches until his
[1:57:43] mortal life was gone
[1:57:46] sentenced by the judge he was to die
[1:57:50] and he begged and he cried and he said
[1:57:53] though I am guilty I am sorry for what I
[1:57:56] did
[1:58:00] I wish I had never done it
[1:58:02] in a moment of rage and temper I did it
[1:58:05] I didn't mean to do it that way
[1:58:08] one day the king went down to that place
[1:58:11] to visit the boy
[1:58:14] and talk with him and tell him about
[1:58:17] killing his own son
[1:58:18] the only son he had
[1:58:20] I'm so glad the king came down
[1:58:24] he came down into my life
[1:58:27] he reached down
[1:58:29] into the myri clay for me and you
[1:58:33] and when he went down there he looked
[1:58:36] back in that cage
[1:58:38] like a cage in an animal
[1:58:40] and saw a little skinny body laying
[1:58:43] there
[1:58:44] in the corner crying his face all sunk
[1:58:47] in his Jaws sat back his eyes weighed
[1:58:50] back mattered was all in his eyes
[1:58:54] and his mouth was all whitened over no
[1:58:57] water thirsty
[1:58:58] laying back there on his face crying the
[1:59:02] king said stand up
[1:59:06] come to me
[1:59:10] and he looked at him and said why
[1:59:13] did you kill my son
[1:59:16] what did my son do
[1:59:19] what did he do to marriage such a death
[1:59:21] as you killed him stabbing him to death
[1:59:23] with a spear
[1:59:25] he said nothing my Lord
[1:59:28] not one thing
[1:59:30] just my own ways
[1:59:33] that's what killed Jesus Christ
[1:59:35] our own ways our own sin
[1:59:40] I killed him because I was jealous of
[1:59:42] him
[1:59:43] I got into a temper fit and I killed him
[1:59:47] now I'm to the die under your Justice
[1:59:49] sir and I realize that I deserve it the
[1:59:53] only thing that I'm crying for is that
[1:59:56] I'm just sorry that I killed that Royal
[1:59:59] man like that Without a Cause
[2:00:05] you see his repentance
[2:00:07] you see his heart
[2:00:09] he knew he deserved judgment he knew he
[2:00:13] deserved to die but he was sorry
[2:00:17] he was repented that he'd kill the
[2:00:19] King's son
[2:00:24] oh my my brothers and sisters the spirit
[2:00:26] of God to say and repent
[2:00:28] somebody repent
[2:00:30] God is crying out
[2:00:39] only thing I'm crying in just sorry I
[2:00:41] killed that man the king turned on his
[2:00:44] heels
[2:00:45] and walked out
[2:00:48] and went to the desk
[2:00:50] and said
[2:00:51] destroy
[2:00:53] all the records

[2:10:13] [Music]
[2:10:20] Walking Dead
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:46] just a moment
[2:10:49] uh
[2:10:51] your conscious I'm sure if you're
[2:10:53] spiritual your conscience your
[2:10:56] conscience let us our brother was
[2:10:59] bringing the message
[2:11:01] of moving from perfect from the law in
[2:11:04] the perfect faith that he and you
[2:11:08] actually had a battle with the spirit of
[2:11:11] law
[2:11:13] Spirit of law
[2:11:15] fighting against your minds while he was
[2:11:19] trying to bring the word of God
[2:11:21] and personally as a preacher as a
[2:11:25] minister standing here
[2:11:26] he had a personal battle and every
[2:11:29] Minister usually have that battle to be
[2:11:33] able to translate
[2:11:35] what God has revealed to you that's in
[2:11:39] your spirit
[2:11:41] and to be able to put
[2:11:46] an impressions
[2:11:48] that will bring a clear understanding
[2:11:52] and revelation
[2:11:54] who are the listeners
[2:11:56] that was a battle
[2:11:59] and I can see that our brother battled
[2:12:01] with the devil so that your prayers were
[2:12:04] very necessary
[2:12:06] remember always when you come to church
[2:12:10] we are not here to be just spectators
[2:12:13] because the preacher is not here to put
[2:12:16] on a show or a performance for you
[2:12:19] but your faith is what stirs up the gift
[2:12:23] so
[2:12:25] um it's necessary you get behind the
[2:12:27] preacher and stir up the gift that is in
[2:12:30] that preacher
[2:12:32] now uh let me shift from that now our
[2:12:36] brother
[2:12:37] I'll speak in the general sense was
[2:12:40] really trying to convey to you
[2:12:43] that just as
[2:12:46] Moses brought the children of Israel out
[2:12:51] of Egypt
[2:12:52] and they wandered around for 40 years
[2:12:56] and then they came to the river
[2:12:59] God also sent a prophet who told us in
[2:13:03] plain terms that he came and uh you know
[2:13:08] Dr Moses many sermons that he mentioned
[2:13:12] about
[2:13:13] how his ministry was like the ministry
[2:13:18] of Moses and he was leading Us by the
[2:13:22] message that we have received
[2:13:24] under the seven Church ages it's right
[2:13:27] behind me right and so from uh Grace on
[2:13:32] the Paul
[2:13:34] then it went into darkness after that it
[2:13:39] went into a lot little by little
[2:13:43] until we got back to the seventh Church
[2:13:46] age
[2:13:47] where this Prophet was trained to uh
[2:13:51] reinstate Grace in its original position
[2:13:57] but meanwhile he had a battle
[2:14:00] and even after he brought his message
[2:14:02] and left a message
[2:14:05] people's perception of the message is as
[2:14:08] if the message was a message of law
[2:14:13] where
[2:14:15] um well the prophet said this so I'm
[2:14:17] going to do it uh you know the prophet
[2:14:19] said that so I've got to do it you
[2:14:22] you then the preachers
[2:14:25] and the people on the message began to
[2:14:29] obey or follow the message not by grace
[2:14:33] that God puts in their heart
[2:14:36] but by the spirit of law
[2:14:40] that was upon them
[2:14:42] but we are no more under that Spirit of
[2:14:45] love
[2:14:46] we are under the grace of God
[2:14:48] we're not under a curse we've been freed
[2:14:53] from the curse because Jesus nailed that
[2:14:56] on the tree himself praise the Lord what
[2:15:00] I'm saying to you briefly here now is
[2:15:02] that you you are free
[2:15:06] and there's nobody here watching to see
[2:15:10] the length of your dress
[2:15:12] watching to see this or that
[2:15:16] but
[2:15:17] God is trusting that you by following
[2:15:22] his word of yourself
[2:15:25] not because the preacher tells you to
[2:15:29] not the preacher appears to be uh fiery
[2:15:33] or powerful and he says no nobody comes
[2:15:36] in here dressed like that wearing their
[2:15:38] hair like this or that or that's
[2:15:41] wonderful
[2:15:44] doesn't want that
[2:15:46] what he wants is for you yourself to
[2:15:50] allow the word of God to shape you make
[2:15:53] you mold you transform you
[2:15:56] for you to become what he wants you to
[2:16:00] be by God's power to transform
[2:16:04] now
[2:16:06] um we know that we have come through the
[2:16:09] seven Church ages
[2:16:11] we are now just to Elijah
[2:16:15] Spirit of Bradley kindness
[2:16:17] and we are crossing over the river some
[2:16:21] have already crossed but crossing over
[2:16:24] the river from
[2:16:28] the time element into the Eternal
[2:16:31] Capstone age
[2:16:33] now we understand that when that happens
[2:16:38] Moses was dead
[2:16:41] Moses my servant is dead
[2:16:43] now Joshua has to take you over
[2:16:47] Joshua types the Holy Spirit you know
[2:16:50] that
[2:16:51] what I'm saying is now you're under the
[2:16:55] grace of God led by the Holy Spirit
[2:16:58] taking you into the land to possess your
[2:17:02] possessions
[2:17:04] and if you look in the Bible one of the
[2:17:08] cities that Joshua had to go take was
[2:17:12] the city of what
[2:17:15] a
[2:17:17] I
[2:17:18] yes
[2:17:20] he went to take the city of A.I
[2:17:24] and that was their battle at the first
[2:17:27] battle that they had to fight in this
[2:17:29] new age and the new time the new land
[2:17:33] that they were entering in
[2:17:35] and now
[2:17:37] we find that the battle for you as the
[2:17:42] Joshua generation of this message
[2:17:46] is to come against the spirit of a i
[2:17:52] that is now coming into the world
[2:17:55] or you want me to say playing artificial
[2:17:59] intelligence
[2:18:01] that is what your you as
[2:18:05] Joshua generation
[2:18:08] will have a great deal to do with and
[2:18:11] you're going to have to battle with
[2:18:13] myself and the other preachers from
[2:18:15] following a message and bringing it to
[2:18:18] this time we know about it but we're not
[2:18:21] into that that is really not our age
[2:18:26] I can manipulate some of that stuff you
[2:18:29] know but that is not my age it's not my
[2:18:33] time it's your time
[2:18:34] and see our season and you're going to
[2:18:37] have to deal with that so I'm just
[2:18:39] letting you know that that that was not
[2:18:42] just a simple message it's just for you
[2:18:45] to understand what was being said behind
[2:18:49] all that was uh given to you may the
[2:18:53] Lord bless each one of you thank you for
