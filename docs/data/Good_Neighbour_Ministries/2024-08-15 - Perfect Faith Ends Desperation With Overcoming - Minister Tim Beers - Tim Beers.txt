amen but we're here tonight and uh to hear the word of God and we know that this is an age that we live in that technology is uh you know God is using technology I know the devil has got the biggest hand on it but God will take anything and use it to bring forth his word right so there's going to be people here there's going to be people online amen so God knows how to take his word amen and use whatever instrument he has in this hour amen he wants to take us still human beings amen and speak through that's what we believe in amen hallelujah amen I got a message here tonight I I um got diverted a little bit I was going to continue preaching on uh the power of uh transformation I mean the power of tradition uh but I I I will continue that later on but God gave me a message about four weeks ago and uh he confirmed it and uh so we're going to speak on that tonight and see what the Lord will speak to our hearts amen hallelujah my faith uh my title tonight is perfect Faith ends desperation by overcoming Hallelujah desperation we want to talk about desperation and if you want to go back and listen to the message desperation amen you're going to find a you're going to be blessed amen you're going to be tremendously blessed we might not finish it tonight we might have a part two for this amen but let's lay a foundation amen hallelujah let us go to Mark 5:25 I'm going to read a a few scriptures but I'll just they're pretty long but I'm going to just read one and you may be seated after the one and then I'll finish with the other three and then we'll just continue on hallelujah amen looking forward to hearing our former Pastor Simon preach this Sunday amen hallelujah all right Mark 5:25 and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians think about it many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jesus hallelujah amen she heard the revelation of the hour came in and pressed behind and touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole Hallelujah watch as we continue here how great our faith is and straight way the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague see that's perfect Faith that's perfect Faith right there and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about and pressed and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto him thou seest a multitud thr in thee and sayest who touched me and he looked around about to to see her that he that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing that she that what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth you see she knew what was done in her and he said unto her daughter thy faith had made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague while he yet spake there came another ruler of the synagogue house how certain which said thy daughter is dead why troubles thou the master any further as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he said unto the ruler of the synagogue Be not Afraid only believe and he suffered no man to follow him say Peter Peter James and John the brother of James and he cometh into the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the timum and them that weep and whale greatly and when he was come in he said unto them why make ye this ad do and Weep the damsel is not dead but she sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn they laughed him to scorn here they are Weeping and wailing supposedly because somebody died and then somebody comes in and says she's not dead and they're and they turn from weeping and wailing to laughing there's got to be a problem there and he took the dams on on his hand and he said unto her tell didn't pronounce that right but which being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise and straight way the damsel arose and walked for she was of age of 12 years and they were astonished with the great astonishment and he charged them straightly that no man should know it and commande that something should be given to her to eat amen let us pray father thank you for your word tonight I pray in the name of Jesus that you would bless us Lord Inspire us and anoint us now we just commit ourselves to thee father we bind the power of Satan oh God come in our midst Lord put a wall of fire and a hedge around us Lord help us now Lord I pray in Jesus name you may be seated as I read a couple more scriptures here amen talking about desperation tonight hallelujah amen man Romans 8:26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God for we know that all things work together for good to them that love love God and to them who are called according to his purpose hallelujah amen for whom he did forn he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn amongst many Brethren moreover whom he had predestinated them he also called and whom he called he justified and whom he justified he glorified what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us God has placed so much in the word of God Amen so much assurance that we will overcome amen hallelujah that he will not fail but his word will not return to him void but it will accomplish what he set forth to do hallelujah it's not the word that has the problem it's always us amen and that's why God puts us allows us to get into States and conditions and times and seasons of desperation hallelujah amen Hebrews 4:11 let us labor therefore to enter into the rest lest any man fall short of the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword Pierce and even dividing a Sunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints of the Merill and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you can't hide from God we are naked before God he knows everything amen hallelujah everything he but all things are naked and open unto his eyes of him of whom we have to do seeing that we have a great high priest that has passed through the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our per for we we have not a high priest which cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin nothing that he has gone through nothing that you can ever go through or pass through that he has not experienced and he experienced it and he went through it without sin Hallelujah amen glory to God so let us therefore boldly unto the come boldly unto the throne of grace that may we may obtain mercy and find Grace in the time of need Hallelujah glory to God Amen desperation hallelujah what is the full meaning of desperation loss of Hope and surrender to despair have we ever been have you ever been desperate before have you ever experienced desperation before I hope tonight as we finish and leave here tonight that you walk out of these doors with hope with faith amen knowing that desperation worketh for for our good hallelujah it's a tool that God uses in his hand to develop and mold and shape us amen what does desperation feel like or the feeling desperation mean the feeling of needing or wanting something very much his desperation to survive you want it so badly Hallelujah that you got to have it to survive that's what desperation is man Hallelujah the loss of Hope and surrender to despair Hallelujah desperation to survive Hallelujah now brother Brandon's speaking here hallelujah and and Desperation most of my quotes are going to be taken from desperation and perfect Faith usually it takes a state of desperation or a state of emergency to throw us into desperation see it's too bad it has to do that but human beings are so slothful in their minds it takes at an emergency something arise and when it does then it throws us into that desperation and in desperation it brings out the real thing that you are amen amen it shows what you are made of in the time of desperation oh yes my brothers when you're under pressure Hallelujah not when everything is going good not when everything is smooth in your life Hallelujah but under that desperation under that state of desperation that circumstance that you're under that sickness whatever it might be tonight amen whatever it might be in the future it brings out the real that's inside of you and like David said Lord if there be any evil inside of me take it out of me work on me deal with me amen I want my lamp trimmed amen I want my lamp trimmed I want my lamp filled with oil in this hour Hallelujah you talk about desperation we should be in a state of desperation hallelujah hallelujah it usually pulls us out of pulls all the good things that is in you in time of death I've heard people when they knowing they're dying the things that they kept secret all their lives don't keep things secret my brothers and sisters hallelujah amen they in desperation they were trying to confess it you see trying to see take this take what I did wrong here take make this go to this person speak this to that person go here make this right Hallelujah see in desperation they ought to have done that beforehand see not wait till the time of desperation my brothers let's not wait till the time of desperation let's pray let's seek God he said seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you amen let's pray now instead of when an emergency comes comes and Desperation comes upon us let's be prayed up now in the presence of God let's be faithful now to his word to his voice that speaks to our lives amen hallelujah glory to God Amen see the emergency causes desperation we ought to do do do it without an an emergency we ought to live that kind of life in desperation without an mergency upon us hallelujah amen we ought to obey his voice hallelujah amen now I believe that we are living in the days that we're living in we should it should cause the church to go completely in desperation you believe that I believe since the message this morning he's talking about the token message from God not me he's saying I believe it ought to throw the entire congregation into desperation that we have played long enough hello here's brother brandham talking to his church Hallelujah under that anointing of that age that he was living in where the power of God was bringing forth the word of God and he says to the people there we have played Church long enough think about it where are we today my brothers and sisters the Bible says says examine yourself to see if you be in this perfect Faith see if you be in this gospel that has been delivered unto us in these last days amen yes that we played Church long enough we went to church long enough we got to do something we got what what is he talking about we got to do something we in the token message he says You must apply the token that's what he saying we must have the token we must Jesus said be born again we got to do something in our faith amen we know sometimes where we're at sometimes we know where we're not amen and that knowing where you're not knowing that your life doesn't line up with the word of God knowing that that you're not walking with God the way you should be walking with God you're not consecrating yourself the way he is telling you to consecrate yourself that in itself should throw us into desperation hallelujah amen that should causes to step out in faith we got to do something we got to step out in faith we got to stop playing and sitting and playing Church what is playing Church my brothers and sisters it's we're not playing church we gathered here together today amen hallelujah we assembles ourselves together today Hallelujah to receive the word of God God and we receive that word of God within us we go out and let that word live it's to the dying world that the word has to live hallelujah it's not about playing church we receive the word we receive substance inside of us so that we can live this life the token on display in this hour hallelujah oh many people are going to come up to the Lord Lord Lord did I cast did I do this did I do great works this all these stuff he said that I did not know you you did not produce my life you did not reveal me to the people to the lost and dying you did not do you were not an example like I was on the earth you play Church you pat yourself on the back oh my now there are two types of desperation one the one brother brandom is showing us that never goes away we are constant state of desperation in our soul David said my soul thirst it for the Living God As the deer paned for the water so does my soul thirst for the Living God in my waken hours in my in my sleeping hours all the time my soul seeketh for God for this word of God to open up in these last days amen that desperation should never go away Hallelujah you when you're born again and the Holy Ghost has lit up your life and waken the seed the attribute inside of you that that does that doesn't come and go Hallelujah the flesh yes the the light is just open and it's pushing out the darkness and the flesh will fight the flesh is at enemity with God this mind Hallelujah and we fight for years as God molds and shapes us amen but that light when that light comes in and you've been awakened you been born again you are in a constant state of desperation for who for him for him to know him in the power of his resurrection and that is knowing you and knowing who you are something inside of you says who am I Lord hallelujah what am I placed here for what is this calling into the message which I believe God said a prophet what is this for me what does it mean for me in my life Hallelujah that's a constant state of desperation because we can never get enough of God his word is eternal he's Eternal it's constantly unfolding unfolding it's going to unfold for eternity how can you get enough am amen how can you say you had enough how can you say you know all the revelation of this message you do not know the all the Revelation Hallelujah glory to God because all of it is not revealed how amen God is revealing it and revealing it Hallelujah and number two and there is a desperation that has an end to it there's a desperation that never has an end and there's a desperation that we go through and we experience both of them that never has an end to it people in desperation are often willing and able to do things they wouldn't otherwise consider that's the truth such as breaking the law or begging for help depending on others this treacherous Behavior can sometimes seem not logical or reasonable but sometimes leads to surprising outcomes oh my have you ever walked with the Lord have you ever had an experience here and online amen that you never thought you would go through things you never thought that you know certain things would come in back back into your life and tempt you and try you from your past certain sins that you thought were gone that are still alive and they come alive oh my Hallelujah put you in a state of desperation makes you do things Hallelujah that you didn't think that you were going to do they are desperate for the encounter with God there is one woman who was subject to bleeding for 12 years just think about her now we're going to get into a few subjects here few people here she had a problem with her monthly cycle and could not find no relief in spite of seeking medical attention due to her problem she would have been considered unclean think about it you got to go back and look at the times that this was written in and what they went went through in the times that they were in to see their faith now her condition today wouldn't be it wouldn't be plagued to our sisters here if they had a problem there as unclean but back then she was unclean to the Old Testament standards she could not go into the temple she could not come to church because of that situation that sickness or have any physical contact with any other human being think about it now you starting to see why she did what she did by faith how she acted the way she acted by faith she was basically all alone cut off from God and man think about it that despiration feeling sometimes it makes us feel cut off you ever feel cut off and alone from God and man you ever feel that nobody understands what you're going through oh yes many times hallelujah amen she was so desperate for God to touch and to be healed she was desperate to find out if Jesus could heal her as an unclean woman in the day and time she would not have dared to approach Jesus face to face think about it it was a no no not face to face apparently she decided that she would try to sneak and touch him she wanted to do a drive by touch on Jesus think about it how powerful she was cut off from Every Avenue every privilege was cut off from her because of this plague but Faith still found the way in desperation Faith came and found the way to touch Jesus Hallelujah we read that story we wonder we we think of it so humble oh she knelt down and touched the Hem of His Garment that's not what the story was about if she was allowed she would have went face to face and asked them like every like so many people in the Bible but she was not allowed to do that so in desperation Hallelujah the Holy Spirit I believe spoke to her and said do a driveby touch Touch the Hem of my garment Hallelujah glory to God Amen what kind of faith is that my brothers and sisters sometimes we can't even drive the church sometimes we can't even make any kind of sacrifice for this gospel in the last days and look at her condition and her situation the story says she came up behind him in the crowd she touched his cloak because she thought if she touches his clothes I will be healed I love that fact that this woman decided to go after Jesus not in her desperation not in everything that has failed everybody has forsook her Hallelujah no hope no hope in a state of desperation for her but in that state of desperation she decided to go after Jesus she didn't let the devil amen persuade her to go back she went for Jesus no matter what it looked like what doubts and unbelief that was coming into her mind that she'll never be healed she's going to die in this condition she said no no she went after Jesus all the circumstances against her all the law against her all the people against her no she still went after Jesus hallelujah what a touch we sing that song Touching Jesus amen that's all that matters I don't care how you touch him where you touch him but touch him amen and your desperation will come to an end Hallelujah glory to God Amen she was gonna press through she was desperate to touch him hallelujah amen if her broken body and her soul could somehow get in contact with the essence of this man Jesus perhaps his his very nature would change her oh my what faith amen glory to God tonight amen oh touching Jesus that's all that really matters and my life will never be the same Only One Touch One Touch hallelujah amen glory to God why does she have to go through that why so many 12 years think about it 12 years you say oh you know brother I've been going through this trial for two months six months a year 12 years Hallelujah hallelujah amen let us move on Paul's suffering 2 Corinthians 11:27 the Apostle Paul description of his trials also highlighted desperation from physical deprivation in 2 Corinthians 11:27 he recounts in weariness in painfulness in watchings often think about it in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold in nakedness Paul relentlessly missioned worked brought him face to face with physical sufferings constantly because of his work and his calling from Paul's words we can learn perseverance in faith despite his hardship Paul REM a steadfast in the mission of Faith serving as an example of his unwavering commitment oh so many people start so many people want to serve the Lord if you really truly want to serve the Lord you think it's going to be a bet of roses a bet of EAS hallelujah amen like Paul he suffered many things Hallelujah people forsaken him Brethren forsaken him Hallelujah people coming against him and his teachings amen hallelujah but he was committed to serving the lord no matter what he was desperate many states of desperation he was in during his mission during his ministry Allelujah he was in a state of desperation a lot but he said Hallelujah even that time when he asked the Lord three times Lord remove this Thorn oh that thorn that was in his flesh don't think it was something light amen no it Disturbed his life tremendously he said Lord take this Thorn away from me you know I may serve you better I may be a better Christian Hallelujah all these excuses but the Lord answered him back and said Paul my grace is sufficient for you in your weakness you're going to be made strong Hallelujah and then Paul says now Hallelujah my faith I've heard from the Lord amen in my weakness I'll be made strong now I'll Glory think about it now I'll glory in my infirmities Hallelujah glory to God my brothers and sisters now he took the trials he took the thorn he took the desperation amen by faith and he used it for the gospel to go forth the word to go forth in the hour Oh my he didn't turn around and fall down he didn't give up amen he didn't backslide to get lukewarm and lazy in this hour he kept going forth on fire with God Amen on fire for the spirit of God Amen Hallelujah desperation causes us to go deeper we dig deep into faith and the Lord is digging deeper into our hearts through desperation Amen to bring out the potential of the attribute of the seed that's within us because it's faith we need to give a strength that press forward to overcome in this hour amen oh you're going to hope you're going to thank God for desperation Amen in times of desperations amen hallelujah I know the flesh don't like it the flesh don't like trials the flesh don't like hard times the flesh don't like to suffer the flesh don't like to go through lack amen he wants it perfect in every single one of us hallelujah I don't want trials but I know they're good for me Hallelujah I know what they have done for me in my life but do I like them no I don't think one bit about them I don't wake up in the morning and say oh Lord what good trial you going to give me today I wake up in the morning say Lord Liberty Freedom Grace love amen but I know they do a work within us amen it causes us to dig deeper and cry out to God hallelujah amen amen look at elaser got desperate when a responsibility think about it God gives us responsibilities when you have come in contact with this word in this hour you have been given a responsibility Hallelujah aler in desperation was given a responsibility was placed upon him to huntt for a bride for Isaac you imagine the desperation of of the prophet of this hour amen hallelujah he was the elaser of this hour to hunt for a bride for Isaac the desperation that came upon him we can look at the tapes we can hear the voice amen we can hear all these things in his life and see that desperation was constantly on him throughout his whole life until the day God took him home Hallelujah why because of the responsibility now elaser being a spiritual man knoweth what it meant what right kind of woman had to be for that man's wife and how he would choose it so in the hour of desperation when he arrived at the city now look when he arrived at the city he prayed and said Lord God that's the thing he prayed and said Lord God when you get desperate then you go praying that's what causes Faith to come that's what causes us to overcome desperation gets us praying elaser got praying oh God God here I am in the city show me reveal to me oh that wife for for Isaac it wasn't an easy thing back then it wasn't an easy thing back then he couldn't come back with any just woman Lord God let the first maid that comes forth for the waters you see Revelation here God spoke to him now he's speaking it the camel and gives me a drink be that woman Oh my he must have broke into something there his desperation and his prayers amen God must have spoke to him for him to say that we read these things but where are these things coming from where are these actions that these people are are producing where are they coming from they're coming from what praying in a state of Des expiration and God crying out to God and God answering hallelujah amen he prayed in that hour of desperation Hallelujah we look at Ruth Ruth got desperate one time think about it when she was standing by Naomi when she would she have to go back to her people what does that mean my brothers and sisters would she have to go back to the world would she have to go back to her old life think about it what Ruth was doing here what her desperation and her faith came out of that desperation what it did in her actions go back to her people to all that she loved before Oh we loved those things in the world before we were converted and all that she worshiped her Gods her Idols going back to her gods and her Idols she seen that all that laying before her when Naomi was leaving Ruth and her people or would she cling to Naomi will she cling to the word what will she do she got desperate and she cried out where you go I'll go go think about it are you that committed to the word that God has spoken to you in this hour are you committed to Jesus Christ in this hour where you go I'll go no matter what I have to go through what the road leads me how hard it gets we know it's the harder way Ruth says I'll go where you go where you live I will live think about it type it spiritually where you die Paul says I Die daily die in the word of God die out to the word of God she goes where you die I'll die where you're buried you're where you're buried in Christ Hallelujah y'all be buried your God this Revelation this revealed word shall be my God hallelujah there you are desperate God blessed her gave her a son oet o bet begot Jessie through Jessie come Jesus why he said because of desperation brought forth the word of God out of her out of her situation oh my my brothers and sisters glory to God Amen thank you Lord oh my amen amen that little Rahab that Harlot Rahab oh my think about it that Harlot Rahab my God she was desperate she know that death lied before her that's the problem with this age that's the problem with people in this age they don't know that death and life lies before them they don't know a Great Tribulation is coming upon the Earth Hallelujah they don't know that Jesus amen the grace of God is here walking amongst us hallelujah amen they don't know she didn't know that that she knew that death laid before her she had a revelation she was under she was under judgment she got desperate and in that desperation Faith came Hallelujah and she said hi I will hide you spies I'll do anything think about it she's amongst her people the world I'll hide you spies I'll do anything only swear to your God that my house will stand Glory there you are he said if you take this token Hallelujah Joshua and Caleb said if you take this token toen your house will stand and we have been given a promise in this last day Hallelujah that all outside the token will perish but if you take this token you apply this token to your house amen your house will stand oh my by living a life of consecration obedience to God and Desperation my brothers she said oh God I'll do anything and he said you take this token and your house will stand what is your house tonight Who's in your house tonight not only this but claim your whole house claim your whole inheritance claim your family claim your children no matter what state they're in no matter what their mind is believing claim them under this token tonight live this token be desperate for this token to be applied in your life then your house will stand like her had stood Hallelujah glory to God Amen look at Jacob Jacob stayed until the blessing came oh my and changed his name from a deceiver to a prince with God even the nation was called by his name the result was because he got desperate about the thing Hallelujah there's always a thing in our lives there's a thing is a situation see Jacob had a situation in his life amen we always look at oh it all worked out good for Jacob but see it didn't work out good for him until he got desperate until he experienced desperation hallelujah amen the results was because he got desper about the thing and the next day when he met Esau he didn't need any guards with him oh he was crying he was scared of Esau that was going to kill him and his family think about it spiritually you're going to lose everything you're going to die whatever it might be but see when Jacob wrestled with the angel all night and he says hold on and we know who that angel was he wrestled with him he says I'm not letting you go says let me go the angel said he says no I'm not letting you go until you bless me till you bless me with the faith I need till you bless me with overcoming power do you bless me with assurance that I'm going to come out of this desperation I'm going to come out of this situation Victorious and overcoming I'm not leaving you I'm going to hold on to you are going to hold on to the word are going to hold on to your promises until this desperation comes to an end in my life and I overcome [Music] hallelujah amen and you get desperate like that until you get that Assurance that's the problem we don't get that we don't get desperate and stay there like Jacob did until we get that Assurance we go so far then we get fear let fear come in doubt come in and then we try to fix it in the world and it never fixed it just gets worse and worse just like the woman with the issue of blood went to the Physicians over and over for 12 years it didn't fix her you know why because there ain't when when God wants to fix you no medicine is going to fix you no man's interpretation or intellect is going to fix you CU he let that situation be the way it was because he wants to fix it he wants to fix you he wants to fix your situation Hallelujah but it takes a state of desperation sometimes and he'll bring you right there Hallelujah brother Brad's speaking here if you don't have it don't even come to the Altar and be prayed for don't even come to the altar wait till it's between life and death to you that's the problem most of the times it's not between life and death Hallelujah but God will allow it to get to that place Hey Brother coffee between life and death to you until desperation comes upon you our brother just testified about desperation and what comes out of desperation he's a living example we all are living examples amen of desperation I know I could have died few times in my lifetime but desperation oh desperation is a beautiful thing my brothers and sisters Hallelujah amen hallelujah between life and death then something will happen then something will take place in your life Hallelujah one time there was a a man named Hezekiah think about it a prophet thus sayeth the Lord think about it thus sayeth the Lord came to Isaiah is Isiah that's it pronounce it for me brother you're going to die the Lord said it's thus sayith the Lord you're going to die I want to show you how great and powerful desperation is before God Hezekiah turned his face to the wall in desperation and he wept out Lord consider me glory to God he didn't say Lord look at this consider me Lord this day I've walked before you with a perfect heart and I need 15 more years Hallelujah after God had told him that something was going to happen to him that he was going to die Hallelujah but in desperation think about it how powerful desperation is he changed the program of God in desperation he whipped betterly bitterly in desperation and changed the program of God listen my brothers and sisters the devil might be telling you you're doomed you're doomed for a grave you're doomed for an early death you're doomed to not overcome you're doomed to fail Hallelujah but in desperation amen he cried out and said Lord consider me consider me in all my mistakes amen all my sins all my trials everything consider me Lord and the Lord in desperation change the program of God think about it change thus sayeth the Lord it's in your Bible Hallelujah and gave him 15 more years to live oh desperation is powerful tonight amen we're just laying that Foundation here amen thank you Lord if you made a mistake some woman made a mistake some man made a mistake some boy or girl made a mistake don't sink scream out in desperation Lord save me or I'll perish get desperate about the situation get desperate about the mistake then God will hear you he always hears a desperate Soul he always hears a desperate cry my brothers and sisters always oh you ever been there have you ever experienced that in the Stillness and the quietness between you and God and you desperately cry out and you know you touched him you know you touched His Garment you know he heard you there's a reassurance in your soul that God heard you we pray and we pray all the time but most of the time that we pray we don't know if God heard us but when you cry out in desperation and you get that experience and you get up from that prayer you know God heard you oh everything Chang changes when you know God heard you Hallelujah God knows everything but when you know that he knows something changes inside of you and Desperation brings that on desperation brings that experience to us in this hour more than ever we need desperation looking at the world the conditions of the world that it's in what's taking place in the world how close are we how close are we oh my amen glory to God God is looking for more than just an emotional response to his word God is not impressed by the excitement you display on Sunday as you receive the word he is looking for a change a change that will produce in you you fruit inside of you that will produce for the long term oh so much many people get excited to hear the word of God that but God is looking deeper he knows the heart my brothers and sisters he's looking deep the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword he's looking into our heart my heart tonight that's why sometimes all we can do is oh God like David cried out in desperation because he came into the presence of God and recognized amen like the prophet he says oh oh I'm a man of unclean lips I'm a man of unclean works oh Lord Lord cleanse me with the coal of the fire of the Prophet amen cleanse me sometimes Lord with the blood of Jesus Christ amen thank you Lord amen hallelujah glory to God he knows our hearts my brothers and sisters he knows your very thoughts even now what you're thinking we have to commit them all to him Hallelujah the Lord provides you with his word as a long-term investment he is looking for the word to produce results in your life God's word is a seed God looks over his word to perform it he said my word won't return to be void but it will accomplish what is set forth to do and we are the ones that are claiming that that word is inside of us how can we stop how can we stop the word if we're one one one one one hand we're saying the word of God is inside of us and the other hand amen God is saying it's got to perform what it said it's going to do so the word has to go through amen has to go through the the the church ages the word has to go through the trials the seed has to come up through the mud the Lily has to press through the mud we have to go through trials and tribulations amen hallelujah every son and daughter of God that comes to God must be tried must be tested must be proven to be true hallelujah amen glory to God getting excited about the word you receive God's word is one thing but if that excitement does not lead to an execution a death inside of you or applying that token there will be no long-term lasting results getting excited about something God said is good but excitement wears off amen when emotions are over what are you going to do with the word you received oh yes I've been there sweet in the mouth Hallelujah glory to God all the promises of God I claim them all they're sweet sweet sweet amen but oh when it gets into the belly oh it gets a little bitter amen oh Hallelujah my brothers and sisters amen that's when desperation comes Hallelujah huah amen glory to God some Christians love to have their emotions stirred I am all for uplifting experiences from time to time amen even the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need it to refresh us refresh us refresh us but what good is the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Bram said people have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life and still go to hell because it's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost in This Hour it's the Holy Ghost himself that's what we need the Holy Ghost himself and the baptism is just blessings hallelujah amen glory to God however many cases uh emotionally Highs are without understanding that's the problem in fact lasting changes can only come from the word of God you understand that digs deep within us amen that word that we understand not with our own understanding lean not to your your own understanding Revelation revealed to you God revealing giving you the understanding something that you did not know something that you did not figure out by your intellect like Jesus said to Peter flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you but my father has revealed it unto you amen you didn't come to me and say I am the Son of God on your own understanding or that you looked at me for the last three years and figured it out on your own no and that's where a lot of places are in the message today because we have all the books and the tapes we try to figure it out on our own no it's still the same thing today flesh and blood cannot reveal it the tapes cannot reveal it unto you but only my Father which is in heaven can reveal and give you the understanding that you need in this hour the tapes are good everything is good Hallelujah the letter kill it but the spirit give it life amen the letter is good but without the spirit it's still death amen hallelujah Satan wants to stop you Hallelujah before you're trapped into potentially of the word sown in your heart he wants to stop that word from being sown he's always trying to distract he's always trying to put things in front we're going to talk about that on part two how God swws the seed and how the the enemy has so many different tactics that try to take that word of God out of of you Hallelujah that's why we have to be in such a place with God surrender to God all I know is when God called me into this word and this word opened up to me Supernatural experiences Supernatural changes listen all I was just desperate I wasn't desperate for one meeting or in one meeting I was desperate for years and I'm still desperate today for that word of God to manifest in my life for that word of God to overcome in my life for that word of God that change my life amen glory to God Amen and that that state of desperation around you that state of awareness around you that state of understanding around you amen helps you from the distractions of the enemy you can discern amen the body of the Lord you can discern where it's God and where's the devil trying to distract you away from his word and his will for your life so many people left God Walking with God and walking up the path and they start walking and they're blessed and you hear it in their voice you hear it in their testimony what happens a couple years later their side rail their Sidetrack because somewhere along the way they stop they looking at Jesus they stop that anointing around their life that desperation for the word of God to manifest in their life oh God when I feel that I'm not desperate enough or I feel I'm not hunger and thirst for God enough I get desperate I get desperate my brothers and sisters I get on my knees oh God where did I miss you oh God where did I go wrong what did I do what happened Lord show me I'll make it right I'll do like like like like Ruth I'll do anything I'll go anywhere I'll say anything I'll make anything I'll confess anything amen when you get desperate and you want God bad enough that's what will happen with you in your life amen hallelujah I got a few more minutes here amen amen so when the excitement is over make sure you retain enough of the word of God to endure through any challenges that may come your way make sure you receive the word hallelujah you know a cow takes his food and he chews it he throws it up and he eats it again choose it choose it choose it I'm I'm sorry to say in this age that we live in the most darkest Wicked gross Darkness age that we live in the most distracted age that we've ever lived in sometimes God speaks to us through these messages speaks to our hearts and we don't go back and chew it again and chew it again listen when God speaks to me through a message and I hear a message something stirs in my heart I got to go back and chew it again I got to go back and chew it again that's what I do amen hallelujah I get blessed from all messages amen but some of them strike me God speaks to me amen and I got to go back and listen to it again amen hallelujah that's what we got to do in this hour not just take it lightly let it sink in let it anchor in the word has got to Anchor got to be solid within us the devil's always using and trying to take that seed that's sewing in our hearts out of us and if he takes it out it can't grow it doesn't produce fruit amen perfect faith brother Brown is speaking here when Satan tempts us we are to resist him in perfect faith in a perfect word like Jesus did the word of God is perfect we to have perfect faith in this perfect word and resist Satan death think about it listen to me my brothers and sisters death couldn't even stand in his presence why because people are like everybody make him he was a holy man and that we know that but see Jesus could have defeated Satan with his power but he didn't he could have defeated Satan in a lot of different ways but he didn't he took the word he took the word and defeated Satan Hallelujah because he was the word and Jesus is saying to us I want that word to become you me and you one in the same again and it's that word that death couldn't even stand in his presence sickness couldn't stand in his presence flowing from him was Rivers like virtue going out constantly Rivers going into his garments we talked about that these people lying in the shadows just put one finger on His Garment and was healed when that woman done that then everybody wanted to touch His Garment because they seen that there was virtue going out from him constantly flowing like Rivers see why because he believ that word he believed who he was he knew who he was he had perfect faith in who he was you see where that anointing is that's why brother brand preached false anointed ones at the end time because an anointing can come on the rain falls on the just and the unjust the rain the that anointing can come on without having the word who you are inside that's that that's what produced This Not That anointing out there all these false anointings out there that word that anointed word was what produced all this in Jesus's life Hallelujah and the same word brother Brandon would come into a meeting and for 50 miles 100 miles people were just being healed healed healed because of that anointing when he came why because he was a holy man and that no it was a holy God it was the revelation of the word amen that he was constantly in desperation in his life dying out to making it live it was living that token was being applied in his life that's what's the anointing that Jesus produced amen now if you AB AB in me through him he brought the word to you and my words abide in you then walk in the same kind of way virtue will flow from you but if it's really there it really happens notice now perfect faith is the master of all circumstances Hallelujah perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it listen when you get in desperation and faith comes in each one of these situations here when that Faith came it mastered their circumstances their situations amen hallelujah now just watch when you believe anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances is that don't have one thing to do with it you see that perfect faith that you got through desperation it Masters it hallelujah amen musicians come like I said there's going to be a part two to this let me just close off here with a couple quotes here amen perfect Faith again now and now we become Anointed with that same Spirit anointed Messiahs Messiahs in the last days to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving amongst his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself they are becoming one with the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making the same manifestations there's nothing left for us to do but believe it now listen what he's saying here that struck my heart there's nothing left for us to do do but believe it and believe that it is a substance faith is a substance so he's saying this token this message he's saying there's nothing left for us to do but believe it but believe what believe is a substance it's a reality it's real it's living in this hour oh my it should constantly throw us in a state of desperation this see this word manifest in our lives amen end in desperation is overcoming and letting go it's surrendering your will to God when you persevere like Jacob wrestled with the angel all night and pass through whatever is holding you back when you trust God's word and and it comes to pass and it manifests when you believe without seeing the supernatural signs like Jesus said blessed are those who believe without see in you see the Book of Revelation says it's given to the Overcomer what is given to us a complete relationship with Jesus Christ is what the Overcomer receives you must have something to overcome you must get desperate in your overcoming desperation is used in many ways to develop an overcoming persevering fighting Soldier to take God's word word and bring it into a manifestation oh my perfect Faith ends desperation Hallelujah God bless you Saints let us stand I pray something was spoken here tonight that would strike your heart and go back and feed on it amen go back and listen to these messages that are coming forth especially when they strike your heart Allelujah the next the next part we're going to talk more about the word of God being swing in our hearts and and how desperation to keep that word of God growing Hallelujah desperation comes upon us not to destroy us not to break us but to make us desperation comes on us to push us forward Amen brother Bram says God is constantly pushing me through that pipe amen desperation is a tool that God uses to push us and push us and keep pushing us we as humans in this flesh this Dimension everything that we battle with this is the most deceiving age all the ages are gathered and consumed and and are consumed in this age and that's what me and you are fighting don't take it lightly like we've been preaching because I'm in the message be in Christ because I believe a prophet believe that you're a son and daughter of God that the word of God is manifesting the word of God is in your life Hallelujah he preached that token message he said the church should be in a constant state of desperation that desperation should never end the only thing only desperation that should end is when perfect perfect faith comes in your situation and brings you and causes you to overcome but that state of desperation of wanting to know who you are and to go forward listen we're still here we're still fighting a battle here amen the devil's still real my brothers and sisters Hallelujah changes are taking place things are going on Amen a lot of changes have taken place here amen people's minds wavering wondering Hallelujah we got to get in a state of desperation amen who are we who we serving who are we believing in who we believe is here who do we worship Jesus Christ Hallelujah he hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever you come here believing you come here expecting no matter who's standing up here who's in charge here is the Holy Ghost is the head of the church amen get all these cobwebs these lies out of your head I know what I'm talking about amen get them out of your head here and abroad it's the Holy Ghost come expecting the Holy Spirit to move the pillar of fire to move in our mids Hallelujah get desperate to see the moving of God here you are the church you bring God in here you bring your anointing your consecration in here don't expect anybody else to to do it for you you bring it here you bring your prayer life here hallelujah watch God move when there's desperate people in our midst God will move he always hears the Cry of desperate hearts in every desperate situation amen hallelujah glory to God
