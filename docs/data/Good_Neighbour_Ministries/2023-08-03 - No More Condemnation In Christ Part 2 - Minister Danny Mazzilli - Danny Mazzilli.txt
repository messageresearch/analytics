his honor amen God bless you and welcome once again to our Wednesday night bible study service how many enjoys having the Wednesday night mid week Services where we can come together and we can you

God's plan for this day and for this hour the word for our day and for our hour let us let us go to prayer before we go to the word of God tonight amen father what an honor what a privilege it is Lord once again to know that we can assemble with the Living God that every time you assemble where two or three are gathered in Your Name Lord you promised that you would be in the midst according to your

goes beyond even what we would expect Lord we're we're so grateful and we're under expectation in Jesus Christ's name amen praise God glory to God so go ahead this evening we're going to be looking we're just going to continue along the thoughts of no more condemnation now we just want to just continue to um allow these Wednesday night services you know the way that I'm going to be led is you know Outreach I want to I feel led on my heart that you know that uh people need to know about God's love and grace and why this message has changed our lives and how that uh you know by understanding the word of God it can change everything you know when God gives faith and Revelation to new Believers it is a transforming time in their lives I remember you know the the first few uh months that the Lord started to unveil his word it it was life-changing and and it's a reality that each and every one of us must experience through the word of God it's how we know that we've come in contact with the Living God Amen praise God let's look at the scripture tonight we're looking from The Book of Genesis chapter 3 verses 7 to 13. and it reads here and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat next scripture actually let's not go there just yet the Lord had his blessings to the word you may be seated we'll go there in a minute and Romans chapter 8 verse 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen praise God when we look at the word condemnation just in simple definition it is the expression of a very strong disapproval censure there was example there was a strong International condemnation of the attack so condemnation is is a is a disapproval it's it's it's condemning it's placing a sentence on on an action or or things that are being done that are not pleasing and so the action and the opposite of that is praise the action of condemning someone to a punishment sentencing that's condemnation but the opposite is praise now I want to read um you know I came across uh CH Spurgeon he's a minister that goes back to the 1800s who wrote and preached many sermons and he delivered a sermon on August the 29th 1886. and it was in Christ no condemnation that was the title of it and I just want to bring some thoughts out of it that you know caught my attention that I thought wow you know and and so he says here our Apostle he's talking about Paul after having said so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin goes on to say without any break there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus the fact that Believers are in a state of conflict the fact is that Believers are in a state of conflict Believers now he's what he's talking about this will caught my attention but not in a state of condemnation and that at the very time when the conflict is hottest the believer is still Justified still Justified the man who never strives against the sin which dwells in him who indeed is not conscious of any sin to strive against that is the man who may begin to question whether he knows anything at all about the spiritual life if you're a son or a daughter of God and you feel that conviction in your heart and you feel that that that that energy around you of condemnation the conflict is what really is taking place within your heart there's a conflict that you feel condemned and that's a good thing when you feel that conflict within you it shows that there's an actual representation in you there's that God is actually calling you that God is actually dealing with your life he who has no inward pain May well suspect that he is abiding in death abiding therefore under constant condemnation but the man who feels a daily striving after deliverance from Evil who is panting and pinning and longing and agonizing to become holy even as God is Holy he is the Justified man there's something in you there's a deep representation within you that strives to serve God to to please God it's it's a reality something real inside of you that that you're aware that con that that you're conscious that God is actually a reality you know that there's people out in the world that that are totally deny God that are totally unconscious that there is a God it's a scary thing but the but the man to whom every sin is a misery to whom every to whom even the thought of iniquity is intolerable he is the man who may with confidence declare there is therefore now no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus Souls that sigh for holiness are not condemned to Eternal death for their sign proves that they are in Christ they're thriving they're there there's a desire for God there's something in there he goes on to say I would say first of all that this verse contains a refutation of the old Serpent's gospel Satan he is the master of condemnation and he's also the master Deceiver there is a Serpent's gospel he's talking about this back in 1886 you say what is that it is another name for the gospel of modern thought that gospel which casts a doubt upon the threats of the law and even denies them all together Satan's gospel is one of just like he went and said it back in the Garden of Eden as God said questioning questioning the word of God trying to make you come under a an understanding that you don't even need God you don't even need to serve God you can create your own life you can create your own existence you don't have to worry about a hell there is no hell there is no Heaven this is what he'll tell the unbeliever even denies them altogether quote the first few words of the text and stop there and this false gospel is before you there is therefore now no condemnation the serpent promulgated this gospel in the Garden of Eden when he said You shall not surely die he was denying the word of God with what greediness our first parents received that highly Advanced teaching which contradicted the Declaration of God which said You shall surely die the doctrine of no punishment for any man is popular at this day now he's talking back in 1986 or 1886 and then he goes on to say and threatens to have even greater Sway in the future are we living in a in an age where anything goes we're living in under a new age teaching that you don't need to have an absolute you don't need to put Jesus Christ as your lord God is in you the universe the the the the the universal intelligence is operating and you're a part of that universe and all you need to do is become conscious of your yourself as part of that universe and that you are you Jesus was just somebody that mastered himself here on the earth you can achieve the same thing you can be just like God that was Satan's lie right from the beginning the doctrine of no punishment and generally it comes in the Serpent's favorite form of honest doubt yes has God said you know his way of you know listen this is the most deceiving age that you will ever experience that's the age that we're in right now and the Bible says it'd be so deceiving it would deceive even the very elect that means the Sons and Daughters of God that it would even deceive them if it were possible that's how deceiving it is can it be so he says is he not far too merciful is it possible that a god of love should condemn and punish his creatures the denial of the penalty attached to sin comes out in different ways but when put into a nutshell it amounts to this there is therefore now no condemnation to any man however he may live that's Satan's gospel there's no listen you can live any way you want you can you don't have to come under any condemnation that you know you're there's no hell when you die you're just going to go to a grave and you know your soul you're just going to start over again they've got all kinds of different teachings out there but he says here some teach that you may live in sin and die in penitent without repentance but it will not matter for at death that is the end of you the soul is not immortal and that has a lot of Truth to the unbeliever because if you're not a seed attribute of God if you're not a son of God there listen the Bible talks about the children of God and the children of this world there are people that had a beginning and they will have an end their soul had a beginning it will have an end but then the Sons and Daughters of God never had a beginning because they come from God they will never end they are immortal amen praise God so if Paul had only stopped when he had got as far as there is now no condemnation listen what he says here every drunkard and swearer and whoremonger would have cried Bravo apostle that is the gospel for us now you speak like a man of thought you have broken loose from the horrible old doctrine of Jesus of Nazareth and have found for us a larger hope hooray for Paul he is in advance of his age he is the man for the times what an hour that we're living in do you know that there's that that the world is just in a condition where there's no consciousness of God there's no uh desire to serve God people are not attending church services like they did in the past especially the new generation you talk about church and and it's it's like foreign to them they think what are you doing that for you know why do you have to feel like you need to be a part of something and why do you need to make God the Lord Jesus your absolute we don't need to do that it's Who We Are you can never be anything more than what you are if you're an attribute of God and the word of God comes to you in your day you're going to awaken to the word of God you're going to respond to that word you can't help it because it's it's a deep call to the Deep it's it's a call Jesus when Jesus was on the earth it's a proven fact when Jesus was on the earth he didn't have thousands and thousands of followers that were following after him yes he drew crowds but he drew the crowds because of the signs and the Wonders and because the people wanted to be healed but the Sons and Daughters of God that recognize the word of God it went much beyond that but what we need to see here from our scripture that we read is that Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden and God pronounced a condemnation on the serpent Adam and Eve that's where all of this originated because there is a penalty for sin and God said if you eat of that tree you shall surely die and God could not go back on his word So Adam and Eve they were handed down a condemnation sentence and it was handed down not just to Adam and Eve but to the whole human race everybody would now come under that condemnation that they're born in this world and they're actually born in sin and if you're in sin you're under condemnation because condemnation is a penalty being pronounced on you as an individual so if you're born in sin shaped in iniquity you're speaking lies being brought up in this world then there has to be a formula an antidote that brings you out of that sentence of condemnation and so God knew God knew that that this would happen because he like you know she now we got to go back into the mind of God and we've got to see the whole plan of God you see that's why this this serving of the Lord Jesus and serving God the reason as a son and a daughter of God and you as a Christian that that belongs to to a local body and serves god with passion is because God has revealed to you his mind God is made known to you his plan from before the foundations of the world do you know that that changes everything I remember when when when when I started to see that God had a plan for me that was way before I was a sinner way before I had made all my mistakes he said while you were yet sinning I loved you that and then and then and then he starts to show that hey you were actually with me before the foundations of the world it literally changed my whole experience my whole passion my whole desire something happened that changed from being a nominal Christian an unbeliever somebody that would go to church maybe once a year maybe attend a church because it was a wedding and just happened to go to the church and then wonder whether I should go up and you know eat the bread or not you know because I knew the way that I was living that's the way Christianity was interpreted to me at that time and I'm sure to a lot of you you had no idea that there was a living God you thought you heard you read but you had no idea until he revealed it to you personally gave you an understanding of his thoughts from before the foundations of the world and so God wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a redeemer so God knew that there would be man that would fall and so he already had a plan in the back of his mind that he was gonna he was gonna make a way for his children to come back and so when we look at this story here of Adam and Eve in the garden this recount of what actually happened in Genesis 3 21 unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them why did God do that see first of all Adam and Adam and Eve how all of a sudden were they under condemnation they were under condemnation because they knew that they had disobeyed God why did they have to go cover themselves why did they know that they were naked because they had disbelieved the word of God they had done what God told them not to do and they became conscious of sin and when you as an individual you know you're a human being you're still walking in this flesh and you're still human you're going to make mistakes and you're going to fall into situations where you're going to come under condemnation but not if you're in Christ you see that's the difference not if you can get an understanding and a revelation of God's plan for your life and to know that you are Justified as though you never sinned in the first place so God was showing when he made those coats of skins God was showing that there was going to be a sacrifice because in order for God to get those animal skins he needed to sacrifice those animals he was showing that there would be a covering for their sin he was showing and that's why in Israel you know all the way through the Old Testament they would take a a lamb and they would and they would they they would kill the lamb and that lamb would be the covering for their sin but it was not enough to take away their sin but what we're drawing from this is that God was showing that he had a plan now let's go to the next scripture reading we want to understand this because we're doing Bible study here tonight we want to look at this in Romans chapter 5 verses 12 to 15 it says wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned we just talked about it was the sin of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden it was that original sin that brought about a complete sentence of condemnation and death to all mankind for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law so God had to put a penalty on the law on on the sin but nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression so regardless people want to say oh I don't you know I live good I I'm not bad I've you know I hear people I never killed anybody yeah you may not have you know actually killed somebody by murdering them physically but you know that if you say one thing against somebody you're killing them it's sin it's unbelief it's you know you cannot justify you cannot be justified by your own Works never can you ever be justified by by you know you listen when the cop pulls you over and you you know you're doing 130 kilometers an hour and it's a hundred kilometers and he pulls you over and he says do you know you were doing 130 kilometers an hour the most foolish thing for you to do is to turn around and say no I wasn't are you sure meanwhile you look down at your Speedo when you saw that cop and you looked down and you've seen 130 and you said I'm done but the most foolish thing to do is to deny it I laughed because I remember back in the days I said are you sure you that was my car that you that you clocked oh yeah that was your car I clocked but nevertheless that's the law and there's a penalty when you break the law even okay so um Adam's friend who is the figure of him that was to come but not as the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift of Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abound unto many next slide and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification so God was saying it's not just one sin listen it's not you're this this sacrifice this it it it it covers it all it takes it takes it to the point of justification and we know that that you know justification is as though you never did it in the first place for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which received abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory to God it was listen that's why you know people want to deny the Lord Jesus Christ people don't realize the Plan of Redemption you know believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you shall be saved you know people don't understand the power of that statement but it has to be revealed to the individual it has to be revealed to them that that that you're you're born in sin without the new birth there's just no way to get back to to make it to heaven to to escape the the condemnation and and the hell that goes beyond this Dimension when you die without Jesus Christ in your life glory to God even so by the righteousness for as by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but where sin abounded Grace did much more abound aren't you glad for Grace aren't you thankful that the grace of God came into your life hallelujah praise God forevermore thank you Jesus aren't you glad that you know that that God came to meet you one day you were you know you were living a life and you you were standing by a well or you were standing you know inside a bar somewhere or you were you you were at a point in your life where you just didn't know which way to turn aren't you glad that God decided to come and visit you and and and and transform your life and turn it into another Direction let's read a story here back in an account here back in in Saint John chapter 8. I want you to notice this is this is God's intention this is what's in the heart of God Amen glory to God you know first of all I want to read um Saint John 3 16 to 19 and then we're going to go to chapter eight for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believed in him should not perish but have everlasting life we've heard that that that scripture we've seen it written all over on the roads on signs and everything else but let me tell you for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world he didn't send Jesus Christ to condemn the world a lot of people you know when when you talk about the Lord when you talk about Jesus Christ you need to receive him they they feel like that that that they're being condemned because of the life that they're living but when they come to know him in in the purpose and the reason why he's making himself known to them is because he wants to set them free from that condemnation he wants to liberate them from that life he wants to set them free from that addiction he wants to set them free from that that suicide spirit that constantly tries to oppress them and and cause them to give up on life amen praise God he didn't come into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he believed on him he that believeth on him is not condemned if you believe you're not condemned but he that believeth not is already condemned when somebody says to me I don't believe I don't care what you tell me about the Lord Jesus I don't believe it what they're declaring is that they are condemned to a life that is not going to be long-term is not going to be good they might have a short-term life here on Earth and you know because even the even the wicked will prosper so don't look at it you know like I've talked to many many people that are very very wealthy and they're living lives that there's just you know there's just all sin with other women thinking they can live any way they want they got the money to do this do that and do whatever they want and that is the life and and when you talk about God they uh they don't really want to know why because they can't accept him there's nothing in there that's representing God there wasn't something there from before the foundations of the world that would respond to the word of God Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come all that the father hath given that means there's only so many those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundations of the world so God has people here on this Earth that are able to respond to the word of God and come out of their sentence of condemnation already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God and this is and I'll listen here listen he's making it clear here and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and Men loved Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil wasn't that what I just described about the rich you know where they can live any way they want they're so wealthy they can I'm oh honey I'm going on a business trip and they're down in Las Vegas and they've got all kinds of plans they're not there to just go and Gamble they're there to live any way they want so that they can fulfill their their lusts and their desires of the flesh but yet they're living in darkness and when light comes they reject that light it's just the way it is so don't expect that everybody's going to receive this light and the light for this day is the message of this hour because we're living in a day where people have created their own religion people have put their own interpretation on God people want to live the way they want to live and when you come to them and you declare that that there's a message in this day that Jesus Christ is present that he's here on Earth he's come back again people are waiting for him to come back guess what he's already here he's living in individuals that have received his word he said on that day ye shall know that I am in the father he and me and I in you this is that day this is that hour we are the ones that are going to fulfill the Rapture the the the the supernatural catching away of the of the church the real true church there's going to be a quickening power but the scripture says if the Same Spirit the holy spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it is going to Quicken it is going to speed up your atoms and your molecules to where you will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you are the ones that God has chosen to fulfill that portion of scripture and we are declaring that message in this day and in this hour because the world is going into chaos somebody tell me that this world is not going into chaos when the world right now is it's burning like an oven it's heating up there's temperatures in the oceans that they have never experienced but in Malachi it says that this Earth shall burn as an oven that things will change that the climate change all these things people want to put it off as oh well man has done it man has you know yes it's a result of sin it's a result of the doings of man but God saw it from before the foundations of the world God saw that the world would go into that condition God knew that it had to go into that condition because he had a scripture that was that was ordained for this day and for this hour that says in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye you shall be changed you shall be changed in your mortal body shall put on immortality glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord so the Lord knew that we would be in this Dimension the Lord knew that we would be in this age the Lord knew that we would have to face the greatest battles ever fought and right now saints of God there's never been a time where mental oppression has been to the height that it's at where mental health is becoming a pandemic here on this Earth people are losing their minds people are are are completely going off the rock or they can't handle the pressure of this life social media and the amount of of information that is being constantly bombarded into the minds of the people they can't take it they're blowing up they can't take it but God has ordained you to take it God has predestinated you to have an attribute in you that can meet the challenges of this day so don't you fear God has already made a way for you God has placed something in you that must overcome this dimension it shall not fail my word shall not return unto me void and you're a part of that word this is the Mind age this is the age where it's constant bombardment don't you feel the pressure come on you know as I'm getting older I'm I'm starting to recognize it more and more you know I've got to be careful I gotta make notes I gotta put you know notes here and and and you know set reminders here and there because there's just too much going on it's a world where there's just so much information constantly coming in the war this the the the this Riot over here raising up this one here and we as human beings you know we want to know the news we and and people are designed in a way that they want bad news people want to hear bad news that's how they're designed they they can't help it you you know the minute you you see somebody this oh did you hear what happened here oh did you hear about the 25 people that were killed last night you know oh boy this world's really we see that we know that the world is falling apart we know that the men's hearts are failing for fear the minds of the people are exploding they can't take the pressure hallelujah praise God but aren't you glad that God knew you God knew that he had to come and meet your need here in chapter 8 of Saint John Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him Master this woman was taken in adultery in the very Act now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayeth thou here was the Lord himself he had written the word he had given Moses the laws he had he had given Moses the laws of the word what what was to be done and how things were to be dealt with but what the world did not recognize was that Grace had come to the Earth it's not by works that you are saved it's by the grace of God it's by God's grace that your name was written there that you were there with God that you were a thought Inside the Mind Of God that was an eternal thought it's not because you you deserve anything it's not because you did anything good she she was caught in a life just like the woman at the well she was living a a life of sin and unbelief but listen here then this they say this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus stooped down and with his fingers wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin amongst you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and continued doing what he was doing and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience Oh Glory to God when out one by one they realized that they had to face their own truth oh there's a lot of Hypocrites out there let me tell you but when the word himself comes just like when he came to you there was a different kind of conviction in your heart there was a there was a conviction to repent there was a conviction to to submit there was a conviction in your heart that God was a reality that you didn't want to continue living the way that you were living you didn't want to continue going down that road anymore and God supernaturally made a way for you to come out of that he's still doing it today he's still able to take you out of that condition pull you out of that circumstance give you life give you life abundant give you Joy you know that there's joy that comes with salvation sometimes you lose the joy of your salvation because sin starts to take control of your mind and you start to lose who you really are but you need to come back to the ABCs of God's word and seek him in prayer Glory to God but listen so when uh though uh so here now and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the oldest even unto the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst and when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee see something had taken place right there she he was revealing something in advance that there was going to be an antidote to that condemnation and that he was that antidote and look what he says and she said no man Lord see she recognized who she was she called him Lord she she had come into a realization that she was not just in the presence of some some master teacher some just uh you know other priest or some heretic she was in the presence of the Lord she became conscious of God that's what takes place in the lives of every son and daughter of God when they hear the word in the sincerity and the word for their day for this day for this hour Jesus Christ for now Jesus Christ himself in this day and in this hour he changes things hallelujah it's a reality people know that you've been with God people know that Christ has changed your life people see there's a difference in your in in the tone of your voice in the passion and how you speak about the Lord Hallelujah so she had come to realize and she called him Lord glory to God Amen and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more Hallelujah glory to God Amen praise God I'll tell you there's nothing like being set free from sin I'll tell you right there and then God spoke and when he spoke he placed Faith right into her heart he revealed to her when he said neither do I condemn thee he was saying I am the Lord I have come for you I came to redeem you all that was being revealed to her by Revelation and he said he says go sin no more just like he told the the woman at the well he told them who he was she came to realize my God this is the Messiah she had a real genuine conversion and God is still doing genuine conversions in this day and in this hour and we're to look for genuine conversions we're not looking to just get people excited about Jesus Christ they need to know him in the power of his resurrection because when they know him in that kind of a resurrected power they come to realize that their sin is truly God that they don't need to be you know people say oh Danny I want to come to church maybe next year I'll come I said what are you wait until next year for well I got a lot of things I got to clean up I said no no you need to come to church and let him clean it up for you you that's too that's too hard I try I thought maybe I would have to do I didn't even understand it but when he called me all I knew is that I needed help and so I decided to go there and I was under such an addiction on drugs and that when God delivered me from that there was nothing that I did I didn't have to do anything but believe the word of God all I knew was that I that God could do it once you've become conscious of God and the reality of God you know that there's nothing difficult for God he can do it God if he opens the blinded eyes he raised the he raised the Dead Eagle he he can do absolutely anything what all of a sudden he what he can't heal your sickness but your sickness is different from the one when Jesus was on Earth it's the same devil cancer is the Same Spirit back there that was back there he's the same one here today and God is the same God today as he was back there and if there's anything that you need that God has to take out of your life he'll do it in due season [Music] because that's his word his word cannot return void and God needs to use you for a purpose then God's going to prepare you he's going to deliver you he's going to do everything that's necessary to bring you out of that kind you don't need to come next year you need to come now you need to come right now and let the great physician deal with your life supernaturally and he'll do it in ways that you never thought were possible Hallelujah that's the God that I know amen praise God glory to God he gave that woman a fresh start he gave her a new life he said go and live your life and that's what he said to us we're not under condemnation we're not under conviction all the time we're not constantly oh I gotta do this I gotta go to church I gotta pay my tithes I gotta if you're under that you haven't even met Christ yet you heard what Spurgeon said there he says when a man is so unaware so uh uncaring of sin in his life he's not even come into Christ he hasn't even met Christ God forevermore let's look at this listen brother Branham here from the message possessing all things now we're going to talk about how God can wipe out sin we're going to wind this down it won't be long but he says here he that will confess his sins God requires for us that when that conviction comes you've got to repent you've got to confess you got to get to that place where you where you're willing to submit to the mighty Living God see that's that's the thing that that that really is strong out there when when you tell people that the Lord Jesus wants to take your burden he wants to take away that sin they feel like I'm gonna it's Pride bow down to this I don't need to bow down to an absolute the absolute is in me I can be who I want I can live the way I want and they continue in their sin and their life goes on and it only gets worse it doesn't get better I don't care how good temporarily it might be it's going to get worse but here he says in possessing all things he says he that will confess his sins God is just to Omit them see they're in the sea of the blood of Jesus Christ never to be remembered no more that's why if you have truly confessed your sin and you have repented before God and you know that God has forgiven you in your heart you'll never bring that up again you'll never bring it up and even if somebody tells you and confesses their sin to you and and and they and they repent to you because maybe they said something wrong to you or whatever and you bring that up again in the future you never forgave him and God doesn't work that way God says when you confess I forget you're it's done how many of you women know what bleach is all of you now let's just take a great big washed up full of Clorox that's one bleach a great big tub full of Clorox and then you're going to take a little eye dropper and you've got one drop of Black Ink in that eyedropper that's your sins and he says stand right over the tub and squeeze it down then look down in the tub and find it what become of it what become of the ink when it struck that bleach it was so powerful it just took the coloring right out of it and it can never be no more what is it it's gone it's eternally lost what is it the ink itself becomes Clorox that's the blood of Jesus Christ to every confessed sin what is it it's forgotten it's done it's finished it's omitted it's divorced it's put away it can never be remembered against you no more Hallelujah that's the kind of God that we serve that's what somebody can expect when they're willing to serve the Living God notice and while you're in that body when you're in Christ you are just as free from condemnation as he is you'll never have to stand any judgment God caused judgment to be struck upon his body Isaiah 53 5 and if you're in him God cannot judge you he's already judged you when he judged Christ so what are you looking to be judged for what do you why why do you gotta why you gotta wait a year to come to church because you got to deal with all the judgment and all the sin and all the condemnation and you got to go and try and make everything right no that's not the way to come to Christ you need to come to him now and allow the blood of Jesus Christ now to change your life now and find yourself now under no condemnation so that you can live a Victorious Life and now you can be put into the service of God [Applause] amen you can't be judged you can't be under judgment no more Christ took your judgment praise God hallelujah we were criminals the judge himself has become our attorney God became man so the judge become both jury attorney and judge himself and took the justice of his law in his own hands and paid the price of it himself glory to God how much more secure could you be when he becomes both judge jury and attorney he pleaded our case glory to God Amen we were found guilty by his own law and he come and took the guilty person's place that was in the sanctuary he took his sin he took it upon himself and died and paid the price and shed his blood and give back his own token his own life why we are perfectly the case is dismissed there is no more sin to the believer hallelujah praise God I amen thank you Jesus now go to the next slide questions and answers now there's a question because a lot of people you know they they got that question in their mind and the question is in 1959 now then they that are born of God does not commit sin if you're a Christian 61 hang on a minute sorry computers praise God so let's read it if you are a Christian and you're a born-again Christian you don't mean to do wrong now this is the question your intentions and everything is right but if you do as she said here make a mistake and do something wrong will God let you just go on and on and go on and die like that and be lost or will he bring you back to reconciliation he will bring you back that's right he will bring you back and if and then if you do anything wrong it don't condemn you and you go on like that on out remember you wasn't saved at the beginning so he's saying you can't just go and sin and go on and on and on if if there's no condemnation there if there's you know then then something's then something's wrong you never actually came into any kind of reality with God Amen glory to God go to the next slide he says here you wasn't you wasn't saved you just had to make belief you wasn't saved but when you're saved you have a different Spirit you're a different nature you're a new creature in Christ and the old things has passed away and they are dead and buried in the sea of forgetfulness you see but being you're living here in this world here there's traps there's traps set for you everywhere and you're walking with your eyes on Christ and remember that when you make a mistake a real Christian will always come back quickly for reconciliation halleluia praise God go to the next slide so what to do when you're backslidden sorry I just want to get there on my thing here because somehow I lost hmm okay we'll read it from here what to do when your back's slid now and if your heart begins to stray around you know there's something that's happened you go back to the Altar and say Christ renew my joy renew the joy of my salvation give unto me that love that I once had it's leaking out Lord there's something I've done make me holy again stand O Lord nothing I could do I can't quit this and quit that I'm looking to you to take it out of me Lord and I love you and walk away from that altar a new person in Christ Jesus then you won't have to depend on your church depend on your priest depend on your pastor you're depending on the shed blood of the Lord Jesus by Grace you see when you you get to that time listen we all come to those times in our lives we all come to those moments and times in our lives where we make mistakes amen but but it's it's you're but it's still your child certainly that listen your child could make mistakes but they're still your child it's impossible for that man to ever be to be gone again that once being born of eternal life God's not an Indian giver God once he saves you he's not going to turn around and lose you amen praise God God God saved you because he knew you from before the foundation of the world he knew that you would accept his word he knew that you would make mistakes and he would make a way for you to come back he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come to the Judgment but passed from Death unto life and I'll raise him up at the last days that's God's promise amen praise God glory to God you might you might backslide but you can't be lost and if you stay in that state it showed that you didn't have it in the beginning praise God so you backslider out there if you're hearing this word and this word is convicting your heart and you know that it's the truth you just need to turn back to God you need to get sincere with God you need to get down on your knees with God you need to repent you need to turn away the repent means just turn away from that unbelief turn away from that thing that's got control over your life Hallelujah but if you are a child of God the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin it says it in the book of Hebrews amen glory to God hallelujah praise God Amen thank you Jesus praise our God forevermore listen perfect love we're just going to close here let the musicians come perfect love it'll cast out all the fear to think in this brother Branham in the message love 1956 he says to think that perfect love casts out all fear you're not scared about nothing listen if you're a son or a daughter of God you should not fear anything in this world the only thing you should fear is God because that shows that there's wisdom that that's the beginning of true wisdom the Bible says fear nothing else you're just resting you're you're okay oh I may backslide tomorrow I made blacks backslide next week I won't worry about that I'm not trying to hold on he held on for me and he put a love in my heart that holds there it's him holding me not me holding him if it was me holding him I'd probably turn loose but as long as he's holding me he will never turn loose he promised he wouldn't I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee is what he said amen I will rest my solemn Soul upon that word of God and stand and say as long as I know there's something in me making me love the Lord Jesus so well I don't want to do wrong I'm anchored amen praise God forevermore hallelujah praise God Jesus says here as we close in the in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ you never sinned at the first place God don't even know go right down to the last slide go right to the last slide it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it but the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God it was always in his mind you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God not even there glory to God you are The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Jesus Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was the great attribute of God Called Love praise God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God forevermore aren't you glad that there is now no more condemnation in Christ Jesus that if you just accept the Lord if you repent if you turn away from that life if you you just allow the spirit of God to to convict your heart to where you can become pure and and sincere within your heart you will see God amen
