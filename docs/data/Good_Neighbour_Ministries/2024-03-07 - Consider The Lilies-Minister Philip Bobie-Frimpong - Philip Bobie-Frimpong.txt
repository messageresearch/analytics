gathered in my name I'll be in the m and you know that God never fails yes and David all said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Living God and someway said I'll enter his gates with Thanksgiving my heart I'll enter his call to praise so I believe that we came here with some Thanksgiving your heart you are here to worship God it's not only one one Affair communion is when you you you commun and you talk back so I believe that you are here to worship God Amen to give him thanks and and praise him with all your heart because nobody no one is expectat here tonight you are here to worship the Living God Amen so let's be glad you have to forget everything that happened dur during the day and you are here to give praise to the Lord Jesus Christ amen without wasting much time I'll read my scriptures um I think my first scripture will be from Matthew 6 vers 25 to35 but my main thought my main thought is based on verse 28 and 29 I just want I read the the verse 25 coming but that's not what is really my thoughts but just as a background but the main thought is between 28 and 29 um okay you got it let's read Matthew 6:25 to 35 and you're going to con more on the 28 and 29 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what shall you eat or what shall you drink nor for your body what shall you put on is not the life more than meat and the body th rment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into BNS yet your heavenly father feeded them are you not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one cubit into a stature my main thing here verse 28 and why takeing thought for rment consider the L my topic is consider the lies of the field how they grow they to not neither do they spin verse 29 yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not AR raid like one of these let's go to um um [Music] Matthew 22:37 to4 you can read the whole scripture it talks about how God takes care of his children Matthew 22:37 to4 if you read Matthew 22 verse 37 if you read in Mark 1229 it's the same thing but in mark it says that the first commandment said here oh Israel the Lord your God is one God Amen and he said Jesus unto them thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments H all the law and the prophets let's pray oh our gracious eternal now God I'm so grateful father I'm so thankful that you made a way for us to be here father we come against anything on like the may your great Holy Ghost come and take control you know what your children have need of tonight Lord please take me aside and use me as a vessel to speak to your children we invite you because Lord to be honest without you our meeting will be in vain but father we invite you come take control over my lips my heart the people's heart may you interpret it yourself there your your children a precious bride of Christ they are here not to see me father they are here to receive from you anything that will be a hindrance or oh God we come against anything like the as the prophet said I take every spirit that might control in the name of Jesus oh God come once more and speak to the needs of your children in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen okay please be seated first of all I'm going to read read this quotation by the lies and then uh we go from there I think it's in the future home paragraph 191 said consider the L of the field 64802 paragraph 191 consider the lies of the field how they t and spin neither I say and yet Solomon all his of his glory El has to struggle day and night to get the radians to keep his garments to keep the perfume and things going on and add this he just opens up his and they come by and take it out of him the bee and the Fly everything comes by good or bad just takes from him in other words how the Lily struggle and all the struggle that he's going through is to live for others he never live for itself all the radiance everything come they enjoy it they enjoy the perfume the bee the fly and everything that the Lily is doing his struggle to what live for others and the preacher who said a man of God that is preaching if he that gift is not for him it's for the people so it's not his gift it's the people's gift it's the people that he's there to speak to help them he might have his own problems that he might be going through but it's not will say that it's not like um I have the power for myself if I need something I have to go to God myself but when the people need can just use the gift and bum bum bum so it's not for himself it's for the people and if you take it higher the Lord Jesus Christ God himself he came down and sacrificed everything he had and come and became low in a and born in a stinking measure to save you and me he didn't have to go through that but he did it for you you and me that was the love of God that he came he when he came here he had the right to marry to do everything that he forsook all so that he can what save you and me and for you to live he has to die to give his life for you and me to live and everything natural once you are here even our natural life when eat chicken that roaster is dead you survive on dead substance you say I'm a vegetarian all those things you eat something die because for you to live naturally so even to live naturally you have to die what about spiritual Which is far beyond the natural life and if you have to live the spiritual life you have to Die daily you have to die to your sins you have to die to yourself you have to die to your pride you have to die to everything unlike Christ so that Christ can flow through you so he came for you and me he didn't have to have done that but we were the one supposed to die like Barabas they chose the murderer we are the Barabas you are supposed to die and he took Barabas place so that you and I can go free so he became us so that we can become him by his grace and mercy so when he died he conquered death grave and H and hell so you don't have to go through that he has done that for you death grave and hell were conquered by him so death where is your sin grave where is your Victory death has no power over you anymore sickness have no power over you anymore because he was wounded for your transgression he was bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of his peace was upon you by his stripes you were healed so the sickness have no power over you it's all according to your faith it's all according to what portion you accept because he even if the Lord Jesus Christ was to be standing here tonight and you say oh Lord I'm sick he cannot heal you because he has done it already a finished work it's only based on your acceptance and in life whatever you accept is that's what going to happen to you remember job everything that job was scared of it came and happened to him so whatever that you are scared whatever you are worried it will come to you but God has shed his blood no matter what you are going through you don't have to worry because God has taken control you have to give God thanks you have to give him praise as Bovi spoke that that time that when you give thanks all the all the Ws of Jericho will break it's going to break loose all those WS will break loose so when you are going through a problem going through a situation the devil is what he never G up but you also have to show him that you are not going to give up you are a son of God so you have to stand on the word of God and make your G straight forward and keep on shooting keep on firing keep on standing on the word of God and let him know that you a Son of God you are far better than what he's trying to bring onto you but like listen when the male man bring you a post that letter if you don't accept you can send it back to the sender because if that thing is he's bringing you sickness say take your sickness back I send it back to you it's not for me don't sign for it because if you sign for it it's your property some people say my blood pressure my this if your property take it I remember one time when my wife was in a Shan and one of the guests they were saying that everybody have cancer cells in their system and this everybody has cancer but that's true he said I don't have cancer and they said no great Rose you have it he said I don't have it if you guys you guys have to take your cancer so what am I trying to say if you think you have it you accept it and keep on H magnifying it because as a man think in his heart so is he the enemy just put fears he bring all those things to bring fears so when you accept those fears it come unto you but he said that fear not little flock is your father's Kingdom pleasure to give you the kingdom om and that kingdom is within you and me so you have that Kingdom don't let the devil put any fears on you he's a scarecrow he always putting fears always saying this this will happen that will happen that will happen you say no God has done this God has done that for me God has done this God I'll give him praise I'll give him thanks for what he did for me when I was was sick he healed me one time he can heal me again he provide my need for me where there was no man he provide so he provide again God did this for me and that God will do it again and you stand on it and give him thanks and give him praise even though you can't see physically your eyes that things happening but give him praise anyhow and if you continue to worship him and give him the glory and the honor that thing will eventually come to pass the devil will run away because you can't stand when a Son of God stand on the word of God you become a heart Pato to him amen so let's stand on the word of God and just believe and trust God Amen Hallelujah and as we read in that scripture um I think the Matthew that says that the first Commandments if you read in Mark said that the Lord your God is one God God has never been three he's one living god Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus Christ of the New Testament then Jehovah Witness people said that we have a mighty God and almighty God but Isaiah chter said the Virgin shall conceive his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God ever Everlasting father the kingdom shall be on his shoulders there's no God after him but if you go to Revelation 18 He said that Jesus Christ who was who is to come the Lord God Almighty so he's the almighty God and the Mighty God there is none before him there's none after him here oh Israel the Lord your God is one God and his name is the Lord and savior Jesus Christ amen so the scripture say you shall love this God whose name is the Lord Jesus Christ with all your mind with all your heart with all your soul in Mark said with all your strength you should love and the the the good thing is about this you cannot love God unless he first love you and because he first love you first and you recognize what he has done for you then you will love him with everything within you your conscience your subconscious everything has to love this God because what he has done for you and me we cannot pay it but we are doing a little thing to what express our appreciation to this Mighty God that we love because he love us more than what we can even what talk about so he should love with everything within you in the past the people used to have Idols um in Africa they still have it they carve the things and they worship them a physical thing but in no here I think they C in the French Revolution they kill all the wites at that time everything so here you don't have like physical thing that they worship as Idols anymore but in Africa they even getting rid of most of them now but what is going on is that people don't have the physical thing that they have made with hands that they worship in the past but a lot of people have Idols that they are worshiping without even being aware of some of them are worshiping their wives some are worshiping their husband some are worshiping their cast some are worshiping their job their job becomes important that coming the coming to um coming to worship God or coming to congregate themselves with one another the their job become priority the word of God remember that anything that you think on it constantly it becomes your God because that becomes your priority somewhere the prophet of God said check what you are thought hourly by hourly and see what you are feeding on what your becomes what you you becomes what you think your thoughts is speak more louder in heaven than your words so what are you thinking right now sometimes it gets so bad if you are not even careful when we are in the church we thinking about the business but we are doing this thing that thing the Devil is a is is a is is is a fighter he will come and torment your mind and bring so many thoughts things that are not even necessary but like our ENC when we come to here our main priority is to worship God so you have to purpose in your heart that whatever happens during the daytime you are not focusing on that you throw that out of the way he going to bring it to your mind but you reject it and consecrate and concentrate on the word of God that is coming by singing with Revelation singing with understanding listen to the word with an open heart and just focus on on God don't let nothing hinder you because that's what he's doing little forces by the time maybe you leave here you might not even live with nothing because he has worried you and placed so many things that is not of value in your mind because the greatest battle that ever thought thought is going on in their mind even right now so what are you thinking right God knows all your thoughts so we have to we have power as the prophet of God said that you cannot stop that bear from flying but you have the power to what to stop it from what feeding on um nesting on you so you have the authority you have the power you have the choice is according to your choice so let's put God first let's God become my priority no wonder because as a true Christian I believe you are a bride of Christ we have reached that place just like Peter he said that Lord we have left our mother our father our children everything and followed you what are we going to get he said there's no one that has left mother father children and and job and whatever and follow me that will not be blessed in this present world and the world to come so once you have made that commitment God is under obligation to bless you how is going to come I can't explain but my God is an awesome God he's a God that will supply all your needs he will take care of you once you put him first all that he want seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all other that things shall be added unto you he's a mighty God he never lose a battle he's God that loves us more than what we can even think or imagine or Phantom he is a mighty God he said that you see the thought that God have for you is not an evil thought he has a good thought on you to give you peace and to give what unexpected end that's how God loves you his thought for you is phenomenal amen so we on our part shouldn't let anything hinder because I'm afraid we've been hanging around with lot of culture and traditions and so many things it's we are still hanging on things family this I'm not saying that neglect your family I'm not saying that don't take care of your parents I'm not saying that don't take care of your children but when it get to a place that those things become more priority to you than worshiping and serving your God then you have to watch because those things the lord giveth the Lord take blessed be the name of the Lord It's God that gave those things to you in the first place without him we didn't have nothing we came here with nothing and we living here with our character so we don't want to be too attached as one time bra said that every child when he comes he's like this he's com to grab they make their hands like this when they are born when they are dead boom they leave everything behind you're not going with nothing so our priority has to be God don't let nothing come between you and your God that's why David said that I'll put the lord always before my face he's always conscious of God that's what the Believers we are we are conscious of God that's why in the job we singing We thanking God we praising God what do you think you are doing doing the spirit of God in you is what unconscious godliness is flowing through you amen because listen in life that's why the Bible said that come and buy from me without money without price is free satisfing God he's given everything to us to free without money without what without price he's giving us to us for free better thing of it is you don't have to pay anything for it but what is happening is that all other things that we are fighting for none of them have that satisfaction to the end it doesn't satisfy it for that long listen you can build a brand new house today in 20 years it crumbled you have to do renovate and try to bring it back a new car after 10 years it's crumbled you bought a new watch it means so much to you after a while that satisfaction it erods but there's one satisfaction that can never get eroded the presence of God when God visits you when he reveal himself to you when that went I don't know how to explain it your sometimes your mind become so sweet I don't know I don't know to how to put wor in it and that satisfaction never eroles it's Everlasting Eternal so that's what we are fighting for that's what's most vital the rest are good we are on this Earth we need them don't get me wrong we need our ni house our nice houses we need our cars we need our family we need everything but those things are bonuses that God has given to us that shouldn't become a priority I believe that job Focus was right because all the rich and everything that God gave to job those things was not attached to him so when the devil attack and took everything he didn't also leave God because why he said the Lord give it and the Lord take it blessed be the name of the Lord every Christian everyone that comes to God you going to be tried and tested sometimes the try gets so hard but don't give up God knows what he's doing he overcome your trials he overcome your Temptations he can bring friction to your marriage and your marriage will be tested your everything will be tested to the core but listen because greater is he that is in you you overcome all those because he overcome he conquered he will conquer for you but when you are going through those things not easy but also shaping you that's why BR preached that all things work together for good to them that love God Amen it's all working together it doesn't matter how it looks chaos like every birth is a mess but what comes out of it is beautiful it's Beauty so that it is so God should be our priority amen regardless nothing should come before you and the Mighty God hallelujah amen hallelujah our God is good and the second one is what love your neighbor as yourself that's the most important thing that's the part we have to do and it's not sometimes it's not easy when some people they get on your Des some people they do everything to get too frustrated but you know when Christ is in you he will help you and love the people anyhow you might get angry sometimes because the scripture said be angry and sin not you might react sometimes but don't look upon that God is looking to your heart so we should love one another and we also should live for one another because as Christ came to live for us so shall we also live for others Christianity is not to live for yourself I'm afraid in this part of the world and the time that you are living in it has become I I alone the people have become selfish just for themselves they don't care about anybody once they will make their money they will do things they don't care even if you going to die that is not their business and no wonder the bra Bram said when it's getting to the end there is not going to be any true love apart from the love of God in the bride not the church churches have all kind of people but the bride of Christ within that confines of that church that's why you going to have a pure love because they are part of God so they can love one another without that you they cannot have it if they are make believers they can't have because it's a love you Satan cannot laugh but God is love and if you are part of God you going to have that pure love but he said the people heart going to be what heartless he said parents against children children against parents brother against things that are going on it is happening right now people are heartless killing doing all kind of wicked things that you can't even Phantom it because listen and God is keeping the this thing because the bride is still around once you live over here it's going to be chaos and I believe that everything's fading Within part of it manifesting right in the eyes people killing even right now last to turn to somebody just a b station they just p p kill him for nothing like people is like you don't know what is going on but the love of God is only within the bride of Christ apart from the true bride of Christ who were ordained before the foundations of the world be Sons and Daughters of God you can never have a true love because so many people that kind of feel love when they do something for you they expecting something back but a true love of God in somebody's heart when he does something he doesn't expect nothing back he doesn't he didn't do it because you do me good I do you good it's good to pay people back when they do you good but when they treat you bad and everything and you can in your heart pray for them and recognize that the devil that is hiding there to attack you you project rejecting that love of God because you are living for them and that's what we are doing in the prayer meeting remember the people in Sodom and gomorra they were wor as wor can be their life do you think Abraham didn't know the life that the sodomite people were living he knew everything but when God approached him and said I'm going to destroy Sodom he interceded for them he oh God if there 50 will you destroy them he said if I found 50 I not destroy Abraham was interceding even though they were wrong as strong can be and so is a bride of Christ we are also doing that in his way do you think what is going on the prayer meeting when people have needs and they come to you and you intered what are you doing you doing exact same thing some of them your friends your family you know the life they are leading maybe you have witnessed to them years and years they won't listen but the love of God In Your Heart Makes You intercede for them when you see they are getting trouble you can't even sleep like Moses Israel was strong strong as strong can be and God wanted to wipe the whole people out and raise the people from Moses he said Lord kill me first he put himself as on the ground interceded for them why it was Christ in Moses so when Christ is in you you will do those things what automatically you don't fight for it or you don't go and read in the Bible and the Bible said I should do that unconsciously you are part of God so you do all those things unconsciously crying for your neighbors crying interceding praying all night for your family member that are sick or suffering you know they are wrong we know they are not listening to you sometimes they even rebel against you but you still love them many ways you can't sleep if they are your children that's the way between us and God so when your kids Rebel and they do things remember your relationship with God before he call you before you became a true we recognize who you really are we were stubborn some of us was were doing all kind of stuff but at that time God ring the eye and like the prodal stand when you recognized who we are and came he wasn't angry he was very happy and gave us the best Cal give us the best protection give us the best D the best of the best that's how God lovees and he make a way for us so our God is is good all the time he good God and he L us more than what we can even think so let's love one another let's intercede for one another let's press on because the thing of fa is like Abraham when God called him he called Abraham alone but Abraham took L took his dad took this and God could not bless Abraham until first his dad died and secondly until he separate himself from lot then God open up the windows and show him what he has in store for him so sometimes if you are not getting your blessings and things are not going on you got to check your life maybe you holding on to something that God wants you to get rid of it because the word of God to call us for total separation from unbelief unbelieving God's word total separation not to separate yourself from one from one another but total separation from everything that is unbelieved to God's word so you have to check and see that you are not holding on to things because God wants us wants separation separate us amen so we got to do that we got to search we got to search our life in the heart and see what this God has installed for us so that we are not hindering our own blessing because sometimes it's our own thing that hinder the blessings but God wants to bless us more he wants to do exceedingly abundantly more than what we can even think or imagine Hallelujah hey amen so what am I saying that we are going through no matter what you are going through that Lily he's always there struggle to help the people just like Naomi and Ruth some people when God called them and they started going through a lot of trials they just give up they don't want to go all the way to the end end like opah but Ruth has that attitude he said that your people will be my people your God will be my God where you sleep there will I sleep amen she went all the way and when she went all the way not only that she was obedient to what to Naomi so it is God to us one time I read this Abraham was so caught up with a love which is the last Capstone he was caught up with love of God that before the seats were open he preached that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is love which love is those fruits that manifest automatically go love with everything but over here let me see okay I'm just want to read this first before I come to where where I okay that's fine yeah over here he said now that's what we were talking the other day the evidence of the Holy Ghost see in in broken system 64726 e now that's what we was talking the other day the evidence of the Holy Ghost see the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the word not some system but have a clear understanding how do you know the word is clear understand it watch it vindicate itself well you say I see this do it and that oh yes we live the same way see but it's got to be the entire word to be the bride you have to be part of him he is the word and what part of him is it the word that is Promised for this day when he calls his bride be a part of that um be a part of that you get it Hallelujah and then over here said Jesus said never said when the Holy Ghost come you speak with thums he never said the Holy Ghost come you do any of those things but he said he will take these things of mine and show them to you and will show you things that to scam there is a genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost According To Jesus himself so the Gen evidence to recognize what God is doing for your day and what go leave it and if you recognize that in that package you automatically love your enemies and pray for those that hate you because love is part of the package so what I'm trying to say that token said that total obedience to the word of God entitles you to what the token so what Naomi was doing was that he was being obedient to Naomi Ruth was being obedient to Naomi when she told her to go and what um in the field to glean she obeyed she didn't she didn't resist she didn't say that oh I was a princess back in uh Moab you expect me to go and glean in the field when there's nothing and it was even shame for her to do that but she obeyed that word of God and I know it's a gleaning tie but God want us to also witness anyhow he said gleaning but he wants us to and remember Noah preach for 120 years he only got eight people of his family so Naomi Ruth was obedient to Naomi and even when he was giv the instructions to go and sleep by the feet of uh boas that was like a disgrace could be like like a prute doing that but she's she OB obeyed so what I'm trying to say that obedience to the full word of God entitles you to the token and if you love God you obey his Commandments it's simple as as simple as that so obedience is better than sacrifice and the love of God in you will let you obey God's word it's not going to be a friction because remember When you entered into his rest you are it's no more you it's Christ in you living his life through you is Christ in the bride we have come to rest place that we have come to a place that we are resting on him we recognize that we ourselves we are nothing without him so he is the one riding the train in us he is the one doing everything he is the one Healing The Sick he's the one raising the dead TR he's the one everything that we are doing is not us it's him that is doing it it's not the mountain that is Holy but the Holy Ghost on the mountain that makes it holy it's not the people that's why the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles it wasn't Peter that made the difference but Christ in Peter that makes the difference so he is the one riding the trail and we are resting on that word of God because it's him it's him before we are trying to do things by our own s i can pray this I can do that it's good to pray it's good to fast it's good to do all those things but if he is not in is all in vain you cannot pray one time I was looking for something and I keep on praying and bugging God and bugging God and praying and one time in the morning I had a voice Simon's voice and say that you cannot tell God what to do then I give up but the problem of it is sometimes you want to change God's mind you want to tell God what to do but remember his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts aree than our thought so we have to surrender our ways and our thought to him so that he can have preeminence he can have his perfect way in our lives because once you a son of daughter of God you are never going to have it your own way because you want to go your way is going to go through the hard way and you're still going to turn you around so I want God's way to be my way though the road be rough and steep but he leads me I will go I want God's way way to be my way because his ways is perfect it's clear amen so we have to get to that place and recognize and I believe that the bride of Christ has come to that rest and we know that we know that is not any human being anymore but is God himself doing it so we have to surrender to him so he can have full preeminence amen God is good he's a wonderful God Amen he never changed hallelujah praise God okay so I'm just going to conclude it with Mr Lily again hallelujah hallelujah our god is good amen he's a wonderful ful God amen hallelujah amen hallelujah okay and over here he said what we need today is the Life of Christ inside of us that's what p ifies not the outward a turn around color or a degree of psychology or something or something it takes the power of resurrected Christ to make us what we should be God had no other plan than to let the Holy Spirit Rule and reign in the church chur is the Holy Ghost ruling and reigning in the Church of the Living God a True Church of God is led by the Holy Ghost not by mind not by um bunch of men is led by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost lead it where it listed he can move the church any way he wants the spirit of Christ it has to have the prent and move and do what it wants to do and the children the people that followed it have come to that place that they gave God the preeminence so they become prisoner of Christ you have no not no you don't have your thought anymore the very mind that was in Christ is now in you it's no more your thought it's no more your mind he has taken control of your mind of your actions everything is the mind of Christ is the bright is the the is the bride of Christ today amen so he is the one ruling us we have surrendered to him door to the heart is not only that he has the preeminence only or not only is he Our Savior but he is our Lord and Lord means rulership so he is the one ruling Our Lives he is the one in control over everything we are doing and we are grateful we are thankful that his grace and mercy has brought us thus far amen so I'm just going to conclude over here and thank you for everything amen hallelujah our God is good all the time God is good he has done so much for us so BR Mike and done can come and just bless us with one song to conclude it amen he's a wonderful god so let's love one another regardless of what anyone has done if I've offended
