[23:40] with these young people by the grace of
[23:42] God
[23:44] as they move into their positions in the
[23:47] word of God it's as simple as that
[23:50] a lot of times we often wonder

[23:59] young old me or young me or old me or
[24:03] God has a wonderful plan for each and

[24:27] amen praise God
[24:29] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[24:32] um
[24:34] we sent out a message letting the people
[24:36] know that as a precaution
[24:40] we're asking that
[24:42] everybody wear a mask
[24:45] while in the services
[24:48] okay so just so you know if you know if
[24:52] you don't have it here tonight then you
[24:54] can be prepared for for next time we're
[24:56] just doing it as a precaution through
[24:58] the holiday season
[24:59] we do have some available at the back
[25:02] this covid has been raising its head
[25:06] again
[25:08] and you wonder well you know I'm not
[25:10] worried about it I'm not scared it's not
[25:13] a matter of being worried or scared
[25:15] it's a matter of understanding that in
[25:18] the same way that you can get
[25:22] a cold
[25:23] or you can get
[25:26] kidney disease or cancer or anything
[25:32] that is sickness
[25:34] there's no difference right there's no
[25:37] difference
[25:38] covet is just another dis-ease right
[25:41] it's just another
[25:42] form of sickness and we know that
[25:45] sickness is all of the devil it attacks
[25:50] your your body
[25:51] and it uh and it tries to weaken you in
[25:54] whatever form
[25:56] and uh you know if you're wondering is
[25:59] covet real yeah it is real absolutely I
[26:02] just came out of it for the last two
[26:03] weeks and still having some side effects
[26:06] from it
[26:07] okay
[26:09] um it's something different that I've
[26:10] never experienced before okay it didn't
[26:14] knock me down on my back and completely
[26:16] knocked me out but it has had an effect
[26:20] like just in the last week or so I can't
[26:23] taste things
[26:24] I'm having issues with the taste of
[26:27] everything you know and I was wondering
[26:28] about that and I didn't come to realize
[26:31] I said oh I've heard people say that one
[26:33] of the side effects is that you can't
[26:35] taste things you know for a while you
[26:38] lose your sense of smell your sense of
[26:40] taste and it definitely happened to me
[26:44] you know it's a side effect of that
[26:46] particular virus
[26:49] flu whatever you want to call it
[26:52] so you do need to take precautions if
[26:56] you don't want to have the effects of it
[26:58] my mother used to say hey put your coat
[27:01] on don't go outside without a hat it's
[27:03] winter out there
[27:04] and if you go out there and you start
[27:07] running around you sweat before you know
[27:09] it you're downstairs crying the blues
[27:12] and you got a cold and you're you've got
[27:15] a fever and everything else well those
[27:17] are the effects it's cause and effect
[27:19] right you sow and you reap
[27:22] these are simple things that we need to
[27:24] realize as Christians you know people
[27:26] say oh no plague shall touch me
[27:31] that
[27:33] is fine if you're listen it's like the
[27:37] scripture says that you know that uh uh
[27:39] I'll be uh you know bitten by a serpent
[27:42] and it shall not harm you well if you're
[27:45] walking through the forest
[27:47] and you happen to step on a on a snake
[27:49] and it bites you
[27:51] and you didn't expect it you didn't go
[27:54] after it then you shouldn't fear it
[27:57] it'll do whatever it has to do but it
[27:59] cannot harm you according to the word of
[28:02] God your faith has to be balanced
[28:05] properly
[28:06] you know what I mean you're the freest
[28:08] people on earth
[28:10] but yet if you you know you know tonight
[28:12] we're going to be looking at something
[28:13] here tonight and you know we're in the
[28:16] Christmas season and everything else and
[28:18] and uh we are the freest people and
[28:21] Christmas has a totally different
[28:23] meaning to the Sons and Daughters of God
[28:26] than it does to the rest of the world
[28:29] but it's all in balance and
[28:31] understanding it and living and Walking
[28:33] with God in a way where you can live by
[28:36] faith
[28:37] and allow Grace to operate in your lives
[28:40] amen praise God so we will be taking
[28:44] these precautions until further notice
[28:47] we'll see how long
[28:49] um you know we need to do it we did it
[28:51] over the last couple of years and it was
[28:54] successful
[28:55] we had no breakouts in the church where
[28:59] there was a whole big breakout and all
[29:00] of a sudden the whole half the church
[29:02] got covered like there was in many other
[29:05] institutions and so forth we took
[29:07] certain precautions and they were
[29:09] effective
[29:10] and so we are looking to do the same
[29:13] thing now over this flu season because
[29:16] you know temperatures the weather and
[29:18] everything else makes us more
[29:20] susceptible to these things amen praise
[29:22] God let us move on let us pray as we go
[29:25] to the word of God father
[29:27] we just want to thank you tonight Lord
[29:29] for the balance of the Holy Spirit In
[29:32] Our Lives Lord to walk with you in such
[29:35] a way Lord that we don't have to fear
[29:37] but we ask for wisdom you give it to us
[29:41] and we need to apply it in our lives
[29:44] and Lord tonight we ask your anointing
[29:47] to come and minister to our hearts
[29:50] and to our needs Lord we want to
[29:52] remember all those that are sick and
[29:55] Afflicted Among Us Lord we want to
[29:57] remember our pastor tonight Lord that
[29:59] you would touch him touch his precious
[30:02] wife sister Desiree his children Lord
[30:05] whoever may be affected we pray and ask
[30:09] that your anointing will sweep over
[30:11] their home Lord and raise such a
[30:13] standard that they will be made
[30:15] perfectly whole in the name of Jesus
[30:18] Christ
[30:19] father we commit all the saints and all
[30:21] those that are affected in any way Lord
[30:24] may your spirit just go and minister to
[30:26] their needs we pray we just Commit This
[30:29] service tonight into your hands in Jesus
[30:32] name amen praise God God bless you
[30:35] Saints tonight we're going to be looking
[30:36] at the greatest gift
[30:38] you know we're we're in the Christmas
[30:40] season and
[30:43] um it's it's a wonderful time you know
[30:45] for the world because everybody's you
[30:48] know feeling the joy of Christmas and
[30:50] and it's great you know and it's
[30:52] actually an opportunity for us to shine
[30:55] even more at these times you know
[30:57] because
[30:59] um you can you can talk about Christmas
[31:01] and give them the truth about Christmas
[31:03] you know tell them about the reality of
[31:06] Christmas so let's read our scripture
[31:08] tonight
[31:10] it's from Luke chapter 2.
[31:13] verses 9 to 12.
[31:16] and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[31:19] them and the glory of the Lord Shone
[31:22] round about them
[31:24] and they were sore afraid
[31:26] and the angel said unto them fear not
[31:28] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[31:32] great joy which shall be to all people
[31:36] For unto you is Born This Day in the
[31:39] city of David a savior which is Christ
[31:43] the lord
[31:45] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[31:48] shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling
[31:51] clothes lying in a Manger the Lord had
[31:55] his blessings to his word you may be
[31:56] seated
[31:59] well you know some of the things that we
[32:02] um first of all need to
[32:04] clear up and we're not going to get into
[32:06] a study on this
[32:08] but if anybody is interested
[32:10] you can go to the next slide
[32:13] we want to just you know clear up a few
[32:15] things make certain things clear here
[32:18] because it's the truth
[32:20] in you that has given you the walk with
[32:24] God that you have today
[32:26] it's by you knowing the truth by you
[32:29] experiencing the truth and knowing that
[32:31] he is the Living God but it's good to
[32:35] know certain things that you know
[32:38] separate us and liberate us as children
[32:42] of God as Sons and Daughters of God and
[32:44] one of the things is is that December is
[32:47] winter time in Judea snow is all over
[32:49] Jerusalem and Israel
[32:53] the irony is if Jesus was born in a
[32:55] manger in December he would have
[32:58] possibly frozen to death in the snow
[33:02] besides Shepherds won't be grazing their
[33:05] sheep on Snowy land
[33:09] with their sheep you know up on the
[33:11] Hills that's not when they do it they do
[33:12] it in the springtime
[33:14] that's when they go and graze with their
[33:18] sheep
[33:19] okay so understanding that first of all
[33:24] December is not the time of the birth of
[33:28] Jesus
[33:29] now the world celebrates it
[33:32] like I said I'm not going to get into
[33:33] the study but I did come across a lot of
[33:37] really good information in the form of a
[33:40] of a packet of information
[33:42] that brother Ron malabel
[33:46] uh in in the Philippines he's a he's a
[33:50] pastor of a church out there that does a
[33:53] lot of great work and research in
[33:56] developing and putting together
[33:58] information
[34:00] Powerpoints and in from his package on
[34:03] that's where I got some of this
[34:05] information
[34:06] are very useful if you want to know
[34:08] about the history of Christmas
[34:11] so you can send me a text message you
[34:13] can send me an email and I'll send it
[34:15] right to you it's it's great reading it
[34:18] gives you the full history on you know
[34:21] how December was actually you know a
[34:25] time that that it's it's a pagan holiday
[34:27] it was something that was established
[34:30] way back in the early you know 300s and
[34:34] uh they you know they they would have
[34:35] big festivals in the month of December
[34:39] um those you know five six days leading
[34:41] up to the 25th of December which you
[34:44] know ends up being the longest day of
[34:46] the year and and you know certain things
[34:48] that where the sun you know comes out
[34:52] um
[34:52] and they worshiped the Sun and there's a
[34:56] lot of pagan
[34:57] rituals around it okay I won't get into
[35:00] the details but if you are interested in
[35:02] it then I'd be happy
[35:04] to provide it to you
[35:07] Jesus was actually born in April when we
[35:11] celebrate Easter
[35:13] okay it's good for us to understand
[35:16] the importance of you know the the
[35:19] timing of things because it makes more
[35:21] sense to us understanding that you know
[35:24] Lambs are born in the spring that's when
[35:28] Lambs are born Jesus was the Lamb of God
[35:30] that takes away the sins of the world
[35:32] Amen and the greatest gift that we
[35:35] received through his birth was the gift
[35:39] of salvation
[35:42] brother Brahm says here our Lord was
[35:44] born in April
[35:46] but he wasn't born in December if you've
[35:49] been in Judea in December it's colder
[35:51] than this sheep are not born in December
[35:55] anyhow sheep are born in the spring
[35:59] praise God
[36:00] so let's read the next scripture or the
[36:03] the next um quote here brother Bram
[36:06] speaking
[36:07] in God's wrapped gift
[36:11] that's the only way anybody in the world
[36:14] will ever know what's in that package
[36:17] it has to be revealed to you
[36:21] you'll turn it down say it's it's
[36:23] fanaticism but when you get the
[36:26] Revelation you'll seek for it you'll
[36:29] open up and God will come in and sup
[36:32] with you and you with him when you're
[36:35] ready to open the door let him in that
[36:39] little package Knocking at Your Heart
[36:42] the greatest Christmas gift was ever
[36:46] given the first one and the greatest one
[36:50] that little package knocking at the
[36:52] heart of man it'll come in and sup
[36:55] you'll never know it until it's revealed
[36:58] to you when it's revealed to you then
[37:02] you'll go to hunting for it
[37:06] praise God Amen you know what a
[37:10] wonderful thing you know we're talking
[37:11] about the greatest gift
[37:13] and this is the thing that that you know
[37:15] we as Sons and Daughters of God we
[37:18] Rejoice around
[37:20] Christ around the worship of Jesus
[37:23] Christ that's what Christmas is all
[37:25] about it's about worshiping Jesus Christ
[37:28] and we don't worship him on a certain
[37:31] day we worship him every day
[37:34] amen praise God let's read our scripture
[37:38] from Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8.
[37:42] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[37:45] and not of yourselves it is the gift of
[37:50] God
[37:51] salvation nor not of Works lest any man
[37:54] should boast
[37:56] this gift that God has given us is not
[38:00] something that we deserved
[38:04] it's not something that you know that we
[38:07] decided oh you know what I'm gonna I'm
[38:10] gonna accept Jesus Christ uh you know
[38:12] the birth of Jesus Christ it's Christmas
[38:15] oh I should be going to church now you
[38:18] know when I was when I was you know
[38:20] living as a Roman Catholic you know we
[38:22] would go to church a couple times a year
[38:25] Christmas and Easter right and we
[38:28] figured well if we did that then you
[38:30] know that would justify our salvation
[38:33] well salvation is not something that you
[38:37] can earn
[38:39] salvation is not something that you can
[38:41] get because of works because of what you
[38:44] do
[38:45] it's not because of what you do it's
[38:47] because of what he has done
[38:51] next
[38:53] brother Brown speaking here in the
[38:55] Hebrews series Grace is what God did for
[39:00] me
[39:01] works is what I do for God
[39:05] you see God gave you a revelation of
[39:09] your salvation
[39:10] if there was any greater gift that God
[39:13] could have given you he would have given
[39:15] it to you
[39:17] but that great gift was the gift of
[39:20] knowing that you are an attribute of God
[39:22] that you are a son of God that you were
[39:25] not born into this world to some humans
[39:29] and that your life begins and it'll last
[39:32] for just so many years and then you die
[39:34] and then you get put into a grave you
[39:37] were given the Revelation that you were
[39:39] with God that you were a Son of God a
[39:42] daughter of God before you came to this
[39:45] world
[39:47] and the gift is the revelation of
[39:50] knowing who you are
[39:52] praise God grace is what God did for me
[39:55] works is what I do for God now they'll
[39:58] make a Doctrine out of it they think
[40:00] that works is what wins your merits if
[40:04] it is it isn't a free gift
[40:08] remember you don't deserve
[40:11] anything
[40:13] as a human being we're born in sin
[40:16] shaped in iniquity speaking lies there's
[40:19] nothing good that we can do I mean we
[40:22] can do lots of good works and so forth
[40:25] here in this world
[40:27] but it's all temporary
[40:29] it has no
[40:32] eternal
[40:34] end
[40:36] or or or beginning
[40:38] it has no reward
[40:41] other than pride and and fame and Legacy
[40:45] what good is that going to do
[40:48] people are forgotten after a few years
[40:50] they're forgotten once they're gone
[40:54] but God never forget Grace is what God
[40:57] did for you by Grace you're saved
[41:02] and works is what you do in appreciation
[41:05] of Grace
[41:07] that he showed to you and if you love
[41:10] him you like to do the works of the Lord
[41:12] certainly because then you you love him
[41:17] you see
[41:19] that's the beauty of this relationship
[41:21] with God
[41:22] when you've truly come into a
[41:24] relationship with God you're serving him
[41:27] because you love him
[41:29] because you've experienced his love in a
[41:33] way like nobody else could experience
[41:35] love to you
[41:36] you just go back and think about your
[41:39] salvation and when you were a first
[41:42] awakened to the understanding of who you
[41:44] really were and that God was a reality
[41:48] and you experienced his love it's the
[41:51] kind of Love Saints listen I can't even
[41:53] describe it you have to know it by
[41:56] experience that's the only way that you
[41:59] can truly understand
[42:01] this uh this revelation of the love of
[42:04] God in your lives and in your hearts for
[42:07] you to live for God and to love him and
[42:09] to serve him because you love him
[42:12] it's not something that that you can
[42:14] explain I can't explain it to you
[42:17] but you understand if you have
[42:19] revelation of it
[42:23] next
[42:25] so we're just looking at things here
[42:28] in order to to you know kind of look
[42:31] into how it is that we experience this
[42:34] gift
[42:35] how are we living out this gift how is
[42:39] this gift that God has given us how is
[42:41] it being expressed in our lives
[42:44] because remember God is his own
[42:46] interpreter
[42:47] God has given us something God is is
[42:50] revealing more and more of himself as we
[42:54] walk with God more and more of himself
[42:57] in Mark 16
[42:59] it says he that believeth
[43:02] and is baptized shall be saved but he
[43:06] that believeth not shall be damned he
[43:08] that believeth
[43:10] you know like people say oh I want to be
[43:13] baptized
[43:15] well why are you being baptized
[43:19] and then you go to them and you say so
[43:20] how did you want to be baptized well you
[43:23] know in the name of the father and the
[43:25] son and of the Holy Spirit
[43:27] in the name of the father and the son
[43:29] and of the Holy Spirit
[43:31] well are they believing truth
[43:35] so how can
[43:37] they actually
[43:39] experience the true meaning of the gift
[43:43] of Salvation when truth is not the
[43:46] foundation
[43:48] of the gift
[43:50] everybody's out there by works all
[43:53] they're they're they're they're getting
[43:55] out their list and they're making their
[43:57] list and you know of all the gifts that
[43:59] they've got to give to all the people
[44:00] that they know and they don't want to
[44:02] miss anybody because if they miss
[44:04] somebody then then they're not going to
[44:06] be loved in the same way
[44:08] you see it's all by works it's all
[44:10] without faith and all without revelation
[44:13] of what it is and what is the true gift
[44:16] and what is the true gift that you can
[44:19] give others
[44:22] Romans 8 30 says moreover whom he did
[44:25] predestinate them he also called and
[44:28] whom he called them he also Justified
[44:31] and whom he justified them he also
[44:35] glorified
[44:36] amen do you see the difference
[44:40] do you see that that that that this is
[44:43] not a gift that you can work up and get
[44:47] and deserve but this is something that
[44:50] God has done he saw you from before the
[44:53] foundations of the world he knew that
[44:56] you would be an attribute in this time
[44:58] and in this season and that you would be
[45:01] manifesting his word
[45:03] and so he prepared you for this time he
[45:07] prepared you to the point where he
[45:08] justified you
[45:10] that when you would come to him and
[45:12] receive that gift that greatest gift you
[45:16] would know that it's not something that
[45:18] he's going to take back from you
[45:21] you knew that that this was something
[45:23] real
[45:24] that all your unbelief all the sin that
[45:28] had a hold of you and had control over
[45:30] your life all the all the traditions of
[45:34] this world and all the things that had a
[45:37] hold of you he knew that you needed to
[45:39] be released from those things that you
[45:41] would need to be set free from those
[45:43] bondages that your mind would need to be
[45:46] liberated and and set free so that you
[45:49] could truly worship Christ
[45:52] it's Christmas time it's always
[45:55] Christmas time for the Sons and
[45:56] Daughters of God we worship him because
[46:00] of the Revelation that he's given us to
[46:03] know who we are that we are Justified
[46:05] that we're Sanctified that there's no
[46:08] more anything that you need to do he's
[46:11] doing it for you
[46:14] he's he's revealing himself more and
[46:17] more every day as you walk with him
[46:19] liberating you to serve him and and to
[46:23] serve him with passion
[46:25] amen praise God
[46:29] Justified
[46:30] now next
[46:32] slide arminianism is is you know when
[46:36] people think that they've got to do
[46:37] Works in order to to be justified now
[46:40] works are fine but they don't save you
[46:44] you're not saved by works
[46:47] people need to understand that people
[46:49] you know a lot of people that that are
[46:52] that are you know very religious they
[46:54] think they got to do the Rosemary they
[46:56] got to do their their their Hail Marys
[46:58] they got to do 10 our fathers they got
[47:00] you see it's all doctrines and and and
[47:03] traditions of man
[47:06] it's not what God requires
[47:09] works are fine but they don't save you
[47:12] they don't make you perfect it is Christ
[47:15] or perish
[47:17] and it is not even Christ and works
[47:22] it is Christ Alone
[47:25] this age began the years of arminism
[47:28] that does not believe in Christ as the
[47:32] reality it does not sing of nothing but
[47:35] the blood for it sings of nothing but
[47:38] the blood and my own conduct
[47:41] that's not what it's about
[47:43] this is nothing but the blood Saints
[47:46] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[47:49] this great gift that God has given you
[47:52] it comes through the blood it comes
[47:55] without cost it comes without price it's
[47:58] not based on what you do now I believe
[48:00] in Good Conduct if you are saved you
[48:04] will do righteously you will have a
[48:06] desire to do what's good you'll have a
[48:08] desire to do what's right we've already
[48:11] gone over that but let me tell you now
[48:13] salvation is not Jesus Plus
[48:18] no sir it is all about Jesus himself
[48:22] next slide says James 2 17 to 26 even so
[48:27] faith if it hath not works is dead being
[48:32] alone
[48:33] because faith has to express itself
[48:36] through your life
[48:38] through your experience through your
[48:41] vocal uh uh descriptions through your
[48:45] ways of communicating
[48:47] faith is expressed in many different
[48:50] ways
[48:51] yea a man may say thou has faith and I
[48:55] have Works show me thy faith without thy
[48:58] works and I will show thee my faith by
[49:01] my works
[49:02] thou believest that there is one God
[49:04] thou do as well
[49:07] the Devils also believe and tremble
[49:10] so it's not just saying I believe
[49:13] it's knowing that you know that you know
[49:19] but will thou know o vain man that faith
[49:21] without works is dead
[49:25] so to say I believe you know like a lot
[49:28] of people say oh you know I've never
[49:30] done anything wrong in my life I've
[49:31] never heard anybody and you know and and
[49:34] they want to justify that you know that
[49:36] they're going to heaven because of works
[49:39] it's got nothing to do with works
[49:41] it's got to do with the fact that you
[49:43] are an attribute of God
[49:46] your name was written in the Lamb's Book
[49:49] of Life from before the foundations of
[49:52] the world and in a certain time and
[49:55] season your name was going to be called
[49:58] through the word of God for this day in
[50:01] this hour
[50:03] your ability to recognize the word is
[50:06] your ability to respond to the word in
[50:10] your day
[50:12] it's you actually saying my name has
[50:15] been called when you can say Amen to the
[50:18] word of God for your day
[50:22] listen to brother Brown he says now
[50:23] works will never take the place of faith
[50:27] in God for our salvation
[50:31] but works will show forth our faith
[50:34] already placed in him you see we've
[50:39] we've we're justified in Christ
[50:43] we're Justified because of him saying we
[50:47] are Justified
[50:48] he said it we believe it
[50:52] so we're Justified because the
[50:54] revelation of justification has been
[50:56] revealed to us in our hearts
[51:00] and there's no and the Gates of Hell
[51:02] cannot Prevail against that revelation
[51:05] you're free you're Justified and you
[51:08] know it
[51:10] God good works won't save you but they
[51:13] will come forth out of a saved life as
[51:16] fruit unto the Lord
[51:20] we serve the Lord we come to church we
[51:23] we pay our tithes we give our offerings
[51:27] not because we have to
[51:30] not because it's a part of the
[51:33] requirement of the church
[51:35] in order to be a member of the church no
[51:39] it's because we recognize that we are
[51:42] sons of God
[51:44] and that God placed us here
[51:47] Earth
[51:49] I don't know about you but we're still
[51:50] in these human bodies over here
[51:52] and we need to exist in these human
[51:54] bodies we need to operate in these human
[51:56] bodies we need to operate under this
[51:58] realm we need to have a roof over our
[52:01] head those lights that you see shining
[52:03] down they're they're they're they're
[52:05] they're clocking right now and every
[52:07] every few minutes it's adding to our
[52:10] bill at the end of the month and that
[52:13] bill needs to be paid
[52:15] it's all part
[52:17] of our experience as Sons and Daughters
[52:20] of God here on Earth
[52:22] but it's God that gave us this place
[52:25] it's God that gives us the money
[52:28] to provide and make the payments for
[52:31] this house of worship
[52:34] you see the Revelation is that it's God
[52:36] that gives to us
[52:39] that gives us the ability
[52:41] to live and to manifest Financial
[52:45] blessings in our lives
[52:47] your financial blessings come as a
[52:50] result of your revelation of Jehovah
[52:53] Jireh knowing that God is your provider
[52:58] when you get to that place you'll be
[53:01] walking a different kind of walk you
[53:03] will have a different kind of
[53:05] expectation in your lives God will never
[53:09] forsake you God will never leave you God
[53:13] will never allow his children to to be
[53:16] begging bread
[53:17] that's the word of God
[53:20] and that's who we are we are the word
[53:23] being manifested in this day in this
[53:26] hour knowing that God is our provider
[53:29] God is Jehovah Jireh he will provide all
[53:33] of our needs
[53:35] it's not going to be because of my works
[53:38] that I'm gonna that I'm gonna make more
[53:40] money
[53:43] but it's because of Revelation that God
[53:46] has given me that I need to work
[53:50] and if I sow I'm going to reap according
[53:53] to the word
[53:55] not according to Danny's ability
[53:58] all the gifts that you have that God has
[54:02] given you to to to uh to to build
[54:05] Financial wealth
[54:08] those are gifts that God has given you
[54:10] and you need to exercise those gifts
[54:14] as you receive the revelation of the
[54:17] gift of prosperity in your life
[54:20] you will automatically manifest it in
[54:23] your works
[54:25] so if you want to be successful and you
[54:28] have an understanding of sowing and
[54:30] reaping you're not going to go into work
[54:33] and you're not going to turn around to
[54:34] the boss and say hey
[54:36] I need a raise
[54:38] what's the matter with you don't you
[54:40] know I work hard
[54:43] what kind of a boss are you you should
[54:45] be ashamed of yourself you're not paying
[54:47] me enough
[54:49] you can be out of a job a lot quicker
[54:52] than you're going to be in a job
[54:55] you see understanding that that that God
[54:59] gives you a job God provides for you
[55:05] then you are not going to be there
[55:08] going against the grain
[55:12] you're there to work you're there to be
[55:15] a blessing to that business
[55:17] you have the anointing of Joseph on your
[55:20] life
[55:21] as a son or a daughter of God that
[55:24] wherever you go you prosper
[55:27] that's the Revelation that you should
[55:29] have
[55:30] and so when you go to work and you go to
[55:32] work for somebody it's not him that's
[55:35] the boss
[55:36] it's him that holds a position and a
[55:39] certain level of authority but God is
[55:42] the boss God is the one that's paying
[55:45] you through that boss
[55:47] through that company it is your position
[55:51] to get in there and to do and to give
[55:54] all that you possibly can in order to
[55:57] benefit the business
[56:00] and when you do your best when you when
[56:03] you go in and you and you and you focus
[56:06] on what you're getting paid for and do
[56:09] it to the best of your ability you will
[56:12] get raises you will get promotions you
[56:15] will get moved on to other possible uh
[56:18] companies and careers and opportunities
[56:21] because it's God
[56:24] that giveth
[56:26] and it is God that taketh
[56:30] it's as simple as that
[56:33] so see how it works can be different
[56:36] when you have a revelation
[56:39] that it is
[56:40] You by faith being led by the spirit of
[56:44] God knowing that he is the one that's
[56:47] that's providing all the opportunity for
[56:50] you
[56:51] he opens the doors he shuts the doors
[56:56] I believe in good works even if a man is
[56:59] not saved he ought to do good works and
[57:02] do the best he can yes sir if you're a
[57:05] Christian you are doing you are going to
[57:07] do what is right
[57:10] your Works will show that your heart is
[57:13] right
[57:15] and it won't be something that you put
[57:17] on for you will do his will when no one
[57:21] but God sees you
[57:27] you don't have to worry about
[57:29] the boss seeing you
[57:31] but be aware of God seeing you God
[57:35] overshadowing you God opening the doors
[57:39] around you God shutting the doors around
[57:41] you God moving on your your boss to give
[57:44] you a raise God moving uh in your home
[57:47] to bless your children God moving in
[57:50] your family to to open their
[57:52] understanding and and to give them the
[57:55] understanding of this wonderful gift
[57:56] that God has placed in you
[57:59] amen God sees you and you will do his
[58:03] will even if it costs you your life
[58:10] next slide and Jesus
[58:13] come to do was to get these
[58:17] all Jesus come to do was to get these
[58:20] that the father foreknew and
[58:22] predestinated them before the
[58:24] foundations of the world to become Sons
[58:27] and Daughters of God
[58:30] the whole purpose of the whole Plan of
[58:33] Salvation the whole purpose of Christmas
[58:38] because remember it's all surrounding
[58:40] the birth of Jesus Christ
[58:43] but it's not so much his birth it was
[58:45] more about his death
[58:47] about him dying for your sins his birth
[58:50] has a great significance in that he
[58:53] became flesh
[58:56] in order to take our place as a human
[58:59] being so that we could receive salvation
[59:01] from this human dimension
[59:05] remember he didn't have to do that
[59:09] he didn't have to do that but because of
[59:12] his plan and because of his word and and
[59:14] and the whole Plan of Redemption that he
[59:17] he put into motion
[59:19] It produced a Calvary
[59:23] It produced where he had to come but the
[59:26] whole purpose was that he could come and
[59:29] get us
[59:30] redeem us give us that that special gift
[59:34] amen not him that runeth or him that
[59:36] willeth but God that showeth Mercy it is
[59:39] God that does it
[59:42] you can't brag at all there's not a
[59:45] thing that you did
[59:47] God by Grace saved you not you yourself
[59:52] if you do you got something to brag
[59:55] about
[59:56] but you haven't nothing to break
[1:00:00] all Praises go to him
[1:00:03] it's him
[1:00:04] and then he gives you this sure hope
[1:00:07] swore by an oath
[1:00:10] the impossibility for his children to
[1:00:14] ever be lost can you imagine like
[1:00:18] could there be a greater gift than the
[1:00:21] gift of Salvation that once you have
[1:00:23] that revelation of it you can never be
[1:00:25] lost
[1:00:26] your future is clear
[1:00:32] you could be facing listen we all got to
[1:00:35] deal with the conditions and the
[1:00:36] circumstances of this life
[1:00:38] no matter what brother Brian
[1:00:41] right
[1:00:42] we gotta deal with the circumstances the
[1:00:45] situations we got to go through school
[1:00:48] as young people and we got to study and
[1:00:51] we've got to get degrees and we've got
[1:00:53] to go through all those things and I
[1:00:56] know the anxiety used to oh man I
[1:00:58] couldn't take School
[1:01:01] you know like
[1:01:04] I I didn't like exams I don't you know
[1:01:07] like I just that was just me right where
[1:01:10] like everybody's different
[1:01:11] but I know the kind of pressure that you
[1:01:14] young people have to deal with you know
[1:01:16] to get you know uh especially in this
[1:01:19] day in society that we're living in
[1:01:20] where you know you know without without
[1:01:22] a really decent education you know
[1:01:25] there's not much opportunity
[1:01:28] you know
[1:01:31] it's a lot of pressure
[1:01:35] foreign
[1:01:39] sister the whole thing is Grace
[1:01:43] it's all Grace Saints
[1:01:46] you got to deal with these situations in
[1:01:48] your life and all these circumstances
[1:01:50] but let me tell you something grace is
[1:01:53] there for you to get you through it
[1:01:56] Grace will get you through whatever it
[1:02:00] is that you're dealing with right now
[1:02:02] and what you will have to deal with
[1:02:04] tomorrow it's all all of it is Grace
[1:02:08] it's not what you do anyhow it's what
[1:02:12] he's already done for you
[1:02:15] now you can't do one thing to Merit your
[1:02:17] salvation your salvation is a great gift
[1:02:23] Christ became sin that you might become
[1:02:26] righteous
[1:02:29] but then you've got the legalists
[1:02:31] and you've got those that believe oh no
[1:02:33] no no no no I gotta do
[1:02:35] in order to get
[1:02:38] the law the legalists see brother Brown
[1:02:40] speaking here in Hebrews uh you have to
[1:02:43] do this if you don't do this you're not
[1:02:46] a Christian
[1:02:48] and if you don't keep the Sabbath if you
[1:02:51] don't if you eat meat if you do these
[1:02:54] things all these legal ideas you've got
[1:02:58] to go to church if you don't you pay a
[1:03:00] penalty for it you have to do a novena
[1:03:03] that stuff is nonsense
[1:03:07] you're saved by the grace of God by the
[1:03:11] foreknowledge of God by his
[1:03:13] predestination by his predestination not
[1:03:16] saying oh I'm going to save Mike I'm not
[1:03:19] going to save Jack I'm going to save
[1:03:22] David I'm not going to save Jill no
[1:03:26] that's not the way God did it God by his
[1:03:29] foreknowledge
[1:03:30] could predestinate because he knew by
[1:03:33] his foreknowledge that when the word
[1:03:36] would come to his attribute his
[1:03:39] attribute would respond
[1:03:42] he knew that it would say Amen to the
[1:03:46] word of God he knew that you would
[1:03:48] recognize the word for your day
[1:03:52] he knew that you would that that when
[1:03:55] you heard the word and you can't explain
[1:03:57] why it is that you believe this message
[1:04:01] you can't explain something like that
[1:04:04] because it's revelation
[1:04:06] it's given to you
[1:04:09] so by his foreknowledge knowing that his
[1:04:11] attributes he put them out there and he
[1:04:14] didn't put out I'll just put out a
[1:04:16] thousand oh no maybe I'll make it 1200
[1:04:18] or no maybe I'll make it a million or no
[1:04:20] no maybe no he knew exactly how many
[1:04:24] he knew so much that he placed our names
[1:04:27] in a book before we even came here
[1:04:32] in The lab's Book of Life and he knew
[1:04:35] that you would respond and say amen God
[1:04:37] called Abraham by predestination by
[1:04:41] foreknowledge he called he hated Esau
[1:04:44] and loved Jacob before either one was
[1:04:47] born
[1:04:48] you see this is all the gift of God
[1:04:50] there's no greater gift Saints
[1:04:53] this gift of Salvation is something that
[1:04:56] you never deserved we don't deserve it I
[1:04:59] need you this year at Christmas to go
[1:05:01] out there and tell people about this
[1:05:03] gift
[1:05:04] there's no greater gift
[1:05:07] that's right it's God's foreknowledge
[1:05:10] that knows these things
[1:05:13] and so
[1:05:15] why do we need to preach
[1:05:20] you say then what's the use of preaching
[1:05:22] the gospel if God knows everything God
[1:05:24] already knows that you know that that
[1:05:26] you know that you're saved and that
[1:05:28] you're saved that you're lost that
[1:05:30] you're saved if God like then why why
[1:05:33] are we going through this why does
[1:05:34] brother Danny even need to be here
[1:05:36] tonight to preach the word of God
[1:05:39] well listen to what the prophet says
[1:05:41] what's the use of preaching the gospel
[1:05:44] now I'll say this
[1:05:46] I'll say to you this Paul answered that
[1:05:49] or Jesus did rather here's Jesus he said
[1:05:52] the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man
[1:05:55] that went to do this
[1:05:57] a pond or a lake and thrown in the net
[1:06:01] he pulled in out of there he had Turtles
[1:06:05] he had Terrapins he had serpents he had
[1:06:08] lizards he had frogs he had spiders he
[1:06:12] had scavengers and he had
[1:06:14] fish
[1:06:16] genuine fish
[1:06:19] next now the man's just sinning is when
[1:06:24] you take a net and you're just you know
[1:06:26] you put it out there and then you're
[1:06:27] pulling it in you put the nut out and
[1:06:30] then you're pulling it in
[1:06:32] and that's what the preaching of the
[1:06:34] Gospel is I'm preaching the gospel I
[1:06:36] just throw the net as we assemble
[1:06:40] ourselves as we go out there this year
[1:06:42] at Christmas and we start to testify
[1:06:45] about our experience with God our gift
[1:06:49] that God has given us as we're talking
[1:06:51] to the people and as we're telling them
[1:06:54] about God's Great salvation about God's
[1:06:58] foreknowledge about God's election about
[1:07:01] the attributes of God and how that if
[1:07:04] you're a son or a daughter of God you
[1:07:06] always were a son or daughter of God
[1:07:09] it's not by works and by you going to
[1:07:11] church this year at Christmas you know
[1:07:14] those those few days of the year that
[1:07:16] you go to that you go to church that's
[1:07:18] not what the gift is all about that's
[1:07:21] not what salvation is all about as
[1:07:23] you're doing that you're doing the same
[1:07:25] thing you're sinning you're you're
[1:07:27] throwing the net out you don't know
[1:07:29] where God's attributes are gonna raise
[1:07:33] up all all of a sudden you don't realize
[1:07:35] that that they could be right within
[1:07:37] your own household they could be within
[1:07:39] your family they could be at work they
[1:07:41] could be wherever you are
[1:07:44] and as you are experiencing as you're
[1:07:46] talking about this great gift that God
[1:07:49] has given you you are sinning you are
[1:07:51] you are you are uh seen where God's word
[1:07:54] is going to call another attribute and
[1:07:58] give them that that experience that you
[1:08:00] had when you first received the word of
[1:08:03] God
[1:08:05] all that whosoever let him come
[1:08:09] here comes some up at the altar they all
[1:08:11] hang around the altar they pray they cry
[1:08:13] I don't know one from the other we can't
[1:08:17] be I can't be in here saying oh you're
[1:08:18] saved you're not you're saved you're not
[1:08:20] you're saved we can't do that
[1:08:24] that's foolishness
[1:08:26] you know sometimes you get to to
[1:08:28] fellowshipping and you know you get
[1:08:30] talking and oh this brother they ain't
[1:08:32] got the Holy Ghost this sister she
[1:08:34] doesn't have the Holy Ghost this one's
[1:08:36] got the Holy Ghost this what that what's
[1:08:39] that got to do with you
[1:08:41] you got to deal with your own salvation
[1:08:43] with fear and trembling
[1:08:46] just love them be there for them
[1:08:48] fellowship with them pray with them
[1:08:52] everybody's got a portion of faith not
[1:08:54] everybody is going to have the same you
[1:08:57] know portion of Faith everybody's got
[1:08:59] different portions not everybody has the
[1:09:02] same part in the body
[1:09:04] one Revelation is enough to take you in
[1:09:07] the rapture
[1:09:08] because the the Rapture is a revelation
[1:09:12] so it's not about trying to figure out
[1:09:14] who's saved and who's not
[1:09:16] even when you're out there with your
[1:09:18] friends that are in the world
[1:09:20] don't put any interpretation on them
[1:09:24] imagine if they had to put an
[1:09:26] interpretation on you I know that if
[1:09:29] somebody hadn't looked at my life and
[1:09:30] put an interpretation on me 30 years ago
[1:09:33] they would have said no way
[1:09:36] no chance
[1:09:38] that they could possibly be a son of God
[1:09:43] but God had different plans
[1:09:46] God's choices are not our choices
[1:09:49] God's ways are not our ways we leave the
[1:09:53] Salvation up to the Lord
[1:09:56] we leave the giving of the gift
[1:09:59] to the Lord he's the one that gives and
[1:10:02] nobody can take away
[1:10:05] Hallelujah
[1:10:06] so but there's some in there that's
[1:10:09] frogs there's some that's lizards
[1:10:11] there's some that snakes it's some
[1:10:14] that's Turtles and there's some that's
[1:10:15] fish it's not my business to judge I say
[1:10:19] father here's what I pulled out
[1:10:23] Hallelujah
[1:10:25] but the enemy well he's got different
[1:10:27] plans
[1:10:30] Satan is out there
[1:10:32] putting all these doctrines
[1:10:34] telling the people it's all about Santa
[1:10:36] Claus
[1:10:37] it's not about Santa Claus it's about
[1:10:39] Jesus Christ
[1:10:42] you see putting all these lies before
[1:10:44] the people and it all sounds so nice oh
[1:10:48] Santa Claus I'm making a list uh uh you
[1:10:52] know
[1:10:54] making it twice he's checking to see if
[1:10:57] you're naughty or nice I mean it sounds
[1:10:59] all good but it's not the truth
[1:11:02] the the truth is that the true gift is
[1:11:05] Christ and the salvation of of
[1:11:08] your
[1:11:10] attribute being awakened to the
[1:11:13] revelation of Who You Are
[1:11:16] but the enemy
[1:11:18] listen Revelations 13 6 and he opened
[1:11:21] his mouth in blasphemy against God to
[1:11:24] blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle
[1:11:27] and them that dwell in heaven and it was
[1:11:29] given unto him to make war with the
[1:11:32] Saints and to overcome them and power
[1:11:35] was given him over all kindreds and
[1:11:38] tongues and Nations and all
[1:11:42] a l l that dwell upon the Earth shall
[1:11:47] worship Him
[1:11:49] whose names are not written in the Book
[1:11:53] of Life of the lamb slain from before
[1:11:55] the foundation of the world
[1:11:57] so
[1:11:59] all the conditions around us
[1:12:03] and all the commercialization of
[1:12:05] Christmas
[1:12:06] and all the talk of Santa Claus is
[1:12:08] coming to town and all these things it's
[1:12:11] all a great big deception
[1:12:15] but it's not that we're going to go out
[1:12:16] there and we're going to blast the
[1:12:18] people and tell them about you know oh
[1:12:20] you're you're deceived you know
[1:12:22] Christmas you know your Christmas tree
[1:12:25] it's of the devil you know doing this
[1:12:27] and doing that no it's not
[1:12:30] it's paganism
[1:12:32] okay
[1:12:33] and people that are not Sons and
[1:12:35] Daughters of God that are just living in
[1:12:38] this world this is their Paradise that's
[1:12:41] their Joy
[1:12:43] that's their celebration
[1:12:45] that's their experience
[1:12:48] it's not up to us to go and condemn them
[1:12:51] when that's what they know and that's
[1:12:53] what they believe
[1:12:56] it's up to us to live the faith and the
[1:12:59] Salvation And the gift of God that's
[1:13:01] been given to us and to be a light and
[1:13:04] an example of his love
[1:13:06] and to show his grace
[1:13:09] remember it's by grace that you were
[1:13:12] saved it's not of your works
[1:13:15] so it's not because of their works that
[1:13:18] they're lost
[1:13:20] it's not because of their works that
[1:13:22] they're lost
[1:13:23] it's because of unbelief
[1:13:26] once salvation comes and once it's
[1:13:29] revealed to them the truth about Jesus
[1:13:32] Christ about the true worship of Christ
[1:13:35] that Christmas is the worship of Jesus
[1:13:39] Christ it's not about worshiping lights
[1:13:42] and trees and and and festivals and
[1:13:45] celebrations although we can do those
[1:13:48] things
[1:13:49] I want to celebrate with my family at
[1:13:52] Christmas but when we sit down to eat we
[1:13:55] pray
[1:13:57] and my family knows it
[1:13:59] and and and we pray and we we pray for
[1:14:02] them and we pray and we show the love of
[1:14:05] God and we get we bring gifts
[1:14:07] there's nothing wrong with giving gifts
[1:14:10] when you've got a true revelation of of
[1:14:13] of giving it's a wonderful thing it's
[1:14:16] more blessed to give than it is to
[1:14:18] receive
[1:14:19] but when it's being done by tradition
[1:14:22] and being done because you think that
[1:14:24] that that that's the true Christmas then
[1:14:28] you're missing out on the greatest gift
[1:14:36] listen
[1:14:38] we're concluding now brother Bram says
[1:14:40] so I appreciate all your prayers and by
[1:14:44] God's help and Grace a very Merry
[1:14:47] Christmas to every one of you remember
[1:14:49] my saying this is not Santa Claus this
[1:14:53] is Jesus
[1:14:56] you see Christmas Means Christ
[1:14:59] and we're writing last night showing the
[1:15:03] kitties all the houses decorated and
[1:15:05] everything which is awful nice brother
[1:15:08] Branham would take his kids show them
[1:15:10] the Christmas lights the kids would love
[1:15:12] it
[1:15:13] I've been to some light shows and some
[1:15:16] Christmas light you know extravaganzas
[1:15:19] I'm sure you've you've seen them out
[1:15:21] there they're beautiful they're amazing
[1:15:24] you know the the manger scene and and
[1:15:27] the three kings and and the way they can
[1:15:30] you know is put out all those lights
[1:15:31] that's a great Revelation to you when
[1:15:34] you're looking at that you're seeing it
[1:15:36] for what it really is
[1:15:38] you're seeing the revelation of those
[1:15:41] three kings
[1:15:42] that they were being led by the spirit
[1:15:44] of God to go and meet with Jesus Christ
[1:15:49] you see the revelation of the of a child
[1:15:51] being born in a manger God hiding
[1:15:54] himself in Simplicity he could have come
[1:15:56] and he could have come with with a host
[1:15:58] of angels come to the Earth and
[1:16:00] announced his coming in a supernatural
[1:16:02] way but he did it as a gift to the world
[1:16:07] in a child
[1:16:09] wrapped in swaddling cloths
[1:16:13] Christmas Means Christ and we were
[1:16:15] riding last night and the kitties all
[1:16:18] houses decorated everything which is
[1:16:20] awful nice but I thought if I ever had
[1:16:22] on anything on my house that I ever
[1:16:26] wanted to write would be a neon sign
[1:16:29] trusting Christ will be in your
[1:16:33] Christmas
