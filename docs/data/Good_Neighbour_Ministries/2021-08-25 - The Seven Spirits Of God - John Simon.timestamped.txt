[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening friends
[0:16] once again we're happy to be in the
[0:19] house of the lord
[0:21] giving him all praise honor and glory
[0:25] amen
[0:26] here we are
[0:28] on another wednesday evening
[0:31] to spend a delightful time
[0:35] in the presence of our lord jesus
[0:38] amen
[0:40] let me read our scripture
[0:43] revelation
[0:45] chapter 3
[0:47] verse 1
[0:49] these things saith he
[0:53] that had the seven spirits
[0:57] of god
[0:58] and seven stars
[1:01] my topic for tonight will be
[1:04] the seven spirits of god
[1:07] may this bless your heart and your soul
[1:11] god bless you so much
[1:14] and
[1:15] may he share his grace upon us
[1:18] as we go into the storehouse
[1:21] and
[1:23] unlock the
[1:24] marvelous
[1:26] unsearchable treasures
[1:28] of the riches of god
[1:31] amen praise god
[1:34] as in the other ages
[1:37] here we are presented
[1:40] with the beautiful
[1:42] uh
[1:43] picture of christ himself
[1:46] the lord jesus
[1:49] is presenting himself
[1:52] and revealing himself to his own
[1:55] his beloved wife
[1:57] his church
[1:59] praise god hallelujah
[2:02] he sets forth his
[2:05] marvelous
[2:06] attributes while standing
[2:10] in the midst of the church of god
[2:15] and we know
[2:17] that
[2:18] he holds in his hands the seven star
[2:22] messengers
[2:23] that he has used through the seven
[2:28] church ages
[2:30] hallelujah
[2:32] now this phrase
[2:35] that we have just read
[2:38] about the seven spirits of god
[2:43] are found in the book of revelation
[2:47] at least
[2:49] four times
[2:50] mentioned
[2:53] would you like to place this in your
[2:56] notebook
[2:57] if not remember them
[3:00] revelation
[3:02] chapter 1 verse 4
[3:06] from the seven spirits which are before
[3:08] the throne
[3:10] revelation 3 1
[3:13] these things said he
[3:15] that hacked this seven spirits
[3:18] revelation 4 5
[3:21] and out of the throne
[3:24] proceeded
[3:25] lightnings thunders
[3:28] thunderings and voices
[3:30] and there were seven lamps as a fire
[3:34] burning before the throne
[3:36] which are
[3:38] the seven
[3:39] spirits
[3:40] of god
[3:42] revelation 5 6
[3:44] and i beheld
[3:47] and lo
[3:48] in the midst of the throne and of the
[3:52] four beasts
[3:54] and in the
[3:56] midst of the elders
[3:59] a lamb
[4:01] as it had been slain
[4:03] with seven horns
[4:07] and seven eyes
[4:10] which
[4:11] are the seven spirits
[4:14] of god
[4:15] set forth into all
[4:18] the earth
[4:21] now of course
[4:23] these verses are not contrary in any way
[4:27] to the word of god for we know
[4:29] the lord god is one lord
[4:33] but here now we have the mentioning
[4:36] of
[4:37] seven spirits
[4:40] of the living god
[4:42] well god is one spirit
[4:45] first corinthians
[4:47] 12
[4:48] 8
[4:49] to 11.
[4:51] here we find
[4:53] one spirit of god manifesting himself
[4:58] in nine different ways
[5:01] with the nine gifts of the spirit of
[5:04] almighty god
[5:06] so when we say seven spirits of god
[5:10] seven is the number of course of
[5:12] perfection
[5:14] perfections of god
[5:16] seven spirits it means it's the one
[5:21] and the same
[5:22] spirit manifesting himself
[5:26] in seven ways
[5:29] seven fall ways
[5:31] glory to god
[5:34] now notice carefully the designations
[5:38] in revelation chapter 4
[5:41] verse 5 note carefully
[5:44] these seven spirits
[5:46] are also called laps
[5:49] of fire
[5:51] lamps of fire burning before the lord
[5:56] well you know john always used old
[5:59] testament symbols
[6:01] uh as uh he might may have used the
[6:05] symbolism
[6:06] of the golden candlestick with the seven
[6:09] branches
[6:11] in the temple
[6:12] lamps
[6:14] of fire burning lamps of fire
[6:18] and when we go to proverbs 20 verse 27
[6:22] remember i repeat proverbs 20 verse 27
[6:29] the spirit of man
[6:32] is the lamp
[6:34] of the lord
[6:36] i repeat
[6:38] the spirit of man
[6:40] is the lamp
[6:42] of the lord
[6:44] now so we now find that these seven
[6:47] spirits
[6:49] are associated with man
[6:53] god doing something
[6:56] with man
[6:58] john the baptist in john chapter 5
[7:04] verse 35
[7:06] he was called
[7:08] that he was a burning and a shining
[7:11] light
[7:11] to the glory of god hallelujah
[7:15] and again revelation chapter 5
[7:19] verse 6
[7:21] the seven spirits of god
[7:24] are also identified
[7:27] as seven eyes
[7:32] in zechariah
[7:34] 4 10
[7:35] zechariah 4 10
[7:38] for who had despised the day of small
[7:42] things for they shall rejoice
[7:47] and shall see the plummet in the hand of
[7:50] the rubble bell
[7:52] amen with those seven
[7:56] they are the eyes
[7:59] of the lord
[8:01] now it is very clear and evident to us
[8:05] that
[8:06] these words
[8:08] refer to men seven men who would be the
[8:12] eyes of the lord
[8:15] in the earth
[8:16] manifesting
[8:19] seven fall glory
[8:21] seven attributes
[8:23] seven manifestations
[8:25] of this spirit
[8:28] of the living god or the holy spirit
[8:32] amen
[8:34] we see the eyes of the lord and these
[8:36] men
[8:37] of course there will have to be men
[8:40] full of the holy ghost
[8:42] anointed use
[8:45] of him
[8:47] amen
[8:48] and their ministries
[8:50] will have to be a manifestation
[8:54] of god
[8:55] revealing his divine power
[8:59] glory to his holy name
[9:02] now friends
[9:04] putting our scriptural discoveries
[9:07] together
[9:09] it is evident
[9:11] that these seven spirits of god
[9:14] refer to the continuous
[9:17] ministry
[9:18] continuous or continual ministry
[9:23] of the holy spirit
[9:25] through the various
[9:27] ages in the lives of seven men
[9:32] which whom god
[9:35] ha will
[9:36] and has
[9:38] identified himself with them
[9:41] closely
[9:43] so that anyone could recognize
[9:46] no man can do these miracles except god
[9:51] be with him
[9:52] no man
[9:54] can say these things and put forth these
[9:58] truths except god be in him
[10:02] no man can foretell these things
[10:07] thousands and thousands of times without
[10:11] one mistake except god be with him
[10:17] these seven
[10:18] they are the eyes of the lord that run
[10:22] it swiftly throughout the whole earth
[10:25] god
[10:26] are
[10:27] investigating for the coming judgment
[10:30] amen seeing the events of us of a of an
[10:35] age through the eyes of the messenger
[10:39] god being able to see and observe these
[10:42] things firsthand
[10:44] and using these men
[10:47] as his eyes amen praise be to god
[10:52] they're called his eyes
[10:55] they're called his lamps
[10:58] amen
[10:59] and they're called the seven stars of
[11:02] god hallelujah which we already know
[11:06] represents the seven messengers of
[11:11] revelation one two
[11:13] chapter one two and three in there we
[11:17] see the seven messengers
[11:20] to the seven
[11:22] churches that were in asia minor
[11:26] which was really like a nursery
[11:30] uh to tell us give us an indication
[11:35] of what was to come
[11:38] and what would be made
[11:40] manifest
[11:42] in the ages
[11:45] to come the ages of the church
[11:49] throughout
[11:50] its
[11:51] uh its uh
[11:53] manifestation amen it's existence glory
[11:57] to god hallelujah amen yes sir and so
[12:01] god calls them seven stars
[12:05] which means you know like a star
[12:08] a star gives forth its light
[12:12] by reflecting the light of the sun
[12:16] after that the sun
[12:18] has gone down
[12:20] now you can of course recognize there
[12:23] the star natural reflects the light of
[12:25] the s-u-n
[12:27] after that the s-u-n has gone down
[12:32] and these star messengers of god
[12:35] reflect the light of the word the light
[12:39] of the s-o-n
[12:42] amen back into the church age
[12:45] after
[12:46] that the word seems to have been
[12:49] rejected after that the sun
[12:52] has gone down oh praise god forevermore
[12:57] amen hallelujah so the messenger
[13:01] to each church age
[13:03] is typified or symbolized
[13:07] in the
[13:08] form of a bright
[13:12] and shining star to reflect the light of
[13:16] the sun
[13:17] and they did this all
[13:21] by the power of the blessed holy spirit
[13:26] now what have we learned
[13:29] in those few remarks
[13:32] one
[13:33] we have learned
[13:35] that these men represent
[13:38] the seven spirits of god
[13:42] amen
[13:43] which is the ministry of the continuous
[13:46] ministry of continual ministry
[13:49] of the one holy spirit
[13:51] manifesting himself in seven ways
[13:56] the seven spirits of god man
[14:00] of continuous intercession
[14:03] men who stand in the gap
[14:06] with the word of god
[14:08] declaring it to their age
[14:11] without fear or favor
[14:14] and usually
[14:16] they always go beyond the camp
[14:20] they never stay
[14:22] within the confines of a denomination
[14:25] even if there were in one
[14:28] but like he was crucified beyond the
[14:31] walls of jerusalem
[14:34] so is it his messengers
[14:37] always go beyond the camp
[14:40] to declare
[14:42] the word of god
[14:44] and the voice of god for their age
[14:47] they are also called seven lamps
[14:51] seven laps of revelation
[14:54] to bring light illumination
[14:57] amen to the church age
[15:00] in which they are sent
[15:03] god uses them with that spirit of
[15:06] revelation hallelujah
[15:09] oh my whether it be the just shall live
[15:13] by faith amen or whether it be it shall
[15:18] be light
[15:19] about the evening time
[15:22] and the past the glory you will surely
[15:25] find in the waterway is the light today
[15:30] buried in the precious name of jesus
[15:33] glory be to god hallelujah those seven
[15:37] men
[15:38] god used them as seven lamps to light up
[15:43] their age
[15:44] with the
[15:45] revelation
[15:47] of the abundant truth
[15:49] from the word of god hallelujah amen
[15:54] there also we have learned here they are
[15:56] also called the eyes the seven eyes
[16:03] the eyes of the lord
[16:06] god's seven eyes of discernment
[16:09] hallelujah
[16:11] to discern
[16:12] the spirits of man
[16:15] and to divide between truth and error
[16:18] right and wrong and to point you into
[16:22] god's provided way
[16:25] and directly back to the word of god
[16:29] they were used as i said as god the eyes
[16:33] of the lord
[16:34] speeding through the earth
[16:36] watching observing
[16:38] seeing the nature of the composition the
[16:42] interaction
[16:43] of the age
[16:44] and the people the nature of that age so
[16:50] these eyes
[16:52] eyes of discernment
[16:55] eyes that were used in being able to
[16:58] know what is to be restored after that
[17:02] they had searched out the lost things
[17:05] they could restore back to its original
[17:09] position whatever was out of place
[17:13] whatever was lost
[17:15] it could be restored by these seven men
[17:20] who were the eyes of the lord hallelujah
[17:24] and as i have said before
[17:27] they are also
[17:30] described with the designation
[17:33] of the seven stars of god
[17:36] seven stars of reflection
[17:40] that they can they're reflecting back
[17:43] not their own light for a star has no
[17:46] light of its own
[17:48] it reflects the light of the sun
[17:51] after that the sun
[17:54] has gone down and so god has used these
[17:59] men praise god hallelujah to to be able
[18:03] to declare his word amen
[18:07] and reflect
[18:09] the image
[18:10] the stature
[18:12] of jesus christ
[18:14] the perfect man
[18:16] god
[18:17] that was made manifest and fleshed
[18:21] praise god forevermore i'm so blessed
[18:26] we are so blessed
[18:29] that the last messenger
[18:32] has gone on
[18:34] but he left a storehouse
[18:37] filled with all manner of wonderful food
[18:41] where sons and daughters of god children
[18:45] of the most high
[18:46] can go
[18:48] and satisfy
[18:50] and fill their soul with the glory
[18:53] divine of the goodness and the riches of
[18:58] jesus christ amen hallelujah glory to
[19:02] god
[19:03] now we know
[19:05] the apostle paul
[19:07] was the first messenger
[19:11] as galatians 1 8 says
[19:15] if any angel
[19:18] any messenger of course
[19:20] any viker
[19:23] any
[19:24] no matter who he is
[19:27] any preacher anyone
[19:29] hallelujah
[19:32] if he preaches any other gospel
[19:35] other than what paul preached
[19:39] let him
[19:40] be accursed
[19:42] that is the word of god god puts a curse
[19:46] through the messenger
[19:48] the first messenger the apostle paul
[19:51] of the ephesian church age
[19:54] god places a curse
[19:56] on anyone
[19:58] who preaches anything
[20:01] different than what paul preached
[20:04] amen paul knew
[20:08] that after he left the scene
[20:11] grievous wolves
[20:13] would creep in
[20:15] in the midst of the church
[20:18] there would be demonic invasion
[20:22] in the ranks of the church
[20:24] there will be enticing and seducing
[20:27] spirits
[20:29] under the guise of religion that will
[20:32] come into the church
[20:35] and they will deceive many
[20:40] he knew that satan himself
[20:42] that is paul knew
[20:46] would appear amongst the people as if he
[20:49] is an angel of light
[20:52] or a messenger of god angel
[20:56] messenger of light of god he is
[20:59] presenting himself
[21:01] also
[21:02] that he is a messenger
[21:05] of god
[21:07] and
[21:08] how much more
[21:10] the ministers
[21:12] that he has with him
[21:14] how much more will there they be like
[21:17] that
[21:19] that is why paul warns us
[21:22] that the gospel
[21:24] must always remain the same
[21:28] for god makes no mistakes
[21:31] god does not go correcting and
[21:33] correcting and recorrecting oh i made a
[21:36] mistake so i'll correct this part no
[21:38] the first word is the last word
[21:42] whenever god says anything his word
[21:46] cannot change it cannot lie it cannot
[21:50] pass away it is immutable it is infinity
[21:56] oh praise god his word remains stronger
[22:00] and longer in its existence for his word
[22:04] is the eternal
[22:07] living word of the living god hallelujah
[22:11] amen praise god now we know
[22:16] paul baptized
[22:18] in jesus name
[22:20] and if we are to stay with the word
[22:23] and not to have that curse of god
[22:28] come upon us
[22:29] then we
[22:31] must and should baptize also in the name
[22:36] of jesus christ
[22:38] paul also re-baptized
[22:42] some
[22:42] that were in the bible
[22:45] as you know in the book of acts
[22:48] when they said we know not of this
[22:51] gospel you're preaching of this holy
[22:53] ghost we don't know about this message
[22:56] that you're declaring we never heard it
[22:58] in this fashion before but nevertheless
[23:01] we believe it to be the truth amen and
[23:04] the bible tells us that paul re-baptized
[23:09] them
[23:10] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[23:14] there are millions
[23:16] that are baptized with the wrong baptism
[23:20] for those that baptized them
[23:23] had no revelation
[23:26] of what name they should be baptized in
[23:30] and they were baptized into titles
[23:34] instead of the name
[23:36] of the one who has those titles
[23:40] and the name of the one who has those
[23:43] titles prince of peace wonderful
[23:46] counselor mighty god amen lady of the
[23:49] valley bright my morning star and so on
[23:53] father son holy ghost it's the same lord
[23:57] jesus christ
[23:59] and the name
[24:01] of the father son and holy ghost is one
[24:05] name of one god and his name is jesus
[24:09] christ which in the hebrew is jehovah
[24:14] our savior amen
[24:16] jehovah of the old testament
[24:20] is jesus
[24:22] of the new testament
[24:24] our savior hallelujah praise be to god
[24:29] jesus christ our savior and our beloved
[24:33] lord thanks be to god hallelujah amen
[24:39] paul
[24:41] set the church
[24:42] in order back then
[24:46] for the gifts
[24:47] were going
[24:48] out of whack within the church
[24:52] he set them in order and confirmed
[24:56] that they should remain within the
[24:59] church
[25:01] oh praise god forevermore
[25:04] and they were to remain there
[25:07] until jesus comes back again
[25:11] this promise
[25:12] is unto you
[25:14] unto your children
[25:16] and unto your children's children
[25:18] even as many as the lord jesus christ
[25:21] shall call is god still calling as long
[25:24] as god is still calling these promises
[25:28] are to you this holy ghost is for you
[25:31] these gifts are for you this anointing
[25:34] is for you these truths are for you the
[25:38] word of god for this day stored up left
[25:42] by a servant of god in a golden pot upon
[25:45] the great uh
[25:48] ark of the covenant glory to god that we
[25:51] may receive fresh food in our season and
[25:54] walk in the light of the day praise god
[25:57] forevermore amen yes sir glory to his
[26:01] name we find friends
[26:04] the messengers
[26:06] all remaining
[26:09] all six of them
[26:11] they will say
[26:13] the same of what paul said
[26:16] because they are of the same continuing
[26:19] spirit
[26:20] the same spirit of god from age to age
[26:23] the same
[26:25] god making himself manifest and giving
[26:29] forth the same fire
[26:32] and the same light
[26:34] shining from the throne of the living
[26:38] god
[26:39] and signs will always follow them
[26:43] the power of god will always be with
[26:46] them
[26:47] did irenaeus
[26:50] the great sermon of god
[26:52] did he qualify
[26:55] as a messenger
[26:57] that saint martin
[26:59] qualifying as a messenger
[27:03] that colombo
[27:05] qualify as a messenger
[27:09] did martin luther
[27:11] who spoke in towns
[27:13] amen
[27:14] who prayed for the sick
[27:17] who believed that just shall live by
[27:19] faith
[27:22] does he qualify
[27:24] as a messenger
[27:27] what about john wesley
[27:30] does he qualify
[27:32] as a messenger in his great ministry
[27:36] is known and recorded
[27:39] how that one time
[27:42] uh he was going to preach the gospel
[27:47] and the horse
[27:48] on which he would ride
[27:51] fell sick
[27:53] and stumbled to the ground
[27:56] that's as if you have a car
[27:58] today and you're going to preach the
[28:00] gospel and the car sputters and stops
[28:03] and you don't know what's wrong
[28:05] and you are gonna turn back to go home
[28:08] because your car isn't working but not
[28:11] john wesley
[28:13] when that horse fell down and was not uh
[28:17] was sick
[28:20] wesley anointed the horse with oil
[28:23] laid his hands upon it and in the name
[28:26] of jesus christ
[28:28] oh praise god that horse got up the
[28:31] horse was well and wesley went on his
[28:36] preaching journey his circuit and
[28:38] preached wherever god wanted him to
[28:42] preach hallelujah amen
[28:44] seven stars
[28:46] seven eyes
[28:48] seven laps
[28:50] seven messengers views of gods who were
[28:54] all alike
[28:57] as paul
[28:58] amen
[28:59] and we know
[29:03] paul pronounced
[29:05] a clear curse
[29:07] on anyone
[29:09] regardless of how high profile he is
[29:14] positioned he is
[29:16] or how low he may be
[29:19] that anyone
[29:21] who said anything brought any other
[29:24] different message or differed with what
[29:27] paul preached paul said let him be
[29:31] accursed
[29:32] even if he claims to be an angel from
[29:36] heaven
[29:37] let him be accursed
[29:39] this this curse from the word of god out
[29:43] of the mouth of the apostle paul amen is
[29:46] upon all those amen praise god that
[29:51] tries to preach a different gospel
[29:54] and preach some kind of live some kind
[29:57] of a different life
[29:59] contrary to god's holy word oh my listen
[30:05] in the bible the book of revelation
[30:07] listen what it says revelation 22 18.
[30:12] if any man adds
[30:14] to this book
[30:16] what takes away
[30:18] from this book
[30:20] he would be should be plagued
[30:23] and judged by condemnation of god god
[30:26] said i will add
[30:29] the plagues written in this book upon
[30:32] him
[30:33] or i will take his part out of the book
[30:38] of life
[30:40] amen
[30:41] now friends
[30:44] we see
[30:45] that these seven spirits of god
[30:48] actually
[30:50] speak
[30:51] of the one great holy spirit of god
[30:55] working out god's will and word
[30:59] in
[31:00] different generations different ages
[31:04] age after age but remains the same for
[31:08] instance
[31:09] like the spirit of elijah
[31:12] that god used that anointed elijah
[31:16] and then when elijah left the scene
[31:19] the spirit of the lord
[31:21] came upon elisha
[31:24] with a double portion and used him for
[31:28] the glory of the living god
[31:31] centuries later
[31:34] the same spirit of god which is
[31:36] described as a spirit of elijah
[31:39] came upon john the baptist
[31:41] amen
[31:43] and
[31:44] used him for the glory of god
[31:47] and the bible
[31:49] prophesies
[31:51] that that same spirit
[31:53] was to return in the last days
[31:56] amen and to anoint a man that will be
[32:00] the eye of the lord the lamp of the lord
[32:03] the voice of god the star messenger oh
[32:07] praise god hallelujah god would use him
[32:11] as his eyes of discernment glory to god
[32:15] hallelujah in the last days
[32:19] to fulfill malachi
[32:21] 4 5
[32:23] to fulfill
[32:24] revelation 10
[32:26] 7. he would receive the revelation of
[32:30] god from the mighty angel
[32:33] and reflect it back into the church age
[32:36] that the people might be restored back
[32:39] to the word
[32:40] until to their original place in christ
[32:44] going back where they came from by the
[32:46] holy spirit amen praise god amen so my
[32:51] friends
[32:52] the ministry of that man
[32:55] prophesied of in malachi 4 5
[32:59] spoken of in revelation 10 7
[33:03] or the scriptures are there but we we we
[33:06] emphasize these
[33:08] but i believe
[33:10] that that man
[33:12] was brother william marion branham
[33:17] many differ with him now
[33:19] they have no real
[33:21] uh recognition
[33:24] of who he really
[33:26] was
[33:28] and
[33:29] how he was used
[33:31] why are his peculiar ways
[33:34] why his peculiar ministry why his
[33:38] anointed an astounding
[33:42] miraculous
[33:44] ministry
[33:45] what a ministry of abundant truth
[33:50] being made known through him
[33:53] with a ceaseless
[33:55] flow
[33:56] of the mighty oceans of god's word
[34:00] coming through him the deep calling onto
[34:03] the deep and the deep in the hearts of
[34:06] the elect response to the word of god oh
[34:10] thank god forevermore that his word came
[34:14] to me and i responded his word came to
[34:17] many others and we have responded to the
[34:21] word of god that has filled our hearts
[34:24] with the glory divine oh hallelujah amen
[34:28] praise god jesus and god anointed jesus
[34:32] of nazareth
[34:35] with the holy ghost and power
[34:37] and he went about doing good
[34:40] healing all that were oppressed
[34:43] by the devil hallelujah
[34:47] jesus went away
[34:49] but that same spirit
[34:51] that was upon him
[34:53] came back on the day of pentecost
[34:57] hallelujah you see he went up
[35:00] the body was left on earth to be
[35:02] resurrected but he gave up the holy
[35:05] ghost
[35:07] which went back and then came back down
[35:10] on the day of pentecost to anoint his
[35:14] disciples that believed his word
[35:18] hallelujah oh praise god amen and they
[35:22] went forth
[35:24] and began to do the same works
[35:28] prison doors were open
[35:30] prison
[35:32] houses rocked with the power of the holy
[35:35] spirit
[35:36] lame men walked again
[35:38] oh my the ministry of peter james paul
[35:43] stephen oh many others through the ages
[35:48] used of the living god with this this
[35:51] wonderful power of the holy spirit
[35:54] because jesus before leaving said
[35:58] wait in jerusalem
[36:00] until you receive the promise of the
[36:03] father amen not just the father's
[36:06] promise
[36:07] that the father the promise of the
[36:09] father that he himself will come in you
[36:12] and be with you to sustain you empower
[36:15] you use you and manifest himself through
[36:19] you amen glory to god hallelujah amen
[36:24] and so
[36:25] they went forth with the same spirit
[36:28] as a called out body
[36:30] of the living god
[36:32] amen they went out in his stead and we
[36:36] are to go out in his place in his stead
[36:41] for god's glory and for god's honor amen
[36:45] and that same spirit of course was in
[36:48] them
[36:50] and they will do the same works
[36:52] and any people group or church
[36:57] that that believes
[37:00] that they are truly the body of jesus
[37:02] christ
[37:05] the same
[37:06] supernatural element
[37:09] of the presence of the spirit of christ
[37:13] will manifest itself
[37:15] through them with them in them around
[37:19] them they will have that divine
[37:22] atmosphere that only the holy spirit
[37:25] himself can create by his word
[37:28] hallelujah amen and they will manifest
[37:31] the lord jesus and his works in the same
[37:35] way amen and so a genuine original
[37:40] pentecostal church
[37:42] must be the same way
[37:44] i am afraid
[37:46] and ashamed to
[37:48] say so many
[37:51] that follows
[37:52] this message of brother william marion
[37:55] branham
[37:56] this certified
[37:59] vindicated elected messenger of this
[38:02] hour
[38:03] at turning their noses up
[38:06] at pentecostal manifestations
[38:10] of the power of god
[38:12] amongst the people
[38:13] they're trying out the baby with the
[38:15] bath water
[38:17] not recognizing
[38:19] that even though he had to rebuke the
[38:21] excesses of gifts rebuke the excesses of
[38:25] the manifested fleshly manifestations
[38:29] among the pentecostals my friend
[38:32] that the original true remains the same
[38:37] and you will always have the fanatics
[38:39] you'll always have those that will be
[38:42] that way but let me tell you the real is
[38:46] still here today amen amen i know for
[38:50] instance many have called me and thought
[38:53] of me as just a pentecostal they don't i
[38:57] believe it that they really don't
[39:00] recognize the presence of the holy
[39:04] spirit for that's the way god presents
[39:06] himself as the
[39:08] unrecognized presence of the living god
[39:11] do you mean god will will leave me and
[39:15] and go to you and slap him on his face
[39:18] amen do you mean god will do act this
[39:21] way with you and and just leave me like
[39:24] that and they slapped him and threw him
[39:26] in prison in other words they isolated
[39:29] him they didn't want anything to do with
[39:31] him they didn't want no connections
[39:32] whatsoever because he was too
[39:34] pentecostal but that you understand the
[39:38] original
[39:41] was church
[39:41] genuine
[39:42] pentecostal church
[39:45] and it must remain the same
[39:48] but not petty costa like this modern
[39:51] pentecost the original one that had
[39:55] not just full of spirit lot of spirit
[39:59] lot of manifestations but also
[40:02] with the fullness of the word to balance
[40:07] that spirit and to correct those spirits
[40:12] in the church
[40:14] of the living god
[40:16] for jesus said
[40:18] the true worshiper
[40:20] will worship me
[40:23] in spirit not only in spirit
[40:26] and in the truth
[40:28] god needs both sides
[40:31] for you to have a spiritual balance
[40:34] you go this way and you take on spirit
[40:37] and you go off to seed and into weeds of
[40:41] fanatic actions and all kinds of
[40:44] superstitions and fast fantastic things
[40:48] and every little
[40:51] something that happens you you have to
[40:53] put a meaning on it
[40:55] over there and the other way you go the
[40:58] opposite way trying to be so
[41:01] beautifully cultured and controlled and
[41:04] so much you bring conduct ordering
[41:07] doctrine with such uh uh repression up
[41:11] upon the people that they are scared to
[41:14] manifest the gifts the lions the power
[41:17] the spirit of almighty god that wants to
[41:20] operate through them for his glory and
[41:23] and for his honor blessed be the name of
[41:26] the living god
[41:28] hallelujah let me tell you something
[41:30] friends
[41:32] he remains the same
[41:35] he does not change
[41:37] he is still here with us
[41:40] the prophet is not here
[41:43] but the spirit that was upon him is
[41:47] still
[41:48] here today upon some that believe his
[41:52] word in its fullness
[41:56] and we are feeding from the storehouse
[42:01] and receiving nutrients for our souls
[42:06] blessed be the name of the lord may god
[42:09] help every one of us to be a burning
[42:11] shining light
[42:13] for the glory of god i repeat
[42:17] the last day church
[42:19] must be with the same blueprint
[42:23] as the first
[42:26] church of the first church age
[42:29] it must be
[42:31] it cannot be just a lot of word word
[42:34] word and no spirit neither can it be
[42:37] lots of spirit spirit spirit and no real
[42:41] revelation
[42:43] we are not just called to be repeaters
[42:46] though we will repeat the word over and
[42:48] over again but we are called to be ones
[42:52] that god himself not you or i but god
[42:56] will vindicate his word
[42:59] amen in for instance what i mean is not
[43:03] somebody drumming up something but
[43:06] while peter yet spake the holy ghost
[43:09] fell on all them that heard the word
[43:12] amen
[43:13] rebelled his gifts were made certified
[43:17] by god stamped and approved by god
[43:20] god
[43:22] amen god
[43:24] testifying god speaking
[43:27] of his gifts
[43:29] let god speak
[43:32] whether this is true or false
[43:35] let god speak
[43:36] whether these gifts are real
[43:39] or whether they're makeup
[43:41] let god speak
[43:42] whether this is just words and words
[43:46] or he is full of words
[43:49] not to recognize
[43:51] that
[43:52] it is the word hallelujah making itself
[43:56] manifested in this day and in this hour
[44:00] in which we live oh blessed be the name
[44:03] of the living god hallelujah
[44:06] any church that doesn't have the spirit
[44:08] of god any manifestations is going to
[44:12] have to come before god for the way they
[44:15] live and the way they conduct themselves
[44:18] in the presence of god hallelujah
[44:21] thank god
[44:24] these men
[44:25] don't try to have a ministry
[44:29] god has them in his hands
[44:32] and god upholds their ministry
[44:34] god manifests himself through them for
[44:37] his glory and for his
[44:40] honor for they are in his hands and the
[44:43] hand represents the hand of power the
[44:46] hand of authority amen they praise god
[44:50] for none of them came in their own power
[44:53] or by their own desire
[44:55] but they came under
[44:57] uh
[44:58] the authority
[45:00] delegated authority
[45:03] of the holy ghost
[45:05] and preached under the power and
[45:07] authority
[45:09] of the holy spirit
[45:11] empowered by the holy spirit
[45:15] this
[45:16] and
[45:17] they stood up to the world
[45:19] and all its systems and all its errors
[45:23] regardless of whether they would be
[45:25] crucified jailed boiled in oil burned at
[45:28] the stake like you latimer and ridley
[45:32] and many other great man
[45:34] oh let us light a candle this day mr
[45:38] ridley that the they will never be able
[45:41] to put out or praise god forevermore may
[45:45] god give us more men and women like that
[45:48] that will stand for god's word and hold
[45:52] to his unchanging hands oh praise god
[45:55] the seven spirits of god one spirit
[45:59] manifesting itself
[46:01] himself

[46:06] virtues seven lights
[46:08] seven eyes

[46:24] god amen full of the holy ghost
[46:28] ought to rise by the living god
[46:32] hallelujah
[46:33] and the world would have nothing to do
[46:35] with them
[46:37] when you stand with god's truth in god's
[46:40] word
[46:41] it'll seem that way but a servant is no
[46:44] greater than his lord
[46:47] if they will put him away
[46:49] if they will despise him reject him
[46:52] crucify him
[46:53] so will they do
[46:55] to those that truly follow him
[46:59] you will not be elevated
[47:01] you are not going to be recognized
[47:05] you are not going to be
[47:07] placed anywhere for man's approval
[47:10] oh my but think of it
[47:13] choose to take the way with the lord's
[47:16] despised few amen let's decide in our
[47:20] hearts

[47:24] true no matter what others do what are
[47:28] the paths they want to take i know what
[47:31] i'm looking at what i'm seeing in the
[47:34] realm of the spirit of this word is the
[47:38] truth out of god's word and i'll wall to
[47:42] god's unchanging word amen hallelujah
[47:46] hey praise god hallelujah oh brother
[47:49] this last day church ought to be
[47:52] pentecostal in power pentecostal
[47:55] experience and i'm talking about
[47:57] original pentecost acts 2 4 pentecost
[48:01] that puts uh oh praise god

[48:16] head and give the glory to the living
[48:19] god amen back to the word saints of god
[48:23] this is the day that the lord has made
[48:26] we will walk in the day this day and be
[48:30] glad i want you to see
[48:32] how they had tongues
[48:35] interpretations
[48:37] of towns
[48:39] discernments
[48:41] miracles healings amongst them prophecy
[48:45] god in the midst of the church of course
[48:48] a lot of churches a lot of that they're
[48:49] in the message will call that excess
[48:51] they don't want it they don't want to
[48:53] have nothing to do with it with their
[48:55] fear of going wrong they will not
[48:58] attempt they will not allow the holy
[49:00] spirit to let them leave the shore and
[49:04] launch out into the deep they will not
[49:07] surrender themselves to the will purpose
[49:09] and power of the living god in these
[49:12] last days that god can manifest himself
[49:15] amen i tell you not only will the church
[49:18] be like that but she'll be unorganized
[49:22] you're going to say oh what kind of a
[49:24] church is that what kind of a preacher
[49:26] is that it doesn't have
[49:28] any really systematic way of
[49:30] administrating the church or running the
[49:33] church everything looks uh uh timing and
[49:36] this and that and it looks like it's out
[49:39] of order oh they don't understand how
[49:42] god built his church other people have
[49:44] those gifts and god will make his man in
[49:47] certain ways to do his will and other
[49:51] parts of the body will fulfill their
[49:53] other parts they're just as important
[49:56] but god has his plans he has his purpose
[50:00] he has his ways amen hallelujah and he
[50:03] shapes us to his will amen
[50:07] jesus christ
[50:08] through the ages
[50:11] has been revealing himself
[50:13] through his messengers
[50:16] amen
[50:18] just as moses
[50:20] was with the children of israel
[50:22] hallelujah
[50:24] god gave a revelation to each messenger
[50:27] to bring that revelation and ministry
[50:31] to his day
[50:33] and to his age
[50:35] hallelujah praise god amen let me tell
[50:40] you friends it's not enough
[50:43] for us to have even a five-fold ministry
[50:47] of ephesians four
[50:50] it is not enough
[50:52] for us to have
[50:55] also
[50:56] all these
[50:58] manifestations in the church
[51:01] because
[51:03] even the church
[51:04] with the five-fold ministry may
[51:07] go astray
[51:09] then it takes god to send a messenger
[51:13] to straighten out the church
[51:16] with even the ministers the membership
[51:19] all
[51:20] takes out direct
[51:22] messenger from god
[51:24] that clergy group
[51:26] for god to straighten them up
[51:29] by his holy spirit
[51:31] shepherds can be wrong
[51:33] as well as sheep
[51:35] can be wrong
[51:36] and god has to straighten them all up
[51:40] god himself comes on the scene
[51:44] through those messengers
[51:46] as the great shepherd of the sheepfold
[51:50] hallelujah to lead his own people
[51:54] back to the original sheepfold
[51:57] and to bring them back to truth and
[52:00] abundant power and manifestation of his
[52:03] divine presence hallelujah amen
[52:08] he is the word
[52:10] and he must be recognized
[52:13] as the word in his people
[52:15] but god had placed special leadership
[52:19] on these seven
[52:22] anointed men
[52:24] anointed with the spirit of god
[52:27] chose them use them and move them
[52:30] according to the council and direction
[52:33] of his own will and purpose
[52:36] and they appear
[52:38] once
[52:39] in every age
[52:41] once a messenger has come on the scene
[52:43] then a whole bunch of copycats want to
[52:46] come off from that
[52:47] and you're going to end up with
[52:50] many many coming thinking that they now
[52:53] have uh they're also a messenger and
[52:56] they have their message or the messenger
[53:00] uh was a messenger to a church age so
[53:02] all of a sudden their messenger to a
[53:04] church thank god we there are no
[53:07] messengers or the messengers promised in
[53:10] the word of god
[53:12] the only messenger we know
[53:15] earthly
[53:17] is malachi 4 5
[53:20] the ministry of brother william marion
[53:22] branham
[53:23] and
[53:25] the eternal messenger
[53:28] the mighty angel of god
[53:31] to the eternal church age
[53:33] for the members of that church age
[53:36] are eternal
[53:38] so the messenger has to be eternal
[53:41] the church age eternal
[53:44] oh the living god working through his
[53:46] people for his glory
[53:49] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[53:52] here we are friends
[53:54] we must follow the messenger
[53:57] as the messenger follows the pillar of
[54:00] fire
[54:01] the living god
[54:04] listen
[54:05] he that at the seven spirits of god
