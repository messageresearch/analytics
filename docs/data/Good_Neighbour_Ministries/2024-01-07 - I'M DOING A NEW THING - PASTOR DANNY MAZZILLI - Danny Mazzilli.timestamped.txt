[44:56] on Wednesday night praise God if you
[44:59] haven't uh tuned into that service you
[45:02] you should certainly tune into it you
[45:04] know I thought I thought maybe you know
[45:06] I said Lord should I be ministering the
[45:08] first service of the year you know and
[45:11] and it just didn't come on me strong I
[45:12] said he just let I just left it alone we
[45:16] left the schedule as it was and you know
[45:17] brother coffee came and ministered the
[45:20] word on on Wednesday night and you know
[45:22] on on last
[45:24] Sunday as I was you know just going out
[45:27] him and brother Corey were having some
[45:29] fellowship at the door there and brother
[45:31] coffee you know as soon as I entered
[45:33] into the room brother coffee said oh
[45:35] hold on a minute uh stop Corey don't say
[45:38] anything more he says you're breaking
[45:39] into my thought and I don't want brother
[45:41] Danny to hear you know I'm going to be
[45:44] ministering on Wednesday night and I
[45:46] said oh that's fine brother praise God
[45:48] that's good you know just left it alone
[45:51] praise the Lord anyway we came in here
[45:53] on Wednesday night and you know like um
[45:56] every time that I come into the house of
[45:58] the Lord you know I go into the Deacon's
[46:00] office and we've got a calendar there
[46:03] and so I'm given this testimony because
[46:05] the Lord told me to give it amen all
[46:07] right so this is not a testimony just
[46:09] for me this is for you amen so you know
[46:13] I went into the Deacon's office and I
[46:16] flipped it and I went right to January
[46:18] the 4th and the scripture said be strong
[46:23] and of good courage Be not Afraid
[46:27] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[46:29] thy God is with thee withs soever thou
[46:33] goest and I read that and I thought well
[46:36] praise God lord I believe it amen that's
[46:39] always been a strong scripture for me
[46:40] it's always been something that the Lord
[46:43] has dealt with me on you know even from
[46:45] when I started ministering the word of
[46:47] God and so I I I just left it at that
[46:51] and you know came in sat down we
[46:53] listened to the whole service and just
[46:55] about five minutes before the end of the
[46:57] service the Lord brought this back to my
[46:59] mind and I thought oh let me was that
[47:04] the scripture because brother coffee
[47:05] ministered on Joshua 1 he read that and
[47:09] then he read you know another scripture
[47:10] from Joshua and so I thought okay let me
[47:13] go to the office I went back I left here
[47:17] I went and checked sure enough that's
[47:18] what it was the Lord said okay there's a
[47:20] confirmation go let the people know I
[47:22] said okay praise God so I came out and I
[47:25] just exhorted on you know the the that
[47:28] God says to shout because God has given
[47:32] us the victory all the all the walls
[47:35] that are surrounding us any anything
[47:38] that surrounded you in 2023 guess what
[47:41] the walls are going to come down in 2024
[47:44] because he says I'm with you I'm going
[47:46] to be I'm going to go before you just
[47:49] shout this message let the PE don't be
[47:52] ashamed because this is the message
[47:55] listen those children of Israel they
[47:58] received specific instruction from
[48:00] Joshua amen praise God God is given us
[48:04] specific instruction on what to do and
[48:06] how to apply the word of God in this day
[48:08] and in this hour amen he says you go and
[48:11] you seven times around they went seven
[48:14] times which was a type of the seven
[48:16] Church ages but he says but at that
[48:19] seventh time he says you're to shout
[48:22] you're going to shout all in one Accord
[48:25] you're to shout all with one voice amen
[48:28] praise God there's a revelation in the
[48:30] land right now that this bride is
[48:33] shouting one with one voice one message
[48:37] no confusion it's Christ himself coming
[48:40] down and he says I'm giving you the land
[48:43] I'm giving you the victory praise God
[48:46] and so that was wonderful went into the
[48:50] back and I said I got to let brother
[48:52] coffee know that the Lord Vindicated
[48:55] this message tonight and so I went there
[48:57] and I said brother coffee let me show
[48:59] you this and I showed it to him I said
[49:02] look the scripture and then I said look
[49:05] January the
[49:06] 4th and then I grabbed my phone and I
[49:09] said look January the the
[49:13] 3 I said it's January the 3 I said
[49:18] hallelujah praise God I said Lord you
[49:21] Blinded Me the whole day I thought it
[49:24] was January 4 all day I said glory to
[49:28] God I there was no like nothing zero
[49:32] complete listen you don't think God can
[49:33] do something like that let me tell you
[49:36] something you got something on your
[49:37] heart you got a situation that's heavy
[49:40] that you can get so burdened down you
[49:42] know that God can lift that like that
[49:45] because God does it by revelation God
[49:47] does things that you cannot do amen and
[49:51] so I rejoiced I said praise God brother
[49:53] coffee look at this and brother coffee
[49:56] was he says I'm I'm you know if you

[54:37] into what God is doing here this morning

[54:55] on the first video make sure it's nice
[54:57] we can hear it clearly praise God and
[55:00] turn off the lights here on the
[55:24] stage
[55:55] little more volume
[56:07] [Music]
[56:23] please
[56:26] [Music]
[56:41] [Music]
[57:03] praise
[57:04] God so that's our first video and I'm
[57:08] just going to comment say a few things
[57:10] and really that video was to let you
[57:12] know it's January amen here in in in our
[57:17] civilization you know if you talk to the
[57:19] Hebrews and the and the Jewish people
[57:21] they're going to tell you no it's not
[57:23] the first month of the year and they're
[57:25] right because according to scripture
[57:27] Nissan is the first month of the year
[57:29] praise God but January is the first
[57:31] month of the year for us and so for us
[57:34] it's not a matter of days and times and
[57:37] Seasons when it comes to God doing
[57:39] something new amen God can do something
[57:42] anytime but here we are and you know
[57:45] people at this time you know January is
[57:47] a time where they they they they think
[57:50] of new starts new beginnings and God
[57:52] wants to give you a fresh start God
[57:54] wants to give you something brand new
[57:56] that you can uh look back on 2023 and
[58:00] realize that everything that happened to
[58:02] you every circumstance everything that
[58:05] came into your life God had a purpose in
[58:07] it because you're still here today and
[58:10] you're still serving the Living God Amen
[58:12] praise God January is normally the the
[58:16] theme around January when it comes to
[58:18] you know the Christian World they talk
[58:21] about repentance because repentance is
[58:23] you know to stop doing the things that
[58:25] you know you shouldn't be doing amen and
[58:28] to change and do things that you should
[58:31] be doing praise God and so there's a
[58:34] theme there that uh repentance you know
[58:37] um of our sin and transforming ourselves
[58:41] by the renewing of our hearts and by the
[58:43] renewing of our minds by taking on new
[58:45] habits by taking on new uh challenges
[58:49] praise God by making the sacrifices that
[58:53] we need to make in order to get the
[58:56] victory because without you know W
[58:58] Without You
[59:00] overcoming Without You overcoming
[59:02] yourself I'll tell you your greatest
[59:04] enemy is
[59:06] yourself because the enemy of Satan he
[59:10] works on your mind and he he he hits you
[59:13] from right from left he's constantly
[59:15] trying to bombard you with all kinds of
[59:18] heartache and circumstances and if you
[59:21] believe those things you start to speak
[59:23] them you start to become Your Own Worst
[59:25] Enemy you start to speak things remember
[59:28] you have the
[59:30] supernatural God living in you amen he's
[59:34] speaking in and through your life to
[59:36] change things to transform the things
[59:39] around your life and when you come into
[59:42] that understanding that you and God are
[59:44] one that you and his Spirit are are one
[59:47] now that he wants to work through your
[59:49] life you start to speak right amen amen
[59:53] praise God hallelujah
[59:55] let's play the second video
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:23] now
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:53] he
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:57] [Applause]
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:23] go
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:23] n
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:33] Hallelujah starting
[1:02:38] today amen praise God you know um New
[1:02:42] Year's always has people thinking about
[1:02:45] New Year's resolutions you know I I need
[1:02:48] to make resolutions and so let me just
[1:02:51] give you a few simple facts about um
[1:02:54] what happens uh with New Year's
[1:02:56] resolutions many people make resolutions
[1:02:58] but did you know that over
[1:03:00] onethird of these resolutions are
[1:03:03] abandoned within the first two
[1:03:07] weeks that's onethird of all the
[1:03:10] resolutions that people would try to
[1:03:12] make you know within a couple weeks
[1:03:14] they're right back at it again they
[1:03:16] can't help it 50% of them are completely
[1:03:19] abandoned by six
[1:03:22] months would it make sense that if our
[1:03:25] resolutions are not working most of the
[1:03:28] time that maybe we should look to God's
[1:03:31] resolutions maybe we should consider
[1:03:33] what God wants to resolve in our lives
[1:03:36] to allow him to personally look into you
[1:03:40] and to search your heart and and for you
[1:03:42] to reconsecrate yourself in such a way
[1:03:46] that you know that you you and God can
[1:03:48] walk together and he can share with you
[1:03:50] the things he wants to do in your life
[1:03:53] amen would it make more sense because
[1:03:55] you know what those resolutions that he
[1:03:57] has for you he made them before the
[1:03:59] foundations of the world he knew you
[1:04:02] before the foundations of the world and
[1:04:05] he had plans for you before the
[1:04:08] foundations of the world Amen praise God
[1:04:12] and so it's not a matter of I've got
[1:04:14] resolutions and I've got to make
[1:04:16] resolutions let me tell you what you
[1:04:18] need to do as a son or a daughter of God
[1:04:21] you need to surrender you need to yield
[1:04:24] yourself to God's will that's why he
[1:04:27] said I'll put a new heart in you I'll
[1:04:30] give you my spirit he's going to give
[1:04:33] you overcoming power you can't do it on
[1:04:36] your own I'm telling you right now
[1:04:39] anybody that thinks that they can do it
[1:04:41] on their own they've been trying to do
[1:04:42] it on their own they think they can do
[1:04:44] it on their own they keep falling flat
[1:04:47] right back on their face again because
[1:04:50] their resolution is in their own ability
[1:04:53] and not what God can do he says I can do
[1:04:56] these things glory to God Amen praise
[1:05:00] God and so we're going to look at the
[1:05:02] the last video now and then we're going
[1:05:04] to start right into it we're going to
[1:05:05] get into some things amen praise
[1:05:23] God

[1:06:42] hallelujah I'm going to read a scripture
[1:06:45] here and we're going to get into some
[1:06:47] things here Exodus
[1:06:50] 12 you can go to the next slide Exodus
[1:06:53] 121
[1:06:55] and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron
[1:06:58] in the land of Egypt saying this month
[1:07:01] shall be unto you the beginning of
[1:07:04] months it shall be the first month of
[1:07:08] the
[1:07:09] year and the next scripture which we
[1:07:12] read right at the beginning Isaiah I'm
[1:07:13] going to read it again remember ye not
[1:07:16] the former things neither consider the
[1:07:19] old things behold I will do a new thing
[1:07:25] now it shall spring forth shall ye not
[1:07:28] know it God's saying you don't think I'm
[1:07:30] going to hold it from you do you I'm
[1:07:33] going to let you in on it I'm going to
[1:07:36] let you in on what I have planned for
[1:07:38] your life you don't know what I have
[1:07:40] planned for your life but I've got
[1:07:41] something special planned for your life
[1:07:44] amen amen praise God I will even make a
[1:07:46] way in the wilderness and rivers in the
[1:07:49] desert praise God forever more here in
[1:07:52] this verse from Exodus
[1:07:54] God is speaking to the children of
[1:07:56] Israel right on the eve of their
[1:07:58] Deliverance out of bondage God was
[1:08:01] giving them instruction letting them
[1:08:03] know that he was going to do something
[1:08:05] new amen they didn't have any idea what
[1:08:09] God was going to do but he was going to
[1:08:11] do it and when he did it he did it with
[1:08:14] great demonstration he did it with great
[1:08:17] power he did it uh W with with such
[1:08:20] Deliverance that there was no doubt that
[1:08:23] it was God God doing it it wasn't their
[1:08:25] own ability it wasn't because Moses was
[1:08:28] doing it it wasn't because of their
[1:08:31] strength and that they could overcome
[1:08:33] pharaoh and the armies of pharaoh they
[1:08:35] didn't have a chance and I'm telling you
[1:08:38] there's things that are hovering around
[1:08:40] your lives and around this this
[1:08:42] Dimension and in this time and season
[1:08:45] that where Spirits are coming and and
[1:08:48] taking possession of the people
[1:08:50] controlling families taking taking
[1:08:52] families d destroying them destroying
[1:08:55] lives you don't have a chance against
[1:08:58] these Spirits unless God
[1:09:00] himself comes and does it with the
[1:09:03] demonstration of his power his glory his
[1:09:07] word in your life amen praise God this
[1:09:10] was the eve of their departure they were
[1:09:13] in long enslavement and on that night
[1:09:16] God threw Moses's instituting something
[1:09:19] new he says I'm giving you a new year
[1:09:22] I'm giving you a new start you are going
[1:09:24] to leave this place never to see it
[1:09:27] again because the word of his prophecy
[1:09:30] had come to pass Hallelujah you know
[1:09:33] that everything is prophecy you know
[1:09:35] that everything that God is doing he's
[1:09:37] already spoken it he's already seen it
[1:09:39] from before the foundations of the world
[1:09:42] you know that that's what makes you
[1:09:43] different from the rest of this
[1:09:45] Christian world is because God has
[1:09:47] placed his Spirit In You giv you the
[1:09:50] ability to look back into the mind of
[1:09:52] God and to see the things that God had
[1:09:55] already planned and and God had already
[1:09:58] instituted for this church for this
[1:10:01] Bride for this time for this season and
[1:10:04] do you know that when it comes into
[1:10:05] God's season he does things that Astound
[1:10:09] the people hallelujah he does things
[1:10:11] that go beyond human comprehension
[1:10:14] Beyond human sense but when God wants to
[1:10:17] do something new he just does it amen
[1:10:20] praise God and so here they were God was
[1:10:23] declaring his word so that Israel and
[1:10:26] the
[1:10:27] world could know because that was the
[1:10:30] world back then God had been silent for
[1:10:34] 400 years they my goodness they were
[1:10:39] listen those children of Israel all they
[1:10:41] knew for Generations was slavery that's
[1:10:44] all they knew but then God now comes on
[1:10:47] the scene to declare I'm still alive I'm
[1:10:51] still God I am that I am when he stood
[1:10:55] in front of pharaoh they couldn't
[1:10:57] recognize they couldn't see that in that
[1:11:00] man Moses that was carrying that staff
[1:11:03] was the mighty Living God they can't see
[1:11:06] in you when you tell them about what God
[1:11:08] is doing in this day what God is doing
[1:11:11] in this hour what what the word of God
[1:11:14] says not what I say listen when Moses
[1:11:16] went up before Pharaoh he said thus
[1:11:19] sayeth the Lord he didn't say thus saith
[1:11:22] me God has empowered me to tell you that
[1:11:27] this is what I'm going to do and this no
[1:11:29] no th thus sayeth the Lord God was
[1:11:31] showing that he was in his people again
[1:11:35] Hallelujah declaring his word praise God
[1:11:39] to show with great demonstration his
[1:11:41] power and that he was with his people
[1:11:45] amen thank you here they were about to
[1:11:48] step into something new we too are
[1:11:51] stepping into something new amen saints
[1:11:53] of God I've never been this way before
[1:11:56] here I am I've stepped into a new
[1:11:58] position as the pastor of Good Neighbor
[1:12:01] Ministries I cannot do this on my own I
[1:12:05] am going to tell you straight up
[1:12:08] straight simple that if God doesn't give
[1:12:11] you faith and God doesn't give you a
[1:12:14] revelation of how God and what God is
[1:12:18] doing in this ministry there's no way I
[1:12:20] can do this on my own God needs to give
[1:12:22] you faith
[1:12:24] to respect the office to respect the
[1:12:26] position to know that it's not that that
[1:12:29] Dan Brother Dany didn't put himself into
[1:12:31] this brother Danny would have run the
[1:12:33] other way amen I have so many things on
[1:12:37] my plate when this came up when the
[1:12:39] reality of it started to sink in I
[1:12:41] started to look around me and say oh my
[1:12:43] God how am I going to do this how is
[1:12:45] this possible Lord but I said Lord I'm
[1:12:49] just going to leave it alone and I'm
[1:12:51] going to go one day day at a time
[1:12:54] because I have not been this way but
[1:12:58] then you know what encourages me when I
[1:13:00] start to see the super natural moving
[1:13:02] through your lives Hallelujah he's
[1:13:05] vindicating to me he's showing me that
[1:13:07] he's with me but I need to see that he's
[1:13:10] with you that that he's that the same
[1:13:12] vision that that he's placed upon my
[1:13:15] heart is in your heart my heart is not
[1:13:18] to build up a Ministry with thousands of
[1:13:20] people no sir this F Foundation was
[1:13:24] built upon the Simplicity and the
[1:13:26] sincerity of leading people to Jesus
[1:13:30] Christ so that they could become what
[1:13:33] God meant them to be hallelujah praise
[1:13:37] God that will always be the call that
[1:13:40] will always be the purpose that will
[1:13:43] always be the The Passion of this
[1:13:46] ministry and if God places that passion
[1:13:49] in you this year I believe this year we
[1:13:52] we've turned a corner and God wants to
[1:13:54] do something new yes God wants to fill
[1:13:56] this place I believe he's going to fill
[1:13:59] this place amen praise God I believe

[1:14:14] talking about where people are
[1:14:16] prospering in
[1:14:17] Christ amen where their lives are being
[1:14:20] changed being transformed by the word of
[1:14:23] God being delivered from from their from

[1:16:04] with a people bringing them into the
[1:16:06] unity of the faith so that they can all
[1:16:09] recognize that this Rapture can only go

[1:18:15] been doing new things in our lives right
[1:18:17] from the first day that he called you
[1:18:20] praise God forever more Hallelujah let
[1:18:23] me just finish giving you my testimony
[1:18:26] because I know I didn't finish last
[1:18:29] Sunday it was brought to my attention
[1:18:32] you know because I was worried about the
[1:18:33] time I was looking at the time and I and
[1:18:35] I kind of got lost and then I realized
[1:18:37] that there was one more page in my notes
[1:18:38] that I didn't even get
[1:18:40] to and it was that God while I was under
[1:18:44] this influence of drugs an addiction
[1:18:48] under the drugs I had no idea that God
[1:18:51] was going to do a new thing in my life
[1:18:53] I had no idea that that there was a time
[1:18:55] and a season coming into my life so I
[1:18:58] was attending those Services I was
[1:19:00] listening to Pastor Simon Minister the
[1:19:03] word of God those words were like like
[1:19:05] arrows they were piercing my heart week
[1:19:08] in and week out I was going to the
[1:19:10] services you know for a period of maybe
[1:19:12] a month and a half or so and EV and then
[1:19:15] finally I just couldn't take it anymore
[1:19:18] I just realized that that that that
[1:19:20] because in my mind I'm going to tell you
[1:19:22] in my mind and in my thoughts I thought
[1:19:25] I would actually probably die from a
[1:19:29] heart attack from being on the drugs
[1:19:33] because there was times when my heart
[1:19:35] was pounding so much and I don't even
[1:19:38] remember I'd just wake up out of a
[1:19:40] stuper out of a out of a a night where
[1:19:43] where it was just it was just the the
[1:19:45] the drugs and I would wake up and I
[1:19:47] thought my God I can't believe it
[1:19:49] because because and I thought there I
[1:19:52] couldn't stop it
[1:19:53] there was there was no way I could
[1:19:54] personally stop it but then I came to a
[1:19:57] realization when I was hearing that word
[1:20:00] and I didn't know about brother brandom
[1:20:02] I didn't know God sent a pro don't
[1:20:04] listen you got to meet God you got to
[1:20:07] know that it's God that you have met
[1:20:10] first you can't even recognize you you
[1:20:14] will not even recognize that God sent a
[1:20:17] prophit unless you get god with you
[1:20:20] first because it's his spirit that leads
[1:20:23] you into all truth but all I knew is
[1:20:25] that I wanted to be delivered and all I
[1:20:29] could hear coming out of those Services
[1:20:31] was you need the Holy Ghost you need a
[1:20:33] power that's greater than your own power
[1:20:36] you need Deliverance that goes beyond
[1:20:38] what you think you you you you think you
[1:20:40] can go to a rehab you think you can go
[1:20:42] you can't go nowhere because I've called
[1:20:44] you for a special purpose I didn't know
[1:20:47] that I was being called for this purpose
[1:20:49] but God had a special purpose God was
[1:20:52] doing a break brand new thing in my life
[1:20:54] and so I walked up to Pastor Simon when
[1:20:56] he did a he did a a call to the altar
[1:20:58] where people could come up and I
[1:21:00] remember as Vivid as clear right now I
[1:21:02] went up to him and when it was my turn
[1:21:05] and he stood there and I looked at him
[1:21:06] and I said pastor Simon I want the Holy
[1:21:11] Ghost I need the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:21:14] only thing that I believe from what I'm
[1:21:18] hearing can deliver me and he looked at
[1:21:21] me and he said praise God brother you
[1:21:25] got the Holy Ghost I said
[1:21:29] what Hallelujah I said what I said I
[1:21:33] need to go to that water I need water I
[1:21:36] need to get to the water I want to be
[1:21:38] baptized because I heard what they said
[1:21:40] I heard the you know Gabriel and I would
[1:21:43] talk about baptism we talk about it on
[1:21:45] the way to church and I'd be asking
[1:21:47] Gabriel about the godhead and about the
[1:21:48] baptism in jesus' name and he would be
[1:21:50] answering me and I was it was ding in my
[1:21:53] mind and in my heart and I came to
[1:21:54] realize that that baptism was was was my
[1:21:57] life being buried my old life could be
[1:22:00] buried I said wow you mean that my whole
[1:22:03] life can be put behind me yes you can
[1:22:07] you can raise up into a brand new life
[1:22:09] amen I said I need to get to that water
[1:22:12] and we set it up and I don't care it was
[1:22:15] a horse trough it didn't matter to me
[1:22:17] what it was it could have been a muddy
[1:22:18] water somewhere I needed to be buried in
[1:22:21] the water and I needed to be cleansed by
[1:22:23] the word of God Amen Hallelujah and I
[1:22:26] got to that water and let me tell you
[1:22:29] something that's why I'm as zealous and
[1:22:32] that's why after after that day that I
[1:22:34] was baptized all hell broke loose around
[1:22:38] my
[1:22:39] life and everybody
[1:22:42] else's because I couldn't wait to tell
[1:22:44] everybody when I came up out of that
[1:22:47] water don't ask me to explain it all I
[1:22:50] know is that that man spoke words over
[1:22:52] for me and I remember him saying Satan
[1:22:55] get out leave this life you have no more
[1:22:57] hold on this life I don't I cannot
[1:23:00] explain to you but on that day I was
[1:23:03] supernaturally delivered from a cocaine
[1:23:06] addiction that held me for 13
[1:23:12] years don't let me don't let me try to
[1:23:15] explain to you how it felt all I know is
[1:23:19] that it it just had no power over me
[1:23:21] anymore it wouldn't pull me when I was
[1:23:23] driving back you know when I when I
[1:23:25] would be driving back from work and or
[1:23:27] from the food terminal sometimes i' get
[1:23:29] pulled to go off here get off over here
[1:23:31] at Islington Avenue because there was a
[1:23:33] guy that had lots of cocaine and I'd
[1:23:35] just go there Flash the dollars and I'd
[1:23:37] pick it up no power anymore then I was
[1:23:40] walking down at the food terminal and
[1:23:42] there was guys in the food terminal that

[1:23:46] to do was look at them and say and they
[1:23:49] knew exactly what I was saying
[1:23:54] they'd meet me right at the minion
[1:23:56] citris downstairs in the washroom and
[1:23:59] we'd make the
[1:24:00] exchange guess what all of a sudden
[1:24:03] they're looking for me you and and I'm
[1:24:07] I'm not even I'm not even

[1:27:09] come to pass you know usually by
[1:27:11] Christmas they get really discouraged

[1:28:15] the motive behind what it is that you're
[1:28:17] trying to achieve if that motive isn't
[1:28:21] foundational placed upon the word of
[1:28:24] God you got to have a you've got to have
[1:28:27] a motive that's placed upon the word of
[1:28:29] God God I realize that that to stand in
[1:28:33] this office and to stand in this
[1:28:36] position I cannot get overweight and and
[1:28:40] feeling sluggish and and and allow
[1:28:43] myself to just eat anything my wife is
[1:28:46] already
[1:28:48] started it gets on my nerves sometimes
[1:28:51] but she tells me no you need to cut that
[1:28:53] out you need no listen forget that sweet
[1:28:57] no no no I know you want to have sweet
[1:28:59] right after dinner just you know what
[1:29:01] skip a
[1:29:02] day you know she you know and and all
[1:29:05] these things but I know it's because she
[1:29:07] loves me because she's now she realizes
[1:29:09] she's a part of this ministry amen she's
[1:29:12] one with me she realizes that she's my
[1:29:15] helpmate that that she's got a part to
[1:29:18] do with all of this and if she can see
[1:29:21] it clear clearly that's her reward
[1:29:24] that's her placing in the word each and
[1:29:26] every one of you whatever office
[1:29:28] whatever position God has placed you in
[1:29:31] you do it not unto brother
[1:29:34] Danny you do it unto the
[1:29:37] Lord you do it unto the Lord you let the
[1:29:40] Holy Spirit place you direct you guide
[1:29:44] you but you're under the
[1:29:46] leadership of the Holy Spirit and we
[1:29:49] know that the leadership of the Holy
[1:29:51] Ghost has a provided way and those
[1:29:55] offices must be respected
[1:29:59] Mt I say this for your own benefits you
[1:30:03] need to know people coming to me and
[1:30:06] they're saying oh you know like you know
[1:30:08] uh just after the elections they were
[1:30:10] coming to me and they were saying oh
[1:30:12] Pastor Danny I said no I said not
[1:30:15] yet I said pastor Simon is still the
[1:30:19] supreme authority as a man in this
[1:30:22] church and you you I'm still brother
[1:30:25] Danny January the 1st if God gives you a
[1:30:29] revelation and an understanding of that
[1:30:32] office and that position and you want to
[1:30:35] receive the blessings that come from
[1:30:37] that office and that position then you
[1:30:39] will call me Pastor Danny and I will
[1:30:42] welcome it not because I'm I'm exalting
[1:30:45] the office no because I'm exalting
[1:30:48] Christ and knowing that you have got a
[1:30:51] revelation of this position in this
[1:30:53] office and you know you know you go back
[1:30:55] and read Christ The Mystery of God
[1:30:57] revealed brother bradam spoke a word to
[1:30:59] the church I can't remember everything
[1:31:01] but I do remember one thing he said you
[1:31:04] stay with your pastor there's going to
[1:31:07] be spirits that are going to come in and
[1:31:09] try to divide you and separate you and
[1:31:12] how does he do it he brings Rebellion he
[1:31:15] brings a spirit of rebellion on the
[1:31:17] people to where they don't want to
[1:31:19] submit to the pastor yes they don't want
[1:31:21] to call him Pastor oh yeah I'm telling
[1:31:24] you this is this is these are this is a
[1:31:27] reality I know I know but when God would
[1:31:30] check me when I would talk to Pastor
[1:31:32] Simon I have a hard time saying anything
[1:31:35] without Pastor in front of it because he
[1:31:38] is my shepherd He was my shepherd He was
[1:31:41] the one God spoke to me constantly he's
[1:31:43] still my mentor he's still a man of God
[1:31:46] that I will respect as my Elder until we
[1:31:49] leave this place Hallelujah
[1:31:52] because I believe that God has
[1:31:54] everything in its proper order and if we
[1:31:57] can see that and we can come under
[1:31:59] submission to that do you know how
[1:32:02] powerful this Army will become
[1:32:04] Hallelujah do you know that God will
[1:32:06] anoint that God will give me the the the
[1:32:09] the discernment to keep those Wolves
[1:32:11] Away you you don't want to get sniped by
[1:32:15] a wolf you don't want to get caught by
[1:32:17] by a by a a a Secret Snake because of
[1:32:21] your Disobedience and because of your
[1:32:24] rebellion and all of a sudden you're
[1:32:26] wondering why things aren't going right
[1:32:28] why things aren't happening the way they
[1:32:30] should and you know but but if you
[1:32:32] believe and you trust and you pray in
[1:32:35] the right way and we come under that
[1:32:37] unity and that understanding under the
[1:32:39] leadership of of Christ this church will
[1:32:42] be a powerful Church it will it will
[1:32:46] bring Deliverance to many people out
[1:32:48] there it because remember the Lord adds
[1:32:52] to the church but let me tell you you
[1:32:54] know God showed me something about that
[1:32:57] amen sometimes the Lord won't add to the
[1:32:59] church because of some of the disbelief
[1:33:02] and some of the unbelief of the people
[1:33:05] in the way that they that that they
[1:33:07] treat other people the way that they
[1:33:09] show respects under other people if you
[1:33:11] can't even respect your brother or your
[1:33:14] sister how can you tell me you're going
[1:33:16] to respect somebody that needs
[1:33:18] Deliverance in their lives God wants us
[1:33:21] to come under that leadership God wants
[1:33:24] us to be hospitable God wants us to
[1:33:27] express love in our testimony God
[1:33:30] doesn't want us going and condemning the
[1:33:32] people those people listen we're not
[1:33:35] we're against the systems because the
[1:33:38] systems are deceiving the people and the
[1:33:41] people themselves they get caught under
[1:33:43] Traditions they get caught under the
[1:33:45] teaching well because my mom and dad
[1:33:47] went to the Catholic church I go because
[1:33:51] they were were Baptist I'm
[1:33:53] Baptist but until the Holy
[1:33:56] Spirit comes personal into that
[1:33:59] life they will only know
[1:34:03] tradition they will only know what
[1:34:05] they've been taught but when we
[1:34:07] introduce them like God when Christ
[1:34:09] introduced himself to us when he says
[1:34:12] I'm going to do a new thing in your life
[1:34:15] personal when God did that it changed
[1:34:18] everything nothing could remain the same
[1:34:21] hallelujah praise God let me tell you
[1:34:24] when God wants to to to to pull you out
[1:34:27] and deliver you there's promises that

[1:42:45] here I'm going to read a
[1:42:47] quote from Brother brandham
[1:42:54] hallelujah thank you
[1:43:04] Jesus brother Bram says here what does
[1:43:07] it take to make a Christian Life that's
[1:43:10] the
[1:43:17] message we're not going to get done
[1:43:19] today but that's okay
[1:43:22] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:43:23] Life brother B says now the Bible said
[1:43:26] here in Ezekiel speaking and Ezekiel was
[1:43:29] a prophet and he said a new heart will I
[1:43:32] give
[1:43:34] you I like it always God speaking of
[1:43:38] something new that he's going to
[1:43:41] do Hallelujah he doesn't he doesn't say
[1:43:45] now that doesn't mean that he will just
[1:43:48] patch up the old condition
[1:43:52] you see you know we got things on our
[1:43:56] lives and we just want God to patch
[1:44:00] him because not we're we're we're not
[1:44:03] willing for him to root it
[1:44:05] out dig it out we're not willing to come
[1:44:09] to that place where we just we we we
[1:44:11] just we're crushed by the power of God
[1:44:13] in our lives because of his correction
[1:44:16] his
[1:44:17] deliverance we just want we just want to
[1:44:19] read a scripture
[1:44:21] that says there is no
[1:44:24] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:44:26] Jesus and we want to use that to
[1:44:30] patch can you hear what I'm saying amen
[1:44:33] we want to patch those things that we
[1:44:36] know that we need total deliverance from
[1:44:39] because a month down the road two weeks
[1:44:41] down the road there's that old demon
[1:44:42] again there's that old Spirit again
[1:44:45] there's that old Envy again there's that
[1:44:47] old critical spirit again but but God
[1:44:50] says no I will do a new thing and when
[1:44:54] he does it it's total Deliverance when
[1:44:57] we can accept it by faith and by
[1:44:59] Revelation he says here he says he
[1:45:01] doesn't now that that don't mean just a
[1:45:04] patch up of the old condition but a new
[1:45:06] heart will I give you and I'll take away
[1:45:10] the Stony heart which you
[1:45:15] have glory to God and a new spirit will
[1:45:20] I give you he never said he would have a
[1:45:25] facelift to an old
[1:45:28] church that's what he said he never said
[1:45:30] that he would have a facelift to an old
[1:45:32] church no this is what he said he would
[1:45:35] have a new thing brand new Hallelujah
[1:45:40] glory to God you're going to be able to
[1:45:42] look at those demon powers and those
[1:45:44] enemies from
[1:45:47] 20223 and say bye-bye
[1:45:51] you got no power over me I I'm listen I
[1:45:54] just told you when he delivered me from
[1:45:56] that addiction it was broken it was God
[1:45:59] he did it it was a brand new thing that
[1:46:02] he did I just accepted it I got to a
[1:46:04] place of desperation where I didn't want
[1:46:07] it anymore you got to get to a place
[1:46:09] where you don't want Pride anymore you
[1:46:11] don't want those things to control your
[1:46:14] thoughts and your actions and your words
[1:46:16] you just want the spirit of God to take
[1:46:19] you mold you shape you and do whatever
[1:46:22] he has to do hallelujah thank you Lord a
[1:46:26] brand new thing and in doing this you
[1:46:28] can't mix an old intellectual church
[1:46:32] with a new Pentecostal experience church
[1:46:36] he said Pentecostal experience church he
[1:46:38] didn't say Pentecostal
[1:46:42] Doctrine a Pentecostal experience is a
[1:46:45] supernatural experience brother Gabriel
[1:46:47] amen you know when the presence of God
[1:46:50] comes comes and burns the hide out of
[1:46:52] that enemy you know when God comes on
[1:46:54] the scene and gives you a scripture that
[1:46:56] delivers you and it's done it's finished
[1:46:58] it's over hallelujah praise God thank
[1:47:02] you Jesus bless the name of the Lord
[1:47:04] amen glory to God hallelujah let's go on
[1:47:09] here so here he says I'm doing a brand
[1:47:13] new
[1:47:14] thing Glory Hallelujah
[1:47:17] now the children of Israel now remember
[1:47:20] remember Isaiah 43:1 18:19 said remember
[1:47:24] not the former things that means you
[1:47:26] need to put those things in the past and
[1:47:30] you need to leave them in the past
[1:47:33] whatever whatever struggle whatever
[1:47:35] sickness it didn't come to stay it came
[1:47:38] to pass Hallelujah you got to leave it
[1:47:41] in the past he says forget those things
[1:47:43] amen behold I do a new thing now the
[1:47:46] children of Israel had a choice they
[1:47:48] could view their past and the problems
[1:47:50] of their present and they could focus
[1:47:52] upon what God wanted to do in their
[1:47:55] lives that's what they were given the
[1:47:57] ability to do a lot of them you got to
[1:47:59] remember a lot of them when they got
[1:48:01] into the Wilderness they wanted to go
[1:48:03] back to Egypt remember this that we're
[1:48:06] in right now is not a Wilderness but it
[1:48:09] is the place
[1:48:11] between
[1:48:13] Canaan and the future home it's the
[1:48:16] place right now where we are still in
[1:48:19] time we're still being molded and shaped
[1:48:22] our characters and everything are being
[1:48:24] are being uh placed and and and
[1:48:27] corrected and molded and shaped for the
[1:48:30] Millennium we are being prepared for the
[1:48:33] Millennium remember that so we need to
[1:48:36] understand where we're at so here they
[1:48:38] were in order to discover what God wants
[1:48:40] for you you must first see yourself as
[1:48:43] God sees you you've got to get out of
[1:48:46] that old mental stinking thinking amen
[1:48:49] the children of of Israel felt as though
[1:48:51] they were getting just what they
[1:48:53] deserved because of the way they had
[1:48:56] lived some even believed that God would
[1:48:58] never have anything more to do with them
[1:49:00] because they were there for so long they
[1:49:02] were in bondage for so long that they
[1:49:04] didn't think they could be delivered we
[1:49:07] need to break out of that we need to
[1:49:09] know that God can do this new thing in
[1:49:11] our lives Oh Glory to God you may feel
[1:49:14] like your past has made your life A
[1:49:16] Wasteland but in God your life can
[1:49:19] become a dream of life you can out of
[1:49:22] your belly shall flow rivers of Living
[1:49:24] Waters amen hallelujah praise God and
[1:49:28] the scripture Romans chapter um 8 verse
[1:49:31] one says for therefore there is no C
[1:49:34] that is for you for sure but it's for
[1:49:37] you when you come into that place where
[1:49:39] you know you know God you you realize
[1:49:42] that that that that you're you're you're
[1:49:44] you're free you don't have to be under
[1:49:46] condemnation when you come to a place
[1:49:48] where you repent and and you change you
[1:49:52] you know you've decided that this year
[1:49:54] I'm going to let the Lord do that new
[1:49:55] thing in my life you can hold that thing
[1:49:58] up in front of Satan when he comes to
[1:50:00] bring your past before you he tries to
[1:50:02] condemn you for things that you did in
[1:50:04] the past then you raise up the sign and
[1:50:07] you say there is no condemnation Satan
[1:50:10] God has given me that Revelation it's
[1:50:13] different when you're using that sign to
[1:50:15] cover
[1:50:18] sin Hallelujah praise God that was
[1:50:22] fresh if you must listen you must see
[1:50:26] your possibilities as God sees them I am
[1:50:29] making a way in the desert so I don't
[1:50:33] care what the circumstances look like
[1:50:35] right now in your situation it could be
[1:50:38] really dry I'll tell you if you've got a
[1:50:40] dry experience with the Lord and you
[1:50:42] don't feel that anointing just get down
[1:50:45] after hearing this word today get down
[1:50:47] on your knees know that God is doing a
[1:50:50] new thing and that anointing you watch
[1:50:53] when you get sincere with God when you
[1:50:55] truly make that decision no more Lord
[1:50:58] I'm leaving those slaves behind they're
[1:51:01] not going to they're not going to
[1:51:02] control me that that demon of alcohol
[1:51:05] that demon of of drugs that demon of
[1:51:07] smoking that demon when it rises up and
[1:51:09] tries to come they got no power over me
[1:51:12] because I've made a decision I'm going
[1:51:15] to die I'm going to perish but one way
[1:51:17] or the other I'm going with Jesus
[1:51:20] hallelujah praise God forever more
[1:51:23] Hallelujah it also means that God is
[1:51:26] about to surprise your enemy hallelujah
[1:51:29] praise God Pastor Simon I enjoyed that
[1:51:31] Fellowship the other day glory to God he
[1:51:34] says he says listen God's going to do a
[1:51:36] new thing the devil don't know about it
[1:51:40] wo Hallelujah the devil don't know what
[1:51:43] that new thing is in your life he
[1:51:45] doesn't have any idea because God's
[1:51:47] going to do it by revelation God's going
[1:51:50] to show you things and deliver you from
[1:51:52] things supernaturally and Satan can't do
[1:51:56] one thing about it because he don't even
[1:51:58] understand it glory to God God didn't
[1:52:01] reveal it he says I will do a new thing
[1:52:04] for you he says I'm going to deal with
[1:52:07] the things that concern you the devil's
[1:52:10] got a place in the Bible and it's called
[1:52:12] the Lake of Fire Hallelujah glory to God
[1:52:16] he's under our
[1:52:17] feet did you know that Satan is under
[1:52:20] our feet if you're in the body of Christ
[1:52:23] and Christ is above all things there's
[1:52:26] he's got all power when he showed up to
[1:52:29] those disciples brother Chris he said
[1:52:31] all power has been given unto me yes in
[1:52:35] heaven and on Earth amen is there any
[1:52:38] other power no can somebody please tell
[1:52:40] me is there any other power if all power
[1:52:43] is in him that's why how can you believe
[1:52:47] a trinity how can you believe that
[1:52:48] there's three gods he said it right
[1:52:50] there it said that there was one that
[1:52:53] sat in the throne it didn't say
[1:52:57] three come on
[1:52:59] Saints we need to know our God he says
[1:53:02] they shall know that I am their God and
[1:53:04] that they are my people hallelujah you
[1:53:08] can't know God unless you know that he's
[1:53:10] not a
[1:53:11] trinity glory to God Amen they want to
[1:53:14] listen they want the new thing to come
[1:53:16] their way they want it to be according
[1:53:19] to their way
[1:53:20] they want to make Jesus the son God the
[1:53:22] father and the Holy Spirit the power
[1:53:25] they don't just realize that when Jesus
[1:53:27] said all that the father hath given me
[1:53:30] he was talking about himself Elohim the
[1:53:33] self-existent one he's gone back to his
[1:53:36] supreme authority as the Creator the
[1:53:39] Elohim the self-existent one it didn't
[1:53:42] say self-existent three that's right
[1:53:46] glory to God Amen praise God but you
[1:53:48] know what they want to come they want to
[1:53:51] do things their own way listen to
[1:53:53] brother Bram he says now in in in this
[1:53:55] message here he says Christ was smitten
[1:54:00] once Hallelujah that's the original
[1:54:03] experience that's the original way on
[1:54:07] the day of Pentecost Peter said repent
[1:54:09] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:54:12] name of Jesus
[1:54:15] Christ and we sprinkle in the name of
[1:54:17] the father Son and Holy Ghost give all
[1:54:20] kinds of Creeds and everything else
[1:54:22] about it when we get off the word no
[1:54:24] wonder we can't get
[1:54:26] nowhere if you don't start right you
[1:54:28] can't finish right it's as simple as
[1:54:31] that you got to start right with the
[1:54:34] Lord that's the only way you're going to
[1:54:36] finish right amen and so here let me
[1:54:39] just
[1:54:45] finish we're going to finish up here and
[1:54:47] we're going to continue next week
[1:54:50] he says he says when we get off the word
[1:54:53] no wonder we can't get anywhere see God
[1:54:55] teaches us the lesson Moses Moses wasn't
[1:54:58] supposed to say now we'll start a new
[1:55:01] something here now and we'll organize
[1:55:04] and we'll make the Catholic church
[1:55:06] that's the first thing they done no then
[1:55:09] after a while well we'll start something
[1:55:11] new off of that we'll make the Lutheran
[1:55:15] Church you see and then come the
[1:55:17] Anglican and then the Baptist and more
[1:55:20] and more the campbellites and the Church
[1:55:21] of Christ and the Antichrist and all
[1:55:24] other things see they all started going
[1:55:26] one after the other one after the other
[1:55:29] making denominations and organizations
[1:55:32] now my point here is and this going to
[1:55:34] be quick is that we got to come God's
[1:55:36] provided way God is God is in God is in
[1:55:40] his church amen God is in his word
[1:55:44] praise God God is in the body of Christ
[1:55:47] if you're a Believer you've been placed
[1:55:49] there by God
[1:55:51] himself by placing his spirit in you and
[1:55:54] the way to receive his Spirit he's got a
[1:55:57] formula according to the word of God
[1:55:59] that if the spirit of God has come in
[1:56:02] you you've always had it but it can't
[1:56:04] help but go to the water because it's an
[1:56:07] outward expression of something that's
[1:56:09] real on the inside and that's why we get
[1:56:12] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:14] Christ so we can't go now he says now
[1:56:17] what is it we don't need nothing new go
[1:56:19] back Moses wasn't supposed to Smite The
[1:56:22] Rock in other words you don't change the
[1:56:25] Revelation no God said speak to the Rock
[1:56:29] God's given us a revelation that all we
[1:56:32] need to do is speak his word speak what
[1:56:35] he spoke don't speak your own
[1:56:38] interpretation don't put your own
[1:56:40] trinitarian Doctrine
[1:56:42] interpretation teachings of man and
[1:56:44] doctrines of man Jesus says because of
[1:56:47] your doctrines he rebuked the Pharisees
[1:56:49] and the Sadducees he says because of
[1:56:52] your doctrines you've made the word of
[1:56:54] God of none effect to the people and
[1:56:57] they don't know what to believe anymore
[1:56:58] and that's why when you go to somebody
[1:57:00] they won't stay there long enough to
[1:57:02] just listen to you just sit quiet for a
[1:57:05] minute and listen uh you know baptism in
[1:57:08] the name of Jesus Christ there's no
[1:57:09] other name whereby we must be baptized
[1:57:11] Jes says Jesus said he that believeth
[1:57:14] how does a baby believe how does
[1:57:16] somebody that you know you've got to
[1:57:18] repent you've got to know what you're
[1:57:20] doing amen praise God you got to come
[1:57:22] the right way or you're not even going
[1:57:24] to get
[1:57:26] started praise God but Moses was told to
[1:57:29] speak to the Rock not Smite The Rock not
[1:57:32] change the Revelation not do something
[1:57:35] that he wasn't told to do and again not
[1:57:37] try to start something new but to speak
[1:57:40] the old thing hallelujah praise God
[1:57:45] thank you Jesus listen I don't know
[1:57:47] about
[1:57:48] you but I have stepped into
[1:57:52] 2024 and I'm under expectation for

[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:18] new in my
[2:00:24] life has

[2:00:29] day has
[2:00:32] come
[2:00:34] to something new in my
[2:00:40] life praise be to God do something new
[2:00:45] in my life oh Lord that is our hearts
[2:00:49] desire God bless you please be
[2:00:52] seated uh why I stepped up here is this
[2:00:58] morning just before leaving for service
[2:01:01] I took this jacket which I hadn't worn
[2:01:04] since sometime last year and as I was uh
[2:01:10] uh you know going to walk out I felt
[2:01:12] like there's some piece of paper in my
[2:01:14] pocket that you know might forget uh
[2:01:17] money or whatever sometimes you know in
[2:01:20] my pocket uh we all do that but then I
[2:01:24] took it out and when I took it out it
[2:01:27] says here um on the top Hebrews
[2:01:33] 138 Revelation
[2:01:35] 10 um 1 to 11 but the scripture I wrote
[2:01:41] the one that I have in my handwriting
[2:01:43] here Joshua 1
[2:01:47] 1-9 that's that's this morning just when
[2:01:50] I'm
[2:01:51] [Applause]
[2:01:54] leaving just so you know it's it's a
[2:01:57] supernatural in action and being able to
[2:02:01] see God in the simplest things if you
[2:02:05] can't recognize him it'll pass right by
[2:02:07] you you won't even know it and this is
[2:02:09] not something I wrote yesterday last
[2:02:11] week or the week before months ago and
[2:02:15] this was sitting in my pocket why am I
[2:02:17] going to find it now but here I find it
[2:02:21] and it says
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:23] joshua9 furthermore I wrote uh here um
[2:02:29] God spake unto Moses in other words in
[2:02:32] all the text before all you can read
[2:02:35] this and God said unto Moses god spake
[2:02:37] unto Moses god spake unto Moses Joshua
[2:02:40] 1:9 I have it written here
[2:02:44] now God spake unto
[2:02:47] Joshua no more God speaking unto Moses
[2:02:51] because Moses is gone but God speaking
[2:02:55] unto Joshua so we believe God is going
[2:02:57] to speak to our brother we we believe
[2:03:00] God will speak through the Holy Ghost we
[2:03:03] believe God will anoint us with his word
[2:03:05] in this day and in this hour and the
[2:03:08] other piece of paper that I have here is
[2:03:13] about a new crop
[2:03:15] coming and um that this is then I will
[2:03:20] give him that one because it's wrote
[2:03:23] down before it's not something made up
[2:03:26] and so um just just so you are
[2:03:29] conscious that we are not just a church
[2:03:33] we are here I always say it because the
[2:03:37] reality to me when I just start talking
[2:03:39] like this I already sense his presence
[2:03:41] around me I I sense he's right with me
[2:03:45] um let me mention we why the brother was
[2:03:50] talking and I showed brother Tim I I
[2:03:53] took a photograph because for one moment
[2:03:56] uh there's just a flash there and like a
[2:04:00] person standing right there looking up
[2:04:03] at him talking about the new thing right
[2:04:07] and I caught the picture right then
[2:04:10] while this uh person just stands looking
[2:04:14] uh of this being said so the
[2:04:17] supernatural God is still in our midst
[2:04:20] am but we don't have you know the
[2:04:22] Pentecostals think they got to see a big
[2:04:24] miracle and they jump on their healing
[2:04:27] we are jumping too but not because of
[2:04:29] that brother Brenham said they on the
[2:04:32] day of Pentecost it wasn't Miracles and
[2:04:35] all that that made them jump they caught
[2:04:37] a revelation amen they caught a
[2:04:40] revelation of what he was telling them
[2:04:42] all the time it suddenly came to light
[2:04:45] Hallelujah and they couldn't speak they
[2:04:48] couldn't talk just tongues begin to
[2:04:50] break out praise the Lord so are we
[2:04:53] thankful to God and we see the anointing
[2:04:55] already beginning to flow and move in
[2:04:58] our brother's life how many could see
[2:05:01] that how many can recognize that amen I
[2:05:06] I want you to know that uh somebody had
[2:05:11] texted me and a few people have been
[2:05:13] asking me well brother now that uh uh uh
[2:05:18] pastor Dan is in his position um what
[2:05:21] should we call you uh what can we say
[2:05:25] you know I you know so I realize that
[2:05:29] it's a bit of uh confusion and we all
[2:05:31] get that confusion because last year has
[2:05:35] changed and I still went writing
[2:05:38] 2023 on a check writing 2023 on
[2:05:42] something else like you keep doing that
[2:05:44] until that old habit breaks you don't
[2:05:48] for force yourself it just happens as
[2:05:51] the year goes along then all of a sudden

[2:06:38] gone to churches where they call the
[2:06:40] pastor Tim and uh Tom or Jim um and
