live with the gospel that you have given to us come Among Us Satan I come against you in the name the Lord Jesus Christ in this spirit that is supposed the word of God right now we take everything that and under our control in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of God Amen and amen Hallelujah we're gonna read the book of Samuel first Samuel chapter 8 verse 4 to 19. today is a day I don't think we're gonna jump begin a listing and take instruction from God because God always give us instruction when he's leading you then all the Elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel unto Rama and said unto him behold thou are old and thy sense walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the but the thing displeased someone and when they said and the things is free somewhere when they said give us a cane to judge us and some will play unto God and the Lord said unto someone hacking unto the voice of the people in in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them that's a big thing if you reject God you heading towards destruction Hallelujah the Lord said on December hacking unto the voice of the people because why they have they have not rejected but they rejected according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even onto this day well in day half forsaking me and serve other gods so the so do they also on today now therefore hacking onto their voice how did ye protest solemnly unto them and shield them the manner of the king that shall reign unto them and Samuel told the words of the Lord unto the people that asked him again and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appointed them for himself and also Charles and to be his husband and some shall run before his chariot you know before there was nothing like that now God telling them what are you asking what how the king gonna be Hallelujah and he will appointed him captains over thousands and captains over 50s I will set them in the two year his ground and to reap his habit and to make his instrument for war and instrument of his chariot and he shall Take Your Daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to the Bakers and he will take your fails and your Vineyards and your oblivious even the best of them and give them to his servant and he would take the tenth of your seed and you are Vineyard and to give it to his offices and to his servant and he will take your men servant and you are made seven and you are goodest goodest young men and your asses and put them to his work he will take the tenth of your ship and you shall be in his servant and you shall cry on and you shall cry out in that day because you are King which you have chosen you and the Lord will not hear you in that day may the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of his way you may be seated you see when the children of God one God was leading them there was peace the amazed servant yet everything was for them Hallelujah praise God prophet Samuel was the mouthpiece of God that day he was God's spokesman in that day he was God's spokesman in that day he was the prophet that God gave it to them to lead them but why this happened because when God was leading them somewhere God make them so comfortable someone became common to them so when you are pastor or any leader that leading you don't let that person become common to them you know that God has ordained that person to lead you my subject here is rebellious leads to destruction rebellious leads to destruction the children of God Israelites they rebelled against God and God was further not one time you remember God said the same thing they did for me when I was taking them from Egypt to Canaan and I let them hear they think he doesn't know there is nothing here anything that he spoke to speak to your houses and everywhere God knows God has not changed because right now before God did that physically he talked to them physically through the prophet because everything that they do they sit in their tent and they mammal and God here I tell you seven this is what he's doing Brethren don't think anything that he talks to your Chambers God does not change he is the same yesterday today and forever he does no change if we want to be in heaven that we are going and we know we are going how many believe that they are going to heaven if you know you are going to heaven live right stay with the word of God and do things right because everything that you do it will come against you not only you affect the whole bride of Christ Hallelujah we thank God God has given us a pastors to lead us first God was leading them through the prophets our day God has brought a prophet and what happened he left us the word of God now the prophet is not here anymore by the Holy Ghost himself is here that's God himself is here you rebelled against God you're gonna face the consequence Hallelujah thank you Lord instead of them to listen to right now I'm coming to our way instead of the people to listen to their pastor or the man of God that is leading them they were looking to the other other minister apart from their Church Minister that God has ordained to lead them God always appoints somebody purposely for your own good in the church the local church that you are in it doesn't matter whether I say handsome tall doesn't know how to talk is very is very calm he cannot talk to you anywhere that he make you mad all what you have to do to respect that person because it's God man Hallelujah that Pastor is the mouthpiece of God for you because we human being chose human to lead us not God anymore because when God speaks you cannot stand in front of him so when it happened like that from today I'm gonna lead you I'm gonna give you your own kind to to to talk to you and I'm gonna be in him speak through him he did that twice who through Moses till today Hallelujah thank you God before anything happened to this Israelites God told them because what they are asking all their tribulations trials and everything he they're gonna cry as much as they want they're gonna fix by themselves right now we cannot face anything by ourselves God is the one that leading and we have to follow the pastor because God ordained him he know your needs he know your tries you know your troubles that you're gonna lead you when you need something you gotta that's why this church here we have Deacons that happened the pastor so you need anything that you want God to do not underestimate your deacon your pastor don't go to other Church don't look to the other side why the children in Israel said they need they need a pastor they need a king because they were not looking what they have they look outside beyond the camp they were not looking what they have let me tell you this church what what we have here you cannot get it anywhere other than where God has placed you no matter it doesn't matter what Minister that comes here to preach that person is not bigger than your pastor do not fall in trap and just look the other side you don't understand anything you gotta ask God has provided you a tools that you can need for your own good for your answer because you remember we are going home and we are going home together we don't want to leave no one behind our children what are they are here or not here God will decide all what you didn't want pray for them pray for your children pray for your loved ones your faith and your prayers God hear everything do not slack or slumber be vigilant and protect one another Hallelujah not that baby you go outside for fellowship and somebody sitting down there and yabbing against your pastor or your brother or your Deco and you sitting down there without defending that person your pastor that leading you and somebody's sitting down there and talking rubbish some years ago I remember brother Kofi went to one brother and he was bashing brother Pastor brother coffee never sprayed that he bashed that person I said I'm gonna tell the pastor that's where it's supposed to be you protect your pastor no matter what that man is no bigger than your pastor and he has no more wisdom than your pastor that God has given you to lead you I have a strange message today thank you Lord I don't know but I believe God has given me this Hallelujah I told you today I'm not gonna let I'm not gonna let you jump up and down it's something because me I have a hard time to bring this message but I believe God is preparing us the place where we are going we will never we've never been there before so God is preparing you right now Hallelujah when the children of Israel they thought the Lord told them you are going to the their promise that they've never been there before tomorrow do you know what will happen tomorrow how many people know is that nobody don't know we are going by what faith by what God amen have you ever been to the the darkness very dark pitch that when you raise your hand like this you can't even see your hand how many have I ever experienced that before okay that pitch this world here is so I get it so dark get it so dark very dark so God has given us a ball of light and that ball of light your pastor is the one who hold that ball of light in that peace there so we all follow him as a you know like a a like a sheep they all follow what the shepherd they all follow the shepherd you understand so that Pastor hold that ball of blood that pillow fire he's holding like that because God has ordered him to lead us so he is the one bringing us you remember brabham said every minister is going to present his congregation before God so every God or damn Minister won his bride to be perfect no blemish so he gonna reach a time God gonna chastise you and sometimes when this thing happen the people stood there and said this is a man this is not God but let me tell you God will never pass your pastor to anyone to speak to you God will use your pastor to speak to you and if you don't listen you be care you become the same thing rebellious like the children of God when they repair when they rebelled there was a price to pay if you don't understand anything it's like if I hurt you and you're done you don't tell me how would I know if you don't understand anything ask ask God knows all the answer and even if you go to your pastor maybe sometimes he tells you wait he has to ask from God and God will give that Pastor answer to you do not rush patience patience brings Joy he brings answer he brings peace Hallelujah when God gave you a pastor he knew all your needs be before he release him to lead you all the churches are not the same don't think you're gonna compare your church to other church over there I eat Fufu Brothers every day he eat pasta that Pastor is have he has a way of leading his people you cannot compare your pastor to other Church very very important brother Brown said even if you think your pastor is wrong and your heart is pure God will tell your pastor like this and come back in life because you are God people you are God children Hallelujah you are God children your pastor has a different gift that God lead him because he knows your needs so stay Hallelujah your pastor is unique your pastor is unique God give good things to his children always give good things the best thing for your children because we are the bride of Christ if you are the white you think that I will give anything that is not good to my wife no I will always give her the best because it's me she represents me he she refresh me so I want her to be good refraction the same thing applies to God the same thing I pray to God God knows that you are his bride so when he gave you a pastor stay with him it doesn't matter whatever you think about him don't let that man become common to you very very important Hallelujah as I said he is the mouthpiece of God Hallelujah he is God man he's God man you can say because some time ago somebody told me oh he's a man that can't see me what's that mean that person he lost confidence in your pastor you cannot get nothing from your pastor you cannot get nothing from your pastor because you regret him very very important very very important let me tell you your pastor is your spiritual father your pastor is your spiritual father remember even all this there is to use even six seven years old boy to be a king if you read the Bible you know 12 20 years old he became a king and all the air the the the the the the the area that they have to subject everything to him the king speak when that that King speak you cannot say oh I'm older than him it cannot work and God will never give you more Revelation than your pastor God will never give you more Revelation than your pastor so you have to think who you are your degree your highest your money whatever you are you have to subject unto God if you're subject unto God you'll be what blessed Hallelujah thank you Lord amen God didn't send your pastor to destroy you they are all here to help you and to and you are here to help you to the journey that God has set before you we are in a journey this is Ted Exodus right now is not man anymore it's the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost himself is not man anymore so don't think it's man that leading you is God in the man it's a God man Hallelujah now no prophet now God man is leading you to the Rapture because we are not expecting any more prophet in these days so don't think somebody is coming to lead you other than your pastor Hallelujah stay strong Hallelujah if we stay strong and behind our pastor what will happen the church rise up mighty Army Hallelujah thank you Lord remember his a man standing here but inside of him and when you speak is God speaking through that person Hallelujah don't think that he is a man and sometimes one one people you correct them they don't want correction human being is tough to correct human being Hallelujah thank you Lord it doesn't matter what shape or form that man is is God man Hallelujah leading you and guiding to your destination if you disobey him you are destined for destruction remember that light I was telling you the ball in the pink Darkness right now in the big black says in the world the world is changing if that can give that congregation that followed that Pastor in that preach time there I will leave behind as soon as the when that pitch light they go from here to there you cannot find your way you cannot see nothing what happened you head into a destruction to always try as much as you can to follow the man who has that ball of light leading you if you lose that ball of light that God himself is leading you you lose your you lose your way and we don't want to lose nobody you all want to be there and sing and shout and glorify our King Hallelujah this thing sometimes when we speak like this it looks like a just a words it's not a verse it's reality we are going home remember if the Rapture tell us you're gonna go like anybody goes the way same way and when you close your eye you open your heart because God told us when the Rich Young Ruler opened his eye what happened to the young Rich ruler what happened to him God gave him a chance and he told him because of his propriety and the sin that he has he refused the word of God and when he opened his eye where was he write down he lost that ball of light the Lord himself he got real opportunity for God himself to talk to him really God himself to talk to him or he can read this little you can when you pray the the message leadership you can hear you can get a lot of stuff called this thing that we're talking anybody that stands here don't think the brother come here and stay say what he wants let me tell you everything that we speak we're gonna answer hey this body when I came here I was very young handsome now no hair chubby you see chubby the belly slidish in Africa when your belly is big they say it has money I I'm not I don't have nothing you understand every day we are changing as soon as you come here as soon as you come to this world the day that you came if you feel the air and you go ah you heading towards your home he said recycling you came from back home you're going back home no no matter what you are whether you are rich or poor you gonna go so when you cross over where would your destination that's where you have to stand work the Lord I think the Supreme Court work for your own salvation your pastor cannot work for your salvation for you wait for your own salvation and if you obey your pastor God Smiles on you obedient is better than sacrifice obey your pastor we heading towards a place where we never been there before and I believe something tremendous is going to happen something is about to happen Hallelujah you see one day you're gonna see all these people full because one is getting getting closer and closer you know when when when the when the the the they blast the the the Train Tower the whole Bible in the United States World solder the best seller as soon as you see that's where human being you cannot buy your way out to God you cannot buy your way out to God no the salt or the Bible the Bible was the best seller as soon as everything get cool he go back to shares Hallelujah if we go over there sometimes cobwebs is clearing around and covered around it running around God he rocked because they've done it so the the the spider wrap it up for them wrap it up and put a nice place in the corner there so when something happened again you know every time anybody got into trouble or you go to the hospital and the doctor said this first thing you want to you want to go to God why because he alone has the life and he has given you life eternal that life eternal you have to keep it embrace it it's yours God giving you for eternal see you know that we're gonna be like this body here God doesn't need over there but thank God for the grace and mercy that we are in that part under brasama was speaking about the pattern when someone was talking I understood everything because I am I I cut fabrics I do upholstery you better not yeah yes no yesterday today I can't I caught a beautiful fabric from where from England and therefore when I get what I need the rest I put in the cabbage it's the same thing the same amount of money thousands of thousands of dollars or pounds whether I cut the portion that I need the rest garbage it's the same thing it's you see the whole world how many people sitting here tonight how many people listen to us tonight you are one in the million have blessed you are do not underestimate yourself what God has given to you people want to get it but they cannot get it because it has to be given to you and you are blessed that God has given to you you are in the pattern where God needs the rest go to the garbage you didn't you didn't ask for that Hallelujah it's not this just you come here to minister here to stand here to talk to you that you are special you are not special nobody is special we are all special Hallelujah in the eyes of God we are honest we are all special about God has ordained people to help him to do the work to lead the children to put them in line so that nobody can go here nobody gonna go look eating a pastor love to chastise somebody um a shepherd the Sheep gets rebellious and he doesn't want to flow through the shepherd the shepherd has to take the sheep and break the leg you think when the shepherd is breaking he feels the same pain that the Sheep pain that the Sheep is peeling but she has to do it for what to save the Sheep otherwise the wolf gonna get that ship there how are you gonna be lost it's the same thing that applies to us we are safe to be led if you if you listen to the the message leadership he talked about that you you ha your mother lead you and then then after that you you go up and you go to school your teacher lead you and when you finish you come back and then your father lead you and honey get it then the same thing always we have to be lead somebody has to be taking care of you so when your pastor chastise you you have to listen because I see some years ago because you don't you don't expect that whatever your past somebody the other Church Pastor is doing you're gonna that your pastor is gonna do the same thing no God give each Pastor his own revelation how to lead this because he knows your needs so you know how to move you around and protect you and put you around it like this so I was a deacon and then then every Decor has a part years ago some years back years ago and then and then he used to have a basket to give the congregation who was and then then this brother just went there he asked his children he said his people uh what would they need who does he need and then so one of the brother one of the sisters went and told oh your Deacon ask you about this oh no you never asked me and this oh he's not doing his work and this and that so after after everything the the time came the basket they released because whatever other they come doing God doesn't give me the same Revelation that I have to do I know the people who I'm taking care of so I know their needs I know who is sick who is this who is this who is this who is this so I don't have to ask you I go by inside so when the basket was given I gave the basket to them they were shocked and then the and then the the the other person you see I told you you don't have to speak you see whatever you speak God knows whatever you desire God knows you don't have to look to other person what is doing I went to I went to years ago I went to Ghana and when I went there I was in the message and when my brother was in the message so in the in the that time is long time is I went to we went to sleep and then he called his pasture to come and because you think I don't know nothing then they they know more than me and then their message is different and our message is different so they come down there and then my mother-in-law make me a nice rice I said no I don't want to eat rice because Canada every day rest with me I don't come here to you right so my brother and his Pastor was this in the morning when I wake up I went to sit down we were talking and then they call me so so what do you think about the the services I said brother bradish you see the rice that you brothers are eating you have your plate right he has his plate so why don't you eat whatever you're eating and you're peeping the same food you are peeping to look what is eating you are all your Abra your other brother is eating eating they couldn't say one word you have your own plate that you you're eating why are you eating you looking to order one that is eating your brother whatever he was eating eat your food let me eat my food I have a pasta you have a pasta let your pasta feed you let my pastor feed you we are all going the same place you don't mingle that whatever you eat maybe it's not good for me you're gonna eat I'm gonna get the area yeah so you don't do anything like that are you gonna look to other church or other congregation or who are over here I don't care who wear a virus just eat your pastors food and you're gonna get nutrients energy you're gonna get fat no you're not gonna get fat more than me but you're gonna get fat Hallelujah glory to his name today is a a special message this is what God has given to me Hallelujah sometime Pastor I will talk to the uh someone and he get annoying that's where I said a shepherd you feel the same he doesn't like to break the leg of the sheep but he has to break it he has to talk to you no matter how much you get annoying he has to talk because you need a medicine that will heal you that will strengthen you and after what you're gonna be joyous Hallelujah you will not leave that ball of light behind you follow flow flow and we will go together Hallelujah thank you Lord amen God is good yeah God is good thank you Jesus thank you Lord sometime Pastor tries to shape congregation November and he I'll think that he is he knows more than the pastor no congregation member no more than his pastor he is the voice of God for you your pastor is the voice of God for you it doesn't matter whoever comes and and preached on the property and 20 people or 40 people got healed or how might they dance over here that Pastor that that minister is not more than your pastor your pastor is the best you see the children the little babies and their mother do you think that little baby gonna take any other mother is better than his mother his or her mother no every child their father or their mother is the best their father and their mother is the best Hallelujah they follow them no matter where they go they follow that they will never follow stranger no matter how much candy or anything I give them no they don't want it why honesty is saying that is inside instant God has given them something that only their mother only their mother is the best so God said your pastor is the best for you your pastor is the only one who can lead you to the promised land it doesn't matter who what you think so if there's anything in us we have to start changing right now today not tomorrow today Hallelujah and you cannot convince your pastor that you love your pastor more than any uh uh when somebody is going to your pastor you think you only you we are all a congregation their Pastor is their Pastor not only you all else is our pastor Hallelujah Glory Moses was was God man prophet Abraham was God man prophet who is the god man holy ghost himself through his ordained minister a God the God man God man Minister that stand here is the Holy Ghost in him he has the word of God the word of God is in his mouth we have to respect a man of God that leads you no matter when when the man of God asks you something don't stay your home and criticize a memory God no no matter what he said in your closet God knows and if you don't do it if you continue to do that you're gonna pay the price if you continue to do that you're gonna pay the price sometimes somebody do something and he get angry and sometimes you know what happened to the anger there no matter what you tell him you see let me tell you if you do somebody's if you did somebody wrong and he stayed there he didn't go to that person and and make things right and you just let it go it's gonna go don't it never go you got to go to that person and make things right otherwise it's still there don't think that it's going oh the Brotherhood is gonna forget so we are oh okay no make things right Hallelujah you have to make things right you don't know sometimes we got sickness and we get something sometimes we end up to the operation and something like that because things that we do and then we don't make things right yeah things come upon us we invite things for ourselves because you you give Satan a room to work it out but as soon as you go to the brother or the sister and make things right you expose Satan and restrict let us live in harmony as a one family how many as one family Hallelujah thank you Lord Hallelujah oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty our God is good
