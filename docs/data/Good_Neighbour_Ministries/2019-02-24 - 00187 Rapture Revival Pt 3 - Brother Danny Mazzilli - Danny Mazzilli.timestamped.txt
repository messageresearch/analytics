[0:08] something that you receive that you
[0:10] don't deserve this you know
[0:12] so I understand this love that I'm
[0:15] talking about when you come into this
[0:17] bonding of Holy Ghost and you've done a
[0:20] revelation of God's love and respects
[0:23] respects it's very important when you've
[0:26] got that and you come in tonight that
[0:29] that bonding period for you are in the
[0:31] church and you're loving with your
[0:33] details your Trustees your fellow
[0:35] membership your Sunday School teachers
[0:38] your all these positions they heard that
[0:40] you're constantly working with it's just
[0:53] going and being you know told to do
[0:56] something now you're doing it by
[0:58] regulation it's completely different
[1:01] it changes everything in everything the
[1:04] lips of this world all the attitudes the
[1:07] anchors the bad feelings the past
[1:11] because you know what that's all amen
[1:16] almost ill feelings all those thoughts
[1:19] all those words that were spoken here
[1:22] son of God
[1:24] those are carnal things that have not
[1:26] entered into that place already perfect
[1:30] love complete entered into that place
[1:32] and so it sets you free from the bondage
[1:36] of humanity right you're human but
[1:40] you're a son dog first right when you
[1:44] come into that revelation you are a son
[1:46] of God before you came into this world
[1:48] and you're being restored back to that
[1:51] position
[2:03] look very love one another don't no
[2:15] matter what condemn attracts the city
[2:18] now that you're all one great big sweet
[2:23] route now
[2:24] but remember my warning see Satan hope
[2:28] that that stay that plane we don't
[2:32] realize me we look down on this but we
[2:34] looked at one when you get into your
[2:36] position when you start to act in your
[2:38] position seasons will thank you you
[2:42] gotta just know anything that's worth
[2:45] victory over is going to require
[2:48] something like so over time Helen
[2:52] but remember go behind CC won't let that
[2:54] stay that way no sir
[2:56] you shoot something just get the rest of
[3:01] the pole because
[3:13] it'll shoot something it B has to bring
[3:16] somebody in to make his target you see
[3:21] that's the way he works he works on
[3:24] people and he works on individuals to
[3:29] try to smoke them and make them his
[3:33] target
[3:37] let's move on so that's my something
[3:41] we've covered about LinkedIn the love of
[3:44] God that's what this was all about and
[3:47] when we move on but let us not forget
[3:55] that in the beginning when he smoked
[3:58] decided Adam you took something from the
[4:01] decide you might take him that he might
[4:05] take him a bride now he says here and I
[4:11] read this he took something from his
[4:15] side now the strength of Christ was for
[4:17] a cause that he might take for him one
[4:20] to be his family the drop here in the
[4:25] restoration period now what's being
[4:29] restored now is Eve Adam has been
[4:34] restored through the church ages the
[4:38] Bible talks about the Christ being the
[4:41] first one to tell the second one
[4:46] he now is restoring deep because
[4:50] remember the world and so right now
[5:00] what's happening so when his masterpiece
[5:03] was perfected baby had decided to take
[5:08] it from him not another piece not
[5:12] another creation but the same creation
[5:15] so you are not some thing that he
[5:20] created he took from himself remember we
[5:24] read from the beginning description so
[5:26] that he can bring back to yourself a
[5:30] church a bride and so my brother don't
[5:35] think back to this but think of it and
[5:37] he took from the debtor the original
[5:39] creation to make the bride friend he
[5:43] never made another creation he took a
[5:46] part of the original creation then if he
[5:51] was worth what must the bride be it's
[5:54] got to be the original word Living God
[5:58] in so in you now as you become a
[6:05] position as a circuit our God is being
[6:08] placed the supreme authority of God's
[6:11] Word because he has to give you that
[6:16] authority in order to complete the cycle
[6:23] so that us is because we are the ones
[6:29] now in this age that's actually
[6:33] we talked about this but this will never
[6:36] stop expanding that sparkle in our minds
[6:40] because it will be finishing spending
[6:42] around you but you as a son or daughter
[6:46] of God we need to work that's been
[6:49] placed a new place in you which is God's
[6:55] masterpiece now in the last days I'm
[6:58] using this in a pear pod on the bride
[7:01] the masterpiece that's coming forth
[7:04] there's a masterpiece that there's a
[7:08] masterpiece rising the masterpiece felt
[7:11] and I see our own after that I see a
[7:14] poem she's comfortable process but she's
[7:17] coming right back again to that
[7:19] masterpiece and that's what we were
[7:21] talking about through all those Church
[7:22] ages and that's what all those changes
[7:25] are important to understand where you've
[7:28] come from and now as as the super Church
[7:33] must accommodate and finish off this
[7:36] work you've got to talk to a man don't
[7:39] think you just a church pepper you could
[7:41] just come in here a week in week out
[7:43] just do your own little thing you've got
[7:46] to come in too perfectly in a position
[7:50] in the Word of God so that you can
[7:54] there's a minister that get into humans
[7:57] don't stir up the gift that he used of
[8:00] God don't let Toby enter don't let all
[8:05] these spear because this is a
[8:06] supernatural season now what we've got
[8:09] to do is set yourself aside and that
[8:11] goes for every officer every position in
[8:13] the church do dogs have wanted to get to
[8:17] perform what it needs to perform so
[8:20] there's a masterpiece no she's coming to
[8:21] a process but she's coming right back
[8:23] together to the masterpiece perfected a
[8:27] perfected masterpiece Eggman so she's a
[8:30] part of that word that was spoken by him
[8:33] you have a church without spot or
[8:35] wrinkle they will not be connected any
[8:41] way with any type of organization or
[8:43] denomination the first thing it's passed
[8:47] through through those such things but it
[8:51] will never be there you cannot be under
[8:57] the denomination and understand what's
[9:02] being you gotta come out
[9:07] you've got a tradition out of all those
[9:13] things that you thought the church
[9:15] should run this way the church should be
[9:17] run that way that's why you know this
[9:19] weekend's leadership was was more on God
[9:23] supernaturally transformed each and
[9:26] every one of us as servants we have
[9:29] servant leaders here not leaders that
[9:32] dictate we are leadership that's going
[9:35] to stand here and put our phone to the
[9:37] wheel with you and work with you and be
[9:42] examples for you you're going to do the
[9:44] things that we say we want you to do
[9:47] because this is about the bottom are you
[9:50] back together not coming into perfect
[9:53] harmony just like we were there in the
[9:55] amplified version there's a harmonious
[9:58] relationship that brings this body
[10:00] together and it becomes a super church
[10:02] it becomes a like things we try to
[10:06] penetrate you as a son or daughter of
[10:09] God because you belong to this church
[10:11] and here in your position and things
[10:14] from the outside or the trying to
[10:17] penetrate you and can try to get through
[10:19] the Ubu by a church body you can seven
[10:23] further questions in because God nation
[10:29] of this purpose is not just
[10:39] everywhere some of them I feel nothing
[10:43] some of them I thought my knees I don't
[10:46] understand it but I just know that it's
[10:49] not there's something just not doing
[11:02] that just looking to suck the life out
[11:07] of the body that's not the way works
[11:10] there's not your position you're doing
[11:16] your part and now it becomes you're
[11:18] doing your part of your part of that
[11:19] body these intelligence knows what the
[11:22] body needs and so it sets out the
[11:24] reinforces what needs to be said that
[11:27] something happens over here something
[11:30] happens over there but boots on the
[11:32] scene because it's his body its sons and
[11:35] daughters of doctor recognize their
[11:39] position
[11:56] that's a please Lord it's working
[12:00] nothing and you send up dangle a colony
[12:08] not send out the parvis
[12:14] [Music]
[12:30] I trusted the Word of God has been
[12:36] Minister to your heart this morning to
[12:39] that it just helped you in the problem
[12:55] Jesus Christ bless this planet will
[13:13] fulfill this purpose so it will change
[13:15] our attitudes next slide it will be the
[13:21] perfecting for the rapture that's what
[13:27] we're doing we're being perfected but at
[13:34] the same time not be surprised this this
[13:41] kind of preaching is going to know it's
[13:43] going to have an effect on your life
[13:45] it's gonna it's gonna start to deal with
[13:47] little aspects of your walk comparable
[13:50] you're talking your attitudes and the
[13:53] way that you look
[13:54] the way that you proceed one another
[13:56] because this is a this is a body
[13:58] movement if you're in this party like I
[14:00] said if you have this kind of attitude
[14:03] you're going to walk yourself out of
[14:05] here because your attitude will all of a
[14:08] sudden turn them against that's what
[14:12] happens that's why people need the
[14:14] church because my people be blocking
[14:19] they walk into the wilderness they're
[14:28] walking into the experience where they
[14:30] can't seem to I know people like that I
[14:33] know people all I can do is pray because
[14:45] [Music]
[14:50] it's because and so this whole element
[14:56] must be recognized it must be it must be
[15:01] our attitudes it's to take time though
[15:04] for you to you know to really break into
[15:06] these kind of areas in your life
