[3:53] corner what
[3:54] a been striking me what a strange
[3:57] number 17
[4:00] anybody feel that what a weird number
[4:02] man
[4:03] 17 I just I was looking at that thinking
[4:06] what is what is
[4:08] 17 what does it mean 2017 what does 17
[4:13] mean so I decided to look it up but
[4:15] before I did I thought you know what if
[4:17] I think about the
[4:20] message something that always stuck with
[4:23] me ever since I first heard it is that
[4:25] when brother Brandon was baptized in the
[4:27] 17th person I said why do would have to
[4:30] be the 17 person and why do we have to
[4:33] know it's a 17 person right it would
[4:36] always stuck with me and I I I said I
[4:38] don't know why the 17th person and uh
[4:42] then I thought 2017 so I looked at up I
[4:47] was thinking pillar fire came down over
[4:49] the 17th person declared the message
[4:52] right as as your
[4:55] uh what you say joh as John the Baptist
[4:58] went for to the first to coming to the
[5:01] Lord you're going to go forth you in
[5:02] your message you're going to introduce
[5:04] the second coming to the Lord right so
[5:07] when I looked it up you know what 17
[5:08] means in the
[5:09] Bible it means
[5:12] overcoming amen the
[5:18] enemy
[5:20] also complete victory
[5:29] praise the Lord amen no wonder he had to
[5:32] come down because without
[5:35] him right right we're no match for our
[5:38] enemy but with him our enemy and we
[5:41] believe it is no match with this
[5:45] people praise God hallelujah blessed be
[5:48] the name of the Lord that blessed me so
[5:50] much when I seen that I sing there the
[5:53] Unseen hand see that's the
[5:55] trouble it's an unseen hand that's
[5:58] guiding us amen that's the trouble we
[6:00] got to we got to look by
[6:02] faith so there lies our
[6:05] battle

[10:15] Lord allow Brother Richard to come and
[10:17] give that little testimony of uh
[10:20] something the Lord has done for
[10:22] him and I say the Lord has done it for
[10:25] [Music]
[10:27] him and he's going to give it testimony
[10:29] of what the Lord did for his mother but
[10:31] I say the Lord did for him how many you

[10:39] unsaved son do it for me Lord praise God
[10:43] amen glory to God my brother's going to
[10:45] give us that this
[10:49] testimony amen I just want to give a
[10:52] small testimony what my my Lord told my
[10:54] mom a couple years back um she was um
[10:59] going to get her her pension that for
[11:02] for security that from the governments
[11:04] and um she started back couple years
[11:07] back and she was applying for it and um
[11:10] I end up my brother called me and told
[11:12] me about it that she want to get all our
[11:13] phone Bo there's four of us my family
[11:15] right by myself my brother my two
[11:17] sisters and uh they were fighting
[11:20] against her that saying she never worked
[11:21] at all in her life I remember as a kid
[11:23] growing up with her and seeing her go to
[11:25] her job that they were denying that she
[11:27] work in C she came from Scotland into
[11:29] here work and they were fighting her on
[11:32] that so when my brother told me that I
[11:35] knew that we came to a prayer meeting I
[11:37] brought a prayer request for that ask
[11:38] the Lord to intervene in her life for
[11:39] that and then not soon after that like
[11:42] within a couple of months or so of that
[11:44] I get a phone call back from him saying
[11:46] everything was going through for it was
[11:48] cleared up and everything and everything
[11:50] she had applied for before that when she
[11:52] asked for it so they had to backtrack
[11:53] and give her all the money from that but
[11:55] they wouldn't give her and then all the
[11:57] rest for that afterwards so in the end
[11:59] everything worked out for her and she
[12:01] got back more than she would ever could
[12:03] imagine back CU had to give her back
[12:04] that stuff but I just want to thank the
[12:05] Lord for what he did you know sometimes
[12:07] we feel to give him glory but now I'm
[12:09] giving him glory because what he did and
[12:11] I thank him so much for that I give him
[12:14] [Applause]
[12:22] prise thank you Lord done for a faithful
[12:25] mom faithful dad sister de sister
[12:28] Jennifer got a song for us uh if they
[12:31] can come and uh sing for us and if you
[12:35] got a little short testimony we might be
[12:38] able to squeeze
[12:39] in uh here tonight but uh you can let
[12:43] somebody know and then we can judge it
[12:46] as to whether we have the time or not
[12:47] but if you do
[12:49] have ask
[13:26] you
[13:28] [Music]
[13:47] the father has a
[13:50] plan though it's hard to see it
[13:55] now you're feeling you feel your want
[13:59] walking all alone but he is there no
[14:05] doubt when the storm around you
[14:09] rages and you're toss to and
[14:14] from when you're faced with life's
[14:18] decisions not sure which way to go stand
[14:26] still and let God
[14:32] standing
[14:35] still it's hard to
[14:40] do when you feel you have reached the
[14:45] end he'll make a way for you stand
[14:53] still let God move
[14:56] [Music]
[14:59] the enemy surround you and the walls are

[15:14] been friend there's never been a
[15:19] moment that his arms wer reaching out

[15:29] moving right now stand
[15:35] still and
[15:39] God standing
[15:41] [Music]
[15:43] still is hard to
[15:48] do when you feel you have reached the
[15:52] end he'll make a way for you stand still
[16:01] let God
[16:05] move when you feel you have reached the

[16:26] come but lonely in his
[16:32] time so stand
[16:36] still let God
[16:41] move stand
[16:46] still and let God
[16:52] move amen
[16:55] [Applause]
[17:03] amen praise
[17:05] God
[17:07] well the Lord bless yall I know we're
[17:11] coming to the end of another year we've
[17:13] got a couple hours left and you know um
[17:17] on Wednesday night I was just inspired
[17:20] by the Lord to just Minister you know
[17:22] just a simple thought from Luke Chapter
[17:25] 13 Jesus speaking he says a certain man
[17:29] had a fig tree planted in his Vineyard
[17:31] and he came and sought fruit thereon and
[17:34] found none then said he unto the dresser
[17:37] of the vineyard behold these three years
[17:40] I come seeking fruit on this fig tree
[17:44] and find
[17:46] that cut it down he says why cth it the
[17:50] ground and he answering said unto him
[17:53] Lord let it alone this year also
[17:59] and you know we can sometimes look back
[18:02] on our lives and you know the Lord wants
[18:05] to come and pick some fruit off of our
[18:08] lives and he doesn't find any because
[18:11] for some reason it just hasn't been
[18:13] bearing
[18:14] fruit but then listen to The Gardener he
[18:16] says Lord let it alone this year also I
[18:21] believe there's
[18:22] Mercy God's given us Mercy for another
[18:25] year amen praise God he says and it bear
[18:32] fruit he says Lord let it alone this
[18:35] year also till I shall dig around about
[18:37] it and it bear fruit well and if not
[18:41] then after that thou shalt cut it
[18:44] down well praise God I thank God for his
[18:47] mercy and his grace that he would send
[18:51] the Holy
[18:52] Ghost to give us Mercy one more
[18:57] year and so so we've got to realize that
[19:00] that Mercy is ours to accept and we've
[19:03] got to let go and leave that year
[19:07] behind this is time now to move on and
[19:11] listen to what Jesus says here he tells
[19:15] us in in John
[19:17] 15:5 those who remain in
[19:20] me and I in them will bear much fruit so
[19:25] it's a simple lesson it's very simple we
[19:28] just need need to remain in the word of
[19:30] God we need to
[19:33] do different than what we did in
[19:37] 2016 if it didn't bring about fruit amen
[19:43] praise our God forever more listen to
[19:45] brother Bram here he says in Revelation
[19:48] the message Revelation 4 he says our
[19:51] heavenly father as this New Year Eve
[19:54] just about two hours now and it'll be
[19:57] over there will will be a new
[19:59] year what we have done this year we have
[20:04] did many things that I've done that I'm
[20:07] ashamed of myself I Repent of those Lord
[20:12] and there's a lot of things that I've
[20:14] done that many of my brethren didn't
[20:17] understand many of my brothers out in
[20:19] the fields don't understand in why I did
[20:23] them but father I did them because I was
[20:27] led to do them
[20:29] I pray father that you will never let me
[20:32] be ashamed of that leading but Lead Me
[20:35] Lord to continue to do as I am led to do
[20:39] help me God because I seek sincerely to
[20:43] know your will that I might do it to
[20:47] bring as you showed me many years ago
[20:51] when I left this church the bread of
[20:54] life to the people of the world I
[20:57] believe 27 17 is going to be a very
[21:00] significant year Luke 17 yes sir this is
[21:05] the time where the son of man is going
[21:07] to come and he's going to do things in
[21:09] our lives that we never ever
[21:11] expected this is a jubilee year for
[21:15] Israel in 1967 they faced the greatest
[21:19] battle but they overcame that's right
[21:21] and here we are 50 years later and I
[21:24] believe we're going to overcome in 2017
[21:27] so I I'm going to encourage you you to
[21:29] leave 2016 like brother Philip prayed
[21:33] completely behind I don't want to bring
[21:35] nothing but that experience with God and
[21:37] that walk with God and let 2017 be a
[21:41] tremendous year for you that is my
[21:44] desire for each and every one of you God

[35:33] know what we spoke your name yesterday
[35:36] you
[35:36] know we were speaking your name
[35:38] yesterday and actually I couldn't I said

[35:42] brother's name and I was like

[35:47] him but it's good to see them and God
[35:50] wish we bless them
[35:53] [Applause]
[35:57] it's our custom to have a
[36:00] testimony a full testimony if if you
[36:03] would of someone in the congregation
[36:05] that they could come and and give God
[36:08] thanks and praise for doing great things
[36:11] and this fell here he's only been with
[36:16] us uh less than 5 years maybe four years
[36:20] maybe somewhere in there I could be
[36:21] wrong but uh he was born in uh in the
[36:26] raised in the message
[36:28] and I'm going to let him fill in details
[36:30] but what a what a life what a what a
[36:34] testimony and I can say it
[36:37] because uh we can
[36:40] see that God's hand is on his life and
[36:44] is taking him and bringing him forth
[36:47] we're about to be blessed not just by
[36:49] testimony but by a life of a Believer
[36:52] who uh is coming forth and will be a
[36:55] great benefit in his congregation amen
[36:57] trust me I believe that and not only me
[37:01] but I've some others believe it too
[37:02] because we've seen what God has done so
[37:05] without further Ado I'm going to ask
[37:07] brother Daniel Bessie to come and give
[37:11] his testimony for the glory of God all
[37:13] right there is
[37:16] power in the name of
[37:21] Jesus oh there is
[37:25] power in the name of
[37:30] Jesus there's so much power yes there
[37:36] [Music]
[37:43] is every CH break every
[37:49] CH break every CH break every CH break
[37:55] every ch
[38:02] amen God bless
[38:05] you I a littleit
[38:13] nervous brother Mike uh called me about
[38:16] a couple weeks ago and asked me to do
[38:17] this and of course my
[38:20] my a words where I can't really say no
[38:24] we you're ready to give uh to give U to
[38:30] get give a witness a hope that is in
[38:33] us if we're supposed ready to do it and
[38:35] we're called to do it we do it so but
[38:38] I'm very nervous I'm not i' I've done a
[38:40] lot of public think in my life but I've
[38:42] never stood in front of a
[38:44] church and uh it's different I think
[38:47] standing in front of uh standing in
[38:49] front of God's people is not like
[38:50] standing in front of the classroom
[38:57] I've
[39:00] um a testimony is not it's not just a
[39:04] bunch of events it's not just it's not
[39:07] just a person's life story testimony is
[39:11] if it's a testimony the true testimony
[39:13] it's the word being fulfilled right
[39:17] that's
[39:18] um as brother Mike was just saying a
[39:20] little that's something that you only
[39:23] see you can only truly see if you're the
[39:25] one living the testimony how do you give
[39:28] that testimony is is how do you make it
[39:30] felt for others or let others see
[39:33] it is a little more difficult um I was
[39:38] raised in the
[39:39] message I'm a third generation message
[39:42] believer if that makes sense phrase goes
[39:45] around but it's uh brother Mike said to
[39:47] me so when you when you get up there
[39:49] there's a lot of people in the
[39:50] congregation who have also been raised
[39:53] in the M each and not everybody is as uh
[39:58] has come to um the same experience
[40:01] whatever else he said you can you know
[40:02] sort of speak about your
[40:05] experiences in that light being raised
[40:07] in the
[40:08] message so I I'm trying to speak from
[40:11] that perspective
[40:14] um so there's a lot of things about my
[40:16] testimony that I could I could speak
[40:19] about as some notes here but it's too
[40:21] hard to read them so I'll just go
[40:23] from um a lot of things I can speak
[40:26] about I mean testimony is very there's
[40:28] there's it's very multi faets there's a
[40:30] lot of things you can say uh but I'm
[40:32] trying to stick with that point of
[40:34] view so as as
[40:39] uh I had the best of intentions I think
[40:42] as a child I was raised I pretty much
[40:45] idolized my pastor um I very spread for
[40:50] ministers I just remember I remember
[40:52] wanting to be one wanting to be a
[40:54] preacher and um
[40:57] just my my my pastor was very he's very
[41:00] Dynamic when I was younger he very
[41:02] Dynamic I remember one time sitting in
[41:04] the front pews and I was sitting one
[41:06] side and the the other little guy was
[41:09] sitting in the other side and the pastor
[41:10] would run down he jump up and he jump on
[41:12] the back of the Pew and the PE almost
[41:13] tipped over and it was all so exciting
[41:16] right but he would get in spirit he
[41:17] would be so alive and I thought man you
[41:19] know
[41:20] what something moved me to want that
[41:23] kind of
[41:25] life but that's not the way my life went
[41:29] my my life became very ugly
[41:33] um became very
[41:35] broken I U I became somebody that I was
[41:39] very ashamed of and I don't know how I
[41:41] got
[41:43] there I started out going one way and I
[41:46] ended up somewhere very very
[41:51] different uh I was baptized around
[41:54] age8 um
[41:58] and and that's probably where my early
[42:00] sort of spiritual life almost ended
[42:03] which just had to say but that's that's
[42:05] kind of where where it wasn't long after
[42:06] that that I kind want to real but I was
[42:09] baptized I didn't uh I didn't really
[42:11] know why I was getting baptized I
[42:13] remember my a pastor called U called my
[42:18] dad and my dad turned to me said well
[42:20] there's a baptism service you want get
[42:21] baptized and to me it was sort of a
[42:23] right of passage it was something you're
[42:24] were supposed to do once you did your
[42:27] had your
[42:28] baptism uh you were you were a Christian
[42:30] so you could do all things you take
[42:32] communion you could be involved in the
[42:33] church in whatever
[42:37] way and so I so I did it I didn't know
[42:39] anything about confession I didn't know
[42:40] I had any sin so I didn't know that I
[42:42] had anything in confess I mean we're
[42:44] born in sin but I didn't understand that
[42:46] there was no
[42:49] um you don't understand that as a child
[42:52] you look at what your parents teach you
[42:54] you look at what they live and being ra
[42:57] raised in a mess Church in one sense
[42:59] you're raised with the power of God
[43:01] around you but in another sense it's no
[43:03] different to being raised in any other
[43:04] religion it looks like ritual it looks
[43:08] like you just do what you you're
[43:10] expected to
[43:12] do so it becomes
[43:14] meaningless
[43:18] um and it wasn't it wasn't very long
[43:21] after that that I started to fail I
[43:23] remember my
[43:25] um I'll try try to give some sort of
[43:28] understanding of of why I think I I I
[43:32] fell away the way I fell away if those
[43:34] are the right
[43:35] words um my dad had had I I I believe he
[43:40] loved me loved loved the song he had had
[43:44] the best of intentions but he also had
[43:46] his own
[43:47] struggles
[43:49] uh outside he seemed like a very good
[43:52] man a very good Christian inside the
[43:53] home he was he was angry
[43:58] bitter
[44:00] um he wasn't very encouraging at least
[44:03] by the time I came on I'm age my brother
[44:06] Ron is first it was a little different
[44:07] when he grew up but when about time I
[44:10] got along you know after eight kids I
[44:12] guess life gets pretty
[44:14] stressful but
[44:16] uh it gave me a lot of
[44:20] self-doubt there was never any real
[44:22] encouragement I felt not I knew my Dad
[44:25] loved me and and tried to show it at
[44:28] times
[44:29] but there there was a lot I end up a lot
[44:32] of self-doubt a lot of self-loading I
[44:34] felt like I could never I was never good
[44:37] enough for him there was nothing I could
[44:39] do to be good enough
[44:44] um and I struggled with that need in the
[44:47] sense to for acceptance and why am I
[44:49] saying that I'm saying this
[44:51] because when you're when you're a a
[44:54] parent in the world you're just a parent
[44:57] par when you're a Christian raising
[44:59] Christian children you're not just a
[45:01] parent
[45:03] anymore what your children see in you is
[45:06] what later they will think about the
[45:09] heavenly
[45:10] father and that that like I know that
[45:14] that lays a big weight on us any of us
[45:17] who are
[45:18] parents but that's the truth when you're
[45:21] child grows up and there they seeking
[45:24] God and seeking to be close to him the
[45:27] struggles they will have are the
[45:30] struggles that they had with
[45:34] you if you show them anger if you showed
[45:38] them nonacceptance
[45:40] if you show them they could never be
[45:43] good
[45:43] enough that's you're going to feel
[45:45] coming to
[45:50] God it's it's we have a loving God we
[45:54] also have a just God he does want us
[45:57] there
[45:58] is we need just as we are corrected by
[46:02] him we need to correct our children but
[46:05] just as he encourages us we need to
[46:07] encourage our
[46:08] children we can't
[46:10] just constantly be rate them and tell
[46:13] them what's wrong we have to tell them
[46:16] what they're doing right we have to have
[46:18] a
[46:21] balance and that's what I struggle with
[46:23] when I try to come to God in in my uh in
[46:27] my later
[46:28] teenss I couldn't see the grace of God I
[46:31] couldn't see forgiveness I couldn't see
[46:32] love I couldn't understand that what I
[46:35] saw was what I heard when I heard God I
[46:38] heard my father's
[46:40] voice
[46:44] um but soon after of course everybody
[46:47] hits their U teenage years and teenage
[46:50] years are are especially in this sort of
[46:52] society we've set up teenage years are a
[46:54] rough time and when I when I got to my
[46:57] teenage years I started to really sort
[46:59] of uh move in a in a completely
[47:01] different direction that my life have
[47:03] been
[47:04] going um as I sought for
[47:09] acceptance of course when you don't find
[47:11] it at home you find it outside the home
[47:14] there's a there's a
[47:16] statistic
[47:18] um about uh Teenage promiscuity in my
[47:24] but in young girls often girls that are
[47:27] more
[47:28] promiscuous statistically
