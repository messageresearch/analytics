[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good night to one of the wonderful to be
[0:18] here with you on another marvelous
[0:22] Wednesday evening may the Lord bless us
[0:27] richly together as we look into his
[0:33] wonderful words of life
[0:37] tonight we will continue our study and
[0:41] the seven churches or accurately the
[0:48] introduction to the seven churches I
[0:51] must spend this time to live in some
[0:56] background before I actually get into
[1:02] the church ages H by age so I'm laying
[1:07] the foundations for that and then after
[1:11] we will go into each church age as they
[1:16] unfold before us male or Miss Lee bless
[1:20] you let us pray gracious Heavenly Father
[1:23] we ask thy blessing upon thy word upon
[1:27] this wonderful gathering of people to
[1:31] feed upon the bread of life many receive
[1:36] handfuls of loaves from heaven may man
[1:41] from one high be rained down upon us and
[1:45] to You Father will be all the praise
[1:49] honor and glory for we ask it in the
[1:52] name of Jesus Christ my topic today is
[1:57] our coming god I'm so glad that our God
[2:01] is coming for he is not a god that's an
[2:05] idol on a wall or just a picture in a
[2:10] book or a picture in ur
[2:15] memory but he is a living God and he
[2:21] promised that he would come again and
[2:23] our Lord is returning to the earth again
[2:28] our scripture is found in Revelation
[2:31] chapter 1 verse 7 behold he cometh with
[2:38] clouds and every eye shall see him and
[2:43] they also which pierced him and all
[2:49] Kindred's of the earth shall wail
[2:53] because of him even so amen
[2:59] yes my friends our God is coming he is
[3:03] coming Jesus is coming our great
[3:09] Almighty God this coming in person a
[3:13] prophet is coming our priest and King is
[3:19] coming our mediator is coming we find
[3:23] him the perfect one
[3:25] all in all he Jesus he's coming even so
[3:31] come Lord Jesus
[3:33] completely Lord for the tiny the short
[3:37] Amen yes the scripture says he's coming
[3:42] and he's coming in clouds clouds of
[3:46] glory just as he came on now
[3:50] Transfiguration when his entire person
[3:55] became a bright shining light with
[3:59] clouds around him resplendent glory and
[4:04] power around them unfolded around him he
[4:09] was just wrapped up in the grace power
[4:12] and glory of the Living God and the body
[4:18] that when he comes again every eye shall
[4:23] see him that means that this coming is
[4:28] not the rapture this coming is not the
[4:33] rapture I want to make that clear no
[4:37] this is when he does our Jesus comes to
[4:42] take over all the kingdoms of the world
[4:46] for the Bible tells us that the kingdoms
[4:49] of the world become the will become the
[4:52] kingdoms of our Lord and Christ amen
[4:55] hallelujah and he is king of kings and
[4:59] Lord of lords and every eye every knee
[5:04] shall bow and every tongue shall confess
[5:07] that Jesus Christ is Lord
[5:11] yes our God is coming yes my friends
[5:16] he's coming to take his rightful place
[5:19] of preeminence in the eyes of man in the
[5:24] hearts of man there it is he's coming to
[5:28] take his rightful position and place and
[5:32] as the great perfect world ruler and
[5:37] between his courage second coming and
[5:41] that time Satan of course being a
[5:44] poverty' being a liar being a murderer
[5:48] being Antichrist will produce his own
[5:52] false Christ the Antichrist and trying
[5:58] to make him into a natural world leader
[6:03] to be the leader of one world government
[6:07] that is coming up but the Bible knows
[6:11] all about that and prophecies of
[6:14] prophets pocket that this the kingdoms
[6:18] will become the kingdoms of our Lord and
[6:21] His Christ amen amen
[6:24] forever
[6:25] forever and so yes my friends that this
[6:29] is also the time when he returns when he
[6:34] comes again his second coming when he
[6:38] comes the they who have pierced him with
[6:43] their crease with their traditions with
[6:48] their denominational doctrines they
[6:51] shall mourn and weep and wail and the
[6:56] people shall cry out in terror because
[6:59] of him who is the word that they
[7:04] rejected no we go to Zechariah chapter
[7:09] 12 verses 9 to 14 and that reads
[7:15] according to the Word of God and it
[7:18] shall come to pass my friends that I
[7:28] will seek to destroy all the nations
[7:32] that come against Jerusalem and I will
[7:39] pour out on the house of David the
[7:45] inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of
[7:50] grace and of supplications oh praise God
[7:56] the crowd for salvation and they'll ask
[8:03] supplications of kram to god to hearing
[8:07] answer their prayer and to forgive their
[8:10] sins and it further says and they shall
[8:15] look upon me this is God speaking this
[8:20] is our coming God speaking and saying
[8:24] they shall look upon me whom they
[8:28] pierced they pierced God they pierced
[8:32] them in the side and thank God
[8:37] many now will not accept because the ice
[8:41] let me blind them of their hearts may be
[8:43] covered over the travail but that they
[8:47] they shall see him and they shall we
[8:52] weigh unborn because they're recognized
[8:57] they are rejected the Word of God which
[9:01] they did not recognize as the true word
[9:06] the true bread the gentle Shepherd of
[9:10] the sheep fo the chief Shepherds they
[9:14] failed to recognize who he was at that
[9:17] time him whom they pierced no you'll ask
[9:25] the question will rather silent when is
[9:28] the gospel returning to the Jews now of
[9:33] course when the dispensation of the
[9:38] Gentiles Gentiles is over that is when
[9:43] the gospel light will return back to the
[9:49] jewels I as I have a foreign mention the
[9:53] Sun rises in the east
[9:56] it sets in the west and then it returns
[10:02] back east again to rise again the next
[10:06] morning so the gospel light which came
[10:12] to us in the West came from the east
[10:17] came West and now the West finds itself
[10:23] politically religiously socially in a
[10:29] muck and mire of sin unbelief and
[10:34] rejection of the Word of God
[10:37] and because of this if the mud is
[10:41] written across
[10:43] the corbels the glory is demanded the
[10:47] glory is the part is gone away now and
[10:52] it's going away we find the Holy Spirit
[10:56] is seeping out leaking out of the
[10:59] churches out of religious institutions
[11:03] out of the nations that once accepted
[11:08] him and praise and worship him all my
[11:12] friends and the light of God is going
[11:16] back east again and returning to the
[11:20] Jews now from the signs of the times
[11:25] that we see around us it's just about
[11:29] that time when God's time clock is
[11:33] striking the mid-late out it's a new day
[11:38] dawning upon us a new dispensation is
[11:42] about to begin
[11:44] of course personal rapture let's go one
[11:47] must leave one image must be over one
[11:52] dispensation has to go for the new
[11:56] dispensation will train to come upon the
[12:01] sea and some friends I'll tell you it's
[12:05] about time that certain important events
[12:10] and things begin and the groundwork has
[12:14] been laid now for that to happen so we
[12:19] see according to Revelation 11:2
[12:23] witnesses a revelation prophesied in the
[12:28] Word of God found in revelation 11 those
[12:32] two witnesses are supposed to return
[12:35] these two witnesses will be prophets
[12:39] sent to the nation of Israel of course I
[12:44] believe that those two prophets will be
[12:48] Moses and Elijah you say why
[12:52] brother salmon well how do you know that
[12:55] it's not late written in the Bible how
[12:58] do you know that we understand that
[13:01] Moses is recognized as the Jews Jewish
[13:07] people's she's law giver and Elijah the
[13:13] prophet
[13:14] it is recognized by the Jewish people as
[13:19] their sheath prophet so the two
[13:23] witnesses I believe and identifying the
[13:29] well be Moses and Elijah returning to
[13:35] the Jews for they are about the only two
[13:39] that the Jewish people will accept and
[13:43] believe to be they're genuine by the
[13:48] prophets praise God hallelujah
[13:51] and now we are ready for it for the
[13:56] Gentile dispensation is now on its way
[14:00] out
[14:01] it's traveling out why one age or
[14:06] dispensation is traveling out and going
[14:09] away another one is coming in and there
[14:14] is a kind of overlap and then the total
[14:19] separation will be recognized by that
[14:23] time when some recognize the separation
[14:27] and the living world and the arrival of
[14:30] another would be too late for them they
[14:33] will already have been caught in the
[14:37] Tribulation Period as I mentioned before
[14:40] events around us the Scriptures
[14:43] identifying and telling us by signs that
[14:47] we are now in the pre tribulation period
[14:51] and it's just about to change
[14:54] moving from Jacobs
[14:57] the time of Jacob's sorrow right into
[15:01] the fullness of the Great Tribulation
[15:04] not just turning of trouble but turning
[15:08] of the Great Tribulation coming upon us
[15:12] no the Jews the Jewish people they
[15:21] brought the gospel to us Gentiles who
[15:26] were considered dogs we were considered
[15:30] as nothing but yet God in His grace and
[15:35] in His mercy
[15:37] anointed the apostles of that day in
[15:40] time Peter being Jewish
[15:44] Paul the Jewish and so on now and God
[15:48] use them the Jewish people to bring this
[15:53] glorious gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
[15:56] to us Gentiles here and so we find as
[16:02] the ages and as the dispensation changes
[16:06] so will the Gentiles take the gospel
[16:11] back to the Jews and I believe there
[16:15] were a lot of brothers Christian
[16:17] Brothers of various stripes and
[16:20] denominations some being used at this
[16:24] particular time engage in that great
[16:29] work of God each one has their part and
[16:33] their peace my friends and each one just
[16:37] has to be faithful and do their part so
[16:40] that the work of God can be accomplished
[16:44] now some people are against the taking
[16:46] the gospel to the Jews but I believe
[16:50] it's here in the word that we must take
[16:53] the gospel back to them before the time
[16:57] of course it is not acceptable but now
[17:02] is the coming now is the changing of one
[17:05] of the age now is the
[17:07] season when these things must be done
[17:09] and so the Word of God must the message
[17:14] of the hour in particular must go back
[17:18] to the Jews the gospel light the rising
[17:22] of the Sun must return and rise in
[17:27] Israel again so friends when all this is
[17:33] over the scripture tells us here in the
[17:38] Word of God every eye will see him this
[17:43] as I said is not the rapture it's the
[17:46] second coming of the Lord to the Jews
[17:50] and it says every eye shall see him all
[17:55] friends that means all the Jewish people
[17:59] are going to see him praise God I'm not
[18:03] going to go into talk about the Bible
[18:07] already prophesied in television and
[18:09] internet for back then they would have
[18:12] wondered and the amazed how is every I'm
[18:15] going to see them but we know even if
[18:19] it's not supernaturally even naturally
[18:22] we know that is now possible but it's
[18:26] already here in your Bible those two
[18:30] thousand years ago it was written in the
[18:33] scriptures that all the world will be
[18:38] able to see this one person at one time
[18:43] together it's there in the book and so
[18:46] they every eye is says I repeat shall
[18:50] see so all the Coliseum Ollis only the
[18:57] sleeping virgins also called the remnant
[19:02] of the church will see him now the Remer
[19:06] what is the remnant the remnant are
[19:09] those who lived as Christians heard the
[19:14] word
[19:18] from my friend away from my friends to
[20:22] speak to bring his children to him but
[20:33] of course we recognize that the seed
[20:38] shall not be heir with the shock and we
[20:41] also recognize that if there is no seed
[20:46] planted in the hearts of the individual
[20:51] by the brakes or when when the water
[20:54] former rain falls upon the sea my
[20:59] friends there is nothing there to be
[21:02] born again if there is no scene of God
[21:05] if there is no soul of God that lives
[21:09] will eternal life here there is nothing
[21:12] to wake up oh praise God forever but
[21:16] thank God for election predestined
[21:19] choosing one of them I believe if you
[21:31] trust God you will know for sure that
[21:33] you are one of them
[21:35] and so every eye will see him the Jews
[21:40] will see him this sleeping virgins will
[21:43] see him true tradition true all their
[21:51] Creed's and their dogmas and there
[21:54] similary learning from the world clock
[21:59] twisting the Bible consciously or
[22:02] unconsciously and getting aware of mrs.
[22:05] miles from the truth of the word of God
[22:08] every eye shall see him whether or not
[22:11] or hell you're not
[22:13] our God is coming I'll tell you and
[22:15] every eye shall see him no my friends
[22:20] I'll tell you that there will be at
[22:23] least three groups that will go through
[22:27] the tribulation period 1 I believe the
[22:34] Jews themselves will have to go through
[22:38] the tribulation period for that great
[22:42] nation it will be attainable purging for
[22:46] which I believe because of their
[22:48] national sin of the crucifixion of the
[22:54] Lord Jesus Christ the national sin of
[22:58] not recognizing their Messiah their
[23:03] Joseph who God used among the Gentiles
[23:09] placed him among the Gentiles just to be
[23:13] able to preserve your life but then we
[23:17] find that they will have to go into the
[23:20] tribulation for a purging and cleansing
[23:23] and all by rebel
[23:25] of his divine person to them and by the
[23:29] preaching teaching and testimony of the
[23:33] two witnesses out of them of course
[23:36] welcome the 144,000 for thousands and
[23:43] not deceive you that not bewilder are
[23:46] blind you that the form 144,000 are not
[23:52] Gentiles they are Jews it's written in
[23:58] the book of Revelation and of the tribe
[24:00] of Judah 12,000 of this strike 12
[24:06] and so names the tribes so that not
[24:10] Gentile be deceived into believing that
[24:14] they will be four thousand you as their
[24:31] white father them to be redeemed and
[24:36] brought back to his side born again free
[24:40] from sins
[24:42] what do you know light working in the
[24:45] shining light of the revelation of His
[24:49] divine presence hallelujah glory God so
[24:52] we find also the foolish virgins the
[24:59] women of the church that fail to
[25:03] recognize just first in his presence and
[25:06] the power of his word they will be
[25:18] everyone but they rejected blinded by
[25:23] their personal private interpretations
[25:26] and teachings and creeds and dogmas of
[25:30] man
[25:32] perverted them Oh a misdirect of them
[25:36] away from the genuine Word of God and so
[25:41] friends we understand that their friends
[25:45] that they are the remnant of the church
[25:50] that came up from the seventh church age
[25:55] the leftovers of the seven Church age
[26:02] into the tribulation again for them to
[26:06] be purged from their bodies and their
[26:09] uncleanness of rejecting God's word of
[26:14] that season and time we find friends
[26:19] also the Antichrist group the total
[26:24] Antichrist group that comes right up and
[26:27] said I don't believe in any God I don't
[26:28] believe in Jesus Christ various
[26:31] different kinds of religions that take
[26:34] that approach I don't even want to hear
[26:36] this name they wanna hear about this
[26:39] person or the O so far too soon I accept
[26:42] him as a prophet but better but I don't
[26:45] believe that he is God my friends every
[26:48] eye shall behold him and those that
[26:52] pierced him shallots that time recognize
[26:55] who he is when he comes in his power and
[26:59] his great glory now I told you about you
[27:03] will go through the tribulation but
[27:06] according to the scriptures of it also
[27:08] tells us that the Church of the
[27:11] firstborn will not go through the
[27:15] tribulation period
[27:17] who was this Church of the firstborn who
[27:21] are these it is the lens life it is who
[27:27] we sometimes call the Bride of Christ
[27:31] but what she's married to him but
[27:34] something I believe in his word she
[27:37] becomes the Lambs wife and he in the
[27:42] language
[27:43] permit his wife to go through
[27:46] tribulations so I believe in a
[27:49] pre-tribulation rapture the Bible
[27:53] teaches a pre-tribulation rapture the
[27:58] brain goes up and the and the
[28:01] tribulation comes in this fierceness and
[28:05] to reach reach and the purge my friends
[28:09] those that disbelieves the Word of God
[28:12] now at the same time while there is a
[28:16] time of Jacob's trouble trial
[28:19] tribulation and that very tiny when
[28:23] darkness is upon Israel the light begins
[28:27] to come up the Sun begins to rise and
[28:30] the light of God begins to shine upon
[28:33] them and favor them once again and
[28:36] that's already beginning to happen but
[28:38] the fullness of it cannot be fully seen
[28:42] until the lens wife the what we call the
[28:47] brightest bride is taken out of the way
[28:50] then we find they'll come into their
[28:54] glory and into their power also into the
[28:57] tray of the tribulation the purging as
[29:00] it is and what is going on the Bible
[29:05] tells us God is going to pour out his
[29:08] Spirit upon the house of Israel the same
[29:11] spirit the same Holy Ghost the same on
[29:14] this spirit that men marry Peter Peter
[29:18] John and all the disciples dance and
[29:22] praise God worshiping him speaking in
[29:25] tongues glorifying God in that upper
[29:28] room praise God hallelujah that same
[29:31] holy mouth will come him to anoint the
[29:35] nation of Israel listen to the
[29:39] scriptures and they shall look upon me
[29:43] who they appear and they shall mourn for
[29:48] him as one born for their only Son and
[29:52] there shall be an bitterness for him
[29:56] one that is in bitterness for his
[29:59] firstborn and that day there shall be
[30:02] morning in Jerusalem as the morning of
[30:06] everyone in the valley of megiddo and
[30:09] the lamb shall born every family apart
[30:14] the family of the house of David apart
[30:18] and their wives apart and then the
[30:21] family of the house of Nathan apart and
[30:24] their wives apart and it's one of the
[30:27] houses apart when he comes in clouds of
[30:30] glory
[30:31] my friends at his second coming
[30:35] now the Jewish people think of Pierce
[30:38] him shall see here as it says that he
[30:44] will ask the question whence cometh
[30:46] these ones they'll ask him Messiah in
[30:54] your hands side and this victor says
[31:00] he'll answer from the house of my
[31:03] friends I receive these wounds from the
[31:07] house of my friends what a mournful
[31:12] morning we begin the morning it will be
[31:17] great day when the Jewish people shall
[31:21] tear their clothing trashes upon
[31:24] themselves we were born in the presence
[31:29] of they come in come the coming Messiah
[31:33] none other than Jehovah my god of the
[31:38] Old Testament who became Jesus of the
[31:41] New Testament and they could not
[31:44] recognize that at that time that time
[31:46] for a small said for a bail was placed
[31:50] over their face but when the veil will
[31:53] be taken away
[31:55] we shall see I believe their hour of
[31:58] seeing and coming and recognizing is now
[32:02] hitting upon us listen my friends not
[32:06] only mournful time for the Jewish people
[32:09] but it will be a wonderful thing for
[32:12] those from the Gentile Church Oh friends
[32:19] because they rejected their Savior which
[32:23] was nothing
[32:25] imagination of their mind of the man
[32:27] that was the Prophet and message of a
[32:44] prophet not the Prophet but is message
[32:51] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[32:54] and forever oh what a change that will
[33:01] be within your heart and in your life so
[33:05] the chickens when they recognize them
[33:14] and they were left behind for they
[33:18] recognize their Savior world their
[33:22] Savior message they recognize the
[33:27] defendant recognized or let me say this
[33:32] they fail to see or value the
[33:35] unrecognized presence of their God in
[33:38] their midst in the word form or in the
[33:41] form of the world the only weeping and
[33:44] they'll be wailing the sleeping virgins
[33:47] will wail and you know the sleeping
[33:50] verses virgins you say one day they
[33:53] represent the foolish church as you as
[33:57] you know in the Bible tells of the ten
[33:59] virgins by twice five foolish
[34:02] fight that were wise took the message it
[34:04] took the oily they took the word for
[34:07] their day the Holy Spirit in the lines
[34:10] amen
[34:11] while the others rejected the anointed
[34:15] Word for the hour and that represents
[34:19] them refusing to take the oil for their
[34:22] day they refused to take the oil which
[34:25] is a symbol of the Holy Spirit within
[34:28] their lines their laps friends you know
[34:32] they the holder of the oil until it was
[34:35] too late
[34:36] praise God friends I want you to know it
[34:41] is not that these were bad people there
[34:43] were good people there were merchants
[34:47] which signifies clearly to us they were
[34:50] of a high moral order and they didn't
[34:55] have oil in their lamps so they were
[34:58] cast out and the scripture says there
[35:01] was wailing and gnashing of teeth
[35:07] now remember friends they also which
