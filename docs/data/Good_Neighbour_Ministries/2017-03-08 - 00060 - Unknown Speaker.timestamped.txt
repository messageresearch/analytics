[0:00] thank you Father we pray for those who
[0:03] may be um on their way that we pray
[0:06] you'll protect them Lord Jesus and
[0:10] overshadow the entire church with the
[0:12] grace of God bless us tonight father as
[0:15] we gather together in your name and
[0:18] bring us to the shape you'd like the
[0:21] church to be in we ask it in Jesus name
[0:23] amen praise the Lord God bless you real
[0:27] good the same scripture ABAC 220 and I
[0:30] know it by heart the Lord is in his holy
[0:34] Temple let all the Earth keep silent
[0:37] before him praise the lord it's right
[0:40] over the door as you're coming in right
[0:43] did you notice that it's right over the
[0:45] door and you're coming in and that's not
[0:48] to new only to this church even in the
[0:52] old church we had that sign there uh
[0:56] like that that we should come in the
[0:58] house of God with great re
[1:00] the Lord bless you please bece
[1:04] it we have uh been talking on this
[1:07] subject how to behave in the house of
[1:10] the Lord or our behavior in the house of
[1:13] God which would seem uh Elementary um to
[1:17] those of us who have been in a message
[1:19] for some time but uh like I mentioned in
[1:24] child training or even God training his
[1:27] church uh you'll find it in Deuteronomy
[1:30] numbers Exodus he keeps telling Moses
[1:33] and all the prophets he says repeat them
[1:36] in the ears of your children and your
[1:40] children's children right and you know
[1:43] the scripture we read out in the Book of
[1:45] Psalms in your rising up in your sitting
[1:48] down in your walking remember amen so
[1:53] this is what we are supposed to do so
[1:56] that we will be able to
[1:58] internalize
[2:00] uh what God wants to establish within
[2:03] our hearts until the word becomes an
[2:05] anchor amen right the word becomes an
[2:09] anchor I've gone past talking about just
[2:11] becoming a habit G right it's anchored
[2:13] in your soul becomes a part of you and
[2:17] that's when you really start to live
[2:19] Christianity because you don't have to
[2:20] think about it amen right in the early
[2:23] stages of of Christianity or even coming
[2:25] into the message you have to always
[2:28] remember this rule that rule remember
[2:31] the prophet said this remember over
[2:33] there remember that you always had to do
[2:35] that I had to do that but uh when the
[2:38] message gets a hold of you and the life
[2:41] of Christ begins to project because of
[2:45] your love for God God has already proven
[2:47] his love for us but then we prove our
[2:50] love to him as our love for him becomes
[2:54] really strong and we we begin to walk
[2:57] with him in the word obey BR our husband
[3:01] the word then what happens The Life of
[3:04] Christ begins to project amen IT
[3:08] projects and IT projects without you
[3:10] having to think about it you don't have
[3:13] to walk around with a thought that's
[3:15] that's the realm of dramatic
[3:17] Christianity where it's all of drama uh
[3:20] because you heard the prophet said this
[3:22] because you read over here and said that
[3:24] or the prophet did this or the prophet
[3:26] did that and uh when we were children
[3:29] you you a your parents you copy off of
[3:32] them you do all of that Paul puts it
[3:34] this way when we were a child we we we
[3:36] SP like a child we act like a child we
[3:39] do everything like a child but when we
[3:41] become a man it means mature when we
[3:44] become when we become mature we put away
[3:47] childish things that's right right
[3:50] because you know every teenager uh uh
[3:54] goes into a state of identity crisis
[3:57] right and and and during that period of
[3:59] time you know they have a lot of
[4:02] struggles um and in that period of time
[4:05] they they tend sometimes to be
[4:07] emotionally unbalanced why they're
[4:08] trying to find themselves they're trying
[4:12] to find their personality and their path
[4:16] and while they're doing that they're
[4:18] unsure it's like like if I give you a
[4:20] picture it's like a h if you seen a
[4:23] horse or an animal give birth and a cult
[4:26] stands up and when he stands up or she
[4:28] stands up at first they're kind of shaky
[4:32] you know like that uh and and they try
[4:35] to walk and they're Shakey about it why
[4:38] because they're unsure what life holds
[4:41] they're unsure what they should do and
[4:43] everything else but because there the
[4:46] nature of a horse the nature of that
[4:49] particular animal it walks right into
[4:51] the nature it doesn't have to go
[4:53] practice right it it just walks into it
[4:56] it's the same thing if the life of
[4:59] Christ is in you then it will begin to
[5:02] act like Christ that's right see if a
[5:05] lot of your self is in there or a
[5:07] mixture of yourself Christ will project
[5:10] and then a a little bit of yourself will
[5:12] come out right praise God and it's still
[5:15] does in every one of us and me too
[5:18] because you know you say something
[5:19] you're like wait a minute I didn't mean
[5:22] that I didn't want to be that way it
[5:25] just came out and and you realize that
[5:27] you we all have that brother that sticky
[5:30] thing is going to be with you till you
[5:32] go going Rapture yes but the thing God
[5:35] requires of us is that we keep pressing
[5:37] on to Perfection not that you don't have
[5:41] it in here but for perfect
[5:44] manifestation of that life that came
[5:47] into you right we want to have such a
[5:50] perfect manifestation until they say my
[5:53] goodness she is just like Christ he is
[5:56] just like Christ why because you are now
[5:59] identified with Christ and Christ is
[6:02] identifying himself that yes I'm living
[6:06] in this house amen he's in the house and
[6:10] he's living there and so therefore he
[6:12] makes himself
[6:14] manifested so we're talking about how
[6:17] our how we physically I just mentioned
[6:21] about spiritually behaving in the house
[6:24] of God how how is your soul your spirit
[6:27] manifesting through this body this house
[6:30] that God gave you whether you like it or
[6:32] you don't like it this is the house God
[6:33] Gave You amen praise God and your soul
[6:37] has got to manifest through this house
[6:39] God gave you and and and then uh it has
[6:42] to have a certain Behavior right we got
[6:45] to behave right through this body and
[6:48] not misuse it and not destroy it and
[6:51] everything else you you can run that
[6:53] through your mind and I'm then I'm
[6:55] bringing it back now to the house of God
[6:58] Amen just like when in the Bible uh he
[7:02] was in the house and the Bible said when
[7:05] he was in the house and they knew he was
[7:07] in the house the people gathered onto
[7:10] him they gathered to him onto the house
[7:13] until he was in space praise God and you
[7:16] know the story of the breaking up the
[7:17] roof to let the man in but there we we
[7:22] get we have a little picture of what I'm
[7:24] really talking about of how we should
[7:26] behave in the house of God coming to the
[7:30] house of God is not just a uh that's
[7:32] what makes us different it's not just
[7:34] another church we're walking in here
[7:37] with a revelation that's right we're
[7:39] walking in here knowing that there is a
[7:42] is the great all powerful being of
[7:45] Jehovah God in this
[7:49] place waiting on us so that when we come
[7:52] in here praise God that's why brother
[7:55] Ben said don't worry let it's 2 3 4 10
[7:58] 10
[7:59] god with one man sincere enough is a
[8:04] majority one person Hallelujah set this
[8:08] place of fire why because it's God
[8:11] hallelujah and so when we come together
[8:14] like this in Humble meetings like this
[8:18] you know the greatest things can happen
[8:20] sometimes I've seen them in the simplest
[8:23] meetings and you have great meetings
[8:26] great preaches great this great that uh
[8:29] uh I'm just thinking of uh back in the
[8:31] old country there praying looking
[8:34] seeking God believing God trusting the
[8:36] Lord and uh great Minister came in to
[8:40] have a miracle through saying and uh
[8:44] he's going to pray for the sick and the
[8:46] cripples and and and everything else are
[8:48] going to walk and the blind are going to
[8:50] see and the death are going to hear and
[8:52] everything else and they Place
[8:54] advertisements and then uh as young
[8:57] people what we did when Minister was
[8:59] coming in we would get the b f sprinted
[9:03] up and then we would go down all the
[9:07] streets around that town and hand them
[9:11] out and verbally invite the people uh if
[9:14] they wer home we leave it you know
[9:16] things have changed we know that they
[9:18] call that Ling now right and uh they
[9:21] might even want to have by laws in in
[9:23] the city I Believe In This Very City
[9:25] they have bylaws against you just
[9:27] walking around and sharing stuff stuff
[9:29] like that but back then we could but
[9:32] here's a great Minister coming in and we
[9:35] would be sharing out these flyers and we
[9:38] say oh you should come to the meeting
[9:41] tonight well you know I can't I can't
[9:45] come because uh my leg is all um
[9:48] crippled up and I've been sitting here
[9:50] for the past couple of years and so I'm
[9:53] sorry you know I won't be there he said
[9:56] well well all of you should come and and
[9:59] he said well uh sister why don't you
[10:01] allow us to pray for you said okay go
[10:03] ahead and pray and we would pray for the
[10:07] person I can remember one case clearly
[10:09] the woman couldn't move her arm it was
[10:11] all cred up like that and she could not
[10:15] pick up a cup or do anything so he said
[10:18] all right we prayed for her and he says
[10:21] raise up your hand and that hand that
[10:23] she couldn't raise for many many years
[10:26] she raised it up like that to the end of
[10:28] it she was was able to pick up uh we had
[10:31] this great big um steel pots heavy um
[10:35] forg pots and she picked one up in her
[10:38] arm and they started shouting and
[10:40] screaming and then we turned around in
[10:42] our gopel innocence and saying that's
[10:46] what we're talking to you you talking
[10:48] about come to the meeting and you're
[10:50] going to see things like this going on
[10:53] and we are not even thinking that it's
[10:56] already happening while we are sharing
[10:58] the track
[10:59] you see and the main thing about it is
[11:02] that of course you know it's wonderful
[11:04] we went to the meeting but we didn't see
[11:06] we were disappointed because we didn't
[11:08] see those kinds of things happening in
[11:11] the meeting with this great
[11:13] International evangelist so we were kind
[11:15] of disappointed but the fact is brother
[11:18] and sister when we come together we
[11:20] should realize that in this God always
[11:24] hides in Simplicity amen and sometimes I
[11:27] found that some of the the greatest
[11:30] messages are preached when um it's just
[11:34] a simple service and there's just a few
[11:37] people they don't expect anything
[11:38] particular and then all of a sudden God
[11:40] comes on the scene all of a sudden
[11:42] something happens praise the Lord so now
[11:45] let's not walk by sight let's walk by
[11:49] faith is that right God didn't ask the
[11:52] prophet says it this way he said he
[11:54] didn't ask you did you feel it he asked
[11:56] you did you believe it that's right pray
[11:59] God but you know some people come to
[12:01] church they got to feel something I
[12:03] service they got to feel something I can
[12:06] feel anything you know but it's not if
[12:08] you felt something it's if you believe
[12:10] something amen that's right when I say
[12:12] believe did you get a revelation of
[12:14] something even if it's one thing praise
[12:17] God to be blessed even if it's one thing
[12:20] because the whole Church of God is built
[12:24] by what he said it's by uh precept upon
[12:28] precept precept it's like word on top of
[12:31] word on top of word just like your body
[12:34] is built up by cells word on top of word
[12:37] like you told Joshua I'm not going to
[12:38] deliver you all in one day or one year I
[12:41] could do it but I won't do it unless you
[12:43] think you did it all by yourself but
[12:45] little by little you out and it's the
[12:48] same way God deals with us is little by
[12:51] little he's opening our eyes and is
[12:53] strengthening us so when we first come
[12:55] to Christianity we are like those
[12:57] children spoken up and and uh we're
[12:59] trying to walk we can't find our way
[13:02] then after a while if you watch that
[13:04] little cold the next day you come back 2
[13:07] days later and the thing is
[13:09] running it's running as normal as ever
[13:12] and caring on why because it's it's
[13:16] starting to find its way the nature
[13:19] that's in it to go and that's the kind
[13:22] of Christianity I always uh believe in
[13:27] and and and talk about not the one that
[13:31] you have to literally practice the one
[13:33] that you have to you know but this is
[13:36] one where you're growing into this life
[13:40] you're growing into this life inak over
[13:43] praise the Lord inight you he leads you
[13:46] he he takes you where you're supposed to
[13:48] be amen and and and every day that's the
[13:52] way I believe and that's the where I
[13:53] live that I meet who I am supposed to
[13:57] meet amen is that right I meet who I'm
[14:00] supposed to meet it's not even who I
[14:03] think I should meet maybe I have a I
[14:05] have an appointment and he doesn't want
[14:08] me to make it I don't make it right
[14:10] praise the Lord I don't mean I
[14:12] deliberately don't go or or decide I'm
[14:15] not going but if he doesn't want me to
[14:17] go he'll not let me go and until you get
[14:21] to the place where you understand that
[14:23] God is sovereing over our lives not only
[14:26] over the world but over our lives amen
[14:29] even over your thinking that's right
[14:31] amen praise the Lord you can be wanting
[14:34] to think this in your mind drift off and
[14:36] God thinking something else because God
[14:38] wants something else out of you and
[14:40] until we get to the point where we can
[14:42] surrender to the Holy Spirit and let him
[14:45] have his way and and lead us in his
[14:49] divine order in his divine order in the
[14:54] house of God praise the Lord so um so
[14:58] here we are we touched on the fact that
[15:01] God has given us this wonderful uh
[15:04] building and we've consecrated it and
[15:07] dedicated it to his glory but uh the
[15:10] prophet is expressing God's desire he he
[15:13] doesn't want just a tabernacle like the
[15:16] Jews had in the wilderness but he wanted
[15:20] like Jesus said or in the spirit of
[15:23] Prophecy Samuel said in the Book of
[15:25] Proverbs I think it is but a body has
[15:29] now prepared me right uh what house I'm
[15:32] going to dwell in dwell in the physical
[15:34] building no it's not the physical
[15:36] building even though that the pillar of
[15:39] fire came there he said the glory the
[15:42] glory of the locker house will be
[15:45] greater than that of the former amen cuz
[15:48] that one was wood and gold and and skins
[15:50] but it's us it's human beings we at the
[15:53] last the house that God is living in
[15:56] praise God and so he has prepared us for
[16:00] this hour for this season and for this
[16:02] time amen and we must understand our
[16:06] uniqueness right that we are not here by
[16:10] chance we are not even here by uh our
[16:14] own will alone that's right because your
[16:18] will have to coincide with his will like
[16:22] a man wanted to marry a woman but she
[16:24] has to agree to marry him amen it's the
[16:27] same way our our taking Jesus as our
[16:30] savior is just accepting the choice that
[16:33] he had already made is that right praise
[16:36] the Lord that's all it is so here it is
[16:39] that we are walking in an invisible
[16:42] Union with him praise God hallelujah
[16:46] just about there he's talking about the
[16:47] marriage of a young woman and the young
[16:49] man standing in my office it's like the
[16:52] type of bride getting ready for the
[16:54] ceremony of that day but I carried out
[16:58] here as a loyal minister to Christ as a
[17:01] loyal minister to Christ amen he is
[17:03] bringing getting the bright ready praise
[17:06] God and that's what I'm trying to do by
[17:09] uh bringing this uh kinds of messages to
[17:11] you you say but what is that it's just
[17:14] like when the bride is still uh waiting
[17:17] to come out and she has a maid of honor
[17:22] what does the man of Honor do or let's
[17:24] use the word supposed to do she's
[17:27] supposed to pay attention to every fine
[17:31] detail right not say oh she's dressed
[17:34] already oh she's a Christian oh oh she's
[17:37] already got on the Revelation she's got
[17:39] the wedding dress no that made hna have
[17:42] to watch an even more Finly each detail
[17:46] check that her hair is in place check
[17:49] that her her dress doesn't have any SMUD
[17:52] on it it it doesn't have a rip a tear or
[17:56] or in the front a tread or something is
[17:59] sticking out or whatever doesn't matter
[18:01] to you it is insignificant to you it
[18:03] might be infinite decimal but the fact
[18:06] is that that's the details that uh that
[18:10] made has to come down to and that's the
[18:13] way the preacher has to come down
[18:16] because we're coming to the end of the
[18:18] road hallelujah it's Rapture time it's
[18:22] harest time it's
[18:24] going God is coming Jesus is coming
[18:28] Hallelujah the king the prophet the
[18:30] priest is coming the all and all is
[18:33] coming the person everything is coming a
[18:36] great and Solomon is
[18:38] here praise God hallelujah so that's the
[18:43] reason why that my attention was
[18:46] drawn to touching on our behavior in the
[18:51] Church of the Living God hallelujah
[18:54] knowing how to walk down the aisle
[18:55] knowing what position to take how to be
[18:57] in the right right spot in the right
[18:59] time all that type of thing and so we
[19:02] touch first of all on our our behavior
[19:07] in the auditorium which means the
[19:09] sanctuary here uh praise God brother
[19:12] Bram talked to us told us about it not
[19:15] buying not selling coming in as a
[19:17] consecrated place not a place for
[19:20] murmuring and talking but a place where
[19:23] we worship God Amen dedicate yourselves
[19:27] he talks about entering the sanctuary
[19:30] and keep still is that right keep still
[19:35] when you come into the sanctuary he said
[19:38] when you enter them doors you keep quiet
[19:42] for the sanctuary is dedicated to washer
[19:46] stand outside talk anything you want and
[19:49] as long as you want but when you enter
[19:52] these doors keep quiet listen to him and
[19:57] wait on him praise the Lord you believe
[20:00] that praise God hallelujah amen and now
[20:05] he also spoke about the role of the
[20:07] ushers whether those ushers are made up
[20:10] of deacons trustees or any other
[20:12] brothers that have been appointed to do
[20:14] that he spoke about their role is to you
[20:17] know stand there and see that the
[20:20] children and the people in the
[20:22] congregation go go talking and and
[20:25] interrupting others as he says would
[20:28] want to pray silently in the house of
[20:30] the Lord then he begins to give us a a
[20:34] kind of a template of the order of wash
[20:37] how that the uh atmosphere in the
[20:40] sanctuary ought to be quiet how that
[20:43] like 15 minutes to half an hour before
[20:46] the actual worship starts the uh tape
[20:50] guys or tape uh girls or taping team or
[20:54] media team should be playing soft music
[20:58] soft devotional music music has power to
[21:03] calm the troubled breast so says
[21:05] Shakespeare and the Bible tells us also
[21:10] that uh
[21:11] music according to the Bible can even
[21:14] control Devils that's right amen music
[21:17] Control even our emotions take away
[21:21] depression you know when Saul was
[21:24] depressed and suicidal David played on
[21:26] the heart amen
[21:28] when uh Elijah wanted to get in the
[21:31] spirit he told the young man play on the
[21:34] heart play some music and once he went
[21:37] right into the spirit so music has a
[21:39] powerful effect amen and the use of it
[21:43] in the house of God has a powerful
[21:45] effect that's right that is the reason
[21:47] why in war we find that the tribe of
[21:50] Judah went before you would think they
[21:52] would send the armed men with the sword
[21:54] the pastor will come first with the
[21:56] sword no they sent the mus musicians out
[21:58] first and even in every Army you hear
[22:01] the music coming first and then comes
[22:04] the troops coming behind why because
[22:06] when they hear that music it gives the
[22:09] it that martial music puts that martial
[22:13] attitude into that I don't know if you
[22:15] ever heard it but as a boy I wanted to
[22:17] be a soldier when you heard that music
[22:19] oh my God you want to run behind them
[22:22] and you know follow them and you want to
[22:23] March like them and you want to become a
[22:25] soldier because you hear that drum going
[22:27] [Music]
[22:33] my goodness your chest go your chest if
[22:37] you think you're a general yourself but
[22:39] that's the fact oh Onward Christian
[22:43] Soldiers Maring us to walk to God
[22:47] hallelujah but there it is music has a
[22:50] very important place when the music soft
[22:53] it sets a certain mood and then there's
[22:55] the need of the loud music
[22:58] amen at another time there's a need
[23:02] sometimes for slow music that you will
[23:05] literally disrupt the atmosphere of the
[23:07] Holy Spirit if you were to go play uh
[23:10] fast music and there you can't be taught
[23:14] that you have to be able to sense the
[23:16] Holy Spirit and what it is that he wants
[23:19] at any one particular time there's no
[23:21] course on that that somebody can give
[23:23] you a course on being a worship
[23:25] leader to teach you how to s the Holy
[23:28] Ghost which way the wind is blowing and
[23:30] you follow the wind of God while it is
[23:32] blowing and that is why some people get
[23:35] misunder understand the prophet when he
[23:37] says don't play that bogie bie music in
[23:40] church don't don't you do that they
[23:43] think that you you must not have any
[23:45] music that have any kind of a beat with
[23:47] it you know that's not what he meant he
[23:50] means don't bring rock and roll right
[23:53] don't bring all that kind of music
[23:55] that's out in the world and bring it in
[23:56] the church don't do the talk cuz I know
[24:00] for a fact you I think it's in one of
[24:03] the books but I think it's in the
[24:05] prophet V South Africa brother Brandon
[24:08] was there uh in his Jeep they were going
[24:10] H going to hunt or no they were going to
[24:13] visit some um type of um Nature Reserve
[24:16] preserve and on their way with brother
[24:19] Jackson uh they were passing by and and
[24:22] the prophet said stop stop listen why
[24:25] there was a group of uh natives just in
[24:28] a circle and they had a fire going and
[24:31] they had the drums going and they had
[24:33] you know they have a instrument made out
[24:35] of a hollow tree trunk and they hit it
[24:38] with a size wood like this and it gives
[24:40] off a a a a beautiful sound uh like a
[24:44] drum the s coming out to the two ends of
[24:47] this hollow Uh Wood and uh they were
[24:50] dancing dancing around that that fire
[24:54] and dancing around that fire and brother
[24:58] got out and said why do you want to go
[24:59] there you know he says oh I feel lad and
[25:02] he just went there next thing you know
[25:04] he was dancing with them here was this
[25:06] white man in the middle of nowhere
[25:10] dancing among these natives just like he
[25:12] was a native
[25:14] himself amen praise God and he had
[25:17] himself a good time and when he came
[25:19] back can you imagine just visualiz
[25:21] brother B jumping because those guys
[25:24] don't just stand up and sway like this
[25:27] when you go to Africa you got to
[25:30] move I mean let me tell you the the
[25:33] Presbyterian Church brother coffe you
[25:36] right the Presbyterian Church there
[25:39] behaves even more than some of these
[25:42] so-call Pentecostal churches here true
[25:45] amen I'm not kidding they are full of
[25:48] the life and they just they come serious
[25:51] to have church they're not playing
[25:53] around they come to have church in the
[25:55] house of God so brother have to be
[25:58] jumping pretty
[25:59] high and making some boov that he never
[26:02] made before because he was on the
[26:05] inspiration the holy spirit that if some
[26:07] of us saw him we would think that he's
[26:10] beside himself is that right but the
[26:12] fact is when he came back even the
[26:14] brothers wanted to criticize him and
[26:17] said brother BR why did you go there why
[26:19] were you acting like that he says oh no
[26:21] he said the Holy Spirit Led me there you
[26:24] see they're going to help lions and some
[26:26] of them don't know if they're going to
[26:27] die so are the Lions going to get them
[26:30] and therefore they were praying to their
[26:32] God and their God they're praying to is
[26:36] the same one God this God Mo they call
[26:40] him the wind but it's the same God but
[26:43] they don't know his name yet right
[26:45] somebody has to go and tell them their
[26:48] name his name let them know that that
[26:51] God talking about is Jesus Christ amen
[26:54] but got in the spirit but that is a
[26:57] power of music and worship praise the
[27:00] Lord so one time it can be soft next
[27:02] time it's loud one time it's slow next
[27:04] time it's fast and praise God it takes
[27:07] all of it amen praise God just read the
[27:11] book of Psalms you're going to hear
[27:13] David talking about singing and singing
[27:15] devotionally with the sons of Esa and
[27:18] then you go another place he said Shout
[27:20] with L boys with the Timber on the har
[27:25] and so on like that oh my praise the
[27:28] Lord Shout to the Lord for the Lord high
[27:31] is mighty amen he break the seed in
[27:34] Lebanon Glory God hallelujah so some of
[27:38] the
[27:39] Brethren that only love to have nice
[27:41] soft music only that's good but that's
[27:45] not the whole thing I I don't but I tell
[27:48] you you they're going to have a lot of
[27:49] problems to even being Heaven Heavens is
[27:53] going to be a noisy Place CU I think the
[27:55] Bible tells us that that all everybody
[27:58] in heaven and on earth going to be
[28:00] shouting and hallelujah praise God and
[28:04] their voice is going to
[28:05] be heavier than NRA brother brother uh
[28:10] uh daddy uh were you having a problem
[28:12] sleeping that first night uh with
[28:15] hearing the sound of the falls all night
[28:18] amen praise God you know that's just
[28:21] being in a new place but I'm telling you
[28:23] some of them going to have a hard time
[28:25] when they hear everybody in heaven Earth
[28:28] screaming hosana hosana Hallelujah unto
[28:32] him that SED upon the
[28:34] throne hallelujah praise God forever
[28:37] more amen but then there'll be another
[28:41] time when you come in the service and
[28:44] you're waiting on the Lord and uh you
[28:48] think oh praise the Lord if uh oh my God
[28:51] if the brothers really play the
[28:53] music God is going to speak to us and
[28:55] nothing happens
[28:58] until you get like
[28:59] Elijah where he got a spirit a real
[29:03] Spirit of worship and sacredness in the
[29:06] presence of God and then in that silence
[29:10] it's when he heard a still Small
[29:14] Voice sometimes even in the prayer
[29:16] meeting sometimes we need to get so
[29:19] quiet until you can hear him using the
[29:22] voice of your consecrated Spirit which
[29:25] is better known as using your conscience
[29:28] on the inside that's the rooster that
[29:31] God used to cow to Peter it's not the
[29:33] one that was outside of him it's the one
[29:35] that was inside him and sometime God
[29:37] needs to speak to us from the inside
[29:40] with a still Small Voice praise the Lord
[29:44] yeah and so um he talks about that and
[29:47] how the music should be played and then
[29:49] after that the song leader should come
[29:51] up then the pastor comes on the scene
[29:54] and um then the behavior of mothers with
[29:58] their children and how they should be
[30:00] able to take care of them he mentions
[30:03] about the behavior of young people
[30:05] teenagers passing notes going outside in
[30:08] the dark parking lot sitting in the car
[30:11] and caring on while they should be in
[30:12] the house of the Lord he talks about
[30:15] that in that way praise the Lord amen so
[30:18] we are fully aware that then he goes on
[30:21] to talk about when the service ends
[30:24] talks about when it begins the kind of
[30:26] music should play Atmosphere we should
[30:28] create uh the song leader the pastor
[30:31] comes up brings the word the service
[30:33] comes to an end and when it end the
[30:35] children should not be permitted to run
[30:37] all over the sanctuary and the adults
[30:39] just standing there Hing at their kids
[30:41] across the room screaming back and forth
[30:44] and things like that praise God then he
[30:47] goes on to talk about it that if you do
[30:49] these things spiritual gifts will Begin
[30:51] to Fall among
[30:53] you amen and when they begin to come
[30:56] among you you then there's going to be
[30:58] have to have order even with those gifts
[31:02] praise the Lord that that's another
[31:04] topic uh for another time praise the
[31:07] Lord hallelujah he talks about the place
[31:10] the part of the pastor and the deacons
[31:13] amen and stuff then he can Ends by
[31:16] saying love is always
[31:19] corrective genuine love is corrected see
[31:23] the world has a twisted sense that
[31:25] genuine love are they love is only
[31:30] comforting and love is always
[31:33] compassionate and it's true but that's
[31:36] not all love does it's it's the same
[31:39] personality that Jesus has is both uh
[31:44] tender but then he was tough when he had
[31:46] to Flat a rope and dve those phes out
[31:49] right he he's
[31:52] comforting but he's also
[31:55] corrective that's right he's a
[31:57] he can cool like a dove into his soul
[32:01] and the next moment he roar like a lion
[32:04] or descend on you like a screaming eagle
[32:07] because that's the way his personality
[32:09] is one moment he's the Prince of Peace
[32:13] but then when you break his word he
[32:14] becomes the judge right with the white
[32:17] be yes praise the Lord so love is
[32:21] corrective not only comforting but
[32:24] corrective praise the Lord and that's
[32:26] why of people that trying to raise their
[32:28] kids only by psychology where they tell
[32:30] them all you have to do is just talk to
[32:32] the kid and just make sure you don't
[32:35] raise your voice to a certain extent
[32:37] because you're going to damage them
[32:38] psychologically if you say sit
[32:41] down oh they going to get Spear and they
[32:44] going to you know go off and this and
[32:47] that whatever see but God didn't say
[32:49] that in his word praise God he taught us
[32:52] different love is always corrective
[32:55] praise God you kids you ought to know
[32:58] different adults you need to know
[32:59] different that's the way it is Jesus
[33:02] loved but yet when they were buying and
[33:05] selling he planted ropes and ran them
[33:07] people right out of the auditorium
[33:10] praise God hallelujah kind of a Preacher
[33:13] is that running people out the
[33:15] church my God what kind of a heart is
[33:19] that amen but you see you got a A
[33:22] preacher a real genuine let me not say
[33:24] preacher that's a general term a
[33:27] a genuine Shepherd has to guard his
[33:30] Sheep amen I have to protect you
[33:33] spiritually speaking is that right and
[33:36] if I saw uh somebody walked in here or
[33:42] another sheep walking here
[33:45] um having uh foot and mouth
[33:49] disease right tend to want to run all
[33:53] over the place and then tend to left the
[33:55] chatter talk and stuff like that and and
[33:59] want to put down a a virus of some kind
[34:02] then I have to stop it amen praise the
[34:05] Lord I have to stop it praise the Lord
[34:08] glory to God so that's where it is and
[34:10] sometimes you would not know if the
[34:13] pastor speaks sharp to somebody and you
[34:16] hear it you say oh my God that man don't
[34:18] have love but you don't know what the
[34:20] real back is praise the Lord you see
[34:23] that's why you got to have confidence
[34:25] you have to have confidence just like
[34:27] many years ago when a certain preacher
[34:29] came up not to this platform here but in
[34:32] one of the other the places we were
[34:34] worshiping him stepped on the platform
[34:36] and um I just invited him in because
[34:41] Breen said that he was a good brother
[34:43] and they knew him I didn't know him and
[34:45] uh you know they you know I said okay
[34:47] I'll go along with it let him come along
[34:49] but while he's talking talking all of a
[34:52] sudden I know he's a homosexual right he
[34:55] didn't have the outward Behavior if you
[34:57] think it's by sight it wasn't by sight
[35:00] cuz you didn't have no outward Behavior
[35:01] this was a preacher in this message and
[35:04] so later on I had to you know um deal
[35:07] with it and so um some of them were
[35:10] saying oh brother you can't tell that
[35:12] man this you can't say that but where's
[35:14] your proof I don't need any proof I
[35:17] don't need physical proof I know and if
[35:20] you have confidence you are to have
[35:22] enough confidence even if you had a
[35:25] thought brother br not sure you just
[35:27] shut up don't say nothing let the thing
[35:29] play out then you're going to know
[35:30] whether it was God or it's not God so so
[35:33] when I spoke to JY and he he say well
[35:36] how dare you say this and that other I
[35:37] said well if you if what I'm saying is
[35:39] not true you have the opportunity to
[35:42] embarrass me right now yeah you have to
[35:44] embar to expose me right now that what
[35:47] I'm saying is false why don't you do it
[35:50] no you wouldn't do it definitely would
[35:51] do it because he knows different and
[35:53] praise the Lord and and later on of
[35:56] course the police C him and he was in
[35:57] jail and stuff like that but the fact is
[36:00] you got to have confidence listen and
[36:02] I'm going to wind this down
[36:04] now brother Brandon conord Doctrine in
[36:08] respect to the order of the church we
[36:11] have tried to go according to what we
[36:14] understand the orders given at the
[36:17] dedication of the church praise the Lord
[36:21] and by doing so some of the people have
[36:24] gotten mad at us
[36:27] and even left the
[36:29] church and others still in the church
[36:34] will not listen to anything we
[36:39] say and especially about their
[36:44] children we have talked to the parents
[36:47] about their children and they W take
[36:51] care of them now brother BR have we
[36:55] misunderstood you
[36:58] are we going about it in a wrong
[37:01] way thank you now
[37:05] brothering Hallelujah in respect to the
[37:08] order of the church we have tried
[37:09] according to the way we understand that
[37:12] is
[37:12] correct you are doing what is
[37:16] right this is supposed to be done by the
[37:20] deacons I suppose for that's the
[37:23] Deacon's job amen
[37:27] now you say people have often gotten mad
[37:31] at
[37:32] us Brothers they get mad at me
[37:35] [Music]
[37:37] too I'm sure they were mad at him with
[37:40] some of those messages he used to preach
[37:42] now we take it ordinary and simple but
[37:45] you you can imagine in those days when
[37:47] he was preaching those messages my
[37:49] goodness they said sometimes he'd walk
[37:52] into a church and by the time he stepped
[37:54] to the pulpit half the congregation run
[37:56] out the back door but on they when they
[37:59] hear the neighb of the preacher random
[38:00] and they know some of the doctrines he
[38:02] preach out the door they run right like
[38:05] that so you can imagine so now here it
[38:08] is a
[38:10] person that does that there is something
[38:15] wrong with that person that's
[38:18] right that person is not right with God
[38:23] for the spirit of Christ is subject
[38:27] to the teaching of Christ or Christ
[38:29] teaching in Christ's house and by
[38:33] Christ's
[38:34] order and any man or
[38:37] woman or any persons or children that
[38:41] would get angry with a Godly Deacon or
[38:46] any parent that would get angry with a
[38:50] deacon really we want everybody in this
[38:54] church that we can get but if that
[38:57] person would only cause trouble
[38:59] somewhere else there's a thorn or a
[39:02] rabbit in the wood pile and that person
[39:06] isn't right that's right amen and if
[39:10] they
[39:11] leave there's only one thing to do let
[39:15] them leave let them go and pray for them
[39:21] praise the Lord what he's talking about
[39:24] here after the deacons and the pastor
[39:26] with every possible effort and that
[39:30] person still will not obey the dictates
[39:35] of
[39:36] the Bible and the
[39:39] church then the prophet said let them go
[39:43] praise the Lord amen you don't want
[39:46] anybody to go but if somebody's going to
[39:50] come in here and start to create any
[39:52] problem then we have to settle it sorry
[39:58] um another preacher visited the church
[40:01] one time and visiting the church and
[40:03] praise the Lord and you know how I
[40:06] sometimes step out there and I'm shaking
[40:08] hands and while I'm shaking hands all of
[40:10] a sudden I just felt myself pulled and
[40:14] there's a preacher talking to a Believer
[40:17] and that believer is still in the church
[40:19] not here tonight but still in the church
[40:21] still a member of the church and
[40:25] um
[40:27] I just felt to walk over so I walked
[40:29] over and I said to the to the believer
[40:32] of this church I said um so what are you
[40:36] all talking about and the preacher just
[40:38] said well I'll be just talking about the
[40:40] Lord I said I'm not speaking to you
[40:43] sorry brother but I'm not speaking to
[40:45] you I'm speaking to this sheep of mine
[40:48] and said well brother you know uh he was
[40:51] just telling me that there's a need for
[40:54] a lot of Bibles in this country certain
[40:57] country and that there $20 of peace and
[41:00] you know if I could make a donation for
[41:02] 200 of those Bibles 200
[41:06] Bibles 20,000
[41:09] piece and yet when I walked up he said
[41:12] it's not we just talking about the Lord
[41:14] so I just turned around and
[41:16] said you're a
[41:19] liar and here you are you know trying to
[41:23] do this with this innocent person and
[41:26] you have them under pressure and I just
[41:29] walked out without knowing anything but
[41:31] the Holy Spirit made me walk out here to
[41:33] take this person out of this the
[41:38] clutches
[41:40] right so then I just call the deacons
[41:42] and said this pre is not to come back
[41:45] here if you see him tell him to leave
[41:49] don't even let him on the property he's
[41:51] not even honest enough and not even
[41:53] sorry enough to repent right there and
[41:56] there trying to hold out so I'm saying
[41:59] that sometimes you might even
[42:00] misunderstand me right um it's gotten to
[42:06] um another time where in the middle of
[42:09] preaching we have to ask the preacher to
[42:11] step down some some people got annoyed
[42:14] they didn't understand but it's because
[42:16] I have to deal not just with looking at
[42:19] faces but I'm dealing with
[42:21] spirits and there spiritual warfare
[42:24] going on all the time not you're just
[42:26] used to the regular thing that's one
[42:29] thing but it's another thing when
[42:30] somebody uh tries to or at least
[42:34] operates a little bit with the Holy
[42:35] Spirit on them it's a different matter
[42:37] Al together so you got to have some
[42:39] confidence so that these things can work
[42:42] in the church they can't work in the
[42:44] church unless U you have confidence like
[42:49] the angel said to brother if you can get
[42:51] the people to
[42:53] believe
[42:54] you amen amen praise the Lord a man gets
[42:58] into the word and then you start having
[43:01] confidence that there's something
[43:03] operating around there it's not the man
[43:06] but you sense there's something working
[43:08] there and whatever that is I believe
[43:10] it's God then you want to tap into that
[43:14] and allow the Holy Spirit the liberty
[43:16] and the freedom to move and to operate
[43:19] praise the
[43:20] Lord so any person that will get mad
[43:24] praise the Lord hallelujah oh my glory
[43:28] to God get
[43:29] angry then if they leave there's only
[43:33] one thing to do let them leave let them
[43:36] go and continue to pray for them praise
[43:40] the Lord you don't just let them go but
[43:43] you continue to pray for them that
[43:45] somewhere along the line God will change
[43:47] their thoughts God will reveal to them
[43:51] and turn their hearts back from their
[43:54] backslid condition
[43:56] amen praise the Lord and some of you
[43:59] deacons after a while may even want to
[44:03] go to their house
[44:06] sometime and find out why really they
[44:10] left and ask them what was wrong because
[44:14] you know sometimes somebody argue with
[44:16] the Deacon over some little frous thing
[44:19] but that that might not be the real
[44:21] problem it may be just the front for an
[44:24] excuse to leave because they are
[44:26] burdened with some other problem inside
[44:30] of the church that they didn't want to
[44:31] talk about and so sometimes it's
[44:35] necessary for the deacons to go and meet
[44:38] the person in the privacy of their own
[44:41] home and there maybe they want they'll
[44:44] open up and say you know this brother
[44:47] this and that the other I I don't go
[44:49] there anymore because of this sister
[44:51] didn't me that or this one say that or
[44:54] whatever uh and then real problem comes
[44:57] to the surface why sometimes they were
[45:01] acting up mad at the Deacon really we
[45:05] want everybody in this church that we
[45:07] can
[45:08] get amen find out why they left see if
[45:12] we can reconcile and then if they can't
[45:15] then go back taking two or three
[45:18] Witnesses with
[45:19] you uh that they might be understood
[45:23] then if they can't be understood and
[45:26] stole before the church after then they
[45:29] are not a member here of the church
[45:32] anymore praise the Lord see you take two
[45:35] or three Witnesses because as spiritual
[45:38] as you might be as literate as you might
[45:41] be listening to that person as one man
[45:44] even a
[45:46] deacon listening to them it's possibly
[45:49] you can miss something possibly you can
[45:52] miss a sign you miss a discernment missp
[45:56] picking up on the person's Spirit or
[45:59] they cry for help or something else and
[46:03] so bringing a witness or another witness
[46:05] the second
[46:07] time they may be able to pick up on
[46:10] something that you
[46:12] miss because when two walk together it's
[46:15] stronger than one right and that way
[46:18] they are able to see things from a
[46:20] different perspective we are human
[46:23] beings and sometimes we locked in uh um
[46:26] on a certain person and we see them in
[46:28] one
[46:29] light and then it's hard sometimes for
[46:32] you to change that
[46:33] image right hard to change that image
[46:38] and sometimes it takes another person
[46:41] completely unaware and unconnected to
[46:45] step in and look with a clear innocent
[46:49] imp partial View and then say Oh what
[46:53] about this what about that oh my
[46:55] goodness I I didn't see that I didn't
[46:57] think about that praise God so God has a
[47:00] system set up where it will go from one
[47:03] to two or three Witnesses and then if
[47:06] they continue uh then you bring it to
[47:08] the church and make it um uh make it
[47:12] public in other words you're shielding
[47:14] and protecting them so that they can
[47:17] reconcile rather than spreading it
[47:20] through the whole church and making the
[47:23] person ashamed or embarrassed to come
[47:24] back to church M right so that's what we
[47:28] have to do in every possible way praise
[47:31] the Lord h
