amen hallelujah this is a this is such a great opportunity not because brother Machop gears or any difficult is up here but this is a great opportunity to come into the house of ornaments and time and understand what cottage really done when we understand what God is really done and what he has really given us to become a mentor is powerful and then we start to feel of what his purpose really is that's why we come to church not to be a spectator Amen we come here to expect from not here to think about what we're going to do after church what we're going to do tomorrow what we're going to do later on if you're coming here you want your spectator and you want to think of those things you better off to leave because those who come here the water rotten quicker if they're not expecting for God to speak to them and exchange them amen amen that's why we come here to be changed or you just coming out of tradition brother Luther said he said say you don't care how religious you are or how much good church attendance you gotta you pay your tithes if you don't have that life if you're not coming out anyhow not meet the resurrection well we got that opportunity to come into the house of

God Wednesday night we didn't finish it we're gonna continue my god added another just to enrichment like he always does amen we got to scripture readings Matthew 21 18 that includes 6 9 we're nothing to rush this morning I don't want to feel anxious I just want to be great where he wants me to be amen so in the name of Jesus Christ but every sphere every form comes subject to the word by the authority us by message this morning the authority of a school to see work McBride authorities had heard amen thank you lord now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and he set out to it let no fruit growth on the head sport for ever and presently the fig tree withered away and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how soon is big tree withered away jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if ye have faith and not ye shall not only do this is everybody listening which is done to the fig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea it shall be done those are his words all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive and when you he had come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said but what authority doest thou these things and who gave these authority starting to Luke 6 9 amen by what authority and who gave these this authority amen what did they were living a lot of day we're living are these just 2000 years ago what's been prophesied when the bride reads the scriptures in this day what has been spoken already do we know like the scripture says my people perish for lack of knowledge really done in this day and age we really love God as good as they teach what has been spoken these scriptures come alive to you and reveal to you who you are Luke 6 9 when Jesus went with them and when he was not far from the house a Centurion of the Senate print to him saying unto Him Lord trouble not thyself for I am not worthy that thou should enter under my roof wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come on too deep is another jet that the bride of Jesus Christ but see in a word and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having with under me soldiers and I say unto one pole and he goeth and another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when Jesus heard these things he marveled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel amen pray father thank you for your words a day Lord your words that we just read the word that was been delivered the word is alive again made flesh in the bride of Jesus Christ Walker as we gather together the Lord speak to us a little while Lord speak my lord speak my lord speak into the hearts of your people father men it cannot do this the Lord you said it yourself question blood has not revealed it education of my spirit has revealed it father comment reveal your word is the hearts of your brides a day showing who she is and who you are father grandfather take everything subject to the Word of God today Lord watch this under the precious blood that we sin bind every contrary spirit of a double spirit everything will see a spirit father greatest succor to the word father as we commit ourselves to deal it your angels in can't bother and then you're dinking lived it up and glorified in Jesus name god bless your seated amen the authority of the spoken seed Word of God Jesus say here if you had faith and doubt you should not believe do this which was done to the fig tree but also used to sing up to this mountain be thou removed and cast in the sea and it shall be done and we see the the Gentile I see it is unworthiness to the Word of God recognizing the authority recognizing by faith who this man was and said Jess speak just say and my service shall be healed she did not only recognize Jesus but he recognized the authority that Jesus had and recognize that he was God in flesh and that's what we are here today recognizing that God is in flesh and the word is becoming flesh again what a transition but you don't come to this place you know come to this position overnight as we talked on Wednesday amen Chrissa harvest time there's a lapse in time of sees of the word not amen and if we don't plant those seeds of the word of God in us field got hearts right on top of the roof amen and Charles up contrives to be an adult he tries to do certain things and it always messes it up and that's the same process that we do in our box amen that sow the seed in into our hearts and it takes time for harvest we have to wait for the harvest that come to maturity a melody was spoken and done when the Prophet was here well here we are [Music] [Music] this is the English you need to meet Christians who believed US intervention in their lives but we're being frustrated with our results is because they are missing the see conception they know God's work in mark form the word pot three parables Illustrated that the worker is to the kingdom of God by the natural seed is to the artists first these parables and the stories of the sword is the key to unlocking mark 4:13 and we don't understand these truths Jesus said you won't understand without parables they are baby like cheese and truthfully these parables but one fact must be understood to get a full benefit of his teachings the Lord uses the the word to the law of nature that is not changeable not an administration of men here's what I mean you get cheese or nearly all systems in this world that man created the legal system can be beaten let the guilty go free our education system can be beaten past the students that really didn't earn or learn the material but you can't change seed time and harvest I see the sea and cry you see a lot of people talking about the material the message the word of God we preach the Torah to review to chase after you [Music] there's a Mary she was predestinated vessel before the foundation of the world she was prophesied she was prophesied a year six eight hundred years before and here's what a predestinated vessel and the angel of the word came to her amen because she was the one who spoke something that wasn't real that wasn't natural to the human minded and to this life and to what we're talking about we believe she received it by faith she received it they don't think old shall overshadow you you see they need to his plant seed to bring forth the Word of God the big part the holy seed of God inside of her and what does she do you say I know nothing right that's true nothing but the Word of God yeah amen plant seed in the ground that has all bunch of tears in it and it's not going to do it you got to get rid of the tears you gotta get rid of it a real farmer will tell you that's what you got to do both of the ground farm is progresses we don't wanna knock ourselves but you got the tie here before you can get there amen there's a waiting time if a partner wakes up til he sees his neighbor reaping the crops before he sold crops repels pasta see requests are how justified we're not so the seed at the proper time he will not read a clock Laurinaitis the law see seedtime and harvest time cannot be violated Romans 8:19 for the purpose expectations of the creatures waited for the manifestations of the sons of God all is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God in evil and violence and all these things I've accomplished I'd be fulfilled on the earth increased and increasing [Music] we're possess look up the word possessed by work we're possessed by the seeds that were sown in our hearts amen work possess fun under the harvest time of the seed Brooklyn there's power in that she like that was releasing this baby to never be changed you transport food what could become fuller question you see not everyone simply from Sweden here today it's not our game everybody amen but those who are given to know the mysteries of God it's given to you to know Jesus didn't play Church with the fearsome sizes look at this life he came to bring forth the word came to manifest the worthless nothing amen he didn't he didn't not compromise with the churches out there you compromise their teaching you know like we do amen and even brother Brown you know he was with how many times the angel had the same thought say those things those because he's human amen those who believe that he wasn't human he was human but the word God decided the Word of God rest aside in which her excitement amen hallelujah like it is with us amen hallelujah that's why the Lord compared his ways and his works to asine there's a dirty enticing process to be germanized they've been the Word of God in your life that it takes time and it cannot be avoided in the second error while I'm our Lord Jesus said in verse 26 29 so was the kingdom of God in the bench see into the ground and they should sleep the drives night and day and the seed should sprint and roll up he knoweth it not for the dirt created for food of herself first the blade in here and not there the full court appeared but when the fruit is brought forth immediately in put forth stiffly because the harvest is come the seed Word of God verse 14 that ground is our hearts our hearts were created by God to bring forth fruit when his work is planted and there as the seed has to remain in the ground over time to germinate - upon the Word of God Jesus said in John 15:7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you the holy spirit the designer that's what this thing is a complete surrender hey don't lose your like there you go Lords of God be praised for be sinks so I get what's up what's in my heart amen what happened to a sea did you plant in the garden digging up each morning it was it would not and never really screwed you just gotta have faith that the sea is doing what God created to do develop into me and show me something I place it in the good ground in the good ground you can I keep that crown good all the time like we said Wednesday night anything because those things are distorting around me as Gigi said and the see with the heart and it will not take root and if it doesn't take loopers the office there's no manifestation of what the word says and revealed in your life - man it's impossible what you've got - the bride of Jesus Christ she believes this I don't have to convince her this year his feet but she's convinced but illegals Amen hallelujah some people put the Word of God in their hearts for one or two days they don't we'll see you see through almost weekly think up what through their words and their asses boy yeah outcomes and the Bible say that we were a goddess Oracle's forth and so sees the devil let's not forget what happens the devil comes immediately and tries to steal the seat when God's trying to change you deliver you do something in your life that's wrapped into amen the death will bring some circumstance some try some emergency upon our life to get to distract the Committee on what God has revealed to you and try to steal it away from you all these things but a mature believer comes to a place of maturity government he had to tell us number at the end no matter what he was stable pops away my brothers and sisters all these things that you so love cherish in your life and then this right here on your materialism on your fancy clothes like your money in your bank [Music] [Music] there's different stages of glory to God brothers and sisters amen Blake the ear full quarter this one awareness original seeds are the paths talking here there's three different kinds of seeds that were planted and the denominational Billy Graham he was the head planter for Roberts and the cost and Augustus seed has been planted a common organization now and in the word has been [Music] that's why we say because this is [Music] in Revelation over to you Billy Graham or Roberts Pentecost all these things up their newsfeed out the back find a new artist a major ten bucks here revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come you see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word by proven she has the spirit and every Church days we hear these words even happier let me hear what the Spirit says to the churches the Spirit gives the word and you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age you were here you're not the Spirit of God you were here the word for your age you will recognize you recognize you the conversation what it said even reduce what as for the crop to produce this returnees come the bride raises up and recognizes who she is more more so coming to that maturity and see that and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and the groom and he you see but when he did everything even proven by raising himself from the dead outdoors then felt the bride have to do the same thing raised from the dead after being a safty what the word said she would be these last days you supposing she has to be exactly what the word you say gonna be you can't take the word of God and change it [Music] [Music] myself we have to begin with the word set if you don't see yourself living not that's what the word says then go back and check your experience or you need to be born again because you cannot see you cannot respect in the kingdom of God and that's you're born again amen we're preaching to the blind Jesus Christ not leaves where the preaching like so many churches around here and this last day is to become what God said she's gonna be and she sits over that anointed Jesus of that ministry under that water become I said she's gonna be they said to Mary you're gonna concede she wanted that baby she expected that baby died today she testified Jesus Christ walked here walking it again what because the scene that pure scene by a prophet Enoch by an angel has spoken into my heart over the years and believed and believe regardless of unbelief gods of death because of this fight [Music] [Applause] [Music] it takes Oh God and just start out amen rejoice with me amen okay my brothers and sisters it's already too supported by the Spirit of God it's already been done [Music] [Music] [Applause] that's [Laughter] [Music] relieves us the bride believes that Jesus Christ their whole life is gonna live inside the party she has both expected world Jessica thought of the Tesla reasoning of her own just another why because the Spirit of God the Word of God by the night takes a lot of horses all that's how this pushes coming subject to the Word of God that she cannot send me hey have no sin we deceive Here I am to see a God sons and daughters of the Living God coming to this arc again the matter hallelujah things are flexing again before - back baby back God made a promise to Abraham what was that promise the promise of Revelation to this bride of Jesus Christ the see too many seeds but to one seed particular scheme a peculiar see that he will open up our understanding amen that's a feed seat they may give it to all believers therefore the seat of God in us is indestructible [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are [Music] [Music] [Music] do the same to their stuffing their character your attitude your motives here in Texas for the back to the Word of God and then you release yourself don't understand you release yourself in these Nazi you release the Lord Jesus there's a big pull of the Word of God here today keep going why drop dead stuff you pray for me afterwards it's not easy after Wednesday night service there there's such a poll on the Word of God create us ignore that the people appraiser thinks that's all getting testified afterwards but I've been through my tree you know what that's my privilege why you get up here God can use me
