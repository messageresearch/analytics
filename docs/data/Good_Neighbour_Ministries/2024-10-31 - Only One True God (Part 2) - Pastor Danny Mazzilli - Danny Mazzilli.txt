every one of you tonight I took a little uh drink of water in there and it went down the wrong throat down the wrong side it's going to take a minute praise God but um so we're here Wednesday night it's a Bible study night amen amen and so um we're going to we're going to stay on the uh the same uh topic that we started there a few weeks ago on the Oneness of God and so um we will get started right away praise God Wednesday nights our Bible study so we want to study the word we want to look at aspects of the word of God that helps us to better understand um if we don't know the god that we are serving in and by revelation then we will miss the element um which includes our part in the word of God and why it is that we serve this God that we know as the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so um before uh we go to the word let's just pray father we just appreciate Lord this opportunity to minister your word once again and to search the scriptures for you said within them we think we have eternal life and Lord we want to make sure we want to make certain what it is that we believe father and Lord I know there's a great controversy around this very subject because many believe Lord that there's a trinity that there's three in one but we ask you tonight Lord to come and bring Clarity to your word so that we can know assuredly who it is that we serve and that the revelation of your spirit the purpose that you had in revealing yourself and why it is so important for us to know you in this way father Grant it tonight Lord open your word unveil yourself we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and Lord remember uh the saints that are not well tonight Lord that you would raise them up father remember brother Tim um with this situation with his tooth father may you just move on the scene and and Quicken that whole situation for him Lord remember Sister Sheila elanga Lord that's um uh in the hospital even now Lord uh because you made a way for her to have a special special procedure Lord that will um literally put this sickness and this this demon because we know that all sickness is of the devil and Lord to put this thing finally completely out of her life and so we ask that your spirit and your anointing will move over her and the doctors that will be doing this critical surgery upon her oh God Lord take control you be the great physician in the midst of her situation and Lord let her come back with a tremendous testimony of your goodness and your grace Lord and how you interceded in her life father the enemy is fighting but greater are you Lord we commit her into your hands and we ask your blessing now in Jesus name amen you may be seated there let's just read the word quickly before you were seated uh bring up the first scripture 1 Timothy 3:16 Says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh God bless you may be seated amen praise God what a tremendous mystery that God would um you know have this amazing Plan of Redemption and that he would include us in that plan so that we could know him in the power of his resurrection that he um having this tremendous plan would have to come into human flesh and you know we're not going to get into um you know uh everything that's in my mind right now with respect respect to this very thought because I believe the Lord is leading me into a message um you know maybe in the next couple weeks but God in the beginning had a plan to be a savior and to be a redeemer and to be a Healer and that plan was all put into his was all in his mind and he wanted it all to be expressed here down on the earth and so his plan of becoming flesh when he was thinking of this whole plan we were there we were a part of that plan we were in his mind and this whole Plan of Redemption included you and that you would be a part you would be an attribute that would be expressed at a certain time time and season to where you would become the word for your day am amen and that's why it's so important to understand who God is because when you place him outside of of your understanding and you take man's interpretation or man's Doctrine on it you've placed yourself outside of him but when you when you uh come to a place place where you've recognized Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry and that you were actually included in his thoughts and in his mind it brings you into a complete different personal relationship with God to where you start to understand why you are a Christian and what is the true experience of being Christlike because that's what the word Christian means and so there there's a there's there's an unveiling of God's thoughts and God's plan that included you and the Very fact that you are an attribute of God makes you a part of God and your time that you come into your part in recognizing the word is because you've actually come into the very thought that he had of you before the foundations of the world the very thought in the way that he saw you coming to the word in this time and in this season and then you start to manifest Jesus Christ in your life that's the true definition of a Christian is when they manifest the word they manifest Christ amen praise God and so um you know it's a it's a wonderful thing when we uh Truly Come into that understanding let's go to the next slide we wna we want to focus here on who God is and the Oneness of God in Hebrews chapter 7 verses 1 to4 it says for this MDC king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace now now this is what I want you to see here without father without mother without dissent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God AB abideth a priest so here he is making very clear here this is in the New Testament the book of Hebrews Paul's talking here here and he's making very clear here who this MDC is it was God it was God that came down to meet Abraham to make himself known and to show that that that he was making a promise to Abraham into his seed that he would inherit the earth and that he was an actual Son of God Amen and here it was mzc it was God that come down in his theop form one like unto the Son of God so how could he be like unto the Son of God he was God MDC was God am it was God coming down for the first time to meet with man in human flesh man that was in human flesh and he was he was he came he he with Abraham he ate with Abraham they they they drank and they ate together amen it was showing that God could actually move between Dimensions that God could come from his his uh position as the almighty God the the the Elohim the self-existent one that he could express himself into the form of a man and sit and talk with Abraham amen amen and and abideth the priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of his spoils see Abraham had a revelation that he had met God Abraham staggered not at the promises of God he knew that this was the creator of Heaven and Earth he had come into a relationship and and here he was talking lip to ear to God Amen God was showing that he was going to reveal himself make himself known unto man and that he was going to come and re and and redeem man amen let's go to the next slide so here mzc when Jesus was listen to brother Bram says when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament look he's talking about Jesus manifesting in the Old Testament in a theophany in the person of MDC Jesus was and is God from the very beginning right to the very end not a priesthood but the person the man see for this man had yet not been born but he was in a theophany so he had no father no mother he was God himself amen praise God he was manifested in the form of a man called King of Salem which is king of peace and king of righteousness see he was MDC he had neither father nor mother nor beginning of days nor ending of Life see it was Jesus in a theophany in the form of a man could you go that amen so question how did God ever become our savior because you know they believe that there's there's there's there's a trinity and that there's God the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit so how many saviors is there just one there's only one savior just one amen did we have two saviors Jesus came upon the when Jesus came upon the Earth no Jesus Jehovah Savior Jesus means Jehovah Our Savior amen it was God made flesh come down to become a man so that he could go to Calvary to take our place and make the sacrifice amen so listen to Isaiah 4310 and 11 it's very clear right here before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after me it doesn't say us does it say after us no it says after me I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior oh this is back in the Old Testament but I thought Jesus was our savior no God is Jesus am Jesus is God that's why when philli went to Jesus and he says oh Lord show us the father he says Phillip have I not been with you so long if you see me You' seen the father it's I that that speaketh to thee amen praise God next slide why did he need to become a man why did God have to become man and almost All Things Are by the law purged with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins God had to come and become man so that he could go to the Cross as a man because a man sinned a man died God could not change his Plan of Redemption God could not change his ways he's the same yesterday today and forever everything that he expressed in the Garden of Eden when he expressed it through Adam and Eve that was all a a shadow of what was to come that's why when Abel was born and made the acceptable Sacrifice by taking a lamb and shedding the blood of that Lamb on the Altar and offering it unto the Lord is because he received a revelation from God what was required and knew that it would have to be the Lamb of God that would come down the road to shed his blood and to take our place so that we could be restored back into our rightful position as Sons and Daughters of God so it's just to make clear here that's why he had to come and become man because blood had to be sacrificed amen that's why the Jews they always brought Lambs doves goats uh and Bulls they they they had to sacrifice something had to die in order for for for for sin to be to be covered it was only being covered because it was all a type they were showing that they would bring the blood at bring it to the Altar and that lamb they would lay their hands upon that lamb and the priest would slit the throat of that lamb and the life would come out of the lamb and the innocence of the Lamb would would cover the sinner that would bring the lamb and that would be a covering for their sin but Jesus Christ when he came when God came he came as God and he he he wiped away our sin amen he took it and and and when when he went to the cross and he died you were still in him amen let's move along here and so God became human God is a spirit he had no hands till he become Jesus he had no feet arms legs and so forth till he become Jesus he come to a stable born over a manure pile and little Jehovah Crying In A Manger little Jehovah playing as a boy little Jehovah toiling as a man he crossed his cast with us God became human when Jesus Christ was born God was human on earth he toiled and labored and felt for the teenager he went through every Temptation that we go through God did it that he might do his own judgment Justice he swore by no one else but by himself he said I am going to take care of this I am going to redeem I am going to be the healer I am going to be their savior amen praise God if it wasn't for that we would be lost God became human amen and that great Creator became my savior come down to a little blood cell not through a man but come virgin to a woman and took this little pollen from the woman and formed himself a little house and lived in it oh it ought to be striking Jehovah over a pile of manure in a barn crying Jehovah in a Manger of straw that's an everlasting sign praise God listen to Isaiah 996 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace who who are they talking about here they're talking about the Lord Jesus they're talking about God the the Everlasting father but I thought Jesus was the son no he was expressing himself God condescended himself and came down to become human flesh amen but he's still God it's all God in the Plan of Redemption amen praise God let's move along he just used Mary as an incubator but the child belonged to God yeah he was the creator of both egg and hemoglobin God created both amen and the hemoglobin of course come from the male sex and he was the creator of that and Mary was brought this baby without any sensation no more than the Holy Ghost overshadowing her and creating in her womb this blood cell and egg that brought forth the man Christ Jesus Mary was an incubator she was only a carrier Mary is not the mother of God they want to call Mary the Mother of God God cannot have a mother we just read the scripture that said that MDC was without mother without father without beginning and Without End so how can the Savior have a mother no God wanted to create himself a human vessel that had to come flesh and blood so that it could go to Calvary Flesh and Blood God can't die God could not go to Calvary he needed himself a body to go to Calvary amen and that's why he created himself and it's a type when that when he went to Mary he was showing to Mary the actual way that he could bring forth sons of God because we bypassed our theophany body back in the Garden of Eden listen what do you think Satan was doing when the serpent who was Satan went to Eve and spoke to her and said you can be like God you see Satan had tapped into what God was going to do Satan was there and could hear God speaking to the attributes of God speaking about this Plan of Redemption telling them hey you you're to go down to the Earth and you know you're going to go into a spiritual Amnesia you're going to forget me but but I'm going to be your savior I can imagine him just talking to us telling us about this great plan who knows how many other plans were before that one that's why there's there's there's proof that this Earth could be millions of years there's proof that there was other civilizations but that doesn't that doesn't pertain to us it's like when you go and you're going to a to to a ball game and you're and you're in you're you're a part of that team and you're at that particular ball game it's not going to do you any good about talking about the other ball games it's the one that pertains to you it's when you get called to go up to bat now it's your turn to prove yourself because the game is on I'm just using an analogy there so here Satan goes up to Eve and and tell tells her that she can actually be like God what do you think he was telling her he was telling her that you can bring forth the sons of God you can you can create like God and that's why he defiled her and it wasn't an apple that she ate but it was actually an adultery that took place right there in the Garden of Eden when the serpent went to Eve and said I can show you how you can bring forth sons of God that's why when we see the way that the way that the the angel of the Lord the way that that the spirit of God came over Mary and said Thou shalt bring forth a son Adam in the image of God all he would have had to do was go and speak to Eve because we were attributes in that other dimension amen and God had created this Earthly Dimension here where there's time space and matter and and and all Adam would have had to do was go to Eve and speak to her and she would have brought forth a son right there it would have been if if if they needed a flesh and Bone body it could have just been created right there and then because remember they were not flesh and blood when Adam was expressed in the image of God he was actually just a human expression in the form of a theophany and when he took Eve from from his side there wasn't any blood involved the blood came as a result of the Fall because because death comes when the life leaves the body now the life that was in Adam and Eve was no longer eternal because God said the day you eat thereof the day you disbelieve the word of God death is going to set in you shall surely die they were no longer veiled look what happens Adam and Eve the serpent beguiles Eve makes love to her inseminates her with serpent seed okay and then she goes and shows it to Adam and does the same thing with Adam and that's why there was two seeds in in uh uh Eve one which was the serpent seed which brought forth Cain and the other which was Abel which was the seed of Adam that was the promised seed Cain was not from Adam Cain was from the serpent that's why the Bible says you know when Jesus is talking you're you're of your father the devil he was a liar from the beginning when he was rebuking the Pharisees who was the first liar in the Bible the serpent and here he goes and he perverts the plan of God he wants to be like God so he says oh God is going to bring forth Sons remember the whole Plan of Redemption is calling you back to your rightful position as a Son of God you bypassed your theophany body now God Is Calling You by his word but he's not calling this human he's calling the attribute that he placed in you before the foundation before when you came into this Earth You came through a a human body through your mother and your father but it wasn't until you took that Breath of Life when you came out of the womb of your mother and you took that Breath of Life in that Breath of Life there was an attribute of God it's not in every birth it's not that's why there's children of God on the earth and there are children of the wicked one that come through the through the original sin the original sin was adultery procreation that was not the perfect plan of God but it was that's the Paradox he wanted to be a redeemer so in order for him to be a redeemer and a savior something had to fall so he allowed Satan to be the one to use to bring about the fall you see this is this is the the plan of God you know don't don't try to uh you know well why did God do this you know why would God do all of this you know why did all of a sudden he decides that he wants to be a Healer wants to be a redeemer I don't know that's God Amen these are some listen there's things that you're just not going to be able to fully comprehend but all we know is that he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a savior and that's why we're living in this plan here on Earth and everything is about salvation and that there's no other Sal there's no other savior but by Jesus Christ your birth certificate Bears record of it the the churches are out there they're all talking about it you know Jesus is the one and only true way to back to Heaven back to your rightful position back to Eternal state where we are going to be like God and back like God again so this whole plan was perverted by Satan the serpent comes in he perverts the plan brings forth now where death sets in and now children are born by Pro creation which is through a woman and a man coming together and bringing forth children but that was the perversion of what God is actually doing now that's why you hear you must be born again oh so like like you know like uh uh you mean I got to go back and and and be born again like is that is that like uh reincarnation or is that like how does that work no you need to be birthed by the word of God supernaturally the word of God's got to come to you and if there's a seed of God there then it'll get germinated by the word of God and you will respond to the word and you will bring forth a new birth a new life that's why a lot of people once you've been born again people say I don't know know this person anymore but it but but it's but it's it's Bill but but yet he's not the same bill that I knew like he was a Shyer and today he's like serving the lord all the time you see it's the new birth brings forth a brand new life it actually brings forth a son or a daughter of God and so we need to understand what actually took place in the Garden of Eden Satan wanted to be a Creator and so the only way that he could do it was to use the law of God's word which said let every seed bring forth of its own kind he heard when God said let there be this let there be that let let every seed bring forth of his own kind when when he created the animals and everything said ah okay so now I know how I can how I can get myself into this plan and and cause problems and that's why if you look at the curse that when God came all of a sudden why is it that Adam and Eve had to go and cover themselves and cover their private parts after the sin took place because they were veiled by God they were in they were in they were veiled by eternal life when they were in the form of their theophany they were Eternal there was no death there was no nakedness because there was no such thing as creation by sexual order but all of a sudden the sin takes place Adam and Eve got to go hide themselves and says Adam where are you why are you hiding yourself what's have you gone and done what I said you should not do you see the veil of eternal life fell away from them and all of a sudden they knew that they were naked well if eating apples opens our eyes to to to naked why how come you know it doesn't do it today do you see what I'm saying you just have to allow the Holy Spirit that's why it's important you know we we're looking into the Oneness of God but you see what's coming out of it you see how important it is to understand who God really is until God listen you can't figure out God let's just make this straight right now don't you think for one minute that you can figure out God even us ministers we come up here we are relying on the divine revelation and inspiration of the Holy Spirit to give us what we have need of in order to feed the body because this is a a body this is a body movement this is the the the the many membered mystical body of Jesus Christ we can't figure out God that's why the whole Plan of Redemption is something that Satan cannot you see Satan has always been coming and impersonating what God is doing and that's why he would always infiltrate the churches infiltrate with coming in with their own doctrines God is one nope he wants to make them three you know he wants to he wants to make sure that whatever God's word says he wants to make sure to just add his own twist to it so that now it it can have none effect but but God has seeds remember we spoke on Sunday that the garden was was the world and the swore was the son of man well that's God the son of man was God and he sold seed and and the Bible said that the seed was the word of God and the word fell into good ground and we talked about we we we brought some quotes on how God had prepared ground well how it is that you that you are prepared ground is that when you took that Breath of Life when you came out of your mother's womb in that breath of life was an attribute son or daughter of God and in an appointed time and season God was going to call that attribute and that's why you find yourself we don't all get called at the same time you notice that one comes today another one will come maybe next week another one will come maybe next year we don't know when God is going to call but God calls individuals because God is calling his own Jesus said all that the father hath given me all that the father had planned all that the listen we we we we just we're just using words here father is a word and in that word there is a meaning just like God the word God is object of worship but you need to get into the actual thoughts of God where you where you connect with the logos of God where you connect with the word of God and then when when the logos is revealed to you it it actually tells you the meaning of the word that God is expressed in you all of a sudden you start to express God in your season in your time and you don't realize that you don't realize what what's going on here how come I'm I can't get enough of the word how come I can't read enough I want to be in church I want to go to church Wednesday I want to be in the prayer meeting on Friday I hope some of you all do Sunday I can't wait to be in the house of the Lord why because you're feeding on the word the word can only grow by feeding on the word you are the word and the only thing that makes sense to you now is the word but by Revelation by the thought meaning that's in the actual word being revealed unto you amen praise God hallelujah and so Mary was just an incubator but the child belonged to God yes he was the creator of both egg hemoglobin we've read this already let's go on Amen look he received worship who receives who who alone deserves worship only God Thou shalt not thou th that was the first commandment Thou shalt not put any other God before me amen you shall worship me and me alone I am the Lord God you shall not have any other false gods before me he made that so clear to the children of Israel so who deserves the worship God and when they they they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myr they they knew that it was royalty they knew that it was the these these uh um you know three kings they were they would watch the skies they they knew that something Supernatural had happened they had recognized the word of God that was written in the heavens that Messiah when that star was to appear Messiah was going to be on the earth and they came and they worshiped him Jesus next slide a 12-year-old boy and the child grew and whacked strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him listen to what he says here and this little boy 12-year-old child no wisdom yet why but just a 12-year-old boy the father didn't dwell in him at that time go listen Jesus sure the the Holy Spirit was around him was was directing him but he was Flesh and Blood he was a human the Bible says that he had to learn obedience to all the things that he had to come into contact with he was tempted in the same way that you as a man are tempted you as a woman are tempted he was tempted in all of those areas but he overcame because he knew he knew that he was about the father's business something was in him there was a revelation in him that that he knew but it wasn't until he went to the to the uh to the River Jordan where the spirit of God came down and rested upon him and went and said this is my beloved Son in whom I am now pleased to dwell in hear ye him Hallelujah you see he was moving into his public Ministry he was now receiving his enlightening where he now all of a sudden everything that he was doing all that he he was about his father's business everything was all about fulfilling he says I do nothing less the father shows me and when you've received the true birth of the holy spirit in your life you are now not led by this flesh anymore even though it's it's it's a fight it's a struggle you have to deal with it each and every day but the Holy Spirit Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God amen hallelujah and so because he he he come on the day when he baptized him he saw the spirit of God coming down and went in him amen it was at that time now now Jesus Christ being baptized with the Holy Ghost just like you justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost but do you know that the baptism of the Holy Ghost a lot of people you come into the church church and you get baptized into the Holy Ghost you feel his presence and you rejoice but that is only to make way or to see that when the baptism comes upon you whether there's a seed in there that's going to get watered and germinated to bring forth a sun remember a lot of people listen there's a lot of Pentecostal churches out there a lot of Baptist Churches out there that Rejoice they go into the church churches on Sunday and the spirit of God is moving in their midst but just the very fact that the spirit of God comes down upon them causes them to speak in tongues uh shout run around and everything else doesn't mean that there is a seed in there the proof If there's a seed in there it'll awaken to the word and now like Jesus it'll say I do not nothing lest the father shows me in other words I can only see by the word of God what the word reveals to me and when I go to the word and I see baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus said I will send you the comforter which is the Holy Spirit and he will guide you and lead you into all truth then how in the world could I possibly believe a trinitarian Doctrine and baptism in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit three in one no the Holy Ghost that's in me cannot possibly say Amen to that because the word cannot deny the word the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can recognize the word not that you can speak in tongues not that you can go to church more than anybody else it's not about just being in the church and and and and you know being in a position in the church it's about receiving the life of God in you to where now you can speak back to God by Revelation what he's revealed to you that's why the Bible says without faith it's impossible to please God well how you going to please God you think you can please God by your Works you're not going to please God by your works because there's people that do much more Works than you do you're not going to please God by giving more money than anybody else that doesn't please God there's people that give millions of dollars to the church every year but that doesn't please God you know what pleases God when he comes to you and he says to you on that day you shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you prise God the works that that that that that that that that you're doing it's I in you it's that those are those are the Greater Works that I am in you doing those works I'm the greater than those those situations in your life I I'm your Jehovah Gyra that provides all your needs God and you can go back and say now you can speak the Revelation that even under the circumstances of debt and broken marriages and broken families and and and and sickness and health you can you can go back because something in you goes and and and comes out of you which is the seed that was planted in there from before the foundation of the world it comes to the surface and it says I believe God I believe that the Lord is my savior he's my listen if he can save he can heal healing is only just a down payment of salvation hallelujah praise God Amen let's go to the next slide so here in the beginning of his ministry when the Holy Spirit come upon him at the baptism of John he become the anointed Messiah now remember he was the son of God when he was born he was God's virgin born son but when he become Messiah that's when the Holy Spirit Come on him cuz the Messiah means anointed one see and he was the anointed one when the Holy Spirit came upon him now he was anointed to fulfill the word for his day and what was the word for Jesus's day anybody know what was the word for Jesus's Day come on what what did he come to do came to save Calvary he came to go to Calvary he came to fulfill Calvary without Calvary there was no way that we could possibly receive the Holy Ghost because remember when he went to Calvary let's go on here it's all coming up here the anointed one amen 30 year old s 30 years old significance Joseph was 30 years old when Pharaoh commissioned him to be governor of Egypt just showing some types here from the Old Testament because there's there's a significance to when Jesus went into his public Ministry when he now came into the ministry to the Jews because because a lot of people that believe that the that the Great Tribulation that the tribulation period is going to be 7 years it's actually only going to be 3 and A2 years when Moses and and Elijah come and the and the tribulation strikes the Earth okay because the first 3 and 1/2 years was to the Jews when Jesus was here on Earth and Messiah was cut off when he went to Calvary so the next three and a half years is fulfilled in the tribulation we're not going to get into all that now but just to let you know that the tribulation period is not seven years it's three and a half years 1,2 30 days I believe they said in the in the scripture 1260 1260 thank you so now watch he was now remember go to the next slide here in the flesh he was just a man but in spirit he was God but a man in flesh therefore his body was a human being that was subject to The Temptations subject to sickness and just the same same as ours as he had to put on be a man a human and then he was God in the spirit he said I and my father are one my father dwelleth in me he was saying that now he was now God and human Emmanuel the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen praise God go to the next slide so you just failed to see who the man was he was both God and man it was a man weeping when he was weeping for their sorrow but when he stood and said Lazarus come forth and a man had been dead four days stood on his feet again that was more than a man yes sir that was the resurrection in Jesus Christ calling forth somebody that was already dead 4 days in the grave glory to God Amen so look here our go to the next slide our Lord Jesus Christ he was man tempted by the devil Matthew 4 verse4 he was man because he hungered for food Mark 11:12 he got tired Mark 4:39 he wept John 11:35 but then he was God when he overcame by the word and fed 5,000 the bread of life John 610 rebuked the storm Mark 4:39 and raised the dead our brother Lazarus both man and God he died Mark 15:37 not over 50 years old but have seen Abraham he said before before he says before he says he knew Abraham he was rebuking the Pharisees when they were saying that we are the children of Abraham he says before Abraham was I am I was before Abraham if you would have known Abraham you'd have known me and he had the rebuke them and says you're of your father the devil Hallelujah by your traditions you see they had already come up with traditions and teachings of man and they couldn't even recognize when all the scriptures of the Old Testament were being fulfilled right before their very eyes here he comes Messiah riding on the F on the ass of a mule comes riding into Jerusalem he was actually fulfilling the very scripture but yet they didn't recognize him why because they had taken on their own interpretation on the word and what's happened today the very same thing Jesus Christ comes in word form in this day to reveal himself and lead the people back to the original word and you take somebody you you show them right there in the scripture so clear baptism in the name of Jesus Christ showing very clearly that God was our savior that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament and they and they reject it they deny it but he rose again again in Luke 24:6 before Abraham I am I am the bread of life I am that rock in the wilderness he was telling them who he was Jesus himself now look when he went to Gethsemane he went to Gethsemane as listen here what he says his last cry Eli Eli my God why has God that was a man why hast Thou forsaken me in the Garden of Gethsemane the anointing left him you know he had to die as a sinner he had to die a sinner not his sins but mine and yours he took all of our sin upon him remember I said that when he went to Calvary you went to Calvary with him because the Holy Ghost had not been given yet amen remember the whole Plan of Redemption is to restore Adam which is what was taking place at Calvary 2,000 years ago and to restore Eve which is now taking place right now and Eve could only be restored by the attributes receiving the anointing so that they could come into their day into their season into their manifestation as the bride the true church of of Jesus Christ that's why the Holy Ghost was sent down on the day of Pentecost so here now listen he says he died a sinner not his sins but mine and yours that's where that love comes in how he took mine now he says here in the rising of the Sun the spirit left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was God God anointed that flesh which was human flesh and he didn't have to if he'd have went up there as God he'd have never died that kind of death you can't kill God but here I want to read I want to read the the the the rest of of this quote because brother Bram goes on he says but he didn't have to do it remember he went there with you in him see God had never separated the bride from the groom remember back in the Garden of Eden God took the rib from Adam to produce Eve called their name Adam well when he died at Calvary and they pierced his side and the blood poured out what was also pouring out was his spirit and it was his Spirit it was the attributes of you and me that were in him because when when he died and went to the Cross we died the price was paid at Calvary so that you and I when we come into our rightful position now the anointing comes on the seed you'll understand that you were Justified at Calvary because he knew that you were going to be born in sin when you were born through your mother's womb by the by the by the way of procreation that was the original sin that's why the Bible says you're born in sin speaking lies who was the first one that lied in the Garden of Eden the serpent so the nature and the characteristics of that serpent went into the human flesh of Flesh and Blood and that's why when a child is born it's got the nature on them already they're going to lie to Mom and Dad they're born in sin they're shaped in iniquity they're going to do things shap an iniquity means you're doing things that you know it's wrong but yet you just keep doing it and you shape a life out of that and God knew that you were going to live that kind of a life he knew that you were going to make those mistakes he knew that you were going to come into deception he knew that you were going to fall and you were going to have to fight this flesh and this flesh was your enemy that's why the Bible says that your carnal mind is at emnity with God it doesn't want to obey God it wants to to fulfill the lust of the flesh that's why you're going to find yourself at times being trapped by these lustful desires and by this sinful flesh but he knew that you would have to that you would have to overcome that so he made a way for you he says I'm going to take it to the Cross that's why he came as a human and when he died all of your sin all of your your your your past everything that that all your mistakes everything that you've done he says once you receive his word and that attribute of God that that that representation that was in you from before the foundations of the world it the Bible talks about the the those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life That's the game book that's the book that's that's that's that's the the the the the book that was sealed okay that had all of the Mysteries all the mystery of God was revealed in there now I'll just I'll just tell you this the mystery the mystery of God was that God was going to come and become flesh and he wanted to come now he Christ The Mystery of God he wanted to come and have the preeminence in the church in the body in you as a human being he wanted to have pre preeminence in you and the only way he knew that he could have absolute and total preeminence is if he would make a way that your sin would not be able to condemn you anymore and and cause you to to to to to to go off and and fall into sin and and and feel condemnation there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ how do you get into Christ you're born again by the spirit of God and the attribute of God in you awakens to who you really are and when you awaken to who you really are you recognize that there's a justification that comes within the seed of God already remember when that seed was released through through by the holy ghost coming down and the sewer went and planted those seeds you that were in that seed you that that that seed that's actually the real you every is in that all the DNA is in that seed everything that you need to overcome this Dimension is in that seed hallu there's nothing more that you need than the new birth and then all you do is you feed on the word you assemble yourself remember God is calling you in this day for one purpose to fulfill his plan and the plan of God in this day is not to go and kill yourself or offer yourself as a sacrifice somewhere on Calvary no sir the plan for this hour for this Bride for this church is to manifest the word of God to where you feed on the word of God you assemble yourselves you're under the Ephesians 4 Ministry that is perfecting you this is this is what this is today tonight we're here at in Bible study but it's perfect you it's to it's to bring you out of your spiritual Amnesia it's to bring you out of your Earthly uh you know all your your Earthly traditions and all your your your your upbringing and everything that that that's holding you back and you know all the unbelief that's holding you back but I want to tell you something in that seat of God that he placed inside of you everything that you have need of is in there and it will overcome every situation in your life amen praise God God if you believe that word there's nothing that should be condemning you right now if you've truly been born again by the spirit of God you're an overcomer because the Overcomer is in you amen praise God hallelujah let's move on so we know now he says here he says listen he says the bride the the the the bride had not been separated from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female he saw you and he saw Christ Christ and the church amen the husband and the wife it's God male and female god in the beginning when he was Elohim those attributes that were in his mind because he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a husband he wanted to have Fellowship because he expressed it the first thing that he expressed when he expressed Adam was Adam and Eve he took Eve from his side what was he showing that he was he wanted to have Fellowship well that whole plan is now being restored right back to what it originally was and so in God is male and fale female Satan wants to pervert that in our gener generation and he wants to come up with all these gender identities well you could either be male or you could be female no God didn't do it that way God didn't produce his word or his Plan of Redemption somebody show me in the word where that's in the word the only place I see it in the word is in Sodom and Gomorrah and God reigned down Boulders of fire and destroyed the whole thing because it was all an Abomination before God you see they're perverting the word of God there is no such thing as genders of male and female or a male being a female or a female being a male or a he or a they or a she or yeah you you need to put everything back to the word of God and when the spirit of God comes on you it's not going to lead you into any of that stuff praise the Lord the Holy Spirit can just in in in the same way that the Holy Spirit can raise somebody from a cancer he can raise somebody from a life of immorality yes Lord because it's just a spirit cancer is a spirit homosexual sodomite that's just a spirit it needs to be it needs to be cast out oh but they're born with it yeah maybe the spirit was in there because it come down through generations whatever but that doesn't change God's ability to cast out demons when that father brought his son who had been born with epilepsy and Jesus looked to the boy and said Satan come out that child was completely delivered of epilepsy there's no difference between epilepsy and a homosexual Spirit no difference it's just a different Spirit that's all it is hallelujah praise God God so here now he says so when he God looked down upon that body he saw both male and female musicians come it was all redeemed in that one body see they are one same word same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride everything that we read in the scriptures when we're reading in the New Testament and Paul is talking to the church and speaking to the church and rebuking the church and correcting the church in Corinthians it's so that we can come to understand that we are the word and God is delivering us and setting us free from the sin and unbelief that is affecting our flesh the seed of God remember that seed everything is in that seed that you have need of that seed cannot disbelieve God's word the Bible says the seed of God cannot disbelieve the word of God so don't worry if there's a seed in there an election is in there you can never ever be deceived amen praise God we'll just finish off with this at the cross of Calvary the next slide he perceived we the love of God because he laid down his life for us God veiled in Jesus to do the work of redemption at the cross God could not die in the spirit he's eternal but he had to put on a mask and act the part of death I'll tell you Saints there's so much in that you had to put on a human vessel to act the part of a human being and you had to come into sinful flesh an attribute of God had to come into this sinful flesh had to go through a spiritual Amnesia had to be uh you know go through so many different things in your life so much sin and unbelief and and some you know abused you know sexual abuse and and and and mental abuse and and all kinds of of of terrible experiences of broken homes and broken families all the things that that that you know that that comes with being a human being but in there is an elected seed of God God and that mask gets removed the veil of this life gets removed when you receive the New Birth by the word of God and by believing that Jesus Christ is God and that he can he's the only true way and life he had to act the part of death he did die but he could could do it in his God form he had to do it in the son form as a son of man on Earth Saints you need to die out to yourself you need to die out to all the unbelief that the enemy has been putting upon your life trying to keep you Bound in a sinful condition trying to keep you mentally bound trying to keep you thinking that this is who you actually are no the new birth brings you into the true identity of who you are you are not the son or the daughter of Mr and Mrs so and so yeah this flesh came through that but the seed of God that was prepared for good ground that seed that was placed in there is God and it will manifest God it will manifest the Rapture that is the part that we are going to manifest like we were saying on Sunday there's nothing left there's nothing left there's nothing left for for for for only the bride coming into her maturity Israel is already in her Homeland Jesus said in Matthew 24 that that generation would see all of these things Jesus said that generation would witness and see those things that the coming of the Lord they were going to witness that event and that generation is now already 76 years into that generation because a generation in Israel now is anywhere between 73 and 83 years like we were reading from The Book of Psalms so if we're already in the ballpark what's our priorities looking like lately are we focused are we ready are we paying attention to what's really going on or are you asleep not realizing that the coming of the lord it's already happened it's already in progress you've already been raptured brother Bram says the Rapture is a revelation you've already been taken you've already been snatched away one will be taken the other one left it's already happened the Rapture is already in progress you're already in that partially in that Dimension you're you're Torn Between Two Dimensions right now that's why you're fighting that's why you're overcoming that's what you're dealing with because this flesh wants to keep you here but the scripture said that this Mortal shall put on immortality hallelujah praise God we're going to end it right there let us pray father what a privilege and an honor it is tonight Lord to hear these wonderful truths that that are uh in your word and how you've made it so clear to us father that that Lord we're not what we appear to be Lord but it's a paradox we're still having to go and deal with these things of the world and tomorrow morning we've got to get up we've got to go to work we've got to go and deal with all these things but Lord something Burns within our hearts and that is the revelation of who we truly are and when we look around us and we see the world in the condition that it's in Father we know that there's a resurrection that's already taken place within us and and the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead it now dwells in us and it is quickening it is changing it is quickening our mortal bodies so that we can be translated into that other dimension from where we originally came from Lord back reunited with the word of God that is our hope that is our future there is no future but the coming of the Lord the rest of the world is going into chaos we can see the conditions of the world going into total chaos Israel in her Homeland surrounded by the enemy oh God but Lord Jesus you have a bride that's being perfected by the word of God that is standing on the word of God that is believing the word of God lord Jesus continue this work in each and every one of our lives in the Simplicity oh God keep us humble Lord Lord keep us humble to to realize that we didn't deserve this we we're not speaking
