TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] we rejoice in christ our savior our lord leader and guide may the lord bless us all together this sunday morning as we look into the perfect law of liberty my subject today will be on king david king david let's talk about him for a while let us look into god's word first samuel chapter 16. verses 11 to 13. for the rest of the week i would encourage you to read chapters 16 and 17 of first samuel as those chapters outline they call an anointing of david as king as well as his battle with goliath may god richly bless us all together as we come together in his name reading from the scriptures first samuel 16 11 to 13 and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he said there remain it yet the youngest and behold he keep it sheep and samuel said on to jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither and he sent and brought him in now he was ready and little of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look at look to and the lord said arise anoint him this is he then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to rama praise god hallelujah our gracious heavenly father loving god we pray that the great holy spirit will bless us together as we bring our hearts our thoughts our minds in the great fellowship of this mystery meeting with you lord having a time of fellowship and the breaking of the word of bread of prayers of worship of thanksgiving to thy great and glorious name and your awesome person and presence that is with us here today bless me pray father heaven and earth kiss god and man is reconciled here we are lord as a part of you expressions of the word of god amen in jesus name we ask your blessing amen well praise god uh now in the nation of jordan i visited the hidden city it's also a lost city that was discovered and that is the city called petra one one movie made uh about indiana jones was actually made at the temple that is in petra so the filming took place there now the memory and scenery of that is is vivid and clear in my mind's eye on that trip i also visited the ancient nation of israel i walk the walls of the city of jerusalem and in walking on those walls i came to king david's citadel of course king david as you know was israel greatest warrior king i would say he uh seems or was or is the founder of that nation in the sense that his wars his battles laid the foundation for this nation of israel and he has a connection with that nation that is unbreakable to this very day now in 1st samuel chapter 16 verses 1 to 13. we see the time lesson meaningful story of how a boy david who was about 16 years old at the time was elected by jehovah then because he was not on the scene he was called by his father and when he got to his father's house as the scriptures have said he was chosen by the prophet samuel and then anointed to be king of all israel now in first samuel chapter 17 we see the challenge by the philistine goliath of goth and we also see it recorded in the scriptures god's response to goliath's challenge came true the boy david god used david to meet the challenge of that hour and may i say my friends you are never too young for god to use you you may be 16 or 60 and god will still use you for when the challenge of the hour comes as it has in our day our god has promised that he will raise up a standard against satan and against all of his works and so my friends it's in the scriptures god using just a young person a young david a young maiden a young lady down in syria anointed to advise a general that was there that he could have his cleansing from leprosy in the time of elisha the same god used esther a young woman he also used danielle who was just about 18 years old and became prime minister of babylon there was joseph of course in in egypt and then there was mary who was just another teenager that gave birth to jesus the christ so to you young people especially at this time i want you to know you are not just warming a seat in a church you're not sitting and listening to me in your home as a pastime or as a tradition but i want you to know god wants to use you and god can use you god will use you just as much as he used king david of course king david in type is a type of the little nation of israel who has to face the goliaths of this age and of every age also david is a type of god's little flock his little group of believers you may have the worldwide church but out of that god has a little flock a faithful few and david is a type of that little flock also david is a type of you as an individual that god will use you for his glory yes there in the hot and rocky mountains and hills of israel i can see a young lad who was sent to take his brother's meals to the battlefield where they were all massing for the great war israel against the hosts armies of the philistines the saints i can see david with his shepherds clothing on staff in his hand and the lunch or the meals in his other hand and i can see him as he approaches the army and he stops and looks and he could see the mounds of earth he could see my friends all the bulwarks that were being set up against the enemy he could see men pushing rushing moving all around that army camp digging foxholes and preparation for the war which was imminent for one army was was uh there on one mountain and the other army was sparked on the other mountain and in the middle was the valley david being a young boy no doubt he felt no sense of danger when you're young that's the way it is he felt excited he felt fortunate that as a lad he was allowed to go in the middle of the army of israel with these grizzled uh soldiers these warriors he was fortunate within himself to be able to be allowed to go there oh praise god he must have thought to himself oh my all these tents scattered over the mountain side all these warriors these these are the army of israel hallelujah and as he looked he could see soldiers marching in formation he could see man parading and preparing others he could see polishing their weaponry and practicing with various implements of war bowls and arrows spears and swords no doubt they were fencing and and trying different techniques of war of how to kill a man to see who was the most skillful my friends uh getting themselves already and i believe that we can see our day in that picture there's a lot of religious parading going on there's a lot of religious uh practicing going on religious practice uh taking place uh there's a lot of people going to schools and geologies and taking on theology seminaries whatsoever and doing a lot of polishing polishing up their bible knowledge polishing up their spare their shields polishing up their swords polishing up everything oh my but no true warriors rugged warriors to be really found amongst them oh praise god oh all he could see was a lot of pretty uh uh polished up but not ready for battle soldiers yes they had on the arma yes a lot of people have the christian uh um armor on they they have on the the uniform of christianity and they have all the swords that their practice their fencing and their spear how they would stab the enemy and everything like but my friends that's parading that is practice that is learning systems and formation that is getting yourself ready for battle but you know let me refer back to the fact that i once had in my congregation uh a great soldier of the last war matter of fact he was the guard for several german generals very trusted and a very uh a real soldier and each remembrance day here in canada we would ask him to see a few words to speak something of his experiences and of the war and he would happily stand up and give his marvelous testimonies and one time he spoke telling us that he was always amazed at how there would be men that he was well aware of and how that they would be the best shot when they were parading when they were in practice before the war really started they they were crack shots they were the best marchers there were they were the best uh in fighting they were the best of this or best of that he says but you will be surprised that when the war started and the bombs began to drop and the bullets began to fly and the shots begin to go past your ear he said some of those fellas that were so well schooled well practiced the best on parade they will drop their weapons and run and try to hide their knees would be knocking they would be afraid they don't know what to do and some of those men that were thought that there were no real soldiers because they didn't have any real style to them no great spit and polish and they were not the best shots and everything else but one thing they had grit they had toughness they were of the rare breed that were ready to stand rather that they'd rather stand like a man and die or praise god or even if they have to go down they were going to go down fighting they're not going to just go lay down or get just fearful and be turned into a piece of jelly or jellyfish no sir there were warriors there were fighters men that meant business and that's the way we are to be because in the day in which we're living there's too much of this spit and polish too much of this it's got to be religiously right i'm not saying politically correct i'm taking that thought bringing it over and saying they want to be religiously correct in everything that they do every i dotted every t cross every quote in place everything perfect well that looks perfect all beautiful to behold marvelous but when the battle starts that's another matter oh my one time violin in in this message preaching the word of god under the anointing of the holy spirit and the holy spirit of god fell glory to god demons screamed and began to come out the holy ghost fell upon the church of the living god the holy spirit began to move and god began to deliver the people and do wonderful things amongst them at the end of the service that preacher says oh brother i don't know what happened there but when when that started i just felt something go down my spine i was so nervous i was so scared i didn't know what to do of course i was very surprised because as a man of god the sermon of god knowing being led by the spirit to deal with these the supernatural beings uh working their evil works in the midst of the house of god amongst the people of god the devil has polished himself so much that he's come in with sheep's skin looking like believers talking like believers acting like believers carrying on like if he's a soldier wearing the uniform oh perfection he's got that down pat and he can deceive your eyes you naturalize if you don't know what you're doing and if the holy spirit doesn't have control over you my friends i say in this day we need warriors we need warriors of god that will take up this gospel fight without fear without partiality without favor amen and will carry the battle to the devil to the his very doorsteps hallelujah praise god forevermore here was little david with his sling and his brother's lunch going down to that army not knowing that god had a plan for him because on the other hill was a great man called great in the sense of science called goliath you say well brother simon who is goliath well goliath was from a family of giants for he himself was a giant it is said that he was six cubits tall which is to say over ten feet tall and he had a coat of mail on and that coat of mail that he walked around with all day was 125 pounds in the heat of the met of of the middle east he walked around all day with that caught on and that was nothing to him for he was over 10 feet tall and here he was with his spear that was about 14 feet long and it is said according to the scriptures that his spare head was about 15 pounds heavy yes he was a giant among men and he had five brothers that were also giants and here we see goliath stepping out from the philistine army and coming down holding his great spear and saying choose you a man to fight me choose a man to come fight me i want to fight a man of israel well he was a giant then but i'm telling you we are faced with a lot of giants today not only giants and size but mainly giants in intellect giants of theology giants of human knowledge giants of religion and religious knowledge my friends and they are armed with diplomas armed with all kinds of certifications armed and shielded by their organizations shielding them being around them in every way their spears are their reach of influence or their sphere of influence my friends is so prodigious so far-reaching that it would strike fear in the hearts of many to approach some of these men and call them to attention of god's word and they give off that kind of aura to produce that kind of influence shielded by their organization and armed with their diplomas which they believe gives them their credibility and there they are hearing this great giant coming down and saying choose you a man to fight against me little did he know that god already knew all that was going to happen and god had already chosen a man and that man was no other than king david the devil of this age might be saying choose you a man to come down and fight against me but god always raises up a standard against the enemy and i believe our god already has raised up a people to meet the challenge of this day and of this hour for his glory and for his honor hallelujah oh my for david his heart began pumping oh my the excitement of the oncoming battle was right there hallelujah amen oh my he heard those words it didn't make him become fearful it made him want to do something for the glory of god but he to him he wasn't a theologian to him he was not a great church person to him he was not the having dd's lld's or uh trained and all these systems of marketing and business and uh and public relations and uh administrations and whatnot oh he was not so he he just stood back and oh there are great warriors here on the king saul there are great warriors they are able to go to battle and to fight this fight for the nation of israel but when he looked around to his surprise he saw some men some soldiers putting their head between their knees others were ducking behind tents some were sitting there trying to stop their knees from knocking because the knees were knocking so much they couldn't even stop it by holding it with their hands others their teeth were chattering in their in their mouth yes sir and they were scared sometimes that even slapped themselves to see if they can come to their right mind but the pharaoh of man was upon them the fear of goliath was upon them and today it seems the fear of satan evil and sin is upon them fear of the world the rulers of this world oh my friends it seems to be upon the people until they begin to back off and back away from the word of the living god who has called them to himself amen oh my david when he runs down there and says come on fellas let's go and get rid of this this man let's get him out of there how dare he says that choose a man from amongst you and he's going to defeat you oh my oh to his surprise those soldiers not me they've had not me say what about you i heard you were in so many battles and you scarred you've got a lot of uh you know badges and everything else not me david i know i got those diplomas i know i got my degrees i know i've got this i've got that and i can fill a wall with them but not me david not in this uh you know but you've been a man of war since birth you you studied your entire life to this point in time i would think you would be the one to go oh my not me david do you see that guy's height do you see a stature do you know that he he has the name of a giant he looks like a giant he walks like a giant he talks like a giant and do you see that spear in his hand you see those degrees on his wall do you david see how that's like a 14 foot weaver's beam that he can just throw that like a um i mean it's a spear but he can throw it as if it's just a straw at us and you expect us to fight against him we are not able to handle him david can you and david of course said yes i can praise god and i believe when the devil comes to you tries to bring that atmosphere against you and around you you should be able to say yes i can amen i said when the devil comes against you and tries to play tricks on your mind get you fearful and unbelieving you say yes i can ye man if you can't say that way saying with god's help i can and i will glory to god hallelujah listen say it again with god's help i can and i will help praise god hallelujah amen amen praise god though he was only 16 years old lord of god hallelujah and not even in the formal army my friends let me tell you something you may not be in the formal army you're not may not be in the seen army the known army the one that can be perceived you may not even be counted that you are one of them but god has a seen a visible and god has an invisible army you remember the time at elisha when the syrians were coming against him and the young man got scared and said my lord look at these syrians they're coming against us and he says never mind don't be fearful they are more with us than those that are against us and then he said lord open the young man's eyes let him see and he looked and the bible said he saw a horse of angels hovering above those syrians ready to charge down upon them let me tell your friends greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world greater in number are they that are with us than they that are against us amen god is bigger than any of the circumstances that may come against you glory to god in your eyes that circumstance looks like a giant but in the eyes of god it's less than an ant it's less than a drop in a bucket to him nothing is impossible with god and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world thank you lord jesus hallelujah praise god amen glory to god one time israel was marching from the city of jericho a small nation oh they look like a ragtag group of people aggressive great big civilization and yet god says much around seven times go around it for seven church ages then lift up your voice on the eighth day shout for the lord god has given you the city shout glory to god for god has given you the city israel shouted the earth shut the walls shut and the walls of jericho came tumbling down to the ground they charged in and took the victory for the glory of god and so can we so will we today if we trust and believe the word of god and the promise of this hour that we will chase the devil out of our lives our homes our churches every situation that he tries to insert himself into for the glory and praise that god will drive him out amen glory to god hallelujah david said yes i can with god's help i can and my friends that news travels like wildfire i'm telling you nobody not even king saul himself wanted to go out and fight against that giant so when one little no name nobody untrained rough and uncouth boy comes saying i'm ready to go to battle against this giant the news spread like wildfire and came the word came to the tenth of saul and so i said bring him bring him quickly bring him now i want to have a man like that that's willing to grow somebody that has the courage to go amen hallelujah we will have him do it you know even if we get the naive thinking that david was naive even if we got a naive young boy that wants to go out there we will send him out us as a sacrifice let him go out and suck what a great thing he will be doing to sacrifice himself for his nation and then we can we can go back with with some kind of semblance of having uh parts of the army at least went to defend us oh my so he called for david when he pulled the flaps of his tent and he looked out he thought he was going to see a great arnold schwarzenegger when he looked out he thought he'd see a johnson he thought he would see a miss mr olympia oh my yes when he looked what did he see a 16 year old boy that weighed between 90 and 125 pounds standing there with the sling in his hand and he says he's going out to fight against goliath well even if we have to send him out as a matter of form at least i can lend him my arm so saul took his arm of the armor of king saul and he offered it to david and said guard it put it on and go out to meet uh goliath so at least you will have some measure of protection oh my we know david of course knew that his real protection was from the great jehovah lord of sabbath o praise god the great lord of hosts the god of armies amen and so but david for the king's sake put on the armor and tried to walk out of the tent with it i can imagine what a funny looking scene that was 16 year old boy trying to put on the full armor of a man a six foot for tall saul was the tallest of them in israel and he was over six feet and here he was putting on the armor on a little boy that might have been just five feet four or five feet six and uh him trying to struggle out there with it and he felt so uncomfortable the bible said he refused the armor and told them to take it off he'd rather to go out there in the name of the lord with the spirit of the lord that should be the desire of every believer to go out praise god i'm speaking about king david the boyhood of king david going out the war to battle in the name of the lord glory to god hallelujah amen saul said david you don't understand war you're just a shepherd and i'm telling you i'm a real warrior and you've got to wear some armaments you got to have some diplomas you got to allow us to ordain you you gotta allow us to give you a a d d a ph.d so you can get some of the respects of the people we gotta give you a doctorate or or something some something that you you can catch the people's eyes but that was not for david god's anointing god's holy spirit upon his life was going to be the attraction of the hour amen the god's spirit the glorification of the lord jesus christ would be the magnetic pole that will cause men to lift up their eyes to jesus and see jesus only glory to god hallelujah amen so david said no no king saul right there is where you are mistaken i may be a boy but i'm not just a shepherd i am more than a shepherd hallelujah because i remember a day when i was with the sheep out in the field and my father sent and called me home when i got home there was a man called samuel and he was in our living room and the moment he saw me his eyes lit up he stared at me and came to me with a horn of oil and poured the oil upon my head i can still feel that oil glory god flowing from my head down no my clothing right on down amen hallelujah and i'm not just a shepherd i'm telling you king saul i'm not just a shepherd because i remember a day while i was watching the sheep a lion came out and he came after those sheep and when i was wondering what i'm going to do i suddenly began to feel something moving within my heart i grabbed that lion before i can think and we had us a battle out there amen hallelujah and now when i think about it my old mother has a lion skin coat at home to keep her warm in the winter time no king saul i'm not just a shepherd oh praise god another time while i was out in the field a bear came and he thought that he was going to take my sheep away but the spirit of the lord came upon me i had a battle with that bear and i tell you that i slew that bear in the name of the lord king saul i am not just a shepherd hallelujah i am the lord's anointed for this hour for this moment for this thing that is taking place in this day and in this hour i've been anointed for this time and i come here in the name of the lord and to the glory of the living god because the same god gave me the lion the same god that gave me the bear that same god will give me this uncircumcised philistine within my hands for his glory give me the victory amen hallelujah you see my friends david knew who he was david was certain of god regardless of who you are if you are a true believer even if you are not a believer but you are listening to this now may the great holy spirit almighty god come to you praise god and cause you to see who you are and what god has in store for you his plan his purpose for you to use you for his namesake and for his glory amen hallelujah he was not just a shepherd you are not just this or that lord of god you are the son or the daughter of the living god he was you are much more you are much more than you appear to be you're not just a 16 year old a young person you're not just a young woman you are not just an older woman you're not just a housewife you are not just a young man you are not just my friends a mature man or an older man you are much more than that praise god hallelujah david massa said king song you don't understand god elected me hallelujah because he told samuel well go to the house of jesse amen my anointed is there so god knew me before i knew anything about it and he sent a prophet in my day my generation hallelujah glory to god to come to my household and to find that true seed that true son that true child that daughter of god wherever he or she might be amen hallelujah amen praise god amen and so that is why samuel came praise god and so i am anointed for this moment in time i've been elected i've been predestinated praise god and anointed for this hour i've been anointed and set apart hallelujah the holy spirit in my life has set my soul of fire with the glory of god amen on the anointing of the mighty angel of revelation 10 flowing through the life and ministry of revelation 10 7 the messenger for this age his anointing through his message that's now that great oh mantle that was upon elijah is now upon elijah of this hour their man wherever god's true people are that anointed mantle is falling upon them everywhere and anointing them with the glory of god to do the will and the work and the purpose of god to fulfill his divine will amen praise god hallelujah amen it's not how old you are amen is to recognize who you are and who is back of you you've been sent down to this world below here now to serve god's purpose amen going to fulfill his divine will amen thank god we are not just creatures of time you are not just a shepherd you are not just a housewife you're not just a farmer or a worker hallelujah you are not just a creature or a person of time amen but you come from eternity and you're going back to eternity amen outwardly amen you may be of a certain age because you have to come into time and live upon this earth amen but in reality the person in you the real you is an ancient being that come from eternity of god hallelujah and you are only doing some time here upon this earth amen while you are in this body and while you are in this body you are not this body because you will say my body the person who is speaking from the inside of that body owns that body and you are not that body you are greater than your body you are not of time you come from eternity oh praise god hallelujah on this earth your parents might be a man your appearance might be as a woman might be as a young person or even as a child but in heaven as jesus said there is no male nor female paul said then shall we know as we are known amen what shall it be my friends when we get over yonder and join that throw around the glassy sea i tell you i have not seen nor ear heard what god has in store for them that love him glory be to the precious name of our god amen hallelujah listen my friends i want to say quote brother branham he knew satan knew that david was elected of god hallelujah the great warrior david those who he has called he has justified those who he has justified he has glorified amen in the presence of almighty god your name is indelibly written with the blood of jesus christ and is glorified in his presence and on earth you are positionally placed here on the earth for a purpose to do the will of god you see that's your position them fellows there could not understand it but david had the anointing oil upon him and he knew where he was standing let me tell you quoting the prophet again amen each one of you tonight is a little david coming with your little sling he was a believer you are a believer he was elected and called he was anointed he was placed no matter what amen you may say brother branham i wasn't called to be a preacher you may be called to be a housewife you got your position in jesus christ by the holy ghost amen you are just as much david as the rest of them was but beyond goliath if you look beyond the lion you can see the victory because you trust in god like david did lord of god amen god give us some sheep because we want faith to save them sheep hallelujah oh god give us some davids with our heart to go save them sheep hallelujah oh praise god amen friends david went out to meet goliath and that made goliath mad and you know the devil gets mad when he reads when he comes up against a real servant of god male female young person whoever they are he gets real angry and real mad he feels as if he is insulted for he is a this ancients being this ancient evil spirit and god is sending a human oh oh my 20 years 16 years 60 years 50 years the fight against me oh my here he is this great giant and he is angry oh my but you know whenever the devil is mad that's when god is glad amen hallelujah praise god amen lord of god uh what am i am i a dog that you would send a little boy he meant a little untrained warrior no degrees no theology he doesn't have no diplomas on his wall not doctors of divinity no phds no nothing oh my god hallelujah all he has is his walk with god all he has she has is her or her bible and a revelation from the holy spirit and faith in the god that sent her the faith in the god that anointed her that move you out from that realm of doubt in the realm of faith for the glory of god hallelujah amen amen praise god so goliath was angry amen you're going to send a boy against me with a stick as if he's going to chase me home with the shepherd staff oh no all these dogs preaching just the bible preaching scriptures uh quoting quotes and uh that's gonna chase me out oh my but let me tell you david was the anointed of the lord for that hour you and i are the anointed of god to meet the challenge of this hour just as much as the nation of israel the anointed of god to meet the challenge of this age oh hallelujah god's spirit being with them and seeing later on as the tribulation breaks you will be able to see the hand of god working and moving with that great nation oh hallelujah but you know the devil doesn't know who he is fooling with he doesn't know who he's messing around with because all he sees is a bunch of human beings who he should be able to tempt and test and be able to defeat a man but what he's looking at is just a part of the visible army of the living god when he looks he sees a little crowd of people a little rabble like brother branham said his meeting he had to wait for them doctor whatever his name was to come out with his dignified cultured monied crowd oh with their laces and their silks and their beautiful three thousand dollar suits on and their beautiful cars and everything else he had to wait for them to come out of that building first he says then here comes my crowd crippled blind lame problems whatever they were coming in running to get to the front and that's what satan sees some sick some lame some in bed in their bed but listening to a broadcast like this some bedridden some in wheelchairs amen some seem homeless some seem as if they're penniless and ill-dressed not sophisticated and polished god has sophisticated people god has polished people i'm letting you know that god has very highly educated people god has many people great success blessing upon them amen but praise god usually god's crowd looks so off off-kilter amen oh my and praise god but thank god god's well-dressed money dignified people are such humble people by the grace of god you can see them praise god i see it even in my church they'll put their arms around a brother with blue jeans a sister but just regular ordinary clothing and give god the praise and the honor and the glory because together they are one in jesus christ hallelujah amen yes sir amen satan don't know what he's dealing with he doesn't see god's army coming again like the prophet said here comes the music lord of god with almost streaming with the flags and the and the banner streaming and the armors gleaming right and wrong engaged today in a battle with god versus satan amen amen hallelujah amen this bride versus be eligible the power of god against the evil of satan lord of god hallelujah we were born to lose born in sin but thank god with the holy ghost on our side we're bound to win glory to god amen amen hallelujah amen yes sir i think david looks like us or we look like david i believe the church today looks like us nothing much to to look at hallelujah but i tell you the lord of shabbat amen is with us the lord of armies the lord of hosts is with us the lord fights our battles amen he is the great one that fights our battles for his glory and for his honor amen glory to god hallelujah amen hallelujah satan does not recognize what he's up against he doesn't understand that god is working both with the visible and the invisible and he's coming against this last day bride the elect lady amen god's little flock and she is not going to be defeated by satan's the decian s lukewarm spirit she is not going to be defeated by satan with this spiritual blindness and blackout that is trying to put upon people god's people in this last day she will not be defeated and she will not be stripped by satan to a state of spiritual nakedness oh instead the true bride of christ has put on and is putting on christ she is now being clothed with the wedding dress up of his righteousness we're getting ourself ready to go in a rapture praise god hallelujah to be taken out of here by the lord jesus that she might go to her honeymoon so here she comes here comes the pride with with with all the banners streaming as she charges down and the old friends the trumpets are blowing praise god blasting the drums all beating hallelujah war has been declared you know the silver trumpets of israel when they blow those silver trumpets it was to assemble the people the tribes together blowing of the silver trumpet is to prepare the people for war blowing of the trumpets to charge out and to meet the enemy in the seals brother branham said look the trumpet is blown hallelujah the sound the seal is broken as hell is open a call to a spiritual war spiritual disturbance disturb satan's kingdom shake up his jailhouse and the jailhouse begins to rock glory god i tell you the holy ghost anointed on a
