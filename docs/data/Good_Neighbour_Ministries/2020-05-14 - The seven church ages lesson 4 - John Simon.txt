========================================
[Music] evening dear friends it's good to be here again may the Lord bless you real good let us pray our gracious God our Heavenly Father we ask thy blessing upon this broadcast tonight bless each one that is tuned in and made a great Holy Spirit descend upon the word and give us a clear understanding father we pray this and we believe this and we trust in your your wonderful great presence in Jesus name Amen and amen I'm reading tonight from the book of Revelation chapter 1 verse 4 to 6 and my subject is the salutation or greeting John to the seven churches which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and had made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be Lori and Dominion forever and ever amen praise God the Sanitation now to the seven churches which are in Asia this does not mean all of Asia but this spoke of Asia Minor it spoke particularly of Asia Minor and actually Asia Minor is it's about the size of the state of Indiana and these seven churches were identified by God because of their individual characteristics every church has its own character its own church life and because of this difference in nature God had chosen these seven churches so as to be a picture of the seven ages that were to come and that the character of each Church describes and gives us a foreshadow of what the character and nature of these seven ages were going to be now the seven spirits John speaks off hair in the Bible they represent seven portions of the Holy Spirit Himself that will rest upon seven men seven messengers each one to a church age and the Spirit of God that portion of the Spirit of God that would be with them and working through them will provide the wisdom power texture and character for their entire ministries suited to the age in which they live now as we read further in this text it says grace beyond to you and peace from him which was him which was amen him which is to come and from the seven spirits of God now listen to these expressions again him which is him which was and he that is to come the faithful witness the firstborn from among the dead Prince of the kings of the earth the Alpha and Omega they are mighty these are all titles and descriptions of one and the same person who is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself did he's the one that washed us and cleansed us in his own blood thanks be to God for the washing and cleansing of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ now the Spirit of God is as setting forth that first in or to point us to the supreme deity of the person of Jesus Christ and to reveal to us the Godhead as being one God now we know today there is a gross error in the land the gross error of the doctrine of the Trinity and their teaching is that there are three gods instead of one but this revelation was given to John by the Lord Jesus Christ himself to establish without any shadow of doubt of who was speaking and also to give us a clear revelation of the Godhead it is Jesus all it is Jesus himself who corrects the error it is not that there are three gods my friends but one God with three offices there is one God with three titles Father Son and Holy Ghost now this mighty revelation is what the early church had and it gave them prevailing power under the jurisdiction the leadership the guidance of the Holy Spirit as he took them into the truth of the word of God and then vindicated that truth thanks be to God this is what he did and so we we a restoration of this mighty revelation that God gave to these apostles that this person this one that they had walked with with all those years was not just on anybody but he was him which was which is which is to come the Lord God Almighty and his name is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ also along with the name of Jesus they we need to have the restoration of the correct formula for the baptism in water or water baptism we need to correct the correct formula the correct means of doing it according to this Bible no I know that modern teachers modern theologians seminarians they will not agree with what I'm saying here certainly not but here is what was written in a certain Christians magazine from which I quote that the teaching on the Trinity is at the very heart and core of the Old Testament it is every width as much at the heart and core of the New Testament the New Testament is just as much opposed as the Old Testament is to the thought that there are more gods than one yet the New Testament with equal clearness teaches us that the father is God this son is God and that the Holy See it is God and the three are not three aspects of the same person but three persons let me repeat that again not three aspects of the same person but three persons standing in truly a truly personal relationship one to another and there we have the great doctrine of the three persons but one god it's worthless States God according to the Bible is not just one person but he is three persons in one God that is the great mystery of the Trinity and may say it surely is how can three persons being one God not only is there no scripture no Bible anywhere for that but it even displays lack of proper and intelligent reasoning three persons though identical in substance almost Swiss of one substance the Greek three persons different from each other yet one God that if that don't make three God's language has lost its meaning entirely in the light of what I've just coated I want you to listen not to my words but so this picture as I go over it again Jesus Christ get this revelation to John and he is speaking this is the Lord Himself speaking to John and telling John who he was I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end said the Lord which is which was and which is to come the Almighty this is Jesus speaking this is the mighty God in Christ speaking that he is Alpha Omega the beginning and the end I am the Lord God Almighty this is the voice of God Jesus Christ speaking only believe all things are possible yes sir I tell you this is nothing less than deity speaking this was not Jesus Christ was not just a man Jesus Christ was not just a holy prophet he was God their one God the Almighty God that formed himself or placed himself in flesh but for that day and for all time this is not just that a man that was speaking but it was God that was speaking and declaring himself through the man Christ Jesus it is not of course a revelation of three gods but it is a revelation of one God they Almighty God making himself known now for your inspiration they never believed in three gods in the time of the Vedic beginning of the church we cannot find anywhere in the scripture that form of belief in the Word of God we cannot find that kind of a belief among all the Apostles from Peter to Paul to John to Polycarp and those who just left the scene none of them believed in such a thing whatsoever now it was after their bus stomach age that this theory of the Trinity came into being and became an issue at the council the Nicene Council I believe it was 325 a.d it was this doctrine of the trinity became an issue and created a split in the church at that particular time because the split went to extremes one God or three gods and so there became a split and the side that believed or those that believed in three cards there prevailed and that was handed down as the preeminent doctrine and was propagated propagated and pressed upon people brought in by those dark ages I spoke of some time ago and so that doctrine prevailed even to this very day and it prevailed even amongst the Protestants to this very day but our God the truth church is marching on here o Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord in the book the Old Testament and there God said he was one God and God has never changed his mind about his word about his person his personality of who he is now so this doctrine caused a split first of all it caused a division this doctrine did certainly that in one side the side that believed in three gods went you know they adopted a system of polytheism which means many gods believe in many gods but yet those many gods become one God and they move from believing in many thoughts because we remember we're talking about the time when it was in the days of pagan Rome let me differentiate pagan Rome under all those different emperors right on down to constant time who was the one that brought this Nicean Council together to settle the argument between the these two groups in his Empire and so we know that this cause is split in the early church after that these apostles had left the scene and one side move from their original place when it was pagan rule believing in many gods polytheism and compromise by moving to a position where let me to believe or set they began to believe in three gods the other site maintained the position that there is only one God and those teachings and those things have come right on down until our day and our time that we are living in but the revelation that came through John by the holy spirit to all the churches said I am the Lord Jesus Christ in other words I am all in all i am alpha i am omega there isn't any other god how about the almighty i am the lord i am the first I am the last of the beginning I am the end on him which was in the first time in the middle and I will be there at the end him which was which is and is to come the Lord Almighty he is making his deity known to all and he has put his seal his stamp of approval upon this book of Revelation and upon all genuine holy spirit given revelation no think about this consider this my friends who was the father of Jesus Matthew chapter 1 verse 18 says she was found with child of the Holy Ghost strange for Jesus himself when he was asked the question said my father God is my father God is my father then we are left with the problem who is the father of Jesus Christ if they were truly three distinct persons in one God was the holy ghost his father or was it God the Father that was his father did he have one father or two fathers certainly not because of not understanding the revelation that it is one God amen one God and the name of that God that wonderful God that revealed himself and made himself form the body went into it God in Christ amen yet God was in Christ hallelujah and here it was one God not two not three but one God we'll get to all of these finer things as we go on with this lesson in the future maybe not tonight because there's a lot of meat lots of things to cover and we want to take our time and cover it properly and appropriately so that you might have a clearer understanding if you so desire and if you open up your heart to receive it know we see historically and scripturally people have wondered where these three came from where did this thought this theory of three gods being one came from now we know that that foundational doctrine of what modern Christianity from the time of 325 AD until now because that sort of three gods was never has never been there in the scriptures at all until that time we understand the only nations that help those kinds of beliefs and thoughts were the Babylonian Sumerians various other peoples of the pagan a Dark Ages of the Old Testament but we know that Joe over always declared himself that he is one not three but one no this Trinity of course using the word fringe is absolutely unscriptural it's not anywhere in our Bible but never mind that we understand that it's absolutely unscriptural unbiblical and it's really based upon the the many gods of pagan Rome the Romans at that time had many gods and they prayed to those many gods and they also prayed to their ancestors and used or prayed to their ancestors as mediators who they believed if they pray to their ancestors their ancestor could intercede with God beyond the veil on their behalf you see my friends the thin skin veil that is there then it took them just one step one step to give new names to their own gods and so we have Saints today to make it more biblical they call some of their ancestors Saints thus we find instead of openly worshiping Jupiter or Venus or Mars we have the worship of Peter and Paul and all these various ones the worship of fatty Christopher and many others you see they could not make their pagan religion work or their religious system work with just one not so the closest they could get still maintaining their many God's system was to uh kind of bring it down to three gods and they were then that they done split him this one God that we're talking about this him into three to get their religious system to be able to work and they men intercessors or mediators of the Saints and demand intercessors of their ancestors ever since then the entire spiritual atmosphere was polluted and people fail to realize that the teaching of God is that there is one God era blotted out the knowledge of one God took away completely then it was not three gods but one God manifesting himself in three various offices that's how I'm a father I am a son I'm a human being doesn't make me three people I am one person but I move in three different offices three different roles but one person and so is it God is one God now we also know they tried to make it in some fantastic theory that God is like a bunch of grapes three persons but mysteriously become one sharing their divinity equally by all three of them but plainly says here in the book of Revelation by the Lord Jesus Christ himself him that day which is that which was that which is to come he is the Alpha and Omega not day which means that he not they he is the eighth to Z they all in all this means he is everything he said the Almighty he is the Rose of Sharon he not they he is the lily of the valley he not they he is the bright and morning star he not they the righteous branch he or him the Lord Jesus not they he is the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost he is God Almighty one God operating or manifesting himself in three distinct offices first Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says and without controversy that is to say without argument without the bait with a question without any dispute God was manifest great the mystery of godliness that who God was manifested in the flesh who was manifested in the flesh God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit God was justified in the spirit seen of angels who was seen Avengers God was seen of angels preached on to the Gentiles God was preached unto the Gentiles who is this God Jesus Christ amen believed on in the world and was received up into glory who was received up God was received up into glory this is what Timothy is saying that great is the mystery of godliness that God was manifested in the flesh and that God that was manifested in the flesh preached on inter in the world that same God was received back up into glory not another God the Bible says it clearly it says God one God was made manifested in the flesh and that one God that we know I believe is the Lord Jesus Christ I think that ought to settle it right there I just love the words of this beautiful son he's God in the Father he's God in the son he's God in the Holy Ghost he's got the only one I know God he's God and God don't ever change I know God he's God and Jesus is his name all thank God there's only one God and His name is a Lord Jesus Christ they're these apostles knew who he was and they did not try to make him into another guy or a second god or a third god but the only God he was gone very you he was very God he was that only God and it is it is this marvelous revelation that is now being restored to empower the church to come back to the word come back to God and to recognize what was erased by era now being restored by the righteousness and revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ back into the church that is the revelation one God and I thank God for that that he is Lord he is Lord he is risen from the dead and he is Lord every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord may
