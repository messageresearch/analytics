[1:13] add to our christian walk and journey
[1:17] as we look into the seven
[1:21] church ages we would of course
[1:25] tonight love to speak on
[1:30] the seed of the nickelodeons
[1:34] our scripture for this
[1:37] evening is found in revelation
[1:41] chapter 2 reading verse 6
[1:47] and this thou hast
[1:50] that thou hatest the deeds of the
[1:54] nicolaitans
[1:57] which i also
[2:01] hate let us pray
[2:05] dear god our gracious
[2:08] and loving heavenly father
[2:11] we ask your blessing upon the breaking
[2:15] of the bread of life
[2:18] may the word of truth go forth tonight
[2:22] with great power and inspiration
[2:26] reaching the hearts and the lives
[2:30] of those who desire
[2:33] they everlasting
[2:37] eternal bread of life
[2:41] bless us tonight we pray and may the
[2:44] great holy spirit
[2:47] shower down upon us eagle's food
[2:51] food for now and evermore
[2:55] we ask it in jesus christ's name
[2:58] amen and amen praise
[3:01] be to god hallelujah
[3:05] revelation chapter 2 verse 6
[3:09] but this thou hast that thou
[3:13] hate us the deeds of
[3:16] the nicolaitans which
[3:19] i also hate
[3:22] of course we are talking about the seed
[3:26] of nicolaitanism
[3:31] and we know friends that everything
[3:33] actually has its beginnings
[3:35] in the book of genesis genesis of course
[3:39] which means
[3:40] beginnings genesis is
[3:43] also the seed book
[3:48] where it's a nursery where everything
[3:52] finds its origin and
[3:55] come to its maturity
[3:58] in the later or last days
[4:04] so we find that in this book of genesis
[4:07] if i might give uh nicolasianism just a
[4:10] brief word picture
[4:13] in the form of one called
[4:17] nimrod you may look that up in the book
[4:20] of genesis you may study it
[4:22] um in your bible dictionaries wherever
[4:24] you may find
[4:25] his name but what you will find
[4:28] is that he was the first person
[4:32] to ever dominate domineer control
[4:36] groups and companies of men
[4:39] the first one to form an army
[4:43] and place men into battalions
[4:46] and and so on with captains over them
[4:50] and was able to conquer and rule the
[4:53] then
[4:54] known world from this
[4:57] we also want to expand
[5:02] now there were two thoughts about what
[5:05] the nickelodeons were what are they
[5:09] who are they now it was said that they
[5:13] are a group of apostates
[5:18] who their founder was nicholas
[5:21] of antioch a proselyte
[5:25] to christianity who became one
[5:29] of the seven deacons in the
[5:32] church at jerusalem
[5:36] they had pagan feasts
[5:42] and during this feast
[5:45] it was a time of uncleanness
[5:50] on chase behavior ungodly
[5:54] unclean loosed uh sexuality
[6:00] going on amongst them
[6:04] and his thought
[6:07] was that to conquer the sin of sexuality
[6:12] or to master it one had to
[6:15] engage in it and
[6:18] know it by experience before
[6:22] one could have control over it
[6:27] one must go through the whole range of
[6:29] it
[6:30] and of course we know that this loose
[6:33] sexuality of corruption
[6:35] degradation and perversion
[6:39] was an offshoot of nicolasianism
[6:45] by and from their leader of course
[6:48] inspired by satan
[6:52] uh nicholas of antioch
[6:55] listen he was a deacon he was in the
[6:59] church
[7:00] he was a part of that early
[7:03] church and yet the
[7:06] spirit of the white horse
[7:09] rider was already
[7:12] upon him trying to lead the church of
[7:16] god
[7:17] astray lead the church of god
[7:20] off of the word of god
[7:24] now naturally that kind of teaching gave
[7:30] way
[7:30] and gives way in our day
[7:34] to all manner of perversions
[7:39] loose living sexualities of
[7:42] all manners uh as we see it
[7:47] communes compounds
[7:50] man in the modern day uh
[7:53] gathering groups of people under the
[7:56] influence of
[7:57] of their religious teaching and belief
[8:01] and amongst them comes this spirit of
[8:05] nicolasianism with its corruption
[8:07] degradation and all manner of evil
[8:13] we understand that this of course
[8:17] uh we can follow it back to eden
[8:21] from the seeds that were planted or
[8:24] grown
[8:24] in eden and there we see an eden
[8:28] in the garden of eden the tree
[8:31] of good and evil
[8:35] amen and also
[8:38] we find that the the tree of life
[8:44] of course friends not only that will
[8:48] follow it down and we see
[8:50] it manifested in jezebel
[8:54] and the spirit of jezebel that continues
[8:58] on
[8:58] down to this day
[9:01] jezebel manifesting
[9:04] that sensual
[9:08] domineering controlling and corrupting
[9:12] influence that is in the church
[9:15] and in the world today
[9:19] another tree of course is balaam
[9:23] balaam with his false teaching
[9:27] leading god's people from completely
[9:30] away
[9:31] from the word of god and if i might
[9:34] mention
[9:35] he also use money
[9:38] financial money to obligate
[9:42] folks uh to have them uh
[9:45] either borrowing from him or giving them
[9:50] or
[9:51] obligating them by gifts
[9:55] and bringing them under his control
[9:58] and uh domination that way
[10:03] so by teaching and by financial
[10:06] help and financial gifts
[10:10] he was able to maintain a control
[10:14] over the people that were under his
[10:18] charge and that's how he corrupted
[10:22] and conquered those that were
[10:25] under him just as nicholas did
[10:28] the same now friends we find
[10:32] here that
[10:36] this has to continue it continued in the
[10:40] early church
[10:41] and in every age right on down
[10:44] to this very age until it is
[10:48] finally blessed or unexalted
[10:52] or the deeds actions and teachings
[10:55] are destroyed and cast into the lake of
[10:59] fire
[11:01] by our god
[11:04] the book of revelation chapter 2 2 says
[11:07] the ephesian church of course said you
[11:10] could not
[11:11] bear these evil ones amongst you
[11:15] and so they put some of them
[11:18] put them out praise god hallelujah
[11:23] amen but now later in the age we are
[11:27] finding out
[11:28] they're not putting them out anymore
[11:31] they're bearing
[11:32] them or may i put it this way they're
[11:35] putting
[11:36] up with them within the confines
[11:39] of the church that is why judgment
[11:43] must begin in the house of god
[11:47] see it must begin in god's house
[11:50] so then first my friends
[11:54] they got influenced into
[11:58] doing the deeds that these
[12:01] nicolaitans were doing
[12:04] they became influence and
[12:08] impotent the seeds that were in ephesus
[12:13] will continue through the other ages
[12:15] until it becomes a
[12:17] doctrine deeds then
[12:21] doctrine and that will go right on
[12:25] until it is completely cast
[12:28] into the lake of fire
[12:32] now or these nickelodeons
[12:35] the words nico
[12:39] comes from the greek word
[12:42] which means to conquer
[12:45] and laos
[12:48] means the laity or in other words
[12:53] neglection to conquer the
[12:56] laity somebody is doing
[12:59] something or was doing something and in
[13:02] our day
[13:03] is doing something in plain
[13:06] view which was conquering and
[13:09] dominating the laity
[13:12] now if the lady was being conquered
[13:16] then it must be some kind of authority
[13:19] over that laity like nimrod was back
[13:23] then
[13:24] conquering dominating and domineering
[13:28] over the laity
[13:31] what was it that god hated
[13:35] what was it that was happening in that
[13:38] early church
[13:40] what was going on then
[13:44] and is now going on today
[13:47] that is exactly what nicolaitanism
[13:51] is the people were being subject
[13:55] in some way that was absolutely
[13:59] contrary to the word of god and
[14:02] bringing them into the subjection
[14:06] of man through the means
[14:09] of men now friends here
[14:14] a spiritual matter like this is always
[14:17] com uh
[14:18] you know composed of two parts two parts
[14:22] whatsoever
[14:23] as i've mentioned before black and white
[14:25] uh
[14:26] truth and error you know right and wrong
[14:29] it's always that way religion
[14:33] and the spirit world are
[14:36] like that like two trees
[14:39] as i mentioned in the garden that were
[14:42] so close together
[14:44] that their branches were actually
[14:47] intertwined
[14:49] one mixing in to the
[14:52] other now we know of course
[14:55] uh evil stood in the midst of the garden
[14:58] just as much as truth and good
[15:02] there was the tree of life and there was
[15:05] a tree
[15:06] of knowledge that was in the
[15:10] garden there see and that same
[15:13] paradox continues on today
[15:16] the church is made up of both
[15:19] good and bad to our this very day
[15:23] the church is not just a a complete
[15:27] pure uh group of people
[15:30] but the church is made up of good
[15:33] and a bad the two vines
[15:39] twins in the beginning cain and abel
[15:43] the two vines the two trees
[15:47] growing together branches intertwined
[15:51] interrelated within the
[15:54] very uh formation
[15:58] of what we call the church of this
[16:02] day just like jesus spoke of the
[16:06] wheat and the tears and by the way while
[16:09] he was here
[16:10] judas was here see it's like that
[16:14] all down through the bible paul comes to
[16:17] the scene
[16:17] and then he said now friends he says i'm
[16:20] departing
[16:21] but i tell you there are ravening wolves
[16:24] from among your own cells arise men
[16:29] that become ravening wolves
[16:32] right amongst you they're not cheap but
[16:35] they
[16:35] are wolves in sheep's clothing calling
[16:38] themselves
[16:39] christianity and the christians and they
[16:42] are not
[16:43] and behaving in such a way that their
[16:46] nature and and life manifests
[16:50] not god the spirit of the living god but
[16:53] manifests the spirit of nickelodeonism
[16:56] and the spirit of satan working and
[16:59] operating through them
[17:02] in the religious realm under
[17:06] the cloak the guise
[17:09] of religion take off that mask
[17:12] too many are wearing this kind of a
[17:16] sham clothing on we must see you
[17:20] and we do see you by the light of the
[17:23] word
[17:24] in you are in clear view and we discern
[17:28] you
[17:28] by the opening of the word thanks be to
[17:32] god
[17:32] that he has revealed his word to his
[17:35] people
[17:35] who can say i can see clearly now
[17:39] the rain is gone oh thank god
[17:42] all the clouds all of the gloom all of
[17:46] the
[17:46] all of the fog it is it's blasted away
[17:50] it's burnt away because the sun is up
[17:53] and shining upon us and we give god the
[17:57] glory
[17:58] and the honor and the praise today
[18:01] thanks be to god
[18:02] hallelujah but here we are talking about
[18:05] the wheat and the tears
[18:08] growing up together in the same field
[18:11] in the same church in the same womb
[18:15] growing up together side by side
[18:18] a spirit of jacob a spirit of esau
[18:21] working together and one having to call
[18:25] the other
[18:26] my brother the other called the other my
[18:29] brother
[18:30] oh it's right here in your
[18:33] bible but one is true
[18:37] and the other one is false
[18:40] now god will speak to each one
[18:43] you know god spoke to abel but he
[18:47] wanted us to know that not only does he
[18:50] speak to
[18:51] true believers but he speaks to
[18:55] the evil ones also for in your bible in
[18:59] genesis chapter 4 you'll read a brief
[19:01] scripture which says
[19:03] and god said on to cain
[19:06] chapter 4 i believe verse 4 and also
[19:09] verse
[19:10] 6 you'll find the phrase and god
[19:13] said also unto cain so god
[19:16] speak to cain and cain could make the
[19:19] claim
[19:20] that god said god said god said god
[19:24] spoke to him too
[19:25] and you cannot deny it but it must be
[19:29] compared with the original
[19:32] word of god where we can be able to
[19:35] cut through all of the the interruptions
[19:39] all of the voices all of these things
[19:42] and
[19:43] go right straight to the truth of the
[19:46] revelation
[19:47] of the word of god amen
[19:51] so we find speaking to both
[19:56] groups true and false two brothers
[20:00] one true one false and god will
[20:03] call them together the church
[20:07] together he will call them the church
[20:12] so you see then my friends
[20:15] only when when god's word goes out
[20:19] it goes out not only to
[20:22] the true believer for it depends
[20:27] on your hearing and seeing
[20:30] for faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[20:34] by the word of god now
[20:37] one two are sitting in the same
[20:41] church on the same pews
[20:45] both listening to the same message
[20:50] and some will hear it
[20:53] and receive the revelation of it the
[20:56] inner
[20:57] form the inner revelation and
[20:59] understanding
[21:01] while others will hear the same thing
[21:05] and hear the intellectually educated
[21:07] part of it
[21:08] understand it understand english be able
[21:11] to parse it
[21:12] analyze it and debate about it and
[21:15] compare
[21:16] scriptures about it and never arriving
[21:20] at the truth my god friends take a whip
[21:25] this is going on right now while we're
[21:28] speaking
[21:29] we're right within the houses of worship
[21:32] the churches so-called of god the
[21:35] assemblies the groups
[21:37] it's going on right now as we
[21:40] speak the holy spirit but nevertheless
[21:44] only the elect will really be able to
[21:48] discern
[21:49] and know what truly is
[21:52] the spirit of god and
[21:55] only the elect shall
[21:59] not be deceived matthew 24
[22:02] 24 and we understand why they cannot be
[22:05] deceived for they
[22:07] are themselves part of that word
[22:11] chosen in him as a
[22:14] part of himself from before the
[22:19] foundations
[22:20] of the world for he was in there were in
[22:23] his
[22:24] mind and they came forth
[22:28] in their due time as god would have them
[22:31] manifest in whatever
[22:33] age he wanted them to be made manifest
[22:36] they become out manifested
[22:40] not knowing consciously that they're a
[22:43] part
[22:44] of that word of god or or a part of the
[22:47] word or
[22:48] portion of the word germ of the word
[22:51] seed of the word was deposited in them
[22:55] and that they are here to fulfill
[22:58] god's divine purpose and plan
[23:01] for his glory and for his honor
[23:05] how do they know they themselves don't
[23:08] know how they know
[23:10] but they are able to discern
[23:14] and recognize my friends
[23:17] the spirit of god and the spirit of
[23:21] error as it approaches them
[23:24] or tries to communicate with them
[23:27] the scripture says for their shall arise
[23:31] false christs and false prophets and
[23:36] shall shew great signs and
[23:40] wonders amen
[23:43] in so much that if it were possible
[23:47] they shall deceive thee very elected
[23:51] if it were possible it is not possible
[23:55] because if we are part of the word we
[23:57] are as eternal as
[23:59] god himself is eternal if
[24:02] god himself cannot be deceived how can
[24:06] the true
[24:07] genuine believer be deceived they
[24:11] cannot hallelujah for they cannot deny
[24:15] themselves something in them
[24:18] for we have a witness will witness
[24:21] to us that's right that's wrong
[24:25] the holy spirit in you will lead you and
[24:28] guide you
[24:29] for his glory and in his mighty name
[24:32] oh thanks be under god hallelujah
[24:35] amen yes friends
[24:39] back there in early days
[24:42] of the original pentecost acts chapter 2
[24:46] verse 4 for a short period of time
[24:51] after that we find out
[24:55] they had a wonderful time in the
[24:57] presence of god
[24:58] and then that false vine that tree of
[25:02] knowledge
[25:02] began to interweave and intertwine
[25:06] itself
[25:07] together in that early church
[25:11] and entangle itself with the true vine
[25:15] and then we find the deeds of the
[25:18] nickelodeons in that
[25:21] early first church of
[25:25] in jerusalem and many today are claiming
[25:27] they are the first church
[25:28] but this is what happened in the first
[25:30] early church that was there
[25:33] the spirit of nicolasianism began to
[25:36] arise
[25:37] amongst them from saint nick
[25:41] saint nicholas is where
[25:45] this spirit of domination and dominar
[25:49] domineering man-made domineering
[25:52] came from right there and that spirit
[25:56] is right in the church
[26:00] and in the name of christ and in the
[26:03] name of the church
[26:05] fighting the true vine the true seed
[26:10] the original seeds
[26:13] sons and daughters of the living god
[26:16] that lives and moves and have their
[26:20] being by the word of god
[26:23] they are fighting against the true vine
[26:26] and will continue
[26:27] until they are destroyed by god
[26:32] now my friends what was the spiritual
[26:36] climate then
[26:37] in the ephesian church
[26:40] that would allow saint nick
[26:44] nicholas of antioch
[26:50] this proselyte to christianity
[26:54] what then was the atmosphere
[26:57] in the ephesian church that was so on
[27:01] fire and anointed by the ministry of
[27:04] paul
[27:04] timothy luke many others that were
[27:07] anointed by the holy spirit and
[27:10] left them the the original
[27:13] faith the faith that was of our
[27:17] fathers given to the apostolic
[27:20] fathers what was the climate in that
[27:24] ephesian church the bible tells us
[27:26] clearly
[27:27] thou has left thy first love
[27:30] they lost the fire the glory of
[27:34] god had departed the spirit of
[27:37] god was not amongst them as he was
[27:40] at the first amen they
[27:44] left their first love which is the word
[27:48] their first love for the word and that
[27:51] happens
[27:52] anywhere in any church with any
[27:55] believer they can make all the claims
[27:57] they want
[27:58] but their life their action their
[28:01] actions speak
[28:02] louder than their than their words that
[28:05] they have
[28:06] left their first love and wandered away
[28:09] from the word of god hallelujah
[28:13] fallen from its origin
[28:16] which of course was pentecost
[28:20] praise god hallelujah my friends
[28:24] we find out the true church then
[28:28] was in danger in danger
[28:32] from being taken away from the leading
[28:36] of the holy spirit and the control
[28:40] and preeminence of the holy spirit
[28:44] this is exactly what took place
[28:47] when moses led the churn of israel
[28:51] in out of egypt and brought them
[28:55] forth to lead them to the promised land
[28:59] and you see god's way of leading them
[29:03] was by a pillar of fire
[29:07] by night a cloud by day
[29:13] and by god chosen
[29:17] god elected and by
[29:20] god anointed god equipped
[29:24] and god ordained man
[29:27] to be on the scene
[29:31] and god would lead control
[29:36] that entire camp by the
[29:39] leadership of the holy spirit
[29:42] god above us back then
[29:45] in the old testament with israel it was
[29:49] god above us in the purifying
[29:52] cloud of fire and then
[29:55] god among us
[29:59] in god anointed men
[30:03] displayed of course in jesus christ
[30:05] followed by the apostles
[30:07] and so on until this damn time
[30:11] and now the unveiling of god
[30:16] the son of man being revealed again
[30:20] now it is god in us
[30:23] the infilling the possession
[30:27] of the presence of the heavenly father
[30:30] in the true seed wheat
[30:33] seed bride of jesus christ for in that
[30:37] age that day you shall know that
[30:41] i am in the father the father in me
[30:45] and that i am in you glory to god
[30:48] and that is this day praise god
[30:50] forevermore
[30:51] that the blessed holy spirit lives in us
[30:55] moves in us walks in us acts in us talks
[30:58] in us
[30:58] and does everything through us for the
[31:01] glory of god
[31:02] remember this is all supernatural
[31:06] let me say that in a way that you can
[31:08] understand it clear
[31:09] clearer it's super
[31:13] but it's natural it's natural
[31:17] but it's super so we are normal
[31:20] but the holy spirit flows out of us
[31:24] the anointing flows out of us the
[31:26] inspiration
[31:27] the revelation flows out of us
[31:31] god moves and works through his bride
[31:34] in this day and in this hour praise
[31:38] god by prophetic utterance miracles
[31:42] signs and wonders by the opening of the
[31:45] word
[31:46] god anointing his sons and his daughters
[31:49] to declare himself and to make his word
[31:53] known today aren't you happy today my
[31:56] friend
[31:57] aren't you happy wherever you are that
[32:00] we
[32:00] serve not a dead god but the true
[32:03] and a living god who works and
[32:06] moves jesus christ hebrews 13
[32:09] 8 jesus christ the same yesterday
[32:13] today and forever thanks
[32:16] be unto god hallelujah but we find out
[32:21] that they rebelled against god
[32:25] and they rebelled and they wanted two
[32:28] things
[32:30] they wanted a system
[32:34] of a set of rules
[32:39] one they wanted a system
[32:43] or set of rules predictable
[32:47] for them to live and walk and march by
[32:52] secondly they wanted to have a
[32:56] visible king over them
[33:01] like the other nations
[33:04] and today we say demon nations
[33:09] denominations they wanted to have a
[33:12] superintendent an apostle of prophet
[33:16] whatever above them
[33:19] they wanted to have that kind of a
[33:22] visible leadership
[33:24] listen friends god use a prophet
[33:28] god use men of god to guide us to the
[33:31] perfect light
[33:33] once we've seen the light it's not the
[33:36] prophet it's not the apostle it's not
[33:38] the superintendent
[33:40] it's you and him alone
[33:45] not my brother not my sister it's me o
[33:49] lord standing in the need of prayer
[33:52] not my father not my brother not the
[33:55] pastor
[33:56] not the deacon it's you it's
[34:00] me it's the individual
[34:04] must surrender themselves to the
[34:06] leadership
[34:07] and guidance of the holy spirit
[34:10] for he shall be called wonderful counsel
[34:13] of the mighty god
[34:14] he is the governor and he governs us
[34:18] and guides us not only our savior
[34:21] but he is our lord oh thanks be to
[34:25] god that we have him as our savior
[34:28] our redeemer and we have him in our
[34:31] lives
[34:32] with lordship over us leading us how
[34:36] by the revelation of the word
[34:39] what is being revealed in the moment in
[34:41] time and it will always agree
[34:44] with that which is written it will not
[34:46] be different
[34:47] but it will be exactly what is in the
[34:49] word
[34:51] and so they wanted the king they wanted
[34:54] to be
[34:54] like the rest of groups and churches
[34:57] that seem to be
[34:58] wonderful and successful with walled
[35:01] cities
[35:04] we will not talk about that or discuss
[35:06] those walled cities now
[35:07] because we still have the walled cities
[35:09] named churches name
[35:11] groups name denominations now that they
[35:14] protect and surround it and everything
[35:17] else with all manner of
[35:19] spiritual armaments to make sure that
[35:21] they
[35:22] have their numbers and everything else
[35:24] that's another
[35:25] discussion but they do have these
[35:28] denominations
[35:30] around and the people wanted to
[35:33] leave and that is the reason why they
[35:36] couldn't understand moses
[35:38] they couldn't they can't understand
[35:41] really
[35:41] spirit-led spirit-filled and anointed
[35:44] men of god for today because people
[35:48] are looking for a definite written
[35:51] or spoken set of rules
[35:54] that they are to live by but when a man
[35:57] or a
[35:58] woman or a person moves by the holy
[36:01] spirit
[36:01] where does the wind blows where it lists
[36:04] no
[36:04] man knows where it goes because it's led
[36:07] by the holy spirit
[36:09] they're confused by it and uh the world
[36:12] has taught them to have
[36:13] confidence in systems and rules
[36:17] line one line two line three line four
[36:19] it's all there
[36:21] and they have to live by that uh in that
[36:23] kind of a regimented
[36:25] uh system that they have and still
[36:28] saying they're free
[36:29] my friends but when they come into
[36:33] something where they the holy spirit
[36:35] controls it to them it seems like
[36:37] confusion
[36:39] so to them it seems like an excuse
[36:43] for chaos they don't understand that
[36:46] the rain comes from a rugged jagged sky
[36:51] there is no form no crumbliness no shape
[36:54] it comes as god brings it by the blessed
[36:58] holy
[36:58] spirit anointed and guided by the living
[37:02] one
[37:03] who lives and works and moves
[37:06] within our hearts hallelujah yes sir
[37:09] and so we find out it moved then
[37:13] from just being a deed
[37:16] necklacianism began to become a doctrine
[37:20] notice carefully i said it moved from
[37:23] just being
[37:24] deeds of the nickelodeons they started
[37:28] to put forth teaching
[37:30] which would be doctrines of
[37:33] the nickelodeons and it started so
[37:36] quietly innocently under the guise of
[37:40] religion
[37:41] but it pushed aside the truth it pushed
[37:44] aside
[37:44] the light of the word of god it started
[37:48] small
[37:49] and quietly it began to take
[37:52] over inoffensively
[37:56] it seemed as if it was even sound
[37:59] but it was contrary to the word of god
[38:02] for like a python
[38:06] like an anaconda
[38:09] it slowly placed its
[38:12] coils around and begin to
[38:16] squeeze the breath of life out of the
[38:19] church
[38:21] and to kill out spirituality
[38:24] that was in the church we ought to know
[38:27] what we are doing it ought to be done
[38:29] this way this way this way one two three
[38:31] four and we have our books we have our
[38:33] uh fundamentals we have our our
[38:36] standards of
[38:37] and so on and you can live by that
[38:40] uh you see praise god we are gonna set
[38:43] the word of god in order so you can
[38:45] understand it
[38:46] and then you go live by that oh my the
[38:48] holy spirit is not able
[38:50] to according to them to be able to do
[38:53] that for himself
[38:54] to his own believers amen
[38:58] oh my friend the false vine is subtle
[39:01] very subtle comes in like an
[39:05] angel of light until it gets a hold of
[39:09] you
[39:09] i hope he does not get the hold of you
[39:13] i believe of course in leadership
[39:18] but it is not the leadership of man
[39:23] i believe in the leadership of the holy
[39:25] spirit
[39:27] leading his people and
[39:30] working through the word
[39:33] i believe that god has also god has set
[39:37] in the church as you know in the book of
[39:40] ephesians apostles
[39:42] prophets teachers evangelists and so on
[39:44] in the word of god
[39:46] who are gifted they're moved by the holy
[39:50] spirit they're
[39:50] under his guidance so it's still the
[39:53] holy spirit
[39:54] using man to keep the church of god
[39:58] in order hallelujah praise god
[40:02] hallelujah amen i believe god
[40:05] sends men and men does the work of god
[40:08] for his glory
[40:10] but the rule is by the word
[40:14] by the word and so it is not men
[40:18] that are really ruling and guiding the
[40:21] church
[40:21] it's the holy spirit in and through
[40:24] those men
[40:25] that are leading and guiding the church
[40:28] as the scripture tells us in hebrews 13
[40:30] 7 remember them which have the rule over
[40:34] you
[40:35] who have spoken unto you the
[40:38] word of god whose revelation
[40:42] whose faith follow considering
[40:47] the end of their conversation
[40:50] the end of their journey where they're
[40:53] going to end up that's where you're
[40:54] going to end up
[40:55] if you follow their revelation where
[40:58] that revelation is leading to so my
[41:01] friends
[41:02] here we see here clearly in the word of
[41:05] god
[41:05] the false vine was getting a hold and
[41:08] beginning to teach
[41:10] on the rulership of man we will get
[41:13] into a lot more of this in our
[41:16] next bible study on the
[41:20] seven church ages as we continue
[41:24] to study to unveil
[41:27] and disclose what
[41:30] who and how of nicolaitanism
[41:35] then and nickelodeonism
[41:38] now make no mistake about it
[41:42] the spirit of nickelodeonism is here
[41:46] and make no mistake about it
[41:49] god also has men
[41:53] through whom he works so that he
[41:56] is actually the leader god above us
[42:01] anointing on the shepherds and leading
[42:04] his church
[42:05] through those anointed gifted
[42:08] god-equipped
[42:09] man through the blessed holy spirit
[42:14] may god bless you my friends rejoice in
[42:18] the lord
[42:19] eat from the lord's table break from
[42:23] this bread of life
[42:25] listen to it again and straighten your
[42:29] soul
