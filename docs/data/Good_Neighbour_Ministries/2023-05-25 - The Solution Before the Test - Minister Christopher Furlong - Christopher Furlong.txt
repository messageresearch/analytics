came into this world or something by mistake that we are here what is not so God placed you here for a purpose and a reason see many years ago I ministered on a message we are God's test piece amen and as materials go through stages of various testing to see the strength or the quality that's in those materials so if two you and I must go through trials and testings for every son or daughter of God must be tried and tested you just can't get away from it because you came with certain properties certain qualities in you and you don't know about it so God is after put you under some pressure to bring out those qualities to bring all this strength to bring out the endurance that you have in you you don't know it just like Abraham Abraham didn't know the amount of faith that he had until God placed on challenges in his life amen and then he was proclaimed to have faith amen and that's how he overcame amen the tests and the trials and in life's journey every one of us from a tender age we go through many tests and examination I guess every single one of you all must have been to school some maybe after uh uh college and something University level amen hallelujah and life's journey from a 10-day age right we go through test to move forward in life to be promoted to be certified like a doctor or a lawyer they got to go through certain examinations and tests and procedures and and all these things for them to get certified amen hallelujah and I pray tonight that God put place a stamp on you certified Christian certified son or daughter amen hallelujah even as a driver we go

here to live not just to survive amen and you as God's chosen children here tonight amen you're supposed to be one of the happiest people on this Earth tonight amen because I want to let you know that you have all the remedy all the answers for Satan's attack on your life don't you well we have the Emmanuel here tonight amen we gotta go and show you where it's at amen and we gotta study it and find where it's at amen hallelujah you see so men are looking for answers isn't this world falling apart amen and they don't have no answers to the problems that they're facing none whatsoever couple weeks ago visited my doctor right and we were talking about people can find doctors for themselves they lost big shortage of doctors here in Canada amen amen you can't get appointment to do this you can't have an appointment to do that even a little blood tests a little scan or whatever so he was talking like that eh and he said the psychiatrist offices are overbooked over booked and you are saying that so many people committing suicides so many we don't really hear about it you know too much you know they just keep that on the cover but people can't face the pressures that have been placed upon them but God not going to give you allow Satan to give you more than you can bear you're gonna have to overcome amen he already knows how much he can take he knows he kind of pressure you can take and you're going to overcome it amen hallelujah so those squeal and squirm and cry and borrow any pressure come you say when you fall into trials and fiery Temptations you know rejoice because God is greater than your problem and he already has the solution for your problem Hallelujah so I want I want you to be encouraged tonight no matter what you're going through amen it may seem dismal it may seem dark whatever but there is a man here that can turn on the lights amen he can show you the way amen out of every try allowed test that you're going through Hallelujah so my doctor he was talking like that and say you know so much of people there you know and in the psychiatrists they just lined up on all stuff like that and my doctor he's a Christian I say you know what the only answer is I said the only answer is Jesus man he said that's so right Chris he says that is so right amen the only answer is Jesus but they don't want the answer amen they're looking for the doctor for a cure and I told him I said Doctor you are surely a blessing sent from God to be used in this time God is using you to help the people amen but we don't place all all he can do is diagnose is your case in the best of his knowledge and place the rest into God's hands men and pray to God you're giving the right medication for your problem man amen because he could only give you what he know but there's someone who knows about that amen before this disease come here already killed for it amen hallelujah and you know why I'm going with that now before there was a sin problem God already had a solution for it amen thank God for that amen that's what it's all about hallelujah amen hallelujah praise be the name of the Lord amen this is an erotical age nobody has a minute why it used to be that we could go over and visit our neighbor but now we are so busy we don't even have time for prayer not the fruit amen why our prayer services have been deserted you don't wait until you get into a situation you know to call up did you kind of call up the pasta and eat pray I went to a funeral just this past week of a good close friend of ours whose son died in a motorcycle accident and we were there and there was a priest there and he was saying listen and we were just talking I know we're coming to church myself and sister farida you know we gotta store up some spiritual things that he was talking in that fashion amen you know he's talking and he is not even a Christian he said you gotta make a spiritual deposit so when the hard times come you could go and withdraw from that deposit so if you are not nearly Bank what you're going to go to nothing from nothing brings right amen so when you have the chance when you have the time store up some spiritual things in your spiritual bank that you can go and draw and that spiritual Bank draws lots of dividends bankrupt at all not at all you'll get rewards upon Rewards a hundredfold a thousand fall it's not like a one percent a half percent a little Bountiful Supply Hallelujah praise be to the name of the Lord thank you Lord Jesus you know what there was a a a a lady by the name of Susanna Wesley amen you know she had 17 children men and she didn't had any automatic washer or dryer she had to go down this by the well and fetch the water with a wooden bucket I know if you know about that but it was a poor wooden pole one bucket on this side and one on that side another carried on your shoulder and pray to God before you reach home half of the water no spill anyway laughs we'll go by the Riverside and we say we we have a saying back home I don't know if you know that but your scrub they close with your hand I want to tell you we call it your visitor Stone right and the scrubber with your hands amen and you know she had time three hours every day to sit down these children two to three hours and teach them about the Bible read it to them amen and outer that came at John and Charles amen hallelujah so she made an investment today amen we've got to make some investment on this side too amen hallelujah and you're going to get great dividends amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord we're so busy going somewhere and going nowhere we have a saying back there you're spinning top in mud or your car stuck and you're tired just spinning but you need mud and you ain't going anywhere just making a whole set of noise and making a set of commotion and you're not progressing at all in life don't be stuck in a sub situation like that amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah so we see when was the long sleeve was it slain 2000 years ago maybe 100 million years ago it was slain before the foundation of this world before the world was ever formed Jesus died for your sins so before I even make one single fall before I even come into this world God already had a solution for your sin problem amen and that's what it's all about that's the good news amen if you have one message just to tell your friends your family Jesus died for your sins Jesus saved you have to know no big set of Revelation the whole Bible just one little nugget from it amen hallelujah simple gospel men and let your life be an example to them that you live in what you're preaching amen hallelujah that's what Christianity is about a man not to be speaking about you know it's good you know to know the higher Revelation but these simple things the God dwells in simplicity amen and it's simple-minded people God chooses nor the entire intellect and MIT amen hallelujah common folks like us sitting here tonight amen hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name Hallelujah before there was a sin problem the solution was already available amen hallelujah praise be to God before there was a world Jesus died to save it amen hallelujah well you say why did God infinite God ever permitted sin you you never I mean ask that question why did God do this why didn't God allow this why did God cause this by God they're blaming God for everything amen meanwhile someone else calls it amen but you're blaming Lord but you see he had this solution for already that that problem that is so because he is infinite he knows all things amen hallelujah amen this is all about what this is about eh I have nothing new to tell you tonight just a little reminder amen as somebody nuggets that you have been receiving over the years and years amen amen hallelujah so it might be you know it might be a tasty pot tonight jumping up and screaming and hollering and it's peppery and it's fiery and all this kind of thing but simple words of life amen see what Jesus when when he says put the people to sit down and he taught them so they could listen amen amen not jumping around and you know prancing and dancing and all this kind of thing you know quiet desperate though so they can hear amen they can really really listen to what you are saying hallelujah praise be to God you know Hallelujah you say well why did God infinite God ever permit sin you know there's attributes in God amen if God would have never permitted Satan he knew any place and he created Lucifer that he was the one to corrupt the world amen he just knew it man he didn't cause him to do it he is in his own self he he lifted up his aha amen and he wanted to overthrow what God has already done amen hallelujah you see our Gods Not something little pushed off in one corner but he's the infinite God who never had a beginning and will never have an end men and in him there are attributes men he is a savior do you know him as your savior tonight hallelujah how could he ever be known as a savior if they hadn't have been something to save amen so something had to be lost so he could come and save it to prove that he's a savior amen we would have never known him if he were if it were never lost a man in that capacity and we gotta thank God we couldn't do it no man could have ever done it but he himself had to do it for us in Hallelujah praise be to God the Bible said amen that the Antichrist would be so close that he would deceive the very elect if it was possible if but it's not possible part of himself so if part of God is in you you cannot be deceived amen you have the problem they are the solution for Satan problems and Satan tests that comes in your life every question that he plays before you every question every dog that he brings before you you already have the answer to give it to him amen hallelujah man so when the tests come you just pull out the manual say listen it is written you see wait Satan it is written and God word does not lie it does not fail by his stripes I am already healed so you better move aside get the hands man so that pain you're having that thing that the doctors say is trying for you to accept it is not there it's not yours don't receive it send it back amen say return to send that amen hallelujah then praise be to God hallelujah you see all those names who were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life those are the ones that are going to be deceived that's not you and I that's for them out there so if they have to be deceived you can help it amen young I have it they got to be deceived and there comes certain conditions around their lives for them to be deceived they don't want to accept it amen hallelujah they're gonna accept that lie and be damned diet Hallelujah you see you are God Abraham's chosen seed are you amen hallelujah you see God chose you you didn't choose yourself we've been hearing this over and over and over again amen hallelujah and I want to enter Jackie a little bit you know Noah you ever hear about Noah were you if you were any days what are you preaching they're coming a flood 10 years pass Noah was your message but often knowing change your message is the same thing you're preaching every day to destroy 20 years past 50 years next thing does he knows and building this big boot amen no I know he's a crackpot no I know he gone insane you change this man we're here in this thing so long we see if they don't already if they knew that the same God know our preaching when you gotta create and bring the amount of water that bring that flood opted that boat where it was up and he mounted amen hallelujah so don't let this be too common to you or you mean that I could say this same thing again I hear the surveillance why you talk something deep see God is a God as simple we as human beings need to be reminded time and time again to keep our Focus don't be shifted you know keep our Focus let our sight backside and our front side be in line Amen Let the revelation of the word be you know your Target in your Insight that you can you know look straight ahead and look to the promises of God that he has given to you I mean you see God who is a prophet see God will take a prophet right and show him a panoramic view of everything so you gotta tell you what happened what is happening presently in your life and he's going to tell you what's in the future so if you had a sickness what's something that caused us and he could have gone and said okay that causes sickness you're suffering right now from it by a senior heel you already see the future amen and that's God man so when God spoke to Daniel they had a paneric view of everything and that's why they could have gone and written these things down amen and When God Says something it does not feel it must come to pass so when you read any Book of Revelation all these things amen amen hallelujah those things must come to pass Hallelujah because that's what God showed and revealed it unto his servants the prophets amen that they could have seen into the future they could have seen the solution the Saudi problem and they're seeing the solution to one time write it or this is going to happen that is going to happen this is going to happen amen hallelujah and God says you are an overcomer amen do you believe that so it's in your future you see that you already overcome so don't let Satan beat you and put you down amen hallelujah that you are an overcomer so don't matter what problems or tests or examination whatever he challenges that Satan placed before you you already overcame them don't you believe that tonight do you believe that tonight Hallelujah to God be the praise and honor and Glory Hallelujah excuse me Hallelujah see we have to be what we are gifts and callings are without repentance when you were born in this world before the world ever begun God knew you did he if he is God he knew you amen hallelujah before Jeremiah was informed in his mother's womb God knew him it had been a prophet so you believe God didn't know you you don't you don't believe that you could be born in a certain time among a certain race amongst certain people in which country what language what environment whatever wherever you're going to grow up and who you're going to marry how many children you're going to have all the possessions and everything amen men so they say God he makes you rich amen rich in whose eyes if you make a healthy in whose eyes in his eyes you're already healthy you are really wealthy you're already wise amen hallelujah you are the wise man a man that reading Emmanuel and seeing things that are to come amen you know news today amen amen amen hallelujah glory to God praise God you were born in this world before the world ever begin God knew you positionally placed you amen so God know what position you're going to hold in this life so what you're fighting up for I want to be this I want to be tapped I want to be the other just tore up the gifts that God placed in your life and he go manifest amen hallelujah they will come out naturally amen be yourself don't try to be somebody else just be yourself and God will bless you amen hallelujah he's in for night he knows all things he knows the end from the beginning he isn't willing that any Shall Perish that's not his desire but being God he had to know who would and who would not you see like Jacob and Esau amen mama's boy amen hallelujah Hallelujah he hated one and he loved the other before they were even born and had a chance to do anything amen hallelujah praise be to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord praise God now watch the ten virgins that went out all of them virgins five of them were foolish five had oil in the alarms amen that's right they were all virgins they lived a good clean life amen you say well brother I don't go to dances I don't go to shows that's just the moral things you do like some religion they teach you moral things do good do good do good you see but it's not by works or by righteousness is but by his blood alone that you could be saved men that's like the good Christians amen hallelujah a lot of do good religion amen I just putting on a religious quote I do good quote amen but there got to be an internal change your nature got to be changed from the inside out man and it's got a show amen hallelujah praise God unless there hasn't been a supernatural experience and change in your life you can shout you can scream all you can speak with tongues not because you showed it not because you spoke with tones not because you jump up and down not because you did this but something supernatural has to happen Insider here amen to change your life to change your mind to change the way you think amen hallelujah you got to be born again amen hallelujah you got to go through the new birth and then God will place his stamp in your heart amen his love in your heart that you are one of his men and no seed could be quickened unless if they didn't come with that predestinated seed that's already placed inside of him that's what this is about amen all the word does is bring out what's already in them amen amen the water white comes just to bring out what what was there already you can't change that amen but what happens is the manifestation and that change is going to show outside man Hallelujah the life that was inside needs to be brought to life by the quickening power of the word of God and his spirit amen shall manifest through you amen hallelujah thanks be to the name of God hallelujah you see praise God you see God in his infinite mind looking down through the stream of time he saw what would take place and how he would have to create and drop down into time and space to pull out those that were his are you part of him Hallelujah so he came to pull you out from this world amen hallelujah Hallelujah the great magnet the man
