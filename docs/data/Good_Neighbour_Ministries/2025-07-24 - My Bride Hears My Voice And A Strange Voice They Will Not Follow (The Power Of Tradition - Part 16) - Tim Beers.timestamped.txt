[2:02] life and the world and work and this and
[2:05] that and the other thing. But my my my

[4:27] [Music]
[4:41] enough
[4:44] than enough for me.
[4:50] Praise God. Heavenly Father, tonight
[4:53] Lord, that resonates within us, Lord,
[4:56] because it's so true that whatever the
[4:58] need, whatever the situation, the place
[5:01] that you have placed us in, Father, is
[5:05] more than enough to meet the challenge
[5:07] of the day. And we're so grateful
[5:09] tonight, Lord, that we can come into
[5:10] your presence like this and
[5:13] just lift up holy hands.
[5:17] The devil might say no. But but the
[5:21] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[5:23] all sin, all unbelief. So we can lift up
[5:26] holy hands. We can come before the
[5:29] throne of God boldly. We have a right to
[5:32] be here because of the lamb of God who
[5:34] taketh away the sin of the world. So we
[5:36] stand here tonight just giving you all
[5:39] the praise and all the glory and all the
[5:41] honor, Lord, because you're more than
[5:43] enough. Hallelujah. We pray that you'll
[5:45] just bless your people this this this
[5:47] night. Lord, bless brother Tim as you
[5:50] would come and bring the word of God.
[5:51] Let him just be a vessel
[5:55] that will speak the word and the word
[5:56] only because as the brothers always say
[5:59] when they pray, we're not interested in
[6:01] man's opinion. And that's true, Lord.
[6:03] This is not a day for man's opinion.
[6:05] It's a day for the pure word of God. May
[6:07] you flow through your servant, the
[6:08] Father. Use the gift. And may everyone
[6:11] here be satisfied and joy full of joy
[6:14] and love and peace and the word of God
[6:16] as we go out to face another day.
[6:18] Father, we thank you for this glorious
[6:19] opportunity. Blessed be the name of the
[6:22] Lord Jesus. We thank you Lord in Jesus
[6:24] lovely name. Praise God. Someone give
[6:26] him a hand clap this morning, this
[6:28] afternoon, this evening, whatever it is.
[6:31] God bless you. You can be seated. EAP,
[6:35] can you put up the bloodline, please?
[6:38] the words.
[6:40] You know, I was singing that song more
[6:42] than enough while I was working the
[6:43] other day and uh earlier on this week
[6:45] and my my my just about ready to burst.
[6:48] And I said, "I better not. These guys
[6:50] won't understand what's going on.
[6:51] They'll think you're crazy."
[6:53] But sometimes, oh boy, I feel like that
[6:56] right now. But even though my spirit's
[7:00] slow
[7:01] and it seems I can hardly go, but still
[7:08] I see victory.
[7:15] And at times I'm walking by faith.
[7:19] I can't see what lies before me. Heat.

[9:50] tonight.

[17:05] Welcome into the house of the Lord this
[17:06] evening. Amen. You've come with
[17:08] expectation in your hearts. I believe
[17:11] you'll leave rejoicing. Amen. Uh
[17:14] tonight, I'd like to uh bring a a prayer
[17:17] request. A good friend of mine, Tony,
[17:20] and his wife, Rose, are asking for
[17:22] prayer for their daughter, Tanya. She's
[17:26] going for a special procedure tomorrow.
[17:29] Um, they've they've been um they've got
[17:32] their first child. They'd like to have a
[17:33] second child. And so, they're going for
[17:36] a procedure tomorrow, and they're asking
[17:38] for prayer. And so, we will take that
[17:40] before the Lord tonight and uh leave it
[17:43] in the hands of the Lord. Amen. and then
[17:46] we'll invite our precious brother to
[17:47] come and minister the word of God. Let's
[17:50] all bow our heads in prayer.
[17:53] Great Jehovah God,
[17:55] creator of heaven and earth,
[17:59] the giver of life of all things. Lord,
[18:02] that only by you does anything exist.
[18:06] And we are so grateful for that tonight,
[18:09] Lord, that we are coming to the one and
[18:12] only creator, our Lord and Savior Jesus
[18:17] Christ. And Father, we bring this
[18:19] request for Tanya, Lord, the daughter of
[18:24] Tony and Rose Kella,
[18:28] uh lovely people, Father, that have been
[18:31] so good to us and kind. And Lord,
[18:34] they're just asking for a special prayer
[18:37] for their daughter. And Lord, we're
[18:38] asking you, great Jehovah God, to take
[18:41] control. And Lord, if it is in your
[18:44] will, we pray that your desire, it would
[18:48] be fulfilled in her life and in her
[18:51] husband, Stefan. Father, that you would
[18:54] visit them, Lord, and give them a child.
[18:59] Granted, Father, we love you. We
[19:02] appreciate you. We know that you're the
[19:04] giver of life. And so we give you thanks
[19:07] and praise. And now as we go into this
[19:11] aspect of the service, may you take your
[19:14] servant once again. Lord, move him aside
[19:17] and let your spirit just come and speak
[19:20] to our hearts. And Lord, you know the
[19:22] needs of your people. Lord, your word
[19:25] was sent to heal the people. May you
[19:29] heal hearts tonight. those that would
[19:32] that would listen in online, Father, may
[19:34] your anointing move and may there be no
[19:38] distance and no time, Lord, between each
[19:41] and every heart and every need, Father.
[19:44] Meet the needs granted, Father, we give
[19:48] you thanks in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[19:51] God bless you, Brother Tim. Come and
[19:54] have your liberty. Thank you.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[19:59] Amen. It's good to be here tonight.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're happy to be here
[20:04] tonight.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can be seated. Amen.
[20:13] Hallelujah.
[20:16] Amen.
[20:18] Good to be in the house of the Lord
[20:19] tonight.
[20:21] Well, you know, a good preacher, they
[20:24] said, um,
[20:26] preaches 80%
[20:29] everything over and over and over again.
[20:32] I think it's because that it takes time
[20:34] for us for it to sink down deep. God
[20:37] knows that. So, we got to preach it over
[20:39] and over and over. But the other 20% has
[20:43] nothing to do with the preacher.
[20:45] Amen. It's between you and the Lord.
[20:48] Amen. And that's what we really want to
[20:50] receive tonight. We've always this this
[20:53] I I believe this message from a prophet
[20:56] broke us into another dimension and
[20:59] we've been hearing about the the the
[21:01] dimensions, right?
[21:03] Speaking in tongues or something and um
[21:07] we've been hearing about it, right? And
[21:11] we know that it's here, but we also know
[21:13] that he's here. And that's how that's
[21:16] who we don't get in contact with him.
[21:20] Amen. We don't hear his voice.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; You can hear my voice and you can hear
[21:28] 80% tonight and walk out of here without
[21:31] hearing his voice. It brings no life, no
[21:34] change. Amen. Hallelujah. So we gather
[21:38] here together not because of titles,
[21:41] not even because of gifts, though God
[21:44] uses them, but we gather here to come
[21:46] into his presence.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; To hear his voice.
[21:51] If you haven't prayed
[21:54] like you should have prayed and got in
[21:57] contact with him, then do it now. Amen.
[22:01] So that he can speak to your heart.
[22:04] Because if you rely on preachers and and
[22:07] you know, you might just be
[22:08] disappointed.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; I rely on I rely on him to speak from
[22:13] that other dimension to your soul.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. this voice
[22:19] translating the still small voice.
[22:22] That's what brings life. That's what
[22:24] brings change. Amen.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:28] So, let us turn to the word tonight. I'm
[22:31] going to start a couple parts series
[22:33] here, right? Uh about um the title
[22:36] tonight is my bride hears my voice
[22:40] and a strange voice she will not follow.
[22:43] Mhm.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; It's impossible for her to follow a
[22:45] strange voice in this hour.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz all she hears is his voice.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want to lay a little
[22:51] foundation tonight. And then the next
[22:54] part we want to get into where is the
[22:58] voice of God in this day. There's a lot
[22:59] of confusion with that. Where the voice
[23:01] of God is in this hour, in this day.
[23:04] Some say it's just in the tapes.
[23:07] Some say it's just in certain anointed
[23:09] men, certain gifts.
[23:12] I don't believe that. Or just in the
[23:14] five-fold ministry. No, I don't believe
[23:18] that. We're going to take the next
[23:20] service and and bring out what the
[23:22] prophet said, what the word says, where
[23:24] his his voice is in this hour.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; This is an hour of recognizing who we
[23:30] are.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; That's it, brother.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; If if there's never been an hour, that's
[23:34] the rapture.
[23:36] That's the quickening power
[23:37] &gt;&gt; in us to realize who we are in this hour
[23:41] and who he is.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; There's a consciousness coming,
[23:45] &gt;&gt; an atmosphere.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; You want to call it the other dimension
[23:49] of the rapture. Amen. Our theophony is
[23:52] closing in.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; And that's it. It's it's it's it's a
[23:58] late hour. It's a late hour to be
[24:02] messing around. And let me tell you,
[24:04] Satan is fighting.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Leoian spirit, lukewarm, lazy,
[24:10] powerless, a Christian formal life.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; He's fighting in this hour. He's
[24:15] fighting right in the message.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; I I've been preaching it. We've been
[24:21] preaching it here for many years, but my
[24:23] last series, the denominational spirit.
[24:25] A lot of people that want to believe it.
[24:27] Ah, it's not in the message.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Watch out.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; It's not here. traditions and all these
[24:33] things, culture,
[24:35] separation, all these stuff. It's here.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; It's here. Man's interpretations is
[24:41] here.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; But also the bride.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; The little bride is here.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:49] And one man, one little bride with God
[24:52] is the majority.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. don't take a lot when she raises
[24:57] up in the same created spoken power word
[25:01] of God inside of her and she comes to
[25:03] that place where God is going to bring
[25:05] her and is bringing her where she'll
[25:07] speak the word of God.
[25:11] She's speaking the word of God now, but
[25:13] there's prophecies
[25:15] that is coming when she speaks in that
[25:18] time. It'll be God himself.
[25:22] Amen.
[25:24] John 10:27.
[25:28] Hallelujah. Simple scriptures,
[25:31] but may God
[25:34] quicken the word to us tonight.
[25:36] You pray for me as I preach
[25:40] that I get out of the way.
[25:43] My sheep hear my voice
[25:48] and I know them.
[25:51] Listen
[25:53] to his words. And they follow me,
[25:58] and I give unto them eternal life,
[26:02] and they shall never perish.
[26:07] Neither shall any man
[26:10] pluck them out of my hand.
[26:14] Oh, hallelujah.
[26:17] Amen. I started rejoicing reading that
[26:20] scripture.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; It's just wonderful. Amen. I hear the
[26:26] voice of my beloved speaking to me.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, every day I hear his voice. Amen.
[26:33] Hallelujah. Let's turn to Hebrews 4:7.
[26:36] The voice of God is always
[26:39] misinterpreted.
[26:41] Jesus Christ will never interpret
[26:45] his own voice. Jesus Christ will
[26:47] interpret his own voice. Sorry. Jesus
[26:50] said, "My sheep hear my voice and a
[26:54] stranger they will not follow." Hebrews
[26:57] 7:47
[27:03] again he limit a certain day saying in
[27:07] David today after so long a time as it
[27:10] is said today if ye will hear his voice
[27:17] the word the revelation
[27:20] now you can't do it
[27:22] &gt;&gt; he's not he's not proclaiming that
[27:25] &gt;&gt; for you to do it. You can't do it. But
[27:29] if he gives you grace, an election
[27:34] to hear his voice, his word, the
[27:36] revelation,
[27:41] harden not your hearts.
[27:44] There are so many things in this life
[27:47] as Paul said, endure hardness as a good
[27:50] soldier. We are being tested on every
[27:53] side, every angle.
[27:56] the bride of Jesus Christ, Satan is
[27:58] throwing everything on her to try to
[28:02] harden her heart. And when a heart gets
[28:05] hardened, they can't hear the voice of
[28:08] God.
[28:11] For if Jesus had given them rest, then
[28:13] would he have not afterwards have spoken
[28:16] of another day, there remainth therefore
[28:18] a rest to the people of God. For he that
[28:22] is entered into his rest, he also has
[28:25] ceased from his own works.
[28:30] And God as God did from his. Let us
[28:33] labor therefore to enter into that rest,
[28:39] lest any man fall after the same example
[28:42] of unbelief.
[28:45] For the word of God,
[28:48] and the word of God is the voice of God,
[28:52] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[28:56] any two-edged sword, piercing even and
[29:00] dividing a sunder of soul and spirit.
[29:03] You see what the voice of God does? This
[29:06] is what the voice of God does to an
[29:09] individual when you hear his voice.
[29:14] and the joints and the marrows and the
[29:16] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[29:19] the heart.
[29:22] Out of his mouth went the sharp
[29:24] two-edged sword which is
[29:28] the word of God. Amen. Let's pray.
[29:31] Father, thank you Lord tonight that we
[29:34] are gathered together by faith.
[29:38] Lord,
[29:40] nothing pleases you but faith.
[29:45] Lord, let there be faith raised up.
[29:49] Let us go higher tonight, Lord.
[29:52] There is no great person here but you,
[29:55] Father.
[29:57] And your lovely bride loves you tonight,
[30:00] Lord.
[30:02] Speak to our hearts. We're talking on
[30:05] the voice of God. No man could interpret
[30:08] it, Lord. Come and interpret your own
[30:10] word, your own voice, by manifesting it.
[30:14] That's the way you've always done it,
[30:16] Lord. You've always interpret your word
[30:19] by manifesting it, Father. And that's
[30:22] what the bride has the ability in this
[30:24] hour, Lord. that has been given to her
[30:27] through the Holy Ghost to see this word
[30:31] manifested, Father, and you moving in
[30:33] our midst and manifest in yourself.
[30:37] Grant these things, Father. Take
[30:39] control.
[30:40] Pour out your spirit as you promised
[30:42] upon all flesh here and online.
[30:47] Take control of your servant.
[30:50] Take control of the hearer. In Jesus
[30:52] name we ask. Amen. God bless you as
[30:54] you're seated. Like I said, we're going
[30:56] to be laying a foundation
[30:59] um down and I forgot my uh drink and
[31:04] it's on your desk there. Thank you,
[31:06] pastor.
[31:09] Lay, like I said, laid a foundation, but
[31:12] let the Holy Spirit have his way here
[31:13] tonight. Amen.
[31:17] and God.
[31:19] I'm going to speak I'm going to lay down
[31:22] a a few quotes here to lay down a
[31:24] foundation.
[31:26] We want to hear what the prophet said
[31:29] about the voice of God. Thank you.
[31:30] You're welcome. And God has promised to
[31:34] meet the need of the hour.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:40] God has promised to meet
[31:44] every need
[31:46] in this hour.
[31:52] Why do we doubt?
[31:56] Why do we question?
[32:00] Why don't we just believe what God has
[32:02] said?
[32:04] Hallelujah.
[32:08] He always does that.
[32:11] And we need the voice of God today
[32:15] to meet the need of the hour. That's
[32:19] what we need.
[32:22] We might think we need this.
[32:25] We might need church. We might need uh
[32:30] group fellowships. We we might need
[32:32] conventions. We might need to go here.
[32:35] We might need to go there, but we need
[32:38] the voice of God,
[32:41] today,
[32:43] more than anything. This is the latest
[32:46] hour. This is the darkest hour. This is
[32:50] the most deceiving time of any age of
[32:55] any time that we're living in right now.
[32:59] This is the hour where Satan is putting
[33:02] people to sleep.
[33:04] People are falling away.
[33:06] Amen. People are becoming more religious
[33:11] in this message. More religious,
[33:15] powerless,
[33:17] no power in their life, no power of the
[33:20] Holy Ghost, but can out quote you,
[33:25] out scripture you,
[33:28] maybe even live a cleaner life than you
[33:31] outwardly.
[33:33] What an age we're living in. No other
[33:37] time
[33:38] that we need the voice of God. You say,
[33:41] "Brother Tim, I got the voice of God
[33:43] when I listen to the brother Brandham in
[33:44] the tapes."
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Listen, Brother Brandham himself said,
[33:51] "There will come men after
[33:54] the five-fold ministry that will break
[33:56] these highlights down that I've spoken."
[34:00] Now that opens up the door to every
[34:04] preacher,
[34:06] right?
[34:08] It opens up the word, the door to every
[34:10] interpretation,
[34:14] even mine. Don't listen to me.
[34:18] Listen to the word.
[34:20] Go back and take it back into the word
[34:23] and see if it's there.
[34:25] But men that are filled with the Holy
[34:28] Ghost, that got the same experience of
[34:32] the new birth that the prophet had,
[34:35] Amen, will come and the Holy Ghost, the
[34:38] voice of God in her will break these
[34:41] things down.
[34:44] That's the voice of God we need. Do we
[34:47] listen to the tapes? I listen to them
[34:48] all the time. I was listening to them in
[34:49] the parking lot before I came in here. I
[34:53] get blessed from him. But I also know in
[34:56] my spirit what the prophet was talking
[34:58] about that God's truth continues to
[35:01] march on. Amen.
[35:05] This has never been about William Brham
[35:08] the man.
[35:11] Hallelujah. He grew and grew and grew.
[35:15] He said it with his own lips. If I
[35:18] didn't have an angel come and tell me
[35:22] I was preaching certain things back
[35:24] there, he went through the same process
[35:28] that we are going through right now.
[35:31] Amen.
[35:35] People
[35:38] you know
[35:41] Jesus Christ
[35:46] miss
[35:48] understood Jesus Christ mis
[35:52] looked over overlooked sorry
[35:56] in that day here was God in flesh
[36:01] God in flesh
[36:03] it wasn't a prophet it was God in flesh
[36:06] overlooked
[36:09] here was the prophet in this last day
[36:12] come
[36:14] you have to be blind to to look into his
[36:18] ministry and see that that he was
[36:22] vindicated from God 100%. Just like he
[36:25] was with Moses. All these things you
[36:27] have to be blind
[36:29] overlooked.
[36:31] It's always been that way.
[36:34] And and man likes to take credit. Man
[36:38] likes to point them to them the people
[36:41] to themselves. Amen. Man likes to be
[36:45] glorified.
[36:47] But brother Brandham said a true
[36:48] minister of God, amen, will become
[36:52] nothing in the presence of God so that
[36:54] he can become everything
[36:57] &gt;&gt; and that we can point the people to him,
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the word. And what does
[37:04] that mean? Oh, because I got some great
[37:08] revelation. No, you're still pointing it
[37:10] back to yourself. You're pointing back
[37:12] to the life, bringing you into the life
[37:16] of Jesus Christ.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; That's why a real minister won't preach
[37:22] things that tickle your ears. But the
[37:25] word of God will convict your heart
[37:28] because the word is sharper than a
[37:30] two-edged sword. It'll go deep down.
[37:34] Judgment begins here in the house of
[37:37] God. If you're lacking, if you're lazy,
[37:40] if you're slacking, or if there's things
[37:41] in your life, Amen. God will speak to
[37:44] those things and it'll pierce your soul.
[37:48] It'll discern your heart. Amen.
[37:53] A lot of times God discerns your heart
[37:55] and speaks to your heart. Speak it
[37:58] speaks to your life, speaks to your
[38:01] condition, speaks to your ways, speaks
[38:03] to your attitudes, speaks to the way
[38:05] your thoughts are, speaks to your
[38:07] culture, speaks to your habits, your
[38:10] routines. God speaks to them and says,
[38:12] "They're in my way." Hallelujah. I want
[38:16] them out of the way. You got to hear my
[38:19] voice. I'm speaking to you to get those
[38:22] things out of the my way so I can do a
[38:24] work that I've already ordained in your
[38:26] life to do. Amen. God will always come
[38:31] warning before judgment. He'll come and
[38:33] speak to you over and over and over
[38:35] again. But if you don't listen to his
[38:38] voice, hallelujah,
[38:41] then God allows things to come upon our
[38:43] lives.
[38:45] He knows how to speak to us.
[38:48] One of the ways, Brother Brandham said,
[38:50] he'll get you in a hospital room looking
[38:51] up. Looking up. Amen. Why?
[38:58] We need the voice of God in this age
[38:59] more than any other age. More. Oh, my
[39:02] brothers, voices.
[39:05] Millions and millions and millions of
[39:08] voices out there.
[39:10] Distractions.
[39:13] Oh, hallelujah.
[39:15] Let us move on here.
[39:19] meet the hour, meet the need of the
[39:21] hour, the time that we're living in. And
[39:24] after he had promised it, we can rest
[39:26] assure that he will keep his promise.
[39:29] That's the confidence that a believer
[39:30] has in his maker. That he promised to
[39:33] meet the need. And today, one of the
[39:36] reasons that the church is in the
[39:38] condition that is in is because there's
[39:41] so many voices.
[39:45] Oh my.
[39:48] So many other voices to attract the
[39:51] church. Listen
[39:54] from the voice of God.
[39:59] What an hour of deception.
[40:04] If it would be if it was possible, think
[40:07] about it. It's so close. If it would be
[40:11] possible, the elect would be deceived.
[40:14] So many other voices.
[40:19] Oh, God.
[40:21] You know, there's so many voices in the
[40:23] in the camp.
[40:26] There's a voice here tonight. There's a
[40:29] voice there. There's a voice there. But
[40:31] you see, there's nothing wrong when this
[40:34] voice speaks the written word of God.
[40:37] But there's something wrong when if this
[40:40] voice amen distracts you or misleads you
[40:44] from the voice of God. They're still
[40:46] small voice.
[40:49] Hallelujah. And only the elected ones
[40:52] are able to catch the mind of God in
[40:56] this hour to lead the people to the
[41:00] still small voice, the voice of God.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:07] I know when I when I hear a true man of
[41:09] God speak the word of God, I leave
[41:11] outside those doors. Amen. With that
[41:14] still small voice, I I leave the service
[41:17] knowing that God spoke to my heart
[41:21] and nobody else knows what he spoke but
[41:24] me and him.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He gives me instructions. He
[41:29] rebukes me. He puts me back in line.
[41:33] Hallelujah. He knows how to speak to
[41:37] your heart.
[41:39] He knows your heart. He knows you better
[41:41] than yourself. He knows your character.
[41:44] He knows where you are right now tonight
[41:46] in your walk with him. He knows your
[41:49] sensitivity. He knows your emotions.
[41:52] Amen. He knows your physical health. He
[41:55] knows everything about us tonight.
[41:58] And he speaks to meet the need in your
[42:02] heart.
[42:04] No man can do that. Not to the bride of
[42:07] Jesus Christ.
[42:09] She doesn't look for a man. She comes
[42:12] and sits down under the ministry. But
[42:15] she comes and sits down because she's
[42:17] waiting for him to come. Hallelujah.
[42:21] Amen.
[42:23] Hallelujah. So many other voices to
[42:25] attract the church from the voice of
[42:27] God. Think about it. Think about it.
[42:31] till it's very doubtful that many would
[42:34] hear the voice of God though it was
[42:37] spoken right in their midst.
[42:40] Oh, let me tell you my brothers and
[42:41] sisters,
[42:43] you know, they heard the Pharisees and
[42:45] Sadducees in the days of Jesus. They
[42:48] heard the teachings of Moses. They heard
[42:50] it so precise, so educated, so uh
[42:54] intellectual. Amen. They heard it so
[42:58] perfect.
[43:00] Those Pharisees and Sadducees, you can
[43:02] put a pin right through and they know
[43:03] exactly the word, the written word,
[43:06] where it went. They preached that word,
[43:09] they preached that law flawlessly.
[43:13] Let me tell you, my brothers and
[43:14] sisters, that same spirit, spirits don't
[43:17] die. Men die, but spirits don't die.
[43:21] Hallelujah. That same spirit is
[43:23] preaching this message flawlessly,
[43:27] making preachers, I'm going to say it
[43:29] for myself, like me, look like a fool.
[43:34] Amen. But they preach it so flawlessly,
[43:41] so right
[43:45] that when when God
[43:48] will take like brother Brandon says, a
[43:50] humble little man without any education
[43:53] but filled with the Holy Ghost and power
[43:56] &gt;&gt; go into a a a a a
[43:59] camp meeting
[44:01] that are used to big big names and big
[44:03] preachers and preaching like you never
[44:06] heard before in life and take that
[44:08] little man that can't even speak
[44:09] English.
[44:12] What do you think? What do you think
[44:17] they What do you think they're going to
[44:18] recognize the voice of God? No, no, no,
[44:21] no, no. That's not you know that that
[44:24] just so many thoughts going through my
[44:26] mind. But when I hear, you know, oh that
[44:29] was you should have heard the word
[44:31] coming from that brother. You should
[44:32] have heard this message. You should have
[44:34] heard that. Well, it's for you, not for
[44:36] me. Like I said the last time, keep your
[44:39] mouth shut.
[44:42] It just shows your immaturity. It just
[44:44] shows that you need more faith in your
[44:47] walk. This ain't about this man and how
[44:50] he preaches the word about that that
[44:52] man, how he preaches the word. Is that
[44:55] what this is about? Is that what this
[44:58] conviction and this walk is about in
[45:01] your heart?
[45:03] Or is it about Jesus Christ?
[45:06] Is it about oh, I came in contact with
[45:09] him. It doesn't matter where I go. I
[45:12] want I don't want to see the
[45:13] manifestation of man. I want to see the
[45:15] manifestation of the word of God. I want
[45:18] to see him in the camp manifesting and
[45:21] moving up and down.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; And when that happens, I don't say
[45:25] nothing. Hallelujah. I just rejoice
[45:29] that my eyes have been open, that I've
[45:32] been given to understand the mystery of
[45:35] his coming
[45:37] is here.
[45:40] Hallelujah.
[45:43] Amen. I know I always put too much notes
[45:45] here. I I just when I'm studying, I put
[45:48] too much notes and I never learn. I get
[45:52] up here, you guys start pulling, and I
[45:55] start going in all different directions.
[45:59] They perhaps wouldn't understand it
[46:01] because it would be so foreign to them.
[46:04] They haven't got themselves
[46:07] so much centered. They got themselves so
[46:10] much centered on the voices of the day.
[46:15] And if we notice in our scripture
[46:18] reading that the voice of God was
[46:21] foreign to them.
[46:24] Hallelujah.
[46:26] And it be and it becomes that way again
[46:30] today.
[46:31] It will come that way again today
[46:37] where we think
[46:40] we're coming into
[46:42] services
[46:44] that we're hearing the voice of God and
[46:48] the the majority of the people
[46:52] and the voice of God will be foreign.
[46:56] Listen, what's the scripture say? Hey,
[46:58] you say, "Brother Tim,
[47:01] okay Jesus said,
[47:04] right in this age, did he not in the
[47:07] Bible, did he not say that I was on the
[47:10] outside
[47:11] knocking trying to get in?"
[47:15] Oh, but you you you say in your mind,
[47:18] "Not the message, Brother Tim. That's
[47:21] denominations,
[47:22] not the message." Well, if your mind is
[47:25] there, then you're in a past age.
[47:28] you haven't moved on with the word of
[47:29] God for for today
[47:32] because the word always fulfills and
[47:35] repeats itself like history always
[47:37] repeats itself. In order for the word of
[47:39] God, it came to pass in Christ, all
[47:43] fulfillment. It came to pass in brother
[47:46] Brandham's ministry and his life, all
[47:48] fulfillment. And now the bride is here
[47:50] today. What do you think? She's going to
[47:52] walk on a bed of ease. What do you
[47:54] think? She's going to go through
[47:56] nothing. She's just going to sit in
[47:58] messes churches and and praise the Lord.
[48:01] That was a good message. Wow, that's a
[48:03] good preacher. That's mighty. No. No.
[48:06] The message has to come to a place where
[48:09] the scriptures must be fulfilled again.
[48:13] that there must be Pharisees, Sadducees,
[48:16] there must be unbelievers, make
[48:18] believers, all these things in our midst
[48:21] today,
[48:22] false prophets,
[48:24] false preachers, false anointed ones.
[48:28] You ever listen to that message lately?
[48:30] False anointed ones. My God, it'll open
[48:34] up your eyes and your senses.
[48:36] Amen.
[48:38] Hallelujah.
[48:41] Can that happen?
[48:44] It's happening.
[48:46] Not can it happen. It's happening.
[48:49] Hallelujah.
[48:51] And it becomes that way again today. And
[48:54] then if God promised he would give us
[48:56] that and if other voices are contrary to
[48:59] the voice of God, then it must be the
[49:02] voice of the enemy to confuse us. that
[49:05] we wouldn't understand
[49:08] the voice of God when it's spoken.
[49:11] Brother Brand was speaking here in the
[49:12] voice of God in the last days.
[49:15] Going to continue to read on.
[49:18] There are so many voices in the earth
[49:20] today that is absolutely hard a hard
[49:24] thing because it deadens the voice of
[49:27] the supernatural.
[49:30] You see what it does? He's laying it out
[49:33] here.
[49:34] And you can see it manifesting. It
[49:37] deadens the voice of the supernatural.
[49:43] You catching it?
[49:47] There are so many intellectual voices,
[49:51] great voices of mighty men
[49:55] who are intellectual
[49:57] that in their intellectual condition
[50:00] even shake the nations,
[50:04] even shake people in the message, shake
[50:07] churches,
[50:10] shake your senses, shake your emotions,
[50:14] shake your feelings.
[50:16] His
[50:20] bride will not be deceived.
[50:23] She will not be deceived because he is
[50:26] here to expose everything.
[50:33] They're just not overnight people.
[50:36] Preachers
[50:38] been preaching for 30, 40 years,
[50:42] but they shake nations, bring in great
[50:45] organizations
[50:46] together, great campaigns together, flow
[50:49] in. And a person would be a bit
[50:53] confused. It's enough to confuse them of
[50:57] how that these things go on and prosper.
[51:03] They go on and they prosper.
[51:07] They get bigger. They get bigger. You
[51:10] know, Brother Brandham talked about the
[51:11] Pentecostal churches getting bigger and
[51:14] bigger and bigger. And you know what he
[51:17] said if you if you study the message,
[51:19] you know what he said about it.
[51:21] Hallelujah.
[51:23] Amen. Getting bigger and bigger.
[51:27] When this starts happening, they get
[51:29] bigger and bigger. And you say, "Well,
[51:31] brother Tim, we want, you know, you know
[51:33] what I and Pastor Danny is the same way.
[51:36] God adds to this church,
[51:39] such as should be saved under this
[51:42] ministry.
[51:44] We're not here to add nobody
[51:48] because you know what happens?" And I
[51:51] I've been a deacon for 30 years. And
[51:54] when people come and add family and add
[51:57] people to this church,
[52:00] that's why I got no hair. And then if my
[52:03] hair does grow in, it's all gray.
[52:06] That's what it does. But when God adds
[52:09] to the church, hallelujah, then there's
[52:13] fellowship. There's Holy Ghost
[52:15] fellowship. There's communion. Amen.
[52:18] There's an understanding between each
[52:20] other. and we grow in our faith together
[52:24] and we pray in the Holy Ghost. We move
[52:27] in the Holy Ghost. Amen. And we see God
[52:30] confirming his word in our midst. That's
[52:33] when God
[52:35] adds to the church.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; I was praying for my mom one time. I was
[52:42] praying and praying, you know, at the
[52:43] early stages trying to get everybody in.
[52:46] And I was praying and praying and the
[52:48] more I prayed for them and the more I
[52:50] witnessed to them the truth, I mean I I
[52:53] was I would walk away and go, "My God, a
[52:56] dummy could understand that and see
[52:57] that. It's so clear." But the more I
[53:00] would do that, the more they would push
[53:03] away and push away and push away and
[53:05] push away. So I just started praying. I
[53:07] praying and praying for for her, weeping
[53:10] and crying and weeping and crying and
[53:12] weeping and crying. And all of a sudden,
[53:13] the Holy Ghost came down. It's like I
[53:16] preached on uh the prayer meeting last
[53:17] week. Holy Ghost came down and said,
[53:20] "Leave it alone. It's done." And when he
[53:23] came down, when he speaks, his voice
[53:24] speaks, it just stops everything.
[53:30] You understand? It stops everything.
[53:33] Everything is over. It's done. Like when
[53:36] Jesus said, "It's finished." That was
[53:38] part of my testimony, too.
[53:41] when I was praying to be delivered,
[53:44] he said, "It's finished. It's done.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; It's over."
[53:51] And then from that day,
[53:53] I prayed for God to bless my mom and all
[53:55] that stuff, but zero worry, zero trying
[53:59] to persuasion. I'm not going to call her
[54:01] to this if she's not meant to become to
[54:03] this. Amen. Hallelujah.
[54:08] Amen.
[54:10] Hallelujah. The voice of God. How will
[54:14] we know it's the voice of God for today?
[54:17] Now listen.
[54:19] Then it was
[54:21] an vindicated prophet. We know we have a
[54:25] vindicated prophet. Amen. So there's one
[54:28] sign that we know is the voice of God
[54:31] today. Hallelujah. By a vindicated
[54:34] prophet.
[54:36] Now, today,
[54:38] how will we know it's the voice of God?
[54:41] Because it's the manifestation
[54:44] of the prophet's word.
[54:47] Amen. Do you got that?
[54:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; How do we know it's God's voice today?
[54:54] It's the manifestation
[54:56] of the prophet's word, the prophet's
[54:59] prophecy coming to pass.
[55:03] Oh, God.
[55:05] Hallelujah.
[55:07] It's not all these things that are
[55:09] taking place that we're talking about in
[55:11] the message.
[55:13] It's not about dissecting the word and
[55:16] making the word so understandable for
[55:19] you to understand.
[55:21] Hallelujah. It's not about that, my
[55:24] brothers and sisters.
[55:26] That's not the voice of God today. It's
[55:30] the manifestation when we see the
[55:32] manifestation of the prophet's
[55:34] prophecies being fulfilled in our midst.
[55:38] That's what we want. That's what we want
[55:40] in our lives. To see a manifestation of
[55:44] the word coming to pass. What he has
[55:47] spoken, what he has said, I can identify
[55:51] that is coming to pass in my life. I see
[55:54] the Holy Ghost working in my life,
[55:57] bringing it to pass. Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; So, I know I'm hearing the voice of God.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; I know it sounds simple and sometimes it
[56:08] goes
[56:10] because we're we're we're so trained.
[56:16] We're so trained
[56:19] that we have interpret the voice of God
[56:23] because the message has trained people
[56:29] in a certain direction and it'll get so
[56:34] deceiving
[56:36] that only the bride of Jesus Christ
[56:39] will be able to hear his voice
[56:43] in the midst of millions.
[56:49] Hallelujah. This is God's prophet. And a
[56:52] true voice of God only brings back the
[56:55] real living supernatural God.
[56:59] Hallelujah.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; With a supernatural word.
[57:05] Hallelujah.
[57:07] Yeah. Amen. Are we listening? I know
[57:10] it's Wednesday night, but I'm up here.
[57:13] is later, you know, and I'm up here
[57:16] preaching and you're you're down there
[57:18] sitting down. I know. Hallelujah. We got
[57:20] to fight this flesh.
[57:23] Amen.
[57:24] But there's there's truth being spoken
[57:27] here that I can't reveal to you, but he
[57:30] has to reveal to you. Hallelujah. And
[57:33] the true voice of God only brings back
[57:36] the real living supernatural God.
[57:40] That's what the true voice brings back.
[57:43] Hallelujah.
[57:45] With his supernatural word, with the
[57:48] supernatural manifestation of the true
[57:50] word of God, then we know the prophet is
[57:55] saying, then we know that it's the voice
[57:58] of God. Then we can be certain in our
[58:01] lives in the ministry when we see that
[58:04] manifestation of the supernatural God in
[58:07] our midst that it's the voice of God
[58:09] being spoken.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:14] Amen.
[58:17] The word of God which is inseparable
[58:21] from God's voice.
[58:23] This description as the living and
[58:26] activated piercing to the deepest parts
[58:29] of one's being
[58:32] convicted,
[58:34] speaking to the heart.
[58:38] The voice of many waters
[58:42] brings forth the supreme authority of
[58:45] him.
[58:48] Voice of many waters. How are you going
[58:50] to do it when it's recorded in glory?
[58:54] When the voice tonight is recorded,
[58:58] when your voice is recorded? I'm not
[59:02] speaking, Brother Tim. Just listen.
[59:06] Your thoughts are recorded. As a man
[59:10] thinkketh in his heart, so is he. Notice
[59:12] your thoughts are louder in heaven than
[59:15] your voice on earth. Certainly it is.
[59:18] God knows your thoughts and the intents
[59:20] of your heart. He knows all about it.
[59:24] You know
[59:26] what gave me a lot of victory in my life
[59:30] is when I came into the consciousness or
[59:33] the reality that God knows every thought
[59:35] that I think.
[59:38] Oh, you walk around your day and you
[59:41] think all kinds of thoughts. You walk
[59:44] around all kinds of situations and you
[59:47] think all kinds of thoughts and you
[59:50] think your thoughts are not being heard.
[59:53] You think your thoughts are not
[59:55] affecting your life,
[59:58] your spirit, your mind, your attitude,
[1:00:02] everything.
[1:00:04] When you come conscious and you get the
[1:00:07] Holy Ghost in your life and you come
[1:00:09] conscious that he is here, you see
[1:00:13] that's what it is. In that day, you will
[1:00:16] know that I'm in the father. I do
[1:00:19] nothing unless the father shows me. It's
[1:00:22] not I that speak, but it's the father
[1:00:24] that speaks to me.
[1:00:27] You'll know in that day that I'm in the
[1:00:28] father. The father is in me. We can
[1:00:31] understand and see that. But then you're
[1:00:33] going to understand, you're going to
[1:00:35] come conscious that I am in you and you
[1:00:38] are in me. Hallelujah.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; That changes everything
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; when you come conscious of that. I
[1:00:47] wonder what people are conscious of
[1:00:48] today. Some of the things that are
[1:00:50] manifest in other people's lives, some
[1:00:52] of the situations, some of the
[1:00:54] behaviors, some of the things that they
[1:00:56] speak. Hallelujah. I wonder what they're
[1:00:59] conscious of.
[1:01:02] You know, we we don't we don't sit here
[1:01:04] and we don't sit here and I'm just going
[1:01:07] as the spirit leads me now. We don't sit
[1:01:09] here and preach about TV.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah. We don't come here and sit
[1:01:14] and preach about sports and all this
[1:01:16] entertainment and all these things.
[1:01:18] Amen.
[1:01:21] But it doesn't change the fact that they
[1:01:23] are voices that they are distractions.
[1:01:27] Not not to the unbeliever,
[1:01:30] not to the makebeliever. I'm not
[1:01:31] speaking to you. You love your
[1:01:33] entertainment. You love your games. You
[1:01:36] love your TV. You love your programs.
[1:01:40] But to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:43] It's all distractions, right?
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; You know, there is no vindication,
[1:01:49] right? And I'm not telling you not to
[1:01:50] have a TV in your house, okay? Okay, I'm
[1:01:53] not preaching legalism here, but there's
[1:01:55] no vindication in the message of the
[1:01:58] hour or approval cuz we always like to
[1:02:01] go back to brother Brandham for approval
[1:02:04] in our lives, right? Well, there's no
[1:02:06] approval for a TV.
[1:02:10] But there's a commandment that he said
[1:02:11] that I'd rather what you want to do. And
[1:02:14] you know what that is? Take your shotgun
[1:02:16] and blow it up.
[1:02:23] Isn't what's evil to us?
[1:02:27] Shouldn't we cut it off? What distracts
[1:02:30] us? Oh, you think you're going to get
[1:02:33] this Holy Ghost? You think you're going
[1:02:36] to come into this life lukewarm, lazy,
[1:02:39] distracted by all these voices? You
[1:02:42] think God is going to come to you and
[1:02:45] fill you and manifest in your life when
[1:02:48] you got so many other gods and voices
[1:02:52] and distractions in your life. There's
[1:02:55] no surrender. There's no yielding. Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; He's not number one. He's not even
[1:03:03] number two in some of your lives.
[1:03:06] Maybe number three or number four.
[1:03:09] Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; How do I know what I'm speaking about?
[1:03:13] Cuz I've gone through it.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; God has convicted my heart.
[1:03:18] Amen. I had to repent many times.
[1:03:22] And I was just telling my wife, I said,
[1:03:24] "Listen, let's let's examine." The Bible
[1:03:28] says, "Examine yourself." I said to her,
[1:03:31] "Let's examine ourselves. Let's examine
[1:03:35] our why, our our lies." Do we examine
[1:03:38] ourselves every once in a while?
[1:03:43] What is our routine?
[1:03:46] Oh, we come home from work, we do this,
[1:03:48] we do that, we shower for the next day,
[1:03:51] we come down and we sit on our our our
[1:03:54] our couches in front of our TV. Oh, we
[1:03:58] watch good programs. Just letting you
[1:04:00] know that.
[1:04:02] and we watch certain programs
[1:04:05] and then we go to bed. We say a little
[1:04:07] prayer in our bed and we take those
[1:04:09] thoughts that we injected from those
[1:04:12] programs to bed with us to that sacred
[1:04:15] place of rest that God gives us where
[1:04:18] the bed should not be un it should not
[1:04:21] be defiled by anything. That's not only
[1:04:23] sexually. That's everything. That bed is
[1:04:26] a bed of rest where God reserves that
[1:04:29] place when you lie your head to rest.
[1:04:32] He'll give you perfect sleep
[1:04:34] and speak to you and make love to you.
[1:04:41] Oh my,
[1:04:43] that revelation struck me. The first
[1:04:46] thing I did, I didn't rejoice in all
[1:04:47] that. I got on my knees and was crying
[1:04:49] and weeping and repenting when the word
[1:04:51] of God spoke to me and corrected my
[1:04:52] heart. And then I bring it to my wife as
[1:04:55] the head of the house. I bring it to my
[1:04:56] wife with as much grace as I can give.
[1:04:59] And by grace, she sees it. Why? Because
[1:05:03] that first love, you lost that first
[1:05:06] love. Hallelujah. You know, there's a
[1:05:08] song out there. You lost that lovely
[1:05:10] feeling. You lost that first love.
[1:05:13] You lost that first love for God.
[1:05:16] Hallelujah.
[1:05:17] Amen. Him put put aside put aside in our
[1:05:23] homes, in our lives.
[1:05:25] Oh my
[1:05:27] Lord Jesus. He says, "Take me, my
[1:05:29] brothers and sisters, may God voice
[1:05:32] speak to somebody." Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. What a horrible thing
[1:05:40] it is horrible.
[1:05:42] The word of life by a prophet of the
[1:05:45] living God. The Holy Ghost, the chance,
[1:05:48] the mercy seat is here now for each and
[1:05:52] every individual to hear the word of God
[1:05:55] and obey the word of God. for a drifting
[1:05:58] soul on the sea of life.
[1:06:01] No pilot to guide them. Listen, I'm
[1:06:03] talking to people in the message right
[1:06:06] here
[1:06:08] manifesting this in their lives.
[1:06:10] No pilot to guide them loose. Everything
[1:06:14] in their life is loose from their
[1:06:16] thinking, their talking, everything,
[1:06:19] their behavior
[1:06:21] floating with the tides of this earth,
[1:06:24] tides of this life. to hear the roar of
[1:06:27] the great cataracts, the falls, the word
[1:06:30] of God being spoken. The word of God is
[1:06:33] judgment, my brothers and sisters, to
[1:06:36] those who reject it. Reject the life. I
[1:06:39] believe it, brother Tim. I believe God
[1:06:41] said, "Prophet, no. Reject the token.
[1:06:44] Reject the life, the harder way." Oh,
[1:06:47] people rejecting that harder way when
[1:06:49] God speaks. Amen.
[1:06:52] What a horrible thing it would be for a
[1:06:54] soul drifting. Voice of many waters.
[1:06:56] What is his voice? It's a judgment. The
[1:06:59] voice of the ministers through the Holy
[1:07:01] Spirit crying out to the people and
[1:07:03] every age standing there. The voice of
[1:07:05] many waters crying out thickness and
[1:07:08] multitudes of people. The voice of those
[1:07:11] seven stars in his hand to every church
[1:07:14] age preaching the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:16] Ghost. The baptism in Jesus name.
[1:07:19] speaking in tongues, the power of God,
[1:07:20] the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the
[1:07:22] second coming, the divine judgment, the
[1:07:25] voice of many waters came forth. This
[1:07:28] one that looked like the son of man,
[1:07:31] Patmas vision.
[1:07:34] Oh my,
[1:07:36] I only got 25 minutes left
[1:07:39] and uh I just got through the little
[1:07:42] introduction here of just his quotes.
[1:07:45] So, we'll just we'll just take it. Like
[1:07:46] I said, there's going to be a part two.
[1:07:48] Let's see if we can get some things done
[1:07:49] here. Private interpretation or God's
[1:07:52] interpretation. Man's private
[1:07:54] interpretation comes with a lot of his
[1:07:56] own understanding and it comes with
[1:07:59] substitutes.
[1:08:01] Man leans on his own ways and how he
[1:08:04] sees things spiritually.
[1:08:07] Man is unconsciously
[1:08:10] always trying to figure out God
[1:08:14] and in doing so gets farther away from
[1:08:17] him. The Bible said did not say figure
[1:08:21] out God. The Bible said seek God.
[1:08:25] There's a big difference there. When
[1:08:28] you're trying to figure out God, you
[1:08:31] bring your own
[1:08:34] understanding, your own intellect into
[1:08:37] the equation.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that makes you farther
[1:08:41] away from God. Hallelujah. Faith comes
[1:08:44] by hearing the written word. And when
[1:08:47] you are born,
[1:08:49] the spirit of truth reveals to you the
[1:08:52] unwritten word.
[1:08:54] Hallelujah. People are just caught up
[1:08:59] still on the written word.
[1:09:02] While the Pharisees were,
[1:09:05] brother Brandon say the denominations
[1:09:07] were.
[1:09:09] Even great inspired preaching was all on
[1:09:12] the written word.
[1:09:16] But brother Brandon's ministry come
[1:09:17] along, a real prophet of God, and his
[1:09:21] preaching was foreign to them.
[1:09:24] We can see that
[1:09:26] because he was preaching the unwritten
[1:09:28] word.
[1:09:30] They didn't understand the Pharisees and
[1:09:32] Sadducees. We don't we know your teacher
[1:09:34] sent from God, but we don't understand
[1:09:36] these things.
[1:09:38] When he said, "You must be born again to
[1:09:40] Nicodemus." He says, "I can't understand
[1:09:42] that." We look at that in the Bible for
[1:09:45] that day. But listen, my brothers and
[1:09:47] sisters, it's the same thing today. It
[1:09:50] might be a different written word that
[1:09:53] people don't understand and they're
[1:09:54] trying to interpret, but it's the same
[1:09:56] process. It's the same manifestation
[1:09:59] that's taking place today in an unborn
[1:10:02] again believer of this message.
[1:10:06] Hallelujah.
[1:10:08] See, it reveals the truth to you of the
[1:10:12] unwritten word. That is the token life
[1:10:15] that it lives automatically out of your
[1:10:19] mind, soul, and body.
[1:10:22] Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] The works are gone.
[1:10:28] Man is gone.
[1:10:30] You are dead. As Paul says, I die daily.
[1:10:33] There's no more left of you. But now the
[1:10:36] token life. Amen. His life. As Paul
[1:10:39] said, it's not I that live, but it's
[1:10:42] Christ that live within me. He was
[1:10:44] talking about the token. Now it's him
[1:10:47] living.
[1:10:49] Come into a place of maturity and
[1:10:52] understanding and recognizing, amen,
[1:10:54] that there is a Christ
[1:10:57] living inside of you.
[1:11:03] And it destroys
[1:11:05] as the process takes place, as the
[1:11:08] replacement takes place, it destroys
[1:11:12] your understanding.
[1:11:14] It destroys your interpretation.
[1:11:17] We all have it, my brothers and sisters.
[1:11:20] You come in a message, you listen to the
[1:11:22] seals, you listen to the churches, you
[1:11:24] listen to all kinds of messages, and you
[1:11:26] bring it in. You bring it in and you
[1:11:27] think you got it. You don't got it.
[1:11:30] You don't got it. You understand it
[1:11:32] according to your understanding.
[1:11:35] That's the truth, my brothers and
[1:11:36] sisters. Amen. But when he comes and
[1:11:40] quickens that, what happens? It brings
[1:11:43] forth life.
[1:11:45] He brings forth life. He can only bring
[1:11:48] forth life. His life when he quickens
[1:11:50] that. Now, now am I saying it's bad? No.
[1:11:53] It's good. It's good to to listen. It's
[1:11:57] good to read. It's good to do all these
[1:11:58] things, but that's not it. And that's
[1:12:00] where the devil deceives the people
[1:12:02] thinking you got it and you don't got
[1:12:03] it. Think you see it but you don't see
[1:12:06] it. And that is dangerous. That's not a
[1:12:09] preacher up here being negative. Amen.
[1:12:12] And trying to push you down. But that is
[1:12:15] dangerous because it stops. That's a
[1:12:17] Satan's trick to stop the process uh
[1:12:21] amen. Of the maturity of the word, the
[1:12:24] seed to grow inside of you to come to
[1:12:26] life and awaken.
[1:12:29] Oh, he tries to muddle things up so many
[1:12:31] different ways. If we had a thousand
[1:12:33] tongues, we wouldn't even describe. He's
[1:12:35] a master of deception, Satan. He's a
[1:12:38] master of taking the word like he did
[1:12:40] with Eve,
[1:12:42] and taking it and twisting it so you
[1:12:44] don't get the real substance of the word
[1:12:47] of God, the real life. Amen.
[1:12:51] Hallelujah.
[1:12:53] Amen.
[1:12:56] God needs man.
[1:12:58] The prophet said it and the word of God
[1:13:01] says God doesn't need man.
[1:13:04] It's true. A lot of things that are said
[1:13:08] that looked like they're contrary to
[1:13:09] each other.
[1:13:12] So what is the answer to this? It's the
[1:13:15] new birth. That's the answer. It's
[1:13:18] always been the answer.
[1:13:21] Nothing starts
[1:13:23] in your life, in your walk. Nothing
[1:13:26] starts without the new birth. That is
[1:13:29] the starting point.
[1:13:32] That's why brother Brandon says if you
[1:13:34] know if you don't know that you're born
[1:13:36] again, then you need to start there.
[1:13:40] Don't worry about my your ministry.
[1:13:42] Don't worry about your gifts. Don't
[1:13:44] worry about all your works. Get to that
[1:13:47] place that you know that you know that
[1:13:50] you're born again and that the spirit of
[1:13:53] God is confirmed in your life.
[1:13:59] Listen me, let me tell you. If there's a
[1:14:00] seed of God inside of you, I know my
[1:14:02] experience and other born again
[1:14:04] believers experience. Listen, that's the
[1:14:06] only thing when the Holy Spirit touches
[1:14:08] that seed that you go after, that you
[1:14:11] seek after. Hallelujah.
[1:14:14] Amen.
[1:14:16] Hallelujah
[1:14:18] is a new birth. That is what God needs
[1:14:21] from a man to be born again so he can
[1:14:24] interpret his word to her through her.
[1:14:29] Amen.
[1:14:30] That's the only reason why he needs man.
[1:14:34] The problem is men and women are not
[1:14:36] being born again today.
[1:14:39] Oh my. That's a sermon in itself.
[1:14:43] not being born again today. Brother
[1:14:46] Brandham talked about, you know, not
[1:14:48] being led to Christ. All these churches
[1:14:51] not leading people to the real true Holy
[1:14:54] Ghost experience with Christ. Oh my,
[1:14:58] have we gotten to such a place in the
[1:15:00] message today? So intellectual
[1:15:04] preaching the word so fine.
[1:15:09] Oh my, it just tickles your ears. It
[1:15:11] tickles your your emotions, your spirit.
[1:15:14] Hallelujah. Check it. Tick. It just gets
[1:15:16] to your senses and fantasizes your
[1:15:19] senses. The word is preached in such a
[1:15:21] way that you walk out of here
[1:15:25] and realize after a while nothing.
[1:15:30] Brother Graham says Billy Graham goes
[1:15:32] into the the city and he preaches the
[1:15:34] and 30,000 people come to the altar and
[1:15:37] next and the year after he come he comes
[1:15:38] back he can't even find 30.
[1:15:42] Listen we look at these things and we
[1:15:45] think it's just for the denominations
[1:15:47] and out there not in the message. That's
[1:15:49] what I'm trying to get to you and the
[1:15:51] ministers are trying to get to. It's
[1:15:52] here.
[1:15:55] The deception is here. The manifestation
[1:15:58] of Satan and his deception is here and a
[1:16:03] word has got to be preached. Amen. To
[1:16:06] expose it so that God can show you, not
[1:16:09] man. God can show you the way
[1:16:12] individually how you must walk.
[1:16:17] Didn't he say that in the word? I'll
[1:16:19] show you the way and the way that you
[1:16:20] must go. Hallelujah.
[1:16:23] Amen.
[1:16:25] Amen.
[1:16:27] Amen. Got a few more minutes here. And
[1:16:31] they're not accepting God's way of
[1:16:34] receiving it the harder way. And that's
[1:16:36] where there are so many individual
[1:16:39] private interpretations in the message.
[1:16:41] Only those who have received the new
[1:16:43] birth from the father. As Jesus said,
[1:16:46] flesh and blood has not revealed it to
[1:16:47] you. Without that, all you got is flesh
[1:16:51] and blood interpretation. Man's own
[1:16:54] understanding.
[1:16:56] Satan knows the word, brother. All I do
[1:17:00] is feed off the word. The written word.
[1:17:04] It's a written word.
[1:17:06] Satan knows it better than you.
[1:17:09] I I'm not going to come to Satan and and
[1:17:12] and say, you know, I claim I stand here
[1:17:17] tonight
[1:17:18] that I know the written word.
[1:17:23] You'll make me look like a fool.
[1:17:25] He'll make me look like a fool with the
[1:17:28] written word. But when the unwritten
[1:17:31] word,
[1:17:33] the born again experience,
[1:17:35] that's a different story. Hallelujah.
[1:17:39] Amen. God comes now. God steps forward
[1:17:45] on the scene and he speaks.
[1:17:48] And he's the same God that said, "Let
[1:17:50] there be light." Amen. And there was.
[1:17:53] Let there be this. And there was that
[1:17:55] same created spoken word power of God is
[1:17:58] now in the bride. And when he comes
[1:18:02] forward and he speaks
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; one revelation,
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:18:08] One David stone to Goliath's head. So I
[1:18:12] don't stand here claiming the written
[1:18:14] word, knowing all the message, all the
[1:18:16] quotes, and all all the mysteries. But I
[1:18:19] know him
[1:18:22] by his grace. I know him. And if I know
[1:18:25] him, when I need to know something,
[1:18:28] he'll speak it to me. When I need to
[1:18:31] know.
[1:18:32] Hallelujah. Some of you need to know
[1:18:35] everything all the time. Some of you
[1:18:37] boggle your mind up so much cuz you need
[1:18:41] to know. You need to know. Listen, get
[1:18:43] to a place. You don't need to know
[1:18:46] anything until he comes and gives you
[1:18:49] what you need to know.
[1:18:52] Hallelujah.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] We have the first birth which God gave
[1:19:00] us the ability to read the written word.
[1:19:03] The first birth, the natural birth,
[1:19:06] writing and the brain to understand a
[1:19:09] lot of things in our reasoning called
[1:19:12] education. The second birth called the
[1:19:16] new birth. He gives us one thing,
[1:19:20] the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:23] The first birth gives us so many other
[1:19:25] things. The second birth gives us one
[1:19:29] thing, the Holy Ghost. But the Holy
[1:19:32] Ghost, oh my,
[1:19:35] gives us the ability to understand all
[1:19:38] things.
[1:19:40] But both can be used to look at the
[1:19:44] word, the written word. Think about it.
[1:19:47] and the message both of them and
[1:19:50] interpret it. But there are two
[1:19:52] different results at the end of it.
[1:19:56] The two seeds, the two vines,
[1:20:03] reading,
[1:20:05] studying, listening to the same word,
[1:20:09] but there's always two different
[1:20:11] results.
[1:20:15] Hallelujah.
[1:20:18] Amen.
[1:20:20] One produces a self-righteous legalistic
[1:20:24] interpretation
[1:20:27] and a carnal impersonation
[1:20:30] that produces dead nonseed life.
[1:20:36] Inside, as Jesus said, you are dead man
[1:20:39] bones. On the outside, you're righteous
[1:20:43] and you're dead works doing everything
[1:20:45] by works and not by faith. That's the
[1:20:49] first birth and what it produces in a
[1:20:52] religious spirit.
[1:20:54] And that is prominent.
[1:20:57] Prominent dominant
[1:21:01] today and majority today in the message.
[1:21:05] Might not like me. That's fine. I'll
[1:21:07] still love you.
[1:21:09] I'm going to tell you what I believe is
[1:21:11] the truth. What God reveals to me. Amen.
[1:21:15] Hallelujah.
[1:21:17] The second birth, you become a new
[1:21:20] creature, a new creation in Christ. All
[1:21:23] things have passed away. All things
[1:21:25] become new. Now you lean not to your own
[1:21:28] understanding, but the spirit of truth
[1:21:31] guides you and leads you and reveals the
[1:21:33] word to you. Hallelujah.
[1:21:35] You know what? I can go on and on and
[1:21:37] on, but I'm feeling just uh invite the
[1:21:41] musicians up. I'm going to bring some of
[1:21:44] this stuff later on. Amen.
[1:21:50] And invite the musicians up. Hallelujah.
[1:21:58] I just feel it's time to just say a few
[1:22:00] things here and then close her off.
[1:22:03] Hallelujah.
[1:22:05] you just continue to pray for me. I been
[1:22:08] getting heavy attacks up here. I don't
[1:22:10] show it. Dizzy spells, all kinds of
[1:22:12] stuff happening, but God is grace is
[1:22:15] sufficient to bring his word. Amen.
[1:22:18] Hallelujah. Let me just close off with
[1:22:21] this in in in uh preparing for our next
[1:22:24] service here. Brother Brandon speaking
[1:22:26] here in Lee. You'll see in church age.
[1:22:28] The spirit and the bride say come. The
[1:22:32] corner wheat, the bide wheat that fell
[1:22:37] into the ground at Nika has come back to
[1:22:41] its original word grain again. Praise
[1:22:44] God forever. Yes. Listen to this
[1:22:49] authentic prophet of God who appears in
[1:22:52] the last age. what he says from God, the
[1:22:57] bride will say
[1:23:00] the same revelation
[1:23:03] that God gave him,
[1:23:05] God is going to give to the bride and
[1:23:07] they're going to be saying the same
[1:23:09] thing.
[1:23:11] The spirit and the prophet and the bride
[1:23:13] will say the same thing and what they
[1:23:17] will say will have already been said in
[1:23:19] the word. They are saying it now.
[1:23:24] Come out from amongst her now and be ye
[1:23:28] separated.
[1:23:31] Is that what the spirit of God is saying
[1:23:34] in the message to the bride?
[1:23:40] The cry has gone out. The cry has been
[1:23:44] going out.
[1:23:47] How long will you listen
[1:23:49] and not heed to the cry?
[1:23:53] to the voice of God.
[1:23:57] The cry is going out. How long will the
[1:24:01] voice cry? We do not know. But one thing
[1:24:05] we do know, it won't be long. For this
[1:24:09] is the last age.
[1:24:11] Yes, sir. The church,
[1:24:15] and I've said this before, the message
[1:24:19] is no longer the mouthpiece of God.
[1:24:22] It's his own mouthpiece. That's what
[1:24:25] it's developed into.
[1:24:28] Pray and ask God to show you and open up
[1:24:30] your eyes.
[1:24:34] It's its own mouthpiece. So God is
[1:24:37] turning on her. He will confront her
[1:24:41] through the prophet and the bride now.
[1:24:45] Oh yes. Right here. For the voice of God
[1:24:48] will be in her.
[1:24:51] Oh, God still has a voice for the people
[1:24:54] of the world even as he has given a
[1:24:58] voice to the bride.
[1:25:01] That voice is in the bride.
[1:25:04] And as we have said, he's he's talking
[1:25:07] here, but I'm saying this too. As we
[1:25:09] have said, we will talk more about this
[1:25:12] later. And we will we will talk about
[1:25:16] this more later.
[1:25:18] Hallelujah.
[1:25:23] I didn't know it was going to go in this
[1:25:24] direction, my brothers and sisters,
[1:25:27] but the spirit of God knows. And I thank
[1:25:30] God because it gives me confidence up
[1:25:33] here to know that I didn't come with my
[1:25:37] own thoughts. I didn't come with my
[1:25:39] intellectual.
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:41] My education is only so high anyways.
[1:25:46] But I don't lean on that. I don't
[1:25:48] confirm myself by all these things,
[1:25:52] but I know that the Holy Spirit put me
[1:25:56] aside
[1:25:59] and spoke tonight.
[1:26:02] And in my heart is burning that somebody
[1:26:06] received something from him.
[1:26:10] Not from the 80% that I gave you,
[1:26:14] the written word that I, but God spoke
[1:26:17] to your heart.
[1:26:19] Maybe he's turning somebody around.
[1:26:22] Maybe it's that vision that Brother
[1:26:23] Brandham's seen, the bride getting out
[1:26:25] of line and the voice is speaking, "Stay
[1:26:29] in line.
[1:26:31] The hour's late, the hour's dark, the
[1:26:34] deception is rising more and more. Stay
[1:26:38] with me.
[1:26:40] Separate from the voices. Separate from
[1:26:43] the distractions.
[1:26:45] Come back to me.
[1:26:47] Come back to my love. Come back to my
[1:26:50] grace.
[1:26:52] I'm waiting for you to take you back in
[1:26:56] and love you.
[1:26:59] Get away from all this own
[1:27:02] interpretations.
[1:27:04] Get away
[1:27:06] from trying to interpret things in your
[1:27:08] life. I'll interpret it.
[1:27:12] God says, "I'm my own interpreter. I
[1:27:14] will make it plain to you." Wait upon
[1:27:17] the Lord and he shall renew your
[1:27:20] strength.
[1:27:21] He shall renew your walk. He shall
[1:27:24] refill you with the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:27:27] what we want. a church moving in the
[1:27:30] supernatural,
[1:27:31] seeing the supernatural God, seeing the
[1:27:34] supernatural word manifest in our midst.
[1:27:38] That's what attracted me. I didn't want
[1:27:39] religion.
[1:27:42] When I came to this, what attracted me
[1:27:44] was I seen the supernatural word of God
[1:27:47] moving in our midst, manifesting all
[1:27:49] around my life,
[1:27:52] speaking.
[1:27:55] You talk about a whirlwind of God all
[1:27:57] around you. And it's not all these
[1:28:00] different voices. It was one voice all
[1:28:02] around me speaking. I love you. I called
[1:28:05] you. I predestinated you. You're mine.
[1:28:09] Oh God, you're mine. I love you. Fear
[1:28:14] not. I am with you. In you to the end.
[1:28:18] Fear not. The greatest thing. Fear. The
[1:28:23] greatest tool. Satan. Fear.
[1:28:26] Fear not.
[1:28:30] Listen, it's going to be preached by
[1:28:32] real ministers of God in such a way that
[1:28:36] if you don't know who you are, listen to
[1:28:38] me. If you don't know who you are,
[1:28:43] you're not going to see anything. You're
[1:28:45] going to be confused.
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:28:48] But if you know who you are, you can sit
[1:28:52] under that anointing and say, "Thank
[1:28:54] you, Lord."
[1:28:56] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:59] Let us stand and let us pray.
[1:29:03] Father, we thank you, Lord,
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:08] for what you do in our lives.
[1:29:12] I pray for each and every one and
[1:29:15] myself.
[1:29:17] I pray for the sick. I pray for the
[1:29:20] needy. I pray for the emotional needs,
[1:29:23] the spiritual needs, the physical needs.
[1:29:26] I pray for our pastor in a position, his
[1:29:30] precious wife. I pray the Holy Ghost
[1:29:34] will continue
[1:29:36] to move in his life in a supernatural
[1:29:39] way. I've seen it right from the
[1:29:41] beginning in our fellowships, in our
[1:29:43] growing together. It's nothing but
[1:29:45] supernatural. And Lord, we don't want
[1:29:47] nothing else but that. We don't want a
[1:29:49] compromise with the flesh in this world
[1:29:52] and the things of this world. No, it's
[1:29:54] too late in the hour. We want the
[1:29:56] supernatural movement manifestation of
[1:29:59] the word of God in our lives. And that's
[1:30:01] it.
[1:30:03] Lord, we want you more than anything.
[1:30:05] Lord, separate us, oh God. We can't do
[1:30:09] it on our own. Let the Holy Ghost, the
[1:30:12] power of God, raise a standard within
[1:30:16] us. Oh God, make your word more real.
[1:30:19] Father, we ask and all we can do is ask
[1:30:22] for more faith.
[1:30:24] Raise a standard.
[1:30:27] Give us strength, Lord. Here we are at
[1:30:30] the end, the most deceiving age. Father,
[1:30:33] you left us here,
[1:30:35] but not without a witness, Lord. Not
[1:30:38] without you coming, oh God, because it's
[1:30:42] impossible for us to make it out of here
[1:30:45] without you being here, Father. They're
[1:30:47] looking for his coming out there. Even
[1:30:50] people in the message are looking for
[1:30:51] his coming. But you have come. You are
[1:30:55] here.
[1:30:57] You are here.
[1:31:00] That's thus sayeth the Lord. I'm in my
[1:31:02] bride.
[1:31:04] Hallelujah. Thank you, Father. Bless
[1:31:08] each and every one, Lord. Into your
[1:31:11] hands.
[1:31:13] Not my hands, not any ministry's hands,
[1:31:16] but into your hands. I commit each and
[1:31:20] every one, Father, in the word of God
[1:31:21] tonight, Lord.
[1:31:24] Jesus name we ask.
[1:31:32] And I

[1:33:02] trip and and uh thank God that he has
[1:33:06] come and is interpreted himself through
[1:33:09] his people. Just say praise the Lord.

[1:34:58] Jesus.
[1:35:09] Well, the more that I surrender,
[1:35:14] the lighter

[1:35:18] The more that I release my cares, the
[1:35:23] more he takes control.
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:27] More that I can humble myself, the more
[1:35:32] he lifts me
[1:35:34] every day.
