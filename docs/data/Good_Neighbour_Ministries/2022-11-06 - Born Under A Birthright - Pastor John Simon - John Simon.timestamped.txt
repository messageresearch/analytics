[41:03] and our topic today will be one you know
[41:09] born under a Birthright
[41:13] born under a Birthright
[41:17] and we like to read our brief scripture
[41:21] here today
[41:22] as it is written
[41:25] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[41:32] that's her scripture I'll read it once
[41:34] more
[41:36] Jacob as it is written Jacob have I
[41:40] loved but Esau have I hated praise the
[41:46] Lord
[41:47] a gracious Heavenly Father we thank you

[42:37] watching listening May the Holy Spirit
[42:40] minister to all our hearts wherever we
[42:44] are in the name of Jesus Christ to the
[42:47] glory of God Amen God bless you please
[42:51] be seated
[42:52] thank you
[42:59] Hallelujah
[43:03] in the message called
[43:05] hearing
[43:06] recognizing and acting on the word I
[43:11] believe it's paragraph into one brother
[43:13] Branham speaks and he says out of the
[43:18] same holy Realm
[43:21] Yonder that came salvation
[43:27] out of that realm comes also curses
[43:33] out of the same mother and father
[43:37] that projected Jacob
[43:42] also projected an Esau
[43:47] see it's all God
[43:50] he cannot change
[43:52] he cannot change his plans
[43:56] they have to go on just the same
[43:59] and all Nature has to cope with it see
[44:05] you get what I mean it moves right on
[44:09] what he's saying is it doesn't stop with
[44:11] Jacob
[44:12] that moves on and because God's plan
[44:16] cannot change it has to go on all time
[44:20] until it Blends back into eternity
[44:23] because God is an unchanging God and he
[44:27] is perfect with the first decision so it
[44:30] doesn't have to change it just continues
[44:33] on the atmosphere the times the seasons
[44:36] the Fashions all that may change around
[44:40] it but it Remains the Same
[44:45] now you get what I mean that moves right
[44:49] on
[44:50] you uh there has to be somebody lost
[44:56] for somebody else to be saved
[45:00] see
[45:01] now if there wouldn't he wasn't a savior
[45:06] you see he had to be a made a savior
[45:10] so that we could have a savior and that
[45:14] deep calls to the Deep
[45:17] amen praise God in other words your need
[45:21] created the supply and the supply is
[45:25] there to meet the need so the Deep calls
[45:28] to the deep it just goes back and forth
[45:31] like between a husband and wife
[45:32] sometimes they don't have to talk but
[45:34] there's an invisible something that goes
[45:37] between them
[45:39] you can't see it
[45:41] but you can't tell them it's not real
[45:44] they can't see God they can't see the
[45:46] moving or the spirit but you can't tell
[45:49] us it's not real because it's real
[45:52] within our hearts
[45:54] and it's real so solid as as a as a
[45:58] tangible something because we know that
[46:02] it's really there amen praise the Lord
[46:05] now if we go to our text we'll just read
[46:08] simply what it says here
[46:10] Jacob have I love
[46:14] now you must realize that before the
[46:19] world was even formed before anything
[46:23] was done before Jacob was born as the
[46:28] scripture itself says
[46:30] God loved him before he was even born
[46:36] and in there we see the doctrine of
[46:39] predestination uh now
[46:43] God loved you if you are an elected seed
[46:47] part of the elect lady that we call the
[46:50] Bride of Jesus Christ
[46:52] then you will find you were loved by God
[46:56] before the world was even born
[47:00] now of course before to say that is to
[47:04] already tell you you are an eternal
[47:07] being
[47:09] because you couldn't be loved by God and
[47:12] just be temporal
[47:14] if you were loved by God you not were
[47:17] but you are
[47:19] eternal
[47:21] you were just like he says you are and
[47:25] you will ever be there will no be no
[47:28] time when you will not be there if you
[47:31] are an eternal being according to the
[47:34] word of the Living God now Jacob have I
[47:37] loved
[47:38] think of it Jacob a crook
[47:43] a trickster
[47:45] a liar a cheat a
[47:49] mama's boy
[47:51] a manipulator uh you know a planner a
[47:56] schemer uh that's what he wants but God
[47:59] says I love him
[48:03] I love her
[48:05] that is him saying doesn't matter what
[48:09] the world says anything about you
[48:11] doesn't matter what they think about you
[48:14] I The Great I Am I love you
[48:19] praise God that's what we should be
[48:22] concerned about not the opinions of
[48:26] churches not your opinions of the world
[48:29] not the opinions of any preacher doesn't
[48:33] matter who it is we have respects for
[48:36] that but we must keep our eyes on the
[48:39] word of the Living God Jacob have I
[48:42] loved
[48:43] that one that the world hits I love
[48:48] thank God for that brother I might not
[48:51] have been here you may not have been
[48:53] here but thank God he loved me
[48:57] why should he love us so we don't know
[49:00] we can't explain it we have no rational
[49:03] ideas of how that could be what good is
[49:07] there in us but Jacob have I loved
[49:12] it blows the human mind to think that
[49:16] one like a David
[49:18] that was a a womanizer a killer uh a
[49:23] warrior a bloody hands and everything
[49:26] else and God turns around and says I
[49:30] love him
[49:32] praise God that's the way our God is
[49:36] this outward mind that we have here will
[49:40] do all things because it comes from
[49:42] Satan great worked on God designed that
[49:45] and then he turns around and what you do
[49:49] with this he wants to accuse the man on
[49:52] the inside that's the seed that God has
[49:55] placed there and God is revealing to us
[49:57] no he's a liar yes you can't deny these
[50:02] things were done in your flesh but the
[50:05] man that is in you the seed of God don't
[50:08] not commit sin it can't
[50:12] because that is of god therefore you are
[50:16] Justified
[50:17] just as if you're never did it in the
[50:21] first place oh praise God I'm happy that
[50:24] we are not just forgiven but we are
[50:27] Justified
[50:29] praise the Lord glory to God see similar
[50:33] if now look if you did do the thing if
[50:36] this man inside did do the thing and you
[50:39] were uh forgiven the Forgiveness or the
[50:44] pardon tells that you you actually did
[50:47] it so I got to forgive you for it but
[50:51] brother Branham is telling us that when
[50:54] you move past this flesh that can be
[50:57] forgiven but this man on the inside
[50:58] being Eternal and never did nothing in
[51:00] the first place he is Justified
[51:04] he's never done anything that person
[51:07] that God placed in you hasn't done a
[51:10] thing and you are just as if you have
[51:12] never done it in the first place
[51:16] and you ought to take God's word rather
[51:18] than your own thoughts or your own mind
[51:21] God is greater than your heart
[51:25] amen I'm so thankful to God for Jacob
[51:30] because in Jacob I see myself on every
[51:33] other believer
[51:35] that God loved us before we were in our
[51:40] mother's womb praise God hallelujah now
[51:44] when I use the topic burn under a
[51:48] Birthright I'm really saying that you
[51:52] were born in this natural world
[51:55] with the right
[51:57] to have
[52:00] the true birth
[52:03] by the Holy Spirit or the New Birth you
[52:07] come with that right in you and that
[52:10] right was given by the fact that God
[52:14] placed in you his seed Gene
[52:18] let me go to brother Branham
[52:22] I do not believe in the Mormon doctrine
[52:26] of the pre-existence of Souls
[52:30] I do not believe in reincarnation
[52:35] I do not believe in transmigration of
[52:39] Souls
[52:40] but you see I have to be careful here
[52:44] and you be careful and see this
[52:47] for it is not the person
[52:50] yes like I was just saying that comes
[52:54] predestinated
[52:56] eternally from God
[53:00] it is the word
[53:03] or the seed of God in them that comes
[53:08] predestinated to you
[53:10] eternally from God
[53:13] and that all happened way back there
[53:18] too far back for your human mind to
[53:21] grasp the
[53:24] Eternal God had in him
[53:27] Eternal thoughts
[53:30] okay
[53:32] Eternal sons and daughters
[53:35] because my thoughts are my children I I
[53:39] give birth to thoughts you give birth to
[53:42] thoughts and God's thoughts were his
[53:45] children
[53:47] amen and him being Eternal you are
[53:50] eternal
[53:50] ah we say it lightly it sounds just like
[53:54] uh you know it sounds like that but when
[53:56] that reality strikes your heart through
[53:58] the revelation of the word of God you
[54:01] realize that you are not of this world
[54:04] you're not of this realm you're from
[54:06] another realm all together you're from
[54:08] that you're not from this Earth with all
[54:11] its systems you're from the Commonwealth
[54:13] of Grace as Paul has said we are aliens
[54:16] down here they're they're looking
[54:18] everywhere for the aliens and we are
[54:20] already here amen we are the eternal
[54:23] life ones it is
[54:26] right here praise God you see and
[54:29] they're looking everywhere but we are
[54:32] already here
[54:33] and when the time comes we are going
[54:36] back where we come from for the glory of
[54:39] God
[54:40] amen you see
[54:44] Eternal thoughts
[54:46] thoughts that are decreed
[54:49] that's why he said Jacob have I loved in
[54:53] other words all the Jacobs all them
[54:56] characters like that that they can't see
[54:58] what's behind there or they can't see
[55:01] what's hidden back of that mask I love
[55:05] Jacob because I see something deep in
[55:08] him they can't see and that's something
[55:10] in him I love
[55:13] praise God hallelujah
[55:16] before either was born
[55:20] and either had done any good
[55:24] or any evil
[55:26] God said Jacob I love
[55:30] and Esau I hated isn't it wonderful to
[55:34] know we serve a god like that that knows
[55:36] our beginning
[55:38] to our natural ending amen because we
[55:42] are going back to him when this comes to
[55:45] an end see it was a thought then
[55:49] and that thought
[55:51] become expressed in other words that
[55:54] thought was allowed to come to the Earth
[55:56] amen manifested and expressed as a human
[56:00] being
[56:01] and we just like the Earth as he said is
[56:04] a manifestation of God's thought you and
[56:08] I come as manifestations of God's
[56:12] thoughts amen so God's thoughts come
[56:15] material and then that thought of course
[56:18] become expressed
[56:20] and God you see brought back Jacob now
[56:25] he just made a short statement but what
[56:27] is brought back means that there comes a
[56:29] time when that thought will wander
[56:32] and some of these thoughts wandered away
[56:35] we call it in the world
[56:37] wandered away from the original path and
[56:41] plan that God had and it doesn't matter
[56:44] what he's saying is it doesn't matter
[56:46] where or how long that thought wanders
[56:50] away from God hallelujah Jacob you see
[56:55] then God brought back Jacob Hallelujah
[57:00] I'm glad I serve a God that can bring me
[57:03] back right in line with his word
[57:06] doesn't matter where I wonder how you
[57:09] wonder he'll bring us back to the center
[57:12] of his word
[57:14] hallelujah amen praise God forevermore
[57:18] now now God brought Jacob back and he
[57:23] brought him back because Jacob alone was
[57:27] seen
[57:29] remember let me repeat Jacob alone was
[57:34] seed
[57:35] amen
[57:37] that is why
[57:39] he had respect to that book right praise
[57:44] God he respected the birthright
[57:47] Hallelujah no matter with all of his
[57:49] wanderings around all his partying all
[57:52] his this is lying back inside there
[57:55] something kept speaking to him and
[57:57] telling him giving him he still had a
[57:59] respect for God he still had a love for
[58:02] God's word he still had this thirst and
[58:05] his hunger for the Waters of life and
[58:07] the bread of life he still had this
[58:10] within his heart and always want to have
[58:13] it within his soul praise God
[58:15] forevermore so he had respect for the
[58:19] birthright respect for it and he
[58:22] believed God also for the Covenant that
[58:26] comes with that work right the Covenant
[58:28] that get comes from Abraham that God
[58:32] loves you without conditions
[58:35] God doesn't love you because you work
[58:38] hard in the church God doesn't love you
[58:41] because you fasted he doesn't love you
[58:44] more because you prayed more than the
[58:46] other person God doesn't love you more
[58:49] because you know more of this Bible than
[58:52] anybody else and that you can close your
[58:55] eyes like the rabbis and tell you about
[58:58] all the 66 books 29 here in the new and
[59:02] so many in the old and and go through
[59:05] all those things no that's wonderful but
[59:07] God doesn't love you more because you
[59:09] have that no sir he loves you just
[59:13] because he loves you amen doesn't matter
[59:16] the reason you are in his heart
[59:18] amen praise God hallelujah see you if
[59:24] you are the true seed then you see you
[59:28] will have respects for this word for
[59:30] this book right the right that you had
[59:33] to come to a birth now I will be
[59:35] proceeding on this as I go along praise
[59:38] the Lord for you see if you are a true
[59:41] seed you will hear the word
[59:45] that doesn't mean with your ears only
[59:47] but something in here is going to hear
[59:50] the word
[59:52] oh my you know you can have 20 men 30
[59:57] men speaking singing or whatever but if
[1:00:00] you're really spiritual the spirit of
[1:00:03] God will be Elder
[1:00:05] tell you when you are hearing a sound
[1:00:07] that comes from heaven
[1:00:09] you are going to hear a certain sound
[1:00:12] that's only it only comes from the
[1:00:16] presence of God uh like uh one Minister
[1:00:19] I know when I just heard of the message
[1:00:22] we just heard of it and we're just
[1:00:24] playing one of those big reel to real
[1:00:27] tips on the Willing tip recorder and
[1:00:30] this man was a hospital administrator he
[1:00:32] was going home from work walking by and
[1:00:35] we had it so loud we heard Bang Bang
[1:00:38] Bang Bang on the door we said who's who
[1:00:40] could that be
[1:00:42] praying pain we rushed we open the door
[1:00:44] he says oh my God he says I don't know
[1:00:48] who it is there that's speaking but that
[1:00:50] voice is coming straight from the throne
[1:00:53] of grace Hallelujah Straight from Heaven
[1:00:55] and I'm going to believe it no matter
[1:00:58] what amen he recognized that was the
[1:01:01] voice of God nobody had witnessed to him
[1:01:04] nobody had told him but there is a ring
[1:01:07] there is a something that comes out amen
[1:01:10] and it's the voice behind the voice
[1:01:12] because it's the Holy Spirit trying to
[1:01:15] speak through a human vessel Hallelujah
[1:01:18] that's all we have to do and if you're
[1:01:20] an election there is no Works to to be
[1:01:23] able to know that or find that or hear
[1:01:25] that because God gives it to you
[1:01:28] [Applause]
[1:01:29] amen as I've said before you know that
[1:01:32] there's a special whistle that you can
[1:01:34] whistle and dogs alone can hear it
[1:01:37] human beings can't
[1:01:39] but that doesn't mean that there is not
[1:01:42] a real sound coming from back there amen
[1:01:45] but we are hearing a joyful sound
[1:01:47] we are hearing a a sound from heaven and
[1:01:52] they may not be able to hear it and want
[1:01:54] to know why why you got so attracted
[1:01:57] what's happening to you why why you love
[1:01:59] that there is something going on and if
[1:02:02] you don't recognize it God wants you to
[1:02:04] recognize it and the Holy Spirit will
[1:02:07] speak to you open up his word so that
[1:02:10] you will know who he is that he is a
[1:02:13] living God then bury him in a grave and
[1:02:16] he stayed there but that
[1:02:18] Immortal Almighty spirit that we call
[1:02:22] Jehovah has risen from the dead in the
[1:02:25] form of Jesus Christ and he is back on
[1:02:28] the Earth again once more Hallelujah the
[1:02:30] same yesterday today and forever praise
[1:02:34] the Lord I believe it he lives
[1:02:36] forevermore
[1:02:38] praise the Lord then if you hear the
[1:02:42] word the spirit will baptize you into
[1:02:45] the body of Christ Hallelujah filling
[1:02:48] you and empowering you and you will
[1:02:51] receive the word for your day
[1:02:56] amen hallelujah and for your age he puts
[1:03:01] that in at the end Hallelujah now see
[1:03:04] how clear the true evidence
[1:03:07] of the Holy Spirit comes
[1:03:12] when the word of God is revealed to you
[1:03:16] amen the ability to receive revelation
[1:03:21] Hallelujah born with the right to that
[1:03:26] Birthright praise the Lord amen now you
[1:03:31] see Jesus was a royal seed and he lived
[1:03:35] in a human body and when a spirit called
[1:03:38] to him while he was a word manifested
[1:03:42] thought it made him go to Jordan
[1:03:45] Hallelujah and then he abide The
[1:03:49] Obedience to the word the spirit said
[1:03:52] this is my beloved Son in whom
[1:03:56] I am pleased to dwell in
[1:04:00] amen that was Jesus back there this is
[1:04:05] the bride form
[1:04:07] of the son of man revealed
[1:04:10] it is a many membered body he was one
[1:04:14] because he was just a head of the body
[1:04:17] but now the body form of the brightest
[1:04:22] hair in many members and that same word
[1:04:26] that was said of Jesus is said of the
[1:04:31] Bride for the wife is a part of him
[1:04:36] it's not separate from him it's a part
[1:04:39] of him and what is said of the
[1:04:42] bridegroom is set of the Bride
[1:04:45] amen and hear this the son of man is
[1:04:49] being revealed in the last day and he
[1:04:52] says now this is my beloved Son in whom
[1:04:57] I am pleased to dwell in praise God
[1:05:01] God's place to dwell in you Hallelujah
[1:05:04] God's pleased to walk and talk in you
[1:05:07] and let the people bump shoulders with
[1:05:10] eternal life and don't even know it like
[1:05:14] they're dead when Jesus was here
[1:05:16] literally upon the Earth but he doesn't
[1:05:18] have to come back here physically again
[1:05:22] because physically he has the bright
[1:05:24] form here and he can walk around in the
[1:05:27] bright form and they can bump shoulders
[1:05:29] with eternal life amen hallelujah you
[1:05:32] see now the Holy Ghost was positioning
[1:05:36] him as the son now he is positioning us
[1:05:41] as a son or a daughter praise God
[1:05:44] Hallelujah for he was filled the same
[1:05:49] pattern
[1:05:50] holds a Pentecost
[1:05:53] and ever after that
[1:05:56] is that now
[1:05:58] at Pentecost and ever after that the
[1:06:01] same pattern it's not me telling you
[1:06:04] that I know I said it to you before I
[1:06:06] quoted this but he is saying this out of
[1:06:09] the Sumerian Church age and he's saying
[1:06:12] it that pattern Falls at Pentecost and
[1:06:16] ever after that Hallelujah and then he
[1:06:20] went out in demonstrated power
[1:06:24] receiving even Jesus at the time because
[1:06:28] he was in a man state
[1:06:30] had to receive the full revelation of
[1:06:33] God from God
[1:06:36] for that day how he was to live what he
[1:06:39] was to do how he had to go to the cross
[1:06:41] and die and all that was revealed to him
[1:06:44] praise God because he was born a man I'm
[1:06:47] not going to preach on that because you
[1:06:48] know over in Philippians he says that he
[1:06:51] learned obedience but because he
[1:06:54] actually came as a man God in a man so
[1:06:58] imagining God having to surrender submit
[1:07:00] humble himself to his own creation and
[1:07:03] learning from his mother and and Joseph
[1:07:06] obedience yeah and so on just take that
[1:07:09] thought and carry it out there and see
[1:07:11] how we should walk and conduct ourselves
[1:07:14] under that Spirit of Christ that comes
[1:07:16] into our hearts and lies praise the Lord
[1:07:19] amen I want to continue taking this
[1:07:22] thought little further here is that okay

[1:07:48] and that made her have the right to have
[1:07:51] a right birth praise God hallelujah amen

[1:07:58] have the right birth because we're born

[1:08:56] are not our own but we are bought with a
[1:08:59] price amen that's why love when the

[1:14:55] think it's last Wednesday I preached my
[1:14:57] brother Brandon was talking about all of
[1:14:59] those gifts
[1:15:00] the gift of eternal life is the gift and
[1:15:04] he says he protected that gift in those
[1:15:07] individual elect seed he protected it
[1:15:11] amen until to the time when the seed
[1:15:14] wakes up to who it really is and why it
[1:15:17] is here amen you are protected I know of
[1:15:21] incidents when I was a boy when I should
[1:15:23] have died
[1:15:24] I should have drowned you know uh
[1:15:27] jumping off trees into a river with
[1:15:30] rocks and under who knows I could have
[1:15:32] just plunged in and split my skull and I
[1:15:36] could have died many of you sitting here
[1:15:38] car accidents
[1:15:41] just simple things we could have gone
[1:15:44] Prophet said I ought to have died I
[1:15:48] ought not to even have even been born
[1:15:52] but you see God had it and planted that
[1:15:55] way that you ought to be here because
[1:15:57] you have to manifest his thoughts you
[1:16:00] have to manifest his word you have to
[1:16:03] let the people see what love is by
[1:16:06] somebody living love and acting It Out
[1:16:08] by Temperance patience godliness all
[1:16:11] these things have to be personified
[1:16:13] personalized manifested and that's God's
[1:16:17] thoughts expressing itself through you
[1:16:19] and I in Simplicity Hallelujah blessed
[1:16:23] be the name of the Lord hallelujah see I
[1:16:27] should have died but behold I live

[1:16:32] Christ forevermore why not only that we
[1:16:36] live we don't live just naturally but we
[1:16:39] got eternal life
[1:16:41] we are going to heaven
[1:16:44] why
[1:16:46] because of what we've done it's because
[1:16:48] of what he done for us
[1:16:51] he was the one that took our place
[1:16:53] praise God hallelujah let's give the
[1:16:55] Lord a hand
[1:16:57] he was the one that took her place
[1:17:02] we were just not need crossed I in every
[1:17:06] kind of condition messed up amen but he
[1:17:10] took my place praise God spiritual
[1:17:14] speaking we were all twisted up messed
[1:17:17] up but he took our place
[1:17:19] he met and now by that he makes me and
[1:17:25] you perfect sons and perfect Daughters
[1:17:30] of the Living God hallelujah amen you're
[1:17:33] perfect
[1:17:34] did you hear what I just said you're
[1:17:36] perfect
[1:17:37] you're perfect oh but brother Simon I
[1:17:41] know I make mistakes I know I think this
[1:17:43] I knew I knew that this has happened and
[1:17:45] this has happened but God is saying
[1:17:47] regardless of your flesh your human
[1:17:50] thoughts doing all these things if you
[1:17:52] keep your being centered on him praise
[1:17:56] God Anchored In Jesus you will every
[1:17:59] storm ever wave you'll be able to make
[1:18:01] it true why because my friends he is the
[1:18:05] one that says you are a perfect son and
[1:18:08] a perfect daughter
[1:18:10] why because Perfection dwells within yes
[1:18:14] yes it's not you trying to keep these
[1:18:17] Seven Virtues
[1:18:19] the Seven Virtues are in Christ
[1:18:21] and Christ is in me
[1:18:24] and he is the Perfection of all
[1:18:26] Perfections and I'm living by him what
[1:18:29] you're seeing is the outside man and me
[1:18:31] that may make a flaw here do this or
[1:18:34] this say this wrong emotionally wrong in
[1:18:37] this area that area but my brother's
[1:18:39] sister if you can look beyond that you
[1:18:43] will see Jesus amen amen oh my his
[1:18:48] sacrifice did all that not mine I had
[1:18:53] nothing to do with it you have nothing
[1:18:55] to do with it amen can you say that
[1:18:59] salvation is of the Lord
[1:19:04] is that right salvation is of the Lord
[1:19:08] it's not how many candles you burn
[1:19:10] it's not how many stations of the cross
[1:19:13] you kneel and crawl on your knees it's
[1:19:16] not how many flagellations at Easter
[1:19:19] that you take the whips and whip your
[1:19:22] back is going to get you saved but
[1:19:25] Salvation is of the Lord
[1:19:28] is that right it comes from God and God
[1:19:31] alone has to do with it our act our
[1:19:34] actions and activities now our response
[1:19:37] or reactions to his action in gratitude
[1:19:40] to what he has done for us we show him
[1:19:43] our love that is within our heart amen
[1:19:47] so I do not trust in what I done but I
[1:19:52] am trusting in what he done amen I'm
[1:19:55] trusting on what he was and what he is
[1:19:58] praise the Lord that's what we're
[1:20:01] trusting in thanks be to God hallelujah
[1:20:04] amen thank God that we come here born
[1:20:07] under a Birthright
[1:20:10] now think of I want to take your
[1:20:12] thoughts too quickly to Abel born on the
[1:20:15] he was the first one that was born under
[1:20:17] that word right now remember the story
[1:20:20] of Cain and Abel and the sacrifices one
[1:20:23] of fruit and flowers
[1:20:25] one of uh the fruit of your lips and the
[1:20:29] works of your hands right uh he comes
[1:20:32] forth with that and Abel comes with a
[1:20:35] bloody bleeding dying lamb killed by a
[1:20:40] rock that he used as a knife to to there
[1:20:43] was no sharp knives in those days so it
[1:20:45] had to be a pointed Rocky found
[1:20:47] somewhere and ripped the throat of that
[1:20:49] animal and the Bloods praying everywhere
[1:20:52] the blood spraying upon Him amen becomes
[1:20:56] speckled with the blood amen of that
[1:20:58] Lamb Of course a type of shadow of the
[1:21:00] things that were to come but there he
[1:21:02] was doing it but you see one day the
[1:21:05] Holy Spirit spoke into my heart and said
[1:21:07] uh you know just quietly
[1:21:10] how did their Bell know
[1:21:12] that he had to offer a lamb
[1:21:16] you saying that now
[1:21:18] but there was no books written
[1:21:23] there was nothing written anywhere how
[1:21:26] could he know for certain
[1:21:29] uh why didn't he go and get a horse
[1:21:32] why didn't he go get a goat why didn't
[1:21:35] he go get something else but he knew by
[1:21:40] faith Paul tells us by Revelation Paul
[1:21:44] tells us he knew what to offer to God
[1:21:48] and God testified back that he was right
[1:21:52] amen he had the testimony that he
[1:21:55] pleased God hallelujah so this is why by
[1:21:59] Revelation by faith evil knew that he
[1:22:03] had to put his faith on that lamb
[1:22:06] sacrifice Hallelujah and that is what
[1:22:09] this message of the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:22:12] 5 has brought us back to
[1:22:16] it does not deny or move off from the
[1:22:19] written word
[1:22:21] but the written word itself came out of
[1:22:25] the unwritten word
[1:22:28] this is just a record of meaning
[1:22:31] and of thoughts if I have thoughts
[1:22:34] they're invisible you don't know them
[1:22:35] you do then if I take a pen I write it
[1:22:39] down
[1:22:40] but then after a while so many centuries
[1:22:42] you take in that is the original
[1:22:45] Jesus himself the person is the word and
[1:22:49] he is the one who's saying believe me
[1:22:50] the word Abel saw that from the
[1:22:54] beginning
[1:22:55] and he believed the word without the
[1:22:59] written word he believed the logos
[1:23:01] without the Rima amen the Rhema is the
[1:23:05] part of this word you can see but the
[1:23:07] unwritten word the law goes lives within
[1:23:11] this Rhema so while I'm maybe speaking
[1:23:15] the Rhema the logos is expressing itself
[1:23:17] making himself manifest the Living God
[1:23:20] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:23:22] hallelujah amen so we find out that he
[1:23:26] was born under that word right so God
[1:23:30] had to come and reveal to him what it
[1:23:33] was that he needed to have hallelujah
[1:23:36] praise God and I'm glad that we could be
[1:23:39] here in our day not to have a church but
[1:23:42] is that right
[1:23:44] but to have the original spoken word
[1:23:48] birth out of the word of God hallelujah
[1:23:51] amen that's what Jesus demonstrated it
[1:23:53] that we should have come by the spoken
[1:23:56] word that's why the angel just like
[1:23:58] brother Branham stood before this bride
[1:24:00] of this last day and said You shall bear
[1:24:02] a son his name Shall be Called Jesus
[1:24:05] amen but now this is the bright part
[1:24:08] there is going to be a bride Hallelujah
[1:24:10] and she will be Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:24:13] Hallelujah because the word is revealed
[1:24:16] to her in her and through her the
[1:24:18] manifestation of God's word made
[1:24:20] manifested glory be to God hallelujah
[1:24:24] amen hallelujah oh praise God I want you
[1:24:28] to see my friends
[1:24:30] Abraham also was under that word right
[1:24:35] he wasn't better than anybody who's
[1:24:37] cursing swearing Idol worshiping and
[1:24:39] making offerings all kind of false pagan
[1:24:42] gods and everything else but all of a
[1:24:45] sudden
[1:24:46] no written bible
[1:24:48] amen I I I I looked Dr crudence and a
[1:24:52] few others but I'm just talking here I
[1:24:55] don't have to go quoting here there
[1:24:56] there this one said there's a praise God
[1:24:59] but the fact is that this Covenant amen
[1:25:04] that was given uh by God unconditional
[1:25:09] God didn't call him because he was good
[1:25:12] God didn't call him because he was
[1:25:14] better God didn't call me because he was
[1:25:17] taller he shorter he's black he's white
[1:25:19] his brownies yellow God wasn't concerned
[1:25:21] with stuff like that God knows whom he
[1:25:25] loves and who he hates
[1:25:27] and Jacob he loved
[1:25:29] and so God loved in that whole
[1:25:32] generation God loved on Abraham
[1:25:34] and God came to Abraham and God he just
[1:25:39] heard a voice one day saying Abraham
[1:25:42] Abraham
[1:25:44] Abraham and he turned right around you
[1:25:47] know the rest of the story he believed
[1:25:50] God imagine that you you talk about
[1:25:53] faith you just believe a voice speaking
[1:25:56] out a thin air and pack up your goods
[1:25:59] and forget your father and mother go
[1:26:01] into follow me into a far country
[1:26:05] oh my we gotta further country we want
[1:26:08] to follow him into now but the fact is
[1:26:11] we that man came out and went to Canaan
[1:26:15] because he had a right
[1:26:17] so that worked right and he was born
[1:26:20] under the sign of that word right
[1:26:23] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:26:25] they tried to make it kind of zodiac
[1:26:28] signs and you were under this sign and
[1:26:30] people are running to the marketplace
[1:26:32] they get the newspaper or or where they
[1:26:34] can see their horror Scopes uh what
[1:26:38] their lives are going to be but praise
[1:26:40] God we were born under a sign and if I
[1:26:44] want to give them a sign that we were
[1:26:46] born under we were born under the sign
[1:26:48] of the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:26:51] amen praise God born under that praise
[1:26:55] God and we we're going back to what Abel
[1:26:59] had
[1:27:00] we're going back or we are back now to
[1:27:04] what Abraham had
[1:27:06] but it's strange to the people
[1:27:09] oh
[1:27:10] they'll say brother Branham didn't say
[1:27:12] that
[1:27:12] brother Branham didn't say this but
[1:27:15] brother Branham did say it but he might
[1:27:18] not have said in those kinds of words
[1:27:21] it's just like people say oh you should
[1:27:24] only say what brother Branham said
[1:27:25] that's just like if you sent me with a
[1:27:28] message for brother coffee in the back
[1:27:29] there and you say tell him I am coming
[1:27:33] soon and I go back there and said uh
[1:27:37] so-and-so told me to tell you I am
[1:27:39] coming soon all right just go to brother
[1:27:41] coffee and say hey coffee he's coming
[1:27:43] soon
[1:27:45] the message didn't change
[1:27:48] the meaning didn't change the person is
[1:27:51] mature enough that they are not a little
[1:27:53] child that's going to be apparenting the
[1:27:55] word for word the a message that they
[1:27:59] were given but they understood the
[1:28:01] message so they're conveying to you the
[1:28:02] meaning of that message and letting you
[1:28:05] understand what God is saying in this
[1:28:07] dearness hour praise the Lord Jesus
[1:28:09] hallelujah thank God so undeserved what
[1:28:13] is Grace undeserved
[1:28:16] from my actions on my behavior I didn't
[1:28:18] deserve anything
[1:28:20] but God still gave us Grace
[1:28:24] Above All Else God gave us His Marvelous
[1:28:29] Grace what about Jeremiah
[1:28:33] before you were in your mother's womb I
[1:28:35] called you to be a prophet
[1:28:37] you weren't even born and you were
[1:28:40] already called you weren't even born you
[1:28:43] already ordained of course men are
[1:28:46] trying to ordain people with all kinds
[1:28:48] of church things now amen hallelujah
[1:28:51] praise God but you see
[1:28:54] we had the right to have the right birth
[1:28:57] because all of us were Original Seed we
[1:29:01] bypass the spoken word birth that should
[1:29:06] have been had amen
[1:29:08] and become by the natural birth of
[1:29:12] procreation
[1:29:13] rather than being a part of the new
[1:29:17] creation
[1:29:18] by the opening of the word of God
[1:29:23] Hallelujah didn't Paul say I was born
[1:29:27] out of Due Time amen hallelujah praise
[1:29:32] God Nicodemus asked what shall a man do
[1:29:36] to be born again and you understand no
[1:29:39] I'm not going to go off on all these
[1:29:41] tangents where Jesus said you must be
[1:29:44] born again
[1:29:46] you understand why you said that because
[1:29:48] the way you were born is not God's
[1:29:51] original intention
[1:29:53] God allowed it amen God endorsed it but
[1:29:58] that's not the way you're supposed to
[1:30:00] come you're supposed to come by the way
[1:30:03] of the word
[1:30:04] Jesus and Mary illustrates it to us when
[1:30:08] the angel Gabriel stood before Thou Art
[1:30:11] Mary and you will bear a son his name
[1:30:14] Shall be Called Jesus and what Mary
[1:30:17] believe the words of the Angel amen and
[1:30:21] Jesus later on was born in our day we
[1:30:24] have had an angel of God 17 child and he
[1:30:29] has spoken this word to us and that word
[1:30:32] seed has taken life in us and now we are
[1:30:36] bringing forth what the life of Jesus
[1:30:38] Christ Hallelujah being made manifest in
[1:30:41] the True Believer praise the Lord look I
[1:30:44] this is there's freedom in the church
[1:30:46] here praise the Lord are you believe
[1:30:48] that yes
[1:30:49] I have never tried to pass through a
[1:30:51] church and put a spirit of fear I don't
[1:30:55] want you to fear me as a pastor you have
[1:30:58] to have respects but not fair
[1:31:01] no sir you ought to have it if I am off
[1:31:04] the word if I'm wrong then you have a
[1:31:06] right to take this word not with the you
[1:31:10] know
[1:31:11] beer-facedness and disrespect but uh was
[1:31:15] a brother I don't see that you're off
[1:31:17] the word here or this is that the other
[1:31:18] and then we'll sit with a word and say
[1:31:20] no this is what really the word says so
[1:31:23] so so praise the Lord I'm not asking you
[1:31:26] not to challenge me but uh
[1:31:29] but I'm
[1:31:32] yeah I understand but at least I'm
[1:31:35] letting you know that God has set us
[1:31:39] free by his word but freedom is not
[1:31:41] folly
[1:31:43] and Liberty is not lawlessness is that
[1:31:45] right God has given us all these things
[1:31:47] and we don't want to go off into messes
[1:31:50] and everything else he says you can take
[1:31:52] this very word and study it to death
[1:31:55] is that right you're going to study it
[1:31:58] until you get all twisted up praise the
[1:32:00] Lord and you go to seed Amen to
[1:32:04] spiritual death in other words amen
[1:32:06] praise God I'm so thankful to God for
[1:32:09] that amen that we were actually we were
[1:32:14] actually
[1:32:15] um as Jesus is saying You must be born
[1:32:17] again Hallelujah
[1:32:20] and he said must I go back in my
[1:32:22] mother's womb because that's the
[1:32:24] thinking of a human amen but Jesus
[1:32:27] continues to let him know he said listen
[1:32:31] uh you can't go back to Heaven unless
[1:32:34] you first came down from heaven
[1:32:36] John chapter 3 verse 30.
[1:32:38] uh amen you see you can't go into heaven
[1:32:42] unless you first came down from heaven
[1:32:46] and we can't go back to heaven or we can
[1:32:48] because we were sent down from heaven
[1:32:52] and because you were sent down you're
[1:32:54] going back up where you come from
[1:32:56] you get it oh little Jew drops
[1:33:00] Hallelujah when the sun shines the stew
[1:33:03] drops must go back where they come from
[1:33:05] praise God you come from God and you're
[1:33:08] going back to God hallelujah it's it's
[1:33:11] like that no noise no noise but yet
[1:33:15] those two drops are going right back
[1:33:17] taking gallons of water back where the
[1:33:19] man made pumps of Pentecostal nonsense
[1:33:23] and all kinds of denominational dancers
[1:33:25] keep all the noise and running up there
[1:33:27] and they sound so powerful because
[1:33:29] they're pumping water they're pumping
[1:33:31] water and the sun just comes out
[1:33:34] and starts to shine
[1:33:36] and that water goes back up more than
[1:33:40] those pumps can even dream to think of
[1:33:42] that's what's happening right now
[1:33:45] we're going back where we come from
[1:33:48] because we feel the pull
[1:33:51] we heard a voice
[1:33:53] amen praise God hallelujah amen praise
[1:33:57] the Lord amen glory to God Amen yes
[1:34:01] anyone knows that the real seal of God
[1:34:06] is
[1:34:07] your Birthright
[1:34:10] the Seal of God is the birthright do you
[1:34:13] believe that
[1:34:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:19] amen that your Birthright for Ephesians
[1:34:24] 4 30 says grief not the holy spirit of
[1:34:27] God whereby you were sealed till the day
[1:34:29] of your Redemption when they were born
[1:34:32] again they were filled with the Holy
[1:34:35] Ghost for the Holy Ghost is the new
[1:34:39] birth did you hear that
[1:34:42] the Holy Ghost is the new birth now he's
[1:34:46] not going to break up and explain all
[1:34:47] that to you because with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:50] in you now you can see the word
[1:34:52] spirit with spirit will meet
[1:34:55] and the word will attract the word
[1:34:58] deep will call to the deep and one will
[1:35:02] pull to the other so with the spirit of
[1:35:05] almighty God within your life praise God
[1:35:08] hallelujah you shall you first of all
[1:35:11] you've got to see the kingdom amen and
[1:35:15] only when you see the kingdom do you
[1:35:17] know to walk in the doorway then you can
[1:35:19] enter it praise God except a man be born
[1:35:22] again he cannot see Jesus said the first
[1:35:25] time second time when he spoke to him he
[1:35:27] said accept the man be born again he
[1:35:29] cannot enter he can't get in the Kingdom
[1:35:32] because first of all he has to have this
[1:35:35] birth right amen hallelujah oh praise
[1:35:39] God you see
[1:35:42] you
[1:35:44] you are begotten of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:48] I'll admit that
[1:35:51] but
[1:35:53] not yet born
[1:35:56] what's he talking about it's a message I
[1:35:58] preached many years ago be gotten and
[1:36:02] yet not born oh upheaval noise even
[1:36:06] Brothers in a message oh you said where
[1:36:10] you get that from what are you talking
[1:36:11] about hallelujah what the prophet is
[1:36:13] talking about you may be in the birth
[1:36:15] canal
[1:36:16] but you're not born yet
[1:36:18] and that's where Pentecost is
[1:36:21] there in the birth canal but they never
[1:36:24] came to have the breath of fresh air
[1:36:27] they haven't come to get this revelation
[1:36:30] of the word that will give them fresh
[1:36:33] air and give them life
[1:36:35] eternal praise God you see what I'm
[1:36:39] talking about there's a baby begotten
[1:36:42] when it's in the mother's womb it's only
[1:36:44] begotten now this is not some Republican
[1:36:48] and Democratic argument here this is
[1:36:50] Biblical word I'm speaking here today
[1:36:52] Hallelujah see it's got now see the
[1:36:57] little cell in that body
[1:37:01] aimpan and I just put here like a
[1:37:03] Pentecostal uh it's twisting around it's
[1:37:07] kicking it's jumping everywhere like
[1:37:10] that Hallelujah you see but when it's
[1:37:13] born Hallelujah at that point it says
[1:37:17] here brother Branham claps his hands
[1:37:19] like a doctor imitating a spank amen and
[1:37:23] I believe a lot of Christians Believers
[1:37:25] need to have a good gospel spank uh
[1:37:29] Hallelujah and nobody likes it when they
[1:37:32] get a gospel spank hallelujah praise God
[1:37:36] because it's painful at that point but
[1:37:39] you need to spank praise God he says now
[1:37:42] and then when he spanks then he squeals
[1:37:47] out
[1:37:49] and then becomes a living soul
[1:37:53] living soul is not talking about that
[1:37:56] one here but a living person
[1:37:58] becomes a person hallelujah praise God
[1:38:02] it's begotten but it's not a person
[1:38:04] until it comes out to life amen and a
[1:38:09] baby now when it's a baby it can go to
[1:38:13] church now his change is thought but
[1:38:16] listen carefully what he's saying here
[1:38:18] without saying it right out
[1:38:20] them babies go to church now and begin
[1:38:24] to say oh I believe in church I believe
[1:38:27] in God
[1:38:29] I work for the church I'll go out I'll
[1:38:31] I'll do this I'll do that oh I'm good am
[1:38:35] I not like little children ask their
[1:38:37] mother or their dad I'm good I'm good
[1:38:39] didn't I do this good didn't I do that
[1:38:41] she said little baby they go to church
[1:38:44] like that and saying I'm good I want to
[1:38:47] do right I want to do right I want to do
[1:38:49] that I want to do this and whatever else
[1:38:52] see but what it really needs is a gospel
[1:38:56] spanking to wake it up so that it can
[1:38:59] squeal itself into eternal life
[1:39:02] and when the Holy Spirit begins to
[1:39:05] scream in you praise God thank God
[1:39:07] believe the Holy Spirit screams in me I
[1:39:10] don't know about when I get excited I
[1:39:12] forget myself I forget age I forget time
[1:39:14] I forget place and everything else and I
[1:39:17] stay in the word of God hallelujah
[1:39:19] praise God I was in England I was
[1:39:21] preaching a word like this the spirit of
[1:39:23] God was moving and wonderfully well and
[1:39:26] there was a you know really high class
[1:39:28] English man a real gentleman pulling out

[1:39:34] watch and constantly looking at the time
[1:39:37] and looking at me and

[1:39:46] influence of the word and you know under
[1:39:49] the spirit of living God I just said sir

[1:40:14] young you're under the spirit of God and
[1:40:16] that's how it was but anyway praise the
[1:40:19] Lord you see then the spirit in you
[1:40:21] screams out like that and it will do
[1:40:24] that like it never screamed before

[1:41:06] hallelujah praise the Lord wonderful
[1:41:09] amen then it's a new creature then it's
[1:41:13] born of the spirit then after that it
[1:41:15] begins to grow
[1:41:18] and it begins to move it begins to have
[1:41:21] its being in God just as a baby

[1:42:53] in a body of Earth a body that has got

[1:47:44] short brief part here praise God oh my
[1:47:49] they were stoned they were sauna Sunder
[1:47:52] they were tempted they were slain with
[1:47:55] the sword they wandered about in
[1:47:57] sheepskins and goat skins that's the
[1:48:00] truth and Afflicted tormented of whom
[1:48:03] the world was not worthy wandering in
[1:48:06] deserts in mountains in dense in caves

[1:48:14] a good report through faith through
[1:48:18] Revelation Hallelujah God having

[1:48:56] and see because of that he said you
[1:48:58] begin to forget the things of the world
[1:49:02] it's no more trying to press yourself
[1:49:05] that you shouldn't forget this and
[1:49:06] forget that you start to get so Heavenly
[1:49:09] minded
[1:49:11] that you're not thinking of these
[1:49:13] Earthly things anymore
[1:49:15] and you let the Holy Spirit take over
[1:49:18] your life and manifest himself through
[1:49:21] you in every way praise the Lord let me
[1:49:24] close out with this thought and I'm
[1:49:25] closing here praise the Lord
[1:49:29] these all
[1:49:31] had
[1:49:32] that Mark
[1:49:34] now when Jesus came
[1:49:37] there was millions of people in Israel
[1:49:39] but why did he all of a sudden he sees
[1:49:41] Andrew
[1:49:43] and he calls him out
[1:49:45] because he's seen he has the birth mark
[1:49:48] and he has the right to have
[1:49:50] the right birth
[1:49:53] and he calls Andrew
[1:49:55] and he calls Peter and when Peter comes
[1:49:59] up he tells him who is his father's name
[1:50:00] and this and that and the other why he
[1:50:03] was telling him
[1:50:04] I knew you
[1:50:07] right
[1:50:08] to the others he said I never knew you
[1:50:12] but to Peter he was telling him in a
[1:50:14] nice way I know you from before the
[1:50:16] foundation of the world I know
[1:50:18] everything about you
[1:50:19] amen
[1:50:21] Peter and then he called he was
[1:50:24] demonstrating to every one of them
[1:50:26] Philip then he says Nathaniel before he
[1:50:29] even called you out of that fig tree I
[1:50:31] already know you
[1:50:32] I saw you and I know you I watch you
[1:50:36] coming down to all your Generations
[1:50:38] until you arrive in this age and then
[1:50:40] you come to a birth and everything else
[1:50:42] I knew you praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:50:45] praise God hallelujah something in him
[1:50:48] was reaching out to them
[1:50:50] and something in them was reaching back
[1:50:53] out to him because the Deep was calling
[1:50:56] to the Deep hallelujah praise God
[1:50:59] hallelujah so
[1:51:02] they
[1:51:04] because of that Gene or predestinated
[1:51:08] seed being in them
[1:51:10] they had the right
[1:51:13] to have the right birth
[1:51:15] and because of that
[1:51:18] blind bartimius was even one of that
[1:51:21] number
[1:51:22] and that's why we who were blinded on
[1:51:26] the denominational systems
[1:51:28] and streams of thought today my friends
[1:51:32] he has to pass our way
[1:51:36] because if the sea the gene of God
[1:51:39] dwells in you he has to wake it up he
[1:51:42] has to pour upon it have a present water
[1:51:44] from the rock so that the seed can
[1:51:47] germinate and come to life Lord and God
[1:51:49] let me close now because you know the
[1:51:52] spirit of God comes on you like this you
[1:51:54] want to keep going on and you're in the
[1:51:56] congregation I'm in the preacher up here
