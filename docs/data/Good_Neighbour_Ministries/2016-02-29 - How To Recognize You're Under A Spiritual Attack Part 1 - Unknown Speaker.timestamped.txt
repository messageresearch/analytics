[12:34] going through some of the same things

[13:46] nobody to speak into your hearts he can
[13:49] speak into your hearts amen amen but he
[13:53] hasn't provided way if that's the choice
[13:55] amen because we are stubborn because we
[13:59] have this flesh that we're dealing with

[14:03] like brother Graham the angel said "I
[14:04] always have to push you brother Graham
[14:06] through the pipe and push you and push
[14:08] you to do God's will." Just imagine that

[14:43] and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[14:45] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[14:49] i love you hallelujah amen revelations
[14:55] 19:6 I heard as it was a voice from a
[14:58] great
[14:59] multitude as the voice of many
[15:01] waters and as the voice of the mighty
[15:04] thunder saying
[15:06] hallelujah for the Lord God omnimate
[15:09] reignth let us be glad and rejoice and
[15:13] give honor unto
[15:14] him for the marriage of the lamb is

[15:29] white for the fine linen is the
[15:31] righteousness of the saints amen
[15:36] this is not just letter to me when Jesus
[15:39] stood up in the in the in the temple in
[15:42] the synagogue when it was time for him
[15:44] to fulfill his position he read out the
[15:47] scriptures amen and he said "I have come
[15:51] god has anointed me to heal the
[15:54] delivered the brokenhearted now." And he
[15:56] closed the scriptures and he said "This
[15:58] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[16:01] ears." I believe the word of God is
[16:04] being fulfilled again in our ears amen

[16:22] morning hallelujah amen i hope the
[16:25] marriage of the lamb is taking place in
[16:27] your heart this morning amen hallelujah
[16:30] glory to God in Galatians 5:16 "This I
[16:35] say then walk in the
[16:38] spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust
[16:41] of the
[16:43] flesh for the flesh lusteth against the
[16:46] spirit and the spirit against the
[16:50] flesh and these are contrary one to
[16:54] another so that you cannot do the things
[16:57] that you would
[17:00] but if you be led by the
[17:04] spirit you are not under the law
[17:08] you are not under this
[17:11] flesh you are not under the law of the
[17:14] letter amen you are in the spirit
[17:18] catching the information of God the
[17:22] inspiration of God for your life
[17:26] amen that's what we need more than
[17:28] anything is the revelation and
[17:30] inspiration to guide us and to lead us
[17:33] amen amen if we're only led by the flesh
[17:35] and we're only led by the law it's going
[17:38] to lead you and keep you in captivity
[17:42] those who are led by the spirit of God
[17:44] are the sons and daughters of God amen
[17:47] and the flesh fights against the spirit
[17:49] and they're contrary one to another yes
[17:53] so let's die to the flesh amen and let's
[17:56] crucify the flesh amen the carnal mind
[18:01] let's bring it under captivity and under
[18:03] subjuggestion to the word of God amen
[18:06] that's where your successes and I tell
[18:08] you 90% of our battles 90% of our prayer
[18:12] requests 90% of our struggles is because
[18:15] we're in the flesh we're in the carnal
[18:18] life yes and we need to break out of
[18:21] that saints you are called you are
[18:24] predestinated to go higher than that you
[18:28] are built and made by God the seat of
[18:32] God inside of you can rise above any
[18:34] challenge
[18:36] any circumstance amen any situation that
[18:40] you go through yes
[18:44] amen glory to
[18:47] God philippians
[18:50] 2:9 wherefore God has also highly
[18:54] exalted him and given him a name above
[18:58] every
[18:59] name that at the name of
[19:02] Jesus every knee should
[19:05] bow of things in heaven and things in
[19:08] the earth and under the
[19:12] earth and that every tongue should
[19:14] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[19:18] glory of God the Father wherefore my
[19:21] brethren as ye have always obeyed not in
[19:26] my presence
[19:28] only but now much more in my
[19:32] absence work out your own salvation with
[19:36] fear and with trembling it's not your
[19:39] brother or your sister it's not your
[19:41] husband or your wife that's going to
[19:44] work out your salvation work out your
[19:47] own salvation amen don't hide don't
[19:51] justify look in the mirror of the word
[19:54] of God amen let your life be looking in
[19:57] the mirror and face the music as they
[20:01] say face what you're going through i
[20:05] have to face my flesh i have to face my
[20:08] weaknesses i have to face the
[20:10] generational things that that that Satan
[20:12] tried to hand down to me i got to face
[20:16] the everything in my life right but I

[21:02] every situation
[21:05] shall come under subjection to your
[21:06] confession thank you Jesus what you
[21:09] speak is what you believe amen because
[21:12] out of the heart speaketh what are you
[21:15] speaking this morning what are you
[21:18] confessing are you glorifying the things
[21:22] that that Satan has put upon your life
[21:25] no or are you glorifying what God has
[21:28] said about you
[21:31] satan through even through our birth
[21:33] amen through our
[21:36] ancestors has come down through the line
[21:40] and has given us things from birth amen

[21:45] family has
[21:46] this oh uh you know my family has cancer
[21:50] my family has this my family has mental
[21:52] problems this bang bang." It's all come
[21:54] down to the line

[21:59] mouths

[22:30] you're
[22:30] rejoicing and and and and and saying

[22:42] the midst of it yes i know for myself
[22:46] amen
[22:49] i know a real God i know the power of
[22:52] God but I know there's a real devil yes

[22:57] power of the flesh the power of the
[22:59] carnal mind that can come upon you and I
[23:02] got to stand at that time amen amen and

[25:10] [Music]
[25:13] and Daniel
[25:15] 12:1 "And at that time shall Michael
[25:19] stand the great prince which standeth
[25:22] for the children of thy people and there
[25:25] shall be a time of trouble such as never
[25:29] was
[25:30] seen there was a nation even to the same
[25:33] time and at that time thy people shall
[25:38] be delivered amen glory
[25:43] at that time thy people shall be
[25:46] delivered
[25:48] are you that people
[25:50] glory to God everyone that is found
[25:55] written in the book
[25:59] everyone glory to God
[26:03] now I want to just lay a little bit of
[26:05] I've been laying a
[26:07] background i want to get a quote here
[26:09] from brother
[26:11] Brandham i think when brother Brandham
[26:14] God gave brother Brandham the greatest
[26:16] battle ever
[26:18] fought he said "The Lord has given me
[26:23] this for the church
[26:25] and it's time to bring it."
[26:29] You're the church
[26:31] amen he wasn't talking about
[26:32] Jeffersonville back then only talking
[26:35] about you you're the church amen
[26:41] i thought of the order of the heavenly
[26:44] host not one of them is out of place
[26:48] that's what we ought to come to this
[26:49] morning
[26:50] to get in place yes sir to get in order
[26:53] amen
[26:55] amen everyone keeps its time perfectly
[27:00] god's great army i thought of the
[27:02] soldiers and how that the
[27:05] moon would happen to get out of order
[27:08] the earth would be covered again with
[27:10] water just in a few
[27:13] minutes the earth would be just like it
[27:17] was when God decided to have us here on
[27:20] it it was without form and void and
[27:24] darkness and water was upon the breath
[27:27] of the earth and if that moon the bride
[27:32] would ever move it would do the same
[27:34] thing again when the moon the bride
[27:38] rocks a little bit away from the earth
[27:41] and the tides come up when it goes down
[27:45] just follow the tides it's God's great
[27:48] army and when I thought about that being
[27:51] God's great army there and then I begin
[27:54] to think not one of those get out of
[27:57] their place oh God they all set in place
[28:03] and if there's a move in anywhere of
[28:06] them it's because and it will affect
[28:09] this earth we just see the results of it
[28:12] now and when them moving into their
[28:15] other spots it affects
[28:19] I believe it affects amen i believe
[28:22] we're under spiritual attack amen the
[28:25] devil is attacking us attacking the body
[28:29] attacking the bride of Jesus Christ
[28:31] because he knows it affects
[28:34] this morning many people have been
[28:35] attacked that have to be here this
[28:37] morning right and it
[28:40] affects and this is why we need to stand
[28:44] this is why we need to be in order in
[28:47] our positions
[28:50] amen
[28:53] hallelujah we just see the results of it
[28:56] and I thought of it if that great
[28:59] heavenly host like that has to keep his
[29:01] place and make everything in order how
[29:04] about the disorder of the earthly host
[29:07] when one gets out of order how it throws
[29:09] the whole thing out of cater the whole
[29:12] program is upset
[29:14] when one member gets out of order we
[29:17] should
[29:18] continually to strive to keep the order
[29:22] of the spirit amen that's why we have
[29:26] one another that's why we battle
[29:29] together
[29:31] that's why we pray one for another amen
[29:34] that's why we confess our sins one to
[29:38] another so we can continually strive to
[29:41] keep the order of the spirit amen that's
[29:45] why we look we are our brothers and our
[29:46] sister's keeper if we see one not
[29:49] walking in the spirit we go after them
[29:52] because we know it's just an attack of
[29:54] the devil
[29:56] amen
[29:58] hallelujah
[30:00] and we would to God this morning that
[30:02] everyone would bring this to a real
[30:04] healing healing service that we could
[30:07] keep this part this group gathered under
[30:10] this roof this morning in such harmony
[30:14] that the Holy Spirit would place every
[30:17] member of the body that is here this
[30:19] morning in such harmony till there
[30:22] wouldn't be such as be such a
[30:25] spontaneous healing of soul and body

[31:16] there's only two powers in the universe
[31:19] all our differences between nations and
[31:22] each other and everything that mounts up

[31:29] things that are connected to one power

[31:37] God's power and Satan's

[38:41] hallelujah many people are facing
[38:43] spiritual struggles as they attempt to
[38:45] advance in the things of
[38:48] God one of the primary tricks of the
[38:51] enemy is to get a person
[38:53] deceived and not realizing the depths of
[38:57] what is taking place in their lives
[38:59] isn't that the truth often times people
[39:02] assume that the struggles they are
[39:04] facing is just natural battle yet just
[39:07] beneath the surface there is something
[39:09] more far complex taking place they they
[39:14] are under a spiritual attack what is it
[39:17] what is a spiritual attack a spiritual
[39:19] attack is a series of events coordinated
[39:22] by demonic realm in order to abort
[39:25] promises in your life
[39:28] shipwreck faith oppress believers and
[39:33] stall on your
[39:35] destiny paul reminds us that Satan
[39:38] should take advantage of us for we are

[39:48] of his devices
[39:50] amen we must know our enemy any nation
[39:53] that goes up against another nation has
[39:55] to study that nation to see if they can
[39:57] fight against them and see if they can
[39:59] battle against them whether they'll go
[40:02] against them or not and I'm trying to
[40:04] bring the word the word is trying to be
[40:06] brought every week to show you that you
[40:09] are a nation of God that can go against
[40:13] Satan's nation amen and defeat him amen

[40:34] spiritual something believe it let's get
[40:36] down to it if I'm on the battlefield and

[41:16] beings many people wrongly assume that
[41:19] Satan is stupid
[41:23] believe me he's a lot smarter than you
[41:27] yeah he's a lot smarter than any one of
[41:28] us put together that's why we stand
[41:31] behind the word
[41:33] we stand behind our king amen we take
[41:37] his sword not our sword and we go
[41:41] forth yet he has studied the thoughts
[41:44] and actions and behavior of the human
[41:45] since the beginning of time he knows how
[41:48] to tempt the
[41:49] people he studied you since birth

[44:34] he doesn't want you to live victorious
[44:36] he doesn't want you to be victorious in
[44:38] in the word of God in your position and
[44:40] who you are right he doesn't want to see
[44:42] prosperity he doesn't want to see
[44:43] blessings upon your life right
[44:47] but that's why we have to take the word
[44:49] that's why we got to fight this morning
[44:50] saints
[44:52] that's why we got to recognize that
[44:54] we're constantly under attack
[44:59] we're in a war
[45:01] you go tell those soldiers that are
[45:03] fighting in the in in the trenches and

[45:26] supper we're going to amen we got a time
[45:29] of peace we got a time of rest but right
[45:33] now that is in our soul but on the
[45:35] outward is a fight it's a constant fight
[45:39] it's a constant awareness of attacks
[45:41] that are coming upon our lives

[45:47] amen
[45:51] hallelujah number

[45:56] slide follow me brother amen
[46:00] loss of spiritual desire
[46:04] you're under attack

[46:11] when you lost that first love even Jesus
[46:14] himself in the book of Revelation said
[46:16] "Thou has lost thy first love do thy
[46:19] first works and repent."
[46:22] Get back saints
[46:25] shake it off
[46:27] it's an attack on your life many
[46:30] different avenues it might have come
[46:31] through your your finances might have
[46:33] come through your kids it might have
[46:35] come through your flesh and and your
[46:37] mind and different things it was an
[46:40] attack so that you lose your desire for
[46:43] this word of God
[46:46] you see Satan knows if he can take all
[46:49] this away from us how we will not be
[46:51] that hot potato that he cannot handle
[46:54] we'll just be something that he's be
[46:56] thrown around and no way Jesus Christ is
[46:58] going to allow his bride to be thrown
[47:00] around that's right amen no way he
[47:03] Hallelujah he purchases his
[47:06] life supper amen no way yes
[47:11] that's his bride amen
[47:15] [Music]
[47:17] the goal of any spiritual attack is to
[47:19] turn you away from God what God wants
[47:22] you to do in your life the first warning
[47:25] sign of the attack is a loss of
[47:27] spiritual desire you don't you don't
[47:30] live by feelings alone but there's a big
