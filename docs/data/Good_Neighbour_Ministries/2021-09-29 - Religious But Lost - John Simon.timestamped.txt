[0:41] may the lord jesus bless you richly
[0:45] and enlarge your tents may the spirit of
[0:48] god
[0:49] feed us all together
[0:51] lambs and sheep
[0:53] on followers of jesus christ the same
[0:57] yesterday today and forever
[1:01] our study continues
[1:03] our study in the
[1:06] uh church ages
[1:08] and our topic for tonight
[1:12] is
[1:14] religious
[1:15] but lost
[1:19] and our
[1:20] scripture
[1:22] is found
[1:23] in revelation
[1:25] chapter
[1:26] 3
[1:27] verse 5
[1:31] he that overcometh
[1:34] this same shall be clothed in white
[1:37] raiment
[1:40] and i will not blot out
[1:43] his name
[1:45] out of
[1:47] the book of life
[1:49] but i will confess his name before my
[1:53] father
[1:54] and before
[1:56] his
[1:57] angels
[1:59] let us also read
[2:03] first corinthians
[2:05] chapter
[2:06] 10. verses 1
[2:09] to 7.
[2:12] moreover brethren
[2:15] i would not that you should be ignorant
[2:20] how that all
[2:22] our fathers were under the cloud
[2:26] and all
[2:28] passed through the sea
[2:31] and were all baptized onto moses
[2:36] in the cloud and in the sea
[2:39] and they'd all eat the same spiritual
[2:43] meat
[2:45] and did all drink
[2:47] the same spiritual drink
[2:51] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[2:54] that followed them
[2:56] and the rock was christ
[2:59] but with many of them
[3:01] god was not well pleased for they were
[3:05] overthrown
[3:07] in the wilderness
[3:09] now these things
[3:11] were our
[3:12] examples
[3:15] to the intent
[3:17] we should not lust after evil things
[3:21] as they also lusted
[3:25] neither be ye
[3:27] idolaters
[3:29] as were some of them as it is written
[3:33] the people sat down to eat
[3:36] and drink
[3:38] and rose up to play
[3:40] praise god for the marvelous wonderful
[3:44] reading of his word
[3:46] righteous father
[3:48] we ask your blessing upon us
[3:52] your blessed word
[3:55] is before us
[3:57] and now we ask your blessing upon us
[4:01] to understand to speak
[4:03] and for the hearers to
[4:06] be inspired to
[4:08] receive what is being sent forth
[4:11] from thy storehouse father i'm just here
[4:15] to be a voice for the word
[4:18] uh and to give voice
[4:21] to this written word
[4:23] may the great holy spirit
[4:26] bless us together and galvanize our
[4:29] attention
[4:30] that we may look away and see jesus only
[4:34] that he may be glorified in his
[4:38] wonderful
[4:39] splendor
[4:40] in jesus christ's name
[4:43] amen
[4:44] and amen
[4:47] of course the story of
[4:50] israel
[4:52] we want to
[4:54] take this story of
[4:57] israel leaving egypt
[5:01] and apply it
[5:03] in the sense of showing
[5:05] us from our last talk
[5:08] about judas and the spirit of judas
[5:12] and how judas acted
[5:15] to show
[5:17] that spirit was coming down through the
[5:19] ages
[5:22] we want to grab your attention at this
[5:24] point of how it acted
[5:27] and moved
[5:29] amongst and upon
[5:32] the
[5:34] tribes of israel
[5:36] when they left egypt for canaan
[5:41] and of course god's purpose
[5:45] for bringing
[5:47] israel out
[5:49] and as i like to say
[5:51] god did not bring israel out to leave
[5:54] them to wander about
[5:56] and god did not bring us out
[5:59] uh leaderless without a guide without
[6:01] anything just to wonder about
[6:04] but god brought israel out
[6:08] that he
[6:09] might bring them out
[6:11] to bring them in
[6:13] that they might love him and serve him
[6:17] that he might bless them
[6:19] praise god in out out in blessed by the
[6:24] grace of god through service to our
[6:27] glorious and marvelous king
[6:31] now when they all left egypt
[6:35] of course they're all left with good
[6:37] intentions
[6:39] when they left when when we came out of
[6:41] the world
[6:43] we came into christ we came into the
[6:45] church we came into the message
[6:48] all with good intentions
[6:51] that we were going through
[6:53] no matter what others do
[6:55] we're going to pay the price with god's
[6:58] despised few
[7:00] and no matter what happens
[7:03] i'm going through with jesus praise god
[7:07] hallelujah
[7:08] our faith
[7:09] is not in any man or faith was not
[7:13] is not and never will be in any man
[7:17] but our fate rests upon the rock
[7:21] foundations
[7:22] of the revealed word jesus christ
[7:25] himself glory to god
[7:28] but notice
[7:31] even though all
[7:33] came out of the world
[7:36] all of israel came out of egypt
[7:39] with the
[7:41] same
[7:42] wonderful intentions
[7:45] of going all the way to the promised
[7:47] land
[7:49] yet we find
[7:51] paul
[7:52] is magnifying this truth
[7:55] and
[7:56] saying when they left egypt
[8:00] they all came out
[8:03] under the blood
[8:05] amen they all came out under the blood
[8:08] of the sacrificial lamb
[8:11] they all
[8:13] came
[8:15] went through the waters
[8:17] of baptism
[8:19] in the red sea
[8:22] they all
[8:23] enjoyed the mighty miracles signs
[8:28] wonders
[8:29] in the wilderness
[8:32] all of the blessings of god
[8:36] all of them
[8:38] at manol in the wilderness
[8:42] and they all
[8:43] drank from that spiritual rock
[8:47] of which paul
[8:48] said
[8:50] that rock
[8:52] was christ
[8:54] they enjoyed all manner of
[8:57] blessings
[8:59] miracles
[9:01] signs wonders
[9:03] the pillar of fire became like an
[9:06] every night of fear the pillar of cloud
[9:09] and everyday affair he was there to lead
[9:14] them
[9:15] for the angel of god was in that cloud
[9:20] leading god's people
[9:22] guiding them to the promised land
[9:26] and they all partock
[9:28] they all
[9:30] each one had equal access
[9:33] to all the blessings of the living god
[9:37] but
[9:39] when they got to bail pure
[9:44] all of them
[9:45] died
[9:47] as the bible tells us
[9:49] in first corinthians
[9:52] in the old testament it tells us they
[9:55] died in the wilderness
[9:57] the carcasses fell there
[10:01] for it was there at bialpur
[10:05] they refused the word of god
[10:09] they turned away
[10:12] from the words of the great jehovah
[10:15] and sought their own way
[10:18] we know the the way of a man
[10:22] amen
[10:23] it it leads unto death
[10:26] amen praise god they went away from the
[10:29] word of god hebrews 6 1-9 says
[10:35] there my friends in the pergamos age
[10:38] that once we tasted the things of god
[10:41] the marvelous wonderful truths and
[10:44] revelations of god
[10:46] and uh we we
[10:49] walk away from that
[10:51] then
[10:52] then we go on to commit them pardonable
[10:55] sin
[10:57] and
[10:58] it's hard for one such one to be
[11:01] restored again
[11:03] because of all intent
[11:05] of own desire
[11:07] refuse the word
[11:09] and turn away from it
[11:12] listen praise god hallelujah you see god
[11:17] has always required
[11:19] that you don't just take part of the
[11:22] word that you like
[11:24] or
[11:25] the part of the word that is all love
[11:29] and sweetness
[11:31] or all of the word
[11:33] that you can reason in your mind over
[11:36] with
[11:38] but my friends we are required of god
[11:41] to follow
[11:42] all of the word
[11:44] even when we don't fully understand it
[11:48] jesus asked the disciples
[11:50] do you understand it no he did not ask
[11:54] us a question he asked do you believe it
[11:58] amen now it may not hit your five senses
[12:02] on the outside
[12:03] but does it hit the man on the inside
[12:07] does he believe it or praise god god's
[12:11] looking for real believers
[12:14] people that will go all the way
[12:17] not just be religious
[12:19] to a certain point or position
[12:23] and then after that
[12:25] fade away
[12:26] into the great unknown
[12:28] yes
[12:29] my friends
[12:31] when they got the moab
[12:34] and they came up to against the appeals
[12:38] of the
[12:40] god
[12:41] bail pr there
[12:44] we find that they died in the wilderness
[12:48] now
[12:49] if we're to play that today
[12:54] there are people who seem involved
[12:57] in the things of god
[12:59] up 100
[13:03] but they're like judas iscariot
[13:07] amen
[13:08] remember
[13:09] no one but jesus himself
[13:13] knew who judas was
[13:16] and what his purpose was
[13:19] being
[13:20] in the midst
[13:23] amen
[13:24] jesus knew
[13:26] that person of judas
[13:30] and so the day came along
[13:33] that judas did exactly what israel did
[13:38] at beyond
[13:40] beyo
[13:42] he decided
[13:44] that he didn't want to associate any
[13:46] more with with moses and with israel and
[13:51] and and the people of god uh you know
[13:55] scrabbly people going in the wilderness
[13:57] and he dissociated himself
[14:01] with them
[14:03] whatsoever
[14:04] see he didn't want to join
[14:08] or to remain
[14:10] with the people of god
[14:13] but he joined himself to the false vine
[14:16] forces
[14:19] and those are the false vine
[14:22] so that he could enter into better
[14:25] financial
[14:27] conditions
[14:29] and i'm quoting right from the church
[14:31] age
[14:34] and also
[14:37] political
[14:39] organizations started to come
[14:42] into view
[14:44] but we know
[14:46] that well
[14:47] that is absolutely anti-word
[14:52] amen
[14:53] and it's also
[14:56] anti-christ amen but judas did it anyway
[15:02] he was fooled
[15:05] but the 11 were not fooled
[15:08] but they held to god's word
[15:11] and they held
[15:12] because they were elected
[15:15] and predestinated
[15:17] for that purpose
[15:19] hallelujah
[15:21] judas left
[15:23] by leaving you know he betrayed the lord
[15:27] he gave a wrong testimony
[15:30] of who jesus and his people and his
[15:32] disciples were
[15:35] and
[15:36] there he betrayed him
[15:39] amen
[15:40] and the bible tells us
[15:44] revelation 22 19
[15:47] revelation 3
[15:49] where it tells us
[15:51] i will blot his name out of the book of
[15:55] life
[15:57] amen praise god amen now
[16:01] i want you to notice
[16:04] those names and his name
[16:07] was in there
[16:10] as a
[16:13] a record of a religious or religious
[16:16] order of people
[16:18] amen
[16:20] and
[16:22] these people were
[16:24] religious
[16:26] they were good people
[16:28] but remember
[16:30] their worship
[16:33] centered around the true god
[16:36] and they worship the true god
[16:39] and glorified the true
[16:42] and the living god hallelujah
[16:45] but they did not worship him
[16:48] with the right spirit and
[16:51] in a revelation or having a revelation
[16:55] of the truth
[16:58] amen
[16:59] and like judas
[17:01] he did not go all the way
[17:05] hallelujah
[17:07] you see
[17:08] the bible says jesus said
[17:11] have not i chosen you
[17:14] but one of you is a devil
[17:17] you see he was chosen by jesus christ
[17:21] and the bible yet says he was a devil
[17:25] but remember my friends
[17:29] that
[17:30] this choosing which i will touch on
[17:34] in a moment
[17:37] for judas was chosen of god
[17:41] he was instructed
[17:44] in the ministry or in the preaching of
[17:47] the word
[17:48] in the things of god
[17:51] not by the bishop the archbishop the
[17:53] superintendent or even by me
[17:55] it was by the lord himself
[18:00] judas was under his instruction
[18:04] and it did him no good
[18:08] he also shared
[18:11] in the knowledge of the mystery
[18:15] amen
[18:16] and there it was
[18:18] that he was allowed to come on the
[18:20] border land
[18:23] of
[18:24] getting a knowledge of the mystery but
[18:28] not a revelation of the mystery
[18:31] of god
[18:33] so chosen for a purpose
[18:37] just like the
[18:38] lying spirit
[18:40] of first kings
[18:42] 22 20 to 23
[18:47] when that lying spirit came up before
[18:49] the lord
[18:51] and said lord
[18:52] um uh uh let me go down i'll get in the
[18:55] mouth of ahab's prophets and i'm i'm
[18:58] gonna lie through them
[19:00] the spirit asks god
[19:03] if he could go down
[19:05] to do the job
[19:07] or fulfill the purpose of a liar
[19:10] and god permitted him
[19:14] so
[19:15] the word chosen and permitted
[19:19] could be used
[19:21] at that point
[19:22] we can look at it judas was permitted
[19:26] to betray the lord jesus christ
[19:30] and there it is
[19:32] i want you to illustrate that again
[19:35] in the book of job chapter 1
[19:39] again
[19:40] another evil spirit comes up
[19:43] the day came when the sons of god came
[19:46] in the presence of god and the bible
[19:48] tells us and satan was amongst them
[19:52] and he said oh he's begin to speak about
[19:55] job you say he's righteous and this and
[19:58] that he doesn't curse you because you're
[20:00] blessing him just let me go down there
[20:03] and i'll tempt him i'll test him i'll do
[20:06] this i'll do that
[20:09] and you'll see he'll curse your name and
[20:12] yeah and everything and god's permitted
[20:15] him again he was permitted in that sense
[20:19] the word
[20:21] chosen by the translators was used but
[20:24] it's really he was permitted
[20:27] right to go down to do that job of being
[20:31] a liar a chapter
[20:34] an accuser
[20:36] all my friend and so he came to earth
[20:39] and this was judas's purpose
[20:42] chosen
[20:44] instructed
[20:46] and even entering in not into the
[20:50] revelation
[20:51] but into the
[20:53] knowledge
[20:55] he had the outward knowledge
[20:57] he could put all the scopes the old
[20:59] prophets together
[21:01] he could tie it together and make sense
[21:04] out of it he could trill your heart with
[21:08] it my goodness and more than that
[21:11] we understand
[21:13] that he
[21:14] had a ministry
[21:17] of miracles
[21:19] signs and wonders
[21:22] that was given to him
[21:24] my friends
[21:25] we're living in a day right now
[21:28] when this same spirit is very active
[21:32] and when
[21:33] many
[21:34] millions
[21:36] religious
[21:38] but lost
[21:39] lost
[21:41] in a world filled with confusion
[21:44] and chaos
[21:46] listening to the word of god
[21:49] out of the sermon demonology
[21:53] today my dear christian friends
[21:58] demons are working
[22:00] and they are on every hand
[22:03] and god's spirit
[22:06] is moving also
[22:09] right on out
[22:11] to counteract that every time you
[22:14] remember the scripture says when the
[22:16] enemy comes in like a flood
[22:20] thus god said ah his spirit will raise
[22:23] up a standard against him and i believe
[22:27] god's spirit
[22:29] is raising up a standard
[22:32] against this flood
[22:34] this onslaught of the attacks of the
[22:37] enemy upon individuals that serve god
[22:42] upon the true church of god
[22:46] it's under the attack of the devil as
[22:49] never before from every area
[22:53] amen here it is my friends
[22:56] not be fined you see
[22:59] demons they are working
[23:02] do you believe demons are working today
[23:05] yes they are my friends
[23:07] they and they are very religious
[23:11] we know that
[23:13] for satan was religious
[23:16] he was kicked out
[23:17] for being just religious
[23:20] in the realms of heaven
[23:23] kicked down to earth
[23:26] and you know the rest of the story
[23:28] how he produced the sun
[23:30] and his name was kane son of that wicked
[23:34] one
[23:35] and he also was very religious
[23:39] with his altar beautiful filled with
[23:42] flowers and
[23:44] lovely indeed but it was nothing but the
[23:47] works of his hands
[23:49] and there it is religious but lost
[23:53] satan religious but lost
[23:57] you'll find that principle
[24:00] running right through
[24:02] the bible which you just use your
[24:06] the scriptures and let the spirit of god
[24:09] lead you how very religious there were
[24:14] but lost
[24:16] many millions
[24:20] that are going to church
[24:22] every sunday
[24:26] my friends
[24:28] millions
[24:30] repeating the apostles creed
[24:33] with all sincerity
[24:36] millions singing doxologies
[24:40] and everything religious
[24:42] beautiful songs
[24:45] my friends
[24:46] satan himself was a beautiful heavenly
[24:49] singer but kicked out of heaven
[24:53] oh
[24:54] just as religious
[24:56] as they can be
[24:59] and as he was
[25:01] someone says
[25:03] is that the truth
[25:04] yes my friends
[25:06] that's the same kind of religious spirit
[25:11] that was there right throughout those
[25:13] gospels
[25:14] and even in the book of acts and if you
[25:17] continue to follow the trail of the
[25:20] serpent you'll find that same religious
[25:24] spirit
[25:27] that was dressed in all manner of
[25:29] religious paraphernalia with great
[25:31] religious titles uh doctor of this and
[25:35] doctor of that and rabbi this and rabbi
[25:38] that there were the very ones
[25:41] that crucified the word of god
[25:44] the revealed word and the reason why
[25:48] because the word did not come to them in
[25:52] the way they envisioned or the way they
[25:55] thought it would come
[25:57] the word came contrary to their senses
[26:01] the word come contrary to their culture
[26:05] the word came contrary to their wisdom
[26:08] and intelligence the word came contrary
[26:11] to their schools and their rabbinical uh
[26:14] schools and the schools they have today
[26:17] the word comes contrary to that and it
[26:20] comes out in a wilderness it comes out
[26:23] from out of the backside of the desert
[26:26] it comes out that way for that is god's
[26:29] way and god's principle and god will not
[26:33] change it not for anything in the world
[26:36] for god never changes his mind about his
[26:40] word oh my
[26:43] yes sir
[26:44] it was religious demons
[26:49] operating
[26:52] in the religious realms
[26:55] that actually
[26:57] hung jesus on the cross
[27:00] they pressed for his crucifixion
[27:04] they wanted to destroy the world then
[27:06] they want to destroy it now and they'll
[27:09] do everything in their power to do that
[27:13] oh
[27:14] but jesus said when they said we are
[27:17] about father abraham we be religious
[27:19] jesus said but you are of your father
[27:21] the devil
[27:24] and his works you will do his
[27:27] for he he was a liar and a murderer from
[27:31] the beginning
[27:33] and you are here doing the same works
[27:36] which abraham didn't do
[27:39] and claiming you're from abraham
[27:41] and your seed life
[27:44] your regions
[27:46] your genealogy
[27:48] proves that you are from satan you're
[27:51] from your father the devil and his works
[27:55] you will do
[27:57] now oh some say well russia rushes the
[28:00] antichrist russia let me tell you my
[28:04] friends
[28:05] russia is not the antichrist
[28:09] let me repeat
[28:10] not russia russia is not the antichrist
[28:15] don't look at the iron curtain
[28:19] my friends don't look at the bamboo
[28:21] curtain
[28:22] what you should fear the most according
[28:24] to this 20th century prophet
[28:27] is that soft smooth purple curtain
[28:31] that is coming up on the face of the
[28:34] earth
[28:35] watch my friends
[28:38] i tell you clearly
[28:41] demons working and they are working
[28:44] overtime
[28:45] in this time that we are in
[28:48] and it's getting tighter and tighter
[28:51] the pressure is on and it's coming down
[28:55] and they're working
[28:57] now in the physical realm
[29:00] we pray for the sick
[29:02] we pray for the disease the suffering
[29:06] many times
[29:07] we have to come against the spirit of
[29:10] cancer
[29:12] we have got to come against some growth
[29:16] but it's a demon
[29:18] it's a devil
[29:19] the doctor will tell you what it is and
[29:22] he is right from his point of view of
[29:24] what he can touch
[29:26] uh
[29:27] see
[29:28] feel
[29:29] shapes that he can x-ray and see
[29:32] but from the realm of those
[29:35] that are spiritual
[29:37] it's a devil that caused that
[29:40] interruption
[29:41] and there it is my friends
[29:44] that
[29:45] in that realm he goes by that name
[29:48] they're calling all kinds of other name
[29:51] he's dumb he's blind he's death is this
[29:54] and yet jesus reject come out thou deaf
[29:57] spirit come out your dumb spirit he even
[30:01] spoke to the spirit of death and told
[30:04] them to give way for their master jesus
[30:08] christ is here on the scene amen praise
[30:13] god hallelujah so we call it cancer out
[30:17] there but then
[30:19] when it operates only as a spirit
[30:23] as an invisible entity
[30:26] it carries the same corrosive
[30:29] acidic effect
[30:32] upon the minds and hearts of man
[30:37] it creates that atmosphere
[30:40] that will drive you away from god
[30:44] that will take away your spiritual
[30:46] health and your spiritual life from you
[30:50] oh my
[30:52] yes sir
[30:54] and we know that it's nothing but devils
[30:58] amen
[30:59] we come over here today
[31:02] and we see those same devils
[31:05] that are still working in that realm
[31:09] is also working in the religious realm
[31:13] they haven't changed their ways
[31:15] they haven't changed their tactics
[31:18] they were pious back then
[31:21] there were pious under the pharisees the
[31:24] sadducees
[31:25] they were real religious and learned
[31:28] there were real clean living but yet
[31:33] jesus tells us they're real who really
[31:36] who they were
[31:39] and
[31:40] how though they were pious
[31:43] he says that's how the people see you
[31:45] that's how they interpret you
[31:47] that's how you when trained to present
[31:50] that persona that you are you are a
[31:53] religious man
[31:55] person
[31:56] you know how to make a presentation of
[31:59] self but i am here the word of god
[32:03] which reveals and discern the hearts the
[32:05] intentions and motives of man
[32:08] and the word of god said you are of your
[32:12] father the devil you came from him
[32:16] and you are his uh progenitors you are
[32:19] his you are his descendants
[32:22] you come from him
[32:23] you are not of abraham
[32:25] for your religious spirits demons
[32:29] they're still here
[32:31] and they're still working in the world
[32:33] today
[32:35] yes sir i tell you my friends
[32:38] oh
[32:39] cain was religious
[32:41] he was there with his brother abell
[32:45] they were together with their mother
[32:48] they came from the same womb together
[32:51] like two believers same church
[32:54] shoulder to shoulder or close together
[32:58] brother sisters one of god one of the
[33:02] devil
[33:03] one king one of abel my friends one
[33:08] without any revelation one having only a
[33:13] knowledge of the truth and the knowledge
[33:16] of the revelation remember
[33:20] esau was also a very religious man
[33:24] and he saw look like the gentleman
[33:27] while uh jacob looked like he
[33:30] was the
[33:32] like they you know
[33:34] a roughhouse fat kind of fallow but yet
[33:38] he was god's seed god's elected for that
[33:42] day and for that time
[33:45] judas
[33:46] was also
[33:47] very religious
[33:49] close to jesus
[33:52] in jesus church
[33:55] a member of his congregation
[33:58] religious but lost
[34:02] oh my
[34:04] it's religion
[34:07] and when we look at it
[34:08] back then it was the religious leaders
[34:12] and today
[34:14] it's not the outside people that will
[34:19] try to destroy the church
[34:22] it will not the outside people that
[34:25] destroy that preacher
[34:28] that servant of god
[34:30] that tries to serve him faithfully
[34:33] no it will be the same demonic spirit
[34:38] amen
[34:39] operating on the religious realm being
[34:43] so religious so pious such a good person
[34:47] 100
[34:48] brother branham said doing great work
[34:51] amen hallelujah he said here let me
[34:54] quote
[34:55] they're right in your ranks
[35:00] right in your ranks
[35:03] by graph 218 demonology
[35:08] see
[35:09] it's right in your ranks
[35:12] watch that
[35:13] but it's demonology
[35:16] maybe a little later on
[35:18] i'll touch on that a little bit more but
[35:21] remember this
[35:23] you recognize it as demonology it's
[35:26] moving the people influencing the people
[35:29] but condemn
[35:32] no one
[35:34] love
[35:35] everybody
[35:37] if you can't love from your heart
[35:40] then christ
[35:42] is not with you
[35:44] remember that my brothers and my sisters
[35:47] regardless of what happens around you
[35:50] whatever you see or hear or feel or
[35:53] whatever
[35:54] love everybody
[35:56] condemn no one
[35:58] but let the love of christ dwell richly
[36:02] within your heart by faith
[36:05] and the genuine love and grace of god
[36:09] not something that's put on or
[36:11] masqueraded with or using it as a mask
[36:15] but the genuine love of god
[36:18] must flow out of you in its richness and
[36:21] fullness and be a blessing to the world
[36:24] and all those that are around you
[36:29] judas had great power
[36:32] great evidence
[36:34] of the holy spirit
[36:36] moving on his life
[36:39] amen
[36:40] he even healed the sick
[36:42] like many preachers today many people
[36:45] today
[36:47] he even cast out devils
[36:49] and he was a devil
[36:51] but he was a great prince of devils or
[36:54] he can cast out any lesser devils anyway
[36:57] so here is my friends
[36:59] uh you see
[37:01] he cast them out in jesus name
[37:04] but when the great
[37:07] showdown came
[37:08] the time to
[37:10] make a decision
[37:12] with whose side you're on
[37:15] what is your stand
[37:17] where do you stand
[37:19] like like like luther said here i stand
[37:23] so help me god i can do no other my
[37:26] stand is upon the word of god the just
[37:30] shall live by faith amen hallelujah
[37:34] when the showdown came
[37:37] judah sold out for gold
[37:40] and silver
[37:43] sold out for political power with the
[37:46] powers of the day
[37:49] and he did not go up to pentecost
[37:54] to get the
[37:56] rest of the word
[37:58] or to get the
[37:59] resurrected word
[38:02] amen
[38:03] he just took that part of the word that
[38:06] he could see and study and and and feel
[38:09] and fish with and and and and be a
[38:12] friend with around that word but when
[38:14] the word went into another dimension of
[38:17] resurrection
[38:19] he did not go up to pentecost
[38:22] to receive the word of god
[38:25] in that form
[38:27] for he was devoid
[38:29] of the spirit i want to make a quotation
[38:34] here
[38:34] from
[38:35] the prophet of this 20th century brother
[38:38] william marion branham who says
[38:42] make no mistake about it
[38:45] a person that is truly baptized
[38:48] by the holy ghost
[38:50] into the body of christ
[38:53] receiving
[38:54] the fullness of the spirit
[38:57] will be in the word
[39:01] all the way
[39:04] that is the evidence
[39:07] of being baptized
[39:10] with the holy ghost
[39:12] that my friends
[39:14] from the mouth of god's servant
[39:18] the genuine evidence
[39:21] of the
[39:22] baptism of the holy ghost
[39:26] hallelujah
[39:28] is and i repeat
[39:30] a person
[39:32] that is truly baptized by the holy ghost
[39:39] into the body of christ receiving the
[39:43] fullness
[39:44] of the spirit
[39:46] will be in the word
[39:49] all the way
[39:52] god calls us not to go part of the way
[39:56] enough to say i believe it
[39:58] i'm religious
[40:00] i
[40:01] i live by the word i live it pure
[40:05] i'm doing the best i can god asks us to
[40:09] go all the way
[40:12] amen yes sir
[40:14] oh praise god forevermore
[40:18] hallelujah amen furthermore
[40:22] jesus said
[40:24] this removal
[40:27] of the name out of the book
[40:29] this blotting out
[40:31] of the name from out of the book
[40:35] let's take our thoughts back to
[40:38] israel
[40:40] with moses again
[40:42] exodus
[40:44] chapter 32
[40:46] verses 30
[40:48] to 34.
[40:51] and
[40:53] moses returned unto the lord and said
[40:57] all this people have sinned a great sin
[41:00] and have made them themselves
[41:02] gods of gold
[41:06] yet now if thou wilt forgive their sins
[41:09] and if not
[41:10] block me i pray thee
[41:13] out of the book which thou hast written
[41:17] and the lord said unto moses
[41:20] where whatsoever whosoever hath sinned
[41:24] against me
[41:26] him
[41:28] will i blot out of my book
[41:32] amen therefore go now and lead the
[41:35] people unto the place i have chosen
[41:39] unto thee my angels shall go before thee
[41:43] nevertheless in the day when i visit
[41:47] their sin upon them
[41:49] you will see
[41:51] amen now
[41:53] it is evident from the scripture we read
[41:57] that names have been removed
[42:00] and names were going to be
[42:03] removed from the book of life
[42:06] airtime passes
[42:09] god was going to take some names out of
[42:12] the book of life and in particular it
[42:14] was because
[42:16] of idolatry gods of gold and so on it
[42:20] was because of the sin
[42:22] of
[42:23] idolatry
[42:25] because the tribes particularly of dan
[42:30] and ephraim
[42:32] lost their rights
[42:35] as the tribes of israel
[42:38] by worshiping
[42:40] the golden calf
[42:43] worshiping money
[42:44] golden idols
[42:47] there it is
[42:48] and all who worship the idols
[42:51] have their names
[42:53] removed
[42:55] from the book of life
[42:58] when israel rejected
[43:02] the leadership
[43:03] of the great pillar of fire
[43:07] and turned away from the pillar of fire
[43:10] to worship golden calves
[43:15] their names were removed
[43:17] from the book of life
[43:19] exodus 32 verses 30 verse 33
[43:24] whosoever has sinned against me
[43:27] him will i blot out of my
[43:31] book
[43:33] my friends if turning to idols
[43:36] demands the penalty
[43:38] of the removal of names
[43:41] from the book of life
[43:44] then surely
[43:46] the rejection of jesus christ himself as
[43:49] the messiah
[43:51] would demand
[43:53] a same
[43:54] or similar penalty according to the word
[43:58] of god think seriously upon what you
[44:01] just heard
[44:03] amen
[44:04] read psalm 69
[44:07] which speaks of the humiliation of jesus
[44:11] verses 21
[44:13] to 28 how they gave him gall
[44:17] and vinegar to drink
[44:19] and listen he speaks saying let their
[44:22] table become a snare before them
[44:27] that they should have been for their
[44:28] welfare
[44:30] what should have been for their welfare
[44:32] let it become a
[44:35] and let their eyes
[44:39] be darkened
[44:40] let them be chained
[44:43] in clouds of darkness
[44:46] amen
[44:48] yes my friends of course we understand
[44:52] back then
[44:55] their names were blotted out
[44:57] for idolatry
[45:00] and in our day again
[45:02] millions of names
[45:04] are going to be blotted out
[45:07] because of idolatry
[45:10] what idolatry
[45:12] we know my friends
[45:15] that denomination denominationalist
[45:20] is idolatry for a denomination is an
[45:23] idol
[45:25] or an image
[45:27] unto the beast
[45:29] and god said i'll blot out the names of
[45:34] those that worship idols turn away from
[45:38] his word
[45:40] and worship idols
[45:42] go into
[45:43] the
[45:44] nominations oh my friends think about it
[45:48] the word of god
[45:50] hallelujah amen
[45:53] god
[45:54] said
[45:56] let them come not come not come into thy
[45:59] righteousness
[46:01] but let them be blotted out of the book
[46:04] of the living
[46:06] and not be written
[46:08] with the righteous
[46:10] and so
[46:12] the jews
[46:14] who rejected jesus
[46:18] and turned away literally
[46:21] from their great jehovah god
[46:24] rejecting jesus
[46:28] on the clouds of darkness of not
[46:31] recognizing
[46:32] that the jehovah
[46:35] spirit
[46:36] had now
[46:38] become flesh to walk amongst men and to
[46:42] be emmanuel
[46:44] god with us
[46:46] even so
[46:48] we find the jews rejected jesus then
[46:53] and now the gentiles did the same thing
[46:58] acts chapter 13 verses 46 to 48
[47:03] where paul and barnabas
[47:07] had to rebuke the jews
[47:09] and say because you reject the word
[47:12] you've turned it down
[47:14] we have been commanded by the lord hence
[47:18] we turn to the gentiles
[47:21] and the bible
[47:22] reads i have been set to be a light to
[47:26] the gentiles
[47:28] that thou should this be for salvation
[47:30] unto the ends of the earth
[47:32] and when the young gentiles heard this
[47:35] they were glad
[47:37] and glorified the word of the lord and
[47:41] as many
[47:43] as were ordained
[47:45] to eternal life
[47:47] believed
[47:49] amen hallelujah praise god
[47:53] now
[47:55] this is not to suggest
[47:58] that there will not
[48:01] there will be no more names
[48:03] from amongst the tribes of israel
[48:07] on god's great book
[48:10] of life
[48:12] by the way the book of life lamb's book
[48:14] of life is used interchangeably
[48:17] so
[48:18] don't got get hung up upon that unless
[48:21] god would grace you with an
[48:23] understanding of the fullness of that
[48:25] amen but here it is my friends
[48:31] the jews rejected him
[48:34] and just as the tribes of dan and
[48:37] ephraim were blotted out
[48:39] from amongst them
[48:42] now the entire
[48:45] nation and tribe of israel
[48:47] rejected jesus christ as their messiah
[48:51] and when you do that rejecting the word
[48:56] then what does he do
[48:58] he said i'll blot out their names also
[49:02] now when that statement is made don't go
[49:05] to the extreme
[49:07] and to give a wrong impression
[49:11] it doesn't tell you that all of them
[49:13] will be blotted out but listen carefully
[49:19] god speaks in his word
[49:23] that
[49:24] amounts the gentiles that now are going
[49:27] to be coming in for now we know that the
[49:31] uh
[49:32] law changed to grace
[49:34] the dispensation of law changed to grace
[49:38] when jesus died
[49:40] and paul the messengers ministry began
[49:44] in the first church age
[49:47] under grace
[49:50] now under grace
[49:52] the spirit is calling to all men of all
[49:55] nations
[49:58] and as a result
[50:00] we know that there will be jews and
[50:03] there are
[50:04] jews in the gentile church
[50:07] even today
[50:10] hallelujah
[50:12] because we are not suggesting
[50:15] that all israel
[50:18] is blotted out
[50:20] from the book of the living
[50:23] for amongst the jews
[50:25] god knows them that are his
[50:29] hallelujah
[50:31] and he knows them and knows their
[50:33] position
[50:35] and will call them out
[50:38] in his time and in his season
[50:42] listen there are groups of people
[50:46] coming forth from the jews
[50:48] which i'd like to
[50:50] identify quickly here
[50:53] one
[50:54] jews
[50:56] that will be born again
[50:58] individually as individuals
[51:02] within the framework
[51:04] of the gentile
[51:06] church
[51:07] god
[51:08] is calling some of them
[51:11] and some of them are answering the call
[51:15] for they recognize
[51:18] that jesus is not a part of the trinity
[51:22] but that he is father son and holy ghost
[51:25] the name
[51:27] of the father son and holy ghost jesus
[51:30] christ the one true and only god
[51:34] jehovah made flesh for a season of time
[51:38] amen hallelujah the word
[51:42] became flesh and dwelt among us and
[51:45] revealed himself to us and among us for
[51:48] his glory and for his honor went back
[51:51] into glory came back down in the form of
[51:54] the holy spirit and is now here amongst
[51:57] us manifesting and revealing himself and
[52:01] making himself known to his children
[52:04] individually wherever they are whoever
[52:07] they are wherever they're from god is
[52:10] making himself known so first
[52:14] out of the jews
[52:16] individual
[52:18] jewish
[52:19] saints believers
[52:21] called out
[52:23] by god's election
[52:25] through the blood of christ
[52:28] amen
[52:29] called to answer their name spiritually
[52:32] speaking
[52:34] how amen
[52:35] then
[52:36] there are the martyred jews
[52:39] that were martyred under the fifth seal
[52:42] in the book of revelation
[52:44] martha practically during the time
[52:48] stalin hitler many others down through
[52:51] the ages they were killed by the
[52:54] millions of martyred oh my but many of
[52:58] those
[53:00] are people of god
[53:02] where god's great spirit hallelujah
[53:05] calls to their spirit to bring them into
[53:08] his divine presence amen not a bunch of
[53:13] tricky uh crooks and tricksters but
[53:16] people who laid down their lives for
[53:19] their faith and were martyred for the
[53:22] faith of the word of god amen yes sir
[53:26] martyr jews
[53:28] and then
[53:29] the 144
[53:32] 000 also
[53:35] is another group
[53:37] out of the jews
[53:39] that will be brought into the kingdom of
[53:41] god
[53:43] remember i say
[53:44] 144 000 jews
[53:48] not 144
[53:49] gentiles
[53:51] never mind what name you put upon them
[53:55] whether you call them jehovah witnesses
[53:57] but you call them
[53:59] latter-day saints whether you call them
[54:01] christian scientists whatever name you
[54:04] place on them the bible says clearly in
[54:08] the book of revelation
[54:12] 144 000
[54:14] jews
[54:16] 12 000 of every tribe amen that god will
[54:22] bring in as part
[54:25] of his own
[54:27] and no gentiles
[54:30] should have the presumption
[54:33] of inserting inserting themselves
[54:37] in there to say they are one of those
[54:41] 144 000 that is demonic that is
[54:45] absolutely false it's contrary to the
[54:48] word of our god for god has made it
[54:51] plain
[54:54] that he will bring out
[54:56] three
[54:58] three groups or sections
[55:01] from the jewish people
[55:04] to repeat individual jews
[55:08] during the gents saved during the
[55:10] gentile church age
[55:14] martyred jews
[55:16] as we can see from under the fifth seals
[55:20] from their sufferings through the ages
[55:23] their martyrdom and murders
[55:25] right andrew hitler and stalin and
[55:29] right on down my friends
[55:32] real ones god knows them
[55:35] and he's the one
[55:37] that calls them as his own
[55:39] and lastly the 144 thousands
[55:43] jews that god calls out
[55:47] israel
[55:48] in its majority
[55:50] its name
[55:52] was removed
[55:54] from the book of life because of what
[55:58] idolatry
[56:01] and the majority of the gentile church
[56:04] world also that's here right now
[56:08] their names will be removed
[56:11] from the book
[56:13] of life because again the same sin the
[56:17] sin of i dollar tree
[56:21] but the this idolatry is in another
[56:23] realm
[56:24] not just an idol on a wall
[56:27] or a calf sitting there on a block my
[56:30] friends
[56:32] but an image on to the beast
[56:35] you're worshiping an idol
[56:38] an image
[56:39] onto the beast
[56:41] amen so it is clear
[56:45] present presented to you clearly in the
[56:48] word of god
[56:50] amen
[56:52] but while that is happening my friends
[56:55] god
[56:56] will call out some
[57:00] whose names are not even on the book
[57:03] we'll bless them and reward them
[57:06] there's no assurance of who that is
[57:09] where they are
[57:11] they've done something good for the
[57:13] bride of christ
[57:15] they've helped the people of god
[57:17] they've supported the people of god
[57:19] they've encouraged the people of god
[57:21] they've comforted the people of god
[57:24] they've brought sucker and aid to the
[57:27] people of god listen from the word of
[57:29] god hear what it says here
[57:32] now
[57:33] then shall the king say unto them on his
[57:37] right hand
[57:38] come you blessed of my father
[57:41] inherit the kingdom

[59:02] and these shall go away into everlasting
[59:05] punishment
