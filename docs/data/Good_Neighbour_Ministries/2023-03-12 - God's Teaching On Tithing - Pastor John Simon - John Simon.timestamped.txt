[38:10] what God tells me to say and it might be
[38:13] to some people
[38:15] um something of controversy controversy
[38:18] some may not like it
[38:21] Others May I don't know but all I have
[38:24] to do is to bring it because you know
[38:27] preachers are just God's Postman
[38:30] I don't bother kicking the postman after
[38:33] you read the bad news from somewhere
[38:36] else you know you get the bad news and
[38:40] then you want to beat up the postman the
[38:43] postman didn't send the letter he didn't
[38:44] write the letter he just delivering the
[38:46] letter and that's all we are here to do
[38:50] is to deliver the letter is that right
[38:52] praise God so once you understand that
[38:56] then I feel free that nobody will run up
[39:00] here and try to pull me down or anything
[39:02] like that like uh a certain Bishop over
[39:06] there in the United States when I was
[39:07] preaching and he didn't like what I was
[39:10] saying and he didn't even walk up the
[39:12] aisle he was coming across the on top
[39:15] the pews it was that mad but God by his
[39:19] grace just kept us and preserved us to
[39:22] this day and time we give God the praise
[39:24] and honor and Glory our scripture
[39:27] is found in Hebrews chapter 7.
[39:33] Hebrews chapter 7
[39:35] and we will read from verse 1.
[39:41] right down to verse 10.
[39:45] and read with your understanding not
[39:49] just reading like you're reading a novel
[39:51] think about what you're reading as you
[39:54] see it up there praise the Lord I have
[39:58] it in front of me here I can open this
[40:00] but I have it printed out here okay so
[40:03] I'm going from this
[40:07] a gracious father as we about to read
[40:10] the written word
[40:12] we pray that your spirit will hover over
[40:15] it
[40:16] may the great light of God that hung
[40:20] above the Ark of it of the Covenant
[40:23] may he Lord just hang over this Covenant
[40:30] of your word
[40:32] and may the Holy Spirit of almighty God
[40:36] shed forth upon us your matchless grace
[40:41] for we ask it in no other name but in
[40:45] the mighty name of our Majesty the Lord
[40:48] and Savior Jesus Christ amen and amen
[40:53] for this Melchizedek
[40:56] king of Salem
[40:59] Priests of the most high God
[41:02] who met Abraham returning from the
[41:06] slaughter of the Kings and blessed him
[41:12] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[41:18] of all
[41:20] first being by interpretation king of
[41:24] righteousness and after that king of
[41:28] Salem which is king of peace
[41:33] without father
[41:35] without mother
[41:37] without descent
[41:40] having neither the beginning of days
[41:43] nor the end of life
[41:47] but made like unto the Son of God
[41:53] abided a priest continually
[41:56] now consider this great man
[42:00] amen
[42:01] well this great man was unto whom even
[42:05] the patriarch Abraham gave the tent of
[42:09] the spoils
[42:11] and verily they that are the sons of the
[42:15] sons of Levi who receive the office of
[42:19] the priesthood have a commandment
[42:23] to take tithes of the people
[42:26] according to the law that is of their
[42:30] brethren
[42:31] through they come out of the loins of
[42:34] Abraham but he whose descent is not
[42:38] conquered from them
[42:40] receive signs of Abraham and bless him
[42:46] that had the promises
[42:50] and without all contradiction the less
[42:53] is blessed of the better
[42:56] and here men that receive tithes that
[42:59] die receive tithes but there he
[43:03] receiveth them of whom it is witness he
[43:06] live at
[43:08] and as I may so say Levi also who
[43:13] receive tithes paid tithes in Abraham
[43:17] for he was not while he while he was yet
[43:21] in the loins of his father
[43:23] for he was yet in the loins of his
[43:26] father when Melchizedek met him praise
[43:30] the Lord
[43:31] my topic today is God's teaching
[43:35] on tithing
[43:37] please be seated
[43:43] why after all this marvelous parade of
[43:49] deep Supernatural things the Holy Spirit
[43:52] would swing my attention to something
[43:56] like that I don't know
[43:59] I am just following what the holy
[44:01] because I've preached on this many times
[44:04] years ago and different messages along
[44:07] this line and at this time you're
[44:09] thinking that real Christians already
[44:11] should know all this stuff so you don't
[44:14] bother with that you keep going into all
[44:17] but no come back and speak on this
[44:21] amen so that's what I am doing here and
[44:26] God will speak to you and fulfill his
[44:28] own purposes and his own plans what he
[44:31] has in his mind
[44:33] uh the first thing is here first I can
[44:36] go to the scripture that we read here
[44:38] and just
[44:39] give a quick run of this not touching on
[44:44] it but it's saying here that Abraham
[44:47] paid tithes to this one who is eternal
[44:50] no beginning no ending it's plainly
[44:53] there and that person of course is God
[44:56] but he was appearing in a body like unto
[45:00] the sun right he appeared in a body like
[45:04] that that was the theophany god's
[45:06] theophany condescending before it could
[45:10] turn into actual flesh right it wasn't a
[45:14] theophonic condition or state at that
[45:16] particular time before it came to be
[45:19] Jesus Christ amen so we know Jesus
[45:23] Christ is the same Melchizedek all right
[45:27] I made manifest In the Flesh right
[45:31] brother Brandon priests that wonderful
[45:33] message who is this Melchizedek amen
[45:37] praise the Lord think on that but glory
[45:40] be to his wonderful name the Bible says
[45:43] here this consider how great this man
[45:47] was making sure that that you know it
[45:50] was a man right but in the inside of
[45:54] what appeared to be a man was God
[45:58] right now but considering how great this
[46:02] man was unto whom even the patriarch
[46:06] Abraham gave the tent of the spoils
[46:11] and they that are the sons of Levi who
[46:14] have received the office of the
[46:15] priesthood or as a pastor or Minister
[46:18] have a commandment
[46:22] they have a commandment if we say don't
[46:25] obey that commandment
[46:27] of accepting tithes from God's people
[46:31] there will now become guilty if they
[46:34] don't preach on it if they don't
[46:35] instruct the people on it they become
[46:38] the guilty ones it's right in the
[46:40] scripture praise the Lord now
[46:44] um uh tides of the people according to
[46:47] the law that is of their Brethren praise
[46:51] the Lord though they come out of the
[46:54] loins of Abraham
[46:56] they are just as much Christian as you
[46:58] are but yet they turn around and they
[47:00] pay tithes to you right in the as a
[47:03] representative of God
[47:06] but who he he who's this sentence not
[47:09] counted from them receive tithes of
[47:12] Abraham and blessed him that had the
[47:15] promises
[47:16] is showing that God didn't have to
[47:19] receive no tithes he don't need anything
[47:22] he owns the whole world but he was
[47:25] showing you an example of what you are
[47:27] supposed to do
[47:29] whatever believer is supposed to do
[47:31] because you see type Abraham is the
[47:35] father of the faithful
[47:37] and the father
[47:40] paid tithes to Melchizedek is that right
[47:45] and now uh you say oh I I have faith I
[47:51] believe God right now if you believe God
[47:54] and you are or believe you are a son or
[47:58] a daughter of God and that you like Levi
[48:02] paid times when he was Abraham
[48:05] representatively right he was in Abraham
[48:09] so when Abraham paid tithes it shows
[48:13] Levi who's coming after him that
[48:15] believes like he believes will also pay
[48:17] tithes
[48:19] and if then a person does not pay times
[48:23] they're really showing their real origin
[48:26] they didn't come from the loins of
[48:28] Abraham they come from somewhere else
[48:30] but not from Abraham
[48:33] now of course I'll speak and expand a
[48:36] little more just that now without all
[48:40] contradiction the less is blessed of the
[48:42] better here men that die receive tithes
[48:46] but there he receiveth them of whom it
[48:51] is witness he liveth as I may also say
[48:54] Levi who received times bad times
[48:57] in Abraham while he was unborn and yet
[49:01] in Abraham praise the Lord for for he
[49:05] was yet in the lines of his father
[49:09] when Melchizedek met him praise the Lord
[49:13] okay I'll stop there and I'll go this
[49:16] way now this subject might be a bit
[49:18] controversial and most pastors don't
[49:21] like speaking on it because the devil is
[49:24] such a cunning person that he'll Twisted
[49:28] the wrong and make it seem like the
[49:30] pastor is preaching on that because he
[49:32] wants to receive and let me I'll talk
[49:34] plainly with you is that okay
[49:37] or he wants to receive all this money
[49:40] so so so he's going to break John tines
[49:43] to stir up everybody to really give so
[49:46] that he could get uh like that so it
[49:51] becomes a controversial and touchy
[49:53] subject that most pastors don't want to
[49:57] give on it but thank God
[50:01] I'm retiring at the end of the year
[50:05] so you understand I am not saying it
[50:09] here now because I want to get anything
[50:12] from anybody and even when I was not
[50:15] retiring I did not have I never have had
[50:19] any motive like that from since I was
[50:22] Teenage
[50:24] to this very day and time
[50:26] never
[50:28] praise the Lord
[50:33] now this person asked brother Branham a
[50:37] question
[50:38] and if you listen and if you're
[50:41] spiritual you can catch what is unspoken
[50:44] and what is behind the question listen
[50:48] brother Branham
[50:50] should a person pay tithes to an
[50:53] individual
[50:56] or should that Christian work
[51:02] you understand really brother Brown
[51:05] didn't break that down he just
[51:08] the question came and then he started
[51:10] answering it but the point is this
[51:13] person is really maybe looking at their
[51:16] pastor and saying why should I be paying
[51:19] tithes to an individual why don't he go
[51:22] out and find a job like me
[51:24] see how hard I work and all he does on a
[51:27] Sunday is get in the Pulpit preach for
[51:31] about a hour and come down
[51:36] and then he's got paid all these tides
[51:38] my goodness I wish I could be a preacher
[51:42] myself and that's the reason why we have
[51:44] all these copycats and impersonators
[51:47] that God didn't call they went but they
[51:50] weren't sent they're not armed with the
[51:53] word of God they're not armed with the
[51:55] things of the message of the defeat the
[51:58] Devil in every turn he takes amen but
[52:01] praise the Lord a true man of God will
[52:03] stand by the word of God Amen
[52:06] brother Brandon is answering now sure he
[52:10] should
[52:11] and one man that will work
[52:15] will be a Christian any man that's a
[52:18] Christian will work
[52:20] did you hear that
[52:22] listen praise the Lord now but the other
[52:25] part pay tithes to an individual
[52:28] it depends on who the individual is
[52:32] because in Hebrews 7 the first time
[52:36] Tidings were ever talked about
[52:39] or pain wait a minute see now in Hebrews
[52:45] 7 chapter Abraham returning from the
[52:48] slaughter of Kings met Melchizedek
[52:51] and paired him a tide that was
[52:56] Melchizedek king of Salem
[52:59] which was no body
[53:03] but God himself
[53:06] amen you believe that
[53:07] amen was nobody but God himself praise
[53:12] the Lord see oh praise God now let me
[53:17] back up a bit the Bible says Abraham
[53:20] paid tithes to Melchizedek
[53:23] first time this was ever done or talked
[53:28] about in the Bible praise the Lord now
[53:32] you got to remember Abraham paid tithes
[53:35] before the law amen and this will
[53:39] pertain well we've had some people many
[53:42] years ago not now left the church
[53:45] because they don't believe that tithing
[53:48] is a new testament teaching it's all
[53:50] Testament and that's passed away so we
[53:53] don't have to tithe anymore
[53:55] and we can keep our money for ourselves
[53:58] and just Prosper like that you see but
[54:02] listen
[54:04] Abraham didn't fit tights under the law
[54:09] Abraham peptides by revelation
[54:14] uh brother Branham said it somewhere
[54:17] else on a quote where he said Abraham
[54:20] paid Ties on the grace
[54:24] and I understand that because what he's
[54:26] saying is revelation is by Grace you
[54:29] don't make it up or you don't go and
[54:31] study together it comes by grace
[54:35] so when Abraham paid by Revelation he
[54:39] was paying tithes on the grace
[54:42] praise the Lord which he says brother
[54:45] Branham is saying it here before the law
[54:49] before the law even existed or Moses was
[54:52] even on the scene Abraham paid tithes so
[54:57] paying ties was even before the law in
[55:00] other words it's got nothing to do with
[55:02] the Old Testament and all them laws and
[55:05] things that God gave to to the people he
[55:08] gave it to them because they wanted it
[55:11] and they needed it
[55:12] Hallelujah but the true belief of
[55:15] prefigured by Abraham doesn't need laws
[55:19] doesn't need none of those things all
[55:21] they need is the Revelation and the
[55:24] direction of the Holy Spirit of what to
[55:27] do how to act and then they act upon
[55:30] that word that God has placed within
[55:32] their own heart
[55:34] so we are not a people of law and
[55:37] Abraham paid it under uh the Covenant of
[55:41] Grace
[55:42] amen hallelujah and he baptized praise
[55:46] the Lord and thank God for that amen so
[55:51] we understand that it's all by
[55:53] Revelation through the holy spirit
[55:57] amen now
[55:59] when you pay tithes
[56:03] really you all tidings
[56:07] but the place where you get your food
[56:12] where you get your spiritual food that's
[56:15] where you owe your Tides that's where
[56:17] you ought to pay your tithes is that
[56:20] right praise the name of the Lord
[56:22] hallelujah many of you know I've used
[56:25] the illustration many times that
[56:27] something that the Lord placed in my
[56:29] heart and I just say it now you don't go
[56:32] like last night was the uh birth the
[56:35] birth day of my
[56:38] um my uh
[56:39] granddaughter and so uh the mother and
[56:43] dad took her out and they invited us
[56:46] when we turned up it was a surprise to
[56:48] her right and we we had a wonderful
[56:52] spread I know you would have liked to be
[56:54] there but you couldn't but anyway it was
[56:57] marvelous ice cream everything else you
[56:59] think mixed into it and we really
[57:01] enjoyed it and when it was all over
[57:06] I noticed the dad left
[57:09] and went to the front and and there he
[57:13] paid
[57:14] and they're wondering well why is he
[57:16] paying at this restaurant
[57:18] I know he likes the other restaurant up
[57:21] the road that why didn't he go over
[57:23] there and pay
[57:25] but you see that's what a lot of
[57:27] Christians do
[57:28] they received their food under the
[57:30] ministry of one pastor and one Church
[57:34] and uh when they their Joy is a real
[57:37] blessing and everything else and then
[57:39] they leave and they go to another
[57:42] restaurant that they admire and go pay
[57:44] over there
[57:46] means of the year
[57:49] but you know what even the cops the
[57:53] police would come and arrest you for
[57:54] doing that
[57:55] because it's not even naturally right
[57:58] much less for you to do something like
[58:00] that spiritually right absolutely wrong
[58:04] and you're guilty if you do anything
[58:06] like that praise the Lord hallelujah but
[58:11] I'm a pastor I'm a pastor I don't really
[58:14] have to pay tithes where you heard that
[58:16] every believer ought to peptides
[58:21] every minister in here and anywhere else
[58:24] Let Me Maybe hearing me or the bad times
[58:28] say but I don't see where the pastor
[58:30] paid times I don't see where this one
[58:32] Faith times I don't know you see they
[58:35] must spare time
[58:37] Hallelujah we'll touch on that later but
[58:40] the point of it is they must do it like
[58:42] anybody else every Christian has to do
[58:45] that amen I'm okay but many times the
[58:49] pastor doesn't put back his ties in the
[58:51] church so that they will go around and
[58:53] come back to him
[58:54] you see sometimes he has to go send it
[58:57] off to missionaries sometimes you go
[59:00] send it off to help voice to God or you
[59:02] send it here where he knows there is a
[59:04] need and you don't know anything about
[59:06] that or something happens somewhere
[59:09] constantly doing that but he has to pay
[59:12] tithes and he must be tights and any
[59:15] minister of men of God must baptized and
[59:18] if he's not doing that he is guilty in
[59:22] the presence of almighty God for we must
[59:24] pay days according to the word which the
[59:27] Bible says where the Prophet says where
[59:30] you all tied things
[59:32] is where you get your food bring you all
[59:36] the tithes into my store I'll say it the
[59:39] Lord Malachi praise the Lord you believe
[59:42] that
[59:43] [Applause]
[59:44] amen and prove me
[59:48] hallelujah praise the Lord the fact that
[59:51] God is saying prove me that just tells
[59:53] you already you know some people gonna
[59:54] doubt some people are going to question
[59:57] some people are going to wonder but he
[59:59] said well okay you don't believe me
[1:00:02] prove me
[1:00:03] prove me and Truth
[1:00:09] I'm paying your times you're not really
[1:00:12] trying him improving him you may pay
[1:00:14] your tithes and you think by paying your
[1:00:16] tithes you are God is obligated to you
[1:00:18] God is not obligated to nobody
[1:00:21] he's not obligated to you you're going
[1:00:23] to give him the world give him back to
[1:00:25] him what is already his own amen and
[1:00:28] then tell him that he's got an
[1:00:30] obligation you know there are people
[1:00:32] like that they give you things they give
[1:00:34] you gifts uh to bring you under a state
[1:00:37] of obligation to them praise the Lord
[1:00:40] the True Believer doesn't get to those
[1:00:43] positions where they obligated like that
[1:00:46] and God is not obligated to not answer
[1:00:49] one of your prayers God is not obligated
[1:00:52] to heal you or do nothing if he doesn't
[1:00:56] want to he knows our times he knows
[1:00:59] where he wants us to be he knows what he
[1:01:02] wants us to do all we
[1:01:04] ought to do is trust him and follow
[1:01:07] don't try to sink out figure out and
[1:01:10] analyze and all these minor things in
[1:01:13] your in your mortal mind your mind but
[1:01:16] trust the word of God that he will make
[1:01:19] all things well Hallelujah that's how
[1:01:22] you got to trust him without obligation
[1:01:25] trusting God Amen praise God prove me if
[1:01:31] I will not open the windows of heaven
[1:01:33] and pour out a blessing that you would
[1:01:37] not have room enough to receive it
[1:01:39] oh my God but I bet my times and this
[1:01:43] didn't happen I paid my ties and that
[1:01:45] didn't happen I paid my tithes and I
[1:01:47] prayed and I prayed and I prayed and
[1:01:49] this didn't happen it's not based on
[1:01:51] that it's based on the Revelation you
[1:01:54] have in your heart when you pay those
[1:01:56] eyes
[1:01:57] because God is seeing your motives and
[1:02:00] your intents in your of your heart you
[1:02:03] you give it and you let it go it's not
[1:02:05] even your tithes anymore because it's
[1:02:08] not yours it's his
[1:02:11] and even what you earn what you work for
[1:02:13] is not even yours it's his
[1:02:15] because he let you get it amen he let
[1:02:18] you get a job you let you get the help
[1:02:20] to go to the job he let you have a car
[1:02:22] to go to the job he let you have the
[1:02:24] boss you have he loves eat let it all
[1:02:26] happen and you ought to give him praise
[1:02:29] and honor and Glory
[1:02:32] Hallelujah
[1:02:34] amen
[1:02:36] prove me that I won't open the windows
[1:02:39] of heaven and pour out a blessing you
[1:02:41] would not have room enough to receive it
[1:02:45] amen praise the Lord Amen brother
[1:02:48] Brandon says here I challenge any man or
[1:02:52] woman that is not a Thai spear to to
[1:02:57] accept that and believe it and they'll
[1:03:00] see the hand of God but you end up being
[1:03:03] in debt and you come out from one
[1:03:05] hearing another one you know you're in
[1:03:07] debt all I mean you're wondering why
[1:03:09] some people don't pay their tithes and
[1:03:12] what happened see I'm not going to pay
[1:03:14] my ties I got to fix my car I gotta do
[1:03:16] this I gotta do that okay you do that
[1:03:18] and you keep the dive and the car get
[1:03:21] fixed and you go out with it in a week
[1:03:23] or two or even a month the same car
[1:03:25] breaks down and then you you go out and
[1:03:28] you have to pay more money than the
[1:03:30] tithes that you should have paid to go
[1:03:32] fix the same car or maybe you get sick
[1:03:35] and it takes you more money than the
[1:03:37] tithes that you robbed from God Amen now
[1:03:41] listen
[1:03:43] think of it
[1:03:46] I was just as loyally speaking of
[1:03:49] himself as I could be and I paid my
[1:03:52] tithes
[1:03:53] when I took my own money from the church
[1:03:57] here
[1:03:58] I paid my times
[1:04:00] or when I heard them campaigns
[1:04:04] you see
[1:04:06] I gave my tents
[1:04:09] oh my the campaigns grew now we're
[1:04:13] talking about thousands and thousands of
[1:04:16] people now all right from his little
[1:04:18] Church of maybe 200 people or so it's
[1:04:22] gone up to thousands of people many of
[1:04:25] them
[1:04:27] multi-millionaires in there he said I
[1:04:31] give he's kept giving his stance he says
[1:04:34] then you see it got to a place where I
[1:04:39] take it and have to give it out to other
[1:04:42] ministers to help them and gave out the
[1:04:46] rest of it to them whenever when that
[1:04:49] got much more I couldn't even do that
[1:04:52] now you're listening to me now because
[1:04:55] now we're talking multi-multi-millions
[1:04:57] coming in right and he's saying it got
[1:05:01] to when I couldn't even do that right
[1:05:03] when the then the thing I did from then
[1:05:08] on I kept 10 for myself and I gave them
[1:05:14] 90 to God
[1:05:17] is that right
[1:05:19] I kept the 10 for myself and I gave the
[1:05:23] 90 to God oh my when I did that oh the
[1:05:30] Lord came to me and told me you can't do
[1:05:32] that you have to take it that's so they
[1:05:36] can tax it what they were worried about
[1:05:39] I'm talking about the law now or the
[1:05:41] government is that he's getting all this
[1:05:43] tithing and he's giving it all away
[1:05:46] and he's given it to other ministers
[1:05:49] he's sending it overseas and only taken
[1:05:52] at that time a hundred dollars a week
[1:05:54] you couldn't live on that maybe for a
[1:05:57] day or two on that anyway but the fact
[1:06:00] is he was giving it all away and all the
[1:06:03] all of the taxes he had to pay was on
[1:06:06] 100 a week
[1:06:09] so instead of admiring a man like that
[1:06:14] they they were going the fact that
[1:06:16] they're losing out on all these millions
[1:06:19] of dollars they're not getting any taxes
[1:06:21] they say you must take it where's that
[1:06:23] in the law with the law forcing you to
[1:06:26] take money from somebody else I never
[1:06:29] asked the people for anything they just
[1:06:31] decide to give it right praise the Lord
[1:06:34] and so I couldn't do that see I you see
[1:06:39] my it was all to be charged he said here
[1:06:43] to it then I had to look for a way to
[1:06:49] bypass that
[1:06:51] Brother Brad now
[1:06:54] the Government tried to tax all those
[1:06:58] millions of dollars that were coming in
[1:07:01] and he says okay he didn't say okay sir
[1:07:03] I'll I'll just uh 10 90 or whatever and
[1:07:08] we'll just give it no he said before I
[1:07:12] do that I began to talk with the
[1:07:15] brothers and I had to and bypass it try
[1:07:20] to bypass doing that and place it into
[1:07:24] foreign missions
[1:07:27] he began to pour it out into foreign
[1:07:30] missions and so forth there may be other
[1:07:34] ideas praise the Lord and then out of
[1:07:39] that whatever went to the church I took
[1:07:43] only 100 a week
[1:07:46] so that I could pay my tithes only on
[1:07:50] that
[1:07:52] my brother Branagh why would he think of
[1:07:57] a way around the taxes right but you
[1:08:00] under you got to understand that money
[1:08:02] is really God's and he knows that that's
[1:08:05] Satan behind those governments which and
[1:08:08] you're supposed to pay your taxes and
[1:08:11] they're trying to get every bit of tax
[1:08:13] they can from you every set that can
[1:08:16] squeeze out of you
[1:08:18] but you also have the right if you can
[1:08:21] to bypass it or get around it to keep as
[1:08:25] much as you can
[1:08:27] so that you can give as much as you can
[1:08:29] and that God's kingdom could expand and
[1:08:32] be glorified amen we're not talking
[1:08:35] about stealing we're not talking about
[1:08:37] withholding from the government what is
[1:08:39] due to them but we're talking that as uh
[1:08:44] one that is wise to look at whatever is
[1:08:47] coming in to you and you do what God in
[1:08:51] this world tell you pay your tithe amen
[1:08:54] pay your tithes and you you pay your
[1:08:57] tithes and let God have the glory I want
[1:08:59] to go on expanding on that praise the
[1:09:01] Lord hallelujah amen oh my you say oh
[1:09:07] uh I believe yes sir I tell you I truly
[1:09:12] believe in paying tithes how many air
[1:09:15] believes in pain ties praise the Lord I
[1:09:18] don't ask for sure hands but a show of
[1:09:19] hearts
[1:09:20] praise the Lord
[1:09:22] raising hands could be a disguise and
[1:09:26] still you're not paying tax so I don't
[1:09:27] know it's between you and God praise the
[1:09:30] Lord
[1:09:32] yes sir I believe in pain tides it's one
[1:09:36] of God's
[1:09:41] big Cardinal thieving uh ministers
[1:09:45] thinking of itself I've messed up the
[1:09:48] whole thing
[1:09:49] until every Minister that uh people come
[1:09:53] in contact with they believe that that
[1:09:55] is their aim and their goal and the
[1:09:59] foundation of their ministry right and
[1:10:01] so they don't trust ministers and you
[1:10:03] can't blame those people but the word
[1:10:05] still stands true it don't change
[1:10:08] regardless of how men act or what men do
[1:10:12] the word doesn't change it Remains the
[1:10:14] Same
[1:10:15] hallelujah amen now that is it we must
[1:10:20] understand that some will even come and
[1:10:23] say and some have said it to me before I
[1:10:26] even read this years ago well I I don't
[1:10:30] keep that because that's of the Old
[1:10:32] Testament
[1:10:33] he said I'm here to tell you it is of
[1:10:36] the New Testament also yes sir it is
[1:10:41] praise the Lord hallelujah praise God
[1:10:45] another question
[1:10:47] would it be wrong brother brannerman to
[1:10:51] use my times on church building funds
[1:10:57] now back of that think about it
[1:11:00] this person
[1:11:01] God maybe bless them in a wonderful way
[1:11:04] and maybe like if they used to give
[1:11:07] to the tithings fifty dollars a week
[1:11:10] twenty dollars a week all of a sudden
[1:11:13] they get blessed with an inheritance
[1:11:16] two or three million
[1:11:19] and the tidings got to be thirty forty
[1:11:22] thousand fifty thousand sixty thousand
[1:11:25] seventy eighty a hundred thousand oh
[1:11:27] that's too much to give to an individual
[1:11:31] I can't give him or her that the the
[1:11:35] that person is going to get rich that
[1:11:38] person going to be able to have this or
[1:11:40] they're going to have that that's behind
[1:11:42] this thought this person is asking here
[1:11:44] would it be wrong in other words they're
[1:11:47] trying to
[1:11:48] bypass the minister
[1:11:52] and give that tithings and justify it in
[1:11:55] their heart that they're doing God's
[1:11:57] work by giving it to the building funds
[1:12:01] but he's not getting my tights
[1:12:04] that's really what's behind this right
[1:12:07] oh my think of it would it be wrong to
[1:12:11] use tights on church building funds oh
[1:12:15] my here's a touchy one
[1:12:17] I know he saw what I just said but he
[1:12:21] want to speak openly like that
[1:12:23] no a touchy thing for the church now
[1:12:29] correctly
[1:12:30] science is to go to the minister
[1:12:37] that's right in the Bible
[1:12:39] for in the Bible they had a box that
[1:12:43] they set at the door in the Old
[1:12:45] Testament the building
[1:12:47] the box was the fund where the people
[1:12:51] put in for repairing and those sorts of
[1:12:55] things you've read it many times in the
[1:12:57] Old Testament how they upkeep the
[1:12:59] buildings and things like that and all
[1:13:01] the repairs were to be taken out of that
[1:13:05] amen now we have a box out there too but
[1:13:09] we have it separated where the people
[1:13:13] will pay their tithes into the tight box
[1:13:16] and they'll give their offerings into
[1:13:20] the offering a slot that's on that box
[1:13:24] now he's telling you what it is for the
[1:13:27] times is not considered no matter how
[1:13:31] much it is
[1:13:32] to go for repairing buildings and fixing
[1:13:35] things it's to go to that minister
[1:13:39] remember I'm saying all these things
[1:13:40] because I am going
[1:13:42] and I got to preach the word what God
[1:13:46] gave to me praise the Lord see that
[1:13:50] Tidings belongs to that minister
[1:13:52] and what is Place us offering is to go
[1:13:57] for the repair the upkeep uh the the
[1:14:01] um
[1:14:02] declarations everything else of the
[1:14:04] building
[1:14:05] if you have a mortgage it's not going to
[1:14:07] help to the mortgage payment of the
[1:14:09] building
[1:14:10] is that right
[1:14:11] praise the Lord that's what it is now
[1:14:14] for myself as a minister the types come
[1:14:17] to me praise the Lord but this church
[1:14:19] has ever been set up that way because
[1:14:21] since I was a young teenager and started
[1:14:24] to preach I saw that the only nobody
[1:14:28] ever told me this but I saw it amongst
[1:14:30] all the preachers
[1:14:34] all the preachers
[1:14:36] Billy Graham
[1:14:38] was the only one I knew at that time
[1:14:41] never had any problems with the law or
[1:14:44] the government
[1:14:46] and the reason why is because
[1:14:51] he they received the monies but he only
[1:14:55] took a salary
[1:14:57] and then if he had a problem and he
[1:15:00] needed to go and use out of his his
[1:15:03] tithings then he went to news out of it
[1:15:05] as much as he wanted
[1:15:06] if he needed it he used it but other
[1:15:09] than that he took a salary that is
[1:15:12] exactly what I've done through all these
[1:15:14] years
[1:15:15] it just took a salary so when
[1:15:19] um we account to the government on don't
[1:15:22] think his brother Mike does the
[1:15:24] accounting we have outside accountants
[1:15:26] that go over everything that he did that
[1:15:29] I did whatever they go over it because
[1:15:33] their name is on the line now they gotta
[1:15:35] present that and that's got to go to the
[1:15:37] government and so they go over that and
[1:15:39] so far all these years never
[1:15:44] never had a problem nothing whatsoever
[1:15:47] not a smell because I am not around for
[1:15:51] that the men have been set in position
[1:15:53] that they will do the counting and not
[1:15:56] one person doing it several are there
[1:15:59] and they do the counting they do the
[1:16:02] banking and I am not even near to it
[1:16:06] amen they just know to issue me my
[1:16:11] salary at this certain set time they
[1:16:14] issue my salary praise the Lord
[1:16:16] hallelujah but remember the tides are
[1:16:19] still mine when I need to use it our
[1:16:22] problem Rises up for private personal
[1:16:25] problem and I need to use it that's what
[1:16:27] it's there for then I can go in and say
[1:16:30] uh brother Mike or brother so-and-so uh
[1:16:33] write this check for I need it I need to
[1:16:35] do something I don't even have to tell
[1:16:37] them what I need it for because that's
[1:16:39] my my private uh funds if you want to
[1:16:42] put it that way for the glory of God I'm
[1:16:45] telling you what's in the Bible what the
[1:16:48] prophet said and I'm telling you from my
[1:16:50] personal private experience of handling
[1:16:54] God's tithings
[1:16:56] then sometimes the offerings in the
[1:17:00] church if it's not enough and there's a
[1:17:03] problem that's necessary there needed
[1:17:05] then I will dip into the tithes and turn
[1:17:09] around and give it back to to be used
[1:17:11] for the glory of God to help the church
[1:17:15] but I don't do that all the time so that
[1:17:18] the church become dependent on me
[1:17:21] and that my influence on the church will
[1:17:23] be because the church is obligated to me
[1:17:26] through my assistance to the church with
[1:17:29] either no praise the Lord but if there
[1:17:32] comes up a situation where it's
[1:17:33] necessary doesn't matter how many
[1:17:36] thousands there just give it God will
[1:17:38] God knows what he's doing praise the
[1:17:41] Lord our ministers passing through
[1:17:45] ministers pass through and sometimes the
[1:17:48] church may not have enough to be able to
[1:17:51] deal with one two three pass in a row
[1:17:53] and maybe one and and then can wait for
[1:17:57] another and then deal with another one
[1:17:59] but if they come like that and they have
[1:18:01] to be dealt with sometimes
[1:18:03] I do that and I'm not doing that to put
[1:18:06] feathers in my cap here I'm not a chief
[1:18:08] or something like that but um do you do
[1:18:11] that for the glory of God you don't even
[1:18:13] think about it because in your heart you
[1:18:16] want to do these things from God's glory
[1:18:19] amen praise the Lord so now you you
[1:18:23] getting a little idea of what this
[1:18:26] business of tithing is about it's not
[1:18:29] some man-made trumped up cause that
[1:18:33] somebody worked up somewhere this was
[1:18:35] before Moses this was before this came
[1:18:39] from through Abraham praise the Lord oh
[1:18:42] praise God now let me move on because
[1:18:45] these things can be expanded on but the
[1:18:47] spiritual men here praise the Lord now
[1:18:52] so you see they give and what they give
[1:18:56] kept up the buildings repairs on the
[1:18:59] buildings were taken care of out of that
[1:19:02] amen you see but remember that tent
[1:19:06] all of all Tidings went to the priests
[1:19:10] in other words he says to their pastors
[1:19:14] see yes tithings are to go for nothing
[1:19:19] else
[1:19:21] did you get that
[1:19:22] praise the Lord amen I'm glad you're
[1:19:26] thinking when you start getting quite
[1:19:27] like that you're thinking that's good
[1:19:29] praise the Lord
[1:19:31] oh now I know there are some people take
[1:19:37] their tithes and give them to some old
[1:19:40] widow woman
[1:19:42] I'm telling you that is wrong
[1:19:46] let me say that again
[1:19:49] I know people who take the tithes and
[1:19:53] give them
[1:19:54] to some old widow woman that is wrong
[1:20:01] if you've got anything to give to that
[1:20:04] widow woman give her
[1:20:07] but don't you give her God's money
[1:20:11] that's not yours in the first place
[1:20:15] because you're giving somebody else's
[1:20:18] money amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:20:21] now in this church the policy is and let
[1:20:25] me make it clear now
[1:20:27] if something comes up you have a problem
[1:20:30] you have a great need not every little
[1:20:32] problem come up you run to the Deacon or
[1:20:35] you run to the pastor uh as if they're a
[1:20:38] spare tire on a car and when the wheel
[1:20:41] gets punctured you run to the pass you
[1:20:44] run to this and you don't have the
[1:20:46] pressure to pray
[1:20:48] you don't have the pressure to believe
[1:20:50] you you use them as a place where you
[1:20:54] can let off your pressure or I'll get it
[1:20:56] from the church sure I'll get it from
[1:20:58] over here no our focus should be on
[1:21:01] believing God and his word
[1:21:04] amen you have not Jesus said because you
[1:21:07] ask not you have not you don't believe
[1:21:09] you don't really believe you're talking
[1:21:11] about your mouth but you're not as we
[1:21:13] say you're not putting your money where
[1:21:16] your mouth is right you've got to do
[1:21:19] that praise the Lord you place it where
[1:21:21] you get your spiritual food amen praise
[1:21:25] the name of the Lord now you understand
[1:21:27] that uh and let me say this that widows
[1:21:31] especially it touches your heart
[1:21:34] somebody's husband passed away
[1:21:38] and leave them behind and you have to
[1:21:41] struggle through life right uh and it
[1:21:44] touches your heart
[1:21:45] but there are some widows
[1:21:48] that will deliberate deliberately try to
[1:21:52] plan your Heartstrings
[1:21:54] so that you will give and give and give
[1:21:59] and support them
[1:22:00] listen what brother Branham says here
[1:22:03] now you see
[1:22:06] my if you do that that is not yours that
[1:22:11] is God's Hallelujah now we set it up
[1:22:14] here so that you have those needs talk
[1:22:17] to your deacon
[1:22:20] Peter and Paul on them set it up that if
[1:22:23] there is a problem in the congregation
[1:22:25] or your problems that you tried your
[1:22:28] best and you can't handle go to the
[1:22:30] deacon
[1:22:31] talk to the Deacons
[1:22:34] oh well I don't want to tell anybody my
[1:22:36] business well
[1:22:37] then you don't really need help you just
[1:22:40] go ahead people want to want always to
[1:22:44] be prayed for sickness even to the
[1:22:46] pastor individually but they don't want
[1:22:48] to tell him what is the sickness so
[1:22:51] what's he going to pray for and just
[1:22:53] pray like that now I'm going off here
[1:22:56] but those are just things little little
[1:22:58] things a pastor meets in his lifetime
[1:23:01] this is a secret this is a private this
[1:23:04] is a not to if you're talking to the man
[1:23:07] of God if you're talking to all the
[1:23:10] people and you're going to shout it from
[1:23:11] the house stop that's another matter but
[1:23:13] you're talking to the man of God you and
[1:23:15] the secret thing this this what secret
[1:23:18] what are you talking about to the serve
[1:23:20] the true sermon now amen is a different
[1:23:23] mother praise God hallelujah yes see why
[1:23:29] we said it that way
[1:23:30] is because you have these Spirits moving
[1:23:34] amongst the people constantly
[1:23:37] is that right
[1:23:38] now just pass over this you got foxy
[1:23:43] spirits
[1:23:44] right will sit in any congregation
[1:23:48] cunning smart
[1:23:51] you got snakes
[1:23:54] spiritually
[1:23:56] oh they know how to twist turn and
[1:23:59] everything else like that
[1:24:01] you got all these Spirits moving in the
[1:24:04] church
[1:24:05] right and they will try to coil put
[1:24:08] their coils around you especially when
[1:24:10] it's a young believer that hasn't
[1:24:12] matured enough to be able to have the
[1:24:14] spiritual strength discernment and the
[1:24:16] power of God that says no go to the
[1:24:19] deacon see they don't want to come
[1:24:21] straight to the Deacon or the pastor
[1:24:23] because they know they're going to be
[1:24:24] discerned
[1:24:26] and they know they want to stay in the
[1:24:28] darkness they don't want to come to the
[1:24:30] light all right and so they want to move
[1:24:33] like that within the congregation so
[1:24:36] that they can avoid detection
[1:24:39] and one that it's detected brother
[1:24:42] Brandon said you know like rats like
[1:24:44] roaches he says creatures of the night
[1:24:46] will turn on the light they run and
[1:24:48] Scamper to find some corner to hide
[1:24:50] behind in like that amen but thank God
[1:24:53] we walk in the light
[1:24:55] as he is in the light and we have
[1:24:57] Fellowship one with another
[1:25:00] what you talking about people say oh but
[1:25:03] somewhere you talk like that listen if
[1:25:05] things get so bad that I really need
[1:25:08] some help amen or you need some help
[1:25:12] praise the Lord then I will either go to
[1:25:17] brother Mike or if God says no I want to
[1:25:21] bless this person talk to this person
[1:25:23] praise the Lord talk to them amen and oh
[1:25:28] brother I don't have it I only have this
[1:25:30] twenty dollars
[1:25:32] but that's what God wants to see the
[1:25:35] heart of that person and that twenty
[1:25:38] dollars they give that twenty dollars
[1:25:39] and say oh and I'm going to give my
[1:25:42] twenty dollars to him I'm gonna give my
[1:25:45] last piece of bread and my last piece of
[1:25:48] this mix that and give you to give that
[1:25:50] to the prophet and me and my son died no
[1:25:53] you see she God stretches you he knows
[1:25:55] how to stretch you and he does it for
[1:25:58] his glory and for his honor praise the
[1:26:01] Lord amen yes praise the name of the
[1:26:04] Lord
[1:26:05] now if you sent me downtown to buy you a
[1:26:09] loaf of bread
[1:26:11] and gave me 25 cents back then not 25
[1:26:15] cents now
[1:26:17] to get that loaf of bread
[1:26:19] and when I go down the street I met
[1:26:22] someone else right
[1:26:25] who asked me for money
[1:26:30] and I
[1:26:32] with the sympathies gave them the money
[1:26:35] you gave me to buy the loaf of bread
[1:26:39] see oh my then I have to give them my
[1:26:45] money
[1:26:46] I can't give them the money you gave me
[1:26:49] to buy a loaf of bread
[1:26:51] amen but this you see it's your money on
[1:26:56] a tenth
[1:26:57] which is what the word times means one
[1:27:01] tenth
[1:27:03] one tenth and Levi the priesthood or the
[1:27:09] pastor is
[1:27:11] supposed to live
[1:27:14] by that tenth
[1:27:18] the 10th is to be a tithing that's to be
[1:27:22] brought into the storehouse with a
[1:27:25] promise of God to bless it
[1:27:27] and the proof
[1:27:29] if you don't believe it prove me
[1:27:33] if I won't do it that's right Tidings
[1:27:36] goes into the church for the pastor
[1:27:41] and things that is separate a fund all
[1:27:46] together right that is scriptural praise
[1:27:50] the Lord then he begins to talk about
[1:27:52] himself
[1:27:53] I remember a time I was so sick when I
[1:27:57] was a boy I came out of the hospital
[1:27:59] owing about two thousand dollars
[1:28:03] and it used to be a drugstore
[1:28:05] I owed him about three or four hundred
[1:28:08] dollars medical bills
[1:28:11] he didn't even know me
[1:28:14] and there it was
[1:28:16] he sent a bill to me
[1:28:18] and I said
[1:28:21] Mr swaniger I owe you
[1:28:25] oh it was Mr Mason Duncan Court Avenue
[1:28:28] and Spring Street I'm just counting him
[1:28:30] here

[1:28:43] even though I'm still sick and weak
[1:28:47] but now I can't pay you
[1:28:51] I just become a Christian
[1:28:54] but miss first thing Mr Mason as my duty
[1:28:58] to God I owe him my tithes
[1:29:03] in other words

[1:29:09] tithes first

[1:29:15] righteousness and all other things will
[1:29:18] be added on to you do you believe it
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:23] see oh my so first I must pay my tithes
[1:29:29] and I want to pay him my tithes
[1:29:32] and my next Duty since I owe you is to
[1:29:37] pay all my debts
[1:29:39] amen I said my father is sickly
[1:29:44] there's ten more of us in that house
[1:29:48] and I he's still sick and I am trying to
[1:29:53] work
[1:29:55] to maintain all those younger ones
[1:29:59] along with the sick Daddy
[1:30:02] that was in that house
[1:30:04] if I can't pay you more than 25 cents on
[1:30:08] each payday if I can't even pay you that
[1:30:11] I'll make sure I come by and tell you
[1:30:15] that this week I can't pay you
[1:30:19] oh my
[1:30:20] and now by the help of God I want you to
[1:30:23] know I paid every bit of that off see
[1:30:28] praise God God bless that Prophet he's
[1:30:31] showing that he was done in the dumps
[1:30:34] like anybody else he went through debt
[1:30:37] crisis like anybody else
[1:30:40] friends I am not ashamed I've passed
[1:30:43] that way also by his grace many troubles
[1:30:46] and trails but God has brought us
[1:30:49] through to this hour I live from the day
[1:30:52] when the church used to take in two
[1:30:54] dollars
[1:30:56] then when it take to begin to take in a
[1:31:00] hundred and fifty dollars a month and I
[1:31:02] was rejoicing praise the Lord and God
[1:31:06] continued to bless and grow it until it
[1:31:09] comes to where it is now and we give him
[1:31:11] all the praise the honor and the glory
[1:31:13] and I want everybody to take their hand
[1:31:15] and do like this
[1:31:19] I can't come on top each one of you on
[1:31:21] the back and say God bless you but I'll
[1:31:23] let you do it for yourself God bless
[1:31:26] every one of you that are giving to
[1:31:28] support the work of God here in the
[1:31:30] house of the Lord
[1:31:35] Hallelujah
[1:31:37] now
[1:31:38] he stops to give an illustration about
[1:31:41] this debt crisis that goes on in the
[1:31:44] church let me back up a little bit and
[1:31:47] that's the reason why we don't believe
[1:31:50] in this church and always have that
[1:31:53] Believers need to go amongst one another
[1:31:56] and borrow from brother so and so over
[1:31:59] there
[1:32:00] secretly privately unknown to the pastor
[1:32:02] unknown to the Deacon uh borrow so much
[1:32:05] over there
[1:32:06] and then go over here also and borrow
[1:32:09] over there and bar over and have this
[1:32:12] network this web uh working like that in
[1:32:16] the church but if persons come like that
[1:32:19] and you say oh uh brother sister you you
[1:32:22] do have a need oh my goodness well you
[1:32:25] know what you ought to do why don't we
[1:32:28] just go and talk to brother Danny or
[1:32:30] brother Tim or brother Desmond or or
[1:32:32] let's go talk to the pastor
[1:32:35] most of the time you see that Spirit
[1:32:37] back right off
[1:32:39] you see if it's a real need it doesn't
[1:32:43] care it will come
[1:32:45] it will come but if that thing is not of
[1:32:49] God it'll back right off like that so
[1:32:52] we've never had that problem in the
[1:32:54] church this church any time for all
[1:32:57] these years of people going around
[1:32:59] amongst one another trying to borrow
[1:33:00] money here borrow money there and trying
[1:33:03] to play on your sympathies especially
[1:33:06] when you're a young Christian that
[1:33:08] matured yet they play on your heart
[1:33:11] strings like that uh God tells us not to
[1:33:15] be naive live by the word
[1:33:18] and the principles of the world are
[1:33:20] being laid out so live by that you see
[1:33:22] when you come out of that that's where
[1:33:24] Satan gets you but when you stay within
[1:33:26] the word he has a problem because he's
[1:33:29] going to be brought into the light and
[1:33:31] he doesn't like that lighting praise the
[1:33:33] Lord we'll touch him later praise God
[1:33:36] hallelujah amen you don't mind him not
[1:33:40] running here today I'm taking my time to
[1:33:44] to make sure I nail every nail in
[1:33:48] I don't want loose boards on the house
[1:33:51] and if life's lightest wind comes the
[1:33:54] boards start falling off no I want to
[1:33:57] clinch the nail bang bang and if you
[1:34:01] need something of them I'll hit you
[1:34:02] seven times
[1:34:04] with the word to make sure that nail
[1:34:07] holds amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:34:10] God Amen now there was a Christian at
[1:34:13] this church one time went out and got
[1:34:17] some work done on his car here
[1:34:20] no
[1:34:21] that man said I'll pay you he couldn't
[1:34:25] pay them he tells the mechanic I'll pay
[1:34:29] you when I get paid on Saturday are you
[1:34:32] listening to me close now praise the
[1:34:34] Lord
[1:34:35] and he never even paid him
[1:34:39] drive by the man's shop
[1:34:42] every time doesn't pay him
[1:34:45] weeks and after weeks and weeks Roll by
[1:34:48] still never bed him
[1:34:51] and also never even went and said a word
[1:34:56] do Christians do that
[1:34:59] well this question did that
[1:35:03] and even in this day
[1:35:05] people who claim to believe this message
[1:35:07] and believe the word still do that
[1:35:10] but they don't want nobody to know about
[1:35:12] it but God knows about it
[1:35:15] all right
[1:35:17] now know this
[1:35:19] until that mechanic that man that he
[1:35:23] owed the money to came to me
[1:35:27] that man came to Branham Tabernacle came
[1:35:30] and seized brother Branham and spoke to
[1:35:34] him praise the Lord now I'm not
[1:35:36] preaching about half hour silence
[1:35:39] I'm not preaching whether Redemption is
[1:35:41] over I'm not preaching on the mystery of
[1:35:45] iniquity or godliness and not preaching
[1:35:48] on 666 or some great subject like that
[1:35:52] that could get your mind caught up with
[1:35:54] you see no I'm bringing the word to you
[1:35:58] that you're not to just be spiritually
[1:36:01] high-minded
[1:36:03] and on Earth as we usually say you know
[1:36:06] Earthly good
[1:36:08] you're so high-minded that you know
[1:36:10] Earthly good
[1:36:11] you're so spiritual you can't even live
[1:36:14] and be practical by the word
[1:36:17] right so let's look at our lives in the
[1:36:20] light of the word praise the Lord
[1:36:22] Hallelujah no
[1:36:25] and he told me about it
[1:36:28] now I won't say it but it you see things
[1:36:31] like that reflects against the entire
[1:36:34] church
[1:36:35] is that right
[1:36:37] it reflects against the church
[1:36:40] it reflects against Christ himself
[1:36:43] because you're using his name that
[1:36:45] you're a Christian right oh my you can't
[1:36:50] pay him or pay them then go tell them
[1:36:55] say I owe you I'm going to pay you I am
[1:36:59] a Christian but I just can't do it right
[1:37:03] now I can't do it I all this I know I oh
[1:37:07] oh it it's not only on your books
[1:37:10] brother Brandon is saying no remember
[1:37:12] that death is also on God's books
[1:37:16] you know that I'm trying to offer myself
[1:37:20] and for all of us together try to be
[1:37:24] ready friends pay your debts we know we
[1:37:29] are getting near to something now very
[1:37:32] near something is about to take place
[1:37:36] and when it does we want to be ready
[1:37:40] Hallelujah let me put it I'm I'm talking
[1:37:43] now what is saying that don't try to use
[1:37:47] the Rapture as an escape from your debts
[1:37:54] I'm sorry but mine look at the word I
[1:37:56] see all these things he's telling you
[1:37:58] don't you wait and delay and delay to
[1:38:02] pay your debts and try to use the
[1:38:05] Rapture that the Rapture gonna take you
[1:38:06] out of here and and you're free from all
[1:38:09] your debts and and like that he says no
[1:38:12] doesn't work that way God got it on his
[1:38:14] books too
[1:38:16] amen see oh my so we all want to be
[1:38:20] ready for the coming of the Lord is
[1:38:23] drawing nigh and we want to be ready for
[1:38:26] that great hour is that right we don't
[1:38:30] want to think if we want to think
[1:38:31] pentecostally you're trying to go up and
[1:38:34] rise in the Rapture and a bag of some
[1:38:37] death hang on one foot and you can't go
[1:38:40] up because the weight got you held down
[1:38:42] to the ground here on Earthly things no
[1:38:46] it doesn't work that way we must pay our
[1:38:49] debts now listen I'm not talking to an
[1:38:52] individual because I don't know nothing
[1:38:54] about any individual in here I know you
[1:38:56] but I don't know anything about an
[1:38:58] individual and why God has let me speak
[1:39:01] this way is maybe he's stuck into some
[1:39:04] individual of our individuals you have
[1:39:06] got to find out that by yourself
[1:39:08] whenever you come to the Limit his limit
[1:39:11] of what he can take from you and what
[1:39:14] you're doing and he may be fixing to do
[1:39:18] something about it so before do that God
[1:39:21] doesn't do anything unless he first
[1:39:23] gives warning
[1:39:25] praise the Lord hallelujah amen
[1:39:29] now
[1:39:30] this is a solemn thing
[1:39:33] we should think on it for a little while
[1:39:36] how that Israel
[1:39:39] they're believed yes and yet when they
[1:39:43] got to the Waters of Nara we saw what
[1:39:48] they did we all Mara means bitterness
[1:39:51] and that speaks of every one of us have
[1:39:54] got to go through the bitterness of life
[1:39:57] and this life we live on earth there's a
[1:40:00] lot of bitterness sometimes that we come
[1:40:02] across
[1:40:04] we can't stand the bitterness
[1:40:06] we can't stand sometimes the bitter
[1:40:09] medicines of that we have to take from
[1:40:12] the great physician well we want to spit
[1:40:14] it out we don't want to take it in we're
[1:40:17] going to face the bitterness of life but
[1:40:20] listen just the answer is still the same
[1:40:22] Moses took a a branch of a tree and
[1:40:26] threw it into the waters and the Bible
[1:40:29] says the water becomes sweet the bitter
[1:40:32] Waters become sweet out of your trials
[1:40:35] God can have triumphed out of your
[1:40:39] bitterness God can make sweetness
[1:40:42] God can have a testimony praise the Lord
[1:40:45] for without a test or without test you
[1:40:48] can't have a test the money praise the
[1:40:52] Lord your test is money in God's bank
[1:40:54] and God begins to bless you and pay it
[1:40:57] out in another way we're going to trust
[1:41:00] him and believe him forever promise that
[1:41:03] he made within his word
[1:41:05] praise the name of the Lord glory to God
[1:41:09] hallelujah amen so there at Mara before
[1:41:15] them
[1:41:17] and they have to pass through also the
[1:41:21] Wilderness of sin
[1:41:24] praise God that's them naturally but the
[1:41:27] spirit of God is telling us we all pass
[1:41:30] through that way we got to pass through
[1:41:33] that way of the Wilderness of sin we
[1:41:36] pass through that way and we make
[1:41:38] mistakes we stumble we fall we do all
[1:41:41] manner of things amen but you don't keep
[1:41:45] on the ground crying for somebody to
[1:41:48] come and wrap your knees no you rise and
[1:41:52] try again said the prophet of God Amen
[1:41:55] Hallelujah you rise up and you try again
[1:41:58] how's a child going to learn to walk if
[1:42:00] when they fall on the ground they don't
[1:42:02] try again to get up and start trying to
[1:42:04] walk again and the same it is in a
[1:42:07] Christian walk to walk with God
[1:42:09] hallelujah amen there they walk me walk
[1:42:13] they walk through the windows of sin
[1:42:15] then on to Mount Sinai praise God we're
[1:42:20] going to hit some mountain tops is that
[1:42:23] right we're gonna hit some mountain tops
[1:42:25] and God bless you and you walk up there
[1:42:28] but the sister Johnson love to sing is
[1:42:32] God on the mountain yeah but then
[1:42:35] sometimes you got to go back down in the
[1:42:37] valley and that's where you need to
[1:42:39] trust him down in the valley to walk
[1:42:42] with your lord down in the valley of
[1:42:45] trails and Temptation down in the valley
[1:42:48] of deaths and creditors calling you on
[1:42:51] your phone and listen that down there
[1:42:54] trust him and believe him and believe
[1:42:57] his promises amen praise God and then
[1:43:01] after that that mountain tough
[1:43:03] experience they went on to kadish barnya
[1:43:08] where they have their doubts
[1:43:12] doubts
[1:43:13] deliberations wondering about that and
[1:43:17] that was just 11 days before the
[1:43:20] crossing he's telling us after he just
[1:43:23] spoke that look the coming of the Lord
[1:43:24] is drawing now now he's telling us 11
[1:43:26] days before the crossing he's telling
[1:43:28] you it's near to the Rapture now and you
[1:43:31] got all these things you have to pass
[1:43:32] through or maybe you already passed
[1:43:34] through some of them but you got to come
[1:43:37] true all amen you got to pass through
[1:43:40] all of it amen see they couldn't believe
[1:43:44] it after they had seen all those
[1:43:47] wonderful things amen and that's where
[1:43:51] Israel made its fatal mistake
[1:43:57] because right there the renounce Grace
[1:44:01] and accepted the law
[1:44:05] Hallelujah while Moses was leading them
[1:44:08] through the Wilderness with all the
[1:44:09] miracle signs wonders they were still
[1:44:11] under the grace that came from Abraham
[1:44:14] but then when they didn't even want to
[1:44:17] live by God's
[1:44:18] Unwritten word
[1:44:21] then he had to give them written word
[1:44:24] which he caused Moses to do on top of
[1:44:26] the mountain and they from then on they
[1:44:30] rely begin to rely on just the written
[1:44:33] word that they had and by doing that
[1:44:36] they renounced their renounce the grace
[1:44:40] and accepted the law
[1:44:42] and so is the modern Church the same
[1:44:45] thing when oh my goodness the the word
[1:44:49] the word the word is good you're saying
[1:44:51] the word but do you have a revelation of
[1:44:54] the word because that's where your faith
[1:44:56] should lie on Upon This Rock I'll build
[1:44:59] my church and the Gates of Hell will not
[1:45:02] Prevail against it it'll Prevail against
[1:45:04] the written word with the argumentation
[1:45:07] with analytics with all kinds of
[1:45:10] deliberations with all kinds of uh uh
[1:45:13] coming together of biblical conferences
[1:45:15] they will prevail against the written
[1:45:18] word but they can't Prevail against the
[1:45:21] unwritten word the logos of God
[1:45:23] revealing itself momentarily Moment by
[1:45:26] moment no anticipation of the devil he
[1:45:29] doesn't know what God is going to do God
[1:45:32] just reveals the word and the believer
[1:45:33] acts on the word
[1:45:36] hallelujah amen see there wasn't
[1:45:40] satisfied amen they didn't wasn't
[1:45:44] satisfied with the grace of God which he
[1:45:47] was showing to Abraham a complete Grace
[1:45:51] that provided a special lamb for him
[1:45:55] that he didn't even ask for Hallelujah a
[1:45:59] revelation you didn't know you didn't
[1:46:01] ask for whatever and God reveals it
[1:46:04] Grace Revelation comes by Grace it's not
[1:46:09] by study not by wisdom not by knowledge
[1:46:11] not by years oh I'm old I'm 70 years
[1:46:16] I've been in the message so it doesn't
[1:46:18] come by that you respect that that's
[1:46:20] wonderful but it comes by revelation
[1:46:24] hallelujah what are you talking about
[1:46:26] that I can't explain fully to you God
[1:46:29] has got to make that clear to you amen
[1:46:31] praise the name of the Lord amen see
[1:46:34] they it provided see as great
[1:46:37] sacrificial lamb the god provided them
[1:46:40] with a Revival there that was with Moses
[1:46:43] and they still wasn't satisfied with
[1:46:46] that they wanted something that they
[1:46:50] could literally see and argue about
[1:46:54] is that right and that's what we got
[1:46:56] here today
[1:46:57] right we got the message and they are
[1:46:59] arguing for scriptural points so if you
[1:47:01] want this and that and the other but
[1:47:03] once the Believers have begun to catch
[1:47:06] the revelation
[1:47:08] Isaiah's prophecy becomes fulfilled and
[1:47:11] it shall come to pass in those days when
[1:47:15] the word is revealed The Watchmen on the
[1:47:17] walls of Zion will see eye to eye
[1:47:23] amen
[1:47:25] see eye to eye because they can't see
[1:47:29] anything else the word is one
[1:47:32] the word is not the proliferation of
[1:47:34] ideas the word is one
[1:47:38] so when the Believers have caught the
[1:47:41] Revelation the true revelation of God
[1:47:44] they will automatically begin to say eye
[1:47:47] to eye
[1:47:49] it may not express it in the same way
[1:47:51] amen but they'll know that the person is
[1:47:55] saying the same thing that they already
[1:47:56] see and they already know they'll know
[1:47:58] it praise the name of the Lord
[1:48:00] notice
[1:48:02] them blessings come to Israel that is
[1:48:05] from church choosing law
[1:48:09] over Grace
[1:48:11] that's the message there
[1:48:14] blessings have come to Israel and yet
[1:48:17] they wanted to have a law or something
[1:48:21] that they could do themselves
[1:48:26] and it's like many questions today uh to
[1:48:29] be a Christian they think they have to
[1:48:30] do some Christian Works they have to do
[1:48:33] this or that of course you want to do
[1:48:35] that but that's not what it is all about
[1:48:38] you do it because of the love of God
[1:48:41] within your heart you're not doing it
[1:48:43] because you're sending up uh numbers are
[1:48:47] you sending up money to God are you
[1:48:50] sending up Good Works to God I was a
[1:48:52] good man I was just like that you're not
[1:48:55] doing it for that so when you have
[1:48:56] enough up there you says well now I can
[1:49:00] go I don't have to worry when I meet
[1:49:01] Peter at the get he said oh come right
[1:49:04] in Mr sunso I know you did this you did
[1:49:06] this now it doesn't work like that
[1:49:09] that's Pentecostal beliefs
[1:49:11] denominational beliefs
[1:49:13] our beliefs is blessed upon the word of
[1:49:16] God which has to do with predestination
[1:49:20] election for knowledge
[1:49:23] amen and then the spirit of God comes
[1:49:26] and places you in whichever age you're
[1:49:29] supposed to be in you are positionally
[1:49:31] placed in that age
[1:49:33] and then within that particular age that
[1:49:36] you are placing you recognize your
[1:49:39] purpose
[1:49:40] amen not in the individual Church you
[1:49:43] recognize your purpose but in the age
[1:49:45] this is the age in other words oh now I
[1:49:48] know I am supposed to be in this age you
[1:49:51] could be in no other age but in this age
[1:49:54] because God shaped you God planned you
[1:49:57] God purpose you God had your personality
[1:50:01] set up in such a way that it will only
[1:50:04] fit in this age
[1:50:06] and that is why you are here in this age
[1:50:09] and when the Holy Spirit reveals himself
[1:50:11] to you that that is him placing you as a
[1:50:16] son or as a daughter and say I recognize
[1:50:19] you within this age
[1:50:22] and that's why you can't go back to any
[1:50:25] passage because you won't fit there
[1:50:28] and you will be out of order
[1:50:31] absolutely praise the name of the Lord
[1:50:33] they wanted something for them to do
[1:50:36] themselves they want to justify
[1:50:39] themselves that I you know I did
[1:50:41] something too I I I I kneeled on the
[1:50:45] cathedral steps and I did the 13
[1:50:47] Stations of the Cross I let so many
[1:50:50] candles what you gave there was this two
[1:50:54] inch candles my own was 18 inches wide
[1:50:58] across there and when you see you burn
[1:51:01] that things begin to happen up in heaven
[1:51:04] oh my you saw Martin Luther where when
[1:51:08] he said there John tetzel says as soon
[1:51:11] as your money drops within the Box the
[1:51:14] soul of your mother Rises up to God
[1:51:18] it's not in the Bible
[1:51:19] but the way he was a real speaker the
[1:51:22] way he said it he got the people to
[1:51:24] believe right so people believe still in
[1:51:27] crawling up the steps flagellating
[1:51:29] themselves and everything else and
[1:51:31] they're not paying attention to the word
[1:51:33] of God you see because they want to have
[1:51:37] something they can do themselves
[1:51:41] they want some Sabbath day
[1:51:45] that they can keep
[1:51:48] oh my
[1:51:49] think of that
[1:51:51] my goodness
[1:51:53] they want some other Church ordinance
[1:51:58] that they're told to do that they can go
[1:52:00] do that and when they do it perfectly
[1:52:02] they feel that justifies and qualifies
[1:52:05] them for entrance into the presence of
[1:52:08] God oh my or something or another they
[1:52:12] want to do it but they want something to
[1:52:15] do themselves they don't like it when
[1:52:18] they're here there is nothing for you to
[1:52:21] do salvation is by God Alone
[1:52:26] is that right salvation is God alone
[1:52:30] all you got to do is accept him accept
[1:52:33] it receive it within your heart and
[1:52:36] allow God to work within you and work
[1:52:39] out his purposes within your life praise
[1:52:41] the Lord is not works and so that's why
[1:52:45] the the devil literally got even me
[1:52:48] in the first part of your Christianity
[1:52:51] to start guarding people to works that
[1:52:54] they have to be this you have to be that
[1:52:56] you have to be that but it's an
[1:52:58] individual thing how you have to be
[1:53:01] because the holy spirit is going to deal
[1:53:03] with you just as much as he deals with
[1:53:04] me as a Shepherd in general I have to
[1:53:07] try to hold the sheep together with the
[1:53:10] word of God but each individual believer
[1:53:13] must speak to God In Prayer in Bible
[1:53:17] reading and fellowship and listen for
[1:53:21] his voice speaking to them how to walk
[1:53:24] how to conduct themselves how to carry
[1:53:27] go forward in the name of the Lord or
[1:53:30] brother Brandon asked the angel sir what
[1:53:32] of my future what of my future the angel
[1:53:36] pick up a piece of paper crumple to
[1:53:39] design through it in the air and said
[1:53:40] your future is clear oh praise God May
[1:53:44] every one of us hear the voice of God
[1:53:47] saying to you your future is clear
[1:53:50] clear everything else out of the way and
[1:53:53] let the spirit of the Living God shine
[1:53:56] brightly upon your lies praise God I'm
[1:53:59] watching the timing I'm not going to
[1:54:01] keep you longer than I ought to but I'm
[1:54:04] trying to get as much of this as I can
[1:54:05] to you is that okay
[1:54:08] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:54:11] amen
[1:54:12] now remember
[1:54:14] there is not one thing any of us can do
[1:54:19] to save ourselves
[1:54:21] do you believe that
[1:54:23] amen there is not one Speck of it you
[1:54:28] can do it is all Grace
[1:54:31] law is what you do
[1:54:34] in regards to the grace you received is
[1:54:38] that right
[1:54:39] amen or by of God is showed to you by
[1:54:44] Saving you
[1:54:45] as I have often said I don't run around
[1:54:48] with other women
[1:54:50] because I'm afraid my wife will divorce
[1:54:53] me
[1:54:57] it's got real quiet now
[1:55:00] it's okay but listen I'm just going to
[1:55:02] quote brother brother here
[1:55:05] now
[1:55:07] I don't run around with other women
[1:55:09] because I'm afraid my wife will divorce
[1:55:12] me
[1:55:13] but I don't run around with other women
[1:55:16] because I love my wife
[1:55:19] can some of you Brothers Say Amen
[1:55:22] so half-heartedly
[1:55:26] say it like you really mean it let's do
[1:55:29] it again Brothers praise the Lord
[1:55:31] because they are listening praise God do
[1:55:34] you love your wife
[1:55:36] I do if you don't I do
[1:55:41] hallelujah amen
[1:55:46] see I don't believe you should run wrong
[1:55:51] but the law isn't what keeps me
[1:55:54] in other words now listen to this it's
[1:55:57] some some of these courts Brothers don't
[1:55:59] even see them they pass over them he
[1:56:01] says do you know it's not even my
[1:56:05] marriage vow
[1:56:07] that keeps me that is law
[1:56:10] and we got to keep natural law surely
[1:56:14] but that's not what he's saying here
[1:56:16] that's not what's really keeping me
[1:56:18] it's my love for my wife that's keeping
[1:56:22] me amen and you pay regard to your vows
[1:56:28] that you made like that you see but this
[1:56:32] is my love for her and it's the reason
[1:56:35] why I obey the word of God is the reason
[1:56:39] why I live for him it's because I love
[1:56:42] God I love him it's not because I'm
[1:56:45] afraid he'll send me to hell that I'm
[1:56:49] serving him I'm serving him because I
[1:56:52] love him amen so much that I don't want
[1:56:55] to do anything that will bring heart to
[1:56:58] him and so do I and so do you if you're
[1:57:03] a True Believer praise the name of the
[1:57:05] Lord Lord of God Amen now when men and
[1:57:10] women get to a place
[1:57:12] and begin to say well I really ought to
[1:57:15] stay at home
[1:57:16] because my favorite
[1:57:18] television show is coming on tonight
[1:57:24] I tell you they'll think I'm back slid
[1:57:28] if I don't go down to the church
[1:57:31] if I don't go down to the church
[1:57:33] the church people are going to think I'm
[1:57:35] backslid
[1:57:36] amen
[1:57:38] and you sat there and you just sleep
[1:57:41] away
[1:57:43] you might as well have stayed home
[1:57:45] and looked at something that you may
[1:57:48] enjoy more than being in the presence of
[1:57:51] God
[1:57:52] when you but when your joy turns and
[1:57:56] becomes the Lord see and the Lord
[1:57:59] becomes your joy you can't stay away
[1:58:03] from church then you now you're getting
[1:58:06] somewhere the church now was in better
[1:58:10] shape 40 years ago than it is here
[1:58:13] tonight amen because they were closer to
[1:58:16] God they had God among them they had
[1:58:18] more Spirit among them than many
[1:58:21] churches got in them today amen is that
[1:58:25] the truth
[1:58:27] my God bless us praise the Lord I meant
[1:58:31] to Antigua and we were reminiscing in
[1:58:33] some of the times we got together in in
[1:58:36] each other houses groups of us would get
[1:58:39] together one playing a guitar the other
[1:58:41] singing sisters cooking rejoicing in the
[1:58:45] presence of God going by brother Mike's
[1:58:48] mom sitting in our little tiny little uh
[1:58:52] house that she had cropped together and
[1:58:55] she's bringing out those brownies and
[1:58:57] teas and pieces of pizza and paper
[1:59:01] rejoicing in the presence of God and
[1:59:03] bringing glory to his name Hallelujah
[1:59:06] and that came was coming back to those
[1:59:09] Believers and myself while we were there
[1:59:11] what sweet wonderful times were in the
[1:59:14] presence of the Living God amen
[1:59:16] hallelujah oh praise God but that's the
[1:59:20] way it is Friends uh now today I believe
[1:59:24] we need that together in the grace of
[1:59:26] God because the devil is encouraging
[1:59:28] selfishness in the church
[1:59:31] everybody lives their own life to
[1:59:33] themselves forget about the rest of them
[1:59:36] but this getting together Fellowship
[1:59:38] rail Fellowship a fellowship on the
[1:59:40] phone Fellowship on the computer
[1:59:42] Fellowship by WhatsApp Fellowship by
[1:59:44] Twitter or Instagram or something like
[1:59:46] that but face to face Fellowship you
[1:59:49] know like that that's another matter I
[1:59:50] don't have time I'm too busy this guy
[1:59:53] work out amen but Brothers we've got to
[1:59:56] try to get that Spirit moving in our
[2:00:00] hearts amen where we value one another
[2:00:03] praise God there's nothing like the give
[2:00:06] and take that comes from one heart to
[2:00:08] the other the spirit of God working and
[2:00:11] moving Hallelujah like that in a special
[2:00:14] wonderful way amen
[2:00:17] now friends let me say this
[2:00:20] amen God will provide you with all the
[2:00:24] works if you will just keep walking in
[2:00:28] Grace
[2:00:31] you keep walking in his grace and
[2:00:33] automatically works are going to come
[2:00:36] off of you
[2:00:37] amen you'll be in fact he said you will
[2:00:42] be more at work than you are right now
[2:00:46] see oh my all them things oh praise God
[2:00:51] remember your tithes pears the preacher
[2:00:57] the preacher is to live by the tithes of
[2:01:00] the people
[2:01:01] and we had to go and get other things we
[2:01:04] want to do to pay the preacher tithes
[2:01:08] and offering goes to Levi which was the
[2:01:11] minister you understand what God is
[2:01:13] talking about when they had the 12
[2:01:15] tribes and and if you know God divided
[2:01:18] up and said well you get this you get
[2:01:20] that this ottoman will do this this
[2:01:21] other but you tribe of the Levi all you
[2:01:24] will do is serve me in the temple
[2:01:27] and even though you don't have to go to
[2:01:30] the field you don't have to go chasing
[2:01:31] after sheep you don't have to do this
[2:01:33] you don't have to do that stay in the
[2:01:35] temple and you serve me in the temple
[2:01:38] and I'm gonna let all the rest of the
[2:01:41] tribes give the tithes for your support
[2:01:45] here in the temple of God that's where
[2:01:48] God was talking about and that's what it
[2:01:51] is praise the Lord hallelujah amen
[2:01:54] praise God now
[2:01:56] remember
[2:01:59] that I'm going to pass over that and
[2:02:01] move on to something else now every man
[2:02:04] ought to have a church who who believes
[2:02:06] that
[2:02:07] praise God you ought to have a church
[2:02:11] home see you ought to have a place not
[2:02:15] just be a floater floating about from
[2:02:18] Pillar To Post you have somewhere you
[2:02:21] must have somewhere that you go to
[2:02:24] church
[2:02:25] praise the Lord amen and you called that
[2:02:30] place your church
[2:02:32] see that is somewhere where you must pay
[2:02:36] your tithes
[2:02:37] somewhere where you can help to support
[2:02:42] the cause praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:02:45] praise God but do you know I feel that
[2:02:49] the church member their first obligation
[2:02:52] is with the tithes and offerings is to
[2:02:55] support the church
[2:02:57] and if you are members of fine churches
[2:03:00] that's represented then you'll support
[2:03:03] that church
[2:03:04] Amen in other words tithes and offerings
[2:03:07] are not relegated to just people in the
[2:03:10] message it's represented in every Church
[2:03:14] regardless of who they are they're
[2:03:16] supposed to pay this tithes and he's
[2:03:20] saying that
[2:03:21] that's your first duty to God and the
[2:03:24] stories you surely know what that is
[2:03:26] it's where you get your food that's
[2:03:29] where you get your spiritual food and
[2:03:32] your obligation
[2:03:35] is to that church
[2:03:37] not to any evangelist or anybody else
[2:03:41] like me
[2:03:43] and anywhere praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:03:46] well well I send my times to voice of
[2:03:50] God
[2:03:54] over here over there I said to brother
[2:03:57] this or brother that no
[2:04:00] your taste goes to the church where you
[2:04:03] belong
[2:04:04] and where you get your spiritual food
[2:04:07] now
[2:04:08] if there are people and there are people
[2:04:11] out there where there is no pastors
[2:04:13] they're scattered everywhere
[2:04:15] the scattered out east out west
[2:04:18] everywhere they're scattered there are
[2:04:20] no pastors there uh there's no church
[2:04:23] there
[2:04:24] and they
[2:04:27] maybe will listen to Somebody Like Me
[2:04:29] online and they decide to send their
[2:04:32] tithes on their offerings because this
[2:04:34] is where they get their spiritual food
[2:04:36] off of this ministry
[2:04:39] same with the voice of God
[2:04:42] somebody out there with no pasta
[2:04:46] and uh the voice of God is where they
[2:04:49] listen to and they get their spiritual
[2:04:51] food they are on the obligation
[2:04:55] not me telling you to do it but the word
[2:04:58] tells you you you're on the obligation
[2:05:01] wherever you get your spiritual food
[2:05:03] that's where you're supposed to send
[2:05:05] your time
[2:05:07] so
[2:05:08] even if I disagree a little bit with
[2:05:11] this brother here and disagree is
[2:05:13] approach on this or that when it comes
[2:05:15] to this God spoke in his word Claire
[2:05:19] is that right amen no so some of those
[2:05:22] people they need the better times and
[2:05:26] they decide they're paying it to the
[2:05:27] voice of God
[2:05:29] right
[2:05:30] what if there is a church in your
[2:05:32] neighborhood
[2:05:33] there is a real Pastor there
[2:05:36] and you want to hide your rebellion and
[2:05:39] your rebellious Spirit uh behind it and
[2:05:42] say oh I got my spiritual food from uh
[2:05:45] brother so and so I get it over here
[2:05:48] from Brother here so I'm going to send
[2:05:50] it there and I'm not going to that
[2:05:52] church or God will hold you guilty
[2:05:56] because there's a place for you to
[2:05:58] worship there's a place for you to
[2:06:00] receive your spiritual food but oh no I
[2:06:04] I rather to listen it online and rather
[2:06:07] to listen it there but you don't get the
[2:06:09] same Fellowship when you got to get
[2:06:11] together with true Saints of the Living
[2:06:12] God hallelujah and that is necessary for
[2:06:16] you to do that for the glory of God Amen
[2:06:19] so God bless them brothers whoever they
[2:06:22] are wherever they are that God will
[2:06:24] bless them but I trust God's spirit will
[2:06:27] help the rest everybody to get this
[2:06:29] straightened up in their hearts and in
[2:06:31] their thoughts amen praise the name of
[2:06:33] the Lord yes sir o praise God forever
[2:06:37] let me go over some things here and then
[2:06:39] I'm going to stop
[2:06:43] do you see what a strict thing God has
[2:06:46] it for us to pay our tithes
[2:06:50] tithing is right every Christian is Duty
[2:06:56] bound to pay their time and that has
[2:07:01] never been changed amen see oh my it's
[2:07:06] never been changed they tried to change
[2:07:09] it for everything else they're trying to
[2:07:11] change it for somebody playing lottery
[2:07:13] in the church and if they win to take
[2:07:16] the place of the God's blessing where he
[2:07:19] said try me and prove me
[2:07:22] they're trying to replace it with a
[2:07:24] lottery I forgot what's the word they
[2:07:26] use when they bring it in the church
[2:07:27] they don't call it Lottery they call it
[2:07:30] something else
[2:07:31] um amen see our suppers or things like
[2:07:36] that my goodness my now all of that
[2:07:40] trying to bypass God's tithing let me
[2:07:44] tell you what it is it is nothing but
[2:07:47] enticing spirits that have come down
[2:07:51] trying to substitute something else
[2:07:56] for the obeying the word of God did you
[2:07:59] get that
[2:08:00] oh my I didn't know that myself until
[2:08:04] being led to that now these are enticing
[2:08:08] Spirits he said that have come down and
[2:08:11] all they're doing is putting all kinds
[2:08:12] of ideas in people's minds and leading
[2:08:15] them off to make them avoid doing God's
[2:08:17] simple command pay your tithes
[2:08:22] pay your tithes
[2:08:25] oh my you see they're trying to
[2:08:28] substitute something else for the word
[2:08:30] God has no substitute
[2:08:33] none whatsoever for his word is eternal
[2:08:37] and forever
[2:08:38] and faith has no substitute true Faith
[2:08:43] stands alone it stands on the word of
[2:08:47] God and it stands alone amen because it
[2:08:51] no it cannot be moved hallelujah praise
[2:08:55] God it knows that it's being

[2:13:10] and where I could have been
[2:13:12] transformed my entire life and I thank
[2:13:16] him and praise him for that and many
[2:13:18] that have walked within this ministry
[2:13:21] God has blessed in wonderful ways
[2:13:25] many have gone from just having a
[2:13:28] regular job or a regular small company
[2:13:32] until they have become big and huge and
[2:13:37] gone from just a few thousands and gone
[2:13:40] into millions God bless their heart and
[2:13:43] life and I'm glad that God used me to be
[2:13:47] a part of it praise God I don't look
[2:13:50] necessarily to get human acknowledgment
[2:13:52] my acknowledgment comes from God
[2:13:55] God works it out praise God but you know
[2:13:58] sometimes somebody say oh I did it
[2:14:00] myself oh I I did so I did this I did
[2:14:03] that look at what the Lord helped me to
[2:14:05] do but it doesn't work that way God
[2:14:07] knows everything amen and he is the one
[2:14:10] that's working everything oh pour down
[2:14:13] His blessings upon me blessings that I
[2:14:17] don't have place to receive may he do
[2:14:19] the same for you and in this coming year
[2:14:21] God permitting
[2:14:23] many years ago God began to show me some
[2:14:28] things in brother Brandon's message
[2:14:30] where he kept saying I don't have the
[2:14:32] time he couldn't speak on Christian
[2:14:35] prosperity
[2:14:38] because he had a message and he has to
[2:14:40] stay on that line
[2:14:42] but he just touched on it and passed
[2:14:44] over it and by the grace of God I was
[2:14:47] able to preach on a series on it which
[2:14:49] was spot not thing within the hearts on
[2:14:54] minds of believers and they give one
[2:14:56] example there is one brother that that
[2:15:00] nothing and the next thing you know
[2:15:03] he was almost having a million
[2:15:05] and God began to bless him but I'm not
[2:15:08] only talking about prosperity in terms
[2:15:10] of money for when the Bible talks about
[2:15:13] prosperity in John it's telling you
[2:15:16] about your whole person your prosper in
[2:15:19] health
[2:15:20] don't you want to prosper in health

[2:15:29] amen and your skin he says shall become
[2:15:33] like a child glory god don't you want
[2:15:35] scripture like that the prophet's
[2:15:37] already prophesied that if you believe
[2:15:39] the word of God you prosper in health
