[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] hello and good evening friends
[0:19] once again we are happy to be
[0:22] together in the house of the lord
[0:27] we enjoyed last wednesday's
[0:30] study and now we enter
[0:34] into the next part of it
[0:38] as we continue we are
[0:41] speaking on the topic
[0:45] of cain son
[0:50] of satan i repeat
[0:53] cain son
[0:56] of satan our scripture
[1:00] reading is found in
[1:03] 1st john chapter 3
[1:07] verses 11 and
[1:10] 12. let me read the word of god
[1:17] for this is the message
[1:20] you have heard from the beginning
[1:24] that you should love one another
[1:28] not as cain who was of that
[1:32] wicked one who slew
[1:35] his brother and
[1:38] wherefore slew he him
[1:42] because his own works
[1:46] were evil and his
[1:49] brothers was righteous
[1:54] our gracious heavenly father
[1:58] how thankful we are
[2:01] that you have opened the eyes of our
[2:04] hearts
[2:06] may the great holy spirit
[2:09] apply the token of the word
[2:14] granting to us divine understanding and
[2:17] wisdom
[2:19] whosoever you will you
[2:22] open and whosoever you will you shut
[2:26] to thine be the glory honor and praise
[2:30] in the name of jesus christ our lord
[2:33] amen praise god
[2:37] hallelujah so we are speaking about
[2:41] cain son of satan
[2:47] we understand clearly here
[2:51] that cain was of satan
[2:56] he displays this in his very
[3:00] nature he was of satan
[3:04] his origin was of satan for he displays
[3:09] his beastly and animalistic
[3:14] actions by his behavior
[3:20] by doing this through nature
[3:23] through his nature his character and
[3:27] through his
[3:28] actions he proves and displays to us
[3:33] that he indeed is the son of satan
[3:38] and he shows it why
[3:42] that he's a liar of course jesus said
[3:45] you are of your father the devil
[3:48] and he is a liar from the very beginning
[3:52] and all liars find their place
[3:56] in the pits of hell there is a place
[3:59] there is a position
[4:00] for them and it is in the pit of hell
[4:04] now notice carefully he was a liar but
[4:07] when god
[4:08] asked him where is your brother a bell
[4:12] he said i don't know that was a lie
[4:16] see for he had already killed him
[4:20] and disposed of or hid his body
[4:24] and god was letting him know i know all
[4:27] things his blood is crying to me from
[4:29] the ground
[4:31] where you hid him placed him
[4:34] or entombed him so he was a liar
[4:38] from the very beginning
[4:42] not only that he was a murderer
[4:46] for you see how he murdered his brother
[4:49] abel and with anger
[4:52] uh and displayed that quality
[4:55] already next he was a rebel
[4:59] and he was a renegade
[5:03] this is clearly in the scriptures you
[5:06] will find it in genesis chapter 4
[5:08] verses 5 9 1 13
[5:12] and 14. he had these
[5:15] inhuman beastly
[5:18] like characteristics and was
[5:22] terrible in actual fact
[5:25] he was a prototype of
[5:28] all of the rest of his generations
[5:32] that will would come from his
[5:35] genealogy or his genes
[5:39] he displays their nature
[5:42] how they will act how they will think
[5:45] what they will do
[5:46] throughout his generations throughout
[5:48] all
[5:50] time now
[5:52] how did an animal
[5:56] how did a beast like
[5:59] this appear suddenly
[6:03] on the scene in the garden
[6:06] of eden at the very beginning
[6:10] of the word the world
[6:13] the bible however you would like to
[6:15] express that
[6:18] when god himself when
[6:21] he looked down the bible records god
[6:25] said oh
[6:26] it is good it is good
[6:30] and suddenly it is bad why
[6:34] with the appearance of cain
[6:37] through the instrumentality of
[6:40] the serpent now
[6:44] let's see where he originated
[6:48] from genesis chapter 4
[6:51] verse 1 and adam knew eve
[6:55] his wife and she
[6:58] conceived and bare
[7:01] cain and said i have
[7:04] gotten a man from the lord
[7:08] and she again
[7:12] bare his brother abel
[7:16] now genesis 4 25 says and adam knew
[7:19] his wife again and she bear a son
[7:23] and called his name seth now here are
[7:27] three
[7:27] sons coming on the scene
[7:32] uh by two acts of
[7:35] carnal knowledge by adam
[7:40] now the word of god is perfect there is
[7:43] no mistakes
[7:45] in the word of god like some may may
[7:48] think now
[7:52] three sons born by two acts
[7:55] of adam and we know
[7:59] positively definitely and conclusively
[8:03] that one of these three sons
[8:07] was not of adam or
[8:10] not adam's son now
[8:14] we understand that the truth of the
[8:16] matter is
[8:17] is that eve with her first
[8:21] conception and the first birth
[8:25] was bearing twins kane
[8:28] and abel now we find out france
[8:33] that cain subcaine's conception
[8:37] was slightly previous to a bells
[8:42] but we know that this is possible
[8:46] or if you will read or research this
[8:49] after i'm finished and this uh
[8:53] this broadcast is over you may go and
[8:56] research it
[8:57] how that two men
[9:01] going to one woman having acts with
[9:04] one woman in the same day
[9:07] it is possible for have for her to have
[9:11] twins by these two acts
[9:16] apart in time
[9:20] but yet she bears conception
[9:24] for both and produces twins
[9:27] you may find examples of this
[9:31] in bowman texas 1963
[9:34] uh you may find uh various
[9:38] uh illustrations of this
[9:41] like in norway and many other countries
[9:46] just search for it on the internet in
[9:48] your encyclopedia
[9:50] you will find conclusive proof that this
[9:53] is absolutely possible
[9:57] now why did this have to be
[10:01] why did this have to happen
[10:06] why did the seed of the serpent
[10:09] have to come this way
[10:13] you see because man was created
[10:16] by god and
[10:19] man was created specifically
[10:22] to be the temple or the resting place
[10:27] of god in other words he
[10:30] would be god's masterpiece
[10:34] and after god is finished with his
[10:36] masterpiece
[10:37] the highest the height the crown of his
[10:40] creation
[10:41] there is nothing else for him to make
[10:44] so he would rest then as the bible said
[10:48] he
[10:48] rested on the perfect day now notice
[10:52] that man was god's temple
[10:56] and supposed to be the place of god's
[10:59] rest
[11:00] now in acts chapter 7 verses 46
[11:04] to 51 who
[11:07] found favor before god
[11:11] and desire to find the tabernacle
[11:14] for the god of jacob speaking of solomon
[11:17] of course
[11:18] but solomon built him and house
[11:23] how be it the most high
[11:27] it not in temples made with hands
[11:32] i saith the prophet heaven is my throne
[11:36] and earth is my footstool
[11:40] what house will you build me saith
[11:44] the lord or what is the place
[11:48] of my rest had not my hand made all of
[11:52] these things
[11:54] ye and uncircumcised in
[11:57] ears and hearts
[12:01] do you do always resist
[12:05] the holy ghost as your
[12:08] fathers did so do
[12:12] ye now satan has
[12:15] known this all along
[12:18] that god's ultimate
[12:21] place position is to
[12:26] build a resting place for himself
[12:30] and that resting place is
[12:33] in the heart of man nor he not knowing
[12:37] not that you are the temple you are the
[12:40] temples of the holy ghost and god
[12:44] in this last seventh day this
[12:48] age this evil age of leonisia
[12:51] has come to find his places of
[12:54] his place of rest now satan
[12:58] knew this he was fully aware
[13:01] and so he as he did in the garden of
[13:04] eden
[13:05] wants to run ahead of god and
[13:09] and and usurp god's resting place
[13:13] or to indwell man before
[13:16] god can get to that man's heart
[13:20] that woman's heart to speak to them
[13:23] to lead them to guide them to protect
[13:26] them to provide for them preserve them
[13:28] and finally take them into his divine
[13:31] presence satan comes along
[13:33] and tries to mess up make up mix-up
[13:37] in every way that person's life
[13:41] some of us are made aware of this
[13:45] and we are able to come out from his
[13:47] trolldom
[13:48] his spells his charm his sins
[13:52] and walk into the glorious liberty
[13:55] of the sons and daughters of the living
[13:58] god
[14:00] and so he wants to indwell man just
[14:03] as god does but god has reserved that
[14:08] right for himself
[14:11] now let me refer to the fact that
[14:14] this is satan's desire he knows that
[14:18] that's what god created
[14:19] man for and what god desires is to have
[14:23] man to be his resting place
[14:26] this is satan's desire this is satan's
[14:30] highest ambition to find a man
[14:33] a woman that will surrender themselves
[14:36] to him
[14:38] that he might you possess them
[14:41] and use them to create
[14:44] as much evil doings wrongdoings
[14:47] lies murders and corruption in every
[14:52] form
[14:52] possible that he can just as he did
[14:56] in the heavens or tried to do in the
[14:59] heavens it's not
[15:00] possible to deceive god's elect god's
[15:03] angels god's sons god's daughters
[15:05] so he fell to earth
[15:09] and in falling to art you would think
[15:11] that he would repent
[15:13] you would think he would change his
[15:14] behavior but he doesn't change his
[15:17] behavior
[15:19] he actually doubles up his efforts
[15:23] trying to overthrow subvert
[15:26] uh deceive the the kingdom of god
[15:31] in even in the religious realm
[15:34] and not in seducing a physical body but
[15:37] seducing of the spirit by deceptions
[15:40] lies and errors
[15:42] and false doctrines that are so
[15:45] subtly constricted that if one does not
[15:49] listen
[15:49] close enough one's heart is not open
[15:52] close enough
[15:54] one will be led astray and led off
[15:57] of the true foundations of the word
[16:00] of the living god now i know many years
[16:04] ago
[16:04] uh much younger us of course brother
[16:08] donnie reagan a marvelous man of god
[16:13] preached a message called satan's desire
[16:17] satan's desire i can't remember what
[16:20] year but it really struck me
[16:22] satan's ambition is to
[16:26] take god's place to receive
[16:29] worship and praise like god is receiving
[16:33] and to find the resting place that god
[16:38] resting in wanted to resting or wants a
[16:41] desire to rest in
[16:43] that he might come into the temple of
[16:45] god and appear
[16:46] like god and raise and exalt himself as
[16:50] if he was god
[16:51] but we know he was kicked out of heaven
[16:53] he was cast
[16:54] out from the presence of god and as it
[16:57] was
[16:58] then so will it be and so is
[17:01] it for every son and daughter and child
[17:04] of
[17:05] the living god amen if you have the time
[17:08] try to find the message of our dear
[17:11] brother
[17:11] and listen to it it will inspire your
[17:15] soul
[17:16] and lift your spirit satan's desire
[17:19] satan's ambition brother donnie reagan
[17:23] a blessed man of god may god
[17:26] use him and anoint him as he
[17:29] brings the word of god for this hour
[17:32] blessing those god has placed in
[17:35] his care and those under the influence
[17:39] of the sound of his voice by the
[17:41] anointing of the holy spirit
[17:45] now we know that god
[17:48] alone appeared in flesh
[17:51] satan could not appear in flesh
[17:56] because he doesn't have creative powers
[17:59] but he could find a a creature of flesh
[18:04] and indwell it and in that way
[18:07] he can make his appearance
[18:11] his physical appearance and then
[18:14] through that creature he could make his
[18:18] influence his actions
[18:21] and his nature be displayed
[18:24] upon the face of the earth
[18:28] so to accomplish that he had to
[18:31] enter into the serpent there
[18:35] in the garden of eden i've said before
[18:39] i'll say it again
[18:40] the serpent is what they are searching
[18:43] for
[18:45] they're searching for the missing link
[18:49] and the missing link is really the
[18:52] serpent
[18:53] for the serpent was not a snake
[18:57] at that time we find out friends
[19:02] just as satan entered the evil spirits
[19:06] entered into the man from gadara and
[19:08] infested
[19:10] him with evil spirits
[19:13] this is his tried true
[19:17] evil and pernicious metal
[19:20] of being able to indwell
[19:24] possess control
[19:27] and use women and men
[19:31] as his tools for evil
[19:35] and corruption and evil on the
[19:38] face of this earth so
[19:42] he could not have a child directly
[19:47] with eve as god
[19:51] did by mary for god had the child
[19:55] a begotten son jesus christ by his
[19:58] spoken word
[20:00] for he was a creator and he is a creator
[20:04] and by his spoken word was create
[20:07] able to create this holy thing this seed
[20:11] of god
[20:12] that would be made manifest and comfort
[20:16] jesus christ the word made flesh
[20:20] and walk among us and dwell among us
[20:24] but so since satan could not speak his
[20:28] word
[20:30] and create a seed
[20:34] his other option was to end well
[20:39] an already existing
[20:42] animal being or beast
[20:46] and use it to be able
[20:49] to transform himself his influence his
[20:53] nature
[20:54] and so on his characteristics within the
[20:57] bloodstream
[20:58] in other words this is pollution the
[21:00] beginning of pollution we're talking
[21:02] about here
[21:03] how he polluted the entire
[21:06] human race polluted the entire earth
[21:11] and then dispersed
[21:14] his and spawned his evil
[21:18] webs lies of the and of deceit
[21:22] across the entire world so here we are
[21:26] my friends
[21:28] he entered into the serpent
[21:32] and possessed him and
[21:35] began to use him and the instrumentality
[21:38] of his physicality
[21:40] he was able to defile beguile
[21:43] seduce eve and
[21:47] satan my friends
[21:51] by satan's evil act of adultery against
[21:56] adam
[21:57] by his evil act of seduction
[22:01] eve was able to bear his
[22:05] son cain for
[22:08] the serpent as i explained before was
[22:10] not
[22:11] like a uh just looking like a regular
[22:15] animal he was the link between animal
[22:18] and man he looked everything like a man
[22:22] moved like a man talked like a man and
[22:25] had the
[22:25] intelligence utility of a man
[22:29] but he lacked one thing he did not have
[22:32] a soul
[22:32] he didn't have the place for a soul a
[22:36] soul less dead on the inside being an
[22:39] individual
[22:40] dead corrupt decadent
[22:44] everything in there there was no life
[22:46] there was no light
[22:47] there was darkness in him for he was a
[22:50] son of darkness
[22:52] and so satan was able to use
[22:55] the serpent and king came forth
[22:59] bearing uh the the
[23:02] sinful characteristics
[23:07] of his father satan
[23:11] and the animalistic
[23:14] nature the beast like nature
[23:18] sensual and fleshly
[23:22] of the serpent notice carefully the
[23:24] height breathing
[23:26] the spiritual characteristics of certain
[23:31] and in nature the natural physical
[23:35] characteristics of the serpent
[23:39] was all in this evil
[23:42] one now we know there's a
[23:45] definite affinity between man
[23:48] and animal and
[23:52] that physical uh characteristic
[23:55] is still there to this very day
[24:00] now that is the reason why you can see
[24:03] in
[24:03] some men women
[24:06] people around the world many
[24:10] have this beastly nature
[24:14] animalistic nature they'll kill you as a
[24:17] flesh
[24:18] they'll lie just like that you see
[24:22] satan is satan in other words uh
[24:26] satan doesn't sin satan is the ultimate
[24:30] sinner
[24:32] this is nature to sin he doesn't have to
[24:34] sink to sin
[24:36] and his generations are like that uh
[24:39] it just flows out of them like a bilge
[24:43] it flows out of them like a
[24:46] a cesspool it flows out of them like a
[24:50] swamp
[24:50] it flows out of them for they are the
[24:53] swamp
[24:54] they are the cesspool they are the bilge
[24:58] of it all and so he by nature
[25:02] you see now you say oh well uh uh
[25:05] christians uh may may sin uh
[25:08] yes they may sin my act
[25:12] but not by nature and not by nature
[25:15] not by choice but satan is a sinner by
[25:19] nature he has to do nothing he
[25:20] he he's just satan he's just sinful
[25:24] his nature's sinful evil to begin with
[25:27] and
[25:27] all of his generations are and cain
[25:31] and his serpent see children are
[25:34] of the same nature and the same
[25:37] generation they are sinners by nature
[25:42] to begin with but we the true
[25:45] believer and i believe i'm one of them
[25:48] amen
[25:49] they are not sinners by choice
[25:52] we are not sinners by nature
[25:56] but if we sin we have one
[25:59] who has laid down his life to redeem us
[26:02] thanks be to god
[26:04] but of satan's seed he saw sought
[26:07] repentance with tears but he could not
[26:10] find it how could he
[26:12] find it he could not find it for the
[26:15] very seed the very nature
[26:17] that was in him my friends was
[26:20] of satan and it could not be
[26:24] converted chains or anything else for it
[26:27] was satanic
[26:29] to begin with at the very origin
[26:33] we see therefore my friends that there
[26:36] is such an
[26:37] affinity between man and beast it's sad
[26:40] according to science
[26:41] that if one were to eat or to receive
[26:45] the
[26:45] thyroid cells or glands
[26:49] uh of of a hume of a of an animal
[26:52] it will go right to the thyroid uh
[26:55] of a human and let's say they were to
[26:58] take it
[26:59] and eat the kidney cells and it will go
[27:02] right to the human kidneys and
[27:06] so do you realize my friends how
[27:08] tremendous and stupendous this
[27:10] is you can apply it the opposite way
[27:13] from god
[27:14] if we eat god's word what we become the
[27:16] word and so and so on
[27:18] praise god hallelujah isn't it wonderful
[27:21] and stupendous when we see this
[27:25] now some intelligence
[27:28] puts these cells in their rightful
[27:31] places
[27:32] oh praise god so will the holy spirit
[27:35] place every believer
[27:36] in their rightful places to the glory of
[27:39] god
[27:40] amen now we see clearly friends
[27:44] in the word of god that the serpent the
[27:47] bible says was an
[27:48] upright creature he stood upright
[27:52] he walked he talked he
[27:56] reasoned and he was intelligent
[28:00] and to this very day upon this earth
[28:04] in the air in the atmosphere
[28:07] satan is the wisest
[28:11] that is all around us the only
[28:14] wisdom that he cannot handle is the
[28:18] wisdom of god the wisdom that was in
[28:21] solomon that was in jesus christ
[28:24] the wisdom of this open revealed word
[28:27] is the only wisdom he cannot handle
[28:33] other than that which man
[28:36] which woman whoever he be
[28:40] thinks he can challenge satan with his
[28:42] puny intelligence
[28:44] wisdom knowledge no you can't
[28:48] place yourself against this ancient evil
[28:51] being that's been there long before
[28:55] 6 000 years or whatever you want to
[28:58] think
[28:59] he was there the only person he could
[29:02] not overcome
[29:02] was god himself the only person he
[29:05] cannot overcome
[29:07] is jesus christ amen who overcame him
[29:10] defeated him
[29:12] and raised up the mighty conqueror
[29:15] over death held on the grave over
[29:18] sin and suffering praise god he's our
[29:22] healer he's our baptizer
[29:24] he's a thank god and our soon-coming
[29:28] king
[29:28] blessed be the lord glory to his
[29:31] marvelous
[29:32] and wonderful name praise god
[29:36] yes so satan took advantage
[29:41] of the physical characteristics
[29:45] of this serpent being
[29:48] animal or beast that was in
[29:52] the garden and so
[29:56] using the chemical affinity
[29:59] that lies between man
[30:03] and this first this this link
[30:07] that was there he used that
[30:11] to inseminate this woman
[30:15] and brought forth his son
[30:18] cain into manifestation
[30:24] god knowing that this was so wrong
[30:27] so evil god destroyed the pattern
[30:31] that is why they're searching for the
[30:32] missing link
[30:34] because it is no more god destroy
[30:37] that pattern because you know in the
[30:40] word of god it tells you
[30:41] from today on thy belly
[30:46] shalt thou go you see he was not on his
[30:49] belly he was standing upright he was
[30:51] talking he was walking
[30:52] and so from that day god turned the
[30:56] serpent
[30:58] into what we know today as a snake
[31:02] his generations i mean into what we call
[31:06] a snake and so there are snakes
[31:10] and there's still the fear between women
[31:13] and snakes
[31:14] it's still there now we know by friends
[31:18] no other beast can commingle with man
[31:22] but the affinity of that evil
[31:26] uh beast that satan used
[31:29] was the only one and god has destroyed
[31:33] that pattern oh
[31:36] there are things i could say but i'll
[31:38] just continue
[31:40] here with what i am talking about
[31:43] praise god of course that satan
[31:46] using the beast was trying to find a
[31:49] substitute
[31:50] man but there wasn't any other man but
[31:52] adam
[31:53] and he could not use adam so he had to
[31:56] find a
[31:57] substitute man and the only thing he
[32:00] could find
[32:01] was the serpent that looked like a man
[32:03] but was actually
[32:05] animalistic like some men are beastly
[32:09] like some people are or wicked
[32:12] evil to begin with so he possessed him
[32:15] and used him to create to
[32:19] bring about his desire
[32:22] his to achieve his
[32:25] foul ambitions he used
[32:29] the serpent at that particular time
[32:32] let us crystallize our thinking on this
[32:34] subject my friends
[32:36] we see here the necessity of us
[32:40] looking at this serpenty doctrine
[32:43] don't brush it aside don't just dismiss
[32:47] it
[32:48] don't think this is something far out
[32:50] from outer space or something
[32:52] it's in your bible if you are to read
[32:56] the book of genesis reading from chapter
[32:59] one two three and onwards
[33:02] and then by then you should have enough
[33:05] wisdom
[33:06] knowledge and revelation to be able to
[33:08] trace the serpent seed
[33:11] trail of the serpent mystery of iniquity
[33:16] right through the entire bible
[33:19] from genesis to its end
[33:23] in the book of revelation when it is
[33:26] all chained cast into the
[33:29] lake of fire burnt up and destroyed
[33:33] and then shall the righteous walk upon
[33:37] the ashes of the wicked
[33:40] whom god has destroyed according to his
[33:44] divine plan blessed be the name
[33:47] of our living god oh hallelujah glory to
[33:50] god amen yes sir
[33:52] so we see friends
[33:55] god allowed this in his sovereign and
[33:58] divine
[33:59] plan and purpose of redemption
[34:03] we understand that there were two trees
[34:07] in the garden the tree of life
[34:12] which was jesus christ
[34:16] and the other tree
[34:19] of knowledge of good and evil
[34:23] it's a mixed up tree a mingled up a
[34:25] hybrid tree
[34:27] it's got oranges it's got limes it's a
[34:29] mixed up
[34:30] of good and evil it can appear good
[34:34] uh like science it can appear good
[34:37] uh you know and create a car and then
[34:40] the car
[34:40] kills more people uh you know but
[34:43] accidents more than soldiers will kill
[34:45] the war or
[34:46] it'll create a chemical to make you well
[34:49] but it'll make you well in one area
[34:51] and unwell in five six seven eight or
[34:53] nine ten areas
[34:55] of your body and so on oh my friend
[34:58] that's the way it is
[35:00] the tree of life jesus christ the tree
[35:02] of knowledge of both good and evil
[35:04] satan right in the garden
[35:09] because of that came forth
[35:13] we see now in this world
[35:17] the fruits of evil in other words
[35:20] the fruits of the tree of knowledge
[35:25] and this tree
[35:29] this evil tree my friends
[35:32] is here with us today
[35:37] thank god that we
[35:40] can see also the contrast of that tree
[35:43] of knowledge
[35:44] with the tree of life we can see
[35:48] what has come forth from the tree of
[35:50] life none
[35:51] other but eternal life through jesus
[35:54] christ our lord
[35:55] thanks be unto god hallelujah now
[35:59] we know that the word has set forth
[36:02] that before the very foundation
[36:05] of the world how god's purpose
[36:10] was to share his eternal life with man
[36:15] for god already knew by his wisdom and
[36:18] knowledge
[36:20] of satan's ambush satan's
[36:23] ambition and his desire to exalt himself
[36:28] for pride
[36:29] always goes before the fall
[36:33] all right so now satan exalted himself
[36:38] and had to be cast down but before he
[36:42] even did that
[36:44] god had a plan aren't you glad you serve
[36:47] a
[36:47] god with a plan not just jumping around
[36:51] doing all kinds of things
[36:52] but we serve a god with a definite
[36:56] plan of redemption plan of purpose knows
[36:59] what he's doing
[37:00] and acting according to his words and
[37:03] according to his plan
[37:06] next week when we come back again we
[37:09] will
[37:09] talk about god's eternal plan and
[37:12] purpose
[37:13] manifest on the earth today and
[37:16] uh we as true believers are
[37:20] part of that plan we are here displaying
[37:23] manifesting and acting out that part of
[37:27] that plan of god
[37:28] of which we will go into as we search
[37:31] within
[37:32] the beauties of his holiness and the
[37:36] beauty of god's precious word
[37:39] hallelujah thanks be to god may god
[37:42] bless every
[37:43] one of you for this study here today
[37:47] may pique your mind may you search the
[37:50] word
[37:50] may you see whether these things be
[37:53] scriptural
[37:55] i want you to search
[37:59] in the word to see whether these things
[38:04] that i am a profoundly i am preaching to
[38:09] you
[38:10] are true i want to say to you
[38:13] they are true they are just
[38:17] they are revelatory they are according
[38:20] to the word of god
[38:22] and you will find it so when
[38:25] you read your bible open the book
[38:29] and read your bible for yourself you
[38:32] will find it in genesis chapter 2
[38:34] 3 4 5 and so on and see how it
[38:38] digresses and goes right into law the
[38:41] age of violence and evil
[38:42] and so on until to our day and our time
[38:46] may god bless you what a pleasure to
[38:48] have you
[38:49] with us today whether in your home
[38:53] whether in a far-off land whether you
[38:56] are
