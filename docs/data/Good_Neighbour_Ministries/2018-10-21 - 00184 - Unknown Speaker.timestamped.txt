[12:40] yes sir next thing is that this world is
[12:46] constantly changing the values in the
[12:49] world are changing so we this hour like
[13:10] this family might not changing now also
[13:20] we need some solid foundation if we are
[13:26] going to cause any form of leadership
[13:35] [Music]
[13:43] [Music]
[13:56] it's because people establish my
[14:49] righteousness and you know nominative
[14:56] lead people's further and regions so
[15:11] some leadership first
[15:17] gotta have the proper cocktail for you
[15:21] to be able to have real leadership in
[15:25] that way and that's really what Ricky
[15:28] rewards upon this foundation this upon
[15:43] this foundation you build something you
[15:47] building with gold or silver or precious
[15:52] stone are the truth you can skip it
[15:57] would pain but every man's work shall be
[16:07] for what if any man's work in which he
[16:32] has built thereupon he shall receive
[16:36] early for miscomi testified five it's
[16:43] going to be tested by fire on the day of
[16:46] judgment you can be rewarded if your
[16:49] building is less active right you can be
[16:55] rewarded if your building is left
[16:56] standing after the fire passes through
[16:59] Amen hallelujah and that revelation his
[17:05] work is the only foundation at the last
[17:09] you know you've seen this in many many
[17:13] other white
[17:15] houses burn right down putting a lock
[17:20] when you look is missing the foundations
[17:23] and that was still there on that because
[17:34] [Music]
[17:37] your life and you can try that you have
[17:54] received praise God nevertheless the
[18:02] foundation of God's and pure text in
[18:05] this sealed temporal years and that
[18:09] everyone that later the Living
[18:17] Translation so awesome teaching of the
[18:22] Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation that
[18:30] couldn't be more true I'll just
[18:50] Jesus is like a wise man who built his
[19:57] house upon that is from translation have
[20:03] you read about clearly hear these words
[20:07] I speak to you are not incidental
[20:10] additions in life
[20:12] they are foundational words they are
[20:16] words for you to build pretty stuff go
[20:23] back to the scripture quickly the
[20:27] airport everyone where these words of
[20:29] mine and to help them so you can hear
[20:33] the word
[20:35] ever late love it when you say you must
[20:37] put it into practice
[20:39] for it to me coming to power within your
[20:42] life put it into practice
[20:44] don't just hear it but put it into
[20:47] practice
[20:47] hallelujah amen praise God I'm not going
[20:51] to start printing some life-changing
[20:53] teaching quietly like the shapes a
[21:03] flower our planet will shape our life
[21:06] and ready to a place where it was to be
[21:09] demon and so that we will not be the
[21:13] same people they are silly because some
[21:27] groups by different their preacher will
[21:31] be preaching on this I think you know
[21:35] because it's almost like appreciate the
[21:38] truth that is deep that's not a place
[21:47] for that
[21:51] no but the preacher has to apply token
[21:55] to the liability so that the word goes
[21:58] into practice not just into technology
[22:02] but it was into practice so we now
[22:06] receive making this message of the
[22:08] Prophet that we write dragon but for us
[22:14] to the humility put it into practice
[22:17] [Music]
[22:20] praise God bless you next week we'll
[22:23] come back and we talked about the
[22:27] importance of having doctrine in your
[22:33] life
[22:33] praise the Lord hallelujah that doesn't
[22:37] mean I'm good with teaching with every
[22:39] doctor I'm speaking in a general way why
[22:42] it's important for efforts equals to
[22:45] actually at least know some of the
[22:50] essential doctrine taught by the Prophet
[22:54] Assad but doesn't required for you to
[22:57] know everything and the prophets had
[23:01] some some washing woman of old-world
[23:04] leaves back there the woods all by
[23:06] herself catches one revelation that's
[23:08] enough to take her home
[23:10] Sarah why because that one revelation
[23:13] says the veil
[23:23] [Music]
[23:32] [Music]
[23:40] praise God gracious Heavenly Father we
[23:46] thank you tonight for this this wicked
[23:49] of Portland generation that the devil
[23:53] keeps so occupied so busy putting the
[23:57] people into his nature where we like to
[23:59] run to a true great controversy from
[24:03] going to throw to throw all of you God
[24:07] keep your people with a common center
[24:13] and keep us in perfect peace whose mind
[24:16] rested only because our hopes tonight

[24:29] shall be sweet for who giveth his
[24:31] beloved sleep granted or take away
[24:35] sleeplessness
[24:37] from some of these believers take it
[24:42] away now father

[24:49] space then all stress that all the work
[24:54] passed away from their mind

[25:01] red color will be bloated up I believe
[25:02] Fed says to not just the Gentiles think
[25:07] about these things
