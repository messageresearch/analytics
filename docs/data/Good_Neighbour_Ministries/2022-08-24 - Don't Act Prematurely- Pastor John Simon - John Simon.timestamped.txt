[32:50] in this time

[32:57] by the
[32:59] opening of the inspired word of god
[33:03] bless us we pray tonight father
[33:06] and may the word of god make itself
[33:09] clear to us
[33:10] in jesus name we ask it amen and amen
[33:15] genesis 3
[33:18] and when the woman saw
[33:21] that the tree
[33:23] was good for food
[33:26] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[33:30] and a tree to be desired to make one
[33:34] wise
[33:36] she took of the fruit thereof
[33:40] and did eat
[33:42] and gave also hunter husband with her
[33:47] and he
[33:48] did eat
[33:51] amen
[33:53] and the eyes of them both were opened
[33:57] and they knew
[34:00] that they were naked
[34:04] and they sowed fig leaves together
[34:07] and made themselves aprons
[34:12] zechariah now four one to seven
[34:19] and the angel the talk with me
[34:22] came again
[34:24] and waked me
[34:27] as a man that is awakened out of his
[34:30] sleep
[34:32] and said unto me
[34:34] what thou see what's his thou
[34:37] and i said
[34:39] i have looked and behold a candlestick
[34:42] all of gold
[34:44] with a bowl upon the top of it
[34:47] and his seven lamps they're on
[34:50] and seven pipes to the seven lamps which
[34:53] are upon the top thereof
[34:56] and two olive trees by it
[34:59] one up on the right side of the bowl and
[35:01] the other up on the left side thereof so
[35:05] i answered and spake to the angel
[35:08] that talk with me saying
[35:10] what are these my lord
[35:13] then the angel that talked with me
[35:15] answered and said unto me
[35:18] knows thou not what these be and i said
[35:22] no my lord and he answered and spake
[35:24] unto me saying
[35:26] this
[35:27] is the word of the lord unto zero bells
[35:31] saying
[35:32] not by might
[35:34] nor by power
[35:37] but by my spirit
[35:39] saith the lord of hosts
[35:42] who art thou o great mountain
[35:45] before the rubber bell thou shalt become
[35:48] a plane
[35:49] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[35:53] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[35:58] grace
[35:59] grace unto it praise god hallelujah may
[36:03] god bless our hearts please be seated as
[36:05] far as the reading of his word
[36:09] and i i just want to take uh
[36:12] a topic is uh of
[36:16] don't act prematurely
[36:19] let us not act prematurely
[36:22] uh
[36:24] don't act before the time that something
[36:26] is supposed to happen
[36:29] and allow god to do his work in his time
[36:35] not in our time or in our feelings or
[36:38] because we get enthused or inspired
[36:42] but allow god to do his work
[36:45] and to move by his spirit
[36:48] like that now i'm saying that
[36:51] because we have come through the years
[36:53] of hearing the word
[36:56] uh
[36:57] recognizing the word
[36:59] we heard the word and we didn't even
[37:02] really understand
[37:05] what we were hearing but something in in
[37:07] our hearts was bearing record that that
[37:10] was thus said the lord
[37:13] we we know it's the truth down
[37:16] in the man on the inside
[37:19] but
[37:20] this up here it was not connected and we
[37:24] could not recognize what we were hearing
[37:28] but as the years as time passed
[37:32] then
[37:34] in god's season
[37:36] when he was ready
[37:38] for us to know when it is time for us to
[37:42] know
[37:43] then we suddenly start to recognize
[37:48] some things in the message in the word
[37:51] in the bible
[37:53] even though we read it so many times
[37:56] but then when the r has come
[38:00] for god's
[38:02] day star
[38:03] to shine upon us
[38:06] then we begin to recognize certain
[38:08] things
[38:10] not that we didn't hear them before not
[38:13] that we didn't hear them preached or
[38:16] said or anything like that but all of a
[38:19] sudden they start to take on a different
[38:23] dimension they start to take on a
[38:26] different presence and power
[38:29] because god's time for that activity had
[38:34] now come on the scene
[38:37] and so
[38:38] the word began to break
[38:41] the day began to dawn
[38:43] the rising of the sun began to take
[38:46] place
[38:47] and the word of god began to make itself
[38:50] clear to the people as the clouds of fog
[38:53] and doubt and fear begin to move away we
[38:57] had to go through years of delusions and
[39:01] illusions and fantasies and all kinds of
[39:04] things because right within the message
[39:09] they're
[39:10] all kinds of religious spirits
[39:14] all kinds of
[39:16] devils of all kinds of doctrines
[39:19] [Music]
[39:20] under the guise of men of god
[39:24] and jesus spoke of this
[39:26] christ all anointed man will arise and
[39:30] say here is christ this is the word here
[39:33] is christ there is the word over there
[39:35] you'll find him there is the word that's
[39:38] what it is and begin to say these three
[39:40] to you but don't you get moved by that
[39:44] stay
[39:45] right in the middle and let the holy
[39:47] spirit lead you and guide you to the
[39:50] perfect light
[39:52] so we come through hearing
[39:56] then
[39:57] we come to the years of recognition
[40:02] a connection began to come between what
[40:05] we
[40:06] her had heard and what we are hearing
[40:09] something begin to register
[40:12] about recognizing what we heard and what
[40:15] we were hearing praise the lord oh my
[40:19] you begin to be able to discern
[40:22] uh between right and wrong
[40:25] between good and evil you begin to
[40:28] discern big
[40:30] what god wants
[40:33] even though it may be true
[40:35] but is that what god wants for this hour
[40:39] you begin to recognize present truth
[40:43] the word of god has applied to this time
[40:47] until this hour praise the lord
[40:50] just as it was with uh luther wesley any
[40:53] class you can't go back and take those
[40:57] words or those
[40:59] things that they had and try to apply it
[41:02] now
[41:03] not that they were false not that it
[41:07] wasn't true
[41:08] but that was for that time
[41:11] it's not to apply to this time
[41:14] hallelujah and even if we use it we use
[41:18] it in its rightful place
[41:21] like apples of silver and pinches of
[41:24] gold amen uh apples of gold and pitches
[41:27] of silver we know how to apply the word
[41:31] we know when to apply the word and so we
[41:35] have come to our as our brother preached
[41:38] to a maturity of the word
[41:42] where we know
[41:44] what to eat and what to spit out what
[41:48] meat to eat and what cherry seeds to
[41:51] just
[41:52] spit it out
[41:53] we know exactly
[41:56] what to invite take in hallelujah and no
[42:00] contaminated food
[42:02] is acceptable to the bride of jesus
[42:05] christ
[42:06] hallelujah now i'm just going to begin
[42:09] now to really uh talk to you praise the
[42:12] lord
[42:13] now uh
[42:14] the time has come now
[42:16] when we are we have arrived where
[42:20] if you're spiritual you know it's the
[42:22] time for acting
[42:26] it's time for the word to come alive
[42:31] it's time for the living word to carry
[42:35] out the acts
[42:36] of the spirit
[42:38] amen hallelujah now the the body has to
[42:42] do that the body of christ has to do
[42:46] that fulfill the word it's alpha it's
[42:50] omega
[42:51] is that right it just what paul had is
[42:55] what the prophet preached and what was
[42:58] back there comes here again because the
[43:01] church edge is coming between and just
[43:04] like that praise god but one is here and
[43:08] the other is here these two olive trees
[43:11] are right there alpha and omega and a
[43:16] one has to come back to the other one
[43:18] amen
[43:19] the word has got to be restored which it
[43:22] has been and the bright tree restored
[43:26] back to its fullness as it was and we
[43:29] know that it is praise the lord so we
[43:32] are here in the time of acting
[43:36] but you see what i'm talking about
[43:39] tonight
[43:40] not because we know we ought to manifest
[43:44] the word
[43:45] or act on the word
[43:47] that we should act prematurely
[43:51] or we should run ahead of the world
[43:56] because that will be you and i
[43:58] trying to do it
[44:01] it's you and i trying to do god a
[44:03] service
[44:04] but not doing his perfect will you see
[44:09] we now as the bride of jesus christ
[44:13] as
[44:14] in the if i use a figure or illustration
[44:18] from the bible it's like ruth
[44:21] who is already
[44:22] in the field
[44:24] amen she was harvesting but the time
[44:27] came we where she's harvesting but that
[44:30] harvesting is going on but she's really
[44:33] now in a state of waiting
[44:36] right
[44:37] ruth was waiting waiting so here she is
[44:41] waiting praise god and she couldn't do
[44:44] anything until boaz comes on the scene
[44:49] and boaz as the head ship when he came
[44:54] on the scene all the other things just
[44:56] kicked in and began to take place
[44:59] because of him and his presence
[45:01] hallelujah that's what i'm talking about
[45:04] that we are not to act prematurely on
[45:08] the word of god but let the holy spirit
[45:11] bring in these things in his time
[45:15] and in his season for his glory
[45:19] don't let's run ahead of god
[45:23] you know there's people love to run
[45:25] ahead
[45:27] and then they act and think that they
[45:29] know what they're doing then when they
[45:31] don't know what they're doing
[45:33] they turn back and start asking you
[45:37] or or or something like that but don't
[45:39] run ahead
[45:40] just wait
[45:42] and let god have his way
[45:44] now let's come to scripture cast some
[45:46] more light on this what are you trying
[45:49] to talk about here praise the lord now
[45:52] uh in genesis as we read and as you know
[45:57] god wanted to manifest
[46:00] his word from way back then
[46:04] he wanted to bring the word into flesh
[46:09] on the earth
[46:10] and
[46:12] in his time
[46:13] not in anybody's time or ease time or
[46:17] adam's time but when he was ready
[46:21] he would want he wanted to bring his
[46:24] word into flesh
[46:26] now it's brought into flesh now but a
[46:29] huge long
[46:31] drawn-out process
[46:33] had to take place
[46:35] uh for us to come here and manifest the
[46:39] word of god
[46:41] not through
[46:42] uh a virgin birth
[46:46] but by a redeemed birth
[46:48] we're able to manifest the word of the
[46:52] living god
[46:54] but now
[46:55] eve
[46:56] had the spoken word of god
[47:01] and god
[47:02] and she understood that god wanted to
[47:05] make
[47:06] his word manifest through her
[47:11] but
[47:12] what the serpent did in the garden
[47:16] he came to her and tried to tell her
[47:20] of another way
[47:22] of how she can manifest the lord or
[47:27] bring the word manifest right bring the
[47:29] word in the flesh praise god but you see
[47:33] he tried to actually what he was doing
[47:36] is try to make a creation
[47:40] or make something before god actually
[47:43] did it
[47:44] he was trying to run ahead of god's plan
[47:49] and he used her by convincing her
[47:54] to accept
[47:56] his wisdom
[47:59] rather than to have faith
[48:02] in the spoken word of the living god
[48:07] and so there she was
[48:09] going ahead
[48:11] of god
[48:12] and he was there
[48:14] uh
[48:15] encouraging her
[48:17] to act on the word prematurely
[48:22] uh before god's time
[48:25] right
[48:25] and promising her all manner of promises
[48:30] amen hallelujah
[48:32] now we know and the bible teaches us
[48:36] that eve was actually
[48:39] illegally
[48:41] seeking
[48:42] wisdom
[48:44] or let me put it so that comes now to
[48:47] our time higher learning
[48:50] she was looking for higher learning
[48:54] and thought higher learning would give
[48:57] her another doorway
[49:00] into the wisdom and the knowledge of god
[49:03] of how to manifest the word
[49:07] and
[49:08] we know my friends
[49:11] that
[49:12] she
[49:13] i don't think she understood fully
[49:16] that that was an act of rebellion
[49:20] against the word
[49:22] it was an act of rejection
[49:25] of the word that god had spoken to her
[49:29] absolutely
[49:30] see
[49:31] and
[49:32] by seeking after satan's so-called
[49:36] higher learning or higher wisdom she was
[49:39] an absolute making herself an enemy of
[49:43] god and rejection of his divine word
[49:48] instead of
[49:50] simply accepting the word
[49:53] and that is very much the same thing
[49:56] happens today
[49:57] when you begin to tell somebody about
[50:01] this word
[50:02] it's too simple
[50:05] to them
[50:06] they got to hear something sounds
[50:09] convoluted and
[50:11] really as they think so learn it and so
[50:15] you know
[50:17] you know it's got to be
[50:19] testified to confirm by this person of
[50:23] note or that person
[50:25] and really all satan is doing is making
[50:27] them move their faith around putting it
[50:29] in some learned man some hero some
[50:32] so-called wise man as long as they don't
[50:34] go into the word of god keep them away
[50:37] and keep their minds on men on higher
[50:40] institutions keep their mind on this
[50:43] this is not to say
[50:44] that to have
[50:46] natural
[50:47] wisdom knowledge and learning
[50:50] for natural
[50:52] um survival that we are not to have that
[50:55] that's not what i'm talking about
[50:57] because because we are caught in this
[51:00] we need that to be able to live in the
[51:02] midst of this
[51:04] all these devils and all these things
[51:06] around us we need a lot of that to be
[51:08] able to deal with it is that right so
[51:11] get that in your minds clearly
[51:14] we're not talking about those things
[51:16] paul even knew about that and he was one
[51:19] of the wisest and most learned men of
[51:21] his day said yes that's good
[51:23] i have all that but i still come to dong
[51:27] and ash that i might win christ
[51:29] hallelujah amen because this one you got
[51:33] to spend a lifetime of learning and
[51:35] knowledge and
[51:37] learning and
[51:38] memorization and this and that and this
[51:41] other one i don't have to have nothing
[51:43] except faith in god and his word
[51:47] and all of a sudden
[51:49] the lightning flashes the thunder roll
[51:52] and god's voice can speak through that
[51:55] instrument that
[51:57] predestinated vessel that he had placed
[52:00] there for that purpose and for his glory
[52:03] amen
[52:05] hallelujah
[52:06] so
[52:08] we find out she was
[52:11] prematurely
[52:12] trying to manifest the word
[52:16] without the holy spirit
[52:19] without the holy spirit manifesting that
[52:23] word she want to find another means
[52:27] to manifest that word
[52:29] and satan presented her with the realm
[52:33] of higher learning and wisdom of man
[52:37] amen praise god so there we see it
[52:41] friends
[52:42] that um
[52:44] a natural woman can certainly do that
[52:48] she can certainly bring forth children
[52:52] but we know that all
[52:54] uh of the human race being born of a
[52:58] woman because of genesis 3 and the curse
[53:01] that god placed upon both adam eve and
[53:05] the earth
[53:06] sorry upon
[53:08] eve the serpent and the earth my friends
[53:12] that all born of
[53:14] women
[53:16] will die
[53:18] the bible says that all will die
[53:21] because that's just the natural birth
[53:25] god wanted her to come and give birth to
[53:28] predestinated
[53:30] that will already come with eternal life
[53:34] hallelujah that will live forever
[53:37] but she ran ahead prematurely just to uh
[53:41] let me see if i can manifest this let me
[53:44] see if i could uh do this you know and
[53:46] and god was not in that amen because god
[53:50] already spoke his word praise the lord
[53:53] amen amen so if the natural what's the
[53:56] types now
[53:58] anything the natural woman brings forth
[54:00] naturally will die it's going to get old
[54:04] it's going to get gray-headed it's going
[54:06] to get weak and it's going to die it
[54:10] doesn't matter how many orbs of theology
[54:12] you give it doesn't matter how many
[54:15] higher learning you give it it's going
[54:17] to die
[54:19] amen in the same way denominations
[54:23] which you know the national church
[54:25] church types of women doesn't matter how
[54:29] many are what healthy looking children
[54:32] they bring forth everyone
[54:34] doomed to die because that's not the
[54:37] word of god hallelujah that is not the
[54:40] word of god the word of god is given to
[54:43] the true
[54:45] born-again believer the body of christ
[54:48] the brain for this hour the word comes
[54:51] to her and through her
[54:53] to manifest the word and to bring it to
[54:56] life for the glory of god
[54:59] twins in the beginning
[55:01] twins again in the end
[55:04] we got modern-day twins here upon us
[55:08] children of the denomination
[55:10] and children of the revealed world
[55:13] they're right here with us
[55:16] oh
[55:17] later we will see how isaiah prophesied
[55:20] in that day the womb the the children of
[55:24] the bond woman
[55:26] will desolate woman will be more many
[55:30] times more amen than the married wife
[55:33] amen
[55:34] hallelujah oh my friends you'll see them
[55:37] growing in thousands and thousands it
[55:40] seems so easy for them to set up a
[55:42] church just build a building before
[55:44] united is filled oh it's just taken over
[55:48] like that amen yes sir we see then we
[55:52] must understand
[55:54] or praise god
[55:56] that the rain falls on the just and on
[55:59] the
[56:00] unjust it falls on the denominations
[56:05] and it falls on the people of the
[56:08] revealed world
[56:10] hallelujah i just want you to know that
[56:13] and they are just as happy as you are
[56:15] happy
[56:16] you see like how we come in here and we
[56:19] are seeing the word and we are getting
[56:21] blessed by the word and we want to
[56:23] praise god we want to shout we want to
[56:26] sing hallelujah amen give glory they are
[56:30] just as happy as you are happy
[56:32] because they are certain that what they
[56:34] are hearing
[56:36] is the truth
[56:38] as much as you
[56:39] believe
[56:41] what you are hearing and seeing is the
[56:44] truth so it caused you to rejoice and to
[56:47] praise the living god hallelujah amen
[56:51] but watch no matter what they do they
[56:55] can't change the god's
[56:58] calculations god's pattern hallelujah
[57:02] every seed must bring forth after its
[57:06] kind
[57:07] and therefore
[57:09] no matter of jumping like the ahab's
[57:12] prophets no matter of singing no matter
[57:16] of musical instrument playing no matter
[57:19] what programs they come up with no
[57:22] matter how big they can grow it remains
[57:26] nothing in the eyes of god hallelujah
[57:29] amen yes sir because why because when
[57:33] you go right back to the origin of it
[57:37] they're coming from the wrong seed
[57:41] and as long as it comes from the wrong
[57:43] seed that seed will only continue on and
[57:46] every other seed it produces is the
[57:48] wrong seed every other seed every
[57:50] thousand seeds is still the wrong seed
[57:52] it'll be written burning forth wrong
[57:53] seed forever until the whole thing goes
[57:56] into the lake of fire
[57:58] and that's why the the scripture tells
[58:01] us that if there's any true seed of god
[58:05] inside of their ranks come out of her my
[58:08] people
[58:09] and be not partakers of her plagues
[58:13] it's her sins it's her plagues it's her
[58:16] evil amen don't drink of the cup of the
[58:20] filthiness of a fornication that is what
[58:24] the filthiness of our fornication is our
[58:26] doctrines it's her teaching amen yes sir
[58:30] oh my oh praise god hallelujah so no
[58:34] matter how they're multiplied amen we
[58:38] see whose kind of seed they're after
[58:42] praise god because the seed in them is
[58:46] wrong to begin with
[58:48] quoting brother branham
[58:51] so then
[58:52] we see
[58:54] that all their fleshly demonstration
[58:57] don't mean nothing to god
[59:01] though i speak with the tongue of men
[59:04] and angels great speakers
[59:06] oh
[59:07] and have not charity
[59:10] you don't have the capstone inside of
[59:12] you
[59:13] it profited me nothing
[59:16] though i give all my goods to feed the
[59:20] poor
[59:21] amen though i start a big charitable
[59:25] institution that's feeding
[59:27] thousands every day
[59:30] hundreds of thousands though i can send
[59:32] ships of mercy i can do this i can do
[59:35] that he said that will profit you
[59:39] nothing when you come to the end of the
[59:42] way for you start from the wrong seat to
[59:45] begin with
[59:47] and though
[59:49] i have faith
[59:51] to move mountains and have not cherry
[59:56] it profited me nothing it comes right
[59:58] back to the gene it comes right back to
[1:00:00] the capstone it comes right back if
[1:00:02] that's not laid in you my friends no
[1:00:06] matter how you can have all the faith
[1:00:09] like brother branham said yeah you can
[1:00:11] have the holy spirit and still go to
[1:00:13] hell
[1:00:14] because the holy spirit is there's
[1:00:16] anointing your spirit and your flesh
[1:00:18] but but that's that gene that soul that
[1:00:21] is inside of there that is not the
[1:00:24] taking the word of god at all and the
[1:00:26] word is just running right off of it
[1:00:28] amen oh my yes sir and if i speak with
[1:00:34] even i speak with tongues like man and
[1:00:37] angels it becomes
[1:00:41] sounding brass in the ears of god
[1:00:43] and tinkling symbols oh
[1:00:47] pentecostals
[1:00:48] that's nothing but a hybrid seed and it
[1:00:52] can't come to the word of god now of
[1:00:54] course when i speak like that we're
[1:00:56] speaking generally
[1:00:59] that doesn't condemn every pentecostal
[1:01:02] because we don't know
[1:01:05] which of god children is still in the
[1:01:07] pentecostal church
[1:01:08] we don't know which of god's children
[1:01:11] are still in the catholic church
[1:01:13] we don't know who is where that's why we
[1:01:17] have to throw out the lifeline that's
[1:01:20] why we have to preach the word that's
[1:01:23] why we have to testify that's why we
[1:01:25] have to tell of his goodness and of his
[1:01:27] mercy that they will recognize who they
[1:01:30] are and their position for the glory of
[1:01:33] god
[1:01:35] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[1:01:38] lord
[1:01:39] now remember
[1:01:42] this
[1:01:44] only the body gives birth
[1:01:48] to christ's
[1:01:49] body
[1:01:51] amen
[1:01:53] and that comes from a virgin womb
[1:01:56] hallelujah
[1:01:58] now i won't take up time with that but
[1:02:00] amen you see the pentecostal
[1:02:03] denominations could not give spiritual
[1:02:06] birth
[1:02:08] to bring forth the
[1:02:10] manifestations
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:13] i see
[1:02:15] and the christ
[1:02:16] also because
[1:02:19] it was only a sowing rain
[1:02:22] that they received and so what they
[1:02:25] brought forth was a denominational
[1:02:28] church
[1:02:29] but not the body of christ
[1:02:31] they did not bring forth him
[1:02:34] so she
[1:02:35] consolidated herself with all them other
[1:02:38] things and evangelicals and so on and
[1:02:41] now she's gone in the way of cora
[1:02:45] amen the gain saying of quora praise god
[1:02:50] so that's what happened without the
[1:02:53] teaching reign of the prophet's message
[1:02:57] and ministry
[1:02:58] all they can do
[1:03:00] is gain say the word or counteract
[1:03:04] or contradict the word of god
[1:03:08] and they contradict the word
[1:03:09] continuously
[1:03:11] speaking contrary to the very word
[1:03:15] that she claims to believe
[1:03:18] but she's speaking contrary to the word
[1:03:21] hallelujah oh my friends i tell you
[1:03:26] i am so happy
[1:03:28] that uh though god opened up his word
[1:03:30] and caused me to be able to see believe
[1:03:34] understand and walk in the light for
[1:03:36] this day and for this hour hallelujah
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:41] you see eve went out and bore fruit she
[1:03:44] got a son
[1:03:46] but it was strange fruit
[1:03:48] it was strange to the word of god
[1:03:51] it just could not fulfill the word no
[1:03:54] matter how he tried he couldn't fulfill
[1:03:56] the word because this gene the seed was
[1:03:59] not in him
[1:04:01] and he couldn't do it no matter how he
[1:04:03] tried but we still have to test
[1:04:06] give the word test to know what's hiding
[1:04:09] where and what is here what is over
[1:04:11] there but if we don't give the word test
[1:04:14] out we won't get back any action for
[1:04:17] reaction to know what is going on around
[1:04:20] us hallelujah so we constantly
[1:04:23] have to do that amen
[1:04:26] hallelujah because when you look at that
[1:04:29] fruit from off of that tree
[1:04:32] it's not a word fruit that will bring
[1:04:34] forth a word seed and you know that
[1:04:37] that's wrong to begin with absolutely
[1:04:40] wrong to begin with
[1:04:42] oh my praise god let me jump over some
[1:04:46] things here now he's gone over here to
[1:04:50] you know adam and eve points to christ
[1:04:53] and to the church
[1:04:54] and you know the u.s dollar he's going
[1:04:57] to talk about the pyramid now and the
[1:05:00] u.s dollar
[1:05:02] and it's called the great seal see
[1:05:05] even the money has to testify
[1:05:08] of god's seal the great seal the pyramid
[1:05:12] oh my and the pyramid never had a
[1:05:15] capstone on top of it see
[1:05:18] but you see that capstone was rejected
[1:05:25] and that capstone is the cornerstone and
[1:05:28] that cornerstone was rejected
[1:05:31] see
[1:05:32] and you see that cornerstone that held
[1:05:36] up the building that keystone okay we
[1:05:40] can stop there he is saying the
[1:05:42] foundation stone the capstone the
[1:05:45] keystone is the same stone
[1:05:47] it's all jesus christ
[1:05:50] that's why he said i am alpha and i am
[1:05:54] omega
[1:05:55] he is the beginning and he is the end he
[1:05:58] is the first and he is the last and we
[1:06:01] praise god for that hallelujah that is
[1:06:03] the same yesterday today and forever oh
[1:06:08] my
[1:06:09] and they don't understand what it
[1:06:12] represents for enoch built it
[1:06:16] amen
[1:06:17] no matter what you hear what books you
[1:06:19] read and what they tell you that's one
[1:06:21] thing but this prophet on the
[1:06:22] inspiration said he not built the
[1:06:25] pyramid
[1:06:27] and that's why they don't understand
[1:06:29] what it stands for and what they're
[1:06:32] doing
[1:06:33] whatsoever amen
[1:06:35] now we see the temple being built again
[1:06:41] we see
[1:06:42] the pyramid
[1:06:44] was
[1:06:45] one of
[1:06:46] uh mortar and rocks
[1:06:49] and you couldn't even run a blade
[1:06:53] of razor a razor blade
[1:06:56] between them rocks the way they were set
[1:07:00] and fitly put together
[1:07:03] like solomon's temple see
[1:07:06] but now god is calling a church
[1:07:10] that is elected by him
[1:07:13] praise god in other words those rocks
[1:07:15] those those uh blocks were
[1:07:18] cut out by him
[1:07:20] they were predestinated by him
[1:07:23] each one with a purpose
[1:07:25] each one to find their rightful place in
[1:07:28] the building of the body the temple of
[1:07:31] the living god and when they come
[1:07:34] together in god's spirit their lives fit
[1:07:38] together so close amen that the devil
[1:07:42] can't pass a razor in between them
[1:07:45] because they are one in jesus christ
[1:07:48] hallelujah oh praise god we don't have
[1:07:51] to put that on the holy spirit is doing
[1:07:54] that the holy spirit is the one that
[1:07:56] does that amen lord of god hallelujah
[1:08:00] amen
[1:08:02] see he is pulling his elect out of the
[1:08:05] pentecostal church that hybrid thing
[1:08:09] but he's pulling them out of that
[1:08:12] he's already saying in other words some
[1:08:14] of them are still in there but the word
[1:08:17] is pulling them out
[1:08:19] and he uses the word i just said pulling
[1:08:21] them out
[1:08:23] what he is now ready to finish up the
[1:08:26] word
[1:08:27] the seven church is
[1:08:29] over and now he's ready to finish up the
[1:08:32] word this this great artist working on
[1:08:35] this body it's about done amen
[1:08:39] hallelujah it come right up as we preach
[1:08:41] but last the sunday before it come right
[1:08:44] up through the foot and right up through
[1:08:47] gone up to the lips and then the seeing
[1:08:49] age with the prophet recognizing that it
[1:08:52] gone into the intelligence praise god of
[1:08:55] breaking the word began to break we
[1:08:57] begin to understand but now the life has
[1:09:00] come back to the body for the glory and
[1:09:03] praise of god so it can move and live
[1:09:06] amen under the inspiration of the holy
[1:09:09] spirit amen because you see it's so
[1:09:13] close now
[1:09:14] when that war
[1:09:16] that word itself
[1:09:19] will blend in with this word here
[1:09:23] you understand oh glory to god that
[1:09:26] revealed word god the lord god himself
[1:09:30] in word form is ready to detail like the
[1:09:34] chinese

[1:09:37] the holy spirit coming down meeting that
[1:09:42] part of god that portion that you have
[1:09:45] in you the gene of god place in you deep
[1:09:48] calling to deep that to blend together
[1:09:51] hallelujah
[1:09:53] praise god
[1:09:55] brother donnie reagan is speaking about
[1:09:58] the blending of that he spoke and said
[1:10:00] he says you know when you blend
[1:10:02] something in a blender you can't
[1:10:04] separate the water from the juice from
[1:10:06] the fruit from the this it's all one
[1:10:10] hallelujah that's why we can say today
[1:10:13] by recognizing the hour that we're in i
[1:10:17] and my father are one
[1:10:20] i'm not only in agreement with the word
[1:10:23] but my nature is the same lord it's one
[1:10:29] hallelujah and therefore unconsciously
[1:10:32] it acts just like that one acted uh this
[1:10:35] one acts the same way hallelujah not
[1:10:38] some kind of put on but it's just a
[1:10:40] natural thing that it flows out of you
[1:10:42] when god needs it to be that way
[1:10:45] glory to god hallelujah oh don't you see
[1:10:49] what this is
[1:10:51] it's getting closer closer closer closer
[1:10:56] now oh my
[1:10:58] come down already through luther and
[1:11:00] wesley and
[1:11:02] and so on and now here come them
[1:11:05] pentecostals restoration of the gifts
[1:11:08] hallelujah and now god is taken out from
[1:11:13] there from all of them
[1:11:16] and holding out a bunch to make a
[1:11:19] ministry just like that word here
[1:11:23] because it's got to fit with this word
[1:11:26] amen because it's got to be that bride
[1:11:30] that he takes up with him
[1:11:32] praise god so it's got to be the same
[1:11:35] word
[1:11:37] same nature
[1:11:39] same everything for the glory of god
[1:11:42] hallelujah
[1:11:43] and christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:11:46] works of the devil amen and his body is
[1:11:50] to do the same because the body this
[1:11:54] body now
[1:11:56] is the head of the body
[1:11:58] coming together
[1:12:01] amen hallelujah christ
[1:12:05] is the head
[1:12:06] the word the body has to be the same
[1:12:10] thing as the head the church
[1:12:13] of the word
[1:12:15] the virgin born from the word the virgin
[1:12:19] born church of the world hallelujah
[1:12:23] glory to god hallelujah and that's the
[1:12:26] way the body operates it operates by the
[1:12:29] head
[1:12:30] my body can't move until my head tells
[1:12:33] it to move
[1:12:36] then he says this and i'm going to
[1:12:38] listen to this close he says now well if
[1:12:41] my body
[1:12:43] is made of flesh
[1:12:45] says listen closely
[1:12:47] my body is made of fla my head is made
[1:12:49] of flesh but the rest of my body was
[1:12:52] made out of concrete
[1:12:55] i'm quoting him here
[1:12:57] he said
[1:12:58] it can't move
[1:13:00] because even though the head may be
[1:13:03] speaking words
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:06] and can say move move move body move
[1:13:11] move you see there is nothing in that
[1:13:14] kind of a body
[1:13:16] to send that message to
[1:13:20] hallelujah
[1:13:21] praise god because it's all concrete
[1:13:25] hallelujah oh my
[1:13:28] oh my goodness
[1:13:30] well but if my head is christ
[1:13:35] and see if my head is christ
[1:13:38] and my body happens to be denomination
[1:13:42] how is that going to be able to send
[1:13:46] that message to that it can't do it
[1:13:49] because it's nothing but denomination
[1:13:52] nothing but concrete it can receive the
[1:13:55] word of god it's how's that going to
[1:13:58] work it will not do it because the body
[1:14:02] always obeys and operates from the head
[1:14:08] amen
[1:14:09] and then
[1:14:10] you see it again
[1:14:12] when a good sainted anointed
[1:14:16] man of god preaching the true word
[1:14:19] go straight uh as straight as the bible
[1:14:23] as he with the bible as he can them
[1:14:26] denominations will just look up at him
[1:14:28] and say
[1:14:30] oh
[1:14:31] no sir no sir get that man out of here
[1:14:34] right now
[1:14:36] amen because it doesn't fit
[1:14:38] with what they have in them it just does
[1:14:42] not fit but when this word goes out uh
[1:14:46] as i am preaching or any other real
[1:14:49] anointed sermon or god is preaching it
[1:14:51] fits something in your heart
[1:14:55] it's not a man putting it there
[1:14:57] it's not a man trying to convince or
[1:15:00] convert you it's the word of god calling
[1:15:03] and pulling it's the word of god
[1:15:05] inspiring revealing making itself known
[1:15:08] hallelujah and trusting that you would
[1:15:11] recognize it amen
[1:15:13] the body does the works
[1:15:17] that the head commands it to do
[1:15:20] but the body is the one that does the
[1:15:24] works amen see that's the way it is and
[1:15:28] he stops now
[1:15:29] he pauses here and he said see now now
[1:15:33] i have been so zealous
[1:15:36] of the kind of seed
[1:15:39] that i
[1:15:40] have been used to plant
[1:15:44] for this body
[1:15:46] and the rain is going to fall here
[1:15:49] real rain will come amen
[1:15:53] and it's got to have seed already in
[1:15:56] there to follow on
[1:15:58] i hope i'm still around and alive
[1:16:01] to see that
[1:16:04] amen when them seeds begin to come up
[1:16:06] praise god hallelujah do you understand
[1:16:09] what i'm saying now
[1:16:11] when them seeds come up it will be
[1:16:15] nothing less than the living word of god
[1:16:18] as it was in the beginning
[1:16:20] hallelujah oh my yes sir oh praise god
[1:16:26] it's the spoken word of god
[1:16:29] has god's power in it
[1:16:33] hallelujah
[1:16:34] it is then him
[1:16:36] in his own people in his own body
[1:16:40] working his own way and working through
[1:16:44] it for his glory
[1:16:46] that's what i'm saying don't let's act
[1:16:48] prematurely
[1:16:50] but let the head
[1:16:52] begin to work through his body
[1:16:55] we don't even know what next he wants to
[1:16:56] do what next he wants to do but all of a
[1:16:59] sudden
[1:17:00] in the quietness when you think oh it's
[1:17:02] just another surface all sudden
[1:17:03] something breaks out and nothing you had
[1:17:05] to do with it it's god did it amen it's
[1:17:08] the holy spirit just broke out with the
[1:17:10] word of god when he chooses to
[1:17:13] oh praise god forevermore hallelujah
[1:17:17] don't you understand we are all now
[1:17:20] coming to that great mount zion showdown
[1:17:23] now amen hallelujah praise god
[1:17:27] then my friends he says then we see john
[1:17:31] twentieth chapter fulfilled oh my
[1:17:35] whosoever sins your remit
[1:17:38] oh to them they are remitted unto them
[1:17:42] and so whosoever sins you retain they
[1:17:45] are retained was he talking about the
[1:17:48] bride having power to forgive sins
[1:17:52] then he says now look at matthew 16 19
[1:17:55] also see now i also will give unto you
[1:18:00] the keys of the kingdom of heaven
[1:18:03] that whosoever use whatsoever you shall
[1:18:06] bind an heart amen shall be bound in
[1:18:09] heaven whatsoever you loosen heart loose
[1:18:13] in heaven amen praise god forevermore
[1:18:16] hallelujah oh my do you know the power
[1:18:19] of this
[1:18:21] understanding of the revelation or the
[1:18:23] message you've received
[1:18:26] amen the power to bind and loose
[1:18:30] uh
[1:18:31] solomon said
[1:18:33] leave one fool in his
[1:18:35] foolishness
[1:18:37] and and this other fool here he can
[1:18:39] learn so you can
[1:18:41] give him hey man
[1:18:44] it's two fools but one fool is taking it
[1:18:46] and the other one don't want it right
[1:18:48] away oh my see so brother bram talks
[1:18:51] about the
[1:18:52] about the mule and the ass
[1:18:55] he says you see the mule is a hybrid and
[1:18:58] no matter what you do he's going to
[1:18:59] remain immune and he's going to die a
[1:19:01] mule he says but an ass in the bible has
[1:19:04] a chance of redemption
[1:19:07] because it's original
[1:19:09] never mind that he was made to be that
[1:19:13] but god made him an original hallelujah
[1:19:17] praise god so he can be redeemed
[1:19:20] no matter who it is you share the word
[1:19:23] of god to them these subjects of course
[1:19:26] i'm not expanding on them i'm just
[1:19:28] passing right over them like this praise
[1:19:31] god but see
[1:19:33] instead of the bride that harlot church
[1:19:37] claims their remit sins
[1:19:40] satan always trying to
[1:19:43] copy god and trying to run ahead and
[1:19:46] trying to do what god's people supposed
[1:19:48] to do he runs and tries to do it
[1:19:50] that way and say he has the power to
[1:19:52] remit sins by by but remitting sins by
[1:19:56] what not the not the power of the blood
[1:19:59] by but by denominational power
[1:20:02] is that right by denominational power
[1:20:06] now uh
[1:20:07] years ago i said it and let me repeat it
[1:20:09] so you might just get a hint
[1:20:11] denominational power and demon power is
[1:20:13] not far apart
[1:20:15] right so
[1:20:17] it's not far apart at all so recognize
[1:20:20] what he's saying here clearly look they
[1:20:23] are saying that
[1:20:24] when and look at their fruit look at
[1:20:26] their children
[1:20:29] they allow them to go to every dance
[1:20:31] hall
[1:20:32] cut off their hair paint up themselves
[1:20:35] like clones
[1:20:37] living with other man's wives flirting
[1:20:40] around on the street mix bathing
[1:20:42] everything else amen wearing short you
[1:20:46] see their fruits show what they are
[1:20:50] amen cutting off their hair wearing
[1:20:53] makeup jesus said by their fruits you
[1:20:56] shall know them what kind of a seed in
[1:20:59] other words
[1:21:00] you will know what kind of a seed they
[1:21:03] are of oh my my my thanks be to god

[1:21:10] day we're living in i'm going to stop

[1:21:19] stopping right now i want you to
[1:21:21] understand that we're in a great time
[1:21:24] but we are in a waiting time
[1:21:27] right
[1:21:29] later on he goes on to say like the
[1:21:31] bride waiting on the rocket ship to
[1:21:33] glory
[1:21:36] says just waiting on that rocket ship to
[1:21:38] take off the glory but that's what we
