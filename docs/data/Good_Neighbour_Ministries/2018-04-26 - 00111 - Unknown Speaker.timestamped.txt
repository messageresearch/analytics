[0:13] father I'm like Zico willing to be led
[0:16] is not about you it's about God and His
[0:20] will for you after all we are all
[0:23] created in God's image and for his good
[0:26] pleasure at the deep end there is
[0:28] complete transformation that's where
[0:33] you're going Saints that's where God is
[0:36] leading us it's the rapture it's perfect
[0:40] cake is completion and it's coming for
[0:46] us righteousness and no matter what
[0:49] you're struggling with what you're going
[0:51] through there's something inside of you
[0:57] and we need to obey and surrender to
[1:00] that you for righteousness you think the
[1:13] season about before us were perfect no
[1:16] they were perfect but their faith that
[1:19] they have in the word God was counted in
[1:22] correctness
[1:27] just like the old Saints of the other
[1:30] times was tripping for righteousness
[1:39] it would God sees you come to that place
[1:42] with him now words aside you think that
[1:45] it's counted for you for righteousness
[1:48] to move forward on the new me
[1:53] amen glory to God in a message today
[1:59] perhaps not to guaran to token just
[2:02] quickly a lot liked it down
[2:05] hallelujah he says we're not to come you
[2:09] know as say well Moses told us the
[2:13] messenger and he said they told us this
[2:15] they told us that we should have the
[2:16] bunny what do you think about boys what
[2:21] do you mean what you think about it
[2:26] there are people that the message state
[2:28] the message preachers saying what do you
[2:30] think about it what do you think about
[2:31] this time we have no right right
[2:35] [Music]
[3:02] we can cut the and greet with the
[3:04] word and everything else but don't have
[3:07] that token what good does it do us no
[3:10] good get beneath it
[3:12] he's not responsible for anybody outside
[3:15] but he's not responsible for anybody
[3:17] today from underneath that token now he
[3:20] has cried out in these last days the
[3:23] Holy Spirit you have to work or what are
[3:28] you doing with it except divided it
[3:35] hacking it into pieces
[3:38] taking what you want leaving what you
[3:40] want out and what you don't want in your
[3:44] life it's going on whether you believe
[3:49] it or not it's going on this is what's
[3:51] happening in the message
[3:58] you are not interested in living it
[4:02] but debating I don't want to be there I
[4:06] don't want to go there
[4:09] that's not where they can be able to
[4:11] suss up where the whole easily is that's
[4:13] not in deep waters that's not
[4:15] experiencing God I just believe it I
[4:19] believe he's a prophet
[4:21] the Bible says the word comes to the top
[4:31] but deeper you stay on fire you
[4:34] recognize the spiritual identity
[4:37] Alleluia or near life is his kingdom
[4:40] contain an inner joint peace growing in
[4:44] wisdom taking these spiritual up keeping
[4:48] feet in other words Satan in his
[4:51] presence what do you feed it up
[4:54] what did it change you what takes up
[4:57] your time what's influencing you we
[5:04] don't we're not we don't you know we
[5:08] don't look at that what's influencing us
[5:12] anymore we can watch anything we want to
[5:17] watch every day that we want to read we
[5:20] can listen to anything we want to listen
[5:22] to it's no problem
[5:23] you don't realize it's influencing I'm
[5:29] not the see I see it if you don't
[5:32] believe what I just said here to see
[5:34] because you don't see there's a dozen
[5:37] tuition is why
[5:44] nobody is exempt nobody can live apart
[5:49] of this word of god too many people are
[5:52] more holier than thou they can do what
[5:54] they want to do they can feed out
[5:57] whatever they want to feed on because
[5:58] they believe they're wholly without they
[6:00] got a revelation you can have a
[6:02] revelation I think it says when you get
[6:07] behind the veil the gods needed in
[6:09] control of your life ain't gonna lead
[6:11] you there
[6:12] he told these into those places because
[6:17] he said he said I'm not on this world or
[6:22] the things in this world the simple
[6:24] thing is really simple but this or even
[6:27] Twitter hallelujah amen that's called a
[6:33] musician so his off mic instead I want
[6:39] to read stories here quickly that really
[6:44] struck me
[6:50] [Music]
[6:54] what kind of thirst do we think was
[6:59] inside we had been Agosto people were
[7:07] beginning to what kind of thirst is in
[7:08] us what kind of verses in me what kind
[7:12] of thirst is in you don't try to hush
[7:15] that only thirst of God there is a story
[7:20] many years ago that I came across with a
[7:23] prospector he was in the mountains
[7:25] prospecting for gold he struck it rich
[7:29] he was coming back thanking to the city
[7:32] that his troubles would be all be over
[7:34] and he tried to say tomorrow just one
[7:37] day's journey if we get into the city
[7:40] and he would have that goal his big
[7:44] sacks full of it
[7:46] he had a dog with him not comparing the
[7:49] dog to the Holy Spirit but as I'm making
[7:53] an illustration here this dog through
[7:58] the night the prospector leaned on his
[8:00] bed and began to think now tomorrow I'm
[8:03] going to take all my gold and I've
[8:06] become just what I've always wanted to
[8:08] be I've always wanted to be a rich man I
[8:11] wanted to own fine things and so forth
[8:14] and then the dog to get the park because
[8:17] there was
[8:22] and he went out there and he said shut
[8:25] up
[8:26] so the thought quite them that's what
[8:29] the Holy Spirit will do sometimes you
[8:31] tell it to shut up and no more then he
[8:35] got back to bed that thought started
[8:37] again just joking and break trying to
[8:41] pull on the chain and going nuts and he
[8:45] went out to the doors shut up I want you
[8:48] to know that's immoral
[8:50] you see that was this great trees what
[9:04] the dog started barking again and
[9:06] finally he got so discouraged he went
[9:08] out to his shotgun that shot the dog and
[9:11] killed him he said I would have need of
[9:13] you anymore
[9:14] however tomorrow operation I think with
[9:20] life in order I've said things in order
[9:23] I've accomplished that I've worked hard
[9:35] he put down the gun in the corner turned
[9:38] his back over to the door went to sleep
[9:40] and the man that had followed him for
[9:42] days wasn't
[9:51] his life was that stadium my brother's
[9:55] my sister's you would never be able
[9:57] don't try to hush that holding calm of
[10:00] your heart see I joined in the church we
[10:03] created them and cream to progress of
[10:06] certain organization or he made even in
[10:08] the message there's only one thing that
[10:10] can satisfy is the person of Jesus
[10:13] Christ as the heart painted when the
[10:15] water broke sold my soul there's not a
[10:18] deal in God my soul thirsts for the
[10:20] Living God there's something in you that
[10:24] once the see you moving to God and more
[10:30] of God your soul is thirsting for it now
[10:33] let's not move anything short of it
[10:35] they'll try to kill that holy hush it's
[10:38] warning you some day you'll come and
[10:42] you'll come to the end of the road now
[10:47] the second story please read into it
[10:49] like this little lady in the city she
[10:52] went to a church
[10:53] she's a Sunday school teacher and she
[10:57] went to this other little girl would
[11:00] love here no makeup on and she wouldn't
[11:05] make fun of her and she said to her if
[11:08] you didn't have that flat head preacher
[11:09] up there
[11:10] speaking of brother Ram you could look
[11:15] like something decent but he looked like
[11:18] something out of an antique shop he said
[11:22] oh she's just really dragged her over
[11:24] the coals every time she seen her she
[11:27] said our pastors broad-minded they don't
[11:30] mean anything
[11:31] are you dressed
[11:32] and how you do these things I would
[11:34] speak but the Bible says so we show that
[11:38] by every word of God this little girl
[11:41] never paid any attention to her and
[11:43] that's the way we should be to them that
[11:45] are are saying what they're saying about
[11:48] you you sisters and go attention to them
[11:54] [Music]
[11:59] she's a missionary now so then this
[12:02] young lady took a source of disease and
[12:05] died a friend of mine Bunton bonded
[12:08] fluid in her as she was dying and told
[12:12] me after she was dead she can't smell it
[12:14] fluid and it was a hole in her side
[12:16] eating that social disease at birth even
[12:19] her parents and all was wrong with her
[12:21] and as she died I give you said as she
[12:27] died and before she died she taught
[12:33] Sunday School she's a good faithful
[12:37] church member all her little Sunday
[12:41] school children wanted to fill up the
[12:43] seat and she went off to heaven so the
[12:46] Angels compact her weight and her
[12:48] perhaps it was outside smoking her
[12:49] cigarette walking up and down the hall
[12:51] in the hospital and doing all that I
[12:54] were to sing as she was going to heaven
[12:58] because they knew she was gonna die
[13:01] the doctor says so they all want to see
[13:06] the angels back of our way and all at
[13:09] once she faced the reality now she was
[13:15] what a church member Sunday school
[13:18] teacher
[13:19] in a big five church well she started
[13:24] the scrubland death and death from her
[13:27] her she said ha

[13:38] out a cigarette quad didn't said here

[13:47] deceiver I'm telling the truth

[13:59] here real quick
[14:01] she's right way to face the reality once

[14:18] education double-barrel shotgun you
