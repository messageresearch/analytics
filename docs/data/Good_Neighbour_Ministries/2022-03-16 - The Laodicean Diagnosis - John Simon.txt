TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord friends it's good to be here again i'm happy to be with you joining our hearts of our hands together in worship and in praise to our great and eternal father and god and may he bless us tonight as we look into the word of god as found in revelation chapter 3 verse 17 praise god and the scripture reads because thou seest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and noise not that thou art wretched miserable naked poor and blind and naked amen a great and eternal heavenly father we ask for your divine presence upon the word and with the word may you lord go forth and send forth thy truth into the hearts of men may the great spirit of god that searches the entire earth his children wherever they are and may you father minister to them words of life that will wake them up and from their spiritual dream and bring them into the perfect realization of the word of god we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise and we pray lord that the spirit of god will go forth now with truth and light in jesus name thank you lord thank you lord blessed be thy holy name amen praise god in our last talk we spoke about the dangers of self-diagnosis where many of us we we just think that we are capable we are competent we are knowledgeable enough and we can just diagnose our problems maybe in some minor senses yes but in most cases no and then we do believe that if we can't diagnosis diagnose our condition maybe we can depend on our neighbors our friends our family they will diagnose for us some person that thinks that they know about these things however we find in most cases without the competent uh diagnosis from a doctor in most cases we begin to wax worse and find ourselves in a more dangerous and difficult situation i want to thank god for doctors and the best of them and the worst of them regardless they if that but they tried to do their best amen and their human like anyone else and they can make mistakes like anyone else but all in all the the true intent of the profession i can't speak for the individual but for the profession is to do the best they can and to help the helpless the sick uh that are out there that they can uh receive some help hope and healing amen but in the scripture we read this is a case of of uh one taking on the responsibility upon themselves and they are saying i am rich i am increased with goods and uh they're giving a diagnosis of their condition of how great it is how healthy they are how wealthy they are how wonderful they are but that is from their point of view for under the discerning eyes of god the great physician who had traveled and walked the shores of of galilee and around the jordan and and judea ministering the word of god and healing the sick and the lame and the lost and lonely this great physician now casts his eye upon this uh patient and the patient happens to be not one standing in the line with brother branham facing the eyes of a prophet on the discernment but this is under the eyes of the god of the prophets jesus christ the great physician under the inspiration of hebrews 4 12 how the word of god is sharp and the discernable with those eyes he looks upon the patient with the name of laodicea and when he looks upon the chart he sees their claims he sees what they're saying and then he says pick up your pen and write and he begins to give his diagnosis of what he sees in the age he begins to tell them what the problems are and his diagnosis is one he sees you uh have become a nest of six or so deadly diseases you're suffering from wretchedness i diagnose you with misery i'll diagnose you with spiritual poverty and i can see nakedness where does this desire come from that makes you cast off your garments tear off your clothing walk the streets that way what's wrong with you something is wrong and a great physician jesus christ is diagnosing this patient from his word and furthermore on top of that you're suffering from an incredible blindness where you cannot see and that leads on to spiritual amnesia which you're also suffering from you see what god saw was different from what they saw or from what laodicea sees about herself she sees that she is rich and increase with goods and spiritually wealthy she sees herself as as a church as a group that has arrived to spectacular success and have need of nothing amen but god saw her condition otherwise and sad you but you don't know you're wretched you're miserable you're poor you're naked and you're blind and worst of it all you're suffering from spiritual amnesia you don't even know it you're unaware of your uh dangerous condition that you're in oh my you see my friends what it is is that the age that eyes of this the people of this age of the gentiles have been blinded by the spirit of god who had blinded the jews so that the gentile age might come in and now as the age is changing again now the gentile church world is being blinded by the spirit of almighty god so that the jews may come back into power and into their position and place in god's great economy you see this little descent church age first of all as we have said wretched so wretched my friends there it is blinded in the hour that they are you see the lord placed the veil over the face of moses a symbol of a avail to be placed over the eyes of the jewish people who to this day cannot see or recognize that jesus christ is their savior is their jehovah is their messiah is the one eternal god and they're blinded to that fact to this hour but what has happened and is happening is that the jew the gentile church world is now blinded by veils of tradition veils of denomination veils of theology culture veiled by false doctrine and cannot see that the jesus christ is the one true god and not three but one god making himself manifested blinded to the knowledge of the truth diverted by the devil into every uh other aspect of the gospel and of the word of god how strange that we live in this age of plenty we're supposed to be living in this great age of progress a great age of abundance and how in the world can there be trials in the midst of such plenty in the midst of such abundance in the midst of such wealth ah so much of everything it certainly is strange because the age is so full with opportunity and everyone seems to have so much even to those who are said to be poor in our midst they are rich relatively to the real hard scrabbled poor in the poorest parts of the entire earth they would be considered wealthy oh there is still so much to be had in our society for those that claim to be very poor we have so many inventions that have been invented to help us with our work so many things have been made to help us receive pleasure out of our life but suddenly we begin to find that instead of people being very very happy they they seem to be having more but yet they are unhappy they're wealthy but yet they seem to be sad depressed miserable wretched naked and blind and they hardly will recognize it and even if they recognize it they will not admit to it for their arrogance and pride seems to have consumed them all together millions are taking sedatives pills to sleep to fall asleep at night and then they rise in the morning and they need to have pills with some pep or pet pills to be able to boost them so they can go out into this uh world and and jostle their way as they claim to the top of success rushing about in every possible way and then uh they find they're miserable they're unhappy and they don't know why because they have everything already but yet they are unhappy they're miserable they're wretched and so before you know it they're taking hallucigenic drugs drugs to make them uh feel happy for uh for a short while and then they're done in the drops they'll take some other drug to give them this high a feeling of a great high and before you know it they're back down in the low they feel like if they're in the mountains in a short while they're down in the valley but we thank god for what he gives the christian joy and speakable and full and full of glory trials make common trials may go but the christian is blessed by their trials but the trials only come to make them strong and to perfect them as they go into the presence of almighty god absolutely my friends and here we live in this age where the people are drowned in the sea of unknown fears they don't know what's coming up on them so they drink alcohol to be able to uh deaden their senses and get in their minds so they don't have to think about it while they're boasting of their worldly goods and the things they have and they're less happy than ever before boasting about their spiritual attainments and yet they're less sure of themselves their lies are filled with all manner of complexes and they don't know where to turn or what to do this age boasts of its moral values but while it's both of the moral values it's the most corrupt age that we're living in since the time of noah and the flood we see it repeating again they talk about their knowledge their boast about their great science but they're fighting a losing battle in every field that you can think of racing against time climate change racing against uh food shortages racing against warming up of the planet their racing against a population increase many diseases appearing on the scenes oh while they're boston one hand of their achievements they're losing on the other hand and will not be able to overcome these challenges whatsoever amen yes sir my their minds can't comprehend the rapidity of the assaults that are coming against them they cannot absorb the buffetings of time and of the devil upon them and the changes that are taking place upon this earth with such increasing rapidity they cannot take it all in and respond to it for it's too much we've gone from the horse buggy bicycle and we've gone into a rocket age a time of of great rocket science oh astronauts and cosmonauts breaking into the unknown realms of space oh friends what a dangerous difficult time that we are living in here together one generation has gone another is here now oh and we find the people so proud arrogant boastful and yet insane refined is a an emptiness and a spiritual darkness that has taken over the minds and hearts of men and indeed we live in this age filled with neurotics filled with neurotics because they're crying peace peace and while they're crying peace wars are breaking out everywhere peace we're going to bring peace we're going to bring peace and more wars are breaking out and they have no answers to those wars whatsoever they're living in for the bible already said there will cry peace there will cry peace but there is no peace said my god towards the wicked and again another one of these diseases is misery not only wretchedness is misery it's horribly enough to be called a wretch or to be a wretch but on top of being a wretch you're also miserable you're a miserable person a miserable age a miserable church a miserable so-called christian all god have mercy their objects to be pitied to have pity upon them but they don't want your pity they don't want your they they scorn your pity they'll mock at you for telling them about pity you're full of pride they don't want your pity whatsoever they just want to vote what they have show what they have display what they have i made it now i'm i'm i'm i don't need nothing now i'm okay i don't need you i don't need him i don't need her i don't need them i don't need the church i don't need god i don't need a bible uh uh all i need is my wealth and my self-satisfaction of myself and family and my church family i'm happy oh i'm happy oh yes that may go for a while but just for a short while and then darkness emptiness and misery begins to set in because inside is us a burning desire that will never be satisfied whatsoever it will not be satisfying the bible says my friends you build upon the quicksands of this human life rather than rather than upon the rock revelation of god's word certainly whatever you have built will fall soon comes earthquakes earthquakes on the earth earthquakes in our lives earthquakes within the church world and then will come the storms of the wrath of god's judgment striking the earth everywhere many years ago the great minister of the gospel one of the great angels of god billy graham preached the message world aflame i believe and wrought a book called our world of flame i believe our world is a flame right now and will be even more inflamed and aflame in the years to come but right now with the booms and the blasts and the explosions like children playing with fireworks god have mercy upon us the lives and of men and women consumed by fire and smoke but by by the hands of other man as the statement was made uh the inhumanity of man to man has now taken place and so we see the darkness of our age everywhere sudden distraction upon us sudden destruction despite all the carnal human preparations for eventuality sudden destruction comes and though you prepare yet you are still unprepared for the extent the enormity the rapidity of what is and about to take place upon the face of the earth yes objects of pity indeed pity all the people that are naturally poor and also spiritually poor right now because we see the ecumenical move taking place before our very eyes when we know that is of satan and pit uh i tell you it's a pitiful thing when you look upon wonderful religious honest good sweet nice people but that's not what this is all about they're all that and yet they fail to recognize that organization its beauty its order its system that's so attractive is nothing but the influence of the old serpent the snake the charming influence and beauty of organization that draws them in and they're blinded to what is out there pulling to them we pity those who boast of their big beautiful churches and their marvelous cathedrals and their they fail to recognize while they're doing that the curse of organization the system yes sir their lovely passengers and homes and mansions given to these uh preachers of this day their great grand choirs a copycat of the choirs of heaven and of the angels yes sir and there religious show off of wealth and all these things taking place in our day and in our time yes their forms of worship beautiful forms of worship beautiful sounds beautiful music but we pity them we don't envy them amen but i tell you in the words of god's servant for this age this 20th century and i thank god that he's given us one major prophet and his name is william marion branham the true angel of god the prophet of god for the 20th century whether you accept it or you deny it it does not change the fact that he is god's pastor prophet teacher voice to this age hallelujah in the name of jesus christ that is the case my brother and there's only one like him there may be others others in the sense of other men of god wonderful man of god anointed man of god gifted men of god or praise god and attacked god for them brother sister but there's only one true god set prophet amen to every age and that one has spoken the word and says back to the old storefront buildings back to those dimly lit rooms oh i know of it i can remember them wonderful marvelous times singing and praising god now tambourines are hated guitars uh some of these musical instruments drums they're not needed we don't want those kinds of things anymore uh we want beautiful music oh but my friends we clapped our hands we rejoiced we praise god in some old garage or in some old dimly lit room some old store front or in some old legion hall or a broken down white building we give god all the praise and the glory from the bottom of our hearts and the power of god fell in the spirit of god moved in amazing ways where people were drawn into god's great presence amen hallelujah back to themselves back to those dimly lit places lesser the world and more of god is what we want amen we don't want to have to make great claims but we want the great god in our lives we want to don't want to just talk about the gifts in the church but we want to talk about the giver of the gifts and to praise him who has given himself as a gift for all all those who are of our present day objects of pity will soon be objects of the wrath of god that has already began to strike the earth oh it's coming it's coming it's moving the spirit of the lord is now taking control as he prepares the way for the departure of his bride hallelujah and that's why the bible further says you have another disease you're poor while you are yet claiming you're rich while the words are in your mouth while you're filled and you're saying i i'm filled i am hungry i'm filled while you're saying that you don't know you are hungry you are empty what you are eating is not going to satisfy you it will just be there for a moment and it's gone you see i'm rich but you don't realize you are spiritually poor and you're devoid of the presence of god amen and that is one of the chief signs as this age closes out upon us is that they we we we develop bigger churches we build better churches and we have the lust for more and more people and more people in there and we crave for more and more uh outlandish manifestations we have entered in to this pentecostal bl frenzy it's taken over the lives hearts and minds of the people where they're desiring something more and more and more and they can't help themselves like that wanting these so-called demonstrations of the holy spirit to see their altar filled with people and the gifts of the spirit in operation but they don't realize remarkable attendance is not the sign of the blessing of god and it's not the answer from god hallelujah because most of the people that comes to the altars there with them go right back crawl back my friends back to their vomit back to their filth back to their worldliness back to their smoking back to their drinking back to the all the old things it's just like a creature from the deep that crawled out for a while makes this claim and then it goes right back to where it came from they listened to the appeal came into god's gospel net but there were not rainbow trout to begin with there were not fish to begin with and turtle like they crawled themselves way back into their own muddy waters amen and they continue to talk about glossolalia speaking in towns they talk about the initial evidence of the holy ghost and claiming it to be speaking in tongues and thinking they are in the midst of a great revival and they're watching and expecting even a greater revival to follow but i tell you in the words of god's prophet america canada have lost their last chance since 1957 amen and now towns is not the evidence of the infilling of the holy ghost but it is certainly the evidence of the handwriting on the wall many many take el you far sin you're weighing the balances and you're found wanting the hour of the wrath of god is ready the angel of death is ready going across the land oh friends there's a marking time and a ceiling time now going on where the beloved of god are being marked and sealed from that day which is here upon us this time while the people are enjoying belshazzle's feast of plenty belshazza's feast of pop of lust while the people are enjoying their dances with the devil while they're enjoying their striptease dance tripping the church of every doctrine of every truth of every word of every revelation they should have they're being explained away they're being torn away they're being taken away and the true church being strict of the strength of its beauty and of the graces that god has given to the church amen and all we see is the laughter all we can hear is the murmur of the madness of this this trunk that has been carried away by their misery and their spiritual poverty and the hand is writing on the wall and telling you this is not the sign of revival this is the sign of judgment upon the face of the earth not just upon babylon natural babylon back there but judgment upon the earth and upon mr babylon the system that is running and moving and influencing the earth we know the bible says don't you know that many are going to come in the last day reading lord lord have we not done many wonderful works in thy name even to the casting out of devils and he will say depart from me you walkers of inequity remember these men were casting out devils these men had healing revivals these men had genuine uh things taking place with them and amongst them judas himself was one of them and what did jesus say workers of iniquity why they did not have the revelation of the word and if they caught even a little bit of it they knew what was right but didn't do it and didn't obey what god's word said to them man that can come pray for the sick my friends oil and blood and everything on the platform like that all men are supernatural and that alone will cause people to gather around them and and yet my friends living without any moral values on clean living drinking carrying on oh they get exposed the people see it and yet they're left alone why because well you know god is doing this god is using him anyhow and so it must be god and that's how we find our age is so spiritually poor oh my poor and poverty stricken to the core and they don't even know it furthermore our scripture says you are blind and naked an age that is blind and naked how can one be blind and naked and don't even know it how can you be blind and so naked and yet you're going out into the streets flaunting yourself of this great big church at the corner of the street corners and don't know that you're naked and you're miserable and blind yet my friends this can be clearly seen in the story of elisha and gaher's eye when they were surrounded by the syrian army and remember it was the prophet the very message of the prophet that smalled them blind for the prophet small the syrians blind and but what kind of blindness that was for it was a peculiar blindness their eyes were open they could still see naturally but yet there were blind for they could not see elijah elisha nor the hezei they couldn't see the prophet like many today cannot see the prophet's message neither can they see the the his helpers they can't see the message whatsoever they can't see where they're going they can't see where they're headed and so there's a peculiar blindness going on now where those people will argue debate and tell you we are not blind we see we know we know the greek we know the we know all of the aramaic we know the languages we know the grammatical uh way of putting this over we understand that we have translations we have various things that can prove what we are saying and they'll prove it to you and make you look simple and on no body while they elevate themselves with a great pride you see but certain things they could see other things they could not see they could not see elisha no hazel they could not see the camp of israel that was there and today what do we have a prophet again has preached the word blind in the eyes of some open the eyes of others until they can't see the revealed word of this age they are we live in they cannot see our sense oh the power and the presence of the eternal messenger from heaven the mighty angel the covenant angel christ himself revealing himself the god of the prophets come with his own word to interpret his own word amongst his people and yet they're looking back at the john the baptist of the age not recognizing him the mighty god hallelujah on the scene they can't see the crossing we've come to the crossing ending of the seven church ages and they can't see the crossing the gap between the ages and the capstone they can't see the crossing over from the seven day week of the seven church ages into the eternal church age under the inspiration of the eternal heaven sent messenger from heaven not men of earth no man no man no group of men but invisibly eternal messenger from heaven jesus christ come down to walk among his people share his self and his presence oh god and to reveal him his own word to his own glory to god they can't see this church age capping the ages off hallelujah and because of that they cannot see the unfolding of the rapture revelation taking place right before the very eyes abraham and sarah transformed from all to new from all to young the mighty god working upon the bride and her change has taken place amen the body changed now in progress the rapture now in progress the translation now in progress not speaking in towns but the new towns of the holy spirit taking a hold of the hearts and the lives of god's people o blessed be his name thank you lord thank you jesus amen my friends people believe they have it all and they know it all and they can't be taught they wouldn't listen to anyone unless they you arrive to a place where you are acceptable to their tastes uh then they will listen to that and you'll have to you imagine that you'll have to produce all kinds of certificates of recognition uh and credibility for an acceptance before they will even listen to what has to be said not realizing that they should be having an ear to hear the truth the revelation of the word of god amen yes sir i want to know how many of god's people today have their heirs really open to the truth god's great prophet has said there's only one percent let me repeat there's only about one percent that really genuinely sees and accepts the truth of god's word and we must accept all scripture for all scripture is given by inspiration and profitable for doctrine for reproof and for correction amen hallelujah my brothers and sisters god furthermore says you're blind or can you imagine something as tragic as that a man that is blind trying to cross a busy street with trucks and cars going by at tremendous speeds and when you step up to him and say sir uh can i help you go across the street so you won't be harmed and he he knocks your hands away and says no leave me alone you're the one thinking i can't see but i can see i know where i'm going i know what i'm doing and he strikes your hands away and he continues walking out into the dangers of the traffic that is taking place my friends there's only one answer that man is living in a state of oblivion his faculties are gone he's suffering from a form of insanity he is suffering from spiritual amnesia and is not recognizing he has lost his identity he has lost my friends all of his uh of himself and now is groping around in the darkness of insanity and still confident that he knows who he is he knows where he's going and you can tell that he is spiritually blind wretched naked miserable and don't even know it oh my can it be that the scripture is being fulfilled that man has put god out of their minds romans 1 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do things which are not convenient amen my friends here's a people today who are saying we are of god we are god's people we have the holy spirit and yet they live act dress and move spiritually naked blind and don't know it stripped of their doctrinal truths and strength satan has stripped them completely for his own dance of seduction oh god have mercy already deceived and having a wrong spirit upon them but thank god jesus said the elect cannot be deceived and will never be deceived thank god forevermore hallelujah praise god they've become blind because what they refuse the word of god they refuse god's word and because of that they have become spiritually blind they did not heed the word and they opened the door for the devil satan to come in and strip them of every truth every revelation from the word of god the entire armor of god was stripped away and taken away from them their wedding dress of the pure word of god was taken away and the bible said they're naked by leaving god's protection like eve did leaving god's care amen yes sir and they sought out their own ways oh there's a way that seemeth right until man but the ways thereof are the ways of death yes certainly my friends how we see them going out there building their own modern day religious church towers of babel amassing of wealth of manpower when the bible tells us in mr babylon will be found slaves the souls of men god have mercy upon our wretched and wicked age in which we are living in they appear to themselves that they are so dressed so beautifully their religious pageantry is to be admired the original religious pageantry is very eye-catching the bells the sound the the beauty of the presentations uh wonderful indeed but empty empty as a sounding drum as a tinkling symbol empty for it has not the capstone it has not the truth it doesn't have the revelation of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever great assemblies great conscious great conventions empty of christ talking about christ but not having him talking about having the holy ghost and not having him talking about all these things and empty of it all whatsoever the organizations have led them into the camp of the antichrist and into the fields not of wheat but lead them into the the tears a field of tears oh my take god he has taken us out thank god he has taken the lilies out of the fields and leave them with a field of tears and there they go my friends ready for their binding and burning as the judgments of god are here upon us indeed they have become objects of pity and we pity them very much so and yet we try to warn them they will not listen you pity them they scorn you you beseech them and beg them they think you are weak they think you're foolish they take your talking nonsense they want to get away from you as quickly as they can they they'll walk away they'll go on the other side of the street whatsoever while you are trying to reach them with the truth of god amen still they go on headway over the cliff or going to their own destruction oh rightfully turning away any and all attempts that we might make to save them and bring them into the realms and ranks of jesus christ and in the great shining light of god's word for the age that we're living in head long to their own destructions miserable indeed yet they know it not their consciences their conscience and their consciousness have become so calloused and hardened beyond hope that what they are now glorying in is really their shame it's really their destruction defiant against the word of god like cain was the same spirit of cain upon the people rebels against the revelation fighting against the word of god and yet one day they will be judged by it judged by the very word of god they rebel against amen and they will pay the price of its awful indictments may god have mercy make this god who is so rich in mercy have mercy upon these poor wretched souls who don't think they're wretched who don't think they're miserable who don't think they're poor when they have naturally overflowing with goods or flowing with everything everything should leave grand that churches feel overflowing with thousands of people and every everything naturally they can see that but spiritually they are blind to the truths of god's word may god bless you my friends and may the word of god shine brightly and bring you into more reality of the fullness of the word of god now next wednesday we will no not be on line preaching like this but we will be in the sanctuary where the word of god will be preached and declared to you and may you take advantage of it and be blessed by it for the glory and praise of the living god at that time we will be talking and speaking on the god's final advice to this age may god bless us all when we come together like that to receive every blessing from the presence of almighty god [Music] you
