[Music] [Music] [Music] press it up because the work is moving on anybody and his sons and daughters of God we must press on glory to God gonna get brother ground coffee just 5-10 minutes where's brother copy I guess okay anyways praise God for evermore god bless you I trust that your week is going to be week and that you were under expectation this morning coming into the house of Lord he covered the house and Lord for one reason to meet with the morning you know why he came through this morning come in to meet with one another although it's a wonderful thing right when we come together with the understanding in the revelation that were coming together to finish the work and to receive instruction because the Lord has for each and every one of us as as we come ahead brother coffee as we prepare for this great event then we're of the midst up right now which is the rapture of the church [Music] so rich so I go to him to just sit and listen to is me [Music] [Music] and I was introducing to be introducing to the other so I came home as soon as I hit his friend I was wonderful cells so pasta [Music] [Music] so we everything [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because move the subject to the sills is so forest for them God and if y'all don't I speak yourself let us all together you're not praise god that's a wonderful report you can see what's going on out there this is the time where God is dealing and perfecting his church he's dealing with the Bride of Christ wherever she might be and you know here there there's you know deacons rising up in the church that are plotting against the pastor's all kinds of stuff that's going on but you know when God sends his ambassadors they come acquainted with his spirit and then all of a sudden things can easily get exposed you you don't realize what you are and who you are you are ambassadors of God God anoints you and places human - the body of Christ is because he's planning about using you to perfect this church and to the drum to get it prepared to accomplish that which we know is going to take place which is the rapture amen uh spot over here amen praise God Pastor Simon is in New Mexico he's ministering there he met while he was in Colombia and they established the relationship and he was asked to go to Mexico and so continue to pray for him and we'll be back on Tuesday by the grace of God and trust that the Lord will just do whatever it is that he needs for sending us where he says this but this morning we've come together because we're interested in what God has because that's what excites children of God and that we're not just a normal Church this is not just another Christian Church mystery we have something fresh something new because God is a living God that's a president we don't have any of our own thoughts right it is we just want to we just want to convey what the Lord lays upon our heart see even God has a five-fold mystery in this our that's anointed to do the work that needs to be done in order to get this church placed into each position us please seem so that he can he can seal it up you know we're gonna be looking at that you know I just had such a wonderful time you know when study yesterday last night I just I read and I listened while I was reading you know the beauty of the table you know you don't you know the table up is that you can actually read and listen to the Prophet as he speaks and it just it just brings it in such a different way like you know try it do it and just get along you know I just rejoiced in the Lord last night listening to the adoption fourth book in the adoption series and it was just tremendous I cannot convey to you what the Holy Spirit revealed to me personally because this is a personal walk with God but you need to get into that realm of faith where you know that God is moving individuals right now this is a personal block this is a walk with God it's it's important that you recognize that that's how it is that God is bringing this church together he's dealing with individuals and he's bringing those individuals together to unite in the body of Christ because once you unite under this revelation of the present truth you'll be seeing let's go to the message so our title this morning is the rapture the Bible it's part five we are continuing along the same thought you know it's been a tremendous time for me just in the study of all these books of the adoption and the book of Ephesians you know you really need to go back and read the book of Ephesians after hearing after you know receiving the Word of God through these services I believe that there's a revival that's taking place right now that's reviving people individuals in the message that in the message for years years they turn about the rapture you know but but this is a progressive revelation that God is taking us at moving us into so that we can receive perfect faith individually and so that we can when they operate in our office were not the bulletins because we just joined the church or we you know because we just belong to a church it's because you've recognized that you are the church you are the body of Jesus Christ if you are the the one that he talked about when he talked to by the scriptures that I'm gonna have a church without spot or wrinkle and that is the church that he's working on right now the individuals that he's worth amen and so the title of this morning in this fifth series of the fifth part in this series is the spirit and the bride say company next the scripture says this morning that's all steady it's from revelations 22 verse 17 and we read here and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come you know you you know care what what is it that you're hearing him back here so he's he's showing here that there's a spirit and then there's the bride but the bride needs to hear something that he is speaking so that she now can sing the same thing you know read the scripture and Emmas let's get on a description what the Lord wants to reveal to us this morning and then him that heareth say come and that him that is athirst come so you could be somebody that's not quite there yet you know you're wondering but you've been you've been serving the Lord for many many years and you want to come to that place where God becomes a reality you as an individual in that you can you can actually be a part of what God is doing amen and he says it's so cute if you're thirsty and you come also and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely this is free this is the water of God's Word upon his election scene [Music] father we thank you this more to be Lord we are excited about your word father because we know that you come into the midst of your children when we gather of this revelation that you've placed in our hearts that there's a church in April of 2019 this body is all over the earth it's not just here our good neighbor ministries but it's a body that's called earlier but because you are the same yesterday today forever you are revealing one truth you are not the author of confusion you are bringing forth the word that is going to get this bride ready and prepared so that we can go to the next stage of our ministry blessed prosper Lord remember our pastor this morning as he brings forth the word in the Mexico may you anoint him and use him in a supernatural way Lord let there be light in this hour of bring darkness Lord take control of mind the speaker in here and take us into heavenly places in Jesus presence praise God what a wonderful scripture the next says here for the premise know this is that the description that we took that we've been working with all over the series and just you and him the whole building this is the amplified version in him the whole building is journi together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord the whole building you too are being built together to become a bully in which God Blizz by this spirit praise God and so you as individuals are being filled with the same spirit that was impressed because the body doesn't have a different spirit there's only one body and you know we've talked about how God is restoring what he had back to the Garden of Eden when he desired to express himself onto this earth because we're here still hurt right and so when he expressed himself here on earth he did so by expressing which was in His image and just like gardening if the church is mrs. Jesus and so this body now is what body we're not looking for you know different interpretations we're looking for what interpretation of the Word of God that is going to bring the church together into one body she would be filled with the Spirit of God and she's going to be anointed to be a change from Mortal to immortal that's what the rapture is all about praise God so this is an earthly plan so we have to come into our earthly position as sons and daughters of God placed into the body of Christ and then receive an anointing on our lives here on earth you as an individual here on earth listen you're gonna have listen we have a ministry right now but there is going to be a progression to this ministry that is it's going to be a miraculous ministry it's going to have miracles signs and wonders just before we leave here there's going to be a great display of this attention because God is going to indicate to this whole Christian world and the whole world in general because of all these different teachings Buddha must woman all these are the top is the one and only true God and that he was behalf of people here on this earth that he was going to vindicate his work through and so you can receive this and and be positionally placed into that body you are going to be a supernatural race you were going to be a supernatural people you can do supernatural things you're already doing supernatural things if you haven't noticed it but it's already happening praise God next slide brotherbrother says here we've got a ministry Cody that's just exactly like the life of Christ is what we're talking about what does that ministry identify it identifies the coming of the Lord that's what did I bet about God is going to show himself the Lord Jesus is going to show himself in a church here on this earth before we leave to prove that he didn't have a ritual true church because he got so many different denominations out there you don't know what to believe but bodies that have indicated through the manifestations of the sons of God that he has a true church not that saying good neighbor ministries is the only church if you've come here this morning with the idea that these all may be this church here you know they think that there's something better than anybody else or that they've got you know they know that's not what this is about we assemble here we are not an organization of the Botox if you want to know about two paper ministries it's very simple open the book of Acts and look exactly what the Apostles did while they were anointed by the Holy Spirit that's why we baptize us because he hoped to the book of Acts the only baptized athletes they didn't baptize children they baptized individuals that said what prevents me from being baptized because they heard the word the Spirit of Truth they heard the Holy Spirit Jesus said what when when I was send you the comforter the comfortablee to indict you into all truth and there's only one way that man was ever baptized according to the scriptures and that wasn't the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we get baptized we do it not because we think it's the right way to do it not because the word says so and if the word has been an honor the word that we as individuals have to manifest what the word says that's why when somebody says to me doesn't matter I see well you have to take that up with the work because I see very clearly in the word that you need to repent which means to turn away from your teachings your thoughts your ideas of your interpretation of God's birth and you need to come to us provided with in the book of Acts chapter 2 verse 38 when Peter was filled with the Holy Ghost and come out ministering to the people 3,000 individuals all kinds of different interpretations of God the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ in the scripture I believe you can't show it to me it's nowhere to be found well that Jesus had preached to all nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit that's exactly what he said but he also said just before that he said all power has been given unto me in heaven and other Ana he did say some power because some people say oh you know that there's three coffee odors the Trinity no such thing as a traitor it's done he said all Papa even say a third part of it he said all power and they lived up to me it was the Lord Jesus speaking Matthew 28 you know all the power that means there's no other power anywhere else it's all in him the people in the remember Peter was right there these ten 2720 will be when he was resurrected Peter was right there listening said yeah I know exactly what you're saying you are the Messiah you are the Christ Jesus and that's why he talked to the basics this morning but you see if you don't have the foundation right you can never build anything but it's gonna fall you're gonna be on a sinking sand if you don't have a proper foundation which is a rock a solid rock of revelation that God is one God his name is the Lord Jesus Christ the scripture says in all that you do in word or deed do it off and make you [Music] so now you've got a good foundation to start with now you can build something that we can move on and you can actually receive the word and actually be placed and adopted into the body for the church to positionally find its place that's the rapture the Holy Spirit displays God's power through each of us as a means of the entire church you see what is saying there that this body that receives the Holy Ghost you as an individual like you were placed into that body position and upgrading my faith in that body it actually identifies the entire church it brings the entire church on the scene that's why you're so important that's why you know he couldn't leave on this series and the water I look at it the more I see how rather than informant is for each and every one of us to see our positions in the Word of God our spiritual disease next but the writer says here here is the secret the word is in the prop and the muscle of Christ to know what he was done with see how can you know what God wants done with the word if you're not even in the body because this is this is the body [Music] and seen this to do i cannot communicate to your body and tell us what to do yeah we cool it with aerobics class by the same timeframe or whatever you would do all that I'm talking about the unseen the thoughts the revelation of God when it comes to the body it's making its mystery though to the body Christ we've read in the book of Ephesians how God is making his this mystery known to the body because this is not going to be a public show this is not going to be because everything is given like like you can go to google search and say how do I go throughout you don't get a thousand different interpretations of that because it'll be all kinds of different Christian teachings but what the Holy Spirit gives you a divine revelation because you're in the body of Christ and you and you now have the mind of Christ because that's what it says here to know what he wants the word and she doesn't in his name she has thus saith the Lord then jerk that it is germanized so Holy Spirit waters it until it is brother that serves his purpose right there is the book of Ephesians because you have in you the Spirit of God which he says now he places thus saith the Lord into this last church because she has a great part to play in the rapture she has to speak because she is Christ in pride for remember he gets restored after those restored when Christ came to the earth he has to be restored in these last days which is to church the bride the other part that has blood with God which is one of the price and she is given that same Authority she's given that same lady to speak the Word of God in order to speak the rapture into existence you see you think you know like a little bit you know I speak something you know or you know when you're you know most the time you don't you realize what you're speaking the word I'll tell you right now most of the time unless you're able to keep you here in Europe your lives through this and God comes to you shows you certain things you know that you're bringing forth but as individuals all performing our parents and our purposes there's times where you'll fellowship you'll speak to somebody and the word is being revealed through you it's being spoken it'll get spoken to our children and we think all but we've got to see it come to pass ran away mm it needs to be [Music] that's been spoken to this situation [Music] [Music] felt blessed a couple of that fell or inspired by the love of a cop it changed me in my attitudes in the way that I look at situations the way that we perceive situations maybe you know because you're still human you are a human being as long as you are on this earth you are going to be in a human vessel and you are going to be susceptible to mistakes do things you're gonna say things there's gonna be things about you sometimes it's not you it's not it's like all of that each of us has a heart each person alive as a slightly different pattern she to the level you're not there's not one of you that's exactly the same everybody's got a different DNA God didn't create clothes not created sons and daughters God has given each of us a unique emotional perfect people get to know we have obviously very passionate you tell me you do become free sighs well that's we got nothing then you talk to this one where you come you never know about this person's thing because they don't feel any emotion at all you want to get a stethoscope you see God's decided everybody differently all he in a certain way but God now for the body of Christ there's a reason why he dealt with the heart there's a reason why when we look at the scripture we don't look at a few scriptures this morning how God is dealing and he says that each of us has a unique emotional therapy that races when we encounter activities subjects circumstances that interest us we instinctively feel deeply about something's and not so deeply about these are natural things that are likely to recognize because it has to do with your position in the body keep your thinking caps argue the body uses the term heart to represent the sector of your motivation desires and inclinations next the scripture says delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart you know that if you look at desires the word desire means of the Father these are things that God places in union and and like you said you know there's listen if you are a son or a daughter of God it's because we're an attribute of God may be a sucker in the heart of God never had a beginning because it is a part of God and God is eternal directness and to try to make simplicity earth God is eternal so if you are a son of God then you are eternal also you are just and actually that was expressed from God you're still a part of God forgive me and you are actually a God as an individual not be thought but as the Son of God you are a part and so as individuals God is not attribute because there's not enough everybody that's out there there's people in the world that are not sons and daughters of God I can show you this picture that I'm not telling you something that's not in the scripture yet there are children of the light somebody talks about children of the darkness God is right there is children of God the Bible talks about and then there are children of the devil because in the dirt revealeth with with the sin took place there was two children born in blood was born as be salt of the serpent that's why spell serpent seed that's why it had enmity against his brother Cain and Abel Katie was the serpent seed Abel Abel was son of God you should be in the scripture where it said cables the Sun duck awfully word said Abel us you see nothing on the description and what happens even God at the scene of the death killed his brother because it was a murderer from the beginning and it's just that simple thing you talk to people about the dog surfing if what they love with the distant he didn't give her an apple he gave her his interpretation of how to bring forth children on how to multiply how to be a creator she saved is an impersonator God created by the smoke or Satan created by procreation I've taken a serpent using the hip and the serpent was an upright beam that was very close to to man but he wasn't quite that a very close that he could actually mingle you could talk he wasn't bringing it over here sometime I'd like to see him but they said no the circle was a snake he talked about telling you the serpent was an upright being that was just almost perfectly better and he had the ability to make love to eat and say no eating create we can be like God because Satan is always trying to be like God we can create so he he it took Eve and he shook her sex she got her pregnant she went out of Anatomy exactly as his old fix this thing so he had to take on just took on Scylla to redeem you [Music] and so he did the same thing but you see Adam was a southern cop and he just had the ability to bring forth after his glory to God you see and so this all planned now is up because God has sons of God attributes and he reserved the place in the body something let's continue so delight yourself in the desires of your heart next scripture back in 1235 a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things an evil man of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things you see that's why you look evil [Music] because this hasn't been transformed it hasn't been perfect it has it it doesn't have representation it doesn't have the representation of Christ in there and that's right you know you as individuals you know sometimes we eat you got a check you got search your heart about situations and circumstances they can deal with as a son of God that's your heart determines why you say the things you do why do people pleading to do for the word God is alive and active sharper than any double-edged sword it penetrates even to the dividing soul and spirit joints and marrow it judges the thoughts and the attitudes of the and so you as an individual you wonder why you act or you say some
