spirit upon us and bless us together as we gather in his name we thank god for every one of you and for those of you who are here present with us may you enjoy his presence and may the lord bless every one of us together now tonight we are in the subject of the climax of the gentile ages and revelation chapter 3 of course we'll touch on that praise the lord 3 11 and 12 12 13 behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown him that overcome it will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches let us pray great holy spirit we pray father that you will come upon us bless every one of us gathered here tonight in your divine presence it is our request that you draw near to us may your spirit rest settle above us like the pillar of fire did over the tabernacle that was in israel now we are here as living tabernacles may nice great spirit overshadow us bless us and quicken the word quicken our understanding warm our hearts in thy presence father and to thee we give all the glory the honor and the praise amen and amen god bless you please be seated where you are now of course laodicea is the last of the seven church ages which we began and as you know it began with the ephesian church age of course but it's the diagram is right behind me so you can see everything up there but everything that has been happening during these seven church ages are now coming to a fruition all the seeds of good and of evil that were planted from the very beginning have now grown through the ages and are coming to their harvest time now we know that both vines will yield their final fruit good or evil but they will all bear their final fruit whatever and of course their end will come at their destination because one will be caught up in the presence of god and the other one their destination is to the pits of hell destruction the sowing the planting the sowing the watering the growing of those seeds have all been taking place during the ages god using not farmers but different preachers and teachers to plant the seed within the heart of believers that would believe it and receive it with all their hearts but you see now we've come to the time when the summer is ended autumn is here it's the time for the grain to be gathered in into the garner and the barns and the spirit of god in this time it's a time when the redeemed are gathering in wash like the snow and free from all sin god's spirit is drawing his people back to his word back to his presence there might know him remember god is a spirit so when we say know him come in contact with him we can't yet see him with our eyes but we can sense him by our spirit our soul that is within us amen because remember you already have those senses we have built like god god said they're in my image right so as i've said to you before even if your back is turned and somebody came and stood behind you you're going to say oh you felt somebody standing behind you you sense somebody standing beside but that person hasn't touched you how did you feel it you did not feel with your hand or your feet but your felt with your soul on the inside it could sense the presence of something unseen behind praise god well god is a spirit how are you going to know when he's near you because you come into a service like this and then you you sense the presence of god the holy spirit begins to draw near to us the word of god begins to embrace our hearts and our minds and begin to reveal himself to us and we begin to recognize that the lord is nigh the lord is near amen yes sir praise god so we are faced with the false church and with the true church and its harvest time as we have said now when we read in the book of revelation chapter three god spoke clearly to ledician said i know thy works i know your works and then he outlined them first of all uh god mentioned that they were self-opiniated because thou says you're saying you've got your own opinion about yourself and you've got your opinion about what you think and about what you have accomplished and what you are but god says there you you got spiritual amnesia because no yes thou not you don't even know what condition you're in you don't even recognize what state you are in so their cells opiniated they had spiritual amnesia and on top of that god said you're wretched oh my are rich then he says not all you're wretched you're miserable uh you're in your wretchedness and in your wretchedness internally right you're internally now you're miserable you're always depressed you always got internal struggle and upheavals mental problems oppressions you're miserable wretched and spiritually you don't have any spiritual character you're naked you're blind and you don't even know it because you don't recognize your position in christ you don't recognize your position in the word of god on top of that you're blind i know we have read these scriptures over and over but watch the outline of the various things that this patient has in their life and why they're going to die because they have the disease of self-opinion the disease of spiritual amnesia the disease of wretchedness the disease of being miserable and on top of that they got their eye disease they're blind blind now if a man is blind and he is willing to accept your help in taking him across the street well that's marvelous wonderful but if that guy is blind a woman is blind and still think they know and still think they can see whatever how are you going to ever be able to lead them across the street they refuse your help because they're blind to the dangers that they face they're blind to the things that are coming by oh my and on top of that they're poor spiritually poor you might be a billionaire in this world but in the sight of god you're poor if you don't have faith in the word of god that will change your life on top of that you're naked look how many things that they really have you're naked naked of what you're naked of the robes of righteousness you're naked of the word of god to cover you to be your protection you're all in all you're proud arrogant and on top of that they're religious you're religious you know what the word was talking about back in that book of revelation this day the religious spirit that's upon the people in this name they religious and with their religiousness they become arrogant they become proud they become naked miserable and so on in the presence of god hallelujah amen but my friends look at the contrast between the these religious church followers and the overcomer or the true believer oh my to him that overcome it thou grant to sit with me in my father's throne amen praise god in other words how you gonna sit in the throne i have to exalt you i have to rapture you out of here i have to take you out to be able to put you in that position amen praise god also you've got to see that there is a relationship between the lord and these two parties he has one relationship with the false vine and he has another relationship with the true bride of jesus christ amen because he has come back now to gather one and he is back now to bind and burn the other set for right now he's already binding them into denominations they're being bound into those uh what you call them bales or whatever you see in the fields that the farmers have bound up there that's why they're different different churches different churches they got them all around and everything else and they're all over the field but he's just binding them together for the burning is that right now so we see this is all taking place amen but now is the reaping time this is not a time for planting so much as for reaping because you've come through spring come through the hot sun of august summer oh now the time of reading harvest times upon us time for the sickle to go in time for god to send the angel messengers to bring the word of god that will separate the seed from the tears from the weeds amen yes sir we all been in the weeds how many of you know you've been in the weeds you couldn't see the word you couldn't understand the word of course you know about the bible maybe i even went to church i went to church we have reading the bible for years but then all of a sudden when god began to open up that word to my eyes to my the eyes of my heart the bible became a new bible oh praise god forevermore hallelujah amen and i'm still changing i'm changing to this very day oh praise god i feel the power to change upon me not only at the rapture but the change taking place now the spirit of the living god promised in this last day he will be upon his people he'll briefly walk in the light as he is in the light amen what light the light of the world when the bible opens it shines understanding on the word and you begin to realize what you what was sitting there all the time amen an unused book that was just sitting there but in that book is life eternal oh blessed be the name of the lord amen matthew chapter 13 when you have the time to read it matthew 13 24 to 30 speaks about the other another parable where jesus lightened the kingdom of heaven lightened to a man that planted a field with seeds good seeds oh but you know some weeks later his servants went out to look at it they said but master you planted good seeds but now we are seeing tears coming up amongst the seeds that you're planting shall we pull out those those tears shall we pull out the tears no leave them alone let the two seeds grow together true and false but remember both seeds are religious both seeds religious just like abe cain and abel they both built altars but one built a false altar and one built a true altar one offered a false offering to god the other one offered a lamb a true offering to god one offered by unbelief one offered by faith abel offered a better sacrifice oh praise god forevermore hallelujah amen oh my praise god where god is leading me i don't know but i'm just following because something keeps striking my soul something keeps striking my being something is going on amen praise god in me and in the church too amen here i thank god for it so those chairs mix within the wheat they're all going to church is that right but he says don't pluck them up brother branham explained that he says because if you pluck up the tears the tears usually are ones who try to build their influence in the church so if you pluck up the tears you're going to pull up all the other ones who have confidence in them so a wise uh angel or messenger will leave them to grow together to maturity to the time of the end when people will actually start to recognize there is a difference just recognize that something is going on that he is the same god and he can reveal here today thanks be to god amen oh praise god forevermore so here these denominational bundles will be gathered together and these tears from the first church ages coming down into the nicean council 325 a.d from the catholic church there were right there growing alongside with the true church which they tried to kill off with inquisition and so on they tried to wipe it out so that they will be recognized as the mother church as the one true church but god said you know flesh and blood has not revealed this but my father in heaven has revealed this and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it praise god oh god's little speckle bird no matter how she might be his presence will be there with her amen now they're building up through all them ages spreading this false idea of faith and building up themselves into political power and that political power has to grow so that they can literally after a while force you to believe or accept their false doctrine which is not in the bible the word trinity and trinitarians not even in the bible uh the teaching of that is not in the bible there is no three gods and the jews know that already that god said it plain in the ten commandments hero israel the lord thy god is one lord does god change his mind about his word could god see anything wrong god didn't change his mind say oh i used to be one back there in the old testament but now i become three no god doesn't change his mind it's one god hallelujah and so when they come to the fact that jesus said go baptizing them in the name not names of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost that person who is father his son his holy ghost has one name and when on on the day of pentecost peter the first so-called first pope uh was asked men and brethren what shall we do to be saved he said repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ what so that name of that person who is father son and holy ghost is jesus christ and peter didn't waste time he didn't waste time he just went and said baptize them in the name of jesus christ hallelujah how you go how which woman is going to be feeling comfortable have assurance and confidence she gets married and a man doesn't want to put his name he writes dung i'm a father yeah that's not your name i'm a son of my mother that's not your name well i'm a carpenter that's good you have a nice job that you think you have but that's not your name the the the preacher is going to say no we need your name on this to register the government will not accept it unless you put your name hallelujah and that is why when we come to this waters of baptism we come to ba to be saved we come to be born again amen it's really a spiritual invisible marriage within your christ hallelujah and you take on his name and that is why you called a christian hallelujah amen praise god amen and so friends they are trying to accomplish their cowardly plot because they sit behind the scene and manipulate governments manipulate various authorities and doing all of that and at the same time going to church singing praising god because they know that the bible says god sends his reign natural and spiritual upon the just and on the unjust they're getting genuine blessings some of those pentecostals are getting genuine blessings they're getting genuine blessings in some of those church and they're abusing that and trying to say that is their credibility and authority but my friends god is going to take us out of here first of all identifies by the word and that kind of um let's say plot that they have is slowly going to be fading away from them because the coverage will be wrenched off of them they'll be uncovered and no longer will they be able to have a share of the blessings that god is sending down thank god the wheat will be god the bride will be gone out of here caught up in the presence of the living god of course that evil church that the bible says is going to dress herself to look so beautiful and look so pompous you know revelation 18 19 mystery babylon but she's a mother of harlots right uh all these thousands of churches are wrong with their hands out for money that's what their hands out for money every street corner there they pull up a building they come out of nowhere and they put up a building the building is full and their hands are out for money the bible says you're mother of harlots but in one hour i'll destroy you because you commit spiritual fornications with the kings of the earth and leaders of the earth i mean all the big businesses and everything i said one hour i'll burn everything down god said it it will happen amen before years ago when the people didn't know about what was happening now they would say that's impossible how are you going to burn it but now with one of these missiles that they're dropping they can burn any place down in an hour if they choose to do it right now as you see what's happening in russia and uh you know they're sending many many um little missiles but you know they got big ones that they can drop one and it can destroy not just a city that's why they don't want to use nuclear force because if the united states fire back is the whole planet is burnt up to and gone right so god can burn that in one hour and that's nothing for him to do that but everything is coming to its harvest everything is coming to its head and so they are coming to the headship of the antichrist and we are coming to the headship of jesus christ jesus christ is the word and the word begins to lead us and take preeminence within our hearts and within our lives they are led by the mystery of inequity and we are led by the mystery of godliness of how god's spirit in you is able to make us godly while we were caught up in that we thought we could make ourselves godly all we have to do is turn over a new leaf all we have to do is join the church like that but we didn't realize that it takes god's spirit and god's power to really come into our beings and to begin to clean us from the inside out is that right don't clean up yourself from the outside in putting on nice beautiful clothes in your rotten character your makeup is oh my goodness and then they say stinking thinking even your thoughts constantly evil oh my but the god thank god he has revealed it to us that he wants to clean us from the inside out that's why paul said work out your salvation with fear and trembling oh praise be to god amen yes sir so now the false church is coming but she's coming with cunning power political power manipulative power and she's coming with all the politics and powers that you can see but she's also gathering don't forget this she's gathering all her demons of darkness amen to blind the minds and hearts of men that they won't recognize what really is happening spiritually yes sir coming against the true vine but the true believers are maturing also coming into the fullness of the word coming into the richness of jesus christ hallelujah and thank god she will be like him and jesus himself will come praise god hallelujah and she i want to quote she is becoming like him through the word the word that he sent by an anointed prophet is what's cleaning us up and preparing us for the great rapture that is before us amen hallelujah so you look around you see what the bible already said they're going to bundle themselves together they're going to make a combine they're gonna make a religious union the ecumenical council is already formed the world coastal churches actually uh one friend of mine is a member of the board right way up in there and he likes those kinds of things so he's way up in there but let me tell you it is a living reality that is happening right now amen oh think of it yes sir but thank god the bride and the bread room will be caught away to have a wonderful time in the presence of the living god forever united as one that is the word of god amen thank god hallelujah i'm glad uh if i might just talk i'm preaching but i'm talk a little bit here now i'm glad when this message crossed my path i didn't search for it i didn't beg for it but god allowed it to cross my path and from that time to this it has completely transformed my life that i can stand here tonight and preach to you the word of god hallelujah i thank god uh here listen to this you see the the ecumenical move or the tears and the things they will do but thank god he will send forth a prophet in this last age you see when the devil raises up a standard god raises up a standard against him is that right that's the way it is see and his message will by his message the hearts of god's children will be turned right back to the original fathers and with the restoration of the word that they receive will also come a restoration of power not gifts not tongues not this not that but a restoration of supernatural power will return in the church we're living in perilous times now we're living in crucial times right now it's going on all around us you just got to you don't have to be even a christian to recognize something is wrong the world is slipping away civilization is at the point of its setting sun oh it's going to things are getting darker all the time and we must recognize it amen because the word at the turn of the century people were so hungry for god you know that even some of them passed through the city of burlington hamilton here and went over into new england and revivals broke out from there usually they put in the history books that the revival start over in new england but it really right here in hamilton and burlington the people were passing and a snowstorm delayed them and praying and and seeking god and everything and it started but then they went over to new england and it broke out in a bigger way and so it's documented that they had a great awakening over there but not really so and those things they don't document uh like the great revival over in the new brunswick newfoundland you know god used mighty man here in canada and anoint them use them for his glory amen wonderful way we thank god for that in such a marvelous and wonderful way for the great things he has done and so god sent the holy spirit you know the pentecostal revival broke out it would have been wonderful if they continue with how they were but as soon as they broke out each person each one of those leaders want their portion of the leadership so this one form church of god in christ this one form united pentecostal that one form this and there they were in a hurry to form these denominations and put their names on it right like that and the moment they're organized they died because organization is death and that is what took place and they adopted this doctrine of tongues in the evidence of the holy spirit well thomas is a manifestation of the spirit but not the evidence of the holy spirit right see we got to recognize that and so it's the falsity of that doctrine that has led them where they are in reality they should recognize the handwriting is again on the wall many many take in you far sin your weight in the balances and you found wanting god coming again to bring his judgment like he did back then oh praise god hallelujah and all that happened because the prophet of malachi 4 5 was not yet on the scene right still not yet on the scene and then uh by him not being on the scene they couldn't get the word as yet they could get all kind of power all kinds of all kinds of spirit all kinds of attitude that's fine brother but i think my voice is loud enough that they can hear i guess it's for them for the machines there okay thank you very much but thank god you know because he had not come on the scene they could jump as much as they want speak in tongues as much as they want but the word hadn't yet come so if the sun hadn't come up where are they going to get the warmth the heat and the light to ripen the fruit on the tree and that is what happened the sunlight has come amen like the one other prophet in the bible mentioned that god will wait but at evening time it shall be light again and send the light and that light will ripen the fruit that is there upon the tree praise god hallelujah oh my two separate barns and two separate destination just like the two thieves on the cross is that right today you will be with me in paradise raptured over there amen and the other one he went to his destination because there he was speaking and cursing against god now revelation 3 i'm going to try to wind this up now and we'll get to the baptism so please revelation 3 22 he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit said under the churches now we know this is a last warning and there will not be another warning because god's throne room has already been set up we thank god that the mansions are being prepared of course you know mansions don't mean a house like we say house but believers have another body this is just your natural one but when we leave here we go to a spiritual one we go to a supernatural one that god has prepared for us a body has now prepared me amen thank god and this prepared people are being called to go into the presence of god hallelujah oh thank god so my friends the spirit of god is not going to speak the word to another age he will speak to this age because the ages are over and and at the same time scriptures like he that hinders will hinder no more because he'll be out of the way in other words satan will give satan a chance to take over let them see what the world will become on the satan's rulership just for a short while right he's going to step back and let satan take over let the antichrist and then begin to rule for a while before he actually comes again with the second coming and change the scene of everything that is going on but thank god that a prophet came to us in time thank god and has revealed the truth to us just as he did through paul uh we are privileged people i know we can just say that anybody that heard the message whether they are just a make-believer or whatever right on up to the true believer is fortunate and blessed to even hear this word and hear the message that god sent through this prophet amen now listen to the promise they that will hear him that prophet will be blessed and become a part of the bride of this last day as mentioned in revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride says come see that wheat that fell in the ground at nicaea will come back to the original grain again hallelujah praise god el mai and when she listened to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last stage what he says from god the bride will begin to say also has that happened is that happening the bride will say the same thing so then you see the spirit the prophet and the bride will all be saying the same thing and what they are saying will have already been said in their word praise god hallelujah you see we we have to be careful because we speak about unwritten word and a lot of them think that you're adding on something or you're making up something in your own mind they don't realize it's the same word but you are not just looking at the written part you are receiving the nuance might be a word that could be close to what i'm trying to convey you're picking up the nuance not the words that the person say only like somebody can speak to you but it's not just their words it's their attitudes when they're saying that word it's it's little things coming off of their of their being when they're saying it it's the same thing with the word of god reading between the lines and understanding what he is saying to you amen hallelujah praise god so the cry has gone out and it's still going out come out of her my people be not partakers of her plagues amen you know that means the the the great tribulation amen under the sixth seal don't be left behind and be a partaker of that but come out of her now and it won't be long he says but this is the last age the ages are over in other words time shall be no more time for the church angels are over oh my yes sir he that he got in there to hear let him hear what the spirit said to the churches so god has spoken and you got to have an heir predestinated in you to hear what he is saying hallelujah you got to have an ear and you see you don't pray that dumb you don't fast that down to get it and to be able to really hear god and understand god it's not you don't work yourself up like like bails prophets to be able to get it praise god but my god brother sister you come into this world with that air it's only that we didn't know we had it we didn't know we had it until god began to unveil his word to us hallelujah oh my the sun is setting right now the setting the setting of the sun of the church ages is about to fade into eternity oh my oh and if god somewhere in this series has dealt with you by spirit may you even now turn to him in repentance and give your life to him by his spirit that he may give to you eternal life may god bless every one of you tonight michelle would you come the music praise god brother you step up here praise the lord the climax of these church ages is not wonderful and to realize where we are at it is fitting that we come to the climax of teaching on this series we have a few more um sermons on
