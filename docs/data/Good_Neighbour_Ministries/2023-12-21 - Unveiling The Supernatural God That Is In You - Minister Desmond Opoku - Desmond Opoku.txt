the energy Energizer that keep us that that anointing is the one that is keeping us going come myself I cannot move but there is something behind me there's something in me hallelujah thank you Lord

nobody know who who who he was until God revealed himself to that person when John the Baptist was was under the water he said there's one standing among you here that I'm not worthy to lat on his shoes by the time came when the when the the the god revealed himself inside that water there everybody recognize him that mystery the mystery that was among them John the Baptist unveil him to the

Messiah the great Holy Spirit he is our driving force hallelujah thank you Lord oh we had a good time there we had a good time there oh my and then November 2nd I went to I went to uh no November 26 I went to my my Village over there some years ago me and brother Kofi and brother F we went and God did a mysterious stuff there Healing The Sick raising the the somebody who couldn't work and the church broke up and the co came it scatter everything so I went back over there that evening try to get them together so that we can get together and do something it rains so hard there's no way I can do it anything so in the morning I dress up came inside the inside the The Village there standing there thinking maybe I going to find somebody I can't find somebody I said well Lord I cannot stay home I have to go to Methodist church so I just stood there all of a sudden I see a lady I saw a lady coming one of the convert he said that they all scattered only me and that I don't know I don't have a place to wor so there's a little group here that I I always go there to have Fellowship wouldn't come would you come and minister to us I said I was going to go to the metes and but if you if you if you are if you are there I will come so I went there when I went while I was talking to him a man old man came and dropped something for her and he said this is our pastor and he told he told the man I'm coming there to to to have fellowship with them so I went inside the they have uncompleted house and when I went there was only two people there and I sat down I pray and I told them just give me a song sing sing a song for me sing a couple song before we started Brethren these two people begin to sing looks like hundreds of people there singing I couldn't stop crying something grip my soul Hallelujah they begin to sing I try to keep myself I went I went to another room to to keep myself calm not I couldn't stop and then two people came and then became he grew up and he sang the song the song is so harmonious like everybody singing their part like I I I I can't explain yes then I contain myself and then I I I brought a topic uh I brought a topic you need you need the Holy Ghost I brought a topic you need the Holy Ghost and I I brought the message I I took the book of Acts and showed them how to get the Holy Ghost and I put them I I I put to them in this in in the so much that the Lord plac in my heart that you cannot go to heaven without the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is your tiet so the church does have that ticket the only place where you can get a ticket is where God has given instruction this Bible here that this Bible is written here every word is inspired every word inside that Bible here that's your earnest hope that is Tak you to glory and I I begin to talk to them and I I tear a paper I said this paper that I take nobody can take this paper the same way that I rap it even myself I cannot rap into two times so you part here God has is over there and you are the one that's here so when you go over there you go going to click and March that paper that God has and that is the Holy Ghost part of you God has it there and you are you are here so you going to March it up the church nobody can match it up unless you yourself you follow that patter and God gave it to you and through his grace and mercy because we were there before we came over here so your part is already over there Hallelujah and I begin to talk talk to them Hallelujah and I said you are sitting here you know me from the beginning when I was young childhood you you you people knows me was I good there was no good nothing good in me I traveled to go and and find money to come here but I went what I get is more than the money that I went for Hallelujah now what I get is what I brought here it's more than life your daily life Oh Glory to God we had a good time and then after the service then the man started to and I started to I started to open a little bit about the serpent seed that are Apple and all those things there so the pastor asked me so it's not Apple I said what is Apple there's not such a thing Apple inside the Bible even if you read the Bible there's no word Apple there so they SE and I started to explain to them how things went before he sitting down there me and him going through this journey and God came down through his grace and mercy he reversed that case and here we are now so whoever took this this word here and I tell you not everybody can take there's a special people whom God has chosen no matter what because their part is already there you tell them they will take that word there they cannot refuse it Hallelujah glory to God and I had a good time with them yes so after the service four people everybody lined up they want prayer so I pray for them this one said my sister is laying down Sick onto a point of death I want to stand before I say yes if you believe God will honor your request because we are not serving a dead God we are serving Lively God hallelujah our God's life is real it's not just we talking about him he is already here because that his promise so I pray for her and the other one come came came and then you brought her a request I pray for her and then the the pastor came said my wife is laying down on the others other other town with a stroke so I want to stand there I said how I will go with you and anoint her with oil and pray for her so after the service in the evening I went and pray with her with him for the wife and we rejoiced and I left over there so I had a good good good time and while we while we were while we were almost finished there the he the four people they said we have we have our church we are building our church if you want to if you want you want to go see I said sure I will go and see the church where you building so one lady said I was sitting down there one lady said said that's your mommy land because they know me when I was young I said okay I never even remember where my M land there so I went there with them and when I went there they had a foundation already with the pillars everything and the place where they were they were worshiping is a somebody uncompleted house so the guy is taking them out so they bought some 2x4s that they were going to put inside there and put some leaves or something so that they can they can worship underneath over there yes so I said I want to I went there and he showed me by by by my ey as soon as I went there the land is there the plot H the foundation is there the pillars are there the woods are there and I look my side there's a big mango tree and when I look at the mango tree all my memories started coming back that's that's my big brother's mango we always called John mango my brother name was John you know him brother brother Kofi my brother that that that that stood up and walk when we pray for her for him that is mango so we always when we go to the farm that we sat underneath the that mango tree over there and my mommy and he I dig the hole to plant y my mommy plant a lot of yam so that mango is familiar then I begin to bear in tears said my our lord is good from the my childhood I went overseas and come back here and worship here right here again hallelujah hallelujah I begin to cry I said Lord you're so good to me our God is good oh Hallelujah let me tell you the god that we serve it's not just to talk about he real if you don't know him really you start to search for him real in your lifetime you have to see him face to face personalized in your life so when something comes you know that you know he did something for you that nobody on this Earth can do it Hallelujah that's your driving force in this journey this journey is real Hallelujah glory to God so I I I I left over there I took pictures and I left over there and you know what happened while I'm driving to kumas from my Village I had a phone call ring the man left his phone in my car I'm almost middle of the road and it's almost dark I cannot turn back and when I took the pH phone my brother the phone is so small phone and you wrap up with the tapes and tapes and tapes and tapes said my goodness look a pastor that's preaching the word of God he doesn't even have a normal phone that he can use to call so when I came I I came another boy was coming from there he called me and I said I have the phone so when the boy the the young man came I had another extra phone in my bag that's a old but very good phone and I gave that phone to him to give it to him for him to use see how God does things Hallelujah we are serving mysterious God he's a god of mystery and when he reveal to you you know that you know glory to God hallelujah our god is God H and then on the 30th I preach at kumashi again and my message do you really know him since you believe do you really know him since you believe this message it it goes to everybody not only them do you know him do you personally know know him that's what I say from the beginning you have to get something in your life personalize because God that we serve he speak he talk we all know God talks how many know how many don't know that God talk you don't know that God talk no how many don't know that God talk I'm not talking about a minister here God talking through the minister I'm talking to personal your personal life God speak you have to listen you have to tune your ear read your Bible and know the voice of God and his reaction and his actions then you will know that the god that you worship he is real Hallelujah because listen I'm I'm just talking for myself I pray in the middle of the night and God spoke to me I don't know how I heard it but I heard it cuz I Heard a Voice inside of me this this this I thought was my own imagination say it can't be then I I I I I I I I I lay down the bed like meditating I just like I'm dozing he said this this this I get up put the lights on and I check that that that everything dot dot dot dot it's not just me I wake up I woke up my son and say this this this and we check is that that that so nobody can tell me God does not talk God talk when you pray for somebody instantly and something happened right there you your can do that no God himself brother Abraham was preaching and the man was challenging him and he said you fall down on my feet what happened he fell down on his feet you understand the god of himself is not just talking he real he a god of action amen hallelujah it's God of action we thank God for brother Simon he preached to us we stay under him he train us and now we are ready to move Hallelujah because we saw the action through him the message that he received from Brother Braham he didn't just spoke to us the words holy he spoke to her with action Hallelujah we were in a Bruce day when somebody came down and challenged and Disturbed the service that we were we we were we were we were doing he followed the brother straight down to the home and the brother said no this cannot be he called the police my brother don't joke this message is not a is not a a joking thing he called the police everybody who's watching this video watch out and see that this church here we don't pray games this is real Hallelujah and the brother called the police police was standing there he still harassing the brother what happened in front of the police he he go he went down straight down they pick it up up dead completely dead it's not half dead completely dead he didn't come back alive again he's gone he's in the grave so when you hear the message somebody heart is preaching the gospel as Paul preached the same gospel that Paul preached the same word God said let there be light the same power that was that day is still the same power today am he never change it God has not God doesn't go back what he spoke to that that time is still life today so this word here is life last some time ago I preach a m Lifeline Hallelujah God form never run out for battle it is always life you call him is already there night day or midnight morning afternoon it is always life Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so the the gospel that we we we preach as Paul said the gospel that we preach if any angel come from heaven and speak other than what we preach let him be a curse God God chose man to preach the gospel Hallelujah this gospel is still a joke you don't understand just stay there he said whoever blessed Israel he'll be blessed whoever curth Israel will be cured Hallelujah Oh Glory to God we see so many times brother Braham people challenge him and things happen let me tell you brother Braham didn't die and take the gospel with him remember praise the Lord when brother Abraham was baptizing in the in the people in Ohio River we all know the angel came and spoke as John the bapst for ran the first coming of the Lord Jesus so your ministry will fall around the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is the word it's real Hallelujah and when John the Baptist introduced the Lord Jesus Christ to the dis disciples what happened I must decrease he must increase the gospel begin to shine the life the life begin to sprung up hallelujah oh glory to God the time when John the Baptist was in fresh he said go and check it out if it was true and the Lord Jesus has sent him to a wor right now brother Braham has introduced the bride to who Christ himself again remember he said as John the Baptist Paul ran the first coming of the Lord Jesus so your ministry who fall around the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so Abra Abraham is off the scene and introd the bright to Christ who is here right now Christ in the bride Christ himself is here hallelujah amen people do not understand this is not a man message this is God himself the message for God himself so if you are a Believer and you need something don't think or don't underestimate yourself God himself is in you amen hallelujah God himself is in you it doesn't matter whether you are going to grave or you're going to die tomorrow or you're going to raise up tomorrow God can do all things God word does not change remember Lazarus what happened to Lazarus he was dead he was dead but what happened when God came on the scene what happened trials he took him out from the from the grave and he leave why he show the resurrection power

hold on hold on live right pursue enjoy your salvation go speak once he doesn't speak two times when he speak is still the same never change I spoke all this things to them and they were rejoicing heavily people went home and they they call me they cry all night for the message that I brought from him Kumi they cry because what I bring Christ real on the scene and the and the reality of God himself in the Believers God can use you anytime you you want if you're ready you have to be ready I always said we we are all TOS say oh this man is spiritual no it's not spiritual matter God is a spirit you live by Spirit without a spirit your body is dead Hallelujah if you want to see God you will see God Hallelujah you can't you can't see God by my fashion you have to see God by your own

ministration of his ministry how did they recog Abraham the manifestation of his ministry so how will the world will Rec recognize the bride the man manifestation of our ministry yes it's very very

read a letter here he said and and and thy seed and thy seed shall possess the the the Gate of enemy the paragraph 27 he said brother Braham now he seed now Jesus said about seed he said this that he said this that it will be far better than a a mstone to be h on your neck and drawn in the dep of the sea than even offend this Seed of Abraham you are the Seed of Abraham that's why I'm saying you are special people anybody blesses you he breast anybody that curses you he cures hallelujah oh Hallelujah the least of the these that believe in me it will be and God and God told Abraham where whoever bless you I bless them and whoever Cur you I will Cur them thank you Lord now if you notice he said he would bless who Abraham who blessed Abraham and his seed will be blessed and he will curse ever who Cur Abraham now you just watch that the Jewish people see what happened watch that amongst Christian see what happened always that way see you see so you see he will possess the enemy's gate let's go back and find some some of the man Abraham seed under the Jewish Covenant then bring it down into the Gentiles when we were drafted over from the Jewish age of to the Gentile age to take a people for the name for his name now let's take some of the The Men Who was the Seed of Abraham and see if they possess the Gate of the enemy let's take let let's take for instance now let's Pi a moment upon there when the children of Israel has been carried away captiv down from Babylon there was a time first there was had first they had no they had to come to a trial there's always a trials it always darkest before day in the nature and you always have trials before you have Victory if there is no war then there is no victory so you going to get worse but there will be always Victory when God you have a trial you have a problem God never solve the problem God always solve our problem never one time ever leave us now the Hebrew children down there had brought on the spot had brought onto the spot where the king made a declaration that anybody will not bow down to this image would throw into the fire furnace furnace of fire rer and when they purposed their heart that they would not go in to defy themselves they were going to leave close to God now three Hebrew children Shadrach mesek andigo they were all they were the Seed of Abraham and how to and how the promise of God that is seed that's his seed will possess the enemy's gate now I would imagine when a trial come up what the first thing a child of God has for Refuge when a trial comes the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of mankind prayer hallelujah what what what what the what's the greatest weapon prayer Hallelujah it even changed everything it even changed the mind of God one one time God told the God told his Prophet go up and tell the king he was going to die and the King turned his face to the wall and said Lord I beseech you to consider me I have walked before you with a perfect with a with a perfect heart and need 15 years longer and God spare his life 15 years longer Prayer Changes Things Hallelujah then then then we noticed then the Hebrew children came to prayer meeting that night what were going to what what are we going to do they have to be a gathering and decision has to be made know that they pray all night long and the decision was en numerously because they were deciding that they could not afford to go back to go on God on the time of trial wouldn't that be good for the whole church now when the decision is made shall I turn to be shall I turn to the things of the world shall I go like the rest of them go the decision come to every Christian it comes to you daily how are we going to do it you have got to make your decision and they made their decision regardless what what would take place wasn't going to turn away from God that right because they promised of God that they were Abraham's seed and they know their position and know where they standing and they told the king they said no now they said we are going to throw you into the far F if you do not bow down to this God Hallelujah I just want to get something here there was a place where I wanted to get yeah but they will hold out the truth I've Got Confidence in them they are my servant Abraham said so I will hold truth I will so they will hold truth well the next morning the king the king might have said have you decide now that you are going to bow down to the God said no we are not going to bow down we are just a r a rig his dignation him he that he h the furnace seven times hotter than ever was hot and he took he took some big strong men they started walk into the drop of into the furnace and they walk up close looking like the Dark Hour was there that the way that's the way it looks to Christian sometime when somebody the young lady and they have been persuaded by a boy that she really loves to take care for cigarette when she forced maybe to take a drink for her first time oh thank you Lord I I Tred to get something but it's too long yeah it's okay there's a place where God God said I have to go down I have to go down by myself that's what I was looking for I think it's okay praise the Lord hallelujah so you young people we said sometime you're going to go through trials somebody going to take you oh let's go take a one drink the Christmas is coming let's try let's go take one cigarette would you deny God and follow that demon that try to persuade you you have always have to stand by God if you stand by God God stand by you God bless you this is a little thought that I have for you this evening may the Lord bless you praise the Lord thank you wonderful thank you uh praise God God bless everyone of you here tonight good to see you good to see you all here in the house of the Lord you know as I listened to brother Desmond I thought if Moses was here tonight and and trying to speak to you and you know of course he's bringing the word of Jehovah bringing the word of God but here you would be halting and and and stammering and and and and uh you know struggling to to talk to you and you'd be wondering what this guy is a preacher or whatever but you see you've got to understand God [Music] deliberately hides behind that kind of skin right and when I say that I don't mean black skin white skin brown skin any skin he deliberately hides behind it and then he lets you see little things about that person but that uh you know just to distract you because those who are ordained by God to see the truth and the revelation of the word doesn't matter what comes what distractions come oh he the devil will bring your ATT mention oh he didn't pull up his socks before he got up there look at that his TI is Twisted what's that got to do with the word what is anything got to do with the opening of the word but that's how Satan Works he takes your attention away with all kinds of other things uh rather than recognizing what God is saying and using like for instance this brother here tonight talking about uh the Manifest recognizing your testimony being recognized not by how much you're talking and all that but by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit through your life amen in other words by faith Abel amen God testifying of his gift not just him telling oh I I I had a revelation I knew that it was blood I that's in it's a truth but that's not it after you say it then God comes and testifies that it is the truth amen and furthermore the brother was emphasizing it's not if you see it in your pastor you see it in the Deacon you see it in this one that one that's fine but then when you begin to see little uh incidents in your own life on unexplained um coincidences taking place around you you see you start to see little suggestions or hints coming into your mind that you didn't think about but all of a sudden a thought comes well why don't you do this why didn't you think about that why didn't you go here stop what you're doing over there uh stop now go stand over there simple simple ordinary things like that but you you God starting to train you to understand him and to know him until you begin to walk with him so uh these manifestations of the supernatural as our brother was talking about uh Paul said we didn't come with just the word only right yeah we got the message but we didn't come with the word only but we come in the manifestation or demonstration of the spirit of God and in the power of God and that's what we come in and the beauty of this thing is it's not as we think we're going to move the hand of God because we have strong faith no God doesn't do anything brother brandham said because you tell him to or you ask him to he doesn't because he wants to do it he is moved he he is moved but he is not moved he moves but he is not moved he moves when he wants to move but he's not moved by by sympathies human things and all that he's not moved by that he moves when he chooses to move amen and he knows Beyond Us Praise the Lord I'm not here to preach I'm just commenting all of this is coming off of what the brother was saying but it's just marvelous and wonderful but also um he left out that when he spoke to that old preacher uh the old preacher suddenly remembered that the night before he he he had a dream or Vision that somebody else was preaching in the church but he didn't know who the person was uh he didn't mention that maybe God didn't want him to say but the fact is that's what happened uh and and so that is one of the things that put the Man on Fire what is going in the world is going on because he knows that nobody did that it was God did that amen and and so he just hung on the word and what a blessing that is now we'll just do the best we can to help that church because we know they are just now trying to build a building praise the Lord and this is what we have been doing and we thank the Lord for that wonderful so God is God and he uses anybody amen and so you can take the simplest one of us here and let us say something that doesn't sound uh as we say intelligent or it doesn't sound logical but if it's in line with the word of God you listen to that voice behind that voice and let the Holy Spirit lead and guide you now I'm here as the pastor and I have been here uh for all these years and God no doubt has been flowing through me and you're used to that but now there's a transition and a passing of a torch but not only the passing of a torch it's the pillar of Fire or the Holy Spirit going from one to another not for you to hear a different voice but the same voice coming through the a different vessel that God will be using it's the same voice but it'll come through a different vessel so don't look at the vessels listen to The Voice see that's what you got to have your attention on listen to the voice that's coming and that will keep you up online front sight back site word of God everything will be lined up together and doesn't matter what the devil cannot Prevail against the True Church of the Living God because it's founded on Revelation it lives by Revelation and it will continue to move by Revelation and not because we use the words Revelation because these days everybody's saying they get Revelation and and and they talk about the supernatural but the Supernatural is not something you do it's something that he does and it's something that you you yourself can explain uh you can be just talking like this and be talking simply like this and then all sudden the Holy Spirit just breaks out why because the spirit of God God on you creates the atmosphere that he can drop down among us and that he can make himself known anytime he wants and it's it's beautiful it's a beautiful thing sometimes he comes in the Thunder next time he comes in the lightning of the word another time he's a still Small Voice we just got to go with him whichever way he wants to go the Lord bless you real good and who's going to do the singing oh he's here in position praise God everything is positionally placed brother adopted anointed positionally placed and ready to go praise the Lord God bless you all amen God bless you real [Music] [Music] like [Music] your my God is before I can feel him in my soul [Music] not [Music] [Music] know of this one my God is I in my soul my God is he's my soul God is real for he has CLE and made oh his love for me is like [Music] your God is for I can him in my [Music] soul in my soul my God is real for he hased and made me whole his love for me is like your go my God is real for I can feel him in my [Music] [Applause] soul man amen
