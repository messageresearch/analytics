bless you real God bless you amen good to see all of you we welcome you here in the presence of the Lord God bless you richly today praise this wonderful name uh we will look to the word of God as we welcome all of you I see a lot of nice fresh faces in here and we are thankful to God for that amen we're looking to Psalms 139 if that scripture is up it should be up very soon on the screen uh before me and we'll read from the word of God verses 15 and 16. as I said last week I'm not really preaching I'm teaching on a word of God right and as such listen closely and let the word of God permeate your soul and your entire life my substance was not hid from thee When I Was Made In Secret and curiously wrought in the lowest part of the Earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book were all my members written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them I praise God now you know that was not written about Adam that really was written about Jesus Christ God in his mind you know and this so here was David the prophet on the inspiration but he was vocalizing uh what God had in his mind concerning Jesus knowing all the members of the body and everything else before they even came down here he knew them and and so on he's talking about that right there at this point praise the Lord let us borrow his look to the Lord in prayer our gracious uh loving unrighteous Heavenly Father we are absolutely a wonderful and privileged people oh God that thou would look down upon us and that you would give us your word for the age father Lord God we think that we uh can come here and invite your presence but we are the ones that are privileged to be invited into your divine presence the Lord maybe just appreciate your divine presence may this Spirit of almighty God go through this entire congregation and rest upon each believer that they might come to realize the reality of which we speak not of words only but of your very presence and your anointing upon the word giving us understanding and wisdom and eternal things for your glory and honor for we ask it in Jesus name God bless you please be seated okay now of course we know that Adam was always in God's mind Adam was already in God's mind and God knew everything about him and if you'll read that scripture it says here my substance was not hidden from thee praise God When I Was Made In Secret amen when he was coming from the spirit world and being made into substance amen praise the Lord and God looked and God could see every member just like you know every member of your body you know your fingers your toes you know everything God knew God is saying I knew all the members uh in that body and of Jesus I know all the members that will be uh in that body everything about them praise God I knew them and he said I I knew them you see see the eyes that see my substance yep being on perfect not fully manifest yet you see it before it even come into existence and in thy book where all my members in thy book were all the members they were already in the book they're already in the book of redemption they were already in the Lamb's Book of Life they don't come down here to come to an alternate path so that their names could be added to that book of life because God's thoughts are eternal and God can have a new thought because his thoughts are Eternal and unchanging and therefore God being Perfection of perfection nothing can be added to his thoughts because they are perfect to begin with and therefore we find out that it's not a new name now written down in glory that name had to be already in the book yeah and then God confirms it God certifies it God is the one that comes and put his seal of approval upon it and identifies it that that individual is one of his own not by their own choosing but of his choosing because he chose you you didn't just choose him you see he chose you praise God I'm glad he chose me because he said I chose you you didn't choose me I am the vine you were the branches you're only the branches for me to express myself so I chose you right you have not chosen me between a man and a woman use a marriage the man chooses who will be his wife if you want to say that's the woman's choice is like us when we come down here what would be looked upon as our choice is our acceptance of his choice accepting the word accepting the promise for your day accepting that what he said what he did whatever he says to us we believe it that it is so amen that is the bright choice or you can use the word that's the bright acceptance of his word praise God now the Bible says it clearly according to the church age but can I have some of the pages of the church age book care uh photocopied so I can refer to some old notes I scrambled through the years now how that when the woman comes to the man in the East and comes for the wedding she comes with a veil on our face and that veggies for us today we know nothing we become we might read the Bible read the scriptures and we know intellectually but really we know nothing and so she comes with a veil on her face amen but then when she comes with the veil in our face they they uh culture or else that he would come and lift the veil from off her face aren't you glad that our lord Jesus Is Lifting the veil from off our spiritual ignorance to this word of God and the word of God is making itself plain and clear to us so we can understand who we are who he is our place and our position and how we are to act in regards to him acknowledging his headship acknowledging his leadership acknowledging his position as husband and Lord and Savior baptizer and soon coming King glory be to God on high Hallelujah I said I wasn't going to preach so let me just I I'm trying to do that so I can stay calm enough to bring the word to you amen praise the Lord so we thank God that he is the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord hallelujah so there we understand therefore that we were always a part of the book of redemption now we are in the place where we have become a part of the manifested book of redemption because we are manifesting what is in the book and that is trying to speak to the rest of the world and the rest of the people because they always have their this idea that God is a fearsome creature or person in the sky waiting to bring down judgment upon you or or to Doom upon you and God has come into the hearts of the True Believers men and women to infill them living them and to manifest into the world that he is not a god of judgment he is the god of love and grace but with love comes comfort and discipline and so God balances his word that we could recognize who he is he is pure love not the love of man but this is the Zoe the love of God the fullness of who he is amen praise the Lord so we are glad that we are in God's book amen praise the Lord now we'll talk about the natural election that we are all a part of and we'll talk a little bit about the spiritual election of which we are of by the grace of God and listen to quote from your church ages which I did last week he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have them and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are eternal is always have these thoughts and he is eternal and if he always had them his thoughts are Eternal as he is eternal and so that's those these thoughts of God are Eternal not only that they are real not like a man like he said in in continuing this which I wouldn't read it but he said it there not like a man having a blueprint and then later on he's going to go and and work to make that blueprint come into reality he says when God has his thoughts his thoughts are already real amen this thoughts were already real they're just waiting for when he wants to speak or to cause them to come into manifestation or expression amen praise the name of the Lord amen so we know those thoughts were in God's mind before there was even a moon or a star do you know you were there before the mood of the Stars you were there before any molecule you were there before any autumn anything was there you were there because remember Elohim the self-existent one was alone with his thoughts in him amen and of course we were chosen in him thus since when we were chosen because we were already in him he was there with his thoughts amen praise God hallelujah so uh thank God so therefore when he turned and asked job this wonderful question which we all know you're trying to jug his spiritual memory and to bring him out of his spiritual Amnesia by the way job where were you when the morning stars were singing up in heaven and shouting for joy and glorifying my name where were your job trying to bring his memory back to who he really was you're not just a human being here come to Born die and pass away You're an eternal being you come from God and you're going back to God you come from the presence and bosom of the great God of heaven and return to God we are not of time we come from eternity amen and we're going back to Eternity from Once We Came praise God we're right now on our journey we are traveling home to God and I think I hear it's separate time and I hear my father call amen I hear the call I feel the pull I know this is the season and the hour of the opening of the word of God and I've received it within my heart praise God hallelujah amen oh where were you can you see yourself if you were there amongst them I've preached it before I'll say it again if you're shouted for him when you're up there you won't come down here and have your mouth I'm not going to praise you you can say and reveal whatever you want I'm not gonna I'm Not Gonna Worship you that's the spirit of the devil but the sons of God under Divine anointing when that truth of God strikes their soul they will act the same way down here just like they did when they were up there there were Praises name they will give him the glory they'll give him the honor be can't help it because they are part of it they're part of it and they'll do the same things that if you fought God up there if you brought war in heaven against him you want to bring war in the church you want to link war in the home you want to bring War wherever you go amen but if you were shouting praising God give him glory and honor you will glorify his name down here glorify his word down here praise God hallelujah amen amen I'm glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them praise God somebody said uh brother Simon looks like you my goodness that you all uh crossed up I said no I've been to the Cross oh my well you act like you're a fanatic that's right I've been to the attic too praise the Lord amen praise God brother sister something has got a hold of us when that Prophet a message was released from him it's not just the words that we see written on the spoken word book page it's not even what we just hear but our power was released from the presence of God and that power and presence is shaking ourselves Hallelujah I I I I just as it came to me I released that I said that to you it's the same thing brother Brandon was trying to get us to know look he turned us back and he says oh your name is Mrs so-and-so when you were small you were on a tree were eating corn you ate too much you got sick and from then on it created a vowel problem and you have this and that not be healed in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you know he was trying to let us know faith is like that you stand up anyway any one of us and somebody tries to creep up behind you the moment they get close enough you don't know what it is I can't explain it something in you causes you to know you're not guessing how you know you're not guessing you're not seeing the person but you say oh but but I feel his presence how did you feel it how what what you know you see he's trying to explain to us that's how Revelation is like when God opens up the word to you you begin to see something in the word and you try to explain what you see you can only explain the written parts or whatever but that that power that has come and touch your soul touch your being you'll know that that's real that's true that that can't be changed you can't you can't do away with it it's part of me amen hallelujah praise God that's what it all it is and even saying that can't explain it it just gives you an inkling of an understanding so that you would recognize if you're one of those people praise God God one of those Noah noirs knowing people that recognize something from the presence of the Living God hallelujah you know God can come the things that are not as though they were and though those those members of his body were not yet made manifest he can Comfort them as they are Amen in the word says that I mean I'm saying it like that but while I'm speaking you understand that it's the word my mind is on the word and I'm bringing out from the word what the prophet said what the Bible says and I may not quote the entire verse or quote the quote or the scripture month year but I'm bringing out the truth that is encapsulated in that word that you might understand what God is saying in this hour praise the Lord hallelujah amen now we find out that these are amen that the thoughts of God are Eternal amen they are real they are not like a man with a blueprint that he has drawn up which one day he will then be substance and form what they are already real and eternal and they are a part of God hallelujah you're a part of God you're a part of God I don't know which part but you're a part of God Amen praise God you may not like me but I'm still a part of God is that right I don't know which part I could be the bomb but I'm still a part of God I'm saying that way to bring it down to earth now you might understand this is real doesn't matter which part we are whether you're a finger whether you're a toe or hair or whatever you're a part of God God himself amen praise the name of the Lord amen glory to God hallelujah I'm so thankful I'm part of him now to go back God was alone let me use the term Elohim because God of course there's so many gods you just say God it makes the person think you're just religious but Elohim the self-existing one not to go but to give you an Insight the Greek that word is actually plural it speaks of one being but somehow that being seems plural that's where they get these figments of the imagination it gets them to believe in a try a triunity and all this kinds of stuff but it was Elohim sitting in the darkness with his thoughts in him and so a plural Greek word is used amen because we were already in God himself as persons I'm not talking about the physical part of you but the spirit being that lives in you that was with God and in God from the beginning before the foundation of the world Amen there was no light anywhere there was just darkness everywhere and we were already in his mind but at this point we he did didn't put us in his mouth for We Are Never in his mouth but we passed through his mouth when he said let there be light and The Light Came Upon the face of the Earth coming bringing it understanding that he said I am the light of the world I am the light he will he is the pillar of fire he is the everything and out of him he spoke sons and daughters and they were expressed here upon the face of the Earth Hallelujah and so when he was in the darkness we were there we were there with him where were you job I was there praise God you look in the Book of Proverbs I believe and then you will see a more outline the same spirit of God speaking that I was there when you did this I was there when you did such and such I was there you'll find that somewhere in the Book of Proverbs but praise God hallelujah I'm glad we were with him in eternity and you know eternity has no beginning no starting place in other words and it has no ending Place eternity doesn't start and it doesn't end because it's one Circle that's why marriage rings are uh you know the image of Eternity is there on that ring that's what he's talking about we are there we say till death do us part but that's the natural thing where you part but the spirit man and woman if they are two seeds of God they're never part amen they never will whether Brandon proved that he went to heaven met his daughter in every they were all there because they're part of the whole word of God hallelujah amen so we thank God hallelujah amen amen but where with his thoughts he wanted to become God wanted to become you were the prophet talk about that it won't go down the length of it you want to be healer you want to be savior he wanted to be this you want to be that all of that God wanted to become amen praise God and you know Elohim became Jesus Christ is that right Elohim became Jesus Christ John 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was Elohim the Word was God see so Elohim became Jesus Christ coming down through the various stages of his and morphe coming down from thought coming down to being a theophany and Melchizedek and from Melchizedek Prophet said that he was he was just in the state of and morphing in himself until he became fully flesh Amen in Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord so Elohim became Jesus Christ Hallelujah which was God's God's thought of himself expressed in the person of Jesus Christ amen praise God hallelujah and in the same way God's thoughts are also became expressed but we did not come Express as Jesus Christ we become expressed as Sons and Daughters of God amen we come expressed as a bride we come Express other not one body but a many membered body praise the Lord oh praise God slow down here there is not it's not two bodies I'm talking about because remember she was in him so when he came he was the fullness of all the thoughts everything that was in the godhead bodily is that right amen so when he was there we were in him by the way there's his rising of the sun uh this is the last thing I printed off here he says but remember when he went there to the Cross he's talking about you were there with him in him because God had never separated the bride from the groom as yet so when God looked down upon that body of Christ hanging there he saw what male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are one and the same word the same word speaks of the groom it speaks of the Bride amen that's the rising of the sun we see he sang when he was hanging on the cross amen you are there in him that's another sermon God had his wife in him Adam came down his wife wasn't him Jesus came down his wife wasn't him you know and so on and you take the word and you can break that and express it and make manifest how God LED these things in the world that we can see how we got here how we got here and how we're gonna get back there going up Jacob's Ladder by the grace of the Living God hallelujah aren't you glad you're a part of him hallelujah thank God and all these members God knew them oh my in that wonderful why Prophet spoke he says do you know that when God when God looked God even knew the color you're here he knew every one of those thoughts he knew how you would look he says when that one thought goes down there uh just like I let Mary said just call his name Jesus that's an Earthly name there's a lot of jesuses in the Spanish World especially but but call his name Jesus so he can be recognized there on Earth and he will be this this is what his purpose is he's going to be you know the savior he will be the Redeemer he will do this oh look there's another one when he comes down here I'll I'll just call his name right amen it sounds funny but that's exactly God knew this one when we couldn't request that one's going to be named Mike that one is going to be named Susan this one is going to be named Mary this one Whatever your name God knew your name Hallelujah he nor the Earthly name that you would be given and you'll be given you have to be given that name down here because people have to know you amen but he already knows you he already knows your name from back there that's why the seals were opened praise God and he now began to call his children by their spiritual name praise God what's not their natural heirs going to recognize it what their spirit will recognize and feel the pull of the voice of God in these last days amen praise God don't tell me don't get excited the devil just try to speak and say Lord yeah no praise God I I can't help it when I see this beautiful wonderful Words of Life begin to expand explode and like a Roman Candlestick and lighting up the age that we're living in I can't help it but recognize my game my message my hour and be excited all about it blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so on Earth I let you be called John Simon let one be called Christopher one we call Danny or whatever I'll let them be called that here when they get here amen praise God and when they get here um I'm going to express myself through this member of this bar this part of my body I'm gonna express myself I I'm gonna express myself through this part or tomorrow said I'll expect myself through this part whatever he chooses to express himself out of that's him but I'll Express he will Express himself through the member of that part of the body but all together when I bring them all together they are not I mouth foot whatever they are the bride they are the wife of Christ because they'll make up their entire body of Jesus Christ they are one in him praise the name of the Living God Amen yes sir praise God so we come down here and we come to express ourselves for what he is amen hallelujah amen but all them members actually are himself being expressed because he wanted to become Jesus Christ he wanted to become you he gave you the power to become is that right to become and so he wanted to become you that you might become him right that you might go back to that place where you reckon recognize you're a part of him so he came down to express himself and we come down to express the rest of it to express ourselves as a part of the believing wife the believing bride amen praise God but together they make one body for it was one body go back to Genesis 1 the Bible says and so there was Adam and Eve but the Bible says if you read the scripture believe it's Genesis 3 but he called their name Adam he called their name Adam praise the name of the Lord right now in the same in the same thought Jesus hanging on the cross there with his wife in him their name was Jesus Christ so she is Mrs Jesus Christ it's not that we are just picking up terms and little slogans brother Branham priest and said and they're quoting them back to you for you to feel good this we are seeing reality in the word [Applause] it's actual fact it's actual substance it's actually unfailing reality of the Living God making himself known than they are in which we live blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah it's all the process of Elohim come down and pressing or translating or uh and morphing himself from Spirit into flesh in the hour and that is the whole if you want to look at the whole mystery this is all this is what it is from Genesis to revelation amen but the book is now unfolding itself now it's now we're getting to understand that's why he said one of those will be greater than John because John and them it was they were in it they it wasn't unfolded to them but we are now at the end they were looking this way to what was going to come and some of them were seeing visions but we are here looking back at the whole thing and God using the seals gives us the entire history gives us the entire understanding of what happened from before the foundations of the world right through time through world history right to the very hour in which we're living amen and showing us the things that are going to be amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah glory to God Amen oh we continue here praise God but to go on these elect were not only the eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh you amen praise God where were you to be expressed in flesh praise God in other words you couldn't uh express yourself just in spirit form like I told you Genesis 2 Genesis 3 Adam God says in Genesis 2 that God already had made Adam but you see was made in the image of God which was just the spirit man a Genesis 3 the Bible says though Adam was made it says but there was no man to till the soil so the spirit man couldn't pick up a spare then go fill the soil not that there were Spades there but I mean he couldn't really dig cultivate or whatever the soil but he saw God then gathered of the Dust now not a part of himself but he gathered of the Dust man if you would say another man he made a flesh Man Out of the Dust and then the spirit man put the spirit man in there that he might be in the flesh man now he can go and tell the soil now he can go and do work in the garden praise the name of the Lord so my brothers and sisters what a blessed thing that we are a part of Amen so we got expressed in other words in flesh praise God that we can fulfill his purpose of what he and his mind praise God whatever he wants done in the garden we can now do it because you allow us to be here in flesh praise God hallelujah amen now to be expressed in their new season praise God takes me to God we are to be expressed in our Jew season in other words if you were to be born and to be made manifest in the age of Luther that would be the season God wanted you to be in that would be the part of the body he wanted you to be made manifest in you remember we spoke about uh about how God building his spiritual body Through the Ages Martin Luther being in the feet and coming up Wesley the cleansing of the body and then coming up to the the age just the age of the tongues uh you know and then going up to the seeing age of the eyes of prophetic eyes of the Prophet The Eagle Vision amen and then from there beyond that brother Branham said beyond that seeing age there are no more moving parts right we are broken into what you break into the mind of God you begin to break into the fullness of the revelation of the word they only had partial partial light partial light partial light they are part of it as much as we are but but they but the servants that come in the last part of the day gets the same pay like those who started in the morning hour praise the name of the Lord salvation is of the Lord and salvation is for every one of us who would recognize that I am a part of that thank you amen and so here we are not expressing the feet or the tongues that's why the prophet stress you are not in the Pentecostal age you may act like Pentecostal you may shout like Pentecostal you may dance like Pentecost Rejoice like Pentecostal but the truth the Revelation in Your Heart Makes the difference right there you are not Pentecostals you are Sons and Daughters of the promise you are Sons and Daughters of the word of God for this hour praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God to be made expressed in their due season in the right Church age that you might manifest if you weren't Luther you'll be manifesting the age of the feet you'll be manifesting what the food can do if you weren't loot Wesley's age who was speaking sanctification and spiritual cleansing that's what you you would be expressing right if you were in the Pentecostal age you would come in that age manifesting signs wonders Miracles and uh and tongues and everything else because that's the age you were supposed to be in prison but this age up here these Believers can manifest all those down there all the other things that are done there because they are not off that they came out from the churches we came out of the church ages we were but we are not of the churches Jesus came true Mary but he is not off Mary he come from God and he goes back to God we come through the church ages but we are not of the church ages we are beyond the churches yes we are broken out of the seven day week and may have broke into the Eighth Day the new day the rising of the Sun the son of man Christ Jesus being revealed again not in the physical form but in the spirit being making himself known by the opening of his own word god being his own interpreter and with us to make himself plain and known to every one of us praise the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah close listen praise the Lord these elect brother Brandon says this as I am saying no he says but to go on now with this thought these elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these same elect are called by another name praise the Lord Romans 4 16. therefore it is a faith that it might be by Grace not by law to the end the promise might be sure to all this seed all the seed amen not that only which is of the law but to what also witches of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all praise the Lord amen we are going to come to that in a moment Romans 9 7 to 13. neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all the children just because you're a Seed of Abraham that doesn't mean you're an elect you see see because it was in Isaac that the seed was called in Isaac but what happened they were born of Abraham too but but they were not elect uh it's like us saying today they are part of the church there or they're Christian oh they're religious but no it's of the elect is that right this is according to Spirit not according to flesh even though your father may be a holy man even though your father might be an Abraham or your father could be this or Samuel or whoever matter of fact some of the preachers uh children were the worst Aaron's sons and daughters or you know different ones in the Bible sometimes they're they end up being the worst because it's got nothing to do with if I am Holy it means that my children will be holy and then you want to look dung on me because my children did this and your child did that what's my child got to do with me if you understand what what to do with me they're going to make their own decisions do their own life do whatever they want to do it's not me amen I'm going I teach them I give them the word and after they come to their time responsibility it's up to them what they do with it but I have the word within my heart I stand upon the word of God this is my election this is not by Dr Sparks training this is not my human psychology amen we do what we can do this is the traps and these are the prisons of the mind and of the soul that Satan took people in this message and put them into spiritual bondage parents taking the children and lock them up into religious cages where they can't do this they cannot do that they can't talk to this person they can't do that you know what God says no it's not like that right if they are the seed of God it does not commit sin it can't go beyond a certain point look before I was even as we say it uh repent born again or get called I I didn't know what was wrong with me and you could think the same thing of yourself I can go so far with certain things when I get to a certain point I use the term something would stop me I don't know what it is I couldn't help other boys can take up a bottle or take something dangerous and do something or chop somebody hit somebody's tab so I couldn't do it I couldn't go beyond a certain point and every one of us would have had God has your point where you how far you can go so far no further you're not going any further than this the woman at the well went so far he says oh yeah you had five boyfriends I know that you had five of them and five of them you know was uh you know were men that maybe were single but this one now is a married man and yeah I watched I seen all of that and and just permitted it if you want to put it that way but when it gets to this I got to put a red line here I gotta put a stop to it so far no further amen the one I have now is not your own it's somebody else's oh my she drank that water on the tree of life the River of Life and and that water fell upon the sea that was in our soul and that seed spent to life she recognize amen you are the word you are the Messiah you are the one that's supposed to come amen and ran back to her Village and begin to tell everybody what had happened in her soul oh blessed be the name of the Lord listen this is a pause here from the beginning to preach it's not really the goal is not really to build up a big huge Church if you want to say that I already had some of that on the mountain when there was over 500 on something people coming on the streets were clogged in cars and everything else and the eagle they took a picture of the of the church sign and there was the eagle sitting in a nest uh in the sign praise God hallelujah and the picture was not taken by us this is taken by the photographer that's supposed to do the sign who was there but praise the name of the Lord why was that it was God moving by his Spirit God accomplishing these things for his glory but the whole thing is like you uh put a pot to boil and you put some vegetables in it and and it's filled up to the top but when you turn you look back the thing is gone right now it's not that you lose anything or it's gotten less it's just God bringing it down to where he wants it for his glory for his honor and that is what has happened and is happening in the message is that right we are not here to develop you as Church chickens but we are not here to preach uh what you call in a farmer whatever's gospel or doctrine a little Peck here a little Peck there and a Peck Peck here and a Peck there no no no we are here to bring to you the fullness of the word of God that's what you want to do with it right we are not here to beat it in you we're not here to pound it into you we're not we're not here I understand now we're not here to persuade using Gifts of persuasion and conversion using uh the different things that they teach as I was taught to in the school ministerial schools how to make people feel so empathetic empathies and pull out emotions and do this and create that no we're not here for that because realize those are the works of men that is the science uh given in these various theological schools and that is not what God wants God wants us to teach the people the fullness of the word then out of the word he will do his own calling he will do his own calling his own convictions his own convincing you need to be baptized he will tell them come home to him he will tell you amen praise God so we're not here to owe to build up a great big Organization no we are here to build a body of Christ by Revelation not a body by Egypt religious education but my revelation of the word praise be to God hallelujah oh my glory to God hallelujah so God now therefore let me quote the scripture first therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end The Promise by might be sure to all the seed I have not come here to save everybody but I come for the lost sheep right of the House of Israel the lost sheep that's what he really come for right praise the Lord now also witches of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all father of us all let me use that term so you understand here now now God Elohim there wanting to express himself into flesh right Satan the cunning evil Wicked one when God spoke and God brought Adam here right away the devil won't Express himself in the flesh also you got me he's always a copycat so he wants to express himself also in the flesh But realize let's go back a little here that when God was going to express his sons and daughters and put them into flesh it means without Satan's insertion of himself into the human race the entire human race would have been Sons and Daughters of God there will only be one race on this Earth and they all would be sons and others of God but Satan through the process of the sin of him and Eve brought a a situation of a seed of discrepancy he brought the seed of discrepancy now now you have to wonder which human has the lexed in them or the germ or the gene of God and which one does not have it and you see it brought a confusion God is not the author of confusion no Satan is the artery of confusion and that's why he create that confusion right there now this scripture is referring to all of that by telling you now out of Abraham came what Ishmael and Isaac and righteous father righteous mother righteous parents amen I'm remembering another quote now where the prophets are yes and so from that Holy place yonda came but good and evil Satan come from there and Michael the angel comes from there praise God see it's not just saying oh it's a father holy mother a father is a bishop or whatever a preacher so the children are support no they have to be who they are by the grace of God we just pray for them we just help one another we pray for one another that's what we are here for amen praise the Lord no we see he created also flesh so that there is doubt now because you don't know really what you are dealing with amen praise God and so now even though all flesh maybe religious and may even say we are believing right the election is not by Behavior praise God it's not by works by faith by Revelation it's my election of whom God chooses I think I'm going to start even though you can be eating the richest meal but after a while you feel full you feel your hand enough for the day you can eat some more tomorrow is that right so uh quickly to sense that and realize that I know I have to bring this now to an end for today by the grace of God hallelujah so recognize friends that it's like that though they came out from this same mother and father because Satan created a confusion if that confusion or the first sin wasn't there the entire human race would have been seeds seeds Sons and Daughters of God is that right Satan that's the seed of discrepancy that is where he caused the discrepancy where there is no doubt you don't know we don't know whose son whose daughters of God and who's the devil who's of serpent seed or who is this or who's that right that's what that's why the word test becomes important now because one will respond to the word and one will hate the word even while it is behaving religiously and believing so-called even while it's behaving like that like the Pharisees and Sadducees examples are in the Bible there praise God that they will behave that way amen yes sir so um amen the Paul is telling us here in the word of God neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all the children of God no but in Isaac shall the seed be called what I'm preaching here realize that Paul understood this and that's why he he's preaching it here now uh whether those people understood back there I don't know brother Branham said that Paul was preached I preached what Paul preached he preached this this stuff already I'm preaching it here praise God and I'm preaching what the prophet preached he preached this stuff already it's just that we didn't understand we didn't get a revelation of it praise God hallelujah amen but in Isaac shall the seed be called that is there which are the children of the flesh are not the children of God but the children of the promise the children of the promise they are counted foreseen amen praise God hallelujah and so those are the election of God who feel the pull and recognize the word for their age that God begins to identify as a sons and his daughters his children for the age that we are living in now praise the Lord you you have to know when to stop and I'm going to stop now praise the Lord and God bless you don't just listen to these things and oh that was that was the all right sermon and you just walk no meditate on these things praise the Lord not because I am saying it but because the word not me the word that is going up that's the word you must regard and that's the word you must listen listen to it again and see what God will tell you because God's word is like as the prophet said it clearly it's like a diamond I'll see one facet of it the Brilliance of it come out and catch my attention but you may not see that I may be seeing blue and he's seeing pink right the next one is yellow but it's the same word of God it's what God is revealing to you and he wants you to know for the Bible tells us cleanly while the musicians are coming that how that um he leads his children and the Sheep into the pasture and he feeds the Sheep right he tells Peter feed my sheep right praise God but he knows exactly what portion each of one of us needs this morning that is why you will come to church and you may be speaking something in your car you might have prayed about it last night all of a sudden the preachers speak in it the man of God because the man of God didn't hear something maybe some of them do but I don't do that I cut off myself or from that long time ago you know just wait some God and he may not come to the pulpit knowing anything but once he starts speaking then the word goes out to meet the need that is in your heart which is a different thing that is in your heart or in that person's heart the word knows to do it just like on a day of Pentecost is that right while Peter yet spake these words he just spoke in the Hebrew language but all the rest of them were hearing him in their languages you are hearing the word as it feeds you and meets your condition your situation and gives you the answers that you seek and you need praise God aren't you glad you serve a God Like That let us just buy our heads for a brief movement as we talk to God the worship leader will will come and he will lead us in a few songs of worship Prophet said after the preaching it's good to sing and worship a little bit so that the word of God could sink them in your soul and you could Rejoice over the word that you heard Heavenly Father foreign here today Prophet said Lord thank you just walked into here by your own choice or by chance you're walked in here because you were led by the Holy Spirit and being led by the spirit then there's something you had for every one of us father I pray you'll bless each one Lord Jesus drawn near [Music] oh thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord [Music] thank you Jesus you cannot fail you do not lie we welcome your presence we welcome your word your promise we repent of our all of our known sins some we may not even remember but we we ask for cleansing and forgiveness

falling apart of the world we're watching for your coming we are Vigilant watching waiting for that great hour when you pull us into your divine presence forevermore he'd touch me oh oh he touched me
