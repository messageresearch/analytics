[31:47] Jesus was there speaking to their lives
[31:52] speaking to their needs he knew what who
[31:55] exactly was sitting amongst him he would
[31:58] call them out by name some of them and
[32:00] they would be mesmerized well today he's
[32:03] doing the same thing and if you will
[32:06] just allow his spirit this morning to
[32:09] take control of that vessel just like we
[32:12] heard he doesn't know this is a visitor
