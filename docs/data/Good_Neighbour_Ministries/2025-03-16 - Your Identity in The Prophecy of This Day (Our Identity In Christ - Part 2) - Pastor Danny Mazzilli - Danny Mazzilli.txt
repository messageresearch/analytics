uh continue where we left off uh from last week but before that how many has a requests that they'd like to say Lord remember this need remember remember me as the word comes forth today Lord may it just like a Target take control of that situation whatever it might be father we see uplifted Hands everywhere oh God and we ask that your anointing and your spirit will just move through the word of God as it comes forth this morning Lord we have come to yield The Vessel Lord that's all we can do father we've done our part we've studied we've prepared now we need your anointing your spirit to come and and anoint the word and and bring it to life in every heart according to every need and Lord remember Sister Deborah this morning touch her body Lord raise her up completely whole uh Lord we know that you're still the great physici in our midst and we will never look anywhere else but to you because you're the Lord God that Health all all disease father thank you for that Lord bless those that are listening in today Lord let there be a PO portion of your word for them Lord may it bring life and Liberty and we'll give you praise glory and honor for it all Lord in Jesus name amen praise God God bless you Saints we're going to read our scripture um we're going to continue um we've been looking at our ident our identity in Christ and uh specifically your identity in the prophecy of this day because prophecy is happening all around us amen it's one thing to be able to see it happening but it's another thing to see where you fit and how it's happening around you and how it's going to affect your life and your present and your future amen 1 Corinthians chapter 13 verses 9 and 10 and 10 says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away God bless you may be seated amen last week we were looking at Mary and we we looked at how the Holy Spirit uh brought it out for us how how only it was it could only the word could only have come to Mary at that appointed time because the prophecy had been given God knew exactly what would be required this was now God coming to redeem coming to fulfill the Plan of Redemption Mary was the only one that that he could come to amen because Mary would be the one that would be the carrier of the antidote to reverse the curse of death amen she did not have the seed she was a carrier of the seed amen the angel of the Lord said the Holy Ghost shall come over thee and thou shalt bring forth a son and his name Shall be Called Emmanuel God With Us because now Jesus Christ was in the stage now where he himself would have to come pay the price for the sin and the unbelief and take the sin to Calvary so that he could bring and allow the Holy Ghost which is the antidote in this day and in this hour amen praise God that's the only thing that's going to take you out of this great mess that the world is going into to right now glory to God Amen and so Mary was a type of the Bride she was a virgin she could not have been touched by anybody just like the church for this day and this hour Christ is going to restore Adam back to the original like it was in the beginning and in Adam was Eve their name was Adam they were one amen they were of the same material they were God made flesh God In His Image amen praise God and God now is restoring that back again where Jesus Christ the the the the the male aspect of Adam coming down by the Holy Ghost after going to Calvary like we heard let us never forget the importance and the value and the the the the the the Supreme uh uh purpose of his uh going to Calvary so that he could give us his life amen praise God and so we are ordained the bride the church the the wise virgin the one that's that she can't be touched by man's in by by man's Doctrine she cannot be a part of a of a denominational church can you see how how the Virgin Mary she had no connection whatsoever amen God had to come to a pure unadulterated virgin and he's looking for a bride in this day without spot or wrinkle glory to God Amen she was only the carrier praise God and so now when Christ went to Calvary he overcame sin so that the Holy Ghost could come back on an elected lady reverse the curse of the Beast the beastly nature that was injected back in the Garden of Eden when the serp went and injected Satan injected his seed into into Eve's womb which would bring forth a beastly nature uh born in sin we heard the scripture that brother uh philli read that in in iniquity was I formed in my mother's womb he had a revelation of this curse that was upon man kind and the only way that it could be reversed was Christ himself come down by the the Holy Ghost calling individuals coming to individuals just like he went to Mary he had to go to a predestinated son and daughter of God in these last days in the end time so that he could so that he could place his Spirit his seed and awaken the the the attribute that was already in you from before the foundations of the world that's why you can't you can't be a part of denomination you can't take the name of Baptist Presbyterian uh uh Jehovah Witness uh whatever name you can't take that name because there's no other name whereby man must be saved but by the name of Jesus Christ and only his seed can you receive and only his attribute can you bring forth amen praise God what an hour Saints and so today we want to continue praise God we want to continue and we want to move on and we want to read our next scripture here in Acts chapter 2 vers 17 and 18 and it says and it shall come to pass in the last days how many believe we're in the last days amen sayith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh so now we need to see right in there that it that it's going on All Flesh but not all flesh contains attributes of God Amen I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy amen praise God Saints this is the power where where the the the true church that has received the Holy Ghost has the spirit of Prophecy upon her she will prophesy she will not only prophesy but she will recognize the prophecy that is taking place around her amen praise God glory to God let's go to the next slide and it continues and it says and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the Earth Earth beneath blood and fire and vapor and smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord so we now recognize by this scripture that there are going to be signs that are going to take place there are going to be things that are going to happen around us before the great and notable day of the Lord what is the Great and notable day of the Lord praise God we're going to see here and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved listen I don't know about you I know that we've heard this you know he that believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved but they need to recognize that we're in the end times and that there are things that are happening and prophecy that is being fulfilled around our lives and if you're not awake then you don't see your part in the prophecy you end up becoming one of those that are lost in in the unbelief thinking they have a form of godliness but actually denying the power of God denying his word but those that recognize the signs those that recognize the prophecy that's taking place they've been awakened and they know that they've come into contact with with the word with the spirit of God that they've received the Holy Ghost that they've been awakened that they've been born again their life is no longer the same life that they had they know that they know that this is a true experience and a reality to them amen praise God so when we look at some of the events and the timing of these events we can see how close we are to to major world events that can Usher in the Great Tribulation the great Wars that the Bible talks about and even more important the great and notable day of the Lord amen praise God we have the war between Israel and Hamas this this war is not just a a petty War it's the worst that it's ever been since World War II it's the worst that it's ever been since World War II this war is escalating it's not getting any better I know they're in the midst of a ceasefire but we know according to prophecy what is going to come what is going to happen how this is all going to unfold how that that the holy spirit is now finishing up with the Gentile Church how the holy spirit is is is uh uh speaking to us here in these last days quickening and and and just gleaning picking out the last one here calling the last one because Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come not one can be lost and so the the message of Christ in this hour is come out of her my people come out of the denominational teachings the doctrines of man you are a virgin spotless bride that's been ordained by Christ himself self to come out and be filled with his spirit so that you can fulfill the notable day of the Lord which is the rapture amen the coming of the lord we have tensions right now between the US and China and Russia because China and Russia do not agree with the stand that the US is taking with Israel because you know that that that that the Hamas and the houthis and all of these uh you know uh identities these are these are backed by Iran this all goes right back to the very beginning right back to the amalekites amen right back to the Garden of Eden where Satan where Cain and Abel Cain killing his brother it's the same two spirits that have been fighting all the way through amen praise God and so the US is making threats to Iran because of their nuclear Ambitions and so forth and we know that World War III is going to be nuclear amen praise God you know I mean it's nothing you know to be excited and to be happy about but we can't stop prophecy and we need to recognize where we fit into the prophecy amen glory to God so you know this um I don't know if you noticed but this Thursday and Friday was the Jewish Festival of purum Amen people know that glor glory to God you know um 39 years ago yesterday I married uh my Queen Esther you know purum purum was um was uh a festival that uh that now you know uh correlates and is um uh you know a Jewish Festival that they do every year in in com commemoration of the the Jewish people being set free right back you can read all about it in the Book of Esther you know where hmon who was a wicked you know descendant of the amalekites looking to destroy all of the Jewish people and Esther coming on the scene and you know Finding favor with the King and made The Plea and the decree was reversed and so forth and so today the Jewish people celebrate it as the season and the time of purum it it happens right around the uh you know they call it the 15th of Adar which is sometime in between February and March it's usually but this week it landed on the 13th and the 14th of March amen and so it's the it's the season of purum and you know I was just thinking I telling my wife you know as we were celebrating our anniversary yesterday I said you know that we got married right in purum right around that time you know like there's all all these little types that you know you can't help it you're just looking and you you can't help but see the how the spirit of God was in our lives we didn't know it we didn't recog recognize amen and that's why even Esther she had no idea you know she was a Jewish girl had no idea that she was going to become the queen amen my wife had no idea that she was going to marry me I thank God that it's the character of Esther and not that of vashi Glory to God I'm so thankful to the Lord for a wonderful wife and 39 years of marriage amen and so the true church Esther on the other hand displays the true church the bride of Christ in her humil her humility submission to the king Christ his word purum commemorates the saving of the Jewish people and uh and the decree and so um you know let's look at the next slide so this week was the Feast of purum and there was a blood moon on March the 14th and um if you actually you know I've been kind of taking a deep dive into Esther and and the Book of of Esther and and the whole story and everything behind purum and um it's pretty fascinating amen and today we're just kind of laying in a little bit of a foundation for what's going to be coming because I believe that the Lord is just leading me into uh you know uh we're going to continue to move on with the same thought of of your identity in Prophecy and your identity in Christ and recognizing how you fit in the whole prophecy and you know that the whole book of Esther is basically the whole Prophecy of the bride and of the Jewish people and right from start to finish it's wonderful we're going to be looking at it and and uh we're going to draw some wonderful nuggets but at the same time I want you to realize that these signs that we see you know uh these blood moons and and so forth these are signs in the heaven we know that God's first Bible is in the heavens amen and God declares everything first in the heavens and then he declares it on the earth now the bride of Christ we're not looking at these signs to uh to to um you know significantly do something for us because we've already recognized our day we already know what we are to produce but these signs and wonders are for the world these signs will be looked back upon because before the Great notable day of the Lord these signs shall be shown and they shall be and they shall be remembered and they shall be uh a testimony of the prophecies and the things that God said that he would do according to his word amen praise God you know that there was a that these Blood Moons if you you can actually go back into nasau and you can go back into their records and they've got records that go back thousands of years you know right back to the time of Esther which was uh basically between 483 and 473 BC right which is about 2500 years ago all right that that that this and there were eclipses there were Blood Moons on the exact same times there was a blood moon at the time of the first purum and now we've had we had one last year we've got another one this year and there's another one uh scheduled for next year Blood Moons they represent and have a purpose I'm not going to get into all of the indepth of of uh you know what's behind all of that but just so that you know you know last week we had a a a seven planetary alignment this week the lunar eclipse that's what this is this is a these are eclipses these are eclipses of the moon when the moon covers the Sun or when the sun covers the moon amen and so even last year we were looking at you know signs the heavens and we were seeing how you know how the the the there was two lunar eclipses from 2017 and 2024 we looked at the significance of those dates the timing on it it wasn't just coincidence that these were these these were eclipses that were that went that were seen and went right across the USA one way and then right across the USA another way creating a cross creating the Alpha and the Omega you know with the lines that went through it it was all God showing uh and giving signs of things that are happening in America look what's happened from last year to this year look at the changes that are taking place around us recognize that these are signs in the heavens that are declaring God's prophetic word and the things that he is doing and for the Sons and Daughters of God to recognize that we are getting closer that the Rapture is at hand the notable day of the Lord at hand amen praise God Celestial signs let's look at our next scripture in 1 Thessalonians chap 5: 1 to4 but of the times and the seasons Brethren ye have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night amen here we are we're seeing how it here it is again the day of the Lord now if you look at uh you know Thessalonians um if you look at Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16 which is the the the chapter just before this we know Paul is speaking about the Rapture he's talking about in 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise from first so this this day of the Lord this notable day of the Lord is the rapture it's the coming of the lord it's where God comes to snatch his sons and his daughters like a thief in the night a lot of people are placing this scripture into the future not realizing that it's already in progress you see if you've recognized your part in the prophecy you see where you fit in the prophecy amen for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction these are things that are happening right now right here right in the 21st century you're witnessing them you're reading them uh uh every single day you're reading about different events and things that are going on Amen praise God and it says then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in the darkness you see when when when when the when the solar eclipse comes out and the blood moon comes out to us we look at that and we recognize that it's the blood of Christ that's covered us that's given us an escape that that's our identity that Jesus Christ the blood of Christ the word of God is our safe place amen am we are not in the darkness anymore people are in denomination there there you ask them how are you baptized they I got baptized as a baby I don't know how I was baptized I think it was in the name of the father and the in the titles they don't they don't really know they're in darkness and they don't know it but thy light has come amen blessed be the name of the Lord your light has come and that light is is here now it's taken you that you should not be in darkness that that day should not overtake you as a thief but the Holy Ghost has snatched you away like a thief in the night amen praise God he's he's taken you and he's hidden you and he's placed you where in the body of Christ glory to God that you have recognized the day and the hour and recognized your day and the message for your day Hallelujah let's read our next scripture we're not going to be spending a lot of time where this is just laying in a little foundation and then we're going to go into the Lord's Supper but uh you know just just something to to you know stir our hearts and and and bring us into an awareness of the hour that we're living in and how close we actually are of the Holy Spirit translating us and changing these mortal bodies it says in Luke 21:25 and there sh Jesus speaking and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves are going to be roaring Saints do you know that we know that there's distress in all the nations we know there's constant distress the United Nations they're having meeting after meeting there's meetings in Qatar there's meetings in the US there's meetings between you know pu uh Putin and and and uh uh they're you know the Chinese president and Iran's president and so forth they're all in distress of Nations because they don't know what's going to happen they don't realize that prophecy is upon them amen and that the world is going to go into total chaos but there's a there's a church there's a bride there's a people that that have recognize the hour recognize the prophecy that she is to fulfill she's going to be changed in the moment and in the twinkling of an eye glory to God she's going to fulfill the Rapture she's going to be as she's that's going to be her Escape in this day and in this hour amen not some Theory or some some uh you know some uh fairy tale it's a reality amen and you know that you've already been snatched from the world you know that you're not the same person that you were before this message got a hold of your heart amen you know that you've been changed you've been transformed you've been taken out of the world you realize it you you just don't mix with the world the same way that you used to amen praise God glory to God and so uh there these signs and these perplexities of Nations and distress this is all going on listen there was a 100 million us residents under under uh weather warnings over a 100 million under weather warnings right across the us yesterday did you know that there's been I don't know how many people that quite a few people have been killed from from uh uh hurricanes and tornadoes that are sweeping through places unusual times there's been temperature swings from as high as 75 degrees down to 20 degrees there's been like like abnor like you want to talk about the waves roaring that's what causes the weather you know that it's it's the weather is all starts because of waves that are roaring and moving together in the seas and and the world is in all kinds of turmoil it's in birth pain Saints the world is in birth pains amen but we've recognized glory to God here I I just want to read um you know in Luke 21 from verse 26 carrying on here it says men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are are coming on the earth people are fearful people are one like like you know oh my God is Canada going to be invaded is Trump GNA actually invade Canada you know people are like you know like you just don't know what's going to happen now I'm not I don't believe that that's going to happen but listen when when everything goes into fullblown war and and uh Nation starts really uh rising up against nation and and things really start to get very uh hot a Canada is going to be pulled into it one way or the other so the people the people are you know they're they're they're they're worried they're they're they're fearful and their hearts are failing for fear for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken amen praise God and they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory well when you look at this scripture and that particular statement you know it struck me when I was reading that yesterday and studying I was thinking Lord we've seen that we've recognized that in 1963 the great we we saw the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory that was the second coming of the Lord but yet this here all these things that are happening around us and I was thinking about I said oh and the and the Holy Spirit showed me and said yes and when the time comes that that that everything will be exposed and the word will be made plain and the bride goes in the Rapture then people will be able to look back those that are left behind and they're going to see the cloud they're going to see the the the magazine article they're going to go back and maybe listen to a message that Pastor Danny spoke on on the cloud in 1963 and they're going to realize then and actually see it then but it's going to be too late my goodness praise God because by you re listen this cloud and what it represented is what we are now feeding on and being changed in a moment in the twinkling of it we're we're being changed line upon line precept upon precept because the word of God for our day that's what it was the Bible became a new Bible amen we've received we've recognized and you can Rejoice that you have seen the cloud amen the son of man coming in his glory amen glory to God and so you know this whole time and season of purum we need to realize that it's not coincidental that we see these distresses of Nations look on purum March the 14th last Friday just two days ago Russia China and Iran met in Beijing they met and engaged in indepth discussions on the latest state of play with regard to nuclear issue and sanctions lifting that's not a coincidence Saints you need to recognize what's going on here these three countries emphasized on the necessity of terminating all unlawful unilateral sanctions they're not agreeing in other words they're starting to look to see how Trump is you know working with Israel and coming against Iran amen and here Iran is having meetings with Russia and China because there's tensions between the US and Russia and China and Iran now this is not coincidental Saints we need to be awake this is what this is about recognizing prophecy that is being fulfilled in our days and seeing where and how we fit into all of it amen praise God these are not coincidences yesterday Trump had the US Air Force commence bombings on the houthis to stop them from interfering in the shipments of goods in the Red Sea um acts these are acts of War they're they're they're bombing Yen as we speak Yemen where the houthis are based out of and it's all backed by Iran it all goes back to to uh you know we're going to be looking at this as I was looking at all of this even you know um Ayatollah H and and these players and these characters and their positions their names everything it's all in the word of God thousands of years ago and it's prophetic and it's happening and we're witnessing it and where do you fit in it amen glory to God these are all Celestial signs announcing that his prophecies are coming into fulfillment glory to God Amen Saints we're living in the day when the when when that which is perfect has come Christ is is perfect the perfect word has come the opening of those seals amen the word is now in its fullness revealed to the called out Sons and Daughters of God those that have recognized what God is doing in this hour amen prophecy is being fulfilled all around us and if your eyes are open to see it then you'll be able to recognize the players all those that are that are that are fulfilling their part in the prophecy they're not aware but you can sit back back and you can look into the scripture and you can identify each one you can see the hour the time the season of these things that are happening and you can know that that your day is is is approaching quicker it's coming sooner and sooner than you think amen the bride cannot be here when this goes when this whole world goes into Great Tribulation amen glory to God she's got to be gone because God Jesus Christ does not let his wife go into tribulation no sir you can see it all in the tipe forms going back through the scriptures I don't want to get into all of them but here we are and where do you identify with the current day of Prophecy do you see yourself in the message of the hour do you see yourself having recognized that God sent a prophet do you see yourself identified with the opening of those Seven Seals and what they represent glory to God do you know that God sent Malachi 45 William Mariam Branham one of the messengers of the seven Church ages one of the restoration Messengers not only that but he's the one that introduced us to Jesus Christ The Mighty angel that came down in in 1963 when he put his foot on the land and the Sea the angel of God William Branham the seventh Church age messenger the the the angel to this church had to be on the earth at the time of the coming of the Lord amen so that he could introduce him just the same way that John the Baptist was the identifier of Jesus Christ Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world Amen have we recognized those things do I do we identify ourselves in the scriptures amen praise God but about that day or hour the Lord will come as a thief in the night like it says in Mark 13 and are you still waiting for something to happen or have you recognized that you've been snatched away thank Hallelujah glory to God Saints first Corinthians says that we'll be Chang in the twinkling of an eye amen at the last Trump glory to God Amen I believe there's a trump that's going to be the last Trump right now sitting in the White House amen praise God and there's going to be prophecy fulfilled the Lord himself self amen glory to God listen as we as we wind this down now we're going to be done here in about 10 minutes and then we're going to go into the Lord's Supper when we look at what has taken place in our day in Revelations chap 10: 1 to 7 we need to be aware of what's happened how it's changed the whole Christian Church world how recog recognizing that is of of vital importance Saints I know I've repeated this over and over again but I want to read it again amen Revelations 10 1-7 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire that is none other than the Lord himself amen and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice and when a lion as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not those listen what was in what was in those Thunders was the was the revelation of the mystery of Jesus Christ it could not be written and it'll never be written because it can only be revealed it's not something that you will be able to read it'll be something that is revealed to you by the opening of the word and here he says he says write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are therein are and the earth and the things that are therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer Saints we have crossed into another church age the prophecy of this hour and the Fulfillment of this very scripture back in 1963 would introduce the mighty Angel himself whereby he would translate and move the church from time to Eternity from a time of from from a from a a church age where where where where the doctrines and the teachings of man would be completely uh set aside and it would be the mighty Angel himself Christ himself that would come into that that very church and reveal himself and identify himself identify his word identify the prophecy of his word in the day that we are living so that this world could know that that his whole Plan of Redemption was not just about doctrines of man and about a history of somebody that went to the cross and somebody that died 2,000 years ago ago but that he was a living present God that was going to vindicate his word to this generation and to this people and to this to to this world in this day and in this hour amen praise God time should be no more amen no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel it wasn't William brandham who was who was the the the the the mighty Angel William Bram was not the mighty Angel but his voice amen was used to bring forth the the opening of the word his voice was used to speak those Thunders amen something that you would not be able to interpret that's why when those seals were open you could not if if man was going to try to interpret those seals he would have made a mess of them even William brandom would have made a mess of them if not for the angel of the Lord coming in and opening the word and making it real to him what actually took place by Vision he could actually see everything that was taking place at that time but in the days of his voice that's why it's called the voice of God Recordings it's not the voice of William brandham recordings it's the voice of God Recordings amen glory to God and that's what that's what we Feast on that's why that's why your birth can never come by just listening to tapes if the Holy Ghost is in you and the attribute seed of God is in you when you hear the words that are being spoken by the anointing of the Holy Spirit on The Voice it quickens you it transforms you it takes you out of the world of sin that you were brought up in it separates you from this world it makes you somebody that you never thought you could be a son or a daughter of the Living God amen glory to God it'll and listen what it says here when he shall begin to sound the mystery the mystery of God oh saints of God this is this is wonderful the mystery of God what is the mystery of God it's him amen it's him from Genesis all the way to Revelation mysteriously revealing himself in simple people like Gabriel and simple people like brother Phillip and simple people like like Michelle and simple people like like like Joy listen it's it's the Holy Spirit come down to reveal himself make himself known in in simple people amen glory to God it's the mystery of God and that's why the people you you can't you can't put yourself into this oh I belong to this church oh I believe God sent sent a prophet that's good you need to believe that God sent a prophet but what did he send them for to Quicken you Amen to Quicken your mortal Body by the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead if he comes and possesses you you can go in the Rapture only then can you go in the Rapture Hallelujah as he had declared unto his servants the prophets and I'll and I'll just close out with a couple of quick quotes here I want you to see something here in the future home of the the Heavenly bridegroom and the Heavenly and the Earthly bride he says now in Ephesians 1: 10 it's called now if you're putting it down Ephesians 1:10 is called not a dispensation not a seventh day it's called the fullness of time the full listen the time of man is over the time of man's teaching of the word of God and figuring out the word and saying we've got it figure out we got the new age interpretation we they it's over for them the teachings of man and of time because these bodies of time are only to pertain to this Earthly Dimension amen but it's going to be changed it's going to be changed these bodies are going to be changed amen praise God and he goes on to say here the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled build pay attention when there is no more time then you go into eternity that's why we're not feeding on the word of a man we're not feeding on just tapes we're feeding on the spirit we're feeding on the on the on the anointed word of God that's that that that you can't interpret yourself it's it's it's being fed to you where the Eagles gather there the carcass is which is what the fresh word the fresh Mana that's why they could not listen it was all a type back in the wilderness when God was dropping Mana in the wilderness to the to the children of Israel he said don't keep any for the next day because it's coming fresh hallelujah it's going to come directly to you you're going to you're going to get exactly what you need for that body change amen you just need to stay in the word you need to connect yourself with the word not with some movement not with some teaching not with some seven Thunder Doctrine not with some some deity Doctrine you've got to stay with Christ himself he's here now amen praise God he says when there is no more time amen it's over and listen what he goes he goes after the seventh Church age is over and it is pardon me it's over really you mean you mean we've we've we've moved into another dimension you mean you mean it's that Capstone it's that it's that place where where only Christ you know there was a gap between the church ages and the Capstone and you can't get yourself there you can't be oh I was born I'm I'm the son of brother so and so he knew brother brandham so what you need to be born again and you need the Holy Ghost to take you over into that place amen only the Holy Ghost can bring you there praise God he says here this and this and it's over Luther's age is over Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is over oh I know that they don't want to hear that but you know they they they they they say to us oh you you've got a Pentecostal Spirit on you they don't recognize that the Holy Ghost is in justification in sanctification in the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the spirit in the gifts of the Holy Ghost he doesn't change but his word is moving on and it's a Rapture message it's one of perfect faith and Revelation that can only take you over amen so the Pentecostal age is over and now you go into what eternity no more sevens no more threes no more other there in eternity where there is no such time as numbers and times and things Oh Glory to God God Saints what hour are we living in glory amen thank you Jesus when we look around we see the conditions of the world it's under perplexity we're in a Sodom condition saints come on now call it the way it is we're in a Sodom condition the world is is is so it's so uh uh divided so divided you've got one on the left and you got one on the right and and they're both way out and none of them are right that's why we don't get involved with politics we know who the father of politics is he stood there before Jesus when he temped him in the 40 days and he offered him all the kingdoms of the world he says they're all mine who was that Satan am I'll give them to you if you bow to me we do not bow to politics we do not get caught up oh Trump I'm voting for Trump oh I'm gonna vote for Kamala I'm gonna vote for Trudeau I'm gonna vote for this guy I'm gon it's all political noise it's all the perplexity of Nations they're going into the pro into the prophecy that they're supposed to come into they can't help it they're going to fall into the prophecy whether they like it or not and the world is in a Sodom Condition it's in a it's in a condition where it does not uh uh respect the authority of God's word amen praise God New Age teachings and everything else Jesus said in Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be when he comes and reveals himself amen and he's come and done it let's read the last uh uh quote and then we're and we'll be done 1964 proving his word and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed he's been revealed have you recognized him have you do you know that he's already come that he's here he's now speaking by the by the preaching the foolishness of the preaching of his word just like when he was on the earth he'd go into the synagogues and he opened the scripture and he was standing there the word imagine the word open opening the word and turned to them and said this day this scripture is be is fulfilled before your very eyes they couldn't take it they couldn't accept it they couldn't there's no way and that's why when when you tell somebody that you've received the word and that you are now actually the manifestation of that word because you're that church you're you're Mary you're you're you're the carrier of the word now in this day and in this hour because the curse has been reversed on your life you don't you're no longer headed for death Jesus said he that believeth my word shall pass from Death unto life amen praise God and Jesus he goes on and he says so in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called see so it's not no longer the the church it's now the bride it's now God God because he knows that that all the churches out there they've taken other men's teachings God came to them and they were already impregnated with with another man's seed he's looking for a for a virgin bride it's all typ form Saints now don't think you can be a virgin in your life and perfect in your living I'm not talking about that as long as you're in this flesh you're going to make mistakes and that's why we come to the Lord's Supper so that we can remember Hallelujah praise God so that we can know what God has done for us amen and what what he's delivered us from in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through all of this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh how's he coming in human flesh in this hour in you and me they don't want to accept accept that they they listen when Jesus walked in human flesh back 2,000 years ago they called him be elab they're going to do and and the priests of that day so that's why I tell everybody check the scriptures search the scriptures for you think you have eternal life but are you sure that you're not calling Jesus be elub because to do it in this hour is eternal damnation you better be careful what you're reading what you're believing and what you're practicing when it comes to the word of God Amen because God's word is now Jesus said you can blaspheme uh me right now but when the Holy Ghost comes when he comes to call the last ones there'll be no it'll be done once the the Rapture is gone and the bride is called and she's in nobody else can come in it's sealed until the day of our Redemption hallelujah hallelujah and so the bridegroom call will come right through all of this chaos that I'm just adding over here when the son of man will come down in human flesh to to unite the two together the church has to be the word you see why I say listen if you're baptized how are you baptized I'm just using that as an example because it's the easiest example and if somebody can't go back and say acts 238 baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ buried in the water my old life got buried in that water and I came up a brand new individual now you could go in a a dry Sinner and come out a wet sinner if you don't have a revelation of what he meant in that death you got to die out to your old thinking your old ways and you've got to allow that that attribute to take control of your life and possess you amen the spirit of God to unite the together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman I don't know do do you see what I mean see it's it's the son of man it's Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United she's already married we're not going to get married the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ was you receiving this message this word and accepting Christ and at that point you became Mrs Jesus you took his name for there's no other name whereby you must be saved but by the name of Jesus Christ do you see the importance of it it's all Earthly it's all part of this Plan of Redemption but it's the only thing if we don't come by the word then we're going to come by some teaching of man and it's going to lead you into tribulation it's not going to lead you into the Rapture glory to God Amen she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage let the brothers come as we go into the the Lord's supper now I don't know if you've recognized but this is the Lord's Supper than you Jesus this word that we're feeding on is the bread of life am the stimulation that you feel when you hear the word and it and it stirs your heart and it makes you rejoice and say amen glory to God that's the stimulation that comes by the wine and the wine represents what the blood and the blood represents what the Holy Ghost and so when we go into the Lord's Supper it's because we are feeding on the present fresh Mana of God's word and we can recognize by looking back that when he says do this in remembrance of me when we read the scripture here in in uh Corinthians 1 Corinthians chap 11 he says for I have received of the Lord that which I which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus Jus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do and and in remembrance of me he was talking about his word he was talking about everything that he had spoken and he was talking about how he was going to give his body as a as a sacrifice for our Redemption so that our sin could be wiped away so that so that he he he became sin so that we could become eternal glory to God Amen and after this manner and the same manner also he took the cup well first let's let's do he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me brother would you pray and give thanks for the bread remember this is not the literal Body of Christ this represents his word what we have just been feasting on his presence his present truth amen go ahead brother thank us now emance that represent the word Lord Jesus would you come this morning be among yes Lord father your upon this that us do it for remembrance of you father thank you for understanding that we are standing in the presence of Father we believe everything that we have done you going to forgive us and father help us to come open heart confess things in our heart before we come to take this we appreciate you so much yes Lord thank you hallelujah thank you in the name amen after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had St saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come brother Phillip would you give thanks for the wine representing his spirit thank you appreciate you for drink amen praise God verse 27 says wherefor whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine him himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat Terry one for another this time I'd like the deacons and some ushers to come and assist and to hand out the emblems quickly everybody hold the bread and hold the wine and we will partake together once we've received it if we could just have some music glory to God what a glorious Victory when we feed on the word of God when we when we know that the bread of life is Christ himself his word his promises there's nothing like fresh bread you know when you you go to a bakery and it smells fresh and there's you know it just it's so desirable well it's the same thing in the word of God when you are actually feeding on the the revealed word the fresh word of God not teachings of man or something that comes out of a catechism and you just do it out of repeat you know every week repeating the same thing and over and over again and and not living that life not having that that that sincerity of the word of God where you know that you're living for him sure you make mistakes we're all human we're going to make mistakes but that's why the blood is there that's why he he he he's he's constantly making intercession in you now the intercession takes place within you so the moment that that the enemy you know deceives you in your flesh and you you say something that you didn't want to say or you do something that you didn't want to do right away that attribute raises up the spirit of God in you and says you know that's not right that's why we need to examine ourselves we need to examine our thoughts our motives and our ideas and our our ways we need to examine so that we can lay it at the altar and say Lord you know my weakness you know where I need your help Father I'm surrendering I'm yielding my spirit unto you oh God and allowing you to take preeminence and have control and then he he he gives you a fresh start you see he listen if you're a son or a daughter of God there's no way you can be lost because Eternal means having no beginning and no end we need to get that understanding when we really surrender unto the Lord and we come to that place place where where we believe it's Christ we believe that his word that he went to Calvary he took my place he took the he took the the most brutal death that man could possibly face in the way that he faced it he didn't want to leave any excuse he he listen he showed that there was no sin that was too bad or too wrong or or or that that that could what can separate us from the love of God he showed it in every example Paul imagine Paul he was killing Christians he was killing our brothers and sisters but yet when the time was was come for God to knock him off his high horse and bring him to a realization of who he really was he wiped away all his sin though Paul had to struggle with his unbelief like you and me we we we can't help it our memories play games with us it's constantly playing you know Havoc with our minds and trying to bring us under condemnation but if you are in Christ today you've surrendered there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus and so you can walk free you can be free you can start brand new today Hallelujah good wine listen good wine needs to be aged it's the only way that it's smooth and it's and and it stimulates in the way that that you know it's all a type Saints and until you come to a place of maturity in your life where you could accept God at his word you'll take the word it it's it's fully matured it's fully stimulated it'll it'll stimulate you like like never before because it's come to it's the word has come to its maturity there's going to be a point where where the Rapture is going to happen and the world is going to go into tribulation that's all part of the word we can't stop it it's all part of the prophecy of God's word and the and the understanding by the Holy Ghost sometimes it's it's it's hard it it stimulates to a place where where wow it it really separates you but you've got to come to that place Saints where you can accept God's prophecy and what he has spoken will happen and take place in our lives praise God forever more Hallelujah examine yourself say Lord check My Heart Lord check my motives Lord God give me a fresh start here as I partake Lord I know that this is just bread that was baked that was made by one of the brothers here and but but I know what it represents father it's it's a representation of your word that what I believe and that's why it's an outward expression as I partake of it it's because I believe your word and this wine I believe that I have the Holy Ghost I have the spirit of God Amen praise [Music] God thank you I trust you've examined your heart and at this time let us partake of the bread and of the wine with Thanksgiving in our hearts raise your hands and say thank you Lord thank you Father thank you for your word today Lord thank you for opening our understanding to recognize the hour and the season that we're living in oh God thank you for Lord for having mercy upon us Lord for cleansing us purging Our Lives giving us a future Lord giving us hope father Lord God thank you for our families and our loved ones and our friends oh God lord may you continue to use us as your instruments of testimony oh God as your uh feet Lord as your hands as your mouth to declare your your goodness Lord and your your love and your mercy towards all mankind father may you continue to use our lives and use them and take them and as you would see fit Lord as we commit them into your wonderful hands father in the precious name of Jesus Christ in St John 13th chapter veres 3 to8 Jesus knowing that the father had given him all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God see he knew exactly why he came he knew exactly who he was he knew that he was God but yet he also knew that he was going to Calvary he knew what he came to do what the purpose was but yet he could humble himself and then it says and he rised from the supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord doth thou wash my feet and Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Lord Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I I wash thee not thou H has no part with me you see he knew exactly what he had to do he was showing the humility that he willingly gave himself though he was a king though he was the king of glory he could humble himself to wash his disciples feet and he said you do the same right do it to one another show that you're that that that you that you're humble enough that when you know when they went into the into the wedding supper every one of them was given a garment that they all looked exactly the same there wasn't Rich poor big small they were all the same and in the kingdom of God as Sons and Daughters of God we are are brothers and sisters and we need to recognize that we need to appreciate one another we need to be able to Humble ourselves to one another and wash each other's feet and when we do so we pray for one another and we show the humility not by putting it on but showing that sincerely you love your brother and your sister you you you you humbly love them and and and wish and pray all good and the love of God and the blessings of God upon their lives how could you not want good Jesus said love one another this I shall know that ye are my children that you show love one for another so at this time I'm going to ask I'm we're going to pray and then I'm going to ask the sisters to go and they can wash each other's feet and the brothers to remain in the sanctuary and that we will wash each other's feet and then we will be dismissed after we are done praise God brother Phillip I'd like you to close us in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we are so grateful that your grace brought us to be part of this to partake of this the communion and everything we so much appreciate you Lord as we are the sisters are going downstairs to wash their feet and the brothers remaining here may you bless the washing of the feet and everything that be done and father God may you take us to our various homes safely and Lord let us than on these things on our way home and throughout the week father until we come back on Wednesday May bless our homes bless our jobs bless everything we do in the week in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise God God bless you Saints [Music]
