[44:50] house of the Lord. And I just pray that
[44:53] God's blessing will rain down upon us
[44:56] and give us a wonderful time of
[44:58] refreshing, revival, restoration, and
[45:02] that we'll walk in the light as he is in
[45:04] the light, having fellowship one with
[45:07] another, the blood of Christ cleansing
[45:09] us from all sin. May the great Holy
[45:12] Spirit take control today. Take control
[45:15] of the speaker so that uh you'll hear
[45:18] him speaking, but let's believe God that
[45:21] he will use his voice to speak to us and
[45:24] lift us higher in the realms of God. God
[45:27] bless you so much. Thank you for having
[45:29] me.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, Amen. Amen. Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[45:38] [Music]
[45:40] We're very grateful
[45:42] for our precious brother. I've got a
[45:44] couple of uh baptismal certificates
[45:46] here. I've got one for Sarah Hope. Amen.
[45:51] God bless you, sister. Where are you? I
[45:52] know you're here. I saw you.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, in Sunday school. Okay, you can give
[45:57] that to her. And uh brother uh Jesse
[46:00] Mitchell, you know, when when he comes
[46:03] here, you can just pass that on. Praise
[46:05] God. They were baptized um at our youth
[46:08] camp this year and uh we want to make
[46:12] sure that they get their uh their
[46:13] official um
[46:16] uh certificates. Not that the
[46:19] certificate does anything more than just
[46:22] remind them, you know, they can put it
[46:24] up on the wall and just remind them of
[46:27] what um their public declaration was
[46:30] before the Lord. Amen. to be baptized
[46:33] because we know that baptism when
[46:35] somebody receives the word for their
[46:38] day. Something changes on the inside of
[46:41] their hearts. They're immediately going
[46:43] to express something on the outside. The
[46:45] scripture says that it's an outward
[46:46] expression of something that has
[46:49] happened on the inside and their lives
[46:51] have been changed. Amen. And their
[46:53] purpose automatically changes now
[46:55] towards the service of the Lord Jesus.
[46:59] Glory to God. Amen. Praise God forever
[47:03] more. Amen.
[47:05] And so
[47:08] may God just bless
[47:12] the service this morning as we go to the
[47:14] word of God. Let's go um to uh to our
[47:18] scripture this morning. We're going to
[47:19] continue along the the lines that we
[47:21] were um last week and over the last this
[47:25] is part seven actually of the purpose of
[47:27] God. I don't know where we're going to
[47:29] end up with this. Um, but I trust that
[47:32] we'll end up in our theophies. Amen.
[47:34] Praise God. Because that is the absolute
[47:36] goal of the word for this day and for
[47:39] this hour is to translate us. And so,
[47:42] um, we've been looking at the purpose of
[47:44] God. Last week, we looked at being
[47:46] called unto adoption. We're
[47:48] predestinated
[47:50] the scripture that we read. And so let's
[47:52] read our scripture from E Ephesians 1:es
[47:56] 9 to1 11
[47:58] saying having made known unto us the
[48:02] mystery of his will. This is what we're
[48:05] this is the message of the hour. This is
[48:07] what we're feeding on right now. It's
[48:09] the mystery of his will according to his
[48:12] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[48:16] himself that in the dispensation of the
[48:19] fullness of times he might gather
[48:22] together in one all things in Christ
[48:27] both which are in heaven and which are
[48:30] on earth. So, meaning he's going to
[48:32] bring together, this is this is talking
[48:34] about the rapture.
[48:36] Those that are in heaven, those that
[48:37] have already been translated, they're
[48:39] already in their theophony bodies.
[48:41] They're in that sixth dimension. Now,
[48:43] he's doing the work on us so that we can
[48:46] be changed and brought into our
[48:49] theophies. Amen. So that we can all
[48:52] together like it says, both which are in
[48:54] heaven and which are on earth, even in
[48:57] him. Amen. In whom, now this is this is
[49:00] where we're going to be going today. In
[49:02] whom also we have obtained an
[49:05] inheritance.
[49:07] Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Christ did not come without
[49:12] a purpose. He came to declare his
[49:16] inheritance, his book, his will. Amen.
[49:21] being predestinated
[49:23] according to the purpose of him who
[49:26] workketh all things after the counsel of
[49:30] his own will.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, we just ask you to take
[49:35] control and Lord, let your spirit have
[49:38] free course this morning. Take control,
[49:41] Lord. uh you're the only one that can
[49:43] break the bread of life to each and
[49:45] every heart and and discern each and
[49:47] every need that's here in our midst this
[49:50] morning. So won't you please come and
[49:52] and speak to us a little while and let
[49:55] our hearts burn within us, Lord, as you
[49:58] as you speak to us along the way. Grant
[50:00] we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[50:03] You may be seated.
[50:06] Praise God. So today um you can go to
[50:09] the next slide. Today we want to look at
[50:10] obtaining our inheritance. Amen. We've
[50:13] been given an inheritance, okay? That
[50:16] Christ has made available for us. And um
[50:19] part of adoption is, you know, where
[50:22] where the son, he, you know, at first he
[50:25] requires tutors, he requires
[50:28] instruction, he requires the leadership
[50:30] and the guidance that comes through the
[50:33] father's uh workmen, through his angels,
[50:37] through the five-fold ministry. Amen.
[50:39] Praise God. This is what we're under
[50:41] now. You know that God is is perfecting
[50:44] the church, a perfecting sons and
[50:47] daughters of God for his purpose. Amen.
[50:50] And so, um, we have an inheritance. And
[50:53] that inheritance is what gives us the
[50:56] authority to take the father's business
[50:59] and to operate as a son or a daughter of
[51:03] God in this day and in this hour. Amen.
[51:07] Praise God. And so we're just going to
[51:09] look at a few of the quotes that we read
[51:10] last week and we're going to we're going
[51:12] to go from there. But just to lay in the
[51:14] background again, it says here, you can
[51:16] go to the next slide. It says, "Now a
[51:18] little farther now, now the 11th verse,
[51:20] which is what we read, it says, in whom
[51:24] also we have obtained an inheritance."
[51:26] And brother Brandham goes on to say,
[51:28] "And oh, an inheritance. Somebody has to
[51:30] leave you something to inherit it." Is
[51:33] that right? An inheritance. What
[51:35] inheritance do we have? Question. What
[51:38] inheritance did I have? I didn't have
[51:41] any, but God left me an inheritance when
[51:44] he put my name on the lamb's book of
[51:47] life before the foundations of the
[51:50] world. Amen. And we were talking about
[51:52] it last week. And you know, if we're
[51:54] going to have an inheritance and our
[51:56] father's going to leave us an
[51:57] inheritance, your name needs to be on
[51:59] the will.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, there's no inheritance for
[52:02] you. You might have thought you had an
[52:04] inheritance, but until the actual book
[52:06] is read, the will is read, you don't
[52:09] know if your name's actually there.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; And so here he's saying he's saying that
[52:14] that he put our names on the lamb's book
[52:17] of life when when you were born here.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; No.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; When you overcame here,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; when you when you started to attend
[52:23] church and started to show that you're a
[52:26] Christian on the outside, no. before the
[52:29] foundations of the world. He could
[52:32] predestinate by knowing that when the
[52:34] word would come to you in your day,
[52:39] &gt;&gt; you by your own free moral agency. And
[52:42] we're going to be looking at that today
[52:44] on on on aspects of really coming into
[52:47] our position and and position of
[52:49] authority. I don't want listen if I'm a
[52:52] businessman. If I hire somebody and I
[52:55] put him into an office in a position, I
[52:57] make him the vice president of the
[52:59] company or the CEO of the company
[53:01] because I'm the chairman of the board
[53:04] and I decide to put him into that
[53:06] position and I and I I look I'm going to
[53:08] check his character. I'm going to make
[53:10] sure that he knows his position and the
[53:14] authority that he has. Otherwise, he's
[53:16] going to make a mess of my company.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; He's got no character. He's got no real,
[53:20] you know, strength, no no uh no decision
[53:23] power making. Amen. And this is
[53:25] important for the Lord.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't just predestinate. Oh, I'll
[53:30] choose you and I won't choose you and
[53:32] I'll choose you and I won't. That's not
[53:35] that's not God's way.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; No, no. He could by forn knowledge he
[53:39] saw your character being developed.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; He saw you going through the trials. He
[53:45] saw you going through the situations
[53:47] that you needed to go through in order
[53:49] to pro, you know, to produce what what
[53:52] he would require from you in your
[53:55] position as a son
[53:58] &gt;&gt; or daughter. When I say son, I'm meaning
[54:01] daughter. It's all okay. Amen. Praise
[54:03] God. Glory to God. So here now he goes
[54:05] on and he says, "Oh, you say now wait a
[54:08] minute, brother. Jesus did did that when
[54:11] he died for you?" No, he never. Jesus
[54:14] come to purchase
[54:16] &gt;&gt; that inheritance
[54:18] because without him coming to give up
[54:22] his life, give up the ghost, the Holy
[54:26] Ghost, not to, you know, and he come
[54:29] down
[54:31] into into
[54:34] theophony and then give it back so that
[54:36] he could he could go and and and send
[54:40] down the Holy Ghost, which is your
[54:44] theophies.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Which is when you receive the word for
[54:49] your day, you've made contact with your
[54:53] theophony.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what brings you into
[54:57] your position as a son, adopted son.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So read the very next the
[55:05] very next line. in whom we have obtained
[55:08] a parent obtained an inheritance being
[55:11] predestinated according to the purpose
[55:13] of him who workketh all things after the
[55:15] council of his own good. Go to the next
[55:17] slide. Look has predestinated us unto
[55:21] this inheritance. If I'm right,
[55:24] inheritance of something. If God is
[55:26] knocking at my heart and saying,
[55:29] "William Branam, I called you a long
[55:32] time ago before the foundations of the
[55:35] world to preach the gospel."
[55:38] &gt;&gt; What is he saying there? He's saying
[55:40] that he knew exactly what your position
[55:43] would be.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew that you would you would
[55:47] freely take your position as a son or
[55:52] daughter of God. that when the Holy
[55:53] Ghost comes on you, your life now, your
[55:58] purpose changes alto together and it's
[56:01] his purpose now.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Everything that you do, everything that
[56:04] you live, everything that you associate
[56:06] yourself with, your your schooling, your
[56:09] your plans for the future now, you're
[56:11] lining it up through his purpose for
[56:14] your life because it's his will that
[56:17] we're looking for.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, the will is the book
[56:22] that reads out and calls your name. And
[56:25] if your name is in the book according to
[56:27] his will, it's because he put you there
[56:30] knowing that he was going to adopt you.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. I have
[56:37] an inheritance, an inheritance of
[56:39] eternal life. Now, God sent Jesus to
[56:42] make that inheritance real to me because
[56:46] there was nothing I could do to it to
[56:48] inherit it. It was blank. It was valid.
[56:52] There's nothing I could do. But in the
[56:54] fullness of time, God sent in his own
[56:59] good time, Jesus, the lamb, slain from
[57:03] the foundations of the world. His blood
[57:06] was shed that I might go to my
[57:08] inheritance to be what? What
[57:11] inheritance? The sunship.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; To be a son.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Of God.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And we'll read the
[57:22] last one here and then we'll move on
[57:24] from there. And now this may just choke
[57:27] you to death, but did you know that men
[57:31] that are sons of God are amateur gods?
[57:34] Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; We got to we got to come we listen. We
[57:38] need to come to to an understanding of
[57:40] what God is doing in this hour.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; When the rapture takes place and our
[57:45] bodies are changed in a in a moment, in
[57:48] a twinkling of an eye, there's that's
[57:50] going to be a supernatural event that
[57:53] God is going to that that's going to
[57:55] manifest through your life. And there's
[57:58] going to be people that all of a sudden
[58:00] are going to realize, wait a minute, he
[58:04] was always saying that, you know, this
[58:06] was going to happen. She was always
[58:08] saying that this event was going to take
[58:10] place. They must have been sons and
[58:13] daughters of God.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you need to come to a
[58:17] place where you start walking like a
[58:19] son,
[58:20] &gt;&gt; acting like a son,
[58:22] &gt;&gt; having authority like a son or a
[58:24] daughter of God,
[58:25] &gt;&gt; understanding your position in this day
[58:28] and in this hour. Amen. This is the hour
[58:30] that we're living in. This is what God
[58:32] is looking for. He wants to see sons and
[58:35] daughters coming into their positions by
[58:38] free moral agency.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says here now how many
[58:43] knows that Jesus said so that the Bible
[58:46] said did your law say itself that you
[58:49] are gods and if you call them gods which
[58:53] God said in Genesis 2 that they were
[58:55] gods because they were they had full
[58:58] domain over the dominion of the world.
[59:02] He gave them dominion over all things
[59:06] &gt;&gt; and he lost his godship. He lost his
[59:09] sunship. He lost his domain. And Satan
[59:12] took it over because of the original
[59:14] sin.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; But now watch. But and and and Satan
[59:20] took it over. But brother, we are
[59:22] waiting for the manifestation of the
[59:25] sons of God.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Who will come back and take
[59:29] it over again.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We're going to have that
[59:34] inheritance in our hand. Praise God. He
[59:37] said, "Take the book." Oh, glory. Don't
[59:39] get too far ahead. waiting for the
[59:41] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[59:44] up to the top. When the full sons of God
[59:47] will be manifested, when the power of
[59:50] God will walk out, hallelujah, and will
[59:52] take every power that Satan's got away
[59:55] from him. Amen. Yes, sir. It belongs to
[59:58] him. It belongs to to him, the the Lord
[1:00:02] Jesus. And and him being displayed in
[1:00:05] you now belongs to you.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; You're his wife.
[1:00:10] You're the one that he's called. Amen.
[1:00:12] Let's let's move on. Now, we're going to
[1:00:14] move on from here. Amen. That was just a
[1:00:17] recap of last week so that we can, you
[1:00:19] know, can can move into heavenly places
[1:00:21] and and see what the Lord has for us
[1:00:23] today. Amen. Let's go to the next
[1:00:25] scripture.
[1:00:27] In 1 Peter 1:3-5,
[1:00:30] it says here, "Blessed be the God and
[1:00:32] father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
[1:00:35] according to his abundant mercy hath
[1:00:38] begotten us again."
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Again,
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; has begotten. Where were you when the
[1:00:44] sons of God rejoiced?
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise Praise God. Where
[1:00:49] were you? Amen. He's begotten us again.
[1:00:52] Amen. Glory. unto a lively hope by the
[1:00:56] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[1:00:59] dead. Now watch, pay attention. We're
[1:01:03] talking about obtaining our inheritance.
[1:01:06] To an inheritance incorruptible and
[1:01:08] undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
[1:01:12] reserved in heaven for you.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. I don't know about you, but
[1:01:17] that that that that's telling me that
[1:01:19] there's something there there's there's
[1:01:21] a supernatural incorruptible something
[1:01:24] that's waiting for me.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; That's that's already present. Amen.
[1:01:28] That's already making itself known.
[1:01:30] That's making itself real and becoming a
[1:01:34] reality to me. This listen, when the
[1:01:36] prophet went beyond the curtain of time
[1:01:38] and he saw those theophies there, he was
[1:01:41] he was looking at all the sons and
[1:01:42] daughters of God from all the all the
[1:01:44] past ages. Amen. He was seeing
[1:01:47] everything. And you know there's there's
[1:01:49] something incorruptible that's waiting
[1:01:51] for you.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've already entered into the
[1:01:55] word for this day and this hour, you're
[1:01:56] already experiencing it. You you you
[1:01:59] you're experiencing the revelation that
[1:02:01] comes with it. Amen. Praise God. And he
[1:02:04] goes here and he says to an inheritance
[1:02:06] incorruptible, undefiled. It fades not
[1:02:08] away. He says reserved in heaven for
[1:02:12] you. Amen. who are kept by the power of
[1:02:16] God through faith unto salvation, ready
[1:02:19] to be revealed when
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Is this the end time?
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't this the Isn't this the last time?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't Isn't this when something is is is
[1:02:31] going to manifest before us and and
[1:02:34] bring us into a time and a season?
[1:02:36] Listen, this word is progressing,
[1:02:38] saints. We're not we're not just going
[1:02:39] to church Sunday and Wednesday to just
[1:02:41] come here and and oh that sounds good.
[1:02:43] Oh, I heard that before. Oh, he he said
[1:02:46] that one before. I've heard that quote
[1:02:47] before. I've read that scripture before.
[1:02:50] Listen, the scripture needs to come to
[1:02:52] life in your day.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; You need to recognize what he's going to
[1:02:55] do for you right now. Amen. Praise God.
[1:02:58] It's going to place that inheritance in
[1:03:00] your hand so that you can deal with the
[1:03:02] situations that you're dealing with out
[1:03:04] in life. Amen. So you can overcome those
[1:03:07] situations that are the enemy tries to
[1:03:09] knock you down, tries to place you in a
[1:03:11] day gone by,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; tries to put you under a under a
[1:03:16] previous age. Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; No sir. This age is the bride age. This
[1:03:20] is where the bride comes into her
[1:03:22] position. She recognizes the word
[1:03:25] recognizes what the word is to produce
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; in this day and in this hour. Amen. And
[1:03:31] so we know we have in obtained our
[1:03:33] inheritance when we have progressed unto
[1:03:35] adoption where adoption now is is is is
[1:03:39] a reality. You can see that God was
[1:03:42] dealing with your life. God was molding
[1:03:45] and shaping and and even now there's
[1:03:48] things in your life around you right now
[1:03:51] that God wants you to get away from,
[1:03:55] break away from, overcome
[1:03:58] because this is adoption time.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; This is this is where the tutors take
[1:04:03] their hands off. Amen. And say, "Here he
[1:04:05] is. Let's look at what look look what
[1:04:08] he's he's become. Look how he's
[1:04:10] overcome. Look how he's dealt with these
[1:04:13] situations.
[1:04:14] Hallelujah.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; We're no longer under the tutors
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost constantly having to
[1:04:21] correct us. Yes, we come to the church.
[1:04:24] Yes, we come under the five-fold
[1:04:26] ministry. Yes, it's the Holy Spirit
[1:04:28] that's speaking to us. But we have come
[1:04:30] to a place where now we recognize that
[1:04:32] he's in us.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; He wants us to act our age.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; listen to what I said. He wants you to
[1:04:40] act your age.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Not your immature age, but the age of
[1:04:45] the word for this day and this hour and
[1:04:48] what it's to produce. Sons of God,
[1:04:50] adopted sons. Not just adopted sons, but
[1:04:53] authority.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Having authority in their positions,
[1:04:57] knowing what God is required. Amen.
[1:04:59] Glory to God. Yes, we need the anointing
[1:05:02] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yes,
[1:05:05] those things are good because those are
[1:05:07] what gives us the ability to overcome
[1:05:10] and to do the things that we need to do
[1:05:12] from time to time. Amen. Listen, if we
[1:05:14] don't have the ability of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:16] when we pray for somebody, they're not
[1:05:19] going to get healed.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; But when the Holy Ghost comes and honors
[1:05:23] the word and you speak that word under
[1:05:25] the anointing, God is obligated to his
[1:05:29] word. If there's faith there, he meets
[1:05:31] that faith.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we're not talking about
[1:05:35] just baptism. Oh, I'm going to go to
[1:05:37] another church meeting because that
[1:05:38] brother can preach.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; He can he can bring down the house and
[1:05:42] the people start running around and
[1:05:45] people start speaking in tongues and and
[1:05:47] and oh, there's such a such a baptism
[1:05:49] and the people leave the meeting and
[1:05:51] then you go to talk to the brother and
[1:05:52] the or the sister and you get into
[1:05:54] fellowship with them and say, "Brother,
[1:05:56] what did you get from there?" I don't
[1:05:57] know, but it felt good. That's not the
[1:06:00] hour we're living in. Amen. This is the
[1:06:03] hour where the word lays in a
[1:06:06] foundation. Brother, I I just heard that
[1:06:09] I've got some authority over over that
[1:06:12] sickness that that that I came into the
[1:06:14] house of the Lord with.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I've got something, you
[1:06:18] know, that that that's given me the
[1:06:19] ability to overcome this financial
[1:06:22] burden because I just come to realize
[1:06:24] that Jehovah Gyra,
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; he's still alive.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; He's still willing. He's still He's
[1:06:30] right there just waiting for me as an
[1:06:33] adopted son to step into my authority
[1:06:35] and sign the check.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Because when I sign that check, it's
[1:06:41] just like my father.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; He's backing that check.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; He's good for the money.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Make the investment, my son.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Make that investment, my daughter. I'm
[1:06:53] going to back it up.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you are you you've
[1:06:57] become a channel for me. You become a
[1:07:00] river of life.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; You come to a place where you realize
[1:07:08] manifested sons of God in the last time.
[1:07:12] This is the time. This is what Peter was
[1:07:15] talking about. There's got to come a
[1:07:17] time where this is going to become
[1:07:18] reality. Saints,
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Are you going to step into it? Are you
[1:07:22] going to allow yourself to stay under
[1:07:24] under oh well you know they just telling
[1:07:27] me I got to press play and obey. That's
[1:07:29] it. Just press play and obey.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:07:34] what about you? Where are you?
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; What? Well, what's your your position in
[1:07:39] this? Press play and obey. Obey what?
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; What are you going to obey?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; You going to put on the my eagle belt?
[1:07:47] You see that?
[1:07:48] What are you going to do? Put on your
[1:07:49] ego belt. You going to get excited? Oh,
[1:07:53] no. I'm going hunting like the I'm going
[1:07:55] hunting like the like like like the like
[1:07:56] the prophet used to go hunting. And boy,
[1:07:59] we'd we'd get together and then we'd sit
[1:08:01] around the fire and then the Holy Ghost
[1:08:03] would come.
[1:08:05] No, no, no. He's at work with you.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; He leaves when you leave this place. He
[1:08:13] leaves with you.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; He's interested in all aspects of your
[1:08:17] life.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's looking at building
[1:08:20] your character. He doesn't want to see a
[1:08:22] different life when you live when you
[1:08:24] leave here.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; You might fool me. You might fool,
[1:08:27] brother Simon. You might fool the
[1:08:29] deacons, but you're not going to fool
[1:08:31] God.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; No, sir. God wants character.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; He wants to place authority into the
[1:08:38] hands of character.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Now, here, let's
[1:08:42] go on. Let's move on. Next slide. 1
[1:08:44] Peter chapter 1 verse 6-7. Because this
[1:08:48] is where we're going to headed. You
[1:08:49] know, we're going to head into this
[1:08:50] direction today. Because, you know,
[1:08:52] being a son or a daughter of God,
[1:08:54] there's testing.
[1:08:56] It comes with it. God has a purpose
[1:08:59] through it all. He says here, "Wherein
[1:09:00] ye greatly rejoice." You know, we just
[1:09:03] finished reading, you know, where where
[1:09:04] it says, "And and this this salvation,
[1:09:07] I'm just going to backtrack. This
[1:09:09] salvation which is ready to be revealed
[1:09:11] in the last time." So, he's talking
[1:09:13] about your your your your
[1:09:15] position as a son. you're going to be
[1:09:17] revealed in the last time. And then he
[1:09:19] goes on and he says, "Wherein you
[1:09:21] greatly rejoice." I mean, we're we're
[1:09:24] rejoicing in the word this morning. It's
[1:09:26] wonderful. I'm a son of God. Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] I'm in my authority. Glory to God. He
[1:09:30] says, "But though now for a season
[1:09:34] because you know what? You're going to
[1:09:34] have your ups and downs today, this
[1:09:37] morning. You come in here. Oh, praise
[1:09:38] God. This word, hallelujah, just getting
[1:09:41] so blessed." And then you go to work
[1:09:42] tomorrow morning. The first thing the b
[1:09:44] the boss says is, "Get in here.
[1:09:49] Somebody told me this, this, this, this.
[1:09:51] What do you do? Bang, bang, bang. You
[1:09:53] got three days laid off. You see, you're
[1:09:56] going to face situations.
[1:09:59] But he says, "If need be, ye are in
[1:10:01] heaviness through manifold temptations.
[1:10:05] You're going to be tested, saints, that
[1:10:07] the trial of your faith, being much more
[1:10:10] precious than gold, that perisheth,
[1:10:13] though it be tried with fire, might be
[1:10:16] found unto praise and honor and glory at
[1:10:20] the appearing of Jesus Christ. that when
[1:10:24] that translation takes place, nothing is
[1:10:26] going to compare, saints, and nothing is
[1:10:28] compared to what we are receiving in
[1:10:32] this hour by the word of God being
[1:10:35] revealed. Amen. Glory to God. But yet,
[1:10:38] there's molding, there's shaping, there
[1:10:42] are things that that the Lord has to do
[1:10:44] in our lives. You know, let's bring
[1:10:46] this. Let's let's let's let's you know,
[1:10:48] it's so wonderful to hear you're this.
[1:10:51] You're a son. You're overcomer. you're
[1:10:53] all those things. It's another thing now
[1:10:55] to put the pedal to the metal and get on
[1:10:59] the road and go and deal and overcome
[1:11:03] the situations. Amen. Praise God. And so
[1:11:06] here for the next week or maybe two, I
[1:11:08] don't know. We're going to see how long
[1:11:10] we're going to take to get through this.
[1:11:12] But we want to we want to look to see
[1:11:14] what God requires in order for a son to
[1:11:18] enter into his adoption as a full son of
[1:11:22] God. Amen. To where that theophony and
[1:11:25] and and and the word in you becomes one.
[1:11:29] Amen. Praise God. Whether you really
[1:11:32] believe. Glory. So let's let's move on
[1:11:35] from here. How many's ready to go?
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to take a little
[1:11:38] trip back through the Old Testament.
[1:11:41] Glory. And we're going to see where the
[1:11:42] Lord reveals. And you know, if there's
[1:11:44] things there that say, "Oh me, oh my,
[1:11:47] that's me. That's me. That's oh Lord,
[1:11:49] help me here. Help me there." Let it be
[1:11:51] so. Amen. Because you are ordained to be
[1:11:54] a son.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; It'll never you you can't there. There's
[1:11:58] no way you can't be
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; unless you just aren't.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Let's go to our scripture. I'm going to
[1:12:07] take a quick drink.
[1:12:09] In Joshua,
[1:12:14] how many knows that Joshua is a perfect
[1:12:17] type of Ephesians?
[1:12:20] Now after the death of Moses the servant
[1:12:24] of the Lord, it came to pass that the
[1:12:27] Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun.
[1:12:30] Moses
[1:12:32] minister
[1:12:34] saying Moses my servant is dead. Now now
[1:12:38] bring this right to the present stage
[1:12:40] that we're in. Saints, we're looking at
[1:12:42] the Old Testament, but I want you to
[1:12:44] place this now.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I say when when the
[1:12:48] scripture says Moses my servant is dead,
[1:12:50] brother Brandham our prophet is dead.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; He has translated to his next placing
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; in his theophony having fellowship with
[1:13:00] the saints. Amen. Praise God. But you
[1:13:02] and I, we're still here.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now watch. Now pay attention
[1:13:07] to everything because we're just going
[1:13:08] to let the Holy Spirit show us here. He
[1:13:10] says, "Now he's dead. Now therefore
[1:13:13] arise,
[1:13:15] go over this Jordan. Now the Jordan that
[1:13:18] we're that we're in the midst of of of
[1:13:20] going over, okay, for a lot of people, a
[1:13:23] lot of people have already gone over.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But some people still got to
[1:13:27] come.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And it takes the
[1:13:31] Holy Ghost to take you over that Jordan.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been talking about the
[1:13:36] purpose of God and the purpose of the
[1:13:37] Holy Ghost and what it all does and how
[1:13:39] it brings his purpose into your life.
[1:13:42] And his purpose is to take you in and
[1:13:45] over. Amen. He's called you out and now
[1:13:49] he's going to take you over. Some have
[1:13:52] already crossed over. They're already
[1:13:53] feasting in the promised land on the
[1:13:56] word of God. I trust there's most of you
[1:13:58] here are are already feasting in the
[1:14:00] promised land. Amen. Praise God. But
[1:14:03] here he says, "My servant is dead. Now
[1:14:05] therefore rise, go over Jordan, thou and
[1:14:07] all the people unto the land which I do
[1:14:10] give to them, even to the children of
[1:14:12] Israel." And when we when when he talks
[1:14:15] about the children of Israel, you know,
[1:14:17] God's talking about his chosen people.
[1:14:19] He's talking about, you know, um uh the
[1:14:22] bride, right? The the the the sons and
[1:14:25] daughters. Everything was a type.
[1:14:27] Whenever he was talking about Israel in
[1:14:28] the Old Testament, he's typing the the
[1:14:30] the the the church, the the bride in the
[1:14:34] New Testament. Amen. And so you know
[1:14:36] here he's saying now every place that
[1:14:38] the soul of your foot shall tread upon
[1:14:41] that have I given unto you as I said
[1:14:45] unto Moses from the wilderness of this
[1:14:47] Lebanon even unto the great river the
[1:14:50] great river Euphrates all the land of
[1:14:52] the Hittites and unto the great sea
[1:14:54] towards the going down of the sun shall
[1:14:57] be your coast. Amen. In other words you
[1:15:00] are a separated people. Yes,
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; you have been given total possession of
[1:15:06] the land that that that lays before you.
[1:15:09] Amen. As a son or a daughter of God, God
[1:15:12] has given us a full inheritance.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are going to inherit the meek
[1:15:17] shall inherit what?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; The earth.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a a a a ruling of
[1:15:25] 1,000 years. And God needs ambassadors,
[1:15:29] sons and daughters that will rule and
[1:15:31] reign with him for a thousand years. And
[1:15:34] so he goes on, he says, he says, "There
[1:15:36] shall not any man be able to stand
[1:15:39] before thee all the days of thy life as
[1:15:42] I was with Moses, as I was with William
[1:15:45] Brandham."
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; So I will be with thee.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So So you see it? He was with
[1:15:56] William Brandham. Now he's going to be
[1:15:58] with you.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Like like try to keep it simple. Amen. I
[1:16:04] will not fail you.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Nor forsake you. He just says, "Be
[1:16:12] strong and courageous of good courage,
[1:16:15] for unto this people shalt thou divide
[1:16:18] for an inheritance the land which I
[1:16:21] swear unto their fathers to give them."
[1:16:24] Amen. So God is reading that book of
[1:16:27] inheritance. He's saying that we've
[1:16:29] obtained the inheritance. He says the
[1:16:32] inheritance is for you to possess your
[1:16:35] land, the portion that God has given
[1:16:38] you. Listen, God didn't call you to
[1:16:41] become a part of this church or this
[1:16:44] ministry under the message of this hour
[1:16:47] to just be a nobody. You are somebody.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're a daughter or a son of God.
[1:16:54] You're you're you're you're so special
[1:16:56] in the eyes of God. You've you he wants
[1:16:59] to place you into your position of
[1:17:01] authority. He wants to give you
[1:17:04] authority in your life as a housewife,
[1:17:07] as a as a preacher, as a deacon, as a
[1:17:10] trustee, as a as a a a cleaner in the
[1:17:13] house of the Lord. It you could be a
[1:17:15] cook for the for the events. You could
[1:17:17] all of these things if it's under the
[1:17:20] anointing of you coming into your
[1:17:23] understanding that you are now serving
[1:17:25] the living God.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; As you serve your brothers and your
[1:17:29] sisters, as you do your part in the
[1:17:32] house of the Lord, you're doing it unto
[1:17:33] him.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; You're doing it unto the Lord. Amen.
[1:17:37] Praise God. That's something that's
[1:17:39] that's that's greater than what you
[1:17:40] think. Amen. We're going to be looking
[1:17:42] at some of this. Go to the next slide.
[1:17:46] But he says here, you got to only be
[1:17:48] strong and very courageous. It's not
[1:17:51] easy to stand on this message and this
[1:17:55] word.
[1:17:57] It's not. Don't let anybody tell you,
[1:18:00] "Oh, it's easy. Just come to church."
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Like I said, you could live a life here
[1:18:06] and then be a totally different person
[1:18:08] out there. God wants you to be a son or
[1:18:10] a daughter.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:18:15] And the rapture is in progress.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; And if it's in progress in your life,
[1:18:21] it's going to be displayed.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; You're going to you're going to have the
[1:18:24] purpose of God all around you.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to have the purpose of God
[1:18:28] when you fellowship. Your purpose is to
[1:18:31] fellowship on the word, but not in a
[1:18:35] religious way. We're not religious.
[1:18:37] People say, "Oh, brother, man, you're
[1:18:38] you're so religious." We are not
[1:18:41] religious. Amen.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Religion is what's caused all the
[1:18:45] problems in the world because people
[1:18:47] take the word of God and they want to
[1:18:50] put their own interpretation on the
[1:18:52] word.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to put our own
[1:18:55] interpretation on the word. I'm reading
[1:18:58] quotes from a prophet. But that listen,
[1:19:01] that prophet, he only did one thing. He
[1:19:05] pointed us back to the word.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; That's all he was doing. He was pointing
[1:19:10] us back to the word. But because the
[1:19:12] church world out there and the church
[1:19:14] Christian world out there, they couldn't
[1:19:17] receive the pure word. That's why you go
[1:19:19] to somebody as simple as you believe in
[1:19:22] a trinity, three gods in one. There's
[1:19:26] nowhere in the Bible that there's three,
[1:19:27] they will you'll watch the hair come up
[1:19:29] on the back of their head.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; They get upset.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's exposing their own
[1:19:36] doctrine. Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Which are the doctrines of the
[1:19:39] nicicoleans that were injected into the
[1:19:42] word of God. And that's why the word of
[1:19:44] God has become of none effect to the
[1:19:45] people. They can go to church. They can
[1:19:47] live any way they want. They swear. They
[1:19:50] they they they they
[1:19:52] commit adultery and this and then they
[1:19:54] go to church on Sunday and they say in
[1:19:56] the name of the father and of the son
[1:20:01] and have no idea who the father is, who
[1:20:03] the son is,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; who anybody is. They're just living a a
[1:20:09] a hypocritical life. That's not an
[1:20:13] adopted son. I'm sorry. We're we're
[1:20:16] we're way down the road. God's looking
[1:20:18] for adoption of sons and daughters that
[1:20:21] have come into their position of an
[1:20:22] understanding on the word.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; The word. Amen. He says, "Now watch." He
[1:20:28] says, "Be not afraid, neither be thou
[1:20:30] dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with
[1:20:32] thee wherethersoever thou goest." No
[1:20:34] matter what situation you might find
[1:20:36] yourself in, you might make mistakes.
[1:20:39] Don't worry about it. You might, you
[1:20:42] know, it takes time to to to really, you
[1:20:44] know, come into uh the the right
[1:20:46] character. God is molding and shaping
[1:20:49] you. You've you've had you've had
[1:20:50] certain character on your life for so
[1:20:52] many years.
[1:20:54] It doesn't happen overnight. It's a
[1:20:56] process.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; But he's with you.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; I'll overcome with you. Oh, glory. He
[1:21:06] says, "Now then Joshua commanded the
[1:21:08] officers of the people, saying, pass
[1:21:10] through the host and command the people,
[1:21:13] saying, prepare you victuals, for within
[1:21:16] 3 days you shall," now pay attention,
[1:21:18] "you shall possess, you shall pass over
[1:21:22] this Jordan to go in to possess the land
[1:21:26] which the Lord your God giveth you to
[1:21:28] possess it."
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Did he say that you're going to go over
[1:21:32] and you might possess it?
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; No. that that that I that the Lord your
[1:21:36] God might give to you.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. He says you're going to
[1:21:40] possess it.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Because I give it to you.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; He says you just got to receive it.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; You just got to step out and say, "I'm
[1:21:50] I'm ready. I'm putting my sword on."
[1:21:52] Joshua says, "Get yourself ready because
[1:21:54] to possess this land, you're going to
[1:21:56] have to fight for it.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to overcome a lot
[1:21:59] of situations." Amen. Glory to God. Go
[1:22:02] on to the next slide. Ephesians here in
[1:22:04] in adoption one he says our Ephesians
[1:22:07] our Joshua which is the Holy Spirit.
[1:22:10] Joshua means Jesus our savior.
[1:22:14] Joshua means the Holy Spirit
[1:22:17] representing
[1:22:19] it in the spiritual as that was in the
[1:22:23] natural. Amen. So, like in the natural
[1:22:26] where Joshua would give them their their
[1:22:29] their uh their tools of war and tell
[1:22:33] them to prepare themselves, get
[1:22:35] themselves dressed and put on the armor
[1:22:37] in the spiritual. God is saying, "Put on
[1:22:39] the word.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Take on the word of God." That's the
[1:22:42] spiritual aspect of the word of God.
[1:22:44] That's the That's what Joshua has given
[1:22:46] us in this day. He's not saying put on
[1:22:49] the tapes.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; No, no. He's saying, "Put on the sword."
[1:22:53] Hallelujah. Glory to God. He's saying,
[1:22:55] "Take the word of God and dress yourself
[1:22:58] with faith."
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Faith only comes by hearing the word and
[1:23:02] by you and and God having a a a divine
[1:23:06] uh relationship of what his desire and
[1:23:09] his will and his purpose is in your life
[1:23:11] and through your life. He says they were
[1:23:14] they were everyone Hebrews when they
[1:23:16] crossed the river. But Joshua divided
[1:23:19] the land and give each one of his of his
[1:23:22] land according to the utterance of his
[1:23:25] mother at the birth where the Holy
[1:23:28] Spirit told her. Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:23:32] I believe that God has some mothers in
[1:23:34] this day and in this hour which are
[1:23:36] churches. Glory to God. That's come
[1:23:38] under the anointing and the inspiration
[1:23:40] of the Holy Ghost. the five-fold
[1:23:42] ministry that knows what under the
[1:23:45] utterance of the word that as the word
[1:23:46] goes forth through that ministry, it
[1:23:50] starts to positionally place sons and
[1:23:52] daughters of God because they they're
[1:23:55] under inspiration. The five-fold
[1:23:57] ministry is under an inspiration of of
[1:23:59] the mighty angel himself. He come down
[1:24:02] in 1963 to place authority in us so that
[1:24:07] we could call and speak and and and
[1:24:10] speak the resurrection of the sons and
[1:24:13] the daughters of God and call them out
[1:24:15] of their amnesia.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; And as the word comes forth, you come
[1:24:22] into church, brother, what what's my
[1:24:25] position? Where do I fit in? Just sit
[1:24:28] under the word long enough. The Holy
[1:24:30] Spirit is going to make it clear to you
[1:24:32] exactly what your position is in the
[1:24:34] house of the Lord. Amen. In the body of
[1:24:36] Christ. You don't have to worry. You
[1:24:38] don't have to try to put on a position.
[1:24:41] You don't have to try to be a minister.
[1:24:43] You don't have to. It will manifest
[1:24:45] itself when you die out to yourself.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Because that's the first thing that
[1:24:51] needs to happen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Now, go to the next
[1:24:55] slide and just stay there for a bit. I'm
[1:24:56] just going to talk for just a few
[1:24:58] moments. Now, now that you are in the
[1:25:01] land, God is saying, "Work the land."
[1:25:04] He says, "Okay, I've given you the land.
[1:25:06] We're going to go in. We're going to
[1:25:07] possess the land." Now, you're in the
[1:25:09] land. Now, you got to work your land.
[1:25:11] Now, you as a father over the home have
[1:25:14] to take your position. You as a mother
[1:25:16] over the home have to take your
[1:25:18] position.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; You, the father's got to plant seed. So,
[1:25:22] if he's going to plant seed, what kind
[1:25:23] of seed does he want to plant in his
[1:25:25] children? He's going to plant the word
[1:25:27] of God. He's going to plant the the the
[1:25:29] you know what what's good, the things
[1:25:31] that are good, the things that are true,
[1:25:33] the things that are right. So, as a
[1:25:35] father, we want to lead and guide our
[1:25:37] homes and our families by the word of
[1:25:40] God. We want to plant the right seed.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; But, you know, there's going to be an
[1:25:44] enemy that's going to try to pluck up
[1:25:45] that seed. Soon as our kids get out into
[1:25:48] the world and they start going to
[1:25:49] school, all of a sudden, there's an
[1:25:51] interference that kicks in. You young
[1:25:53] people, you know what I'm talking about.
[1:25:55] But don't worry because if you're an
[1:25:57] adopted son or daughter of God, you've
[1:25:59] been given an authority. Oh, glory to
[1:26:01] God. You're not going to stay like that
[1:26:04] very long. You're going to become aware
[1:26:06] because that attribute that God placed
[1:26:08] in you from before the foundations of
[1:26:10] the world, that's going to come to
[1:26:12] surface at some point. As the word comes
[1:26:14] down, as the word gets spoken and it
[1:26:16] gets revealed, you wake up out of your
[1:26:19] amnesia. Even as a young person, I don't
[1:26:22] I'm not discounting anybody.
[1:26:25] This word of God, it can come to any son
[1:26:28] or daughter attribute of God. Whether
[1:26:31] they're in a 5-year-old body or they've
[1:26:33] been in this message for 30 years and
[1:26:35] they're still not awake. Maybe this is
[1:26:37] their time.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; How do you know?
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; You see, because when God calls you, he
[1:26:43] calls you to a position. He places you.
[1:26:46] He's not going to place you here, there,
[1:26:49] over there. Well, one week you're over
[1:26:50] here, next week you're over there. God's
[1:26:52] going to place you into the body. You're
[1:26:54] going to know exactly who you are.
[1:26:56] You're going to know who your shepherd
[1:26:58] is. Amen. You're going to recognize the
[1:27:00] word that's coming forth because it's
[1:27:02] it's it's thundering in your heart. How
[1:27:04] do you know that the word I I'm I'm
[1:27:06] under the right ministry. Listen, I knew
[1:27:08] what right from the very beginning. It
[1:27:10] didn't matter that he was 5'8. Okay? It
[1:27:14] didn't matter. But the word was
[1:27:17] thundering through the man.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter. The word was coming
[1:27:21] and feeding my soul. It was bringing me
[1:27:24] into an a placing in the body. I I
[1:27:27] couldn't I couldn't help it. I could
[1:27:28] just see the word clearly.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I was listening to the
[1:27:33] prophet, but everything I was hearing
[1:27:35] the prophet say, it was coming to
[1:27:37] reality in my own life.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; That's how you know you can listen to
[1:27:42] the tapes. I got nothing against
[1:27:43] listening to I listen to them every
[1:27:45] single day.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Every day.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Every single day.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and I love it. I feed on it
[1:27:55] because I hear things and I realize, oh,
[1:27:58] there you are, Lord.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; That's exactly the way you you you
[1:28:02] revealed it to me on Sunday through the
[1:28:03] pastor.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; That was you speaking to me. That was
[1:28:06] you confirming your word. That was you
[1:28:08] making it more of a reality. And and
[1:28:10] plus, now I can see in my own life how I
[1:28:13] got to apply it
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; and not just a parrot that can just
[1:28:17] quote the tapes. Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; It's going to have an effect on my life
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; because now you by the power of your
[1:28:25] spirit under the anointing
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; are speaking to me. And now I know it's
[1:28:30] just not my pastor speaking anymore.
[1:28:32] I've got the fear of God on me because
[1:28:34] God is aware of my situation.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; God's watching me. God wants to perfect
[1:28:39] me. God wants to shape me. How you going
[1:28:42] to get that if you're not under the
[1:28:44] understanding of who you are,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; where you're supposed to be? Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When you make a mess and
[1:28:54] you need you need you need to own up to
[1:28:57] your mess.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; You need to realize, okay, you know
[1:29:00] what? I need to change certain things. I
[1:29:03] need to change my ways because I go to
[1:29:06] try to possess this land and the enemy
[1:29:08] is sitting right there and he says,
[1:29:11] "I have a right to be here because of
[1:29:13] this, this, and that." You say, "What?"
[1:29:17] this, this, and that. You heard the
[1:29:19] pastor, you heard the preacher, you even
[1:29:21] heard brother Brandham talking to you on
[1:29:23] the tape, and then I had to come and
[1:29:25] confirm it here, there, and everywhere
[1:29:27] else. You will know. Listen, saints,
[1:29:29] this is not some some, uh, you know,
[1:29:32] like, oh, uh, I just go to this church
[1:29:35] and, you know, he said so, I believe it,
[1:29:38] that's good enough. No, this is where
[1:29:40] you need to believe it. By your own
[1:29:42] experience, by your own revelation and
[1:29:45] experience and relationship with God,
[1:29:48] not you through somebody else.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Not because you identify with
[1:29:54] this person that you've got this
[1:29:56] person's revelation. No. A lot of
[1:29:59] people, they want to immediately go and
[1:30:00] they want to sit with the pastor. They
[1:30:02] want to talk to the pastor. They want to
[1:30:04] be at the head of the table with the
[1:30:05] pastor. They want to know exactly. They
[1:30:07] want to share and tell their testimony
[1:30:09] and everything that God's doing in their
[1:30:11] life and everything else. And because
[1:30:13] they're there and the pastor is sitting
[1:30:14] there and he's saying, "Uh-huh. Uhhuh.
[1:30:16] Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's not
[1:30:18] going to cut it.
[1:30:28] gives you an inheritance,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; but with that inheritance comes
[1:30:32] responsibility.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God, he's telling you, you got to
[1:30:38] be responsible.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; For your placing,
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; your calling. This is the hour where you
[1:30:45] This is not just, oh, I belong to that
[1:30:47] church and that's good enough. No, you
[1:30:50] have a responsibility to fulfill the
[1:30:53] purpose of God
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; that he placed in you. Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. God bless you,
[1:31:00] Sister Sheila.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; I just saw you now.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. I believe
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; we can rejoice. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:31:10] Amen.
[1:31:12] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Listen, let's
[1:31:14] go to the next slide here. Listen to
[1:31:16] this. He says, "Thou son of David, have
[1:31:18] mercy on me." 1961. He says, "God told
[1:31:21] them way down in Egypt before, I give
[1:31:25] you that land, but he didn't say, I'll
[1:31:27] I'll go out there and sweep it all out
[1:31:29] and garnish the houses and hang up the
[1:31:32] curtains and everything. You all just
[1:31:34] move in." No. No. They had to fight for
[1:31:38] every inch of ground that they took.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going to have to
[1:31:42] overcome. You're still going to I've
[1:31:44] been in the message for 30 years. I've
[1:31:45] been in the message for 10 me 10 years.
[1:31:48] I've been in the message for a week. I
[1:31:50] see people that have been in the message
[1:31:51] for a year overcoming more than people
[1:31:54] that have been in for 25 years
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; because they've they've broken out of
[1:32:00] that complacency. They've they've come
[1:32:02] into the reality of God that God is a
[1:32:05] reality and their life completely.
[1:32:07] They're they're ready to to take on the
[1:32:09] enemy. They're ready to, you know, and
[1:32:11] God he, you know, he goes with them. You
[1:32:15] think just because they're young
[1:32:16] believers? Listen, I remember when I
[1:32:19] came to the Lord, I was I was a I I was
[1:32:22] a I was a wild man on fire. I'm
[1:32:25] surprised that I didn't get knocked out
[1:32:26] six, seven times from people because I
[1:32:29] was rude. I would just tell them, man,
[1:32:32] you you got to believe this or you're
[1:32:34] going there. like, you know, so zealous
[1:32:36] and so on fire for God, not realizing
[1:32:40] that God was, you know, looking for
[1:32:42] character and and and uh but you know,
[1:32:44] that that comes with time, right? Amen.
[1:32:47] But but because I was so on fire,
[1:32:50] because God knew that that I was one of
[1:32:52] his, you know, he says, "Oh, it's okay.
[1:32:54] It's okay. Let him let him have his
[1:32:56] time. Don't worry." And and then and you
[1:32:58] know, I get so excited. I remember one
[1:32:59] day I'm driving down the road. I'm
[1:33:01] listening to brother Brandham. driving
[1:33:03] going to the high going down to the food
[1:33:05] terminal. It's like 4:00 4:30 in the
[1:33:07] morning. I'm just rejoicing on the word
[1:33:09] of God and just praising God all
[1:33:12] excited. I'm in the left lane in in a in
[1:33:14] a van and I'm drive driving down the
[1:33:16] highway and I'm just rejoicing. All of a
[1:33:18] sudden, my phone rang and I look down at
[1:33:21] my phone and back then you could use
[1:33:22] your phone when you know because this is
[1:33:24] back in '94 95. I go to grab my phone. I
[1:33:26] look at it and it was blank. And I look
[1:33:28] up and it was a tractor trailer parked
[1:33:30] in the left lane, stalled in the left
[1:33:33] lane. And all I says, "Oh, God." And I
[1:33:35] went like this. And I'm telling you, my
[1:33:38] van came off the ground and moved into
[1:33:41] the other lane. Don't ask me how it
[1:33:42] happened. All I know is that God
[1:33:45] intervened that morning.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Or I would have been plastered on the
[1:33:50] back of that tractor trailer.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; What was that? I'll be with you.
[1:33:55] Hallelujah.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you. Even though you get a
[1:33:58] little overzealous, you might get a
[1:33:59] little over excited. You might do this.
[1:34:01] You might do that. You might make I'm
[1:34:03] with you.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; He'll prove it to you. He'll you you
[1:34:07] will know that he is God. Amen. Glory to
[1:34:09] God. He says, "But I'm not going to
[1:34:11] sweep everything out." He says, "And I'm
[1:34:13] going to hang up all the curtains and
[1:34:14] everything. You're all just and you all
[1:34:17] just move in." No. No. They had to fight
[1:34:18] for every inch that they took. That's
[1:34:20] right. Fighting. Take it by every fight.
[1:34:24] every inch. But he said everywhere the
[1:34:28] souls of your foot land, that's
[1:34:30] possession.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; So don't worry, you can step on the
[1:34:36] enemy's ground.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; The moment you step on the enemy's
[1:34:41] ground,
[1:34:43] you possess it.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; He says you're going to possess the
[1:34:46] gates of the enemy, brother.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. He says
[1:34:51] it's possession. You can step, go, move.
[1:34:54] Just move and and take take the land
[1:34:56] wherever you see that you got to move
[1:34:59] and you've got to go. Just don't worry.
[1:35:00] I'm going to be there with you. I'll be
[1:35:02] there. I'm over I'm going to overshadow
[1:35:04] that situation. You're not going to have
[1:35:06] to. You're going to overcome and do
[1:35:08] things that you never thought were
[1:35:09] possible. He says everywhere. He says
[1:35:12] that's the same thing it is today.
[1:35:14] Divine healing belongs to us.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] As an adopted son of God, you are you
[1:35:21] possess divine healing in you already.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; It's yours. Amen. Glory to God. The Holy
[1:35:29] Spirit belongs to us. It's our property.
[1:35:32] But you'll fight every inch of it. Yes,
[1:35:35] sir. But brother, footsteps is
[1:35:37] possession. Just keep on fighting. Take
[1:35:39] it. The devil say the days of miracles
[1:35:42] is passed. No, no, no, no. The days of
[1:35:44] miracles is not passed. He's still doing
[1:35:47] miracles.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; I see miracles all around here.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. The greatest miracle is when you
[1:35:53] can receive the word for your day and
[1:35:55] come under it and come under the the the
[1:35:57] headship of it and believe it and take
[1:36:00] it and and possess it in your life. And
[1:36:02] then you're going to see miracles take
[1:36:04] place. Amen. You'll see things happen
[1:36:06] that you didn't think were possible. He
[1:36:08] says he says, "Don't you believe that?
[1:36:10] Say you're a you're a liar. Tell Satan
[1:36:12] you're a liar, Satan." Amen. God said
[1:36:15] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:36:17] forever. Take it everywhere your
[1:36:20] footsteps. That's possession.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:36:28] Remember, listen, you can go to the next
[1:36:31] slide. Remember Moses had given them all
[1:36:35] the instructions on how to possess the
[1:36:37] land.
[1:36:39] Brother Brandham, he brought
[1:36:42] the word that would bring us back to our
[1:36:46] original faith.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Okay? Moses didn't bring his own ideas.
[1:36:52] He didn't bring anything different. He
[1:36:54] brought thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; He brought the message of God to the
[1:37:00] people to turn them back to him.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what it was all
[1:37:04] about.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. told them not to mix
[1:37:08] themselves with any other peoples and
[1:37:10] nations outside of Israel. What was he
[1:37:12] saying? Don't mix this word.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Do not mix this with some other
[1:37:18] denominational teaching. Don't mix my
[1:37:21] word. Just take it the way it says it.
[1:37:24] You show me baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:37:26] Christ, I can show it to you. 8,000
[1:37:29] witnesses in the book of Acts alone
[1:37:32] where every single baptism was done in
[1:37:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:37:37] That's the word.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; You show me anything different, don't
[1:37:41] mix with it. I'm not mixing with baptism
[1:37:43] in the name of the father and of the son
[1:37:45] because they don't have a revelation of
[1:37:47] who the father is, who the son is, and
[1:37:49] who the holy ghost is. But Peter had a
[1:37:51] clear understanding when Jesus told him
[1:37:54] in Matthew 28, "Go ye and baptize in the
[1:37:56] name of the Father and of the Son and of
[1:37:59] the Holy Ghost." And what did Peter do
[1:38:02] on the day of Pentecost? 2:38
[1:38:05] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:38:08] because he knew that Jesus Christ was
[1:38:10] the father. Jesus Christ came to be the
[1:38:14] son and Jesus Christ went back so that
[1:38:17] he could come back on us as the Holy
[1:38:20] Ghost,
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; God himself.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had an understanding of that.
[1:38:27] And we've got an understanding of that.
[1:38:29] You got to have that understanding if
[1:38:31] you truly are going to be able to serve
[1:38:33] God in the reality of of this message in
[1:38:36] this word. You cannot be confused about
[1:38:39] Trinity. If you're in confusion of
[1:38:42] Trinity, you have not even been born
[1:38:44] again.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Because the new birth is the Holy Ghost
[1:38:50] himself.
[1:38:51] And the Holy Ghost comes in you and it
[1:38:55] goes back to the word and it'll never
[1:38:57] say anything different than what he
[1:38:59] wrote in the word because he wrote it by
[1:39:01] men that were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:04] So, how's he going to go against his own
[1:39:05] word? And people say, "No, no, no, no. I
[1:39:08] believe my pastor. I believe my church.
[1:39:10] I believe the Baptist church and well go
[1:39:12] ahead stay with the Baptist church. What
[1:39:13] can I tell you? Because this is not for
[1:39:17] Baptists or Presbyterians or
[1:39:20] Pentecostals
[1:39:22] or Methodists or Jehovah Witness. This
[1:39:25] is for the sons and daughters of God,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; attributes of God, those that God had in
[1:39:33] his mind before the foundations of the
[1:39:36] world. Glory to God. Amen. And so as
[1:39:40] long as the children of Israel did
[1:39:42] exactly what Joshua told them, God
[1:39:45] promised to be with them. It's as simple
[1:39:47] as that. And if we
[1:39:50] take the understanding that when we come
[1:39:52] and we receive the word through the
[1:39:54] five-fold ministry, we see that it's
[1:39:57] from the word and what he quotes from
[1:40:01] the prophet is exactly with the word.
[1:40:04] They all line up. It's because it's him.
[1:40:08] is because he's making the word real and
[1:40:11] confirming it to you personal.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; The Lord said only be courageous. Now,
[1:40:18] you can recall from the scriptures that
[1:40:20] when the children of Israel fought
[1:40:22] Amalecch and his armies that the people
[1:40:25] would hold up Moses's arms,
[1:40:28] okay? And as long as his arms were up,
[1:40:31] Israel would prevail over the enemy.
[1:40:35] And there was a time when brother Brham
[1:40:37] was on the scene and as long as brother
[1:40:40] Brandham would go into those meetings
[1:40:42] wherever he went, the Holy Ghost was
[1:40:45] vindicating his word. And it didn't
[1:40:48] matter what minister would come in.
[1:40:50] Didn't matter what doctrine would would
[1:40:53] be set against him. No matter what they
[1:40:56] would say that they they call him a
[1:40:58] false prophet. They tell him it's
[1:40:59] telepathy. This and that. No sir. As
[1:41:02] long as he was on the scene, God was
[1:41:05] vindicating his word through the
[1:41:07] ministry, proving that the word that was
[1:41:10] coming from him was truth.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; So, as long as they held up brother
[1:41:15] Brennham in in the meetings and as long
[1:41:18] as the people would come and support
[1:41:20] those meetings, God through faith would
[1:41:22] heal the people. They'd come up before
[1:41:24] him. It wasn't William Brandham that was
[1:41:27] discerning who they were. When the woman
[1:41:29] come up and says, "You're not from here.
[1:41:31] I don't know. Do you know me, sister?
[1:41:32] No. Never seen you in my life. You're
[1:41:34] from another city. You've come here
[1:41:36] because the doctor yesterday told you
[1:41:39] that you had cancer and you had no hope.
[1:41:43] Is that the truth, sister?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. And she'd start screaming and
[1:41:48] crying. How did he know that? It was not
[1:41:50] him. It was God proving and vindicating
[1:41:53] his word that he had just spoken. and
[1:41:56] those that were hearing and listening
[1:41:58] would recognize that this was God
[1:42:00] bringing his word in the day that that
[1:42:02] they were living in. So Moses' arms were
[1:42:04] up. The message of the hour was on the
[1:42:06] scene. His ministry was was was in full
[1:42:10] progress,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; but he's no longer here.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; But they still want to hold up the
[1:42:15] tapes.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; They want to say, "As long as you as
[1:42:19] long as you listen to these tapes,
[1:42:21] you'll overcome. You will you you're the
[1:42:24] bride of Christ. long as you believe
[1:42:26] these tapes. No, no, no. That's not
[1:42:28] that's not what the word says. Amen.
[1:42:31] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Now, Moses was
[1:42:34] dead.
[1:42:36] This is the this is the the scripture
[1:42:38] that we read. Moses is dead. He's off
[1:42:40] the scene. It's Joshua now. It's the
[1:42:42] Holy Ghost. It's Christ himself under
[1:42:44] the ministry of this hour that's
[1:42:46] presenting to you instruction on how to
[1:42:49] overcome and how to to to deal with your
[1:42:52] life so that you can come into your full
[1:42:53] adoption. Because that's what Joshua was
[1:42:56] was doing. He was placing sons and
[1:42:59] daughters of God so that they could come
[1:43:01] into their adoption
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; and authority.
[1:43:06] and the children. Now, Moses was dead
[1:43:08] and the children had to come into their
[1:43:10] own revelation on how to fight the enemy
[1:43:13] themselves. But as long as they obeyed
[1:43:16] the word of the Lord given through
[1:43:17] Joshua, the Lord would fight alongside
[1:43:21] of Israel. Here we see a perfect example
[1:43:24] of the Lord fighting alongside of
[1:43:26] Israel. As we go to the next scripture,
[1:43:29] Joshua had to come into his inheritance.
[1:43:31] Amen. Joshua was a fighter. Joshua was a
[1:43:35] type of the Holy Ghost, but Joshua came
[1:43:37] into his inheritance. And he goes on
[1:43:39] here, and we'll read it from Joshua 10
[1:43:43] 7-10. He says, "Joshua ascended from
[1:43:45] Gilgal. He and all the people of war
[1:43:48] with him, and all the mighty men of
[1:43:50] valor. And the Lord said unto Joshua,
[1:43:53] fear them not, for I have delivered them
[1:43:56] into thine hand. There shall not a man
[1:43:59] of them stand before thee."
[1:44:02] Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly
[1:44:05] and went up from Gilgal all night. Now
[1:44:08] pay attention. And the Lord discomforted
[1:44:10] them before Israel and slew them with a
[1:44:14] great slaughter at Gibian and chased
[1:44:17] them along the way that goeth up to
[1:44:20] Bethon and smokeote them to Azac
[1:44:24] and unto Mea.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; God was with them in their battle. Amen.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read the next slide. Verse
[1:44:34] 11. And it came to pass as they fled
[1:44:37] from before Israel and were in the going
[1:44:40] down to Bethon that the Lord cast down
[1:44:43] great stones from heaven. Oh, glory.
[1:44:47] Upon them unto Azac, and they died.
[1:44:50] There were more which died with
[1:44:52] hailstones than they whom the children
[1:44:55] of Israel slew with the sword.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. That's the God that we
[1:45:00] serve.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You think you got enemies. It
[1:45:03] don't matter how many enemies are around
[1:45:05] you. God is going to slew a lot more.
[1:45:07] He's going to he's going to take care of
[1:45:08] a lot more situations around your life
[1:45:11] than you could possibly imagine. You
[1:45:13] just need to stay with the word.
[1:45:17] You just need to stay with the
[1:45:18] instruction
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; because can you imagine you're out
[1:45:21] there, you're in the battlefield and
[1:45:23] you're and you're one of those soldiers
[1:45:24] and you you know like you know we listen
[1:45:27] I had to fight a battle this morning to
[1:45:28] get here.
[1:45:30] Everybody fights battles.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; It's a constant fight, saints. But
[1:45:34] wouldn't it isn't it nice when you when
[1:45:36] you could just you know you could just
[1:45:37] be still and you could keep your sword
[1:45:40] at the side and here you are you're just
[1:45:41] fighting this guy over here but you see
[1:45:43] 20 20 more coming from this side. Oh
[1:45:45] god, I'm dealing with this one over here
[1:45:47] and this one here. Now you got Now I get
[1:45:49] a call and oh I can see it's it's this
[1:45:50] brother here. He's got a problem. I get
[1:45:52] another call and there's oh there's
[1:45:54] another situation going on over here and
[1:45:56] and this and this situation and oh

[1:45:59] see you this Sunday and okay all right
[1:46:01] you know so many battles but you know
[1:46:02] you're dealing with this one and then
[1:46:04] all of a sudden God just deals with
[1:46:06] situations because you be still. You get
[1:46:09] down on your knees you say Lord you
[1:46:11] promised. Lord you said you'd be there.
[1:46:13] Lord, you you promise. And all of a
[1:46:15] sudden, stones come down and deal with
[1:46:17] this situation. Another one comes down
[1:46:19] and deals with that situation. I'm
[1:46:21] relying on that, saints. You can step
[1:46:24] into that kind of a walk with God. Amen.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God was fighting right
[1:46:30] alongside them. Amen. The Lord did not
[1:46:33] say would do it for them, but he but
[1:46:37] that he would fight right alongside
[1:46:40] them. I'll be with you
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; glory to God. Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; When you do it all, when you listen,
[1:46:51] when you do all that you can do,
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; don't worry. God will do the rest.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; He knows where your heart is.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; But if you're trying to do it all on
[1:46:59] your own, I can do this. I can do that.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; I see zealous, you know, I see zealous,
[1:47:05] you know, uh, brethren, you know,
[1:47:06] brother, I'm going to do this. I'm going
[1:47:07] to do that. I'm going to do just,
[1:47:09] brother,
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; just do this.
[1:47:12] Show me that you can deal with this
[1:47:14] little fox right here.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you overcome that fox,
[1:47:20] then then then you're going to be able
[1:47:22] to deal with the lion.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Okay? Cuz there's a you know that fox,
[1:47:26] one swipe of that and it's done. But
[1:47:28] that lion, he's going to be swiping at
[1:47:30] you. And you need to go through some
[1:47:32] things. You need to understand that
[1:47:35] you're an overcomer.
[1:47:37] You've you've been ordained to overcome,
[1:47:39] but you're not overcoming. Too many
[1:47:41] people are sitting back and they're not
[1:47:43] doing anything. They're not they're not
[1:47:45] stepping into their positions. They're
[1:47:47] not even going into the land. They don't
[1:47:49] even want to come into the land and and
[1:47:51] even say, "Okay,
[1:47:53] where's my placing? They're okay. I'm
[1:47:56] going."
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; They don't even want to show up.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; My God, what hour are we living in? This
[1:48:03] is the hour where sons come into
[1:48:05] adoption.
[1:48:06] This is a maturity stage. This is the
[1:48:09] hour where where we recognize that we
[1:48:11] are sons and daughters of God. We're
[1:48:13] we're beyond the point of, "Oh, brother,
[1:48:15] how you doing? Oh, you know, things are
[1:48:17] hard. Things are tough. Ah, you know,
[1:48:19] miserable. Look at the weather outside.
[1:48:21] You're you're too negative.
[1:48:24] You're just drawn more of the negative
[1:48:26] to you.
[1:48:29] You need to get into the positive power
[1:48:32] of the Holy Ghost that has the ability
[1:48:34] to overcome whatever situation you have.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; You need to give God glory that he's
[1:48:41] with me.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; He said he'd be with me to possess this
[1:48:45] land.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, next slide. Verse
[1:48:51] Joshua 10. He says, 'Then spake Joshua
[1:48:53] to the Lord in the day when the Lord
[1:48:55] delivered up the Amorites before the
[1:48:57] children of Israel and said in the sight
[1:48:59] of Israel, son,
[1:49:02] stand thou still upon Gibian, and thou
[1:49:05] moon in the valley of Agelon. And the
[1:49:07] sun stood still,
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; and the moon stayed until the people had
[1:49:13] avenged themselves upon their enemies.
[1:49:16] Is not this written in the book of
[1:49:18] Jasher? So the sun stood still in the
[1:49:21] midst of heaven, and hasted not to go
[1:49:24] down about a whole day, and there was no
[1:49:27] day like that before it or after it that
[1:49:31] the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a
[1:49:33] man. For the Lord fought for Israel.
[1:49:37] Listen,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; there had not been a day before or even
[1:49:40] after it. But this is a new day.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; This is adoption time.
[1:49:46] This is when the sons of God, where the
[1:49:49] earth is groaning for the manifestation
[1:49:51] of the sons of God.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; This is the age where the mighty angel
[1:49:56] himself comes down to declare, I have a
[1:50:00] book of inheritance, glory. I've got
[1:50:02] names in that book that I've given
[1:50:04] authority to to not only just possess
[1:50:07] the land, but to speak
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; into the situations that need to be
[1:50:12] dealt with. Amen. Glory to God. There
[1:50:15] was, listen, the Lord hearkened unto the
[1:50:17] voice of a man. He was not some
[1:50:20] supernatural giant.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Joshua was just another man. What did
[1:50:25] God do? He hearkened to the voice of a
[1:50:27] man.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God wants to possess man.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; What was Adam in the beginning? Man. Let
[1:50:35] us What is the What What does Adam mean?
[1:50:37] Adam, the word Adam means man. God
[1:50:42] taking possession of man. He wants to
[1:50:46] dwell in man. He wants to manifest
[1:50:48] through man.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:52] [Music]
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Why did he do it? Because Joshua
[1:50:56] believed what the Lord had told him to
[1:50:58] do and was determined to do what God had
[1:51:01] asked him to do. Joshua was not willing
[1:51:04] to deviate
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; from what God had told him. Amen.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; He says Joshua, I was with Moses. I gave
[1:51:13] him instruction. I told him exactly all
[1:51:16] the instruction I told him was listen to
[1:51:19] me. Go back to the word. Go back to the
[1:51:22] word. Listen to the word. Now you go do
[1:51:25] all that he commanded you to do. What
[1:51:27] did he command you to do? Go back to the
[1:51:29] word. Recognize the word for your day.
[1:51:31] Recognize what I'm going to do for you
[1:51:33] today. Listen to the instruction. I'm
[1:51:35] giving you the land. I'm telling you,
[1:51:37] I'm going to be with you. go in and
[1:51:39] possess the land. That's what he had
[1:51:41] told him he was going to do. And Joshua
[1:51:44] was not going to say, "Oh, I wonder if
[1:51:47] there's, you know, I wonder if God's
[1:51:48] going to really do it." No. No. He
[1:51:50] believed it to the point where he would
[1:51:52] not deviate in any way, shape, or form.
[1:51:54] He wouldn't look to the left. He
[1:51:56] wouldn't look to the right. He just
[1:51:57] looked straight ahead. He said, "This is
[1:51:59] what God has called me to do.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; This is what God wants me to do. God has
[1:52:04] anointed me with the Holy Ghost to do
[1:52:06] it. That is the purpose of God. I'm not
[1:52:08] going to deviate from that. God could
[1:52:10] trust Joshua
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; to the point where if Joshua spoke the
[1:52:14] word, he'd say,
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; "Stand still."
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; That was God's voice.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; That was God's purpose. That was God's
[1:52:24] desire in Joshua. He believed God.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Do you?
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Not willing to deviate from the purpose
[1:52:33] of God. He recognized that he was called
[1:52:35] to do it. If there was an obstacle in
[1:52:38] his way, it just had to move.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Do you believe
[1:52:42] God that way? Listen, you can go to work
[1:52:44] tomorrow. You can go to situations
[1:52:46] tomorrow. If there's an obstacle, it's
[1:52:48] got to move.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Not when you say it's got to move. You
[1:52:51] just wait. You just tell it to move.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Move in the name of Jesus Christ. This
[1:52:56] is my authority as a son of God. You
[1:52:58] wait now on God to prove his word. He
[1:53:00] knows if you truly believe what you say.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's look at the next
[1:53:08] slide. Listen in the in the message of
[1:53:10] parad. It's a paradox.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; But God did it anyhow. What? By a man.
[1:53:16] He says, not a god, not some great angel
[1:53:20] come down from heaven. A man with faith
[1:53:23] in a mission that he was given to take
[1:53:26] the land.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The word of God was behind
[1:53:32] it. I give you this land and everywhere
[1:53:35] the souls of your foot shall set upon
[1:53:37] that I give you. It's yours. Footsteps
[1:53:41] meant possession. And the sun is what?
[1:53:44] What? The achievement he was trying to
[1:53:46] do. See, his enemy was routed and he
[1:53:48] knew it. If the sun would set, then the
[1:53:51] kings would get together and they'd come
[1:53:53] back upon him in double forces. So the
[1:53:56] sun was going down and Joshua, a man
[1:54:00] commanded to do this, said, "Son, stand
[1:54:04] still."
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; You got situations in your life. You got
[1:54:10] a cancer. You got a heart problem. You
[1:54:12] got a blood pressure problem. You got
[1:54:15] that's just another enemy. Oh, the
[1:54:17] doctor says that I got blood pressure. I
[1:54:20] got diabetes. It's just the enemy trying
[1:54:23] to surround you. You say, "Stand still
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; and be gone in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:54:30] and watch God come down." He's going to
[1:54:34] stone that enemy. He's going to stone
[1:54:36] that enemy because you're believing
[1:54:38] God's word for this day and for this
[1:54:40] hour.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "If you say to this
[1:54:44] mountain, if there is a mountain in the
[1:54:47] way, then we need to speak to that
[1:54:49] mountain.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; We need to deal with that." We're
[1:54:52] talking about adopted sons here.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about just speak the
[1:54:56] word. We're talking about you coming
[1:54:58] into your adoption
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; where you recognize that you that you
[1:55:02] are what God says you are.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; There's a difference, saints.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; That's why when when when when the, you
[1:55:08] know, when the Holy Ghost was on the
[1:55:10] disciples and some of them, you know,
[1:55:11] they went to the sons ofKeva, you know,
[1:55:13] they went and tried to, you know, kick
[1:55:15] us.
[1:55:16] Paul, I know,
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Peter. I know,
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; but who are you?
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Boom. Them right out.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Beat them to death. Don't be trying to
[1:55:30] put this on, saints.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Get down on your knees and say, "I want
[1:55:33] the real thing.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost for this hour." I
[1:55:39] That That's the power that's going to
[1:55:41] overcome. It's not by your own ability.
[1:55:42] It's not how well you know this quotes.
[1:55:44] It's not how well you listen to the
[1:55:46] tapes. It's not how many quotes you can
[1:55:48] quote. It's not who you know. Oh, no
[1:55:50] sir. If you know him, it's okay. But
[1:55:53] it's but it's all about you coming into
[1:55:54] your position as an adopted son who has
[1:55:58] obtained his inheritance.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Are we past one?
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; 43. Okay, praise God. Let them come.
[1:56:20] If you say to this mountain, but if you
[1:56:22] are adopted now,
[1:56:25] this is your inheritance. Everything
[1:56:28] I've been telling you. If you if you've
[1:56:30] been adopted, you know where you're
[1:56:32] standing. Maybe you got a little bit
[1:56:34] complacent.
[1:56:36] You know, maybe you've been dealing with
[1:56:37] a little, you know, the battles have
[1:56:38] been heavy. Sure, they're going to get
[1:56:41] heavy from time to time.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:45] Glory to God.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; That's okay.
[1:56:50] God says, "Get back up again.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Don't give up." He says, "I'm going to
[1:56:56] be there. I'm going to be with you."
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. We're going to
[1:57:01] continue next week and we're going to be
[1:57:04] looking at some some aspects of, you
[1:57:07] know, how we get into situations.
[1:57:09] Sometimes God wants to place us into our
[1:57:13] positions. God wants us to take the land
[1:57:15] and then, you know, we start walking for
[1:57:17] a while. We start, you know, serving the
[1:57:19] Lord for so many years and, you know,
[1:57:21] and then all of a sudden, we start to
[1:57:23] make, you know, deals with the enemy.
[1:57:26] In the Old Testament, they called it
[1:57:28] tributes where you start making deals
[1:57:31] with the enemy and say, "Okay, I'm still
[1:57:32] the boss. You can stay in my house, but
[1:57:35] you listen to me and do what I say." No.
[1:57:39] Okay. Come out.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to look at all those things.
[1:57:44] Amen. Praise God. Let's let's let's uh
[1:57:47] let's go to prayer. Amen. We've got a
[1:57:51] request here for
[1:57:53] for Sarah Hope. She's having burning
[1:57:56] pains in her eyes.
[1:57:58] Flash of light that can't properly Where
[1:58:01] is she?
[1:58:03] Amen. Are you okay to come here?
[1:58:08] Praise God. Let's all bow our heads,
[1:58:10] saints.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Let's believe. Brother Desmond, come.
[1:58:17] [Music]
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:58:21] we are so grateful today, Lord, that
[1:58:25] in this atmosphere right now, Lord, how
[1:58:27] can sickness even stand here? How can it
[1:58:30] even want to be in this presence, Lord?
[1:58:33] But father, you have given us the
[1:58:35] authority by the word of God that we can
[1:58:38] lay our hands upon the sick and that
[1:58:40] they would recover. Lord Jesus, our
[1:58:44] sister hope, Lord, she's sister Sarah
[1:58:46] Hope, desiring, Lord, that this
[1:58:49] affliction upon her eyes be lifted, oh
[1:58:52] God, in the name of Jesus Christ. May it
[1:58:55] leave her body, leave her eyes, leave
[1:58:58] her her bloodstream, leave every atom
[1:59:00] and every molecule of her being right
[1:59:02] now. Satan, loose her atmospheres now in
[1:59:07] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:59:11] Lord, thank you for
[1:59:13] touching each and every one. Lord, you
[1:59:16] can go, sister. You're going to be well.
[1:59:20] Lord, you see all the uplifted hands of
[1:59:22] the people.
[1:59:24] Thank you.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; You see the needs that are in our midst,
[1:59:28] Lord. Our precious sister Sheila, Lord,
[1:59:29] she stepped out today on the word of
[1:59:32] God, believing, Lord, that if she could
[1:59:34] get into the house of the Lord,
[1:59:36] something drew her into this presence,
[1:59:38] Lord. Oh God, won't you have your way
[1:59:41] this morning, Lord, and let your
[1:59:43] anointing sweep over her body right now
[1:59:46] in the name of Jesus Christ? Lord, let
[1:59:48] there be healing virtue move through her
[1:59:51] body. Let let all the saints project
[1:59:53] love into that situation and Satan, you
[1:59:56] loose her in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, let your spirit move over that
[2:00:05] home, that family, her husband Patrick,
[2:00:08] Lord, her children, Noah and Naomi. Oh
[2:00:11] God, her family, her loved ones, her
[2:00:12] mom, her father, her sisters and her
[2:00:14] brothers. Lord, let the power of your
[2:00:17] spirit give them confidence and courage
[2:00:20] to stand as adopted sons and daughters
[2:00:22] of God and stand there and believe your
[2:00:25] word and believe that you're still the
[2:00:27] same God. Grant it, Lord. You see other
[2:00:31] uplifted hands this morning, Lord. There
[2:00:33] may be a healing here, a healing. Lord,
[2:00:35] both my hands are up in the air. Lord, I
[2:00:37] need I Lord, the pain that's been in my
[2:00:39] shoulders, Father, I I I I bind its
[2:00:42] power and its influence in the name of
[2:00:44] Jesus Christ. Lord, you see every
[2:00:46] uplifted hand, Lord. Touch those needs,
[2:00:48] Lord. Heal those bodies, Lord. Let there
[2:00:51] not be a feeble one in the midst of the
[2:00:53] people today. Oh God, in the midst of
[2:00:55] your children today, Lord, you're still
[2:00:57] the same God. You're still the same
[2:00:59] pillar of fire that moved in the midst
[2:01:01] of the children of Israel.
[2:01:04] Have your way today, Father. We commit
[2:01:05] this entire service and all that was
[2:01:09] revealed into our hearts. Oh God, we
[2:01:11] place it into your hands now. Lord, go
[2:01:13] with us this week. Prosper our way,
[2:01:15] Lord. Give us what we have need of, oh
[2:01:18] God. Bless your people, we pray in Jesus
