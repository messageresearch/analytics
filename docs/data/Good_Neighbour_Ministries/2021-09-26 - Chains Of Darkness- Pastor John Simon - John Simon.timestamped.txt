[32:09] [Music]
[32:32] praise god
[32:35] praise the lord
[32:37] we have come to worship his holiness
[32:41] to give him glory and honor
[32:43] and most of all to worship in spirit
[32:47] and in the truth praise the lord may the
[32:51] lord bless you everyone praise god
[32:54] please be seated
[32:58] lord of god
[33:00] we're happy to see you brother god bless
[33:02] you richly amen glad glad to see every
[33:05] one of you in the house of lord i
[33:07] rejoice to see you in the house of god
[33:10] for as you know we're living in a
[33:12] changing age
[33:14] things have been moving so fast
[33:16] that we are actually spiritually and
[33:19] naturally being almost forced
[33:22] to catch up right
[33:26] right so uh because everything is
[33:28] changing digitally
[33:31] and it's gone into
[33:33] the higher realms
[33:35] just apply it spiritually and you'll
[33:37] understand what i'm saying it's gone
[33:39] into the in the realm of the spirit of
[33:42] god
[33:43] uh much higher right like in the third
[33:46] pull when brother branham said at the
[33:49] end of the one message he said oh it's
[33:52] two o'clock
[33:54] oh my
[33:55] and did you hear while we were singing
[33:58] it went to an octave higher one octave
[34:01] higher went into another dimension so i
[34:04] believe that we are now
[34:07] entered
[34:08] into another dimension
[34:12] because we live in two worlds
[34:15] physically we are right here in the
[34:17] natural world but spiritually we are
[34:20] living in
[34:22] the world and realm of the spirit
[34:25] creatures of time born in time but
[34:28] really come from eternity
[34:30] and so we are living in a time of return
[34:35] the time of the great jubilee
[34:38] not in the way that many expected to be
[34:41] but we are going back to our inheritance
[34:44] back to our homeland
[34:46] back to our heavenly father back to our
[34:49] king and his kingdom which is not of
[34:52] this world
[34:53] but of this war of the uh realm of the
[34:56] spirit of god the kingdom of god and i'm
[34:59] so glad for that that i'm a part of this
[35:03] but remember this
[35:05] while all that is going on god is
[35:07] stripping away all the shock
[35:10] he's tripping away everything else that
[35:12] surrounded the seed to keep us safe
[35:16] and we have all got to find a position
[35:19] in our place
[35:21] and that doesn't mean you got to go
[35:22] searching around i just mean you stay in
[35:24] the spirit of god and the spirit of god
[35:26] will place
[35:27] that stone or brick in the temple
[35:30] exactly where he wants it
[35:32] right
[35:33] but you must know your position
[35:36] and just be comfortable with it amen
[35:40] praise god god called me to preach i
[35:42] preached god called you to be in the pew
[35:45] and listen
[35:46] just do that
[35:48] you don't know anything else that's all
[35:49] god is asking you for if the king asked
[35:52] you to go and do some big thing win a
[35:54] war general wouldn't you go win the war
[35:57] all he's asking you now is to go dip
[36:00] just go sit and listen to the preaching
[36:01] and let the water wash over your soul
[36:04] that's all he's asking
[36:06] right so and uh and he was set free so
[36:10] it's that simple we just gotta humble
[36:12] down ourselves because all manner of
[36:15] spirits is moving right now
[36:18] and they're playing on every iota of
[36:22] every
[36:23] little thing you have on the inside that
[36:25] you may think you got hidden up
[36:28] and the holy spirit is bringing about
[36:30] conditions and circumstances
[36:33] to manifest the sons of god
[36:37] manifest the churn of god
[36:39] but don't always remember the two work
[36:41] together when one is manifesting here is
[36:44] bringing out the other one over there
[36:46] right so you always have to be conscious
[36:49] of god and what god is doing in this
[36:52] hour so this great revolution great
[36:56] changes as brother brown said they don't
[36:58] know what is great they're looking for
[37:00] all kinds of fantastics and it's taking
[37:03] place right in front of you
[37:06] amen
[37:07] only if you have the eyes god will give
[37:10] that to you without them you won't see a
[37:12] thing you you will want to know what is
[37:14] he talking about or you want to know
[37:16] what's going on well is there something
[37:18] mysterious is he trying to talk as if
[37:21] there's something going on and i'm not
[37:23] seeing it
[37:25] well it's happening and it's all around
[37:28] us
[37:29] and one day soon who knows it'll come to
[37:32] its conclusion
[37:34] and we'll all be caught up into his
[37:37] divine presence praise the lord
[37:40] i i want to take
[37:43] um
[37:44] a subject here today
[37:47] and um it's funny that
[37:50] i will use the scripture out of matthew
[37:53] chapter
[37:54] 4
[37:55] verses 14 to 17.
[38:13] okay
[38:14] shall we read the word of god
[38:18] chapter 4
[38:20] 14-17
[38:21] that it might be fulfilled
[38:24] which was spoken by
[38:27] isaiah's the prophet saying
[38:30] the land of zebulun and the land of
[38:32] nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond
[38:36] jordan
[38:38] galilee
[38:39] of the gentiles
[38:41] the people which sat in darkness
[38:46] saw a great saw great light
[38:49] and to them which sat in the region
[38:53] and shadow of death
[38:55] light
[38:57] is sprung up
[38:59] from that time
[39:00] jesus began to preach and say
[39:03] repent
[39:05] for the kingdom of god is at hand amen
[39:10] our gracious father thank you for the
[39:12] reading of the bread of life your word
[39:15] and we pray lord that your blessings
[39:17] together
[39:18] visible audience invisible audience
[39:22] local father
[39:24] international wherever the people are
[39:27] made thy light and truth go forth father
[39:31] and may the great holy spirit
[39:34] take control of every heart every life
[39:38] every mind
[39:39] and may the word of god have its
[39:41] preeminence but we ask it in the name of
[39:44] jesus christ amen
[39:46] and amen
[39:48] praise the lord there's a slight ring
[39:51] slight
[39:53] please be seated
[39:59] while you are doing that let me
[40:03] ask for the
[40:05] reading
[40:06] of
[40:08] two other scriptures
[40:11] ii peter
[40:13] 2 4
[40:17] 2 peter
[40:19] chapter 2
[40:21] verse 4.
[40:26] praise the lord
[40:43] i'm not as fast as the draw as i used to
[40:45] be
[40:47] it's harder to find these
[40:49] thin pages
[40:52] ii peter
[40:54] page is stuck together here now
[40:57] okay
[41:02] for if god spared not the angels that
[41:05] sinned but cast them down to hell
[41:09] and delivered them into chains of
[41:12] darkness
[41:13] to be reserved
[41:15] unto judgment
[41:16] now i'd like to take that for a thought
[41:19] chains
[41:20] of darkness
[41:23] to be reserved
[41:25] unto judgment
[41:27] okay and the next scripture is jude
[41:31] 5 and 6.
[41:39] jude
[41:40] five and six
[41:49] i will therefore put you in remembrance
[41:52] though you once knew this
[41:54] how the lord having saved the people
[41:58] out of the land of egypt
[42:00] afterward
[42:02] destroyed them
[42:04] that believe not
[42:06] and the angels which kept not their
[42:09] first estate
[42:11] but left their own habitations
[42:15] he had reserved
[42:18] in everlasting chains
[42:21] under
[42:22] darkness
[42:24] under the judgment
[42:26] of the great day
[42:27] amen praise the lord hallelujah god
[42:31] bless the reading of his precious
[42:34] and holy word amen now of course the
[42:38] bible mentions about chains here
[42:41] and um i want to take for the topic
[42:44] chains of darkness
[42:46] and since the bible talks about chains
[42:49] first of all we know that the chain
[42:52] is a means of restraint
[42:55] it's a means of
[42:59] control to use to control
[43:02] it's a means of
[43:05] enslavement
[43:06] and a means
[43:08] of imprisonment
[43:11] so so
[43:12] that chain has a lot of um meanings
[43:16] um to it when we think of that
[43:20] now we know that satan has a chain but
[43:22] god also has a
[43:24] chain and
[43:27] you know satan's chain there
[43:31] is one
[43:32] that
[43:34] he
[43:35] put the whole human race
[43:38] in chains
[43:40] and it it's under the chains
[43:43] of
[43:44] darkness to the word of god
[43:47] hallelujah
[43:48] but i want you to know god has changed
[43:50] too
[43:52] because god put him in darkness
[43:56] into the understanding and revelation of
[43:58] his word
[44:00] right
[44:01] so satan is in darkness
[44:03] to what is being revealed and made known
[44:06] to us for unto you it is given to know
[44:11] the mystery of the kingdom
[44:13] but unto him or them it's not given
[44:16] they're left in darkness concerning
[44:18] what's been revealed to you
[44:21] amen and satan on the other hand is
[44:25] making sure that he chains the people
[44:28] away from the word of god
[44:30] so that they don't get a revelation of
[44:34] it
[44:35] even if they're exposed to it
[44:38] he has clouds of darkness that he will
[44:41] put over the word which we will touch on
[44:45] a little
[44:46] bit later
[44:48] we know that satan
[44:50] uh using eve
[44:53] uh he enslaved the entire human race
[44:57] in chains of sin
[45:00] chains of various habits
[45:04] chains of darkness
[45:07] chains of
[45:09] denomination
[45:11] chains of tradition
[45:13] chains of culture
[45:16] you have to behave this way you have to
[45:18] do this this way
[45:20] they're all chains that satan has
[45:24] in his so-called
[45:26] civilization
[45:28] uh and he uses those chains to bind and
[45:32] to enslave
[45:34] the people and hold them under his power
[45:38] of
[45:39] his demonic power
[45:41] so people need deliverance
[45:43] the whole human race needs deliverance
[45:46] the whole human race needs to come out
[45:49] from the darkness that satan has
[45:52] it is the rising of the sun brother
[45:54] branham said oh
[45:56] this great hour when the whole world is
[45:59] covered with gloom and darkness
[46:03] and everywhere it's so gloomy you can
[46:06] hardly see
[46:08] but he said thank god there was a
[46:10] resurrection
[46:12] and it is now the rising of the sun
[46:15] hallelujah when the sun comes up the
[46:18] light shines and the darkness must flee
[46:21] away amen praise god hallelujah works

[54:45] 20 verse 3
[54:48] john said i looked and saw
[54:50] and i saw another mighty angel
[54:53] coming down from god out of heaven
[54:56] and as he came down in his hands he had
[55:00] not a chain but the great chain
[55:03] hallelujah he had a great chain in his
[55:06] hand and with that great chain he came
[55:10] and bound the dragon he bound the devil
[55:14] and all his works praise god hallelujah
[55:17] and reserve him for judgment amen
[55:20] brother sister i'm telling you that
[55:23] great chain is the word of god
[55:27] the revealed word of god is the great
[55:30] chain that that angel used to bind satan
[55:34] with praise god hallelujah amen because
[55:38] satan is always bound by what by the
[55:42] word of god the spoken word of god is
[55:46] what binds him and that of course is the
[55:50] name of jesus christ
[55:52] you see i didn't understand until the
[55:55] spirit made that clear hallelujah that
[55:59] another scripture out of revelation i
[56:02] believe it's revelation 19 he saw i saw
[56:05] a great multitude in the presence of god
[56:08] shouting hallelujah our god reigns
[56:11] hallelujah and the marriage of the lamb
[56:14] is coming so and then they saw this
[56:17] great another white horse rider riding
[56:21] on a white horse with the armies of
[56:23] heaven behind him hallelujah and when he
[56:27] was coming down then i heard the voice
[56:30] saying and his name is the word of god
[56:35] hallelujah he is king of kings and lord
[56:39] of lords amen the word of god is king
[56:43] the word of god is lord of lords the
[56:45] word of god rules over everything
[56:49] and his name
[56:51] is the word of god
[56:53] satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus
[56:56] christ
[56:57] then the holy spirit said you see
[56:59] people think it's just calling the name
[57:02] jesus
[57:03] there is many jesuses
[57:06] but the devil knows
[57:09] who knows
[57:10] when they say in the name which jesus
[57:13] you're talking about
[57:15] and saying it it's the revelation of the
[57:18] word you're rebuking him with you
[57:20] overcoming him by the word of god and
[57:24] your testimony you're overcoming him by
[57:27] the power of almighty god that's within
[57:30] the word of god
[57:32] hallelujah
[57:34] amen yes brother sister i'm so thankful
[57:38] that the devil is a defeated foe
[57:42] amen and his power is broken
[57:45] hallelujah
[57:46] oh praise god
[57:48] let me see i'm looking for i can just
[57:52] talk to you where
[57:54] the bible tells us the prophet says the
[57:57] whole chain
[57:59] the whole chain
[58:02] was broken
[58:03] there in the garden of eden
[58:06] the chain of the word
[58:08] in other places you will find where he
[58:10] says the word of god is like a chain
[58:14] it's hanging over him
[58:16] he uses the term other places how it's a
[58:19] chain and it goes in a circle
[58:22] amen and you can't break that chain for
[58:26] you not chains are broken at their
[58:28] weakest links
[58:30] amen praise god hallelujah so
[58:34] chain the chain of his word doors in a
[58:38] door you'll find it in there where he
[58:41] talks about the chain of god's word
[58:45] indictment he calls it he said not only
[58:47] is it the word but the chain of all
[58:50] truths
[58:51] praise god truth moves in a chain it
[58:54] goes from revelation genesis to
[58:57] revelation in a big circle and it goes
[58:59] round and round back and forth why it's
[59:02] eternal
[59:04] it can never change
[59:06] it's the same yesterday today and
[59:09] forever
[59:10] the word of god hallelujah
[59:14] amen praise god lean not to dine on
[59:20] understanding praise god let me just
[59:24] relax a bit here because i'm getting
[59:26] excited over what um i'm seeing here
[59:30] within
[59:31] the word of god but i want you also to
[59:35] follow me
[59:37] with what i'm saying here praise the
[59:39] lord he's speaking and lean not to thine
[59:42] own understanding you see
[59:44] this is from the beginning
[59:47] it is so plainly made known to us from
[59:51] the beginning
[59:53] that god gave his first family on earth
[59:56] his word to live by only his word
[1:00:02] was for them to live by
[1:00:04] now
[1:00:05] that's not through them eating just
[1:00:07] natural food and so forth
[1:00:10] but his word
[1:00:11] there were to live by it
[1:00:14] eternally
[1:00:16] as long as they kept that word
[1:00:19] they lived eternally but the first
[1:00:23] little phrase of that word was
[1:00:26] misplaced and just misplacing one little
[1:00:30] phrase of that word
[1:00:32] the whole chain broke
[1:00:36] and the human race then plunged right
[1:00:40] into death my the whole chain broke the
[1:00:45] chain of his word my praise god let me
[1:00:48] tell you something friends the word does
[1:00:52] two things
[1:00:53] whenever the word is preached or
[1:00:56] declared or comes on the scene even
[1:00:58] personally it does two things it blind
[1:01:02] sound and it casts light to the eyes of
[1:01:04] the of some others
[1:01:07] it always does that it blind some and
[1:01:10] open the eyes of some others
[1:01:13] not only does it blind but it binds some
[1:01:17] and it frees others up hallelujah when
[1:01:20] they receive the revelation of the
[1:01:23] living word of the living god listen to
[1:01:26] the scripture
[1:01:27] i shut
[1:01:28] and no man opens that's the word of god
[1:01:32] speaking and saying i shut and no man
[1:01:35] opens and when i open no man shuts
[1:01:39] praise god so the word will bind some
[1:01:43] blind some but will free up some and
[1:01:46] cast light on the word for others oh
[1:01:48] praise god we aren't you glad for this
[1:01:51] revealed word of god
[1:01:54] not just we thank god for the written
[1:01:56] bible
[1:01:57] but we thank god for the capacity the
[1:02:00] ingredient or that
[1:02:03] part of us that's able to read between
[1:02:06] the lines
[1:02:07] and to understand what he god is saying
[1:02:10] to us even though the words may not be
[1:02:14] literally written down there on the
[1:02:17] pages weekend yet understand what god is
[1:02:20] saying to us praise peter god hallelujah
[1:02:25] amen yes sir so therefore we understand
[1:02:29] therefore
[1:02:31] this is where when he shuts your eyes
[1:02:35] that's when
[1:02:36] that person comes under
[1:02:39] god's chains of darkness
[1:02:43] the darkness you're chained
[1:02:46] under those chains of darkness
[1:02:49] and there they're blinded and they can't
[1:02:52] see
[1:02:53] satan has his chains too
[1:02:55] and he brings darkness the darkness of
[1:02:58] ignorance
[1:02:59] the darkness of unbelief the darkness of
[1:03:03] tradition
[1:03:04] the darkness of denomination and he's
[1:03:07] brought that darkness sicker and thicker
[1:03:10] down through the church ages until this
[1:03:13] hour when there's a total blackout of
[1:03:16] the light and truth of the word of god
[1:03:19] hallelujah but god already had made a
[1:03:22] promise i will restore said the lord
[1:03:29] by zechariah the prophet god had said it
[1:03:32] shall be light about the evening time
[1:03:35] the path to glory you will surely find
[1:03:38] where the songwriters have in the
[1:03:41] waterway the word in the waterway is the
[1:03:44] light today buried in the name of jesus
[1:03:48] jesus who the word of god his name shall
[1:03:52] be called the word of god
[1:03:56] amen praise god hallelujah oh my think
[1:04:01] of it how marvelous and wonderful that
[1:04:04] we are a part of god's great economy and
[1:04:08] that he has delivered us in such a
[1:04:11] marvelous and wonderful and precious way
[1:04:15] amen praise god hallelujah let me tell
[1:04:18] you friends
[1:04:19] listen to him when god first set the
[1:04:22] human race on earth he told them to live
[1:04:24] by his word
[1:04:27] god's word is like a chain
[1:04:30] the whole
[1:04:31] is passing across hell with it and the
[1:04:34] chain is best is at its only at its best
[1:04:37] its weakest link
[1:04:39] god wants us to keep
[1:04:41] every
[1:04:42] word
[1:04:43] now
[1:04:44] that was the first of the bible
[1:04:48] just to break one word
[1:04:51] plunge the whole human race
[1:04:54] into the darkness
[1:04:56] of death
[1:04:58] amen
[1:05:00] what caused sin
[1:05:01] not just by a
[1:05:03] a point blank
[1:05:05] lie
[1:05:07] but because
[1:05:08] eve
[1:05:11] misconstrued the word
[1:05:14] the devil did that to her
[1:05:16] cause her to miscontrol one word
[1:05:21] one word broke that chain
[1:05:24] and refused to take one word
[1:05:27] that was the beginning of the bible in
[1:05:29] the center jesus said man shall live
[1:05:34] by not by bread alone but by every word
[1:05:39] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:05:43] the entire word you believe in other
[1:05:46] words that means the revelation of him
[1:05:52] amen man must live by every word flesh
[1:05:56] and blood has not revealed this unto you
[1:05:58] but my father in heaven has revealed
[1:06:01] this unto you and upon this rock he said
[1:06:04] not just jesus
[1:06:07] amen
[1:06:08] not the church
[1:06:10] but the revelation of who he is
[1:06:14] that he is the almighty god
[1:06:17] the eternal father he is father son holy
[1:06:20] ghost bright morning star lilia the
[1:06:23] valley amen soon coming king he is the
[1:06:27] savior baptizer the mighty god amen yes
[1:06:31] sir when you understand that you realize
[1:06:34] what is really going on hallelujah you
[1:06:38] must believe the entire word
[1:06:41] of the living god hallelujah amen praise
[1:06:46] god i tell you brother sister he is the
[1:06:49] same yesterday today and forever and he
[1:06:54] does not change and i'm thankful to god
[1:06:57] for that that is the same yesterday and
[1:07:00] forever glory to god hallelujah amen now
[1:07:05] we also know
[1:07:07] that brother sister that he god
[1:07:12] always likes to give us a pardon a way
[1:07:16] out
[1:07:17] that we can escape
[1:07:19] because satan will keep you in his
[1:07:22] prison by chaining you
[1:07:24] chaining you by
[1:07:26] habits he'll chain you in every way
[1:07:30] sometimes some people can't act because
[1:07:32] of fear
[1:07:33] they're chained by fear
[1:07:36] they try to act and
[1:07:38] it's an invisible chain but they can't
[1:07:41] feel themselves moving from a certain
[1:07:44] spot in their life into another kind of
[1:07:47] consciousness another kind of awareness

[1:11:02] oh praise god hallelujah and brother
[1:11:05] branham tells it in this way in the form
[1:11:07] of a simple story
[1:11:10] here long ago a farmer had a corn field
[1:11:13] and crows kept coming by eating up his
[1:11:15] cone
[1:11:16] so he set a trap and he caught one of
[1:11:19] them
[1:11:20] he said i'll fix the rest of them real
[1:11:22] good
[1:11:23] and he tied the one that he caught by
[1:11:24] his foot to a fence
[1:11:27] and that puro crow began to hobble and
[1:11:29] jump and tried to fly and he couldn't
[1:11:31] get anywhere
[1:11:33] because he was tied up amen
[1:11:36] chains of darkness around the people
[1:11:39] tied them up
[1:11:40] amen and he got so he couldn't hardly
[1:11:43] fly or jump and the other crows would
[1:11:46] fly over and said come on johnny let's
[1:11:49] go south it's turning
[1:11:53] let's winter
[1:11:53] in winter you'll die setting out there
[1:11:56] in the cold so let's go south uh johnny
[1:12:00] and he said
[1:12:02] he tried to fly he can't he go back down
[1:12:05] he said i can't i can't
[1:12:07] you see i'm tied up how i can't do it
[1:12:11] and one day a good man came by
[1:12:13] and said poor old johnny gold crow look
[1:12:16] at him hobbling around he's getting
[1:12:18] rather weak
[1:12:20] so he caught the fellow petted him and
[1:12:22] patted him a little bit took that
[1:12:24] tight that latch off his foot like that
[1:12:27] and turned him loose and said you're
[1:12:30] free johnny all right johnny boy
[1:12:34] ready to go now oh my when he walked
[1:12:37] away that old crow just kept walking
[1:12:40] wrong in the same circle that he always
[1:12:43] used to walk
[1:12:46] he wasn't untied
[1:12:49] and yet he didn't know it
[1:12:52] the other cross came by and said come on
[1:12:55] johnny let's go south it's come in
[1:12:57] winter he said i can't i can't i'm tired
[1:13:00] but you're not tired he said but i'm
[1:13:02] tight you see but he was tied in his
[1:13:04] mind
[1:13:05] it was tiny in the soul
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:08] he was a prisoner and a chain with
[1:13:11] invisible chains and there's a lot of
[1:13:14] people that are chained with invisible
[1:13:16] chains of all manner of things within
[1:13:19] their hearts within their lives listen
[1:13:21] brother branham that's the way it is
[1:13:24] with men and women tonight
[1:13:26] you don't know they they don't know
[1:13:29] their position in jesus christ the devil
[1:13:32] may have tied you up with tb
[1:13:35] tied you up with some kind of a cancer
[1:13:38] on you
[1:13:39] he may have tied you up with many a
[1:13:41] habit
[1:13:42] but christ the good man has stood in
[1:13:46] your place at the judgment and now has
[1:13:49] set you free to amen god bless your
[1:13:52] heart rise up in the power of the holy
[1:13:55] ghost let's go south let's go south but
[1:13:59] let's not just go south
[1:14:02] let's go towards glory
[1:14:05] marching as a great army of the living
[1:14:07] god because you are free do you hear the
[1:14:11] others telling you come on let's go
[1:14:13] together i was once bound by a chain of
[1:14:17] sin
[1:14:18] but tonight i am cutting loose of that
[1:14:21] chain and i am free in the name of jesus
[1:14:24] christ can you say amen can you say
[1:14:26] glory can you say amen
[1:14:30] hallelujah i'm cutting loose
[1:14:33] praise god
[1:14:34] cutting loose in church
[1:14:36] yeah you need to cut loose
[1:14:39] praise god and give glory praise and
[1:14:42] honor to god
[1:14:44] who has set us free by the power of his
[1:14:47] word amen hallelujah i'm so thankful to
[1:14:51] god here oh my how wonderful i'm
[1:14:54] thinking my friends how many people are
[1:14:57] chained in the church by
[1:15:00] traditions
[1:15:01] how they're chained by the chains of
[1:15:03] darkness of organization
[1:15:07] but i'm thinking that god also has his
[1:15:11] prisoners of the chain to him and one of
[1:15:13] them as you know is a prisoner called
[1:15:15] paul
[1:15:17] and in that wonderful message
[1:15:21] speaking of this natural prisoner who
[1:15:25] japan was first a natural prisoner in
[1:15:28] caesar's prison because i've been there
[1:15:34] into rome and actually was in the prison
[1:15:38] where he was kept and i can tell you
[1:15:40] it's cold
[1:15:42] and damp
[1:15:43] it is very damp
[1:15:45] and that's the place that he was that's
[1:15:47] why he was no doubt calling for his
[1:15:49] cloak
[1:15:50] if you can just bring my cloak because
[1:15:52] it's cold and damp i went there in the
[1:15:55] summer and when you go down in there it
[1:15:58] still is cold and damp right and so he
[1:16:03] was enslaved in caesar's prison very
[1:16:06] symbolic of the devil putting people in
[1:16:09] a dungeon of sin and imprisoned them
[1:16:13] there but spiritually
[1:16:16] he was really chained by the holy spirit
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:20] oh praise god he was chained by the
[1:16:24] great holy spirit of the living god
[1:16:28] my listen brother branham speaking here
[1:16:31] now
[1:16:32] we understand that paul could not do
[1:16:36] whatever he wanted to do
[1:16:39] because
[1:16:41] you see the spirit forbade him
[1:16:44] you remember many times paul tried to go
[1:16:47] someplace
[1:16:48] amen
[1:16:49] to get a great big meeting but the
[1:16:52] spirit
[1:16:53] forbade him
[1:16:55] it proves and clearly states
[1:16:58] that paul was a prisoner
[1:17:01] a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:17:04] harnessed
[1:17:06] to his word
[1:17:08] by the spirit of almighty god
[1:17:13] and we
[1:17:15] who are born slaves to jesus christ
[1:17:18] we also
[1:17:20] are slaves of the joy of jesus christ
[1:17:24] hallelujah i can't do without that joy
[1:17:27] of my salvation i'm a slave to that joy
[1:17:31] i'm so glad
[1:17:33] that i got
[1:17:35] shackles on me
[1:17:37] i got
[1:17:38] his chains on me
[1:17:40] for he has chained me away from the
[1:17:43] things of the world
[1:17:45] that i could become a slave to him jesus
[1:17:49] christ to serve him in love
[1:17:52] glory to god i my brethren brothers and
[1:17:56] sisters who are of light precious faith
[1:17:58] who have been born again by the holy
[1:18:01] ghost and that's had the blood of christ
[1:18:04] sanctify and cleanse you from the
[1:18:06] filthiness of the world to die daily to
[1:18:10] yourself crucifying yourself putting it
[1:18:13] away and becoming a slave
[1:18:16] a slave to serve god because we are here
[1:18:20] looking for a city to come from god out
[1:18:25] of heaven oh blessed be the name of our
[1:18:28] living god hallelujah amen aren't you
[1:18:31] glad that we serve a god like that
[1:18:33] brother sister
[1:18:35] amen that's the kind of god that we
[1:18:38] serve and we give him all the glory and
[1:18:42] the praise and the honor forever and
[1:18:45] forever praise god
[1:18:47] oh my
[1:18:49] god setting us free in every way that we
[1:18:53] might worship him that we might be
[1:18:55] prisoners of him
[1:18:57] and yet there are people out there that
[1:19:00] will
[1:19:01] get the pardon
[1:19:03] get the freedom
[1:19:05] get the offer to open your eyes to put
[1:19:09] eyes off to be able to see
[1:19:11] and they refuse the pardon
[1:19:14] they refuse the iso they refuse to help
[1:19:18] oh my
[1:19:19] and he tells the story of this mother
[1:19:23] this mother's boy had killed a man
[1:19:26] he was laying there ready to die
[1:19:29] and the little mother stood there by the
[1:19:32] governor's door
[1:19:34] and wouldn't move and they asked her in
[1:19:38] finally one of the guards said governor
[1:19:40] that mother of that boy is still out
[1:19:42] there
[1:19:43] and she wants to see you
[1:19:46] and when they opened the door
[1:19:49] they said to her madam the governor will
[1:19:51] receive you
[1:19:52] that poor little lady crawled on her
[1:19:55] hands and knees up to his feet laid her
[1:19:58] hands on his feet and said governor
[1:20:00] honorable sir
[1:20:02] your only man left that can spare my son
[1:20:06] please kind sir
[1:20:08] i know
[1:20:09] he is guilty
[1:20:12] your courts of justice have found him
[1:20:15] guilty
[1:20:16] he actually did
[1:20:18] kill that man
[1:20:20] and i know he is subject to death and
[1:20:23] that he deserves death amen if that is
[1:20:27] speaking of every single one of us here
[1:20:29] with our sins and the burdens that we
[1:20:31] carry i don't know
[1:20:33] but sir
[1:20:35] as a man you have no right to take the
[1:20:38] life of my boy for only god can give
[1:20:40] life and only god can take
[1:20:43] life see
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:46] yes sir and only god can take life up
[1:20:51] like that see
[1:20:54] don't do it sir please don't i beg of
[1:20:56] you
[1:20:57] as the heart of a mother could bear and
[1:21:00] so
[1:21:01] he sent her away
[1:21:03] it broke the governor's heart
[1:21:06] so much pleading by that mother
[1:21:09] so he went down to the jail
[1:21:11] down to the prison are you following me
[1:21:15] where the boy was sitting in his cell in
[1:21:18] the prison
[1:21:20] and of course sitting in the prison
[1:21:23] that man that boy had built up a complex
[1:21:28] see
[1:21:29] you know what complex that is the whole
[1:21:30] world against you
[1:21:33] everything is against you

[1:21:37] like that the world is against them just
[1:21:39] about like the church has done today got
[1:21:42] a complex you either preach it this way
[1:21:45] and then i like it if you don't preach

[1:21:59] had come to him and tried to talk to him
[1:22:02] he had built himself up till he wasn't
[1:22:04] going to hear no more

[1:23:33] if you don't get out of this cell now he
[1:23:35] said i am going to throw you out
[1:23:39] around

[1:24:01] stopped him and stepped out and said oh
[1:24:03] governor did you do him any good
[1:24:07] and he said no sir he wouldn't even
[1:24:10] listen to me
[1:24:12] and the boy overheard he jumped and he
[1:24:15] grabbed the
[1:24:16] bars of the cell and he said who was
[1:24:19] that who did you say that was
[1:24:22] who do you say that was
[1:24:24] and the guard said that was the governor

[1:30:27] and deceive the nations no more
[1:30:30] and a thousand years millennium reign

[1:31:00] they're chained on the chains of
[1:31:01] darkness
[1:31:03] the chains
[1:31:05] not in this
[1:31:06] cemetery

[1:31:33] that would who was god placed him as a
[1:31:36] judge to bring them revival they chained
[1:31:39] it up
[1:31:41] they bound it
[1:31:43] unlike today they bound the holy spirit
[1:31:46] within the churches the true holy spirit
[1:31:49] not this fizzy fizzy uh
[1:31:53] you know bubble over the beer kind of
[1:31:55] holy spirit they're talking about just

[1:32:07] spirit of god doing a deep work within
[1:32:09] the hearts and lives of his people amen
[1:32:12] you can't get that away from you amen
[1:32:16] listen
[1:32:17] from deceived church by the world
[1:32:20] while samson was bound
[1:32:23] we cannot have a revival while he is
[1:32:26] bound amen of course you know who what
[1:32:28] he's referring to there
[1:32:31] listen
[1:32:33] our loyal brother billy graham is out
[1:32:36] there screaming revival in our day all
[1:32:40] roberts out there screaming revival in
[1:32:43] our day
[1:32:44] the all the rest of them screaming out
[1:32:47] revival in our day
[1:32:49] how can we have a revival
[1:32:52] when you're bound
[1:32:55] in denomination
[1:32:57] bound in
[1:32:59] traditions
[1:33:00] bound
[1:33:01] in culture bound in false doctrine
[1:33:05] and you're covered
[1:33:07] in clouds of darkness i wouldn't even
[1:33:10] look for that quotation here where
[1:33:12] brother branham says don't you know the
[1:33:14] church is bound on the clouds of
[1:33:17] darkness he says clouds of darkness he
[1:33:20] said it's the teachers
[1:33:23] they're spreading lies clouds of lies in
[1:33:27] the minds and hearts of the people false
[1:33:30] doctrine contrary to the word of the
[1:33:32] living god
[1:33:34] he said satan got them out there he says
[1:33:37] handsome slickers
[1:33:39] he said get up in that pulpit my friends
[1:33:42] he said and they'll tell every lie every
[1:33:46] false doctrine as long as you will
[1:33:48] subscribe to whatever they are doing and
[1:33:51] take you away from the word of god back
[1:33:54] to the word of god hallelujah amen yes
[1:33:57] sir you're bound by the holy spirit your
[1:34:01] organizations your traditions you can't
[1:34:03] have a holy ghost revival how are you
[1:34:06] gonna have it amen because i know that
[1:34:09] that is scorching hot amen my god but
[1:34:12] it's the truth
[1:34:15] amen how can we have that holy ghost
[1:34:18] revival when you are so bound up and
[1:34:21] starchy how are you gonna have it having
[1:34:24] forms of godliness you will oh and
[1:34:26] denying the power of god the power of
[1:34:29] god you're not denying power of
[1:34:31] organization you're not denying the
[1:34:33] power of the world but they are the
[1:34:35] power of the church but you are denying
[1:34:38] the power of the holy ghost
[1:34:40] in the midst of the church that's the
[1:34:42] secret place when the church begins to
[1:34:45] adopt educated preachers
[1:34:48] begin to
[1:34:49] bow down to big buildings and finally
[1:34:53] instead of the old-fashioned holy coast
[1:34:56] they'd better be in that old mission
[1:34:58] again on the corner amen are you going
[1:35:01] to have a revival of the holy ghost
[1:35:03] people quench it and bound it and are
[1:35:07] afraid of it i think i have a note here
[1:35:11] i think it's kings
[1:35:14] 19 somewhere there tells the
[1:35:16] 16 to 19 tells the life story of samson
[1:35:19] and how
[1:35:20] he came
[1:35:22] as a call by a boy to be a nazirite a
[1:35:26] man and how later on
[1:35:28] he was
[1:35:29] chained as you know
[1:35:31] in the temple
[1:35:33] she tied him with ropes and twigs but
[1:35:35] when he got in the temple there they
[1:35:37] chained him up and all these dwarfs and
[1:35:40] little boys sticking him and pricking
[1:35:41] him and they brought him back in the
[1:35:43] temple amen but there he was standing
[1:35:47] there
[1:35:48] and you know
[1:35:49] you've seen it dramatized how he asked
[1:35:52] place my hands on the pillars
[1:35:54] the pillars of the doctrine
[1:35:56] show me the the foundations of the
[1:35:58] church
[1:35:59] all the pillar doctrines and the trinity
[1:36:01] is the pillar that they're all sitting
[1:36:03] on amen
[1:36:05] that's what they're sitting on he says
[1:36:06] just put my hands on it amen
[1:36:09] and the bible they snap off those chains
[1:36:12] he said brother brown said they forgot
[1:36:15] that while they had him chained up
[1:36:18] that his hair was growing back on his
[1:36:20] head
[1:36:21] he said seven locks amen seven ages
[1:36:26] seven laps the word being restored when
[1:36:29] those locks come back he snapped the
[1:36:31] chains and pushed down the pillars glory
[1:36:34] of god hallelujah and revival struck the
[1:36:37] land israel got hope because when the
[1:36:40] philistines got killed and destroyed the
[1:36:43] children of israel are able to rise up
[1:36:46] and take over take their position and
[1:36:48] their places as the people and the churn
[1:36:51] of god they freed themselves from the
[1:36:53] chains of darkness helplessness
[1:36:55] hopelessness and everything else my
[1:36:57] friends don't be hopeless
[1:37:00] don't feel helpless
[1:37:01] don't feel that all your hopes are lost
[1:37:04] don't give up but put your faith in
[1:37:06] jesus christ
[1:37:08] this message
[1:37:10] you might have been discouraged
[1:37:12] because a lot of ministers even of this
[1:37:14] message
[1:37:15] going off into all manner of fantastics
[1:37:18] all manner of psychology
[1:37:21] all manner of things but whole to god's
[1:37:24] unchanging word
[1:37:25] hold to his hand amen
[1:37:28] oh my the word is unchanging and it's
[1:37:31] unfolding it's like a roman candle it
[1:37:34] bursts goes to a higher level birth goes
[1:37:38] to a higher level birth goes to a higher
[1:37:40] level that's god's great fireworks going
[1:37:43] on right now stand to your feet while
[1:37:46] the musicians come let's give praise and
[1:37:48] honor and glory to god forevermore
[1:37:51] because he has broke the chains of
[1:37:53] darkness from off of me and i trust he
[1:37:56] broke the chains of darkness from off of
[1:37:59] you or for your mind over your life on
[1:38:01] off of your heart come to the light and
[1:38:04] christ will give you life praise god may
[1:38:08] you might not have heard it on this
[1:38:10] fashion
[1:38:12] you might want a real scholarly
[1:38:15] well
[1:38:16] a presented
[1:38:18] intelligent
[1:38:19] uh presentation
[1:38:22] and stuff like that but let me tell you
[1:38:25] god doesn't have it that way
[1:38:27] that kind of chocolatey gentle jesus
[1:38:30] image that they painted for you
[1:38:33] before you is a false image of the real
[1:38:36] christ he was rough he was rugged he was
[1:38:40] to the point amen
[1:38:42] hallelujah mighty god brother sister i'm
[1:38:46] thank god i'm free
[1:38:48] hallelujah i am free
[1:38:54] i don't have to worry about the thing
[1:38:56] because i put everything in his hands
[1:38:59] i placed my life in his hands
[1:39:02] all my needs
[1:39:04] is in his hands
[1:39:06] my health is in his hands you think i'm
[1:39:08] going to be more careful over my health
[1:39:11] than he is
[1:39:12] i put it in his hands and i rest at that
[1:39:14] amen
[1:39:15] oh my everything is in his hands all my
[1:39:18] needs amen you embrace god i mean you
[1:39:21] see i line up all my bills and i add up
[1:39:24] and when i look at the number
[1:39:27] i said father
[1:39:29] you're going to have to take care of
[1:39:30] this
[1:39:32] amen
[1:39:33] oh my but lord i can
[1:39:36] because with god's help i can and i will
[1:39:41] with god's help amen we will overcome no
[1:39:44] matter what the devil does to you amen
[1:39:47] you can be looking at everything else
[1:39:49] but god has given an order
[1:39:52] and the devil can only attempt to untest
[1:39:54] you for so much
[1:39:56] you think it's going to break you but it
[1:39:57] won't break you it's really making you
[1:40:01] it's really building you up
[1:40:03] it's not going to destroy you it's going
[1:40:05] to work together for your good
[1:40:07] it's going to build you up in the grace
[1:40:08] of god
[1:40:09] because even the sea he said i set a
[1:40:12] boundary for the sea
[1:40:15] it can't go further
[1:40:16] and when it goes to that point it has to
[1:40:18] go back
[1:40:19] and when your troubles come it can only
[1:40:22] come so much so much you feel like i'm
[1:40:24] dead i can't make it but god knows he
[1:40:27] said how much you can be tempted how
[1:40:29] much you can bear how much you can take
[1:40:31] and that's the way when you lift weights
[1:40:33] you strengthen your muscles when you
[1:40:35] feel it burning and you think you can
[1:40:37] lift it one more time and you hold on
[1:40:39] that's when the muscles start to build
[1:40:41] amen praise god so god is building you
[1:40:44] up in your most precious faith
[1:40:47] strengthening you to meet the challenge
[1:40:49] of this hour
[1:40:52] we got to meet more devils and demons
[1:40:54] than they ever did before
[1:40:56] and god wants his people to be
[1:40:58] pressurized for the journey
[1:41:00] ready my friends for the great flight
[1:41:02] amen not the flight from that thing over
[1:41:05] there in florida which they're doing a
[1:41:07] great job by science but the real thing
[1:41:10] when the spiritual astronauts sons and
[1:41:12] daughters of god will take their flight
[1:41:14] like mighty eagles oh praise god on the
[1:41:18] inspiration of the holy spirit of the
[1:41:20] living god we're going out to here
