giving glory and honor to god we pray that the lord bless us this today amen god heavenly father we commit to you your people into your hands i pray you'll bless us today in every way in jesus name amen uh please be seated i'd like to note here the passing or the crossing over of one of my oldest converts since i was just a teenager and preached the word of god brother smith his name is smith and he was one who held to the word from those times until today he passed on i believe friday morning at 96 years of age trusting the lord and believing every step of the way trials on every hand he was a tailor and did a lot of his training overseas and went back there and set up his his shop not really a shop he had a building and everything else like that with equipment and other tailors working under him he had an establishment and he was that kind of a person but nevertheless here comes a young boy preaching the word and it caught the seed caught in his heart and he believed and held to god's unchanging hand never mind whatever happened he was a real true believer and anybody will testify to that brother aubry and those brothers were just young kids when he came in right and they grew up and he was still there and they come overseas he's still there pressing on but now the lord has seen it fit to promote him higher and to god we give the glory and i would like to acknowledge that his faith and trust in god and in the word that he received it led him safe until this hour he didn't have to wander in his crossing if he had to cross alone or if he's going to the right place or whatever the lord took him and now i believe he is happy in the presence of the lord and back to age 2021 in the fullness of his strength amen we thank god for that amen we're going to have uh the baptism of grace bobby frimpong brother phillips daughter um last sunday god has been speaking to her heart but last sunday seemed to have brought it to the more to four and so she's asked told her father of course he was surprised that she wants to be baptized in water in the name of the lord jesus christ so we thank god [Applause] and as it is fitting brother uh danny will do the baptism praise the lord after which we do have a certificate here that will be presented to the dear young lady may god bless her heart in her journey as she in her walk with god as she walks with him through the pair these perilous times of life that we're living in amen i want to ask you also to pray for our dear brother um michael eastman and his wife they left and are in panama right now and of course the hurricane is hitting their place up there his daughter is there but let's pray for their safety because they were flooded out completely the last time with the wind and the rain said cars were just floating down the street so we just got to believe and trust god that god will take care of all his affairs amen praise the lord at the end of the service i have a meeting with the deacons to talk about the church and we'll get back to you on that praise the lord and we will report to you after our meeting possibly next sunday or maybe even before not maybe before you'll have it online and we'll let you know the results of that praise the lord well today by the grace of god all week it just wouldn't leave my thoughts because we have spoken before on this marvelous and wonderful subject of we are not of the church ages amen do you believe that well that kind of what's on my thoughts and everything else and i want to approach the subject for coming from another a place and plainly say that i am speaking on the eternal church age not that there could be uh well later on you'll understand why i'm saying that but uh let me read the scripture let us read the scriptures together uh psalm 118 verses 19 to 24. i i'm fine once i have gotten started i just need to keep in the flow of the spirit i don't need a water or bread or meat or anything while i'm ministering the word of the living god hallelujah i don't want to break that uh rhythm of the spirit of the living god okay psalms uh a hundred and eighteen reading from verses 19 to 24 let us read together open to me the gates of righteousness i will go into them and i will praise the lord the gate of the lord into which the righteous shall enter don't forget jesus said i am the way amen i will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation you walk in those gates and you are saved by his grace amen this stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner this is the lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it praise the lord may the lord richly bless us all heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the holy scriptures and now as we come before thee may the spirit of the living god make the word come alive quicken the word father by the great fire of the holy spirit that we might reflect you and give you glory honor and praise god bless you please be seated brethren hallelujah glory to god amen now we just some time ago i uh not some time ago a long time ago as a young man i i was reading the some of the sermons and writings of great preachers of the past and among them was one called joseph parker who preached on the subject of the stone the builders rejected the rejected stone and he was saying do you notice the stone that the builders he said first of all this wasn't just a brick that's man-made this was a stone and so it was god that created that stone and now he said the next thing you notice those were not just ordinary people these were builders he said today we'll call them theologians experts experts in the scriptures experts in the bible but they refused the cornerstone that god had made amen but the bible tells us that the cornerstone has become they had stone and we want to thank god for that that that cornerstone has now become the headstone praise the lord i'm just getting myself organized here mentally and in every way praise the lord now we realize brethren that when you are building a building or building a house the house has corners and each corner actually points two ways it's leaving one age and going into another but it's a corner stone right or praise god i'm so glad to have contact with the cornerstone now we understand that also from a various uh quotes and sayings of the prophet that the cornerstone instead of just being a cornerstone through the ages just turning the corner through the ages after all the ages have come and passed you don't need a cornerstone anymore and that cornerstone moves to its position of being the headstone it moves to the head and it sits there because the same cornerstone is the headstone that it just changes the position or changes the age in which you are living in after that corner has been turned we want to thank the lord for the recognizing that in our day now when brother branham was teaching on this topic or subject of the cornerstone he immediately introduced the pyramid he introduced the teaching on the stature of a perfect man and in actual fact he was portraying the pyramid as a building being builded and these stones all being built up into a spiritual house in actual fact i have a where he says here in the leadership book we are you're building a wall but that's only one straight way and that's all fine see they're going a row but when you have to turn the corner that's where realize that's when you've come now to the whole building you realize you're not just building wall you're building a house that wall has to fit into a house so in actual fact you're building a house and the house has walls and the walls have corners so don't just take the age like that it fits somewhere else so that something else could fit again because you are building a complete house amen just like when we come to luther then wesley and pentecost but it is here again praise god they turn the corner luther wesley pentecost he said but it's here again there's another corner to be turned again praise god hallelujah oh praise god listen we have turned the corner and now where are we we're looking towards heaven we're watching for him to come it's the coming it's the cap on the pyramid amen you see he become the what the capstone right because that's the headstone that was the same cornerstone now become the capping stone hallelujah oh my see so he's back praise god the cap on the pyramid praise the lord jesus we thank god for that hallelujah that we have come through the seven church ages how many knows that lord of god hallelujah but there were ages remember that there were ages i believe somewhere here i made a note here that the word ages comes from the greek word a on a i o n right which is ages which is a a certain period of time that god designate to deal with human beings over a certain matter or thing that he has in his own thoughts it's just a time so the church changes are of the time element and god dealing with his people in that time element over a period of time praise god hallelujah so we find friends that they church this pyramid that the prophet is talking about he called it stature of a perfect man now by now you would have grown a maturity enough to realize that pyramid does not just represent uh as many preachers of the past uh preached it that it's you that has to become perfect and you got to build up these pyramids into yourself he was actually talking of the building materials of the church ages for these churches each represented a virtue or a part of the building materials that god the great workman was building his own house to dwell in and the pyramid represented the stature of the perfect man christ jesus hallelujah of course it also represents us but the emphasis was not on us it was him that was that we are looking at there amen being built up a spiritual house through seven church ages praise the lord so we give god the glory and thanks for that uh him building that way praise god now that's going to take me back to the statue of a perfect man to this wonderful quote that i love so much praise the lord hallelujah because he taught it and we believe it here in the word of god hallelujah well let me nail this down each one of those virtues actually represented a church age the people of that church age were going to manifest that particular virtue hallelujah okay jesus christ himself all those virtues are in him so if he comes into you it's not you going to fight to put these virtues on because he is in you with all those virtues so you are saved by his salvation you are perfect with his perfection for he in you makes you perfect and now we realize from the teaching you have been receiving and from the word that is not perfecting your flesh it's perfecting your manifestation of that gene seed through your flesh right you have it's like a baby trying to walk and the word tells you what you have to do but reading it hearing it and doing it is another matter you can say walk baby walk walk the child is still going to walk and fall and stumble and bruise their knees and everything else but that's only part of the process of walking so we have to deal with it from that point of view praise god so then brother sister we see in the scriptures luke uh chapter 20 verses 9 to 16 the story is told of the man who rich man who had a vineyard and he sent out his servants one at a time right you already know that types the messengers one at a time coming out and when they come out uh there these people or what men refused them rejected them and beat them from receiving the lord's words his orders his will of what he wanted done amen praise god so we watch the church ages and we see luther wesley we come on down to pentecost and god sent a great sweep in revival hallelujah and in that revival there were great men that god used men like a.a allen jack cole ff bosworth velma gardner gordon lindsay many many others who whose names you don't need to know but there were a miracle men like a dime a dozen all around the country not now you get one put on a white suit and gets up and thousands of people come to this was everywhere it was everywhere amen i've seen in my own country there as a boy one of those ordinary the missionaries come to teach him the bible and the word and the man stood up there in the headquarters and started to preach the word the building shook the power of god struck the place missionaries were on the stomach they were screaming and crying out to god demons were coming out amen everything was going on while he was preaching the word amen it was the spirit of pentecost the real pentecost that had struck the world i came in at the ending part of it brother sister watching them and saying so-and-so is coming this sunday you know don't bother that person is going to br they never seen the person in their life and they turn up and the pastor just gladly welcomed them to the pulpit because god himself said them and they know before he got there that he was coming because somebody that was in prayer and fasting caught a revelation amen hallelujah so the power of god was sweeping the country sweeping the entire world hallelujah amen and i want you to see here that brother branham himself or roberts all these brothers that came along hallelujah amen but brother branham my brother sister being amongst them he was yous of god and you know he was the messenger to the obedient church age but go back just to briefly mention to you the use of a cornerstone it don't only you know turn the corner it points to the new corner that's coming and then it points back to the corner it just turned right so so the prophet's ministry there's quotations to prove that is twofold right he was not just the taking the messenger to the church age but he turns around and he points behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world he's coming amen oh praise god hallelujah goes up to sunset mountain and there he is praise god welcoming the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 who comes to bring the opening of the word for once the book was closed and only one opened the book the lamb opened the book but when the angel came the bible said he's descended to the earth with the book open within his hand hallelujah revealed it to revelation 10 7 and said time shall be no more we thought we used to think in the early part of the message the end of the world but no he was just saying that your changes are over i'm stepping on the scene now i'm taking over you don't need no messenger i am the church age messenger i am the one that sent them hallelujah the boss himself has come glory to god we thank god for the boss hallelujah that he's come up on the scene amen praise god yes sir i tell you that this is the truth out of the word of god now the church age brother branham came in was what brotherly kindness that was the church age that he came in the church age of lodesia of brotherly kindness and then the next stage is love praise god hallelujah now let's go to statue of a perfect man now we are approaching the seven seals we've just finished the seven church ages now you got to remember the seals weren't preached yet he's telling you we are now approaching this approaching the seven seals amen right praise god he is announcing that he's turned the corner the seventh sea the seventh church ages are now over and the church is moving on spiritually to something else that's not me saying it praise god i'm prepared to be misunderstood by preaching this like that plain and open that there is another age beyond the seven church ages and that's not a regular church age as we call it because it's not one that's built in time but it's one that i i'm preaching on today that eternal church age listen praise god we have just finished the seven church ages and this is talking about him preaching stature of a perfect man is a message on the teaching that ties the man in hallelujah is turning now the men and women elected from the seven church ages this teaching of the statue of a perfect man understanding and the revelation of the pyramid ties them man in that's going to be redeemed hallelujah by the blood of the lord jesus hallelujah praise god amen we know the token itself that is the blood the holy spirit is the blood of the lord jesus listen i know when i start preaching something like this people misunderstand what's he talking about that uh what's he thinking who does he think he is what is this all about it's nothing to do with me and even if you don't understand the holy spirit will cause you to understand if you are one of his own this is a message on the teaching that ties the man in that's going to be redeemed by the blood of the lord jesus and is going to be in the church age that eternal church age at the end of the seals hallelujah i think you can find that page six uh statue of a perfect man if it's a reprint book it might be around page 200 uh but you'll find that you just go look on it you're gonna find it that's not me saying that that's brother branham saying that amen thus set the lord behind it that eternal church age at the end of the seals hallelujah now he's talking about this before he even opened the city the seals were even open or before he himself had a revelation of those seals amen praise the lord hallelujah but he knew that at the end of the seals there was going to be an eternal age he called it church age so we can understand because church age is in time element but the moment you put eternal on that it's actually not a age as we human beings uh you know will think of it this one now is timeless this one is eternal and we are moving from time and breaking back into eternity by the revelation of the word of god amen hallelujah they praise god oh my yes sir so here we are we're back brought back coming from remember teaching on the genes and the germs of of god we are not of time we you the inside man you're not from time we are just sent there just like jesus was he didn't come from mary mary didn't produce him he was just designated by god to pass through mary hallelujah and god designated to us everything a time and season god designates us to come up in the seventh church age physically and pass through it but we are not from it we were allowed to pass through it but we are not from it the word of god is our origin we come from eternity and we pass through time to go back to the eternal back again to the glory of god hallelujah amen praise god i'm talking about what the eter that eternal church age and i'm deliberately using the specific words that brother branham himself used so that you can't say i made up something it's right there and he said it amen praise god now you know by now i'm not here preaching to make believers i'm not preaching to great pretenders i'm not preaching to slip and slide duck and hide i'm preaching to real believers i'm preaching to the bride the genuine elect of god hallelujah amen praise god amen yes sir my only interest here is to edify the body of jesus christ esther build up the body of jesus christ look everybody likes to be prosperous everybody likes to be blessed but i will tell you from the beginning the calling of god money was never my problem to be worrying about money and trying to fight and work and try to amass wealth and that's good if god gave you that kind of a gift and he wants to bless you that way wonderful i said wonderful praise god so i'm all for that but i want you to know i got no other motives but to ratify the body and build up the body of jesus christ hallelujah if you turn uh tomorrow like demons against paul or one of those others it doesn't matter hallelujah i'll be concerned for your soul but really friends i am pressing on the upward way you hide some gaining every day hallelujah pressing on in the name of the lord amen praise god glory to god could you well you don't have that here but the seven seals page 124 to page 128 saying it so it will go out and you can check that afterwards now we know the book is a revelation hallelujah and a revelation is something that has to be made known amen it's closed up until the latter times the whole mystery of god has been closed up until the latter time hallelujah or praise god but he put it out like in a actor's form he means like a drama amen yes see and he he speaks it as it were in parables amen and he'll speak of it in the form like a beast here or a beast there he'll he'll he'll portray it as an animal right like that and so forth but he's doing it in an act or in a drama see oh my think of it and these ones they all began back in the first church age because all these ages it's christ revealing himself to the seven church ages amen remember that it's christ but at the end of the church age the seventh angel's message picks it up picks up all the lost mysteries and gives it back to the church amen not then revealed in their true state he gives back the revelation of what was lost in the past and he leaves it but listen what he says but it is not then revealed in their true state you can go back read it study it for yourself in the seven seals where he spoke of this amen see that's the way it was because these mysteries were back there even in the bible times right they were there and they're seeing these things happen but they're seeing it the same way john seen it in other words they've seen it in types and symbols the the mystery was not veiled to them but there's a people that god is going to unveil it and it says those people are going to be especially in the latter times that they're going to have a clear understanding of what it was all about amen because a revelation is a mystery mysterious secret that was once hidden but now mad plain hallelujah brother ben said he spoke it he delivered it but it's all brought forth but not yet in its true state hallelujah what's it going to take to put it in its true state the holy spirit hallelujah amen see my friends the mystery comes but then what they don't know they didn't know but it's to be revealed it's to be made known hallelujah praise god glory to god they presume that it hallelujah because they saw symbols of it and so they presumed that what that meant oh my see but they did not understand glory to god hallelujah and it's the same way with the seven thunders they didn't know what the thunders were saved they knew there were seven thunders they could say seven thunders they could say all the seven thunders this and the sevens understand but that did not know what the seven thunders were saying they didn't know what it is hallelujah they presumed at what the thunders was saying was it saying virtues was it saying this was it saying that was the same power was it telling you about power coming later on were you going to speak on arms was it saying that they did not understand we're not saying that they were wrong or or something like that what we're saying is that they misunderstood and it was not the time for it to make itself known you he said here remember the voices of those thunders john was forbidden to write amen he could not write the full truth he could not write the full truth later on he's going to tell us why he couldn't write the full truth amen right but here it is because john himself did not get the full revelation of the seals he didn't get a full revelation he was seeing the forms and the symbols and everything else but he didn't get a full revelation of what the seals were hallelujah because the seal broke amen and when the seal broke it thundered in other words a voice spoke amen whose voice the voice of the mighty angel amen but the bible tells you when he comes down and he spoke his voice was seven thunders blasting out amen and the thunder and lightning when he spoke the word of god it was the voice of the mighty angels hallelujah speaking out and john didn't get a full revelation he could only hear the voice saying come and see he couldn't come and understand what john come and see hallelujah and so john would then go and look hallelujah but when he looked all he could see was a symbol he couldn't see the full revelation of it he could see a white horse riding out with a with a with a bar without a ball and then he has to presume of what that really meant but he did not get the full revelation of it and as i've preached before so through the ages many have presumed through them seven church ages presuming at the truth of what the truth of the word was i remember reading writings dr uriah smith reading from the so-called prophetess of the adventists ellen g white reading the writings of charles russell of the jehovah witnesses and even reading writings of joseph smith the founder of the mormons now i want you to understand all these people had good intent they had good intentions they were trying to accomplish something for god what they presumed on the world and their presumptions were wrong it was com completely out of the walk of god i don't mean everything that said was wrong but the direction in which they're going they were out of whack with the word of god because you if you ever did you don't need to do it but if you ever did you'll find that they they have a little truth there truth their truth their truth there amen because god led me a certain way from my youth god allowed me to be friends with the adventist friends with the motherless friends within nazarene friends with the pilgrimage as friends with the breadwinner and when they have revivals i will go into their churches and even now some of my friends are now way up almost head of the adventist church and so on in different places and the thing about it is back then we didn't fight i go to the adventist church they know what i believe and i'm listening to their preaching on prophecy they come and they listen to what i'm preaching uh go over to the baptist there that's another one there the young man is now head of the baptist organization then and my friends we were listening because we all wanted the word but everyone has to find their position and god positioned me to follow this word and this message of this hour because i come through pentecost i've seen the power of god in the lives of others and others have seen the power of god walking through this life hallelujah oh my from from teenage right to this hour the power and the presence of almighty god hallelujah amen you say you're talking about it now yeah we're in the word form of the manifestation of the word we don't have to go producing miracles to to to show you we are in the world that's not where it's at now them things are good but that's not where it is at now it's the word coming out of you by revelation that identifies you who you are and where you come from amen praise god so they were presuming all these marvelous wonderful people brother branham talked of some of them clarence larkin amen great outlines on the dispensation of ages and things like that but there weren't exactly right it took a profit to go back and even read the writings of some of these people and then he will see the full truth of it and then he will outline that uh just this week i was reading somebody trying to accuse the prophet of copying uh clarence lock in but they don't understand that he had to gather up the lost things and from the lost things like like i've tried to tell a lot of people you think that brother branham sat in the room and all the revelations just came to him like that some came that way but other things the angel would tell him go and look here go over there turn to this scripture and look there go read over there and then he would sit in the room and then all them things will come together and the full truth will flow right out from it amen praise god so i want you to understand that praise god of what god did and hear my friends that they were presuming amen hallelujah excuse me continuing but that mystery now what it was they did not know see because it was to be revealed hallelujah oh praise god the lamb had to reveal it after he leaves that time of intercessory back there because he knew there were names on that book hallelujah and names in there that were on there from before the foundation of the world hallelujah praise god men of all ages have paid a great price pay the great price just to know if the name was on that book but none of the rest of them knew i'm thinking of charles wesley the brother of uh john wesley and you know the one was inspired to preach and the other one was anointed and inspired to write hymns and songs and to play musical instruments and he is the one that wrote the great hymn is my name written there on the page white and fair in the book of thy kingdom is my name written there see they weren't certain of their name being on the book but what a difference to you to whom the word of god is revealed and it's being revealed that you can recognize this and you with the in the words of the prophet become certain of god amen you're recognized and you're certain of god hallelujah praise god oh my whether it's brother philip over here what is brother bill whether it's brother brad over there it doesn't matter what's going on in your life these problems different things comes brother bill different things come to you brother hallelujah god bless you but let me tell you it is god who looks at the man on the inside hallelujah and says your name is on that book [Applause] hallelujah praise god you see i i've thought on that before it's not just your condition that you're presently in people are judging people by the condition that they're presently in right oh he's drinking oh he's smoking oh he's lying he's that that may be so but it is not your condition on which your salvation is based it is your position right this is what jesus meant when he said he says yes a servant i can fire and i can drive out of the house forever for doing something wrong but a son he abideth in the house forever amen there's a difference between a sinning son and a sinner you got me your son make a mistake it don't matter how much you don't like him you want to put him out you want to do this you want to do you can't change your original he's already a son he's already a daughter you run your child of god in that you can't change you're gonna deal with him you're gonna work it out you're gonna do what you have to do but he and she is still a son and a daughter of the living god your position doesn't change your conditions may change with time and problems and trials temptations this that in your life but your position hallelujah of who you are remains forever because you come from eternity and you're going back to eternity and god said i'm not gonna lose one that's in the palm of my hand your name in the book he's not gonna lose one one of joseph's bones are going out of here [Music] every one of joseph's bones will not be left in this egyptian night but it's going right back to god where it come from glory to god hallelujah amen praise god god bless you all for being here today by the grace of god hallelujah amen john looked and saw that bloody bleeding lamb come through the great battle down in hell hallelujah and come back amen bleeding and dying for us hallelujah amen but my friends those names are all sealed in the book hallelujah john knew names are in the book but he didn't know and they didn't know that for sure that their names were there they believe unto eternal life they believe unto it hallelujah by the grace of god amen yes sir oh my i tell you john screamed hallelujah he just gave out a great scream amen hallelujah because god gave him what a revelation just like you had to have a revelation brother i had to have a revelation you got to have a revelation that your name is on the book amen and john at that point caught the revelation that his name was on that book and that is why john screamed hallelujah amen he knows there were many other names there but he saw his name praise god there's lots of other people's name there but god is not asking about other people is your name written there hallelujah have you caught the revelation that your name is written there within that great lamb's book of life hallelujah oh praise god amen praise god did he see his name written there j o h n no not like that but he saw himself fulfilling the word for his age and by him fulfilling the word for his age it made him know that his name was in that book because he is doing what he is supposed to do not consciously but unconsciously something made him do what he was doing and he was fulfilling the word by revelation hallelujah that's why the devil can't mess with the third poem because it's not my system not by knowledge not by study not my wisdom though those things are wonderful but it's not by that it's by the revelation of god it can be here and anytime you move like lightning it flashes this way that way that way that way it speaks to anyone at any time and it will send the devil crazy because that lightning moving ever what he doesn't know what's going on is god moving by his spirit making the word of god known amen hallelujah we know of course that brother branham didn't break the seals how many knows that let's write in the bible the lamb broke the seal i mean i say it myself but when i say it i know what i'm saying right and when you say it you must know what you are saying because it's the lamb himself broke the seals no man in heaven on earth that search to find a man and no man couldn't break the seal so not even brother branham could break the seals so when those seals were being opened it was what it was christ it was revealing christ hallelujah and brother branham was just used as a humble instrument that god could come and speak his word true for the spirit speaks through the prophet and the holy spirit the great god of heaven was able to find a vessel that he was predestinated for known and placed in this season in time that he could use to make known his word and fulfill the word in revelation 10 7 and malachi 4 5 amen hallelujah praise the name of the lord and in whatever ages these people came up in the elect of that age had to catch a revelation for their age to see that they were fulfilling the word whether it's gesture lived by faith fulfilling the word whether it's holiness fulfilling the word whether it's well you know no real pentecostal is still alive how many knows that no real original pentecostals are still alive these ones are make believe they're having miracle signs wonders that's marvelous but they're not the genuine elected seed of god no those ones are dead they're already dead their age is over and gone with completely amen because on that day of pentecost the apostles screamed because they realized they were fulfilling joel 2 28 they actually realized that they were the fulfillment of the word taking place for their day hallelujah so it's not they have to write read their name on a book but they see their position in christ hallelujah oh my just as we are to see our position right now for his glory that we are not in these church ages hallelujah glory to god though we pass through them but we are not of the church ages glory to god hallelujah amen glory to god hallelujah amen brother sister i'm so thankful in this age that only a rapture people are people predestinated for the rapture are going to recognize their name in the book by the life they live according to this word fulfilling the word for their day and for their hour and the more we look into the word it'll be like the boy that looked into the mirror god's word is a mirror you know that he looked into the mirror and after a while he starts seeing himself my i thought he was only talking about jesus i thought it was only talking about this or that the other then you start seeing it was it is talking about you right it may be also talking about jesus or this one or that one but he's talking about you and then you ain't imagining you literally see yourself positioned in the word hallelujah you see yourself positioned in the word of god hallelujah praise god you know sometimes when i'm preaching like this do you think that i just preaching and that's wonderful victory no the devil constantly coming is it you know are they going to understand are they going to think you're crazy uh yes he's talking all the time while i'm preaching to you and saying and he said where do you get that from what what what are you talking about this and that and the all kinds of stuff it comes bombarding against you while you are trying to bring forth the truth of the word of god but i am certain of what i am seeing and so i'm saying it to you that you might recognize hallelujah praise god what it is that you are getting a hold of amen lord of god you cannot take this rapture with doubt in your heart amen doubt in your heart doubt about the word we're not talking about doubt for the healing on your body or some cold you got or something and say oh grant simon say i doubt the word so i am not going in the rapture no i'm not talking about that i'm talking about doubt on this message of this hour you can't go in the rapture with any doubt within your heart praise god no doubt about it you got to have a full confidence and assurance within your soul no shadow of a doubt that your name is on the lamb's book of life hallelujah praise god amen lord of god i think uh brother sister i believe i'm going to stop here now because i've got a lot more to say and if you don't mind if you will permit me or allow me then i will continue in the next week and allow god to have his way within your heart and life is that okay we have a lot of baptism here also praise god and that will take place now and we want to give god the glory for that glory to his marvelous and wonderful name brother sister i am thanking god beyond any measure that my eyes have been opened the eyes of my heart has been open that i can recognize the word and the day that i'm living in to some people who even follow this message it's just a light thing right they just hear it and well it's religious it's nice makes me a good no it's more than that it's life and when you see it the right way when you see it the way god wants you to see it as like david said it's more than life to me it means natural life it's more than life to me amen because that other life that's eternal this one we have here is only for a period of time and a matter of fact when this one ends you'll break back into the eternal life that god gives us musicians coming uh praise god hallelujah amen yes we're breaking right back into it and we're doing it even now while we are seated here for the bible tells us we are not going to prevent them that are asleep because there are certain people going to be alive at the rapture the prophet is telling us some are not going to be dead but they're going to be alive and while they're alive they shall be changed see simon i'm not feeling that you don't have to feel it he said do you believe it you're being changed praise god matter of fact i don't want to go back in the quotes i got got the quote brother brown said change from glory he said you're being changed from glory on to glory unto glory hallelujah i've said it over and over but he is saying it you'll change by god's power to transform hallelujah in other words it's like me going and looking at brad over here and said let me look at him tonight and see how much he's going to grow is as much as you're going to look at the plant to see how many inches it's going to grow overnight right and look as if the moment you're not like listening look back up the thing gone up three inches when did that grow see god has his own way of doing things and he just said in the word you will be changed from glory on to glory and we are being changed right now a lot of people say oh the rapture on the rapture day all of a sudden you change right then now that is the instant completion of what is already in progression is that right it's already in progression you're being changed the prophet said one place he says he says you're changed aren't you he says your soul changed didn't it your spirit is being renewed amen all you're waiting on now is your body change but the changes the other changes are taking place right now while we are still alive inside this body i'm glad that i'm being changed from glory on to glory praise god brother would you just take it from here until bro he's ready oh praise god hallelujah we'll invite uh brother danny to come then and
