praise god sent you here god bless you god bless all of you thank you so much for your efforts being out here we don't know how long we are going to be able to wash up like this as you watch and hear the news in ontario it seems as if it's rising again and the premier is thinking of possibly he doesn't know when but maybe shutting everything down again so we'll just worship as long as we can amen let us worship god as long as we can praise this wonderful name before i forget let me wish all of you a happy thanksgiving happy thanksgiving i i wanna we want to thank god first of all for the opening of his word we have to thank him amen we want to thank god that we can we have eyes to see and heirs to hear amen are recognized amen what the word is saying that's the thing mainly we ought to thank god for and naturally we thank him for the bread uh the fruit of the earth and of the sea and the animals of the land and the things that we are able to eat to sustain natural life for that we give him thanks and we give him praise for all that is given to us we give him thanks for help and strength and for his divine protection and watching over us every step of the way i'd just like to correct something from last week i said it was sister farida's sister it was not it was brother chris's sister brother chris for long his sister uh patsy passed on to be with the lord she was a great uh worker for the lord a great contributor she gave a lot of the funds and did a lot of the work in erecting intervaled tabernacle in trinidad she was just somebody like that and so we want to thank god for her and her passing our graduation and uh god bless her she fought the fight she finished the course and now she's in the presence of the lord we give him glory and praise and thanks i want to remind you that every friday night at 7 30 there is a prayer meeting how many knows that okay the prayer meeting continues online we have our prayer coordinator here and of course brother bill does the communications here and we want to bring that to your attention so that you will all be in on the prayer meeting yeah whether you are home you're you're out you're somewhere if you have a phone you can phone in with the directions you get from brother bill who will send it out and then you'll be able to be in on the prayer meeting okay praise the lord god bless you good to see you sister again after a while glad you can be in the house of the lord all of you here give him glory and praise amen well i thought i'd bring this message in one week and so far it's going on and i'll just have to follow the holy spirit if you don't mind the end time bride being identified praise the lord hallelujah the end time bride being identified and we find that is found in the book of john chapter 14 verses 19 to 20. i'll read the scripture and then i'll continue on on my speaking on the end time bride being identified i believe this is part three of it and next week no doubt we'll have to continue let us pray father we thank you for the reading of your word we ask your blessing on the word we pray you will lift up your people together remember those that are across the world around the various nations of the world that are listening now oh god whether it be from colombia or or way over in romania wherever it is father may your spirit go forth bless your people in jesus name yet a little while and the world see it me no more but ye shall see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in the father and ye in me and i in you bless you please be seated uh now we when we spoke last week we touched on the fact that before the beginning god thought of his bride he thought of his bride and of course he thought of her in his mind so we were already in him before the foundation of the world in the dateless past of the eternities which there is no counting number years or time but we were already in his mind as a part of him now in the same way god wanting to portray that he did it in adam when he created adam and placed him here on the earth and the first adam came with his bride already in him and went because when god thought of him he thought of both of them but he thought of both of them as one and she was in him until the time or the hour came for her to be expressed now after the beginning jesus came on the scene now that's the same god with his bride in his mind but now in flesh the godhead bodily jesus christ comes with his bride already in him because when god thought of him of course he thought also of the bride that was in him and that is why when he as the old song says when when he was on the cross i was on his mind see we were in his mind before the foundations we were in his mind right at the cross at the moment when he was dying so that he could now release the bride just like adam had to be put to sleep god struck him he had to be put to sleep so the bride could be separated from him and have her own existence and manifestation that people would recognize her that she was his bride amen so we were in him that means we had representation in him uh that means that we had a theophany way back there uh that's we're not going to talk about that but we were in him or way back there we had our representation so that is why brother branham in the message called identified with christ when he died we died because we were in him so when he died we died when he rose up and and said that uh i am the resurrection and the life amen i'm the conqueror amen we were in him so he wasn't speaking just of himself that person jesus that was standing there but it was all of us in him praise god so rem always remember that that even though you may appear like a loser you may appear weak you may appear that you don't have this quality or that quality remember that satan trying to lie to your outward mind because you are already an overcomer in him you already overcome the world you already overcome the flesh you already overcome the devil you overcome everything he could throw against you praise god and your rose up and we are proving it again that is the same yesterday today and forever brother branham said the devil tried to kill you with sin but he said you rose up again above the world didn't you he said you rose up again above the flesh didn't you amen your rose up above denomination and everything else because you are overcomers by the promise of the holy spirit that is in you praise god hallelujah i said hallelujah somebody said hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen amen praise god and while speaking on that i just dropped along the thought that then we see the truth of the fact that god's original plan was that the man carried the woman in him but then satan by his deceit lies and perversion of god's way and god's plan he twisted the thing the other way and brought it from creation to procreation and then lied to her until you shall be a creator you shall be as gods and so she began to bring forth man so now the woman carries the man in her and now the churches have memberships and they uh try to bring you to a new birth which is contrary to the word of god the man the word brings you to a new birth he brings you to the place where you know who you are and where you came from and where you are going praise be to god aren't you happy to recognize that we are of the lord and savior jesus christ we further show that with the many identifications of the bribe being identified the the final and the foremost identifier jesus was identified that indeed he was the christ by his resurrection by his ascension it could not be doubted any longer because as he said in john chapter 3 verse 3 no man can rise up and go back to heaven unless he first came down from heaven and the bride will identify herself in the rapture because the rapture identifies her of who she is it's nothing she has to do nothing she has to say but god identifying her of the gift of eternal life that he already placed in her well identify her that she is that bride and raise her up praise god and take her away for his glory so the bride will be identified by her going in her rapture and god as we know will only rapture his original thoughts he's not going to rapture a church he's not going to rapture any denomination of any particular name but he is going to rapture his original thoughts for the man's thoughts and himself are one and we are one with him praise the lord so he's not going to rapture any church he's rupturing his word he's rapturing himself he's rapturing all of us that were in him so while we are here we must be identified with the word of god while you are here line up your life with the word of god show that you are one with him praise god listen brother brandon speaking the word the evening message must bring evening results the evening message must saw evening seeds not mourning seeds but evening seeds the midday scene those seeds see it died it perished but evening time message will show evening time light will show evening time results and bring an evening time message now jesus came with a midday message and he got midday results the beginning message got beginning results when they when god made creation see that was the result of the beginning message he made his son in his own image in the midday in the evening time he makes the bride and all this by what the word all by the word in the beginning you know god said let there be let there be let there be with jesus gabriel had to come and say you shall receive a son his name shall be he spoke the word praise god hallelujah and now in the last day god sends a prophet who speaks the word of god again to a bride to bring forth her amen how did he do it from the earth he's how did he speak it into existence by his word who was his son the word in the beginning was the lord and the word was with god and the word was god and that word which was god was made flesh and dwelt among us then how will he take his bride there how will he identify her by his lord praise god glory so how are you identified how is the end time bride identified by the word by accepting the word by catching a revelation of the word you're identifying that you are a part of him and the deep is calling back to the deep and god is seeing god hallelujah praise god you are identifying yourself that you are a part of him because you will not be able to interpret understand recognize and know god unless it's god in you recognizing himself praise god for it's the amen who blesses himself in the amen he will take his bride by the word now you remember when eliezer went to find a bride for isaac i think that's genesis chapter 24 you want to read that the rest of the week you can read that chapter you can study it you can laugh you can cry you can rejoice but in that chapter eliezer abraham told him what qualities he'd like to have in this brain that he wanted for his son and so when eliezer went he got to a place where there was a well and while he was there you know he said oh my lord let it be so that uh how will i know this woman how well may i be able to identify this woman that she is the bride for my my master's son and so he gave out the requirements and so when he came and he sat with his camels by the well rebecca was there and she came now do you know that she didn't ask him what he wanted she said oh sir you are tired and your camels must be thirsty let me fetch some water and she started to fetch water without her masking so what was in his mind she started to live it she started to act it out so her deeds began to identify her her life begins to identify her of who she was so he kept looking he kept looking and you know her words identified her because she literally asked to go and do this job to go and quench the thirst of these uh camels i won't give you that but you know one camel alone drink so many gallons and gallons which is buckets and buckets of water and he had several camels and she went and quenched the thirst of all those camels plus him ask him does he want a drink of water and everything else so her words her deeds and when he looked at her her nature what was inside of her her nature identify her so her words identify her deeds identify her and her nature that she had identified her so she didn't have to say anything he already knew she was the bride for his master and so is the end time bride objectified by her words her works and her deeds her nature that is in her praise god doesn't have to work up anything she doesn't have to be an actor or actress or anything like that it's just flowing out of her because it's god in her amen god in christ god in the church god in the bride amen moving forth his great activity in this wonderful end time praise god so god will according to his word he'll identify her don't you put one thing to it don't add one thing to it don't become an actor and anything like that but leave it the way that it is the evening time he promised it revealed uh law open these seven seals and show them to the churches that had missed back there and make known to them revelation 10 malachi 4 luke 17 30 he said he would do it doing god's service without doing his will praise god so we won't go in the rapture then because of what church we belong to we won't go in it because of uh we we are worshippers there's a lot of worshipers you know people in any religion worship god i mean even the chickens worship god i mean they know when they drink water to raise their head up at least like that so the water can go down their throat so they give praise to god also amen so you're only going to go if you are identified in and with the word praise god hallelujah amen so friends i'm just so happy for that that we must be identified with the word because that makes it an individual thing we don't go because all of us uh as a group suddenly um hold on to certain written truths that some church gave us but even though brother branham has tapes and books and and quotations like that that's not even it but it's the revelation of the word of god that identifies you to god and to yourself that i am one of them praise god hallelujah praise god now we know of course that jesus didn't suffer from any spiritual amnesia he knew who he was he knew he had a work to do he had a mission to die and he didn't have any spiritual amnesia praise god so when john spoke and said behold the lamb of god amen that taketh away the sins of the world john was only reinforcing who he knew he already was amen but when we came we had spiritual amnesia we didn't know who we were at all so god had to send a prophet and the prophet had to preach the word in such a way uh you know and take you and i back like you would take an amnesiac person back to their original school room back to their old family back to the old neighborhood walk them through the same street take them back to their old home you know or close to it so they start to get some kind of reaction so god sent a prophet and the prophet started to preach the word to bring us back to familiar places familiar places in the world praise god so when he quoted certain scriptures when he told certain things it was all designed by god almighty to be able to bring us and draw us back to our original uh our original place and position where we were and thank god i woke up i thank god i woke up i hope you woke up amen and just as it did with jesus with brother branham it did the same thing with me it made me become even more certain of god i began to recognize who i was amen hallelujah oh my as that prophet began to preach the word of god i told the story of the little boy i think in kentucky the people were so poor to have a big mirror was a hard thing to do so whenever they'd find a piece of mirror somewhere they'd tuck it on a tree or or or put two nails to hold it up in the house and saw this little boy had never seen a mirror before in his life and so going to visit his grandmother there he was and he decided he he saw this mirror and then he looked uh he saw another little boy in the mirror and when he moved the little boy moved and he was he's puzzled by it so he kept looking in the mirror when he moved his hand the little boy moved his hand and he just caught up with it and his parents are looking at him and then after a while the realization struck him just like how the revelation struck you because we were listening to the word for many years and you're hearing what the prophet's saying for many years and you you can say yes i see this i see that yeah you saw it it is there you're seeing it but yeah you don't have the recognition of what you're seeing you don't have the revelation i think brother branham said somewhere he said if you don't have that recognition he says i can send you to the barn for a hammer but you don't know what the hammer is so you can bring me a saw you can bring me something else because you don't have the recognition of what it is praise god hallelujah but thank god he opened our understanding by the revelation of the word praise god you you read about this young boy in uh uh three uh you know three kinds of believers i think it's paragraph two seven to three where he said mama that's me that's me i'm seeing myself in the mirror praise god and you know god's word is a mirror and when you look into the word of god as it begins to unfold that is why when a real preacher is preaching the word and you sit there you want to know how in the world does that man know that i was just talking about so-so in my car i was just thinking so and so or i wanted this right desire that it's not anything to do with the man but he's showing you the word and the words making you see yourself in the mirror you're hearing about yourself you're looking at yourself in the world amen praise god it's so real glory to god hallelujah that before you come out in the morning you look at yourself in the mirror praise god amen yes sir glory to god hallelujah and so the bride is supposed to look in the word and recognize her position glory to god hallelujah as wonderful as all these things are i am so thankful to god for his blessed and holy word amen question and answers on the seals now we come back with the seals open that seal god opens the seal for us what's that first a messenger to the church age amen comes then he opens the seals you know what happens when the sea lopes the prophet said the spiritual war breaks out because when that messenger opens that the seal is open and it declares the truth it reveals truth and error and shows you how far away from the word these churches have drifted and then when they hear you with the truth is contrary to what they've been teaching and it will break up and tear down their denomination if they allow it and let it so they've got to block it they have to destroy it they have to disparage it and discounted in every possible way hallelujah but we stay with the word of god hallelujah spiritual war breaks out and then the seven seals amen then we see the corruption we are able to see the corruption that hit the church ages email but this seventh seal doesn't reveal anything in other words he's saying the sixth seal reveals all the corruption down through those those ages there the six seals do that but now when the seventh seal was open if you go to your seal book and you read the seven seal it doesn't reveal anything praise god that you could see with your eyes or hear and you say well what's the use of that seventh seal amen it doesn't reveal anything that's going to happen does it see because at the end of the church ages is to come a prophetic gift to reveal these things are you following amen praise god glory to his wonderful name one we know now that the seventh seal was the mysterious coming of christ hallelujah we also know and if we don't know we ought to know that the bride herself is that seventh seal that is now broken by the lamb himself now the unveiling of the mighty god now as one quotation here says now in the unveiling of god it is now jehovah taking the veil off of god hallelujah amen it's the artist taking the cover from off of the masterpiece praise god hallelujah she's being unveiled to the entire world just before she's raptured out of here of who she is amen the veil being taken off of her glory to god amen you see they put a lot of emphasis on signs ones and miracles they think she's got to be she got to be identified by signs wonders miracles and big revivals and everything else like that and it's nothing of the kind she is revealed by her identification of our obedience to his preeminence of his word and she walks with the word all through the world in white praise god aren't you happy friends praise god what do you think it was in the heavens 30 miles up no moisture them seven angels come down as i told you i was on the mountain i saw where the rocks were blasted the word eagle was still in the rock until it got dug out but i saw it there but to us it was so sacred we wouldn't touch anything my god and then after those seven angels had spoken to the prophet of malachi 4 william barry and branham then they went back up and as they were going back up 30 miles up that science took the picture and the entire picture was in the face of jesus christ doing god's service in two sons think of it then big observatories now he just came off talking about the seven zeal seventh seal right um the picture is up there the picture is where it's up there and they're still wondering what happened see they put it in the paper does somebody know anything about it how could this happen there is no fog up there there is no air there is no moisture 30 miles high up there oh my did the scripture say there shall be signs in the heavens above and when these things take place earthquakes in diapers places then shall appear the same of the son of man in the heavens amen that day luke the son of man will reveal himself again and be revealed see all my brethren the world in a sodomite and gomorrah condition but don't be ignorant of these spiritual things search the scriptures for them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of the word amen they are there that testify of the truth these things that god is now doing in this very hour praise god hallelujah oh my glory of god amen [Applause] so the cloud appearing there in the heavens was a sign from god in the heavens is that right oh my you you get it that how that when the wise men were trying to journey to the full born word for two years the signs were in the heavens and when they saw those that's those stars and lying in the heavens they realized if the stars in the heavens messiah must be on the earth now lord of god if the son of man appears in the cloud in the heavens then that bride that son of man in the bright form must be on the earth now praise god and the holy spirit identifying and pointing out that she is here i said she's here the bride is here now identified by him by the holy spirit amen that we might recognize ourselves and our position amen praise god now them mysteries will be be revealed in the last day when the seventh angel's message now listen remember this not when he stands out not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not in his years of preparation but when he begins to sound the message then these mysteries then they will be revealed and here we are not knowing them and you people are now witnesses of that that observatory that cloud in the heavens over twosome oh my doesn't anybody recognize it hallelujah oh praise god now let me say this to you my brothers and sisters that you might recognize clearly what i'm saying here amen not when the messenger started out not under the first ball not under the second pole hallelujah first ball healing second paul discernment of spirits but the third pull straight to the soul amen praise god the word calls the bride the word identifies the bride the spirit of god begins to reach her praise god those first two was just a gathering all of the fishes inside of the barrel inside of the boat amen and then the word himself comes and begin to identify her praise god not in the years of preparation now i know why he used that you know the life of jesus christ if you study the life of christ is actually divided into three parts amen the years of preparation then the years of popularity and then when he died the years of persecution and that's a simple way to break up break down the life of jesus christ and that's why in the ending of the his ministry he had to preach on on the in i indict this generation for the crucifixion amen second crucifixion amen of jesus christ praise god hallelujah while god doesn't do things in twos it got to be three and the third one is not going to be him it's going to be her praise the lord she's going to be criticized she's going to be called all kinds of names and everything else like that you see praise god ours is not so much the physical but spiritually and so we have to carry the reproach for the world so not when he begins to sound out the message some i mean begin to start out with his preparation but then he begins to sound the trumpet begins to call the bride to attention of the word of god hallelujah and it catches her and that word takes a hold of her heart amen praise god page 466 of the sealed book amen hallelujah those church ages are revealed amen the messenger begins to sound when he sounds the seals begin to open up the message of the seven church ages what does that do war is declared amen praise god and that war declared then the seventh seal is preached and opened up and it appears like there's nothing in it praise god but for the bride there was something in it hallelujah because it shows her herself she sees the mystery coming of christ hallelujah not in jesus but in a bright form she sees his coming again praise god and that spirit comes down the holy spirit anointing comes to its body predestinated for the hour to use it for his glory and for his honor amen oh my think about it when god came down revelation 10 the mighty angel which we know the covenant angel the prophet said is jesus christ himself revelation 10 went to revelation 10 7. i've said it before and went and began to use the body of revelation 10 7 to fulfill the scriptures for this hour amen fulfill luke 17 30 and 21 son of man been revealed to fulfill many other scriptures joy fulfilled john revelation revelation 10 7 amen malachi 4 5 that the angel of god would begin to fulfill those various scriptures that god had prophesied in this hour praise god hallelujah well you know the first six seals manifest identified of course jesus christ and how he was walking up and down among the seven candlesticks and how he loved the church died for the church and loosed her with his own blood amen praise god but those same six seals also identified the false church it identified the mystery of inequity manifested in the four horsemen coming down through the ages trail of the serpent the evil deeds of satan and all of his works amen it shows and reveals his deceit in the garden and his damnation to the pits of hell in the book of revelation praise god hallelujah oh my but in this seventh seal hallelujah we find friends that identify the bride of who she is by god interpreting himself through her interpreting his own word god is his own interpreter and only he could bring her to life again to recognize who she was praise god hallelujah so just as god did that true brother branham fulfilled the prophecies about about this gentile prophet in this age he also fulfilled this end-time scriptures that are supposed to be fulfilled he uses the bride to do that see he used brother branham to fulfill malachi 4 5 revelation 10 uh you know luke 17 30 and things like that in a partial form and now he is literally using his many membered body so it is becoming unto us to fulfill all righteousness it's becoming for the holy spirit to work through us and to fulfill all righteousness praise god and for you to do that you're going to have to bear the reproach for the world i said you're going to have to wait a reproach for the word because now remember excuse me now you're carrying the word are you or is the word carrying you but in any case what i'm saying is that you're going to have to bear the reproach of that pregnancy because it's going to reveal you it's going to identify you it's going to show you who you are and you're going to have to bear the reproach for the word of god amen every one of us we're going to have to bear that reproach for the word of god he said but i don't see it yet but let me tell you it's coming down slowly the devil knows how to bring pressure and he brings it slow slow you don't hardly know that pressure is coming down on you little by little pressure is coming down amen by the time you wake up you're already caught up in the middle of it and there's nothing more you can do praise god but thank god we've been prepared by the word of god for this hour praise god hallelujah amen how wonderful it is to know that we are part of him now i'm looking at the unveiling of god paragraph 122 now what is this what's this revival belong to now how could it ever prosper them talking of revival how could it be like that don't they understand when moses went out amen you remember of course that brother branham spoke as i was with moses so shall i be with thee he typed himself dr moses so and so and like that he says now when moses went out remember that when he gathered the people it was a mixed multitude that went out with him see a mixed multitude but the difference between them right and wrong it's for what was it what's it done for so that jehovah himself can take the veil off of god to show the difference between right and wrong methodist presbyterian what's right to show the difference between right and wrong but god's word is right amen now catch that subtle thought there he is saying there that he's gonna prove that all of these denominations are wrong but god's manifested word for the hour that's right he's going to show it that that's right they are right that word in them is right and no matter how big these giants have become and everything like that they are still right so moses left with a mixed multitude amen but only joshua and caleb met married over the other side amen praise god he identifies his bride by unveiling himself in her praise god taking the veil off of god himself praise god amen it's a hidden mystery but it's written in the word it's written in the word and there you find it praise the lord hallelujah you see the rest the other church ages were not raptured amen they died in faith but they weren't raptured not because they weren't worthy like us but they yet did not have all of the truth see that's all so they without us cannot be made perfect they have to wait until all of the word is unveiled to us and then being encompassed with this cloud of witnesses they have to watch and see what we are going to do with this world how we're going to react to it but that this word of god in us now that has come to the confirmation of all the ages and the entire fullness of it has been deposited all the word of god in christ amen all in him bodily praise god that word now come down in the bright form of a son of man form and now watch that word make itself manifest within that bride praise the name of the lord so they did not have all of the words so they could not come to full obedience they could not come to their complete and total placing in jesus christ praise god hallelujah uh you you remember when uh christ is a mischief god revealed when brother brahm said oh i just looked at the clock it's two o'clock oh praise god he says the fastful is over the second pull is over the third pull is at hand glory god amen hallelujah oh my his announcing their presence their rival the manifestation the interpretation of the bride the word of god in bright form hallelujah oh water our glory to god hallelujah in the same message right in the same paragraph he says did you notice that we are singing and suddenly i said that and the singing went into a higher octave oh my praise god the whole thing has gone into a higher octave do you know that even some brethren wouldn't even can't follow what we're even talking about here now it's gone into a higher octave completely praise the name of the lord jesus hallelujah and so the seven thunders are now or is now identifying the bride the seven thunder's the voice of god the revealed voice of god making itself known praise the name of the lord hallelujah because the years of preparation did not place the bride it didn't position the bride or didn't identify the bride whatsoever not when not until when he started to open up the seals and that is what began to catch the bride's attention the word grab more of our attention praise god oh my remember brother sister before i read about brother brandon's books i was seeing miracles signs and wonders it was marvelous brother branham came along but he was just another another great evangelist velma gardner w v grant a.a allen oral roberts many of them with miracle signs and wonders and everything else like that but when that man began to speak the word i would read about i would read some of his messages in and now the funk publication called the herald of his coming from lost pines california and there my brother i would read his message and i actually started to collect those things to read his messages because there were in one part the entire thing and i think the prophet mentioned it he said they're always saying god send us an elijah we need an elijah in this hour we need the spirit of elijah to bring the word of god down to us everything else at that time i didn't recognize that he was literally the elijah was right there and they didn't know who he was and he was bringing these messages and i would deliberately keep those magazines with his messages in it not knowing who he was and then later on um when i realized with the casting out of devils and having them devil speaking in tongues through a schoolmate of mine i knew the person so it's not they're not putting on it's not something else i knew that was a devil and the devil got exposed and the devil talked to me and i talked back to the devil and knew it was the devil and he was speaking in tongue i knew right then tongues could not be the initial evidence and so they didn't like that when i began to talk like that and so of course my brother sister we parted ways right there and then praise god parted with right there and then not just based on that because just around that time i began to pray lord then if tongues is not the evidence then what is the truth there got to be something that is the evidence other person has the holy spirit what is it it wasn't like weeks later a book couple of books were slipped under my the door of of where we i stayed praise the lord and reading the books hybrid religion was attraction on the mountain oh my oh i tell you my soul started to go up and down i'm gonna i'm just gonna talk with you now praise the lord amen and i could not sleep but you know i wasn't going to just jump on any bandwagon because somebody said something so i one god not three but that's what it is but i thought that that's what everybody believed because that's how i was thinking of it so when i go and ask the professor i won't call his name i asked him like that oh no god is one yes but the three persons in one god and began to this and that and whatnot and see my and so i saw a difference right there and begin things began to open things began to open and then i began to question and the rest of it you know we separated we parted ways and uh based on the prophet's message there and that's where i regret now i didn't write him because right then i was writing a letter that was just in the middle of 65 and i was writing him a letter and it didn't get there in time 65 or was it 65 but yes yes i didn't write the letter i delayed and by the december i heard that the prophet had passed on but later on i understood that obviously he didn't get the letter but still he knew praise the lord but later on i go to other places and preach the word and preach the word and then commanding this crippled man stand on your feet in the name of jesus and he stands up on his feet and started walking like this then suddenly he stopped he said but but but the prophet prayed and right away something got a hold of him and he went right back down he had to scramble his friend had to hold him and he go back and sat down in the chair the friend said what but but you you didn't understand you remember he said when jack is in the box amen and if you react to the right word you're healed amen he said you want to understand john is jack and the box is the pulpit he said oh brother i said i can't do anything i didn't know about that there's nothing i can do praise the lord but i want you to know that god has sent us a god-sent prophet but not only because he says so before um before anything else a couple of books that we were reading and then i would i stand by a bridge that we had over a canal and some bushes on the side there and i'm talking to them and telling them of the prophet and they're talking back to me and we're talking with the prophet and out of those bushes come a light about this size and it's just moving slow it's not moving fast just slow and because it was behind them and i'm talking to them the bushes are back there and this thing kept coming up like and i want to know if i'm seeing right maybe i'm imagining things so uh you know um i said do you see anything and they turn oh my god and so they saw it too light starts coming up like that praise god now this is not brother branham talking about some imaginary pillar of fire that i gotta imagine that came on him in the states i am looking at it there and it's moving slow about this size and i'm saying well you know you know i thought quickly that maybe because we are not talking about this man we caught up in all this stuff like that uh we can start to imagine all kinds of things so i was staying at my aunt my wife's um sister my mother mother sister and she lived across the canal so i just ran over the bridge ran to the house this is after midnight like one o'clock in the morning so there's nobody around and i just bang bang bang bang on the door and they want to know run out because they want to watch this emergency what happened what happened boy i asked them do you see anything so what do you mean oh my god what is that because it's moving slow and it's just going like that but when about three or four of them came out and said what is that what is that what is it it just went then it went in a speed it just went right up and disappeared now that is my experience and i saw that i didn't see it in the states i didn't see it anywhere and i don't attribute it to anything but just to let you know that the word of god is real of god is real amen so brother sister what do we have to say what do you have to say you don't have to say nothing the word the holy spirit himself will identify who you are and who i am i don't have to say anything to you you can you can say whatever you want call me any name you like whatever you can put me down you can say i don't have to listen to him i don't like that accent that he has you know is it african is it west indian is it the caribbean is it is it from the south or i mean that state called canada is it from there where is it from amen but you see those things don't matter so the devil distracts people i'm just talking with you now the devil distracts people from the word they'll make you look and say oh his tie is twisted what's this twisted tie got to do with the word do you understand god deliberately send prophets that were living in smelly dirty caves wearing you know camels you know them how they're full of licensed fleas and everything else and elijah was wearing camel skin you know how smelly you you know how goats are smelling and camels are worse and they're wearing that and they want to come talk to kings and talk to these wise men so i'm trying to show you god deliberately place his men in those kinds of background that if you're not really watching and listening you'll be distracted you'll be thrown off you won't be able to see those things because you're looking at all these oh he didn't clean his shoes off at the door before he came in my house oh my god or something or the other but that's how the devil works so brethren keep your eyes on the word of god and let the word be your guide let the holy spirit in you take the word and be your guide praise the lord i'm like three minutes late i'm just a little past 12 30. so uh god bless you all have a great uh happy thanksgiving weekend praise the lord enjoy whatever fruits or good things god has given to you enjoy whatever light god has given to you god has brought aloud the kovid and we all learning to live with him and him alone there is no pastor to keep you no deacon to
