America [Music] [Applause] Canada haven't traveled for 17 years I don't do that I have to be a good neighbor and you know 17 is a good number you know 16 is love but 17 is Victory I didn't make that up somebody else who studied the Bible for years and years until they turned ready figured out all these numbers and I kind of I thought that was interesting that 16 would be love and 17 would be Victory CU we're living in a time when we're experiencing victory in the love God so I mean if you have love if love matures to such a point the next thing is Victory you can't I need a body change

you could sense when you guys were worshiping your worshipers is welcome am he was coming and I since he moved in and um I always think of worship as a as a John the Baptist ministry It prepares the way for the word you know you come in here to worship under the you know it's it's Propet who love music prophets ask for musicians to come to get them in spirit so they become a vision right so the word comes you're have a prophetic Ministry you when you're worshiping please don't just do a routine here oh we worship we hear the word and we go home we have lunch you come here to worship you're doing something huge this is a big event you're introducing the Messiah to the world it's not me it's not brother Simon it's the word that's coming just vessel I'm just is ever unless he comes so let's pray and trust that he will Romans 11:33 oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how un searchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out father God bless this word and bless your people may there be a merge an infusion of your word revealed with these your people let Lord God the the the hidden message within these black letters written on White Pages let the hidden message the red letter come forth into Living Color into the minds and the hearts of every huj the hearing of my voice the name of Jesus Christ let it let there be a marriage Hallelujah name we ask it according to your will in your name amen may be seated hallelujah hallelujah I have a thought this morning of if you want to give it a title it's just one word it's called Indescribable there are things that happen in our lives saints that sometimes we just don't we can't find the words to express what happened or how it impacted us and each one of us if you really thought about it and maybe some things in your life uh in their life that are that were not good they were bad events that are also Indescribable not something you even want to talk about may be something you've blocked in your memory you don't even know you blocked it you blocked it so well that you don't think about it you live your life tiptoeing and walking around subconsciously things in your life you walk around events you try to avoid things you live a life of avoidance and you don't even know why but that's not what I want to speak about this morning because I believe this if we focus on the negative we may improve it we may not if we focus on our weaknesses we may make them better we may not but I have discovered in 27 years of serving the lord that if we focus on our strengths if we focus on who we are if we focus on who he is if we focus on the promiser The promisee Keeper if we focus on God focus on him and his word and not on the problems not on the situations uh then the best things start happening you start transforming you start changing you start having a renewing of your mind and that starts to cause things to come to surface and fall off that need anymore it's liberty if you continue in my word you will know the truth see Jesus never said know the truth the truth will make you free he said if you continue in my word then you will know the truth and the truth will make you free so you have to start with the first things first amen amen but Paul says in 2 Corinthians 9:15 you don't need to turn there but he said this and I love it because if he sums up his entire expression of the Gospel an expression of the good news the exciting news the expression of the message by the way the message of the hour that we believe is the message of the Apostle Paul how many believe that it's just more revealed fully revealed amen uh and he says finally in 2 Corinthians 9:15 as he wraps up that letter he says thanks be to God for his Indescribable gift Hallelujah some gifts just are Indescribable how many here celebrates Christmas some do some don't right Christmas your birthday whatever people will give you a gift sometimes you get a gift from someone that you keep getting the same gift and you're like oh yeah it's another tie I'm going to hang that up with my other 400 ties hope I better wear it next Sunday with right and then sometimes somebody was really listening or really knows you and they gave you something that you didn't even expect and you were shocked and you don't even have words and it's not a put on you're there maybe they're there and they're watching you and they're really they're saying wow I guess I really hit something there cuz they really love it and it's Indescribable it's something you can't express but Saints what I want to talk to you about this morning is God's love his power his wisdom his glory are wonderful to experience and we've experienced it amen but they're so difficult to describe very difficult to describe uh I was born in 1964 um uh I was uh I was born to parents who were Christians uh born into a family of of of eight uh now nine so as I was born into was nine of us I was actually in the middle but I call myself the peterel and the sandwich I'm wear the peanut but and jelly sort of mix so I don't know who I am and what I'm supposed to be here for so and uh so I'm right in the middle and uh but uh my parents came into the message the year before and so I find it very interesting my mother I asked her why did you have so many kids I mean she's a 5'2 Saint having she had 10 the last one didn't survive but why did you do that she goes well he said she said I I really didn't make make a Big Splash in this world so I just felt that one thing I can do is make children I can make a doctor I can make a lawyer I can make a president I can make a preacher and I can make a farmer or whatever she I can make whatever I just kep making said well you got the preacher out of the deal anyway [Applause] Hallelujah but called naming me Elijah was sort of a dad giveway don't you think so it's like how's I going to escape that I'm going to be the best Crook in the world I'm going to make I'm going to rob banks and stuff that's not going to happen but you know God has an amazing sense of humor too in a way that he puts things together that sort of match you'll see patterns that's the beauty of the Bible God doesn't spell everything out in the Bible so that it's easy to find makes it a little bit hard doesn't it makes it so that you have to chase to learn anything I remember one time there was a lady who came to Christ she came to the message and she was so excited she said oh I'm so excited I got God in my life I got Jesus in my life I'm going to be able to be blessed in every area right now I'm out of out of work and I've been I've been laid off and I got to have a good job so let me look in the Bible and see if I can find where God can help me find a good job so she starts looking at the index j o there it is never started reading about j o she learned a lot about how you have to sometimes suffer [Applause] Hallelujah I remember this other gentleman he he came to the to the truth and this is his story it was pretty funny but he walked into church a little bit late worship was going on and he heard the song they were singing he says man I'm excited about being in this message these people are too proud and arrogant this song is horrible I've Got Brains why would people be singing I've Got Brains he was sitting in a seat of the scornful Nelson and dawned on him you know what this message is the truth of the hour we're going into Rapture it's true We've Got Brains he sang the whole song I've Got Brains I got bra got bra [Music] humility was coming his way too cuz he learned later on that our god reigns that's a hearing problem you know a lot of times we accuse each other we're not getting along because we have we feel like someone is coming across Pride or have some other arrogant issue and really is we're not hearing right and sometimes even with our Lord we think what's wrong Lord why have you rejected me why are you turn you know causing me not to be blessed what's happening and it's a lot of times we're just not hear it right amen amen and a lot of times it's just the fact that he's Indescribable you can't really put a tag on God you know Americans are probably Canadians and probably the whole world we like to stereotype everybody we want to put everybody in a compartment and that's the reason why they the church world the religious world comes up with religion is how to how do do how do we dissect God and and compartmentalize him and get him in his little place so we know who he is and that's what they've done unfortunately you can't do that with God because he is like a lightning bolt how are you going to capture that he is like the inexpressible things of this world that we don't even understand that the phys physics um uh the great physicists can't even put words to it they try to describe how the uh quantum theory works and you try to read a book on it and you're just as baffled at the end as the beginning and at the end they just conclude that they don't even understand what they just talked about right pretty exci but that's our God how you going to do that even this message oh we have such deep understanding we still don't get it that's right you know the reason why God had Shepherds come to see Jesus at his birth because they were ignorant and knew it the reason he had wise men come is because they were wise and still knew they didn't know everything they learned a lot they probably felt like they knew less Hallelujah but but I was born and this is kind of the interesting part but I was born on May 7th now it's interesting because it was May 7th in 1946 when an angel commissioned our Prophet under an Elijah commission that's pretty powerful stuff right and so yes my mother was aware of the name but she felt to name me that and it was just lands on the same day which I find very fascinating but Ephesians 3 I think is um and I love the book of Ephesians how many understands that's our Joshua that's our how The Exodus ends up we're entering Promised Land time right that's Ephesians and he says there in Ephesians 3:14 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ from whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that's exciting isn't it the ineffable name right you can't even describe his name that that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that's a lot of words there but how many loves those words anyway I want my inner man be strengthened by his Spirit he says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the bread and the length and the depth and the height Hallelujah every Dimension and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God how many loves that even even Paul in in this great mature church called the the Believers of Ephesus knew that he could express these things but he was saying make this your goal it's going to be it's virtually impossible but make it your desire and your goal that you could comprehend somehow Gather in your mind that you have your spiritual mind the very height and the Very depth and the Very length and width of God all the things you could possibly know learn it go for it go into this great place and search out the unsearchable don't do it other religions do God is you know he's he's Untouchable uh he's Transcendent he's Way Beyond us he's in three persons we don't understand what we're talking about but that's better for you because you don't need to know him you can't know him he's too far away that is not what God's ever wanted in in his life God's whole purpose God's whole design and his whole Bible is written as a story about how he comes to us because we can't get to him he comes to us first as a father over his people and finally as a son with his people and ultimately as the spirit in his people the same God that's the whole story The Bible you can split it up into three parts Old Testament Jesus New Testament that's the whole story being told hallelujah it's exciting and so he's saying to us search even though you don't know but search the unsearchable go into it some of the laziest people on Earth are Catholics they just come to church do the religion and leave my son had a friend he's Catholic he says come to my church and he asked us and we said you know what go ahead it's horrible that we're saying go to a Catholic church but go 16 he needs to see the difference he goes oh he says you wouldn't believe that the church has the capacity for 200 there was 36 people there they were old people and they act like they didn't care and as soon as it was over they left said they left they didn't say anything they just said that's because they completed their their obligation they did the religion and they're done some of the other lazy people too are unfortunately around the rings of this message because we've been handed so much so for two reasons one it seems like it's so much it's unfall we can't really get it I just I'm not even going to try that's bad we'll work on that in a minute the other reason is because of people have the same spirit it's the same spirit that let the pasture to it and partly brother John brother Simon is because we're we're blessed God has given us the ministry we're blessed with the gift we bring these messages that are basically on Silver platters and people are eating and enjoying it and there tremendous meals we enjoy it and we go we're not so you need to ask yourself the question am I doing what Paul said am I still digging deeper am I Noble like the Berean believers who heard the Apostle Paul preached the messenger of the age the prophet of the age and then went and searched it out or do I eat my dinner after church and say wasn't that a wonderful message brother J preach all brother sim said you're wonderful Pastor what a great message that was CH was so uh who's playing in the World Series [Music] today are we going to have bad weather tomorrow you know what what's what's going on is we haven't realized that this message isn't done yet I'm not I haven't changed yet and you know what's going to change us is US digging in amen amen I actually I'm brother brother Simon and I are are relying on you to do your part because it's going to take all of us God has to orchestrate this around the world so the entire bride has to be together on this well I don't have a gift of preaching brother Elijah I don't think I'm supposed to be yeah you're supposed to be digging into the word you need to know what is the height the depth the width and and and the length of this whole thing going to it even though you know you'll never be able to get to the end of it that's okay that's why we're going to need a millennial right amen we're not going to be in a honeymoon with the Lord Jesus sitting around twiddling our thumbs we got things to do he said the prophet of God said we're going somewhere where we're going to work we're going to study we're going to play we're going to enjoy amen but let's get started now amen hallelujah so it takes it's a lifetime Endeavor of saints to even grasp the the breath the length the height the depth how are we going to describe it we can barely even understand it ourselves but go for it do it anyway but how can we even begin to describe it you know once job experienced the glory of God he said I put my hand over my mouth I will say another I won't say another word what was going on with joob he was he was so impacted by God's awesome presence that he could not even find the words to try and express it but he those 39 chapters so he did pretty good right don't you think he tried how do we portray the glory of God how do we do it he experienced this he couldn't do it the Old Testament uh uh talks about these things you know when the cloud came down they fell on their faces they couldn't even worship they hardly could do anything because God's presence was there and was so powerful so many times there were men throughout the Bible who after seeing God's glory his presence could not put words to it adequately think about Moses think about David think about Isaiah Ezekiel Paul just all the way through many men and women could not do it words just fall short amen accurate descriptions fail how do you describe the Indescribable how can we do it they did their best to convey what they witnessed sometimes they talk about a fire sometimes the Bible talks about a cloud uh an angel a man a dove likee Spirit a rushing Mighty Wind a star there's all these different different descriptions many depictions but most are inadequate why is it Saints it's because how can the finite describe the infinite how can the limited even begin to express the unlimited we don't have the terms the terminology Moses saw the Heavenly Throne Room the Bible tells us that when Moses saw that he began to build the ark and the mercy seats and designed it based on what he saw he put two cheran there how many of remember is that that's scripture right they're seated upon the mercy seat two cheran that's what he saw in heaven he saw God he saw two cherub there's another place where David said that he saw God riding on a cherub one cherub two cherub him one cherabin right another time Isaiah talks about what he experienced and he talks about seeing the Glorious presence of of God and um he doesn't talk about one or two he talks about four Ezekiel seems to talk about four as well but when Isaiah talks about it he says they have six wings they have four faces but Ezekiel says they have four wings and they have 16 faces each one has four faces very strange we might be able to draw some conclusions as I've read some scholarly atheists write on it that see these guys didn't even their words didn't even agree with each other contradictions run all through the Bible of course how do you describe it they're similar enough that we know they're talking about the same thing but how do we describe it John in Revelation 4 he witnessed something very very similar to these two prophets and he mentions uh um bodies full of eyes whereas Ezekiel says there were wheels that were full of eyes bodies Wheels also John said that they were crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come how many could just jump in right now and start worshiping when you hear also John and a prophet John now this point prophesying and speaking about what he's seeing and he's saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come that's something amazing I wish I was there with John right but we were experiencing similar things today but then Isaiah when he heard it he said he heard holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory different sayings what's going going on what can we say is the Bible inconsistent are these prophets accurate can we trust them why is it that they're telling the story one way and the later to tell it a little bit different remember these are finite men with human weaknesses even though they are prophets but they're attempting to describe the awesome Majestic presence of all God even the Bible tells us in the New Testament that the prophets were known to have searched the scriptures and other Prophecies of other men of their time including their own prophecies to try and understand the meaning I can imagine Isaiah saying why did I say a UR shall conceive this is craziness trying to say where else is that did Elijah say anything about this did Moses say anything you know you can imagine these men that's what the Bible tells us they were searching without results imagine that you're sticking with word that you don't know why you said it and they're going to saw you in half in the Box you're going to stay with your prophecy about this virgin thing yes I can't help it I said it it's got to be true Indescribable Saints we have to give these men and the Bible descriptions the benefit of the doubt because what they experiened of the infinite of the omnipotent of the omnipresent God was Absol absolutely Indescribable and I'm and we're thankful for these descriptions even if we think they don't agree with each other because that's the best we have am that's right God never spells himself out he never gives himself all the way he gives just enough because he's the god that desires to be chased he the god that desires relationship that's right you just can't have relationship in a stagnant situation you need to have one person going after the other and vice versa right kind of like Jacob and Rachel I think it was sporting the Bible say whatever the word was I know you don't believe in sports but James sporting I [Music] think I hope you brothers that have been married for 22 years or longer like me are still supporting your wives Paul had attempts to try to describe it because remember he was working for the Sanhedrin he was out collecting Christians to be beaten and thrown in jail so he's on his way to Damascus because he hears that they run from Jerusalem to there and they're starting a big Hub over there message this message I hate this message it's crazy message we got to put an end to this message he was a messenger of the age can you imagine that crazy want to kill his own message but on his way he is struck down by a light by a phenomenon he is knocked down and blinded and he starts describing it in Acts chapter 9 you don't need to read it I'll kind of run through this with you so we can get a pretty good picture of it he says and as it's describing as as though it's third person it might have been somebody else writing this but it says and as Paul or as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shown around about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul why P persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom you persecutest am it is hard for you to kick against the goats I love sharing this story one time I was uh I was with a gentleman who was um a uh I believe it a jovah witness and it was standing in line at some meeting somewhere he was Jehovah's Witness and I was talking to him about it and I said you know my whole church we're all Jehovah's Witnesses he go really oh yeah I said oh yes we witness about your all the time you know and I said um I said I love I love the way he came down as a fire in a burning bush and find and and and he was a fire by night and Cloud by day and and Israel followed him and he led them to the promised land and he kept showing up as a fire or sometimes maybe angelically but he was Jehovah you know he was there in the Old Testament over and over I mean he definitely displayed himself amen I said then in the New Testament he comes again he shows up and and and as in front of Paul and a Big Bright Light Of Fire and knocks him off his horse and he goes hey man that's awesome that's exciting and and uh and he heard and then Paul hears a voice Saul Saul why are you persecuting me he goes yeah that's right Hallelujah brother I was giving him so much rope it was scary I was really afraid start to get nerves like he was going to have meltdown got too much into this and and finally Paul says who art thou Lord and the Lord says I am Jesus whom you're persecuting like yes he [Applause] it's too bad really that people can't be open to the word of God who claim they know it all amazing but it says here that in verse six it says and he trembled and and and and he was he and he trembling and astonished said Lord see he didn't say oh I can't believe that he said Lord he called him Lord again Lord what wil thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise go into the city it should be told you what you must do and the men who journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but not but seeing no one keep this in mind right they have they're hearing a voice but they're not seeing anything now let's go on to acts 22 you don't need to turn there again but this is where he's before Paul is before the Jewish Sanhedrin and he's talking about the story and he says about noon there was a great light that shown around about me and he says and Paul says he fell to the ground and that's all paralleling very well with what we read in nine then he says those with me did not hear the voice but they saw the light and were afraid so one said they heard a voice but didn't see anything the other one says he saw a light but they didn't hear a voice so now we have a lot of craziness what what really happened well perhaps Paul is embellishing or maybe he's doing his best to describe something Indescribable or maybe his memory is failing him it's quite a while later since he's now before the San this is after several quite a few years since the experience later on in Acts 26 he's before King agria the governor uh and Governor Felix in a Roman tribunal and he's describing what happened because they want to know it so he says I saw a light from Heaven brighter than the sun this is a little bit more than just a big light that a light brighter than the sun uh you know acts 9 a light acts 22 he says a great light and Acts 26 he says a light brighter than son so it seems like his story is getting bigger and Boulder all the time I don't know if we should still believe Paul I think it was a charlot trying to blow his own horn right don't you think so there's a lot more but keep going says and then he says shining around me and those who journeyed with me so now he includes everybody else was in this light and we all fell to the ground but earlier we found that only Paul fell to the ground so now we have the story going on that what's going on here and if if you go on to read the rest of Acts 26 it talks about a lot more that we hadn't heard before I'm Jesus whom you persecute but rise stand to thy feet I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both uh of these things which thou have seen and of those things in which I will appear uh unto thee again delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are Sanctified by faith uh that is in me so a lot is going on here all of a sudden we're hearing all this other stuff that Jesus said that we don't hear about ever before what does it mean is it possible that Paul is having a memory loss here is he trying to make himself seem bigger and better than he really was I think any skeptic has the right to ask these questions um was this the whole story or was this a fabrication what was Paul up to two things one Paul may have heard much more than what we first know about when he's dealing with the Jews he's sharing with them all they need to know he may felt that he didn't need to tell them about he's actually ultimately sent to the Gentiles that probably would have made life a little worse for him don't you think I don't know why he didn't tell the Sanhedrin all this but he told it to the Gentiles they got to hear about his real Mission first the Jews then the Gentiles on the other hand these descriptions about the light and the presence of God and how he was impacted was really not to try and blow his own horn but he was simply in the same position that all the prophets had always always been and all men and women of God who experienced God have always been in and that is it's very difficult to describe what really happened right I remember one time that there was an individual um who was out who was saying you know I don't believe in God or God doesn't exist you can't prove it to me and so I asked him the question does love exist yes prove it to me he said well you know you can see if somebody loves somebody you'll see you'll see C certain things happen okay and if something from the invisible other world comes and changes my life radically for the better from a pop smoking alcohol drinking uh crazy guy to someone who now has a tremendously blessed life with a purpose and a direction and I know where I'm going amen someone who had a very sick body that was healed by almighty God miraculously you're not going to be able to convince me that there's no God and I won't try to convince you there's no such thing as love deal deal he had to make that deal he was in trouble he said I see your point go back to the drawing board you can't prove to me there's no God well I just proved there is a God Amen Hallelujah so Paul seems to be expanding on the story but honestly Saints let's just realize what's going on here he's not really trying to dramatize his experiences um he's not having trouble memorizing or remembering the details that he's not making up things to try and prove his authority these things are happening because they're absolutely quite frankly Indescribable I can't really describe to you how it happened that I was healed but I'm going to tell tell it to you a little bit later if you have time the best of my ability amen I'll share those things with you but it's Indescribable you know let me let me ask you a question was it one cherub two cherubs four cherubs four wings six wings four faces 16 faces it's Indescribable it's his presence I don't care if I see a million faces I want to be close to that presence that doesn't bother me I believe these men's testimonies I trust them that they're witnessing the truth that's how they experienced it they did the best they could they shared it with us and we know it was true because they went from who they were to people who transformed the world that they lived in Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus resurrection was it no Angels one angel two angels Three Angels you can read Mark Matthew Mark Luke John you can read all about it and it's not really that easy to be able to say I don't know I mean yeah I think it was three I think it was two I don't know but they described it to the best of their ability based on what they experienced see what literally happens is one thing how we experience it is another thing and then trying to describe it that's even a third thing but we must still search it and describe it to the best of our ability Hallelujah you know brother I got a question did Brother ranom see five Angels did he see seven angels maybe he saw five maybe he saw seven how do you describe something coming at you faster than the speed of life that's right we have a hard time when we see an accident happen cu the car was going 55 M hour I don't know officer I I saw it I mean it's kind of like I think it was a blue car might have been yellow and the guy was wearing a red hat but it might have been uh Happ so fast right that's all right like when our kids get in trouble we get them to try to describe what happened I don't know it just it just happened so fast then you hear him in the other room telling their friends exactly detail for detail how it Happ who's deceiving whom so uh you know that's the thing it's a vision he's seeing something in a supernatural way in a supernatural de de Dimension so honestly I I just all I can say is I don't know but in all these cases I believe all of these reports amen because I don't worry about the veil that experienced it the man or the woman or the person that experienced it I'm not worried about that that that's okay I want the description do the best you can it's like a detective right describe what you heard to the best of your ability um and we'll go from that it must be with tremendous difficulty to describe the most high God in all his glory moving beyond the speed of light amen coming at you it must be extremely difficult and I'm thankful that it got cleared up as it went along amen because the reality of it made it clear you know sometimes people have argued over prophecies in the Bible because it was confusion and then when it happened then it was all cleared up amen you know 300 prophecies about jesus' first coming it all cleared up right they could argue over before every Jew has three opinions about one thing that's what they talk about in the mission that's pretty interesting every Jew has three opinions about one thing and they do literally have you know Rabbi so and so Rabbi Solomon Rabbi Rea said this and there's three different opinions about you can't really know exactly what's right but when Jesus came he became all man's opinions to the Wayside here's what it is hallelujah and that's why even some of the prophecies that are still hanging in the message that we're people around our Rings you know is it going to be a real tent is it going to be this is it going to be that I ask people if you feel like it's going to be a real tent then there must be a real fishing pole a real shoe with a real shoelace doesn't that make sense that was a vision it was very figurative to begin with it should pretty much hang out there figurative all the way through one time brother said oh God I wish I had a tabernacle L like these Great Men these great men are my Ministry got them going you look at them they have huge buildings oh God I wish I had a huge Tabernacle right a big building and God said look up see this guy that's your Tabernacle Hallelujah and I'm your portion those things so we don't need to try to figure this out we just need to understand that there are things that we don't know yet still some things we don't fully know yet but we do know that they're going to be fulfilled just on time exactly when God wants exactly the way he [Applause] want I'm here believes that when Paul says I I show you I'm going to tell you a Mist we're not all going to die but we're all going to change all going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye how many believes that that that's going to happen amen how many understands that Paul only told us the mystery a prophet came in the last day the first Messer told us the last one revealed it amen so now we have the mystery as a revelation but still in spite of the Revelation the supernatural element Still Remains for it to actually happen faith comes before manifestation Revelation then manifestation can we say amen I have not experienced the body change yet but I know it's coming amen and Saints I even know it to such a level brother Simon I'm sure you experienced the same thing that this body change that we speak of is really not something outside of us that we're going to run into or it's going to hit us but the body change as brother cleared it up for us thank God for the message called The Rapture and other places and questions and answers where he clears it up for us that it's already in you amen your body change is in you yes can you describe it to me then I don't believe you well then you're done if somebody says I don't believe you then they they shouldn't believe anything the physicists say CU all the stuff they say is craziness but somehow we do believe it somehow these physicists created an atomic bomb hydrogen bombs and other things out of this crazy knowledge so we have to believe it's true amen but it's in you tell The Inchworm or or the monarch butterfly larva that's crawling around eating leaves tell him he's not a monarch butteri go ahead where's your wings come on crazy you're just eating leaves and getting backat you don't have wings even if you had wings you couldn't fly if you wanted to how many ever experienced something like that on where's your wings you want to know where the wings are in that larva or whatever that thing is called in worm worm he right in them how's that possible well he goes into a cocoon stage and he's in his cocoon and all of a sudden the Cocoon falls off and there's these wings in there where did those come from they were in him all along now mentally and maybe to everyone else's appearance the Monarch Lara was eating leaves to survive eating leaves because he was hungry eating leaves be the biggest baddest worm out there maybe that was possible but the truth is the real hunger that was coming from the pit of stomach was the DNA that were in him unfulfilled I am DNA for wings I am making you hungry you need to eat if you don't eat enough you won't have enough to make a cocoon and if you don't make a cocoon you will not be able to produce meat and I am DNA for wings so you need enough for cocoon and wings so eat eat eat eat eat that's why you're eating here that's why you're here this morning I really hope come here oh I got to go to church oh I got to go to church oh okay I got to get up early get a shower BR my teeth get ready men take longer than women in the message it's really true it's weird in some cases my wife would agree sister M my wife she she'll agree she I don't know you take longer than I it's true she goes in and out she's like I'm like the [Music] Rapture yes we but I mean you know super
