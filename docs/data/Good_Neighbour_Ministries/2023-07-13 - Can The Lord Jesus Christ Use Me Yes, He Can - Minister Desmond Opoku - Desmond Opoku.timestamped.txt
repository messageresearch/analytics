[35:14] can build our faith
[35:17] on the word of God
[35:20] he caught up
[35:21] he was there and he was not the same
[35:25] thing he did to work Enoch

[36:24] was no different person
[36:29] the same Philip
[36:32] was like you and me

[36:43] because it's so sweet
[36:45] Hallelujah
[36:47] that's why I'm happy
[36:49] when I speak about the word of God or
[36:52] when I read and God gave me
[36:54] understanding
[36:55] it becomes like a lightning
[36:58] unto me it doesn't matter where I am
[37:02] sometimes when I'm working

[37:07] happened to me
[37:08] he's right there ice cream
[37:11] Hallelujah
[37:13] I scream so high
[37:15] and sometimes I'm listening to brother
[37:17] Abraham the thing hit me like a rock I
[37:21] jump
[37:22] Hallelujah
[37:24] that's the happiest
[37:26] happiest woman

[37:51] thank you Lord
[37:55] my topic tonight is can the Lord Jesus

[38:03] that's my topic can the Lord Jesus
[38:06] Christ use me yes he can
[38:09] he use you yes he can Hallelujah
[38:15] we all know that God chose us before the
[38:18] foundation of the word as we always say
[38:21] brother Simon always said the preachers
[38:23] always say
[38:24] if God by his infinite wisdom chose you
[38:28] to be his son or daughter
[38:31] that means
[38:34] there is a work for each and everyone to
[38:38] do
[38:39] nobody can sit here without doing
[38:42] nothing
[38:44] you do you think Moses knew know that
[38:47] God gonna use him the way he used him he
[38:50] did not know
[38:53] Abraham didn't know
[38:55] this by the grace of God
[38:58] the same Grace he called you and me
[39:02] it's not what we have done not that we
[39:05] are special people we're talking about
[39:07] faith faith was not a special person
[39:11] when you talk about Peter he wasn't a
[39:13] special person
[39:14] the Bible said they were unlearning
[39:18] they don't know nothing
[39:21] sometimes even if you put his name to
[39:23] write down he can hear he can talk but
[39:27] he cannot write
[39:29] but God doesn't look that he look here
[39:33] what he has chose before the foundation
[39:36] of this world
[39:38] Hallelujah
[39:40] if God chose you before the foundation
[39:42] of this world he has a work for you to
[39:45] do
[39:46] Oh Glory to God the only thing you have
[39:50] to do you have to be serious you have to
[39:53] be ready
[39:54] so that when he is ready to use you you
[39:58] are available
[40:00] glory to God you think people that they
[40:03] know
[40:04] the Bible said he was sleeping
[40:07] and the angel of the Lord came to him he
[40:10] said wake up boy
[40:11] there's a way for you to do I have an
[40:14] assignment for you to do tonight
[40:16] Hallelujah
[40:18] I believe you know what let me when God
[40:22] called Philip was not selfish let's read
[40:25] something here
[40:27] hmm Hallelujah
[40:31] The Book of John
[40:34] chapter 1 verse 43-51
[40:43] the day following Jesus would go forth
[40:46] on into Galilee and find itself and said
[40:50] unto him follow me now Faith was
[40:53] Bethesda the city of Andrew and Peter
[40:57] Faith funded Nathaniel and said unto him
[41:01] we have found him
[41:04] and then he said who
[41:06] thank you
[41:07] who are you fine who
[41:10] okay
[41:12] of whom Moses
[41:14] in the law
[41:16] and the prophet did right
[41:19] Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph
[41:23] and Nathaniel said unto him
[41:26] come on boy
[41:28] what do you think about
[41:31] can there any good thing come out from
[41:35] Nazareth
[41:38] come and see
[41:40] by yourself
[41:42] Hallelujah
[41:45] you know when God God called Philip
[41:47] rather where he began to work
[41:51] he didn't waste time
[41:53] he goes he got something special
[41:56] that nobody could ever give it to him
[42:00] only God
[42:02] can give you to him have you found
[42:05] something special tonight
[42:07] in your heart that you you don't want to
[42:10] reveal that into nobody
[42:13] there's a lot of people out there want
[42:15] to hear this
[42:17] I don't challenge you in the name of the
[42:19] Lord Jesus Christ do your work and let
[42:22] the word of God work through your life
[42:25] God is real
[42:27] God is not just talking about him just
[42:30] like that the Bible said when you talk
[42:32] about him he drawn here

[58:45] James 2 26.

[59:59] that's the way the gospel work
[1:00:02] everything is there God has already
[1:00:04] prepared and the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:07] demonstrated to us and the prophet of
[1:00:09] God William Brown has demonstrated to us

[1:02:51] do you think those stories are just
[1:02:54] stories it's reality
[1:02:57] I see some
[1:03:00] I know that these brothers have seen all
[1:03:03] the time brother someone talks to us
[1:03:05] about all the time
[1:03:07] when you read brother Abraham the same
[1:03:09] thing you see all the time
[1:03:12] so this is not a myth this is reality
[1:03:16] the gospel is real
[1:03:18] Hallelujah
[1:03:21] God has quoted so many years
[1:03:24] we've been so faithful to be in his
[1:03:28] presence all the time then whether
[1:03:31] sunshine or Reign you see you think God
[1:03:33] doesn't see that
[1:03:35] he see you all the time
[1:03:38] oh what you have to do is you shake
[1:03:40] yourself Bradley
[1:03:42] let us Shake ourselves
[1:03:44] and let the reality come imprave you
[1:03:48] in our life
[1:03:50] as I said it would it will give us
[1:03:53] energy
[1:03:56] it will make it it will rise up your
[1:03:58] faith more
[1:04:00] so that when you go you can speak
[1:04:05] someone said all the time you pray for
[1:04:07] Wednesday
[1:04:08] he said if you pray you pray you pray
[1:04:10] one day
[1:04:11] you're gonna find yourself praying for
[1:04:14] somebody and something great happen
[1:04:17] because your prayers you can do nothing
[1:04:20] it's God does the work of the prayer
[1:04:24] so all what you have to do surrender
[1:04:28] unpaid Yourself clean yourself
[1:04:31] make yourself ready make yourself worthy
[1:04:34] for the gospel
[1:04:36] if you if you do what you're supposed to
[1:04:39] do the rest God will do it by himself
[1:04:44] Hallelujah you don't have to do nothing
[1:04:55] if you not get yourself ready in the
[1:04:58] church
[1:05:00] and some some of the Brethren good
[1:05:03] against themselves ready in the church
[1:05:06] do you believe and always
[1:05:11] practicing their faith
[1:05:14] believing
[1:05:16] out of setting goals that are using that
[1:05:19] person
[1:05:21] and then you sit down on the pew
[1:05:25] and every day the person will come and
[1:05:28] say God is God is God because of your
[1:05:31] lack of faith
[1:05:33] and the work that you are not doing
[1:05:35] right
[1:05:36] same time you create a room for yourself
[1:05:39] to save time to come in and then you're
[1:05:42] gonna fill it in with what jealousy
[1:05:45] because you create a vacuum
[1:05:48] there and Satan that's why Satan was and
[1:05:51] then when the brother or the sister
[1:05:53] comes and give testimony oh look what
[1:05:55] he's doing well every time no
[1:05:59] because you
[1:06:01] are not doing the work
[1:06:03] and then since then you allow Satan to
[1:06:06] come then to criticize what God is using
[1:06:09] the other person
[1:06:12] this is real because we are in the move
[1:06:17] now God is in the move
[1:06:20] because every time the plane have to
[1:06:23] take off he has to warmed the Aging
[1:06:27] very hard so with a few distance he has
[1:06:30] to take off so God is warming the church
[1:06:34] the Rapture the Rapture is about to take
[1:06:37] off
[1:06:38] so he has to take off with the pressure
[1:06:41] Hallelujah you have to crystallize to
[1:06:44] yourself
[1:06:45] the astronaut they have to go to
[1:06:46] pressure pressure room so that they can
[1:06:49] they can absorb the atmosphere then when
[1:06:52] they're going in there

[1:09:31] God chose brother Abraham he didn't know

[1:09:37] a voice spoke to him on the tree
[1:09:42] he didn't ask for that he was running

[1:09:50] are you ready
[1:09:52] be ready brother in this is not a joke
[1:09:55] this is reality
[1:09:58] I am happy to be a Christian
[1:10:02] the Bible is a Christian never die
[1:10:15] but not this body
[1:10:17] there's another body that's beautiful
[1:10:19] than him now
[1:10:21] that's where we're gonna see each and
[1:10:23] everyone
[1:10:25] with a sparkling eye
[1:10:27] are we gonna talk to Abraham
[1:10:30] there's no age no time to talk to
[1:10:33] Abraham you can see that how much you
[1:10:36] want Isaiah you read Isaiah Hallelujah
[1:10:41] you read me a mayor you read over there
[1:10:44] you read this one you read we're gonna
[1:10:46] see all of them there and there's no
[1:10:49] time to have fellowship with them

[1:10:53] you're gonna have fellowship with
[1:10:55] mercies as much as you want
[1:10:58] Hallelujah
[1:10:59] thank you Jesus
[1:11:03] what
[1:11:05] something God has given to us
[1:11:08] there's no word can explain this thing
[1:11:11] that we are talking about you have no
[1:11:13] words
[1:11:15] it's a paradox
[1:11:16] that we're sitting here
[1:11:20] and we said we're not gonna die
[1:11:22] when you talk like that outside somebody
[1:11:25] will hit your hand with a broom
[1:11:28] Hallelujah
[1:11:30] thank you Jesus that is a paradise and
[1:11:32] it's real
[1:11:34] you think we just come here and talk and
[1:11:36] talk and go this is real
[1:11:39] because we saw it Philip
[1:11:43] Peter
[1:11:45] Thomas
[1:11:47] remember when the Lord Jesus Christ woke
[1:11:50] up
[1:11:51] after the resolution
[1:11:53] he came to the room
[1:11:56] and the people didn't believe him
[1:11:59] he saw Thomas come on
[1:12:01] you don't you've done all the things
[1:12:04] that I told you you don't believe
[1:12:06] all the healing
[1:12:09] everything that I did
[1:12:11] until unless you see it come and see
[1:12:14] he gave him opportunity come and feel it
[1:12:18] if you don't beat it cannot feel it
[1:12:21] then he went really he went and finished
[1:12:25] this my my God this is real
[1:12:29] this is real
[1:12:32] the same thing we talking here is real
[1:12:37] it's not just how I cannot see
[1:12:40] don't it's just talking no it's not just
[1:12:43] a talk but someone or his lifetime
[1:12:48] his pen
[1:12:50] in the presence of God
[1:12:52] since the time when he was 14.
[1:12:56] if it's not real how can he stand there
[1:12:59] after today
[1:13:04] for the gospel because the gospel is
[1:13:07] real
[1:13:09] brethren
[1:13:11] let us join together
[1:13:13] and believing that everything that we
[1:13:16] hear here is real
[1:13:18] it's not just the words
[1:13:19] all the songs that we're seeking for the
[1:13:22] inspiration song
[1:13:23] it's real
[1:13:24] people Inspire and wrote them how do
[1:13:28] they get the songs there happiness songs
[1:13:30] and angels and this you think this is a
[1:13:32] myth this is reality
[1:13:35] Hallelujah
[1:13:37] thank you Lord
[1:13:39] I'm gonna read a little things for you
[1:13:41] here when brother Abraham
[1:13:43] let me tell you this world here
[1:13:47] it's true spirit
[1:13:49] one is against you
[1:13:52] and one is the one who's taking you to
[1:13:54] heaven
[1:13:55] it's real
[1:13:57] problem said you don't believe that he
[1:14:01] said I speak to the demon every day he
[1:14:04] said it's real
[1:14:06] they stand face to face and speak to me
[1:14:09] it's not like a fresh here he said you
[1:14:12] could see he's speaking to you
[1:14:14] my friend we are living
[1:14:17] in the world that your eye cannot see
[1:14:20] outside there if God could open your
[1:14:22] eyes to see it over there you run and
[1:14:25] sleep here every night
[1:14:28] Africa we see things real
[1:14:32] physically

[1:20:08] way back Yonder gift and calling are
[1:20:11] without repentance you are at least a
[1:20:14] preacher and carry a preacher by general
[1:20:18] orders
[1:20:19] are to pray for the sake
[1:20:22] not only preachers but the by the
[1:20:26] Deacons
[1:20:27] and the lay members pray one for another

[1:20:34] right to pray for the sake as I
[1:20:38] brother Boswell brother bastard brother
[1:20:41] Robert Roberts or any other man there is
[1:20:47] and what does them do men do the only
[1:20:50] thing that they can do is preach the
[1:20:53] word of God so clear that you see it and
[1:20:56] accept it there's nothing in the man
[1:20:59] that will heal nothing in his prayer
[1:21:02] that would heal it is not you are here
[1:21:07] here stood a guy standing here maybe
[1:21:10] he's standing here
