earlier on in the weekend and uh and then everything that's going on in the last couple of days it is um yeah I keep listening for a different a different sound how many are hearing a different sound put that that for us please well we hear about the wars see famine in the Land There are questions in the little children's eyes trouble in the East again and the whole world is shaking there's no sure place to stand and mournful sounds are heard throughout the L but I keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that John saw coming down the sound of the Bride being united with the gro the sound of the chorus singing Glory To The Man oh I keep listening I L I can list for oh I remember the prophet saying son it shall come to pass there will come a generation that will be the last I now believe we're standing here we're seeing the end of time and a prophet's voice [Music] isting oh I keep listening for a different s the sound of the city that John saw coming down of theed oh the sound of the Glorious Singing Glory to the I keep listening I keep listening I for a we're almost home we're almost home we've got a mansion waiting and we're almost home we're almost home we're all home we've got a mansion waiting sing it what you well they took the Apostle Peter and stoned him or and or but he would not deny the Lord as he had done before they hung him by his feet to die they thought he was alone he turned his face toward heaven and said I'm almost home said I'm almost we're almost home we've got a mansion waiting and we're [Music] almost just sing that second verse and that brother Danny give it to us well they took the prophet John out of the AIS to die but he had got good connections with the man up in the sky God showed him the New Jerusalem they thought he was alone he said it's not so hard to die when I can see my said I'm almost holy [Music] I'm all all I've got a Manion waiting and I'm almost oh yes I'm [Music] almost I've got a Manion waiting and [Music] I'm almost I've Got a Mansion waiting and I'm almost [Music] hallelujah praise God amen glory to God yes we are we're almost home Saints and we know that by the by the signs of the sky and by what the Lord is doing in this hour uh he's making himself known amen that we are definitely almost home amen praise God God bless you Saints um thank you very much musicians song leader thank you brother Mike praise God that was a wonderful song service we are certainly listening for a different sound in this hour we've got to know the sound that we that that we that we need to be listening to we need to recognize the word that God is uh giving us in our day making known to us in this day and in this hour amen praise God I trust you're all uh very um hungry this morning amen praise God because the Lord he wants to bless us he wants to pour His word into us he wants to anoint us he wants to give us exactly what we have need of but you've got to be under that kind of expectation amen you've got to believe that you've come into the house of the Lord into the presence of the Lord amen praise God where God will make all things possible praise the Lord amen so um first of all we want to remember brother um Peter Chandler's Pastor uh Peter Chandler from London England he passed away this past week and we want to remember his family and his congregation because it was uh kind of all of a sudden that uh that he passed away and now the church is kind of um you know looking for for a new leader because it happened just automatically just fast just like that and you just don't know when the Lord is going to call but the Lord the Lord has a reason you know he has a purpose and one by one we will gain the portal to be with the immortal we don't know our time we know that there's a time to be born and we also know that there is a time to die but then we're in a time of the Rapture and so for us we're under a different kind of expectation as long as the Lord doesn't take us physically naturally now then he's taken us in the body change amen it's as simple as that that's that's what we believe that's how we see the word of God we're living in that day and that's what excites us as the Sons and Daughters of god so let's remember them uh remember his family remember his congregation that the Lord will provide Pastor Simon knows him he actually ministered um in London there just a few years ago and uh was with brother Chandler so um you know I've never met him but uh Pastor Simon did get to meet him a couple of years ago and and was with them there so uh praise God Amen so now now let's um let's move on to what the Lord has for us today how many knows that we're still in the in the Passover season we're still in the Easter season amen praise God it's always Easter for us you know and I was I was looking to see this year Passover begins actually for the you know for the Hebrews for the Jews uh Monday April the 22nd so next Monday uh at sundown and it ends on Tuesday April the 30th at sundown you know so um this is the English calendar the Hebrew calendar it's their first month right April is actually the first month in the Hebrew calendar ours is January for the Hebrews it's April right and so um you know when we look at Israel and we look at what's going on right now we know that Israel is God's time piece how many knows that how many understands that right now all these events that are taking place around the Middle East and around Israel is exactly in direct correlation to the mystical body of Jesus Christ The Church of Jesus Christ and so we need to see the parallels we need to see what's actually going on and recognize that it has everything to do with us all right because Israel is the natural type of the spiritual bride of Jesus Christ the church that is uniting with Christ right now in this hour Israel is being tested right now to the very core they're being tested on their faith and they're saying we are not going to move until we take the enemy's head off and I believe that the same Revelation is living within us that we are the church we are the the the the ones that that God has revealed his word to by his grace okay we didn't choose him he chose us amen it was not something that we decided God chose Israel God did not it wasn't Israel that chose them God chose them he says they shall be my people and I shall be their God okay when Jacob and Esau were were born he says Jacob I love Esau I hate we cannot alter God's plan God's program and what it is that God is doing in this day and in this hour but because God has given us ears to hear I to see and recognize what God is doing in this hour we can see all of this and recognize that this has everything to do with us the timing on everything is not a coincidence these signs and these Wonders that we've been witnessing over the last you know several years and and in particular the last seven years with the 2017 eclipse and the 2024 Eclipse these things are are significant okay I I don't know why God just put it all over me to you know to dig into it and you know Wednesday night we dug into a lot of the facts that surround it and a lot of the things that that that we're seeing there but I do know that God is a supernatural God I do know that God declares his first Bible in the heavens before he does anything on Earth he declares it in the heavens we know that for a fact I know that God is a supernatural God I have had experience experiences and you who are children of God that have actually met God know that you have an experience with God and that these signs are not just happen sense they're not just things that just happened they come and they go they have a purpose and they're directly correlated to the word of God Amen praise God and so in in looking into all of this here today we are going to be looking at things that that we that we already know okay all I know Saints is I don't understand every single sign okay let's make that clear I'm not coming out here as a as a minister and saying this is how it's going to be this is what it is this no God is his own interpreter I am going to bring to you exactly what God has placed upon my heart to bring to you and then it's up to the Holy Spirit to reveal directly to you how it is that you fit in into the whole thing I know how I'm seeing my part in the word I know I'm seeing the part that God has given me and now I'm stepping into my position by obeying the Lord in what he's revealed to me and what he said tell the people and so by by all of these events and and it's going to there's no way we're going to be able to finish all of this today it's going to probably finish into next Sunday okay and I'm very excited about what God is revealing okay and and uh it's not because oh he's just revealing it to Pastor Danny no no God has ministers all over the Earth just like he had the three wise men they were in different parts of the world but when God Drew their attention to the stars and Drew their attention to what they knew according to the word and according to the sages of what they had been told and they put one in one together and they saw the lining up of the stars all three of them saw the exact same thing and they were drawn to the Messiah they were drawn to the word amen and so we as Ministers of the Gospel we operate in exactly the same way because God has given us these callings for us to be able to recognize the word of God draw from it pull it down bring it into our own experiences and then convey it unto the people the people that are in the midst of this Ministry and that are going to be hearing these words are going to be able to see how they fit into the word and what their part is and how significant it is to God Amen all I can tell you is that these things that the Lord is showing me I can't even put them to words all I can do is try to express it to you but there's there were things that I was seeing over the last week that I was just getting up and walking around and wondering my God this is this is it it can't be but it is it's just the way it is and so these are the things that we're going to convey to you and I trust that as we we move into it that your your heart and your mind is open to the understanding that that we are moving in a supernatural this church is not a regular on the street New Street Church oh yeah I've seen that church yeah it is a church building but it's not the building it's the people in the building that are with the god that's in the building and that's what makes the true church is when the Holy Spirit is in the church speaking to the needs of the people and when they come in it's like they're going into a into the shakina glory of God some will come in with with with uh sickness some will come in with blindness some will come in with with hurts and pains and then they'll leave here rejoicing why because they went and heard a sermon from Pastor Dany no because they entered into the presence of the Lord and they had already met God and knew that God was a reality it's not something that you just you know you you just oh I'm going to go to church and that'll be the moment that I that I I hear some nice words and and the pastor is going to bring a nice message oh and it sounds really good that's not really what church is all about church is when you come into the shakina glory of God with expectation in your heart and you're going to leave because you've you walked in with a supernatural experience and you're leaving with a supernatural experience amen praise God so I trust that that that this word that's going to come forth will do and change and alter your walks and and allow you to to to be stirred to look and to check yourself to remind yourself of the things that God has already done in your life because if you've met God God becomes a reality to you nobody can and take that from you amen praise God forever more now now we can go to the word praise God Amen let's go to the word Luke chapter 21 25-28 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring Saints is that not the time that we're living in right now men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth people are in fear people don't know what to make of all these events what's going on yesterday there was an attack on Israel again over 300 missiles coming into Israel from Iran these are these are not just you know simple events that are just happening in the midst of a Middle East war no no these are significant event Saints praise God Amen and people are are are under under fear they don't know what to do they don't understand what's coming on the earth earthquakes over here tsunamis over here flooding over there all kinds of things for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken amen and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory and when these things begin to come to pass look up and lift up your heads amen for your Redemption draw nigh God bless you you may be seated next slide brother Bram says here and then every sign has a voice behind it and the voice must be a scriptural voice the same as it must be a scriptural sign and then the sign is accompanied by a voice like Moses when he went down into Egypt the voice of the first sign the voice of the second sign and every great thing that happens with God that gives a sign there's a voice that follows that sign like Jonah when he was delivered from the belly of the whale that was a sign then his his voice was repent or in 40 days you'll perish so there's always the voice going with the sign praise God forever more you know um brother brandham here in uh 1964 he says here uh also Christ is identified the same in all generations and then every sign has a voice behind it and the voice must be a scriptural voice and the same as it must be a scriptural sign okay we just read that we need to understand that in every age God has a voice God will have somebody in representation of himself making himself known making himself real and we understand that that voice can only be in the resurrected body of Jesus Christ because it's his voice amen so the resurrection that's why he says you know uh the sign of Jonah because Jonah was in the belly three days and then three nights and then on the third day he come out of the belly of the whale walked out onto the street all all into Nineveh and started to to preach repentance under the people or God was going to destroy them in 40 days and so God's voice was in Jonah telling the people what had taken place letting them know what God was going to to do and make known to the people that they either turn to God or they're going to be destroyed amen praise God and so these signs when God sends a sign it's because God is going to send a message God has a message in this day God has a message in this hour God has a message today for each and every one of us do we have our spiritual thinking caps on Amen praise God listen here in psalm 147 God is calling us to his attention listen he says praise ye the Lord for it is good to sing praises unto our God for it is pleasant and praise is calmly the Lord doth build up Jerusalem he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel listen remember what I said when when when we're talking about Israel we're talking about the church there's still some outcasts out there there's still some that need to awaken to recognize what God is doing in this hour so that they can be pulled in to the body he gathereth together the outcast he Health the broken hearts and bindeth up their wounds he he tth the number of the Stars he calleth them all by their names amen praise God God is still calling God is still calling Sons and Daughters of God but we need to recognize we need to recognize the signs we need to see what the voice is telling us we need to realize listen brother brandham said that uh you know in if you go back and if you get a chance this week go back and listen to the message uniting sign and time okay uniting time and sign okay it's either that way or that way but go back and listen to that because that's going to come into uh re relevance next Sunday when we come together because things are happening there's a uniting that's going on right now there's uniting of the of the of the churches there's a uniting of the of of Israel amen they're they're they're coming back together again they're standing in their position they're they're being told that they will not uh you know by their leadership that they will not give up one ounce of the land this shall never happen again they've United together they're in one mind under one inspiration just as the bride is uniting but but then you've got the World Council of churches that are uniting then you've got the Nations that are uniting they're all uniting around coming against Israel in the same way that the churches are uniting together to come against the word of God because the word they're saying no no we have to have a a universal Christianity we have to have one that everybody can fit into God says separate yourselves God says I am the word and and and the word is God and and if the word is God and we have the word then we can't do or believe anything but the word because we live the word we are the word we are the manifestation of the word just like Israel are God's chosen people they can't help but be who they are and because they are who they are and they stand on that position God stands with them hallelujah praise God everything everything that that uh uh you know is taking place now with these signs go to the next slide and so what we're going to be talking about here today and today we're going to be laying in a foundation of a lot of things that we already know but it's going to remind us of the progression of what God is doing and we're going to be looking at the fact that the bride's voice is the last sign if there's going to any voice in the land right now it's the church it's the bride and it's Israel Israel is taking their stand okay they're taking their stand and they're saying we are not going to submit listen it it's not Israel that's going out and bombing the Esau lineage okay Israel is in their Homeland that God gave them they're not they're not the ones that are going out and and and bombing and and killing in other people's countries they are coming and infiltrating and bombing them all right they're talking and they're saying that that Israel is committing genocide genocide is when you try to eliminate a race of people a total race of people that's not what Israel is trying to do okay Israel is trying to stand on the word that God gave them the land that God gave them and and you cannot change the word of God God gave it to them there's nothing that anybody can do to take it they're going to gather themselves around Israel the all the nations are going to gather they're already starting to talk that they're G to that they're that they're you know they're saying oh you know they're saying oh they're committing genocide they're killing people meanwhile what took place back in October they're not you know they need to recognize that they were attacked it was it was it was Hamas it was the it was the enemy the devil that that that went in and and raped and killed and murdered uh you know innocent people okay it was a provoked attack they say that you know that that you know Israel you know was was was uh uh you know causing problems within Gaza stuff no Israel was trying to just uh protect their own land Hamas over the last 10 10 years has been digging tunnels in and through uh Gaza and and and penetrating in all different areas because they have one purpose you know that you know that lineage has one purpose and that is to destroy and they have the idea of genocide they want to eliminate and Destroy every Jewish individual on the planet if they can do it it's the same spirit that was on Hitler amen okay and so we need to recognize I know the people listen it's when you hear the news and and you hear them talking about oh little innocent children are being killed and that's War it's terrible it's terrible but whenever there's war and people are fighting against each other there's going to be collateral damage but what happens is if you start to emphasize only on the actual collateral damage and and not recognize the reasons behind everything then you lose sight of the reality of who you are and the bride cannot lose reality in sight of who she is in the word of God and that God has a church that is going to listen and obey his word that are going to live by his word that are going to say no baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ it's not into the titles of son Father Son and Holy Ghost she's going to stand on the word and say there is no three Gods there's only one god Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new the Messiah the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God not was God's was God and so Emmanuel God With Us he went and took our place as a man in a human body but it was God that was in that body that's why he's the only one that could resurrect himself from from the dead because he is life he is the only life and so Israel knows that they know that God is going to stand with them regardless of what comes against them if they surround them and the Bible and the prophecy shows very clearly that this is going to happen we could get into all kinds of scripture to show you that they shall surround Israel and they are going to they're going to try and Destroy Israel but God is going to supernaturally deliver them out of the midst of the destruction Hallelujah and he's going to do the same for you're not going into tribulation you're not going into the tribulation that's coming upon this Earth listen things are not getting better you don't even have to be a Christian to see that all you got to do is turn CNN on and you can find out world events and things that are happening that this world is falling apart you can do a search on on on YouTube earthquakes current earthquakes you'll probably get five six current earthquakes Tremors over here Tremors over there what is it the Earth is in birth pains they're talking about the Earth that it's that it's that it's heating up do you know that this month is the 10th month in a row that we have broken records for global temperatures in the history since they've been monitoring it what is that why why why is it that that the that the Earth is is heating up oh the scripture says oh behold this Earth as an oven should burn Hallelujah there's going to be there's going to be uh things that are going to happen now there's a time and a season for it all to come but it's it's in progress It's happening around us we need to recognize that it's taking place and people need to need to understand that it's that it is the reality amen and so these signs and these things that are taking place around us it's important for us to realize it's bringing prophecy to pass it is it is the being declared in the heavens and then it is being declared on the earth Hallelujah let's go to the next slide now we saw this slide here on Wednesday night and I'm not going to get into all the details of it again but I just want you to realize that you know if you look at the slides that I've been putting up you'll notice in the corner you'll see like like the American flag because everything is surrounding America listen we got to recognize that God sent a prophet out of America that's where God sent the prophet God God sent signs and wonders out of America to America because America is like a type of the Gentile that that that that where the Gentile bride has come out of where the Gentiles have received the word for their day where they've been turned back to the faith of the fathers and it's all judgment towards America these two solar eclipses they declared that they they they called them the Great American solar eclipses because they they went from one end to the other on the 17th you'll see the one that comes down from the left down the one from the right down that's the one that was 2024 you'll notice that there's a big X over America and if you go back into the scriptures you'll see that x what it represents and and it's basically you're done you're finished amen there's no hope except for the coming of the Lord listen America as a nation as much as there's a lot of preachers out there that want to say oh America still has a chance they can repent as as a nation no they can't the nation is finished I listen I'm not I'm not telling you this because you know it's what I believe it's because that's what God is declaring God decare it through a Vindicated prophet of William maryiam Branham when he indicted that generation of the United States of America for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ when they when they rejected the word of God they rejected God's sign to this generation and to do that will bring judgment now on the other hand there's still people in America individuals that can still receive the message of Salvation that can still receive the power of the Holy Ghost to deliver them From The Snare of the Great Tribulation that's going to come down upon this Earth and so if there's a message the message is personal the mer the message is to the individual and it's and it's the same message repent turn away from your ungodliness and turn to God and receive his spirit amen and salvation shall come to you and to your home praise God hallelujah amen go to the next slide Hallelujah now we know that we just came sorry I double clicked on that one okay so this next slide here the only reason I'm showing you this one here is because you'll notice this was the one for 2017 the one that has the uh the the green blue lines there the other one that crosses through from bottom to the right that's the 2024 do you know there was another eclipse that took place in October of 2023 right around the time of the attack on Israel which was yam Kapur right at that time and that Eclipse when I put it into the page and I put the because I saw the two there 2024 and the one from there and then I said oh wait a minute let me put the one from 2017 in there it created an A and it just spoke and said I am Alpha I am the Omega I am the first I am the last I have the first say I have the last say everything that is going on I am de claring it in the heavens and the people shall know that I am God they will know that I will give them a testimony that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that there's no other God except Jehovah God his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God and if we go to the next slide just a reminder that you know brother brandham saw the ages and saw the amount of life light that was in every age and I found it very interesting that when I looked into this and because I realized that you know that there was a sliver of light that was going to be given to the to to the church because it was it went into total darkness by the time brother brandham was on the earth and he was the seventh angel messenger just like you know you got to go back and do your history here you know St Paul was the first one then there's irius then there was St Martin Columba then Martin Luther who broke away from the Catholic church then there was John Wesley and then came William Mariam brandham Elijah the prophet okay he was under the ministry of a Vindicated major prophet to restore the word of God in our day amen praise God otherwise we'd still be in confusion we wouldn't know what church to believe because by the time you get to Wesley you've got so many different denominations and so many different interpretations on God's Bible that you don't know what to believe but God always reveals it unto his servants the prophets and so he gave us a a Slimmer of light because William brandham was going to restore the word and it was going to be a minority it's always been a minority amen listen don't be going to look you know thinking but you know people will say how is it that these people are believing this message this William Branham no you know hardly anybody's ever heard of him if you do a search online you're going to get one extreme that says he was a cult leader you're going to get another extreme that says he was God he was he was a portion of Prophecy being fulfilled in our day he fulfilled Malachi 4:5 he fulfilled Revelations 10 1-7 if you had have gone back in the days of Jesus and you would have seen this man John the Baptist he was a hairy man he was a man of the Wilderness he was screaming out to the people telling them repent repent the coming of the Lord a lot of people all the Pharisees the all the big churches of the day they looked and they said what is this noise going on over here who is this guy that's look at him he doesn't even shave he he looks like a bum you know and then you listen to William brandom and you listen to the way he talks in his vocabulary and people say man you can did the guy have any kind of an education yeah he had grade five education but he had something that that that a grade five education uh is is totally irrelevant to he had the spirit of the Living God in him and I challenge anybody to go back and listen or read his messages and you tell me if that's a grade five education that's speaking through those tapes or if that isn't the the supernatural inspired Spirit of the Living God speaking through a man that was able to to to to bring truths and understanding on the churches and and the mysteries of God in such a way it had to be God that's why God will not lift up a man I don't care how many llds or phds a man has or how many times he's been to theological school that ain't going to get you any closer to God you need to be you need to repent get on your knees and pray that God reveals himself to you because it's when you meet God that everything changes praise God it's not about you going to Seminary school and trying to figure out God you can't figure out God praise God forever more and so if you go to the next Slide the reason why I brought this up is because if you look uh the Leo Dean Church age is supposed to be the shortest Church age and when you look at this and you look at Ephesus which was the shortest in comparison to the other six okay you'll see that it started in ad 53 and it ended in ad. 170 and that was 118 years and leod deia started in 1906 and if we add 118 years where do we end up today okay so what time are we living in and remember this was all God calling out a gentile church this is to the Gentiles this is not to the Muslim this is not now if there's a gentile in the Muslim that has the spirit of God and an attribute of God God brings them out of the Muslim and makes them a son or daughter and and and and identifies them as a son or a daughter of God you don't make Sons and Daughters you identify when you can recognize the word for your day there's a lot of Muslims that came out of that teaching and came right into this message and are Born Again Believers of this message amen there's Che there's there's churches in mus Muslim nations that believe exactly what what I'm preaching here this morning that have the same revelation of God that God sent a prophet in this day to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and so when we look at that now I'm not saying that that that that oh the Rapture is going to happen this year I'm not saying that but could the Gentile dispensation be over could it be could it be that that that that sign of the Moon completely overshadowing the sun could that be a complete blackout again and could this be the one because you know there's not another one now until 2044 and so what what day are we living in what is it speaking to you what is it telling you what is it is it bringing you to to a place where you where where you recognize wait a minute here these things are actually happening this this the we're in 2024 I remember talking about this in in 2000 I remember sitting talking with brother Tim with other brothers we Fellowship around the word of God so oh boy the the year 2000 I wonder what's going to happen in the year 2000 but the one thing that was always in the back of my our minds was yeah but you know the prophet said that the Le Dean age you know uh we could still have another 24 years and we thought oh man another 24 years well here we are we are I don't know not remember what I said at the beginning I'm not saying this is going to happen that's G to I'm just G to tell you what God has laid upon my heart and what I'm going to express and and then and then the Lord he's his own interpreter he's going to make it plain let's continue on here listen uh uh I'm going to read a scripture here okay you can go to the next slide Matthew 16 3-4 the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came tempting desired him that he should that he would show them a sign from Heaven he answered and said unto them when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh ye Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times you know the people are looking to get an understanding of the signs o of the times and here it is it's right in front of them you walk into your your work and you're reading a uh you know a or you're listening to a message from last Sunday's service and and and you're rejoicing around the word of God and then you get so excited that you know you sit down to lunch and you want to tell them hey do you know what's going on did you know what happened over these last you know seven years we we had two total solar eclipses and did you know that God you know has has sent a a message in this day and and and to to recognize what's going on you see we're we're we're actually experiencing it but you know but but the people are just looking for signs but they don't they the answer is right there the an is in the word of God the answer is living in your life you you want them to listen to you but they won't even sit long enough to listen to the word of God and they want to just believe what they want to believe or they want to follow some you know some new age teaching he says discern the face of the guy but he cannot discern the signs of the time a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet Jonah there it is again and he left them and departed the sign of the prophet Jonah now listen here brother Braham speaking a greater than Solomon is here he says now he referred to Jonah he's talking about the scripture that he just read and I believe that what he told Jonah he was speaking of this day he was actually speaking of this day God listen the Lord Jesus knew the timing but he didn't know when exactly he says that's all in the in the in the mind of the Father which is my spirit in its time and season everything is going to come to pass he knew the part that he was fulfilling right there and then he was in a human body he had to learn obedience to that human body he had to walk in a human body he had to be tempted the Bible says he was tempted just like any other man was tempted he did not know he said no that's all being left to the great Plan of Redemption that is already in the mind of God from before the foundations of the world but in his in his condition as as a son that's why he said I only do what the father shows me he realized that he was in a human body and he was limited to this human body he knew that he had to go to Calvary to and and actually die in order for his Spirit to be released back to go back to the father okay and so remember people say that you know yeah but Jesus the father up in heaven Jesus on Earth no God had a plan so he created himself a body called the name of the body Jesus so that it could be filled with his Spirit to go to Calvary to take our place and you are in a human body right now and you can only see what you can see because of this Veil that you're that that that you're in now you see in part but when you when you're changed into your Immortal body you shall see yourself as you actually are that's the same type as Jesus and us here in these human bodies that's why we can only see what we can see and what God reveals to us we're limited by this human Veil that we're trapped in amen and so here he says I believe that that he told Jonah he was speaking of this day now he said they were seeking a sign and they would get a sign the sign of the Resurrection that's the sign that's here now we are filled with the spirit of of God and we've been resurrected by a new birth out of our spiritual Amnesia that we were that we came in under our natural birth because when you're naturally born you come through a human vessel and there's blood there's water and then you get filled with your soul which is the spirit all all three the soul the spirit and you know the blood the spirit and the water right all all three it's a type and here when you come into the Dimension you come into these human bodies and you go through what's called spiritual Amnesia you actually don't know who you are until you come into the new birth amen that's why Jesus said you must be born again a child is the Bi Bible says born in sin shaped in iniquity speaking lies so how can you take a baby and baptize it and and say that's that's it it's Justified it's been bapt AP ized never needs to be baptized doesn't need to repent doesn't need to actually fulfill or obey the word of God it's a lie it's a lie of the enemy every individual must be born again by the word of God by a supernatural experience by meeting God face to face and know that you've come in contact with the word of God Amen praise God and so for Jo was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights the son of man shall be in the heart of the Earth for three days and nights and then the resurrection would be the sign to the wicked and adulterous generation anyone knows that scripture has a compound meaning and history repeats itself do you believe scripture has a compound meaning all right take where it's this one here just comes in my mind where in Matthew chapter 3 it said out of Egypt called my son run the reference to that and see if it didn't mean Jacob certainly it did Jacob God's son it meant Jesus God's son it has a compound prophecy many times has it and so I believe that we've come back to a wicked and an adulterous generation and this generation has to receive the sign of the Resurrection to Dove tail with my first first night's sermon the signs that he did then he's never done them since in all the age until the closing of the Gentile dispensation listen the closing of the Gentile dispensation started with William Mariam Branham the closing it started with that it's going to end with the bride of Jesus Christ the brides Ministry she will close out the Gentile dispensation she will be the last and final voice to this Gentile generation and it's saying the same thing turn and come back to the word come back to God you you're you're you're in denominational uh teachings you're under the teachings of man you need to come and be born again personally by a personal revelation of Jesus Jesus Christ you and God hallelujah praise God Amen he's never done them since in all ages until the closing of the Gentiles dispensation that we're now living in and this wicked and adulterous and Christ rejecting generation has received the sign of the Resurrection The Last sign to be given to the church praise God hallelujah listen when brother Brenham went off the scene the Mighty Angel himself came down we're going to be looking at this let's continue on here this is this we've only just begun this is going to get really good Saints I Promise You by next Sunday you're going to be rejoicing because I I you know it says start your message you know it's a like a tip for for ministers right start your message with the end in mind I can't get the end out of my mind because the end in my mind is the spirit of God and the Revelation that he gave me that's stirring my heart and that's given me the inspiration to say all that I'm saying and to do all that I'm doing listen I'm I'm just a man I'm telling you I get scared now every week about coming up here you think I'm kidding you don't understand what this call has put upon my life upon my home it's changed everything Saints I'm telling you and and and it's it's Awakening my my my senses to the spirit of God and that that this is not just you know like you know Church listen I took every single service serious every service I came every you know I I look to my pastor and I I respected that man as God's absolute supreme authority to this church I looked at him and I and I and I would come into the into the services with expectation in my heart and God would speak to me all the the time God would let me leave filled with with with with strength and that's why I needed to be in church I I need to be in this in the prayer I would tell my wife I'd say you know when when the garden centers are going and stuff like that I'm still listening to every message believe me I'm tuning in on those Services when I'm driving down downtown I'm listening to Pastor Simon I'm sending him messages saying praise God I'm rejoicing in the word that you brought forth because I need it it's life and and if it isn't life to you then you you you've missed something because this is the word that's going to change us this is the word that takes us listen you either believe this message or you might as well just go back into the world and forget that you even came across it because you're you listen You'll either become miserable and be in this in this message thinking oh I can get by you need to meet God until you've met God you're playing Church you need the reality of God to come into your life so that you know that this is something that that's real listen I I've had so many Supernatural experiences I I can't even remember half of them anymore it's only once in a while that that the Lord brings to mind a certain thing and I said oh my gosh yes Lord you did that you did this you did that and and especially this week he was just bringing things back to my remembrance you know through all that you know the studying and what I've been going through and so Saints this is a reality this is something real that's taking place and and so let's just continue on here now when we look we need to understand that that that prophecy for this hour it's not taught I cannot teach you prophecy okay prophecy is caught because it comes by Revelation okay everything that we're going to be looking at here and we're going to be going through I want you to just allow the spirit of God just like I did this week all I did was he says go listen to this okay go watch this go listen to that read this read that and I was just doing it I was just doing it like like mechanically because I because half the week I was walking around and I was and I and I've got like anxiety I'm just telling you you got to pray for me okay because I I'm Lord I don't want to get up there and freeze I don't want to get up there and and and and and not have anything you know but this is the thing that you know that's the fight and then I I don't even want to get into some of the things that happened the phone calls that I got and the situations that came up and the emergencies that came up and all these things all in the midst of it all and getting so caught up into a situation that I had to go and pray myself out of that situation spend an hour just there just just quiet just quiet just didn't didn't allow any thought to come into my mind until he started to drop thoughts and he started to reveal things and then I would just get back up and i' say thank you Lord and I'd feel the inspiration again this is what we're listen this this is the reality of this message either we enter in and we allow the Holy Spirit to give us all that we need or we're going to miss it we're going to be just like the rest of them oh did you see that sign oh that was so interesting oh that was oh yeah that was interesting interesting what did it speak to your heart what's it revealing to you what is it showing you where do you stand in the midst of all of this are you going to be one of those that the bomb is going to land on or are you going to be one that's going to be rejoicing in a three and a half year celebration in the Rapture of a meeting in the air because the Rapture is a reality ity it is something that we are this this is the rapture we're already in the Rapture you that have already been you you know you've met God you've you you're in the Rapture because you met God because the the the God is the body of Christ and when you've come into that body you are now a part of that Rapture you're that body is going to be quickened it's not you personally it's you in the body that's going to get caught into it because you're a part of the body and you're going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye amen praise God Matthew 2430 says and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory now we're going to be looking at here in the next half an hour there's no way we're going to get through all of this okay there's just way too much but please be patient go back you know after we get through it relisten to it again draw from it and and get into the anointing and the atmosphere of what God is revealing to us praise God now first of all as before I go into all of this I want to acknowledge brother Pastor Chad Lamb back in 2014 he brought a message what is the attraction on the mountain the Lord led him to bring a message on the cloud and he brought it and I listened to that I remember when I listened to it like 10 years ago for the first time and I thought wow I was rejoicing praise God because the Lord anointed him at a time where there was an attack on the cloud and on the mess message of the hour because the enemy was attacking like crazy at that time and it's interesting because when I listen to the message this week right at the end of the service brother Chad goes into uh how Israel is under a great attack right now how he was talking about how Hamas had had built all these underground tunnels and and and all of this was going on and Israel was was standing on the word of God and the enemy was trying to infiltrate their their their their land trying to infiltrate and he was he was typing it to the body of Christ and saying how the enemy is trying to infiltrate and turn us back trying to turn us away from our faith by by by giving us battles and by hitting us here and hitting us there and and and infiltrating with with lying Spirits coming up and saying oh the cloud was just some you know some that that came off of a off of a jet and and it and it moved and the and the and the smoke and they came up with all kinds of different interpretations on what it could have been I'm saying to you we're going to look at it now we're g to we're going to be reminded of it all and we're going to see how perfect God is and then we're going to see how it's pertains to our day and how it's now in progress and how it's bringing us to this day because that's what that's what I'm excited about that's what's that that's what's stirring in my heart on how this is all progressing and bringing us to the day that we're in and so I want to give him uh acknowledgement on that the Lord inspired him and used him in a in a miraculous way to bring out a lot of the of the facts that I'm going to bring to you scripturally and uh so uh praise God for that but then there's something in it for you there's something in it for you if you can catch my mind and and and and the mind of the Lord and in what he's revealed here and get into it and pay attention you will catch what what what the spirit of God is trying to say to us remember the final voice the final voice we're listening for that voice and the voice and where and wherever Christ is that's where the voice is amen praise God and so every sign from God has a scriptural Vindication and a scriptural voice to that sign the cloud sign and the voice of that sign and so in 1962 here uh in this the the sign is this the sign of the answer brother brandom he says look then look to the Capstone was not interpreted see now this is one year and a couple of months before sorry this is uh no uh a couple of months three months it was February the 28th 1963 that the cloud actually came down on Sunset mountain and here we are two months before it actually took place and brother brandham speaking here so I want you to see here that God had already shown him what was going to be coming remember William brandham was a Vindicated prophet of God people need to know that they need to go back and study his ministry and catch and pay attention and actually and actually pray and ask the Lord to show them what what what is actually taking place through that Ministry because to miss his ministry you'll miss this right it's just like Luther if listen the Lutheran Church would not exist today had they not accepted Luther as their Messenger right do you understand they would not have been able to progress from Luther unto Wesley they call it the great Reformation all the churches believe in that all the Protestant churches believe in that you go back and talk about Wesley they'll tell oh yeah Wesley the Presbyterian movement this that you know the Anglican oh yeah that was all progression of the word this and that and then you tell them about Pentecost and they go yeah yeah you talk to the Pentecostals they'll tell you oh yeah we recognize Pentecostal that was the spirit of God coming down and filling the church with his Spirit and the gifts were being brought into the church and and and and God was restoring his his anointing and and the supernatural speaking in tongues and they took that as the as the evidence of the Holy Ghost but then God sends another messenger William Mariam Branham and he's got a prophetic Ministry on him he's got a prophet phcy of Malachi 4:5 and Revelations 10 1-7 written all over his life and he comes to fulfill that portion of the word and so here now he's he's he's he catches this message and he's revealing it to the people he says now look the Capstone was not interpreted see get West and come back or it's this it's these seven angels in this constellation that came to me and when I meet meet you at the day of the Resurrection you'll see that I lie not listen he had visions and he would get caught into those visions and for for third for how many 20 30 years every single Vision that he had never failed once when he saw somebody healed they were healed when he saw the dead baby come back to life in the woman's arms and in his arms it came back to life in his arms because God showed him the vision and so why he says I lie not is because you need to realize that every single Vision that God ever gave him came to pass not because he wanted it to come to pass he'd be he'd go into a person's home they had one day to live and the person would come and say brother Brandon please come and pray for for for for brother so and so he's got like one day live her sister so and so the doctor said they're going to die tomorrow he says okay okay let's go I'll go there and I'll lay my hands and I'll pray over the person and he go there and he pray over that person and and and he'd say well there's nothing more I can do and then as he's walking out of the room boom there's the vision right in front of him and he sees the person or the woman going into the supermarket buying some groceries he stops and he goes wait a minute he says thus sayeth the Lord she'll not die she'll be buying groceries again or going here or going there and the next day that person is up breakfast eating their breakfast he knew that any time God showed him a vision like that it would not fail period so here he's now talking about a constellation of angels that would come to him and when I meet you on that day he says you'll know I didn't lie God is my judge or this or is this that second climax that I talked about the other day is it of something coming forth for the church so God was doing something in that day for the church God is doing something in our day for the church we are the church he's the same yesterday today and forever he's going to do things for us that are going to give us Faith Like We Never Had had before we need rapturing Faith Saints we you're not going to go just on on stories listen I can tell you all about this you can read all about it but you need to get into the anointing and the Revelation that's behind that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today he wants to do something for you today he listen you can leave here today with a healing you can leave with a W with a changed heart your your mind can be transformed your heart can be turned back to God if your back's sliding out there come back to God because God can turn you back around and change everything because he's here now he wants this to become now reality amen and so I don't know he says is it of something coming forth for the church he says I don't know I could stay on it a little bit but I'll move on could it be that the mighty Thunder or the seven a the seventh angel in the in the seven the the constellation seventh period constellation their pyramid made in the form three on one side three on the other one on top brother brandham saw the constellation of angels it's it that's what came down and and met him but it was a at that point this was only a vision he hadn't experienced it yet he experienced it on February the 28th 1963 he says their pyramid made the form he says he says and they dropped from eternity they came out of nowhere in a split second he described it these are actual events that took place and he says could it be is this the mystery of the Thunders that will bring back The Headstone right The Headstone he says you know the pyramid never was capped The Headstone Is Yet To Come he knew that God was going to fulfill the the a portion of the word he realized that he was walking in the prophecy of the Fulfillment but he had no idea of just how wonderful it was going to be how much was actually going to happen I'm telling you you can be under great expectation because you're going to you're you're going to experiencing rapturing Faith things are going to happen around your life things are going to change from this day on things are going to change around your life if you allow this word to become a reality to you amen praise God he says The Headstone hadn't yet come it been rejected could it be brothers sisters and then he goes on he says where's it where is he King of the Jews now watch he says God always God shows it by Heavenly signs since when did he ever do anything that he didn't show a Heavenly sign first think of it in every age that you wish to and God always does show signs in the heaven first before he does anything on Earth it comes from the supernatural drops into the natural and is made manifest every age every time what age are we in we're in the bright age this is the age where we experience our Cloud experience our Supernatural change our rapturing faith our new Bible this Bible is becoming new again it's becoming new again to me I I'm reading the scriptures and I'm seeing things in there that I never saw before why because he's Progressive he's Progressive in the revelation of the change and what's taking place in our lives and he's not going to leave us in the same condition a lot of us are discouraged we're in we're in we're in conditions we're wondering why this is going on why that's going on why is this relationship a mess why is that happening why is my finan in a mess why because all these things are taking place around us so that God can become a reality to you so that you get to a place where you make God first you place him first in every situation and then you watch if God doesn't come on the scene and supernaturally change things the same way that he did it for the prophet I want the god of brother brandham I want the same God that was with brother brandham to come and intercede in my life deal with my home deal with my children deal with my finance deal with my my my my health I want that same God today amen I believe that he's present he's here and he wants to do it amen praise God let's go to the next slide that was a picture that you know one of the pictures that were that that were taken there was there was almost 85 different pictures that were taken from all different parts of of of Arizona and other parts of the US where you know they saw it in different ways and this was you know and here you can see that it was just you know and this was actually when it was when it when it was coming this is actually the cloud you know a lot of people thought it was when it was leaving but it was actually when it was coming and it was coming down it was coming from one part of America over to the other side of America and it was coming at a speed of I I believe they said it was like going at around 95 mph and it and it was a supernatural Cloud it was at a height and a level that not even missed because there was all kinds of different uh you know um writeups on it and you know you know we'll look at that now go to the next slide now listen to brother brand here he says and you know not in that time I didn't know it but cameras from all over the country was taking the picture of that as the White Cloud settled down went on the Associated Press I think your Chicago paper packed it all around and Life Magazine picked it up now here's where I want you to be paying attention to all the all the other little things that that surround this event a high cloud ring of Mystery it was published in Life magazine May 17th 1963 it was on page 112 it was 26 miles high and 30 miles across and he says here in in uh uh is this the sign of the Ender 1962 he says when when the light which you see on the picture tonight that's been proven to be a supernatural being but by scientific research to me it was the same light that struck down St Paul it was the same light that led the children of Israel by night did you notice here this Angel he was clothed in a cloud see he was a cloud by day now that same light okay on the message what is the attraction on the mountain he says here and the other day standing there turn the picture to the right now before we go to that let's just go to the next slide I was going to tell you that Science magazine picked up an article and wrote on it in April of 1963 now remember this happened in February and now these articles are starting to come forth there was there was another article go to the next slide that's actually uh no go back go back oh you have the old you have the old file remember I said I sent a new file okay so anyway okay leave it there anyways this was the Life Magazine uh magazine that that came out in 1963 okay and they said the great the great of 40 years at one fabulous party you know 40 40 is a is a is a a Biblical number I just bring that up however it reveals to you but here I want you to so I want you to see the actual magazine it was Life Magazine okay just stay on that on that uh slide it was Life magazine and this was a magazine that was very popular at the time okay and they had picked up this article okay and uh here brother Bram talks about he says okay so and the other day standing there turn the picture to the right and there is Jesus as he was in the seven Church ages the white wig on showing Supreme deity he's Alpha and Omega he's the first and the last he is the Supreme judge of all eternity standing there confirm the message of this hour see that that cloud when it came down it was God coming to confirm Not only was it God coming down to to the The Headstone the the Capstone coming down to join with the body of Christ but it was God vindicating through a supernatural sign that the whole world was going to get uh witness of because this magazine was a very popular magazine all across America at the time and God placed it there and here now we're going to go on okay and we're going to look now and we're going to realize some of these facts that I'm going to bring to you right now now first of all these these uh uh Ministries Moses and brother brandham okay Moses and Elijah okay those two Ministries keep that in the back of your mind okay those two Ministries were very very similar almost exactly the same okay the ministry of William brandham was a perfect type of the Moses Ministry God met Moses on a mountain God meets William brandom on a mountain okay God gives Moses three signs God gives brother brandham three signs okay you need to see the the this is just to vindicate that what has taken place here actually took place and it's a reality and we need to see it clear okay and here now uh here God sends Moses to bring a people that are in bondage for 400 years and now God sends a people uh sends a prophet to a people here in the Gentiles to call them out of bondage that they've been under for hundreds of years out of denominational bondage to bring us back to the word of God back to our original Faith so that we could so that we could actually be be be transformed and have a real experience a Christian experience of the word of God okay God now listen Moses goes to receive the Ten Commandments and God came to him on the seventh day William brandom was the Fulfillment of Revelations 10 seven okay so Ten Commandments the law which is a representation of the law and seven was the seventh angel messenger completion God was coming to restore now his word and to give us h a revelation of what he was doing at that particular time leading up to this day and so we okay I'm not going to get into all the the the the the similarities and the type but you need to just see that these two uh Moses and Elijah they're they're significant because they actually come again okay and what we want to see here is how the Lord scripturally and now numerically vindicates William branham's Ministry the cloud appearance and the supernatural Vindication of the cloud in Matthew 24:30 we read that that there shall appear a sign of the son of man and then in Revelations 17 to8 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all the kindreds of the Earth shall well because of him even so amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayeth the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty okay now did you manage to get the other file okay good we're going to look now okay now listen to brother brandham here the end time sign seed we're going to we're going to end this now we're going to have to because now this goes into everything that is going to lead us into next week's message so I'm going to leave you just thinking that we're going to be looking at the numerology we're going to be looking at how you know uh years how the numbers how they all fit together how life you know when if we look at the numbers and if we look at them just now we'll just end it with this we know that God's God's got perfect numbers listen to brother bam he says here three is the number of perfection we all know that three is God's number in numerology God is known by his numbers three is perfection seven is worship completion 24 is worship 40 is Temptation 50 is Pentecost Jubilee and so forth all his numbers his numerals of God is perfected is in perfection in other words God's numbers are perfect and we're going to see that as we enter into the next part of this message we're going to be looking at the dates we're going to be looking at the actual uh numbers and how they and what they represent and how they represent and we're going to bring it right to our day amen and
