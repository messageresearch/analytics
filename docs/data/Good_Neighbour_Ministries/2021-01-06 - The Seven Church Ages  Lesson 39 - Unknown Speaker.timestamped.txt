[0:00] [Music]

[0:20] that we can spend in the presence
[0:23] of the lord may the lord bless you
[0:27] real good and may the great holy spirit
[0:31] take the time to step aside
[0:35] out of the bushes and speak with us
[0:39] and show us the light for of his word
[0:44] may god bless us together as we do this
[0:47] study uh and commentary
[0:50] on the seven church ages
[0:54] uh speaking from revelation
[0:57] chapter 2 verses
[1:00] 8 and 9.
[1:04] and unto the angel of the church
[1:07] in smyrna right these
[1:11] things set the first and the last
[1:15] which was dead and is alive
[1:19] i know thy works and
[1:22] tribulation and poverty
[1:26] but thou art rich and
[1:29] i know the blasphemy
[1:32] of them which say they are
[1:36] jews and are not
[1:39] but are of this synagogue
[1:43] of satan may the lord jesus be with us
[1:48] let us pray a gracious god and heavenly
[1:51] father
[1:53] be ask thy blessing upon thy
[1:56] word may we receive from you
[2:00] lord your truth your light
[2:04] your word and way take all the glory
[2:07] honor and praise
[2:09] in jesus name we ask it
[2:13] amen and amen
[2:16] praise be to god hallelujah
[2:20] friends it's all over
[2:24] the revival that
[2:28] proceeded from or stemmed from
[2:31] the 1906 outpouring
[2:35] out the holy spirit at a souza
[2:38] street that fell upon the saints of
[2:42] god to bring about a restoration
[2:46] of the baptism of the holy spirit
[2:51] which brought in the restoration of
[2:54] gifts and then the restoration
[2:58] of the word of god
[3:01] that revival is now
[3:04] over the fires of revival
[3:09] have died out all we are left with
[3:14] are hardly even any embers
[3:18] the coals the light are gone
[3:21] out here and there there may be little
[3:24] sparks
[3:26] other than that we are left with nothing
[3:30] whatsoever many today
[3:33] with names upon their uh doors
[3:37] and on their signboards
[3:40] claiming that they are this or that
[3:44] or or the move of revival or pentecost
[3:47] the power of god
[3:49] my friends they have a name
[3:53] that they're living but they are dead
[3:57] in other words picture a man or
[4:01] or woman trying to ride a dead horse
[4:05] the horse is dead it doesn't matter how
[4:08] much you try to whip it up
[4:10] it doesn't matter what you use
[4:14] to try to get that animal
[4:17] to stir itself it can't
[4:20] because you're riding a dead horse
[4:24] outside of its time it's time is
[4:27] over it's dead the seventh church age
[4:32] is dead the messenger has come and
[4:35] gone and is dead and gone
[4:39] on and now the greater than
[4:42] solomon is here and now
[4:46] god is his own interpreter
[4:49] the holy spirit working in
[4:53] and through the lives of truly
[4:56] anointed believers elected
[5:00] sons and daughters of god using them for
[5:03] his glory
[5:04] but what has happened what caused
[5:08] the great fires of god
[5:11] to die out what caused this revival
[5:15] to be over what is it that caused
[5:19] its time to be up they threw
[5:22] cold water on that revival through
[5:26] their their means of trying to
[5:30] conserve contain control
[5:34] and to can god's
[5:37] spirit of revival in order
[5:41] to preserve it but god already told us
[5:46] don't try to keep the manna
[5:49] don't you put it in a box or hide it in
[5:52] your bed
[5:53] or or wrap it in a in a piece of cloth
[5:57] trying to protect it god himself
[6:00] is the defender of his own word and of
[6:03] his own
[6:04] fate for he watches over his word
[6:08] to see that it performs exactly
[6:11] what he says but nevertheless
[6:15] man true wisdom knowledge theology and
[6:18] so on
[6:19] has inserted himself within the plan of
[6:22] god
[6:24] and telling and announcing to god
[6:28] that he or they will now
[6:32] be the heroes or defenders
[6:35] of his fate it is his faith
[6:38] but we are going to defend his faith in
[6:41] other words we're telling him
[6:43] we can do it better than you can so
[6:46] we're going to stand here and defend
[6:48] your faith
[6:50] and they failed and they are failing
[6:55] and by organizational systems and the
[6:58] methods and minds of men they have
[7:02] thrown cold waters
[7:06] icicles upon the great
[7:10] movement of god and the great burning
[7:13] fires of the holy spirit and has
[7:16] caused it to cool off completely
[7:21] while they're talking about the holy
[7:23] spirit
[7:24] they were actually quenching the holy
[7:26] spirit
[7:28] yes sir they were actually blaspheming
[7:31] against the holy spirit
[7:33] and they were actually denying the holy
[7:37] spirit and the power of god thereof
[7:40] my friends and here we find ourselves
[7:43] with the the revival dead
[7:47] died out gone uh uh
[7:50] finished it's over with amen
[7:54] hallelujah but they're trying to whip a
[7:56] dead horse
[7:58] they're trying to use a various methods
[8:04] maybe formaldehyde injections i don't
[8:06] know but they're trying to revive
[8:09] something that's already gone you
[8:12] can not revive that dead
[8:15] animal that you try to use
[8:18] to produce your products
[8:22] and here we find them now trying to
[8:24] revive it by saying
[8:27] that talking about the evidence of
[8:30] the holy spirit my friends
[8:34] oh how towns is the evidence of the holy
[8:38] spirit
[8:39] and of course we know my friends that
[8:42] the devil can
[8:43] talk in towns maybe even better than you
[8:46] or i
[8:46] can uh for god has
[8:50] anointed me with that gift and
[8:53] there are others also but let me say
[8:56] this my friends
[8:57] tongues cannot and is not
[9:01] the infallible evidence
[9:04] of the presence of the holy spirit
[9:07] within a life that evidence
[9:11] according to the word of god is
[9:14] when he the spirit of
[9:17] truth is come he will guide you
[9:21] into all truth and show you
[9:25] things to come there is the evidence
[9:28] according to the lord jesus christ
[9:30] himself that the holy spirit
[9:34] illuminating enlightening inspiring
[9:37] anointing you with the opening of your
[9:40] eyes
[9:41] opening of the heart to receive the word
[9:44] of god for your day
[9:46] the message of the word for your day
[9:50] and giving you divine understanding
[9:54] to know what the word the written word
[9:57] the spoken word what it is
[10:01] saying or what he is saying through
[10:04] those instrumentalities oh blessed be
[10:08] the name of the lord
[10:09] amen my friends they thought
[10:12] they could use the power of organization
[10:17] as their pathway to using the power of
[10:21] god without
[10:22] his will without his permission
[10:27] they are going to take the power of god
[10:30] and use it anyway
[10:32] whether god likes it or not and they're
[10:35] they intended to do that through the
[10:38] instrument
[10:39] of organization and god would not allow
[10:42] it
[10:43] they speak of this evidence the evidence
[10:47] of the holy spirit being in tongues
[10:49] absolutely false
[10:52] it is contrary to the word of god
[10:56] they use the pictures or they use the
[11:01] what we read in acts 1 2
[11:04] 3 they read that
[11:08] and use that and pervert that to
[11:11] take your mind away from the genuine
[11:14] evidence
[11:16] is that they caught a revelation of what
[11:19] jesus was trying to tell them for three
[11:21] and a half years
[11:23] and they got so excited by what they
[11:26] heard
[11:28] the evidence was that they received
[11:30] finally
[11:32] a breakthrough in their understanding
[11:36] and of the revelation of the word that
[11:39] came to them that they are so excited
[11:43] it caused them to speak
[11:47] in towns because they became so thrilled
[11:50] so aesthetic overcome with joy
[11:54] that they they could hardly talk
[11:57] and towns came out of them tongues
[12:01] was not the evidence it is
[12:04] an evidence and evidence
[12:08] eh that they they express
[12:11] but it's the reception of the
[12:14] revelation of the word
[12:17] that was accumulated in them over
[12:20] the time they spent with the message of
[12:23] their day
[12:25] and their hour who was none other
[12:28] than the lord jesus christ and may i say
[12:31] he is the same yesterday today and
[12:34] forever
[12:35] glory be to god hallelujah
[12:39] instead of tongues being the evidence
[12:45] of the holy spirit
[12:48] they don't understand
[12:52] that tongues is the evidence of
[12:54] confusion
[12:56] you go back to babel back to the
[12:59] beginning
[13:00] we see the seeds planted right
[13:03] back in they were all talking with towns
[13:08] but it produced what confusion
[13:12] it was a bay bell and the tower of
[13:16] bay beltran organization is raising up
[13:19] again
[13:20] a great tire to the glory of satan
[13:24] and here friends they
[13:28] call that the holy spirit misdirecting
[13:32] misleading the people who claim to be
[13:36] the people of god and once again
[13:40] here is satan here is man
[13:44] my friends using the profusion
[13:48] of towns not realizing that this
[13:52] profusion of towns
[13:55] is the evidence of the end time
[13:58] a sign of the end time
[14:01] yes sir uh it's the very same thing we
[14:04] can see
[14:05] clearly in the word of god
[14:09] amen hallelujah man trying to tell
[14:14] god what he should anoint
[14:18] and who she should anoint and who is
[14:21] failed and who
[14:22] is not by giving that
[14:25] kind of an evidence that we will not
[14:29] accept or believe that that this man or
[14:32] woman is filled with the holy spirit
[14:34] unless they speak in towns unless
[14:38] we see the piercings in your hand and
[14:41] and
[14:41] all in your sight we won't believe it we
[14:43] would receive it
[14:44] but god in his word said
[14:48] when he the spirit of truth is come
[14:53] he will guide you into all truth
[14:57] and show you things to come
[15:01] my friends the handwriting is on the
[15:04] wall
[15:06] think of it oh my a sign of the
[15:09] end time yes calling themselves full
[15:14] gospel
[15:16] proud with their pentecostal pride
[15:21] filled with pentecost
[15:24] but let them prove it oh yeah they want
[15:27] to prove it by signs and wonders
[15:30] not by the word of god not by
[15:34] divine revelation not by
[15:37] constant present tense activity
[15:40] of the holy spirit working within their
[15:43] lives
[15:44] amen my friends at pentecost
[15:49] the fire came in the form of a cloud
[15:53] and broke itself up and the
[15:56] town separated itself and it fell upon
[16:00] each of them
[16:03] amen but where is the fire to today
[16:07] where is that supernatural evidence of
[16:10] the fire of god
[16:12] oh may god help us hallelujah
[16:16] amen they spoke in towns
[16:19] at pentecost hallelujah but when they
[16:23] spoke in towns the people of different
[16:27] languages and nations understood
[16:31] what they were saying even though
[16:35] they were speaking in an unknown town
[16:39] as it may appear that i am doing right
[16:42] now
[16:43] oh my friends that
[16:46] language that they were speaking
[16:50] were on this was understood by
[16:53] supernatural anointing
[16:56] and revelation the people understood
[17:00] what they were saying while they were
[17:03] speaking
[17:05] in terms yes
[17:09] they said we have the evidence but back
[17:11] then
[17:12] all the people that received the holy
[17:14] spirit
[17:15] acted and moved together as
[17:18] one family instead
[17:22] what do we have a perversion calling
[17:24] itself the genuine
[17:27] while it is the false because pentecost
[17:31] and the present day world system is
[17:34] more divided than it has ever
[17:37] been before
[17:41] next they claim they're the original
[17:45] but of the original not anyone could
[17:48] just
[17:49] come and join the church or become a
[17:52] member
[17:53] of the church or associate
[17:56] with the church for the bible clearly
[17:59] tells us
[17:59] there's no man joining them
[18:03] himself to them except the lord
[18:07] was to permit him oh my
[18:10] friends hallelujah and so we end up with
[18:15] many goats a lot of goat spirited
[18:18] believers spirited all right but it's a
[18:21] spirit of a goat
[18:23] jumping air and jumping there and
[18:25] dancing here and dancing there and
[18:28] running the floors over here but it's
[18:30] the spirit of a goat
[18:33] contrary to the word of the living god
[18:37] they claim to be full of the holy ghost
[18:41] and can't really prove it
[18:44] the empty of the genuine real power of
[18:48] god
[18:49] amen they don't have that genuine
[18:53] real power of god amongst them
[18:56] amen if they're so full of the gospel as
[19:00] they claim
[19:02] match your doctrine match your teaching
[19:04] against the word of god
[19:06] and see where it leads you oh not
[19:10] true septility not true manipulation
[19:14] and imaginations of man but by the
[19:17] revelation of the holy spirit
[19:20] moving through the believer lord of god
[19:23] hallelujah
[19:24] singing about uh what a great change
[19:27] what a great change
[19:29] yes there's been a great change with a
[19:30] change for the worse
[19:32] because we find men and women feel
[19:35] themselves
[19:36] amen oh praise god denying the power
[19:40] thereof
[19:41] while talking about the power denying
[19:44] the power
[19:44] talking about the holy spirit fighting
[19:47] against the holy spirit denying the very
[19:49] holy spirit
[19:51] they're claiming to worship that's the
[19:53] way of satan
[19:54] that's the way of cain while claiming
[19:57] faith claiming religion
[19:58] actually rebelling against the word of
[20:01] god
[20:02] and against the genuine holy spirit they
[20:05] have a name
[20:06] they're living but they're dead
[20:09] as i've said before riding a dead horse
[20:14] tongues is not the evidence
[20:18] of revival my friends
[20:21] it is the evidence of
[20:24] spiritual death let me repeat
[20:29] towns speaking in towns
[20:32] which the present-day pentecostals
[20:35] claim to be the evidence of the holy
[20:38] spirit
[20:39] it's actually the evidence of spiritual
[20:44] death that's the evidence my friends
[20:48] that the seventh church age is
[20:51] over it's gone oh
[20:55] think of it in the old testament
[20:58] when they thought they were having a
[21:00] great revival
[21:02] oh ichabod is written against the church
[21:06] names
[21:07] ichabod upon the doorpost ichabod
[21:11] i am this i am that i'm that and and
[21:14] have all these denominational names and
[21:17] god
[21:17] said it's all curse the glory is
[21:20] departed
[21:21] you have a name that you're living and
[21:23] you're dead
[21:25] right where you are for the spirit of
[21:27] god
[21:28] has taken its light and gone my
[21:31] away from where it was amen
[21:34] no the dove could not land upon
[21:38] dead carcasses the dove had to
[21:41] land upon a fresh grown
[21:45] olive branch that same holy
[21:48] spirit today must land upon
[21:51] jesus who is the branch the word of god
[21:55] made manifest for this day and for this
[21:58] hour
[21:58] praise the name of the lord all glory to
[22:01] his marvelous
[22:02] and wonderful name think of it ichabod
[22:06] written on your doorpost you think that
[22:09] name you took it's a blessing it's a
[22:11] curse
[22:12] upon you the glory of god is departed
[22:16] looking backwards like a frog looking
[22:19] back to some great thing back there
[22:22] and letting that big influence to use
[22:26] that to give you credibility
[22:27] and influence and power but that day is
[22:30] past we are living in the present tense
[22:34] of the word of god amen amen
[22:38] once down in babylon
[22:42] down in the land of confusion
[22:45] where the various nations were brought
[22:49] into natural captivity today its
[22:52] spiritual captivity
[22:54] of spiritual babylon the harlotry
[22:59] the sale of religion the buying and
[23:02] selling of faith
[23:03] my god think of it babylon again
[23:07] and once again we see the hand
[23:10] writing on the wall many
[23:14] men there you farsen oh
[23:17] you're waving the balances and found
[23:19] wanting
[23:20] oh friend this is not the
[23:23] evidence of the holy spirit it's the
[23:27] evidence
[23:28] of the sign of the end sign of the
[23:31] end of the gentile dispensation
[23:35] yes sir the jed
[23:39] the gentile dispensation is over
[23:42] now the entire spirit and word and truth
[23:46] and light of god as the sun all
[23:50] moves westward it rises these sets in
[23:54] the west
[23:55] and then when that edge dies
[23:59] or sets in the west then
[24:03] the new day the new day
[24:08] the sun rises again but where does it
[24:12] rise from
[24:13] it went down in the west but it rises
[24:16] again in the east
[24:18] oh oh friends
[24:21] we are on the borderland we are
[24:24] right where this is
[24:27] going back to our jewish brothers and
[24:30] sisters

[24:34] is going back to the house of david
[24:38] the holy spirit is lifting up his
[24:41] righteousness his truth his light and
[24:44] the great eagles of jehovah the great
[24:47] eagle
[24:47] jehovah is flying over his people
[24:52] and covering them with his wings and
[24:55] protecting them
[24:56] with his wings for this is going back to
[24:59] his people
[25:00] at this hour glory to god and many like
[25:03] myself are announcing that and telling
[25:06] you that
[25:06] for it is the truth of the word of the
[25:09] living god
[25:10] hallelujah oh blessed be his name
[25:13] listen friends tongues
[25:17] the evidence of the end
[25:21] of the ideas and the fruits
[25:25] of the mind of man god will
[25:28] not put up with it any longer man
[25:32] inserting himself into
[25:33] god's plan and trying to tell him
[25:37] they have a better way of running his
[25:40] church his people of administrating
[25:44] and leading and guiding them better than
[25:47] he has
[25:48] in his word oh wake up people of the
[25:51] living god
[25:52] wake up check yourself against the
[25:55] promises
[25:56] of this day and of this hour to see what
[25:59] god is doing oh praise god
[26:03] the organization on organizing
[26:06] man oh a better way of
[26:10] being able to streamline god's
[26:13] church and place it from being a rag tag
[26:17] group rough human preachers and
[26:20] refund simple humble believers into
[26:24] a streamline system
[26:27] how we can actually move people
[26:30] from being out there in the world
[26:34] and clean them up by step one base one
[26:38] base two base three base four
[26:41] it is all nice and good
[26:44] and oh well sounding to the ears and
[26:49] beautiful on the eyes and moving to the
[26:52] mind but friends
[26:53] that's not the word of god god has his
[26:57] own way his own system and his own
[27:01] uh way of doing things amen here we see
[27:04] them
[27:04] trying to organize uh until we have an
[27:08] invasion of the pulpit
[27:11] invasion of the pulpits that's just
[27:15] a topic of its own but the pulpit the
[27:18] true
[27:18] genuine holy ghost pulpit of the living
[27:22] god
[27:22] has been anointed by all kinds of
[27:26] bugs and germs and and so viruses
[27:30] have invaded the pulpit of god and we
[27:33] find
[27:34] demons hiding behind scholarship
[27:37] devils hiding behind religious knowledge
[27:40] and claiming like satan did in the
[27:43] garden
[27:44] to preach to eve and to tell her
[27:47] did not god say and he'll tell her
[27:50] exactly
[27:51] what was there and he may even be a
[27:53] better scholar than you are
[27:55] and yet it's not the holy spirit
[27:59] but satan hiding behind the disguise
[28:03] of that which looks like a human may god
[28:06] help us everyone this mary stand against
[28:11] this
[28:11] invasion of the pulpit
[28:15] men without the genuine
[28:19] call of god upon them they'll spread all
[28:23] kinds of myths and stories
[28:25] of this or that the sciences that
[28:28] they're taking in them sciences of
[28:30] illustration sciences of
[28:32] of of uh of preaching sciences
[28:36] of how to give and all to call the
[28:39] science of how to do an
[28:40] introduction the science of how to pres
[28:44] a presentation of the body part
[28:47] of a talk and all these this system of
[28:50] ties
[28:51] and placed it all together them like
[28:53] that
[28:54] because they they they're against their
[28:57] random spontaneous anointed
[29:00] floyd free-flowing word of the living
[29:03] god
[29:03] because then satan cannot trace track
[29:06] or understand what god is doing and
[29:10] what next he'll say true that genuine
[29:14] servant or daughter of the living god
[29:16] whoever he
[29:18] may be using whether in preaching or
[29:20] testifying
[29:22] or talking satan it sends him crazy
[29:25] he can't understand that back to the
[29:27] word people
[29:29] wake up to yourself come to yourself and
[29:32] see
[29:32] your true and living god within your
[29:35] life
[29:35] and within your heart oh glory to god
[29:38] amen amen
[29:40] my friends they invaded the pulpits
[29:44] self-styled man of god
[29:48] oh no more men of god like what's in the
[29:52] bible
[29:54] most of them rugged men men come off of
[29:57] a mountain or
[29:58] wearing some kind of a camel skin and
[30:01] wearing
[30:02] on some goat skin or sheepskin
[30:06] smelly my god out from the wilderness
[30:11] men that would chop down trees kill
[30:13] snakes in the wilderness
[30:15] men that had even their talk uh
[30:19] their words were just rough hewn
[30:23] wasn't smooth hissing like a serpent
[30:27] but there were men that were not
[30:31] that come out like that because that's
[30:33] the way god
[30:34] wants this veil to hide behind that kind
[30:37] of a veil so you might
[30:39] despise it you might not recognize it
[30:42] meanwhile it's god behind skin
[30:45] god hiding behind badger skins and
[30:49] unveiling his word
[30:50] in in this day and this hour as it was
[30:54] in that hour god did not take
[30:57] man of perfumed lace-hand kerchiefs
[31:01] god did not take man my friends
[31:04] with beautiful robes of purple
[31:07] and and so on and and that type of thing
[31:11] god did not take man from in the
[31:14] rabbinical schools
[31:16] that were going forth nothing wrong with
[31:18] the schools nothing wrong with the
[31:20] rabbis
[31:20] but friends god chooses of his own
[31:23] choosing
[31:24] not by the head rabbi or the head pope
[31:27] or the
[31:28] head supervisor and superintendent
[31:30] choosing who
[31:31] is and who will not be ordained but
[31:34] god ordains by his own choosing
[31:38] through the blessed holy spirit of the
[31:41] living god
[31:42] amen oh my here we are
[31:45] friends them not having confidence
[31:51] in the five-fold ministry of ephesians 4
[31:56] and 10 to 13 13. they're
[32:00] literally by setting up their own orders
[32:03] and their own ways of doing things they
[32:06] are
[32:06] saying in a backhanded way that god has
[32:10] failed in properly setting up his church
[32:13] so we will
[32:14] now give you proper order and we will
[32:18] set it up
[32:19] in such a beautiful way like kane we
[32:22] will set it up in such an
[32:23] orderly way like yes his altar
[32:27] we will do it and we will let you see
[32:30] what it really should be not knowing
[32:32] that they're fulfilling prophecy
[32:34] you're fulfilling prophecy amen
[32:38] and they are going to game
[32:41] saying of course they're coming against
[32:45] god's word amen and
[32:48] not even realizing it amen
[32:52] they don't even know their fulfilling
[32:54] prophecy and
[32:55] blindly preaching human experience
[33:00] instead of having access to the truth
[33:04] which is only given by the holy spirit
[33:08] not by human minds and a comparison of
[33:11] human
[33:11] uh topics and and resource and research
[33:15] and
[33:16] whether by computer or whatever it's not
[33:20] given by that
[33:21] it'll bring you very close and you can
[33:24] even
[33:24] cause some people to believe that you
[33:26] have it when you don't have it
[33:28] you got it somewhere some by your
[33:30] accumulation of knowledge
[33:32] and the sharpness of your mental
[33:34] abilities and agility
[33:36] and uh but it's still contrary
[33:39] to the word of the living god oh
[33:42] my lord help us think of it
[33:45] amen what are the qualifications
[33:50] then first genuine
[33:53] spiritual leadership
[33:56] friends i'm here to tell you it's
[33:59] not having power and prestige
[34:03] power from the prestige of having a lot
[34:06] of money
[34:09] and that's where a lot of leadership
[34:11] gets their power and their prestige from
[34:16] it's from oh i can prove to you i'm a
[34:19] success
[34:20] or i'm successful and i i know what to
[34:24] do in this
[34:25] natural world to get things done i have
[34:28] to make things move
[34:29] and therefore here i am now in the
[34:32] spiritual world
[34:33] and i'll use those capacities and
[34:35] abilities and potentials
[34:37] to be able to to to recreate the same
[34:40] thing
[34:40] but that sounds good but it's not of god
[34:45] god doesn't need your wisdom god doesn't
[34:48] need your
[34:48] ability he does not need your knowledge
[34:52] who will teach him who will counsel him
[34:55] who will advise him
[34:56] he is his own god his own interpreter
[35:00] you need his wisdom he said can all the
[35:03] wisdom of this entire world with
[35:05] all his princes he said it's nothing but
[35:07] a drop of bucket
[35:08] uh dropping a bucket to me oh think of
[35:12] that
[35:12] which would you rather have the wisdom
[35:14] of men which is a drop in the bucket
[35:16] or access to the unlimited
[35:21] unfailing endless
[35:24] wisdom knowledge and revelation
[35:27] of the true living god just be
[35:31] sure that his presence living presence
[35:35] is in your life and let him flow through
[35:38] you as the sun said flow through me holy
[35:42] spirit
[35:43] flow through me amen that he might flow
[35:46] through your life
[35:47] and be a blessing to the world true
[35:51] spiritual leadership is not
[35:56] being a real good social leader
[35:59] uh oh they want the leader to have pure
[36:02] real social skills of how to
[36:06] talk like a prince to people
[36:10] to be a real religious politician
[36:13] to know how to slink around
[36:16] and how to move around obstacles
[36:20] uh how to wind themselves around
[36:23] situations
[36:24] my friends god didn't call us to be
[36:27] politicians
[36:28] religious politicians uh like that no
[36:31] sir he called us to be man
[36:35] of god the access led to the roots
[36:39] amen high places full of pride are
[36:42] brought
[36:42] down to the ground and low prices
[36:46] are raised up by the power and presence
[36:49] of the living god hallelujah yes sir
[36:52] no true spiritual leadership
[36:56] the qualifications for it my friends
[37:00] is not for one to have religious
[37:02] maneuvering
[37:04] and all type of things of that nature
[37:08] business abilities amen
[37:13] all manner of uh using sheer
[37:17] mental prowess the the power of their
[37:20] minds sharp
[37:22] oh and use that to be a
[37:26] substitute for the power of god
[37:29] the penetrating power of hebrews 4
[37:33] 12. it's so close
[37:36] that the devil wants it to seem as if
[37:39] that was the holy ghost and it is not
[37:42] the holy ghost
[37:44] from that amen amen those things do not
[37:47] qualify a man amen for spiritual
[37:50] leadership
[37:52] or give him weight in the word of god
[37:57] in the world that's how satan and in
[38:01] christianity and in religion that's how
[38:04] he
[38:05] seeks to create credibility around
[38:07] persons
[38:09] and dignitaries and even normal people
[38:13] taking the ministry not knowing from
[38:15] what angle they're taking
[38:16] it and he gives them weight and
[38:19] credibility
[38:20] through those kinds of qualities but
[38:23] god gives a person
[38:26] amen their credibility
[38:29] comes from the revealing of the word
[38:34] or the word itself revealing itself
[38:38] through the individual and bringing
[38:41] glory
[38:41] and honor to his mighty name god
[38:44] bless his real wonderful
[38:48] leadership that god has placed within
[38:51] his church
[38:53] amen that are not there by human
[38:56] materialism
[38:57] they're not there by human values
[39:01] of course we care what people think of
[39:04] us
[39:04] but as men of god we are
[39:08] exactly that not just man of the people
[39:12] but we are men of god
[39:15] we are yes we are here to serve and help
[39:18] the people
[39:19] but our master we are servants
[39:23] of the living god so we serve
[39:26] god first and we are on
[39:29] our knees kneeling before god
[39:32] day night but on our feet before
[39:36] men and women like ourselves for we
[39:39] carry in our vessel the word of this
[39:43] hour and of this day to bring glory
[39:46] to his name amen praise god hallelujah
[39:50] now remember friends i'm not speaking
[39:52] about real elders
[39:54] genuine god sent elders i'm talking
[39:57] about these
[39:58] fake elders that are really not anointed
[40:01] by the holy ghost
[40:02] and all they're about is monkey business
[40:04] monkey see
[40:05] and monkey do we are we're not for that
[40:08] we are here
[40:09] in the word of god for the real word to
[40:13] be made manifest
[40:14] god made you a different way made me a
[40:16] different way
[40:17] cause me to be able to express himself
[40:20] and the word
[40:21] in in the way he has made me and it made
[40:25] disrupted my interrupted might cause
[40:28] some people
[40:29] uh to become mad some sad some glad
[40:32] but but that's the purpose of god god
[40:35] has you
[40:36] in his way to to sound very reasonable
[40:40] and
[40:40] well-placed and soft-spoken then he
[40:43] asked me
[40:44] another way we are all shining lights
[40:47] from the same diamond
[40:48] to bring glory for his name hallelujah
[40:52] i'm just bringing the truth the way he
[40:55] shows me and the way he reveals it
[40:57] through me
[40:59] not of myself or for myself
[41:02] but for his glory and for his honor god
[41:05] bless
[41:06] the name of jesus christ look a real
[41:09] elder might be one of the poorest men in
[41:11] your midst
[41:14] and he is an elder not by his wealth
[41:18] but by the presence of god within him
[41:21] i tell you friends i
[41:24] accept and believe a man can be an elder
[41:27] he may be the poorest man
[41:29] yet he's the elder he may be one of the
[41:32] richest
[41:33] man but he's not to be despised because
[41:36] he's rich
[41:37] for god can use any man who regardless
[41:40] of who he is
[41:41] and what he has as long as he doesn't
[41:44] allow those things to be before his eyes
[41:46] and before his face and allow god
[41:50] to be the number one in his life
[41:53] and to seek first the kingdom of god and
[41:55] his
[41:56] righteousness and all other things will
[41:59] be added
[42:00] onto thank god hallelujah
[42:03] oh yes that's really my friends to have
[42:06] the genuine spiritual qualifications of
[42:08] a man
[42:09] whether he be an elder or a deacon amen
[42:12] is to allow god to have first place and
[42:16] to move
[42:16] by the holy spirit amen praise
[42:20] god what a day we're living in
[42:23] when the people my friends
[42:26] are spiritually rich but spiritually
[42:30] impoverished and poor
[42:32] in this laodicean age and which we
[42:36] are in no wonder he says i know
[42:39] your poverty amen and that poverty
[42:43] is linked to satan's synagogue
[42:46] because that's what satan synagogue does
[42:49] it'll impoverish those people
[42:51] that are within them suck out vacuum
[42:54] out pull out all their giving their
[42:58] money money money money money money
[43:01] money and their god being mammon all
[43:04] they will be able to talk about
[43:06] is money instead of the master and
[43:09] instead of the glory
[43:10] of the name of jesus christ and leaving
[43:13] the rest of him
[43:15] and he'll work it out not to send a
[43:17] soldier into war
[43:19] and not to give him the arms and give
[43:21] him
[43:22] whatever is needed for him to carry out
[43:25] that spiritual warfare
[43:27] to glorify his mighty name
[43:30] amen amen all they want is to get their
[43:33] organization rich and powerful
[43:36] the membership may be in another state
[43:38] but they don't care as long as their
[43:40] organization
[43:41] is rich and powerful and god is still
[43:44] here
[43:45] moving in the hearts and in the minds
[43:48] of men amen oh praise
[43:52] god when jesus died did he leave
[43:54] buildings
[43:56] great buildings great properties
[44:00] gold and silver precious stones
[44:04] and crowns and everything else did he
[44:07] leave
[44:08] that did he leave the
[44:11] princes and this of his discipleship
[44:14] behind
[44:15] and that made them leadership of the
[44:17] church no he did leave no such a thing
[44:20] my friends
[44:21] he did not come riding in a pink
[44:23] cadillac to preach the gospel
[44:25] he came upon a donkey he came on a
[44:28] poor simple beast to show you in
[44:30] simplicity
[44:32] humility that god takes his word
[44:35] oh blessed be the name of the living god
[44:37] hallelujah
[44:38] all praise god friends it's always the
[44:41] little flock
[44:43] that's pushed aside and loses out
[44:46] against these big organizations
[44:49] and then where do they have to go my
[44:51] friends
[44:53] they look down the pawn but they have to
[44:55] scurry
[44:56] and find some place they can rent or
[44:59] hide
[45:01] in a basement in a house
[45:05] in some kind of a rented place
[45:09] just like they had to hide in the
[45:11] catacombs
[45:13] it's here today still but in another
[45:16] form not being pierced
[45:19] with literal swords and spears but with
[45:23] the criticisms
[45:24] accusations assassinations of character
[45:28] that's going on may god help us everyone
[45:31] here today
[45:32] may god help us amen
[45:36] but why do they do it it's because that
[45:39] little elected
[45:40] flock of god is a rebuke to the
[45:43] generation
[45:44] they are a rebuke and they're a
[45:47] comparison to the world
[45:49] looking over here and looking over there
[45:52] they see the true and the false
[45:54] the real and the unreal oh my friends
[45:58] amen that is why uh we stick out like
[46:02] sore thumbs
[46:03] we stick out like oddballs because
[46:08] of his life moving and working
[46:11] within the believer and before the
[46:14] wicked
[46:15] the righteous intent them no harm no
[46:18] hurt
[46:18] whatsoever but they seem to
[46:22] always was some assume the worse
[46:26] and feel that we are up to no good
[46:29] and so we have to be dealt with
[46:32] like herod dealt with john the baptist
[46:35] who told him the truth that he was
[46:38] committing adultery
[46:40] with his brother's wife oh my god
[46:44] hallelujah oh the shame the
[46:47] embarrassment
[46:48] to a person in my position how can the
[46:51] preachers
[46:52] preach like that and speak like that but
[46:55] friends
[46:55] that's what a preacher a genuine
[46:57] preacher is he looks not to the right
[47:00] nor to the left
[47:01] or for the favors of man or whether
[47:03] there will be rich powerful or poor
[47:06] he just looks to the glory of god and he
[47:08] looks to his
[47:09] master for his reward and he preaches
[47:12] the word of god
[47:13] the way god gave it to him amen
[47:16] hallelujah
[47:17] my friends the same sinister evil
[47:21] force this fiend this
[47:24] evil being that was behind herod
[47:29] that inspired him to shut out the voice
[47:33] that was preaching and speaking the
[47:35] truth to him
[47:37] which truth he did not want to hear my
[47:40] friends
[47:41] and the only way he thought he could do
[47:43] it is by
[47:44] shutting up john the baptist voice not
[47:47] knowing that that voice will rise again
[47:49] and some other individual some other
[47:51] person somewhere else
[47:53] and god will raise up for he never
[47:55] leaves himself without a witness
[47:58] and he uses his witnesses for his glory
[48:01] and for his honor hallelujah and there
[48:04] is still such a force in the world today
[48:07] we know my friends satan is that
[48:09] sinister force
[48:11] oh he is the force behind
[48:15] these kinds of people that are truly
[48:18] void of conscience
[48:20] the spiritually deaf spiritually dumb
[48:24] amen my friends and spiritually
[48:28] without a conscience these people honor
[48:32] me with their lips
[48:34] my friends but not with their hearts
[48:37] think of it this is the day we're living
[48:40] in
[48:40] may the holy spirit take the word spoken
[48:42] here today
[48:43] what happened in those church ages were
[48:46] a picture
[48:47] of what was to happen and is happening
[48:50] in our day and at our time and
[48:53] we are in the midst of it now take heed
[48:57] lest you perish and may the holy spirit
[48:59] be with
[49:00] us all in this hour and in this day our
[49:03] gracious heavenly father we ask thy
[49:05] blessing
[49:06] upon this your people pour out of your
[49:09] holy spirit with
[49:10] understanding and the wisdom and
[49:13] revelation of this hour
[49:15] and causes all to see understand and
[49:18] know
[49:19] the day in which we live on the lord god
[49:22] whom we serve
[49:24] to your honor and glory in jesus
[49:26] christ's name
[49:28] amen and amen
[49:31] god bless you and god be with you all
[49:34] we'll see you on sunday
[49:35] where we will speak again my friends
[49:38] touching on these two mysterious trees
[49:42] that came from the garden of eden
[49:45] and their branches are stretched out
[49:50] right down through the ages in time and
[49:52] prophecy
[49:53] right to our day and still the fruits
[49:57] are there
[49:58] let us make our choice in jesus name god
[50:02] bless you
[50:23] [Music]
