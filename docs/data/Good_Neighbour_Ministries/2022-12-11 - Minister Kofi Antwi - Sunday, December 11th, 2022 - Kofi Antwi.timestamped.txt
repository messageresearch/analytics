[48:52] it's not me gonna do anything it's God
[48:56] that does it
[48:57] because without him I'm nothing without
[49:00] him you are nothing
[49:03] praise be to the Lord me and my son Paul
[49:07] left here 22nd of November
[49:11] and we arrived in Ghana 23rd of November
[49:15] brother Daniel Pastor Daniel who came
[49:18] here one time and preached Pickers from
[49:20] the airport
[49:22] and took us to his house that even was a
[49:27] service
[49:28] so we were very very tired as some of
[49:32] you that from Africa you know
[49:35] from here to Ghana is in in the plane is
[49:39] 16 hours
[49:40] non-stop from here to Cairo is 10 hours
[49:44] then from Cairo to Ghana is six hours
[49:46] I'm not talking about Transit so when
[49:49] you reach you are really really tired
[49:53] but nevertheless
[49:57] service is important to me than anything
[49:59] because I want to hear the voice of God
[50:03] and in the evening while we were there
[50:07] we went me and Paul went to the service
[50:10] and they were doing uh that week it
[50:13] happened that they have ministers coming
[50:16] to minister in brother Daniel's church
[50:20] and they have their title like take on
[50:24] your inheritance
[50:26] if you have it as the minister if you
[50:29] have any uh uh topic
[50:33] like you could bring it but the the
[50:37] church team was take your inheritance
[50:40] so I said now two ministers minister
[50:44] Wednesday
[50:46] I think Thursday
[50:48] then I left with Paul we went to the
[50:53] village where I was born to see the
[50:56] family because my wife brother was so
[50:59] sick with kidney
[51:01] and the kidney was failing
[51:04] they have we have done everything we
[51:06] supposed to do and
[51:09] I need to talk to him before he goes
[51:13] so that was on my heart and God made a
[51:16] way I spoke to him
[51:19] about the word he has heard the word
[51:22] even baptized
[51:24] and the family were trying to push press
[51:29] him or you need to see this you need to
[51:31] see that he says no I don't need to see
[51:34] anything
[51:36] and we know that it was God that was
[51:39] doing that with him
[51:40] so when I went and speak the word with
[51:43] him
[51:44] my heart was at peace I believe his
[51:47] heart too was at peace
[51:49] God sent me there to him because it was
[51:52] time for him to go
[51:55] and we left the
[51:57] we slept in the hotel me and Paul
[52:00] Sunday morning because I have a vehicle
[52:05] from a friend Pastor Samuel and I know
[52:08] the rich man in Ghana he gave me SUV to
[52:12] drive it to take it around wherever I'm
[52:14] going and I'm driving it so I called
[52:17] Pastor Michael whom brother Desmond was
[52:20] there and he delivered brother they says
[52:23] your ministry was fantastic
[52:26] everybody was rejoicing while I was
[52:29] there about the minister the word that
[52:31] you brought
[52:33] so they told me that Sunday I have to
[52:37] come and Minister for them
[52:39] so I was driving two hours to that place
[52:43] and we are almost close to the area but
[52:47] some part of the road was rough
[52:51] and why we were driving I saw a hole
[52:55] it's a going through that place was a
[52:58] farm area
[52:59] so I tried to dodge the whole not
[53:02] knowing there was a big hole on the
[53:04] other side
[53:05] so the car just went in boom on the
[53:09] whole and I'm I'm the one that gonna

[53:31] out quickly leave them from the car rush
[53:35] to go to the church they were singing as
[53:39] we were singing
[53:40] in the church
[53:42] and why
[53:44] I was going there
[53:47] every man in the church were coming to
[53:50] help us to get a car away
[53:53] so the pastor was still leading the song
[53:56] and the ladies were in the church so
[54:00] they came around me

[54:35] the people were shouting rejoicing the
[54:38] church the people may be very close like

[56:47] I want some of you to take my word I am
[56:51] God

[57:06] through your life and change the life oh
[57:10] the Holy Spirit was my brothers and
[57:13] sisters moving mightily so
[57:18] after the service we came
[57:20] with all the young men
[57:23] and within I would say seven or ten
[57:27] minutes we were able to pull the car
[57:29] guess what

[57:44] remove the key start the car with
[57:47] Pickers and things you know Africa some

[58:02] wash it
[58:03] and I was able to drive the car up and
[58:07] down but it was V8 5.8 engine

[58:20] sisters we have the word
[58:24] we are the light of the world

[59:09] no in my heart something was saying
[59:11] speak to this man speak the word to this
[59:14] man so I just pour my heart to him like
[59:18] that and speak the word

[59:47] about Christ
[59:49] now he's talking more he says I don't
[59:52] care nothing means nothing to me only
[59:55] Jesus means something to me thank you

[1:00:02] man even was telling me why are you
[1:00:04] crying like that I said you brother you
[1:00:07] don't know you don't know because God
[1:00:10] I'm seeing Christ
[1:00:13] doing something in that man's life
[1:00:17] because he told me he says even I'm
[1:00:20] building a church for some church I'm
[1:00:22] gonna bury I'm gonna do this and I'm
[1:00:26] sitting down there and I'm says Lord
[1:00:29] now I see what you are doing
[1:00:33] I recognize
[1:00:35] if I couldn't share the world with that
[1:00:38] man
[1:00:39] right even though look at how high this
[1:00:43] man is he have used to have hundred
[1:00:45] houses and hotels in my country the
[1:00:48] capital
[1:00:49] the man is every crook his hand is
[1:00:52] inside
[1:00:54] yes I'll tell you the truth
[1:00:57] every crook is if he's here he will be
[1:01:00] top so-called Mafia
[1:01:03] right that's the way he was he is but
[1:01:07] God has put him on the bed now he he's
[1:01:11] doing business but he's always at home
[1:01:13] one place
[1:01:15] and I told him I says yeah you God gonna
[1:01:19] beat everything out of you and get
[1:01:22] everything he wants and I've already
[1:01:24] told him I said you remember John lutein
[1:01:26] the one the guy that sing Amazing Grace
[1:01:29] do you remember if you don't know go
[1:01:32] search it God use a bed to bring him to
[1:01:36] his knees and he came and sung one of
[1:01:39] the Beautiful song the world has ever
[1:01:42] seen why because people like that it
[1:01:46] takes God himself to do that
[1:01:50] and I told him that I came
[1:01:53] we spent two weeks so the second week
[1:01:56] Friday going the second week
[1:01:59] brother Daniel asked me
[1:02:02] to speak on Sunday
[1:02:05] that was their last sermon
[1:02:10] and the Lord placed on my heart he asked
[1:02:13] me what title do you have I says brother
[1:02:15] you are you brother brother you have the
[1:02:18] title on your team already I won't
[1:02:20] change it
[1:02:22] the title is take your inheritance
[1:02:26] so the Lord placed on my heart
[1:02:29] to speak
[1:02:31] on
[1:02:33] about take John 8 read John Saint John
[1:02:38] chapter 8 I took I talk about Mary
[1:02:41] Martin
[1:02:43] and talking about who they are talking
[1:02:47] about David how David committed adultery
[1:02:51] but he was a man after God God's Own
[1:02:54] Heart talking about uh Jose
[1:02:57] who preach as a prophet the Lord told
[1:03:00] him to marry a prostitute after he
[1:03:02] preached finish the man is going to a
[1:03:05] prostitute to get his wife out
[1:03:08] and just imagine
[1:03:10] how
[1:03:12] if he is your pastor what would you
[1:03:15] think the man has preached a sermon
[1:03:18] delivered a wonderful sermon and after
[1:03:21] the service the man is going to a
[1:03:23] prostitute to pick up his uh
[1:03:26] prostitution area to pick up his wife
[1:03:28] and you see him as a Believer what would
[1:03:31] you say
[1:03:33] and I was preaching around that around
[1:03:36] through the message
[1:03:38] our brothers from the pastor to the
[1:03:41] deacons has brought and I put it
[1:03:43] together the Lord let me
[1:03:46] put it together
[1:03:48] and I brought it and the Holy Spirit
[1:03:51] begin to move
[1:03:52] God on the back this side I see people
[1:03:56] shouting oh and these people believers
[1:03:59] they are not literate like me they are
[1:04:02] graduates
[1:04:04] they shouting and praising God like that
[1:04:07] even oh mine and God begin to move and
[1:04:13] showing them get away from the
[1:04:15] legalistics
[1:04:16] get away from your own man-made ideas
[1:04:19] you think you gonna explain God by using
[1:04:23] the letter with your own brains I am God
[1:04:29] I am God
[1:04:30] I interpret my own word what I need from
[1:04:34] you is your heart give me thy heart and
[1:04:38] when I wanted to speak I will speak when
[1:04:41] I wanted to correct I will call it
[1:04:43] you don't have to interpret the word I
[1:04:46] will interpret the word all I need is
[1:04:48] you surrendering to me
[1:04:51] yes God begin to move in that round
[1:04:55] cut it cut all those loose and
[1:04:58] legalistics and things that are hidden
[1:05:01] in the message and the Lord begin to
[1:05:04] speak how so many preachers has come in
[1:05:07] the message with their five Sons because
[1:05:09] they are so educated they can call the
[1:05:12] prophet message in and out put it
[1:05:14] together but the holy spirit is not
[1:05:16] there
[1:05:18] and this our God is saying
[1:05:22] whom I have predestinated it doesn't
[1:05:26] matter whether he can read or can read I
[1:05:29] the Lord will do the job I the Lord will
[1:05:32] let you know that I'm in that skin I the

[1:17:40] whatever the Lord has told you go and do
[1:17:44] it
[1:17:45] people were asking me
[1:17:48] one brother things that he has gone
[1:17:51] through
[1:17:52] sitting with me he says you every preach
[1:17:56] You Preach expose everything
[1:18:00] he says my God it's like people are
[1:18:05] coming from jail they are in the message
[1:18:07] they were in the message
[1:18:09] but they are coming out from that
[1:18:12] message to step up to take their
[1:18:16] inheritance their inheritance is who
[1:18:19] Christ
[1:18:21] Christ the lord
[1:18:23] but we who are here
[1:18:26] God has opened our eye
[1:18:29] through the faithful Ministry
[1:18:32] we know a lot and sometimes we become
[1:18:35] lazy
[1:18:36] we don't want to even eat the way we
[1:18:39] don't want to come to the house of God
[1:18:41] come
[1:18:43] come
[1:18:44] eat it eat it be like a cow because God
[1:18:49] is up to something big
[1:18:52] God will never fail you
[1:18:55] this message when you eat it is sweeter
[1:18:59] in your mouth
[1:19:00] but better in your belly so a lot of
[1:19:03] people don't want the beta they want to
[1:19:06] run away from the bearer let me tell you
[1:19:09] it's not easy
[1:19:11] there's not anybody you see them
[1:19:15] preaching this gospel that's coming out
[1:19:17] the word coming out powerful they pay
[1:19:20] price
[1:19:21] high price
[1:19:23] yes high price
[1:19:26] if you compare that high price you can
[1:19:30] never win the reward
[1:19:31] we just saw the soccer game
[1:19:34] right
[1:19:36] you saw the soccer game
[1:19:38] some people
[1:19:40] my own country Ghana they want to just
[1:19:42] go and and play like they play at the
[1:19:46] back oh they just call them and push
[1:19:48] them out
[1:19:49] right just like some of
[1:19:53] the people that
[1:19:55] when they come in Christ they won't get
[1:19:58] serious they won't pour their heart they
[1:20:02] won't do things that will support the
[1:20:05] ministry
[1:20:06] they will not do things that will
[1:20:09] benefit the kingdom of God and prosper
[1:20:13] their own life God
[1:20:15] is telling us the hour has come
[1:20:20] you that are here I have trained you
[1:20:24] Pastor Simon has poor all his heart what
[1:20:28] God give it to him I believe he has pour
[1:20:31] it because when I was in Ghana I saw
[1:20:34] myself
[1:20:35] let me tell you you think brother coffee
[1:20:37] is so small don't know nothing but when
[1:20:41] I speak and the people who are preachers
[1:20:43] coming to me so brother you have a
[1:20:46] unique Ministry and I'm looking myself
[1:20:50] me
[1:20:52] the people who has finished University
[1:20:57] they know their message in and out
[1:20:59] they let them out
[1:21:01] I can't even when they are speaking I
[1:21:05] can't even speak I have to shut my mouth
[1:21:07] because otherwise they'll put me to
[1:21:10] sleep
[1:21:12] but let me tell you
[1:21:15] it's not the letter that's why the Bible
[1:21:18] says the letter kill it
[1:21:21] but the spirit gave life
[1:21:24] is the life that is within the letter
[1:21:27] when you have that life
[1:21:30] that life will project then the Letter
[1:21:33] People
[1:21:34] they know
[1:21:36] that my God God is in this brother God
[1:21:40] is in this system God is in this
[1:21:43] in his King then they got shocked
[1:21:47] they get because they sin they can't
[1:21:50] deny it people listen when I didn't
[1:21:55] create nobody you didn't create nobody
[1:21:57] God created them so in their heart God
[1:22:00] will make let them know that is him
[1:22:04] let me tell you
[1:22:07] letters
[1:22:10] trust God
[1:22:12] because
[1:22:14] he's moving
[1:22:17] he's moving
[1:22:20] this good neighbor Ministry he has
[1:22:23] buried
[1:22:24] not even Pastor someone Betty
[1:22:27] do you know that it's not Pastor Simon
[1:22:29] that did it is God that place in him to
[1:22:32] do what he did
[1:22:34] otherwise he himself cannot do it
[1:22:38] he can do it
[1:22:40] it's God
[1:22:43] you Chuck in the Bible the Lord says I
[1:22:47] will build my church
[1:22:49] and against of us shall not Prevail
[1:22:51] against it
[1:22:53] is
[1:22:56] woman will be the church
[1:22:59] the Lord will bury it but he uses man
[1:23:04] the Lord uses man
[1:23:07] right that's why the Lord
[1:23:10] he has ordained Pastor Simon at the age
[1:23:12] of 12 he goes to him reveal himself to
[1:23:16] him because he have the mission
[1:23:18] that you want him to accomplish so he he
[1:23:21] began to identify himself in that King
[1:23:24] say his son this is what I brought you
[1:23:27] for this is what I'm going to use you
[1:23:30] for and begin to break him breaking a
[1:23:34] little bit breaking here breaking here
[1:23:36] until the evidence is you and me
[1:23:39] the evidence is you and me
[1:23:42] amen and if we look into our life me
[1:23:45] since I was seven years
[1:23:47] sitting in my grandmother house in front
[1:23:50] I saw a plane passing through night
[1:23:53] Darkness
[1:23:55] I never see plane on the ground and the
[1:23:58] Lord spoke to me
[1:23:59] at the age of seven
[1:24:01] he spoke to me in African jungle he said
[1:24:04] you see this plane when you grow you'll
[1:24:07] be sitting and going and coming
[1:24:11] sometime I'm sleeping I'm so depressed
[1:24:14] a voice will wake me up in African
[1:24:17] jungle before I came to contact the
[1:24:20] message God was speaking to me otherwise
[1:24:23] I supposed to die
[1:24:27] you the same way
[1:24:30] because you've been ordained to be here
[1:24:34] you're being ordained to be under that
[1:24:37] Ministry because now I know
[1:24:40] I am the light of the world you are the
[1:24:44] light of the world
[1:24:45] because Christ is in you
[1:24:48] Christ is the light of the world

[1:25:13] that light shine so that somebody can
[1:25:16] get hold of that light
[1:25:19] and transform him or her
[1:25:22] wherever you go
[1:25:24] let me tell you before my eye if the
[1:25:27] Lord tally
[1:25:28] and my eyes should close down
[1:25:31] and go in the grave absent from this
[1:25:34] body I'm present with the Lord one thing
[1:25:37] I want to live
[1:25:38] is no Riches of the world

[1:26:35] have confidence in yourself yes have
[1:26:38] confidence that you are the light of the
[1:26:42] world this is the hour when this message
[1:26:46] when parabram used to say I'm going but
[1:26:49] there's some young men that Gonna Come
[1:26:52] that young man
[1:26:55] when he was talking
[1:26:57] he was speaking
[1:26:59] in prophecies
[1:27:02] but now it's realities
[1:27:04] it's realities
[1:27:07] because we are here
[1:27:11] if you if you have an ear to hear
[1:27:14] and I to see you will know what the holy
[1:27:19] spirit is accomplishing what the holy
[1:27:22] spirit is doing

[1:27:37] from north south east west
[1:27:40] God will shake everything even within
[1:27:44] the message he's shaking up
[1:27:47] he's checking on those that have to be
[1:27:49] shaken
[1:27:50] he's checking those that have to be
[1:27:54] shaken because we women beings sometimes
[1:27:58] we want to look oh how this brother is
[1:28:01] great how this brother is not great how

[1:28:16] is the one that is big God is the one
[1:28:19] that will not talk the Lord and Savior
[1:28:22] Jesus Christ
[1:28:23] he said
[1:28:28] look
[1:28:30] even Moses
[1:28:32] look at how naturally how that man was
[1:28:36] great
[1:28:38] how he was educated
[1:28:41] but God most of all the time those type
[1:28:44] of people when God want to use them you
[1:28:47] know what God do
[1:28:49] put them in backside of the desert
[1:28:54] and let him be bust
[1:28:58] when God is doing that he's taking all
[1:29:00] the intellectuals away
[1:29:03] that man
[1:29:04] his credibility will be gone
[1:29:08] nobody will respect him no more
[1:29:11] that's why he told Isaiah go sleep on
[1:29:14] the street cut your your back bottom let
[1:29:18] him see because Isaiah was a very
[1:29:21] intellectual man
[1:29:23] very Leonard man God want him before he
[1:29:26] can really use him you have to bring him
[1:29:29] to this grace
[1:29:31] people who don't owe that man because of
[1:29:33] book
[1:29:34] he has become dummy he is mad now look
[1:29:38] he's sleeping outside with his bum
[1:29:41] nobody will respect that
[1:29:44] that was the time God says I want to get
[1:29:47] my glory from him
[1:29:49] because you know why
[1:29:51] God says wash Isaiah
[1:29:54] go and tell the people
[1:29:57] the way they saw you is not you Isaiah
[1:30:01] is how they look that's how filthy they
[1:30:04] are
[1:30:06] Moses
[1:30:08] 40 years in wilderness
[1:30:11] looking after sheep you think looking
[1:30:14] after sheep is easy go to the farm even
[1:30:16] today
[1:30:17] and mingle yourself around ships all
[1:30:21] your finger if you come here everybody
[1:30:23] will be say oh this guy smell this guy
[1:30:26] stink this guy is stink nobody wants
[1:30:30] that right in public
[1:30:33] that time God says okay I get what I
[1:30:35] want from you Moses now I'm sending you
[1:30:38] down to Egypt go and bring my people out
[1:30:42] Moses said Lord
[1:30:43] I can't talk because you know why no
[1:30:47] respect
[1:30:48] he's think like a sheep all his
[1:30:50] fingernails the Sheep
[1:30:53] toilet
[1:30:54] is smelling on his skin
[1:30:57] so Moses
[1:30:59] he was a general you don't want to go
[1:31:01] because when he go
[1:31:03] he has to the people he will lose his
[1:31:07] credibility
[1:31:08] and that's what sometimes the Lord does
[1:31:10] with us
[1:31:12] he does with the even the educated
[1:31:14] people
[1:31:16] so that he could get the glory out of
[1:31:19] them
[1:31:23] when it comes like that God is ready to
[1:31:26] move
[1:31:28] God when it comes like that he's ready
[1:31:32] to move
[1:31:34] so many people
[1:31:36] they think
[1:31:38] but Abraham came the message is there
[1:31:41] playing
[1:31:42] they forget what the Bible says it says
[1:31:45] the letter Kelly When brother Abraham
[1:31:47] preached it has become letter
[1:31:49] so they think they can take that and
[1:31:51] interpret it
[1:31:53] but God they say no
[1:31:55] we that are here look what is revealing
[1:31:58] to us he's saying to us it's not your
[1:32:01] education it's not your ability what you
[1:32:05] have done what you know you think is I
[1:32:09] the Lord that does the work
[1:32:12] and all I'm asking you give me thy heart
[1:32:17] if you give me the heart
[1:32:19] I will do it I will perform it
[1:32:23] the one that I wanted to correct him or
[1:32:26] her I would do it
[1:32:28] if I want you to use your mouth to God
[1:32:31] do it you will even recognize how filthy
[1:32:35] I took you from the ditch I took you
[1:32:38] from the mod so you are not going to
[1:32:40] condemn the brother or the sister or
[1:32:43] even The Sinner on the street because
[1:32:45] you think like that either not clean you
[1:32:49] up
[1:32:50] so you you you talking to the person
[1:32:53] you're even feeling sympathy for them
[1:32:56] your heart is burning out for them you
[1:33:00] showing Grace
[1:33:02] you're showing grace Amazing Grace to
[1:33:05] them because Grace
[1:33:08] will bring the person to Christ without
[1:33:11] you showing Grace
[1:33:13] legalistics has gone in the message for
[1:33:16] so long
[1:33:18] and God doesn't like that
[1:33:20] he want us to show Grace
[1:33:23] Grace will let you love one another
[1:33:27] Grace will let you have patience Grace
[1:33:31] will let you know that God has done so
[1:33:34] much for you
[1:33:36] and God is the one that is doing it not
[1:33:39] you that's the way I see myself I see
[1:33:43] myself right now that if it wasn't his
[1:33:46] grace where would I be
[1:33:48] where would I be you if it wasn't God
[1:33:51] grace where would you be
[1:33:55] God
[1:33:57] was showing all this
[1:33:59] when I was in Ghana
[1:34:01] to the people the Believers they
[1:34:04] says look
[1:34:06] top your legalistics
[1:34:08] stop it
[1:34:10] get into Grace
[1:34:14] get into Grace
[1:34:16] because my grace will bring my children
[1:34:19] to me
[1:34:21] my grace that I have shown to you go out
[1:34:24] and show Grace I have mercy upon you you
[1:34:29] now go and pass that Mercy to the people
[1:34:32] out there

[1:34:41] show to you they will come the one that
[1:34:45] are mine I will bring them
[1:34:47] I will bring them not you
[1:34:51] you know this you know this coaching
[1:34:53] this coating that sometimes we use the
[1:34:55] same Bible or brother Abraham word and
[1:34:59] slap one another or be the people one
[1:35:02] another because we know we think we know
[1:35:06] we don't know nothing
[1:35:08] I don't know nothing
[1:35:11] now I want to be obedient to him
[1:35:16] when he asked me coffee speak I will
[1:35:19] speak because you can't speak I'll hold
[1:35:22] my mouth

[1:35:53] prostitute again
[1:35:54] when that Grace was showing to the woman
[1:35:57] otherwise did you saw that woman have
[1:36:01] five men sleeping with them again

[1:41:45] human beings if you don't read the word
[1:41:47] they're gonna say you didn't read the
[1:41:49] scripture the man has preached with no
[1:41:52] scripture
[1:41:53] but the word will cap it as our pastor I
[1:41:58] see him sometimes do okay okay may we
[1:42:02] stand up
[1:42:03] Saint John chapter 8.
[1:42:06] as we read the word
[1:42:09] Jesus went into the Mount of Olives
[1:42:13] and early in the morning he come again
[1:42:16] into the temple and all the people come
[1:42:20] unto him and
[1:42:22] he sat down and taught them and the
[1:42:27] scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a
[1:42:31] woman taking in adultery and when they
[1:42:35] had set her in the midst they said unto
[1:42:40] him Master this woman was taken in
[1:42:44] adultery in the very Act
[1:42:47] now Moses in the law commanded us that
[1:42:53] sex should be stoned but what says Thou
[1:42:58] you see
[1:42:59] but what says now why are they saying
[1:43:03] that
[1:43:04] they attempting Jesus they want him to
[1:43:07] go contrary to his word but they failed
[1:43:09] to recognize that he was the way and you
[1:43:12] are the world today when the devil come
[1:43:15] to you he don't recognize that he's
[1:43:17] standing in front of the word that you
[1:43:19] has made flesh the bride is the word for
[1:43:23] the day so he can never concise
[1:43:26] because he could never conquer our
[1:43:28] master
[1:43:30] they said unto him Master this woman was
[1:43:33] taking adulteress in the very act Moses
[1:43:36] in the law commanded us that said should
[1:43:39] be stoned but what says Thou this they
[1:43:44] said tempting him that they might have
[1:43:48] to accuse him but Jesus stood down and
[1:43:52] with his finger wrote on the ground as
[1:43:56] though he had
[1:43:58] he had them not
[1:44:01] so one day
[1:44:03] continued asking him he lift up himself
[1:44:07] and said unto them he that is without
[1:44:11] sin among you let him face cast a stone
[1:44:16] at her
[1:44:17] what he's saying taught us unbelief of
[1:44:21] God way and they don't have the word so
[1:44:24] they are sinners the Pharisees back
