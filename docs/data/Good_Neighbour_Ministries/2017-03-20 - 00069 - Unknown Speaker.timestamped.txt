[0:00] amen and amen the Lord bless you real
[0:03] good please be
[0:06] seated of course in 1
[0:10] Thessalonians uh chapter 3 the Bible
[0:13] says I would not have you ignorant
[0:15] Brethren concerning them which are
[0:16] asleep let you sorrow not even as others
[0:20] which have no hope for if you believe
[0:22] that Jesus died and rose again even so
[0:25] them also which sleep in Jesus will God
[0:28] bring with him good on to say in verse
[0:30] 16 for the Lord himself shall descend
[0:34] from heaven with the Shout with the
[0:36] voice of the Archangel and with the
[0:38] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[0:40] shall rise first and we which are alive
[0:42] and remain shall be caught up together
[0:45] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[0:48] in the air Comfort one another with
[0:51] these words Lord bless your real good
[0:54] now Saints through all the ages through
[0:58] all ages have been waiting on this one
[1:01] thing you're coming of the
[1:04] Lord way back from the time of even Noah
[1:07] if we're already waiting on the coming
[1:09] of the Lord Brother random says in a few
[1:12] words that I always love I just love the
[1:15] sound of it he says there is no future
[1:19] but the coming of the Lord this Earth
[1:22] all the systems of the world even us as
[1:25] individuals we really don't have a
[1:27] future except a coming of the Lord amen
[1:31] many of the saints of God died in faith
[1:34] believing in the coming of the Lord
[1:37] their faith was so fervent so fresh that
[1:41] they believe it would be
[1:42] tomorrow and so they had to be they felt
[1:45] a sense of urgency so that they would be
[1:48] ready for today I don't know if you ever
[1:51] felt that feeling but when I got first
[1:54] received the message I wanted to be
[1:57] baptized right away because I did not
[1:59] want want to be caught with the Rapture
[2:01] coming and I'm not I'm not baptized you
[2:05] know in the grace of God and and you
[2:08] couldn't tell me any difference and some
[2:11] of the Saints back in the old country
[2:13] when they heard the word of God they
[2:15] were so zealous we baptized them in
[2:18] Midnight we baptized some in ditches you
[2:21] know they didn't care about whether the
[2:23] water was clean dirty or nothing they
[2:26] want to be baptized now what the Rapture
[2:29] could be tonight night right it was that
[2:32] urgent but you know uh and so they serve
[2:36] the Lord with a fervency because the
[2:38] this expectation that the Lord can come
[2:40] any moment amen but it seems like the
[2:44] church has lost that kind of fervency
[2:47] and that kind of
[2:49] expectation and uh are not getting
[2:53] ourselves really prepared and zealous at
[2:57] the coming of the Lord there becoming a
[3:00] laidback uh leian attitude upon the
[3:03] church well the Lord is coming it
[3:05] doesn't really matter I just go about my
[3:07] regular business and do whatever I have
[3:09] to do and and and no more you don't feel
[3:12] that kind of vibration going through the
[3:15] Saints where there really fired up and
[3:18] ferment because they recognize the
[3:21] coming of the Lord can be
[3:22] tonight and I I don't want to be caught
[3:26] brother Bram loves to sing that song
[3:28] what then what then when the Great book
[3:33] is open what then when the ones that's
[3:37] rejected this message tonight will be
[3:41] asked to give a reason what then he said
[3:45] when the bibles are laid in the Altar
[3:47] and the last sermons being preached what
[3:50] then amen praise God so we hear these
[3:53] things but there are Saints thousands of
[3:56] saints through thousands of Ages out
[3:59] waiting on one climax of our faith and
[4:03] that climax is the coming of the Lord
[4:06] amen amen amen praise God and I I don't
[4:10] know about you but I can't wait am I
[4:14] can't wait to finish my mission on Earth
[4:17] and get out of here praise God whatever
[4:21] God wants me to accomplish I want to
[4:23] accomplish it amen once that is over I'm
[4:27] I'm ready to leave I'm ready to go
[4:29] praise God hallelujah God there's a land
[4:32] beyond the river there's a better land
[4:36] praise God there's no heart takes
[4:38] there's no pains there's no trouble no
[4:41] rent to pay no worrying about mortgage
[4:45] worrying about uh irsp and all these
[4:48] things and woring about whe I have a
[4:51] house I don't have a house or have a car
[4:53] don't have a car just imagine to live in
[4:56] a world where your whole being is
[4:59] absolutely free from Toy free from free
[5:04] from sorrow free from all needs free
[5:08] wants free yesu it's hard for us to
[5:11] imagine being humans because we're born
[5:13] in a world that it is just full of
[5:16] trouble and the Bible says mind born and
[5:19] sin is full of trouble come to the world
[5:22] speaking lies that's all our days that
[5:25] we know as days of trouble and some of
[5:30] us the only peace you have is when you
[5:32] fall asleep if you fall asleep but the
[5:35] fact is that's where it is we don't have
[5:38] any real future but the coming of the
[5:40] Lord amen we're just working saving uh
[5:44] you know putting aside something to keep
[5:47] our lives uh uh without Satan being able
[5:50] to disrupt our lives too much you know
[5:53] to be a buffer against the things that
[5:56] he would bring against us to keep your
[5:58] body and soul United long enough to
[6:01] accomplish what God wants to
[6:04] accomplish and then he'll call us home
[6:06] amen come home it's supper time the
[6:10] evening Shadows Fall amen praise God
[6:13] well brother tells us already it's been
[6:15] evening time evening evening time has
[6:19] come it's here it's fast then letter we
[6:22] preach watch my water of the night
[6:25] midnight he said we are the CL time
[6:28] clock is tracking hour Jesus will soon
[6:31] descend clothed in garments of power the
[6:35] rain of sin to End Amen midnight then he
[6:38] comes and says after that if you watch
[6:41] how the the message and the pace of it
[6:43] he comes down to the end it is the
[6:45] rising of the Sun what the morning is
[6:49] breaking Jesus is coming and as the sun
[6:53] begins to rise up and the Revelation
[6:55] becomes clearer and clearer he says the
[6:58] light begins to push way the bloom and
[7:00] the Darkness and the fog not just the
[7:03] natural one in Genesis 1 that he was
[7:06] talking about but he says evil your soul
[7:09] praise God Amen if you had a foggy
[7:12] understanding and a revelation of this
[7:14] word once that s begins to come up that
[7:17] begins to burn away the all the fals
[7:20] delad all the your personal ideas that
[7:23] you had your different practic
[7:26] interpretations the sunlight comes up
[7:29] and the light shines and pushes the
[7:31] darkness out praise God hallelujah so
[7:35] I'm thankful for the C of the Lord

[8:00] the Holy Ghost praise God when every
[8:04] favor of your being is filled with the
[8:07] Holy Ghost when every member of the body
[8:10] of Christ is filled with the Holy Ghost

[8:22] California TRS All Around Jesus
[8:26] Hallelujah Jesus Christ thank you make
[8:29] itself manifested In the Flesh in the
[8:33] form of a prophet in the last day amen
[8:37] you don't believe that a prophet is not
[8:40] just a foreteller he's a fork teller
[8:43] he's a sear or a sear of the word a sear
[8:47] of things to come but he is also a
[8:51] predestinated body that God plac in a
[8:54] certain age that he's going to express
[8:56] his word true to be the voice of God to
[8:59] these last
[9:00] days and that's what brother Bram was
[9:04] I'm sure if you don't know it right now
[9:06] on the Internet is circulating the
[9:08] vision of Brother David M somebody I
[9:10] know uh or knew from many years ago and
[9:14] uh how that um this not Vision but how a
[9:19] rabbi had a vision a Jewish rabbi had a
[9:22] vision and um and in the vision he was
[9:26] told

[23:41] Rapture is now in
[23:43] progress
[23:45] amen the Holy Spirit by Revelation
[23:48] changed the Dynamics and says no it's
[23:51] not an event on one certain day like
[23:53] they preached for hundreds of years that
[23:56] all of a sudden you hear a trumpet blow
[23:57] and the great bosted and we all rising
[24:00] up like that now it's funny to us but
[24:02] they we I actually believed it when I
[24:05] was in Pentecostal and gospel R that's
[24:08] how I believe it because we don't know
[24:09] anything different but it took a prophet
[24:12] to come along and says no it's not just
[24:15] an event on a certain day there's a
[24:18] process that goes to that event that's
[24:21] right amen and if you're not caught up
[24:25] in the spirit Hallelujah yes Lord amen
[24:28] praise God Amen if you're not caught up
[24:31] in that
[24:32] process uh there how you going to even
[24:36] be in the event you will be in the event
[24:39] that's why we repeat you must recognize
[24:42] the word in its word form
[24:45] now so that when the word comes back and
[24:48] the word becomes flesh again glorified
[24:52] in more amen but it comes back how you
[24:55] going to recognize it there right
[24:57] because the word is the word being
[24:59] glorified to you amen and if you can't
[25:02] see that when he comes again how you
[25:04] going to recognize him right amen you
[25:07] got to recognize him
[25:09] now oh my you better pray now or you
[25:11] going to pray later whether you like it
[25:13] or not amen praise God hallelujah oh yes
[25:17] Hallelujah we are in the process we are
[25:20] in the bride coming of the Lord right
[25:23] now amen the son of man is to be
[25:26] revealed what and again MH hallelujah
[25:31] amen and right now again it's the head
[25:35] Christ Jesus that was revealed or made
[25:39] himself known back in the gospels and in
[25:42] the Bible that was the head right you
[25:45] had Adam and you had Eve right and Adam
[25:49] was the head of Eve but once he's the
[25:53] head died went to heaven came back
[25:56] poured out the spirit
[25:58] what happened now he's building his own
[26:01] body that's why he told Solomon he says
[26:03] are you going to build me a house the
[26:06] heaven of Heavens can't contain me but
[26:08] mystery of mysteries to think that the
[26:11] god that fills the entire universe could
[26:12] live in you and me amen wow that is
[26:17] amazing and so God is building his own
[26:19] house how wonderful to know that he's
[26:23] building his own house in this hour and
[26:25] we are a part of that process am when
[26:28] the last one comes in and the last nail
[26:31] is clinched the whole thing goes out
[26:34] amen it'll be too late then oh my praise
[26:38] God I repeat what a words of my mother I
[26:40] always remember her singing or or saying
[26:43] some of these things she says and too
[26:46] late too late shall be the cry Jesus of
[26:48] Nazareth has passed you by wow think
[26:52] about it brothers and sisters the people
[26:55] there's thousands out there sincere
[26:57] people track in these prisons with st
[27:00] glass windows calling out Angel waiting
[27:04] on the coming of the Lord just like you
[27:07] believing the same scriptures that you
[27:09] are believeing and they'll pray they cry
[27:13] and they'll weep over the same
[27:15] scriptures right with no understanding
[27:18] amen and no
[27:20] Revelation and the whole thing is
[27:23] passing them right by and they hardly
[27:26] recognize it and here we are sitting in
[27:30] the Lifeboat we're floating down the
[27:32] stream of time we have not long to
[27:36] stay it's wonderful isn't it am Noah
[27:40] inside of the Ark the ark floating and
[27:43] the rest of them don't realize the
[27:45] rising tide of sin and evil is all is
[27:48] coming up at first they're not worried
[27:50] too much because you know the water they
[27:52] can walk around they can wave but when
[27:54] it starts to get really deep now and
[27:57] they realize their fall it's too late
[27:59] then the water is too much the sin the
[28:02] insanity the evil the devilry is gone so
[28:06] far that they can't stand it they can't
[28:09] take it anymore it shall come to pass
[28:11] said the prophet of Malachi 4 that the
[28:14] entire world will go
[28:17] insane except for those members that are
[28:20] in the bright why because you come back
[28:24] from being in sin or being born inane
[28:30] actually and now you have received your
[28:34] right mind like the man that was in the
[28:38] tombs you remember Jesus cast out all
[28:41] them Legions of demons that were in him
[28:44] Legions of all kind of beliefs unbelief
[28:47] all kind of mix up Devils got in your
[28:49] life and everything else cast everyone
[28:51] about and then the Bible says and when
[28:53] he left him he was in his right mind and
[28:56] clothed
[28:58] praise the Lord and when salvation came
[29:01] to you for free he put on the robe of
[29:04] righteousness on you and brought you
[29:06] back to your right

[29:21] renewed by the renewing of the Mind

[29:50] recognizing it amen praise the Lord but
[29:53] for us God slowly brought brought us
[29:56] back to a right mind by by showing you a
[29:59] little scripture and then you realize oh

[32:04] shout what is it it's the message trying
[32:08] to get the people together that message
[32:12] comes first Hallelujah that shout is the
[32:16] message praise God and when them seals

[32:23] Divine call calling out a group a
[32:27] special group of people Amen to do what

[32:51] he's a parent already among us as a
[32:54] parent preceding this coming praise the
[32:56] Lord that is why brother Bale and many
[32:59] of these saints were trying they felt it
[33:01] they they they felt it in their Spirit
[33:03] they caught something when they started
[33:05] talking about
[33:06] perusia it really was the appearing of
[33:09] the Lord supernaturally spiritually
[33:12] among the people amen praise God that
[33:16] was just a a precursor that was not the
[33:18] full coming of the Lord that was part of
[33:21] the coming of the Lord are you
[33:23] understand me praise the name of the
[33:25] Lord that was part of the
[33:28] of the Lord hallelujah there's no
[33:30] denying about it and that's the reason
[33:33] why um a lot of these brothers they say
[33:37] oh this about brother oh thatan
[33:40] preaching seven Tong that one preach
[33:42] about the peria brother Jones down in
[33:44] the South there preaching about two
[33:47] souls and and they come down against
[33:49] these brothers I said the Holy Spirit
[33:51] made me clear he says no what this is it
[33:55] first of all to Jones
[33:58] what the Lord was revealing is that you
[34:01] must be born again in the message at
[34:04] that time when he started preaching that
[34:06] stuff people were believing they come
[34:08] out to Pentecost come to these gospel
[34:10] churches and they come in the message
[34:12] and they're already saved right but then
[34:15] he took it one step too far right when
[34:18] he took it that step too far then he
[34:21] went off but really that was his message
[34:23] and God uses men like that he used men
[34:26] to bring bring the groups this far then
[34:29] he raises up the next one and that one
[34:31] comes up and he brings Revelation seven
[34:34] Thunders amen the voice of God
[34:37] hallelujah coming out of those seals
[34:39] nobody knew anything like that when that
[34:40] man started preaching that and let me
[34:42] tell you I was there because he was the
[34:46] one that really s for me to come out to
[34:48] South America many he saw heard what the
[34:50] Lord was doing been a young young man

[35:19] and you know the rest of it he became a
[35:21] major minister with the message around
[35:23] the world woke up all the ministers
[35:25] because what happened the next morning
[35:28] wheat was all over the streets in
[35:29] Manhattan they don't know where it come
[35:31] from they're all shocked they don't know
[35:34] what's going on after that preaching the
[35:36] message the Lord was just keeping the
[35:38] word amen I remember another time you
[35:41] were in right there in Montreal it

[35:54] so much amen you for him or you against
[35:57] him
[35:58] glory to God hallelujah but towards the
[36:00] end he started getting to the point
[36:03] where people thinking he's the next
[36:05] messenger after brother BR and then he
[36:07] starts your time is up you start going
[36:09] into all kinds of stuff it's got nothing
[36:12] to do with the man and what he
[36:14] accomplished bringing in tens of
[36:16] thousands of people into the message

[42:34] time this is the coming of the Lord in
[42:37] the middle of it praise God forever more
[42:41] I look I can almost taste and see that
[42:45] the Lord is good amen praise God like
[42:49] brother brother P's father told told his
[42:52] mother uh you know he says he says
[42:54] sweetheart he says whatever you're
[42:56] cooking there it's so nice he said I

[43:02] breeze I don't need to put it in the
[43:05] grave I can just sof the breeze it's so
[43:09] tasty glory to God but the coming of the
[43:11] Lord is like that it's so close and and

[43:17] that you can almost chaste and see amen
[43:20] the Lord is good amen praise God
[43:23] hallelujah oh I preached a message
[43:25] several years ago I go amen that about
[43:30] enjoying the powers of the world to come
[43:34] the world to come is now projecting
[43:36] itself in this Dimension Hallelujah and
[43:38] we being caught up in it and we are
[43:41] starting to taste some of the power of
[43:43] the world to come what a what a Time
[43:46] brothers and sisters that we living in
[43:48] for this day and time praise God
[43:50] hallelujah amen this now he
[43:54] says the Harvest Time the secret coming
[43:58] of the Lord Jesus she'll be taken away
[44:01] and the rest of them will go right on
[44:05] preaching like they always done as it
[44:08] was in the days of Noah and the flood
[44:12] come tribulation is talking about amen
[44:15] comes upon them you know Enoch is a typ
[44:18] of the Bride being called up
[44:22] before Noah is a type of the tribulation
[44:25] saint amen that will go through the
[44:28] flood amen amen always remember that
[44:31] that's the type for it sometimes but you
[44:33] know all types as compound meanings
[44:37] sometimes we refer to that also like it
[44:39] was a part of us being saved uh by the
[44:42] blood and going across the the sea and
[44:45] stuff like that amen but truly that is
[44:48] it amen Christ as he said here is
[44:50] already here in the spirit form in the
[44:54] opening of the seventh seal which has
[44:57] been identified as the coming of the
[45:00] Lord amen that is why it was a secret
[45:04] and the half our silence because no man
[45:07] knew nobody knew the devil didn't know
[45:10] it was shock into the devil he he didn't
[45:12] even know so it shocked him because God
[45:15] had to keep it a secret amen oh my
[45:18] there's only one Phoenix left and that
[45:21] is the coming of the Lord Jesus amen
[45:24] praise God you know of course a female
[45:27] don't want to explain that but that's an
