[27:24] Hallelujah
[27:26] praise the Lord
[27:29] thank you Lord Jesus we see Jesus was
[27:33] born in Bethlehem of Judea
[27:36] to Mary and Joseph
[27:38] as his natural periods man say do he
[27:43] didn't come from
[27:45] from Mary but
[27:48] he was just
[27:50] he passed through Mary and they were
[27:53] just yet to nurture him and grow him up
[27:56] amen praise the Lord
[28:00] he grew up amongst the common folks
[28:03] and was very familiar with all the
[28:07] customs and culture of that time
[28:11] amen
[28:13] just as we grew up in any culture
[28:16] amen we get accustomed with the culture
[28:20] the language the environment and
[28:22] everything
[28:23] man Hallelujah
[28:27] a key to understanding the Bible is the
[28:31] fact that Jesus and his disciples were
[28:35] galileans
[28:37] except for Judas
[28:40] could you put slight tree from it please
[28:43] we see in John
[28:48] chapter 1 45 and 46 man
[28:53] Philip Fong Nathaniel and said unto him
[28:57] we have found him
[28:59] of whom Moses in the law and the
[29:03] prophets did right
[29:05] Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph
[29:10] and Nathaniel said unto him can there
[29:13] any good thing come out of Nazareth
[29:17] Philip said unto him come and see
[29:21] amen
[29:22] come and see
[29:24] amen so someone else have told you about
[29:26] the message a man testified to you a
[29:30] witness to you amen and you must have
[29:33] had questions in your heart amen any
[29:36] person invited you come and see for
[29:38] yourself
[29:39] amen
[29:41] amen is not what somebody else gonna
[29:43] tell you but come and have your personal
[29:46] experience
[29:48] Hallelujah
[29:51] praise the Lord
[29:54] and natanya said unto him can there any
[29:57] good thing come out of Nazareth amen
[29:59] Philip said to them come and see what
[30:02] did Nathaniel mean by that
[30:05] amen and I did a little research and
[30:08] read a few commentaries around along
[30:10] that subject man
[30:12] you see Galilee stood out from the rest
[30:15] of Israel
[30:17] they did not blend in well
[30:21] the region was viewed as remote
[30:24] away from the center of Jerusalem and
[30:27] those who have been in Jerusalem knew
[30:30] know that for a fact it's quite a
[30:33] distance away from Jerusalem itself
[30:37] which is very hectic and busy and all
[30:40] the Commerce and everything that is
[30:42] there amen hallelujah
[30:45] so when Nathaniel
[30:48] When Praise the Lord whenever
[30:52] he asks nathanielas you know could any
[30:56] good thing come out from that place amen
[30:58] because it was no entire region that the
[31:03] people were not well off
[31:05] common folks men Hallelujah
[31:09] they were not sophisticated
[31:12] amen hallelujah
[31:16] praise the Lord
[31:18] one author wrote the province of Galilee
[31:21] is spoken as having at that period one
[31:24] of the most obscure and despised of the
[31:28] Roman Empire
[31:30] another Nazareth has The Misfortune of
[31:34] Being represented as then as an
[31:37] insignificant Village
[31:41] whose inhabitants were ignorant
[31:44] and they were considered immoral
[31:48] by the by by their comparison to their
[31:53] teachings and whatever man Hallelujah so
[31:57] it was not like a known Factor among the
[32:00] people nothing good could come out from
[32:01] that place
[32:03] you know
[32:05] it's just like you know some cities
[32:07] being despised you know like the slums
[32:10] and whatever what
[32:12] what could come out from
[32:13] as we might say sometimes we might we
[32:16] talk about the queens or some other
[32:18] platter the world of country that you
[32:21] know they look down they look down on
[32:23] them
[32:24] Hallelujah
[32:27] now Jesus spoke to his disciples and to
[32:31] his congregation in the Galilean
[32:34] language
[32:36] and used as we may say simple down to
[32:41] earth illustrations
[32:43] to get his message and teachings across
[32:47] to the people
[32:50] amen hallelujah you see us follow as
[32:54] well
[32:55] fishermen
[32:57] farmers
[32:58] he grew up as a carpenter
[33:01] amen
[33:03] they were like you know come on folks
[33:06] amen
[33:07] so in the book of Saint Luke we read the
[33:11] Common People heard him gladly
[33:17] Hallelujah
[33:19] today we may say oh that's just a common
[33:23] bunch
[33:26] amen
[33:28] but Lord that Bunch that heard you when
[33:32] you were in the flesh the common people
[33:35] they heard you gladly
[33:38] the haughty the rich and many of those
[33:42] who would not hear you
[33:45] the king's the potentiates the priests
[33:48] of the day would not hear you but such
[33:53] people as us
[33:57] heard you receive your message
[34:00] here to the call
[34:03] Hallelujah
[34:05] you see what is hidden
[34:08] from the wise and the prudent
[34:11] the higher name mighty
[34:13] Hallelujah God reveal it unto babes and
[34:18] as such as we learn
[34:21] so if you have a receptive Heart Tonight
[34:24] God is willing to receive reveal himself
[34:28] to you
[34:31] Hallelujah
[34:32] blessed be his wonderful name
[34:35] thank you Lord Jesus you see he spoke in
[34:38] parables
[34:40] so the the the simple could understand a
[34:44] sore went for to so seen
[34:46] he spoke about a mustard seed he spoke
[34:50] about putting a whole piece of garment
[34:52] into a new piece of garment you see
[34:55] these people knew about all these things
[34:57] and they could understand the simple
[34:59] things
[35:01] not highfaluted language in Greek and
[35:05] this and that
[35:07] and all this
[35:09] my my and I have the people more
[35:13] confused they're speaking in a different
[35:15] language and expect you to understand
[35:18] who knows nothing about that language
[35:20] that's why it's happening
[35:22] we go to some recently to our church and
[35:26] they speak in the Latin and the what and
[35:28] whatever you can understand head no tale
[35:31] of what they're saying so you're more
[35:33] confused when you come more than when
[35:36] you went in
[35:37] men so whatever they say you're just
[35:40] received and that's what's happening out
[35:42] there
[35:43] the judge people just gobble up this
[35:45] thing and without researching it and
[35:47] searching it out for themselves for the
[35:49] truth men and the truth is going to set
[35:52] them free amen they're not teach they're
[35:55] not telling the people go search it out
[35:57] in the scriptures and they have their
[35:59] own scripture in order to back up for
[36:01] them teaching
[36:02] they change it around to suit themselves
[36:05] amen hallelujah
[36:07] Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name
[36:11] Hallelujah
[36:13] one of the most prominent of the
[36:16] Galilean customs
[36:19] were their weddings
[36:23] man
[36:24] we see I believe before
[36:30] we perform this first miracle at our
[36:32] wedding
[36:34] and we see in the end before he left he
[36:38] spoke about wedding about bride being
[36:40] caught up with bridegroom and if we go
[36:43] to the Book of Revelation we see the
[36:45] same thing
[36:46] this started off in the Garden of Eden
[36:49] as a family husband and wife and it's
[36:51] going to be ending up as a husband and
[36:53] wife too
[36:56] Hallelujah
[37:00] glory amen
[37:01] thank you Lord Jesus
[37:04] Hallelujah
[37:05] you see the reality of the Rapture is
[37:09] foreshadowed by the ancient Galilean
[37:13] wedding traditions and I just gonna take
[37:16] you through a little bit of that here
[37:18] tonight and I hope you just grasp it and
[37:21] see how it just fits in right
[37:25] and that's why when Jesus Illustrated
[37:28] these things the people knew what he was
[37:30] saying
[37:32] man Hallelujah
[37:34] thank you Lord
[37:37] blessed be his name
[37:39] Hallelujah could you just take a side oh
[37:42] it's up already
[37:49] so the three stages of a typical
[37:53] Galilean wedding was the contract
[37:56] the consummation and the celebration
[38:00] and that could be breaking down broken
[38:03] down into very uh other parts amen and
[38:07] we'll go through them
[38:10] as we know it
[38:12] before our marriage in our customs we
[38:15] have an engagement
[38:18] and in those times they called it the
[38:21] contract
[38:22] a man and a woman is going to enter into
[38:25] a contract and that's what marriage is
[38:28] all about
[38:29] a man and a woman going to be entering
[38:32] into a contract I going to take this
[38:36] woman
[38:37] or the woman said I'm going to take this
[38:40] man
[38:41] and we're going to live the rest of our
[38:43] lives together no matter what happens
[38:47] This Modern Times And this custom
[38:49] started way back amen hallelujah and
[38:53] Jesus was accustomed to the traditional
[38:56] way that was happening Amen in a wedding
[39:00] that's why when you spoke as we're gonna
[39:02] see amen he typically typifies and he
[39:07] fit everything and followed what their
[39:10] traditional wedding system was all about
[39:14] Hallelujah
[39:16] we anointed he has the engagement or the
[39:18] best total between a Young Bride and a
[39:21] groom we see in the ancient Galilean
[39:25] wedding during this time a wedding was
[39:28] the biggest event for anyone
[39:33] and if I could go back to even to my
[39:36] country
[39:37] when we had a wedding
[39:39] you know I have to invite anyone and
[39:41] from the village you know or from The
[39:45] Villages are wrong every as long as they
[39:48] know there is a wedding in town they're
[39:50] showing up and your and you better have
[39:54] enough food
[39:58] it's not too little chickens and things
[40:00] it's cows and goats and chickens and the
[40:05] whole works
[40:07] and everything has flowing the liquids
[40:11] flowing
[40:12] [Laughter]
[40:17] my
[40:20] mind
[40:20] will understand that
[40:24] and some are you here going to
[40:25] understand it too
[40:27] amen really saying you know some people
[40:30] we had a teacher who was a fluid
[40:34] mechanic teacher
[40:36] and he used to hit the bottle regular
[40:39] so one day that took him out the
[40:41] students took him out for they had a
[40:43] graduation celebration right
[40:46] and
[40:47] you know they had a good time
[40:50] right and at the end of it
[40:53] he couldn't the teacher the lecturer he
[40:56] couldn't come out and they start to make
[40:58] it fun with him he said man you cannot
[41:01] hold your liquids
[41:07] you know it was too much for him
[41:10] fluids too much fluids he couldn't hold
[41:12] his liquid
[41:14] that's a joke
[41:17] my my
[41:18] praise the Lord
[41:20] you see whether you were invited or not
[41:23] everyone participated
[41:26] we know about that
[41:28] here you have to have special written
[41:31] invitation
[41:33] and you have to reply to that invitation
[41:35] before you could even enter it
[41:39] my
[41:40] but you know something we have an open
[41:43] invitation
[41:45] amen now we got to respond and after
[41:47] that invitation to this wedding man that
[41:51] we have been speaking so much about
[41:53] my
[41:55] but it's not just an Invitational Luna
[41:58] there's many other little things
[42:00] attached in the invitation that we're
[42:03] going to list just now Hallelujah
[42:07] Hallelujah
[42:09] the bride receives
[42:11] the proposal or the Covenant
[42:15] just as a young man would propose to a
[42:18] young lady
[42:19] amen hallelujah
[42:21] so she's been proposed to we accustomed
[42:24] to artists customary and I loved at
[42:27] these traditions and Customs has passed
[42:30] through to the ages
[42:33] in different cultures
[42:35] in different religions
[42:39] amen because I could remember when I
[42:42] went through this little study I could
[42:45] remember certain
[42:46] sectors or religious sectors in my
[42:49] country perform the same kind of a
[42:51] traditional rituals that these galileans
[42:55] were doing
[42:57] amen so these Customs were handed down
[42:59] men
[43:01] praise the Lord
[43:03] after the proposal amen and the Covenant
[43:07] gifts were exchanged
[43:11] amen
[43:12] Hallelujah
[43:14] and we might know it here at the Dory
[43:19] amen and they'll give that before it was
[43:23] an incentive right
[43:26] to know
[43:28] to the young lady that listen this man
[43:30] could take care of me
[43:33] my
[43:34] is our Lord able to take care of us
[43:41] amen some people only like the gift
[43:43] center
[43:46] but they don't like to give up
[43:49] they have a gimme gimme attitude
[43:52] amen hallelujah praise the Lord and we
[43:56] see that all are wrong the one the gifts
[44:00] they want all the money they want the
[44:02] house they want the land but they don't
[44:04] want to love the man
[44:07] they don't want to submit to him
[44:09] they don't want to have headship
[44:11] amen hallelujah
[44:13] amen hallelujah Glory
[44:17] glory to God thank you Lord Jesus
[44:22] you see God does not force himself upon
[44:27] anyone
[44:30] you have to be you have been given a
[44:33] choice
[44:34] man choose this day who you're going to
[44:38] serve
[44:39] when we talk about predestination and
[44:42] all this thing you see God already knew
[44:44] in his he already seen the past the
[44:48] present and the future and he knows what
[44:50] choice you're gonna make
[44:53] amen so when you already know it's not a
[44:56] program you to to accept him he know you
[45:01] have a free will you're going to love
[45:03] him and receive him amen worship Him
[45:07] amen that's why you place your name in
[45:10] the Lamb's Book of Life he note what
[45:13] choice that you're going to make amen
[45:15] and he placed a certain Joe machine as
[45:18] we listen and Sunday inside of you
[45:22] so that John C got to respond to that
[45:25] call when he makes it
[45:27] [Music]
[45:29] man
[45:30] that's why he said I ain't going to lose
[45:32] any because he knows
[45:34] it's he knows man that you must come
[45:39] Hallelujah
[45:41] thank you Lord
[45:50] see the bride needs to drink from the
[45:54] cup of wine
[45:58] for the Betrayal or the engagement to
[46:01] progress
[46:03] amen
[46:05] so she has
[46:07] to drink from this cup
[46:10] that's been presented to her at this
[46:13] time
[46:14] amen and you're going to see how the
[46:16] Lord
[46:18] portrayed that amen
[46:21] in the Last Supper
[46:23] slide number five please
[46:28] the groom seals with this
[46:33] when the bride knee drinks from this cup
[46:38] she accepts his proposal
[46:41] amen
[46:43] the groom sees with this you are now
[46:47] consecrated to me by the laws of Moses
[46:51] and I will not drink from this cup again
[46:55] until I drink it with you in my father's
[47:01] house
[47:04] you see at the Last Supper Jesus offers
[47:07] his disciples a cup of wine which
[47:10] symbolizes a New Covenant he had with
[47:13] them
[47:14] after the disciples drank from the cup
[47:17] in Matthew 26 29 Jesus said these
[47:21] familiar words to them
[47:24] as the traditional groom from the
[47:27] ancient wedding said to his bride
[47:33] but I say to you I will not drink of
[47:37] this fruit of the vine from now on until
[47:41] that day I drink it with you in my
[47:45] father's Kingdom
[47:47] you see that this cup was given to his
[47:50] disciples to represent a new covenant a
[47:54] new contract
[47:56] symbolizing what the the traditional
[47:59] wedding in a Galilean ceremony was all
[48:02] about
[48:04] amen
[48:06] he would pour out his blood and propose
[48:09] an engagement by pouring and drinking
[48:13] the wine and giving it hit to his
[48:15] disciples
[48:17] at the Last Supper Jesus spoke as a
[48:21] bridegroom
[48:25] just as the ancient Galilean wedding
[48:28] bride sealed the betrothal by taking the
[48:32] cup of Joy which they call it men which
[48:35] was
[48:36] as Jesus said he took the wine amen just
[48:39] as she would take the cup of joy we
[48:42] partake in the New Covenant that Jesus
[48:46] gave us by taking it in communion
[48:51] the cup signifies
[48:54] the acceptance of his terms as a
[48:58] bridegroom
[49:01] man so when you accept him into water
[49:04] baptism
[49:07] all that is part of the Wings
[49:10] amen
[49:12] when he calls you you didn't choose him
[49:15] I know
[49:16] he chose you
[49:19] and you know as we say I choose Jesus as
[49:22] my savior
[49:23] you choose him to no
[49:26] is he made the choice
[49:28] it was his choice to you and it's only
[49:31] by Grace you save
[49:34] my
[49:35] Hallelujah
[49:37] praise be to the name of the Living God
[49:42] now the groom must live be betrothed his
[49:46] bride until the day of the wedding is
[49:50] consummated
[49:52] so we see after this little ceremony he
[49:55] has to leave
[49:57] what did Jesus we're going to call go
[49:59] into a little bit man
[50:03] next we see the groom prepares a new
[50:06] place
[50:09] in the ancient Galilean wedding
[50:11] tradition the groom will then leave the
[50:14] bride and go to his father's house
[50:19] amen
[50:21] you know I would have loved them do I
[50:24] like I like a ladies a diagram and show
[50:28] you these steps at these stages but I by
[50:31] God's grace I I wasn't able to do it and
[50:35] save it amen
[50:37] but God Knows Why so it's a little
[50:41] teaching if you have a tonight
[50:44] see some of your
[50:46] writing and stuff like that which is
[50:48] good
[50:49] for memory and to do a little comparison
[50:52] and a little study on your own too
[50:56] don't take it from my cell phone and you
[50:58] could go back and read it for yourself
[51:00] listen to this steps by steps and
[51:03] compare it how Jesus just went step by
[51:06] step that's why his disciples knew what
[51:10] he was speaking and all the people
[51:11] around him knew what he was speaking
[51:14] about because customary amongst them
[51:18] amen amen hallelujah
[51:23] Hallelujah in the upcoming months the
[51:26] groom will then add rooms to the
[51:29] father's house
[51:31] preparing a place for the bride you see
[51:35] in those days they had a
[51:39] communities or communes like we say so
[51:42] if you had one
[51:44] head of a household
[51:46] and children after them he just keep
[51:49] adding homes adding buildings adding and
[51:52] this was like a big Community family
[51:54] community
[51:56] I guess when you're going to Africa you
[51:59] see many like that everybody there's one
[52:02] that's how I believe how the the the
[52:04] live over there too and many other
[52:06] countries
[52:07] amen they keep adding because they have
[52:11] vast property and they just keep
[52:13] building building building so when Jesus
[52:16] said I go to prepare a place for your
[52:18] mind
[52:21] in the upcoming months wow
[52:24] amen hallelujah the the
[52:27] that prepare rooms amen prepare a place
[52:31] for the bride new furniture tables
[52:34] stools Etc he will prepare the wedding
[52:37] feast too with oil lamps with rocks amen
[52:42] that will be taking place in that new
[52:44] home
[52:48] now Jesus warned his disciples slight
[52:51] sick
[52:52] man in John 14 3 Jesus won his disciples
[52:58] prior to his crucifixion that he would
[53:01] have to leave them
[53:03] amen after the communion amen and he
[53:07] started to speak with them he said
[53:09] listen I gotta have to leave you alone
[53:10] guys
[53:12] I'm leaving you all but gives them this
[53:15] beautiful assurance that the groom gives
[53:18] the bride during the ancient wedding let
[53:21] us read it in John 14 3 and if I go and
[53:26] prepare a place for you I will come
[53:29] again
[53:31] and receive you unto myself that where I
[53:35] am dear you may be also
[53:40] hope you're getting it
[53:42] my
[53:44] it excited me when I was doing this
[53:49] man
[53:51] praise God
[53:52] Jesus states that he will return and
[53:55] take his bride that's where he is
[54:00] amen where he is going to be you're
[54:02] going to be
[54:05] this introduces the Rapture to us
[54:09] amen
[54:10] that he will return for his bride and I
[54:14] love to say not bright wife
[54:20] amen hallelujah
[54:22] Jesus promises that you return for her
[54:26] Jesus tell his bride that there will be
[54:28] those and Earth that will not taste that
[54:33] but until the bride is reunited with the
[54:37] groom much has to take place
[54:40] the bride must prepare for the hour of
[54:44] the coming of the groom
[54:47] material and fabric must be bought for
[54:51] the wedding
[54:54] this took lots of time in the first
[54:57] century
[54:58] and the bride is to be pure and Vigilant
[55:02] as she waited for her groom
[55:05] regardless of how long it takes
[55:12] my
[55:16] you see the groom does not know that
[55:19] they are the hour
[55:21] Amen in their custom so if you have the
[55:24] bride
[55:25] we have the groom and we have the
[55:27] fathers
[55:28] the parents amen
[55:31] Hallelujah
[55:33] neither the groom a bright nudity deity
[55:35] hour the wedding would take place
[55:39] the bride always had to be ready
[55:48] this may seem a little bizarre
[55:52] but it's part of the ancient Galilean
[55:55] wedding tradition
[55:58] no one in entire town knew when the
[56:01] wedding would take place except one
[56:04] person
[56:06] the father of the bridegroom
[56:10] only Galilean weddings had this custom
[56:15] to them it was a surprise wedding
[56:18] the father makes the announcement and
[56:21] the day and the hour son go get your
[56:25] bride
[56:26] the father makes the final inspection
[56:30] to see if all is ready for the bride
[56:38] only he knows the day or the hour
[56:43] slide 7 Jesus tells us
[56:46] no one
[56:48] knows the day or the hour
[56:51] but concerning that they are now no one
[56:54] knows not even the angels of Heaven nor
[56:59] the son but the father only
[57:05] my
[57:09] in Matthew 23 36 man
[57:13] the bride and groom are yearning for
[57:17] what their Union
[57:20] amen the bride and grew my union for
[57:23] their Union but must wait for the
[57:26] father's call
[57:29] what a day that will be
[57:32] when my Jesus I shall see when I look
[57:35] upon his face amen the one who saved me
[57:39] by his grace hallelujah oh what a day of
[57:44] rejoice in that gonna be
[57:46] Hallelujah man are you yawning to meet
[57:49] him
[57:50] foreign
[57:54] Glory Glory
[57:58] you see the bride and groom are yearning
[58:01] for their Union amen our task is not to
[58:04] be focused on his return
[58:07] but to consider the preparations for the
[58:11] return of the groom to us
[58:16] amen
[58:17] we are always to be ready
[58:21] and
[58:23] be viligent and be pure
[58:28] you see the groom returns amen and they
[58:32] are in the ancient Galilean wedding
[58:35] traditions
[58:36] Scholars have found out that the hour of
[58:39] the wedding would be in the middle of
[58:41] the night and that takes me back to a
[58:43] young man I have attended many of those
[58:46] weddings back in my country
[58:49] friends and people from the neighborhood
[58:52] where we're at amen at midnight or close
[58:56] to midnight
[58:58] the bridegroom
[59:00] right
[59:01] they would come
[59:03] and most of the times he would come
[59:06] riding on a white horse
[59:09] well decked off and nice
[59:13] and and they were simple people
[59:16] and the wedding chariot
[59:18] was a heart what
[59:20] right
[59:22] and if we didn't have like electric
[59:24] lights and all these fancy lights we had
[59:27] because we call
[59:29] um take a piece of cloth
[59:31] stick it in a bottle with kerosene or
[59:34] some kind of oil or something and like
[59:37] that
[59:39] and I had that decorated all for lights
[59:41] to for them to to see where they were
[59:43] going at the night
[59:45] my
[59:47] and those weddings were at the middle of
[59:50] the night we can't see and I've
[59:51] witnessed many of them
[59:53] quite a few in my life my time amen so
[59:57] we see here in their Customs most of the
[1:00:01] times
[1:00:02] The wedding will at midnight
[1:00:04] Hallelujah
[1:00:07] praise the Lord remember the Lord that
[1:00:10] is why they needed oil in their lamps
[1:00:14] to be ready to be lit and the bride and
[1:00:18] the bridesmaid are to be redressed and
[1:00:21] ready amen
[1:00:24] the groom would come to his bride in the
[1:00:28] night
[1:00:29] the conditions for the bride was to
[1:00:32] always be pure
[1:00:36] and to sleep in her wedding dress and
[1:00:40] her bridesmaid was there to assist her
[1:00:43] when the groom comes unexpectedly
[1:00:51] an hour that they don't know up
[1:00:57] so they always had to be ready
[1:01:02] man Hallelujah
[1:01:04] will you be ready when Jesus comes
[1:01:09] will you be born again or washed in his
[1:01:12] precious blood
[1:01:13] will your garments be spotless will they
[1:01:17] be as white as snow would you I would
[1:01:20] ask that question would you be ready
[1:01:23] when Jesus comes
[1:01:25] amen hallelujah we sing it but we've got
[1:01:28] to live it
[1:01:30] amen hallelujah
[1:01:32] thank you Lord
[1:01:34] Jesus said his return is Aza
[1:01:38] teeth in the night
[1:01:41] amen Jesus warned his disciples to be
[1:01:44] ready for his second coming in in sec in
[1:01:48] first Thessalonians 5 1 and 2. just as
[1:01:51] the bride we are not to fall asleep
[1:01:54] spiritually as others do but to be pure
[1:01:59] and ready at all times because the groom
[1:02:02] will appear at any moment
[1:02:08] man
[1:02:10] in the ancient ceremony the father makes
[1:02:15] the decision
[1:02:16] he wakes up the groom and the groomsmen
[1:02:19] and say go get your bride now is the
[1:02:22] time
[1:02:25] he blows the trumpet because what we
[1:02:27] call the sofa
[1:02:29] so far
[1:02:31] and blessed to wake up the whole village
