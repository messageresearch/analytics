Lord praise the lord we want to talk about a parable of life's foot race you could say Life's a race but to make it practical I won't be long actually I'd be really brief tonight praise the Lord as you know our sister Teresa Johnson has been called away and gone to be with the Lord praise the Lord uh God bless her and God Comforts and strengthen the family uh wherever they are at this time I know brother Danny uh was up there straight from his place to the hospital and spent time with them and just texted me that he's just left now to come on down home right so may God surround them with his great love and warmth and uh just uh before I came up here I got a text from the old country my eldest brother just went was taken in the hospital and is now their emergency with the major stroke so remember him also in prayer at this particular time praise the Lord God bless you amen I'm not saying that just for sympathy I'm just letting you know how the life of a ministers things like that you know just one thing after the other it just happens and if you're not told then you don't know and the minister just appears you know Victorious all the time wonderful but we have to deal with all these things praise the Lord amen now um let's turn to Hebrews 12. verses 1 and 2 praise the Lord Hebrews 12. verses 1 and 2. okay it's just there all right let's pray and then we'll read the scripture our gracious father once again Lord we come in thy name and regardless o God of any of the activity activities of Satan we come in the name of the Lord with the word of the Lord and we give you glory we give you honor and we give you praise father we pray you'll Lift Us Up Lift us all up and send forty a word in its Simplicity but yet in its power and yet in its glory and yet with its bright and Shining Light take Glory and Honor tonight in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which though so easily be said us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen thanks be to God God bless you please be seated foreign you know that Jesus uh the Bible says without a parable he spake not in other words Jesus's sermons all his everything he said it was done by speaking parables well what's the parable a powerless story he was a storyteller he loved to tell stories and like for instance still asked him Master what should we do then he'll start with the story The a certain man and then you tell that story and then he'll from that story he's going to draw lessons and that's what we're going to do tonight we're going to draw truths we're going to throw out guidelines we're going to draw lessons that God wants us to know out of the word praise the Lord amen so I'm going back to uh brother Branham speaking telling this story and it was about a young boy who entered into a contest and uh the contest he entered into it because he wanted to make his name famous he wanted to be of a great name and become famous and there it is that um in this race this race had rules and and the rules as you know in every race that you give out there has to be rules you just can't go run anywhere and then come back and say you have a prize or uh do something like that you've got to run within the rules and so they were given rules and one of them was that they they will speak a secret word into to this young man and he was to keep that secret word in his mind amen now he was to run the race and to the end of the race then uh they would ask him to speak that secret word again and then they will open a gate and he would be able to enter in to receive his prize and the honor that's due to him for winning the race and all that was made up one to see the IQ of the young person that was running that race if they really just memorized it or if they're really internalize it at it within them so they don't have to think about it when they get to the end of the race they just speak the word it's nothing to them because it's part of them right and so this young man went and took the race amen hallelujah now he said this little boy was very Swift and uh and he knew that he could not run the rest of these young boys but nevertheless he went out and he practiced every day he just practiced and practiced every day for running he did physical training because you know if you're going to run you've got to build your body up right uh and he did all the lifting of weights and the jumping and the running and everything else so that he could be physically fit like you used to be brother Bill amen and uh then he did a lot of uh breath training training his lungs training his breath how to Pace himself how to uh run and not lose his breath but but to run with a certain pacing so that he will keep his heart at a certain rate and he will be able to achieve the greatest amount of speed that he could get and as much oxygen as that he could take in at that time so he did all that but that was no that was the physical then he went and started learning various techniques of running uh and because running as techniques you don't just come off the road and jump in the Olympics and just run and think you're gonna win like that because they have techniques that they actually use and strategies that they actually put in place and if you know it they'll use it and they'll get ahead of you and they'll run away with the prize and so this boy dedicated himself to learning all of those rules and practicing every day and so with all the strategy he did that uh I want to quote brother Brandon said this boy studied that race from every angle that he could uh and his heart and mind was in it and he studied it from every angle that he could oh yes he practiced all the techniques of of uh the technique of starting from the starting blocks you know that you just don't start from the blocks like that you've got to practice how to get out like a lightning bolt out of those blocks you know it reminds me of uh when I did some racing as a young man and uh my wrist happened to be one of the first in the morning and it just so happens that in the West Indies we have a lot to do uh falling every night to do Falls and so and I didn't have spikes and all these things like the uh Runners have I just had a plain uh you know sneaker on right and so uh and everybody expected that I would win but when playing the gun go went like that at night my foot slipped on the grass and if you are running a hundred yards by time your foot slipped like that there halfway already down down the way and uh that was it I lost the race I won't tell you the rest of it it was very embarrassing well I thought I was so fast that I would take off after them catch up with them and pass them but that didn't happen I was left in the middle of the field with everybody looking at me and laughing while the other ones run ahead so that's the way it was because but you see I practice all the techniques um I practice all starting out to the starting blocks and then in the middle of the race how to pace yourself and not go on burn out before you get to the end so that you could as we say Drive the last drive you know come out pop and get to the end there and blast through that tip like that so uh that's the way it is and then you've got to know the technique of when you come to the end of the race how to kind of throw yourself forward so that at least your head would get past that line that ribbon and you would become to the winner your entire body didn't get past the ribbon but you have got past the ribbon and you would be counted as the winner and that's this boy studied every angle every possible way of being able to run this race and he was sure amen that he would be the winner right now in the morning that race started and there was more than 150 boys lined up see there they were oh and while they were waiting for the gun he remembered all of his training oh my and so he got ready got to the line and there it was he had studied him all the rules he was he making himself ready for this and then the gunfired and when it fired you were out of the blocks and they were away see oh my and the boys jumped forward and this little chap was so physically fit that he was out front of all of them and jumped way ahead of the rest of them and down the track he went with terrific speed all there he was terrific speed terrific form you know what form means oh he's pacing his the way he was running was so beautiful as he came down the track right and well-trained he outrun the other boys in the race and he was quite a long time there at the end before the rest of the other Runners ever caught up with him oh my so that means he was a good minute or so ahead and in a race this is that's a lot of time because the seconds matter of fact would be a good distance much less a whole minute that he was ahead amen but all of the physical training didn't help him because he had forgotten the password secret word that was whispered in his ears he forgot the secret word so he got there a minute ahead but the time was spent walking up and down in front of the gate walking up and down in front of the gate hoping that he would remember and all the other boys I can't say all but some of the other boys ran to the gate remember the password walked through the gate and went right in Fast and went right in through the gate and he was left there he had forgotten the secret word the password the very thing that he was to say to let him get inside of that gate he forgot it all oh money he searched and searched through his mind and yet he couldn't find it there oh think about it all the he had been so interested in his natural and physical conditioning of his body till he had forgotten the man saying he was there for so on the on Down the Line some other boys they ran too they didn't run so fast but they remembered the secret word they remember the mystery word they remember the password amen hallelujah oh praise God and they entered in now listen and so is it today do you believe that praise God because I'm sure while I'm talking you are making applications in your own heart and seeing where he is seemed to be going with this that this is what many churches many groups many Believers have got themselves caught up with of how they look while they're running they're so concerned about their appearance and and their numbers and their this and this that that they're not paying attention or to the very word that that you know that like this boy they just try to memorize it they memorize the word they they practice mental elasticity or uh intelligence and uh their intelligence and their abilities in that way amen but God didn't call US Virgin reflection God didn't call us for yoga God call us for the to be formed in the shape of Jesus Christ by the word of God be confirmed amen praise the Lord so here it was he had forgotten the very thing that he wants to say that what let him get inside of that gate oh my you see so interested till he had forgotten the main thing amen and so is it today that uh so many churches and people are interested one in their buildings this is an age where there are so interested in church buildings I believe after a while if we are allowed to be here and I'm not saying me I'm talking all of us are allowed to be here for a long time you're going to see that the true bride is not going to have any more Church buildings she's not because actually just quickly mention this to you do you know Jesus never built a church in his life do you know none of the Apostles ever built a church es only started building from the nician council it's when the emperor Constantine began to give them large chunks of money to build these big ornate things to honor the the gods and the god of Heaven amen you see and and how they twisted and all that but the fact there's no buildings were actually built before then they started that and then the the Protestants now uh you know they want to be like the other nations like Israel when they went away from God they wanted to be like the other nations so they started building buildings because Constantine or wanted to consolidate his kingdom so he started giving the Protestants money also so that there can be a counterbalance to the other side and you know he was he's a politician so that's what he did and that's how I'm just showing you or saying to you that's how buildings come and now it's normalized to until if a preacher goes out and preach and he doesn't have a building nobody respects him nobody wants to go oh where where's you where are you keep in church or under a tree up up uh up the road there they're not gonna go there oh where you can uh oh um there's a cave I found on the Mountainside uh we're keeping Church there they're not going to go but that's where the apostles and the Saints and them kept Church amen uh under Big Trees in in little grottos and place little valleys under uh you know in caves praise God well the bottom of homes the basements wherever they could find their worship God and it's right in the book of Acts the Bible says and they Worship the Lord doing what going from the house to house that's all they had they didn't have buildings they I know you might think this and someone might throw this and say but they have the synagogues yeah but that was only for a while they didn't want them whenever they go back to the synagogue they started that when it just came out Pentecost started they kept going back to the cinema but that what they were preaching they didn't want them they didn't want them at all they didn't even want them first they didn't want them in the church and then later on and they want them in the city because these are the people that troubling they're using them they're bringing trouble all kinds of things and we're trying to teach the three-headed gods of you know Jameson this one and Venus and Jupiter and they're coming and preaching about one God and Jesus Christ and so on so there it is that he this young boy forgot the password right completely and now we find the churches have forgotten the main person and thing about what they were supposed to teach preach and to spread and now their attraction is their big buildings are there great um uh digital modernized buildings impresses the people and they're caught by that all together right see he said now they are interested in building great shrines they are interested in building great churches they want to have great big buildings and so forth amen they're interested in changing the style and keeping that church looking trim trim see oh what fine buildings and on the inside they want to have just plush pews for the people you see they want to push pills there and they want the hype uh fine organs I would say instrument uh musical instruments they want to have a lot of fine musical instruments amen but that's what's actually going on right now he says and when we look at the ministers they are just like that little boy that young man they go into all the theological training they take all the mental training and techniques uh you know they go into how to how to properly run the church they're taught those they're actually taught those um those uh not it's not isms those allergies Theology and they're taught all these things in that way right so here it is that's done yet he said there's study and study until they're so well trained they have to be called doctor they have to be called d l t h d l l d degrees you see they have forgotten what they are really running for they forgot the world they forgot the secret world Hallelujah here he says they really forgot the key word that they should always have amen but praise God like the real sons and dusts of God to get in that wonderful gate they have got to have God's word in their heart not in your mind not in your head not not just memorize it or seek it or even be sincere even understand it even to be able to pass it or to be able to break it down press it and bring it to a place where you have all kinds of notes about it that's good but it's got to be in your heart and you've got to believe it you can't have a revelation of it because it's a secret word to you alone amen and with that in your heart you're not having to think about it try to remember it you get to that gate and you run right in praise God hallelujah amen because that word is part of you amen yes sir they forgot the key word now see because they got too busy I find even with the True Believer even with myself the devil has gotten a world in such a state that he just tries to keep you so that your mind can't stay on the world so he's got too distracted with this with that you got to do and you gotta do these natural things to be able to get on with life but still we recognize their distractions to the True Believer from the word of God Amen yes sir and so we've been so busy with other things they are so busy with church plans making churches and not only the individual or the building a church but he says they are planning of building big denominations churches churches churches and having a big denominations under their name till there let me repeat he says they forgot the key word Hallelujah now if we go back to the pyramid here look we go back to the pyramid or go back to the way that some bridges actually the Chinese uh build their bridges in that way when you're building art you know that was even before the Romans uh the accrediting the Romans was the Chinese thousands of years before the Romans you would build a bridge with a half circle and in the center would be a keystone in the shape of a pyramid and that would lock the rest of the stones that go up against it right that they they just stay there because they're held together by that Keystone if you pull the Keystone out there knock it out with a hammer everything will start falling apart so he's not just saying key word here he he's referencing that we could catch on and remember that God's word this Revelation that we have is the Keystone to the entire Bible it's the Keystone to your entire life it's the Keystone to a church amen and to an age the glory of God see the I think they forgot completely the key word amen see and that is what has happened that we are in here today praise God I don't need to expand on that you can think of it how many are going to colleges theologies this not the other not for Natural Life they're thinking in terms of they're going to be more spiritual they're gonna be deeper in the word they can be more knowledge who's this bill uh you know I am I'm Senor so so or or I'm Reverend this this that there's such degrees what is this boy coming along here by the name of coffee what's golden he go to what what did he attend we're we're licenses where is your diplomas they don't want to hear you see and when they don't want to hear that they don't recognize the voice of the Holy Spirit they don't recognize what God is doing God always hide behind skin veils he hide behind Badger skins God hides himself always in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same way Glory God hallelujah amen praise God you see preparation is good but we must remember the message listen he's bringing the thought but he's changing it now amen but you know recently we had how many knows we had hurricanes in Florida everybody knows that you're aware of it right we got uh because we have satellites and we got TV we we got to know music you know news like that uh you know you're gonna have to wait for months maybe a year before you hear something that happened in England or or France or Africa but now the militant happens is on CNN and the minute this happens is on Sky News or BBC or something but you're going to know that something happened within the world and we have the Earth this uh hurricane coming towards Florida and everybody in that area was warned and they were told to get out evacuate Evacuate the area don't stay because this is one of the worst storms we've ever had uh from what we can see in over a hundred years we've never seen anything like this so run for your life get out of the area and move out your house isn't worth the things you know can be replaced but your life is at risk now so you've got to go but some of the people said no we're not leaving because my business is here my my Mansion is here by the seashore it's so lovely to watch the sun setting uh while I'm sitting having my uh dinner or coffee or whatever it's beautiful in the morning to see the sunrise over the ocean I'm not leaving you know there's a lot more hurricanes pass through and I never did really anything you know and my house is safer you know how people were talking they never bothered they didn't listen the newscasters get up there and it's not like one day an alarm went off as your hurricane is coming no maybe a week week and a half two weeks before they're telling them a hurricane is bad prepare get out of the area evacuate and so on like that and and we will help the government even offer to help them get them out of the area and it would not come out well he's telling him of this and now they were told of this great storm coming one man that was a poultry raise or chickens and he went to his neighbor and warned him that the storm was coming but the neighbor just ignored him and says you're talking nonsense have you ever heard that before oh my you tell them that you've got look judgment is coming you tell them like Noah had to tell them rain is coming you tell them fires coming from the heavens Brimstone hallelujah it's coming they're gonna say you're mad you're out of your mind but that's before I came to service they sat there noticing a tremendous increase in mental problems in the public I'm not talking about the mental institution now it's the same amongst the ordinary people it's become so ordinary that more people than we think have mental problems well we ignore a prophet has spoken just said the Lord it shall come to pass that the whole world will go insane and the only sanity really will be with the true children of God who have the mind of Christ they didn't take the world mind or that that they took on the mind of Christ and the mind of Christ is to think about the word of God when the Bible says seek on these things amen not on the things of Earth but keep your mind on the things of Heaven amen praise the Lord he says the neighbor told them you're talking nonsense and he just kept on with what he's doing and so you see when about this business never made any arrangements and you see but the other neighbor didn't bother him anymore he just continued to make his Arrangements and to be ready amen but oh the one who did not take the warning all his chickens were Blown Away With the Wind see Amen in other words it might be that not to their chickens man may have some form of business right he's saying his business all destroyed because of that hurricane well it's not a hurricane now it's worse than that this is Judgment coming it's a tribulation coming this is the harness of Revelation 19 coming this is the world consulate church is coming this is the power of the of that evil woman spiritual Jezebel coming amen yes sir and you're one that is coming and it's going to happen because a prophet has spoken and not only a prophet he spoke what is already in here that it's all coming and nothing can stop it that the word of God must come to pass see amen and so it tore first of all it tore up his chickens and blowed them away and kill them everyone and not only that his house that he loved so much was torn down amen yes sir and he himself was was sent or taken to the hospital amen and there he was on the brink of death all because he did not give heat to the warning God helped the people in this hour for them not giving heed to the warning and more and more we are beginning I I can sense it we're beginning to sound like something is wrong with us like um what's wrong with him what's wrong with her don't they know what age we're living in but we're not going by ages and times and this and that the word of God is unchanging and it's the same what it was and it's going to be it will remain the same amen see and so he failed to take heed to the warning then he repeats you see the message was already given but he would not take the message he failed to take heed to the message that was given to him and there's a lot of people today are not taking heed to the message of Malachi 4 5 Revelation 10 7. there's not taken into the message they think it's another Preacher Brother Branham just happened to be one that's a little more gifted like that and that's the way they're looking at it see but that's the same way it is today many of our people many of our churches we know what the Bible teaches they know what the Bible says and yet they don't heed the message but we heed it amen that Jesus said he that believeth in me though the words I do he shall do also amen amen because I go to my father and we are not interested in other things amen God praise God we are not listening to other things but we want to take heed to the secret word to the message of this hour given to us by this prophet and we have to run amen I believe it we have to run praise God Amen but o praise God hallelujah let us not be like the others who did not take heed to the message and run but didn't know what they were going to say when they got there right that's the way we ought to be always knowledgeable on the word of God by Revelation through God's blessed Holy Spirit I trust God will bless this simple thought to your hearts tonight and that you will be able to make the application and understand what God wants from us and what is in the world and what we have now God bless you all tonight and I trust that you have a great rest of the week amen have a great rest of the week as the musician comes and we come to the end of this service very soon we're going to come up to our leadership meeting before uh then we're going to have a membership meeting at those times and dates going to be given out and then we will we're just going to go through a great planning stage here and into next year and then we'll see what God has in store for us Ma I will be going to Israel around the ending of November back on the 8th of December where I think brother Bill and and his son Bill Jr will be going some other believers in the area uh Scarborough area will also be going and we're looking to the Lord to have a wonderful time in Israel real praise the Lord and if you don't go on this trip they are going again on the I think around the 8th of May next year to Israel and to Rome
