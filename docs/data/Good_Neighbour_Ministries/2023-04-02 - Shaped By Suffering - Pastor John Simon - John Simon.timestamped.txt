[5:05] when my enemies are turned back they
[5:08] shall fall and perish at thy presence
[5:10] for thou has maintained my right and my
[5:14] cause and and such as in the true
[5:17] judging right thou has rebuked the
[5:19] hidden thou has destroyed the wicked
[5:22] thou has put out their name forever and

[6:30] of them that hate me I suffer of them

[37:35] praise for you praise the Lord God bless
[37:38] you please be seated briefly we welcome
[37:41] our visitors praise God we welcome back
[37:46] our sister from Germany we're happy for
[37:49] every one of you that are in the house
[37:52] of God here this morning may the great
[37:56] Holy Spirit minister to all of us in a
[38:00] wonderful way
[38:01] because our our our duty now is that we
[38:06] are preparing
[38:08] um to leave
[38:09] uh the Eleazar first found character
[38:15] then he had to get her ready
[38:18] once he found the character that he was
[38:21] searching for
[38:22] his next Duty was to get her ready to
[38:26] meet Isaac
[38:28] that is where we are right now getting
[38:32] the bride the elect ready to meet our
[38:37] Isaac Jesus Christ in this day and in
[38:42] this hour
[38:43] and it's a marvelous thing to be
[38:46] involved in such a great Duty because
[38:49] not anyone can do that if we go to the
[38:53] book of uh Esther we find that before
[38:58] any uh of the women that were going to
[39:02] be chosen to be Queen after vashti were
[39:06] to come into the king's presence or to
[39:09] meet the king first they had to be
[39:12] prepared
[39:13] they had to be made ready
[39:16] and not anyone could do that job he
[39:20] chose the eunuchs
[39:22] today he chooses spiritual eunuchs
[39:25] in other words men that will not plant
[39:28] their own seed
[39:30] you know they're speaking but they don't
[39:32] have any word of Their Own
[39:34] they don't have nothing that they can
[39:36] give to you of themselves
[39:39] only the great Holy Spirit can grant to
[39:42] you the opening of your eyes of your
[39:45] heart of your mind only by Revelation
[39:49] can he do that not we of ourselves but
[39:53] him
[39:54] now I once as a minister ministered
[39:58] under that impression that we have to
[40:02] know so much about the word and know so
[40:04] much about the Bible and history and
[40:08] hermeneutics and apologetics and this
[40:10] and that and the other you have to know
[40:12] all of that mixed with a little greek
[40:14] and some Hebrew and whatnot and be able
[40:17] to really put that into a great stupa to
[40:21] Mel you you know and be able to feed
[40:24] that out and it's very impressive but
[40:26] when you do that it's pointing back to
[40:28] you
[40:30] it binding back to your years of
[40:32] schooling pointing back to your
[40:34] knowledge but the real sermons of God
[40:38] want to take the word and point away
[40:41] from themselves and let your eyes see
[40:45] Jesus only
[40:47] amen I mean naturally you're going to
[40:51] see the person but your thoughts your
[40:55] your whole being must be caught up with
[40:58] being able to come to church come to
[41:02] this assembly every Sunday Wednesday or
[41:05] whenever you are here you're expecting
[41:08] not to see a miracle but to see a person
[41:11] to see the manifestation of Jesus Christ
[41:16] by the opening of the word of God
[41:20] I just grant you one more thing you see
[41:23] when Jesus came on the earth he was
[41:27] God's original seed
[41:30] and then after him when it multiplied
[41:34] itself after uh uh crucifixion
[41:37] Resurrection Ascension Pentecost
[41:42] multiplied himself
[41:44] there and that now the seven Church
[41:48] edges began the great cycle went through
[41:51] with the grain until it came back to a
[41:55] sprout back up until now it's bearing
[41:59] what what's got to go back to back to
[42:02] the original seed again
[42:05] and the Original Seed was not Pentecost
[42:09] The Original Seed was not the apostles
[42:12] as great as they were the original seed
[42:16] was Jesus Christ the word
[42:21] so when the people see the ministry
[42:23] changes from like the one brother
[42:26] Branham had
[42:28] may I say this Malachi 4 5 has already
[42:31] been fulfilled
[42:33] we are not here to copycat we are not
[42:37] here to simulate but the fact is that
[42:42] scripture has been fulfilled
[42:45] and is being fulfilled right the ending
[42:49] of it is is being fulfilled not by him
[42:52] but by the Holy Spirit carrying that out
[42:55] what what I am saying we are not to look
[42:59] back because you see all these Miracle
[43:01] signs wonders and things like that look
[43:05] to where we are now we are in the grain
[43:09] we are not in the shock we are not in
[43:12] the leaf we are not in the Sprout we are
[43:15] back to the grain again
[43:17] when the son of man would be revealed
[43:21] again
[43:22] the who's the son of man Jesus Christ
[43:25] that's when he was in the flesh name
[43:28] Jesus he was called Jesus Christ of
[43:32] course we know that was Jehovah
[43:35] in a body that he himself created
[43:40] and then he called that body the son
[43:44] because God the father's Spirit lived in
[43:48] the visible Sun
[43:51] God in Christ Christ now come back to be
[43:55] in the church
[43:56] and the great Rapture in the kingdom of
[43:59] God come into His fullness praise the
[44:02] Lord oh my well it's wonderful I tell
[44:07] you when you can see the word of God as
[44:11] plain as they making and shaping itself
[44:14] to the glory of God you know
[44:16] um we we want to let you know that ahead
[44:20] of us of course we have Easter praise
[44:24] God there is no command there for you
[44:26] not to eat fish during this week
[44:29] uh uh praise the Lord uh yeah uh it
[44:34] sounds funny but that's true those are
[44:36] Traditions it's not in the Bible
[44:39] praise God I know they'll quote
[44:41] scriptures like Jesus told Peter them
[44:44] and prepared fish for them on the shore
[44:46] and all of that during this time but
[44:49] that's not what we are here for we are
[44:52] here for the bread of life
[44:55] so
[44:56] um we we may even use the terms lent we
[45:00] may even use the term Easter which is
[45:03] not in the scripture either right that
[45:06] is named after the god estar right
[45:09] astarte uh that's like that but when we
[45:14] use it now of course we know what we're
[45:16] talking about
[45:18] so it's not we're going to be legalistic
[45:20] to say oh we're not going to say Easter
[45:22] anymore we gotta find another name no
[45:25] just go ahead and live that's what we're
[45:28] here for once you know the truth
[45:30] everything else has to line up with the
[45:33] word of God it's it's that simple praise
[45:36] the Lord oh lest I keep just chatting
[45:40] with you like that let's go to the word
[45:42] is that right praise the Lord our
[45:45] scripture
[45:47] is found in the Book of Job
[45:55] chapter 2
[46:02] and then we'll turn quickly to Job
[46:05] chapter 13.
[46:08] and uh
[46:11] if you'd like to read with me before a
[46:15] brief prayer and then we'll go and break
[46:18] the bread of life praise the Lord
[46:22] the Lord said unto Satan
[46:27] behold he is in thine hand save his life
[46:34] so when Satan that's just to tell you
[46:39] that I see the gene of God can go
[46:42] through all kinds of Trials but Satan
[46:44] has no right to take their life amen
[46:47] amen you strain you strain you strange
[46:50] you'll pull you he'll stretch you
[46:52] pressure test you and everything else
[46:55] right and just before your bubble birth
[46:58] he steps in because he knows as the
[47:02] scripture says how much we can bear
[47:04] okay so when Satan so went Satan fought
[47:10] from the presence of God and smote job
[47:14] with sores from the soul of his foot
[47:18] onto his crown
[47:20] and he took him a pot shirt
[47:24] to scrape himself with all
[47:27] and he sat down among the ashes
[47:30] then set his wife unto him thus thou
[47:34] retain thine Integrity Curse God and I
[47:39] job 2 10 but he said unto her thou speak
[47:43] it as one of the foolish women speak it
[47:46] what shall we receive good at the hand
[47:49] of God and shall we not receive evil
[47:54] in all this
[47:56] job did not sin with his lips
[48:01] job 13 15. though he slay me yet will I
[48:08] trust him
[48:09] but I will maintain my own ways before
[48:12] him praise the Lord may God bless the
[48:16] word that he has given to us and may he
[48:19] give us wisdom and understanding by the
[48:22] great Holy Spirit father we come this
[48:25] morning together as a people as a family
[48:29] of God gathered here
[48:32] with you your Invisible Presence that's
[48:37] here to confirm your word we welcome you
[48:40] and we feel privileged that we are
[48:44] invited to enter into your presence your
[48:48] August presence
[48:51] your Royal presence
[48:54] of our great and invisible King
[48:58] father as we enter the gates of this
[49:02] great kingdom of God May the Holy Spirit
[49:07] take the word of God and may the word of
[49:11] God go through our hearts go through our
[49:14] lines go through our souls father and
[49:18] bring our hearts to an understanding and
[49:21] to the light of the word for this day
[49:24] for we ask it in the name of our Lord
[49:27] Jesus Christ amen God bless you please
[49:31] be seated when you are
[49:34] I want a quote from Brother Branham out
[49:38] of an old message that he preached many
[49:41] years ago actually 1957
[49:45] and the message is called Divine love
[49:50] my life has been a mysterious one
[49:53] that is true
[49:56] people don't understand it
[49:58] see but it's been
[50:02] because I just loved him
[50:05] when God seen fit to take my wife
[50:11] baby and everything I had
[50:14] they never thought of my my little baby
[50:18] my wife was a corpse
[50:21] my baby started dying
[50:24] I ran down to the hospital
[50:27] fell down before God I said God don't
[50:32] take my little darling don't do it Lord
[50:36] I know he was going to take her then
[50:39] Satan spoke to me he said Yonder in the
[50:43] mark lays your wife 23 years old
[50:48] here's your nine-month-old baby
[50:52] and he's taken that and you mean you'll
[50:56] serve him
[50:58] then I looked down and said though he
[51:01] slay me yet
[51:04] I'll serve him
[51:06] for something happened down in my bosom
[51:10] that made a love for him that the Bible
[51:13] said there's nothing present
[51:16] neither Triumph or nothing
[51:20] can separate us from the love of God
[51:24] that is in Christ
[51:26] if he would send me to torment at the
[51:30] day of judgment he is still just
[51:34] and if I have the mind that I have now
[51:38] while I am in hell I'll still love him
[51:45] why it's a part of me amen that's what
[51:50] it is that's what it is to you friend
[51:53] that loves the Lord that's what I want
[51:57] him to be a part of you love amen praise
[52:03] the name of the Lord God bless every one
[52:06] of you here today I'd like to take first
[52:09] subject here shaped by suffering
[52:14] shaped by suffering trials trouble
[52:18] tribulation trespasses
[52:20] shaped by God using that to shape us and
[52:24] form us and to make us what we want to
[52:28] be what he wants us to be praise the
[52:31] name of the Lord amen now Revelation
[52:35] chapter 1.
[52:40] now here we see Jesus is walking up and
[52:45] down amidst the candlesticks right he's
[52:49] walking up and down among the great
[52:51] candlesticks and you know the seven
[52:54] candlesticks were made of solid gold
[52:57] solid gold and a shape like that
[53:01] and I want to bring that to your
[53:04] attention it was made of pure gold
[53:09] and he was walking up and down among
[53:12] those candlesticks many times we want to
[53:16] think in our hearts does Jesus care
[53:19] he is walking up and down the golden
[53:23] candlesticks that are right there before
[53:25] him
[53:26] we understand that that is how our God
[53:30] cares for us
[53:32] the prophet preached The Marvelous
[53:34] message he cares do you care
[53:37] amen so we must understand that so
[53:42] character in the Bible
[53:45] is likened to pure gold
[53:48] and the reason why there's a scarcity of
[53:51] character especially in this day in
[53:53] which we live
[53:55] therefore it's valuable if someone has
[53:59] pure Godly Christian character
[54:03] now you may say there are men in the
[54:06] world that have character but that is a
[54:09] different kind of character that's
[54:10] produced by the flesh that's produced by
[54:13] human nature when we speak of character
[54:16] we talking about the character of Christ
[54:20] now Christ in you that character is what
[54:24] God is looking for
[54:26] he's looking for his Gene
[54:29] he's looking for his attribute in you
[54:32] because you of yourself cannot produce
[54:36] these Seven Virtues
[54:39] impossible
[54:41] you cannot and this is just a part of
[54:44] his character that he revealed for us no
[54:46] get to know him because God is so wide
[54:49] the heavens of Heavens can't contain him
[54:51] and the different facets of his
[54:54] personality as the great Diamond
[54:56] described by the prophet tells us we
[54:59] know that this is just a portion of him
[55:02] but the fact is true genuine character
[55:07] can only come by the gene of God that
[55:13] was or is already in you
[55:17] I'm preaching so you get to know more of
[55:19] yourself of who you really are I want
[55:22] you to realize what God is doing in our
[55:25] lives
[55:26] that we are here with God's divine plan
[55:29] and we are here for a purpose
[55:32] we are not here to wonder about we are
[55:35] not here to drift about we are what we
[55:39] are here following God's word a god with
[55:43] a plan
[55:44] God is not a god of Chaos
[55:47] or confusion
[55:50] but he is not a god of systems
[55:52] he has his own
[55:54] the world has his systems
[55:57] and it's working perfectly
[56:00] they may look at the field and say oh
[56:02] that's terrible I gotta get all these
[56:05] weeds out I'll move it and I'll make a
[56:07] beautiful lawn that's man-made
[56:10] to your eyes this looks beautiful but
[56:13] when God looks on a field with the
[56:15] flowers nodding their heads the perfume
[56:18] spilling on a breeze and and the
[56:20] beauties of the different colors of
[56:22] those flowers out there to him that's
[56:26] Beauty
[56:27] Amen to any real artist that's Beauty
[56:31] not a cultured lawn with the man plants
[56:35] this hair takes something God put on the
[56:37] mountain bring it down and put it in the
[56:39] valley and and then calls that beauty
[56:41] that's just Satan in the spirit of
[56:43] rebellion putting it on men causing them
[56:46] to do that amen now that don't say
[56:48] brother Simon told you not to keep your
[56:50] lawn anymore all right yeah I'm just in
[56:53] passing before you take me and go out
[56:57] there and take my word saying that
[56:59] you're supposed to leave it natural and
[57:01] let it go that's just as much as if I
[57:04] should tell the sisters don't fix your
[57:06] hair
[57:07] right leave it natural right just leave
[57:11] it however it is but that's not what I'm
[57:13] talking about
[57:15] now so we understand of course
[57:19] that um character was liking to gold and
[57:23] the golden candlesticks as you know uh
[57:27] were really made by workers whom God had
[57:31] told uh you know told Moses told Solomon
[57:36] and them
[57:37] I am going to anoint men with the
[57:40] ability to shape gold
[57:43] and I'm gonna make them into Craftsmen
[57:46] that can handle gold let them go and
[57:50] make these candlesticks and any other
[57:52] golden
[57:54] um vessels that is needed for the
[57:56] Tabernacle now I won't stop on that but
[57:58] that's typing the various Ministries
[58:00] fivefold Ministries as God has in this
[58:03] church that differ in shape and form in
[58:06] expression in every way possible now we
[58:09] see that but in actual fact he was using
[58:12] a type of himself
[58:14] because God himself is a greatest person
[58:18] to shape your character
[58:20] he's the greatest worker in gold
[58:23] and he can shape and make anything
[58:26] better than anybody else
[58:29] right so Jehovah was just uh showing
[58:33] himself symbolizing that he is the one
[58:37] that truly shapes and forms character
[58:42] wherever it really is but you know
[58:45] character light gold must go through
[58:49] Refinery before you can do anything with
[58:52] it
[58:53] other than that it's just a piece of
[58:55] rock or metal in your hand but it has to
[58:58] pass through refinery
[59:00] and that is where Satan gets a lot of
[59:04] believers
[59:05] they feel they can become Christians and
[59:10] somehow they got a prize without running
[59:14] the race
[59:15] they got a testimony without having
[59:18] tests
[59:20] uh that believe that they come to
[59:23] Christians to Christ and it's all joy
[59:26] and peace and happiness but not castings
[59:30] and trials but God using the type of job
[59:36] using the figures of what I'm speaking
[59:39] of is letting us know every son every
[59:43] daughter every child must be chastened
[59:47] everyone has got to surrender themselves
[59:51] so that they can be shaped and formed by
[59:55] the word
[59:56] is this making sense to you
[1:00:01] praise the Lord
[1:00:04] so God has to First
[1:00:09] Prospect
[1:00:11] uh ministers again
[1:00:13] find the gold
[1:00:15] wherever it's hidden in the dirt
[1:00:18] right not that ground this ground
[1:00:21] there are millions out there the
[1:00:24] ministers need to take the word use it
[1:00:27] as a filter and find those elect that
[1:00:31] are hidden in human flesh and uh hidden
[1:00:34] in the dirt and and then that's the job
[1:00:38] isn't done you're a Christian now you're
[1:00:39] going to heaven you're going into
[1:00:41] Rapture you believe the message you
[1:00:43] believe the prophet you're going in the
[1:00:44] Rapture no you now have you've just come
[1:00:47] out of all the dirt all the world all
[1:00:50] the flesh all the devil all the
[1:00:53] influences all the environment that was
[1:00:55] around you and now you have got to be
[1:00:59] refined by the fires of God and our God
[1:01:02] is a consuming fire
[1:01:05] future home of the Heavenly bride amen
[1:01:08] Earthly bright uh the Earthly bright and
[1:01:11] Heavenly bridegroom he says look the
[1:01:14] fires of God is coming he says to burn
[1:01:18] up not the Earth but it's also it's a
[1:01:21] spiritual fire it will burn up even
[1:01:23] devils in the atmosphere amen it'll burn
[1:01:27] up germs Devils everything else and so
[1:01:31] when the Holy Spirit in the form of the
[1:01:35] word set on fire or revealed to you
[1:01:38] comes to your mind comes to your heart
[1:01:41] it begins to transform you
[1:01:45] hit me against the burn up your old
[1:01:47] ideas
[1:01:49] it begins to burn up the germs the tries
[1:01:52] to Lodge in your mind and in your heart
[1:01:55] and begins to purify you and begins to
[1:01:59] refine you to bring you in to the
[1:02:02] perfect character of Jesus Christ
[1:02:06] not you're going out and trying to work
[1:02:09] to bring that character
[1:02:12] because if you're born a human you don't
[1:02:16] have to work to be a human
[1:02:18] you automatically as you mature you walk
[1:02:23] into that role of being a human being
[1:02:26] you start acting like one even when you
[1:02:29] don't think you're acting like one
[1:02:30] you're still acting like one because
[1:02:32] that's who you are so so God brought us
[1:02:37] here
[1:02:38] and this is why he has a bride
[1:02:41] there are Saints everywhere I don't want
[1:02:44] to go into the book of life but you know
[1:02:45] the book of life has classes in it where
[1:02:48] where you have the bright class of sense
[1:02:50] which is the highest form because
[1:02:52] they're going to sit behind it beside
[1:02:54] him in the throne Prophet said and then
[1:02:57] there are going to be others in The Book
[1:02:58] of Life that's going to be saved too not
[1:03:01] in the bright but Faith too but they
[1:03:04] will be like servants
[1:03:06] you have some going to be guards you got
[1:03:09] the 144 000 and have their other duties
[1:03:12] and so on so so we understand now don't
[1:03:16] get this idea that oh we're in the
[1:03:18] bright we're the only one going to be
[1:03:20] saved no you see light your thoughts so
[1:03:23] you know I'm the only one God says no I
[1:03:25] got seven thousand to hit not you don't
[1:03:28] know about that you don't worry about
[1:03:29] that worry about your group that has to
[1:03:31] get in there now I'm gonna deal with the
[1:03:33] others right so understand that clearly
[1:03:37] praise the Lord so now we see God has
[1:03:41] got to now refine us
[1:03:44] he's got to take us and refine us like
[1:03:47] that for his glory now I was reading
[1:03:50] where
[1:03:51] Michelangelo was seen every day as he
[1:03:54] was passing by he would stop
[1:03:56] by a big rock that was by the side of
[1:04:00] the road and keep looking at it and
[1:04:03] looking at them people wondered why
[1:04:05] every time he passed by he would look at
[1:04:09] this rock keep looking at the Rock and
[1:04:11] they don't know what was he thinking is
[1:04:13] he going mad is he crazy those every
[1:04:17] Sunday they're coming to look in the
[1:04:19] word my every Sunday Bible
[1:04:24] Prophet message work every Sunday
[1:04:27] they're staring at that what are they
[1:04:29] coming here for what is Michelangelo
[1:04:32] looking at that rock
[1:04:34] and somebody had the courage one day to
[1:04:37] ask him why are you looking at the Rock
[1:04:39] every day like that and he answered them
[1:04:42] and says because when I look I see an
[1:04:45] angel
[1:04:46] in that rock
[1:04:48] when God looks at you no matter how
[1:04:51] rough your exterior might seem no matter
[1:04:55] what or what you went through no matter
[1:04:58] not the rough situations you might have
[1:05:01] endured God sees an angel in that rock
[1:05:07] in other words he is seeing his Gene he
[1:05:11] is seeing his elect seed in that rock
[1:05:15] and now he's going to refine that he's
[1:05:17] gonna work with it to bring out what is
[1:05:21] in it the beauty in it the grace in it
[1:05:24] the power of God in it pays good
[1:05:27] Hallelujah God will work with it to
[1:05:30] bring that out that he might glorify his
[1:05:33] name amen do you believe that
[1:05:35] [Applause]
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:37] oh praise God praise God praise God that
[1:05:41] is why we are here hallelujah we love to
[1:05:44] sing them songs but sing with your
[1:05:46] understanding to be like Jesus
[1:05:50] to be like Jesus
[1:05:54] on Earth I long to be like him
[1:06:00] all True Lies Journey
[1:06:04] from Earth to Glory
[1:06:09] I only ask
[1:06:13] to be
[1:06:15] like him
[1:06:18] so you see it's not taken virtue and
[1:06:22] adding one on top of the other until you
[1:06:25] come to the top of the pyramid and then
[1:06:28] you get born again no it's not like that
[1:06:32] that adding Peter was talking about is
[1:06:35] like a sheep that as they eat the word
[1:06:39] as they eat what they're supposed to eat
[1:06:41] amen they grow into a mature sheep
[1:06:46] and then they automatically start to
[1:06:48] bring forth the wall
[1:06:49] they don't have to work at bringing it
[1:06:52] Forward oh I don't have this virtue I
[1:06:54] don't have that I do not no no no no no
[1:06:56] no you have him in you
[1:07:00] in baby form in seed form and now the
[1:07:04] seed begins to grow as the moisture of
[1:07:07] the Waters of the word of God from the
[1:07:10] River of Life sweeps over your soul it
[1:07:13] begins to cause that seed to germinate
[1:07:16] and as the gene of God begins to
[1:07:19] germinate it it reproduces as a seed
[1:07:22] after its kind
[1:07:25] its kind as the Christ's kind it's a
[1:07:28] bright kind it's God's child's kind it
[1:07:31] can't help it it's got to become seen
[1:07:34] back to sin seed after its kind
[1:07:37] hallelujah praise God and God can only
[1:07:40] have fellowship with his own children
[1:07:44] is that right
[1:07:46] do you think that a man can have real
[1:07:48] fellowship with a parrot
[1:07:50] just quoting quotes
[1:07:52] you think you're going to have
[1:07:54] fellowship with a monkey that just tries
[1:07:56] to copy the prophet where the buckles
[1:07:59] and the blue jeans and stand and move
[1:08:01] like him and rather talk like him no you
[1:08:04] don't have fellowship with or a monkey
[1:08:06] that is caught up with dazzling stuff
[1:08:08] and shiny things you know catching your
[1:08:11] eyes and no no no it's not like that you
[1:08:14] see you get a goat bring sport goat she
[1:08:17] brings forth sheep and God brings forth
[1:08:20] what
[1:08:21] Jesus said it he said you are Gods Not
[1:08:25] Capital God of course but common little
[1:08:28] ones amen and those were the little ones
[1:08:32] that were in him the logos the great one
[1:08:34] before the foundation of the world and
[1:08:37] they were in him
[1:08:39] because you can't be Eternal now
[1:08:43] if you're really eternal
[1:08:45] you there was never a time when you were
[1:08:49] not
[1:08:50] there will never be a time when you will
[1:08:52] not be
[1:08:54] for Eternal means without the beginning
[1:08:56] and without an ending and we know that
[1:09:00] God is the only
[1:09:02] eternal
[1:09:03] then if God is the only Eternal you are
[1:09:06] in him before the foundations of the
[1:09:09] world
[1:09:10] I repeat you are not creatures of time
[1:09:14] amen we are now caught in the TR the
[1:09:18] Trap the prison of time because of these
[1:09:21] bodies we were in we come down from the
[1:09:24] presence of God like Daniel said I saw
[1:09:27] trolls and crumbs cast down upon the
[1:09:30] Earth hallelujah praise God and here we
[1:09:33] find ourselves trapped in human bodies
[1:09:36] and God now because Satan now through
[1:09:39] multiplication caused the whole world to
[1:09:42] be filled with billions of people and
[1:09:44] the the goodness mixed in with the false
[1:09:47] and the true and everything else and so
[1:09:49] Jesus had to come and save the Lost
[1:09:53] lost somebody had you so you so you
[1:09:58] that's how you got lost right you you
[1:10:01] couldn't be lost if if no one owned you
[1:10:04] or you want it like that he came because
[1:10:07] you are in him
[1:10:09] I come for the lost sheep
[1:10:12] they were in him so he comes for you for
[1:10:16] me praise God a part of him is in you
[1:10:21] that's why Prophet prayed son spoken
[1:10:23] word The Original Seed so we are Eternal
[1:10:27] beings
[1:10:28] trapped in a body of time
[1:10:31] it's not right
[1:10:33] we are uh we are souls imprisoned now
[1:10:38] but by the opening of the word just what
[1:10:42] happened in Jerusalem when he rose from
[1:10:45] the dead at the rising of the Sun the
[1:10:48] word also Rose and it broke the bars
[1:10:51] broke the shackles and command Satan who
[1:10:55] had you imprisoned in denominationalism
[1:10:58] imprisoned by your own thoughts in your
[1:11:00] flesh with all kinds of thinking and
[1:11:02] everything else he took you out and made
[1:11:05] you walk around and we are still walking
[1:11:07] around and they're going to see us and
[1:11:10] after this we'll Ascend with him we'll
[1:11:12] go into the presence of the Living God
[1:11:15] praise the name of the Lord amen praise
[1:11:18] God hallelujah so God is seeing his own
[1:11:21] Gene inside of the rock
[1:11:27] this person is rough that don't mean
[1:11:29] nothing to God he's looking beyond all
[1:11:32] of that is that right
[1:11:34] oh praise God now let's go to the church
[1:11:38] age book and in the church age book
[1:11:42] there
[1:11:43] uh and I don't have the actual page
[1:11:46] number or whatever written here but I'm
[1:11:48] quoting him
[1:11:50] now the Lord God Almighty says
[1:11:54] I know
[1:11:57] there he is walking in the midst of the
[1:11:59] people
[1:12:00] there he is the chief Shepherd of the
[1:12:04] flock
[1:12:05] and he says I know
[1:12:07] praise God my friends no matter what you
[1:12:11] are going through God knows all about it
[1:12:15] there is nothing secret to God that we
[1:12:18] can hide from him
[1:12:19] and you can say he doesn't know he said
[1:12:22] I know amen and he's walking up and down
[1:12:25] observing watching seeing what is going
[1:12:28] on because he's the chief Shepherd but
[1:12:31] does he hold back the persecution
[1:12:35] does he stem the tribulation
[1:12:39] does he
[1:12:41] not simply say I know your tribulation
[1:12:48] and I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:12:51] no matter what you have gone through
[1:12:54] no matter what you may be going through
[1:12:57] in the name of Jesus Christ God is
[1:13:01] saying from his word I know your
[1:13:04] tribulation
[1:13:06] right now at the present time not in the
[1:13:09] Bible but right now God says I know your
[1:13:14] tribulation that you are going through
[1:13:17] and I am not unmindful of your
[1:13:21] sufferings what a stumbling block that
[1:13:25] is to so many people amen oh because
[1:13:29] right the way the Devil comes that God
[1:13:31] is allowing us God is doing that you got
[1:13:33] to do that well it's not God doing it
[1:13:35] it's Satan doing it as you could see
[1:13:38] Satan is doing it but God had to leave
[1:13:40] him and say look I got to test this one
[1:13:42] but you you do you do that let me see
[1:13:45] how they're going to react action
[1:13:46] brother Brandon preach for a reaction
[1:13:49] right so now we see God is now allowing
[1:13:53] that by his word what does stumbling
[1:13:56] block this is to so many people like
[1:14:00] Israel amen like the Jews in the
[1:14:03] Holocaust oh my this is why what the uh
[1:14:07] blinded them they couldn't understand
[1:14:10] how how can Jehovah love us and leave us
[1:14:15] to suffer like this to burn us in in
[1:14:19] these ovens melt them our bodies to make
[1:14:22] soap uh to for the soldiers to use and
[1:14:27] burn them chop them up grind them every
[1:14:32] every possible uh thing you can think
[1:14:35] about they were doing to those uh their
[1:14:39] people like that and it became and is a
[1:14:44] great stumbling block and they wondered
[1:14:47] if God really loves them amen hallelujah
[1:14:52] and though you sometimes the devil will
[1:14:55] come to any and every one of us and say
[1:14:57] does Jesus care
[1:14:59] does he really love you if he loved you
[1:15:02] how could he allow this how could you
[1:15:05] let that happen
[1:15:06] but you've got to come to a place like
[1:15:09] Abraham came to when he says shall not
[1:15:13] the judge of the earth do right
[1:15:17] can God do anything wrong
[1:15:19] and if you allow this what am I all I
[1:15:22] got to do is put my faith my trust in
[1:15:24] him no matter how it looks no matter how
[1:15:27] I feel I put my trust in him
[1:15:30] no wonder job said though he is slam me
[1:15:34] yet will I trust him
[1:15:37] though he sent me to Hell Brother Brad
[1:15:39] himself I'm still gonna love him
[1:15:42] will you but the prophet said he took my
[1:15:46] wife he took my baby everything else oh
[1:15:49] my but though he slammed me yet will I
[1:15:52] trust him and though he put me in Hell
[1:15:55] yet will I trust him
[1:15:57] oh my you can feel like if you in hell
[1:16:00] on Earth
[1:16:02] while you were here amen praise God my
[1:16:07] goodness Hallelujah we find out here
[1:16:11] that we live in an age where this
[1:16:14] message has become a burden to a lot of
[1:16:17] people
[1:16:18] and I'm taking the thought from the fact
[1:16:21] of Malachi 1 3 because brother Branham
[1:16:23] mentions it here and when Malachi said
[1:16:26] the burden of the word of the Lord
[1:16:30] the word of the Lord has and is becoming
[1:16:34] a burden and that's because of lack of
[1:16:37] Revelation
[1:16:38] if the preachers don't have a revelation
[1:16:43] and can't convey to the people the life
[1:16:47] that's behind the veil of this word then
[1:16:51] it becomes boring it becomes something
[1:16:53] of human effort it's not something of
[1:16:57] the spirit of the Living God hallelujah
[1:16:59] I'm not talking about what they call the
[1:17:01] spirit which is music beat up music can
[1:17:04] get you to the state where you feel
[1:17:06] you're in the spirit by emotion and
[1:17:07] everything else I'm talking about the
[1:17:10] word itself when it lights up that puts
[1:17:13] you
[1:17:14] into the real joy that puts you into the
[1:17:18] real emotions of the spirit of God not
[1:17:21] of us working ourselves up into the
[1:17:24] music and all of that that's not what it
[1:17:26] is at all but back to the word here
[1:17:28] praise the Lord so we find out
[1:17:32] the burden of the word of the Lord
[1:17:35] because the word of God has become a
[1:17:38] burden to Israel why is all these
[1:17:40] preachers uh prophets come in and
[1:17:42] rebuking us why are they saying this or
[1:17:46] saying that or saying the other amen
[1:17:48] praise God uh uh why why why do pray I
[1:17:52] have to do this uh I have to do that to
[1:17:56] believe the word I've got to do this
[1:17:58] I've got to do that so the word becomes
[1:18:00] a burden to the people of burden in the
[1:18:03] hearts of the real Believers amen so
[1:18:08] they end up fussing and fighting with
[1:18:11] the very word of God and yet claiming to
[1:18:15] be bride
[1:18:17] amen yes sir but God wants a bride with
[1:18:21] cancer
[1:18:22] he wants one with his seed in him
[1:18:27] who loves him and loves the unfolding
[1:18:31] revelation of the word of God you know
[1:18:34] the prophet said the seals don't just
[1:18:36] open like that like a Roman Candlestick
[1:18:38] it opens it opens it and keeps going
[1:18:41] Higher and Higher and Higher by the Holy
[1:18:44] Spirit not man's study not not all the
[1:18:48] 24 hours of study and I spent all night
[1:18:52] with the Midnight Oil and all that
[1:18:54] brother sister uh you know if I might
[1:18:57] call people Pharisee the Pharisees you
[1:19:00] are the Jews
[1:19:01] I receive this Not By Any Man calling me
[1:19:05] to the ministry
[1:19:06] I was sleeping as a child of 12 years
[1:19:10] old and a man appeared to me
[1:19:13] and at 14 not being a member of any
[1:19:16] church
[1:19:18] felt the pulsation to preach preach the
[1:19:21] word and a Revival broke out this is a
[1:19:24] Pentecostal church with over 2 500
[1:19:26] members still sitting there in Guyana
[1:19:29] South America where I'm from still there
[1:19:32] it's still there praise God no I just
[1:19:35] I'm saying that that you might
[1:19:37] understand I'm not just talking words
[1:19:41] but we were praying as young men five
[1:19:45] six hours a day we're studying the Bible
[1:19:49] fasting 10 days 20 days 21 days 40 days
[1:19:54] fast and I'm real fast not eating and
[1:19:57] fasting but with water only and this
[1:20:00] type of thing like that and God sent us
[1:20:03] a prophet God sin of prophet God send a
[1:20:06] prophet okay then hear about the prophet
[1:20:09] and the word came and things changed and
[1:20:13] the Holy Spirit began to move in a
[1:20:15] different way altogether because back
[1:20:18] then being under a miracle type of
[1:20:21] ministry where demons were being cast
[1:20:23] out the sick were being healed and souls
[1:20:26] were being saved stuff of that nature
[1:20:28] amen praise God and then the message
[1:20:31] came and all of a sudden
[1:20:33] I wasn't seeing all those signs Once In
[1:20:36] Miracles like before
[1:20:38] but I started to get a rich
[1:20:40] understanding of what God was doing in
[1:20:44] this day and in this hour and it sounds
[1:20:47] so strange to some of the others that
[1:20:51] they something is wrong with you what
[1:20:54] what are you talking about you see they
[1:20:56] couldn't see it as yet some are just
[1:20:58] getting a glimmer of it and a glimpse
[1:21:01] others don't want to do nothing with it
[1:21:03] but let me tell you something friends
[1:21:05] this is the old time religion
[1:21:09] and summing up wanted but I want to hold
[1:21:12] to God's unchanging hands
[1:21:15] God wants us to surrender ourselves to
[1:21:18] him that we can be molded by him in his
[1:21:22] refinery
[1:21:24] formed and shaped as a bride ready for
[1:21:28] her husband
[1:21:30] I'm just throw a few thoughts here
[1:21:31] remember the boys in the fiery furnace
[1:21:35] yes you understand what that type is now
[1:21:39] God loving them to be in the fiery
[1:21:41] furnace
[1:21:42] the devil throwing them in a fiery
[1:21:44] furnace but God allowing it
[1:21:48] that's what Daniel was saying you think
[1:21:50] if oh God wants us to go in the furnace
[1:21:52] we will go and if we don't he don't want
[1:21:54] us to go we ain't gonna go you can't do
[1:21:56] anything about it it's whatever he wants
[1:21:58] that's what's gonna happen
[1:22:00] amen and then if we want us to go in the
[1:22:04] furnace then I don't have to worry he
[1:22:07] knows what he is doing
[1:22:08] and when the king look he saw there was
[1:22:11] a fourth man in the fire
[1:22:14] he was there there with them all the
[1:22:18] time I want you to know he is there with
[1:22:20] you all the time no matter what you're
[1:22:24] going through he's all the time he is
[1:22:26] with you
[1:22:28] oh God in the shadows watching over his
[1:22:32] own what love that God has given to us
[1:22:36] brother Billy Paul told me he says you
[1:22:38] know
[1:22:39] um Danny told me uh you know I wanted to
[1:22:42] see the angel and he said to me he says
[1:22:45] the angel has already told me you stay
[1:22:48] back over there and then don't just take
[1:22:51] your hands off your eyes like that do it
[1:22:53] slowly he says and when I did that
[1:22:56] slowly there was this man 250 pounds
[1:23:00] ants folded white garments just looking
[1:23:04] at me from behind just standing near the
[1:23:08] drips of the hotel window and just
[1:23:12] looking at me I looked at him he looked
[1:23:15] at me then all of a sudden he formed
[1:23:18] into a ball of fire that begins to world
[1:23:22] and then it Whirled and went right up
[1:23:24] through the window and up into the
[1:23:26] heavens amen and I want to say just like
[1:23:29] that you may be in a room all by
[1:23:32] yourself but God is standing somewhere
[1:23:36] in the shadows
[1:23:38] watching over his own
[1:23:41] watching over his own amen praise God
[1:23:45] hallelujah I'm so glad one like unto the
[1:23:50] son of man is here with us
[1:23:53] and but whatever furnace you're going
[1:23:55] through whatever
[1:23:56] uh whatever Foundry you are in a man a
[1:24:02] one like unto the son of man and it had
[1:24:05] to say that way at that time because he
[1:24:08] was still in a theophany state
[1:24:10] condescending down to the flesh that we
[1:24:13] know as Jesus Christ right this
[1:24:16] condescension was taking place from the
[1:24:18] Garden of Eden to Melchizedek
[1:24:20] Melchizedek ciafani forming itself
[1:24:23] Pillar of Fire on Angel of the Covenant
[1:24:26] coming down until it comes to its
[1:24:28] fullness in Jesus Christ
[1:24:31] amen
[1:24:32] now again brother bran was speaking in
[1:24:34] the unveiling of the Mighty God
[1:24:36] he says now like a man building Chimes
[1:24:40] or making Chimes the Mulder takes each
[1:24:44] Bell and each Bell
[1:24:47] has got to have a different ring from
[1:24:50] the other do you believe that every one
[1:24:53] of us is a different personality God can
[1:24:57] reflect himself in a million ways
[1:24:59] through every one of us through his uh
[1:25:02] let me use the term his great prism of
[1:25:05] light God can express and manifest
[1:25:08] himself in so many ways and so God the
[1:25:13] prophet speaking of God molding our
[1:25:16] character like one who is molding Bells
[1:25:19] right listen oh my the same material see
[1:25:24] so much iron so much still so much brass
[1:25:27] to give it that right thing that right
[1:25:30] ring see my that's the way God did he
[1:25:34] bred this one battle to the other one
[1:25:37] metal to the other one until he got
[1:25:40] exactly what he wanted that's how he
[1:25:44] come down he unveiled himself in a
[1:25:47] perfect fire then you come down through
[1:25:49] them prophets then into the Son of God
[1:25:52] which was God himself it was the same
[1:25:55] God bringing himself out exactly from
[1:25:59] Perfection to Perfection from Glory unto
[1:26:02] glory and that's the way the church goes
[1:26:05] amen he bring himself all the way down
[1:26:08] through Jesus Christ now it's your turn
[1:26:12] now it's your turn not Jesus in the
[1:26:15] Gethsemane there
[1:26:17] but you in the Gethsemane here you now
[1:26:20] having to pass through certain things
[1:26:23] that God has in store for you amen
[1:26:26] praise the name of the Lord God remember
[1:26:29] brother Branham said we are God called
[1:26:32] God trained God sent in the denomination
[1:26:36] my friends that we find out they call
[1:26:41] you for training and you get your
[1:26:43] training
[1:26:44] and then they call you to the ministry
[1:26:47] right and then they'll send you out but
[1:26:50] God's doing differently you actually get
[1:26:53] your uh you get your training rate on
[1:26:55] the job
[1:26:56] right you got your training through
[1:26:58] experience
[1:27:00] you'll get your training in the School
[1:27:01] of Hard Knocks is that right instead of
[1:27:05] learning psychology makes you learn
[1:27:06] neology
[1:27:08] yeah he passes you through his school
[1:27:11] where he shapes you informed every
[1:27:14] believer to his perfect will
[1:27:17] every one of you in here is unique
[1:27:21] everyone is different
[1:27:23] brother Branham I think he mentions that
[1:27:26] God never met
[1:27:27] two things of the same kind in the same
[1:27:30] way ever
[1:27:31] that's why he is the he's a master he's
[1:27:35] the master of masterpieces and
[1:27:38] everything he puts out is a masterpiece
[1:27:40] you believe that
[1:27:43] the ears on your head everyone is
[1:27:45] different every ant every leaf every
[1:27:49] every snowflake is different because it
[1:27:53] comes from the master's hands your
[1:27:55] unique praise God there is nobody else
[1:27:59] like you on this Earth
[1:28:01] but I have a twin to Man's eyes they
[1:28:05] call that twin but not the God he knows
[1:28:08] every individual he knows all your likes
[1:28:11] your dislikes and everything else like
[1:28:13] that you're absolutely different from
[1:28:16] everybody else so I want you to have the
[1:28:19] confidence in yourself amen say
[1:28:21] together let's say it I am unique
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:26] praise God
[1:28:28] you are the only one that God made like
[1:28:31] the way he made you
[1:28:33] and let me praise God that's why Paul
[1:28:36] said don't compare yourself with anybody
[1:28:39] else there's nobody else like you
[1:28:41] is that right what do you compare
[1:28:43] yourself nobody else like you praise God
[1:28:46] but don't think too highly of yourselves
[1:28:48] too
[1:28:53] so God is telling us that he forges
[1:28:57] his family his his sons and daughters in
[1:29:02] his furnace you are being forged in the
[1:29:07] furnace of fire no wonder they Apostle
[1:29:11] says count it all joy when when you are
[1:29:15] allowed to pass through the fiery trials
[1:29:19] for the trying of your faith work at
[1:29:22] patience
[1:29:23] God is working something out
[1:29:26] God has a plan and you trust him in
[1:29:30] whatever he is doing praise the name of
[1:29:32] the Lord amen praise God hallelujah yes
[1:29:36] sir God wants us to surrender ourselves
[1:29:39] to be molded right in to the Rapture
[1:29:42] listen now this Bible is full of gold
[1:29:46] nuggets
[1:29:47] oh my and I just like to prospect you
[1:29:51] see when he talks people were reading
[1:29:53] these things it just sounds like he's
[1:29:54] just oh it's just this is not the real
[1:29:56] deep uh gospel here this is not deep
[1:30:00] Revelation here he's just talking about
[1:30:02] the fox or some squirrel on a branch or
[1:30:05] something but if you've got spiritual
[1:30:08] mind and eyes and the Revelation hits
[1:30:10] your soul you realize he was teaching by
[1:30:13] object lessons he was teaching in this
[1:30:17] way and you've got to understand what
[1:30:19] he's saying that you might uh read
[1:30:21] between the lines that you might
[1:30:23] understand not what the word that you
[1:30:26] may see written what what is the

[1:32:19] us that privilege and that is that he
[1:32:22] might get all of the draws out
[1:32:26] you are once in the dirt
[1:32:29] he brought you out the dirt but some of
[1:32:32] that dirt somehow end up inside you
[1:32:35] so he got to pass you through the
[1:32:37] refinery to get the dirt that is on the
[1:32:39] inside of you in your heart in your mind
[1:32:42] in your life in your habits the
[1:32:44] environment shape you and and your

[1:32:56] shaped you but there might be things God
[1:32:58] wants to check them out of us he wants
[1:33:01] to get the draft out of us amen all of
[1:33:05] it and to take it out listen now
[1:33:08] we know before there were smelters how
[1:33:11] they used to refine gold we learned that
[1:33:14] from the Indians the old Indians used to
[1:33:18] take the gold and beat it
[1:33:21] my they used to take the gold and beat
[1:33:24] it put it on a rock take another rock
[1:33:27] and keep beating on that gold day after
[1:33:30] day you come into church at one stage I
[1:33:33] used to do the same thing and I'm taking
[1:33:35] the word and beating on you
[1:33:37] beating on you beating on you
[1:33:41] notice Masters will and do it not shall
[1:33:43] be beaten with many stripes
[1:33:47] right praise God
[1:33:49] but you see God in this great wisdom was
[1:33:53] trying to shape us
[1:33:55] form us
[1:33:57] give you patience
[1:33:58] give your temperance
[1:34:00] allow all these virtues to begin to come
[1:34:03] out automatically not by human effort
[1:34:08] not by you know
[1:34:11] well God says if we slap you on his
[1:34:14] cheek you're supposed to turn your other
[1:34:15] cheek and some devil get on a man
[1:34:19] who comes with a big hard shoes
[1:34:22] stomp on your toe looking in the face
[1:34:25] and begins to grind your toe and he said
[1:34:29] well and then he slaps you on this one
[1:34:31] well the Bible says I I need to you know
[1:34:35] slap you on the other cheek so
[1:34:37] stop doing the uh
[1:34:40] and you're repressing yourself you're
[1:34:44] not being yourself if you were a real
[1:34:47] self you would say what you think you're
[1:34:48] doing at all
[1:34:51] your pain
[1:34:54] right like the old Italian gentleman
[1:34:57] said he says you hit my nose I break out
[1:35:00] your face
[1:35:02] your rights end right on the tip of my
[1:35:05] nose if if your hands stop there that's
[1:35:08] fine that's your right you can move it
[1:35:10] wherever but once it hit my nose I break
[1:35:14] your face
[1:35:17] so therefore we understand that God
[1:35:20] tests us trains us and shapes Us in the
[1:35:25] furnace of this word amen you see they
[1:35:30] beat the drop draws out of it amen
[1:35:34] and so they beat it and they kept
[1:35:37] beating it until the bitter of that gold
[1:35:40] can see his reflection in it
[1:35:44] see he says remember that until he can
[1:35:49] see himself
[1:35:51] reflected in the gold that he was
[1:35:54] beating on he is not going to stop he's
[1:35:57] going to keep beating until he see Jesus
[1:36:00] in you reflected until he sees his
[1:36:03] character reflected in you and I so you
[1:36:07] said oh why did God do this no something
[1:36:10] in you is trying to come up take out
[1:36:12] from you praise God hallelujah I know
[1:36:15] this is not the kind of preaching that
[1:36:17] makes you so happy and everything else
[1:36:19] like that praise God this kind of
[1:36:23] preaching is not the amen kind you know
[1:36:26] Hallelujah you see what God is doing is
[1:36:31] beating all the world out of us
[1:36:34] and that's what he wants to do to his
[1:36:37] church to beat it like that to get the
[1:36:41] world up so that we may reflect him his
[1:36:46] life in US amen praise the name of the
[1:36:49] Lord that's what he's doing because he
[1:36:52] is the example or example he is our
[1:36:55] author and the finisher of our faith
[1:36:59] amen he is the alpha in your Miracle is
[1:37:03] that right he is the one who starts the
[1:37:05] race and he's going to finish the race
[1:37:06] he's finishing it now praise the name of
[1:37:09] the Lord God hallelujah I'm thinking of
[1:37:11] a man from I think it was Kenya that
[1:37:15] Tanzania was in the Olympics and I think
[1:37:19] he was running
[1:37:21] um some mile or 22 miles or something
[1:37:24] and everybody passed him so many times
[1:37:27] and he was the last and and somebody
[1:37:30] says why didn't you drop out he kept
[1:37:32] running and the whole field people ask
[1:37:34] seeing him it's like
[1:37:37] embarrassed man he's still running
[1:37:39] running until he finished the race and
[1:37:43] they interviewed him and said well why
[1:37:45] you kept running everybody else ran
[1:37:47] ahead the races already finished and
[1:37:49] everything else he said because my
[1:37:52] country didn't send me here to start the
[1:37:55] race they sent me here to finish the
[1:37:58] race
[1:38:00] and we are here to finish this race
[1:38:04] that we are in here now we are here to
[1:38:07] finish the race can you say Amen do you
[1:38:10] believe that we are here to finish this
[1:38:13] race amen oh there are many you know
[1:38:17] what song is that I just got that flash
[1:38:19] in my my thought
[1:38:21] let's go let's sing it amen praise the
[1:38:24] Lord you don't mind
[1:38:25] praise the name I am going through Lord
[1:38:30] I am going through
[1:38:33] ah
[1:38:34] no
[1:38:36] whatever others do
[1:38:39] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[1:38:44] despise you
[1:38:46] I started out with Jesus and I am
[1:38:51] and the verse that struck my mind
[1:38:54] they're all there are men need start in
[1:39:00] the race
[1:39:02] but with the light
[1:39:05] refuse to keep peace
[1:39:09] others except it because it is new
[1:39:15] but not very many expect to go but
[1:39:22] I am going through Lord I am going
[1:39:27] through
[1:39:29] I'll pay the price whatever others do
[1:39:36] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[1:39:40] despise you
[1:39:42] I started out with Jesus
[1:39:46] I'm going through thanks be to God
[1:39:52] we're the last man standing last woman
[1:39:55] standing
[1:39:56] you see there was the uh Marathon I
[1:40:01] think a road race here in Burlington
[1:40:02] just last Sunday
[1:40:04] it starts out in Hamilton you see
[1:40:07] thousands of people when you come to the
[1:40:10] end of the race
[1:40:11] just few
[1:40:13] just few Crossing in that finish line
[1:40:15] all the rest dropped out this happened
[1:40:18] that happened whatever the accident they
[1:40:20] dropped out they get too thirsty
[1:40:23] whatever distracted but very few make it
[1:40:26] over the finish line and brothers we are
[1:40:29] thank God we are here amen
[1:40:32] sometimes you'll stretch to your limit
[1:40:35] but God no he knows how much Temptation
[1:40:39] how much trial we can take
[1:40:42] and he is watching
[1:40:44] over his own
[1:40:46] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:40:49] oh my I love that that God took the uh
[1:40:54] he took the figure of bells be informed
[1:40:58] and forged in the fire of his Refinery
[1:41:00] the prophet said and God forges them
[1:41:04] until that Bell begins to get that thing
[1:41:08] that ring it gets a certain ring in it
[1:41:11] praise the name of the Lord and you know
[1:41:14] sometimes they set up music with
[1:41:16] different bells of different tones and
[1:41:19] he may take a piece of stick and hit one
[1:41:21] Bell another Bell and they're making
[1:41:23] music with the Bell is that right and
[1:41:26] God is a great uh one who knows the
[1:41:30] great composer who knows how to take his
[1:41:33] word coming through different men
[1:41:35] different bells and many things things
[1:41:37] things each one has its own ring and
[1:41:41] together making a great Harmony or to
[1:41:45] the hands of the Great pause up
[1:41:47] don't you hear the bells now ringing
[1:41:53] can't you hear the angels singing
[1:41:59] there's a Glory Hallelujah Jubilee
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:07] in that far off sweet forever
[1:42:13] just beyond that shining River
[1:42:18] when they ring those gold and bells for
[1:42:24] you and me
[1:42:27] can't your hair those bells now ringing
[1:42:34] can't you hear the angels singing
[1:42:40] there's a Glory
[1:42:44] Hallelujah you believe
[1:42:49] in that power of sweet forever
[1:42:54] just beyond The Shining River
[1:43:01] when they ring them
[1:43:04] golden bells for you
[1:43:08] and me
[1:43:10] amen see
[1:43:13] the burden of the word of the Lord
[1:43:16] God even said I have loved you said the
[1:43:20] Lord
[1:43:21] yet you said to me uh
[1:43:24] how do you love me
[1:43:26] yet you understand
[1:43:30] what's not Jacob Esau Jacob's brother
[1:43:34] yet I love Jacob
[1:43:37] but hated Esau
[1:43:40] would God hit a little baby
[1:43:43] think about it
[1:43:45] God loved Jacob but hated Esau
[1:43:49] and he said before they were even born
[1:43:54] before the
[1:43:58] Forge the little baby is in the spirits
[1:44:02] are not are ageless
[1:44:04] right it's not baby Spirit and the
[1:44:07] adults no no no nothing of the kind so
[1:44:10] therefore he knows what spirit is in
[1:44:12] this one and what spirit is in the other
[1:44:14] one and he hate the one and loved the
[1:44:17] other not because it's a baby or it's an
[1:44:19] adult or it's a this or that but because
[1:44:22] of the in other words let me say it this
[1:44:24] way God loves his jeans and hates the
[1:44:28] serpent seeds
[1:44:30] God loves his jeans but he hates serpent
[1:44:33] seeds and he sees them before you do or
[1:44:37] I do or anybody knows anything about it
[1:44:40] God says I love Jacob
[1:44:44] but he hated Esau
[1:44:48] Esau the prophet said outwardly look
[1:44:51] like such a gentleman
[1:44:53] love his old daddy killed dear first
[1:44:57] daddy makes two for his daddy and he's
[1:45:00] always around his daddy taking care of
[1:45:02] him and Esau Jacob like a rascal and he
[1:45:06] said like a renegade running out there
[1:45:09] and doing every possible thing he can do
[1:45:12] and pulling tricks and smart man and
[1:45:16] pulling schemes and everything else he
[1:45:19] outwardly he looked like the red again
[1:45:21] and the Rascal amen and the other one
[1:45:24] look righteous
[1:45:26] this happens in the church
[1:45:28] a lot of people that knows how to put on
[1:45:30] the Christian Act
[1:45:32] you know I'm still preaching now
[1:45:34] but but this is done to Earth preaching
[1:45:37] is that right this is not one up that
[1:45:40] puts your head up in the heavens you get
[1:45:42] two spiritually minded you know Earthly
[1:45:44] good
[1:45:45] it just puts you to a place where a lot
[1:45:48] of people sit in the church their knows
[1:45:50] exactly the proper length of skirt
[1:45:52] they're supposed to wear
[1:45:54] whatever whatever they know exactly so
[1:45:59] they have they act on and they know how
[1:46:02] to walk how to talk how to to be able to
[1:46:06] even though they're mad at you how to
[1:46:08] hold their Temple and still look
[1:46:10] Pleasant and then as soon as you're gone
[1:46:13] something else flares up out there oh no
[1:46:16] the real Christian is who they are
[1:46:18] brother Branham said be simple
[1:46:21] be humble be reverent and God will bless
[1:46:25] you
[1:46:27] just be yourself
[1:46:29] is that right
[1:46:30] but we're not supposed to get angry who
[1:46:32] said so
[1:46:34] Paul said be angry but sin not
[1:46:38] you want to tell me somebody do
[1:46:39] something that you're not happy but
[1:46:40] you're not going to be angry you might
[1:46:42] be angry but you try to hide the angle
[1:46:44] but the Bible doesn't tell you that be
[1:46:46] yourself
[1:46:47] we who you are let the Holy Spirit teach
[1:46:51] you if not first you outwardly think
[1:46:54] like that God will begin to work on that
[1:46:57] amen and that's what a lot of people
[1:46:59] they hide up all their faults so nobody
[1:47:01] can help them nobody can pray for them
[1:47:03] this is a secret thing this is a over
[1:47:06] there hidden up no allow the Holy Spirit
[1:47:08] to deal with you praise the name of the
[1:47:11] Lord I'll know when to stop don't worry
[1:47:13] about that praise the name of the Lord
[1:47:16] amen praise the name of the Lord so
[1:47:19] that's exactly what it is God knows his
[1:47:23] genes wherever they are remember the
[1:47:26] parable of the sore and the seed the
[1:47:29] good man sowed seeds in this field God's
[1:47:32] intention at the whole human race uh
[1:47:35] from Adam and Eve would have comfort by
[1:47:39] his word and his way they would have all
[1:47:41] been spoken word right they will be
[1:47:45] informed by the spoken word because God
[1:47:47] was creating everything by his Spoken
[1:47:50] Word by faith we understand the worlds
[1:47:53] were framed by the word of God so it
[1:47:55] would have been by the spoken word but
[1:47:58] Satan changed it right and and he
[1:48:01] changed the entire thing that God has
[1:48:04] God's reproduction by his spoken word
[1:48:07] amen Satan change it and therefore
[1:48:10] created confusion upon the Earth God put
[1:48:15] now is showing what he intended the good
[1:48:17] man he says telling a parable had a
[1:48:20] field and in the field he just put good
[1:48:23] seeds
[1:48:25] but in the night an enemy came
[1:48:28] and he planted weeds and tears amidst
[1:48:33] all of these good seeds
[1:48:36] and that's the problem God now has to
[1:48:39] come the Great Eagle has to fly over and
[1:48:41] scream and cry out to find his genuine
[1:48:46] seed missed all the tears that are out
[1:48:49] there it's got to search and find them
[1:48:51] and so it's there so but God knows what
[1:48:55] is tears and what is the true seed and
[1:48:59] he loved one but he hit the other
[1:49:02] right he loves one and he hits the other
[1:49:05] oh praise God forevermore oh my think of
[1:49:09] it Jacob God says I love you
[1:49:13] and he was suffering
[1:49:16] I hate you and he was prospering
[1:49:20] is that right the Bible talks about all
[1:49:23] the words and all the this and that that
[1:49:25] he gotten all his father's natural
[1:49:29] resources Esau got it all he inherited
[1:49:32] all of that and they are going to
[1:49:34] inherit almost everything down here
[1:49:37] they're gonna inherit it and you're
[1:49:39] gonna Wonder but I'm Godly I pay my
[1:49:41] times I do this I do that and I just
[1:49:45] seem to be getting on yeah look this is
[1:49:48] their time this is their world this is
[1:49:51] their stuff not that God God doesn't
[1:49:53] want to bless us I have a series on
[1:49:55] preaching that so don't worry about that
[1:49:57] I'm leaving that now the point is God
[1:49:59] wants you to keep your eyes on him
[1:50:03] and all other things will be added on to
[1:50:06] you
[1:50:07] is that right
[1:50:08] put your eyes on him and all the rest of
[1:50:10] the material things are going to be
[1:50:12] added on to you twins in the beginning
[1:50:16] twins in the end
[1:50:18] twins in in Eve's womb back there
[1:50:21] twins in the church room
[1:50:24] at the end here you believe that oh my
[1:50:28] and yet the one has to rub shoulders
[1:50:30] with the other and say God bless you my
[1:50:33] brother God bless you my sister and you
[1:50:36] know that the devil back of that Veil
[1:50:40] dealing with the Devil
[1:50:42] in my case because of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:46] I shook hands with people
[1:50:48] and they're up in the air and they fall
[1:50:50] on the ground and the devil begins to
[1:50:53] manifest what can you do that's the way
[1:50:56] it is God works his own purposes out for
[1:50:59] his glory amen praise the Lord you see
[1:51:02] quoting brother Brandon I'm going to
[1:51:04] bring this to an end soon now he says
[1:51:07] here
[1:51:08] you see the problem was they could not
[1:51:12] figure out God's love
[1:51:15] they thought
[1:51:17] that love meant no suffering
[1:51:22] right they thought that love meant baby
[1:51:26] love
[1:51:28] with parental care in other words God
[1:51:31] should surround them with his power and
[1:51:34] and take care of them with parental care
[1:51:37] like that in other words what he's
[1:51:40] referring to there I'm going to try to
[1:51:42] make a picture of that every time the
[1:51:44] baby whimpers a Christ any natural
[1:51:46] mother doesn't matter you might think
[1:51:48] he's in a deep sleep
[1:51:50] but if that baby only go he's up right
[1:51:54] away
[1:51:54] she's built that way she's right there
[1:51:57] to meet that baby that's what he's
[1:52:00] referring to that Christians think God
[1:52:02] is like that that he just respond to
[1:52:04] baby love and a baby whimpering and baby
[1:52:09] crying and some babies that can't get
[1:52:11] their own way I am going to command God
[1:52:14] I'm gonna make God give me this and God
[1:52:16] give me that so I'm gonna scream I'm
[1:52:18] gonna stomp I'm gonna carry on he says
[1:52:21] I'll tell you you do that you gonna sure
[1:52:23] get a tanning from from the Sun and not
[1:52:26] that one up there but Mr branham's son
[1:52:28] down here
[1:52:29] oh my stomping and carrying on like that
[1:52:33] God doesn't give us that kind of baby
[1:52:36] love
[1:52:38] no that's not what it is whimpering
[1:52:41] crying and screaming but the Press of
[1:52:44] God's love is an election
[1:52:47] that he elected you
[1:52:49] that you would be one of his own
[1:52:53] that you would come to him see see God
[1:52:57] said his love was an elective love and
[1:53:01] the proof of his love is his election
[1:53:04] and no matter what happens amen that was
[1:53:10] his love in other words no matter what
[1:53:11] happened from the time you're born to
[1:53:13] the day you die
[1:53:15] you must understand that you are not one
[1:53:19] in a million one in billions
[1:53:23] that God chose to be one of his own
[1:53:27] that is his love and he's saying what
[1:53:30] you may suffer in between this temporary
[1:53:33] period of time that you live whether it
[1:53:35] be a hundred and 120 years God bless you
[1:53:37] if you live that long but if you live
[1:53:40] that long what you go through there is
[1:53:44] nothing to be compared with the glory
[1:53:46] that is to follow
[1:53:49] amen that is why those Apostles said
[1:53:53] come to the all joy when you pass
[1:53:54] through these fiery trials
[1:53:57] I'm not saying it feels good when you're
[1:53:59] going through it
[1:54:00] and you may even say brother Simon it's
[1:54:02] good for you to say are you not passing
[1:54:04] through what I'm passing through man
[1:54:07] let's change places and let me hear how
[1:54:09] are you going to scream
[1:54:10] well I I don't know but I know God built
[1:54:15] each one of us
[1:54:16] to Bear exactly
[1:54:19] what we are supposed to bear it's in the
[1:54:22] scripture he's not going to allow us to
[1:54:24] be tempted tested tried beyond what we
[1:54:28] can take
[1:54:29] praise God look there's an engineer
[1:54:31] there he knows about pressure testing
[1:54:35] under pressure test pipes rubber hoses
[1:54:39] the pressure test things right to the
[1:54:42] limit to see how much pumps per square
[1:54:44] is that thinking take
[1:54:46] amen and when they know it's in a
[1:54:49] perfect position then they pass the test
[1:54:51] and God will do the same for every one
[1:54:53] of us we're going to be pressure tested
[1:54:56] if we haven't been already
[1:54:59] he's going to pressure test you
[1:55:01] you say oh I I already got tested up
[1:55:04] there look till you leave this world
[1:55:07] all right
[1:55:09] tests are going to come
[1:55:11] and the one that's coming is stronger
[1:55:15] than the one you had before because he
[1:55:17] is maturing you to a higher level
[1:55:20] until after a while you come like job
[1:55:23] like brother Brandon it doesn't matter
[1:55:24] what test he brings God Knows Best
[1:55:28] God is working things out
[1:55:31] I said God is working things out no
[1:55:34] matter what happens in your life God is
[1:55:36] working things out everything is going
[1:55:39] to be all right
[1:55:41] you're hurting me there
[1:55:42] that's not Bob Marley this is me saying
[1:55:45] it
[1:55:47] everything is going to be all right
[1:55:49] because God is working things out
[1:55:53] praise God hallelujah
[1:55:58] you can't see the end from the beginning
[1:56:00] but no matter how it looks God standing
[1:56:04] in his Shadows is working things out for
[1:56:08] you for his glory amen just think of it
[1:56:11] his love is frozen proven by the fact
[1:56:15] you were chosen unto salvation
[1:56:19] you are chosen unto salvation and of the
[1:56:23] spirit and belief of the truth of the
[1:56:25] word of God I'm going to end Here Right
[1:56:27] Now Praise the name of the Lord God
[1:56:29] bless every one of you here I know that
[1:56:31] kind of abrupt but um
[1:56:34] that's not the end of the message but uh
[1:56:38] I'm gonna end now and let's just worship
[1:56:41] sing praise the Lord and let us chew on
[1:56:44] our cods like brother Branham say after
[1:56:47] you heard the word just sit under that
[1:56:49] tree and and just think on these things
[1:56:52] and let it come down into your soul and
[1:56:56] if
[1:56:57] you are passing through
[1:56:59] the chilly Waters or the Muddy Waters of
[1:57:03] Trials chess tribulation Temptation then
[1:57:07] this message was to was presented here
[1:57:11] to speak to you
[1:57:14] and to comfort you
[1:57:16] and knowing that God is watching you
[1:57:19] watching what you're going through
[1:57:22] and he knows every element of it and he
[1:57:25] knows exactly how to bring you out of it
[1:57:30] amen so regardless of what it is God is
[1:57:34] working things out do you believe that
[1:57:38] if you believe it let's say it God is
[1:57:42] working things out
[1:57:46] say it again God is working things out
[1:57:49] God is working things out for me
[1:57:56] every tangle of life he will undo
[1:58:01] everything he will undo it
[1:58:04] just place your life in this plan stay
[1:58:07] secure in his hands for God's he is
[1:58:11] working things out blessed be the name
[1:58:13] of the Lord may God shape every one of
[1:58:16] us
[1:58:16] through testing trial whatever he has in
[1:58:19] mind may he bless us and keep every one

[2:02:56] I know it was for me because
[2:02:59] not to go back on it again but
[2:03:02] last week Sunday you know it was 11 30
[2:03:05] my brother went through something and I
[2:03:06] asked Lord I said a man come with a
[2:03:09] machete to take his life he never all he
[2:03:11] did was he always helped this man it was
[2:03:13] somebody in his yard
[2:03:15] and I said Lord how how could something
[2:03:18] this happen
[2:03:20] he said sometimes God will only take it
[2:03:22] so far God saved his life
[2:03:24] so I know this message was for me to do
[2:03:27] just to put things in perspective to say
[2:03:29] listen sovereignty of God he's the one
[2:03:32] that control our lives right we don't
[2:03:34] have any control over life he's the one
[2:03:36] who's Sovereign so we thank God for that
[2:03:37] he's a little song I don't know if you
[2:03:39] guys know it but I just want to say
