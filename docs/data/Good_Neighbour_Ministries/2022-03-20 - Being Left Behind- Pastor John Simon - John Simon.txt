of hell loose the souls that were imprisoned and set them free thank god and i praise god he's come again the prison house is not back there with the patriarchs and prophets but hell on earth and set us free from every prison door with stained glass windows every prison that we were bounding of creeds and dogmas and we are set free now by the mighty hand of god i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them i don't know about you speak for yourself but i know i've been set free the chains have been broken the shackles have fallen off and now i'm one with my father praise god i am my father one praise god i walk in the light as he is in the light amen i'm glad to be here this morning god bless you please be seated i'm rejoicing in the lord and thanking him for his goodness and for his grace i thank him for the privilege of being here this morning and to bless his holy name now the coveted time they say is over and uh there will be announcements announcing sometime tomorrow or the next day uh that you are free not to wear your mask but of course you're free not to wear your mask but will you leave it up to you whether you want to come wearing a mask or not wearing a mask you're absolutely free to do that but while this uh was in progress we heeded the government's call we took we we participated in every protocol and to be of no to make no excuses whatsoever and let the lord have his way you see uh as my philosophy or principle is do your best then let god do the rest don't just drop your hand and say oh god gonna do it no do your best and then let god do the rest do all you can and then stand in faith believing the word of god and he will make the promises true according to this bible amen praise god brother sister i am so happy i thank god he's still keeping me on the ground yes i'm heaven bound i feel like i'm breaking through the gravitational pull and i'm breaking through the some barriers i i just feel the power in the presence of almighty god feel like a spring bubbling up in the grace of god i pray every one of you will experience the grace of god his richness of his grace and mercy once you have caught a genuine true revelation of the word of god it's a spring that never stops coming up coming up bubbling up bubbling up bubbling up amen so i'm glad that i can be here with you and rejoice with you i thank god for all of those of you who have been faithful through the entire uh time of this these viruses because it's not one it's several just keeps changing and morphing but we thank god that he has kept us true this time there's a lot of friends of mine that have passed on because of this cobin a lot of family that i have a lot of my wife's family you know even uh just passing on praise god one by one but we give god glory and praise that we are still here to do some service for his glory and for his honor and when we come to the end of life's journey and we're here in the time of the last mile of the way we'll keep serving him until he calls us home until then until that time let us keep working for the lord the evening shadows have fallen and now we're in another time so we give him glory uh uh i want to bring to you something that i have said before but i'd like to say it again many others have said it before and it's found in matthew chapter 17 verses 9 to 13 which we will stand and read once we have found it in our bibles and i pray when you leave here you'll leave uh with thoughts in your heart which you can read regurgitate like brother branham said the the sheep just doesn't eat and stop there they go and sit somewhere quiet under a tree or something and they bring it up and they chew it again praise the lord so that's what i'm saying to you that once you've heard the word of god that you will chew it again praise the lord i hold the bible in my hand but i have the text written here in larger letters matthew 9 17 9 to 13 praise the lord and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen amen that's when you're going to tell the vision that's when you're going to make it plain and his disciples asked him saying why then say the pharisees that elias must first come and jesus answered them and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that lies is come already and they didn't recognize their daenerys message they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them that was the coming of the son of man the first time and now we are in the next the coming of the son of man for this time praise the lord and then as this last verse says then the disciples understood he spoke unto them of john the baptist amen now we understand that he is speaking since back then about this prophet coming here in that spirit of elijah to fulfill the same word of god as it was back then god bless you let us pray uh for help to be deliver the word and to hear the word our gracious heavenly father we know according to your words as we ask your spirit to take a hold not so much for healing lord but we pray that the holy spirit will take a hold of our souls anoint the speaker and anoint our ears that we may hear the word of god and more so father we don't come here for just the wonderful works of god but for to enjoy uh and to soak ourselves in the sun of your presence may the holy spirit take the word shine the light that we may walk upon this pathway into the glory of god in jesus name we ask it now amen and amen may the lord bless you please be seated where you are [Music] i'm quoting brother branham speaking from redeemer and redemption san fernando california now listen close he said their homelands israel has got food so i must go back home and naomi kissed her daughter-in-laws and told them goodbye and so arfa a type of the church normally nominally the church formal was willing to kiss her mother-in-law goodbye she she was craving the things of the world and the all-formal life she used to have and turned right back to her idols because her mother-in-law had like kissed her and brother brandon says there and discouraged her just a little by saying both of them now i'm too old to have children if i would be married again and have children would you wait for them you know what that was back then the tradition was that um if one of the daughter-in-laws or the sons died then that daughter-in-law who now lost her husband um if the mother would have another son that is free she would then marry that son so what are what naomi is saying i'm already old i really can't get children but if the lord did bless me and i did get one would you be willing to wait till that boy or whatever grow up well brother branham is saying here that in a nice way she was discouraging her right it was a nice way of her discouraging her uh uh not to wait why are you gonna wait praise god hallelujah but you see that is the very type of believers following this message today and a lot of things as we have quoted the quote from unveiling of god when he said a lot of the things that i have said and done god has deliberately allowed me to say it and do it to deliberately discourage them to cause some to even leave the message and go back go out and at the same time what i'm saying will cause some to come in amen some gonna be blinded some gonna go wandering someone gonna be discouraged and turn away from it uh the message is too rough it's too crude it's too critical it's it's you know they're going to see all kinds of points amen but it's all set that way because it will cause the elected to come in even closer to him the word and to know him in the power of his spirit hallelujah amen see they come to the message and god will allow some little thing some little happening to occur in the church or in the message deliberately to cause them to get discouraged then they have a legitimate excuse now that they can say oh this happened in the church or that happened with that brother or this sister or this thing took place and they have you can't say a thing about it because it's legitimate and but it was designed to god allow it to happen so they can turn back they can go back so some go right back to the world right you say back to the world that don't mean go drinking smoking and whatever that's like that and then they go back to the world because they're craving success you can go back to the world because they're craving you know i i gotta i gotta get a big house like everybody else i've got to get this i gotta get that they gotta accomplish this uh you know various they're not willing to cast down their crowns of achievement and ambition at the foot of the savior at the foot of the lamb they're not willing to cast all of that down and to about them and give him praise and honor and glory amen that rather the praises of the world they're rather than their accomplishments in the world oh what a great woman oh what a great man oh look what she done look what they prefer that brother hallelujah because when you come in the church it's not like that doesn't matter who you are doesn't how much what you got you're just another brother you're just another sister is that right no but some don't want to be treated that way they want to be treated with you must recognize what uh what what what i have done i become a doctor i become uh my god my masters now i am a lawyer i'm this i'm that no you see once you can't break that veil and understand that that soul man that's inside jesus said all on the same level same pay doesn't matter what time of day you come in doesn't matter how much work you done or didn't do it's his right to pay everybody whatever he wants to pay them and the pay is salvation the pain is your redemption the pain is that heavenly rapture and grace that will take you in the presence of god hallelujah oh boasting oh i've been in the message for 40 years that don't mean that to god i don't mean he doesn't respect it but that doesn't give him a twist in any sense of partiality because a young boy a young girl can just come in just come in like chemical titus just come in and they just come into work for one hour and according to the bible pay them the same pay as those who start in the morning and they're going to turn to him and say master that's not fair i've been working all day i've been working 40 years in this message and look she just came in or he just came in and all of a sudden the spirit of god is moving on them and using them and people are forgetting me you see same pain it doesn't matter who we are it's his grace and mercy that we are serving him and praising god for our foot turned right back and went back to her idols and there's a lot of people are turning back and going back to their old idols brother branham said he says you know uh uh lotsa are going to uh be blinded they're gonna miss things because what they're looking at dignitaries they're looking at dignitaries right in this message their eyes are blinded by dignitaries god bless our brothers wherever they are because god bless them they can't help that amen that's what leadership is after a while people start looking up to you but the point is when you encourage that when you exploit that when you allow that to start to consume the hearts of the people and like brother branham would say oh no brother i'm not this i am not that he always seemed to be like he's putting down himself out of that office when he is the one that could have really put his hands and and say do you know who i am i'm the prophet of malachi 4. but he didn't do that oh don't say that sister don't say that brother amen he's the one running from it and other ones want to run into it amen is that right my friends if you know what's good for you run for your life and stay away from anything like that you god is always hides in simplicity you hear he hides he makes a deliberate attempt to hide hides in simplicity but that same hiding reveals himself praise god hallelujah i pray that you uh from a simple appearing simple message like this you'll be able to be able to see god making himself known within the word of god hallelujah she was going back to her old idols all the things that she used to love and you know she'd used to embrace and stuff like that back to her old mother is that right that was a literal matter now but now this is the spiritual mother now there's a lot of believers turning back to their old religious mother you know some gone back to their mother church where the fronts at least they had more order right because they preaching conduct order and doctrine but they don't have a system they don't have they don't have a literal regimentation that they're acting by so you don't know what the next guy is going to do because uh things are not in order but that's what satan loves satan loves systems because systems gives predictability and once he knows you're acting within a certain system he can always run ahead of you mess up and mess up everything because he knows your next move is according to this system he knows how you're going to move before you do it right but the sons of god as jesus said in uh john 3 3 he says they're like the wind it blows where it listed but no man knows where it goes everybody knows they got even charts of how the wind blows but you know when it really starts to blow they will tell you we don't even know where it's really going to come and where it's really going to go hallelujah but you know when the wind is blowing because you see the leaves moving and then you know the wind is passing by and that's how we know when the holy spirit is passing by praise the lord glory to god we've been given and sold a bill of goods of when to how to expect when the holy ghost is moving oh the holy ghost is really moving when the music is loud the holy ghost really moving when everybody is screaming in the church do you know in brother bran's meetings what he most of his meetings it was so quiet like this and he'd just be talking he just be talking and all of a sudden somebody screams why the holy spirit moved over there all of a sudden somebody's left out of a wheelchair spirit of god moving over there see but now they change the expectation when the holy spirit really moving people are going to fall on the floor is that right when the holy role goes is really moving brother bro i never seen brother desmond speak in tongues but all of a sudden he's going to speak in towns nothing wrong with speaking in towns i speak in towns i do privately and if god wants you to speak publicly will they speak publicly let's put his glory is that right we were done in grenada we were having a meeting where the preacher didn't want to hear me he rejected what i was saying and i got up to speak there and i'm just starting to all of a sudden sister johnson was there and another spirit drop on her all of a sudden she speaks out in towns the next thing the lady spoke out in town the next thing you know the voice spoke out to her and you know it kind of worn that church spoke to that church and so on like that but what was that it's just the holy spirit we don't have to beat not to say we're not going to sing we're not going to shout we're not going to praise god and all of a sudden you're going to go in your shell because i'm preaching like this and then you're going to want to touch the drum barely like you like you're using a matchstick you know no we come to praise god but i'm just telling you let your your your soul your spirit be open and not be bound in any system or form amen but simon i can't do that because brethren are going to say i'm playing boogie boogie music in church see what i'm saying the devil got them coming and he's got them going but the real believer when they know they are free in the grace of god and the spirit of god is doing when the spirit wants me to shout out shout when the spirit wants me to dance or dance when the spirit of god wants me to play louder play love what he wants me to play with reverential and great i'm moved by the holy ghost amen not by the will of man but by the will of god and by the power of spirit of god hallelujah amen praise the name of the living god amen one of those meetings uh i was in the home of brother ernie fandler you heard brother branham spoke of him in his books he's now dead and uh he was just telling me that uh how he hadn't seen brother branham for two years and he went to brother brown's meeting and how he got into the hotel room and i started praying and praying and praying so before you know it was like two o'clock in the morning and he was crying and praying and all of a sudden the phone rang in the in the hotel room they said well who's gonna first of all he didn't tell anybody he was coming so we're gonna know he's there so he didn't bother to answer but he kept ringing and ringing so finally an annoyancy pick up the phone and the manager for the hotel says oh mr fandler there is somebody here calling you here now he says calling me who could be calling me at this hour and then he heard a voice saying ernie this is brother branham you can turn over on your back now and go to sleep the lord has heard your prayer she was crying and crying for souls and praying for brother branson's you know laying on the stomach and the prophet seeing him and the prophet can't sleep because he is crying and crying and your prayer already heard so prophet sadori turn over on your back go to sleep let me have some rest in other words and he he just obeyed the voice of god amen he goes to the meeting the next day of course i don't plan to talk about any of this here i'm not even following what is in front of me here but the fact is he went the next day and meeting the other ministers and talking with them he says you know i thank god last night and i was praying zone and i got full of the holy ghost and i thank the lord for that and they said what full of what holy ghost what are you talking about and they start mocking him okay they got in the meeting that night brother branham was preaching and preaching all of a sudden he stopped and he turned over and looked at the brother ernie he says brother they told you you don't have the holy ghost but in the name of jesus christ i tell you you caught the holy ghost amen now he said was 3 000 people in this meeting in chicago and the next thing he knew he felt like he was in a bed with feather pillow he says when he come to himself he was seated on this side of the auditorium and he come to himself laying on the floor on the opposite side of the auditorium he said he got a foretaste of the rapture the glory divine he said brother i felt nothing i didn't know nothing all i know is that i'm i was there and then i'm over there and everything felt soft hey man of course the place went up in screams and people were getting healed and delivered and everything else like that but friends we got to keep our eyes on him because if we don't we're going to miss it amen and my subject today is of course being left behind because there's a lot of people are going to be left behind and they don't know why um they're going to be left behind at this moment here you know yes hallelujah first of all you know uh when are they going to be left behind and also um how are they going to be left behind right you see a lot of them left behind as we've said before because of their whirly and earthly cravings amen and they the next thing they're going to be left behind is failing to recognize their day and the message for their day everybody has heard brother brennan make that quotation and it hasn't really seeped down into the soul they just take it on face value to recognize your day and the message for your day and they don't realize many are trapped in the message of another day uh they're trapped into another age they're trapped and it's true these truths are the truth uh uh uh church age one two three four five six they're right behind me you see they're trapped in that age and they can't seem to get out of it and now we're living in a day and time when the people are trapped in the seventh church age because they they're blinded by the brilliance of the anointing that was upon the prophet and they keep looking back at the prophet with a frog like belief not realizing that you can't go forward while looking backwards you've got to recognize what was done there and then let that be a foundation for you to break into the holy ghost and stand on the very face or rock revelation that he was standing on then you will start to see the same things that he saw you're not going to see anything greater you're not going to see nothing like that but he was the first one of the grain that come to its ripeness and what did he say he said and that will let you know what the rest of them brains are going to be like amen because as they ripen they're going to look like the first one they're gonna start to look like the first one amen we've given given one twentieth country prophet and that prophet is uh was and is our example for this age you see back then the people saw jesus and he is our example right down to this time that began to fade away god sent a prophet exactly in the same spirit with the same anointing that you have a present tense example of the holy ghost when it possesses a man uses a man for his glory and manifests his stature through that man amen glory be to god hallelujah amen so if you're going back go back to your mothers go back there and find comfort in other words you may find feel more comfortable in your denominational atmosphere and amongst your denominational friends you're gonna find a lot of comfort in that well that's the way with you lukewarm church members the first little things comes along in the church you're discouraged and you are so willing to turn back amen oh what a pity brethren amen but they don't realize god allows that because he's trying to capture the last little something that may be in the heart of that believer on saying to the human eye but seen by hebrews 4 12 the eyes of god don't miss nothing and if you have something hide up inside you god will reveal it [Music] god will make it known make everything plain amen hallelujah yes sir the handwriting is on the wall again babylon is here among us history is repeating itself hallelujah brother brahm says here you can almost now today today not back there in babylon when the handwriting was on the wall but today from the message escape quickly escape hidden quickly we can almost begin to feel the hot winds of judgment blowing in our face the world has come to its end there is no not a hope for the world outside of the coming of the lord jesus christ did you hear that there is no hope but the coming of christ amen amen hallelujah there is no safety zone you can run though there is no bomb shelter where you can run to the only safety zone is to hide in jesus christ hide me oh my savior hide let the storms of life go past why because you're hiding in a rock of ages praise god oh brother sister let every little dove of god find itself in the cleft of the rock protected by our savior's great love hallelujah amen yes sir there is not a hope for this world outside of the coming of the lord jesus christ you can put an abraham lincoln and eisenhower in every county in america and america will still be waiting in sin if we bring that to canada we can say you can look back to every god-fearing leader that this country ever had and brother brahms you can put him in every local riding of every part of the country and you still you said you still can't turn it back their rottenness has already taken over the darkness is already coming in all the corruption is everywhere it's too late you can't turn it back the decaying of the corpse of civilization all the spirit of christ my friends cry out against that evil king the parable mighty god is working now what to not to hold that back but to take a bride out here amen praise god a bride has got to get out of this mess and take us out of this age of miss oh thank god hallelujah amen think about it the revival don't you go looking for any great revival do you know you got brethren in this message shouting oh the third pull is coming and we're going to be able to look at the sun and say sun stand still rain stop falling hey we're gonna speak on limbs and arms of course it's always possible in the midst of the bride and the holy ghost can immediately tell you to do something and you must obey it and it will happen amen but you are not to be looking for those things we are not chasing after miracles is that right the bible tells us if you believe all things signs and wonders are going to do what follow they're going to follow you you don't have to do nothing just walk in the light as his and the light and the spirit of almighty god will work to you amen so we're not sign seekers miracle chasers we are we are following the word and as we follow the word uh my friends i'm trying to bring you into the the unconscious godliness of the life of christ when you walk in this spirit and these things just happen around you you just take place it's just a normal way of life for you now you're not a miracle man or a miracle woman but it just happens oh praise god forevermore hallelujah telling you about wanting to meet the head of us of the city uh of a certain part of the city and you don't know his name don't know where he said brothers let's go up in today to the tongue hall anyway and see if we find out who this person is as we're going there we got in the parking lot i opened the car when i opened the car open the door like this the wind blow and a business card comes and settles right right there

nobody to know he's here yeah but um i'm supposed to see him and of course he came out and we talked and settle the whole matter praise god that was to do with the old church and some people were opposing us buying the building and all this stuff and of course he just told them he says oh when the people were smoking drugs back at that building you weren't reporting it when they were drinking back there and you weren't reporting it but now they're praising god and they're serving god and you're reporting it well i say it's past [Applause] amen just walk you're free hallelujah come out of that old life where you're going to church and you have to wonder i wonder the people are going to watch me how i dress they're going to look at me and nobody doesn't worry about that sort of thing of course you're not going to come in here half naked we know because there's a principle in the word of god but we don't enforce that legalistically i have no deacons at the back door with the tape measuring your skirt leg is that right praise god and nobody is measuring anybody's pants crutch or whatever but it's not that that is proper but you're not supposed to be that way and if you're if the spirit of god doesn't move on your own soul your own conscience to make you obey the word and i have to tell you that then you obey the word because i tell you because i place an order in the church saying so-and-so can't come in this one can't no you must move by the spirit of almighty god and then the god place the pastor the deacons and the officers in the church to correct the spirits that are in the church and they will know when and how to correct you with love grace be doing that very well knowing that all these people are wrong listening and then it elevates that officer no they have more wisdom than that they know how to take your side and talk with you quite less if nothing ever happened in the first place is that right what kind of a message is this anyway i'm supposed to be preaching on left behind and i'm going back and forth and everything else you must oh my but don't look for any of these great revivals they're talking about don't look for it not that you don't real look let me continue talking here amen you know the greatest revival has already struck the earth and it's going on even right now but they're looking for a great revival in the way they expect a great revival they don't understand that when brother brennan was under the first and second pull that was the ending of the pentecostal revival that was the ending of it and it went from there into the third pole where the attraction was no more healing to the body where did where the attraction was no more the discernment of spirits and the revelation of addresses and names and conditions but it went even higher where the attraction should be the word in the bible when jesus was writing into jerusalem on that little little donkey or preacher whichever one you want to put it so he was riding into into jerusalem on this little donkey and the pharisees couldn't understand why the crowds of people were attracted to him because you have to understand back there he was just another ordinary young man and he didn't have on some special beautiful suit or something like that he just was wearing the regular garb of the regular people riding on a donkey the cheapest form of transportation and yet crowds were gathering around him and they couldn't understand it what was the attraction on the mountain the people were attracted by him the word he the word was the attraction because when they looked at him they saw past the veil they started going beyond the veil for the seven seals had ripped the veil and looking behind the veil they could see and come into a supernatural communion with the pillar of fire himself and god can now be his own interpreter speaking to his own bride bringing forth the word of god and they could recognize him regardless of who he speaks truth regardless of if it's a boy of 12 or a girl or 15 or whoever they listen for the voice of god for my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow they'll recognize the voice of god hallelujah wherever it comes from glory to god hallelujah amen so the greatest revival is going on right now how many believes that amen yes sir you're looking for something you're looking for something and the devil is sure going to show you something the devil listen what he says here and escape here quickly the satan is going to keep saying yes go over there there'll be a greater thing over there oh look over there there's greater thing going on over there oh yes there is a toronto blessing run over there brother bill right oh there is a great move over there with this great evangelist come to town with revival is in his suitcase go over there when he opens that suitcase there revival will come out oh my revival everywhere great revival he says and the devil has got them in a religious trap they're they're trapped because they're looking for something greater greater greater greater you see and while they're looking for that greater thing that satan keeps saying it's passing them by in other words the real revival is passing them by amen now he says did not john the baptist was on earth and even the righteous ones some of the righteous did not even recognize him in his day amen did not even the disciples they didn't recognize him say when will eli elias come he said you see they didn't even recognize him jesus had to identify him to them for them to know amen but they didn't recognize him and he said he's already come and you didn't know it the revival amen is over hallelujah for the pentecostalists that revival is over we already got the greatest thing among us now the holy spirit manifesting himself in his generations hallelujah god's spirit is in his people now and that's the greatest revival the world has ever seen and they're failing to recognize that revival the son of man now being revealed not in the headship form of christ but in the body form of the bride of jesus christ hallelujah god in christ christ in the church the kingdom being restored back to its original amen hallelujah amen yes sir oh my don't look for nothing greater the greatest thing is here hallelujah the holy ghost his spirit manifesting himself in this his generation hallelujah and there is nothing else that can be done there's nothing greater that can be done in this day and living that we are living in oh he's still the alpha and the omega you believe that he is the beginning and the end he is the first and he is the last he is the bright and morning star but he is also the evening star oh thank god hallelujah jasper and the sardines stone hallelujah what is it what is taking place now brother branham speaking he says here history is repeating itself question and answers amen oh let's say the morning star what is it therefore to herald amen they're coming there back there but the evening star heroes the coming of this new day a new day it's another day now hallelujah that's why the evening star came out to shame this one is the coming of the sun heralds the coming of the going down of the sun and the other one the coming of the sun why we live in this day what is it there's a new sun there's a new age here now there's a new time upon us and you must come in come into it amen a new day a new age a new time come into the edge come into the time come into the spirit come into this hour and walk in the light as he is in the light praise peter god hallelujah amen the evening light don't you understand is the biggest light the evening star a greatest light to herald that it's heralding it's speaking of the sun amen hallelujah the evening lights are here praise god this age he's speaking of the edge he was in he said it is now vanishing away hallelujah vanishing away and this day is now passed over praise god and there'll be a heralding of another day coming in amen praise god aren't you glad you can see these things amen we're not blinded and captivated by uh just the things of the last age we appreciated but what we are seeing a new day matter of fact we're in the new day if you recognize your day and the message you're in you're in the new day hallelujah the dawn of a new age is here upon us praise god that was the rising of the sun back then this is the rising of the sun hallelujah brother branham speaking again here he says i always say the way dung is really up how do you know what is right don't you understand he says here let me bear this in mind we are now standing in eternity if you have truly believed if you have truly caught the revelation of the message you are now standing in eternity you are in heavenly places in jesus christ but you know what the devil goes but you don't feel like that what what did you see why are you saying that you don't have to see nothing you don't have to feel nothing the bible says so the prophet says so you're standing in eternity you change from time to eternal praise god you're not a time being you're dying as a time being you come from eternity and you're going back to eternity you come from the mind of god and you're going back to the mind of god you come from his genes and you're going back to him you know not now become eternal eternal means without beginning and without them and you didn't just now get eternal life on a certain day a certain time you were an eternal being that was in him from before the foundations of the world but you're now waking up out of your spiritual amnesia to recognize who you are and who your father is and where you're going you're on your journey glory to god [Music] you're on your journey oh praise be to god hallelujah for all we know while you're standing here the south pole may be up and the north pole may be down you don't know why because you're not in eternity you're in time and you're looking from times point of view amen what is up and what is down see we leave this and when we leave this then we really go into that eternity it's hailing or heralding the coming of that eternity amen a different day hallelujah a different time all together amen now see we believe that the coming of the lord is at hand amen hallelujah oh my uh i have to stop again come on you said the coming of the lord is at hand you see that if you're carnal if you're still in the flesh you're looking at the car the coming lord still coming up the road some some time like that you don't realize that when those the seven seals the first six told you all that was was back there and what the histories and what happened but the seventh seal brought that mighty covenant angel back to earth again that angel with the sweat back wings not a man of earth but the lord himself from heaven and when the seventh seal broke out silence why because the lord himself had come to ortiz and even the angels couldn't let that out satan couldn't get to know it because the lord himself come hallelujah praise god listen listen let me let me say it again i know you all hear this until your ears may be ringing but listen back in the old days in the old school uh the boy sees a young girl that he loves and hey he don't want to tell her walk up to her and tell her and be embarrassed so he gave a note to his friend and the friend uh which is the type of the prophet i'm talking about takes the note and he comes to the girl and he starts to tell her everything that his you know his best friend told him and you know your eyes like pearl and you this and that and so on all right you read the book of songs of solomon and so on oh my and this is what your best friend said and then after a while the best friends realized that now the girl really likes loves him and he gets the confidence to talk to her himself no more notes coming to that friend to that friend or that prophet anymore you got to get out of here so he leaves the scene hallelujah oh my and while the prophet is sleeping in this big tent to this message then another one steps forth oh my think about it this great holy spirit of the living god in this hour in time has come now from the breaking of the seventh seal and when you know it if you go you can read the seventh seal over and over again you won't find no information for your brains in there but there is food for your spirit there's food for your soul in there right because it's the lord himself that has returned to us that was the coming of the lord spiritually we know he's coming literally when we shall see him for ourselves but he has come spiritually preparing for his his his appearing his his real coming amen on the scene praise the lord and so the lord himself has come back to us and right now he's ministering to us as the interpreter of his own word is that right he's speaking to you in your heart in your soul himself not truth the prophet he allowed the prophet to store up the food so that you can eat that food and start to recognize who he is what he is what he promised he would do and your eyes get cleared up amen no more little toys in front of you like the baby born and you got toys in front of them and they caught by this miracle meeting caught by this convention they run over here to this evangelist run over there no more toys going in front of you no brother sister amen now i can see clearly now the rain is gone glory of god hallelujah i can see all the obstacles move out of my way amen praise god the sun is up the lights are shining and i can see clear what is before me for the glory of god hallelujah amen this got to be a light and that light was malachi 4 5 hallelujah shine upon the world what to turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers amen and that light has shined amen hallelujah remember friends back there the heart of the fathers went back to the children right see but now we see the children their hearts being turned back to the fathers hallelujah what is it that this is the light heralding jesus the living word hallelujah this is word but this one on the page is dead but the holy spirit has come to announce the living word the word of life and moving amongst you oh praise god hallelujah friends the evening star is the morning star because in the name of the lord i tell you it is the same star hallelujah just like the capstone and the foundation stone is really the same stone hallelujah and in between the capstone and the foundation stone is called the keystone because he holds the whole thing together so what do you say capstone keystone foundation stone is the same stone it's not three stones it's one stone it's not three gods it's one god not three ways of looking at the scripture it's one way when you look in the word of god by the holy spirit amen see for the evening and the morning star is the same star you see we are in the west but we are looking east and then we're in the uh east looking west but we bought looking at the same store see what i mean it depends on where you are at whether it's the eastern star or the western star do you see what i mean hallelujah that's the way it is it's where you are standing that's where you are standing oh spiritual brothers you understand that you talk to people and it's they're going to speak from where they're standing amen and so you've got to understand they might even be telling you absolutely truth because that's what they're seeing that's what they're seeing you can't doubt them but it's their position while they're seeing it oh my goodness praise god hallelujah you see the gentiles were not looking for any messiah i'm quoting now from christ the same yesterday today and forever tucson arizona 1963 remember we and los saxon we were all heathens we were going around with clubs on our backs worshiping idols we wasn't looking for no messiah the jews were looking for a messiah the samaritans were looking for a messiah which were half jew half gentile now we know that he only comes and identifies himself to those who are looking for him and that's the same way that he will be and do at this his second coming amen he is only coming and identifying himself to those who are looking for him hallelujah how are you going to look if you don't have eyes to see you see you him that had an ear to here let him here and if you have eyes to see let him see where you get those eyes from you see where you get those eyes from because they were his jeans was placed in you before the foundations of the world no man can see god and live so how you seeing god how you recognizing god because a particular part of god was placed in yours before you knew is that right before you knew it you had eyes to see but you didn't know you have eyes to see you thought everybody was seeing what you see but it's not the same sight they just got natural sight and you got natural sight plus spiritual sight back there and you seeing it like that and you're seeing the word of god made clear praise god hallelujah amen oh my think of it wow you take god now at his word amen and the world will when jesus comes now the world will know nothing about him he'll just come to take his church and be gone and those who are not looking for him will be left behind hallelujah it's just going to be a natural event of things what do you mean i'm not looking for him i'm going to a church that's preaching that there's going to be a a rapture and that we're all going to rise up in the air all the tombs gonna bust open and we're gonna rise into the presence of god i'm going in the rapture too but you see those who have really eyes that are looking for him that has a rapture revelation they use the word rapture on what the rapture is they don't realize that the rapture is a revelation they're talking about they're waiting for the rapture they don't realize the rapture is already in progress they don't realize that you got to know that you're in a part of that rapture right now hallelujah you're not waiting till up the road somewhere up there some mysterious day all of a sudden then you're in the wrap no you are part of that rapture now and when you know you're a part of it you are certain of god you are certain of your you're going out of this place amen because you already started on the trajectory is that right oh my goodness how many of you have took a flight and you didn't even realize when the plane was in the air the plane on the air and you still think you was on the ground you don't realize how the holy spirit is taking you so gently off that you don't realize what's happening to you praise god you cannot with your normal things but you already passed through the liftoff oh my oh lord of god my soul is rejoicing in jesus christ my savior i said i'm in the liftoff praise god the holy spirit has cut a hold of me my god you go in the water to swim you got to watch it because if the riptide get ahold of you you don't have to do nothing it's just going to carry you out to sea and if you are here in under the influence of the holy spirit and the season is here for the rapture it just takes you in the rapture you're just gone you're just gone there's nothing you gotta do about it you can fight up and carry on and whatever you're caught up in it lord i change my mind i don't want to go too late amen paul said look even if you don't want to go and you start to doubt god is greater than your heart is that right i said god is greater than your heart and i know why paul said that because even though we believe when we believe the revelation some days sometimes the devil play in your mind plain you you feel really dumb you feel dumb amen praise the lord you feel discouraged uh you don't know where to go and god set it up and say man who you really going to talk to somebody else that don't understand and don't have that level of understanding how are you going to do it and then god kicks in and he begins to speak to you comforts you because he wants that he wants that that he has the privilege of cuddling and comforting his own bride with his word hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah amen the world will know nothing about this hallelujah the church will be gone and those who were not looking for him they will all be left behind he's only coming for those who are looking for him flashing red light of his coming amen reminds you very much amen you've done it you've seen you see what's going on with the war over in ukraine people are rushing to all the railroads the trains they can find and sometimes the train has to take off and a lot of them are running with their baggage and everything else to see if they can catch up with the train but the train is out the station already and it's heading outwards but the prophet is giving a scene here and he's split this way you know it's a the train you can't hear the train you're waiting to catch that train and while you're waiting to catch that train many people are just standing around doing nothing because they're just waiting to catch the train you find that spiritually going on right now they're just going to church that's standing around we're waiting for the train we're waiting for the rapture read lord to take us home and they're waiting for that like that now see what you see they're waiting to catch the train they can't some can't hear the train they can't see him at this point he used the word him not train anymore but you don't see him but you know it's the time hallelujah something in you you sense the time praise god that you're living in oh my oh my and many that don't sense that or not that time they begin to walk around in this station yes they're in the station but they are walking around with their hands in their pockets right they're walking around with their hands in the pockets oh i don't want to preach on that you understand what he's talking about there they're preaching the servant god but they still have money on their mind right [Music] they make sure their pocket full right okay they're walking around with their hands in their pockets are the ones are sitting on their suitcases and yet other ones are going around buying nothing but peanuts can you imagine that the rapture coming and you're wasting your time with the things in the world here buying peanuts nothing real nothing lasting nothing that will go right on forever and forever and the next thing you know the red light begins to flash amen you're expecting to leave on that train i tell you in the name of the lord you better throw away those bags of peanuts amen throw them away stop all your talking get your suitcases and get ready or you will be left behind amen your brother left behind if you don't do that amen and he'll come and he'll be gone and if you still stand chatting the neighbor across the street you will be left behind none of us wants to be left behind do we no true seed of god can be left behind the elected will not be left behind third exodus you realize we are in the third exodus how many knows that praise god hallelujah my dear friend brother vin down and truly that there that's the name of his assembly third exodus assembly praise god hallelujah and we are actually in the third exodus right now oh my oh

of all them systems around you and serve the true and the living god for this great angel of the covenant is here jesus christ in the form of god now he's the form of the pillar of fire the same form that he was back there when he brought the first exodus bringing the second exodus but now he is here with us to take us out of here in the third exodus do you believe that he's here in the third exodus praise god hallelujah i believe that same god that same pillar fire is here praise god hallelujah amen how can you go watching for something listen listen close and i'm slowing down even more than i have been how could you go hunt for something or hunt for a pumpkin but you have never seen one before any of you ever seen the coming of christ how many are in here saw the coming of christ you see you've never seen it before so you will know what you're looking for you don't know what to expect go go find bring me that that left-handed uh jackson bar from the you see you don't know what it is you may go and pick up a hammer and telling me that is it because you don't know you see he says here you never seen one you never even heard of one how could you go find a watermelon even though you're looking at it if you never know there was such a thing on how it should look how are you going to find it right see how you're going to find the watermelon you might pick up a tub and think you've got a watermelon how could you find anything else that way but you see you have got to know what you are looking for you've got to have a revelation of what you're looking for to know what it is you're talking about the coming of the lord he said well how are you going to know it when it's happening when it's taken place how are you going to know it you can't know it unless you know what it is and you cannot you gotta have a revelation of it praise god and the revelation will make you recognize hallelujah and you recognize what is going on now amen amen what you looking for you got to know what's going on the only way you'll ever know and the only way you're going to know what's going on and what you're looking for you're looking for and you will then know to look for the word for he is the word amen praise god they are dead that testify of me search the scriptures you claim you are now listen to this quote here you claim you are believers of the prophets you claim you are believers of the prophet but he said you are of your father the devil following the prophet following jesus around and then turning around trying to trip him trick him trap him into various things and read all manner of things in there he says following the prophets amen believers of the prophets but of your father the devil do you believe that people in this message could be of their father the devil let me tell you my friends that is not just words talking that is real you got more devils in this message now than there ever was out there because the devil realized this is the last part of the whole thing and he has just filled just like putin is trying to fill the united states with all kind of spies now and the united states vice versa is trying to get as much spies as they can into there to let them know what's going on that devil also saturate the whole message with a bunch of devils enticing spirits amen operating where in the religious realm my watching and waiting and trying to decipher what is going on but thank god the prophet of god made it clear they'll never be able to know what this is to be able to copycat it or the devil ain't going to find nothing that he couldn't be able to try to uh what's the word not copycat but you won't be able to impersonate thank you brother impersonate he won't be able to impersonate this because you can't put it on it's the life of christ in you working through you praise the lord i'm quickly coming to an ending of what i'm talking about here right praise god believers of the prophet believers in the prophet and still blind to the truth and the grace of god let me tell you simple ordinary people some of you are not preachers you're just believers but let me tell you some in here seated are greater than john jesus said because we are being given things beyond what he had at that time if he was here no doubt that's why he said oh i wish i can go into that golden age he would want to come on down but he was just not allowed because he said no two of us can be on the earth at the same time well i have to go i must decrease that he might increase he's the one who's gonna talk to the bride amen praise god hallelujah think about it amen see you claim you are of you are believers of the prophet your father yet you you claim that then god sent the prophet uh and and you put them prophets in the grave you killed the prophets amen but now what are they doing they're killing his influence they're killing that influence of the prophet righteous man he says i'm talking about holy man man that if you look at them you couldn't even put a finger on their life yet jesus himself called them nothing but serpents and devils oh my oh friends apply this to our day hallelujah god's chosen place of worship do you realize the shadows of the old testament are now fading and it's now going into the positive of the new testament hallelujah all the modern events are now being made clear by vindicated prophecy all them shadows and types about jesus christ came fulfilled when he came on the scene all the shadows and types concerning the bride the rapture the bride the growing home of the church the the negative which was the types and shadows are now coming into perfect realization it's coming into perfect reality by the holy spirit moving in the hearts and lives of the believers amen every day praise god don't you know all the feasts the holidays all of the tabernacle all the wood in there everything in the tabernacle was a type of christ all the offerings all the laws it was a type of christ every and now in our day watch every creed every church every denomination amen a tape a shadow see and now they they're being left far behind and they are no more not even in the race at all think of it every denomination he says he repeats every denomination they are completely left out of this see why there is no place for them in this hallelujah in putting together the great jigsaw apostle that the old man was putting together of the face of jesus christ hallelujah when it fits all together the true believer been it's been revealed to them and the word will begin to fit together their understanding will begin to open and the world will fit together but then all of a sudden the devil throw in a piece but that peace there is no place for it it can't fit in there to make the thing complete so you could see jesus christ and you know the same with this judah's spirit there was no place for judas he could not be found think of it at that time they could ever be so sincere like esau was seeking repentance with tears unforgiveness with tears oh my you know forgiveness is a funny thing the devil has got forgiveness down to the point that um people only have to say i'm sorry and wants to say he said well what else can the guy do they already told you that he's sorry what can she do she already said she's sorry that's not repentance because that makes them go out and do the same thing over and over again amen that's not repentance oh but you should forgive them you're a christian you should forgive them and forgive them forget all that they thought no the only person that can forget anything is god he can forget and put it in the sea of forgetfulness while you're in this flesh you can't forget no fool yourself you can't forget you can remember but you don't hold nothing here but some people think because you remember you ain't forgive it doesn't work that way that's not real forgiveness right forgiveness goes here forgive i can forgive you but i still recognize what kind of spirit is on you and how that spirit is going to act how it's going to move so i got to be watchful i got to be very careful of what's taken place amen praise the lord hallelujah praise god you must know what you're doing praise god or else you'll find yourself fighting the air that's what paul talked about you're fighting up and you fight in the air when you fight in the air you don't even know what you're doing right come back to the word of god get lined up with the word of god you see a soldier doesn't act until he gets orders to do it amen and we must be soldiers get your orders see see not not that not the orders or the charges from yesterday not the charges the general gave the day before see not the but the charge or the the order for today hallelujah that's what we are trying to do here is to obey the order for this day you know how many years i take all kind of smears all kind of talk what what is birth simon talking about what is this stuff here but you see in a way the lord jesus make me say things and put things ahead of my time it was and so when you're saying it it couldn't be caught couldn't be understood or else they think that you're saying those things because you want to make yourself something but the more you see the word you want to make less of yourself you don't want to be nothing amen you want to get out and let god out this way amen see modern events are slipping by so swiftly that one day they're going to find out you're left behind left behind without nothing you'll be caught and sealed into the mark of the beast before you know it amen the prophecies that promise every one of them fulfilled in its age it foretells what the author has done and what he will do again oh what a time that we are living in praise god we are not living in the methodist age the baptist age we are not living in the pentecostal age and as you see i have to stop here and i keep repeating this because this is the brother branham said some of them got something stuck in their craw and and they can't swallow the the fullness of the world and it's stuck there they can't get it down they don't realize that brother branham was the prophet of malachi 4 and that he was the seventh angel to the leodision church age don't they know that the judicial church is the pentecostal church age and that he was the messenger of the pentecostal church age but he was also used as the wave shift or as the one to bridge the gap to bring us right to the to the river right up to bradley kindness to the to the bank of the river jordan to the crossing over but he was not allowed as i was with moses social identity he was not allowed to take your cross he can't joshua is allowed to take you across and joshua is a type of the holy spirit so the holy spirit takes over from that point amen and takes you across this great messenger from heaven not another man on this earth claiming he's a messenger but the holy spirit himself taking you across hallelujah into the promised land of the revealed world open up before you a new vista and your panorama of the world opens up before you lord of god hallelujah amen oh think of it right now you're looking at the calendar and you find out what day of the year you're living in but when you look in this bible when you look in the word of god what age you're living in we're not in the methodist baptist age pentecostal age or anything we are living in the bride age i said we're living in the bright age praise god hallelujah shall come from his side this is not where god took e from he took eve from adam's side right what rib was it which rib fifth rib wow what a number my anyway he took her on from that fifth rib that grace number and brought her from adam's side and she could be visibly seen standing there beside him but he still called their name and they shall be called adam even though it was two of them standing there god said their name shall be called adam

behind praise god let's go over the facts i've i've said this to some of the brothers quietly people are being left behind right now and they don't even know it they're left behind in understanding they're left behind in revelation they're already left behind the gap is widening you don't have to separate yourself from nobody oh that brother doing this listen no god himself is separating is that right separating by his word god bless you i trust you have been enlightened strengthened and you caught the revelation of this prophet's message the last prophet's message praise god and brother branham has left us come on brother come on all you singers worshipers and praise the lord i thank god for this prophet of god amen praise god hallelujah yes sir i was studying over the so coming in

lord friends i want to say that i've been serving the lord and preaching this message for about 63 years and i just want to thank the lord he has brought me thus far you know what i'm praying for now that god will um bring you let the eagle renew its strength but for that to happen uh it takes the eagles down in the valley and they go through all kind of emotional all kind of physical things and they get broken down and everything before he can renew their strengths and i pray that god will renew my strength like that of the eagles i'll hearing you my strength like he did with abraham and sarah uh when there are 100 that the pharaoh can look at sarah and want her to be his wife my praise god but she wasn't even bothered with that amen you lose sight of the things of the earth but the grace of god hallelujah i just ask god to give me health and strength and grace more understanding and that the word will go forth to your benefit and blessing now remember we are not to uh my sermon has ended i'm just commenting now i'm just saying we are not now to think well the brain is supposed to be just a certain number of people and so no we have continued great evangelistic work we have got to reach out because remember we're reaching out for the remnant and for the last elect that's supposed to come in we got to find that last elected seed son or daughter of god certified by the holy spirit that they can come into this revelation of the message of this hour and at the same time we must reach out for the remnant to bring as many of them is as we can is that right because they are of the same quality clot that we were cut from it's just that they were not included in this part of it but we got to have that heart reaching out for them bear that in mind and reach out with the message give out let them know a prophet has come go back to the simplicity and the foundations of it you got to start there because you're not talking to people that have your understanding you're talking to babies and people so share the message hallelujah share it and start from the where they are and bring them into the grace of god if it's an elected seed of god they'll pick it up so fast they'll they'll come right in to everything that you have in no time so oh but it took me so many years it'll take them one day or less than a day and the holy spirit is going to do that so you give them grace god praise god you hear what i'm saying reach out don't stop reaching out or slow down now you're coming to the end of the of the race no praise god you got that race and that crown right ahead of you that's when you now should pick up your pace amen and come to the end of the race shouting glory victory in jesus my savior forever god bless every one of you here today praise god
