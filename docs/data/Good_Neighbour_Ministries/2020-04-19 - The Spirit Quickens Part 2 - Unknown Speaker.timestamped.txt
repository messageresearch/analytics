[0:12] good Sunday morning neighbor I'm pastor
[0:17] John Simon from good neighbor ministries
[0:20] of Burlington Ontario Canada welcome to
[0:26] this broadcast today and also welcome
[0:30] into the presence of God may God richly
[0:33] bless you
[0:35] as we continue with our talk today
[0:39] concerning the Spirit quickens the word
[0:43] part 2 now on last Sunday's broadcast I
[0:50] spoke about the spirit quickening the
[0:54] Word of God specifically the spirit of
[0:58] the word of God quitting's they were to
[1:03] the age in which we are living in now in
[1:07] 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 6 it is
[1:10] written in the Word of God not that we
[1:15] are sufficient of ourselves to think
[1:17] anything as of ourselves but our
[1:20] sufficiency is of God who also had made
[1:25] us able ministers of the New Testament
[1:29] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[1:35] the letter killeth but the Spirit gives
[1:38] it life now last week I spoke on this
[1:46] wonderful subject of the spirit giving
[1:48] life to the word quickly in the word
[1:50] making the Word of Life and in that we
[1:53] showed how that God's Spirit quickened
[1:57] the word at creation then we showed how
[2:02] the Spirit of God quickened the word in
[2:06] the womb of Mary and caused a
[2:10] supernatural birth to take place we
[2:16] further show how the Spirit of God
[2:19] quicken
[2:20] the body of Jesus Christ that was in the
[2:25] tomb and God quickened him and raised
[2:30] him remember he was the word made flesh
[2:35] we received the truth from that the
[2:39] God's Spirit it takes God's Spirit to
[2:43] raise up resurrect or to quicken the
[2:47] Word of God this is why Paul used the
[2:50] term if the same spirit that raised
[2:54] Christ from the dead dwell in you it
[2:58] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[3:02] that spirit the Holy Spirit that dwells
[3:06] in you so the word quicken the word at
[3:13] creation the word quickened in the new
[3:18] creation it quickened the word in the
[3:22] womb of Mary it quickened
[3:25] Jesus the word that was buried in the
[3:30] grave for three days then it raised it
[3:34] up we further made clear that even
[3:38] though the burial death burial and
[3:41] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[3:44] type are in foreshadowing that his body
[3:51] his church his wife would be buried and
[3:56] we further show how did the spiritual
[4:01] resurrection of the true apostolic
[4:04] church the body of Christ with all of
[4:08] its original teachings its doctrine that
[4:12] body of Christ was buried during the
[4:16] dark ages killed pierced
[4:22] buried burned boiled and persecuted
[4:28] during the dark ages and placed in the
[4:33] great
[4:35] oven two men living under that Roman
[4:42] persecution suffering and finally death
[4:46] she was dead and buried the truth was
[4:51] dead and buried the word became dead it
[4:55] became a litany it became literature it
[4:59] became beautiful poetry in the minds of
[5:04] men
[5:04] it became religious history in the
[5:08] hearts of many men under Satan's
[5:11] seductive teachings and words mr.
[5:16] distractions of God's words subtractions
[5:20] from God's Word just deluded and
[5:23] deceived and seduced the minds of men by
[5:27] his enticing teaching spirits grabbed
[5:32] the whole of the mind of men took them
[5:35] away from the Word of God and so the
[5:38] true church was buried during these dark
[5:42] ages however I reminded you that in Joel
[5:47] chapter 2 verses 23 to 26 God promised
[5:52] according to his word I will restore
[5:56] saith the Lord God promised that he
[6:00] would restore everything let the plumber
[6:04] work the caterpillar and the cankerworm
[6:08] had eaten away from the church all the
[6:12] church was one church but after the Dark
[6:16] Ages it became broken up divided search
[6:23] into denominational isms and the
[6:30] fellowship the unity the love the
[6:34] brotherly kindness the joy the saints of
[6:38] God shared because they could see
[6:41] eye-to-eye on the troops of the Word of
[6:46] God
[6:46] that was taken away from them by the
[6:51] introduction of all manner of perverted
[6:55] doctrines contrary to the Word of God
[6:57] and so God promised in his word that he
[7:01] would restore his word he would restored
[7:05] his church and so justice in three days
[7:10] jesus' body was raised up from the grave
[7:14] we find that in three ages of the church
[7:19] the spiritual body his spiritual body
[7:23] was raised up from the tomb of the Dark
[7:27] Ages where Satan tried to kill her and
[7:31] bury her and confine her there but by
[7:36] the power of God the holy spirit of the
[7:40] Living God
[7:40] began to raise the church back up out of
[7:46] church history began to raise her up and
[7:49] bring her back to her original position
[7:53] we made clear to you that the first
[7:58] let's say the first indication of this
[8:01] or first sign of this was their life the
[8:05] shoot of God a little leaf just pointing
[8:09] out of the ground which represents
[8:13] Martin Luther a sprout coming out of the
[8:17] ground Martin Luther with his doctrine
[8:21] of justification by faith paved the way
[8:25] for John Wesley and the doctrine of
[8:32] sanctification first Wesley was teaching
[8:36] you're not only to be justified or saved
[8:38] and then live all kinds of lights
[8:43] contrary to the Word of God but you must
[8:46] live a justified life and also a
[8:49] sanctified or holy life toe toe so that
[8:54] you will represent God and your life
[8:57] your walk your talk your will be a
[9:01] testimony for the glory and praise of
[9:04] God but that was not at all the the true
[9:09] church was not yet fully restored under
[9:13] justification
[9:14] nor was it fully restored under
[9:17] sanctification
[9:19] so sanctification teaching the doctrine
[9:24] for doctrine means teaching on
[9:27] sanctification had to give way or make
[9:32] way for the Pentecostal baptism of the
[9:37] Holy Spirit the great 1906 read Bible on
[9:43] a Sousa Street when the Holy Spirit once
[9:48] again visited the Church of the Living
[9:50] God and revealed to us it's not by might
[9:55] nor by power but by my spirit saith the
[9:59] Lord
[9:59] so the Spirit of the Living God came
[10:03] back to the church again and began to
[10:07] move with signs and wonders and miracles
[10:11] and out poured himself upon the church
[10:15] with great anointing of the Holy Spirit
[10:18] and in there we find out how God was
[10:22] misunderstood because man had already
[10:26] inserted their various doctrines initial
[10:31] evidences their fundamentals their
[10:34] catechisms
[10:36] their books of claiming this is the book
[10:40] of truths and each one pointing in a
[10:43] different way so God sent a marvelous
[10:47] wonderful messenger and out of this
[10:52] great of pouring came God's messenger
[10:56] for the aged William Marion brand him
[11:00] better known in the writings of Gordie
[11:05] Lindsay of the Pentecostal revival wrote
[11:09] this marvelous life story of brother
[11:13] William Marilyn Brennan and entitled it
[11:17] a man sent from God the 20th century
[11:22] prophet God had promised according to
[11:25] Malachi 4:5
[11:27] then he would send back the spirit of
[11:30] Elijah the spirit of Elijah to rest upon
[11:34] a man in our day and in our time to
[11:39] restore back the faith that was given to
[11:43] her Apostolic fathers buried during
[11:46] Roman condemnation and destruction and
[11:52] burial and that it would be restored and
[11:56] resurrected back true the message the
[12:00] Ministry and message not by the man but
[12:04] by his message God would use that to
[12:08] bring his elect back to the fullness of
[12:12] the truth and the revelations of the
[12:15] Word of God
[12:16] now this messenger we know with brother
[12:20] William Branham God rest his gallant
[12:24] soul a soldier an anointed man of God
[12:28] one like in his capacity and stature one
[12:35] said to each generation and now he has
[12:40] dead and gone and we are surrounded by a
[12:44] lot of imposters copycats impersonators
[12:49] contrary to God's promise of the owl now
[12:54] as I said before he is dead and gone but
[12:58] his message that he had and declared and
[13:04] is now preparing brothers and sisters
[13:08] preparing the way for the coming of the
[13:13] Lord
[13:13] himself farming no the scripture tells
[13:17] us Christ means The Anointed One he
[13:22] makes the way his message is making the
[13:25] way just like John the Baptist with the
[13:27] spirit of Elijah his message prepared
[13:30] the way cleared the baggage out of the
[13:34] way for the coming of the Lord Jesus
[13:36] Christ and then he had had to find the
[13:39] Word of God for that hour so does the
[13:42] Ministry of this messenger prophet
[13:46] identify the Word of God for this hour
[13:49] and this thing now identifying Christ
[13:54] Christ means The Anointed One or
[13:58] specifically the anointed Word of God
[14:03] anointed Word the Messiah the Word of
[14:07] God said to us back then that word that
[14:11] was sent came in flesh but now he has
[14:15] returned in Word form and we are to
[14:19] unite or meet not him in this corporal
[14:22] body at what we know in scriptures at
[14:25] the rapture but here he is appearing
[14:28] revealing making himself known in the
[14:31] form of the word and the ways being
[14:34] prepared for his physical coming his
[14:38] corporal coming in his corporal body for
[14:42] right now he is here in the form of the
[14:45] Blessed Holy Spirit God anointing and
[14:48] revealing his own word to his people for
[14:52] those who have two ears to hear let them
[14:55] hear what the Spirit of the Living God
[14:57] is saying to the churches speaking to
[15:01] his elect loss that he lost from the for
[15:05] the foundations of the world but and has
[15:07] come to seek and to save those that were
[15:11] lost many of them from from youth they
[15:15] recognized that they were born different
[15:17] they were born with a different
[15:21] in them sure they might have done every
[15:24] crooked thing every evil thing every
[15:26] wicked thing every sinful thing but yet
[15:30] in the deep of their heart they're
[15:32] recognized there's a voice calling
[15:34] there's something speaking to them and
[15:37] that same God promised that he would
[15:40] redeem he would call back his children
[15:44] back to himself that they will know him
[15:47] in the power of his resurrection and I
[15:51] want to take God today that under God be
[15:54] the glory that the seven seals of the
[15:57] book of Revelation have been opened unto
[16:01] us and out of the opening of those seven
[16:05] seals we fight all of it came for
[16:08] quitting power to quit net that God's
[16:13] spiritual body his church his elected
[16:17] church his wife to quicken her by the
[16:22] opening of the word the seven seals open
[16:26] out of it this quickening power was
[16:29] released upon the Church of the Living
[16:31] God the seven thunders came for the
[16:35] voice of God the mighty angel came forth
[16:38] and the true election of God could
[16:41] recognize it for this day for we cannot
[16:45] live us off of yesterday's mana we
[16:49] cannot live off of Luther's teaching we
[16:53] cannot live off of Wesley's teaching we
[16:56] cannot live off of all dead Pentecostal
[17:00] mana we must live from the fresh word of
[17:04] bread from heaven sake from God true God
[17:08] sent God anointed and God vindicated
[17:12] prophet and because we know that the
[17:15] word he preached that many have
[17:17] misunderstood it was not his word but it
[17:21] was thus saith the Lord long after it is
[17:25] gone
[17:26] yet God's Spirit is vindicating that
[17:30] message vindicating that word bringing
[17:34] it to pass unfolding it revealing it
[17:38] manifested and manifesting it in
[17:41] Revelation in understanding and wisdom
[17:44] and in healing miraculous power and the
[17:49] raising of the Dead mighty works of God
[17:51] being done through the Ministry of the
[17:55] entire bride of Jesus Christ for he has
[17:58] returned to inhabit and to possess and
[18:01] to claim his entire body and to take it
[18:06] with him back in the rapture for his
[18:10] glory amen
[18:11] praise God so we understand then friends
[18:15] that he the spirit out of the seven
[18:19] seals that were open came out to quicken
[18:26] their word for the hour to resurrect and
[18:32] restore that word that was lost not her
[18:39] only during the dark ages but God had
[18:42] lost his word beyond the foundations of
[18:47] the world which let me let me take that
[18:49] time I'm going to get to that but God's
[18:52] Word had to be restored back to us the
[18:58] word that was predestinated for this
[19:02] hour that part of the world and all of
[19:06] the work that was predestinated for this
[19:09] hour God promised to resurrect revive
[19:13] and restore this word back to us and
[19:16] when I say this word I'm speaking about
[19:19] the written word and I'm also speaking
[19:23] about the Living Word the Living Word
[19:27] and when I say the living word I'm not
[19:30] talking about Jesus that was back there
[19:34] 1900 or two
[19:35] thousand years ago and though was the
[19:39] word made flesh and then was crucified
[19:42] dead and buried but I'm take talking to
[19:46] you about when he died and he gave up
[19:50] the ghost and the Holy Spirit went back
[19:54] to heaven came back down came back down
[20:00] that he might be the spirit of truth
[20:02] that he might be our do the Miss are the
[20:06] power to give us power to be witnesses
[20:11] to fill us to anoint us and to dwell in
[20:15] us to be his people and he to be our God
[20:20] to live within his people to have his
[20:23] own house for Solomon could not build
[20:26] him a house but he has built and is
[20:28] building his own house building his
[20:32] house to live in his people for his
[20:36] people are the house of God knowing not
[20:40] you are the temple you are the temple
[20:43] your body is the temple of the Living
[20:46] God and God lives within your heart by
[20:49] faith if you are his elect and you
[20:51] believe his word you receive them within
[20:54] your heart amen so the word is being
[20:58] made flesh again not just in Jesus for
[21:03] that was already prophesied by Isaiah
[21:07] and many of the other prophets that the
[21:10] word would be made flesh and that word
[21:15] became flesh in one man named Jesus
[21:20] Christ and God the Jehovah of the Old
[21:25] Testament dwelt in him but he had an
[21:31] Earthling name that was called Jesus but
[21:35] the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the
[21:38] same Jesus of the new for he said it is
[21:41] when I to speak but the father that
[21:44] dwelleth in me he doeth these words God
[21:46] and Christ her one he said
[21:49] I am my father are one God created that
[21:53] body in the womb of Mary for himself
[21:56] came down and dwelt in that body and God
[21:59] in that physical body could not be
[22:03] killed they tried to crucify it at
[22:05] Calvary but he left that body came back
[22:08] down and now to dwell in the body of his
[22:13] believers or his believing elected
[22:17] church elected for this hour in other
[22:21] words when I say left I mean that God
[22:25] predestinated you to this out that when
[22:28] he comes in this age he was fine vessels
[22:32] prepared and waiting for him to indwell
[22:35] and use for his glory to manifest his
[22:40] presence to declare his word and to
[22:43] fulfill their purpose and mission here
[22:46] on the earth and to declare the name of
[22:49] the glorious heavenly Father amen and
[22:52] amen
[22:53] Oh may God bless you unbelieving god
[22:56] that while I'm speaking somewhere
[22:58] someone will recognize their position
[23:02] not in the church but in Christ that
[23:05] they will recognize their position of
[23:07] who they really are and why God placed
[23:10] them here upon the face of the earth now
[23:13] we know that Jesus Christ lost the head
[23:16] he was the word in them and he was the
[23:20] head of the body and that head of the
[23:25] body was raised up the entire body was
[23:29] crucified Devon berry but he died had
[23:32] ship amen represented there as the head
[23:37] of the church head of the body was
[23:39] raised up now we are in the midst of
[23:44] another resurrection but it's not the
[23:47] resurrection of the body of Jesus Christ
[23:50] back there it's now another resurrection
[23:54] of the spiritual body of Jesus Christ
[23:58] those who are elected to make up that
[24:01] spiritual body
[24:03] those who he he elected of course he's
[24:07] calling and placing them positionally
[24:11] before they're caught up and caught away
[24:14] in the what we know scripturally as the
[24:18] rapture rapture process now we know the
[24:22] very word rapture is not really found
[24:25] written in the scriptures but it says
[24:27] caught up they shall be caught up
[24:29] they'll be caught away sudden secretly
[24:33] they'll be caught away by the grace of
[24:36] God but we are in the midst and in the
[24:39] middle of another great resurrection and
[24:43] that resurrection has already started we
[24:48] are raised up from the darkness of the
[24:51] grave grave of what you are spiritually
[24:56] dead but you had hid quicken he has
[24:59] quickened you or raised you up to live
[25:02] above sin and to walk in a resurrected
[25:06] life or in a new life raised up above
[25:10] all the filth all the darkness all the
[25:13] doctrines all the confusion and the
[25:16] chaos of the age and the world and time
[25:19] and season that we are living in raises
[25:22] you up above every every blockage that
[25:25] will be placed in front of you that you
[25:27] might recognize him who to know his life
[25:31] eternal
[25:32] now that resurrection has already
[25:35] started and that resurrection leads
[25:38] right into the rapture so let me repeat
[25:43] Jesus Christ the head has already had
[25:47] his resurrection
[25:48] now this is the body time this is the
[25:53] bride's time this is the Lambs wife time
[25:58] train for his spiritual body to be made
[26:02] manifest it's manifesting time time for
[26:07] the glorious manifestation of the sons
[26:10] of God
[26:11] of God that were hidden in all these
[26:15] various denominations which the Bible
[26:18] types and calls in symbolic form about
[26:22] Mystery Babylon the mother of harlots
[26:25] and says in the book of Revelation come
[26:29] out from her my people be not partakers
[26:33] of our plagues God wants you to come out
[26:36] from these denominational strongholds of
[26:41] spiritual darkness and come to the light
[26:44] and Christ will give you life now when
[26:48] he died spiritually we died spiritually
[26:50] we were identified with him and in him
[26:55] for we were in him and together we made
[26:59] up the fullness of the word for in the
[27:03] beginning John chapter 1 verse 1 was the
[27:05] word and the Word was with God and the
[27:10] Word was God
[27:12] now Jesus Christ Himself is the sum
[27:16] total of all of the word but the rest of
[27:20] the word was in him and so we were in
[27:25] him just as a man's life giving stream
[27:29] is in him
[27:31] God's germ of life was in him God's gene
[27:36] was in him God's attributes were in him
[27:41] and we see when he raised up that was
[27:45] his spiritual headship went to glory
[27:48] amen when he raised we raised
[27:52] spiritually so the head of the body went
[27:55] back into glory
[27:57] sent back the Holy Spirit to come back
[28:00] here and to quicken his spiritual body
[28:03] his life body amen
[28:06] that's the reason why he says in Luke 17
[28:10] 30 and 31 that as it was in the days of
[28:14] lot when in other words when you see the
[28:17] same conditions settlement conditions
[28:21] conditions of sin and darkness perils
[28:25] come upon you truth an era in disarray
[28:29] the entire thing era sits on the throne
[28:32] and the truth says by the wayside are
[28:36] begging for people to believe then in
[28:39] that day as it was in the days of lot so
[28:42] shall it be in the day of the when the
[28:46] Son of man shall be revealed let me put
[28:50] this word here revealed again for he was
[28:54] the son of man when he came the first
[28:56] time and now he becomes the son of man
[29:00] the word made flesh back there now the
[29:04] same word of God wants to come to a
[29:07] flesh live in us what in US and he is
[29:11] given the word but not in the form of
[29:15] one man in the headship but the body
[29:18] Ministry of Jesus Christ living walking
[29:22] talking ministering moving main Festing
[29:26] even truth his people for his glory and
[29:30] honoring their word honoring their life
[29:34] letting them be written epistles to be
[29:37] read of all men thanks Peter
[29:41] our gracious Heavenly Father and so now
[29:44] we see his quickly his spiritual body
[29:48] the true church calling out to his lost
[29:53] wife his rib to come right back and to
[29:57] take her stand by his side to return to
[30:01] her original position where she was
[30:05] standing in the word in the days of the
[30:08] Apostles and the stone stand firm and be
[30:13] able to say a mighty fortress is our God
[30:16] a bulwark never failing our helper he
[30:21] amid the flood amen in many men we thank
[30:25] God for His Never
[30:27] word for heavens and earth will pass
[30:29] away but God's Word is eternal if you're
[30:32] a part of that word war eternal for
[30:34] heavens alerts will pass away but my
[30:37] words shall never pass away thanks be to
[30:41] God

[33:51] you are not just somebody placed by the
[33:54] wayside but you're a better person than
[33:57] you think you are and God wants to have
[34:00] the right away and the preeminence
[34:02] within your heart and your life so that
[34:05] you bring you back to yourself to
[34:08] himself and that you might begin to know
[34:11] yourself of what God has in store for
[34:14] you and thank God that that seed of God
[34:19] that was buried in you that little piece
[34:23] of God that chip off of the old Rock of
[34:29] Ages that was in you before the
[34:34] foundation of the world that seed that
[34:36] was in there God now sends me the the
[34:41] Holy Spirit their water laughter and
[34:46] former rain to follow up on that scene
[34:49] that's in your heart
[34:52] to quicken the seed and to bring it to
[34:55] life
[34:55] Oh born again not by the will of man not
[35:00] by Seminary teaching doctrine of
[35:03] teaching from a Bible school a
[35:05] university though those things are good
[35:07] to know there Elementary's but talk of
[35:10] God taught by the Holy Spirit not to
[35:14] reject education not to reject any by
[35:18] the teaching but to recognize who you
[35:23] are and be able to discern the Lord's
[35:25] body of truth and to recognize what it
[35:28] is know what it is know what to take in
[35:32] and to filter out what you are to cast
[35:36] aside yes brothers and sisters born that
[35:40] can not by the will of man but we have
[35:42] born again by the revelation of God we
[35:46] are born again by the blood of God and
[35:48] we know that the life is in the blood o
[35:53] blessed be his name Oh glory to God so
[36:00] justification has made way for
[36:02] sanctification sanctification that's
[36:05] made wait what for Pentecost with the
[36:10] baptism of the Holy Spirit and now this
[36:13] is hard a Pentecostal doctrine and
[36:17] teaching of the initial evidence being
[36:21] speaking in tongues must now make way
[36:24] for the Holy Ghost himself we do not
[36:28] want just the towns we want the whole
[36:30] shoe we want the end carefulness of the
[36:35] Word of God now we see it clearly
[36:39] that this is where Pentecost failed they
[36:43] fail because they began to sink they
[36:47] were at the apex the pinnacle of all
[36:50] divine revelation and that God had
[36:53] stopped but I have news for you my
[36:56] brothers and sisters my wonderful
[36:59] Pentecostal
[37:01] brothers and sisters our God is marching
[37:04] on the pillar of fire never stopped it
[37:08] marched on until it was assured that
[37:11] their cross Jordan and were in the
[37:14] promised land and after that we do not
[37:17] read of its appearance until later on in
[37:21] the Bible to Paul and so on now we want
[37:24] touch on that but we understand clearly
[37:26] our God how smart stone and is marching
[37:31] on by his marvelous grace yes sir so we
[37:36] see friends clearly that they
[37:38] denominated and now modern-day Pentecost
[37:44] with it all it's miss placed doctrine
[37:52] misunderstanding God
[37:54] custom make way and is making way for
[37:58] the Spirit Himself justification made
[38:01] way for sanctification sanctification
[38:03] made way for the baptism of the holy
[38:06] spirit but the baptism of the Holy
[38:08] Spirit is not the end all it makes way
[38:11] for the Holy Spirit himself in other
[38:15] words before the Apostles came on the
[38:17] scene with the back to the Holy Spirit
[38:19] Jesus this scene of God was there on the
[38:24] earth and here made way for these
[38:30] marvelous outpouring he gave up because
[38:33] came back when the Apostles and now the
[38:38] seven churches began the Word of God
[38:43] began to go through its cycle and after
[38:47] it goes through its cycle then it has to
[38:50] go back to being seed again it has to go
[38:55] back to being seed again and it takes
[39:00] nectar not just to have the Baptist Holy
[39:03] Spirit but the purpose of Pentecost the
[39:07] real purpose of the Holy Spirit is the
[39:11] car
[39:11] and baptize to empower the that seed of
[39:16] life God's like that germ the little
[39:20] spot the gene that was in you to anoint
[39:23] the attribute that offspring of the
[39:26] Almighty God to spirit
[39:29] unless that and brings it to life just
[39:32] let me read a little poem that I love so
[39:36] much listen what it says here it's
[39:39] called a little plant in the heart of a
[39:43] seed buried deep so deep a tiny plant
[39:46] lay it fast asleep wake said the
[39:50] sunshine and creep to the light wake
[39:54] said the voice of the raindrops bright
[39:57] the little plant heard and it rose up to
[40:02] see what a wonderful outside world this
[40:07] would be
[40:08] I trust the little seed within your
[40:12] heart will wake up to recognize the Word
[40:15] of God for your day that you will wake
[40:19] up and come to the light come out of the
[40:23] grave of denominationalism formalism
[40:27] come out of traditions of man come out
[40:31] of weird wacky perverse and perverted
[40:35] message teaching back to the word back
[40:38] to the original faith back to what God
[40:41] is calling to you you took you have a
[40:43] witness within you the Holy Spirit took
[40:47] to vindicate the word and reveal to you
[40:50] whether you are hearing or knowing the
[40:52] truth or not amen amen amen
[40:56] in the beginning was the word and the
[40:58] Word was with God the Word was with God
[41:02] I believe I was in God and with God I
[41:06] believe is your election see you were
[41:08] with God and in God hallelujah and the
[41:12] Word was with God and the Word was made
[41:17] - that we say that that does not mean
[41:19] just made flesh in Jesus Christ 2,000
[41:23] years ago but the word was made flesh
[41:25] then and it's being made flesh in us now
[41:30] that seems new birth or not birth from
[41:36] your the seed of life in your virgin
[41:39] heart is now repeat rep reducing and new
[41:44] creation and new birth to manifest your
[41:48] heavenly father with all his glorious
[41:51] characteristics of the stature of a
[41:54] perfect man and to make him manifest to
[41:57] a world that is blind and walking in
[42:00] little decian darkness and to bring them
[42:02] to the perfect light man you wise men of
[42:06] today recognize the star that will lead
[42:10] you right to the perfect light there we
[42:13] were before the foundation of the world
[42:16] we were in God as the genes of God as
[42:21] Levi was in Abraham in type we were in
[42:25] God as the germs of God for the spoken
[42:29] word is the original seed the children
[42:33] of the offspring of God of children of
[42:37] the Almighty and offspring of the
[42:39] Almighty as the book of Acts calls us
[42:42] attributes of God or the seed gene the
[42:47] seed of God and so on and so on but when
[42:50] Jesus came to the earth we were in him
[42:54] and we were already a part of that word
[42:57] we were part of that word when he came
[43:01] here and we were all in him I said we
[43:05] were all in him because in himself says
[43:09] the scripture in Paul their thing is
[43:12] Ephesians that in him dwelleth the
[43:15] fullness of the Godhead bodily was in
[43:20] Christ the fullness of the Godhead
[43:22] bodily
[43:23] was in Christ all that with
[43:26] that wasn't God what poured into Jesus
[43:30] Christ and now what is happening that
[43:32] all that was in Christ oh is now by the
[43:37] Blessed Holy Spirit being poured down
[43:40] upon the Church of the Living God to
[43:43] wake her up to the rising of the Sun
[43:46] wake her up to the Sun shine bright and
[43:49] to recognize herself in the mirror of
[43:53] God's Word and rejoice with a hallelujah
[43:56] and a hosanna this it is he that cometh
[43:59] in the name of the Lord the white horse
[44:02] rider reigning right into your heart
[44:05] upon the perfect word of the hour that
[44:07] you might know who he is that he might
[44:10] come to your heart Lord Jesus conquer my
[44:13] heart today I surrender all Lord take my
[44:16] life and let it be Oh God let it be Lord
[44:20] Jesus or spirit of Almighty God take us
[44:23] here today so here we are and when he
[44:26] came to earth we see in him yes the
[44:29] fullness of the Godhead bodily praise

[45:10] promise that God promised to fulfill and
[45:14] bring to pass and God will not just
