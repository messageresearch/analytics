TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] once again good evening friends it's good to be here with you again i would like to touch on this lesson and using for this part of this church age the topic of your heavenly father knows your heavenly father knows and i would like to touch on that but before we do shall we read out of the scriptures revelation chapter 2 verse 9 i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but the word rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are of the synagogue of satan let us pray our gracious heavenly father we thank thee for the reading of the word we thank you for all these gathered around waiting to receive the anointed word of god for the hour may the great holy spirit take these words and place them in the hearts of your own deposit these truths oh god take glory and honor and my may your name be magnified and glorified for we ask it in the name of jesus christ our lord amen yes friends the scripture clearly says i know thy works and thy tribulation and poverty but thou art rich truly there is a a thinking a form of thinking of many people that if they are when they become a christian their troubles and their great joys begin but i'm here to tell you that friends when you are born again or really received the holy ghost that is when another form of troubles begin your spiritual troubles begin and that comes into your natural life also where troubles trials tribulations temptations they increase because now that you recognize that you are a child of the king of god satan then places you as a target you were not maybe a direct target before but now you have become one of his targets now we are speaking on the church age of smyrna continuing and the key to this age is tribulation to recognize that all christians will suffer some form of tribulation for if there was tribulation in the first age it intensifies in the second age and tribulation continues on true and its application is to every christian every church age and every believer that puts their trust in god and identifies themselves with christ they will bear the same persecutions as he himself bore listen hebrews chapter 10 verses 32 to 38. we have these words from paul that applies to us the mass of christians believers through all the ages but call to remembrance the former days in which listen after that you were illuminated after that you had received revelation after that your eyes were opened after that your ears began to recognize the voice of the spirit of god speaking to you and opening up the book of life uh to you you endured a great fight of afflictions paul is saying after the word is revealed to you you're going to have to fight these trials and these tribulations these testings and provings that satan is going to bring against you partly which also you are made a gazing stock uh both by reproaches and afflictions you see you become a real true genuine believer that recognizes who you are recognizes your position and when satan knows that you really do know who you are who your father is where you come from oh and where you're going back to your rightful position then satan opens up and throws all of his guns against you and makes you into a target and makes you into a mocking stock laughing stock maybe of your own family your own friends that once just loved you adored you and uh you know uh appreciated you and now you have become a mocking stock you have become a laughing stuck in their eyes and when you are not around you are just a butt of jokes they make fun of you and everything else but it's not really must recognize this to ease the pain on you recognize that it's not really you as a person but it's the same old devil that's coming against the christ that is in you for jesus christ lives in you and satan still goes against him and it's really him in you that satan is criticizing him in every possible way praise god but we are encouraged by the lord for many become discouraged year after year month after month week after week a constant dripping and drabbing of of tribulation and trial upon their lives and then they may not take it any longer like some of the israelites they became come weary of the journey and then they began to faint uh or fade away by the sight of the way no but god encourages us and says to us all child of mine cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward don't cast away your confidence don't cast away your lifeline don't cast away your hopes because listen great rewards await you there is great recompense for what you are passing through now and many of us may be going through some trials right now while i'm yet speaking trials going through bitter problems bitter uh temptations bitter trials that you are passing through right now at this very time listen for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now that just shall lift the just shall live by faith that just shall live by revelation but if any man draw back my soul shall not have pleasure in him oh my god looks and looks at the backslider god looks at the one that walks away from the word of god and says my soul shall have no pleasure in him o praise god hallelujah let us also remember all those that will associate with us because my friends just to associate with us just to show us kindness many of those will suffer also trial and tribulation and and this is why we must be sympathetic and understand why some will stay away from us keep away from us because they can sense and see some of the trials tribulations that you're going through seems to come off on them and and they don't want it or they don't have the backbone and spine they don't have the anchor of the word of god in them to hold them and so they get away from it to free themselves from that kind of a trials it is the lord god almighty who is speaking he is the great spirit of life who is speaking he says i know the almighty the all-knowing one the omnipotent the all-seeing one he says i know here he is walking up and down in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks type of the seven church ages here he is the great shepherd of the sheepfold walking up and down oh praise god looking in love and in care for his people and the question is asked why does he not hold back the tribulation and persecution why does he not stop our trials and troubles that we go true my friends but the fact is no he does not he simply says i know your tribulation the true believer listening that and hearing recognizing the tones of the voice of the spirit in that kid recognizes love and his watchful care he is saying i am not unmindful of your suffering now you know many will ask the question with this sickness with this affliction with this need with this trial with this kind of poverty and pressure that i am going through why doesn't god do something or if a loved one passes on a loved one my friend succumbs uh to the spirit of death why did god take my brother why did god take my father why did god do this why did god do that and the question is always asked why did god amen and this my friends is a great stumbling block to very many people who claim to be believers and christians for the first thing that comes to their mind is why did god do this not with not why did satan test me why did satan try me why did satan tempt me but their their thought goes to why did god every tragedy in the world every hurricane every earthquake mankind is quickly to ask and say oh it was an act of god they don't stop to think which god the god almighty or the god of this evil age satan who sends these things and works behind them upon the face of the earth now recognize clearly that god in the shadows looks upon you and i and he watches over his own you say he watches but i'm going through pressure i'm going through trial i'm going tribulation i'm getting all these chests and yet god stands in the shadows and he watches over his own malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord yet you ask you say wherein hast thou loved us was not esau jacob's brother said the lord yet i loved jacob and hated esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see we as human beings can't figure out god's love for here is one brother looking like a caring loving uh gentleman a hard worker and here is the other brothers apparently looks like a renegade a trickster uh you know a mother's boy a poor boy and yet god says i love that renegade i love that unruly one and this one that looks like a polished up christian looks like a a real gentleman looks so filial looks so uh you know fatherly and loves his father and cared for his father he says i hit that one and you see we cannot figure out god's love you see because we human beings thinks that love means no suffering love means no denial no trial not troubles and constant deliverance and constant miracles all the time this is what we have been brought to believe not recognizing that god's love is a different love my friends amen for we know that god's love is an elective love his love is shown to you not by the things he gives you but that the fact that he elected you to be in the beloved to be amongst the little flock to be part of that few to whom he is coming back to and for to take away with him to his father's house so god's love is an elective love the proof of his love to you is that he has elected you to eternal life life eternal endless life forever and ever and ever and ever into all the aeons all the ages and ages that endlessly roll on my friends will we not suffer one moment to have an eternity of endless life this is the love of god made manifest so no matter what happens to us in this life no matter what trials we go through in this life what is a hundred years to endless eternal life what is what is our short brief a time upon the earth uh in relation to having life eternal and to eat from that great tree of life and drink from the river of life and eat the fruits from the tree and give glory and praise to god knowing that he has called us and elected us to this love and gifted us with the gift of eternal life through jesus christ our lord chosen predestinated unto salvation because god has chosen us to salvation and sanctification of the holy spirit by the believing of the truth thank god praise god and within that that kind of view and vision if you can recognize it then he is sovereign he is our lord and he can commit us and command us to walk right into the fires of death he can anoint us to walk right in to the roman forums walk into the very mouth of the lion's mouth or into a fiery furnace he can lead us that way by his holy spirit and the true believer oh yes they know within their hearts that even though they are passing through they may go through these things that this is god showing his confidence in us this is god expressing his love to us that he trusts us that no matter what we go through like job we will not curse him we will not walk away from the truth we will not deny his word we will not do these things but we will bear the reproach for the world and never be ashamed of him and stand upon the promises until the crown regain hallelujah amen he might commit us to death like paul he may commit us to suffer like job and friends all these things for is for him to use fine people that he can trust and that he can use to show to the entire world here there is a son a daughter of god here is a child of god amen and you become the testimony of jesus christ while these ones are looking on you are singing you are singing songs in the night as the psalmist says he giveth me songs in the night yes you may be going through night time you may have to pass through leo this year but while you're going through the darkness of night you give it you songs in the night for the things he reveals to you and makes known to you causes you to sing as you're going along god wants this world to recognize they are without excuse for here are a few selected elected that can still live godly in the midst of sodomite conditions in the midst of babylon they can live godly o praise god forevermore he is showing forth his might he is showing forth his power he is showing forth his life he is showing forth their power to overcome in the midst of the most uh worst tribulation trial circumstances that the devil can throw against you and yet you can say i am an overcomer yet you can say i am a child of the king yet you can say i am more than a conqueror through him that love me praise god forevermore we can say when we appear weak in the midst of trial then we are strong with the strength and the grace of the living god oh hallelujah praise god amen friends it is god's right and sovereign as the sovereign one to permit us or allow us to pass through various situations because it's all to fulfill his redemptive purposes amen or praise god or god is not an author of frustration frustration and chaos amen but he's a god of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while instead of the fire bending us instead of the burdens breaking us he uses the fires the trials the temptations the tribulations and these burdens my friends to shape us and refine us in the refining fires as job has said when he saw himself being tried and suffering he says after that i he has tried me i i will come forth as gold in other words he would be refined he would come to his divine holy ghost perfection and god allows us to go through these things to try us to prove us that we may come into a state of perfection and endless grace god uses this to establish us upon his word because as you know when the wild winds blow the winds of the stormy winds blow against the oak tree it'll bend but not break the christian trials may come against him they may bend they'll be being knocked down to their knees but they'll stand and rise and try again they'll bend but not break oh praise god they will not bow they will not bend or praise god they'll stand upon the word of god and the promises until the crown they gain for his glory amen and amen so trails come to establish you like the oak tree the storms come and it bends it sways but then it lets its roots go deeper deeper deeper when the next storm comes the roots are deep enough and it rocks it it shakes its loosen the soils around the roots goes down deeper so god allows these things to strengthen us and establish us in his word amen so that as a song that the scripture says so that you after a while you may be settled we are settled upon the rock of ages where we are we become immovable like god is immovable our beliefs our moors the things we see the principles the guidelines the instructions out of the word of god and the things he has revealed to us just causes us to settle down upon the word and we anchored there and said i've anchored in jesus the storms of life i'll brave i've anchored in jesus for he has the power to save oh thanks be to god hallelujah that we have that settlement that soundness and we are firmly entrenched and firmly anchored in and upon the rock of ages job said he puts strength in us job chapter 23 verse 6. you see he strings us and he knows and why does he know because he has experienced suffering he has suffered more than anyone else ever did in the entire world he has suffered for us and out of his ex his experiential position says to us i know why because he passed through that and more he says i know and he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and was actually made perfect by the things he suffered hebrews chapter 5 verses 8-9 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of salvation unto all them that obey him hallelujah oh praise god in other words the scripture is saying the very character of christ was perfected by suffering suffering was the hammer suffering was the was a hammer that placed him on the anvil and continued to hammer away at him until he became a perfect shining gold piece for his for god's honor amen and so will we praise god hallelujah and so god has ordained the measure of suffering for his church praise god and so that by their faith in his word they will come to a place of perfect faith perfect revelation perfect realization true perfect revelation amen and amen hallelujah amen now why did god do this why did he allow this job james chapter 1 verses 2 to 4 tells us clearly in the word my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations oh my god think upon that i would spend time on that but think on the word telling you count it all joy when you fall into different forms and kinds of temptations this that the trying of your faith the stretching of your faith the the the trying of your faith the stretching of it amen hallelujah all my work and patience but let patience have its perfect work that you may be perfect and entire or complete one wanting nothing praise god like satan the bible tells us in the gospels that satan came to jesus and tried him and found nothing there was nothing therefore he was a lamb without spot and without blemish even when he was on the cross he said father forgive them for they know not what they do the love of god flowing out from him and through him the virtues and life of the light of the living god flowing from him he was perfection of perfection for he was the perfect one the lily of the valley the bright and morning star the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world oh glory to god hallelujah amen but why does god stand by why does he stand by in the shadows some of us may think he's not there it seems as if god is not on the scene but yes he is for he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you but i'll be with you to the very end of the age the answer is found in romans 8 17 and 18 and if or let me use the word but if your children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that you may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us hallelujah so friends we don't run the race we can win no prize if you don't suffer how are you going to reign oh praise god so the reason for this is to develop and grow and perfecting us character for character is never made formed or shaped without suffering amen for character is a victory it is not a gift but it's a victory to have genuine true character a man or woman or a young person without character cannot reign cannot overcome cannot have the victory cannot reign over the kingdom of darkness and in the kingdom of light because power the uses of power without having appropriate character to it is absolutely demonic it is satanic and evil when power is in the hands of someone who does not have the character to be able to control the uses of and flow of that power through their lives power then power in a person with character is fit to rule god uses one who can use and control that power by the character that is within them then they are fit to rule oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah since god wants us to share his throne with him we must be tested to see how we will administrate that kind of a position that we will be sitting in hallelujah amen he overcame and is set down in the father's throne and so must we overcome and set down in his throne hallelujah oh praise god friends the little temporary suffering is nothing in part with what the glory of god that shall be shining and revealed in us when he comes for us and we come to the end of the way the great holy spirit of the living god flowing through your life oh my god friends nothing is to be compared with it let us surrender ourselves let us reconsecrate ourselves let us bow down before him and worship him and present ourselves living sacrifices for his glory and for his honor praise be to god hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise god amen there is treasures waiting us my friends as we say beyond the blue after this tribulation we are going to enjoy the great treasures of the living god within our heart and within our lives think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that they are to try you amen oh praise god god tries us and develops christ-like character through us and by suffering or praise god if we are true children of god we will be tried and chastened for a father that loves his children will chasten them despite what dr spock says despite what the world says a true mother or father that loves their children will put stops guidelines and chasten them as it wills as they will according to the word of god not abuse them but chasten them and try them hallelujah here it is friends that church at church that is not suffering and has not really been tried is not truly of god for hebrews 12 6 for whom the lord love it he chastened it and scored yet every son daughter whom you receive it for if you will be without chastisement whereof are you partakers then are you bastards and not sons of the living god oh my we don't want to claim we are born again but instead we are bastard born to the real true revealed word of the living god hallelujah amen my friends there's no age free from this what was in the age of smorn smyrna may be applied to every other age praise god this is of god this is from god this is the will of god and it is needful within our hearts and lives we need the lord to teach us and guide us into this truth that we are to suffer and be like christ or be christ-like for love suffereth long and is still kind hallelujah matthew 5 11-12 blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall see all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake o rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you and they persecuted him and if they persecuted me he said will they not persecute you if they mistreated him will they not mistreat you but stand firm to the word of the living god yes friends cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of god's lack of love or god's disapproval upon us neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval hallelujah his approval is his election of you to be in the beloved his beloved his bride that is the love of god all the other things come to pass but that is unless eternal life within your soul god's love is elective love from before the foundation of the world does he love us yes he does how do we know we know it because he says so amen we know it because he has manifested his love to us by bringing us unto himself oh praise god think upon that oh hallelujah and he has given us his spirit and placed us as his sons and daughters part of the bride which came from his side oh glory to god hallelujah amen how shall i prove my love to him how shall we prove our love to him by believing his word by believing what he has said to us and accept the promises that he has given to us and by conducting ourselves with joy amidst the trials for we are not looking at today we are looking way into tomorrow hallelujah and his wisdom his grace his faith allows us to bear the brunt of satan's death trials and all the tribulation he brings against us for god will bring us right through and bring us to pass yes i know thy poverty but thou art rich as he walks up and down and misses church like a father like the head of a household like a provider a protector he looks on us and our needs and our property oh they they they're untutored untaught doesn't understand the believer young doesn't believe understand they stumble at this truth why did god do this why did god do that not recognizes recognizing that the fullness of god's love is revealed to us in his election of us into that part of his masterpiece bride for this last day oh glory to god hallelujah oh my yes sir we believe in the love of god in the goodness of god and in the wisdom of god and we take no thought for tomorrow hallelujah of what we shall lead to what we shall drink or what we shall put on for we know our heavenly father is watching over us and our father knows our heavenly father knows that we have need of all these things hallelujah and he will take care of us the people of god the are not materially minded but they are christ-minded they don't do not seek the treasures of this world it may come their way they may be blessed in that way but they do not make it their life's ambition their life's pulsation oh praise god they are not materially minded hallelujah they seek the things above it is absolutely true that most christians are not wealthy a mainly poor as it was in the days of the lord jesus and so it wasn't paul's day even paul himself the apostle had one quote and it's even true today we see peter and john at the beautiful gate they were not rich they were poor they were not uh rich as rome is rich as as as these different headquarters are rich and or increase with goods but peter said to the beggar of the beautiful gate he said silver and gold we have none in other words we have poor penniless preachers but such as we have we give to you rise take up your bed and walk in the name of jesus christ they have the coins of god's kingdom the power of the holy spirit flowing through their lives and that's what they gave to him rise take up thy bed and walk hallelujah or praise god oh my oh friends but in this live decien age in which we live we find this one a vast wealth where often their criteria for true spirituality is how much money you have how much wealth you can display how much you earn what position of power influence that you have in this way in this world and there's much preaching about the prosperity gospel that is in the world today the abundance of earthly goods that we have seems to give people credibility and gives them status in the present day society but not in the eyes and mind of god god says to the true believer you may appear poor but really you are rich why they are rich in the things of god and their reward comes beyond the veil hallelujah oh praise god my friends the kingdom of god is not meat and drink amen hallelujah it is not really material it is within us a rich man is rich in god not in worldly things or praise god hallelujah so the spirit is crying out to the people hold on hold on because i'm seeing and i know your poverty i see your needs you haven't very much if anything to post off what the what the little you have has been even taken away from you and you even gladly give up your possessions in exchange for the eternal ones you are laughed at your scorn your mock you are made fun of in every way you don't have the material resources to fall back on but you are rich in spite of all that you are rich in spite of all that for you your security your eternal security lies in him praise god our security is in christ amen hallelujah he is our shield he is our fortress he has a rock of ages oh praise get god his kingdom our kingdom is yet to come and to be revealed to them and it will come and it will be an everlasting and eternal kingdom of the living god so he says i'm mindful of your trials i am mindful of your woes i know how hard it is for you to get on with your life oh my hallelujah and i will remember all of this when i come to claim my own and then i will remar reward you now what i'm preaching here as i'm about to conclude this is not against rich people or those who are rich for god may make some rich allow some to be rich for he says i give the power to get wealth you may be smart and think you got it yourself but as god had to enable you and empower you to be able to get it now what are you going to use it for what are you going to do with it he empowers some because he knows what he wants to use them to do with it not only to benefit themselves but to benefit bless extend expand his kingdom for his glory and for his honor some of god's people are rich amen but they've got to watch both sides of it money can become a snare it can make one arrogant make one proud make one feel self-sufficient and they lose their dependency on god and begin to depend upon their treasures instead of depending upon their lord his protection his guidance his blessing and everything upon them hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah and then there are some that are poor and and meaner and more despicable than those that are wealthy hallelujah way back in the first church age james cried out that we are not to put stock in wealthy people i see people who are believers and they uh you have to be a rich minister before you have credibility you have to be a rich preacher with a big huge church and large congregation before you have people's confidence oh brother soon sorry he made a lot of money when he wasn't even a believer so i'm going to believe him oh brother sunset built a church that can seat so many so i'm going to trust confidence and he must know what he's doing it's not based on those things it's based on the word of god and the revelation of the word of god god bless those brothers by the way unless you you you think my thinking is in a wrong area it is not god bless all those who are in that position they must know their position in christ and i must recognize mine in christ god places trees on every state some on the top of the mountain some midway some down some further down some down in the valley and we must recognize way and bloom where we are planted and be used of god where god wants to use you and be satisfied with that and let god use you wherever you are hallelujah amen let us not have respect of persons and elevating raising people up to uh positions of power and dignity and credibility just because of their earthly and worldly success and become believers trying to butter up to other ones that may be well off and wealthy giving them your allegiance based on their position oh god help every one of us here today you bother up to them because you want some help you want them to use their influence on your behalf for some thing like that rather than trusting in the living god amen i know a lot of brothers have become annoyed with me because i'm just a plain talker and i'll say no brother i i don't need that or i don't need to depend on this i don't need you or anything of that nature nothing against their brother sister or whoever they are but i'm making sure i make it clear my dependency is upon god and god alone whether i'm rich or whether i'm in rags my faith rests upon him and his word and his word alone amen oh my friends jobs james says don't do it for money isn't everything money isn't the answer christ is the answer to all our longings christ is the answer to all our needs amen so friends in this age we have more wealth than we ever had and yet less is being accomplished for the kingdom of god spiritually it is not money that god wants that works for him and his kingdom it is an obedient humble hearts surrendered life consecrated to him and him alone he moves by his spirit and the moving of god's spirit in a church in a life comes by surrendering it all consecrated lies that are consecrated to the word of god alone may god bless you may god keep you may god take these words anchor them into your hearts until we meet again may the great holy spirit be with you and watch between us until we meet again our next service will be on sunday in the house of the lord as we bring the word of god and may the holy spirit rain down supernatural manner for us that we may eat and be filled and never hunger water from the ever-present rock in the ever-present water from that rock that we may never thirst again god bless you my [Music] friends [Music] you
