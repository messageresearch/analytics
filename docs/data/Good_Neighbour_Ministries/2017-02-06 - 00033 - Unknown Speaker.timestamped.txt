[0:00] to continue living their life the way
[0:02] that they were living it when true
[0:04] change comes when the spirit of God
[0:06] comes it changes the individual amen
[0:09] next slide Romans 5:12 he says wherefore
[0:13] as by one man sin entered into the world
[0:15] and death by sin and so death passed
[0:18] upon all men for
[0:21] that now because I've got the slide
[0:25] wrong I I'm I'm missing certain words
[0:27] here but anyways for for If by one man's
[0:31] offense verse 17 death reigned by one
[0:34] much more they which receive abundance
[0:36] of Grace and of the gift of
[0:39] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[0:43] Jesus
[0:44] Christ he's the only way he's the only
[0:49] you know the Muslims today and all these
[0:51] different denominational teachings all
[0:53] we believe God you know I even talk to
[0:55] Muslims oh we believe
[0:57] Jesus we believe Jesus was a prophet oh
[1:00] he was a good man yeah but they don't
[1:03] believe him to be their Savior and
[1:05] that's why they're going into
[1:07] tribulation is that simple I can't
[1:09] change that's the word of God there's
[1:11] only one way there's only one name that
[1:14] man must be saved by and that is through
[1:17] the name of
[1:18] Jesus Hallelujah being born again we've
[1:22] been delivered from sin and
[1:26] trespasses in sin we were con
[1:30] deceived we were born in sin shaped in
[1:33] iniquity but the Holy Spirit once he
[1:36] comes and you receive the new birth it
[1:38] washes it all away amen it wipes out it
[1:42] it places you into the body of Jesus
[1:44] Christ and that is what is going to be
[1:46] quickened from this Dimension amen next
[1:50] slide in 1 Corinthians 15 verse 45 and
[1:55] so it is written the first
[1:58] man
[2:01] was made a living
[2:03] Soul the last adom was made a quickening
[2:09] spirit so if the same spirit that raised
[2:12] Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll
[2:15] Quicken you amen it'll Quicken your
[2:18] mortal body it'll translate you from
[2:20] this Dimension amen that's why he said
[2:24] to Daniel he says seal up the book John
[2:29] seal up those things because the perfect
[2:32] word was now going to be revealed but
[2:34] not just yet there was going to be a
[2:37] season when Jesus Christ was going to
[2:39] reveal his word whereby you would
[2:41] receive the quickening power amen you
[2:44] would receive the rapturing faith that
[2:46] you need to go in a Rapture that's why a
[2:48] lot of people say why I got to go to
[2:49] your church to be in the Rapture no you
[2:51] don't have to go to my church you need
[2:53] to be born again and you need to be
[2:54] filled with the spirit you need to
[2:56] recognize Malachi 4 you need to
[2:57] recognize Revelations 10:7 we need to
[3:00] know that the mighty Angel is here right
[3:01] now in fivefold ministry that's
[3:03] translating perfecting and preparing a
[3:06] bride to go and meet with the bride
[3:08] grp boy that was a about full he's going
[3:10] to say wo where did you come from I came
[3:13] from Glory you want to come with me
[3:16] you're going to need to see what I'm
[3:17] seeing but I can't give it to you the
[3:19] Holy Spirit has to give it to you
[3:21] Hallelujah the Holy Spirit has to open
[3:23] your understanding glory to God he said
[3:26] seal up those things but in the days of
[3:28] the voice of that seventh angel let them
[3:31] know in part until that time
[3:35] comes that which is perfect has
[3:39] come
[3:41] because it's time it's time to go it's
[3:46] time to leave this place amen because
[3:50] let them know in part until that time
[3:52] comes and now the mighty Angel himself
[3:55] the chief Shepherd he's coming amen and
[4:00] I know my sheep and I'm going to call my
[4:02] sheep by their names and you wonder well
[4:05] how it is how is it that my name's being
[4:07] called is because you have the ability
[4:09] to say Amen to what I'm saying here this
[4:11] morning if you've got the ability to say
[4:14] Amen to the word of God and you're
[4:15] seeing this word you're knowing that the
[4:18] next slide says that you've had the new
[4:22] birth and you're being known as you are
[4:25] known amen that's right you're actually
[4:27] coming to a place knowing as I am know 2
[4:31] Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be
[4:34] in Christ he is what a new creation new
[4:38] creature old things are passed away
[4:41] behold all things have become new and
[4:44] all things are of God who ha reconciled
[4:47] us to himself remember he's redeeming

[6:13] upset and I turn I said listen to
[6:15] me I said that's enough I don't want to
[6:18] hear it anymore if God wants me he'll
[6:21] come and call me himself
[6:26] understand Hallelujah it wasn't maybe a
[6:30] year
[6:30] later I was weeping and crying in the
[6:33] presence of the Lord I couldn't
[6:35] understand it why because it's his time
[6:38] Hallelujah we are called under the
[6:41] ministry of reconciliation God has given
[6:44] us that Ministry realize that our lives
[6:46] are an example The Way We Walk the way
[6:49] we talk because that which is perfect
[6:52] has come so what are you reflecting what
[6:55] is you what do you see in the mirror are
[6:57] you looking at something unperfect
[6:59] something
[7:00] you know confused what are you looking
[7:02] at what are you believing do you believe
[7:05] that God can do what he says he can do
[7:07] regardless of the circumstances in your
[7:10] life because this is the hour where the
[7:12] Supernatural is going to show this bride
[7:15] she's going to have a mystery oh yeah
[7:17] it's going to be Supernatural it's
[7:19] happening already but it's going to move
[7:21] into such a real just before we leave
[7:23] this place there's going to be a public
[7:24] display of some Supernatural word being
[7:28] spoken and things happening and people
[7:30] seeing things signs and wonders like
[7:33] they've never seen
[7:34] before Hallelujah so you got to either
[7:37] believe that it's possible believe that
[7:39] it's the season or you're just going to
[7:41] be miserable I'm telling you right now
[7:45] you continue in your arguments you'll
[7:47] continue in your disbelief you'll look
[7:49] at your brother your sister you'll look
[7:52] at their flesh you'll see their flaws
[7:54] and you'll get all upset and you'll get
[7:56] all you know you get all confused and
[7:58] angry and everything everything else
[8:00] just goes to show that you haven't died
[8:03] that's right am amen that's
[8:06] all when you got to have the last word
[8:09] and you got to be the one well I I said
[8:12] it this way I said
[8:15] that shut up be the last don't don't say
[8:19] a
[8:20] word when that person says something to
[8:23] you and you don't like
[8:26] it shut up amen say Lord help him Lord
[8:31] help him you intervene father you
[8:35] believe you can do that the reason he
[8:38] doesn't do it is because you always want
[8:39] to do it he looks at you say shut
[8:45] up why you got to why you got to say
[8:47] that why you got to why why you got to
[8:49] have the last
[8:51] word you got to die to
[8:54] yourself and then the supernatural comes
[8:56] over when when love projects in into
[8:59] that situation I don't care how ugly it
[9:01] gets sometimes you got to get down on
[9:03] your knees and you got to project love
[9:05] into that situation say oh God please
[9:07] help me this sinful flesh this carnal
[9:11] mind that that possesses my thoughts at
[9:13] times Lord oh this enemy that constantly
[9:15] wants to keep me in this bondage Lord
[9:18] let me be released from this unbelief
[9:21] and set my brother my sister free my
[9:23] mother my brother my wife my husband my
[9:25] son my daughter Lord let the grace of
[9:28] God come what I'm saying they're not

[9:38] how you did it it just happened Lord and
[9:40] you can do it I know you can do it you
[9:42] did it for me you can do it for them you
[9:45] believe
[9:45] that you got to get to that place you
[9:49] got to believe in that in that kind of
[9:51] way because God wants to deliver God
[9:53] wants you to have all that you desire
[9:57] and all that is yours according to the
[9:59] New
[10:00] Birth everything that God put into that
[10:02] attribute is yours whether you want it
[10:04] or not you just got to die out so you
[10:07] can receive it Hallelujah he goes he

[23:05] you just say a
[23:07] dollar now I'm I'm kind of like
[23:09] overemphasizing bit exaggerating a
[23:11] little bit here but he got
[23:13] excited he seen 10 ice cream PS he said
[23:18] oh my goodness author
[23:23] [Music]

[23:50] [Music]
[23:51] $500 who turned around and he sold it
[23:54] for maybe a
[23:56] th brother br says in one of the quotes
[23:59] he says I think I heard something that
[24:00] made me around A4 million dollar for
[24:03] that
[24:04] stamp you see he was thinking like a
[24:09] child we think like children sometimes
[24:12] we don't think the way we should be
[24:14] thinking because when we were a child we
[24:18] spoke like a child we thought like a
[24:20] child we acted like a child but that
[24:23] which is perfect has come and now we are
[24:27] not children anymore more and we need to
[24:30] get zealous about something that God has
[24:32] given us that is greater than anything
[24:36] that this world could possibly offer I
[24:39] think about it sometimes Hallelujah sit
[24:40] there you know you you can sit there and
[24:42] you you can day dream and you think
[24:44] about man should buy a lottery ticket
[24:46] $50
[24:47] million I could you know man and then
[24:50] all of a sudden the thought say yeah
[24:51] would you trade that
[24:53] for that one Revelation I gave 22 years
[24:56] ago are you
[24:58] [Music]
[25:03] not even $50 billion
[25:08] Saints what in the world could possibly
[25:11] give you what God is for Paul said eyes
[25:14] have not seen ears have not heard we get
[25:18] so childish at times we get so childish
[25:21] in our ways we get so silly in our
[25:24] thinking we think like little children
[25:26] just like that little boy he has he had
[25:29] maybe A4 million dollars in his hand but
[25:31] he was a child he was thinking as a
[25:33] child he was looking at things like a
[25:35] child sometimes you look at things the
[25:37] wrong
[25:38] way you're not looking at things the
[25:40] right way you're looking in that mirror
[25:42] you're not seeing
[25:45] right next
[25:47] slide now what do you see in the
[25:51] mirror do you see yourself as a part of
[25:54] God's plan God's will God's God's bride
[25:57] God's even eled that you've been called
[26:00] and you've been chosen one in a million
[26:02] brother B says I don't know about you I
[26:04] talked to a thousand people a year
[26:07] maybe maybe one or two will listen for a
[26:10] little while maybe the odd one will come
[26:12] into church and hang out for a little
[26:14] while get delivered from this get
[26:16] delivered from that I've seen people
[26:17] come in one guy you you know Frank come
[26:20] in here he got delivered from crack
[26:22] cocaine he was he was a cocaine act God
[26:24] delivered him to this day he's on the
[26:26] streets preaching Jesus praise God God
[26:29] bless him that's
[26:31] good but that don't Place everybody into
[26:35] this which is perfect amen that which is
[26:38] perfect has come amen and we're thinking
[26:41] like little children but we need to see
[26:44] what's really happening here let the
[26:47] musicians
[26:48] come we need to realize the hour what
[26:51] God has given us in this day and in this
[26:54] hour how precious is that Pearl that
[26:58] curl of great price or are we going to
[27:01] go for ice
[27:02] cream which one is it going to
[27:06] be next
[27:09] slide I see who I
[27:15] am Revelations 22:17 and the spirit and
[27:19] the bride say
[27:21] come that's who we are that's what we
[27:25] have that's the ministry that God has
[27:27] given us
[27:28] that's the Revelation that we're living
[27:30] under we are and have been given the
[27:33] ministry of
[27:35] reconciliation we need to be living this
[27:37] word we need to be testifying this word
[27:41] we need to let people know we need to be
[27:43] Evangelical this year in our thinking we
[27:45] need to find that last one because when
[27:48] the last one comes in we go it's that
[27:51] simple so dare to be different dare to
[27:55] be Evangelical this year dare to reach
[27:58] the lost and whatever cost share a
[28:00] testimony share a track share do
[28:04] something because that which is perfect
[28:07] has come and that which is in part must
[28:11] be put away amen God bless you Saints
[28:15] let's sing that
[28:17] song who I
[28:20] am
