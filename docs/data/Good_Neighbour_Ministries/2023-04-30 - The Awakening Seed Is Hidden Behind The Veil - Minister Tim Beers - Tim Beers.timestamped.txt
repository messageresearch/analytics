[6:42] and give thanks at the remembrance of
[6:45] his holiness

[7:02] never be moved Lord by thy favor thou
[7:07] has made my mountains to stand strong

[7:13] troubled I cried to thee O Lord and unto
[7:17] the Lord I made supplication what
[7:19] prophet is there in my blood when I go
[7:23] down to the pit shall the dust praise
[7:26] thee shall it declare thy truth
[7:29] hear O Lord and have mercy upon me Lord
[7:33] be thou my helper thou Hast turned for

[45:21] this is a marvelous and wonderful
[45:24] spiritual responsible
[45:27] every man and every woman has a capacity
[45:30] to bring forth a child as God has said
[45:34] we are to multiply we are to reproduce
[45:36] ourselves and as
[45:39] that has become so commonplace that
[45:43] people don't see the sacredness in it
[45:47] that God allows you
[45:49] can be a vessel to bring forth another
[45:51] life
[45:53] and it's a it's it's a natural but
[45:57] Supernatural because him the life that
[46:01] lives in this body though it's he's a
[46:04] child right now yeah you won't know that
[46:07] person until they begin to fully Express
[46:09] them
[46:11] right so God is saying to take
[46:15] responsibility for protection provision
[46:18] training uh guidance and everything of
[46:23] that nature until he comes to the age of
[46:26] accountability
[46:28] when he can understand for himself and
[46:31] begin to chart his own life's path
[46:35] but our responsibility that's given to
[46:38] us by God all parents regardless of who
[46:40] they are religion they are God gives
[46:43] that responsibility to every parent that
[46:46] that must be done and I'm sure your bear
[46:49] did that I know that praise the Lord so
[46:52] here we are today with this wonderful
[46:55] young man I can see a very healthy
[46:59] beautiful spirit on him and I pray that
[47:02] God will raise him up and bring him into
[47:05] His Marvelous Grace and knowledge amen
[47:09] how wonderful that is our prayer of
[47:12] dedication and pray God's blessing on
[47:15] him it's a wonderful thing to start the
[47:18] life
[47:19] millions of children out there and the
[47:22] parents have no time to at least let
[47:25] them have a start with God's blessing
[47:28] upon them if they divert from the
[47:31] pathway that will be their
[47:34] responsibility but they were introduced
[47:38] even now later on you can tell them you
[47:42] were prayed over you were dedicated in
[47:45] the house of God and that will always
[47:47] stay with them and the angels of God
[47:50] will watch over them protect them in all
[47:52] situations right praise God so let us
[47:57] pray

[57:19] Hebrews 10 7.
[57:21] we got along first one is a little long
[57:23] scripture reading here
[57:25] and then we're going to go to Matthew 27
[57:27] 50.
[57:29] Hallelujah I mean there's thousands of
[57:31] messages right in here on these two
[57:34] scriptures right here
[57:37] then said I lo I come in the volume of
[57:42] the book it is written of me to do thy
[57:46] will o God
[57:47] above when he said sacrifices and
[57:51] offerings and burnt offerings and
[57:53] offerings for sin
[57:55] thou wouldest not neither had his
[57:58] pleasure therein which are offerings by
[58:01] the law
[58:03] then said he lo I come to do thy will o
[58:07] God
[58:08] he taketh away the first that he may
[58:12] establish the second
[58:14] by the witch we
[58:19] are Sanctified through the offering of
[58:22] the blood of Jesus Christ once for all
[58:26] and every priest stand at Daily
[58:28] ministering and offering often times the
[58:31] same sacrifice
[58:34] which can never take away sin
[58:37] but this man after he had offered one
[58:41] sacrifice for sin forever sat down at
[58:45] the right hand of God which is the power
[58:47] of God Amen
[58:50] from henceforth expect until his enemies
[58:54] be made his footstool
[58:56] so his enemies are going to be made his
[58:59] footstool
[59:00] there is great victory that he is
[59:02] expecting
[59:04] you might not be expecting great Victory
[59:06] but he is expecting great victory
[59:09] Hallelujah
[59:11] for by for by one offering he had
[59:14] perfected forever them that are
[59:16] Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also
[59:20] is a witness to us for after that he has
[59:23] said before this is the Covenant that I
[59:27] will make with them after those days
[59:29] saith the Lord I will put my laws into
[59:33] their hearts and in their minds will I
[59:36] write them
[59:38] and their sins and their iniquities will
[59:41] I remember no more
[59:44] now where remission of these is there is
[59:47] no more offering for sin wow
[59:52] think about it
[59:55] haven't therefore Brethren boldness to
[59:59] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:00:02] Jesus by a New and Living Way which he
[1:00:06] had consecrated for us through the Veil
[1:00:09] that is to say his flesh and having a
[1:00:12] high priest over the house of God let us
[1:00:15] draw near
[1:00:18] let us draw near the sacrifice has been
[1:00:21] made the blood has been shed we have
[1:00:24] entrance to the most holy place
[1:00:28] Hallelujah
[1:00:30] let us draw near with a true heart with
[1:00:33] in full Assurance of faith
[1:00:35] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:00:38] conscious and our bodies wash with pure
[1:00:41] water let us hold fast the profession of
[1:00:44] our faith without wavering
[1:00:47] for he
[1:00:48] is faithful that promise
[1:00:52] oh my
[1:00:54] Matthews 27 50.
[1:00:59] so we see here that there's an offering
[1:01:01] made
[1:01:03] the old is done
[1:01:05] it's not by the law anymore he's right
[1:01:08] in in our hearts
[1:01:11] like John says he says the law we want
[1:01:14] him
[1:01:15] when you speak it comes alive in our
[1:01:17] hearts
[1:01:19] we want a living reality of God David
[1:01:22] says my my soul thirsteth for the Living
[1:01:26] God
[1:01:28] he's not a traditional God he's not a
[1:01:31] religion he's a living God
[1:01:35] Hallelujah
[1:01:38] Jesus when he had cried again with a
[1:01:41] loud voice yielded up the ghosts
[1:01:44] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:01:48] rent in Twain
[1:01:49] from top to bottom
[1:01:52] and the Earth did quake and the Rocks
[1:01:55] rent
[1:01:56] and the graves were open and many bodies
[1:02:00] of the Saints which slept a rose
[1:02:02] then and came out of the graves after
[1:02:05] this resurrection and went into the holy

[1:04:51] right to the resurrection
[1:04:54] because it's not what a man has said
[1:04:58] it's not what any Ministry has said
[1:05:01] but is what the word has said
[1:05:05] and that's what we're here for
[1:05:08] the hour has passed
[1:05:10] where we're just playing church and
[1:05:13] religion
[1:05:15] and coming to church because it's a good
[1:05:18] feeling
[1:05:20] no those days are done
[1:05:23] listen there's a door just like Noah had
[1:05:26] a door on the ark
[1:05:28] and Noah priest for 120 years
[1:05:31] that there's a coming of flood a rain
[1:05:35] nobody's seen a rain
[1:05:38] scientists proved that there was no rain
[1:05:41] up there
[1:05:42] just like in this day
[1:05:45] but he preached and he preached to the
[1:05:48] people but one day that door shut
[1:05:52] and then the rain came
[1:05:56] and God is still
[1:05:58] I believe on The Mercy Seat
[1:06:01] he is still calling
[1:06:04] and if he's still calling there's still
[1:06:06] Mercy On The Mercy Seat
[1:06:11] but there will be a day that he'll cease
[1:06:14] the call and when he ceased the call
[1:06:17] then that door will be shut the bride
[1:06:20] will be sealed in that Veil will be
[1:06:22] closed
[1:06:23] there's an individual closing of the
[1:06:25] veil behind individuals and then there's
[1:06:28] a a closing of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:31] of prophecies in this hour that God will
[1:06:34] close it to the rest of the world
[1:06:38] and tribulation will set in
[1:06:41] that time
[1:06:46] we will see
[1:06:48] the judgments of God upon the Earth but
[1:06:51] now
[1:06:52] now you're sitting here
[1:06:54] this morning you're listening
[1:06:58] there's Mercy On The Mercy Seat
[1:07:03] God has made himself available
[1:07:07] and he's available to us this morning
[1:07:10] Hallelujah
[1:07:13] Matthew 16 16.
[1:07:16] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[1:07:19] the Christ
[1:07:20] the son of the Living God
[1:07:23] listen to what his response was when
[1:07:26] Jesus asked who do the son they say the
[1:07:29] son of man am
[1:07:30] Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:07:34] of the Living God
[1:07:36] and Jesus answered him and said unto him
[1:07:38] bless it
[1:07:40] art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and
[1:07:43] Blood had not revealed it to you but my
[1:07:47] father
[1:07:48] which is in heaven has revealed it to
[1:07:50] you or my father has started to rent the
[1:07:55] veil upon your life and your experience
[1:08:00] that's the first revelation that Peter
[1:08:02] caught that the father gave him and that
[1:08:05] was the beginning of the renting of the
[1:08:08] veil for Peter
[1:08:10] to see what was behind that Veil
[1:08:13] that thou art the Christ the son of the
[1:08:17] Living God
[1:08:18] many people didn't see him many people
[1:08:20] didn't understand him many people
[1:08:22] thought he was just the Carpenter's son
[1:08:24] born
[1:08:25] out of uh uh a false birth and all these
[1:08:29] things
[1:08:31] but the veil was rent for Peter
[1:08:34] and he took a look behind that Veil
[1:08:38] and he's seen
[1:08:40] who was behind there
[1:08:43] veils
[1:08:46] and I say unto thee Peter
[1:08:49] Upon This Rock
[1:08:53] I will build my church
[1:08:55] in the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:08:57] against it now we can understand and see
[1:09:00] how can the Gates of Hell Prevail
[1:09:02] against he himself
[1:09:05] or else they would have prevailed In The
[1:09:08] Garden of Gethsemane
[1:09:10] when all of hell was Upon Jesus Christ
[1:09:15] pressing him
[1:09:17] that's oil press you know that the
[1:09:19] guardian Gethsemane is olive trees
[1:09:22] and and to get olive oil you've got to
[1:09:25] press it
[1:09:26] well it's just a perfect symbol and type
[1:09:29] that he was there as the olive around
[1:09:33] the olive trees being pressed so that
[1:09:35] the oil
[1:09:37] can be pressed out of him
[1:09:40] oh my we have our Garden of Gethsemane
[1:09:43] we have our cross we got to be pressed
[1:09:47] into this and we got to press into the
[1:09:50] kingdom of God
[1:09:52] it's not come without violence and force
[1:09:55] not physically but spiritually
[1:10:02] that's how it comes
[1:10:06] Hallelujah
[1:10:08] First Corinthians 15 49.
[1:10:12] and as we have borne the image of the
[1:10:15] Earthly
[1:10:16] we shall also bear the image of the
[1:10:20] heavenly
[1:10:21] now this I say brethren
[1:10:23] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:10:25] kingdom of God neither do corruption
[1:10:28] inherit incorruption
[1:10:31] if we bore this
[1:10:34] we're going to bear
[1:10:36] the Heavenly too
[1:10:39] Hallelujah
[1:10:40] that's what I see I see the coming of
[1:10:43] the Lord in my life
[1:10:45] I see I see that God is going to come
[1:10:48] behind this Veil
[1:10:50] I don't care what this Veil is I don't
[1:10:53] care how it was born
[1:10:55] I don't care if if uh if you had parents
[1:11:00] or you didn't have parents whatever
[1:11:02] circumstances that this Veil is under
[1:11:08] God is going to live behind it if his if
[1:11:11] he has put a seed an attribute in there
[1:11:13] he's going to live behind it
[1:11:17] this Veil
[1:11:19] Hallelujah
[1:11:22] not worthy
[1:11:24] we're not worthy none of us are worthy
[1:11:26] if we look at this this Veil but if we
[1:11:29] look to the word and what he has spoken
[1:11:32] I Look to Him in my walk
[1:11:35] in everything that's why I can believe
[1:11:39] right I can believe as John says those
[1:11:43] that are born of God do not commit sin
[1:11:47] for the seed remaineth in him and the
[1:11:50] seed cannot sin
[1:11:53] what am I making him if I believe that
[1:11:57] he lives inside of me and I'm born again
[1:11:59] what am I making if I put condemnation
[1:12:02] and guilt on myself
[1:12:06] who am I representing myself
[1:12:09] no there's a sacrifice for this
[1:12:12] I'm representing him
[1:12:15] he's behind the veil now
[1:12:18] he's sinless
[1:12:22] recognize
[1:12:24] Who You Are
[1:12:27] there's a powerful
[1:12:29] recognition that has taken place by the
[1:12:32] Holy Ghost
[1:12:33] in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:12:35] that's why he said she's going to be
[1:12:37] invincible
[1:12:40] brother Bradham came to a place
[1:12:42] Billy Paul said that he had Satan's
[1:12:45] number
[1:12:47] not that he was perfect in the flesh
[1:12:50] but he has Satan's number
[1:12:52] he was Saul behind the veil
[1:12:57] he was so shut in with God
[1:13:01] and the truth of who he was
[1:13:04] that word was so matured inside of him
[1:13:08] that he understood
[1:13:11] that this thing
[1:13:14] had nothing to do with him
[1:13:17] that's the place he got to
[1:13:21] my my
[1:13:23] scriptures use the term Veil
[1:13:26] in different settings to refer to
[1:13:29] whatever covers our eyes from seeing God
[1:13:32] the eyes and seeing are not used for
[1:13:36] knowing or Experiencing God
[1:13:38] and not in a usual physical sense of
[1:13:42] seeing therefore a veil is whatever
[1:13:45] keeps people from knowing god or
[1:13:49] experiences power and his presence
[1:13:54] so many veils
[1:13:57] Upon Our Lives and that's what you got
[1:14:00] to take the word you got to work out
[1:14:02] your own salvation
[1:14:04] right is when you understand and you see
[1:14:07] by faith the veils that are on your life
[1:14:11] and you start renting it it's not about
[1:14:14] the pastor or the preacher coming
[1:14:17] it's use your faith
[1:14:20] that you take the word that's what it's
[1:14:23] all about it's individuals taking the
[1:14:26] word and renting veils upon your life
[1:14:29] Breaking Traditions breaking habits
[1:14:35] like brother Brown says thus saith the
[1:14:37] Lord nothing won't move thus saith the
[1:14:39] Lord thus saith the Lord
[1:14:41] keep speaking it keep believing it keep
[1:14:44] feeding on the word keep feed on who you
[1:14:46] are
[1:14:48] one day it'll break one day the
[1:14:50] revelation will come
[1:14:53] and just like he said in perfect faith
[1:14:54] when you know that Faith Comes it comes
[1:14:58] and nobody
[1:14:59] nobody can talk you out of that
[1:15:02] when that Faith Comes it's settled it's
[1:15:05] done it's over
[1:15:08] it's completed
[1:15:11] Hallelujah
[1:15:14] spiritual veils today
[1:15:16] cover people's hearts not their faces
[1:15:20] Paul says but even unto this day when
[1:15:24] Moses is read the veil is upon their
[1:15:26] hearts
[1:15:28] wow
[1:15:30] we can look back Moses
[1:15:33] in the types of Moses but who's our
[1:15:35] Moses
[1:15:39] veils
[1:15:41] even here today in the message veils
[1:15:45] valent people from sin and experience
[1:15:48] God look into what God did back there
[1:15:53] but not seeing what he's doing now not
[1:15:56] recognizing what he's doing now in your
[1:15:58] own life
[1:16:00] believing that God said a prophet is
[1:16:02] good
[1:16:03] believing the signs wondering Miracles
[1:16:05] are good believing that the prophet
[1:16:07] everything he said is true is good
[1:16:10] but have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:16:13] since you believe that
[1:16:15] has it become real to you
[1:16:19] in your life
[1:16:21] Hallelujah
[1:16:24] you keep praying for me
[1:16:26] as we press through here
[1:16:29] I was up most of the night not feeling
[1:16:31] well
[1:16:32] but here I am this morning
[1:16:35] the Press through
[1:16:37] amen
[1:16:38] because this is not about me
[1:16:41] you're looking at you're looking at this
[1:16:43] Veil out here right but this is not
[1:16:45] about me
[1:16:47] this is about him
[1:16:50] he's the one that died on Calvary not me
[1:16:54] he's the one that gave his life
[1:16:56] he's the one that's been walking in the
[1:16:59] middle of the church ages and all down
[1:17:01] Through the Ages he's the one that's
[1:17:03] kept the seed alive
[1:17:06] even to sometimes the very last time
[1:17:09] he's the one that planned all this he's
[1:17:12] the one that's purpose in his heart he's
[1:17:14] the one that has called you
[1:17:16] even to come and listen to the words
[1:17:18] this morning
[1:17:22] Hallelujah
[1:17:25] amen
[1:17:28] second Corinthians 3 15 when Moses came
[1:17:31] down
[1:17:32] from Sinai
[1:17:34] he put a physical Veil over his face
[1:17:38] because his face was glowing
[1:17:41] however this physical Veil on his face
[1:17:45] was a symbol of a spiritual Veil
[1:17:48] on the hearts of the Israelites covering
[1:17:52] their eyes from truly knowing and seeing
[1:17:55] God
[1:17:57] Hallelujah
[1:18:02] there's something wrong with man or
[1:18:04] woman
[1:18:06] that can't see the promises of God for
[1:18:08] this day
[1:18:10] and see it manifest
[1:18:13] and then refuse to believe it
[1:18:16] because of denominational pulls
[1:18:19] and veils
[1:18:21] you see they're all veils
[1:18:24] in order to do this our denominational
[1:18:27] tradition veils must be broken
[1:18:30] by God's spirit and Fire and sword which
[1:18:34] is his word
[1:18:36] always his word is the sword see and he
[1:18:40] took the sword that day full of fire and
[1:18:44] ripped the veil from top to bottom
[1:18:48] he does the same thing with the same
[1:18:51] sword today
[1:18:54] not my Creed book
[1:18:56] not my catechism
[1:18:59] Not My Thoughts my own ideas but the
[1:19:02] sword of the word you see that's what
[1:19:05] rips the Veil Down in our lives and then
[1:19:09] you can see God standing there in plain
[1:19:12] view
[1:19:13] what a glorious view to look at
[1:19:16] all right God's holy spirit and fire his
[1:19:20] sword rips it the word rips the
[1:19:23] nominational veils all different types
[1:19:26] of veils so that we can see him in plain
[1:19:29] view that's what we want to see is him
[1:19:32] we want to see Jesus
[1:19:35] we want to recognize him Above All
[1:19:38] Things
[1:19:39] he's our everything we are nothing
[1:19:42] without him
[1:19:43] but with him we're everything I can do
[1:19:47] all things through Christ who
[1:19:48] strengthens me and I believe the bride
[1:19:51] is recognizing who she is I believe
[1:19:54] she's coming to a place amen behind that
[1:19:57] inner Veil why because I can see it
[1:20:00] manifest
[1:20:02] the bride has the ability to see that
[1:20:05] word manifest right before her eyes
[1:20:08] she's recognizing the same God that's in
[1:20:11] her she's recognizing it out there in
[1:20:14] individuals
[1:20:15] that have rent the Veil
[1:20:18] oh my
[1:20:19] thank you Lord
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:27] the spiritual the scriptures also reveal
[1:20:30] types of spiritual veils
[1:20:32] first this is a veil
[1:20:35] of God
[1:20:36] the God of this world Satan
[1:20:39] that blinds unbelievers from seeing or
[1:20:43] accepting Jesus that's a big Veil today
[1:20:47] oh big Veil today of this world
[1:20:50] brother Brian cried out in the spirit
[1:20:53] and said blind laid osia
[1:20:57] you're so blind
[1:20:59] three times he cried out in the spirit
[1:21:03] the blindness of this age
[1:21:08] the darkness of this age is not only
[1:21:10] Darkness but it's gross Darkness
[1:21:13] if God didn't allow the prophet to draw
[1:21:16] a little bit of light that was the mercy
[1:21:18] and grace of God for me and you this
[1:21:22] morning that he drew a little bit of
[1:21:24] light
[1:21:25] that we could see our way out of this
[1:21:28] like brother George said last night they
[1:21:29] all came up how did you make it out of
[1:21:31] laosia I didn't think anybody was going
[1:21:34] to make it out of Laos here but let me
[1:21:36] tell you there's going to be a bride
[1:21:38] like never before in all ages
[1:21:42] they're going to bring a faith to
[1:21:44] Perfection that's going to change your
[1:21:46] body
[1:21:49] she has a backbone she's a warrior she's
[1:21:52] a fighter
[1:21:53] she doesn't give up when Satan comes and
[1:21:56] and Boo at her she boosts back
[1:22:00] she takes the word of God because she
[1:22:02] knows the word of God
[1:22:03] she knows that Satan cannot deal with
[1:22:06] that word
[1:22:07] when you try to deal with yourself you
[1:22:10] try to deal with your own thoughts your
[1:22:11] own interpretation
[1:22:13] you know that's that's when you get all
[1:22:15] tangled up and Satan takes you and and
[1:22:17] throws you around but you take that word
[1:22:20] of God
[1:22:21] you take that word of God he can't
[1:22:24] battle against that
[1:22:26] no way it's staying behind the word
[1:22:30] all right
[1:22:32] Hallelujah
[1:22:34] that has never changed and never will
[1:22:36] change
[1:22:38] Hallelujah
[1:22:40] how many times you've heard over the
[1:22:41] years our pastors screaming back to the
[1:22:44] word
[1:22:46] back to the truth back to the original
[1:22:48] way
[1:22:49] back to the Holy Ghost
[1:22:52] back to plenty class
[1:22:55] that's going to give you Pentecost
[1:22:57] in your life
[1:22:59] oh Hallelujah
[1:23:01] amen
[1:23:03] beneath that clip
[1:23:06] wired up here
[1:23:08] amen thank you Lord
[1:23:11] Hallelujah the second Veil
[1:23:14] of the Tabernacle which separates the
[1:23:16] people from God's presence Hebrews 10 20
[1:23:19] later revealed that this veil was Jesus
[1:23:23] body
[1:23:24] that had to be sacrificed for us to come
[1:23:27] to know the father in The holies of
[1:23:30] holies the third Veil is the law
[1:23:34] you see this is a strong Veil
[1:23:38] because the law is spiritual
[1:23:40] and and people like to mix today law and
[1:23:45] Grace
[1:23:46] here today but you can't mix law and
[1:23:49] Grace because Grace fulfilled law and
[1:23:52] you got to walk in Grace
[1:23:55] not in law because law brings Traditions
[1:23:58] rituals habits
[1:24:01] that you get yourself locked into
[1:24:04] and you don't see God
[1:24:09] one thing I've always recognized
[1:24:12] as I grow that we feel grown and
[1:24:14] maturing you know the wave sheep being
[1:24:16] waved before us we know he's the wave
[1:24:19] sheet but he waved himself when he came
[1:24:22] to the Earth here was God unveiled in
[1:24:25] flesh wave into the people his own
[1:24:27] people and they didn't see him they
[1:24:29] rejected them they were blind
[1:24:31] and here come a prophet in this day and
[1:24:33] age all the reformers but a prophet in
[1:24:36] this day and age God Valen behind that
[1:24:39] Veil that skin amen and waving himself
[1:24:43] what was that was it just the gifts was
[1:24:46] it just a discernment it was a life
[1:24:49] I detect a life there when I hear that
[1:24:51] voice I see and recognize a life
[1:24:56] I wanted God I wanted God when when when
[1:24:59] my life was so messed up and and and God
[1:25:03] came and spoke to me I wanted him I
[1:25:07] wanted I was empty I knew who I was I
[1:25:10] was lost
[1:25:12] I was lost
[1:25:14] you need to recognize that you're lost
[1:25:16] without him
[1:25:18] I needed him and that was it that's all
[1:25:21] I knew I needed the true and living God
[1:25:25] to come inside of me and do the changes
[1:25:28] that I need religion can't do that for
[1:25:30] you Traditions can't do that for you the
[1:25:34] law can't do that for you
[1:25:35] only he the Living God come behind the
[1:25:39] veil your Veil can do those changes that
[1:25:41] you need in your life
[1:25:46] listen young people
[1:25:48] Mary was only Young
[1:25:51] she's only a teenager when the angel
[1:25:53] came to her
[1:25:54] and said Mary
[1:25:56] this is what's going to happen
[1:25:59] this is what's going to take place
[1:26:00] behind your Veil
[1:26:03] you're going to conceive
[1:26:05] and that's going to be the Son of God
[1:26:07] that you're going to conceive and she
[1:26:10] said how how can this be I know no man
[1:26:13] and that's that's typical of a human
[1:26:15] being oh how can this be I I don't pray
[1:26:19] enough I don't study enough I don't do
[1:26:21] this enough I don't do that my good
[1:26:22] works my sins my mistakes in my life how
[1:26:26] can it be that the Son of God is going
[1:26:29] to be born inside of me
[1:26:32] but he told he said the Holy Ghost not
[1:26:35] you not your church
[1:26:37] the Holy Ghost young people the Holy
[1:26:41] Ghost will overshadow you and come into
[1:26:43] you
[1:26:44] and let that be born
[1:26:47] what do you got to do young people maybe
[1:26:50] older people here today
[1:26:52] be it unto me
[1:26:54] according to Thy Word
[1:26:56] according to Thy word be it unto me
[1:27:01] and then start your journey
[1:27:03] this glorious Journey
[1:27:05] of dying out daily as Paul says
[1:27:08] I Die daily
[1:27:10] I can't die
[1:27:12] I can't die a true Christian can't die
[1:27:16] I'm dying right now
[1:27:18] I'm dying daily to myself
[1:27:25] you know you understand why your brother
[1:27:27] and your sister is not your enemy
[1:27:30] you understand the prophet what he said
[1:27:32] your greatest enemies yourself
[1:27:34] and it says work out your own salvation
[1:27:38] keep your eyes on Jesus Christ
[1:27:40] pray for your brother and sister because
[1:27:42] you know the sin that they're struggling
[1:27:43] with
[1:27:45] might not be the sin you're struggling
[1:27:47] with but it's still sin
[1:27:48] amen
[1:27:50] that's why
[1:27:51] who is love God is love
[1:27:54] you can have all these gifts and all
[1:27:56] these manifestations it says but if you
[1:28:00] don't have love
[1:28:01] you have nothing
[1:28:04] love governs and conquers everything
[1:28:07] Hallelujah
[1:28:10] what about us today
[1:28:13] what could prevent us from knowing and
[1:28:15] experience God's power and his presence
[1:28:19] since there are three veils above
[1:28:23] have been removed in Christ
[1:28:25] the believer's problem today is that we
[1:28:28] could call it functional veils or
[1:28:32] spiritual blindness in general for
[1:28:35] instance a lack of understanding
[1:28:37] will prevent us from knowing god
[1:28:40] Ephesians 1 18-20 while a lack of faith
[1:28:45] will hinder us from seeing the power and
[1:28:47] glory of God John 11 14.
[1:28:52] the Bible says if you lack wisdom you
[1:28:55] lack Faith ask
[1:28:57] and God will give it liberally
[1:29:01] there's no shame
[1:29:03] in lock in faith
[1:29:05] or experience with God
[1:29:08] but there's shame when you don't get
[1:29:11] desperate before God you don't be
[1:29:14] perseverant before God
[1:29:16] you don't be like the unjust judge and
[1:29:18] keep knocking on the door Lord It's Me
[1:29:22] Again Lord It's Me Again Lord
[1:29:28] not my brother not my sister but it's me
[1:29:30] in the need
[1:29:32] of Revelation
[1:29:35] it's a constant unfolding like the Roman
[1:29:38] Candle it's constantly involved in
[1:29:40] itself a morphing in itself bringing
[1:29:43] itself down just like he condescend down
[1:29:46] into flesh he's doing the same thing in
[1:29:48] our lives he's condescended by the word
[1:29:51] of God believed by faith in our hearts
[1:29:54] he's condescending into us
[1:29:58] today
[1:29:59] Hallelujah
[1:30:03] John 16 13.
[1:30:06] when the spirit of truth comes
[1:30:09] it will guide you into all truth
[1:30:12] man's teachings are veils that keep us
[1:30:15] from recognizing God
[1:30:17] and recognizing our position
[1:30:19] man is always trying to take the law and
[1:30:22] mix it with Grace because of unbelief
[1:30:25] or lock
[1:30:26] of Revelation
[1:30:28] there are always motives and intentions
[1:30:32] behind
[1:30:34] doing
[1:30:36] thank you
[1:30:37] the spirit of Revelation is what tears
[1:30:41] and rips the veils Upon Our Lives
[1:30:43] we recognize our sins then we confess
[1:30:47] them then we believe that we are set
[1:30:50] free then the veil of sin is ripped and
[1:30:53] we enter more little by little into most
[1:30:56] to the most holy place the holies of
[1:30:59] holies with Jesus Christ little by
[1:31:02] little will I deliver my people
[1:31:04] little by little will I give you the
[1:31:06] land
[1:31:08] Hallelujah
[1:31:09] don't look for great great land to be
[1:31:12] taken and great things to happen but
[1:31:15] little by little God will give you
[1:31:16] Victory he'll give you a peace one step
[1:31:20] at a time he'll give it to you but don't
[1:31:22] stop walking keep walking in the light
[1:31:26] keep walking in the spirit
[1:31:29] you'll overcome
[1:31:31] you will overcome one day
[1:31:34] you will get the victory that you need
[1:31:38] that revelation will break through
[1:31:40] remember Daniel
[1:31:42] pray 21 days for the answer he said
[1:31:47] the angel said I had a resistance
[1:31:49] against me I had a battle believe me
[1:31:53] there's battles here today there's
[1:31:56] Angels warring around here but there's
[1:31:58] angels of God here so that the word can
[1:32:02] go forth into your heart into your soul
[1:32:06] and maybe start ripping the Veil
[1:32:11] when that Veil starts ripping you ain't
[1:32:13] going to see me you ain't gonna see
[1:32:15] brother Simon you ain't going to see any
[1:32:16] ministers you're going to see Jesus
[1:32:18] Christ a pillar of Fire
[1:32:21] and you know
[1:32:22] what would I know you know when you see
[1:32:24] him
[1:32:25] you know when you recognize him just
[1:32:27] like Peter when he recognized him Thou
[1:32:30] Art does Christ the son of the Living
[1:32:31] God
[1:32:34] that's who this is
[1:32:36] that's who this is
[1:32:39] that's who this has always been for me
[1:32:42] and I'm recognizing it more and more and
[1:32:44] more
[1:32:45] as I walk
[1:32:47] the scales are being lifted the veil is
[1:32:49] being rent more and more
[1:32:52] until we walk right into the glory
[1:32:55] Hallelujah
[1:32:58] thank you Lord
[1:33:00] we make a lot of things in our lives
[1:33:02] hinder the word of God
[1:33:04] and make the word of God a none effect
[1:33:07] think about that
[1:33:10] not God us
[1:33:13] we do that
[1:33:16] it does not take effect like Jesus said
[1:33:19] my word will not return unto me void but
[1:33:22] it will accomplish
[1:33:25] you wonder why God has to break you
[1:33:27] sometimes
[1:33:28] you wonder why you have to fall
[1:33:30] sometimes
[1:33:32] because his word must accomplish it must
[1:33:36] be completed what he sent it for
[1:33:39] and sometimes we're not walking in the
[1:33:41] program of God we're not seeing and
[1:33:43] Understanding God's will for our lives
[1:33:45] so he has to redirect us
[1:33:48] listen Peter said rejoice when trials
[1:33:50] and troubles come in our lives Rejoice
[1:33:53] because it's God's favor upon us
[1:33:56] I love those who I rebuke and I chase
[1:33:59] and I love you he says
[1:34:02] and I love that
[1:34:04] I never I couldn't say that for many
[1:34:06] many years but I love that
[1:34:09] oh and God's chastening comes upon me
[1:34:11] and and he he he just grabbing my
[1:34:15] attention doing things to stir my life
[1:34:18] up and turn it around oh yeah it's not
[1:34:21] funny in the flesh it's not doesn't feel
[1:34:23] good in the flesh but in my soul all is
[1:34:27] well
[1:34:28] God is interested in me
[1:34:30] God's favors with me he's paying
[1:34:34] attention to me and that's the greatest
[1:34:36] thing to a sudden daughter of God when
[1:34:39] God turns his face towards you and looks
[1:34:42] towards you
[1:34:44] Hallelujah I have chosen you you haven't
[1:34:48] chosen me I've chosen you
[1:34:50] Oh Glory to God
[1:34:52] that's enough
[1:34:54] when you recognize that
[1:34:58] oh thankful you talk about being
[1:35:00] thankful
[1:35:01] oh my
[1:35:05] God Jesus
[1:35:08] yes Lord
[1:35:11] Satan hindering us
[1:35:13] so we know when we are hindered or
[1:35:16] distracted or LED away and other
[1:35:19] priorities
[1:35:21] or something else but the word of God
[1:35:24] in order for the word of God to take
[1:35:26] effect
[1:35:27] we must be
[1:35:29] in the word feeding on the word
[1:35:32] expecting the word to be revealed and to
[1:35:36] be made known to us you see the
[1:35:38] difference expecting the word to be
[1:35:40] revealed it may known to us when I read
[1:35:42] the scriptures when I put on a tape and
[1:35:44] I listen when I go down into prayer I
[1:35:46] expect God to meet me there I expect the
[1:35:49] word to open up to me something Lord
[1:35:52] give me something that I can feed on my
[1:35:55] soul can rest and strength upon
[1:35:58] especially in times of trouble and need
[1:36:01] and he never fails
[1:36:04] we're serving a living God here behind
[1:36:07] the veil Hallelujah
[1:36:10] amen
[1:36:13] thank you Lord
[1:36:14] in second Timothy 3 the Apostle Paul
[1:36:17] describes the nature of people in the
[1:36:19] last days in this description he warns a
[1:36:23] people who are characterized as having a
[1:36:26] form of godliness
[1:36:28] but denying the power to live this word
[1:36:33] he's warning the Church of the Living
[1:36:35] God he's warning the bride and even more
[1:36:39] so in this message
[1:36:41] having a form of godliness you're you're
[1:36:44] formed up as a message believer oh you
[1:36:47] you you you you automatically by the law
[1:36:50] dress yourself with the law of the word
[1:36:53] but deny the power that's what we're
[1:36:55] talking about here today the power and
[1:36:58] the seed the night of power to live this
[1:37:00] word
[1:37:02] I want to live this word
[1:37:04] I want to become this word I want this
[1:37:07] word to have preemness in my life I
[1:37:09] don't want my life anymore
[1:37:12] you talk like this out there maybe even
[1:37:15] some of you are thinking it right now
[1:37:16] you're crazy
[1:37:19] to you I am
[1:37:21] to you I am and that's fine that's a
[1:37:23] compliment to me thank you
[1:37:27] the spirit is still a discerner
[1:37:30] in verse 5 he tells Timothy devoid those
[1:37:34] who State they are Christians with their
[1:37:37] mouths and have a form of godliness but
[1:37:40] who act as unbelievers they deny the
[1:37:43] power of godliness
[1:37:45] those who have a form of godliness and
[1:37:47] those who make an outward display of
[1:37:50] religion they present themselves as
[1:37:52] golly
[1:37:53] but it is all for show
[1:37:58] there is no power behind their religion
[1:38:03] as evidence in fact that their lives
[1:38:07] are unchanged
[1:38:11] they speak of God and live in sin
[1:38:14] and they are fine with that arrangement
[1:38:18] yes
[1:38:21] living in sin is living in unbelief
[1:38:24] and what are we talking about Who We Are
[1:38:27] thus faith
[1:38:30] when when you don't recognize who you
[1:38:32] are or don't believe what the word says
[1:38:35] you are
[1:38:36] that's that's what makes the difference
[1:38:38] here it's not whether you're better than
[1:38:40] me or I'm better than you I'm more
[1:38:41] holier than you you're more holier than
[1:38:43] me that's not that's not what is that's
[1:38:46] not what's being judged here by the by
[1:38:48] the word of God and the word of God
[1:38:51] judges all things and judgment starts in
[1:38:54] the house of the Lord with the word of
[1:38:56] God
[1:38:57] that's not what being judged here it's
[1:39:00] whether you believe
[1:39:02] what has been spoken of you whether you
[1:39:05] believe the prophecies that have been
[1:39:07] spoken about you that you are those
[1:39:09] prophecies that you and the word are one
[1:39:12] in the same for this day and for this
[1:39:15] hour
[1:39:15] that you are the one that's going to
[1:39:17] produce a body change listen there's
[1:39:19] seven billion people on the Earth and if
[1:39:22] there's only one out of a million you
[1:39:23] know that makes it 7 000 people that are
[1:39:26] going to be going and there's
[1:39:27] approximately two or three million
[1:39:29] people in this message but let me tell
[1:39:31] you this morning by the grace of God
[1:39:34] that I'm one of those 7 000 people that
[1:39:37] are going and if you don't believe it
[1:39:39] that way then what are you believing for
[1:39:42] what are you believing for
[1:39:47] what are you coming to church for if you
[1:39:49] don't believe
[1:39:50] that you're one of those
[1:39:54] Hallelujah
[1:39:56] thank you Lord
[1:39:58] this is the hour of perfect faith
[1:40:00] so more faith is needed to overcome the
[1:40:04] Flesh and the world modern vents made
[1:40:07] clear by Vindicated prophecy we are
[1:40:10] awake
[1:40:11] we have been ordained to be awake in
[1:40:15] this hour away from all the lies and to
[1:40:18] recognize the revealed truth to to
[1:40:21] awaken to our calling in our position
[1:40:25] Awakening and recognizing our true
[1:40:28] identity in Christ
[1:40:30] The Awakening of the Bride is happening
[1:40:33] it's here it's now
[1:40:36] that's what that's what's been taking
[1:40:38] place whether you fully understand it or
[1:40:40] not
[1:40:41] truth that is being revealed to you God
[1:40:44] dealing with your life
[1:40:46] dealing with areas of your life and
[1:40:48] showing you this showing you that
[1:40:51] you know back in the beginning
[1:40:53] we're you know we pray God moves
[1:40:56] this happens that happens over here
[1:40:59] we talk about this we listen to this we
[1:41:01] come to church we hear the word being
[1:41:03] preached Vindication after Vindication
[1:41:05] is happening all the time you see you
[1:41:09] started Awakening you started
[1:41:11] recognizing something you don't fully
[1:41:14] understand what it is you don't fully
[1:41:16] understand and see who you are but
[1:41:19] you're seeing a lot of different things
[1:41:20] but you can't place it all together but
[1:41:22] let me tell you the words coming in this
[1:41:24] hour by the spirit of God not by men but
[1:41:28] by his Spirit his spirit is preaching
[1:41:30] amen the word of God Paul says I Don't
[1:41:33] Preach in word but I preach in spirit
[1:41:36] and in truth
[1:41:38] what is the truth when they ask Jesus
[1:41:41] Jesus said I am the truth the way in the
[1:41:43] life he goes what is truth
[1:41:47] I asked you this morning what is truth
[1:41:50] what is truth under the word of God what
[1:41:53] is truth to you in the word and what
[1:41:55] you've been receiving all these years
[1:41:57] what is truth to you
[1:42:02] Hallelujah
[1:42:05] I know what truth is I'm not going to
[1:42:07] answer for me you answer for yourself
[1:42:09] what is truth
[1:42:11] for you
[1:42:13] Hallelujah
[1:42:16] God knows and he discerns the thoughts
[1:42:19] and intents of the heart and motives he
[1:42:21] knows the people who want to go behind
[1:42:23] the veil
[1:42:25] and see that word he knows the people
[1:42:27] that are desperate
[1:42:29] and that are persevering and that are
[1:42:32] pressing into the kingdom
[1:42:33] he knows like Jacob
[1:42:36] Jacob wrestled with that angel
[1:42:40] Jacob wanted that Birthright
[1:42:42] let me tell you young people old people
[1:42:46] you got to be like Jacob you gotta want
[1:42:49] that Birthright
[1:42:50] you've got to want to know what has
[1:42:53] taken place here
[1:42:57] because his head
[1:42:58] even this morning it's hid
[1:43:01] the word is hid behind a veil this
[1:43:04] morning and only he can open that Veil
[1:43:07] and let you see behind that Veil the
[1:43:09] word of God the word of life
[1:43:12] but you got to be like Jacob you got to
[1:43:14] wrestle and say Lord I'm not letting you
[1:43:16] go you imagine that he fought with an
[1:43:19] angel an angel he's a human he fought
[1:43:23] with an angel he said I ain't letting
[1:43:25] you go he knew he could be destroyed he
[1:43:28] could be ripped apart he could be dead
[1:43:30] but he said I ain't letting you go until
[1:43:32] you give me my Birthright
[1:43:34] my right birth
[1:43:36] I want it
[1:43:38] never going to come any other way my
[1:43:39] brothers and sisters
[1:43:41] not going to come any other way and each
[1:43:43] process of your walk
[1:43:45] even if you bent birth each process of
[1:43:47] your walk has to come the same way
[1:43:50] Hallelujah
[1:43:52] we're going to fight until the day we
[1:43:54] leave here
[1:43:55] but we're going to fight in the flesh
[1:43:57] we're going to fight in this Dimension
[1:43:59] but inside all is well
[1:44:02] all is well
[1:44:05] I have crossed the ribbon Vale where the
[1:44:07] glories never fail I'm hidden with god
[1:44:10] with the Shekinah Glory there's rest
[1:44:13] there's peace
[1:44:15] there's healing there's comfort in there
[1:44:19] hallelujah oh glory to God
[1:44:23] thank you Lord
[1:44:25] God is just not on my mind all the time
[1:44:28] but God is my mind
[1:44:31] the mind of Christ is me Hallelujah
[1:44:35] oh it's always living in every moment
[1:44:38] and constantly changing and coming
[1:44:41] through every channel of the ten senses
[1:44:43] to my soul the seed of God to bring the
[1:44:47] word to manifestation amen
[1:44:50] oh yes that's what it is to a child and
[1:44:53] of God he's not only on my mind oh I
[1:44:56] think about God I hear all people saying
[1:44:58] that I think about God all day long and
[1:45:00] they go do this and they go do that
[1:45:02] he is my mind
[1:45:04] he wants to be your mind
[1:45:08] that's why he said put on the mind of
[1:45:09] Christ
[1:45:10] put away your mind die out to yourself
[1:45:14] lose everything about yourself
[1:45:16] the greatest Revelation you can catch
[1:45:18] today to realize that you need to dial
[1:45:20] to yourself that you're no good in
[1:45:22] yourself in your flesh I'm talking about
[1:45:25] and realize that you need him
[1:45:30] Hallelujah
[1:45:32] if the same spirit that raised Christ
[1:45:34] from the dead
[1:45:36] his dead body if it be in you Jesus
[1:45:40] Christ was the first one to come to
[1:45:41] maturity and he was waived over every
[1:45:44] seed of God and the prophet came to
[1:45:47] maturity and his sinful flesh and was
[1:45:49] waved over the bride and still is until
[1:45:53] the same
[1:45:55] overcoming power is restored in her
[1:45:59] to her to bring her flesh under control
[1:46:03] and being waved to this dying generation
[1:46:07] I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:46:11] is the next wave she that is happening
[1:46:13] now because it's Christ in her waving
[1:46:17] himself again
[1:46:18] she's coming to that maturity
[1:46:21] she's coming to that place my brothers
[1:46:23] and sisters
[1:46:24] oh yes
[1:46:26] oh yes I don't I I you know it's such a
[1:46:30] fine line
[1:46:31] it's such a fine line Jesus didn't have
[1:46:33] a problem saying I and the father are
[1:46:34] one and the same but it's such a fine
[1:46:37] line when you say in this day look at
[1:46:39] all the confusion that has happened
[1:46:41] around the prophet's message with
[1:46:43] calling him deity saying everything that
[1:46:45] he said was thus saith the Lord that's
[1:46:47] impossible because if he's everything
[1:46:49] that he said was thus saved the Lord he
[1:46:52] would be God
[1:46:53] and that's what they make him God but
[1:46:55] she is when the veil is over people's
[1:46:58] eyes and that Veil is not rent to see
[1:47:01] what was behind him you see god Jehovah
[1:47:04] poured himself into Christ
[1:47:07] poured himself into the church the Holy
[1:47:11] Ghost and that's what it is Christ The
[1:47:14] Mighty Angel poured himself into the
[1:47:17] prophet
[1:47:18] Hallelujah and now Christ has poured
[1:47:22] himself into the bride
[1:47:27] Hallelujah
[1:47:29] Hallelujah brother George said it last
[1:47:32] night is going to come a time it's
[1:47:34] coming right now where where where where
[1:47:36] these manifestations of of the
[1:47:39] prophecies are going to be start being
[1:47:40] fulfilled in her life and people are
[1:47:42] going to say you
[1:47:43] say you're that
[1:47:45] you see you're the yes
[1:47:48] he said I'm not
[1:47:50] Hallelujah
[1:47:52] Hallelujah
[1:47:56] thank you Lord
[1:47:58] I still got a few minutes here
[1:48:01] amen we read in James 1 2-4 consider it
[1:48:05] pure joy my brothers and sisters when
[1:48:08] You Face many trials because you know
[1:48:10] the testing of your faith produces
[1:48:12] perseverance
[1:48:13] well it produces perseverance
[1:48:16] thank you Lord that's what we need
[1:48:18] and let perseverance finish its work
[1:48:21] and ripping the veils and open it up so
[1:48:24] you can enter in

[1:48:29] God knows what he's doing in your life
[1:48:31] he knows why you're going through what
[1:48:33] you're going through
[1:48:36] he knows exactly where he's leading you
[1:48:39] we need to surrender into his leading
[1:48:41] into his hands
[1:48:42] and just say Lord I let go of my life
[1:48:45] and surrender to you
[1:48:48] because I know you know what's best for
[1:48:49] me
[1:48:51] Hebrews 12 1 wherefore see and we are so
[1:48:55] compass
[1:48:56] with a great cloud of witnesses let us
[1:49:00] lay aside every weight and the sin which
[1:49:04] do so easily beset us and let us run
[1:49:07] with patience the race that is set
[1:49:09] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[1:49:11] and finisher of our faith let us lay
[1:49:14] aside the unbelief
[1:49:18] that constantly tells us who we are not
[1:49:21] but let us take the faith
[1:49:24] hey man let's lay that aside
[1:49:27] Satan is going to constantly bombard you
[1:49:31] constantly being bring condemnation upon
[1:49:34] you and guilt constantly telling you who
[1:49:37] you're not let me tell you if he's
[1:49:39] telling you you're not bride is there
[1:49:41] good evidence that you are
[1:49:43] because if he's after you he does not
[1:49:46] got you
[1:49:48] but if he's not after you that means
[1:49:50] he's got you you're comfortable I don't
[1:49:52] hear none of that stuff going on in my
[1:49:54] life
[1:49:54] well watch out
[1:49:57] be careful
[1:49:58] you might be in his claws his claws of
[1:50:02] unbelief
[1:50:04] Hallelujah so let's lay aside everything
[1:50:07] that comes into our minds and in our
[1:50:10] hearts everything that Satan tries to
[1:50:12] speak to us trying to tell us who we're
[1:50:14] not let's lay all that aside and let us
[1:50:17] look to him
[1:50:21] for he's the one that told tells us who
[1:50:23] we are
[1:50:24] amen I'm more than a conqueror
[1:50:28] Hallelujah I'm more than a conqueror
[1:50:31] Hallelujah
[1:50:34] he's the one that started my faith
[1:50:36] he's the one that started Peter's faith
[1:50:38] look Peter started that Veil started
[1:50:40] renting and Peter seemed that he was the
[1:50:43] son of God but then Peter denied him
[1:50:45] but then Pentecost came
[1:50:48] and you talk about Pentecost ripping the
[1:50:50] veil from top to bottom and each in
[1:50:53] those lives and the pillar of Fire
[1:50:54] coming down think about it and dwelling
[1:50:58] over them
[1:51:00] they got to that place
[1:51:02] amen pillar fire dwelling over them it
[1:51:05] didn't stay over them but it went inside
[1:51:07] of them and that's why they produced a
[1:51:10] life that they produced after Pentecost
[1:51:13] that's why the book of Acts produced The
[1:51:15] Book of Acts
[1:51:16] Hallelujah so don't get discouraged if
[1:51:20] you start seeing that he's the son of
[1:51:22] God that you start seeing that this
[1:51:24] message is Christ The Living Word and
[1:51:26] then you fall back into sin or you fall
[1:51:28] back into uh uh discouragement or
[1:51:31] anything like that keep pressing through
[1:51:34] keep walking where can you go
[1:51:36] listen every child and Son and Daughter
[1:51:39] of God knows something deep inside and
[1:51:41] one thing they know like Peter where can
[1:51:43] we go you have the words of life
[1:51:46] if they go out from us because they're
[1:51:48] not of us they've never seen this word
[1:51:51] of life I went through many things
[1:51:53] walking this walk for 32 years many
[1:51:56] things that could have took me out many
[1:51:58] times I was down but it always came back
[1:52:01] where can I go
[1:52:03] you got the words of Life This Is The
[1:52:06] Word of Life
[1:52:07] Hallelujah
[1:52:10] glory to God
[1:52:12] thank you Lord
[1:52:14] amen
[1:52:17] oh Hallelujah
[1:52:20] amen the human being is made up just
[1:52:24] like a grain of wheat
[1:52:25] it's a seed the human being is a seed
[1:52:28] and any seed has a shell on it on the
[1:52:31] outside
[1:52:32] the inside pulp and inside the pulp is
[1:52:35] the German life we are Body Soul and
[1:52:38] Spirit
[1:52:40] you find out that the outside body has
[1:52:43] five senses that contact we're contacted
[1:52:45] by which is see taste feel smell in here
[1:52:49] that's the five senses that control the
[1:52:51] body
[1:52:52] inside the body is the soul
[1:52:56] and that soul is controlled by
[1:52:58] imagination conscience memory reason and
[1:53:02] affections
[1:53:03] and that's our battle those 10 senses
[1:53:08] but God has given us a word
[1:53:11] he said the prophet said that God gave
[1:53:14] him the greatest battle ever fought
[1:53:16] message and said bring it to the church
[1:53:19] and let me tell you this is the Avenue
[1:53:24] this is the instruction if you catch it
[1:53:26] by faith that God has given us so that
[1:53:30] that word become flesh in US
[1:53:33] Hallelujah this will always be our
[1:53:37] battle and this is where brother Branham
[1:53:39] had Satan's number because he had all
[1:53:42] these 10 senses under the control of the
[1:53:45] word of God if they did not agree with
[1:53:48] the word of God Amen he cast it out
[1:53:51] that's why he said he doubted his doubts
[1:53:54] we got to doubt our doubts sometimes
[1:53:57] sometimes we don't know we don't
[1:53:58] understand we don't see and doubt comes
[1:54:01] in in a situation but we gotta doubt
[1:54:04] those doubts if it don't line up with
[1:54:06] the word of God
[1:54:07] because this is God's Channel
[1:54:11] now listen
[1:54:13] Hallelujah
[1:54:15] that's the thing that controls the soul
[1:54:18] but the spirit
[1:54:20] it only has one sense let's get it he
[1:54:23] says
[1:54:24] the spirit has one sense and that sense
[1:54:27] either dominates it is Faith or doubt
[1:54:32] now listen to the soul
[1:54:35] is the spirit
[1:54:38] and what does the spirit feed on
[1:54:41] other faith or doubt
[1:54:44] why do you think
[1:54:46] the Bible says and Jesus himself says if
[1:54:49] you love the world
[1:54:51] and the things of the world
[1:54:53] the love of God is not inside of you
[1:54:56] or it's not inside of you enough you
[1:54:59] know why because the things of the world
[1:55:02] your spirit feeds off of that
[1:55:07] and when your spirit feeds off the
[1:55:10] things of the world which is doubt it
[1:55:13] can't bring you faith in the word it
[1:55:15] can't bring you faith in who you are and
[1:55:16] what God says you are it brings doubt
[1:55:19] and unbelief
[1:55:21] into that channel and then when that
[1:55:24] happens now it starts going through and
[1:55:27] feeding through every other channel of
[1:55:30] those ten senses and you wonder why
[1:55:32] sometimes you're in the condition that
[1:55:34] you're in
[1:55:38] you see
[1:55:39] that's what God is building soldiers of
[1:55:43] the cross
[1:55:44] building an army
[1:55:46] an invincible Army
[1:55:49] that's going to take control and Conquer
[1:55:52] every one of those enemies
[1:55:55] so that she her spirit only feeds on the
[1:55:59] word of God she only believes the word
[1:56:02] of God she never doubts the word of God
[1:56:04] whatever he speaks she obeys it
[1:56:10] this might sound crazy to some depending
[1:56:13] what Veil that is covering you
[1:56:16] but this is real to the Bride of Jesus
[1:56:18] Christ
[1:56:19] oh yes
[1:56:21] now listen
[1:56:22] there's only one Avenue that's three
[1:56:25] more ages
[1:56:26] God ain't gonna force your hand
[1:56:28] God ain't going to tell you to come back
[1:56:30] here the church
[1:56:32] God ain't going to tell you and twist
[1:56:33] your arm to read the Bible and all that
[1:56:35] no
[1:56:37] he set you free he set everybody free
[1:56:39] that's why people don't understand why
[1:56:41] the world is why don't God do this why
[1:56:43] don't God do that God set everybody free
[1:56:45] he's given us his word
[1:56:48] he's given us his word he wants to see
[1:56:50] with that freedom what you believe
[1:56:53] what's inside of you what seed is inside
[1:56:55] of you
[1:56:56] Hallelujah
[1:56:58] you can either accept doubt or you can
[1:57:01] accept Faith either one you want work on
[1:57:05] that you want to work on therefore Satan
[1:57:07] began at the principal part to cause the
[1:57:09] spirit of man to doubt God's word that's
[1:57:12] where he goes
[1:57:14] that's where all the distraction in this
[1:57:16] world is to go to your spirit so that
[1:57:19] you can doubt who you are doubt the word
[1:57:21] of God
[1:57:23] Hallelujah but God began at the
[1:57:27] principal part laying his word in that
[1:57:29] spirit
[1:57:30] but your mind accepts it what is your
[1:57:33] mind control by your spirit and your
[1:57:36] spirit catches the word of God and
[1:57:38] that's the thing that's got life in it
[1:57:40] and brings life into you
[1:57:43] when that takes place when life comes
[1:57:47] down that channel into you the word of
[1:57:50] God is made manifest in you
[1:57:53] that's how life comes into you it has to
[1:57:57] come God's provided way
[1:58:00] through that channel
[1:58:02] it can't come any other way
[1:58:05] you can make you can have your own
[1:58:07] interpretations your own thoughts of
[1:58:08] what Grace is all about
[1:58:10] but what Grace really means is not you
[1:58:14] can do anything you want to do
[1:58:16] and expect God to do
[1:58:18] what he said he's going to do
[1:58:20] but Grace gives you the ability to do
[1:58:23] what God wants you to do
[1:58:28] that's what Grace is
[1:58:30] he gives you the ability to do what God
[1:58:33] wants you to do
[1:58:34] so Lord give me Grace
[1:58:37] in this hour give me Grace in this trial
[1:58:39] what give me the ability to overcome
[1:58:43] give me the ability to press through
[1:58:45] this trial give me the ability to press
[1:58:47] through this unbelief let's try to hold
[1:58:49] me and keep me in Chains and bind me
[1:58:53] down
[1:58:53] Give Me Your Grace
[1:58:55] Hallelujah
[1:58:58] okay
[1:59:00] Hallelujah
[1:59:03] thank you Lord
[1:59:04] from the middle of the heart
[1:59:06] which is the soul
[1:59:08] there goes fourth feet in every channel
[1:59:10] the trouble of it is we're standing here
[1:59:12] with a lot of Doubt trying to accept
[1:59:14] that which is out there
[1:59:17] how can you accept the word how can you
[1:59:19] accept what's being preached service
[1:59:22] after service when you're standing there
[1:59:25] out there except in that
[1:59:28] you can't
[1:59:30] it'll never work it'll never mix God's
[1:59:32] word don't mix with nothing it's got to
[1:59:35] be God's word or nothing
[1:59:37] you've got to accept God's word or
[1:59:40] nothing
[1:59:41] he won't mix it
[1:59:43] not even for you
[1:59:45] not for nobody
[1:59:48] some people say oh God loves me so much
[1:59:50] he'll let me do whatever I want to do
[1:59:51] and mix this and mix that no he won't
[1:59:54] no I won't
[1:59:56] he doesn't mix nothing he won't let he
[1:59:58] won't let a true trial of God you know
[2:00:00] what a true son and daughter of God
[2:00:01] don't want to do that anyways that's not
[2:00:04] in her heart that's not her desire
[2:00:06] she wants to do his will even Jesus when
[2:00:09] he was in the garden he says oh if you
[2:00:11] can remove this cup how many times we
[2:00:14] say Lord could you remove this cup this
[2:00:16] trial this pressure upon my life
[2:00:19] but something inside of you raises up
[2:00:21] that new birth amen from behind the
[2:00:24] inner Veil not in my will but thy will
[2:00:27] be done if I have to suffer whatever I
[2:00:30] have to go through
[2:00:31] to bring forth Christ in my life
[2:00:34] that's what I have to go through he had
[2:00:37] to suffer he had to die we don't even
[2:00:39] understand we don't even understand the
[2:00:42] pain physically that he went through on
[2:00:43] the cross
[2:00:44] what he had to go through and he knew it
[2:00:47] but he still went through it
[2:00:49] why he had to go through that to bring
[2:00:52] this to bring you here today
[2:00:56] to give you what you got in your life if
[2:00:59] you got something from God because it
[2:01:01] came from Calvary it came from that
[2:01:03] sacrifice
[2:01:07] you think of what he's asking for us to
[2:01:09] do is nothing
[2:01:12] you think the trials the Bible says that
[2:01:14] you go through now they won't compare to
[2:01:17] the glory
[2:01:20] I think about when the saints move on
[2:01:22] and they move into that other dimension
[2:01:24] what they're going through oh my
[2:01:28] oh the glory
[2:01:31] never expected it never even entered in
[2:01:34] their minds and even in their hearts
[2:01:38] when they enter to that place
[2:01:43] Hallelujah
[2:01:44] that's why we'll we enter in that place
[2:01:46] you know
[2:01:49] I told my wife if God's taken me
[2:01:52] and I interned in that place don't think
[2:01:54] I'm going to want to come back here
[2:01:56] no way
[2:01:58] I won't want to come back here I'm gone
[2:02:02] as soon as God rips my soul out of this
[2:02:05] body if it's before the rapture I'm gone
[2:02:09] I'm not coming back
[2:02:11] no way
[2:02:13] this world is not my home I'm just the
[2:02:17] passing through my treasures are laid up
[2:02:20] somewhere beyond the blue Hallelujah
[2:02:25] Oh Heaven is calling us great cloud of
[2:02:28] witnesses are here this morning I think
[2:02:30] about all the saints that have gone
[2:02:31] before us cheering us on I feel it
[2:02:34] sometimes in the spirit I feel the
[2:02:37] encouragement they're real just like the
[2:02:40] angels are real

[2:03:50] of Sharon
[2:03:51] and the crushing of the Rose brought
[2:03:53] forth perfume
[2:03:55] and they put it on
[2:03:57] the oil that ran down Aaron's beard
[2:04:00] plumbed to the Hem of His Garment

[2:04:07] with that anointing oil

[2:05:55] and those who touch my anointed ones and
[2:05:58] do them harm it'd be better if Millstone
[2:06:00] was cast around their neck and be cast
[2:06:02] in the middle of the sea
[2:06:05] it was the same back in that day because
[2:06:07] that Pillar of Fire that Veil is here
[2:06:09] today
[2:06:11] it's not me it's not any one of us it's
[2:06:14] Christ
[2:06:18] you don't say nothing against me this
[2:06:20] morning
[2:06:22] you're saying against Christ the word
[2:06:26] Hallelujah
[2:06:27] let us stand invite the mission's up
[2:06:35] Hallelujah
[2:06:38] every man or boy or woman or girl that
[2:06:42] ever is Anointed of God and Walks Behind
[2:06:44] that temple veil of God the Holy Ghost
[2:06:46] puts them in a secret place that Veil
[2:06:49] drops behind him and the world and all
[2:06:52] the things of the world are cut off
[2:06:54] behind him
[2:06:57] Hallelujah
[2:06:58] that's the reason brethren
[2:07:01] that we're holding up this adoption this
[2:07:03] this rapture
[2:07:05] we got to get these differences these
[2:07:08] fussing all these things out of our
[2:07:09] lives and get that Veil drop behind us
[2:07:13] and go into the presence of God
[2:07:17] where the Shekinah Glory is
[2:07:20] Hallelujah
[2:07:22] thank you no
[2:07:24] thank you Lord the Rapture is here now
[2:07:28] in the bride the overcoming power is
[2:07:32] here now in the bride the third Paul is
[2:07:36] here operating in her in little Fashions
[2:07:40] when she prays when she speaks the word
[2:07:43] of God when she overcomes in faith it
[2:07:46] manifests itself
[2:07:48] but we're not squeeze comes on more and
[2:07:51] more that third pull is going to come to
[2:07:55] its full maturity in her when the mark
[2:07:58] of the beast starts getting this claws
[2:08:01] then you're going to see something
[2:08:05] in her rise up thou has been prophesied
[2:08:09] then she will be called the overcomer
[2:08:13] in this day and age
[2:08:15] to him that overcometh
[2:08:18] we are Overcomers
[2:08:21] there is nothing
[2:08:24] that we're not going to overcome
[2:08:27] we're going to overcome everything
[2:08:31] and the Rapture is going to prove that
[2:08:35] that nothing
[2:08:36] is going to Hold Us Down
[2:08:39] nothing this ain't gonna hold us this
[2:08:42] world ain't gonna hold us all the powers
[2:08:45] of hell ain't going to hold us
[2:08:47] for the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[2:08:49] against her
[2:08:51] nothing could harm her

[2:08:57] you are with God you and God become one
[2:09:01] and who is greater than God
[2:09:03] who can stand before God

[2:13:43] amen God bless you I'm so thankful that
[2:13:48] you could be here today and to hear this
[2:13:50] message
[2:13:51] now I want you to understand something
[2:13:55] this message that was ministered to you
[2:13:58] today
[2:13:59] was both a blessing
[2:14:02] and also a battle
[2:14:05] what you
[2:14:07] experienced and seen here today is a
[2:14:11] spiritual battle while the brother was
[2:14:14] preaching his message
[2:14:16] as he tried to deliver that message
[2:14:20] the devil of course tried to put a very
[2:14:22] oppressive Spirit down on the
[2:14:25] congregation
[2:14:27] and not only does he have to preach but
[2:14:30] you have to start understanding you need
[2:14:33] to pray and you need to push that Spirit
[2:14:36] out of here while he is waving The Sword
[2:14:40] and battling his way through it all
[2:14:43] you don't just leave the preacher or
[2:14:46] you're in a bathroom real and because
[2:14:49] one soldier Got The Bravery to run out
[2:14:52] ahead and start firing the gun you leave
[2:14:56] we all got to charge the enemy and drive
[2:15:00] him out of the camp are you willing to
[2:15:02] do that amen that's what we have to do
[2:15:05] praise God but somebody
[2:15:08] had to portray that so you can see the
[2:15:12] manifestation of the word that is put a
[2:15:16] blessing
[2:15:17] and it's also a battle
[2:15:19] and we are part of it amen we are all a
[2:15:23] part of it praise the Lord so whenever
[2:15:25] Ministry comes here
[2:15:33] brings glory to the name of the Lord but
[2:15:36] the beauty of it is that when the battle
[2:15:39] is over we will bear a crown praise the
[2:15:42] Lord hallelujah just for a short while
[2:15:44] and I'll give it over
[2:15:46] and when the battle's over
[2:15:51] we're a crown
