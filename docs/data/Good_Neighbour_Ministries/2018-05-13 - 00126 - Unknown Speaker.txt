What is Truth (1) May 13, 2018
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm not just saying I know repeating words but I know this resurrection I hope you this I woke up this morning and he was asleep that you're seeing a man I really appreciate as a ministry to really appreciate myself I did appreciate another bike because when you're a minister in your back there you're just looking for the Holy Ghost only goes to confirm the only sense or the word Amen always has for his spirit reward will come forth to prepare the hearts of the people preparing you to receive something from him not me I just want to say that because it's it just lifts our faithful if you haven't seen him moving a lot lately your might get on your knees and bring his something hallelujah shake yourself there's nothing greater than seeing the Holy Ghost in our lives Amen there's so much to say here today I said to my wife I said one day my minister next she goes all the 13th next Sunday Mother's Day order finger and she goes no fire brimstone feminine you know the movie Pollyanna every time they came out of service I said you know I said to me if brother Grantham talked about a minister he preached eight times on repentance they came to us said do you have anything else what we you know repentance is oh yeah so the people repent first we're all kinds of the suffering and the Lord will have something for you amen and hopefully it's not that bad it's Mother's Day I don't have a Mother's Day message but you know I was reading in I didn't realize brother Brennan preached the message on Mother's Day and so I went through a few things here and I just want to read a few things before I get into the message today amen because I think we should honor [Music] no thought created whether special they have a position when they're in that position I brother Mike was just saying out is being met everything understand there I really have to see when you're you know surrendered and the hands and cause there's mothers are good mothers but in the hands of God there's nobody that can pray like the mother or their children I was told my wife I pray when I get a smart but no plan no men can pray like the mother's heart can pray for their children tankini and that's us where the mother wants to be in the hands of God because that's where [Music] everybody find your positions in Christ [Music] and he will amen Jeremiah 1:5 I knew thee before I formed you in your mother's womb before you were born I set you apart and anointed you as my prophet to the nation's now I read this morning that mothers woman who are wonderfully wandering away from God that they will come to themselves this morning and will recognize that what the word mother means one who has begotten may she realized that the offsprings of her union with her husband has been sacred little jerk June James that God has placed under her the inaudible hold her responsible for the rear and raisin on those children and as the scripture says a good woman and the mother what she is about her children will call her blessed Lord would you not by no means forget to think we will forget to thank you for real brothers for we know that we have such living today real genuine mothers God bless them they are great treasures to us and we pray that you will continue to be with them Lord and may they live happy and see the fruit other rooms serving God amen that's what we want to see all our children working for me and my house we will serve the Lord I know sometimes it doesn't look that way but we look to what God word and we pray that those who wear the white robes this morning or the white flour to say that their mother has passed beyond this scene of action today may the Lord God give them the rest of peace out there leaders that will follow them Brenden Lord now take my word and speak to the people and give them comfort gather here to feel your presence to hear your word and be blessed and leave here a better man woman boys and girls that we were only after did we ask this in Jesus name I think the thoughts of mothers and I have one thing this morning by the grace of God still here on earth with us I am grateful for mother and being that we were to have also a healing service and not knowing that I would be back tonight but I thought maybe that it could paint a different picture here mothers is so great you know the first one you wear that receives you in life as your mother no one can touch you like your mother can because you're here conceived from her and she bears you under her heart and she is the first thing to know you and the first thing in this life to hold you when you're born she's the one the first hand is to touch you in white pack the tears from your eyes she's the first one to pat you and to love you and to come over you in this life is your mother now I think that there's enough there's not enough other that we could give to a mother mother's first with the child as she is great the great responsibility of what a child would be will be based upon the way the weather starts a child on the path and it must travel mothers have the responsibility from God to place that child right on and I think that's why mothers have a special touch I know the boy in the city and he goes on here just going to bypass that he goes on to talk about a man that drinks the likes older men and every time he gets drunk he still comes home and I submit mother once mother amen oh I never stop there there's so much I can read about this but we understand wonderful I have a my mother we're still alive by God's grace I had the mother my children my wife I have my daughter [Music] and be strong in the Lord be strong you [Music] are not relying on our own ability amen we're relying on him he's the one who called us amen he's the one who started to work amen he knew me when I was at my mother's move he knew he's going to call me to this I didn't ask to come to this I wasn't seeking for this this truth that we have he called he brought me to this that's my faith and that is my belief he knows the mistakes that I lived the mistakes that you will make he knows the weaknesses in your flesh but beyond all that he placed an attribute inside of you himself and he said that attribute amen will not return to b-boy but it will accomplish what I set forth to do absolute will overcome no matter what our carnal mind thinks above our selves our flesh and our weaknesses like get us down sometimes you will even write and we'll bring everything I believe with all our heart they will bring everything subject to the word of in my it will bring something that's my Amen other such dead breathe the word this morning John 18:37 see which way the Lord's I don't know which way he's gonna move this morning or what he's going to say what he's gonna do get a bow for me good sleep feeling just what a minister coaster sometimes just bring the Word of God but maybe receive it this morning that you pull out the Word of God amen I want to speak on what is truth I mean I can't really speak on what is truth right because no man has the ability to do that Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou a king then jesus answered thou says that I indicated to this end I was born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice posture setup enemy what is truth and when he has sent this he went out again unto the Jews and said unto them I find in him no fault as soon as pilot said what is truth what was he asking what is the revelation of who you are remember that is the keys of the difference appear not apart rock or church or even upon Jesus but the revelation of who Jesus was but after he just went up he went away from him so many times we see the Bible people are are covering up over some panic and just walk away and then the Adventist apply that I find in him no fault what is the truth father thank you for your love grace and mercy this world I just commit myself into your hands the people into your hands Lord what is the truth Lord you said I am the truth waiting the life father this is not placed in men's heads that never has been this has been your plan and you have been fulfilling it all down through the ages and will complete it father lord I pray that you would take every spirit sucked into the whole peoples in this place this morning something to the Word of God to you father may you bless each and every one I remember as we spoke our brothers Lord may you bless and give what they have an Edith Lord so that their children may rise up and call them blessing father taking full of us now as we place ourselves behind the cross forgive us of our sins washed us and cleanse us fully through by your precious blood and Phyllis we ask in Jesus name how do we I was wondering what I was going to speak on us week I spoke on Jesus is the truth of life and the way at the nursery and I just was prepared something else on a series that I had and just turned right around and I thought came back in my mind Jesus the truth the way in the life and so I was just you know a minister looks where the work looks for God's leading we just want to fall into a channel that he can speak and brother Phillip was preaching Wednesday night a wonderful message on making your choices near decisions determines your destination and he was preaching sit down I was get bless and then he came right over to the side here and he looked at me says that's the truth brother tip and anointing the fire of God come upon me right there he didn't know that yeah I asked about the services any remember one so God has truth God has something for us to date I collect and here in the scriptures we see what is the truth and so many people like Pontius Pilate they are asking today what is the truth and the second thing the body that you look back into the world and you see in the world amen they don't know what truth is because because they haven't been given truth well that's the sad thing about it right I growth roses on that date you're going to you know there's not the drunker that's going to be disappointed is that the gambler is going to be disappointed it's the one that is read into the church and beaten under this massive beam under which I believe is the word of God for the out I believe is a genuine true prophet of God and the word comes from I don't just say that but the holy ghost has revealed that to me straight amen that's how I believe it that the truth is what God reveals truth to me and people sit down with his ministry wandering to and fro back and forth and not knowing what truth is it's not just good enough to know the doctor it's not good enough to know the mysteries of the Prophet truth to you what is truth in your life this has to wake us up to make us realize who we are we recognize who he is you recognize who we are robots amen brother brother Krabs said brother doesn't find a bunch of robots and i repeating him and tried to interpreter or duplicate what he did but he wanted sons and daughters of god to raise up to recognize who they are but truth is that sons and daughters will come to maturity and this they could be walking talking lining herself up with the word she do now by using obey and the Spirit of God what it takes truth and text revelation into an individual life that come so that we can do that John 16:13 of it when the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come you see when the spirit of truth comes into your life now break this down personally to you that spine is very important amen people are not taken seriously enough you know in seeking for the Holy Ghost right the Holy Ghost is not just an experience is not just a baptism but the Holy Ghost is the spirit of truth comes in trials we need to seek for truth we have a lot we have a journey that we're on we have situations in our lives totally we have things that we see about ourselves weaknesses about ourselves amen we going on we need and we have to overcome certain things in our office as God reveals it to us we need truth as individuals hey men and John 8:32 you breathe for me to find a channel of the Lord I'm trusting in him John 8:32 and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen no other way where the sphere of truth comes into our lives it will reveal all things to us that we need to know and we not true cons and only when that food comes it sets us free amen hallelujah jesus said in John 14:6 Thomas in up the hip Lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the weight jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the Father but by me if he had known me yet should I have known my father you know me and from henceforth you know him and have seen him the Lord Jesus said I am the light of the world John 8:12 he said I am the truth Jesus tells the Lord's tell us in the Lord's work also of all truth according to the Bible the Lord is the light and and the word and the word which is also the truth is light in the loop in the word there is light there are the word and the light and the truth are one team John 14:1 1:14 speaks of the word becoming flesh tabernacle amongst us full of grace and truth speaks of the law that was given through Moses but grace and truth through Jesus Christ when we believe that the Lord Jesus we received grace and truth and the first pissed off John is says God is love and God is light when God comes to us we receive grace but we go to him he is love grace is the realization and the expression of love loves the source and grace of expression likewise truth is the realization an expression of light light is the source and truth is the expression but light is concealed from us is nearly light but when it shines upon us it becomes truth whatever light shines we receive truth light shines in darkness verses psychic Timothy the two books dealing with a deviation of truth is mentioned often because in this period of darkness there is a need for the light to shine and express truth is the shining light wherever there is light there is God God is light yayin Romans 8 all encourages us to walk according to the but John and the second third epistle also says in the time of darkness walk in the truth although in this other writings John emphasizes light to these to hit missiles he speaks much of up truth and if you go back to the book of John you'll see he speaks a lot about the truth I have no greater joy than these things that I hear my children out lock it in the truth whenever we are in times of darkness we need that light to shine so we may walk in the proper way amen hallelujah glory to God pops the question what is truth many people today are asking what is truth inside the Bible there are many stories and God reveals many things to us about this world the lust and the heat decline but the Bible tells the truth about the good the bad and the ugly the Bible tells the truth about Satan and his deception amen Jesus wasn't afraid to call seasoned a liar and the father of lies either so many people are afraid the truth that's right above us taking place out there tell them the truth about sing but it's the truth Jesus wasn't afraid he says with the devil speaks he speaks on his own resources he's a liar and the father of it the first time that a man have to make a choice between God's truth and the devil's lie he choose that that was high amen so many times we get caught between the crossfire there's always the two voices speaking to you in your life one place is the voice of God which is truth will lead you down a certain path yes the voice is the voice lies amen the voice of God will always lead you to overcome to prosper to grow Puglia to go forward in your walk with Christ the other voice that you listen to the voice of lies will always cause you eyes and mouth scars whenever the rejected God's truth and accepted that was lies at that moment all the trouble in the whole world begin our sinful nature decides that that was lie instead of God's truth that's the battle that is going on you got to realize what is truth and the truth the body that your eliminates the pest house the cart of mine that founds against the spiritual mind is at enmity with God so every day of your life that you wake up every choice that you make every and we try resurface that you come and base within your life you're faced with these to the flesh and the spirit they're making choices all the time as brother Phillip 7 on Wednesday that will determine your destination and that will determine your walk determine what you will become no God trying to bring his children bring them to a place to make the right choices in their life the choose the truth but you must not the truth you must know that your greatest enemies not your brother and sister your greatest enemies yourself amen it's yourself we're so worried about keeping everybody in line the discusses we're so worried about this person say this person saying that are judging this person are criticizing that person are doing [Music] you become nothing and you realize they but you realize when you're nothing you got no right to look at anybody else that's right citizen disease that affects the entire human race the disease of sin is in the heart of the troubles of the world so those involved in this dying world Satan will come up with his evil this even power or they have refused the truth which good we don't want to refuse the truth we have been given a message with a lot of truth about who we are where we're going about us plan our lives what he wants to do amen and we want to receive that we want to surrender our lives to that I mean we don't say but to actually do it pay the price with your husband with your wife your children this pay the price with God love your knees with God that's right document truth truth the surrogacy you know I just heard believers we know this now the devil come down and got into the circuit and he found Eve in the Garden of Eden taking you see the lusts of the demon devil demon surplus and he talked about the fruit and the myths means the middle as so far if you understand so makes congregation who swore to be sane it's good to the eyes what did he do he began to make their love to eat and he lived with her as a husband as she saw it was pleasant so she went and told her husband but she was already pregnant by Satan and she brought forth her first son whose name is Kane the son of Satan that's true that's why we were in the condition that were you but the world over see this truth this is Jesus they have another Jesus even the churches have to have another Jesus now you say that's wrong all right I'll just find out whether it's wrong or not I will put enmity between nicey and the Serpent's eat what the circus eat she had a seed and he hid in the seed and he shall bruise thy head and you shall bruise his heel and the bruise there means to me Anatoli now there is common now this serpent when he stood there this great big chunk of a fellow stood up he was guilty of committed adultery without his wife their sin lies today you say relative I know he said I was naked and he said who told you you were naked well the woman you gave me done it she was the one that persuaded me and she said the serpent gave me an apple our reckon creatures get next to yourself she said the serpent economy do you know what be got means he defied as she was that that will never gave her an apple the serpent legality and then the curse came you see this is still a reflection in our everyday life every you see what what what how's this I know this story I believe that but how does it reflection every time you listened to the spirit of lives every time you listen to the devil it produced this it's just a simple you know eat listen one word one word and caused all this trouble it caused this trouble that we're bouncing right now one word break it down into our lives you shall know the truth by what the truth the truth we won't be free don't we we want to have to joy that happiness and the prosperity of the Lord we want the Lord just to bring things in our lives all we need to listen to the right voice we need to make the right choices in our eyes amen hallelujah because you listen to the circuit instead of your husband you took light of the world and you multiply in sorrow and in conception and so forth and because you listened to your wife the husbands wives listen to your husband's husband's I listen to your eyes listen to God when it comes to revelations I think when it comes to your position I can take advice from my wife and she helps me in many ways that I don't have the ability to do certain things but when it comes to Revelation when it comes to the Holy Ghost why got chosen that way because what happened here that's why but this is the world but receive this as an audience women are God's out there they're leaders out there they don't want to come subject to this amen because you listen to your wife will suddenly I take you from the dust of the high species back to the touch you know and then to the circuit I'll take off your legs upon your belly all the days of your life and thus shall you eat as your meat and you shall be hated there you are there is a men in Noah's day Genesis 6:5 and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination and thought of his heart was only evil continually by the earth was so corrupt before God the earth was filled with violence and he looked upon it and it was all the flesh was corrupt in their ways about here and to 27 even as some of the war of the cities themselves were given over to fornication and going after strange flesh and set for an example of sufferance of vengeance of eternal fire as we can see in the world today that's the days of Noah the wickedness with the thoughts of men continually evil as a derived each out there the earth was corrupt and filled with violence we can see that this region as blacks pull a lot state sensual reality and homosexuality has taken control of the people of South Jesus tells us and these things would combine and all happen in the last days as wasn't Noah and in the days of lot they were combined and we see it here today have we seen is taking place that is true amen but there's privacy connected to that truth to the bride of Jesus Christ there was something when you see that taking place and happening there's something taking place in the front of Jesus Christ that we need to recognize and realize you know that was given in Harrison head and taken American woman you know that was the last sin that was the class when the was full in that day that God rain down fire upon them when

evils of homosexuality [Music] [Music] this is a lot you wrestle with that [Music] hallelujah now entertained by the various things that got destroyed the old oral the Sun or the deeds of blocks the same thing is happening in the world today the people are dull here the truth my what a sad thing when the people in this message can come to a place where the ears have a dollop hear the truth truth of people are is interpreted many different ways you know people think their truth Everest right for you whatever is good for you whatever you feel right for you that's not the voice of truth that's the more supply some whatever works for you it's not whatever makes you feel right or feel good sometimes the truth makes you feel it does makes you feel back it brings you to a place of side makes you feel safe and effective no look what you've done don't work where you made time to do the truth hurts imagine hurts real bad hey but you know I must speak the truth to you you know God speaking to you is that what I have to say what the Spirit of God say to you he can be convicted you and speaking to you certain thing in your life because that's what we believe in the supernatural we believe God is here revealing no man needs to teach you I can teach you how can I teach you about yourself what I eat the Holy Ghost teach me about me the Spirit of God spirit [Music] or interpretations and we give to a place of the use and surrender to nixsboys these are all connected to prophecy and the end time that we're getting to and that day you just take a look around on the TV you'll see everything violence corruption God's Spirit is still striving with men to get picked men of sin and to turn to Christ and obey Him Wow a lot of suffering of God in the days of Noah but it also says he will not strive with men always there will come a time where the door be closed in the days of Noah the ark came a time with the door closed amen I'm going to be in now I know I'm in them I'm just saying that I don't want to know what would you do you know that you're in or you convinced because you bleed the best are you convinced religious or you convinced because you know brother Craddock said you can quote everything that he said that's why you're convinced or do you know that you know that the Spirit of God just like in Jesus and perfectly to talk about he knew who he was he knew his position that's what gave him perfect faith he knew that he was called he knew he was the Anointed One and that's where the bride has to come to
