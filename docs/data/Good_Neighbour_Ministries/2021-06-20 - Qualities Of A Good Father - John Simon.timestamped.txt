[0:14] good morning friends
[0:17] how good it is for brethren to dwell
[0:21] together
[0:21] in unity it's a marvelous thing
[0:26] when we come together again
[0:29] in our father's name to worship him and
[0:32] to give him glory honor and praise
[0:36] may the lord richly bless us
[0:39] all today which is considered
[0:43] as father's day a day
[0:47] when fathers are revered
[0:50] and fathers are praised
[0:54] and recognized for their
[0:57] positions and for their
[1:01] work uh their contributions
[1:04] to their families and to society
[1:08] may god bless every father
[1:13] christian and otherwise bless him with
[1:16] salvation
[1:18] bless him with the joy
[1:21] of life and joy of his family
[1:25] may the great holy spirit of god
[1:28] take the word of god and
[1:31] apply it to our hearts
[1:35] and our lives so that we may be
[1:38] able to have a road map
[1:42] to live by may god bless us all
[1:46] as we enter into the scriptures
[1:51] matthew chapter 6
[1:55] reading verse 9.
[1:58] now in this verse the disciples
[2:03] early in their time with jesus
[2:08] they heard him praying and praying
[2:10] different times praying
[2:13] and so they asked him
[2:16] this timeless question lord
[2:21] teach us to pray and jesus responded
[2:26] with these words that we find
[2:30] in matthew 6 verse
[2:34] 9.
[2:37] after this manner therefore
[2:40] pray ye
[2:44] our father which art
[2:48] in heaven hallowed
[2:51] be thy name
[2:54] let's read the next verse thy kingdom
[2:58] come thy will be done
[3:02] in earth as it is
[3:06] in heaven may god bless the reading
[3:09] of his word to our hearts here today
[3:12] blessed be god our heavenly father
[3:15] who has given us this word
[3:18] to feed on as children of the living god
[3:24] today we would like to talk about
[3:27] qualities of a good father
[3:32] qualities of a good father and of course
[3:37] if we are to discuss
[3:40] or talk about the qualities of a good
[3:43] father
[3:45] god comes into perspective
[3:48] right then for he is the perfect father
[3:54] that is the reason why the lord jesus
[3:57] himself
[3:58] said our heavenly
[4:02] father praise god
[4:05] we love the words that wonderful song
[4:09] we have a heavenly father up above
[4:14] oh my his eyes full of mercy
[4:18] and his heart is full of love oh praise
[4:21] god
[4:23] thank you lord for being our heavenly
[4:26] father
[4:27] and we call him our father because of
[4:30] our
[4:31] relationship with him
[4:34] we have a relationship with him
[4:38] through the recognition
[4:42] of the holy spirit by revelation
[4:46] of the word we call him our heavenly
[4:50] father because we
[4:52] now recognize
[4:56] we came from him and we recognize
[5:00] on earth we recognize the one
[5:03] on earth that we came from
[5:08] in heaven we recognize god
[5:12] our lord jesus christ as our
[5:15] heavenly father praise god
[5:19] and so we are using today
[5:24] this wonderful uh relationship
[5:29] and fellowship that
[5:32] exists or should exist between
[5:35] a father and his children
[5:40] and so when we look into the
[5:44] bible which is the written
[5:47] word of god we find that god
[5:51] being the perfect parent the perfect
[5:54] father
[5:55] then we should use him of course as our
[5:59] pattern
[6:01] and we find first of all
[6:05] when we look at god then we want to
[6:09] take those qualities and place them
[6:12] on an earthly father and thereby
[6:17] present to you the qualities
[6:20] of a good father if it's good for god
[6:24] it's good for me and so we find a good
[6:27] father
[6:29] loves and cares for his own he cares for
[6:32] his children
[6:35] and it's a horrible thing when
[6:39] a man does not care
[6:42] for his children i've said
[6:46] to my own church and to my own people
[6:48] from time to time
[6:51] that there are good fathers and there
[6:53] are bad fathers
[6:56] and uh in this we
[7:00] find out we are living in an age
[7:03] when uh people have lost
[7:07] the vision or the pattern
[7:10] of who and what is a good father
[7:16] and we find that being a good father is
[7:19] just
[7:21] being able to equate one's self with the
[7:24] fact that they're
[7:26] able to bear or to have a child
[7:29] or children or many children
[7:32] and uh but as i've said and will say
[7:36] again
[7:37] that is only proving to the world that
[7:40] you are
[7:41] male that you are a man
[7:45] that you have the ability to produce
[7:48] children
[7:49] but fatherhood is different
[7:52] from that that doesn't make you a father
[7:56] that just identifies you that you
[8:00] are male and that you are a man
[8:03] but fatherhood now is taking the
[8:07] responsibility
[8:08] over those children that
[8:12] you have issued forth into this world
[8:16] and they're here coming from you
[8:19] because just like us
[8:23] we were once in god
[8:26] we were hid in the mind of god
[8:29] and we have no recollection of it
[8:32] we have no memory of it we can't
[8:35] remember it we can't think about it
[8:38] but we know from the word of god
[8:42] and from present truth that we were once
[8:46] in the mind of god
[8:50] just as we were in
[8:53] our dads our fathers
[8:56] we were in their loins
[9:00] we have no awareness no consciousness
[9:05] of that but we know we were there
[9:08] if we were not there then we could not
[9:12] be here if we were not in god
[9:16] then we could not be revealed at this
[9:19] time
[9:20] as a manifested son
[9:24] a manifested child of the living god
[9:29] but we were in him so
[9:32] you see a good father
[9:37] is one that after his kids
[9:40] are made manifest uh
[9:43] to his eyes to his sight then
[9:47] he wants to take that baby he wants to
[9:50] take that child
[9:53] and to love it and to care for it
[9:57] in every possible way oh i'm so
[10:01] glad that we have someone to care
[10:06] i've sung it i've said it and we'll say
[10:08] it again
[10:10] someone to care
[10:14] someone to share all your struggles
[10:19] like no other can do
[10:23] he'll come down from the skies
[10:27] wipe the tears from your
[10:30] eyes you're his child
[10:34] and he cares for
[10:37] you first peter chapter 5
[10:42] verse 7 says casting all your
[10:46] cares upon him for he
[10:49] care it for you yes he
[10:52] cares for you through sunshine or rain
[10:57] through darkness through pain he
[11:00] cares for you no wonder jesus said
[11:03] cast all your cares upon me
[11:06] amen oh praise god
[11:09] may you take your troubles your problems
[11:14] your sickness your sorrows your
[11:16] temptations
[11:17] your grief your repressions whatever
[11:21] they may be cast your
[11:24] cares upon him for he cares for you
[11:29] i'm so glad that we have a heavenly
[11:32] father
[11:33] up above and that heavenly father
[11:37] cares for us the devil will
[11:40] want to make you question that
[11:44] many times he'll try to test you
[11:47] try you for you to question that
[11:50] whether god cares whether god
[11:53] really loves you but i'm here today to
[11:57] say amen that he cares
[12:00] and he loves and cares for his
[12:04] own he loves his children hallelujah
[12:08] amen so a good father
[12:12] cares for his children
[12:16] and then since he cares for his children
[12:19] a good father protects his children
[12:25] jesus protected us
[12:28] jesus kept us out from of hell
[12:32] jesus gave his all for us
[12:36] he spread his arms through
[12:39] art to heaven as the bridge of life
[12:43] and there he allowed himself to be
[12:46] nailed to the cross for us
[12:50] the old song says he was nailed to the
[12:54] cross
[12:54] for me he was nailed
[12:58] to the cross for you and i and that is
[13:01] how much
[13:03] a father a good father
[13:06] should love his children and
[13:09] protect his children in every way
[13:13] and to stand as a buffer as a protector
[13:17] as god is our shield so a father
[13:21] ought to be a shield to the evils
[13:25] that will attack his children that
[13:28] is what fatherhood is about and that is
[13:32] another quality of a good father
[13:35] listen to the word of god amen
[13:39] but those who are matthew 18
[13:42] 6 but whoso shall offend
[13:46] one of these little ones which
[13:50] believe in me it were
[13:53] better for him that the millstone
[13:56] were hanged about his neck
[14:00] and that he were drowned
[14:03] in the depths of the sea
[14:06] god protects his own
[14:10] remember there's another scripture where
[14:12] the lord said
[14:13] touch not my anointed
[14:17] do my prophets no harm amen
[14:20] for god is watching over his own
[14:24] like an eagle fluttering over its nest
[14:28] watching over its young protecting his
[14:32] young amen glory to god
[14:35] god watching over his household
[14:38] and nothing can touch them nothing can
[14:41] do
[14:41] anything to them we all we have
[14:44] many times told the story
[14:49] of how the great eagle
[14:52] what's come and picked the little
[14:56] eaglets up from the nest place them
[15:00] on her wings and then
[15:03] they fly right down to the valley floor
[15:07] and then that father sits in a rock that
[15:10] mother sits on a rock
[15:12] high up on the mountainside
[15:16] and watching those little ones
[15:19] playing in the valley floor and even so
[15:24] my friends while they're playing having
[15:27] fun with one another if
[15:30] a fox if a wolf if
[15:33] any mountain lion or some other wild
[15:38] creature
[15:38] were to be drawing near to attack them
[15:42] they are not caring they cast their care
[15:45] on their mother
[15:46] their cast their care on their father
[15:49] they're not worried
[15:51] because they're trusting in their
[15:53] heavenly father
[15:54] their father is up above when they
[15:58] look up and they see their father
[16:01] sitting on that rock with those evil
[16:04] eyes
[16:05] looking around and looking down at them
[16:09] they know they are safe because if any
[16:12] danger was to come to them he would be
[16:16] swooping down with the wings of an
[16:18] eagle and the talons of an eagle to
[16:21] protect his own
[16:22] and that is our god who is our refuge
[16:26] and our strength our god our help
[16:30] does not come from the earth but our
[16:32] help
[16:33] comes from above our help comes
[16:36] from the holy hills of heaven our
[16:39] help comes from our god amen
[16:43] and he's watching over us every step we
[16:46] make every move everything we do
[16:50] he's watching over us brother sister
[16:53] don't fear don't worry don't get
[16:56] into a into a worked up back state
[17:00] but remain calm confident
[17:04] resting and relying and trusting
[17:08] in the lord amen for all
[17:11] things all a-l-l
[17:14] all things whether they appear good or
[17:17] bad
[17:18] will work together for good
[17:21] to them that love the lord god
[17:25] protects his own and a good father
[17:30] will always seek to protect his child
[17:34] amen praise god a good father
[17:38] also provides for his child
[17:43] but god provides for us
[17:46] philippians 4 19 says
[17:51] but my god shall supply
[17:56] all your needs according to his
[17:59] riches in glory by christ jesus
[18:04] god will supply
[18:09] all your needs no wonder jesus prayed
[18:13] give us this day our daily bread
[18:18] hallelujah brother sister
[18:21] god has promised us our daily bread
[18:24] and we should expect that god will
[18:28] provide for us amen
[18:31] god will take care of his children
[18:34] and provide for his children all their
[18:38] needs will be provided by
[18:41] him we are in his care we are
[18:44] in his watchful care we are in his
[18:48] tender care
[18:49] and our heavenly father watches
[18:52] over me glory to god a
[18:56] good father
[19:00] always provides for his children
[19:04] we're so called today there are men
[19:10] of all stripes older men middle-aged men
[19:13] young men that just go around
[19:17] producing children but they don't
[19:20] provide for them
[19:22] and they thought what to provide for
[19:25] them
[19:26] oh but our god regardless
[19:30] provides for his children he doesn't
[19:33] care
[19:34] where they are he will watch over them
[19:38] and he will provide for them
[19:42] but we living in a day now when they can
[19:45] desert that
[19:46] mother with our children
[19:49] desert those children forget about them
[19:53] heartless cruel
[19:56] without that goodness of a good father
[19:59] who will provide for
[20:02] his own and will protect
[20:06] his own yes my friends
[20:09] no good father will walk away
[20:14] and leave his children without
[20:17] his protection no way
[20:20] will he do that but we have promised in
[20:23] the bible
[20:25] that as it was in the days of noah
[20:29] so shall it be in this day
[20:32] of the coming of the son of man
[20:35] he says they took unto themselves
[20:39] women that took to themselves
[20:42] amen and so that's what we see
[20:46] today there is a lot of so-called
[20:49] common law not god's law
[20:53] not god's word not god's way
[20:56] but common law relationships
[21:01] and this is anyone is free to
[21:05] live that way the government allows it
[21:09] and no one could say anything about it
[21:11] unless
[21:12] i am telling you from the word of god
[21:15] god
[21:16] said it would repeat again
[21:19] in this day that men
[21:22] would just be living with women
[21:25] living with them and that is all
[21:30] no real marriage relationship
[21:33] no real god's approval
[21:37] uh as long as they have proof of it they
[21:39] think it's all right
[21:40] but according to this bible according to
[21:44] god's word my friends
[21:47] god is the one that instituted marriage
[21:50] and one should not just go take a woman
[21:54] have children
[21:54] all over the place that's nothing but an
[21:58] unclean spirit that is resting on a
[22:01] person
[22:02] that will do something like that and the
[22:05] thing to do
[22:06] to cleanse yourself from the filth
[22:10] of an unclean spirit is to repent
[22:14] turn your heart and your life to god
[22:18] and may he take control of your
[22:22] entire life that you may walk out in the
[22:25] newness of life
[22:27] with a new vision with a new purpose
[22:31] to fulfill your way and your position
[22:34] of who you are in jesus christ
[22:39] a good father doesn't only
[22:43] bring his children into this world
[22:48] but a good father tries to guide them
[22:52] and to teach them and he does that
[22:56] by word and he does it by
[23:00] example or action and so
[23:03] a good father always does that
[23:06] he models a behavior that he like his
[23:10] children to pick up
[23:12] and before that before that he
[23:15] he does these things or he'll say
[23:18] certain things to them
[23:19] over and over again so that they will
[23:22] remember
[23:23] what their father said and many of us
[23:27] while i'm speaking here can think about
[23:30] our own father
[23:31] and remember clearly some
[23:35] of the statements that he made
[23:38] over and over it stuck with us
[23:41] uh it's stuck in our memory and so our
[23:44] father has a great responsibility
[23:49] to guide his children
[23:52] and to teach his children for god
[23:56] promised in his word john
[23:59] 14 26 but the
[24:02] comforter which is the holy ghost
[24:07] whom the father will send in my name
[24:10] he shall teach you all things
[24:14] and oh bring all things to your
[24:16] remembrance
[24:18] whatsoever i have said
[24:21] unto you so god teaches his children
[24:25] god guides his children as he did with
[24:28] the pillar of fire
[24:30] god guides us by
[24:33] his word through revelation
[24:37] for the god's word
[24:40] is a light onto our feet and
[24:43] a lamp onto our path and god's word
[24:47] revealed to us
[24:48] is that light and that lamp by which we
[24:52] are guided
[24:53] and we are taught by the blessed holy
[24:56] spirit
[24:57] and god being our perfect heavenly
[25:00] father
[25:01] a good father taking that example
[25:05] will guide his children and
[25:08] teach his children by example
[25:13] a brother was recently reminding me
[25:17] of a story i told some time ago
[25:21] of how this father was a great drinker
[25:25] he loved alcohol
[25:29] he loved the bars he loved the friends
[25:33] the laughter the smoke
[25:35] the atmosphere loose men
[25:39] loose women loose talking
[25:42] in the bar they call he called that
[25:45] freedom
[25:47] but anyway he loved the bars
[25:50] and so this one winter night
[25:54] he was home with his wife
[25:59] and with his child little boy
[26:04] and while there had the craving for
[26:07] drink
[26:09] and so he decided he was going to go
[26:13] to the bar and
[26:16] have himself some drinks
[26:19] before coming home
[26:22] and so he left to go to the bar
[26:27] and walking in the snow
[26:32] down the pathway of that home
[26:37] and he sensed as if there was someone
[26:40] following him and he looked back
[26:46] and to his surprise there was
[26:50] his little child
[26:53] wearing a pair of his
[26:57] boots and trying to
[27:01] walk in his father's footsteps
[27:04] but of course his legs were too short
[27:07] but he was
[27:08] making the attempt to walk in the
[27:11] imprints
[27:12] of his father's footsteps
[27:15] in the snow and when that
[27:18] dad that father looked back and he saw
[27:21] that
[27:22] it sucked touched his heart it broke his
[27:25] heart
[27:26] that he turned back picked up the boy
[27:29] headed back to the home
[27:31] in tears and asked his wife to
[27:34] lead him to christ that he might know
[27:37] him
[27:37] all my friends even so
[27:40] brother sister we may not know they're
[27:44] watching
[27:45] they're listening to us wow
[27:49] we are to guide them and teach them
[27:52] but what are we teaching them by
[27:55] what we say we teaching them are we
[27:59] teaching them to swear
[28:00] are we teaching them to curse are we
[28:03] teaching them to lie
[28:05] are we teaching them negative things
[28:09] are we teaching them by our actions are
[28:13] we teaching them to
[28:14] fight the fuss oh frank to worry
[28:19] what are we teaching them and so
[28:22] my friends this father realized
[28:25] that he was leading his son to the bar
[28:29] rooms to a life that would be a life of
[28:33] reckon of shame and so he turned
[28:36] back and gave his life to christ may
[28:39] some father hear me today and
[28:42] turn his life to christ give his heart
[28:45] over to the lord and may jesus take
[28:48] control of your life
[28:49] that you may be a good father
[28:53] a worthy father a responsible father
[28:57] and that god will be able to bless you
[29:00] and use you for his glory amen praise
[29:04] god hallelujah amen
[29:07] yes sir what are we teaching them
[29:10] what are we what examples are we
[29:13] providing to them

[29:44] the god of heaven will help you listen
[29:47] my brother sister
[29:49] oh when your child is running towards
[29:53] you and they slip and fall

[30:06] them
[30:07] for bruising their knees you know whip
[30:10] them
[30:10] for falling off they swing oh my
[30:14] they may get in the swing of the world
[30:16] and they fall off
[30:18] or they get in the crowd and run
[30:21] and the next thing you know they fall
[30:23] and they bruise their knees
[30:25] you must recognize they're wrong
[30:28] but you don't whip them my friends
[30:31] for falling you know whip them
[30:35] in any way for bruising their knees
[30:38] because that is a teachable moment there
[30:41] is
[30:41] something for them to learn from that
[30:45] we pick them up we brush them
[30:48] off we dress the one the best we can
[30:52] and they we put them to rise and try
[30:56] again
[30:56] and so a good father will
[31:00] guide and teach his child
[31:03] and a good father will help his
[31:06] child and brush the dust of life
[31:10] from off of them psalm chapter 46
[31:14] verse 1. god
[31:18] is our refuge and our
[31:21] strength our
[31:24] very present help in the time of trouble
[31:29] we have help in the time of trouble
[31:33] and our god is our help in the time of
[31:36] trouble
[31:37] are you in trouble are you in
[31:41] a black hole are you in a pit
[31:45] my friends and this hour
[31:48] god is your refuge
[31:51] and your strength a very present help
[31:55] in the time of trouble he'll take you
[31:58] out
[31:59] as this old song said got any rivers
[32:02] you think are impossible
[32:06] got any mountains you can't tunnel true
[32:10] our god specializes in
[32:14] things that are impossible and he will
[32:16] help you
[32:17] he will bring you through for he is a
[32:20] very present help in the time
[32:24] of trouble blessed be the name of our
[32:28] god a good father
[32:32] will not put down his child
[32:35] you see there
[32:38] are many parents
[32:42] and many fathers in particular
[32:47] that tried to raise their child
[32:50] but while raising them they put them
[32:53] down at the same time
[32:55] and they use statements like oh
[32:58] you're not a monk to anything you're no
[33:02] good
[33:03] this boy is bad that girl is horrible
[33:09] she won't get anywhere in life
[33:12] she is this she is that always
[33:16] discouraging and putting their child
[33:19] down
[33:20] calling them all kinds of names telling
[33:23] them
[33:24] they're useless oh my
[33:27] oh friends we should not engage in
[33:30] anything of that nature
[33:32] for god tries to lift us up
[33:35] god tries to encourage us god tries to
[33:39] straighten us
[33:40] amen he is our invisible backer
[33:43] and he's always behind us to help us
[33:47] when we fall to help us when we awake
[33:50] to help us in every aspect of human life
[33:54] i'm speaking about the qualities of a
[33:57] good father
[33:59] trusting god that you will have those
[34:02] qualities
[34:03] and if you do not have all of these
[34:06] qualities
[34:07] you will ask god to help you
[34:10] with them amen but a good father
[34:14] will not discourage his children
[34:17] he will lift them up will not call them
[34:20] names
[34:21] will not put them down will not
[34:24] embarrass them in front
[34:26] of their friends or in front of the
[34:28] neighborhood
[34:30] or in front of anybody for that matter
[34:33] but will try to encourage them in every
[34:36] way
[34:37] now watch colossians chapter 3
[34:41] verse 21
[34:44] fathers provoke not your children
[34:48] to anger lest they be discouraged
[34:53] you know adults can literally provoke
[34:58] a little child take advantage of them
[35:03] by provoking them by
[35:06] doing and saying things that can get
[35:09] your own child angry
[35:11] and the bible says fathers you are not
[35:15] to provoke your children
[35:17] but to encourage them you are not to
[35:20] discourage your children
[35:22] but to lift up them lift them up and to
[35:25] point them
[35:26] in the right and in the proper way
[35:30] now a good father also will discipline
[35:33] his children
[35:35] not dr swiss seuss
[35:39] method we are not to follow just
[35:44] dr seuss doctor this
[35:48] this other professor they may have good
[35:51] remarks
[35:52] that they may make but our eyes
[35:55] should be upon the blueprint of god's
[35:58] word
[36:00] for god is the greatest child
[36:03] trainer god is the best
[36:07] upbringer god is the best
[36:10] sheep razor god is the one
[36:13] where to look to him for we have a
[36:16] heavenly father
[36:18] up above eyes full of mercy
[36:22] and a heart that is full of love
[36:25] god that cares for his own o blessed be
[36:29] the name of god
[36:30] amen yes sir you know
[36:33] these various doctors and writers of
[36:37] child rearing books will tell you
[36:40] oh you you should not really uh
[36:44] discipline the child uh with the with
[36:47] their
[36:47] switcher or something of that nature you
[36:50] should not
[36:51] touch them you should only speak to them
[36:54] and when you speak do not speak
[36:57] with a stern tone because it may
[37:00] hurt them emotionally in some way
[37:04] or the other but my friends i'm telling
[37:06] you
[37:07] it never hurt me it didn't hurt me
[37:10] emotionally
[37:11] or in any other way amen because
[37:14] god in his word tells us what we are to
[37:18] do
[37:19] he says a foolish father or
[37:22] mother foolish when you do
[37:25] not discipline your children amen
[37:29] whoa listen to the word of god amen
[37:33] clearly hebrews chapter 12
[37:36] verses 5 to
[37:40] 11 amen
[37:43] praise god now
[37:47] and you have forgotten the exhortation
[37:50] which speaketh unto you as children
[37:54] my son despise not
[37:58] thou the chastening of the lord
[38:02] nor faint when thou art rebuked
[38:06] of him for whom the lord
[38:10] love it he disciplines
[38:14] he chasten it and scourge at
[38:18] every son whom he received
[38:21] every child of god is going to be tested
[38:24] it's going to be disciplined it's going
[38:27] to be touched by god
[38:29] amen for whom the lord
[38:32] love it in other words if parents love
[38:35] their children
[38:36] they're not going to lose them to the
[38:38] foolishness of just psychology
[38:41] but they will take the word of god
[38:45] that says we ought to discipline our
[38:47] children
[38:49] for he those whom he loves he chastens
[38:53] amen now if we endure chastening
[38:59] god dealt with us as
[39:02] with sons for what son
[39:05] is he whom the father chasteneth
[39:09] not for they verily
[39:12] for a few days chastened us
[39:15] after their own pleasure but
[39:18] he for our prophet in other words
[39:21] the discipline is for your prophet
[39:26] is for your for you to profit or to
[39:29] learn
[39:29] something oh yes oh praise god
[39:34] that we might be partakers
[39:37] of his holiness furthermore
[39:41] we have had fathers of our flesh
[39:44] who corrected us if your father loves
[39:48] you your mother loves you
[39:49] they'll correct you in every possible
[39:52] way
[39:53] and we give them reverence
[39:57] respects for shall we not
[40:00] much more rather be in subjection
[40:04] unto the father of all spirits our
[40:07] heavenly father
[40:08] amen and live now
[40:11] no chastening no discipline
[40:15] seem it for the present time to be
[40:18] joyous
[40:20] but grievous god you tried you tested
[40:24] you chastened it's grievous you feel it
[40:28] to the bone
[40:29] but nevertheless afterwards
[40:32] it yielded the peaceable fruit
[40:36] of righteousness unto them
[40:39] which are exercised thereby amen
[40:43] praise be to god a good father
[40:47] will discipline his child
[40:50] many examples of fathers in the bible
[40:54] who did not discipline their children
[40:56] and you may
[40:57] read the scriptures and see the various
[41:01] examples in the word of god
[41:03] but god being our perfect father
[41:06] disciplines his children and said even
[41:09] your
[41:10] earthly father knows that correcting his
[41:13] children is good for them and the
[41:17] children
[41:18] also know it for later on
[41:21] they turn around and reverence
[41:24] or respect their father because
[41:28] of the correction that he gave
[41:31] now make no mistake about it when i
[41:34] speak about disciplining our children
[41:40] and correcting our children
[41:43] i have no thought i'm not projecting the
[41:46] idea
[41:48] and even some in the religious realm
[41:52] have the wrong idea which turns
[41:55] discipline into child abuse
[41:59] we are not here for the purpose
[42:02] of child abuse but there is
[42:06] appropriate measured
[42:09] discipline and corrective
[42:13] action as displayed
[42:16] in the word of god and we
[42:19] must and should obey the word of god
[42:24] and we will see the good results of it
[42:27] when we stay close to god's word i
[42:30] repeat
[42:32] we are here not to abuse our children
[42:36] not to go against what the word of god
[42:41] says
[42:42] not against what the law says
[42:46] as long as this law lines up with god's
[42:49] word
[42:50] we are for that law amen
[42:53] but our faith is with the word of god
[42:55] but the
[42:56] faith that is in the word of god does
[43:00] not recommend or speak of
[43:03] any form of child abuse
[43:06] and it's any real father or parent
[43:10] mother our father that really and truly
[43:13] loves their children will discipline
[43:16] them
[43:17] in an appropriate measured fashion
[43:21] just so that they could can learn
[43:24] and profit from the teaching
[43:28] and guidance that they receive
[43:33] also another quality of a good father
[43:37] a good father feeds his children
[43:41] but god himself matthew chapter 4
[43:44] verse 4 and he answered them and said
[43:49] it is written men shall
[43:52] not live by bread alone
[43:55] but by every word that proceedeth
[44:00] out of the mouth of god and of course
[44:03] you see the symbiology and the typology
[44:07] in his feeding of the five thousand
[44:10] and the three multitudes of five
[44:12] thousand and three thousand
[44:14] god feeds his children god
[44:18] provides for them housing food
[44:23] and clothing and he makes sure
[44:27] that they're taken care of don't call
[44:30] yourself a good father
[44:34] if you're not doing those basic
[44:37] fundamental things
[44:40] and in some form or the other
[44:43] some level high or low doesn't matter
[44:47] as long as we fulfill the
[44:50] guidance that we have been given in the
[44:53] word of god
[44:55] so a good father will feed his children
[44:58] god
[44:59] feeds us daily upon the
[45:02] living bread of his word but he said
[45:06] listen
[45:07] you should not live by bread alone which
[45:10] is saying
[45:11] man should live by bread man
[45:14] should live on his natural food for
[45:17] natural food holds body and soul
[45:20] together
[45:21] so you can worship god but don't just
[45:24] eat natural food
[45:26] and not take in the spiritual food which
[45:29] is very
[45:30] important because if you go
[45:33] one entire day or
[45:36] week without food
[45:40] you're going to be weak amen
[45:43] and this one preacher once said
[45:47] seven days without prayer makes one week
[45:51] weak w-e-a-k right so
[45:54] one got to be careful let us feed upon
[45:57] the word of god
[45:59] from which we receive our strength glory
[46:02] to god
[46:04] then a good father
[46:08] will pl has plans for his children
[46:12] jeremiah 29 11.
[46:19] for you know the plans i have for you
[46:22] god has plans for us friends
[46:25] plans and it goes on in that scripture
[46:28] to say
[46:29] blends the prosper you
[46:32] the the new international version
[46:35] gives it clear god has plans for you
[46:40] and the father will plan
[46:43] for his children whether by day
[46:46] night early morning whatever he's
[46:48] thinking of his children he's planning
[46:50] for his children
[46:51] he's preparing for their future amen
[46:54] praise
[46:55] god hallelujah oh my some people think
[46:58] they have no future
[47:00] but god is telling you i have plans for
[47:04] you
[47:04] amen and i i have plans for you to have
[47:08] a future
[47:09] amen don't think your life has come to a
[47:12] dead-end street
[47:14] and there is no way out for you because
[47:16] you're serving a god
[47:18] who has plans for you and a plan for you
[47:21] to have a future
[47:22] and a good future and he will take you
[47:25] from where you are
[47:26] to take you into the future that he has
[47:30] planned for you
[47:30] you will walk right into that reality
[47:33] the unfailing reality
[47:35] of the living god making his word known
[47:38] amen
[47:39] hallelujah ah yes my friends
[47:42] god a good father will never purposely
[47:47] do
[47:47] or say anything to purposely hurt his
[47:51] child
[47:54] he will only do things
[47:57] that will help that child whether
[48:00] it's a girl or a boy male or
[48:04] female he will only want to help them
[48:08] not to hurt them yes sir
[48:12] you only want to do things to help them
[48:16] to grow
[48:17] in their lives and not only to grow
[48:20] physically but to mature
[48:23] mentally and spiritually in every way
[48:28] this is what god is doing for us as
[48:31] believers
[48:33] feeding us caring for us watching over
[48:36] us
[48:36] planning for us so my friends
[48:40] that we may grow in grace
[48:43] and we may mature in our walk with him
[48:48] praise be to god oh praise
[48:51] god our heavenly father operates
[48:54] in a wonderful way and as the scripture
[48:58] says
[48:58] his ways are perfect and you know
[49:02] i thank god that the heavenly father his
[49:05] ways
[49:06] are perfect but earthly fathers
[49:12] as good as some of them may be
[49:16] earthly fathers are men
[49:20] and they may err they may make
[49:23] mistakes and these things that i have
[49:27] said to you and i've preached here to
[49:30] you
[49:31] it is not new despite it has been
[49:35] preached and said by many
[49:38] great men many other preachers
[49:42] hallelujah and no real preacher
[49:46] will sway or wave away from the word of
[49:50] god
[49:51] but will stay with the word of god amen
[49:54] hallelujah
[49:56] amen and so friends
[49:59] as good as our earthly fathers may be
[50:03] they may still have their flaws
[50:07] places where they air
[50:11] or an error so the only
[50:14] real father that we can look to
[50:17] knowing that he is perfect
[50:20] is the god of heaven our heavenly father
[50:24] for god never make mistakes in his
[50:27] dealings
[50:29] with his children listen
[50:32] romans 8 28
[50:36] but we know all things work together
[50:40] for good to them that love the lord
[50:44] amen and are called according
[50:47] to his purpose for whom
[50:51] he did for no he also
[50:54] did predestinate predestinated for what
[51:00] predestinated to a confirmation
[51:03] to his image to the image of his son
[51:07] hallelujah praise god that we might use
[51:11] jesus as our example
[51:15] as an image a visual image
[51:18] of the stature of a perfect man
[51:22] that we can use that for our growth
[51:26] and for our spiritual maturity
[51:29] amen praise be to god
[51:33] moreover whom he did predestinate
[51:37] them he also called and whom he
[51:41] called them he also justified
[51:45] and whom he justified them he
[51:48] also glorified hallelujah
[51:52] we have been justified and now the
[51:55] glorific
[51:56] glorification the glorifying power
[51:59] of the holy spirit moving in us
[52:02] preparing us for that wonderful rapture
[52:05] amen yes glorifying you oh praise his
[52:09] marvelous
[52:10] name i'm glad i heavenly have a heavenly
[52:14] father
[52:16] amen a heavenly father who
[52:19] loves and care for his own i'm so glad
[52:23] i have have a heavenly father that sick
[52:26] sits on a high place
[52:30] as the scripture says he sits high
[52:33] but he's looking low he's watching
[52:36] over his own while they are playing
[52:40] around
[52:41] in this world of sin and there are
[52:44] wolves
[52:45] and snakes and scorpions and
[52:48] all manner of evil animals
[52:51] trying to eat up his people as if
[52:54] they're eating bread
[52:56] but the great eagle eyes of our god
[52:59] is watching over his own fear not
[53:03] little flock it is your father's good
[53:06] pleasure
[53:06] to give you the kingdom may the holy
[53:09] spirit
[53:10] apply the word of god to our hearts
[53:13] today listen to matthew 7 11
[53:16] if you then being evil
[53:19] know how to give good gifts unto
[53:22] your children how much more
[53:25] shall your father which is in heaven
[53:29] give good things to them
[53:33] that ask him oh praise god
[53:36] hallelujah brother sister let me say
[53:39] this
