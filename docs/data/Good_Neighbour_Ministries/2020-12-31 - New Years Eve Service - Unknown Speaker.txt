is god bless you all um we're um uh here tonight the reason why we have these music is because if everybody was unmuted it would be something called chaos and we don't want chaos we want just smooth uh transition and everything like that so there will be times when we do on youtube and um so we'll let you know okay so don't if you press on you we gotta press mute again and uh that's that's why that's what was happening there so it was a game you were pressing on youtube you're pressing them anyway so anyway welcome everybody to uh good neighbor ministries the new year's eve service uh what a blessing it is to come together like this because uh you know this is lockdown new year's eve service we're in lockdown we are not supposed to have anybody in the house and we can't go to the church but praise the lord anyhow we get together like that so we have um i don't know how many different let's see we got the well well over 30 35 uh 26 okay my family's around at least 26 people are are in at the moment and they will more will come and will see how i the number goes but first of all um we just want to mention a few things about uh how we're going to operate this all right so first of all if everyone who is in can turn on their cameras right we know that there's a few cameras that are on high games like you see a few other ones let's see looks not this available uh we will be spotlighting all right what that means is um your picture what you see of me everybody's gonna see a view for a few seconds as we go around and let everybody see you and give it a thumbs up like this what happened there okay give it a thumbs up or you can say hi um wave hi whatever you want to do um and that way you'll be seen and spotlighted so if your camera's not on you won't be spotlighted so we want to see everybody and enjoy everybody's uh atmosphere impressions we want to bring uh brother daniel can you bring both danny out boys hi brother danny hey how's it going real good man it's good to be here god bless you yeah this is wonderful this is um you know what it's the next best thing that we could have for uh getting together as uh sons and daughters of god at such a time as this so i just want to thank uh our young people and our audio and visual uh experts uh for taking the time to put this all together because i believe it'll be a real blessing for us to be able to go into the new year together so brother danny is going to uh co-host this uh event with myself so we will be able to talk back and forth and comment and you know have a great time in the world and with all of you so one very important thing this is a big night um not just a big night for us but it's a big night for everybody and we have been told that uh probably most of the world will be on the internet tonight doing what we're going to be doing at some point tonight so what does that mean the possibility is uh really exists that uh the internet companies will not be able to handle what we're really uh like before because it's unprecedented so um if we do lose you if the whole thing topples over i'm trusting it won't but if it does the servant card can be seen starting at 11 o'clock on our youtube channel that part is guaranteed okay that'll be that'll be there in case we lose you 11 o'clock you don't hear past your signing bring the message right into the new year okay but in the meantime um we're gonna carry on with this if you have a um a speaker did i say this already well if you have a speaker um it would be a good idea to plug in the speaker because because some of our pre-recorded um uh specials and whatnot are a little bit low under volume they're okay it'll be fine you know if you're here it'll be a very a nice addition if you have a speaker event that you can plug into and it'll be it'll be very helpful all right so everybody praise the lord you know i can't see anybody besides myself i hate looking at myself okay so the first thing we want to do believe it or not is that we want to do some spotlighting okay so we're going to play some background music and when your face comes up give us a thumbs up give us a heart if you want to give us uh whatever you want to do but um let's play some a little fun and go around the world a little bit and see where everybody's at yeah before thank god for my daughter michelle she's the brains behind the operations men so we're uh we're dependent on them as much as anything [Music] wait [Music] what a celebration [Music] [Applause] [Music] pick up that trumpet [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]

you know that's just the way we'll move it but god bless you um we enjoyed uh those uh specials and uh now um we're going into the marshes god bless you he's a wonderful person lord praise the lord jesus it is an amazing privilege to be here tonight to have the opportunity to share my own personal testimony with you of the work that god has done is doing and continues to do in my life and for those of you who may not be members of our ministry and have been invited to watch this broadcast and to celebrate 2020 with us as we move into 2021 this is one of the things that our church has always done for the many years that i've been here is that um our brothers let me ask a believer to share for about 15 minutes or so their life story would say a personal testimony and this year the mantle has fallen to me and it's now my privilege and honor really to stand here and to share with you so thank you thank you for being here and thank you for listening i pray that through whatever i share tonight will be all for the glory of god and that wherever you may find yourself in life whatever you may be going through that you may be able to relate and connect with me and my story or perhaps not it may be different to you unique to you but then you're exposed now to someone else's perspective and point of view in the world but through it all you'll see that my background i realized as i considered and contemplated was really quite messy actually to be perfectly honest and glory to god the lord hath brought me from a lot of meth into this message of the hour and so i'll begin to tell you my story my journey of life and the relationships that have been built that's created me and form the character that i have now making me recognize that the most important relationship of all is having a relationship with the lord jesus christ amen so for those who don't know i am originally from jamaica kinston jamaica i was born in and before i was born actually my mom tells me that she was she named me marsha because of marsha brady and the brady bunch and so yeah if you can relate to calendar and the clock you recognize that was smack dab in the middle of the 70s and that's when i came into the world but when i think about myself and my background i realized that although i was named and inspired by marcia brady i did not at all grow up in a typical brady bunch kind of family by upbringing with felt that i ended up actually growing up with my grandparents my mom had me when she was just turning 20 years old and she'd actually had my older brother at that time as well so my mom was quite young when she had us and and that being said what happened then my grandparents after a while uh gave her the opportunity to come to canada so my mom emigrated to canada when i was only eight months old and therefore i didn't have that upbringing with my mother i actually had that with my grandmother and my grandfather my dad was nowhere in the picture as you'd say um the man who god used to bring me into this world which i'm still thankful for anyhow that the lord brought them together and so that i could be here and really thank god to my grandparents um because to tell a little bit more of the story my gran my mother conceived me while on a vacation so to speak so that being said my grandparents you know they could have she was still living at home and so they could have chosen that hey they wouldn't allow her to have a second child because this would be her second child less than 20 years old when she was less than 20 years old but the grace of god amen that was not an option and the lord allowed me to be here right she decided to keep me as her her child and and i came into the world right but that being said unfortunately she decided that she didn't want to have anything with my dad anymore my father and even though as his part of the story goes he tried to connect with me but my mom cut him off so i grew up in my life not knowing my father and i finally did have the opportunity to meet him when i was 16. and that was very emotional if you can imagine but i didn't have the typical as i said mom and dad at home kind of environment and growing up where we lived we lived in the heart of the ghetto right if anyone you know of jamaican background it can relate to jamaica we lived in an area called maxfield or some people say maxfield park because there was a part nearby by that name and i lived there for the first few years of my life in maxfield with my grandparents aunts and uncles and then my grandfather built a home and second home in another area another we'd say you know hardcore ghetto part of jamaica called waterhouse you know but colloquially the proper pronunciation would be water house but we all just call it water house you know and that's where i lived and we moved there when i was maybe about seven years old or so and it was in waterhouse that you know started growing up and elementary school and all of that but again it was you know now i guess we're right into the 80s and it wasn't easy right um the environment that i grew up in was very a lot of violence we were exposed to to be honest um there you could always see any time of the day you know people standing on the corner and being guarded looking out they're trying to see if anybody's going to attack them occasionally i would pass by and see someone stand on the corner with a gun other times you never know when a police cars or or soldiers would come zooming down the street and they would all jump out of their vehicles and have their their their um you know ammunitions their guns out and they'd be chasing after some you know some person some perpetrator so that was you know part of what i grew up in that's what i saw on a regular basis right and personally you know intimately more you'd say in our own home as my aunts and uncles started to grow they started having their own relationships children outside of marriage and then those spouses or partners would come and live in the family home for the family home even though we had some of the family in max field and another family in waterhouse we had for those each aunts and uncles they all had their own relationships and then started having all their children but again no one was married you know and everybody we just lived in a communal kind of environment and so part of that though unfortunately was the witness to a lot of domestic abuse right it was very common for my aunts or uncles you know to unfortunately get in fights and so you would see you know my and as we call them in jamaica too you say baby mother right and baby father right that's the words that we used and so you would see them you know fight in fist fight physical fights abuse my grandfather also even though he was a great provider and he did excellent job in terms of you know building our house as i mentioned and you know providing for the family physically but unfortunately you'd say emotionally very much guarded he wasn't there very much and didn't also for his sons that he brought up so he didn't train them to be good men and good husbands or even become husbands right and even my grandfather himself unfortunately were on with unfaithful to my grandmother and you know had other children outside of their marriage so that's the type of background that i grew up in and didn't get to fee you know as i said the traditional mom and dad type relationship and having your own siblings right and so i would encourage you that if you are so blessed and privileged that you have your parents with you at home your mom and dad you know just that what do we say stable type of environment that's a real blessing because not everyone in the world has that to grow up to grow up in that environment but needless to say you know my grandmother did the best she could of course and she i called her mama because she was my mama she was the mom i had all the years and she did very well by me she ensured that i would continue focusing on my schooling she helped me of course and even spiritually that is too would make sure that i would go to sunday school every sunday and would do focus on my schoolwork my older brother and i and then also she would have me read the bible to her every night and that was also one of my special memories and connection with my grandmother and all of that started to build my spiritual foundation because of course you can't be reading the bible without it impacting you as well so psalm 37 was one of her favorite songs and i would read that to her every night and even in the latter part of her time here on earth so i left jamaica when i was 13 years old and came immigrated to canada where my mom was and finally now have an opportunity to live with my mother but considering that i didn't know her really she came to jamaica only once that i can remember while i was you know while i was there while i was living there because with her condition as well in canada she wasn't able to travel as frequently to say go back and forth so my relationship with my mom at that time was just a visit that she brought she went to jamaica and then also with you know the thing that she would send of course she would try to send things to support us while we were growing up my brother and i there but to me it was a perfect stranger that when i came here at 13 years old all of a sudden now i'm living with my mom and she also now has my sister's dad there living with us and my little sister is born at the time and um although she was not so little at that time she was probably nine or so i bet when i when i came to canada but we were all living together with my older brother and it was not the greatest adjustment right you can imagine you know all of a sudden i've been uprooted from my world that i knew in jamaica now i'm living in canada the culture shock everything is different different environment different family people i don't know there for every reason perfect strangers right because i didn't live with them all these years and so now i had to come to know them right so those years were pretty rocky those first years with my mom because again too i hadn't been trained i remember one moment my mom wanted me to help with the laundry but she didn't teach me how to use the washing machine in jamaica we washed by hand right and i mixed the colors together and i made a mess of the clothes and she came home and she was so angry with me right and it's like you know it's just an example of the arguments you would have because of improper communication right she had certain expectations of me thinking that okay i'm 13 going on 14 whatever that she'd expect that i would know certain things but perhaps not recognizing that i came from a completely different environment so it was hard right at first and then what made it even more hard and more difficult was that within a year of me traveling to canada my grandmother passed away right so here my rock my foundation my everything who while i was here in canada would write her letters all the time and we'd call each other but then she had gotten really ill and she passed away so that was really difficult for me and thankfully i was able to travel to jamaica for her funeral but then i also put a little stone between my mom and i because i was angry at my mom saying that hey you could pay for us to travel to jamaica for her funeral to bury her but you couldn't pay for us to go and visit her while she was alive so to be honest my mom and i and those early years when i first came we always were butting heads and if you're in that place right now too where you may be finding you're always butting heads with your mom or you know some other significant adult in your life you know they realize that there are times when when it's all about you know improper communication and lack of and not the right expectations being said right so i've been there thankfully the bridge has crossed and we're definitely relationship has changed and we're very very close my mom and i today but that was the background that's what you know um coming into canada all of a sudden going into high school living with my mom that's what it was so that being said moving along through high school now and um i i met uh you know it was difficult for me because again like i said with a big change but i met a young lady who helped me and she learned that you know we would just sing together in the cafe and so on so then she's like oh you should join the choir right and then i told her that oh no i've never found with anything in any choir or anything like that you know while growing up in jamaica i love singing and i always listen to the radio and you know just try to imitate the artists on the radio and if you can imagine all the popular artists back then and whitney houston was one of my favorites of course i need to bake her of course so it's like if you think of that time the you know whatever top 10 songs were on the radios like what i'll always be singing so that being said though you know she she said no you should really join the choir you have a nice voice so i decided okay i'd go for it right and in grade nine it was a you know beginning of my high school years i uh i joined the choir i was allowed to join the choir and that opened up a whole new world for me because through that it started helping me to build my confidence and and just to explore because i never had those types of opportunities growing up in jamaica to staying with a group to be part of the choir to play musical instruments and things like that so that was really great and then eventually that built up my confidence for drama and i loved acting i'd always loved music and always loved you know acting movies and all of that but again with my upbringing it wasn't an opportunity for me but then in high school it became that right and so i would continue and and participate in different school plays and things like that and even different um uh opportunities to to showcase you know school performance musicals and things like that so that's how eventually my talent started to come out for you singing and for drama and i really loved that i loved it and i decided i wanted to pursue that as part of my life goals and so at the time i continued in high school continued taking a lot of music and drama classes and to the point where i excelled so much that eventually in graduated high school i was given three scholarships right and one of them being a ten thousand dollar scholarship so it was really you know it was a big award right and and then as i you know think back to where i came from being in jamaica and then now in a different environment you know high school was literally just four five years by the time i finished my oaf year so i was able to you know to be ambitious and to to push myself and to study and to be able to establish myself you would say so that by the time i was graduating high school i was no longer the freshy as they would call us fresh off the boat right but i was able to be more confident young woman prepared for university and i went to university to study theater and so i was at york and and that was you know another new world being open to me because again it's a different environment and i hadn't uh i hadn't you know been in the country for very long come to think of it right so by that time i was only in the country for about six years and so university with a whole new world uh one of the things i didn't talk about though is my spiritual part of my transition to canada because when i came here shortly after in those early turbulent years at my mom i my mom was in the pentecostal church though and eventually i started going to church with her and my aunt and before leaving jamaica one of my teachers actually from school had said to me oh when you go to foreign because they call you know canada america they just call it foreign right and they're like when you go to foreign you should go to church that's how you're going to stay out of trouble right so it stuck in my mind that okay if i want to stay out of trouble i need to be at church right so therefore i got caught up in the pentecostal church and was going with them regularly and everything like that and it was a blessing because as i mentioned i'd always grown up with sunday school and there was always an element of knowing god and and seeking god right and so in that pentecostal i think i was about 14 going on 15 at the time i decided to get baptized in that pentecostal church and so for you know for a few years i was there diligently always going to services morning and afternoon right and that's what we did but then eventually by the time i was like 15 going on 17 you know it was very legalistic really we'd say and with my knowledge at the time it was basically i was in the church just doing what i was told to do i was wearing long skirts because i was told to wear long skirts i didn't have that revelation for myself really i of course because i thirsted for god and i wanted to know god i was doing it you know but because it wasn't i didn't have that anchor it wasn't a revelation to me it was again more on the basis of just doing it to make it the right choice to do the right thing right as i said to do this thing out of trouble right so that was a big part because then eventually i started you know what they say backsliding right you know later on in the high school years by the time grade 11 great by most grade 12 actually you know i started partying here and there going to clubs i'd be you know hiding wearing pants at school and you know wearing this to the skirts when you go to church and you're always being conscious wondering if anybody in the neighborhood you're going to run into any church believers so i've been through all of that as well you know you're basically living a double life now right i was living one life at church and then a different life at school and then eventually you know it was like i was like okay forget about it and as we would say in jamaican ways and i'm broke out right i totally had a breakout and started um just you know partying clubbing just listening to all kind of secular music it wasn't like okay focusing on the lord anymore it was just like okay you know let me just go and have fun right you start thinking that this is the fun thing to do so that being said um through that time that was what i entered university so when i went to university i was no longer you know the church girl as we'd say i was now the party girl really and but i was still focused on school and so with university came along a lot of different influences right and that's where i started dabbling in smoking right because a lot of people around me smoked and they would say oh secondhand smoke is worse than smoking itself so i was like okay so i started bombing cigarettes off with you know this and that each person around me was in theater and theater's a lot of smoking a lot of people unfortunately smoke in theater but then i remember one specific moment though when i was standing i was waiting for my bus because i wasn't driving yet i was waiting for the bus and i thought to myself oh i feel like a cigarette and in that moment it's like no marcia you're like getting hooked on smoking so thankfully i was able to cut it off because i fit to myself no i'm not gonna become like hooked and and addicted to cigarettes right but that was part of my journey i was smoking a lot regularly i would still be drinking my alcohol here and there whenever i'd go out but it wasn't becoming like a regular habit as smoking was when i was at school you know go to school and see everyone smoking you start smoke with them so therefore i had to take consciousness of that and and thank god i did right i was able to change in that moment and say no i'm going to cut it off i'm not going to become addicted so again there's a little note that you know sometimes you find yourself on the journey you're going in the wrong way and and you find yourself being pulled you find yourself being pulled and then you realize that okay you gotta cut it off if you're being spoken to it's come into your heart that that's not the right direction for you then you just listen to that voice and cut it off from there right so as i continued in university in the theater program acting and everything like that it was good but unfortunately uh i was also being aware of you know it was early this was now mid-90s and the lgbt agenda as they would say was starting to become more outward people were more getting out of their closets so to speak so in my theater school and my acting teacher i remember her specifically looking at me and telling marsha you have to convince me that you can love a man as well as a woman and i'm like okay so really she was telling me that i needed to be able to break down my bridges break down myself so that if i had to act in an intimate scene with a man or a woman that i'd be able to do that so in those times i started you know doubting this path of an actor right i started thinking like really is this what i want to do with my life i'm like if i'm doing certain roles what would god think of me so my consciousness of god and awareness of him and his spirit was starting to come back to me though to me during those times and i started thinking that you know what what do you think of the roles that i'm doing that i'm performing right so i realized that you know what it seemed like theater is not going to be for me after all but i was always doing a double major with theater in english and so i continued in my english and political science and at that time too i started meeting different people in university and because i started now started to hunger and thirst for the lord i started exploring and you know i met different people who were in different types of churches different denominations started going with a friend who was in the adventist church and was with her for some time but then met a person who was in a baptist church and i said okay let me go and visit his church and i started visiting all these other churches and when i went to that baptist church i thought it was going to be like a traditional church and to my great surprise those of caribbean descent they can understand when i say it was a poco church right and it's that type of church where the ladies all wrap their heads they have all manner of colors of candles and each candle has a different color and represents a different thing and i have kind of infants burning and everything was very very somewhat traumatic because i've never been in a church like that before and so i was like okay that was my first and last time at that church right i was like no way while i go back but that was part of my experience and then eventually though i met friends who were muslim and they started talking about the quran and they started talking about the prophet muhammad so then i started reading the quran and trying to understand it and what that was all about and it was also making me relate to my afro-centric you'd say element of my of my of my you know history right in our culture but i was just like okay who is this muhammad right but anyways i was exploring i was learning i was seeking i really started thinking to myself that you know what god is real but i don't have a real relationship with him i don't know him for real how do i know him so eventually now what happened is that during that same time as we'd say now we recognize the word of god we say the deep the call to the deep right and the deep will respond so in that time of my life you know in my third year of university that deep within me started seeking more for god and i started like i said what thinking of my future what am i going to do with my life right and um a pivotal moment came when my aunt who lived with us she was having a birthday party and you know she she invited a lot of believers to come on over and then during that time of the party you know i was doing my own thing but eventually they were talking and i started listening and i asked them about the genesis story when the lord said let us make man in our image in our likeness and i was saying to them like that's the trinity right there there's three gods he was speaking to himself and well he was not himself he didn't know it was to himself at the time so i was like he was speaking to the trinity they're saying let us make man in our image and in our likeness and then one of the brothers that would brother mike actually rather mike asari and brother kofi they were there and was speaking to me a lot at that night and they were expounding to me though that god wasn't speaking as a trinity to jesus and the holy spirit when he said let us and when he said our that they explained that god was speaking to himself because we are in him and he had to speak to his own body that in order to get the substance when he wanted you know the fish to he would speak to the water so in order for that substance to come he would need to speak to it so within that moment that was part of my light bulb moment when they said that we were in god and god was speaking to himself and that is part of the creation now he spoke and said let us create man he was speaking to himself to create man into this world and after i heard that i was like wow and i started being more quiet really i started listening more because i'm like okay i've never heard that before and they started hearing what they had to say so needless to say the end of that night um they started praying to dismiss the the uh the dinner party and through the prayer you know the spirit of god really came down and the anointing just fell and everyone just started shouting and worshiping the lord and i found myself on my knees just crying out to god and praying and i didn't even know what was happening but i just in that moment was just crying in tears and was just praying and just asking god to forgive me and i was just seeing the things that i did in my life and was just asking god to help me and to deliver me and in that moment of course i was wearing pants so just dressed as normal but the thought came to me that when i get up off my knees i'm going to be a different person and i said i'm not going to wear pants anymore i'm not going to be wearing makeup i'm not going to do anything things because in my heart at that moment god was just telling me that that's not who he wanted me to be anymore and so that night continued and i felt and i knew i'm like okay i know i contacted god but i don't know where to go from here and so my aunt sister dale for those of you who knew her she was encouraging me to just going up to bed because i was getting late and that you know everything would be fine i didn't share any of my like my prayer with her or anything like that but you know i just kept it all in my heart and i said okay so i went up to bed and the next morning though sorry before going to sleep i said to myself that if i called her aunt faye she's my aunt rice i said if anthony call asked me to go to church with her in the morning i'll go it was a saturday night and then for her the morning her side of the story when she was leaving i'm going to like pass in my bedroom that morning the voice spoke to her and said you should ask marsha to go to church and so when she did thank god she obeyed right how important it is for us to listen to that voice as the lord speaks she obeyed and she just said oh you know do you want to go to church with me today and immediately she said that i was like okay there it is right i don't need to dab so i just got up got ready and we came to church that was my first time here um to church and i'll just i'll have to be you know to wrap up so to speak now but what happened that first service was it was actually discovered later that our brother who ministered for the dna and that that was his very first time ministering and it's amazing how we remember those moments because i remember his message was about the light and he used the light bulb to type heaven and i think the title actually of his message was the lamb is the light there and everything that he was just speaking is like he was just talking to me personally and you know in those moments right in and the way he used the light bulb and typed heaven and typed about god and taught jesus and saying how he will be the light there we won't need for any natural light it just like it just opened up a whole new world to me and i just felt like okay this is something i've never heard before but then i was still not sure if i difficult church home that i'd want to be and then sometime later i think with on my drive home the thought came to me though that if i were to stay in this church and be a part of this ministry that i would see my grandmother again and i knew it in my heart that okay god that's you speaking to me you're telling me that this is where i need to be and this is the way that you're going to lead me to go to glory and defeat my grandmother again so after that i um i ended up having to learn about being re-baptized because i was now i'd gone into the world and everything so needless to say on easter sunday 1997 i got re-baptized gave my heart to the lord and the life change happened because you know i recognize that jesus is the only the main and most important relationship that we need to develop in our lives and that even as we grow up even if we come from a messy environment where it may not have been picture perfect to say right we recognize that he's able to change us he's able to transform us and he uses people to help us to build our character to shape us right and so to encourage you especially even folks who may be younger in high school that think of the friends that you have think of the influences who are around you because just as even my friend was helped to me when she invited me to join the choir and that became a big transition for me you can invite someone else and you can invite them to church or some other hobby some activity but that will help them to develop and to come outside of themselves and to learn more about themselves really but it's just to show us the importance of our friends our influences but therefore the most important as i said relationship is recognizing that we need to know our creator we need to know our maker you know the bible speaks that the heavens declare the glory of the lord we only need to look around us to recognize that we were created by the by god who became the lord jesus christ and that he came here to redeem us so that we could have a relationship with him just like you have a relationship with your parents if god didn't make us we couldn't have a relationship with us he couldn't reveal himself to us and so that's why he made us so that he could be our father he could be our comforter so i thank you very much for this time thank you for listening as i shared my background where i came from how i grew up and i pray that perhaps something i shared today has been a blessing to you in your journey knowing that no matter what you may be going through it's only jesus who can make a way and god richly bless you amen [Music] all right praise god uh praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord we're going to sing a song here would like everybody to join in we're so glad that the lord did a great work in our sister's life um

if there was ever a year that um we needed to rely on the lord and know that he would be psalms 3 the lifter of our head this was the year i got to say that i had many ups and downs let's put it that way it was a year of tremendous victories a year of tremendous testing uh testing of our faith you know right from within my own family my children um every area health issues and then on top of that the pressure of covid 19 and putting an uh you know an undue stress right upon the home in the family i'm sure you understand what i'm talking about you know it just you can't get out you know and and the pressure becomes there you know and um and then you know this mind battle that goes on where you got to deal with the fact that you're a son or a daughter of god and you know as a son or daughter of god we have no fear because we know that the lord our god is our healer he's our provider there's nothing that we should ever fear but yet we're living in human realm and we're in these human bodies and these bodies are susceptible to the conditions and the laws of this dimension and so um this song came to me uh you know we were talking about doing a few specials and a testimony and this this song came to me in the night i woke up in the middle of the night and it was it was all over me and i realized then i didn't realize but i realized then that it was because you know he was showing the kind of year that we had and that he was constantly there to lift us up and to bring us out amen so i dedicate this song unto the lord and i give him thanks and praise for what he's done because he is the lord and the lifter of our heads [Music] do [Music] oh lord are a shield for me you're the glory and the lifter of my head [Music] many there be increased that trouble me many other demon spirits that rise against me many there be which say my soul [Music] there is no help for you [Music] i cried [Music] i laid me down and i slept and i awakened the precious holy ghost of god sustained me [Music] i will not be afraid of ten thousands of demons every evil spirit may rise against me that come against me for me for the glory [Music] i cried unto the lord with my voice he heard me out of his holy i laid me down [Music] i will not be afraid of ten thousands of demons every evil spirit may rise up against me i will not be afraid of ten thousands of demons [Music] me [Music] oh me you're the glory [Music] amen so now we just want to introduce our pastor uh pastor simon to come and bring his new year's message going in leave in 2020 entering into 2021 we will cross over during the preaching and we will rejoice at the end of it all right so god bless pastor simon as he brings the word [Music] with joy we draw waters from the well of salvation i'm very happy to be here december 31st the ending of our year 2020 and we are on the brink of our entry into the new year 2020 may god richly bless you and keep you as we approach the word of god at this hour and time we would like to take our scripture from matthew chapter two reading from verses one to 12. in particular i would like to take verse 12 we find here now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen a star in the east and are come to worship him when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him but when he had gathered the chief priests and scribes and of the people together and he demanded of them where christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bettly him in the land of judah are not the least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people of israel when herod then herod when he had privileged called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when we have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also and when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them and till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way praise be to god for the reading of his word let us pray a gracious father we thank you so much for the written word that you have given us a record of things that have taken place from which we can draw insights uh wisdom revelation from this through your great holy spirit we pray you'll help us today bless us today father as this year of 2020 it's now winding down we thank you for the wonderful songs and testimonies the great efforts of the saints of god oh lord the various uh victoria victories the praises and honor and glory that was given to your name just before i brought this message father and i'm asking you to bless everyone all of them that participated that give their hearts their lives their talents their all to give glory and honor and praise to you lord bless us here now we pray in the name of our lord jesus christ we ask it amen and amen praise the lord praise god brother branham speaking from who do you say this is he says we are living in a marvelous time the the greatest of all the ages we're living to win time can cease and eternity can blend right in with it and go on the ages of all the prophets and the sages look forward to we ought to be every hour on our guard watching for his coming oh we are in a critical hour the world is but the real church not the denomination is ready for the greatest triumph it has ever made the coming of the groom to the bride oh one a day one an hour is now wonderful the coming of the groom to the bride at this time not four but two praise the lord he is here too and when that talk coming to her as a revelation changes and goes into a rapturing condition then they go out of here but praise be the gods i'd like to speak on the subject of the wisdom of the wise men for if they were called wise men by god himself in the bible then they must be wise and first of all we understand that these wise men were indeed wise for under the inspiration of a balaam the prophet his message that out of jacob would rise a great star amen out of jacob out of him will rise the star that will come up that will be a governor and a ruler over god's people israel they got a revelation from him and so they were watching for a star they were waiting for the appearance of a star for the star to appear and when that great star did appear as you know these wise men were astronomers uh they were astronomers maybe also astrologers uh because in those days back then before the torah was even written god's first bible was in the skies using the moon stars and sun as signs to show times and seasons and and so on so the patriots of of of their day actually read god's bible in the sky now we know that god has moved on from that torah came along and then the fullness of the word where jesus came on the scene and it was written of him and then god revealed to paul the rest of the new testament of which now we have bought both old and new testament but these men at that time watch for the stars in the sky and when they saw it thank god they recognized it you see you see what you're looking for oh my praise god they recognize the star because they were watching for it thank god and they followed the star from their different countries from which they came their different nations from which they came uh today we'll say well you know they came out of different nations uh i believe india hindustan you know and persia uh what other country i don't know whether it's turkey or wherever but the three wise men traveled following the star from their different nations and we are here today by the grace of almighty god because we have come out from our various dynamic nations led by god star of the hour and we have recognized god's star and we have followed god's star amen hallelujah and as far as i know and believe and have received and witnessed in it in my heart life and ministry that he has led us to the perfect light now we know that these three wise men represented the three sons of noah shem ham and japheth and so it's speaking about the entire human race being under the influence of this great marvelous star hallelujah now as you know we have just had the conjunction of two stars coming together jupiter and saturn and forming one shining star within the night sky after hundreds of years this star has appeared two stars but in the day of jesus when the wise men followed that star we understand from historical writing records we understand that it's act in fact it was three stars and these three stars merged moved and they came into a conjunction they came into a union and when they were close together from the earth looking to them or at them they were seen as one great bright star within the sky glory to god hallelujah amen possibly jupiter saturn and venus that's possibly that's the names of those uh individual stars at that time now we understand that stars actually represent times according to god saying in genesis he puts them there for the signs and for seasons and also stars represents of course parts of the zodiac represents the spirits of men that are on the earth here so as these three stars moved in the heavens these three wise men from different nations in our davidson in different denominations were traveling towards the truth searching to find the fullness of the word of god's truth and as they were traveling individually on the earth and moving in the heavens above the stars were moving also moving into a union and a conjunction until they came into a state of oneness to shine forth the light of god blessed be his holy name and so praise god those three men even though they never knew each other their paths crossed at bethlehem's gate where the star came together as one and thank god looking at god's seventh church age star messenger that he sent up on this earth following that ministry it has led us to the gate of the lamb of god bethlehem's gate praise be to god hallelujah and we have come together to do what to see the birth of the newborn word oh glory to god hallelujah is led us to the new born word of god for this hour now back in the days of jesus when the three stars appeared three being the number of of perfection it spoke about the headship the coming of the head of the body of christ and he jesus is the head of the body amen and so it spoke about the headship praise the lord and he came as what the son of man for now god was in flesh appearing god had condescended and was in the flesh appearing upon your earth praise god in our day two stars have appeared two stars hallelujah representing my friends not the coming so much of the headship but the coming of the body the coming of the head to the body a uniting time a supernatural natural conjunction typing and speaking of a spiritual supernatural conjunction of the head christ coming to his body which is his bride his wife amen hallelujah and praise god we find it here friends the presence of his body here on the earth united together by the opening of the word of god hallelujah fulfilling this the scripture of luke 17 that in the days of sodom how that day son of man that would be revealed again but now we know he is being revealed again but not in the form of the head he is now being revealed or is revealing himself to us in the bride form or in the form of a bride or as the manifested word of god for the age the word and flesh appearing god making himself manifested to this day this age and this hour oh my oh a great hour of the manifestation of the children of god the great liberty of the children of god which we enjoy at this time the liberty the freedom oh praise god deliverance from our past deliverance from bondage deliverance from fear and doubt deliverance from maybe so and presumptions into a state of being satan of god knowing who we are where we come from and where we are going for his glory praise god hallelujah and as the wise men of old the bible says they came to worship him they came to bring glory and honor to his name and to exalt his name and to say come let us adore him christ the lord and we are here today to worship him and to adore him and magnify him and the bible said there rejoice with exceeding great joy when they saw that star and it came and hung over where the young child was i'm telling you today we ought to rejoice we have to give god glory we ought to give him praise we ought to give him honor we ought to magnify him that he gave us eyes to see ears to hear and to our hearts to believe and to glorify his wonderful and marvelous name oh glory to god hallelujah amen thank god that they came to worship him as their savior amen as the true light amen praise god and worship him as their lord and we are here in our day after looking at the twinkling star amen of this message that led us to the perfect understanding and revelation of our day seeing being led not by a star in the heavens but led by a seventh star church age messenger amen spoken of in revelation chapter 3 revelation chapter 10 verse 7 led by that twinkling shining wondrous star of god the light of revelation emanating from his message and from his ministry has led us right now my friends to the perfect light of god for this hour thanks be to god and some will say brother simon what you're saying i don't see it i don't understand it i don't know what you're talking about but it's just like it was back then the wise men saw the star but many others didn't or could not see the stars my god they didn't see it and now we have people in our day that do not see the star don't recognize the star don't understand the message the ministry of that star and what sign what does it mean who is this they do not understand who this is but god by his holy spirit has blessed us and revealed to us and caused us to know who this is and we give god the glory and the honor for it praise god hallelujah now you must realize herod and his wise men didn't see it or they would have had the answers for the wise men the rabbis the jewish rabbis who spent from childhood to manhood and into ancient man studying the scriptures day and night they did not see that star in the skies they did not recognize what god was doing in this hour oh watchman what of the night the morning cometh and what of the night oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah oh praise god but the wise men they were able to see the star because that star was given specifically for them to see for unto you it's given to know the mystery of the kingdom but unto them it is not given god predis elected and predestinated those wise men of that day to recognize that star messenger leader and they followed the star and the star led them to jesus christ hallelujah even so in our day and in our time we were being chosen elected predestinated by god to be come to the word of this hour and to understand and follow by supernatural revelation right to the christ of god himself amen hallelujah glory to god notice that took their eyes off of that star for a brief period of time and when they took their eyes off of that star they were blinded for a brief whale by the glare of man the glare of the glory of herod the glare of the glory of religious dignitaries they were distracted and temporarily misled by these religious popular dignitaries and religious leaders and this happened because they uh believed or thought to themselves that since these were learned leaders in the written scriptures of the day the written message of that day that they should know when this star or where the star has appeared and we know friends that they did not know they knew the scriptures they knew the scriptures said it that the star would rise from jesse they knew it would come around bethlehem efrata they knew that from writing but by revelation they had no idea that the star had already appeared and the wise men were being already led by that star to the christ they knew the scriptures but they did not know him many in this message in this day and in this hour mighty men of god mighty leaders great dignitaries great man oh no god no his word nor the scriptures but i'm not conscious of god to be aware of the supernatural occurrence that has taken taking place and is taking place as the book is unfolding god revealing himself and interpreting himself in this day and in this hour and making himself known they know the quotes they know the scriptures they know the word they'll they'll tack you to a wall with that but they have no idea they're skimming around close to it but they're not really into it not just by lining up quotes lining up scriptures comparing texts and stuff like that but coming under the inspiration of the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 coming under the power of the supernatural covenant of god the great holy spirit moving within the heart of the true believer and making himself known and interpreting his own word through them for his glory and for his honor oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah those men were so convinced as we are convinced that those of us would caught the genuine core heart ingredient of the last prophet's message and pressed our way into the kingdom hallelujah holding to god's unchanging word and there we are those men were convinced even though they had never seen anything of this sort in their lifetimes or heard of any such a thing they followed the star according to the word of prophecy that was revealed and made known to them they followed the star and they did it regardless of circumstances over hill and over dale over deserts and over mountains over hunger thirst over the objections of their family friends wives husband they held to the promised word of the day the message of the hour the message of malachi 4 5 turning not to the right nor to the left but keeping their eyes upon the star keeping their eyes upon the word of god looking away to jesus and following in the footsteps of their lord oh blessed be the name of the lord nor praise god imagine their friends must have come to them and said melchior what madness are you caught up in what type not even the normal church not even the same sensible wonderful ministers message ministers that follow claim they're also watching for that star and following that star don't see what you're seeing they're not they don't have uh what you're talking about what are you talking about and and so they made him into an oddball and the friends family would begin to question their integrity their understanding and their revelation oh my god hallelujah yes sir and these men maybe were known men maybe they were famous in their own lands and their own countries their own nations and among their own people men of fame maybe they were rich but that counted all it all down and ash that they might win the christ that they might find the perfect light the word of god for the day and for the hour hallelujah none of those things stop them and none of this should stop you none of it should give us a halting a hindering or a hesitation but to press into the kingdom of god but to press on and hold to god's unfolded word of god for the fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor amen yes sir they gave up all to follow that star or praise god that's our story this is my story this is my song oh i'm following my savior all the day long oh praise god they gave up all to follow him wherever you are in this day in this hour at the ending of this year this time this season this age that we are in give up your all my friends and lay yourself at the feet of jesus and follow him and follow him and he will lead you into the perfect light praise god oh my why because they were convinced it's thus saith the lord hallelujah balaam spoke it but yeah recognize not the man they recognized the voice that was speaking through him that that was god saying that that star would arise out of jesse out of jacob amen hallelujah oh brother sister thank god for esther at the time of purim hallelujah she said if i perish let me perish but i'm going to see the king why did they have why did she have this kind of dedication because revelation the book revelation chapter 4 not in the bible but the uh revelation series chapter 4. book 3 31 after the wise men saw him in the heavens after the wise men saw his star in the heavens they became ministering spirits here upon the earth those are the words of the prophet of this hour when they saw the star recognized it saw what it meant understood by revelation what it meant and where it was leading and started to follow it all praise god they became living testimonies they became ministering spirits here upon the earth my brother my sister in christ oh praise god for his wonderful name god has blessed us in this hour to open our eyes on our heirs to see and recognize what he has done and is doing through the life ministry and message of the great messenger he sent upon the earth and now that has transformed all of us into ministering spirits some of us preachers others prayers others givers others with a testimony others all praise god with different facets of the great diamond the brilliance and the supernal and superlative presence of god splendid uh presence of the living god flowing out of our lives shining the light of the gospel in this end time and in this hour to lead and bring men to attention of the word of god and to jesus christ they may say i don't see nothing about that message i don't believe william branham or what he said but just look around you look what it's accomplishing he's long gone and what's taking place now is not about him it's what the god that set him is doing hallelujah elijah isn't here but he like elisha him and her hallelujah now the bride's ministry has begun in the power of god the fire the holy spirit flowing in abundance and rivers of power and rivers and streams and fountains of signs oneness miracles and opening of the word to bless the people and to bring them out of their spiritual conditions and bondage that they were in yes sir i fought perish let me perish i am persuaded that this is thus saith the lord i am persuaded that he jesus christ is able to keep that which he i have committed unto him against that great jubilee rapture day oh glory to god hallelujah amen so i'm following jesus one step at a time i'm following him brother sister and giving glory to god hallelujah amen those wise men came to find the great king a great mighty general a deliverer just like when we came out of pentecost coming to this message the prophet's ministry looking for another great outpouring and a powerful uh end-time revival of that nature we were looking for that because that's what we've seen in the past not realizing that what god was going to give on his giving is in a different way to accomplish the same goals and more than that amen glorifying his people not just creating squirrels but translating and changing people from glory unto glory and placing them right into the rapture generation to come into the presence of the living god hallelujah amen they're getting all kinds of digital information we are getting supernatural revelation by god's broadcast through the holy spirit coming into the crystal the gene within your heart within your soul and inspiring you and filling you with the glory divine hallelujah amen yes sir hallelujah when those those great wise men they were so wise they followed the star but when they came contrary to what is being taught the myths that are taught and the religious lies that are propagated those wise men never went to any manger they never found joseph and mary in a manger the bible tells us if you will read matthew 2 where i just read says they found the child and his mother in a house and he was not an infant and at this stage the message since 63 has come out of its infancy all praise god and is growing now standing on its own two feet but old and new testament it's walking for itself and beginning to talk for itself god is now in his bright form revealing his own word and interpreting his own word by his holy spirit for when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth and show you things to come blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah praise god amen when they found that child he was haunted by these other nations he was hated by the great dignitaries he was misunderstood by even the religious people of that day an hour and some were even questioning the circumstances surrounding his birth about an angel coming and speaking and saying things like that they were questioning the circumstances of his birth hallelujah thank god years have passed since this message has struck the earth and it's come to this stage now hallelujah where the revealed word of the hour is no longer within the manger of the heart of the prophet william branham the message is now standing on its own two feet the revelation is making itself known and interpret god interpreting his own word hallelujah thank god and speaking for himself through his word glory be to god amen yes sir listen accept a man be born again he shall in no wise he shall in no wise he won't be a wise man oh praise god hallelujah brother sister take god for his blessed word he won't be able to enter the kingdom of the living god the entry point into the kingdom oh the way to glory or the portals of god the way the truth the life into christ hallelujah glory to his name hallelujah thank god wise men are usually hungry for the word that's why they chase after it they follow it till they find it in every way blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled glory to god hallelujah friends the wise men were truly wise there were wise because they brought to him their gifts which means that before they left their land their nation their country they already had whether you wanted to call it a fuzzy revelation but they had some kind of a revelation each one had an individual revelation because one saw him bringing gold to represent that he saw him reveal to him as king king and the other one had a revelation of him and he saw him as the great high priest hallelujah lord of god oh my praise god the last one saw him amen he saw him he brought mer and he saw him by his revelation that he was the true lamb not the substitute animals but the true lamb that was supposed to die and become their savior and that he was born to die and so he brought myrrh to represent that my friends so we see them bringing gold frankincense and myrrh represented representing kingship deity on divinity frankincense representing his intercessory ministry and priesthood and his mediatorship all glory to god hallelujah murr representing his death oh my and his post and position as redeemer to bring redemption for the entire world that the people who sat in darkness shall see a great light and the glory of god has sprung up arise awake and come to the light for the for the praise god the light is reason and the word is giving us light for this day and for this hour hallelujah oh praise god god came in flesh as his own prophet to make himself known thank god in this hour may we be wise like the wise men and come to god and god give to him all of our talents all of our gifts that he has given us let us give our lives as not dead animal sacrifices back there but give your life as a living sacrifice living and sacrificing for this message and the things you may and must go through as a living sacrifice for the glory of the living god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah also let us give him our gifts of our lives today let us magnify and glorify him by the way we live today let us adore him magnify him by the lies we show we express to the world everywhere for his glory and for his honor praise god now after they had given to the christ in actual fact to his spirits hallelujah after they had given the appropriate gifts amen that reflected who he was his birth his life and his death they left and began to return back to their own country but they were sought out by herod and i must tell you when you have caught this revelation they may not understand what you are saying everything you're saying but they're recognized you caught something and they would like to know where that came from and how can we get it what mean it this how men and brethren what shall we do to get it can we buy it can we question you and ask you about it amen so they were sought out by herod and his people because herod didn't catch the revelation the rabbis didn't catch it his wise men his astrologers didn't catch it at that time but he wanted to have an intellectual knowledge or understanding of that revelation of who this christ was this anointed word was this king god king word king of righteousness king of peace if he wanted to have an understanding of what was going on in his kingdom and what did they really find out what did they discover or he wanted an explanation what was it what is it that's revealed to you let me know this amen hallelujah and the wise men knew this what was made known to them by god himself being warned of god in a dream i know better said the servant and prophet of god to go tell you a revelation of what god has made known to me until it's already in progress and it happens and then it's too late satan can do nothing oh praise god being warned in a dream said the bible matthew chapter 2 verse 12 their return to their own country the bible says another way that did not go back the same way they came and if you come listen recognize and this revelation strikes your heart you'll never return the same way that you came in i'm not just talking about uh a sinner in the street a homeless person or some body out there that knows uh nothing about the god right in this message hearing all the courts reading all the scriptures reading all the texts following it for many years but never really caught the true light that shine it in this hour but if you open your heart if you are one of those elected seed you will truly see for that is the identification of the spoken word bride of christ giving you eyes to see an ears to hear others sitting right there beside you will not understand not one thing they'll understand the english but they won't understand they third pull the fullness of the word of god that is being known in this day and this hour we are in the same position my eyes have seen the coming of the glory of the lord oh he is tripling out his vintage the grips of wrath of sword oh praise god forevermore hallelujah amen i've seen the king brother sister i seen the lord of hosts in the word of god said that isaiah i say the same thing i see the lord high and lifted up before me and his train fills the temple praise god forevermore once seeing him you can't remain the same you're going to go back another way you're going to return not the same way you were but you're going to return a different person because your eyes have seen the lord of hosts your eyes have caught a glimpse appear pierce the veil beyond the veil and looked into glory and recognize the man that's passing on the rock oh glory god hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise god they went back a different way they did not return by those gates by which they entered in they did not go back to their denominational gates they did not return to ask questions of herod the wise men the rabbi the learned man the religious leaders the dignitaries oh my god the bible says being warned of god in the dream they went around and went out by a different way all glory be unto god hallelujah amen oh my friends i tell you things are different now since i gave my heart to jesus this understanding of the word has opened up a different way yes said the prophet now that the word has opened up this bible has become a new bible to me glory to god a different way has opened up hallelujah oh my glory to his marvelous wonderful name that we have seen here in the word of god hallelujah by which we must escape quickly escape quickly run for your life hallelujah come here quickly flee for the mountains flee to the mountaintop lord of god hallelujah i was in israel some time ago and while there they pointed out to me a great pillar of salt standing by the shores of the dead sea where sodom and gomorrah lies buried beneath the dead sea and there on its backs stands that pillar of salt which is thought to be lot's wife all my friends flee into this capstone revelation of this day and of this hour don't look back don't look back to those seven church ages don't look back to the wonderful things that happened over there but place your eyes upon god's word for this day and for this hour hallelujah don't lust long or desire for all the wonderful things that were in the seven church ages a soother street miracles signs wonders all manner of things that would astonish your mind and your heart put your trust in the truth and in the living god and don't lust for those things you say what are you talking about it was there in pentecost it was there under the genuine pentecost of acts 2 4 but i'm telling you keep your eyes on the word ask god for wisdom revelation of the word like solomon did and when you have cut that all these other things will be added on to you all the other things you did not ask for all the signs all the wonders all the miracles all the supernatural all the divine graces and powers and presences and anointings of the living god will just follow your life and follow you amen praise god because like solomon you're asking god for the wisest greatest things that's wise why i take the wisdom of the wise men and i pray you'll take the wisdom of the wise men also praise god hallelujah or praise god may god give you all that your heart desires may he reveal to you his greatest good even though you did not ask for riches fame fortune lusted after the things that were in those ages yet god will grant to you the things your hearts desire for behold a greater than solomon is now here may god bless you i tell you happy new year a happy and a blessed and

and moral support takes me to god i also want to thank you for your various prayers for me personally for the church i want to thank you for your emotional strength for even when jesus was in the garden of gethsemane the bible says and angels came to straighten him i ask god that he will use some of you your lies your ministry to be a strength an encouragement to me and to all the other ministers everywhere who are preaching the word of god with all their heart and all their soul may the spirit of god bless them use them and use you to be pillars in the temple of my god blessed be his name lord of god forevermore yes sir praise god friends because of the presence circumstances because of the shutdowns that we are experiencing we are not able to meet in our tabernacle face to face and to enjoy one another's presence fellowship we can do that on the phone and do it through media but that's good but it's not the same as when we meet and talk and fellowship together around the world and assemble for his glorious name on the lord's day and open up the lord's book to give glory to the lord's name my friends this is a testing time 2021 a testing time a year of testing a time of testing it's a sifting time it's a time where god is proving his word because god is trying to prove us us to our faithfulness to his revealed word of this hour our action to reaction how do we react to the circumstances and to his word amen will we wonder about the word because of these dignitaries rabbis and uh men out there that claim they can read the stars also they have some understanding of the messenger are we to begin to cause them to say things that will make you wonder and then after you start start wondering will they cause you to wander away from the message of the hour the word of god given for this day and for this time will you become a piece of dry duck a dried up driftwood card away on the tides of time oh my brother my sister look to the word of god look to the lamb of god hallelujah don't allow in this hour for god is doing it he has put every one of us on an individual basis away from pastor away from this away from church away from that one away from the other one that he might personally try you and prove you as to your personal fate not that you are propped up like a tomato plant not that you are held up together but god wants to see your faith in his word and he is now proving his word and testing you in the wilderness of this day and of this hour just in you as to our meeting to worship friends let me say to you it's now all up to you it's up to you each must answer for him herself or himself you can decide to go back to or into denominationalism where you came from or you can start to claim the message but you're edging and inching your way to the border land to go enter into pentecostalism and back to that yet claiming to be following the message of the hour knowing full well you can't see the rest of it you only saw that far but you cannot see the rest of it until he will reveal it to you please my friends i pray that god will keep you in this hour may god help us all pray for me as we are now ministering online

god's word for his glory and honor god bless you god bless you real good you know uh this is definitely a wonderful time that we're living in right now as sons and daughters of god to be able to be the wise men in this day and in this hour to recognize what god is actually doing you know you look at 2020 and um you know it's only once every hundred years that the numbers will come together like that and you can just look at 2020 and the significance of it and how you know um here we are a hundred years later in another pandemic the last one was like a hundred years ago and uh you know history kind of repeating itself but you know it's it's pretty significant now we're entering into back in the 1920s they called it the roaring 20s and it was a time where civilization was basically going from horse and buggy to the motor car and here we are now entering into the roaring 20s again and what are we doing we're going from gasoline vehicles to electric vehicles and the information and the technology and the way that everything is moving and even the technology you know i i i looked into certain technologies that are happening right now um genome sequencing they call it where they're able to actually you know analyze your molecules and be able to tell you you know if there's certain ailments you know diabetes or cancer in your cells already they're going to those levels what is it telling us as the sons of god that we're basically entering into that dimensional change we're breaking into levels of information into the mind of god like never before so if anything i think that we can look into 2020 as probably going to be one of the most exciting years that we've ever experienced especially in the lord amen i don't know brother mike you think that the rapture could happen this year certainly could it certainly could praise the lord get ready hey that's what we're going to do is uh everybody who's still uh with us can turn on your cameras and make sure that
