[34:27] i hope you are too
[34:30] god bless you for his grace please be
[34:32] seated
[34:34] we want to thank god for all of you that
[34:36] are here today by his grace
[34:39] and for those of you who are uh watching
[34:43] or listening online
[34:46] just to let you know over the past week
[34:49] we had to take uh
[34:52] severe measures
[34:54] uh
[34:56] as you know the
[34:58] authority of a pastor on the earth is
[35:01] even more than that of an angel in
[35:04] heaven
[35:06] and so
[35:08] we
[35:10] determined uh
[35:12] led by the holy spirit not to wait on
[35:14] the government to mandate anything
[35:18] because we are the ones that really have
[35:20] the spiritual authority for that matter
[35:24] and
[35:26] as we are the family of god as our
[35:28] brother saying
[35:29] and we ought to love the family of god
[35:33] then we need to obey the scriptures as
[35:36] paul taught and brother branham taught
[35:39] that we who are strong
[35:42] ought to humble ourselves
[35:44] make way for those who are weak
[35:48] and because we have
[35:50] children
[35:51] we have
[35:53] respectable
[35:55] honored
[35:56] older folk
[35:57] within our services
[36:00] then we have to make way for them
[36:04] people with low immune deficiencies
[36:07] we have to make way for them
[36:11] and therefore
[36:13] um
[36:14] we
[36:15] let the email go out
[36:18] that only those who have been vaccinated
[36:23] will be allowed to come within
[36:26] the walls of this church
[36:29] the government is going to mandate that
[36:32] sometime in the future but we are not
[36:34] like i said waiting on them
[36:36] so i want you to be assured that when
[36:39] you walk in here
[36:41] that
[36:43] the people that are in here
[36:45] are
[36:46] vaccinated
[36:48] that does not mean anyone can be a
[36:50] carrier
[36:51] right
[36:52] but the fact is because the other people
[36:55] are vaccinated they have a great measure
[36:58] of protection
[37:00] and we want to thank god for that and i
[37:02] want to thank god uh for all those of
[37:05] you
[37:06] who were uh humbly enough
[37:08] simply enough
[37:10] to believe the word of god and the
[37:12] directives of his
[37:14] officers and servant
[37:16] and you have obeyed it and you are here
[37:19] today by god's grace
[37:22] hopefully that those who are not
[37:25] vaccinated
[37:26] will get vaccinated and soon as the
[37:30] bible says
[37:31] not just watch the services on
[37:34] television or on tv or youtube but the
[37:38] bible says forsake not the assembling of
[37:41] yourselves together as the manner
[37:44] of some is so let's do all we can
[37:48] so that we can
[37:49] assemble together
[37:51] safely and wisely
[37:54] i've always said through the years
[37:57] do all you can
[38:00] and then
[38:01] you know
[38:02] stand do your best first of all
[38:07] then let god do the rest
[38:09] but not drop your hands and say oh god
[38:11] is going to protect me god is good no no
[38:14] he will allow you to do whatever you can
[38:19] and when you search the message you find
[38:22] brother branham's kids
[38:24] um get cold and he'll take them to the
[38:27] doctor was it that he didn't have faith
[38:30] yeah but why why does he have to
[38:32] exercise the fate for something like
[38:35] that when there is
[38:37] natural healing staring you in the face
[38:40] right i don't want to go back to my old
[38:42] message some people are going to be
[38:44] dying on the doctor's doorstep
[38:47] the prescription
[38:49] the antidote is right in front of them
[38:52] but they refuse to use it because they
[38:55] think they know best they become doctors
[38:58] and scientists and
[39:00] got more faith than the prophet and
[39:02] everything else like that so let's trust
[39:06] that
[39:07] god will help our brothers and sisters
[39:11] you know they can believe what they want
[39:13] that's
[39:14] you got a right to do that
[39:16] but the facts are staring you in the
[39:18] face
[39:19] and we all have to uh react to those
[39:23] facts may the lord bless you just
[39:25] thought i'd say a few remarks
[39:27] on this matter now of course if people
[39:31] were to
[39:32] uh go and travel and then come back if
[39:36] you are
[39:37] already vaccinated just like in the
[39:40] natural world you don't really have to
[39:43] go and separate yourself
[39:45] you can still be here in the service
[39:47] because you're already been vaccinated
[39:50] okay so let the lord have his way and
[39:53] bless us each one for his glory and
[39:56] honor praise the lord amen
[40:00] god bless you
[40:02] well i'd like to speak today
[40:05] for a while on
[40:07] the seven mysterious thunders
[40:11] right
[40:12] that is the topic the seven mysterious
[40:16] thunders
[40:17] that is found in revelation chapter 10
[40:20] verses 1 to 7.
[40:23] other places in the book of revelation
[40:25] but we want to
[40:27] use that as our
[40:29] as our
[40:30] text
[40:32] amen
[40:43] it's all part of the
[40:45] of the
[40:46] series of the topic of the eternal
[40:48] church age
[40:50] and i'm jumping over a few things here
[40:53] just to get to this because it's so
[40:55] juicy to me
[40:57] revelation 10 1-7 shall we read uh
[41:01] together
[41:02] if there's anything i've forgotten
[41:04] brothers you you brothers can
[41:07] absolutely remind me okay uh praise the
[41:10] lord any announcement or anything let us
[41:12] read together
[41:14] and this is john the apostle speaking
[41:18] he's caught up in the spirit
[41:21] on the isle of patmos
[41:23] and if you're going to get anything done
[41:26] for god you first got to get in the
[41:28] spirit
[41:30] and while in the spirit
[41:32] john is saying
[41:35] and i saw
[41:37] another mighty angel
[41:40] come down from heaven
[41:42] clothed with a cloud
[41:45] and a rainbow was upon his head
[41:48] and his face was as it were the sun
[41:53] and his feet as pillars of fire
[41:57] and he had in his hand
[42:00] a little book open
[42:03] and he set his right foot up on the sea
[42:07] and his left foot on the earth
[42:10] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[42:13] lion roared and when he had cried seven
[42:17] thunders uttered their voices
[42:20] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[42:22] their voices
[42:23] i was about to write
[42:26] and i heard a voice from heaven saying
[42:28] unto me seal up those things which the
[42:33] seven thunders uttered and write them
[42:36] not
[42:38] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[42:40] sea and upon the earth
[42:42] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[42:46] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[42:49] created heaven and the things that
[42:51] therein are and the earth and the things
[42:54] that therein are and the sea and the
[42:57] things which are therein that there
[43:00] should be
[43:02] time
[43:03] no longer amen
[43:06] father we thank thee for the reading of
[43:08] thy word we thank you for the open
[43:11] hearts of your people
[43:13] we thank you for the inspiration
[43:16] to
[43:17] bring forth thy word from the word for
[43:20] we ask it in jesus name amen and amen
[43:24] praise the lord
[43:26] please be seated
[43:28] last week of course we spoke on the
[43:31] topic of the eternal
[43:34] church age
[43:36] and um i don't want you to think that
[43:40] and this is for you who are believers
[43:42] and those who are out on youtube and in
[43:45] various areas that will hear me um this
[43:50] topic
[43:51] i don't want you to think that this was
[43:53] the figment
[43:55] of my own imagination
[43:58] of what i think or what i believe
[44:02] and just presenting something to you
[44:06] that is way out because it's not
[44:09] you know
[44:10] as i pointed that you directly
[44:14] to
[44:15] the
[44:16] quotation
[44:18] that came from brother william marion
[44:21] branham
[44:23] the 20th century prophet
[44:26] the messenger to the seventh uh church
[44:29] age
[44:31] that you know spoke to us
[44:34] clearly for he was the messenger to the
[44:37] leodician church age
[44:39] which is the pentecostal
[44:42] church age
[44:43] and in a message stature of a perfect
[44:46] man
[44:47] in 1960
[44:49] [Music]
[44:51] amen
[44:53] there
[44:55] he spoke and said that he is waiting for
[44:58] that time
[45:01] when that man or that woman
[45:03] will come along
[45:05] those ones that are going to go into the
[45:08] eternal church age
[45:10] he
[45:12] uses the term
[45:14] the eternal church age
[45:17] so it's not something that was made up
[45:20] it's something that he said
[45:22] perfectly in the word of god
[45:25] hallelujah
[45:27] now i want you to notice that before
[45:30] brother branham was even allowed
[45:34] to see the revelation of the seven seals
[45:38] he already
[45:40] knew
[45:41] that there was going to be an eternal
[45:44] church age because he already told us
[45:47] after seven days of a week you've got to
[45:50] go back to the first day
[45:54] the week is ended
[45:56] and then you go back to the original
[46:00] first day
[46:01] the way things were
[46:03] that's the the simple principle of the
[46:06] word of god
[46:08] amen
[46:09] hallelujah
[46:10] and so
[46:12] he knew clearly
[46:13] that there had to be
[46:15] an eternal church age
[46:19] at the ending of the seals
[46:22] at the end
[46:24] of the seals
[46:25] and of course
[46:27] the seven church ages as we know it
[46:30] as you can see it right behind me
[46:33] they deal with time
[46:36] i call that the seven day week
[46:39] god's seven day week he's dealt with
[46:43] seven church ages
[46:45] during a period of time
[46:49] and
[46:50] but this eternal church age has nothing
[46:53] to do with time this church age is
[46:57] eternal
[46:59] and since he said it was eternal
[47:04] then
[47:05] the people who will inhabit
[47:08] that
[47:09] eternal church age
[47:11] must
[47:12] necessarily be eternal also themselves
[47:17] then if there is a church age eternal
[47:21] church age which really uh in the not in
[47:25] the spiritual sense that it can't be an
[47:28] age
[47:29] but those terms were used by him so we
[47:31] can understand what he's talking about
[47:34] because he's talking about eternity
[47:37] right and the concept of eternity your
[47:39] mind our minds
[47:42] is not expanded enough to take that in
[47:45] so he used terms that we can uh be able
[47:49] to grasp
[47:50] so he said eternal church age eternal
[47:53] people therefore there has to be an
[47:55] eternal messenger
[47:58] the messenger also has to be eternal
[48:02] therefore let no man think of himself
[48:05] that maybe he is the next messenger
[48:08] because the
[48:10] messenger this one we're talking about
[48:12] is the lord himself
[48:16] who shall descend with a shout the voice
[48:18] of an archangel the trump of god
[48:21] he is the eternal messenger
[48:25] jesus christ hallelujah praise the lord
[48:28] and if this this eternal
[48:31] church age like the prophet said
[48:34] starts at the end of those seals
[48:38] then
[48:39] then it must be in progress right now
[48:43] and it means we are in the middle of it
[48:45] right
[48:46] now and only those who are made to
[48:49] become conscious of it
[48:52] or
[48:53] it's revealed to them
[48:55] will be fully aware
[48:58] then that they have already started to
[49:00] be caught up
[49:03] into another dimension of revelation and
[49:06] truth
[49:07] which will
[49:08] change as you and morphe
[49:11] right into the rapturing grace of god
[49:16] that is why without these seven thunders
[49:19] you can't have rapturing revelation
[49:22] rapturing faith
[49:24] for the rapturing grace of god
[49:28] that will not heal you but change your
[49:30] entire being
[49:32] and take you into the presence of
[49:34] almighty god
[49:36] hallelujah
[49:38] amen
[49:40] glory to god
[49:41] now
[49:43] we must see here
[49:45] that john
[49:46] saw the book
[49:49] and
[49:50] he began to weep
[49:52] but later on he was told don't weep john
[49:56] the lamb has prevailed
[49:59] to
[50:00] open the seven seals
[50:02] hallelujah
[50:04] and john
[50:06] heard a voice saying come and see
[50:09] when john looked praised god he did not
[50:13] read his name
[50:15] but he saw symbols
[50:18] for in the book was a lot of symbols
[50:21] and he saw his name in symbol form he
[50:25] saw himself
[50:26] acting out or living out the the
[50:29] scriptures he
[50:31] and the people of his age were supposed
[50:34] to fulfill
[50:35] he saw all of that happen and realized
[50:38] that if he could see that then his name
[50:41] was in the book
[50:44] and he began to shout
[50:46] and he began to praise god and i believe
[50:49] you will shout and you will praise god
[50:52] when you recognize that is becoming for
[50:55] you to fulfill all righteousness all of
[50:59] the word for your day and for your time
[51:03] hallelujah amen he saw himself
[51:06] fulfilling scripture
[51:08] and recognize that that was the evidence
[51:12] that his name was
[51:14] on the book
[51:15] amen
[51:16] and to fulfill scripture
[51:18] we don't just go out
[51:21] like consciously deciding well i'm going
[51:24] to fulfill the scripture you can and god
[51:26] will help you but the fact is because
[51:30] you were born to that purpose you will
[51:32] be walking right into the fulfillment of
[51:35] scripture whatever you say and do
[51:38] because the holy spirit is leading you
[51:42] back where you come from
[51:44] hallelujah and you realize that you can
[51:47] sing the song not by a music but by
[51:52] revelation i'm one of them
[51:55] i'm one of them
[51:57] i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of
[52:00] them hallelujah i'm one of them
[52:04] no matter what anybody says i know that
[52:08] i'm one of them by the grace of god
[52:11] hallelujah amen
[52:14] john
[52:15] the bible tells us come and see
[52:18] and when the one the first seal was
[52:20] opened or the seal was open and by the
[52:23] way the coats i'm gonna use mainly out
[52:25] of the first seal the right through the
[52:27] seal book but mainly from the first seal
[52:29] around page 125 when going on up amen
[52:33] john said come and see
[52:35] turn the blast amen praise god john
[52:40] heard the thunder's blessed amen but not
[52:44] just the thunderblast he heard a voice
[52:47] amen a lot of people are here and
[52:50] thunders
[52:51] but they haven't heard what the thunder
[52:54] said
[52:55] like the disciples in the bible with
[52:58] jesus they heard the thunder on the
[53:00] mountains amen but the rest of them
[53:04] didn't understand what the thunder was
[53:06] saying
[53:08] listen there's a lot of people and great
[53:10] men have talked about these seven
[53:13] thunders in the past and they were right
[53:16] on target but it wasn't uh all truth it
[53:20] wasn't the fullness of it it hadn't come
[53:23] to its rightness yet but they caught
[53:26] something that will open the eyes and
[53:28] the heart and the mind of all the others
[53:31] coming behind praise god and we thank
[53:34] god for them and the holy spirit
[53:36] confirmed it that it is the word of god
[53:40] amen so we thank god
[53:43] for these great seven
[53:45] mysterious thunders
[53:48] and the first one that blasted john
[53:51] heard
[53:52] the
[53:53] the voice speaking and looked and
[53:56] whenever you look or anybody through the
[53:59] ages really look
[54:01] in the book after that the word is open
[54:05] to them or the thunder speaks to them
[54:08] they're going to seek their name in the
[54:10] book and develop a certainty of god and
[54:14] their develop a rapture in faith they're
[54:17] going to know that my name is on that
[54:20] book hallelujah and they're knowing that
[54:22] they are now in progress in the progress
[54:26] of the rapture amen lord of god they're
[54:28] not imagining it
[54:31] they know it
[54:32] they can't bring you into it
[54:35] they can bring anybody into it
[54:38] it's only the holy spirit can bring them
[54:41] into this secret
[54:42] hallelujah amen because you know what
[54:46] this turk pull is not going to be
[54:49] copycat it is not going to be
[54:52] impersonated because it's only revealed
[54:56] and the revelation is given only by
[55:00] god's grace
[55:02] hallelujah only given by god's
[55:07] wonderful grace hallelujah amen oh
[55:11] praise god
[55:13] listen
[55:14] now
[55:15] the lamb knew
[55:17] that there were names put in there from
[55:21] the foundation of the world
[55:24] and as long as those names
[55:28] have never been
[55:30] made
[55:30] manifested on the earth as yet
[55:34] amen
[55:35] you see he had to stay there
[55:38] as an intercessor amen there's our
[55:43] predestination
[55:44] hallelujah he had to stay there until
[55:49] the last church age and the last names
[55:53] that were in the book
[55:55] were made manifested that don't mean
[55:58] just naturally born but it means a
[56:01] manifested son or daughter of god who
[56:04] have caught the revelation
[56:06] of the holy spirit amen and they are
[56:09] born again and made manifest hallelujah
[56:13] amen oh praise god the man manifests
[56:16] upon the earth to give god glory amen oh
[56:21] he came only to die brother branham said
[56:24] for those whom god have ordained to
[56:28] eternal life
[56:30] and by by for knowledge
[56:32] he saw them
[56:34] amen his will was that none should
[56:38] perish
[56:40] but by his foreknowledge
[56:42] he knew those who would perish and those
[56:45] who would not
[56:47] amen but his will
[56:50] is that god so loved the world
[56:52] amen that whosoever believeth in him
[56:55] should not perish but have everlasting
[56:59] life
[57:00] but yet
[57:01] saying that he knew those who would and
[57:04] those who will not
[57:06] amen now you see out there they just
[57:08] have this big white net where they just
[57:10] say you know whoever loves god or
[57:13] whatever you know it's just like any
[57:14] woman that loves me that doesn't make
[57:16] her my wife
[57:18] you see
[57:19] that's
[57:20] anybody that loves jesus that doesn't
[57:22] make them a christian
[57:24] you can love him but as if he already
[57:26] shown his love for you by extending his
[57:29] grace to you
[57:31] by extending to you his hand like the
[57:34] king and esther had to reach out with
[57:36] the scepter before she could even come
[57:39] in and talk to him
[57:41] and that's the way we are now the
[57:43] scepter of his grace has got to be
[57:46] extended to you glory to god amen so
[57:51] brother sister
[57:53] we want to thank god
[57:55] because it's only
[57:57] with the sounding of the thunders
[58:00] that we are going to
[58:01] really be able to
[58:03] understand and hear and know who we are
[58:08] and what we were raised up for glory to
[58:11] god hallelujah amen
[58:14] now we know that we are no longer in the
[58:17] pentecostal age how many knows that
[58:21] brother branham
[58:23] was the messenger of the leodision
[58:29] pentecostal
[58:30] age
[58:32] hallelujah
[58:34] and then if we are not any longer
[58:39] in the
[58:40] uh laodicean church age
[58:43] then where are we at
[58:45] what is our position then
[58:48] in this statue of a perfect man
[58:52] in this
[58:54] great diagram of the ages
[58:57] you're not in any of those ages
[59:00] so where are you at
[59:02] uh
[59:02] uh are we just out there
[59:04] wandering around floating around uh
[59:08] worrying and wondering where we are at
[59:11] amen because i will tell you right now
[59:14] our names
[59:17] are not identified
[59:20] with those seven church ages
[59:23] your names are not identified
[59:25] with those seven church ages
[59:28] oh praise god hallelujah
[59:31] because my friends we've got to think
[59:34] has god forgotten us
[59:36] are we outside of his memory
[59:39] that he can't even remember us any more
[59:43] but there's got to be somewhere
[59:46] where we have our names identified
[59:50] within the great book of life praise god
[59:55] amen glory to god i tell you friends
[59:58] that we got to find our place we got to
[1:00:00] know our position we got to know where
[1:00:02] we are and when i say knowing your
[1:00:04] position in christ the word you got to
[1:00:07] know whether you're in luther wesley
[1:00:10] that's how you know your position
[1:00:12] some people get a different idea they
[1:00:15] put it there presuming and all kinds of
[1:00:16] stuff and what your position is and and
[1:00:19] you got to find your position and and
[1:00:22] you know
[1:00:22] pushing people to pray and ask god to
[1:00:25] show you if you're a prophet yeah are
[1:00:28] you a prophet brother
[1:00:30] are you deacon are you
[1:00:32] administrations you got the gifts of
[1:00:34] this or that and pushing people along
[1:00:36] that line but it is to know your
[1:00:38] position in christ
[1:00:40] the word
[1:00:42] what is your position hallelujah yes you
[1:00:46] might have come up under in the seventh
[1:00:49] church age but of what spirit are you
[1:00:53] are you of the first year change are you
[1:00:56] of the second are you of luther and
[1:00:59] lutheran spirit on you or catholic or
[1:01:02] whatever you must know your position in
[1:01:04] christ
[1:01:06] hallelujah and so we opt to know what it
[1:01:09] is
[1:01:10] quote brother branham
[1:01:12] now
[1:01:13] here is the plan he's talking about
[1:01:16] god's plan now
[1:01:18] here is the plan
[1:01:20] here's the plan of it
[1:01:22] the first thing happens
[1:01:25] there is an announcement
[1:01:28] and what happens a seal is opened
[1:01:32] what is that
[1:01:34] it's a mystery that is unfolded
[1:01:38] and when a mystery unfolds a trumpet
[1:01:41] sounds
[1:01:43] it declares
[1:01:45] a war
[1:01:47] a spiritual war
[1:01:49] then a plague falls
[1:01:52] and another church age opens
[1:01:55] amen
[1:01:56] praise god
[1:01:58] oh praise god brother sister you hear
[1:02:00] what that said a plague falls
[1:02:04] and another church age
[1:02:06] opens
[1:02:07] oh praise god he said now you know
[1:02:10] there's all kinds of plagues there's not
[1:02:12] just one kind of plagues but there are
[1:02:15] several kinds of plagues you gotta
[1:02:16] understand what he's talking about here
[1:02:19] amen now what is the war for
[1:02:23] amen what is this spiritual war for the
[1:02:26] war comes because the eyes of certain
[1:02:30] believers are open to the lord and some
[1:02:35] like minds and eyes are left blinded
[1:02:39] and they can't see what you're talking
[1:02:41] about
[1:02:42] and it creates a spiritual war or clash
[1:02:46] of ideas clash of thoughts
[1:02:50] clash about the truths that are embodied
[1:02:53] within the word of god hallelujah amen
[1:02:58] and so
[1:03:00] we see
[1:03:01] it's a great plan
[1:03:03] until it comes to that last angel
[1:03:06] see
[1:03:07] oh
[1:03:08] no
[1:03:09] he has no certain mystery
[1:03:12] amen
[1:03:13] all them truths that wasn't fully
[1:03:15] revealed yet
[1:03:16] see as the revelation comes he reveals
[1:03:21] those
[1:03:22] things in his days if you want to read
[1:03:25] it revelation 10 1 to 4 i'm quoting
[1:03:30] brother branham here he
[1:03:32] takes the book of seals and he breaks
[1:03:35] them
[1:03:36] and shows
[1:03:38] them to the seventh angel see the lamb
[1:03:41] breaks the seals but he only shows them
[1:03:44] to the seventh right
[1:03:46] angel the seventh angel doesn't break
[1:03:49] the seals
[1:03:50] if the lamb breaks the seals
[1:03:53] and as brother branham says and then he
[1:03:56] takes them and he shows them to the
[1:03:59] seventh angel
[1:04:01] the mysteries of god
[1:04:03] is the ministry of the seventh angel
[1:04:06] now we have just come through the church
[1:04:09] ages
[1:04:11] using even history to prove that
[1:04:16] it is the angel's message
[1:04:19] of that seventh church
[1:04:22] listen
[1:04:23] it reveals all the mysteries
[1:04:26] that has been
[1:04:28] in the past
[1:04:32] the
[1:04:32] the church ages
[1:04:34] you must realize if you go back and you
[1:04:37] really look at them
[1:04:38] they're telling you
[1:04:40] of the past
[1:04:42] and they're revealing to you
[1:04:45] the trail of the serpent
[1:04:48] it revealing to you
[1:04:50] the mystery of inequity
[1:04:53] as it
[1:04:54] twisted its way
[1:04:56] through the history of the past
[1:05:00] listen
[1:05:01] it reveals all things that had been in
[1:05:04] the past
[1:05:05] and then he repeats it again remember
[1:05:08] all things
[1:05:10] in the past
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:14] all the things in the past
[1:05:16] revelation remember he says again
[1:05:20] revelation 10 1-7
[1:05:24] that is to be
[1:05:27] that is to be
[1:05:30] hallelujah
[1:05:31] remember
[1:05:32] in the days of the seven angel his
[1:05:35] sounding fourth blasting forth the
[1:05:38] gospel trumpet he is to finish
[1:05:41] right he is the finish the mysteries of
[1:05:44] god
[1:05:45] hallelujah mine think of it friends
[1:05:49] the progress of how it goes from
[1:05:52] doctrine saying
[1:05:54] doctrine and then the doctrine becomes a
[1:05:57] statue and then
[1:06:00] they take the statue and start to become
[1:06:04] a church
[1:06:05] see and that's how it was through the
[1:06:08] dark ages
[1:06:09] with reformation with luther and so on
[1:06:12] they he came genuine messenger wesley
[1:06:16] and so on and so on and then along came
[1:06:20] the pentecostal age
[1:06:23] with the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:29] and their cabbage down on that
[1:06:34] they go right down
[1:06:36] on the baptisma holy spirit
[1:06:38] and that's where they put their their
[1:06:40] signpost
[1:06:41] right there on the baptism of the holy
[1:06:43] spirit
[1:06:44] right oh my
[1:06:46] but you see
[1:06:48] there cannot be no more ages
[1:06:52] hallelujah i'm quoting brother branham
[1:06:54] there cannot be no more ages
[1:06:58] hallelujah that is all of it
[1:07:02] that leodysion church age
[1:07:04] amen
[1:07:05] and we found that by studying scripture
[1:07:09] that the messenger of an age
[1:07:12] he said notice
[1:07:15] comes right at the end of the edge
[1:07:20] not at the beginning
[1:07:22] but the messenger comes
[1:07:25] at the end
[1:07:26] of the age
[1:07:28] hallelujah praise god so
[1:07:31] paul didn't come
[1:07:33] at the beginning of pentecost
[1:07:36] he come when that age was about to end
[1:07:40] is that right oh my think about it now
[1:07:44] i'm not going to bring in here and tell
[1:07:46] you about the cornerstone right now how
[1:07:48] a corner stone always points two sides
[1:07:51] where it came from and then it points
[1:07:53] you to the new age that's coming up
[1:07:55] because it's a cornerstone amen and they
[1:07:58] always reject the cornerstone anyway
[1:08:00] praise the lord hallelujah but they're
[1:08:02] going to find out later that those
[1:08:04] cornerstones mini cornerstones was
[1:08:07] really the head stone
[1:08:09] amen praise god glory to god so then
[1:08:13] brothers paul came at the end of the
[1:08:16] pentecostal age
[1:08:19] not at the beginning
[1:08:20] brother branham came at the end
[1:08:24] of this modern pentecostal age
[1:08:28] that they had up there in jesus street
[1:08:32] not at the beginning of it but at the
[1:08:34] end of it
[1:08:36] and so a lot of people don't recognize
[1:08:40] that he
[1:08:43] is not the messenger
[1:08:45] for this eternal one i'm talking about
[1:08:50] but that he was the messenger for the
[1:08:52] last one that just ended
[1:08:55] because he says that ledician messenger
[1:08:59] was the messenger to that pentecostal
[1:09:02] edge back there and all them ages are
[1:09:06] over
[1:09:07] they're gone hallelujah
[1:09:10] he came during the pentecostal age
[1:09:14] there he was
[1:09:16] that messenger praised the lord but
[1:09:18] thank god he was a cornerstone
[1:09:20] he not only uh
[1:09:23] gathered up all the
[1:09:25] lost truths and all the twisted up
[1:09:28] scribbled up things of the edge and
[1:09:30] straightened it back out
[1:09:32] but he also before he left the scene
[1:09:35] pointed and said behold the lamb of god
[1:09:38] that takes away the sins of the world
[1:09:42] amen praise god hallelujah so that's his
[1:09:46] twofold ministry
[1:09:49] tell this year
[1:09:51] and
[1:09:52] the his ministry to the bride
[1:09:56] pointing her not to himself but pointing
[1:09:59] her to the mighty angel the lamb of god
[1:10:03] that broke the seals the mighty god
[1:10:06] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:10:08] and forever pointing heart revealed word
[1:10:12] the open book now
[1:10:14] put your eyes upon jesus hallelujah and
[1:10:17] look away to him
[1:10:18] amen glory to god so the mighty angel
[1:10:22] using that prophet body
[1:10:25] started to
[1:10:26] speak to his chil to his wife
[1:10:29] by the opening of the word praise the
[1:10:33] lord glory to god hallelujah i'm so
[1:10:36] thankful amen that that pentecostal age
[1:10:42] amen was able to hear the prophet
[1:10:45] beginning the voice
[1:10:47] of god in his last days
[1:10:50] bringing the
[1:10:51] uh rapturing to grace truths
[1:10:54] through the prophet of god and they're
[1:10:56] rejected
[1:10:58] not a prophet but the headstone
[1:11:02] for that prophet had changed to the
[1:11:05] headstone had come down and was now
[1:11:08] using the prophet to speak through the
[1:11:11] prophet and the spirit of god speaks
[1:11:13] through the prophet and in thinking they
[1:11:16] were rejecting william branham they
[1:11:18] rejected the headstone
[1:11:20] they rejected
[1:11:22] the headstone oh god have mercy and oh
[1:11:26] there is
[1:11:27] in an actual fact you know what they did
[1:11:30] they refused the very word they claimed
[1:11:33] to love serve and worship
[1:11:36] they refused it and it's that simple how
[1:11:39] things happen with the things of the
[1:11:41] living god
[1:11:42] and all that word was doing was
[1:11:44] revealing christ
[1:11:46] and they rejected
[1:11:48] jesus christ amen but the true believers
[1:11:52] started to feed on christ
[1:11:54] the true believers began to feed on the
[1:11:57] word of god for their day and for their
[1:12:01] age hallelujah glory to god amen now
[1:12:06] know this
[1:12:07] here brother sisters that the prophet
[1:12:10] revealed the seals brought the seals
[1:12:12] forth uh bro and they were broken and
[1:12:15] they were revealed praise the lord
[1:12:18] and then they were rejected
[1:12:20] and then when they were rejected that's
[1:12:22] how come we had the second crucifixion
[1:12:24] of jesus christ in the word form
[1:12:27] not in the flesh form but they rejected
[1:12:30] him again not up on golgotha's hill back
[1:12:33] there in in israel but from the pulpits
[1:12:38] they rejected him pierced him with that
[1:12:41] criticism pierced him with their talks
[1:12:45] pierced them with all their rejection of
[1:12:48] the word of god and they rejected the
[1:12:51] word of god for their day and crucified
[1:12:55] it and closed out their age to spiritual
[1:12:59] death
[1:13:01] because the plague of spiritual death is
[1:13:03] what fell on them
[1:13:05] and they begin to die right out and they
[1:13:08] believe that they are still flourishing
[1:13:11] by the thousands
[1:13:13] millions they're flourishing we are rich
[1:13:17] we are increased with goods we have big
[1:13:20] buildings we have big money we have big
[1:13:23] business operations and noise thou not
[1:13:27] you're spiritually naked
[1:13:30] miserable wretched blind
[1:13:32] and the misery of it you don't even know
[1:13:37] it
[1:13:38] you're so smart
[1:13:40] you don't think
[1:13:42] that you
[1:13:43] are miserable and that you're naked and
[1:13:46] that you're poor and when you see all
[1:13:48] this these things around you how can i
[1:13:50] be poor i got all this but this bible is
[1:13:53] saying god's diagnosis
[1:13:56] your diagnosis you're not even a doctor
[1:13:58] and we you got a diagnosis that you can
[1:14:01] i i don't need to get the
[1:14:04] the the shot i don't need to do this i i
[1:14:06] i have faith and i don't need nothing
[1:14:08] amen you you know but the fact is that's
[1:14:12] your diagnosis god's diagnosis you're
[1:14:14] wretched miserable naked blind
[1:14:18] and you don't
[1:14:20] even know it
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:24] and so the prophet closed out and all
[1:14:27] that age and start
[1:14:29] like john
[1:14:31] hallelujah preparing the way
[1:14:34] for the messenger
[1:14:36] for the new age
[1:14:38] like john prepared the way for jesus who
[1:14:40] saw about the
[1:14:42] message of the kingdom of god
[1:14:45] and he came the word come on the scene
[1:14:49] hallelujah we'll praise god so
[1:14:53] did brother branham introduce
[1:14:56] some new age
[1:14:58] they didn't understand
[1:15:01] that when he drew that that's what he
[1:15:03] was doing
[1:15:05] that's what he was doing
[1:15:07] he was introducing you can call it a new
[1:15:10] age but to me or you who believe you're
[1:15:13] elected and was in it from the big
[1:15:15] before the foundations uh
[1:15:18] there is the
[1:15:19] new age
[1:15:21] that actually brother branham was
[1:15:23] introducing us to appointing us to amen
[1:15:27] clearly that we may understand
[1:15:30] hallelujah amen
[1:15:33] now
[1:15:34] when we look back here and we see these
[1:15:37] seven church ages
[1:15:39] in between
[1:15:41] the seven church edges and
[1:15:43] uh the top or the cap
[1:15:46] there's a gap in there
[1:15:48] right
[1:15:50] and we have holy spirit but there's a
[1:15:52] gap in there
[1:15:54] that is telling you
[1:15:57] that the
[1:15:59] capstone
[1:16:01] the people of the capital
[1:16:04] the people that goes into that
[1:16:09] cap of the pyramid
[1:16:11] really are not
[1:16:13] of the church ages
[1:16:16] they are really not part of the church
[1:16:19] ages
[1:16:20] but there are different people
[1:16:23] that just passed through the church age
[1:16:26] like jesus passed through mary but yet
[1:16:29] they're really not from that church age
[1:16:32] but they were allowed to pass through it
[1:16:34] or the church age was used to bring them
[1:16:37] to manifestation
[1:16:39] and so god
[1:16:41] using this
[1:16:43] is showing us our own journey to bring
[1:16:45] us out of our spiritual amnesia of which
[1:16:48] we were in amen hallelujah amen so that
[1:16:53] gap is telling us
[1:16:55] that you are not really from the church
[1:16:57] ages
[1:16:59] physically
[1:17:01] your body is still located
[1:17:04] in the seventh church age
[1:17:07] physically but you the man the woman
[1:17:11] amen
[1:17:12] at the end of those seals
[1:17:15] by a revelation that has broken
[1:17:18] to that eternal church age
[1:17:20] you recognize that you are in two worlds
[1:17:24] you are physically in the time with your
[1:17:28] body
[1:17:29] but your soul
[1:17:30] being a part of god you're break back
[1:17:34] into eternity into another dimension
[1:17:36] with the living god
[1:17:38] hallelujah
[1:17:40] amen oh praise god brother sister i want
[1:17:44] to thank god
[1:17:46] for opening my eyes amen
[1:17:49] you know that the real
[1:17:52] pentecostal bride we're talking about
[1:17:54] pentecost now i come back talking about
[1:17:56] pentecost
[1:17:58] do you know the people of the real
[1:18:00] pentecost
[1:18:02] they're all dead already and they're
[1:18:04] sleeping
[1:18:06] they're already gone
[1:18:08] the ones we have among us now there may
[1:18:11] be seeds of god mixed in there and
[1:18:13] waiting to be called out i don't know
[1:18:15] but they are not the real genuine
[1:18:19] pentecostals
[1:18:21] that is satan's attempt of confusion and
[1:18:24] chaos
[1:18:26] that is the same kind of tongues that
[1:18:29] was in uh
[1:18:31] that nebuchadnezzar
[1:18:33] or belshazzu's feast
[1:18:35] that the writing on the wall
[1:18:37] these tongues and everything that we're
[1:18:38] hearing now that's what it is now it's
[1:18:41] sowing chaos and confusion
[1:18:44] and all kinds of stuff like that they're
[1:18:46] coming up with all kinds of outrageous
[1:18:48] things getting the baptist holy spirit
[1:18:50] with by laughing getting the baptism
[1:18:53] holy spirit by by crawling on the ground
[1:18:55] and all kinds of things of that nature
[1:18:58] all my brother sister and they've gone
[1:19:01] absolutely contrary to the word of god
[1:19:05] but the real elected among the
[1:19:07] pentecostals
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:10] they are asleep
[1:19:13] they are all dead now
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:16] so we got to look now
[1:19:18] where do we come in as i repeat again
[1:19:21] if you're not in those seven ages
[1:19:25] but you're here you know you're here so
[1:19:27] spiritually where are you located
[1:19:31] and i'm
[1:19:32] saying to you
[1:19:34] that you are a part of that capstone
[1:19:38] you're a part
[1:19:40] of the top of the pyramid
[1:19:43] but something or somebody has to take
[1:19:46] you across that chasm
[1:19:49] that chasm came between man and god
[1:19:52] sin brought it in
[1:19:54] and somebody or something has to take
[1:19:57] you back
[1:19:58] that is why brother branham church his
[1:20:00] book many other places tell you the very
[1:20:03] importance of revelation
[1:20:06] you cannot do without revelation
[1:20:09] because it's revelation is going to take
[1:20:12] your back
[1:20:13] because revelation is not by study it's
[1:20:16] not by mind it's not my intelligence
[1:20:19] it's not by man it's by the grace of
[1:20:22] almighty god
[1:20:24] hallelujah
[1:20:26] you can be a shepherd out in a field
[1:20:28] can't even spell your name and out of
[1:20:30] nowhere all of a sudden bang a thought
[1:20:32] hits you
[1:20:34] god begins to reveal
[1:20:36] and that man by the name of amos just
[1:20:38] come out from among them cows and all
[1:20:41] kinds of stuff and stomp down to that
[1:20:43] city in the way of a true prophet and
[1:20:45] begin to prophesy the word of god
[1:20:48] hallelujah god doesn't need your
[1:20:51] wisdom god doesn't need your
[1:20:53] intelligence
[1:20:54] god just needs you to be a yielded
[1:20:57] vessel
[1:20:59] so that he could speak out his
[1:21:00] intelligence
[1:21:02] his wisdom his knowledge and display his
[1:21:06] power
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:08] that's what god is calling us to be
[1:21:11] surrendered vessels are you willing to
[1:21:13] be a surrendered vessel
[1:21:15] are you willing to humble yourself
[1:21:18] and say lord use me lord use me o god
[1:21:23] hallelujah
[1:21:25] oh the devil come to your mind but how
[1:21:27] god will use you you did this you did
[1:21:28] that you said that that's why he said
[1:21:30] don't you forget you're justified
[1:21:34] this outside man may continue even
[1:21:36] carrying on doing all kinds of stuff but
[1:21:38] inside here you're justified
[1:21:42] and just if i don't mean that you just
[1:21:44] get pardoned because if you pardon then
[1:21:46] you mean you did it but then if you
[1:21:49] say oh this no you are justified
[1:21:54] because the devil because he had
[1:21:56] something to do with this
[1:21:58] he start to manipulate it
[1:22:00] and then by the manipulations of this
[1:22:03] and all the things that did he start to
[1:22:05] condemn the man on the inside
[1:22:08] but that man on the inside never did not
[1:22:12] want thing wrong for the seed of god
[1:22:16] cannot commit sin it can't
[1:22:20] because it's the gene of god it's a part
[1:22:23] of god brother branham said it can't die
[1:22:26] no more god than god himself can die
[1:22:29] because it's a part of him
[1:22:32] revealed
[1:22:33] on the earth
[1:22:35] and they give you the earthly name your
[1:22:37] name my name they give it an earthly
[1:22:40] name just like they give jesus a earthly
[1:22:42] name that was just his earthly name but
[1:22:45] god had the name the real name is
[1:22:47] written on the book hallelujah
[1:22:50] amen your name is on the book hallelujah
[1:22:54] you say oh you know it your life is
[1:22:56] going to show it
[1:22:58] your life is going to display it
[1:23:00] and the things that are going to happen
[1:23:02] around you in you and through you even
[1:23:05] without your personally trying to work
[1:23:08] up anything
[1:23:09] it's just going to happen god is going
[1:23:12] to testify of his
[1:23:15] own gift that he placed inside you
[1:23:20] oh i'm going to go fast but 40 days to
[1:23:23] stir up this gift that's in me well
[1:23:26] that's good if god tell you to brother
[1:23:28] brown said i never prayed or fasted more
[1:23:30] than three days in my life
[1:23:32] amen why because you only do those if
[1:23:35] god tell you to do it
[1:23:37] is that right
[1:23:39] some weeks i i come up here i already
[1:23:42] ate my good solid breakfast and enjoy it
[1:23:45] praise god and another week god says no
[1:23:48] don't eat anything
[1:23:50] you deliver that word and then you come
[1:23:52] back and then you can go
[1:23:54] you see that's the way you don't just
[1:23:57] make up these things you allow god to
[1:23:59] have his way
[1:24:00] surrender to him
[1:24:02] unto him alone blessed be the name of
[1:24:05] the living god glory to god so what is
[1:24:08] your position
[1:24:10] amen hallelujah he's revealed himself to
[1:24:13] the church ages
[1:24:15] but now he's really not in the edges
[1:24:19] hallelujah
[1:24:21] he is now in the capstone
[1:24:23] praise god hallelujah
[1:24:26] amen
[1:24:27] if you got your bible or you can show
[1:24:29] them the quotation of zechariah 4
[1:24:33] verses 6 to 7
[1:24:36] hallelujah
[1:24:38] that tells us there about the head stone
[1:24:42] coming back crying grace grace grace how
[1:24:46] many remembers that beautiful scripture
[1:24:49] of zechariah 4 6 and 7. no of course it
[1:24:54] can't be a rock
[1:24:56] it can't be a
[1:24:57] a brick or a stone like we know it
[1:25:00] because the thing is speaking
[1:25:02] this is a headstone that's talking and
[1:25:05] it's crying up and saying grace
[1:25:08] grace grace hallelujah so the headstone
[1:25:13] got to be a person
[1:25:15] it's got to be a person that's talking
[1:25:17] to us
[1:25:18] glory to god hallelujah amen so the
[1:25:22] capstone
[1:25:23] is going to bring you a great revelation
[1:25:27] where you're going to realize this thing
[1:25:29] is not of works where any of us could
[1:25:32] boast but it's by the grace of almighty
[1:25:35] god that we are here this morning in the
[1:25:39] house of the living god not by our
[1:25:41] righteousness not by our works not by
[1:25:44] our wisdom not by our knowledge but by
[1:25:48] his grace alone that we are here
[1:25:54] oh my
[1:25:56] oh oh can i both oh i went to
[1:25:58] northwestern bible college oh yeah can i
[1:26:01] both oh i was in this bible school i was
[1:26:05] over here i got a doctor's divinity and
[1:26:07] people are necessarily given credibility
[1:26:11] to people
[1:26:12] based on their wealth
[1:26:15] based on their
[1:26:17] intelligence
[1:26:18] their mental acuity
[1:26:21] agility
[1:26:24] believers
[1:26:26] so-called
[1:26:27] are given credibility to people like
[1:26:29] this oh god blessing that brother he
[1:26:32] looks like he's really rich the hand of
[1:26:35] god is on that don't mean nothing
[1:26:39] god can use that to blind your eyes that
[1:26:42] you don't see the word
[1:26:44] amen you pass the beggar at the gate and
[1:26:48] the beggar might be the one with the
[1:26:49] word and the banker can be blind as a
[1:26:52] bat
[1:26:53] so you keep your eyes upon the lord
[1:26:57] jesus amen
[1:26:59] so the pentecostal the the capstone then
[1:27:04] we find out is a person
[1:27:07] did you get that
[1:27:09] the capstone crying grace is a person
[1:27:14] hallelujah
[1:27:15] the
[1:27:16] capstone is the present-day word of this
[1:27:20] hour
[1:27:21] because it's the fullness of the word
[1:27:24] that come through all the seven church
[1:27:26] ages
[1:27:27] and now it's come to its fullness at the
[1:27:29] confirmation of the ages is that right
[1:27:33] come to its fullness
[1:27:34] so it caps off everything all of them
[1:27:37] said way back there this caps all of it
[1:27:39] this is the capstone the present our
[1:27:42] word that we now
[1:27:45] and also
[1:27:47] the capstone also represents a people
[1:27:53] as every church age represented
[1:27:56] a certain
[1:27:57] elect people for that age
[1:28:00] that capstone represents a people now
[1:28:05] everything i'm saying here i welcome you
[1:28:07] to challenge it and search it in the
[1:28:09] bible in the message in the prophet and
[1:28:12] what he said right because i'm not here
[1:28:15] to give you uh proof to you anything
[1:28:19] those days of proving to you anything
[1:28:22] i remember those days when uh us
[1:28:25] preachers have to walk up to the
[1:28:26] platform some with a suitcase filled
[1:28:29] with books
[1:28:31] and you challenge them when they open
[1:28:32] that suitcase
[1:28:34] and then they'll pull out books over
[1:28:36] there and where they are you don't have
[1:28:38] to prove nothing
[1:28:40] i don't have to prove anything to you
[1:28:42] because if the holy spirit doesn't prove
[1:28:43] it to you and reveal it to you
[1:28:46] my my trying to do that is in vain
[1:28:49] and even if i did it
[1:28:51] it still wouldn't bring you in because
[1:28:54] he is the one who said i open the door
[1:28:58] and when i open the door to you
[1:29:02] no people can tell you oh you two wicked
[1:29:04] you can't come in you do this you can't
[1:29:06] pass him he opened the door
[1:29:08] he he opens he said when i opened the
[1:29:11] door
[1:29:12] hallelujah but when i shut it
[1:29:15] when i shut up your understanding
[1:29:18] when i blind your eyes
[1:29:20] there is no way you can't come in here
[1:29:23] amen or praise god forevermore
[1:29:26] hallelujah thank god when he knocked on
[1:29:28] my heart's door oh my god brother sister
[1:29:32] i was ready to follow him every step of
[1:29:35] the way amen
[1:29:37] glory to god i tell you in the name of
[1:29:40] the lord jesus christ hell man
[1:29:43] when i was just in my teenage and the
[1:29:45] message just came myself and then
[1:29:48] brothers talking about the lord out of
[1:29:50] them bushes come that great pillar of
[1:29:53] fire like that moving slowly
[1:29:56] and my uh uh people that just passed
[1:29:59] away were living just like where the
[1:30:02] house is and just run to them and say do
[1:30:04] you see anything oh my god what is that
[1:30:07] and just when it realized that they
[1:30:09] could see it it just moved from a
[1:30:11] standstill to hume
[1:30:14] into the heavens and was lost from sight
[1:30:18] i'm telling you brother sister he is the
[1:30:20] same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:24] and don't even think i'm mentioning that
[1:30:26] to put myself anywhere
[1:30:29] you see the pillar of fire so what the
[1:30:31] pillar of fire has been seen in jamaica
[1:30:34] many times
[1:30:36] brothers preaching their brother branham
[1:30:38] himself was alive then it was right over
[1:30:40] the over the uh
[1:30:42] woolen sack recorder while they're
[1:30:43] playing
[1:30:44] brother brady is preaching
[1:30:46] in his own daddy is doubting him while
[1:30:49] the daddy is doubting here comes the
[1:30:51] purifier
[1:30:52] behind him he don't know it's there it's
[1:30:54] passing the father runs up with his
[1:30:56] jacket to go block it and it just went
[1:31:00] and got even bigger of course he falled
[1:31:02] up and he had to lead him to christ but
[1:31:04] the fact is
[1:31:06] this we don't take those things like
[1:31:08] pentecostal do they get one healing
[1:31:11] and they print up a book and a magazine
[1:31:13] and they start a big ministry
[1:31:16] is that right
[1:31:17] one man cast out the devil in the
[1:31:19] philippines and he got a multi-million
[1:31:22] dollar ministry from but from constantly
[1:31:25] retelling the story of these demons that
[1:31:27] he cast out
[1:31:28] all my endless brothers in africa
[1:31:32] casting out devils every day
[1:31:35] it's commonplace to cast not devils
[1:31:37] every day i was teenaged and devils were
[1:31:39] being cast out every day
[1:31:41] it wasn't strange or different and
[1:31:44] everything else like that
[1:31:46] you see what i am trying to tell you
[1:31:49] here
[1:31:50] and maybe i'll touch on it later or
[1:31:53] where brother branham takes when the
[1:31:54] messenger is gone he says that take the
[1:31:57] message and they scruple it up
[1:32:00] and then take it into denomination
[1:32:03] amen
[1:32:05] they start to make money off of it
[1:32:08] use the message to make money
[1:32:11] to make uh build a personality build
[1:32:14] their private credibility to build
[1:32:17] themselves up instead of pointing people
[1:32:21] back to christ back to the narrow way i
[1:32:24] am nothing you are nothing none of us
[1:32:26] are anything we are resting on him and
[1:32:29] upon him alone
[1:32:31] glory to god i haven't even gotten to
[1:32:34] really touch on my gotten to my topic
[1:32:36] yet amen but i wanted you to know
[1:32:39] brother sister
[1:32:41] here
[1:32:42] listen
[1:32:43] oh my
[1:32:45] at the end
[1:32:47] page 128 of the seven seals at the end
[1:32:50] of the pentecostal church age
[1:32:54] we are supposed
[1:32:55] to receive according to the word as god
[1:32:59] has said
[1:33:00] our messenger which is brother branham
[1:33:03] to re that will take all those loose
[1:33:06] ends
[1:33:08] and reveal the whole secret of god
[1:33:12] for the rapturing of the church
[1:33:16] then
[1:33:18] brother branham uses that word then
[1:33:21] well you know
[1:33:22] the word then means just like when john
[1:33:25] said and after this
[1:33:27] because when you finish revelation 1 2 3
[1:33:30] you go to revelation 4 it begins by john
[1:33:33] saying
[1:33:35] and after this
[1:33:37] right that is just as much as if he said
[1:33:40] then
[1:33:40] right this is what brother branham is
[1:33:42] saying here
[1:33:44] then
[1:33:46] amen
[1:33:47] hallelujah
[1:33:49] then
[1:33:50] there is coming fourth
[1:33:53] seven mysterious thunders
[1:33:57] hallelujah praise god let me tell you
[1:34:00] the whole secret
[1:34:02] the seven chart changes
[1:34:04] over the messenger comes at the end then
[1:34:09] seven mysterious thunders
[1:34:12] hallelujah praise god they might have
[1:34:15] heard the sound even during the church
[1:34:17] age but they understand what it was
[1:34:19] saying
[1:34:20] amen oh my
[1:34:23] then there is coming forth seven
[1:34:26] mysterious thunders
[1:34:28] that
[1:34:29] are
[1:34:30] not
[1:34:31] even written
[1:34:33] at all
[1:34:35] they're not even written at all
[1:34:37] now you're talking about people
[1:34:40] launching out in the deep
[1:34:42] because you got the written word
[1:34:44] and you can say like thomas except i see
[1:34:47] it in that bible
[1:34:49] my god except i could put my finger in
[1:34:51] the side
[1:34:52] i'm believing that
[1:34:55] unless i can see a direct quote from the
[1:34:57] prophet all right i'm believing that
[1:35:00] whatsoever we got a lot of thomases here
[1:35:03] today like that i don't mean here in the
[1:35:04] building but we i mean that in this age
[1:35:08] we got a lot of thomases like that even
[1:35:11] written in the bible i am not going to
[1:35:14] believe it amen especially that he says
[1:35:17] the bible itself tells you john don't
[1:35:19] write that
[1:35:21] when the seven thunders
[1:35:23] spoke
[1:35:24] or uttered their voice
[1:35:26] amen he says john don't write that
[1:35:30] because that part of the word is the
[1:35:33] unwritten word that is not to be studied
[1:35:36] and not to be
[1:35:38] an alliance debated
[1:35:40] that is to be revealed
[1:35:43] the only way you can get that
[1:35:46] is for it to be revealed so he said john
[1:35:51] don't write that whatsoever amen
[1:35:54] hallelujah i want to give you another
[1:35:58] quote here
[1:36:00] now think of it
[1:36:04] the second climax i talked about the
[1:36:07] other day
[1:36:08] is something coming forth now for the
[1:36:11] church
[1:36:12] what is it i don't know
[1:36:14] oh my
[1:36:16] i could stay on a bit but
[1:36:19] it will move on from me in other words
[1:36:21] if he doesn't deal with it right then
[1:36:23] the thought is going to just travel away
[1:36:25] so he said could it be that that is the
[1:36:28] mighty thunder
[1:36:31] oh my think of it
[1:36:33] the seventh angel caught up in a seventh
[1:36:37] constellation
[1:36:39] seventh period
[1:36:41] constellation
[1:36:43] the pyramid
[1:36:45] made in the form on the side and on top
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:51] and it dropped down from eternity
[1:36:55] could that be the mystery
[1:36:57] of the seven thunders
[1:36:59] that will bring back the headstone to
[1:37:02] earth again
[1:37:04] oh
[1:37:04] my you know that pyramid was never
[1:37:09] capped
[1:37:10] and the headstone is yet to come
[1:37:14] the headstone has been rejected i told
[1:37:17] you what the headstone was and how the
[1:37:19] pentecostal rejected it not knowing they
[1:37:21] rejected it amen could it be
[1:37:25] my brothers that is in sirs is this the
[1:37:27] time page 46
[1:37:30] to 48. you heard the tape
[1:37:33] the seven thunders
[1:37:35] amen
[1:37:37] hallelujah
[1:37:38] that is what time is it sir
[1:37:42] now he's referring back to that but
[1:37:44] that's when he's speaking in the seven
[1:37:45] seals on god hiding in simplicity
[1:37:50] amen and he said that tape on the seven
[1:37:53] thunders
[1:37:55] what time is it sir
[1:37:57] it happened the other day
[1:37:59] the time is at hand that time
[1:38:03] is at hand or church don't you wait any
[1:38:07] longer how do you know the rapture is
[1:38:10] not going on
[1:38:12] all the time
[1:38:15] how do you know it's not going on all
[1:38:19] the time
[1:38:22] first thing you know
[1:38:24] it will be passed
[1:38:26] one disappearing here there it'll be
[1:38:29] gone the first you know and then the
[1:38:33] judgment will strike the world oh
[1:38:37] my think of it think of it down in
[1:38:40] arizona maricopa valley a city called
[1:38:44] phoenix something breaks out there until
[1:38:47] the seventh thunders of revelation 10
[1:38:50] not even wrote in the bible is being
[1:38:54] made
[1:38:55] manifested amen
