here on the word of God the Lord will let you see what you did and he appreciate it so much so God bless you we go straight to the word I will not delay each and every one of you tonight uh we're going to go first John okay first John chapter 37 we'll read first John chapter 3: 7 then we read chapter 5 uh chapter 5:4 then we read chapter 5 13 then we drop to 19 that will be my scripture first John chapter 3 verse 7 let us bow our head and pray gracious Eternal Father Lord Jesus the creator of Heaven and Earth Lord without you I am nothing you know that father I am not a good speaker if you don't come father it will be a disaster but I have confidence in you that Lord my your my brothers my sisters are standing here in your presence they are your children even your servant is standing here Pastor Danny Lord God Mighty may your spirit draw nigh people are watching in line father Believers Sinners oh God may your spirit take me aside take my lips and anoint the word anoint the hearers and Lord speak your word into their hearts in Jesus Christ's name amen amen okay first John 37 the word goes little children let no man deceive you he that does righteous is righteous even as he is righteous to verse let's continue to eight he that commits sin is of the devil for the devil Sin from the beginning for this purpose the sons of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil that's first scripture chapter 5 verse 4 for whato for who whatsoever is born of God overcome the world and this is the victory that overcome the world even our our Fai drop to 13 the same uh uh scripture 13 this thing have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that he may that ye may know that ye have eternal life that and that ye may believe on the name of the son of God okay the the last one is 19 and we know that we are of God and the whole well lay in darkness and we know that the sons of God the Son of God is come and had given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even this even in his son son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life little children keep yourself from Idols amen may the Lord had his Blessing please be seated when you see natural tree seed everything that that tree going to be all the fruit that tree going to be is already in that seed not because you put it in the ground then when it grow then then the seed that is coming because you you you you bury then that seed comes inside no the seed that little seed that you have everything that seed going to be is already in that seed God sent you here you came from him every faith everything that you going to be in God is already in you hallelujah it's already in you before you came here because remember you are part of God the true wife of Christ is part of God and you were in spirit form before you were put into flesh so when you were in spirit form you were part of God and now that God has sent you here as Humanity everything where you whatever you going to be is already in you that's why the devil can never defeated you he cannot completely defeated you if you are a true bride of Christ because God took himself broke himself and that part that he broke is you and me and all the wife of Christ that will be in this last age we come in stages but remember we in the last hour right so no matter what Satan is doing have confidence in yourself that God that who has sent you here won't disappoint you he will not disappoint you amen because the work is already done because his Spirit you are born of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit if you are the bride so how can Satan defeat you if you recognize who you are there's nothing that will shake you then when the enemy even sees you he is running for cover because why let's say you think King Charles is afraid of somebody in the world because he know his King Char what no matter where you place him in this world he know who he is and he speak with authority the bride must speak with authority we must speak with power because the power lay in you recognize at this hour we are not in the hour whereby you should be afraid you should allow the devil to push you around no stand on the post of Duty when you place a soldier in in in a duty and the soldier know who he is there is nothing that going to move him nothing can move him no enemy nobody can shake him up because he know he's placed there for a purpose you are placed here for a purpose you are part of the God who created this everything your eye could see the things your eye couldn't even see he is the one that created it so why should we be afraid why should we be allowed Satan who is created to sometime push us around if we have God in us then we should have confidence in him that all things are possible with him all things not half all all a a l all things are possible if we don't recognize that then the enemy will always attack us he will attack you he will attack your children he will attack your family you will attack your even attack your boss to to prosecute you because you don't know who you are but if you know who you are and you stand on the post of Duty the enemy can never in life move you because you have confidence in God Amen no sickness no disease no poverty no pain no anything can move you you you are able to do what Shake It Off give it back to Satan because is not yours those things are not yours yours is the part that come from God and God there when he was here Jesus Christ nothing could defeat him when Satan touch him he says it's written it's written it's written what does he do he take him back to the word and you are part of the that word now is your time take him back to the word and always he will free from you he will go away from you if you allowed him he will bombard you he will attack you you you you'll be riched you can be lost if you are true bride you can't be lost your position in Christ cannot change but he can make you miserable but if you recognize that hey I know who I am I'm standing on my post of Duty then you sometime you go places you see the enemy you can see him even try to use people to against you then in your heart you say oh Lord forgive them they don't know what they doing they don't know it's not that man it's not that woman it's not that child it's the devil because he have seen that God's spirit dwell in you so he want to make your life riched you want to make your life miserable but let me tell you you just stand there and says Lord forgive them they don't know what they doing and you watch that moment few second you see that the whole thing change the whole thing will change the whole atmosphere will change because God live in you don't fear if you God by his grace have let you recognize the seals that has opened has let you recognize the message of the hour that is coming forth through the prophet message that is revealing at this moment it shows you are part of God have confidence on that and believe that and says even if you get sick even if anything that is happened to you you are willing to stand on the post of Duty because God won't forsake you God will never you go you pick this Bible and show me one person in the Bible God has forsaken which human being that have served God from the bottom of his heart in history up to now that God has forsaken them there's no such a thing my brother if you you can show me one I'll deny the Bible and go and follow you but there's nobody that tell us that the Lord Jesus Christ is the one true God he's the one true healer amen and his name every knee will bow every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord amen whether they like it or not whether the whole world like it or not they're going to Bow listen brother Abraham prophesied to us God in him says Los Angeles will come under the sea the whole California will come under the sea Now You See Fire is started to burn before Sodom and goor was about to be burned right fire came down and start burning the whole place right people were living there 50 years they says we don't want to move some of them what happened fire has burned them listen to the news but some of them they running because why even though this is what I'm seeing God is giving some of them Grace to run for their life but human beings they are so stubble they'll go right back in but even if they know there not my time future woman being wanted to always put those things in future my brother my sister whether we like it or not on the prophet says does say the Lord Los Angeles California go under the sea I believe it I believe it I believe from the bottom of my heart it's coming it's coming it's coming none of them can stop it nobody can stop it it's coming it may look like it's ter but it's coming because the prophet William Braham prophesied it God in him it was not him it was the Lord speaking through his servant he w't let his servants W fall to the ground and let me tell you even every five4 Ministry when they are preaching God will not let their words fall into the ground people don't know it's not men that choose to stand to preach by themselves if you are not chosen then you God will let your your words fall to the ground like that but if you are chosen by God God to be a pastor to be a evangelist to be a teacher to be a prophet I mean manual Prophet to be I forgot the other one it will come the 54 Ministry if you were chosen to stand in the Pulpit regardless how you think the person may not able to preach the way you want let me tell you if God has chosen be careful what you speak against him because you don't know what they go through you have no idea like our pastor you have no idea what what he goes through even we the little ones you have no idea what we go through sometime you go to bed you cannot even sleep because God dance with our heart he takes our heart and he's moving us the way he want the word to come out he move him the way he want the word to come out to us and so is you hearing the word even sitting in the bench you go out you open your mouth to somebody on the word and they speak speak against you they are not speaking against you do you know who they are speaking against is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and God will deal with them that's why he says my word will never return unto me void it will accomplish what I have spoken this is do say the Lord this is not a man this is the reality people don't know how God does things God way he says my ways are not your ways my thought are not your thought because his ways is not the way we humans think and when he call you he don't call you to to fish out and use your human sense to figure him you cannot you can figure God God have so many ways that even we don't know yet he is the one that reveal if he don't reveal we have nothing to say Amen but by Grace he give it to us not because we Are Holy not because we do good not because we know too much this is this gospel is not by education as desmon was saying so many people think it's by education it's not it's God that calls God that choose sometime the people he choose them my God just imagine you are living in the day of John the Baptist he comes to the pulpit that man all he know is Lay as to the root all his teeth when he's talking is man he's think he don't know ABCD but he's talking about the gospel you're going to speak against him you're going to talk against him oh this man is this that man is this that no God chose when he chose he chose we woman being we don't understand things we want to figure God to do things no God need our heart all he requests let me tell you if we can give us his heart nothing he cannot do nothing miracles signs wonders he can perform it easy for us to see if we obey him God need a heart not headache not head knowledge what are you going to give it to God what I'm going to give it to God nothing my heart my heart only Lord take my heart and possess it because the sons of God no matter what Satan is doing he can never defeat us because you know why the seed of God lay in our heart and that seed every seed must bring forth his kind sir God will let that seed come forth just like a woman who is pregnant when the baby is about to come out that Spirit whether you like it or not any body can say whatever they want can they say oh we pushing the child we won't let this child come no it's nature we call it nature it going to come forth so is you and me because we are seed of God when the time reach for God sometime even you you try to run you try to go your way but it won't work because God will hunt you God will bring you if you have to drag you he will drag you if you you have to break your leg he will break it chop off your hand he will chop it off because he want his son to come to his presence and worship him he deserve your Praises he inhabit your Praises it's you that make him happy do you know when the bride is sad God is sad do you know when you become sad God look at you he says my God I created you for my pleasure I created you to worship me I created you to give me glory and honor and now look at my son look at my daughter no God want you as our pastor was saying always happy DY for God rejoice when he see you happy some people they come to church they can't even shout brother as you preach they can even shout one shout what kind of person are you what kind of people are you come on shout give God the glory if he have given you the eternal life give him the glory my God people want to see leg move H hand move while they are sick and they can't give God a glory do you know that's why when you look at this church I'm talking even all over the world but let me use our church which doctor can come and sit here which lawyer is sitting here which PhD person is sitting here even if they come there are not many they are not many because they going to wear their glasses the way even I'm preaching and look like this no everything they want to analiz it but God want you to be like a fool in the people eye God will get the glory for that God will honor his word for that people will prosecute you so this person is dummy this person don't know nothing this is a a dummy person he shout too much he cry too much don't worry about that let me tell you when you are sick even though sickness has got hold of you give God the praise you come to church give him the praise yesterday I was sitting in front of the doctor and the doctor I was thinking my God tomorrow I'm going to preach I'm so sick what I'm going to do I started in my mind I said Lord yes he's showing me the medicine I should drink but you know what sickness or no sickness you are my healer you are my healer you are my healer you are my healer you are my healer and my brothers my sister I am not saying this for joke or fun is reality to me amen today tonight you see me standing here that's the way we supposed to be we supposed to give God the praise for everything even if the enemy is throwing you in the grave while you are going the grave still give God the praise brother give God the praise why you are going down why do you think Lazarus was raised when Lazarus was going in the grave I believe he was giving the Lord a praise so the spirit of the Lord went into the grave with him and he cannot stay there cuz the Bible says absent from this body present with the Lord the Lord can't let him stay in the grave after 4 days he have to bring him up what do you think you remember one of the Prophet I think he was elishah right when the Israelites went to war and they were kill one of the prophet and the Phil I think Philistines were killing them of soul and they realized they throw one is Ally on that grave that body came back to life what do you think was laying in that grave life Christ life was in that grave so every time they they they they they tried to kill the Israelites they when they saw it they pick the body they throw in that grave and that body became what light when you come to the presence of the Lord whether you are weak even if you have backslide even if you are sick even if you don't like to praise him let me tell you there is life in in in Christ so once you are here give him praise Hallelujah Give Him Glory Hallelujah you will see the Life coming back to you you see how you will become light you will see yourself life will come back Joy will come back happiness will come back everything you need will come back to you what do you think Hallelujah Israelites realize that that there is life in that grave there is life in his presence what do you think you think it's brother kof I have sense to speak oh you don't know me yes I can talk naturally I'm a talkative brother small will tell you but when it comes to gospel no I don't have no brain I don't have it but I trust the God who has chose me to bring the word and I'll bring it my way not anybody way because my way that's the way the Lord designed me that is the way I'm going to be whether you like it or not not a man chose me and I'm not going nowhere this church I am one of the pillar here I'm not lying to you God made me a pillar you can't move me you move me God will tell you hey I place him there because I know he knows me he know the way I am even I myself I try to run many times because I cannot do it but he says don't worry you going to do it whether you like it or not it's me you can never run from my presence you can never go away I try to go away I see it I try to go away flips itting I'm not lying to you all brothers and sister I am God has made me a pillar a pillar for his house that's the way he ordained it and that's the way going to be I can't help it but the seed is coming forth the seed is coming forth your seed is going to come forth whether you like it or not the the the the the spirit of God is breathing on you the spirit of God is breathing on me I have to come forth you have to come forth so that in all God will get the glory god because the children of God we does not sin because why the spirit of God in us God doesn't look at your flesh don't worry your flesh will make so many mistakes when you look sometime even the Bible you don't want to read am I telling the truth or lie come on I'm not telling you the truth don't be too

doesn't give it to him he cannot preach if the Lord doesn't give it to our pastor he have nothing to say if you don't give me or desm or Philip or Christopher or Timar you think that we have something to say because they are good or because they are smart no it's not smartness it's all about Jesus it's all about the Lord listen you you you read you're looking for what God want you to speak sometime you come in here it's not easy to come and stand here when you come here when I get here my mind is pure my heart is pure and I say Lord I'm in your hands say what you wanted to say to your children because I cannot do it you don't come is a disaster but all I know he tell me he let me know said Kofi I am in you I am the one doing it I am the one using you have confidence in yourself sometime even you rebuke me why are you even doubting you in yourself you you worry so much I can't I can't I can't you can't you can't I said you can do it amen I am God you can do it prise God don't worry about yourself and look at yourself that you are nothing you think I look at that I look at my word that I place in you you going to do it so when I come here there's no kof inside when I'm preaching K is not inside it's all about him it's all about the Lord It's all about him even if I make one mistake I'm so worried about it because I want cof to be out so that the Lord does it the glory goes to him let us love one another what what I'm trying to say tonight is God is in you recognize it strongly and recognize that God in you will defeat Satan God in you no matter who you how you think how you feel how you think oh I'm weak I'm this I'm down don't worry God will do it he didn't choose you today just not because you came here then he has chose you no you were chosen before the foundations of this world sir but he allowed you to become here to hear his voice so that you will recognize him even when why you were your mother womb you were chosen why you were even Spirit you were chosen you were in him you remember when he spoke to Moses in the burning bush I am that I am that pill of fire you were part of that pill of fire now you've been put into flesh so recognize who you are when you recognize that God get the glory amen and sadness will never hit your heart whether you have money whether sickness whether poverty whether H your children go away from you whether you are food on the table you still want to give him all the praise and I know am I with sister God bless you Sister Rosemary God bless you you have stood for the Lord for the family you see it was a time the family looked like they were not coming now look the sister stood his husband come back brother has come back is our brother he can't go nowhere the spirit of God is in him amen he can't go nowhere cuz his wife was praying for him day and night and God has granted her hard desire he stood faithful faithful when you stand faithful God will vindicate you don't let us be shaky when times of trouble stand the Lord will stand by you amen times of goodness stand the Lord will stand by you it's not easy pray for the pastor he's the one that goes through more than any one of us once he stand he may not talk not that he has talked with me or desmon or Philip or anybody but a pastor go through more than anybody but God has buil them in such a way that they stand the true Pastor I'm not talking about there are men that place themselves as pastors which God hasn't chose them but when God chosen Pastor they go through a lot when I saw when Pastor Simon I walk with him I've gone to Africa four times with him my country and I see things the way pastors go through I say oh God this place is will be my last end I don't want to be in the ppit I just want to be a cleaner and that's
