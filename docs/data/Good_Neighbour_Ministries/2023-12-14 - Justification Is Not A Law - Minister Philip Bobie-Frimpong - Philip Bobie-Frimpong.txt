your word mightily move in our midst oh God we pray in Jesus name amen amen we will enjoy the service last Sunday God okay so um without wasting much time I go to my scripture I have like three scriptures but I'm going back and forth fourth um okay is first scripture is Romans 7 1-6 and then Galatians 21621 Psalms 10312 said know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the Lord had OB over a man as long as he liveth question mark for the woman which had an husband is BN by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loose from the law of a husband um over here we are not legalistic we're not talking about marriage and divorce it's just that we're talking about the law and Grace and we know that some people got deceived into a marriage and other Factor say with some people stand on the way but that's not our main purpose it's mostly on Grace and uh thing so then if while husband leaveth she be married to another man she shall be called daughters but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she's not she's no adulterous though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also have become dead that's the main thing to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter um Galatians 21621 okay Galatians 2:21 knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ that ye we might be justified by the Faith of Christ and not by The Works of law for by The Works of law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves also are found Sinners is therefore Christ the minister of sin God forbid for if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor for I through the law am theread to the law that I might live unto God I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ death is in vain and Psalm 103 verse2 said as far as the East is from the West so far has he removed our transgressions from us heavenly father bless the reading of the word we commit the rest into your hand I pray that you close my lips from saying anything that you don't not want me to say but help me to say only thing that you desire me to say to bless and encourage and bless your children in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen please be seated so as we read about it there's a story that someone like Dwight Moody when he read about Romans chapter 7 he got so excited that when he went out the first man he met he asked him that do you know the grace of you know do you know Grace and the person that Grace what he said the grace of godallah Amen so it's more pertain to the grace of God is the law because most of the time people tend to stay with the law but when God giving them Grace they don't want to even get away from the law so God has given us Grace and as he Illustrated your first husband Eve H husband because we were born all from Eve because of what happen in the Garden of Eden we are being attached to this natural flesh but it's to say that when Christ comes into you when you receive the true birth then that that first husband is anal that first marriage is anal because a new creation you marri to Christ the second Adam who is the new what the new husband so all old things are passed away amen that's what the SC so we are married to Christ the word of God in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh and the Word was dwelt Among Us so that's what we are married to Christ that's what the bride of Christ is married to not to the first um husband because that first husband that nature is all in everyone that nature you want to is still um adultery all kind of stuff you fill with that first thing but when Christ comes into you what it you are delivered from all those like the woman at the world she was all her time was a prostitute but when Christ the word came to her we never see her going back to that prostitution that was what analment from her first husband so that's what we are trying to focus on deliverance from your first birth to your new birth and as is saying because God predestinated us it all comes about what it's a predestination because he said why it was put in there by predestination you were forain to be a Son of God you were in God before the foundations of the world invisible of the Christ paragraph 241 you were in God before the foundation of the world you were only manifested in the day of for his honor and Glory how can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God yes sir which you are part of the word by predestination because look the God is the word you believe it well then if he always was the word in the beginning was the word and if the Word was God then you were in God Hallelujah the word the part that you were to play was in God before the foundations of this world he seen you he knew predestinated you to it so because of that seed God J in you but because of your first birth it becomes like sometimes mother or whatever it is it's like M Satan can put all kind of M around it but one day like the eagle story when he heard that voice of God he won't go back to that he recognized who he is so when he recognized who he who he is everything changed there's a me a Son of God I'm not going to live in this kind of life he moved from it so what I'm trying to say is that from all the beginning God is was given what Grace Grace Grace but Adam when the fall came they wanted to have something into it that's a religious he he he put a thck leaf around himself that's was a religion so a lot of people are hiding behind religion doing all kind of stuff but God said your religion that fig religion will not be accepted so he he killed the blood and that blood was even slain before the foundation of the world but he killed the blood and gave it to Adam to cover his nakedness but but because they when that happened they use the human blood the animal blood as sacrificial H sacrifice to what for atonement of their sin but that blood because it's less than human blood it didn't have the power to anal the sin so when they go back that desire was always there they go and cry to God and that desire is still there it doesn't leave them but when Christ came he made one sacrifice one sacrifice and that are not all sin and not all our first husband we have no part to deal with that anymore we are new creature in Christ and we have been delivered we have been Justified if we haven't even done it in the first place because it's not you that do the bad thing it's not you that did all those mistakes it's the devil the flesh that hasper that but the gene that seed that came from God that is sinless blameless there's no spot in it it's part of God it's attribute of God and that part cannot sin because it's God himself hiding behind the the the Sons and Daughters of God Amen praise God so God he realized that Adam could not keep the law so when he made a New Covenant with Abraham that Covenant was what not Abraham do this or do that if you do not do this because in the first commandment said that if you do not partake of if you partake of this you die but when he came to Abraham God sworn by himself it was unconditional Covenant he said I have sworn back himself and there's no one greater than God he is greater than everybody so he swor by himself by myself I will deliver you I will do this it was I will give you a son a unconditional promise that promise is for every true seed of Royal Seed of Abraham even now our covenant with God is Not By Law do this or do that or do that because one thing is human being that we always always want to have our hand to do something it's too hard for human being just let it go and let God take control we want to have a path to deal with it because if you read the Bible said that by Grace Moses by Grace Noah by Grace Al God gave Moses found Grace in the sight of God but the children of Israel following Moses they want something to do so God gave them the law and they couldn't keep the law and so they want to keep the law and when the Lord Jesus Christ was here he being the God himself in flesh talking to them they also wanted to have something the Lord they wasn't recognizing he said that if you do not believe me search the scriptures the scripture tells who I am but still they couldn't recognize that they were so much tuned in their own mind what they say what I do with it so they couldn't let it go and that has gone on and on and on and on from time M and it's even still going on now because God hasn't changed and the people hasn't changed God takes his Spirit he take his people but not the spirit so the spirit comes anoint different some The Same Spirit anoint different people at different times so the Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever God has never changed so what am I trying to say what I'm trying to say is that in every age when God send someone with the word of God it becomes different to the people in their age but that word the way become different to them but that word is that said the Lord in the time of Moses it was different in the time of Noah Noah found Grace in the sight of God God told him to build an ark they haven't found it in such fashion before so what did they do they began to mock at him they began to do all kind of things at him mocking at him and doing everything and he preached for 120 years but that preaching was able to what get his family to believe what he was saying all the rest in the world it was different to them they didn't accept it and Moses exact same thing but we thank God there was Joshua and Caleb who took God by his word they didn't look at the conditions they believed God and they love God so much that their confidence was not was in God so when they went to see the spice they didn't look at how great those spice how giant they were their eyes was on the promise of God and on that promise of God it defies all logic it defies everything because God have said it and he will keep his word what cannot lie God cannot change so he honors all his word and if you are obey God because God is obligated only to his word the revealed word when I talk the word is a reveal what I'm talking about not just the letter because the letter kill but the spirit giveth life so God Hest his word so when that word you obey that word god becomes obligated also to you so it's offing is his word so when you obey that word and is revealed to you then God becomes obligated to you when that word was revealed to Abel God testified of his gift and the same thing God is doing now when that word is revealed to you and you manifest it God is going to testify that he is behind that so it's a reveal word that God honest it's not just the letter because the letter will kill you that letter is the one that they used to crucify the Lord Jesus Christ the same letter he was standing before them and they have read the Torah from years but they still couldn't recognize him being the word for the hour and that same thing is repeated itself in our day because he the same yesterday today and forever when the time came for them to receive his holy ghost when he gave himself to only 120 in the time of what um Israel in the time of Pentecost ear went up her room to receive a spirit it what it was was different to this people they haven't seen it in that fashion like before no wonder Granda said that Paul I all you almost persuaded me because agria hasn't heard it in that fashion before and in that fashion when it comes is the word of God but the people they become foreign to them they don't want to accept it but that's that said the Lord and he said that if you do not believe me you going to die in your sins amen what say what disbelief in his word there's only one thing is unbelief in God's word and if you believe in God's word you get everything you desire because in his word is everything's life amen so our god is awesome he's marching on with the word God hasn't stop he's the word is marching on so you got to match on with the tune of the word if you stay behind you'll be left behind no one that there will be a lot of people left behind because they left the word the reveal word for their day they looking back all the time and and look and saying something the for but they fail to recognize what God is doing in his present state of his ministry amen that's what the the secret lies that's what the strength lies that's why they that's what all the anointing everything that's why Abraham he was so bold because he recognized that he was fulfilling Mal 456 when you can so B and said I am the one fulfill revelation 10:7 Amos 3:7 all those scriptures Luke 17:30 you are so confident of that and all the word that you have been receiving that the prophet has preached to us all these years and the brothers in our church dtim BR Chris desm all everybody is going on what is he doing to you that word is what supposed to what give you faith and stand on the word of God we are not here to just um admire the word that is coming oh it's a good preaching and all that that's all night those days are gone you are here to apply the word of God because remember if you don't apply the token you're not going to get it all your children will going dead in the time of no in the time of Moses they have to apply the blood on the door post if that blood is not applied all your children your first born is dead and it's the same thing today you have to when you receive the word of is hearing recognize Lord and acting the portion the way that you have received how are you going to live it that said that some um lady who was the housewife the little that she received that she going to go through with that because it's not how much you know it's not how much you received it's how much you lived the portion that's revealed to you that's what is requiring from you he that has received more more will be required of him so whatever you have God wants you to what live it and manifest it it's your time to live it it's my time not just to admire the word that always say it's a good word we enjoy it it's good but let's move on and apply it in our lives amen because in it lies that rapturing Faith amen our God is good hallelujah praise God and what am I saying you see some people they are so caught up with their own stff their own ideas always want to touch it but it's a time that God don't want no man to touch it no man has no wonder that in the man transtion when Christ was the man transtion we saw Moses and Elijah he said hear in him because they want to build a monument for them hear in him this my son believeing so in other words Elijah is was a prophet for justice um Moses was a lawgiver you cannot lead the law I don't want the law I don't want God justices I want his grace he a grace of God that I'm trying on because I'm not going to stand in his Justice I don't want God Justice I can't stand the justice jce Because by the justice and the LA no man can stand it but the grace of God Grace Grace that is greater than all my sins Amazing Grace Grace that is greater than all Grace is what I'm standing for when the headstone CED it was Grace Grace Grace Grace that was time the Cry For The Headstone so it's amazing grace I don't want God's FL I don't want it just because I can't stand it but I can stand by his grace and that's alone that I'm standing on Amazing Grace of God nothing else do I desire brand only the grace of God because that's only thing that going to take us through not about your wor of righteousness how much you pay TI how much you attend church all those things are good but that's not what going to take you through is the grace of God and you being by the grace of being an elected lady for this hour that by his choice he ordained you before the foundations of the world out of the millions billions in this world his grace came to you that you are elected lady out of the millions that alone we can thank God and praise Him million times because that is greater than anything else out of millions of people billions times almost more than 78 billion God grace found you grace of God Found Me Brother D it found you he found me I'm going to I'm thankful for God you have to Rejoice no matter what you going through no matter what the enemy is attacking you no matter what what comes my way my our life in his hand he knows what is good for us he knows everything we going through he cares for you he love you he's a wonderful God he wants to bless you more than you can even think he said I'll do exceeding abundantly more than what you can even think expect that's the god that we are serving he's a living God he can do more than you can even think tonight even right now if thou can't believe all things are possible accept your healing accept your deliverance accept anything you have of tonight because our god is awesome he's the same yesterday today and forever if he did in the past he's going to do it again because that same God hasn't changed amen if you raise the dead by he can raise the dead now amen our god is awesome and going to do a mighty Works something that greater more people will be what raptured amen they haven't seen it in that fashion but it's going to come to pass a group of people not going to see death those elected ladies one of these days you going to be gone praise God ah God is awesome amen he hasn't changed he's still the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise God so I'm going to go back to um Romans chapter 7 verse 15- 24 Romans 7:15 to2 24 for that which I do allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I if then I do that which I will not I consent unto the Lord that is it is good now then it is no more I that do it the sin that dwelt in me for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing that's your first husband for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me is it keep on going I think I find a new law that when I will do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my member Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin okay in other words just trying to let us know even since we are children there's always been the battle going on in our mind yes sir your conscience some sometimes you want to do this this one is fighting with this that is going on every time but as the Indian chief ST which one you feed on most that get what the victory so you have the right to accept the good things and move on with it and reject the bad ones it's not you that done that because in you that seed of God cannot sin but it's the flesh the path that has that F that has that PA that does that but that has no power over you you ignore it and feed on the true word of God what is happening is that some people they keep on digging and going back to your memory for the mistakes they did they don't want to set themselves free and feeding on all those things and thinking about how people did Bad Thing to them and they can't forgive and forget they can't forgive from their when someone deal with something wrong that bothers you as God use barad to speak that that time you have to pray and forgive that person and let it go you have to release that person once you pray and release that person you become free don't hold those things in your mind don't dig them and visit them going to make you miserable but if the victories that you have if the things that God revealed to you when God visits you when those good things that have spot in every Christian life that you always remember how God came to you there are so many things that the devil cannot take it away from even if you attacks you you can get back to and say what about this what about that what about this that God did to me what about this happened he going to run away from you because you a Son of God and God has given you evidence he has given you victories upon victories and Vis and reveal himself to you that's what Samson did when it came down that he was blind and everything was like he didn't know what to do and he saw that he has that mistake he began to think about the victory what God didn't to that was he was thinking about and when he was thinking of all those things then he said once more Lord let me die with my enemies so what I'm trying to I don't go and D past H past um P past sin and past mistakes but you can remember the good part and meditate on it because you have the right you have the right what you feed on what you think what you you think on that what forms atmosphere around brother said on Sunday so let's go dick let's not concentrate on those things and one other thing too our God is good God he honest his word he he keeps his word and one thing is like if you plant something you don't go and dig every week to see that thing is going to grow so it is with some people you pray and you believe and you move and you move on and you commit to God's hand amen commit to God and live it there but some people come so hard for them they always want to visit it because it's not how much you visit that going to bring it to pass but one Faith you believe in God you accept that way Lord this situation I commit to you like that Prophet that King did did he said that yes those people are what they are strong the Army is great they can do all this he just wrote a letter and give it to the Lord and leave the go and said Lord the battle is yours it's not mine I cannot fight the battle and God said the battle is mine I will fight your battles for you and he fought and they got what victory so all I'm trying to say tonight that any battle anything you facing leave it in in God's hand and leave it there leave it there Hallelujah don't go and visit it here I said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever is that right in 20 years of research of the Bible and talking with the angel of the Lord and many things I find there is two things that is love and faith if you love God just purely unadulterated love you've got to have faith in him it to accompany Faith every time and when love and faith gets married you ask what you want to and you will have it that's when you know that your heavenly father cannot tell you any lie here is very important your heavenly father cannot tell you any lie he is God he can't lie and when you believe him with all your heart and you believe that what you ask for you ask it not for any selfish motive but your right motive behind there is ask it for the glory of God and believe without a shadow of doubt that your father wouldn't lie you something's going to take place when you get all the co out of the way and just look right straight there to Calvary and believe it with all your heart in other words we have to have confidence no matter what comes your way that the god that we are serving he cannot lie he cannot change you lie this one lie but nobody I lie but no God cannot lie he keeps all his appointment he keeps all his promises listen God satisfied desire of every living thing including the small animals the fish the um the fish the the the ants and he knows the every bite of their of their eyelid and everything even the heads on her head this Mighty God knows it amen that this God was so great that one time when he want to talk the children of Israel he thed and they all scared and said don't Moses we can't let God talk to us you talk to us said I'll raise a prophet unto myself and he going to talk to you and then this Mighty God was so great that if you check in the Tabernacles the holy of holies those time you take only the high priest to go there once a year and even if that high priest make any mistake he's dead but you and I all this my this Mighty God that created the every living thing came and shed his blood and he is living in you and me what a privilege that we have what an awesome God what Grace that God has given to us he should make us happy the most happiest people on the face of this Earth that God that thundered and everything is SC that great God came became man and died and shed his blood so that you and I can come into His presence can come to his AB to come and dwell in us we should be the most happiest thing of the happiest people on the face of this Earth no matter what you going through no matter what comes my way our God is Awesome our God is able our God is good in his own time he will make all things beautiful it might not come the way he want it but he will come right on time he's on time God he's on time he's always on time he might not come the way you have speculated the way you have planned but he will bring it to pass because there's someone who has planned your future he has PR planned everything about you Brad he has preplanned all your life he planned before you were born and he's going to take care of it whatever portion of the word that you have fulfill no demon in hell can stop it it will come to pass whatever God has ordained you to fulfill you're going to fulfill it regardless of the attack of the devil it will come to pass one of these days it may take long but to accomplish the vision will come to pass surely it will come to pass amen he said my thought for you is not an evil thought I have a good thought for to give an expected end my thought for you my thoughts are higher than your thoughts he said I have good thought for you and God talk all good about us in his mind his thought he has a good thought for us above all things I wish you prosper and be in health even as your so prospered prosperity in all aspect redemption in three part he didn't even come only for the flesh he came for the Soul every part of you Redemption he's consuming his line Your Heart Lord that word of God is here amen the Lord what is happening is that God sent us a Vindicated prophet he used mightly the lame world the blind SE people that think they even got it but what people are forgotten to know is that that same God on that was in that Prophet is here in the bright form tonight he's doing the same thing but people are blinded they still pointing back that God lives in you he lives in me he hasn't changed he the same yesterday today and forever we are the Oracles of God now where is God in his bride he's not on the cross anymore amen he used the prophet mightly we admire we accept We Believe everywhere the prophet said we listen to the tapes but now the word has been moved on in the bride he took his prophet he didn't take his Spirit where is the god of Elijah Elijah God is here amen he's here to lead us give that here to lead us Elijah God is here with us amen God of Elijah is still with us brother so why are

and unto the Lord and all the Angels stood around Revelation 710 to12 and all the Angels around about the throne and about the elders and the four beast and fell Before the Throne on their face and worship God saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving and might be unto our God forever and ever amen he deserves all the glory and honor amen wisdom and Thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever amen he's all time God he a wise God Amen before him there is no any other God form neither will there be any other God form after him amen there's no one beside there's no more after him he's one living God and his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he cares for you he cares for me amen our God is good praise God hallelujah I'm not a long I don't speak for long so I'm going to read Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 and try to wrap up now Galatians 2 20 so I think I gave you the title my title was justification is not a law okay in Galatians 2:20 I'm crucified of Christ never delay L I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me in other words we have come to the place that we have he said come unto me all ye that is heavy laden and I will I will give you rest unto your soul so you have gone to that rest that Christ the life that we are living now is not you or me but Christ is the one that liveth in me and in you he's the same yesterday today and forever because he lives in you he lives in me and if he lives in you he lives in me as God send it as God spoke through Jeremiah and Daniel read Jeremiah writings what did he do to Daniel when he read that writings and he saw that the end was closer to come it put him under desperation to see God and at that desperation God show him everything that was going to happen to the end same thing applied to us God sent us a Vindicated prophet and if you are reading his writings and if you are checking the modern events being made clear by Vindicated prophecy nobody going to tell you that it's a desperate hour it's time for us to be desperate more for God because the B say if you SE me deligently with all your heart you shall find me because it's a desperate hour because all the things that we were expecting to come we have seen them fulfilling in our own eyes if we are seeing them I'm not trying to put any interpretation to what is happening back in Israel but if you can watch just last Sunday Saturday there were some people who even got an order from the police to go for what to the that Temple to go and make a demonstration to do something they wanted to do something over there and later on they take that permit from them they not allow them to do that demonstration but if you read by Daniel and even in Matthew 24: um I think 25 was so going he said that when you see the abomination of that coming then then it means that the end is near I'm not saying that they're going there to get rid of the temple and build the new Temple right now what I'm trying to say is that if you check before Jesus Christ was born there was anointing in the air and he put some people to act before the time Judas Maas and all those things they did all that's why gamia said that if this is of God when they arrested um Jesus Christ if it's God it will come to pass not from him it will not come to pass because they saw people arising and do that so when the thing is happening it brings the atmosphere in the air and people began to what act right so if your eyes are open you can see that we are in a desperate hour it's not time to joke the coming of the Lord picking up the bride is closer than we think and as our pastor has already taught us in every age the overlaps it doesn't come just like that it overlaps like that I read in the overlapping stage say is it the time when you see things going on so I encourage everyone let's be desperate because is a grace of God but we have a boundaries to be around that God has given us if you don't run within the boundaries of God um plan you are in trouble one time one Wednesday I wanted to come I I was supposed to preach over here and then I didn't know what to say a thought thought a thought came to me to preach about driving in your lane I said what what can I say about driving your lane so I just leave it and then I was that time I was leaving MGA I was just driving down the dandas coming I was right in my Lane and somebody came making a left turn he hit my driving mirror I said oh my God wants me talk about it what am I trying to say so I talk about it and then it blesses the Saints why because if you are driving in that lane you have room to play around that lane but if you go outside the the lane you are in trouble the guy went outside the lane he got accident he got fine he has to fix my driving mirror for me so as far as you are within the boundaries of God's word you are fine you are free in there to do anything you go outside it you got in trouble and some people also when they are driving you see because somebody's in front of them you can see that maybe the car is moving like that within the lane but it's is not being steady so they watch and they criticize that driver he's not a good driver meanwhile they don't know how their car is to is driving so the scripture is saying that um seek your own salvation with fear and tremble even as the time what approach as the time so it's a time that God is not giving you to be watch man of other people you examine yourself to see if you are in the faith examine your life EX I me your own self first and if you see somebody is going wrong you go on your knees and pray for them there's no need to gossip there's no need to this that let's pray and bound and be a true brothers and sisters love one another let Love Project When Love Project Grace takes over there's no time to gossip about people and all this and all that yes you see a lot of fault about me I I can see your fault but it's not what I'm concentrating on I'm concentrating on the gift the path that edifies me that's what important to me all those mistakes God will take care of it if you see you pray for the person unless it's a bad that you need then you go with somebody take the tell the deons or your pastor but let's examine ourselves let's consecrate ourself let's rededicate our life knowing that the end is near our time on this he is short and if there was ever a time that I want to live Asam said is this time because it's the Golden Age this is the time that all the culmination everything was he going to go to take us up to the Rapture because listen it's the most wicked age with a lot of demons and everything but it's also a glorious age because all the saints before us all of them are cheering for us all those Spirits is a head on Amen and we are Marching on so even though that when the enemy rise like a flag the spirit of God raise a standard so every time he rise up the spirit of raising a standard so we are the last end we are the last one and they all cheering let's let's press on let's let's let's run with the rest the patience set before us and go because nothing going to hinder us we are on our way to um can that BR to the can you please come so it's going home time amen praise God so all that I'm saying tonight let's cheer let's Dare for one another and examine ourselves and just let's consecrate our life more and let God have the prance and have the glory I'm done for tonight [Applause]
