Jesus speaking but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of this son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat and they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but in the same day that lot went out of Sodom the fire fell it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen thanks be to God father we thank you for just reading of the word and we ask your blessing now in Jesus name amen God bless you please be seated of course you know we are living in a day of Revelation and uh when we are speaking uh the word what they are hearing is the written word and that is why they can reason it and they can compare and they can uh do all the types of analysis and uh dividing it and stuff like that nature but you see what is happening now is that the bride has become the word and she has become the voice of God to the age in which she's living therefore what is really happening is that um they their emphasis is on the written word uh which is true and it's right but the phase of which we are in now uh it's gone to a higher dimension and now uh we are in the seven Thunders you know what I'm talking about the the seven Thunders which is the revelation of the word see they come out of the word they are HID in the word but not written in the word it's some sort of strange and funny to say that but it's in the word and it is the word but God didn't allow it to be written in the word praise God that has got to be received by revelation amen and to have to receive that Revelation you have got to have a receptor in you and that receptor in you is not something you get last year when you repented at an altar what it was in you because you were born with Christ the Eternal seed of life within you as a believing son or daughter of the Living God Jesus said no man no woman can come unto me except the father calls him or her praise God you cannot come praise the Lord glory is marvelous wonderful name and I'm so glad to God for this uh wonderful face that he has given to us by the Holy Spirit of the Living God amen glory to God hallelujah now let's go and talk a little bit about the Pentecostals because last Sunday and uh for two or three Sundays we've been talking about separation and different stages of it and uh now we want to talk about continue to speak about it here now let me take the topic is we are in the last phase of redemption we are in the last phase of redemption now praise the Lord hallelujah oh my God now see uh brother Abraham is saying what the Pentecostal Church have to do it had to lay there it had to go to ground it had to die it has to rot oh my in order to bring forth that life again praise the Lord hallelujah now see he redeems the world the same way he redeems a man amen the man believes he's baptized he's cleansed by the blood Hallelujah then the Holy Ghost fire comes and it begins to take the world out of him see which that Spirit comes which is the word and what he's saying here that Spirit comes which is the word see God Redeeming the world the same way he says you know I spoke about that in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly brain praise the Lord now let's go back now to see what he's saying now let's start out with the world was already condemned and it was condemned by the sin in the garden and Adam gave up the title deed and fell from the word he fell out of the word of God hallelujah now the preaching of Noah type the justification that we now receive from Jesus Christ because what happened the water the flood it just washed out the washed out sin and washed out evil but it left a lot of rotting corpses and stuff but it did its job by doing the washing then he then here he says the next thing he doesn't say that the way I said it I just want you to know that so that I'm just looking here seeing what he said I understand what he said and I'm just telling you praise the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah now see then you see for God use that to baptize the Earth with water right then his son came along and dropped his blood upon it my see water blood you see by that blood he was claiming it for his own he was claiming and sanctifying it and claiming it for his own then in the final wind up is the renovation by the fire Amen on this Earth will be burnt up with fire not destroyed not disappear you can annihilate it it's a spoken word of God but it will be burnt with fire amen and that fire he says I'm speaking of well born every germ out of the atmosphere in the uh Heavenly bright from an Earthly bright he said it will even burn up devils and evil spirits that infest an inhabit the upper atmospheres and it will destroy it it says this is not just a normal fire amen it's the fire the consuming fire of God hallelujah that can burn natural and Supernatural glory to God hallelujah amen so it will burn that out and after that what happens you see Millennium now I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth coming down from God hallelujah praise God now he moves from the world and we're talking now see the same phases the same phases uh let me use the term three steps to a birth right three steps to a birth and he's used and is using the same phases of the Natural Earth that God took the natural or true the flood of Noah the baptism of blood of Jesus Christ and then the baptism holy ghost at Pentecost that came and That Came Upon them at that time but for the Natural Earth I just mixed the spiritual and the natural day you see uh but for the natural art that will go right to the end of things when the fire of God burns up the Natural Earth to renovate it that's the word to renovate it not destroy it but to renovate it or to make it new praise the Lord because he said I saw a new Heaven from the new Earth praise God hallelujah amen but you see God did the same thing with Jesus for Jesus he says was baptized in water then he came Sanctified to begin with already by the father hallelujah amen then you see then the Dove came upon him and claimed that part of the life that was here part of the earth praise the Lord quickly just like you and me he's come back to claim that part of his life that is in that part of the earth in this hour right and eternal can only call out to Eternal and him God only calling to God and deep can only call to deepen that sort of thing and husband to wife and so on now praise God that's what's going on here right now that was taking place now praise the Lord that's why we feel appalled a pulsation within our heart that we can't put into words to explain to them but something struck the tune in Fork within our soul we hear a sound we hear a certain sound and it appeals to it and draws us very much into the presence of the Living God hallelujah amen praise God see and when that happens destroy this Temple I'll rise it up again in other words that can't die that can't die there and so when a man or a woman really comes into God completely now not under some spell of some church or under some emotion or real or like that but they really come when the word and him becomes one when that happens that person is saved amen Sanctified from the things of the world Hallelujah and the spirit begins to renovate everything of the world away from them with the fire of the Holy Ghost amen I thank God he's still renovating on me I thank God the renovation is still going on it's not finished yet but he's renovating this being let's hear praise the name of the Lord glory be to God hallelujah you see that fire falls and he then lives in the person and he lives in the person to reflect himself Hallelujah you see why he had to renovate you you see why he the fire had to come praise God so that he can come now and live in his own Temple not one that Solomon built he says you you want to build me a temple but I living a temple that is not made by hands human hands amen praise God and we know we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and God dwells in us but you see he had he lives now in that person to reflect himself oh to reflect that perfect man that perfect woman because they are living by the word praise God hallelujah you got Perfection I said Perfection is within you because Perfection is Jesus Christ there is none other perfect uh than he is and perfectionist there we're not talking about this stumbling uh or fearful doubting a man on the outside born in sin shaped and then if we come to the world speaking lies but we're talking about the other man the inside man that God has in their praise be to God forevermore glory to God hallelujah amen see and so we see that praise the Lord see he wants the that part just Jesus Christ now he wants to use this Earth praise the Lord in the same way so he redeems it praise the Lord to make you a vessel for his honor and Glory Hallelujah praise God now let's watch the same three steps in the church the church as a whole let's watch the three steps here now like Adam Farrell he doesn't say that I'm saying it praise the Lord I shouldn't say that you just listen praise the Lord see now uh the church fell in the ground at nicaea in other words I see what he's what what what he's wanting to say just like Adam fell back there now the church fell and Adam fell there to throw the whole world in sin the church failed the whole world in dogmas and Creeds and sins and everything else amen see oh my right into organization hallelujah amen see and what happened later he began to bring her out under temporary Resurrection oh my and he tried to do that through using Luther now notice using Luther doing the same thing as he did through Noah amen justification sanctification same three steps back again okay oh my but Luther failed for he organized he failed the word hallelujah now but he started it he started the church his resurrection all right so the church comes up and she was just a little leaf didn't look like the original grain that went into the ground see because now notice the church was only being used as a carrier for the life baby for example Mary right it was used as a carrier for the life that's all of us elected that was in the church down Through the Ages right down to this time is that right the church as much as you you know we preach we talk the church this we speak about denomination but you've got to recognize I'm not saying we're going to go there and glorify them now but you've got to understand that God had to have them and have that vessel for us to be able to come and be made manifest in this day and in this hour praise the Lord see no mind see it's the carrier of the life now you know Wesley's message was closer to the Bible than Luther's message amen hallelujah and after that the Pentecostals but what came out of the Pentecostals praise God now when that first little grain of wheat comes out on the stock of wheat it absolutely like its grain it looks like green is that right but what is it it is not green that is the hour Jesus spoke of Matthew 24 24. oh so close that it would deceive the elect if it were possible amen it's not where he's talking about the hour of Temptation spoken of in Revelation the hour of Temptation and deception when the church matures to the point just past the Pentecostals when they have come to their rightness and they start looking like they're green that's the hour of Temptation and and deception right there because the thing is so close he says that it's the it was deceive even the elect if it were possible oh my what an hour that we are living in Hallelujah but it does look like the brain see now you will have to sit down and really get a microscope from somewhere oh thank God he's given us a microscope Hallelujah the eyes of the spirit the eyes of a prophet the eyes of the Holy Spirit to look at the word amen hallelujah and see when you take that microscope glass and begin to really check it out pull this back pull that back you'll find out it's nothing but a shock foreign a carrier if God used it not only as a carrier but he used it also to protect the grain oh blessed be the name of the Lord so in the middle of all of their jumping on their carrying on and so on God looking at his elect but he allowed them to pass through these phases so they can come to where they are amen see they spoken towns they did this they did that right they look exactly like the green but you go get a good glass look back there and there's a little Bob of grain coming on there is the real thing but this is a carrier it's there to protect the grain it's working in harmony with the grain amen when you're amongst them and you're a member of them and their denomination everything is fine everything is dandy wonderful praise God working in harmony but you see that he did that to protect that grain amen hallelujah oh my our seed praise the Lord now that grand come up and pass through all them lutherans Wesley through there and come right up down and to that hour of the Pentecostal and now it looks so perfectly no wonder Jesus said it would deceive the very elected if it were possible hallelujah amen so when the process gets to this stage if the hour of deception but at the same time is the hour of the glass of Revelation right the two comes together revelation God conquers Satan coming with his deception so the same hour of deception is the hour when Revelation goes to a higher octave to detect the Antichrist Spirit right in the church amen because you realize uh I I'm talking about the Pentecostals but it's gone further now amen and every time he goes up iron God raises up a standard against him and now he is hiding in the message he's hiding in the light he's hiding right in the open oh my think about it oh praise God now notice here oh we are living in in this hour and we know that any Revival only lasts about three years and then out of that Revival will come an organization brother sister and he's speaking at that time now look how many years I've passed he says this revival has gone on for 15 years and there has come no organization out of it in this 15-year Revival listen I have lived in it I have been privileged to live in it and to be with you in it oh praise God hallelujah there hasn't been an organization come out of it out of this message there are no more organizations there won't be amen doesn't mean out in the world they're not going to be forming organizations every day but out of this message there will be no organizations amen there is the last of it amen but Pentecost was allowed and had to be there to protect this well amen and where would we have been with this message if God had not allowed Pentecost to be there so that the grain could emerge out of Pentecost that's what he's talking about and that's why many times I say um unless they don't attack you don't attack them uh if God didn't use the Baptist the Pentecost to teach the people the Bible you won't be able to go even witness to them they're going to have any biblical knowledge they won't have any background or foundations to be able to receive the truth of the word of the Living God Amen I want you to know the truth and I must say this I have not got much time left you know that I am 55 years old but long after I'm gone these steps will live on can you say Amen and then you'll see whether this is right or not you'll see if I am a true servant or I am some false prophet amen everything I've told you it's all come to pass hallelujah amen and I've never told you nothing yet but that it happened see but Pentecost was just a carrier see now the life is telling us that Christ is on earth now the life is now here praise God a greater than Solomon is here oh blessed be the name of the Lord now but you see when the wheat the wheat is talking about us now the seed of God in the bride amen when the wheat begins to grow like the the the Jewish church was a carrier for Jesus himself but when he began to tell them the truth of God's word that's when there began to separate from him you see what I'm talking about that's the hour that's the junction that's the time when the separation begins when they come not when we start out with the message just like he said not when he started out with the message but when it came to his turtle and began to say I see I and my father are one foreign oh my certain of God he's confident he knows who he is he knows who is and when the bride begins to know who she is oh praise God hallelujah that's the hour amen oh praise God no what did he say in the seals he says Satan then you better be careful amen praise God now notice that's the time of separation when they begin to tell them the truth that's when they're separated from him and now what is happening the same thing again amen when you speak the truth the Revelation is what strikes the brain which it has shocked her and she's beginning to say it back what she received then brother sister that's what caused the separation right there like they said to him where you see that in the word where it's written where did Moses say that he didn't say it in those words but I'm saying it to you Hallelujah now with a bride now he's using that technology to say when the bride or the grain the true seed of God comes to that stage again when she uh understands the revelation of the word hallelujah then she stands certain of God she begins to speak that word she becomes the voice of God she becomes the voice the seven Sanders began to express itself to her amen when she knows what to do with the word of God Amen see when they begin to tell the truth of Hallelujah because that wheat must lay itself before the presence of the sun he says s-o-n-s-u-n praise God see I'm talking about the spiritual wheat has got to lay before the sun Hallelujah the spiritual wheat now praise God must lay before the Sun so that it can be turned into golden grain of the world or in other words be made the word and I say for this hour made the word hallelujah praise God hallelujah now see not only that she has made the word but again God made flesh and Vindicated Why by the word amen praise God oh praise God didn't he say the word is becoming flesh and flesh is going back to being word oh praise God forevermore you come from God you're going back to God Amen yes sir praise God you come from being a part of God you're going back to his side again amen praise the name of the Lord yes sir now he that believeth on me the works I do shall he do and the true church that lives by the word rightly not by organization but lays itself in the presence of the word the sun see that it becomes what it becomes the very same word that came down on them under their Pentecost the same word hallelujah and of course he says the word is a spirit and we know that praise the Lord in that day I believe it is Jesus said when the son of man is being revealed amen he says listen I am saying when the son of man is being revealed not a man being revealed praise the Lord so in a nice ways referring to himself because he could all maybe he saw what was going to happen so it's not a man being revealed but the son of man is being revealed Christ is making himself known Hallelujah so all these others are talking about themselves about being son of man or when the when man landed on the moon that's when the Holy Spirit landed on him when he becomes the son of man and all these kind of false teachings and stuff like that I I won't repeat them lest one of you believe that but if you're a true seed of God you can't amen that's why I feel free to speak the word make a praise God I can't they can feel free to speak the word of God hallelujah amen see now you see I say when the son of man is being revealed not the man being revealed not some organization being revealed but the son of man what is that the word itself returning the word itself living himself again amongst his people glory to God God in us hallelujah oh praise God God in Christ Christ in the church and now he says the kingdom coming glory to God hallelujah amen so it's a word that's coming again itself made flesh he says in you then you are a reflection of this message of this hour you become a reflection of it because what see you can't die anymore not your body but the man inside you can't die amen amen because you are living that life [Music] that was Jesus Christ you're living the same life that was Jesus Christ how are you going to die see and what you are doing now you are laying in the presence of the sun Hallelujah and when you do the rest of the shock begins to separate itself from the beat see what I was trying to tell you I repeated over and over it's not us God's word called for total separation it's not us separating ourselves from people right right it's the Holy Spirit causing that to take place without us doing nothing or saying nothing it's his work it's his plan that we sure came right down from the beginning right on down and we are now in the last phase when the shock of all all parts All Phases of the life of a shock amen right down from Luther right through the Pentecostal and now infiltrate the message like it infiltrated Jesus's church right there we are right there in this hour right now and that is what's taking place amen hallelujah and the separation comes when that shark pulls itself away Hallelujah when it begins to be manifested amen see oh what happened see the life went out of them and all that life now goes into the grain Hallelujah and once that life is in the green that life won't change and it does not change amen but the carriers they changed they have to change and they have to denominate see for strength in other words they got to combine their strength together uh one will chase a thousand ten you know uh will chase ten thousand they gotta combine just to fight one believer so they're gonna combine their their forces together see they have to change they must denominate see but the wheat cannot change right it's your original sea that can't change it come from God that is going back to God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord see let me repeat it now the shock has to pull away from the wheat and that is God's plan that is God's Providence amen he says it again the shark has to pull away or separate from that wit why is it pulling away because now the wheat is in that maturing stage amen the wheat is maturing in the word of God hallelujah and he's finding less and less places to hide less and less places that he can deceive so so he's got to pull away oh my God that seed is maturing now now the shock now was only a supporter it was only a carrier of the life it was only a protector Hallelujah but now the life is right out there in other words the life isn't in them anymore the life is out there manifesting amen and and it's right there with the grain oh friends what a day hey we are living in praise God I want to say praise God hallelujah oh praise God forevermore he says do you know and I'm winding this down they're trying to make me make an organization they came to me and said brother Branham will you make an organization based on your ministry I said not me those are the words he got here not me oh my oh and I'm not here talking about me see you see them missing the point amen I am talking about this message of the hour and of this day that's what I am talking about amen hallelujah and some of them didn't listen they went up there now watch it now right up there into Canada and got the few of them latter rain Brethren you know um out there or in the West you know they had the big Prairie Revival they call it out in the West in the there that was off for brother Brown's Ministry you know right all those men Bible Bill and all this uh Preston Manning's father and many others tons of them of course praise the Lord and The Big Revival started out there under the influence of the latter rain all coming out from Brother branham's Ministry but he told them plain he wants nothing to do with it he's not back of it and he's not founding nothing like that see like that no and so then oh praise God no yes and they made millions of converts from that and made them slows the slaves slaves of their Creeds this is terminology you know or what Revelation says in horror will be found the soul slaves The Souls of man amen here is our souls there are slaves to their Creeds amen no my becoming rich building millions and millions and billions of dollars in buildings and things like that saying the Lord is coming the Lord is coming sending out preachers to seminaries and things and educating them on some man-made theology amen I almost said popsicle but uh oh my oh and it all become nothing but a shock Amen in other words not that they were completely useless it wasn't God's will but out of them came out people that believe the message of the hour that if you know that praise God we have brother Hildebrandt we got other brothers many others that came out because they knew about it but they came out of it praise God and God used them in their office or they have to stay right there praise God and it becomes shock hallelujah amen but now we know them denominational and Pentecostal spirits have now found their way right into this message and that is their High form of deception that's going on it looked like a man but it was a serpent it looked like a believer but but it could be a judo Spirit it could be Antichrist Spirit it could be an unbelieving spirit I don't know but I'm just trying to cast something for you so you can see what the word what the word is trying to tell us why we got to be so vigilant and watchful praise the Lord hiding in a message trying to pervert it stay in it long enough and try to subvert it try it or stay in the message in every possible way and trying to undermine the kingdom of God somewhere in and some are out and the whole thing is working uh under uh satanic deception and Leadership but thank God he says thanks be to God the grave is still going on and that God has traveled on down and is here tonight it's here with us and in US and I'm thankful to God hallelujah amen oh my don't you see how much longer do we have here how much longer have we got amen see I hear the coming of the combined I hear it the world counseling he says here the World Council amen and she will separate it now he's gone from spiritual back to natural and saying in the natural she's going to separate it and by doing that separation of the true and the false is we're all not buying and selling and all those kinds of things are going to come in that's the natural separation but spiritually the word is already doing that separation now the word is separating us praise the Lord hallelujah but what are they going to do they'll separate it amen praise God what will she do then oh my she will shave off all the rest of them stock that's in other words hanging on in the midst and hanging on in her he said she'll shave off all of that stalker under and then she'll get on that elevator that's waiting for her and she'll go home one of these mornings oh praise God hallelujah amen I know when he's talking about Canada and Out West there all you can see is is wheat fields for aspires I could see amen they usually make a joke saying that if your your dog wanders away from home you can see him into tomorrow uh it's still out there on the horizon because it's so black I'm playing with wheat amen so when he's saying here what has she got left nothing but to get in the grain elevator and God taking the grain home praise the Lord amen yes sir and I tell you she'll go home one of these mornings I know the world won't believe this in truth they can't believe it now he's saying that it's not me there he says they can't believe it and because of that we just feel sorry for them we feel sorry cause no man can come except my father draws him and all my father has given me will come to me praise God all my father you see if their name is on The Book of Life then they will certainly recognize this word is that right amen why do you recognize it where were you when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God were shouting for joy and if you were there and you are worshiping him and praising him and glorifying him there and he was always the word and you're going to recognize the word hair just because it comes in a word form or it comes in a spoken word form you have recognize the word Hallelujah that's why they won't even know about nor Rapture because they can't even recognize this word so when the word comes to her now they're going to see it they won't they won't recognize that all this Illusions they have of standing up and watching people rising going up in the in the air in a Rapture is just nonsense it's not in the word they won't see anything they don't have that ability to see that amen oh I know the world won't believe that they can't believe it just feel sorry for them see oh my but if that man's name is on The Book of Life they'll recognize the word he has got to amen oh my we would have no more organization but because all the organizations will go into one they are binding themselves together for the burning together in one great organization but there will be no more organization why the wheat is now here he must recognize some people right back there while he was yet preaching that had caught his message caught the genuine revelation he says because the wheat is here then he it says it raised his hands I say thanks be to God the wheat is now here praise God Christ is now here he proven his word Lord of God that's the truth the wheat he repeats again is now here and it is beginning it's maturing now oh praise God it's now laying in the presence of the Sun and maturing oh praise God and the rest of it is pulling away from him oh praise God they say we have nothing to do with that we would have anything to do with that amen oh my oh brother sister if there is anything I must say make sure get in the wheat know who you are amen praise God glory to God now he says and this is really closing now he says there was a doctor and he was a fine man he loved
