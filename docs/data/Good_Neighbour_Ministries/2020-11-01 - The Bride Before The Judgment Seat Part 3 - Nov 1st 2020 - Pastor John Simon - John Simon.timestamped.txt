[43:56] uh pastor simon is just delayed for a
[43:59] little bit
[44:01] but we thought that um take the
[44:03] opportunity to just come up and
[44:06] say a few words about our prayer
[44:07] meetings on friday nights
[44:10] we've been having our online prayer
[44:12] meeting
[44:14] every friday night for those of you that
[44:17] have been joining us
[44:18] every friday night you know what's been
[44:20] happening you know the testimonies that
[44:23] are coming forth
[44:24] we have not missed i think we only
[44:27] missed
[44:28] one in all of the in
[44:31] since we started because we don't want
[44:34] to miss
[44:34] one of them they have been absolutely
[44:38] spectacular the testimonies that have
[44:41] been coming forth
[44:42] have been tremendous
[44:45] yes i'm going to allow brother desmond
[44:48] to come and
[44:50] um you know we've had some tremendous
[44:52] tremendous testimonies
[44:54] so even if you can't make it
[44:57] i'm telling you get your
[45:00] prayer requests in call your deacon call
[45:03] one of the brothers
[45:04] uh you know that you know are regularly
[45:07] there you can call me anytime because i
[45:09] i basically administer it like the
[45:12] the actual online um uh
[45:16] you know director right to you know
[45:18] because i have to run it and so forth
[45:20] but we have different brothers
[45:21] that rotate to minister the services
[45:25] they have been tremendous saints and so
[45:28] this this past friday night
[45:32] we had a prayer request uh you know
[45:36] you know i'd say you know come on up and
[45:38] give it but i'm just gonna give it
[45:39] anyway because
[45:40] just to keep it down from the amount of
[45:42] people coming and moving
[45:44] but sister patsy uh caitlyn she's got a
[45:47] brother
[45:48] in trinidad that um you know
[45:52] always kind of never wanted to have
[45:54] anything to do with the message was
[45:56] stubborn
[45:57] um you know because her family and so
[45:59] forth her parents
[46:00] they you know they believe this word but
[46:03] you know there's always that one or two
[46:05] siblings that
[46:06] they just don't you know they don't want
[46:08] to know
[46:09] that's okay it's not because they don't
[46:11] want to know it's because it's not their
[46:13] time
[46:14] that's what it is but there's a time in
[46:16] a season for every single
[46:18] son and daughter of god and so
[46:21] he just so happened to be on his
[46:24] deathbed
[46:25] on friday night hadn't eaten anything in
[46:27] over two weeks
[46:29] they basically said he's on his way
[46:32] out and so the prayer request was
[46:36] brought
[46:36] to the meeting and we prayed
[46:40] for uh her brother what is his name
[46:46] nello nello brother nello
[46:49] and so anyways saturday morning
[46:52] she gets note a call he's
[46:57] [Music]
[47:04] [Music]
[47:06] she says he's been crying he's had a
[47:09] meal
[47:10] [Music]
[47:16] then he says i want to be baptized
[47:19] by pastor simon
[47:21] [Music]
[47:23] so what's going on saints
[47:27] when i heard that testimony this morning
[47:28] i was rejoicing
[47:30] i said you know god's timing on
[47:33] everything
[47:34] is perfect he's never ever
[47:37] ever off he knows exactly what he's
[47:40] doing
[47:40] that should give us faith as sons and
[47:44] daughters of god to know that
[47:46] there's nothing out of order god is
[47:49] dealing with his children
[47:51] he knows exactly when to deal with them
[47:53] speak to them
[47:54] raise them up from the dead whatever
[47:56] needs to be done amen
[47:58] praise god so you know that's just one
[48:01] testimony but we've had
[48:02] so many it's it's just been like brother
[48:05] chris could come up here
[48:07] he was testifying on friday night of you
[48:10] know certain things that
[48:11] were brought before the lord in our
[48:13] prayer meetings
[48:15] tremendous like it just what is it it's
[48:17] just god saying that you know what
[48:20] like you have faith i will always
[48:24] honor your faith and you know we we have
[48:27] this conception oh we've got to be
[48:29] in the church and we've got to be
[48:32] gathered together
[48:33] you know praying all together in order
[48:36] for him to move he sits back and he says
[48:38] are you kidding me yes
[48:41] that is something that i really love and
[48:44] i will always bless
[48:45] and i will but that doesn't limit him
[48:49] from how he wants to deal and and answer
[48:52] prayer
[48:52] and do things and he knows all about
[48:54] this pandemic
[48:56] he knows exactly the circumstances that
[48:58] we're dealing with
[48:59] but if we can be faithful to be at the
[49:02] services no matter where they are
[49:04] i know there's a lot of you out there
[49:06] today that are sitting in the comfort of
[49:08] your home
[49:09] you have a reason for being there like
[49:12] we said last week
[49:13] not every one of you could be here
[49:16] we'd have to be turning you away at the
[49:18] door and then you'd have made the trip
[49:20] and missed the service because you got
[49:21] to drive all the way home
[49:23] but there's an order and god has
[49:26] provided that order for us
[49:28] and everybody is being led and moved in
[49:30] a certain way
[49:31] so if you're at home you can you can
[49:34] receive
[49:35] everything that we receive right here
[49:37] there's no difference
[49:40] because he's honoring your faith
[49:43] he doesn't he doesn't say well i'm going
[49:45] to be at 5270 new street too bad if
[49:48] you're not there

[49:53] time ago

[51:43] whole family
[51:45] was scared they were all up satan has
[51:47] teared them up

[1:02:32] just to receive word that she had passed
[1:02:35] away
[1:02:37] so um they they had the burial over
[1:02:41] there
[1:02:41] he's going to have some kind of a
[1:02:43] gathering of fellowship
[1:02:45] over here and we will of course
[1:02:48] do our best to support him and help him
[1:02:51] with that but we share
[1:02:53] our sympathies and
[1:02:56] the feeling in our heart when a loved
[1:02:59] one has passed on
[1:03:00] may god be with you strengthen comfort
[1:03:04] and heal all of you at this particular
[1:03:06] time
[1:03:08] thanks be the god may your prayers go
[1:03:12] out
[1:03:13] also for sister ismae
[1:03:16] uh pascal here she has some challenges
[1:03:20] that she is facing and with the
[1:03:23] counseling pastoral counseling as well
[1:03:27] as the help of the deacon or deacons
[1:03:31] god is helping her to work things out
[1:03:36] we also want to give praise and thanks
[1:03:38] to god
[1:03:40] for sister patsy's brother
[1:03:44] whom god has touched we certainly
[1:03:47] believe
[1:03:48] that prayer changes things we believe
[1:03:51] in the miraculous power of god
[1:03:55] the pentecostals have it one way but he
[1:03:58] does
[1:03:58] things as the bible says severally
[1:04:02] as he will
[1:04:05] not just what we think well he'll give
[1:04:07] you you know good
[1:04:09] for his good will right
[1:04:13] he'll give you his uh perfect will and
[1:04:16] so on
[1:04:17] but the fact is you got to come right
[1:04:20] down to
[1:04:20] his will his perfect will
[1:04:24] because you may want something and
[1:04:25] because god loves his children he might
[1:04:27] give them the candy that they want
[1:04:30] right another one may ask something and
[1:04:32] he may give it to them that doesn't mean
[1:04:34] that that's his perfect
[1:04:36] will because he's granting you all of
[1:04:38] those things but when you are
[1:04:41] willing to humble yourself surrender and
[1:04:44] whether you see
[1:04:45] one two or none no miracles
[1:04:49] no signs you are in the perfect will of
[1:04:53] god
[1:04:54] when he wills he'll send it
[1:04:58] if you call and call and you ask him for
[1:05:00] it you can have a whole lot
[1:05:03] but once i had the blessing now i have
[1:05:06] the lord
[1:05:07] it's not what a.b simpson's got that
[1:05:09] revelation
[1:05:10] said once i wanted healing
[1:05:14] now the healer i own
[1:05:18] in that wonderful praise god what what
[1:05:21] you prefer the product
[1:05:23] or the or the factory the owner of the
[1:05:25] factory
[1:05:27] which one so we thank god that we own
[1:05:30] the we have the owner we have the
[1:05:32] factory we have the ocean we have
[1:05:34] everything
[1:05:35] and when we need it then he supplies
[1:05:38] praise the lord but if you keep calling
[1:05:40] call and calling for it oh yeah he'll
[1:05:41] give you
[1:05:42] that's fine so brother branham said the
[1:05:44] same thing in the sense of if you want
[1:05:46] tongues oh
[1:05:47] sure he'll give you give you a whole lot
[1:05:49] of tongues he give you this he give you
[1:05:51] that
[1:05:52] but you're seeking for his perfect will
[1:05:56] i'm not going to take up your time but
[1:05:58] i'll get into the word of god
[1:06:00] we're going to talk about the
[1:06:03] bride at the judgment seat of christ
[1:06:06] amen praise the lord and that we'll read
[1:06:10] our scripture out of second corinthians
[1:06:13] chapter
[1:06:14] 5 verse 10 1 verse
[1:06:18] and then we'll make our comments on
[1:06:21] the word of god amen
[1:06:24] praise god hallelujah
[1:06:28] by the way is that clock back there
[1:06:31] okay all right
[1:06:35] 5 10 for we
[1:06:38] must all appear
[1:06:43] before the judgment seat
[1:06:47] of christ that
[1:06:50] everyone may receive
[1:06:53] the things done in his body
[1:06:58] according that he had done
[1:07:02] whether it be good or bad
[1:07:05] amen father we thank you for the
[1:07:08] reading of your word we pray that the
[1:07:11] great holy
[1:07:12] spirit will bless us together and
[1:07:15] lift us up we pray as we commit
[1:07:17] ourselves in their gracious keeping in
[1:07:19] jesus name
[1:07:20] amen god bless you please be seated
[1:07:24] wherever you are as we look into the
[1:07:26] word of god
[1:07:29] we want to continue and uh and complete
[1:07:32] if we can
[1:07:33] where we were last week we talked in
[1:07:36] uh the seventh seal book page uh of
[1:07:40] 460. where brother branham
[1:07:43] spoke that he was standing there and
[1:07:45] says while i'm standing here
[1:07:48] there are voices passing through this
[1:07:50] room do you believe that
[1:07:52] amen we know it now because
[1:07:55] uh radio television all kinds of the
[1:07:58] internet have
[1:07:59] captured that there's voices passing
[1:08:02] through the wavelengths in this
[1:08:04] atmosphere
[1:08:06] and uh and you can hear them
[1:08:10] praise god you'll have to turn on a
[1:08:11] computer a phone or something else but
[1:08:14] you can pick up those voices
[1:08:16] praise the lord of course a prophet
[1:08:18] didn't really need that to pick up those
[1:08:21] voices
[1:08:22] but the fact is there are voices
[1:08:25] passing through the room praise the lord
[1:08:28] and so
[1:08:29] um for for you to be able to pick up
[1:08:32] those voices
[1:08:34] i believe i quoted also out of the
[1:08:37] church age book
[1:08:38] where he said right now god is
[1:08:41] broadcasting
[1:08:43] amen hallelujah thank god he's a
[1:08:45] broadcaster
[1:08:47] anyway the word is going out
[1:08:50] amen but not everyone can pick it up
[1:08:54] you can hear the word red you can hear
[1:08:57] the word preached
[1:08:59] but not everyone will pick it up
[1:09:01] everyone in the crowd may
[1:09:03] hear with their ears right but
[1:09:06] you've got to have a crystal
[1:09:09] to pick it up if it's radio amen
[1:09:13] you got to have some kind of a computer
[1:09:16] chip
[1:09:16] in you to be able to translate and
[1:09:21] and and you know get that thing
[1:09:23] processed properly so you can
[1:09:26] understand what it is
[1:09:29] that's passing what it is you're really
[1:09:31] hearing
[1:09:32] praise god hallelujah so you see
[1:09:36] you can read the word of god you can
[1:09:38] read your bible
[1:09:40] and you can hear the word and still not
[1:09:43] hear the voice of god
[1:09:45] coming out of that word you see
[1:09:48] because one is the written word one is
[1:09:50] the spoken word
[1:09:51] and then one comes alive to the hearer
[1:09:55] whom the bible says he that hat and ear
[1:09:59] past tense when did he get that ear
[1:10:01] praise the lord
[1:10:02] he that hat and ear who eat it has an
[1:10:06] ear to hear let him or her here
[1:10:09] praise god so that ear was in you
[1:10:13] from before the foundation of the world
[1:10:16] that germ was in you before the
[1:10:19] foundation of the world
[1:10:21] he knew that there would be a people on
[1:10:23] the earth
[1:10:24] that had a crystal to pick up the word
[1:10:27] that he was going to send
[1:10:30] and now you are recognizing that you are
[1:10:33] one of those people because somehow
[1:10:36] no matter how like jacob you look like a
[1:10:39] trickster you look like a
[1:10:40] crook you look like a bad woman or a bad
[1:10:44] person everything else that's on the
[1:10:46] outside
[1:10:47] of you but thanks be to god you're
[1:10:50] starting to
[1:10:51] find out respective of how you seem or
[1:10:55] look or appear on the outside god
[1:10:58] looks in there and he sees one of his
[1:11:02] children
[1:11:03] he sees one of his saints praise
[1:11:06] god they must still be suffering
[1:11:09] from a bit of amnesia but the holy
[1:11:12] spirit is here to bring you back
[1:11:14] to recognize the day you're living in
[1:11:17] who your father is where you come from
[1:11:20] and where you're going back to
[1:11:23] glory to god hallelujah
[1:11:26] the jews were reading the same story the
[1:11:29] same scriptures
[1:11:31] that jesus was reading the apostles
[1:11:35] all of them were reading the same
[1:11:37] scripture
[1:11:38] but yet when jesus picked it up he used
[1:11:41] the same scripture
[1:11:42] and said not moses said this this and
[1:11:45] the way he would express
[1:11:47] it what what would reveal to them what
[1:11:50] was in their hearts
[1:11:51] and instead of being glad they got mad
[1:11:55] they got mad at was what was being
[1:11:59] expressed from the word of god
[1:12:02] but they did not hear the voice of god
[1:12:05] coming out of the word and the disciples
[1:12:09] even said master how is it
[1:12:12] that we we can hear we can understand
[1:12:16] what you're saying but the jews they
[1:12:18] can't understand it
[1:12:20] what you're saying and he said well you
[1:12:23] see unto you
[1:12:24] it's given to know
[1:12:28] and understand the mysteries of the
[1:12:30] kingdom of god
[1:12:31] but unto them it is not given
[1:12:34] so that ability is a gift that ability
[1:12:37] is grace
[1:12:38] that ability is god's choice being
[1:12:41] manifested
[1:12:43] amen from that you are no i am
[1:12:46] one of the few i am one of the few
[1:12:50] by god's grace i know i'm one of the few
[1:12:53] praise
[1:12:54] god hallelujah oh but i don't know the
[1:12:56] message i don't know this i don't know
[1:12:58] that
[1:12:58] god didn't ask you what you know he
[1:13:00] asked brother branham said
[1:13:02] do you believe
[1:13:05] he asks you what you believe not what
[1:13:07] you know praise
[1:13:08] god hallelujah glory to his name so
[1:13:12] i thank god for this and i give him
[1:13:15] glory
[1:13:16] praise god so the prophet spoke his
[1:13:18] message
[1:13:19] jesus spoke judas heard all the sermons
[1:13:23] and it didn't do him no good because he
[1:13:25] had no receptor
[1:13:27] praise god hallelujah amen now the
[1:13:30] prophet spoke the prophet brought his
[1:13:33] message we read the books we listen to
[1:13:36] all the tapes
[1:13:37] all day all night and everything else
[1:13:40] they hear the words
[1:13:41] they hear even brother branham's voice
[1:13:44] but they don't hear god's voice behind
[1:13:47] that voice
[1:13:49] amen praise god see because he don't
[1:13:51] have a receptor
[1:13:53] to be able to pick that up and recognize
[1:13:57] what it is they're hearing praise god
[1:14:01] glory to his wonderful name and without
[1:14:03] something inside of you to pick that up
[1:14:05] you'll perish
[1:14:07] no matter how religious outside you
[1:14:09] appear you may even
[1:14:10] appear so good better a good charitable
[1:14:14] a good
[1:14:15] person this and that that has nothing to
[1:14:18] do with it
[1:14:19] amen nothing to do with it the guy
[1:14:22] outside may be a renegade a god looks
[1:14:24] inside
[1:14:26] what's inside there and that's what he
[1:14:28] recognizes and that's what appeals to
[1:14:31] him
[1:14:32] praise god hallelujah amen
[1:14:36] yes sir so i'm glad that at least
[1:14:39] i have a part of that chinese
[1:14:44] laundry attack amen
[1:14:47] once he's finished washing my sins away
[1:14:50] and i got a piece and he's got the pace
[1:14:52] when that deep calls back to the deep
[1:14:55] and the two
[1:14:56] deeps meet amen he says oh
[1:14:59] when to omnipotence is meat he says
[1:15:02] something has got to give something's
[1:15:05] gotta take place
[1:15:07] when to omnipotence this meat and now
[1:15:10] the deep crawls
[1:15:11] back to the deep and the deep must
[1:15:14] respond
[1:15:15] why my sheep hear my voice
[1:15:19] praise god that statement takes on a lot
[1:15:21] more than just saying it
[1:15:23] my sheep hear my voice
[1:15:26] not hear my message not hear the prophet
[1:15:29] that's good you're hearing all that
[1:15:30] but do you hear his voice
[1:15:34] my god glory to his wonderful name let
[1:15:38] me tell you the bible become a new bible
[1:15:40] the message is a new message
[1:15:41] everything is exploding it's just
[1:15:44] opening up and
[1:15:45] praise god hallelujah i almost spoke in
[1:15:48] tongues there but
[1:15:49] anyway oh hallelujah
[1:15:54] amen yes sir i tell you
[1:15:58] my friends like i said the bride
[1:16:02] the world is now sitting at the very
[1:16:05] judgment seat of christ
[1:16:09] and if you don't know it the judgment
[1:16:12] seat of christ
[1:16:13] is the word revealed praise god
[1:16:17] hallelujah of course this is now
[1:16:20] revealing itself
[1:16:22] but then face to face amen praise god
[1:16:26] i'm not telling you
[1:16:27] it's happening now and it's not going to
[1:16:29] happen then i'm telling you it's
[1:16:30] starting to happen right now
[1:16:33] is that right for he that liveth and
[1:16:35] believeth in me
[1:16:37] shall not come into judgment
[1:16:40] what's he talking about you will not
[1:16:42] have to go to the white throne judgment
[1:16:45] which is judgment whether to heaven or
[1:16:48] hell or whatever
[1:16:49] that's judgment to hell praise god you
[1:16:52] you passed already why
[1:16:54] because you allow yourself to be judged
[1:16:57] by the word
[1:16:59] by christ you've come to the white drawn
[1:17:02] judgment
[1:17:03] and you right now praise god and you
[1:17:06] allow yourself to be
[1:17:08] judged by the word or when the word
[1:17:11] judges you you repent when the word
[1:17:14] points out something to you you didn't
[1:17:16] know or didn't see
[1:17:18] you repent amen remember
[1:17:21] satan fell from heaven praise god
[1:17:25] before the fall of man even started go
[1:17:28] to the scripture prayed
[1:17:31] do it before the fall you must
[1:17:33] understand and realize
[1:17:36] what is happening its pray did that in
[1:17:38] heaven and it's prayed for men to repent
[1:17:42] praise god hallelujah and turn to
[1:17:45] god forsake their sins ask for his
[1:17:48] forgiveness
[1:17:49] glory to god ask for his forgiveness my
[1:17:52] friends right there
[1:17:54] he is merciful willing and ready
[1:17:57] to give it to us praise the lord
[1:17:59] hallelujah
[1:18:00] amen whoa praise god so we are
[1:18:04] at the judgment seat of christ and your
[1:18:06] attitude to the word
[1:18:11] shows you exactly where you are just
[1:18:14] like the two thieves on the cross
[1:18:17] one goes this way and one goes that way
[1:18:20] both went to their inheritance
[1:18:23] well what was their inheritance one
[1:18:26] straight today you'll be with me in
[1:18:28] paradise
[1:18:29] and the other one goes to his
[1:18:30] inheritance on the other side
[1:18:33] so you are we sitting in here but we
[1:18:36] are positioning and placing ourselves
[1:18:39] by our attitude to the word
[1:18:43] of god you see we sit here
[1:18:47] and when we start to realize that not by
[1:18:50] wisdom
[1:18:52] not by our own understanding not by
[1:18:56] boasting how many years i've been in the
[1:18:58] message
[1:18:59] how many books i read how many tapes i
[1:19:01] read
[1:19:02] how many bibles i read oh
[1:19:05] if that was boasting then i will be able
[1:19:08] to really both
[1:19:09] then oh my goodness
[1:19:12] boxes of different bibles that i've uh
[1:19:15] given away and things like that
[1:19:17] different translations this that and the
[1:19:19] other
[1:19:20] but that's not even it that's not
[1:19:23] it my friends not by all that paul
[1:19:26] himself could tell you
[1:19:28] and paul knew and being the wisest man
[1:19:31] of his day not by works of righteousness
[1:19:36] which we have done amen but let me tell
[1:19:39] you
[1:19:40] mercy and grace
[1:19:43] reveals the word of god to you
[1:19:47] and that is what saves you from the
[1:19:49] judgment the white trump
[1:19:51] judgment your attitude to that word
[1:19:56] and the opening of your ears
[1:20:00] and eyes and understanding
[1:20:04] is what saves you praise the lord
[1:20:07] grace and mercy praise god
[1:20:10] hallelujah so of course we can sit here
[1:20:12] and not hear the revelation
[1:20:14] you hear the word of god and uh
[1:20:18] you don't hear the revelation and thus
[1:20:21] your hearing becomes your judgment
[1:20:24] right there your hearing becomes
[1:20:27] your judgment instead of mercy so you
[1:20:30] see there
[1:20:31] goes the twins there goes the two people
[1:20:33] again one set
[1:20:35] everybody's listening but to one it's
[1:20:38] mercy and grace and to the other one
[1:20:40] judgment
[1:20:42] because the one isn't doing anything to
[1:20:44] receive it
[1:20:45] it's just coming because god like he did
[1:20:48] to abraham didn't
[1:20:49] say abraham i know this you're a good
[1:20:50] man that's why i came to you
[1:20:53] first in ur of the childish no
[1:20:55] unconditionally
[1:20:56] god saw his seed his life in him
[1:21:00] when god came to him nothing abraham had
[1:21:03] to do
[1:21:03] no learning no wisdom no nothing but
[1:21:06] i have trouble i'm the one tell you get
[1:21:09] up and go out
[1:21:10] i am the one praise god unconditional
[1:21:14] covenant by the opening of the word of
[1:21:17] god
[1:21:18] you and i are seeds of abraham
[1:21:21] we have the royal seed we got the same
[1:21:24] attitude amen
[1:21:25] we're going out anyway oh but you don't
[1:21:29] know where you're going where is this
[1:21:30] heaven
[1:21:31] is it up there is it down there is it
[1:21:33] crossed there where is this
[1:21:35] some secret valley some part of the
[1:21:37] world is is a shangri-la is a little
[1:21:39] island somewhere
[1:21:40] no we don't care where it is because
[1:21:43] heaven is where
[1:21:45] jesus is anyway glory to god
[1:21:48] hallelujah amen paul said
[1:21:53] what is not of faith
[1:21:56] revelation is sin you see
[1:22:00] what is not a face is
[1:22:04] so you missed it already because uh
[1:22:08] not again you use another scripture he
[1:22:10] said and
[1:22:11] they they they run into trouble because
[1:22:15] they're not being mixed with faith right
[1:22:18] what they're receiving is not mixed with
[1:22:21] faith
[1:22:22] they don't have any revelation with it
[1:22:24] all they got to do
[1:22:25] all they have is knowledge all they have
[1:22:27] is intellectuals
[1:22:29] might be religious intellectuals but as
[1:22:31] intellectuals anyway
[1:22:32] praise god praise god hallelujah oh my
[1:22:36] there's a lot of
[1:22:37] doctors of divinity of this message now
[1:22:40] you know so many years later we end up
[1:22:43] having lots of doctors and divinities of
[1:22:45] the message
[1:22:46] they may not call themselves that but
[1:22:48] the way they are you know they can
[1:22:51] absolutely
[1:22:52] tell here praise the lord oh my praise
[1:22:55] god
[1:22:56] you sit here you hear the literal voice
[1:22:58] of god speaking out of the message
[1:23:00] that's the mercy of god to you amen
[1:23:04] that is the mercy of god being shed
[1:23:06] abroad
[1:23:07] in our hearts didn't he say
[1:23:10] two will be in a field gospel field
[1:23:14] one shall be taken and the other one
[1:23:18] left mercy and judgment
[1:23:21] right there two in a field
[1:23:25] one taken one left
[1:23:28] husband and wife two in a bed
[1:23:31] one taken one left praise god
[1:23:36] the summit will bring them joy but the
[1:23:39] others
[1:23:40] sorrow despair when our lord and glory
[1:23:44] comes
[1:23:45] he has come seven seals oh my will
[1:23:48] meet him in the air oh thanks be the god
[1:23:51] hallelujah
[1:23:53] amen this word sets one free
[1:23:56] and the other one it mixes up and binds
[1:23:58] and ties them
[1:23:59] up in every possible way it's beyond
[1:24:02] human
[1:24:03] understanding it's beyond any humanity
[1:24:07] praise god forevermore i give him all
[1:24:10] the glory
[1:24:11] and all the praise for everything
[1:24:15] that our lord jesus has done
[1:24:19] oh my think about this question and
[1:24:22] answers on the seals
[1:24:24] page 468 now you say
[1:24:27] you can't say those things it's
[1:24:30] best to leave it alone you remember the
[1:24:34] third poll
[1:24:36] you remember what it was don't tell
[1:24:39] anybody
[1:24:40] what did it say how many remembers
[1:24:44] that i remember standing there
[1:24:47] trying to last that eyelet in that
[1:24:50] little pair
[1:24:51] of shoes of course shoulders walk
[1:24:54] walking and
[1:24:55] all that and the islet speaks of the
[1:24:57] eyes amen
[1:24:59] praise the lord or in the vision and he
[1:25:02] said

[1:25:07] pentecostal babies supernatural
[1:25:10] things praise the lord oh my
[1:25:14] i said this will be the third poll
[1:25:17] i said it will not be known
[1:25:20] so help me by the grace of god
[1:25:24] but now we are right at the end time
[1:25:28] and it won't be too long until
[1:25:32] what is a mercy seat will become a
[1:25:35] judgment seat amen the whole thing
[1:25:38] starts to change
[1:25:40] from mercy to judgment after his people
[1:25:43] are receiving the lord and when the last
[1:25:46] one goes out
[1:25:47] that mercy changes to a judgment seat
[1:25:50] amen
[1:25:51] there's nothing left but judgment my
[1:25:53] brothers and sisters
[1:25:55] oh pray right now
[1:25:58] and ask god to bring our loved ones in

[1:26:18] guess their last breath they show god
[1:26:21] and there's repentance in that
[1:26:24] hallelujah
[1:26:25] there's change in that transformation in
[1:26:28] that
[1:26:29] all the thief had to say was lord
[1:26:32] one word remember to me
[1:26:36] that it was over he's born again he's
[1:26:39] saved
[1:26:40] from all his sins for all them years he

[1:28:01] mercy and judgment standing by the angel
[1:28:05] of the lord

[1:28:08] and screaming
[1:28:09] oh that's not it that
[1:28:14] it scares you to death nearly see

[1:29:32] but one of these days if we meet again
[1:29:35] on this earth
[1:29:36] we're going to meet see we're going to
[1:29:40] meet
[1:29:43] seat where are you going to meet round
[1:29:45] the world
[1:29:46] at the judgment seat the judgment seat
[1:29:49] of jesus christ glory to his marvelous
[1:29:52] and wonderful name glory to god
[1:29:55] hallelujah
[1:29:56] aren't you glad that you're one of them
[1:29:59] praise god think about it that we are
[1:30:03] hearing jesus christ himself speaking to
[1:30:06] us
[1:30:07] in this hour you see you go back and see
[1:30:11] how god's word is so
[1:30:13] wise who could have thought that when
[1:30:16] he talks about the coming of jesus
[1:30:19] christ
[1:30:20] and how he's going to come on the earth
[1:30:21] by the seventh seal
[1:30:23] and then when he comes he will open up
[1:30:27] or expose or show to the world
[1:30:31] or manifest to the world or interpret to
[1:30:33] the world
[1:30:34] what is that seventh seal you
[1:30:37] you know i when the message first came
[1:30:40] and i'm reading those things
[1:30:41] you are thinking that the lord is gonna
[1:30:44] come down
[1:30:45] and it's just the lord you weren't
[1:30:47] thinking that i am a part of that
[1:30:50] i'm in him and that's just the head
[1:30:53] coming
[1:30:53] down to identify his body
[1:30:56] he's just coming down and now it's the
[1:31:00] sec it's the coming of christ but in the
[1:31:03] bride for
[1:31:05] that was the mystery and is the mystery
[1:31:08] that was hid through the ages the jews
[1:31:11] didn't know
[1:31:12] nothing about it it was revealed to none
[1:31:15] of them
[1:31:16] for if the princes of this world knew
[1:31:18] they would not have crucified him so
[1:31:20] that the bride will be separated from
[1:31:22] him
[1:31:23] and adam and eve but yet god called them
[1:31:26] adam
[1:31:27] amen the the real body and the head
[1:31:31] together
[1:31:32] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:31:36] and forever glory to god in that day
[1:31:39] you'll know i
[1:31:40] am in the father the father in me and i
[1:31:43] in you and the two was one
[1:31:47] for the twain shall be one flesh
[1:31:50] praise peter god hallelujah
[1:31:54] so through the prophet is telling us
[1:31:58] that he's here to identify his bride
[1:32:01] identify his people his own
[1:32:04] this secret and to reveal the secrets of
[1:32:08] whose
[1:32:09] name was on the book
[1:32:12] is that right by this opening of the
[1:32:16] word
[1:32:16] it identifies whose name was on the book
[1:32:20] for if your name is in the book he's
[1:32:22] going to call your name
[1:32:25] i remember back there in the old days
[1:32:27] that teacher will get up
[1:32:29] early in the morning before classes
[1:32:30] start and and say
[1:32:33] you know a bell white present
[1:32:37] oh my god danny mazzilli oh present
[1:32:41] lord of god and call another name glory
[1:32:44] to god
[1:32:45] and a person jump up and raise their
[1:32:47] hand to identify
[1:32:49] that they are present they are one lord
[1:32:52] of god
[1:32:53] no wonder you're shouting hallelujah
[1:32:55] when the word of god is preached
[1:32:56] because you recognize in the word
[1:32:59] yourself
[1:33:00] is in the word sometimes you're happy
[1:33:03] you don't even know why you're happy
[1:33:05] but but something is registering in here
[1:33:08] there's something hitting that there's
[1:33:10] the spoon the sound
[1:33:12] oh my they got a sounding fork in you
[1:33:16] and when that sound of the gospel
[1:33:18] strikes on him
[1:33:19] oh my lord of god something responds
[1:33:24] your answer to your name he said of
[1:33:26] course that name is not
[1:33:28] jim james or or lee vale or whatever
[1:33:31] but what that the spirit is saying
[1:33:34] from the word you know and i believe
[1:33:37] that
[1:33:37] is exactly that part of the word that
[1:33:39] you are he deliberately makes that
[1:33:42] preacher start to talk about that
[1:33:44] and and immediately there's a response
[1:33:46] within your soul
[1:33:48] because it's you he's talking about
[1:33:50] you'll always think the preacher is
[1:33:51] talking about you
[1:33:53] amen and he is but not knowingly
[1:33:57] unless god would reveal something to him
[1:34:01] that would be the holy spirit you know
[1:34:03] um
[1:34:04] i used to have that problem
[1:34:07] where the holy spirit would reveal
[1:34:10] things but that's
[1:34:11] in the message but the early part still
[1:34:14] under that anointing you know
[1:34:17] pentecostal anointing you may want to
[1:34:19] call it
[1:34:19] where you you'll tell a brother
[1:34:22] something and
[1:34:23] you know and oh
[1:34:26] no that wasn't god that was just you
[1:34:29] you just telling me i said no brother
[1:34:33] that that just wasn't me i wasn't even
[1:34:35] thinking that
[1:34:36] i just you know just came out of me like
[1:34:39] that
[1:34:40] and i just told you right praise god
[1:34:43] hallelujah said well you know in one
[1:34:45] case the person came with a dream
[1:34:47] and you know and what's the meaning of
[1:34:49] this dream and whatnot
[1:34:51] so i said just leave it alone the
[1:34:53] manifestation will be in the
[1:34:55] interpretation
[1:34:57] and it just happened that maybe uh
[1:35:00] months later the brother rose up in the
[1:35:04] church while i'm preaching
[1:35:06] because he thinks that i am talking
[1:35:09] about something happen
[1:35:10] in his house which and i wasn't there
[1:35:14] but the holy spirit is doing it and
[1:35:16] revealing it
[1:35:17] and he got mad and he got up and you
[1:35:20] know
[1:35:20] right in the service while it's going on
[1:35:23] and
[1:35:23] trumping out to grab his wife and he's
[1:35:26] trumping out and everything else
[1:35:27] and while he's going out they said
[1:35:28] brother you remember your dream
[1:35:31] and in the dream you were fighting and
[1:35:33] arguing with somebody
[1:35:35] and you couldn't see who it was and
[1:35:38] everything else i said you're doing it
[1:35:40] right now
[1:35:41] you just you see you just don't
[1:35:44] recognize it that's why i tell you
[1:35:46] left leave it alone the manifestation
[1:35:49] will be the interpretation
[1:35:51] and it's happening right now praise god
[1:35:55] well i'm saying that just to let you
[1:35:58] know
[1:35:58] that is what it is we are
[1:36:02] manifesting the word of the hour and
[1:36:05] proving my friends
[1:36:06] this is not a dream that we are in
[1:36:10] we are now living in a reality
[1:36:13] praise god we're walking in the light
[1:36:16] of the day praise god her name
[1:36:20] is on the book as i said amen
[1:36:24] and when the eternal word jesus christ
[1:36:28] calls out to the other
[1:36:32] part of the eternal word
[1:36:35] amen oh my like the written call
[1:36:38] the unwritten calling to the written
[1:36:40] like the
[1:36:41] unseen calling to see right
[1:36:44] the the one must respond to the other
[1:36:48] one
[1:36:48] but in actual fact because in actual
[1:36:50] fact they are the same
[1:36:54] you can't see where one is joined or the
[1:36:56] other one ends
[1:36:58] because they are the same
[1:37:02] so she is him revealed
[1:37:06] brother branham said christ is revealed
[1:37:09] in his own word
[1:37:13] and he only reveals himself in his
[1:37:16] chosen people his chosen word
[1:37:18] for that day and for that hour
[1:37:21] oh praise god so she finds out if he
[1:37:25] is doing that revealing himself through
[1:37:27] her
[1:37:28] then it identifies her to herself
[1:37:32] and she finds out that she is him
[1:37:36] that eternal word now
[1:37:39] being revealed in time through
[1:37:43] and by her and that her walking and
[1:37:46] living
[1:37:47] is the living interpretation of
[1:37:50] a living bible living epistles being
[1:37:54] made known to all men
[1:37:57] praise god recognizing the word
[1:38:00] hallelujah amen because my friends
[1:38:06] she recognized that she has heard his
[1:38:08] voice
[1:38:10] she became aware of his call
[1:38:14] she felt his touch glory to god
[1:38:17] hallelujah
[1:38:18] she had an invisible yonyan i don't know

[1:38:23] an invisible union christ

[1:38:39] father's house

[1:38:43] done all that you can praise god

[1:41:42] once they're called out
[1:41:43] and they're all sum total together
[1:41:46] that's why it says in
[1:41:47] him was the fullness of the godhead
[1:41:51] how bodily part of that
[1:41:54] was in bodies human bodies right
[1:41:58] and he he totaled up he's the sum total
[1:42:02] of it we just chips and pieces of
[1:42:05] it praise the name of the lord we he
[1:42:07] made us into
[1:42:08] nice diamond needles so that when we we
[1:42:12] we go down when we touch the word the
[1:42:14] word starts speaking to us through that
[1:42:16] needle
[1:42:17] well because we built with that needle
[1:42:19] within us
[1:42:20] lord of god hallelujah so here it is

[1:42:39] amen now you see that's what the
[1:42:43] seven angels represented
[1:42:46] the seven churches are completed why
[1:42:49] they were going back
[1:42:50] the seven churches is over amen
[1:42:53] and these seven angels that came down
[1:42:57] they uh represented those seven
[1:43:01] church ages and we couldn't see it they
[1:43:04] did that took the picture not us
[1:43:08] they're here standing there supreme
[1:43:10] judge
[1:43:11] showing he is alpha
[1:43:14] and omega he
[1:43:19] and he is the body he
[1:43:22] is the first created
[1:43:25] manifested and he is also the last
[1:43:30] he is bride and bridegroom
[1:43:34] amen praise the name of the lord the
[1:43:37] beginning and the
[1:43:38] end oh what an identification that is
[1:43:44] do you realize that quickening power
[1:43:49] what that did and is doing for us
[1:43:53] quickening power is what us
[1:43:56] lets us see his coming
[1:44:01] is that right quickening power
[1:44:04] snatched you and i
[1:44:08] away from death into life
[1:44:12] quickening power is what gives you
[1:44:14] discernment right now
[1:44:16] to know what is wrong amen and
[1:44:20] what to do and what you have done and
[1:44:23] what you are
[1:44:23] not to have done quickening power does
[1:44:26] that
[1:44:26] what you should have done and what you
[1:44:29] will be
[1:44:30] quickening power does all of these
[1:44:32] things praise the name of the lord
[1:44:35] oh my our lord jesus
[1:44:39] was so full of quickening power he was
[1:44:43] all of it together he was so
[1:44:46] full of that quickening power he said
[1:44:49] destroy
[1:44:50] this body and i'll raise it up
[1:44:53] in three days talk about confidence in
[1:44:56] the quickening power
[1:44:58] destroy this body destroy
[1:45:02] this temple and i'll raise it
[1:45:06] up in three days oh my
[1:45:10] why why did he say that
[1:45:13] he knew that it was written of him it
[1:45:16] was written of him by the word of god
[1:45:18] which could not fail
[1:45:20] the word said it see he know the
[1:45:23] quickening power would raise him up
[1:45:25] and not one of his cells could become
[1:45:29] corrupt
[1:45:31] is that right do you believe it
[1:45:34] oh my praise god he said destroy the
[1:45:39] temple i'll bring it back again
[1:45:42] why that was prophecy
[1:45:47] not right then just the the resurrection
[1:45:50] back then
[1:45:52] but the prophet is saying here now that
[1:45:55] was
[1:45:55] prophecy the word of god
[1:45:59] and it's prophecy if it's true the word
[1:46:02] of god cannot fail
[1:46:04] and this that same prophecy and
[1:46:07] word of god that he said he
[1:46:10] would raise up says that we are already
[1:46:15] raised up
[1:46:16] you see how he made that change right
[1:46:18] quickly there that you are that word
[1:46:20] that he said he would raise up
[1:46:21] and he has raised us up right now he
[1:46:23] said you are raised up right now
[1:46:26] you're raised up by the power and the
[1:46:28] quickening power
[1:46:29] of the living god and the spirit that is
[1:46:32] now
[1:46:33] in us was in him now in us
[1:46:36] and it is now quickening our mortal
[1:46:40] bodies praise the name of the lord you
[1:46:43] realize that you got the vibrations of
[1:46:45] the rapture in you right now
[1:46:47] you know this is vibrations keeping all
[1:46:49] these things together that we can see
[1:46:51] by the word of god everything consists
[1:46:53] amen hallelujah
[1:46:55] the rapture is now in progress
[1:46:58] you don't realize it but you are
[1:47:01] on a different octave and you are
[1:47:04] vibrating to a different level that they
[1:47:07] know nothing about
[1:47:09] you don't feel nothing i'm not telling
[1:47:10] you to feel anything you don't have to
[1:47:12] feel nothing but it's happening whether
[1:47:14] you feel that you don't feel it
[1:47:15] god's holy spirit is doing it brother
[1:47:18] sister
[1:47:19] being quickened by the power of god
[1:47:21] hallelujah
[1:47:22] blessed be the holy blessed name
[1:47:26] of the living god oh my yes sir
[1:47:29] so we see friends that the seventh seal
[1:47:32] actually speak uh of our way
[1:47:36] spoken of way back in the book of
[1:47:39] genesis
[1:47:42] and it was spoken of as the seed of the
[1:47:44] woman
[1:47:46] christ the word praise
[1:47:49] god and when it was spoken uh
[1:47:52] one and one made two is not what we say
[1:47:56] one and one makes two but god
[1:48:00] in genesis said no that's okay for you
[1:48:03] naturally
[1:48:05] but adam and eve makes adam
[1:48:09] one on one doesn't make two one and one
[1:48:13] is still one is that right
[1:48:16] if you want to go to the electroluxe way
[1:48:19] right
[1:48:19] praise god see no systems that satan set
[1:48:23] up
[1:48:23] it will be that way if you want to exist
[1:48:25] in this system
[1:48:26] that's the way you got to add it up for
[1:48:28] them but according to the word of god
[1:48:31] one and one is still one
[1:48:34] eve and adam together is adam
[1:48:37] praise the name of the living god
[1:48:40] hallelujah
[1:48:42] so that's him and us making up the
[1:48:45] fullness
[1:48:46] of the word of god the
[1:48:50] fullness of the eternal word not just
[1:48:53] this written word
[1:48:54] but the eternal word we make up
[1:48:57] of the fullness of that eternal
[1:49:00] word of god hallelujah amen
[1:49:04] and so that's why only he could
[1:49:06] interpret
[1:49:08] himself right
[1:49:12] and he is the eternal word so who else
[1:49:14] could interpret you
[1:49:16] who could understand the word of god
[1:49:19] for the hour we were so well hidden
[1:49:22] praise god that he had to make himself
[1:49:26] clear and known to us amen
[1:49:30] hallelujah so this seventh seal if you
[1:49:33] can clearly see it now
[1:49:35] uh reveals christ that he was those
[1:49:38] seals
[1:49:39] and that now it reveals us the bride
[1:49:43] that we are the last seal that
[1:49:46] whose flesh he hides behind right
[1:49:49] because uh
[1:49:50] they're you know when they they pierce
[1:49:53] them in the side
[1:49:54] of course the the the bride for the
[1:49:57] church ages all the churches just came
[1:49:59] out
[1:50:00] and now um he is hidden behind
[1:50:03] our skin veil oh my i'm just going to
[1:50:06] have to
[1:50:06] stay here because my mind is going into
[1:50:08] unveiling of the mighty god the badger
[1:50:10] skins and so on and so on and so on
[1:50:12] because that's what he's done we are the
[1:50:15] seal
[1:50:17] for him and he's hiding behind
[1:50:20] our veil his mass behind our veil well
[1:50:24] it's got no color of the skin whether
[1:50:26] it's black badger or whether it's
[1:50:28] a goater sheep or whatever he's hiding
[1:50:32] behind that veil
[1:50:34] and he uses whoever he wills whenever
[1:50:37] he wills glory to god hallelujah amen
[1:50:40] i'm gonna wind this up now
[1:50:43] praise god hallelujah so friends
[1:50:46] we know that after uh i'm jumping over
[1:50:49] stuff here
[1:50:50] but after this six seals was
[1:50:53] over because that's history there was
[1:50:55] nothing else to be said
[1:50:57] because all the word all the written
[1:51:00] word
[1:51:00] was already made known under those six
[1:51:03] seals
[1:51:04] all the written word all the history all
[1:51:07] the human knowledge that you can get
[1:51:10] amen the the fault that not the
[1:51:12] politicians the
[1:51:14] um theologians could follow that
[1:51:17] as far as the sixth but when it get to
[1:51:20] the seventh now
[1:51:21] unwritten unwritten
[1:51:24] unspoken word amen it's just there
[1:51:28] praise god you can't enter into that
[1:51:31] holy of holies
[1:51:32] unless you are a king and priest to god
[1:51:35] unless you are invited
[1:51:37] in unless you are invited him to go and
[1:51:40] bring your sacrifice your offering
[1:51:43] of course that sacrifice is a living
[1:51:45] sacrifice which is yourself
[1:51:46] amen which you offer to him a living
[1:51:49] sacrifice
[1:51:51] which is your your service praise god
[1:51:54] that the only service you could give to
[1:51:56] him is to offer yourself
[1:51:59] not to wait till you're dead but you're
[1:52:01] alive and you are
[1:52:02] living sacrifice giving yourself over to
[1:52:05] him
[1:52:06] completely amen hallelujah
[1:52:09] so the prophet had to wait for christ
[1:52:12] revelation 10 1 to come to him
[1:52:15] revelation 10
[1:52:16] 7 to fulfill the unwritten word
[1:52:21] to fulfill all of that and reveal
[1:52:25] his own word to us
[1:52:28] amen oh hallelujah
[1:52:31] revelation 2 of course he that hasn't
[1:52:33] here to hear
[1:52:34] let him hear what the spirit said
[1:52:37] praise god amen yes sir
[1:52:40] oh my praise god i tell you friends when
[1:52:44] he speaks the word
[1:52:46] reveals to us the revelation of whom he
[1:52:49] is
[1:52:50] and it also brings about the separation
[1:52:53] just as how god separated eve from adam
[1:52:57] and yet they were one
[1:52:58] it's making you know your identification
[1:53:01] but yet you are one
[1:53:02] with him praise the name of the lord
[1:53:05] glory to god
[1:53:06] amen some have ears to hear and some
[1:53:09] don't have
[1:53:10] ears some can hear this and some can't
[1:53:12] hear it
[1:53:13] some can listen and follow it up to the
[1:53:15] sixth seal
[1:53:17] man can they ever explain those six
[1:53:19] seals
[1:53:20] all the vials all the wine all the
[1:53:23] oil all the judgments all the
[1:53:25] persecution they can do
[1:53:27] all right there up but they don't know
[1:53:30] him the seventh seal
[1:53:34] and you know they don't know him because
[1:53:38] they can't
[1:53:39] unveil that part they can't unveil it
[1:53:43] because to unveil it is to unveil
[1:53:45] yourself
[1:53:46] is to reveal yourself praise the lord
[1:53:49] hallelujah in that marvelous and
[1:53:52] wonderful
[1:53:53] i know i'm starting to repeat myself and
[1:53:56] that's let me know i'm coming to
[1:53:58] end of what i'm have to say praise god
[1:54:01] hallelujah uh to recap it identifies
[1:54:04] christ and because we are part of him
[1:54:08] it also identifies the bride
[1:54:12] he is the seventh seal she is a bride of
[1:54:15] the seventh seal
[1:54:17] she is part of that seventh seal amen
[1:54:20] she is revealing him in this hour in
[1:54:23] this
[1:54:24] seventh age we thank god for it and we
[1:54:27] give him the praise
[1:54:29] the honor and the glory
[1:54:32] so as this word identifies christ it
[1:54:35] also
[1:54:36] exposes the
[1:54:39] antichrist spirit working
[1:54:43] through the very message
[1:54:46] that we claim to believe do you believe
[1:54:49] that
[1:54:50] where else is it going to go it went
[1:54:53] right into heaven in the presence of god
[1:54:56] and began trying to make mayhem and
[1:55:00] confusion there so where do you think
[1:55:02] it's going to go here today is going
[1:55:04] into the highest places can possibly go
[1:55:07] and that is to sit in the message and
[1:55:10] all they can do is
[1:55:11] mystify and get your mind up caught up
[1:55:15] with all those six
[1:55:17] but and they can even they can even talk
[1:55:19] about the seventh seal they can make it
[1:55:21] sound great
[1:55:22] but it once you experience that i can't
[1:55:24] explain that to you but once you
[1:55:26] experience
[1:55:27] that unveiling itself to you doesn't
[1:55:30] matter who it is they're going to walk
[1:55:33] right in the presence
[1:55:34] of the word test because
[1:55:38] god proved this word and now the word
[1:55:41] turns around and tests
[1:55:42] anything and everything that comes in
[1:55:44] the spread not judging but
[1:55:46] testing praise the lord anything that
[1:55:48] comes
[1:55:49] in the presence of god hallelujah amen
[1:55:53] so thank god that only god can send his
[1:55:56] word in the middle of a sinful
[1:55:58] corrupt generation right straight to his
[1:56:02] bride
[1:56:03] and they will come out of it and he's
[1:56:06] proving like how jesus came out of the
[1:56:08] grave and out of death
[1:56:10] only they can overcome this age
[1:56:14] no ordinary person by human
[1:56:17] instrumentality
[1:56:18] or even with satanic wisdom cannot
[1:56:21] overcome
[1:56:22] this sinful and evil age
[1:56:26] praise the lord amen praise god may god
[1:56:29] bless every one of you here
[1:56:32] this afternoon and i want to end by
[1:56:35] saying
[1:56:36] no matter your mistakes friends
[1:56:38] hallelujah
[1:56:40] because we're still in human bodies
[1:56:44] so never mind of all the perfection all
[1:56:46] the glorious marvelous things have
[1:56:48] talked about
[1:56:49] you still subject to mistakes

[1:56:59] oh that guy is doing this that woman is
[1:57:01] doing that that woman is doing that
[1:57:03] right in front of your eyes you may be
[1:57:05] even seeing it
[1:57:07] but i might put it this way don't even
[1:57:08] believe you naturalize believe the word
[1:57:10] of god
[1:57:11] that's been revealed to you amen
[1:57:15] listen i'm saying it because i've seen
[1:57:19] preaching the word of god while i'm just
[1:57:21] 14 years old
[1:57:23] and i've seen prostitutes lean out to
[1:57:25] the windows
[1:57:27] listen to the world and their lives
[1:57:29] changed
[1:57:30] i've seen those fishermen that are
[1:57:32] cursed words and
[1:57:34] carry on and everything else go down
[1:57:36] amongst them preach the word of course
[1:57:39] people calling me all kind of name what
[1:57:40] kind of preacher is that
[1:57:41] going among people like that and
[1:57:45] see those guys lives changed
[1:57:48] raise their families next thing you know
[1:57:50] they're going to church
[1:57:52] their lives completely change so don't
[1:57:54] look at your
[1:57:55] outward mistakes i'm not saying go out
[1:57:57] there and make mistakes
[1:57:59] or or just be relaxed because you're
[1:58:02] making mistakes you will want to cry out
[1:58:03] to god
[1:58:04] but the fact is don't let the devil use
[1:58:07] those
[1:58:08] outward things to throw you off the word
[1:58:12] don't get knocked down
[1:58:15] no matter where you are and who you are
[1:58:17] don't become discouraged
[1:58:20] praise god because his grace and mercy
[1:58:24] will see you true because you are
[1:58:27] already
[1:58:29] predestinated to stand
[1:58:31] no matter what comes against you you've
[1:58:34] been predestinated
[1:58:36] to stand predestinated to hear his voice
[1:58:39] and to answer his call
[1:58:42] you're predestinated for this hour
[1:58:45] you are the ones chosen to meet the
[1:58:47] challenge of this
[1:58:48] hour and to overcome it for the glory
[1:58:52] and praise of the living god stand and
[1:58:55] testify of his deliverance of this
[1:58:58] mighty hand
[1:58:59] within your lives let me let me close
[1:59:02] with this
[1:59:03] last reference here just like the
[1:59:07] three wise men of old the bible said
[1:59:11] they brought to him
[1:59:13] gifts and they gave him brother branham
[1:59:16] call it appropriate gifts
[1:59:18] he said why because it made
[1:59:21] you can see that they had a revelation
[1:59:25] they didn't just give because they were
[1:59:28] kings and they're wealthy and they got
[1:59:29] gifts
[1:59:31] but they give by revelation
[1:59:34] one give more he already revealed that
[1:59:38] he had a revelation that this messiah
[1:59:40] gonna die
[1:59:41] for the sins of the world one bring gold
[1:59:44] showing that he was king royalty and so
[1:59:48] on
[1:59:48] franken says that he was the high priest
[1:59:53] amen so their their gifts had
[1:59:56] a revelation behind it so i'm
[1:59:59] by saying won't you give him
[2:00:03] your lives as you are the wise men and
[2:00:07] women of today
[2:00:10] offering your life
[2:00:14] and let him take your life and receive
[2:00:16] it
[2:00:17] as our gift to him
[2:00:22] we're giving back to him what he has
[2:00:26] but we want to show him our love our
[2:00:29] appreciation
[2:00:31] and our worship for him not just
[2:00:34] by human understanding but by
[2:00:38] revelation we are worshiping him
[2:00:41] and giving him glory honor and praise
[2:00:44] may god bless every one of you here
[2:00:45] today
[2:00:46] and i trust the word of god will find
[2:00:49] its
[2:00:49] deep roots with you because this tree of
[2:00:53] life is a tree with deep roots
