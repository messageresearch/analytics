[28:21] let's read the scriptures
[28:26] at the same time
[28:28] came the disciples
[28:31] onto jesus saying
[28:33] who is the greatest in the kingdom of
[28:35] heaven
[28:37] and jesus called a little child unto him
[28:41] and set him in the midst of them
[28:44] and said
[28:45] verily
[28:46] i say unto you
[28:48] except you
[28:50] be converted and
[28:52] and become as little children you shall
[28:57] not enter into the kingdom of heaven
[29:02] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[29:05] as this little child
[29:07] the same is the greatest in the kingdom
[29:10] of heaven and whoso shall receive one
[29:13] such little child in my name
[29:16] receiveth me praise god
[29:19] gracious father we thank you for this
[29:21] reading of your word
[29:23] we pray father that you will just bless
[29:25] your children
[29:27] and sow your seed in the good ground
[29:31] that you may be glorified as it comes
[29:34] bringing forth fruit to the glory of
[29:36] your name amen god bless you all please
[29:39] be seated
[29:44] hallelujah
[29:46] amen
[29:48] now there's an old
[29:50] old song maybe you'll help me with that
[29:52] that we used to love to sing
[29:55] to be like jesus
[29:57] how many remembers that one
[29:59] let's see if we can sing that and give
[30:01] him glory to
[30:03] be like jesus
[30:08] to
[30:09] be like jesus
[30:13] on earth i long
[30:17] to
[30:18] be
[30:20] like him all through life's journey all
[30:24] through lies
[30:28] from earth to glory earth to
[30:32] glory
[30:36] i
[30:37] only asked
[30:40] to
[30:41] be
[30:43] like
[30:44] him
[30:45] i believe that's the desire of every
[30:47] christian
[30:48] i believe that's the desire of every
[30:51] sincere heart that wants to please god
[30:55] and bring glory to his great an
[30:57] honorable and wonderful
[31:00] name
[31:01] now in the bible in the days of israel
[31:05] as you know
[31:06] god gave israel the law
[31:10] and they were to keep the law
[31:13] and they were punishments if you did not
[31:16] keep the law
[31:18] and from that
[31:20] god's intention was
[31:23] that israel
[31:25] was trying to keep the law
[31:27] and will soon find
[31:29] that they really could not keep it
[31:32] they would find they really couldn't
[31:34] keep it
[31:35] uh and then if they didn't keep it of
[31:38] course you saw the effects of it they
[31:40] drifted in tradition traditionalism
[31:44] they drifted into forms they drifted
[31:46] into religious systems of worship
[31:49] they drifted off into ceremonies and all
[31:52] kinds of different things uh once god
[31:55] gave them priests they ended up with
[31:57] rabbis
[31:58] god give them the tabernacle they ended
[32:00] up with synagogues
[32:02] their god give them the old testament
[32:04] they end up with the old talmud and and
[32:07] so on they drifted away from their
[32:10] original foundation
[32:14] god but god wanted them really
[32:17] uh he deliberately put it that way that
[32:20] they will come back to him and say lord
[32:23] we tried to keep the law but we we just
[32:26] can't keep the law uh we want to keep it
[32:30] and then he will step in with his great
[32:32] love
[32:33] and his grace and his mercy praise the
[32:37] lord
[32:38] and
[32:39] then he will bring into them grace
[32:43] amen
[32:44] hallelujah and we know now god
[32:48] uh we're not on the law we are under
[32:50] grace
[32:51] how many can say that
[32:53] i said we are not on the law we are now
[32:56] under grace
[32:58] now but still though we are under grace
[33:02] god has given us his word
[33:06] and we try to live the word how many
[33:09] tries to live it at least you're going
[33:11] to try it now you may stumble you may
[33:13] make mistakes you may fall you may slip
[33:16] on everything else but god gave us his
[33:19] word that we would keep his word the
[33:22] best we know how now we understand
[33:26] clearly here
[33:27] that after
[33:29] years centuries
[33:31] of
[33:32] christianity as we know it
[33:34] the church continues to try to live the
[33:38] life of jesus christ
[33:41] according to what they have read here in
[33:44] the bible
[33:45] and nothing is wrong with reading it
[33:47] here in the bible
[33:50] but the life is not words a life is a a
[33:54] being a spirit a person
[33:57] hallelujah so uh they're trying to live
[34:00] the life of christ
[34:03] by a list of directions
[34:06] and they're using that to teach
[34:10] the people in christianity
[34:12] uh to bring forth a christianity
[34:15] that is based on
[34:18] lining up their life with these uh
[34:21] religious
[34:23] scriptures that they've put together and
[34:25] says this is what god wants you to be
[34:27] this he wants you to have love look you
[34:30] know he wants you to have temperance
[34:32] virtue patience he wants you to have all
[34:34] those fruits of the spirit in your and
[34:36] it's true
[34:38] but they're not telling you how are you
[34:40] going to do that
[34:43] how are you going to do that it's not
[34:45] just reading it and then saying oh i'm
[34:47] going to be a christian so i'm going to
[34:49] stop doing this i'm going to stop doing
[34:51] that i'm not going to do this and i will
[34:53] do that and then people who will uh see
[34:56] me as a christian that is not what god
[35:00] had in this mind amen
[35:02] now
[35:03] uh we know that brother branham had a
[35:08] vision of uh of a baby
[35:12] and this baby was trying to put on
[35:15] its clothing
[35:17] and it was struggling trying to put the
[35:19] clothing on and put the arm into the
[35:23] armhole and was missing and you know how
[35:27] they do was babies
[35:29] up trying to do it and it just was not
[35:32] working uh whatsoever amen
[35:35] but then the same
[35:37] one who told him i'll teach you how to
[35:40] fish
[35:41] that one turns and tells him now i'll
[35:44] guide your arm
[35:46] i'll guide your arm into that armhole so
[35:50] you'll know how to put on the clothes
[35:52] amen now what i'm saying is what paul
[35:55] said
[35:57] paul told us clearly
[35:59] put on christ
[36:02] put on christ
[36:04] and that's what the world and the church
[36:06] world the nominal church world they're
[36:09] trying to put on christ but in actual
[36:13] fact uh you know
[36:15] they're struggling
[36:17] one denomination says well put your arm
[36:20] this way and you you you'll become a
[36:23] christian or put your arm that way and
[36:25] it will get in the right position or do
[36:28] it like this or do it like that and
[36:31] everything else and not stopping to
[36:34] recognize
[36:35] that only he can live his own life
[36:40] you can't live his life
[36:43] he has to live his own life
[36:46] is that right
[36:47] so in other words if you want to live
[36:50] the life of christ you've got to
[36:53] surrender all to him
[36:56] and let him guide you
[36:58] to be able to live out his life
[37:01] christ in you is your hope of glory
[37:05] christ himself in you living his own
[37:08] life is your hope of glory except you
[37:11] may come as a little child be converted
[37:14] you shall not enter the kingdom of
[37:16] heaven amen praise god hallelujah so
[37:20] he'll say i'll guide you and when i say
[37:23] uh push your hand this way push it that
[37:25] way if i say push your hand this way put
[37:28] it that way amen praise god obedience
[37:32] praise the lord hallelujah so god is
[37:36] going to guide you to line up
[37:39] with his own word
[37:42] god is going to let you grow in grace
[37:46] that you can line up your life with his
[37:49] own lord thank god hallelujah amen but
[37:53] do you know he is not going to show
[37:55] everybody how to do that
[37:59] amen
[38:00] unto you it is given to know the
[38:02] mysteries of the kingdom
[38:04] but unto them it is not given
[38:07] you see he only do that for his wife
[38:10] his bride
[38:12] his children
[38:14] amen god has a bride he has a select
[38:19] elected few
[38:21] in the midst of the millions
[38:24] just like it was when they came out of
[38:26] egypt you know that two million of them
[38:29] they said about two million of them came
[38:31] out of egypt but how many made it in a
[38:33] promise into the promised land from the
[38:36] original generation only two
[38:39] joshua caleb all the rest was young
[38:41] generation that was born in the
[38:42] wilderness all the rest of them died
[38:45] their carcasses perished
[38:47] amen see and that's what's happened you
[38:50] got the whole church world of thousands
[38:53] of denominations but god will only
[38:56] reveal it to his selected elected few
[39:01] whom he predestinated
[39:03] and ordained before the foundation of
[39:07] the world to receive his word in this
[39:10] day and in this hour
[39:13] amen praise god hallelujah amen so god
[39:18] is the one who we must depend on to show
[39:21] us where the armhole is
[39:26] where is the revelation in the word that
[39:30] i can put my arm in there
[39:33] where i can go through there
[39:35] where i can walk beyond the veil
[39:39] of the just the right things we're going
[39:42] beyond the veil we're breaking into the
[39:45] real tabernacle of god this spiritual
[39:49] individual tabernacle where we can go
[39:52] behind the veil praise god hallelujah
[39:55] not just look at each other's faces but
[39:58] realizing that we are the skin veil that
[40:02] god lives in
[40:03] in this day and in this hour
[40:07] hallelujah
[40:08] it's not just you just yet me sit here
[40:11] like i've said it before you've never
[40:13] seen me
[40:14] all you seen is my body standing here
[40:17] and talking to you but i the person
[40:20] talking to you lives in this tabernacle
[40:23] amen oh praise god and we gather here
[40:26] together like this amen all of us got a
[40:30] skin there long god choose to give you a
[40:33] white very just pink veil a brown veil
[40:36] velar whatever veil but we are just like
[40:40] the badger skins the skins that were in
[40:42] the tabernacle and behind that was the
[40:46] glory of god hallelujah
[40:50] hallelujah god has hidden his glory and
[40:54] his life behind us your skin veil
[40:57] amen that he might live in us and walk
[41:01] in us listen book of revelation he says
[41:05] and i heard a great voice from heaven
[41:07] saying
[41:08] and i will be their god and they will be
[41:13] my people and i will live in them and i
[41:17] will walk in them and they shall be my
[41:20] people
[41:21] and i will be their god no you not your
[41:24] bodies are the temples of the holy ghost
[41:27] who lives in you the holy spirit lives
[41:30] in you amen jesus christ the same
[41:34] yesterday today and forever amen oh my
[41:38] hallelujah so the bride knows what to do
[41:42] with the word
[41:44] and she only knows what to do with the
[41:47] word when he shows her
[41:50] what's there then she knows how to act
[41:53] other than that she just waits
[41:55] and trusts him and believes until he
[41:59] tells her what to do amen praise god
[42:02] hallelujah oh my and then she has
[42:05] nothing to boast about uh i do this or
[42:09] this one is more of a christian than the
[42:11] other one
[42:12] and the other one is holier than the
[42:14] next one
[42:15] none of us are holier than the next one
[42:17] because it's christ in you that makes
[42:19] you holy
[42:21] this man outside here isn't holy
[42:24] it doesn't matter how much bible you
[42:25] read how many fastings how many brains
[42:28] how many flagellations are your body
[42:30] with whips this man here will never
[42:32] become holy
[42:34] amen because this man here has to do
[42:37] with sin and death but paul said this
[42:40] outward man is going to die daily but
[42:43] the inward man is going to be renewed
[42:46] hallelujah because he is going in a
[42:48] rapture
[42:51] amen
[42:52] we are we are this world is not our home
[42:56] because we know we come from god
[42:59] and we're going back to god
[43:01] we know we're a part of his economy
[43:05] his spirit lives in us
[43:07] that's the spirit the quickening spirit
[43:10] of resurrection is already in you
[43:13] your resurrection is ashore by the
[43:15] living god hallelujah it's in you
[43:18] already and he's working and working in
[43:21] you amen as paul talks about the power
[43:24] that worketh in you even now hallelujah
[43:27] amen praise god i tell you uh this thank
[43:32] god he's knocked away all these false
[43:34] ideas uh churchianity
[43:37] the rapture is going to be a certain day
[43:39] at a trumpet you're going to hear a
[43:40] trumpet
[43:41] and all of a sudden your body starts to
[43:43] change and you're going up in your
[43:45] nightgown
[43:46] into the heavens no no no no no that's
[43:49] not the way it is we are being
[43:52] transformed
[43:54] you're moving from glory unto glory unto
[43:58] glory until that wonderful time come
[44:01] you'll step right into the glory of god
[44:04] hallelujah because you're being changed
[44:06] by the power of god and the holy spirit
[44:09] working and moving within you amen
[44:12] hallelujah we can't do it ourselves
[44:17] i'm trying to tell you we can't live
[44:19] real christianity by ourselves
[44:22] not talking about put on christianity
[44:25] i'm not talking about
[44:27] christianity that is produced by
[44:29] teaching you how to act
[44:31] uh how to act like a christian
[44:34] how to dramatize the christian life uh
[44:38] we are not here to have all kinds of to
[44:41] impress people uh with the way no it's
[44:44] jesus christ must live through you
[44:48] and we know that we will still make
[44:50] mistakes
[44:53] is that right yes
[44:54] we don't have to feel embarrassed if we
[44:56] make mistakes
[44:58] because this outer man here is going to
[45:01] still make mistakes
[45:03] the key of it though if you're a real
[45:05] christian in your heart you don't want
[45:08] to make any mistakes
[45:12] you don't have any desire to make any
[45:15] mistakes
[45:16] you want to live according to what god
[45:18] has said and what god has done and is
[45:21] doing within his word amen so we are
[45:26] just here to obey god
[45:28] and obey his word
[45:30] when he says run we run when he says
[45:32] walk we walk
[45:34] when he says just sit still and stand
[45:37] still and know that i am god we sit
[45:40] still
[45:41] we wait on the lord until we see the
[45:44] glory of god hallelujah amen if you
[45:48] can't even do the abcs are you going to
[45:51] get up in the realms of the holy spirit
[45:54] to work through you amen hallelujah amen
[45:57] we realize friends that rarely
[46:01] we don't need a revelation
[46:03] to know that water baptism
[46:06] needs to be in the name of jesus christ
[46:09] they had hundreds of years of deceiving
[46:12] our minds
[46:13] but the lord has set us free
[46:17] because no woman is going to have her
[46:19] mad certificate signed by the the
[46:21] carpenter
[46:24] or
[46:25] or i'm a carpenter i'm a mechanic and
[46:27] i'm a this and then they put those three
[46:29] things there no
[46:31] what is your name
[46:33] the judge wants to know what is your
[46:36] name
[46:37] and say oh his name is jesus
[46:40] you know there's no name as father
[46:43] there's no name a son there's no name as
[46:45] holy but the bible says in the name of
[46:48] the father the son and the holy ghost
[46:50] one name in the name
[46:53] not in the names
[46:55] but in the name
[46:58] of the one who is the father and the son
[47:01] and the holy ghost
[47:04] and you don't tell me that my apostles
[47:06] were all
[47:08] of the bible they didn't know what they
[47:10] were talking about because the minute
[47:12] they asked peter men and brethren what
[47:14] shall we do to be saved he says repent
[47:17] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[47:21] hallelujah and you'll never find one
[47:23] spot in the entire new testament where
[47:27] anybody was told to be baptized in the
[47:30] titles of father son and holy ghost
[47:34] every place whether it's philip whether
[47:36] it's peter whether it's paul and the
[47:38] bible will always and they baptize them
[47:41] in the name of jesus christ
[47:44] it's there in the word and paul goes on
[47:46] he says and all that you do do it in the
[47:49] name of jesus christ there's only one
[47:52] name
[47:53] i said there's only one name above all
[47:56] others
[47:58] there's one name above all others
[48:00] praise god no other name that is higher
[48:03] than that name as the sun said all hail
[48:07] the power of jesus name
[48:10] angel prostrate fall hallelujah
[48:13] oh my praise god forevermore one name
[48:18] for one god
[48:20] one god but that one god look you know
[48:23] queen elizabeth just uh passed away how
[48:26] many knows that
[48:27] she's just gone on to be with the lord
[48:31] amen
[48:32] and
[48:32] you must realize
[48:34] that she held different titles not only
[48:37] was she queen of england
[48:39] she was the head of the
[48:41] all the lodges for the scottish
[48:44] branch
[48:45] she was the head of the anglican church
[48:48] and the heads of the commonwealth
[48:51] those are titles
[48:53] that's not her name
[48:55] that's what she is so god is a father
[49:00] god created a body and lived in the body
[49:03] that's why jesus could say the father
[49:06] that dwelleth in me he do it works the
[49:09] father was in the sun
[49:11] amen god in christ hallelujah what i'm
[49:15] telling you about is happening now but
[49:18] now it's christ in the church amen
[49:21] living out his own life in his church
[49:23] praise god my god for
[49:26] may he may glorified here this morning
[49:29] amen oh praise god amen of course you
[49:33] can't go and do what's not written in
[49:35] the word what what you're supposed to do
[49:38] and you can't do what is that revealed
[49:41] to you to do praise god because you'll
[49:44] be doing it by yourself
[49:46] by your own mind
[49:48] your own actions
[49:49] whatsoever but all we have to do is
[49:52] relax
[49:54] let go
[49:55] and let god have his way
[49:57] when he says push push
[50:00] when he says walk walk
[50:02] when he says live a certain way live a
[50:04] certain way hallelujah so we don't need
[50:07] a revelation to know you need to be
[50:09] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[50:12] because that's the name will be on your
[50:15] spiritual marriage certificate
[50:17] amen jesus christ hallelujah amen
[50:21] we don't need a
[50:23] um a revelation to know that women
[50:26] should not be chopping off their hair
[50:30] oh my i didn't get any amen
[50:36] i gotta watch it because
[50:38] like
[50:39] walking on a narrow
[50:41] thing there
[50:42] yeah but we don't need a revelation for
[50:44] that the bible clearly says that a woman
[50:48] in the new testament there that she
[50:50] should not cut off her hair
[50:54] is that right
[50:55] oh my praise god hallelujah and turns
[50:59] the opposite way to men that they should
[51:01] cut their hair but that but the women
[51:04] should not cut their hair amen praise
[51:07] god right there in the word of god
[51:09] hallelujah it tells you in the bible she
[51:12] shall not wear
[51:13] any garment that
[51:16] looks like a man's garment pertains it
[51:18] says in the book of judah she shall not
[51:22] put on that mean shorts
[51:25] that means slacks
[51:26] that means the best 200 300 500 new
[51:30] jeans
[51:32] she shall not
[51:34] put on garments that pertain to a man
[51:38] the bible goes further it's a curse
[51:41] it's an abomination in the eyes of the
[51:44] lord that's not me saying that that's
[51:47] the book of deuteronomy says that
[51:49] but what does the church do they throw
[51:51] hello to that we we got to fill up this
[51:53] building with our members and uh you
[51:56] know
[51:57] they can come in however they want come
[51:59] as you are you know come as you are
[52:02] and even if they come in the first time
[52:04] like that the second time the third time
[52:07] they leave them keep coming like that
[52:09] amen which god is intent intention was
[52:12] come as you are yeah but after you get
[52:14] converted you don't want to come back
[52:16] like that you don't want to live like
[52:18] that you don't want to be you don't want
[52:20] to be wearing sex exposure clothes you
[52:23] don't want to wear them uh
[52:25] new york pants that's hanging down to
[52:27] the floor
[52:28] with the crutch going down and
[52:31] walking with a swagger
[52:32] like that no because you've been changed
[52:35] by the power of god
[52:37] your life has been transformed by the
[52:40] spirit of almighty god amen hallelujah
[52:43] amen you don't need a revelation for
[52:46] that
[52:47] you don't need a revelation to know that
[52:51] no woman should be preaching oh well my
[52:53] pastor is a preacher well i was up in uh
[52:56] in toronto
[52:58] and this uh a so-called great woman
[53:01] preacher is telling me well
[53:03] what is that i'm a preacher of so-and-so
[53:06] this big group was wonderful wonderful i
[53:09] said that's wonderful that you did that
[53:12] nothing with your ability you might your
[53:14] ability may be even greater than the
[53:15] mind but never mind that god still says
[53:18] still says she shall not teach
[53:22] nor usurp authority over a man
[53:26] amen well but my husband will allow me
[53:28] to do it i said well shame on him never
[53:31] mind he's there but while he was right
[53:33] there i said that he will allow you to
[53:35] do that uh like that that means that
[53:37] he's suppressed he's oppressed like
[53:39] jezebel did with ahab and he can't say
[53:42] nothing right like that i said but the
[53:45] bible doesn't change it still says she
[53:47] shall not teach
[53:49] but i teach and i teach better
[53:51] that's wonderful you may have all those
[53:53] gifts that you can teach but the you see
[53:57] the word teach
[53:59] presupposes that the one who is teaching
[54:02] has a more knowledge than the one that
[54:05] is being taught
[54:07] and the bible said you are not to usurp
[54:10] authority
[54:11] in a cunning way you're taking authority
[54:14] over those people that you're standing
[54:16] in front of and you bring in the word
[54:18] too and so oh she got mad and she had a
[54:21] hat on she'd take it and fling it on the
[54:23] floor and
[54:24] oh my so and then the spirit that was in
[54:27] her manifesting like that but you just
[54:30] think it's a
[54:31] righteous religious spirit that just got
[54:34] angry not realizing that's when the
[54:37] devil hears the word come forth in such
[54:40] a way clear clear clean
[54:43] you can't mistake it you can't escape it
[54:46] then he gets so mad he don't like it
[54:49] amen but that's the word of god
[54:51] nevertheless hallelujah
[54:53] she shall not you don't need a
[54:55] revelation for that
[54:57] amen he said oh
[54:59] why why why why why don't i need a
[55:01] revelation with that i never seen that
[55:03] in the bible well why don't you let your
[55:05] grandmother walk down the street with
[55:07] bikinis
[55:09] what would that be
[55:10] you're going to look down and say granny
[55:12] you can't why she can't do that you're
[55:14] doing it why she can't well no well the
[55:17] bible says you shall not amen
[55:20] praise god paint like jessie bell did
[55:23] painted up lips painted up face amen you
[55:28] take off some of that paint you might be
[55:29] able to paint your front door with it
[55:31] but the fact is
[55:33] they have so much pain they've gone away
[55:36] from their natural beauty
[55:39] say but i'm not beautiful god says you
[55:41] are
[55:42] there's only one of you you know god
[55:44] never met two things again
[55:47] everything is single everything is
[55:49] unique
[55:50] anything has its own beauty its own
[55:53] grace
[55:54] nobody can be you nobody can do what you
[55:57] can do
[55:59] [Applause]
[56:00] hallelujah
[56:02] how dare anybody call you or say
[56:05] anything god made you the way you are
[56:08] with your black yellow red brown that's
[56:10] the beauty and the grace of almighty god
[56:12] god made for that way
[56:15] hallelujah
[56:16] he made you that way hallelujah and he
[56:20] knows why he made us the way he made us
[56:23] praise god and we're not to question
[56:25] these things we're just to live
[56:27] according to his word
[56:29] live according to his promises that he
[56:32] gave us praise be to god forevermore
[56:35] hallelujah amen now listen
[56:39] he says
[56:41] quoting here now remember there's always
[56:44] been an ark in god's economy
[56:48] and
[56:49] we know it was always for the saving of
[56:52] the people right
[56:54] and then we know the ark of testimony in
[56:57] the days of law
[56:59] so they followed the ark because the
[57:02] testimony or word was in the ark that
[57:05] they were following now the third
[57:07] dispensation
[57:09] noah's time then lots time and now this
[57:13] time amen the ark is an arc here now
[57:19] right not a denomination
[57:22] neither
[57:24] the good works in in other words those
[57:27] things can't save you the ark save north
[57:31] from the flood of judgment
[57:33] denomination can't save you from
[57:36] judgment
[57:37] amen praise god hallelujah
[57:40] we find out that good works can't save
[57:43] you uh
[57:44] from the judgments of god
[57:46] i did this and i though you'll give your
[57:49] body to be burned
[57:50] don't you give all your goods to the
[57:52] poor
[57:53] and you have not charity hallelujah
[57:57] charity you think it's just you loving
[58:00] no
[58:01] you don't have the gift of god in you
[58:05] for the gift of god is eternal life the
[58:08] gift of god is the gene that is in you
[58:11] you didn't ask for that you didn't beg
[58:13] for that but you were given peace of
[58:16] himself in your heart
[58:18] by grace you were given him praise the
[58:21] lord praise the lord let me just say
[58:23] here don't tell me don't get excited
[58:26] i got to be excited because i'm seeing
[58:29] the word of god clear within my own mind
[58:32] and one heart while i'm talking to you
[58:34] here praise god hallelujah
[58:36] amen and then how can i overcome
[58:40] you see
[58:41] watch
[58:42] now we the only way that you can
[58:46] overcome see
[58:48] is under the shed blood
[58:51] is by the shed blood
[58:53] because you cannot overcome by yourself
[58:56] amen he that has overcome is already
[59:01] living in you
[59:03] and you are now resting on that
[59:06] hallelujah you're resting on that fact
[59:09] that i'm not going to overcome anything
[59:11] i'm not going to do this it's christ in
[59:13] me that's going to work through me and
[59:15] overcome everything around me glory be
[59:18] to god hallelujah amen now look
[59:23] what watch the kind of life you are
[59:25] living
[59:27] if it is just lived out of you
[59:29] automatically
[59:32] or
[59:33] you
[59:34] or do you have to strain and try to pull
[59:37] to live it
[59:39] then
[59:40] it's you that is
[59:42] doing that
[59:44] don't you try to do that
[59:47] don't you ever try
[59:49] again i said don't you
[59:52] because it's just like that baby putting
[59:55] its arm in the sleeve hole
[59:57] he's just up and down in every place
[1:00:00] trying to live the life of christ trying
[1:00:02] to put on christ trying to put his hand
[1:00:05] through the sleeve hole like that amen
[1:00:09] you may even say oh oh little baby or
[1:00:12] honey put on your coat put on your
[1:00:14] little jacket
[1:00:16] he'll do everything he can
[1:00:18] hey man but he can't do it it takes your
[1:00:22] steady hand to guide him or her
[1:00:26] and to put their arm in that armhole
[1:00:30] amen aren't you glad that we can just
[1:00:33] yield our lives
[1:00:36] surrender to our heavenly father
[1:00:38] and say lord lead me and guide me great
[1:00:42] holy spirit guide me today
[1:00:45] lead me today whatever i say wherever i
[1:00:48] go whatever i do how i walk how i talk
[1:00:51] take my entire life under your control
[1:00:54] lord hallelujah for the only way i can
[1:00:57] be like jesus is for jesus to be in me
[1:01:00] and live his own life amen
[1:01:04] it's not for me
[1:01:05] i'm approaching this from another angle
[1:01:07] so that you might understand what i'm
[1:01:09] saying it's not for me
[1:01:12] as you know in the dramatic arts
[1:01:14] you might get your script and then
[1:01:17] i'm going to now go out there and it's
[1:01:20] not for me to try to interpret the life
[1:01:23] of christ by my actions
[1:01:26] it's not for me to try to do that but if
[1:01:29] he can come in me
[1:01:32] live in me
[1:01:33] and interpret or speak his own words and
[1:01:37] deliver his own life through me amen
[1:01:41] then it is not me interpreting him
[1:01:44] but god
[1:01:46] being his own interpreter
[1:01:49] and making everything plain for his
[1:01:51] glory
[1:01:52] and that's what god wants to do with you
[1:01:54] and with every one of us that will
[1:01:57] completely surrender to him
[1:01:59] amen praise god hallelujah blessed be
[1:02:03] the name of the lord amen oh we got to
[1:02:06] get to the place where we said lord i
[1:02:08] just quit i i can't do it
[1:02:11] what's in this world today and what's
[1:02:13] going on for instance
[1:02:15] can you watch over your children 24
[1:02:17] hours a day
[1:02:18] when you send them to school you can
[1:02:20] watch them 24 hours a day so that they
[1:02:22] can be safe
[1:02:23] with all the things they have it's good

[1:03:37] that and they keep doing it and they're
[1:03:38] messing up themselves
[1:03:41] they're messing up their life they
[1:03:44] they can't put on christ they can't put
[1:03:46] on the claws like they should put it on
[1:03:49] and even if they have it on it's skewed
[1:03:52] this way or skewed that way or back to
[1:03:54] front or something like that instead of
[1:03:56] coming to the place and saying mommy
[1:03:58] daddy i i i just can't do it

[1:04:04] right that's what we need to do to god

[1:04:40] praise god and when you yield to him
[1:04:43] he'll put your hand in the right place
[1:04:47] but let's carry it a little further
[1:04:49] you can also ask him to put your feet in
[1:04:53] the right place
[1:04:55] the steps of a righteous man or woman
[1:04:58] are ordained of the lord
[1:05:01] hallelujah god knows what wherever
[1:05:03] you're going to go whoever you're going
[1:05:05] to meet whatever you're going to do
[1:05:07] before you've done it he already knows

[1:05:40] amen lord give me all you need to give
[1:05:44] me lord guide me and let my heart knows

[1:06:01] for his glory and for his honor amen you
[1:06:05] see the thing you have to overcome
[1:06:08] is yourself
[1:06:10] your own ideas
[1:06:13] your thing the thing that we need to do
[1:06:17] is to surrender to him
[1:06:20] praise god hallelujah and not be like
[1:06:23] that i i i can do it i can do it i i i
[1:06:26] can live it i can be that that doesn't
[1:06:28] mean nothing to god that is your own
[1:06:31] will hallelujah amen praise god aren't
[1:06:35] you glad that you are you're christian
[1:06:39] aren't you glad as the song said i'm
[1:06:41] serving the lord i'm reading my bible
[1:06:45] believing god's word
[1:06:48] amen praise god hallelujah and then
[1:06:53] of course with that you will begin to
[1:06:56] produce or reproduce
[1:06:59] the fruits
[1:07:00] of
[1:07:02] the word the fruits of christ well he is
[1:07:04] the root and we are the fruit
[1:07:08] we we produce the fruit
[1:07:11] i am the vine you are the branches the
[1:07:13] root don't bear the fruit it's the
[1:07:15] branches beard the fruit right and so
[1:07:18] the fruit comes through the life of the
[1:07:21] true believer amen hallelujah what is
[1:07:25] the fruit amen anointed one at the end
[1:07:28] time the word is the fruit for the
[1:07:31] season
[1:07:32] amen you're producing a life to meet the
[1:07:36] age you're living in
[1:07:38] you understand me
[1:07:40] your the life that is manifesting
[1:07:43] through you must be a life to meet the
[1:07:46] challenge of the age
[1:07:48] in which you are living in by the grace
[1:07:50] of god
[1:07:51] hallelujah what is it
[1:07:54] what is it but you see
[1:07:56] they are sending forth a teaching a
[1:07:59] teaching of the season
[1:08:01] man's doctrine
[1:08:02] denominational doctrine producing a
[1:08:05] denominational form of life
[1:08:09] that kind of thing like that amen but we
[1:08:12] must produce the word of god for the
[1:08:16] season
[1:08:17] to meet the challenge of this age by the
[1:08:20] grace of god hallelujah you see it's by
[1:08:25] how you accept the word
[1:08:27] shows what spirit
[1:08:30] is living behind your veil
[1:08:33] let me repeat that again
[1:08:35] how you respond to the word of god
[1:08:39] shows what being what kind of spirit
[1:08:43] a person is living behind this veil
[1:08:47] is that right now you notice eve didn't
[1:08:49] reject god and say oh i don't believe in
[1:08:51] god she believed god
[1:08:54] all she did was to accept an error
[1:08:58] all she did was accept an error
[1:09:01] and the same thing
[1:09:03] when whatever you accept shows where
[1:09:07] you're putting your vote or you put in
[1:09:09] your life that shows where you're
[1:09:11] putting your life amen praise god but i
[1:09:15] want to thank god for his great grace
[1:09:17] and his goodness
[1:09:19] now we know that the bible says the rain
[1:09:22] falls on the just and on the unjust
[1:09:25] and when the rain falls it falls on the
[1:09:28] weed that's in the field and it falls on
[1:09:31] the wheat that's in the field but god is
[1:09:34] not partial he falls in everybody but
[1:09:37] watch this
[1:09:38] now
[1:09:39] uh
[1:09:40] you've got a lot of weeds trying to say
[1:09:42] that i'm a weak too
[1:09:43] i'm a christian too i'm a believer too
[1:09:46] and you're dressed like a christian walk
[1:09:47] like a christian talk like a christian
[1:09:49] that doesn't make you a christian but
[1:09:51] when the rain falls on the seed it
[1:09:55] begins to force the life out of that
[1:09:58] seed
[1:09:59] when it starts to germatize it starts to
[1:10:03] break forth into life right
[1:10:06] and then it makes one seed wants to grow
[1:10:10] and and produce fruit
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:13] but the other
[1:10:15] seed comes forth and all it's producing
[1:10:19] is
[1:10:20] is thorns and tissues this is what jesus
[1:10:23] talked about amen uh i spoke about in
[1:10:27] the book of matthew when he says here uh
[1:10:30] about it bring it forth nothing but
[1:10:32] thorns and tissues
[1:10:35] what is he saying the thistle
[1:10:37] can't help being what it is
[1:10:40] because that's the seed of life that it
[1:10:43] come from
[1:10:44] and the wig can't help being a wheat
[1:10:47] because that's the seed of life it comes
[1:10:49] from
[1:10:50] and every seed must bring forth after
[1:10:54] its kind
[1:10:55] therefore listen there now he says you
[1:10:58] see then
[1:11:00] when that anointing gets
[1:11:02] on the unjust
[1:11:04] them false teachers
[1:11:06] it causes them
[1:11:08] to do exactly what god's word told them
[1:11:13] not to do
[1:11:15] and they can't help it
[1:11:18] because it's a tissue to begin with
[1:11:21] that's the seed that's the nature they
[1:11:24] can't help it it doesn't matter how they
[1:11:26] try to cultivate the christianity
[1:11:29] doesn't matter how they try to do it
[1:11:30] this way it will not change because
[1:11:33] that's the nature of the thing that it
[1:11:36] came from amen
[1:11:38] hallelujah and they will absolutely do
[1:11:40] absolutely opposite to what god has told
[1:11:44] them i'm going to wind this up because
[1:11:45] we have a water baptism how many knows
[1:11:47] that
[1:11:49] praise the lord we have a water baptism
[1:11:52] now so you can start getting uh a person
[1:11:55] ready if there
[1:11:59] you go ahead praise the lord
[1:12:03] now they do exactly what god told them
[1:12:06] not to do
[1:12:07] but they'll do it anyhow
[1:12:09] why
[1:12:10] they cannot help it
[1:12:12] how can a thistle be anything else but a
[1:12:15] thistle or a weed
[1:12:17] right
[1:12:18] jesus said that
[1:12:20] that will be so close
[1:12:24] that it would deceive the elected
[1:12:26] if it were possible
[1:12:29] but because the elect
[1:12:31] is of the wheat seed
[1:12:33] it automatically will know a weed
[1:12:36] it automatically there's nothing about
[1:12:39] it there's just no weed because the weed
[1:12:41] life doesn't line up with the life of
[1:12:43] the world whatsoever it is not possible
[1:12:47] because a wheat can do nothing but bear
[1:12:50] wheat and that's all it can bear
[1:12:54] through its lifetime all the wheat can
[1:12:56] bear with wheat and next year wheat
[1:12:58] again and the year after wheat wheat it
[1:13:00] can't do anything else that's what it
[1:13:02] was made for and the other one was made
[1:13:04] for what uh
[1:13:06] you know to be a deceiver to be a liar
[1:13:09] to to be a foul bird in the same
[1:13:12] branches of christianity as the book of
[1:13:14] revelation tells us
[1:13:16] sitting in the branches but unclean
[1:13:18] spirits all manners seducing religious
[1:13:21] devils within the boundaries of
[1:13:23] christianity amen oh friends some are
[1:13:27] even in there to turn around and take
[1:13:30] the
[1:13:30] very bible and blind the people
[1:13:33] and make them indifferent to the word of
[1:13:35] god but we're calling people back to the
[1:13:38] original world
[1:13:40] back to the original faith to stand the
[1:13:43] way god wants us to stand upon the word
[1:13:46] of god could you come
[1:13:48] brother anthony praise the lord
[1:13:50] hallelujah amen yes sir but when god
[1:13:53] wants you to hear the right type of word
[1:13:56] amen it will bring you right inside of
[1:13:59] the ark so that you can live his life to
[1:14:03] his glory and to his honor amen aren't
[1:14:07] you glad that you can say you're one of
[1:14:09] them amen
[1:14:11] aren't you glad you're a christian
[1:14:12] serving the lord
[1:14:14] as we await on those that will
[1:14:17] participate in the water baptism uh here

[1:14:25] the lord and give glory to his name amen

[1:19:38] that like as christ was raised up from
[1:19:41] the dead
[1:19:43] by the glory of the father even so
[1:19:45] we also should walk in newness of life
[1:19:49] if you have been planted together in the

[1:23:00] words praise god
[1:23:03] just to um i just felt i needed to
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:08] i needed to refer to
[1:23:10] the passing of queen elizabeth
[1:23:13] ii
[1:23:14] um
[1:23:16] publicly wanted to give recognition of
[1:23:18] that
[1:23:19] that she has passed over sibel why
[1:23:22] there's a lot of people dying and
[1:23:23] passing but you understand that her
[1:23:26] passing also has
[1:23:28] a spiritual significance to it
[1:23:33] for of the
[1:23:34] old rulers
[1:23:37] that reigned and ruled
[1:23:40] she is the one
[1:23:41] as a woman
[1:23:43] that reigned for
[1:23:45] 70 years
[1:23:48] 70 years
[1:23:49] which is like the seven church ages have
[1:23:52] ended
[1:23:54] the age of those kinds of rulers have
[1:23:57] ended
[1:23:59] just as
[1:24:00] for the united states
[1:24:02] they will get no more washington's
[1:24:04] they'll have no more abraham lincoln's
[1:24:07] the time for those great men and women
[1:24:10] of that time
[1:24:12] is now past
[1:24:14] it's gone the whole thing is going to
[1:24:16] start to deteriorate from here on out
[1:24:20] and it's going to do it rapidly
[1:24:22] and that that's the symbol it's going to
[1:24:25] start to deteriorate rapidly
[1:24:28] now watch quickly just to mention
[1:24:31] at the same time
[1:24:33] over england this wasn't publicized in a
[1:24:36] big way
[1:24:38] there passed a a multi-colored light
[1:24:42] pass passed over england
[1:24:45] and they said they don't know if it's an
[1:24:47] asteroid if it's a
[1:24:50] space junk but it can't be they don't
[1:24:52] know what it is because an asteroid will
[1:24:55] come and in two seconds it will appear
[1:24:58] shine
[1:24:59] and then it'll disappear but this one
[1:25:02] went for 20 seconds across
[1:25:06] the place like that and the light was
[1:25:08] not one colored what was multicolored
[1:25:11] changing all the time while it was
[1:25:14] crossing over they don't know what it is
[1:25:17] but god
[1:25:18] showing
[1:25:19] one error has changed
[1:25:22] gone
[1:25:24] and now we find out the man of sin and
[1:25:27] of lawlessness
[1:25:29] is going to start coming into power
[1:25:31] rapidly
[1:25:34] watch these modern events
[1:25:37] being made clear by vindicated prophecy
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:42] not only that
[1:25:44] but
[1:25:45] they don't know what's going on they
[1:25:47] said
[1:25:48] a rainbow appeared over buckingham
[1:25:52] palace and
[1:25:54] simultaneously at the same time
[1:25:58] juan appeared over windsor castle
[1:26:02] and another castle that she used to be
[1:26:05] in
[1:26:06] another one appeared three rainbows all
[1:26:09] at the same time over those castles
[1:26:13] a perfect rain
[1:26:15] a perfect time
[1:26:16] but watch friends there are things
