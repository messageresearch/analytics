[1:44] and I'm so amazed how God is such a
[1:58] great blessing
[2:01] [Music]
[2:14] [Music]
[2:22] [Music]
[2:37] [Music]
[2:42] mrs. believers there so that I sent to
[2:47] the brown yesterday I believe everything
[2:56] that we are
[3:04] [Music]
[3:07] and there is a specific
[3:14] [Music]
[3:26] [Music]
[3:41] [Music]
[3:48] [Music]
[4:05] [Music]
[4:11] [Music]
[4:22] [Music]
[4:25] so we are working in this light
[4:33] so
[4:43] I just thought to share with you
[5:10] [Music]
[5:25] [Music]
[5:31] [Music]
[5:48] [Music]
[5:53] in Reverse if the spirit of Jesus from
[6:41] the dead in Christ
[6:55] [Music]
[7:02] [Music]
[7:06] that is leading our hearts and that we
[7:11] can walk by the food to our DBS power
[7:16] the spiritualism that are quickly enough
[7:20] that we can the won't come in the flesh
[7:23] but in the spirit may you break the
[7:28] bread this 21st hunger and make yourself
[7:32] visible for our spiritual eyes
[7:39] [Music]
[7:46] [Music]
[8:43] [Music]
[8:59] there are some beach house
[9:16] there are somebody that also broke my
[9:22] home row by inheritance
[9:42] my chuckles ropes
[9:45] my relationship with God and this rubber
[9:54] is
[10:08] [Music]
[10:13] actually actually it was just a regular
[10:51] rubber it was a regular Road he always
[10:55] go against the wall and that was the law
[11:16] so he used Falco
[11:20] [Music]
[11:25] and this robbery is very smart and he
[11:35] loves thousand years
[11:56] [Music]
[12:15] and he's been studying very hard trying
[12:19] to understand there was one thing that
[12:40] they must go back with and that was the
[12:52] law of the spirit of this and the law of
[13:03] sin didn't have any power
[13:17] so Jesus heroes by that the law the law
[13:26] of the spirit of life well through the
[13:49] years I've been reading those verses yes
[14:02] when you can take something from the
[14:05] Bible
[14:16] [Music]
[14:24] [Music]
[14:42] [Music]
[15:11] [Music]
[15:18] and that's the law of the spirit of life
[15:22] in Christ I think it was somewhat
[15:29] radical Brenham he explained what
[15:35] happened when Jesus
[15:46] [Music]
[15:57] [Music]
[16:08] he said and he was to the door I'm sure
[16:47] I have when I true Daniel into the mines
[16:52] there we have a job I told I have well
[17:02] when you
[17:10] you're right you have to tear and she's
[17:28] over the people I come down I am the
[17:37] words worn top of the smart
[18:44] [Music]
[19:01] [Music]
[19:03] yes I take our
[19:10] [Music]
[19:32] granted by tonight and truly valid
[19:37] participatory reach over and grab the
[19:42] keys and said even few people get back
[19:48] in very long I'm the boss now my blood
[19:54] has been shed up there across for the
[19:58] remission of sins and for sickness and
[20:02] you can't keep them there any longer
[20:04] even there will be people who will
[20:08] believe me you can find them up with
[20:13] sickness you can find up with fear they
[20:16] will believe
[20:17] [Music]
[20:29] [Music]
[20:33] well
[21:35] and from the revenue speaks of this and
[21:42] how goes away from the
[22:13] and that's what
[22:18] [Music]
[22:23] all we see how people are crazy we see
[22:37] how interacting see all things going on
[22:40] and we know that this is manifestation
[23:09] [Music]
[23:27] [Music]
[24:00] [Music]
[24:06] we also they're all things that are
[24:33] spiritually must be manifested so that's
[24:42] the reason you know we are you today we
[24:46] are because we were a factor also
[25:00] [Music]
[25:38] [Music]
[25:47] so but you see God Oh camel trail they
[25:52] go God's more cannot fail and there was
[26:02] a team placed there in unity and the
[26:10] seagulls later and all
[26:17] emphasis on change because God has a
[26:28] long and that's the goal of the spirit
[26:31] of life in Jesus mark so you see one day
[26:42] you was a sinner but you didn't know
[26:45] that you were cleaning your natural life
[26:50] by your own eyes and it was
[27:41] well
[28:29] so I think this is such a wonderful
[28:33] thing when spring is coming when the ice
[28:39] is melting away and were so amazed
[29:16] [Music]
[29:24] Oh
[29:35] [Music]
[29:42] [Music]
[29:53] [Music]
[30:23] [Music]
[30:32] [Music]
[30:47] it's like a suit
[30:49] [Music]
[30:58] Oh
[31:17] [Music]
[31:28] [Music]
[31:38] [Music]
[31:52] [Music]
[32:00] [Music]
[32:06] [Music]
[32:20] [Music]
[32:53] and when you see that the holder is
[32:56] locking up for the manifestation of and
[33:07] we are living right in that moment where
[33:11] things are taking place up so this is a
[33:15] wonderful time references its regards
[33:23] [Music]
[33:27] and he speaks about how bright and how
[33:34] this pride was destroyed and speaks
[33:39] about this new horn came around and took
[33:45] up the fruits and it says the first
[33:49] thing the first fruits he took was
[33:57] and he says that's one of the things
[34:01] that keeps the church practice and then
[34:07] he speaks about all the other things my
[34:12] cloud lot suffering illness pinkness
[34:16] faith patience and the light spiritual
[34:22] spiritual gifts so when the first thing
[34:29] that was destroyed
[34:52] we have faith that we can let this
[34:57] happen
[34:57] and this is a supernatural thing this is
[35:01] nothing we can do by our own efforts
[35:29] [Music]
[35:39] and he will restore it back you see we
[35:55] are actually they are being transformed
[36:00] through justification sanctification
[36:04] baptism in the Holy Ghost and then we
[36:10] have the place and all those things have
[36:16] to take place
[36:43] [Music]
[36:50] we are
[37:25] so actually we feel that the law is
[37:30] against the law and is working to serve
[37:52] and though I said always goal for this
[37:57] purpose Oh actually and spiritually and
[38:01] they are working according to the random
[38:12] self that God said all these walls into
[38:15] mush that must work according to his
[38:20] over
[38:34] and they all told right in life and all
[38:40] the dogs work in handy because and the
[38:48] local life that's in us would also bring
[38:52] us to address it's impossible for it
[39:07] regardless of how they are how how how
[39:16] how sick we are how we are spirit is
[39:27] work
[39:38] [Music]
[39:48] and there is a law that forces
[40:08] and in second coordinates we do if this
[40:14] earth be dissolved he says see we have
[40:37] to come straight from the afternoon
[41:00] we are
[41:03] [Music]
[41:45] [Music]
[42:08] [Music]
[43:02] well
[43:20] [Music]
[43:41] and labor control and when people are
[43:51] controlled by things and that way we can
[44:09] see all those positions
[44:20] [Music]
[44:31] you have this already
[44:43] [Music]
[44:49] [Music]
[44:57] [Music]
[45:16] and if you remember when those hundred
[45:24] and twenty believers they made was they
[45:47] made assignment before God and they were
[45:52] actually they were sacrificing
[45:57] themselves and putting aside everything
[46:01] [Music]
[46:05] everything in every opinion every
[46:09] thought every every claim they just want
[46:13] come into one spirit
[46:16] [Music]
[46:40] [Music]
[46:51] [Music]
[47:14] and they were
[47:18] [Music]
[47:27] and you know every instrument is for us
