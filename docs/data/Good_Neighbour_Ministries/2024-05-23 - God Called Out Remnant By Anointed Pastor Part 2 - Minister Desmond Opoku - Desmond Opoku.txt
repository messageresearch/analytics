part two of my message let me put myself together here call out the remant by anointed pastors part two tonight we're going to see some cuz God said we have anointing and we have Force anointing so we're going to check both of them and how they characteristic and how they work so that we can walk with the real one the God who created heaven and earth before we we start we're going to read the the book of Jeremiah 23 1 to8 at the same time you're going to go to Matthew 24:24 War be unto the past pastors that destroy the destroy and Scatter the Sheep of my pasture said the Lord therefore thus said the Lord God of Israel against pastors that Feed My People ye have scattered my flock and driving them away and have not visited them behold I will visit upon you the evil of your doings said the Lord and I will gather the remnant of the flock out of the countries where I have driven them and will bring them again to their FES and they shall be fruitful and increase and I will set up Shepherds over them who shall feed them and they they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacked said the Lord behold the days cometh said the Lord that I will raise unto David A righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and Justice in the earth in this these days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and this is the name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness therefore behold the days come said the Lord that they shall no more say the Lord leaveth which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt but the Lord leaveth who which brought up and which led the seed of this house of Israel out of the North country and from all countries whether I have driven them and they shall dwell in their own land Hallelujah and let's go to Matthew 24:24 and they shall rise for Christ it didn't say Christ Christ that's more plural and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deserve very elect may the Lord add his Blessing onto his word you may be seated hallelujah amen thank you Lord I think we last time I I'm going to recap a little bit about what I said last two weeks ago we talk about how these false false pastors has driven away the children the children and uh thank God for his rich and mercy he set up his Shepherd we talk about he shed up his Shepherd and feed them wherever they were or they are around the world bring them back to the house of the Lord house of the Lord and feed them and let them Prosper so that they will not fear no more and their their their their their spiritual food will be increased God himself promised them that he will bring them back because they fed food where they they get contamination and they couldn't eat so they get sick so they have to run away to for for so they run have to run away for shelter you know Hallelujah at the same time uh we talk about how are we going to bring them back through through emissions through you are giving to missions as brother Braham Sam always said if you can't go if you can't go send somebody how you going to send somebody through your sacrifice giving cuz this church here we talk about this church here the foundation of this church here is always focusing the evangelism we started for a long time we did so many evangelism in Bruce Dale when we were there hamon uh hamon downtown sharing food baptizing people this church is always focusing to bring people and mature them in the presence of God hallelujah that's our goal amen blessed be the name of Lord and this gospel is trueu and it was given and Vindicated by the prophet that we believe Mara 45am so today we are going to find out how these two Spirits are very close that it can deceive some people but it were not possible but God has ordained a special people like nobody can touch that he said they have them he has them in the palm of his son no matter what Satan does he cannot deceive them God going to give you a discernment that can you can discern the for one and the true one you know when we read the B when we read the word of God he said false Christ and we know he didn't say false Jesus Christ he said false Christ and Christ is the anointing Christ is the anointing anting and the Lord is one Jesus Christ hallelujah amen if you remember I'm going to give you a example about Moses the prophet of God whom God predestinated to bring he he he predestinated him to fulfill his promise to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt he ordained him before the foundation of this world let me tell you tonight if has not been for the Lord God Almighty we cannot be staring we cannot be sitting here we were we are ordained to hear this message Hallelujah if you are not ordained to hear this message you'll be one of them that following those people out there God God destinated special people that will hear this message if as if you look back here from Paul to brother Braham Paul arenus Martin Columba Luther Wesley William Braham every one of them God ordained special people to receive that uh Messengers if you are are not ordained to receive that messenger you cannot receive their message because the message is pure and is pure so that that you can never get away from that because you are part of that message in that age can you imagine a bee can get away from from the honey it's impossible no matter how much they be wherever they are when they smell the honey right there they are there they cannot get away from the be it's like you the word of God attracts you is no more is no more human being somebody say oh why you always talk about maram William Braham oh yes why we always talk about PA why we always read about Matthew why we always read about John why you read about Luke is part because this Prophet is the Entre messenger what he did in the Bible how God used him never a man on this Earth here that God ever used that Willam Abraham if you you don't understand check it out go to the in uh go to the website and find out because Mar 45 already promised us that in this last days the leodan last days he will send the messenger to us revelation 10:7 so this brother came and fulfilled that that part of the word of God if it was the days where the Bible will be written his name would be there we don't worship him we quote him the same way as we quote the Bible Hallelujah no but we don't worship man somebody will why you always talk about Will let me tell you if has not been this message my life will not be like this because I used to go to church I can smoke I can drink I can go after everything what I need without seeing that it's not part of the word of God and I I I I can call myself a religious cuz I can give my tith I can give everything I can I can give money to help anybody I'm thinking that I'm thinking I'm doing good is and doing good cannot take you to heaven this message that time when I went there I was in those places I baptized in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost it couldn't help me by the time when God open my understanding and the pastor baptized me immersed me in the water my I I became a different person I never be the same I can I can hear the voice of God when something happen to me or anything when I pray brothers and sisters and those who are watching on the line I can give a testimony right here from all night since God took hold of me that I myself will tell you I have nothing to do with that by is by the grace of God because I cannot dream a dream by myself Hallelujah the reason why I'm I'm saying this sometime when we mention brother Braham people think we mention his name too much and we worship him we don't worship brother Braham we we worship who the Lord Jesus Christ he is only one God he died on the cross and save my soul without him I cannot do nothing and the Bible says everything to be a Christian everything that you do do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he is only one true God hallelujah I mention brother BR name because because he was the prophet the last message that that has to be on the earth before the Rapture is William Maron Braham and God has destinated this Prophet for a special people and nobody cannot give it to you you have to take it by the Holy Ghost himself I couldn't take it I came in and I went out was it my time when the time come it's like death when when Dev rattle your throat you cannot say I won't go you will go because you already hand you yeah you no matter what you did you're going to go you it doesn't matter how much you Ratt your your neck and everything he can do everything your time you can go salvation where salvation God you hear the word of God is part of you is something in you that you do not understand but you could hear from your heart this is real this is real this is real it because it's part of you you cannot say I don't need the hand or I don't need the leg I don't need the nose it's part of your body the word of God is a spiritual food as you eat every day to sustain this life that you walking every day go to work and come back home you don't eat you have no power you have no strength to do nothing so if you don't Fe the spirit of God that is in you you have no strength you have no power to do them if you get close to the word of God and you understand it's sweeter than anything in the world so sweet why sometime you started praying in the night in the bid of n tears started dripping from your eye you can't stop you not crying because you lost something because there's a special joy that gri your soul you know that you know how hallelujah amen I I I've heard that before so many times you know as I was talking about Moses God brought the same way God brought Moses out to lead the children of Israel the same way God in this last days he has brought williiam maram Braham to lead his bride out from lordia he hold Satan throat Let My People Go [Applause] Hallelujah glory to God and when and when and let me tell you when Moses was leading the children of Israel he has the false ones there Moses brushed them could you imagine God himself give Moses a staff say go and display to Pharaoh he went there he throw the the the stick down and that sck 10 what a snake and Pharaoh said you are you are you are you you you you you're cheap magician trick he call his people come on let's go he throw the S and he turned to a snake too and Moses start trembling my is my is that my chip and then he was standing there he saw his Sak swallow up those magician snake and what did he do he pick it up Hallelujah glory to God Satan is on under our feet no matter what it does because God has swallowed him up he me the Holy Ghost has swallowed him up amen and meanwhile why Moses was doing this there was a false one that called bam that was with him Hallelujah bam you want me to read a little bit about bam let me read about bam Numbers 22 chapter 5 today we going to cuz I want you I want you to see about how this people Satan we talking about the false and we talking about the true God that we worship numbers numbers uh 22 uh five let's start from five he sent Messengers therefore unto ba am the son of Bo to uh per which is by the river of the land of the children of of his people call him saying behold there is a people coming out from Egypt behold they cover the face of the Earth and they abide over against me come now therefore I pray thee these are the people of uh the the the the hitte and all those people the Egyptians and all the the enemies have GED together to come against Moses so they need a help Hallelujah come now therefore I pray the C curse me these people who they want to do they want bam to C God people hallelujah for they are too Mighty for me pre Adventure I shall Prevail that we may smile them or that I may drive them out of the land i w that he he whom thou breast is breast and he whom thou has cured is cursed remember this bam was a true Prophet was a Jew not a true prophet he was a prophet of God he was anointed he was anointed as that's why I said false Christ he was one of the false Christ he was against Moses because God said what God has bless no man can curse Hallelujah so they tried to use their own Prophet remember this man bam was a prophet of God who God speak to so when the Bible say false he is is he is Anointed with the same Spirit but he cannot take the word of God hallelujah amen and the head of the mo and the Elders of Moab and the Elders of Midian departed with the reward of deinition of their mind and they came unto bam and spake unto him the words of B and he said unto them Lord here this night and I will bring you word again as the Lord shall speak unto me and the princes of Moab Abode with bam and God came unto bam and said what men are these with the remember God came to Bam because he was a prophet Hallelujah so when it say first anointing don't think they are those somebody out there he's inside here he's within the gate Hallelujah and Bam said unto God baac the son of zior King of Moab has sent unto me saying behold there is a a people come out of Egypt which covered the face of the Earth come now and curse me them pray at Venture I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and God said unto bam thou shall not go with them any time the false one he will not listen why he will not listen because he is looking for a favor for himself he's doing everything for himself he's not doing he does not listen to God he does not want to subject himself unto God if your son of God a child of God you have to subject you have to subjection unto the Lord Jesus Christ then God can use you Hallelujah let's see what bam has and and said to ba baam thou shall not go with them they shall not thou shall not curse the people for for they are blessed God told them they are blessed are you blessed tonight nobody can put a curse on you you are blessed when God you blessed nobody can curse you Hallelujah that's why you have to know who you are and when the time come when you need to speak speak the word of God hallelujah and Bam rose up in the morning answer unto the prin B get get get you into your land for the Lord refuses to give me leave to go with you and the prince of Moab rose up and they went unto baac and said Bam Bam refuse to come with me come with us and baac sent with baac s yet again princes more and they honor than they and they came to Bam and said unto him thus said baac the son of zior let nothing I pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me for I will promote thee unto very great honor you understand so these false people they work for their gain for their own gain they work for their own belly they work for their own money they don't take they don't they don't preach the word of God for the children's affair they they preach so that they can get something for themselves Hallelujah and Bam answered and said unto the servant of baac if baac will give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my my God to do less or more now therefore I pray you tell you also here this night that I may know what the Lord will say unto me more because now you see more money God speak once so he has to go to God twice to please to God let me go you see [Music] Hallelujah and bail up rose up in the morning and saded his eyes and went to the prince of Moab and God God's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for H the uh adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servant were with him and and the AR saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his saw drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside on out of the way and went into the field and Bam smold the ass and turn her into the way but the angel of the Lord stood in the part of the vineyard a war being his side and a war on the side and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord he thrusted herself into the wall and crashed bam foot against the wall and he was and smoke he smoke her again what did he do he he he just went there and put his leg and rubbed the leg on the wall so the guy get hurt so he was really mad Hallelujah Heen our God is good could you imagine if you're Son of God and you're doing wrong God will War you if you don't listen you will pay the price it doesn't matter who you are God have no respect of man he has respect of his word hallelujah so let us live according to the word of God if God reach Mercy have called us let us dedicate ourself and submit everything to the Lord Jesus Christ he will provide everything for you he will do everything for you you are already blessed never mind how much you seek just pray and have faith if God will never help you God raised dead if God can raise dead you are little sick God cannot heal you if you trust in him oh Hallelujah we have God Amen and the angel of the Lord went further and stood in the narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or the left and when the eyes saw the angel of the Lord you see God blind him he blinded the prophet could you imagine he speak with God but he can't see him because why he failed to listen to the word of God he didn't listen that's the way people get into trouble you don't listen to the word of God you get into trouble then you started blaming everybody you started blaming your aunt your mother your grandmother your sister your brother everywhere your pastor your Deacon Myco didn't call me my this didn't call me why they abandon me because you did not listen let me tell tell you every time you doing something wrong God speak to you you have to ignore that you have to ignore that little voice before you can go on to do it and when okay and when the I saw the angel of the Lord he fell down under bam and Bam anger was kindered and he Smo the ass with a staff you know what is the staff the stick Hallelujah and the Lord opened the mouth of the eyes could you imagine Hallelujah glory and he said unto bam what have I done unto thee that thou has smitten me this three times could you imagine and Bam said unto the as because thou has mocked me now the ass and Bam started talking Hallelujah if you disobey God you become L anyal Hallelujah and I would Mo me I would thereare I would there were a sword in my hand for now I would I would now would I kill would I kill the and the as said unto bam I am not dying as I am not thy ass upon which thou Hast ridden ever since I was thine I was D into this day was I ever want to do so unto thee and he said no the eyes is talking e h then the Lord opened the eyes of bam and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and he saw drawn in his hand and he bowed down his said and fell flat on his face could you imagine false prophet could you imagine those false prophet is only there is here everyone is here and those Prophet false prophet is not outside there is right beside you that's why you have to follow your Shepherd your Shepherd will lead you don't look here and look here and look here you're going to get into trouble and when you get into trouble is your Shepherd fault no God said I will give you Shepherd will he has already promised and give you so if you go out of your own way whose fault is that it's you not me it's not a Shepherd it's not a pastor Hallelujah brother said follow your pastor he will lead you through hallelujah thank you Lord bam he end up speaking with donkey let's go to Second Kings I give you another sample today we're going to read a little bit are you are you you don't mind right God we I want to show you about three samples first king 22 four and he said unto yaphet will thou go with me to the battle this is this is Ahab and Je Jeth was a king of Judah I think I think it was a king of Judah or Samaria and he said unto jaset will thou go with me to the batt of rot girad and Je said unto the Kings of Israel I am I am as Thou Art my people is thy people my hor is thy hor and Je said said unto the king of Israel inquire I pray thee at the word of the Lord today then the king the king of Israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men how he get so much 400 men because he trained them for his own benefit not for the benefit of God that's where you going to get from now we have a bunch of the prophets and teachers and pastors out there where they go seminaries to learn for the benefit of who the government and who the Pope the Catholic church for their own benefits they are not benefit what for the word of God because why they train they train them how to be don't you know that when they build a a a a a unit or maybe what do they call when they building the houses how did they how did they call it uh when they building the house they come here and gr and build houses a community right away the Govern will tell them to build a church over there to build a church over there they know the church they name the church the people conscious they believe but they beged do you understand they beged by these ministers denominational Min and they get them and they baptize them the father and the son and Holy Ghost and they will be jumping everywhere when you go over there you say baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they don't believe because why they Ted them because they they belongs to them the same thing this this man Ahab did it because he trained them for the benefit of himself God call his people God call his true Pastor what that's why he said I will give you pastors true pastors true pastors to lead you then what you don't cry no more you're going to be increased your faith going to be increased to what to the word of God you're going to be what safe in the house of the Lord not out there Hallelujah then then the king gather the prophet together about 400 men and said unto them shall I go against R Gilead battle or shall I forbear and they said go up for the Lord shall deliver into thy hands for of the king and Je said is there not here a prophet of the Lord you hear that Jeet was a spiritual man he F he find something wrong all these prophets can all their one their man cannot be one so he said is there no prophet of the Lord here he recognized that they are what false prophet hallelujah thank you Lord and Je said is there not any here with the prophet of the Lord beside the besides that we might inquire him Hallelujah and the king of Israel said unto jeos is there is yet one man Mah the son of imla by whom we may inquire of the Lord but I hate him why hate him because he will speak the word of God no matter what even if he had C of that's this Prophet William Braham that's the prophet that we talking about he is God prophet from the Throne of God perpetrate for the bride of Christ in this last days hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord people made and people may not understand but we are not here to give it to nobody except you open your heart and search it and pray God will give it to you no man can give it to you the the Pastor that God ordained that God said you going to bring to take his people bring his people back to the house of the when they hear that voice because the voice is part of him so they will come so if we preach and you don't understand do not say nothing because we going to go for one more how God going to do Hallelujah I hate him I hate him he I hate him for he do not prophesy good concerning me cuz he wants something that will benefit him the false pastor always wants something that will benefit him he doesn't want to preach the word to your soul because th soul that Sinners shall die and the word of God is is the one who's going to call that soul to heaven so without the word of God how you going to go to heaven somebody has to preach to you the right word hallelujah Glory this gospel is the gospel of the hour Hallelujah and says let the king say say so let let a let not the king say so then the king the king of Israel called an officer and he said hen here Mar the son of imla and the king of Israel the king of Israel je Jeet the king of Judah sat each on his throne having put the robe in the v in a void place in the TR the entrance of the Gate of Samaria and all the prophet prophesy before them and zedekiah that's another false prophet Hallelujah always there two every time God sent a prophet Satan sent his the Lord Jesus Christ was here who was here Judas so there was always to so when if now the Holy Ghost himself as as as as Moses handed the Baton to Joshua so brother will Braham handled the Baton to the bride of Christ because now is the Holy Ghost himself that's the Joshua leading the church right now Hallelujah and josua Joshua Joshua time No Nonsense are you with us are against us hallelujah this is the time when we let me tell you it's
