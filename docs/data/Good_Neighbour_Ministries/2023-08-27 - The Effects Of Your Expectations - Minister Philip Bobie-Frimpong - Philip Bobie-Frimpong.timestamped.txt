[46:18] thank you we give you all the glory and
[46:21] the honor in Jesus name amen
[46:25] I have
[46:27] a couple of scriptures that
[46:29] you're going to be reading back and
[46:30] forth whilst we're going through it
[46:33] so um
[46:34] my first scripture
[46:36] will be taken from second Kings chapter
[46:39] 2 chapter 6 verse 25.
[46:42] and then we're going to read Second
[46:44] Kings seven one
[46:46] Acts
[46:49] um
[46:51] acts 12
[46:55] verse once we they're going to ask we'll
[46:57] act 12 15 first
[46:59] religious couple of scriptures and then
[47:01] was
[47:03] we're going on with a bunch of
[47:05] scriptures
[47:07] so um first one is second case
[47:11] and that was a great farming in Samaria
[47:15] and behold they beseech it
[47:19] until an ass
[47:21] head was sold for
[47:23] CE called pieces of silver
[47:26] and the fourth part of a cup of doves
[47:30] dunk for five pieces of silver if you
[47:33] don't know that dogs dank is like excuse
[47:35] my language pupu of the dog of the dog
[47:38] that's what they were selling for it was
[47:40] so bad over there and then if you read
[47:43] the entire chapter six you read that it
[47:46] was so bad that somebody two people
[47:50] and they agreed to eat their children so
[47:53] one gave her his son or whatever button
[47:55] and they eat that children because it
[47:57] was super I don't have money and then
[47:59] the other one instead of bringing her
[48:01] son he hide it he didn't give the son so
[48:05] that they eat the sun and the King had
[48:07] it and the King rent his clothes and was
[48:10] crying
[48:12] but second Kings chapter 7 verse 1. then
[48:16] Elijah said hear ye the word of the Lord
[48:21] thus said the Lord
[48:23] tomorrow
[48:24] about this time
[48:27] shall a measure of fine flower be sold
[48:30] for a circle
[48:32] and two measures of Bali for a circle in
[48:36] the gate of Samaria
[48:38] then a lot in whose hand
[48:42] the king lean answered the man of God
[48:45] and said behold if the Lord will make
[48:49] Windows in heaven
[48:51] might this thing be
[48:54] and he said behold thou shall see it
[48:56] with thy eyes but Thou shalt not evolve
[48:59] this man was so much consumed with the
[49:03] circumstance around that time
[49:05] and he checked the situation and
[49:09] all that you can see was the five
[49:11] stances so
[49:13] we selling dogs down to eat and
[49:17] pass price has so skyrocketing
[49:20] are you telling me that tomorrow
[49:23] you didn't even say be one month
[49:24] tomorrow
[49:25] you're gonna have abundance of free
[49:27] abundance of food
[49:29] he said no way it can happen because
[49:32] what he is expectation was doubtful so
[49:36] my pick today gonna be effects of
[49:39] expectation and let's read Acts chapter
[49:42] 12 15. then I I'll read back and
[49:45] forthwise you'll be doing it chapter 12
[49:47] 15.
[49:50] and they said unto her thou are mad
[49:54] but she constantly affirmed that it was
[49:56] even so then sad day it is his Angel and
[50:00] this situation is about Peter when he
[50:04] was released from the
[50:06] prison
[50:08] um
[50:09] that time they cut off James head
[50:12] so they were persecution and fear
[50:16] on the people on the disciples
[50:19] so when he was in prison
[50:23] and the damn cell told the disciples
[50:26] that
[50:28] Peter is here they said no he cannot be
[50:30] him
[50:31] even though they prayed
[50:34] and the things was manifested right
[50:36] there
[50:37] they weren't expecting it
[50:39] so just be seated so we're gonna read
[50:43] back and forth so my topic is effects of
[50:45] your expectation
[50:48] amen okay
[50:50] praise God
[50:53] and
[50:54] just to even begin with you get what you
[50:58] expect
[50:59] and today whilst you are here
[51:02] whatever you expect is what you're gonna
[51:05] get if you hear to find something to
[51:09] criticize you'll find a lot of problem
[51:11] to criticize
[51:14] but if you came here with the right
[51:17] mental attitude that when I hear
[51:20] something from God
[51:21] God will speak to your heart so you get
[51:25] what you expect
[51:27] and I'm afraid
[51:30] in the life of the children of Israel
[51:33] when God
[51:35] gave them that sacrifice that sacrifice
[51:38] killing of animals ghosts and all those
[51:41] things
[51:43] I think I ran before he says Christ was
[51:45] born it became it came to a Time
[51:48] that daily sacrifice become became
[51:51] common to them
[51:53] they didn't approach it it became like a
[51:56] tradition
[51:57] so they just bring it and sacrifice they
[52:00] just bring it and sacrifice so there was
[52:02] no sincerity in their worship
[52:06] and I wonder if that same spirit is
[52:09] creeping into the church as times is
[52:12] going as the message is getting longer
[52:14] and longer because when he came in
[52:16] people were expecting the Rapture to
[52:17] happen just like that even myself I
[52:20] wasn't expecting that I'll ever have
[52:22] kids and grow to be teenagers I used to
[52:25] tell people that before the Rapture
[52:27] I'm not going to go through anything
[52:30] these problems deal with my kids because
[52:32] the Rapture is just around the corner
[52:34] and it's just creeping or it's coming
[52:36] and it's coming so what I'm trying to
[52:38] say is that when it takes so long
[52:42] that people become relaxed
[52:45] that's why he said that all the virgins
[52:48] were were asleep
[52:50] because they don't approach it
[52:53] like their first love
[52:56] God wants us to go back to our first
[52:58] love
[52:59] when he was dealing when he came here I
[53:01] couldn't wait to come to service we
[53:03] couldn't wait to Pray by the way brother
[53:05] welcome back from Trinidad we couldn't
[53:08] wait to pray we couldn't wait to get in
[53:11] the house of the Living God But as time
[53:13] goes on it becomes common it's becoming
[53:16] tradition there are some people living
[53:18] it gets so bad that in the night when
[53:20] they're just going to pray oh God bless
[53:22] this one God bless you and then they
[53:24] just sleep it's time that we have to
[53:26] wake up it's time that we have to be
[53:28] serious it's time that you have to come
[53:30] back to the word it's time that you have
[53:32] to come back to what God wants us to do
[53:34] and knock away all the Traditions all
[53:37] the legalism and everything unlike
[53:39] Christ and approach him sincerely
[53:42] because when you're approach him
[53:43] sincerely he will answer your prayer he
[53:46] will come down and vindicate you he will
[53:48] come and be there with you so it's the
[53:50] same yesterday today and forever so our
[53:53] approach is very very important amen
[53:58] praise because so
[54:01] what I'm saying when I'm coming back to
[54:03] my topic as I said before
[54:06] it was if you read that second Kings it
[54:09] was life was very hard
[54:12] it was very tough
[54:14] now
[54:16] um
[54:17] if you compare to our Modern Life it has
[54:21] not been so bad that people are killing
[54:23] people to eat but the economic pressure
[54:26] is creeping slowly is creeping in slurry
[54:30] they increase the interest rates
[54:33] and when they increase the interest
[54:34] rather than said they take money from
[54:37] the system
[54:38] and while the interest rate is up food
[54:41] prices are skyrocketing
[54:43] rent mortgage everything I know someone
[54:47] was paying like 3 000 more they went to
[54:49] six thousand and they have to be go and
[54:52] sell that house and go and what uh rent
[54:56] for four thousand so everything is
[54:58] getting higher and higher and getting
[55:00] economic action remember it's economic
[55:03] pressure religious pressure and
[55:05] political pressure the three combined
[55:07] and put us into schools and they really
[55:09] buy from here but Asbury was saying that
[55:12] that time that as you're getting all
[55:14] this economic pressure and everything
[55:16] let's know you had the trouble believe
[55:18] that God is to be I said be strong and
[55:22] become and know that God is in control
[55:24] let not your heart be troubled by the
[55:28] present conditions don't let your heart
[55:30] be troubled about the economic
[55:32] conditions going on right now just look
[55:36] to God because Jesus Christ is the same
[55:37] yesterday today and forever he's never
[55:41] changed he's the same God hallelujah so
[55:44] if you read down here in Second Kings
[55:46] you see that can you put it on for me
[55:48] Second Kings seven verse one going
[55:50] verse 3 and he said that
[55:54] then there were four lepers
[55:57] men at the entering in of the gate
[56:01] and they said one to another
[56:04] why City
[56:06] we here until we die
[56:10] because if you're in Samaria they say
[56:13] that they are dead
[56:15] but he told them why should we sit here
[56:17] and die
[56:19] and
[56:21] just if you if verse 4 if we say we will
[56:25] enter into the city
[56:27] then the famine is in the city
[56:30] so there was no food in some area
[56:32] they say that there's a farming over
[56:34] there and which I died there
[56:37] and if we sit still here we die also
[56:43] now therefore come
[56:45] and let us fall into the host of The
[56:47] Experience if
[56:50] they save us alive
[56:52] we shall live if they kill us
[56:55] reside that what died so I believe that
[56:59] that was the same thing that Esther came
[57:02] to do he said that if I perish let me
[57:05] perish I'm going to see the king so when
[57:08] desperation sits in it puts you under
[57:11] pressure you got to move you have to
[57:13] make a decision because God is also
[57:15] sometimes waiting on us it's not only
[57:18] God but you have a part to play that's
[57:20] why Joshua said everywhere that your
[57:22] footsteps I have given to you and
[57:25] footsteps is possession possess your
[57:28] possession amen break your footsteps and
[57:31] whatever you have need of God is able to
[57:33] provide for you don't stay still do
[57:36] something real every action brings
[57:39] reaction action that retail is gonna
[57:41] bring reaction so don't stay put and
[57:45] just look at the condition and cry
[57:50] don't look at the circumstances it
[57:54] covers every circumstances it Masters
[57:56] every circumstances so don't look at
[57:59] your circumstances because faith is a
[58:02] substance evidence of things that
[58:05] red substance it's not it's more than
[58:08] things that you can see or taste or feel
[58:10] Faith looks beyond what is wrong it
[58:13] looks beyond that so don't look at your
[58:16] present conditions and see their Idol
[58:18] but believe God's trade act on the word
[58:21] of God and God and God is going to get
[58:24] your reaction because when you act
[58:26] something will happen if you do not have
[58:29] not to happen they said that if you stay
[58:31] here we are dead
[58:32] but if we go maybe they will save us
[58:35] alive if they don't save us life we die
[58:38] we die but we may get something so God
[58:40] expects you to do something do something
[58:43] about the situation at least if you
[58:45] can't do anything just pray and don't
[58:47] only pray you pray and you act that's
[58:50] why in in in
[58:51] Mark 11 23 24 said that
[58:55] When you pray believe
[58:58] don't just only pray
[59:01] ER is the worst the best the most weapon
[59:06] the best weapon that any Christian can
[59:09] use
[59:09] so don't only what Pray when you act on
[59:15] your prayer
[59:16] because believe
[59:19] and act of date
[59:21] because if you look at the disciples the
[59:24] thing happened right there that you
[59:26] weren't expecting it
[59:28] this
[59:30] um man here who leaned on the king
[59:33] he wasn't expecting it
[59:35] so tonight this afternoon sorry by the
[59:38] time we leave here at least I wanted to
[59:40] ingrain everybody heart
[59:42] you get what you expect
[59:46] condition your mind that way I expect
[59:49] only good things in my life
[59:51] all the negative things is I it is not
[59:53] for me I reject anything I'm doubting my
[59:56] doubts I'm believing God's word I am
[59:59] accepting his promises because listen he
[1:00:02] died on Calvary everything he gave its
[1:00:04] rest is based on your acceptance even if
[1:00:08] the Lord Jesus Christ were to be here
[1:00:09] this morning this time he can never heal
[1:00:12] you because he has done it already on
[1:00:15] Calvary you have to accept your healing
[1:00:18] you have to accept your Financial
[1:00:19] Freedom you have to accept everything
[1:00:21] you have need of because without you
[1:00:24] accepting it you can never get it amen
[1:00:27] every self and awesome God his name is
[1:00:30] the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he
[1:00:32] never lost a battle amen praise God I'm
[1:00:35] trying to say that what that Prophet
[1:00:38] said
[1:00:39] it came to pass let's continue with the
[1:00:42] second things
[1:00:48] and they rose up in the Twilight
[1:00:51] to go into the camp of the syrians and
[1:00:54] when they were come to the outermost
[1:00:55] part of the camp of Syria behold there
[1:00:57] was no man there for the Lord had made
[1:01:01] the host of the syrians to hear a noise
[1:01:04] of Terrors and a noise
[1:01:07] of horses even the noise of great hosts
[1:01:10] and they stepped onto another load the
[1:01:13] king of Israel
[1:01:15] had hired against us the king of the
[1:01:18] hectis and the kings of the Egyptians so
[1:01:22] come upon us wherefore they are rose and
[1:01:25] fled the Twilight
[1:01:26] and left their fence and their horses
[1:01:30] and their asses even their Camp as it
[1:01:32] was and fled for their life
[1:01:36] and when the lepers came to the
[1:01:38] outermost part of the camp they went
[1:01:41] into one tent
[1:01:43] and did eat and drink
[1:01:45] and carried Hands Held silver and gold
[1:01:48] and Raymond and went and hide it and
[1:01:50] came again and entered
[1:01:53] into another tent and carry things also
[1:01:56] and wet and hide it
[1:01:58] they said to another we do not well this
[1:02:01] day is a day of good tidings
[1:02:04] and we hold our peace if we carry till
[1:02:07] the morning light some Mischief will
[1:02:09] come upon us now therefore come that we
[1:02:12] may go and tell the king's household in
[1:02:14] other words
[1:02:15] try to say that don't be selfish
[1:02:19] don't live for yourself a Christian life
[1:02:22] is to live for others the Lord came and
[1:02:24] shared his blood for us he came and
[1:02:27] lived for us so whatever you have you
[1:02:29] have to live for others don't obey be
[1:02:31] selfish when you get something if God
[1:02:33] placed in your heart bless people with
[1:02:35] it support his kingdom why do you want
[1:02:38] to be prospered if your motive is just
[1:02:40] for yourself and selfish need you won't
[1:02:42] get it but if the motive is to what
[1:02:44] support the kingdom and support
[1:02:47] missionaries and let the work of God
[1:02:49] then God will back you up because he
[1:02:52] knows your Motif is right and your
[1:02:54] objective is right your attitude is
[1:02:56] right yes I'm not saying I don't live
[1:02:58] inheritance for your children there was
[1:03:00] almost a wise man lived inheritance for
[1:03:02] his children listen for your family they
[1:03:05] support God's work support the
[1:03:07] missionaries play your side be faithful
[1:03:10] and God will bless you how he's going to
[1:03:13] bless you I don't know but you take care
[1:03:15] of you he's gonna take care of you
[1:03:17] because it's the same yes yesterday
[1:03:19] today and forever amen
[1:03:23] verse 11 and he called the apostas
[1:03:27] then said okay so verse 10. so they came
[1:03:31] and called to the port of the city and
[1:03:33] they told them saying we came to the
[1:03:35] camp of the syrians and behold there was
[1:03:38] no man there
[1:03:39] voice of man the horses tied
[1:03:43] and asked us tied and they test us the
[1:03:47] way and he called the protest and they
[1:03:50] said and they told you to the King's
[1:03:52] house within and the King arose in the
[1:03:55] night and said unto his servants I will
[1:03:59] not show you what the students have done
[1:04:00] to us they know that we be hungry
[1:04:03] therefore are they gone out of the camp
[1:04:06] to hide themselves in their fields
[1:04:07] seeing when they come out of the city we
[1:04:10] shall guide them alive and get into the
[1:04:12] city we see why the King was who was
[1:04:14] thinking he wasn't expecting nothing so
[1:04:16] when even guten is coming to him he's a
[1:04:19] thinking negative that's why some people
[1:04:22] even when people are saying certain
[1:04:23] things they don't know the motive behind
[1:04:25] what they are saying right away they got
[1:04:27] the negative aspect of what they are
[1:04:29] saying we have to be positive and know
[1:04:32] that being a son or daughter of God
[1:04:34] nothing that nothing everything that
[1:04:37] comes to your life God permit it
[1:04:40] Satan cannot do nothing unless he even
[1:04:43] seek permission from God himself so
[1:04:46] anything that comes to you they send him
[1:04:48] back a lemon out of your lemonade make a
[1:04:52] lemonade out of your lemon so anything
[1:04:54] that comes to you look it in a positive
[1:04:57] way because all is well everything gonna
[1:05:00] turn out to Gold not everything that
[1:05:03] comes to our life is good that is going
[1:05:04] to turn out to good sometimes it's God
[1:05:06] trying your faith sometimes God allows
[1:05:09] some people to step on your toes to see
[1:05:11] how he's going to react he allow all
[1:05:14] those circumstances to come to your life
[1:05:15] to see your reaction so just take things
[1:05:18] the way they are and believe God don't
[1:05:21] be negative I don't like to be around
[1:05:23] negative people you got to be positive
[1:05:26] positive minded towards every promise of
[1:05:29] God because the king wasn't expecting
[1:05:32] nothing so when the news came he was
[1:05:35] still thinking negative oh they have
[1:05:38] Trappers oh they're going to do this
[1:05:39] they are going oh if we do this oh this
[1:05:43] thing will come on you that will come on
[1:05:44] you but they won't think about the
[1:05:46] positive part
[1:05:48] so God is telling them because human
[1:05:49] nature that's the way right these five
[1:05:52] senses but the word of God goes beyond
[1:05:55] that amen
[1:05:58] praise our God
[1:06:05] okay I'm not going to read for verse 17
[1:06:07] in the end
[1:06:09] if you read the whole scripture
[1:06:11] everything came as was what expected
[1:06:14] verse 16 and the people went out and
[1:06:17] spoiled a tense of the syrians so a
[1:06:20] measure
[1:06:22] of fine Flora
[1:06:24] was sold for a circle
[1:06:27] and two measures of the valley
[1:06:29] for a circle according to what the word
[1:06:32] of God that means that the word of God
[1:06:34] will not come avoid unless accomplish
[1:06:37] what it was what thankful amen so God's
[1:06:41] word will come to pass regardless of the
[1:06:44] circumstances regardless of what is
[1:06:46] going on God's will will come to pass
[1:06:49] amen and the prophecy came from because
[1:06:53] the one that doubted it he died and he
[1:06:57] came to pass that the man of God spoken
[1:06:59] has spoken the king saying two measures
[1:07:02] of baling for a circle and measure of
[1:07:05] fine flow of seconds I'll be tomorrow
[1:07:07] about this time in the gate and the Lord
[1:07:09] answered the man of God and said now
[1:07:11] behold if the Lord
[1:07:13] to open make Windows in heaven my search
[1:07:18] attendee
[1:07:19] and he said behold thou shall see you
[1:07:22] thine eyes that shall not what eat
[1:07:25] thereof and so it felt
[1:07:27] it felt unto him for the people thrown
[1:07:30] upon him in the gate and he died if you
[1:07:33] read the whole scripture he was the one
[1:07:35] that he was the king told him to be in
[1:07:37] charge
[1:07:38] so he saw it he really enjoy it because
[1:07:41] what he doubted
[1:07:43] so the Bible the Bible said doubt your
[1:07:47] doubt believe God's word it takes more
[1:07:51] strength to doubt than to even to
[1:07:53] believe it's easier to believe than to
[1:07:56] doubt is that if you say to this
[1:07:59] mountain be thou removed and do not
[1:08:01] doubt in your heart but believe that
[1:08:04] what you have said will come to pass you
[1:08:07] sir have what you said it's a promise to
[1:08:11] the believer if you say to this Martin
[1:08:13] whatever you say you can even go and
[1:08:16] Live Another Mountain for yourself you
[1:08:17] can speak your own word and living in
[1:08:20] that case believe those things is
[1:08:22] available it's not a history it's not a
[1:08:25] myth he's the same yesterday to them
[1:08:27] forever there is nothing that God cannot
[1:08:30] do he can open Windows of Heaven to all
[1:08:33] to bless whatever he wants he can do it
[1:08:35] is God because these people they forgot
[1:08:38] that the same God When the Children of
[1:08:41] Israel didn't have food he Reign manner
[1:08:44] from Heaven God can do everything why
[1:08:46] did he tell the prophet's word
[1:08:48] because what unbelief
[1:08:51] we have some people they can never
[1:08:53] believe
[1:08:54] we have some people they make believe
[1:08:56] they try to believe
[1:08:58] but we have some people naturally they
[1:09:01] don't do nothing they can they just
[1:09:03] believe
[1:09:04] that is what is it's what they see it in
[1:09:07] there has nothing because in their soul
[1:09:09] is either Faith or doubt
[1:09:12] so if their faith is already it
[1:09:14] naturally believe God's word it doesn't
[1:09:16] force it doesn't push it doesn't do
[1:09:19] anything it's naturally believe God's
[1:09:21] word
[1:09:22] but you have a choice
[1:09:26] for Abraham
[1:09:28] Abraham believed he started not at the
[1:09:31] promise of God but he was constantly
[1:09:34] giving praise he didn't look at his
[1:09:37] condition as 75 years old my big promise
[1:09:40] to have a child and and the wife is 60
[1:09:44] years but if he looks at the doctor's
[1:09:47] report you would have doubted it but he
[1:09:50] never looked at a doctor's report he
[1:09:52] didn't look at his condition but he
[1:09:55] trusted God's word and even though a
[1:09:58] terrorists it came to pass so even
[1:10:01] though the reason a terrorists to come
[1:10:04] to pass whatever promise that God has
[1:10:07] given you if thou can't believe it will
[1:10:10] come to pass whatever God this afternoon
[1:10:12] is needing your heart to believe just
[1:10:15] believe it and you come to pass it
[1:10:18] doesn't matter how it lingers that's how
[1:10:21] much how you see the circumstances go
[1:10:24] beyond the circumstances believe God's
[1:10:27] word if God could send
[1:10:30] Elijah is the man like we are passion
[1:10:33] and pray that should not Reign three and
[1:10:36] a half years and didn't happen what
[1:10:37] about you and me that was even beyond
[1:10:39] the calvary whatever you have need of
[1:10:42] just believe
[1:10:44] just trust God don't listen to the um
[1:10:47] those lots of voices that is that is
[1:10:51] saying that it cannot happen With God
[1:10:53] all things are possible amen praise our
[1:10:57] wonderful God Amen praise God hallelujah
[1:11:01] so I am
[1:11:03] and I'm gonna go back to the book of
[1:11:04] Acts chapter 12.
[1:11:07] from verse 1.
[1:11:10] now about the time
[1:11:13] Herod the king stress forth his sons to
[1:11:16] Vex certain of the church
[1:11:19] and he killed
[1:11:22] James the brother of John with the sword
[1:11:25] that put fears in the Believers
[1:11:29] um
[1:11:30] believer's heart and because he saw a
[1:11:33] place the Jews he proceeded further to
[1:11:35] take Peter also so when the thing
[1:11:38] happened
[1:11:40] the disciples were scared
[1:11:44] because he took James head and then
[1:11:47] he took Peter also
[1:11:49] then
[1:11:51] were the days of unleavened bread and
[1:11:53] when he had appointed him he put him in
[1:11:55] prison
[1:11:56] and deliver him to what
[1:11:58] four continuous of soldiers to keep him
[1:12:02] intended after he started to bring him
[1:12:03] forth to the people so his intention was
[1:12:06] to kill Peter but I believe that Peter
[1:12:09] wasn't scared because the Lord has told
[1:12:12] him that he's gonna be an old man
[1:12:14] so even though Peter himself it doesn't
[1:12:17] matter what that Herod was doing he knew
[1:12:20] that he wasn't old yet so he didn't care
[1:12:23] he wasn't scared but verse five Peter
[1:12:26] therefore was kept in prison but what
[1:12:28] prayer was made without season of the
[1:12:32] church unto God for him amen we have a
[1:12:36] prayer team
[1:12:37] prayer Was Made For That season they
[1:12:41] prayed
[1:12:42] they prayed and when we pray we have and
[1:12:46] get an answer so if prayer will bring
[1:12:49] God down why don't you pray pray pray
[1:12:52] amen pray and prayer will bring God's
[1:12:56] anointing down it will change
[1:12:57] circumstances changes one time prayer
[1:13:01] was even able to change God's mind you
[1:13:04] say yes yes God does not change his mind
[1:13:07] but
[1:13:11] when the Prophet The Prophet went to him
[1:13:14] and told him that you have 15 more years
[1:13:16] to believe
[1:13:17] is that you have to prepare your house
[1:13:20] to die he said that he prayed and said I
[1:13:24] want 15 more years and God let the
[1:13:27] prophet go back I said I gave you 15
[1:13:29] years why it's a prayer that changed
[1:13:32] everything so prayer is the the biggest
[1:13:36] weapon every Christian can have
[1:13:39] so pray pray in your heart everywhere
[1:13:43] you're going you don't have to be just
[1:13:45] in your room you don't have every
[1:13:48] situation Pro over it
[1:13:49] I was reading the um was saying that if
[1:13:54] you face with a situation and you don't
[1:13:56] know how to act
[1:13:59] just be neutral and prayed because he
[1:14:03] deals in the form of vision but not all
[1:14:06] of us have the ability to have those
[1:14:09] Visions so he said that when you are
[1:14:11] confronted with a situation and you
[1:14:13] don't know which way to take the left or
[1:14:15] right you prayed but whilst you're
[1:14:18] praying don't take be neutral
[1:14:21] and wants to continue to pray wherever
[1:14:23] you leaning more towards that's why we
[1:14:26] have to work go because if you are
[1:14:28] praying with a neutral attitude he gonna
[1:14:31] reveal it to you and you're gonna get a
[1:14:33] clear cut so pray pray and you're gonna
[1:14:37] get your answer hallelujah amen
[1:14:43] and then verse 6. and when Herod would
[1:14:47] have brought him forth the same night
[1:14:49] Peter was sleeping
[1:14:52] Between Two Soldiers
[1:14:54] banned with Chase are you banned with
[1:14:57] chains of circumstances this afternoon
[1:14:59] amen and they keep us before the door
[1:15:02] kept freezing and behold the angel of
[1:15:05] the Lord came upon him in a light sign
[1:15:07] in the prison and spot Peter on the side
[1:15:11] and raise the map saying I Rise up
[1:15:13] quickly and his chains fell off from his
[1:15:16] hands amen with seven and living God
[1:15:20] that those prisoners did not see
[1:15:23] anything an angel of God went to the
[1:15:26] prison and said Peter free that same God
[1:15:31] is here this afternoon whatever
[1:15:33] circumstances that you are training he's
[1:15:35] able to cut it off he can take any
[1:15:39] channel circumstances from you because
[1:15:41] it's the same yesterday today and
[1:15:44] forever I blessed your name that sounds
[1:15:46] that are in the middle of life you find
[1:15:48] yourself in a Praying the prison of your
[1:15:51] mind reach out and defy those shares in
[1:15:54] Jesus name amen defile those things in
[1:15:57] Jesus name amen because that chain of
[1:16:00] second the angel of God
[1:16:01] came and delivered Peter from there and
[1:16:06] Herod if you read the whole thing he
[1:16:07] became puff up
[1:16:09] and God let him die
[1:16:12] because what he he wanted he went you
[1:16:15] went afarov but that's what happened so
[1:16:18] back the Believers that time I believe
[1:16:21] that they were doubting they weren't
[1:16:25] expecting because the church was infancy
[1:16:27] that's what has happened that's what the
[1:16:29] Holy Ghost came they're having all those
[1:16:30] financial happening in their life and
[1:16:32] then they prayed and you read the entire
[1:16:37] verse 15
[1:16:39] and when she knew Peter's voice she
[1:16:41] opened not the gate for gladness the
[1:16:43] lady was so happy when she saw that God
[1:16:47] has answered their prayer
[1:16:49] little Maid she was so happy to hear
[1:16:54] that God prayer had been answered he was
[1:16:57] rejoicing and he forgot she forgotten
[1:17:00] herself to reopen the door to let you
[1:17:02] tell him amen sometimes when God assess
[1:17:06] your prayer the joy that comes in your
[1:17:08] heart the happiness that come with faith
[1:17:11] is inexplicable when God assess the
[1:17:14] situation sometimes he gets into a place
[1:17:16] that you don't have nowhere to turn but
[1:17:19] God comes in and solve it and bring
[1:17:22] Joyce in your heart you bring happiness
[1:17:24] in your heart you can't explain it but
[1:17:27] become happiness because what God has
[1:17:29] done it it's a paradise we cannot
[1:17:32] explain it but it happened amen how can
[1:17:35] you explain me scientifically prove to
[1:17:38] me somebody who chain abound in a prison
[1:17:41] with um two people guiding him and then
[1:17:44] nobody saw him and then he disappeared
[1:17:47] and the King came they checked
[1:17:48] everything was locked scientifically
[1:17:50] proved to me you can't prove it
[1:17:52] scientifically because my God swear
[1:17:54] cannot representative proof prove to me
[1:17:56] how Joshua could say stand stand still
[1:17:58] and the stands true still you come and
[1:18:01] prove it to me scientifically Moses the
[1:18:04] boy and who was so scientifically minded
[1:18:07] and he teached the Egyptians even their
[1:18:09] own language and everything that sounds
[1:18:11] like you can't improve that burning
[1:18:14] books how that boost was what burning
[1:18:17] and then it was that that it was banned
[1:18:19] what it was Banning is that right and
[1:18:22] there was no fight the fire fire was
[1:18:24] burning there was no thing over there
[1:18:26] you can't stand to carry prove God we
[1:18:29] believe God
[1:18:30] because certain things that happens the
[1:18:32] doctors even can understand it that is
[1:18:35] done by the hand of the Living God
[1:18:37] that's the God that you are serving this
[1:18:39] afternoon this name is the Lord Jesus
[1:18:42] Christ he's never lost a battle he said
[1:18:45] I'll be with you even in you until the
[1:18:47] consideration of the time he is with you
[1:18:49] this afternoon he will never forsake you
[1:18:52] not leave you no matter what comes my
[1:18:54] way my God my life is in his hand no
[1:18:57] matter what circumstances my life is the
[1:19:00] hand of Jesus Christ he is my savior
[1:19:02] He's My Redeemer he's my everything he
[1:19:05] loves me oh how I love Jesus because he
[1:19:08] first loved me the love of God is beyond
[1:19:11] a measure he said that us and you shall
[1:19:14] receive as abundantly so that your joy
[1:19:17] may become full the same phrase when I
[1:19:20] ask for that little thing that same
[1:19:21] faith can believe for big things he said
[1:19:24] that when you go to the supernatural you
[1:19:26] say you can't exhaust God's goodness is
[1:19:28] that right you can never exhaust his
[1:19:30] good this amen imagine that face said
[1:19:33] that he's gonna drink a small amount of
[1:19:35] water from the ocean it doesn't make
[1:19:37] sense
[1:19:38] because you can't limit God resources he
[1:19:41] said that I will give you a band that
[1:19:42] more than what you shall even desire
[1:19:44] even your heart is thinking I'll do it
[1:19:47] abundantly that's the god that we are
[1:19:49] saving he's done answering prayer God he
[1:19:52] said God that loves her he said God that
[1:19:54] answers prayer he never change he's the
[1:19:58] same yesterday today and forever
[1:20:01] Hallelujah God is awesome
[1:20:03] amen what almighty God will say
[1:20:07] thank you Jesus amen
[1:20:10] Hallelujah and that person that was in
[1:20:14] prison
[1:20:15] was Paul
[1:20:18] Paul and Barnabas
[1:20:21] also went to preach
[1:20:23] and they were in prison
[1:20:26] if you read I think ask
[1:20:29] chapter 16 verse 25 to 28.
[1:20:35] and at midnight
[1:20:38] Paul and Silas parade
[1:20:42] and sang Praises unto God
[1:20:45] and the prisons heard them
[1:20:48] and suddenly
[1:20:50] there arose a great earthquake
[1:20:53] so that the foundations of the prison
[1:20:56] was shaking
[1:20:58] and immediately all the doors were open
[1:21:02] and every once band will lose
[1:21:06] and the keepers of the prison
[1:21:09] are working out of his sleep and saying
[1:21:13] the prison doors open
[1:21:16] he drew his thought
[1:21:19] and would have killed himself
[1:21:21] suppose that the prison had been fled
[1:21:24] but Paul cried out
[1:21:27] saying do thyself no harm we are all
[1:21:31] here if you read down the road that's
[1:21:34] Supernatural a graved that man's heart
[1:21:37] to such a sense that him and his whole
[1:21:40] household believe Paul and Sarah's in
[1:21:42] the oil they were saved and that same
[1:21:45] God is here he can do those Financial in
[1:21:48] your life if you consecrate yourself
[1:21:50] because Paul in Philemon he talks about
[1:21:53] also a prisoner of Christ it's a
[1:21:55] different kind of prison that he's
[1:21:57] talking about that prisoner of Christ
[1:21:59] let me read this quotation here in the
[1:22:02] um
[1:22:02] in the it's called prison
[1:22:06] that's a different kind of prison
[1:22:12] but before
[1:22:25] and I would like to make this statement
[1:22:28] that God always
[1:22:30] has to take any man that was heaving
[1:22:33] truly
[1:22:35] to be his prisoner
[1:22:37] a man has to surrender
[1:22:40] every ambition
[1:22:43] he is God
[1:22:45] everything
[1:22:47] that is yes everything his life
[1:22:51] soul and body
[1:22:54] will Ambitions and everything else and
[1:22:58] become a complete prisoner to Christ
[1:23:03] who is the word to serve God
[1:23:06] you might have to walk contrary to your
[1:23:09] better judgment
[1:23:11] maybe in a certain organization you
[1:23:14] might think that they could lift you up
[1:23:16] and give you something great
[1:23:18] that you might Flash
[1:23:21] but what do you find yourself you find
[1:23:24] yourself defeated after a while until
[1:23:26] God can get a man that is willing to
[1:23:30] become a prisoner to him
[1:23:33] God is looking for
[1:23:35] prisoners
[1:23:39] he's always done it
[1:23:41] you might search it through the
[1:23:43] scripture a man has to be a prisoner to
[1:23:46] Christ
[1:23:48] against anything
[1:23:50] therefore you cannot be connected with
[1:23:53] anything by Christ
[1:23:56] even your father your mother your
[1:23:59] brother your sister your husband your
[1:24:03] wife anybody you are only connected with
[1:24:06] Christ and him only
[1:24:09] then God can use you until then you
[1:24:13] can't so that if you follow me deny
[1:24:16] yourself
[1:24:17] and other Apostles Peter and the rest
[1:24:19] Peter said we have forsaken mother
[1:24:21] father and the world and follow you what
[1:24:25] shall we got in return he said there's
[1:24:27] no one that has left mother father
[1:24:29] sister and follow me that will not be
[1:24:31] blessed in this world and they were the
[1:24:34] world to come so
[1:24:36] that's they're following of Christ
[1:24:38] called for forsaken he called for
[1:24:41] surrounding I'm not saying that ignore
[1:24:43] them or don't take care of them but when
[1:24:45] it comes to everything God has to be
[1:24:48] first
[1:24:49] he has to be priority over my wife over
[1:24:52] my children God has to be first in other
[1:24:55] circumstances then your family and the
[1:24:57] rest I'm not saying that ignore them the
[1:25:00] way I'm trying to say that they
[1:25:02] sometimes if they have to be a stumbling
[1:25:04] block you have to choose Christ
[1:25:09] support them the person that you came
[1:25:11] but don't let them be in your way of
[1:25:14] serving God
[1:25:16] because if you do that I cannot serve
[1:25:18] God
[1:25:19] God wants people who are separatists and
[1:25:22] Abraham cannot even be blessed until he
[1:25:24] separate himself from from lot
[1:25:27] because he took all those garbage those
[1:25:30] baggage with him God called Abraham
[1:25:32] alone but Abraham didn't want to go by
[1:25:36] himself he'd take his dad and God let
[1:25:39] the dad died he took his nephew and it
[1:25:44] their future has given me a lot of
[1:25:46] trouble that he has to separate himself
[1:25:48] from his nephew until he separate
[1:25:50] himself then God said look the Stars and
[1:25:55] bless you all your Defenders and
[1:25:56] everything so God's word called for
[1:25:59] total separation from unbelief
[1:26:01] unbelieving is right because there is
[1:26:04] only one thing unbelief in God's word
[1:26:06] it's Faith or unbelief amen so he's
[1:26:10] calling us
[1:26:11] to separate us from every trace of
[1:26:15] unbelief
[1:26:16] amen and if you look
[1:26:20] all those men that serve God
[1:26:24] were separatists
[1:26:27] Joseph was put in prison
[1:26:30] before he could become who he was and in
[1:26:34] prison
[1:26:36] when you are in prison you secluded you
[1:26:39] are confined
[1:26:41] you don't have a choice you follow the
[1:26:43] instructions so it's a true Christian
[1:26:45] without your yourself you can follow it
[1:26:48] to Jesus his leadership that's why I
[1:26:51] want God's way to be my way amen no
[1:26:54] matter what I want God's will to be my
[1:26:57] way amen even though the road be rough
[1:27:00] and steep but he needs me I will follow
[1:27:04] because I want God's way to be my way
[1:27:07] God's way is the best
[1:27:09] even though it's not easy because a
[1:27:13] Christian work is not enough Larry Bird
[1:27:15] of is
[1:27:17] but we have to follow
[1:27:19] you have no choice you have come this
[1:27:22] far he didn't bring us this far to leave
[1:27:24] us he didn't bring us this party for
[1:27:26] seconds you're gonna take us through
[1:27:29] sister let's believe God let's trust God
[1:27:32] and confide to him and let him lead us
[1:27:36] let us surrender all our Ambitions all
[1:27:39] our world and put under Jesus feet he
[1:27:41] will guide us and direct us for his
[1:27:44] perfect world sometimes if the road
[1:27:47] seems to be so rough things seems to be
[1:27:49] not happening you look at circumstances
[1:27:51] you give up
[1:27:52] but never give up
[1:27:54] never give up press on press on press on
[1:27:59] if you only know what awaits for you
[1:28:02] you're gonna press down don't give up
[1:28:04] don't ever give up
[1:28:06] pressed on the mask called The High
[1:28:08] Calling he's calling you to that level
[1:28:10] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:28:13] forever amen praise our God our God is
[1:28:17] Awesome
[1:28:18] hallelujah amen so don't ever give up
[1:28:24] and another person that was a prisoner
[1:28:27] was also Moses
[1:28:29] Moses
[1:28:32] was highly educated
[1:28:35] he could teach all the first and
[1:28:37] everything
[1:28:38] but he tried
[1:28:40] to deliver the children of Israel by his
[1:28:42] own Mighty hand
[1:28:44] with all his uh intellectual things
[1:28:49] but it did not work
[1:28:51] so God has to take him to the desert for
[1:28:54] 40 years
[1:28:56] for him to be a prisoner to God's word
[1:28:58] and when God knock at every nonsense he
[1:29:01] has learned from Pharaoh's house and all
[1:29:04] those things that he became a candidate
[1:29:06] to be used and when he got there he was
[1:29:08] so weak
[1:29:09] that
[1:29:11] he thought that he has to use my sins
[1:29:14] and everything to deliver the people he
[1:29:17] said what can I do how am I going to do
[1:29:19] it he said what is it in your hand so
[1:29:21] what do you have in your hand this
[1:29:23] afternoon whatever you have surrendered
[1:29:26] to God and when Moses surrounded that
[1:29:28] that thing to God it was able to do the
[1:29:31] work just a little stick and he did the
[1:29:34] work just like David he asked what that
[1:29:38] five Souls that took care of Goliath a
[1:29:41] thing that it's all it's not the souls
[1:29:45] by the faith behind the man who was
[1:29:47] using it who was behind that Stones the
[1:29:51] Lord Jesus Christ he's the same
[1:29:53] yesterday today and forever amen praise
[1:29:57] our God our God is good he's an awesome
[1:30:00] God you are blessed to have the Lord
[1:30:03] Jesus Christ in our midst when the
[1:30:05] people don't know what they are doing
[1:30:06] from left south and east amen you got
[1:30:09] what you expect because God one time
[1:30:12] revealed to Simon that he was never
[1:30:15] going to die until he see the Messiah
[1:30:17] and Simon all around he was expecting
[1:30:20] the Messiah amen when the time came the
[1:30:23] crisis has led him to the birth of
[1:30:25] Christ and he said that let your servant
[1:30:27] rejoice in peace you have seen the hand
[1:30:30] of the Living God and brother is the
[1:30:32] same God let let Simon to that Christ
[1:30:35] thing that same God is him that has led
[1:30:37] you here this afternoon if that can't
[1:30:40] believe you get what happened of today
[1:30:42] he's the same yesterday to them forever
[1:30:45] just believe God you didn't come here by
[1:30:47] chance you will become a Christian by
[1:30:50] chance God pre-ordained he or far then
[1:30:53] he predestinated you for such a time
[1:30:55] like this you are reserved for this time
[1:30:58] of the year you are reserved for this
[1:31:00] time of the day of the age God could put
[1:31:03] his trust in you because I deal with
[1:31:06] that test will not be made perfect amen
[1:31:08] because they are all waiting on us
[1:31:10] foreign
[1:31:22] has to do but they need to be surrounded
[1:31:25] we need to be prisoner of Christ there's
[1:31:28] so many things that is attaching us God
[1:31:30] wants us to get rid of all those
[1:31:32] attachments so that he can fully float
[1:31:34] through us the way you want to do oh God
[1:31:36] and be a prisoner of Christ let God take
[1:31:39] control over the situation commit your
[1:31:42] ways to God let him take control and he
[1:31:45] will bring it to pass he's the same
[1:31:47] yesterday today and forever and God
[1:31:51] never change
[1:31:52] Hallelujah is the same God
[1:31:55] praise our God
[1:31:57] thank you Jesus amen
[1:32:00] Hallelujah and if you read I understand

[1:33:04] and when the people saw what Paul had
[1:33:06] done they let out of their voice saying
[1:33:09] in the speech of light Corner that Gods
[1:33:12] had come down to earth in the likeness
[1:33:14] of men continue and they called badhabas
[1:33:17] Jupiter and Paul mercuros because he was
[1:33:21] a chief speaker keep on reading then the
[1:33:24] prince of Jupiter which was before their
[1:33:26] City brought oxen and garlands onto the
[1:33:29] gates and would have done sacrifice to
[1:33:32] the people next which when the Apostle
[1:33:34] Barnabas and Paul head of they rent
[1:33:39] their clothes and run in among the
[1:33:42] people crying out and saying says why do
[1:33:47] you these things
[1:33:49] we also are men of like persons with you
[1:33:53] and preach until that ye should turn
[1:33:56] from these vanities into the Living God
[1:33:59] which made Heavenly and Earth and the
[1:34:02] Sea and all things that they are in so
[1:34:06] my point is Paul was trying to let them
[1:34:09] know that they also have passion like
[1:34:13] they are as Elijah was a man subject to
[1:34:16] like passion like you are so my point
[1:34:19] today is If God could use Paul in that
[1:34:22] capacity that somebody was crippled from
[1:34:25] his womb to come back to life that same
[1:34:28] God is here today to give all your need
[1:34:31] to use you if you surrender yourself
[1:34:33] because we are not different from them
[1:34:35] there are men of right past they make
[1:34:38] mistakes they have anger they have all
[1:34:40] those things but when they were
[1:34:42] surrendered to God became prisoner of
[1:34:44] Christ he could that thing could happen
[1:34:47] in his ministry and one thing that you
[1:34:50] have to learn from that is that Paul and
[1:34:53] Panama never accepted that worship
[1:34:55] because Jesus Christ is God and him
[1:34:58] alone has to be worshiped if you check
[1:35:01] in the scripture every man of God none
[1:35:04] of them accept worship God is jealous of
[1:35:08] his worship His share not his worship
[1:35:10] with anybody that's why he Kickstarter
[1:35:13] from Heaven because Satan being a
[1:35:16] creation of God wanted to receive
[1:35:18] worship so he was cast down and anyone
[1:35:21] that received worship is of the devil
[1:35:23] because God allows to worship His name
[1:35:26] is the Lord Jesus Christ that's why he
[1:35:28] accepted worship that's why he allow
[1:35:30] them to worship him even if you read in
[1:35:33] Revelation 19 when John the Revelator
[1:35:35] was so caught up with the angel that
[1:35:38] that imaginary said that he wanted to
[1:35:40] have said no worship God I'm your
[1:35:42] brethren one of your breathing so don't
[1:35:44] worship me the angels Don't worship God
[1:35:47] that angels are alive to worship him so
[1:35:50] he's a prophet amen he was so caught up
[1:35:53] the God used him so much that when God
[1:35:56] incarnate in the people and he used that
[1:35:59] no we'll see they said that they they
[1:36:01] found out that Peter and John were
[1:36:03] ignorant and on rented but they said
[1:36:06] they have been root of Jesus when God
[1:36:08] incarnate himself if you surrender
[1:36:10] yourself you're a seed of God and God
[1:36:12] incarnate himself so much in you and the
[1:36:15] people see the trace of God sometimes
[1:36:17] they mistake you to be God that's why
[1:36:19] Abraham has to get away from the
[1:36:21] preaching about three years because
[1:36:22] people are worshiping his name people
[1:36:24] are doing all kind of things he said no
[1:36:26] you can't make me Antichrist he's got
[1:36:29] her from it for three years but oh that
[1:36:32] God revealed to himself my brother don't
[1:36:34] worry they did that to John the Baptist
[1:36:36] that he understood so all those things
[1:36:38] if you see it going on don't worry it's
[1:36:40] a spirit
[1:36:41] that you as a son or daughter of God you
[1:36:44] worship only Jesus Christ These Are
[1:36:47] Everything Jesus Christ Our everything
[1:36:49] he's my father is my mother he is
[1:36:52] everything to me him I love me worship
[1:36:54] amen our God is Awesome Hallelujah Jesus
[1:36:58] Christ is God Amen there's no other gods
[1:37:01] that there's no God this time there's no
[1:37:03] God after me I'm the Lord God heal is
[1:37:05] right the Lord your God is one God and
[1:37:08] his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:37:11] praise God let's give him our plows
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:19] he's God
[1:37:21] he has risen from the dead is God every
[1:37:24] knee shall by every tongue shall confess
[1:37:26] that Jesus Christ is God Amen praise God
[1:37:30] I'm just gonna give a little testimony
[1:37:32] here then I'll close shortly one time
[1:37:35] I went to work
[1:37:37] on the job side in Mississauga and there
[1:37:41] was this guy here
[1:37:43] um
[1:37:44] you are so nice to me a carpenter he
[1:37:47] treats me so good help me doing
[1:37:50] everything and I will end up talking
[1:37:52] about the Lord Jesus Christ and I told
[1:37:55] him that because Jesus Christ is God it
[1:38:00] doesn't matter what religion they are
[1:38:02] when they got in trouble unconsciously
[1:38:05] that name is on the back of the people's
[1:38:08] mind they mentioned the name he said
[1:38:10] that no way forget it Philip you I I
[1:38:13] never mentioned this testimony I got in
[1:38:15] trouble today he's not God he's just
[1:38:18] another person there are three Gods all
[1:38:20] that kind of thing so I just forget
[1:38:21] about him I went
[1:38:24] back the following day
[1:38:26] and God had that I was just around him
[1:38:28] he was working in a in the kitchen in
[1:38:33] the master home suite trying to do a
[1:38:35] window black rest and this guy did
[1:38:37] everything he couldn't fix the window
[1:38:40] and he was struggling struggling I said
[1:38:43] oh Jesus Oh I thought you don't you
[1:38:45] don't message these things
[1:38:48] he did it for like three times
[1:38:56] and then
[1:38:59] the following thing
[1:39:02] I happened to go to work but I was late
[1:39:04] and something told me to buy a coffee
[1:39:06] for this guy
[1:39:08] so when I bought the coffee double
[1:39:10] double when I got there the guy was just
[1:39:14] in his van going to buy a coffee so I
[1:39:18] gave that coffee to him and he said oh
[1:39:20] my goodness you know what to do to
[1:39:22] himself but I'm trying to like Jesus
[1:39:24] Christ is God
[1:39:26] you can't deny that
[1:39:28] he's the same yesterday to them forever
[1:39:31] he is like he's the one that created
[1:39:32] everything and that same God is in you
[1:39:36] and in me today because when he came to
[1:39:39] shed his blood on Calvary so that he
[1:39:42] became what available to everyone of us
[1:39:46] so now as the brother said you agree the
[1:39:48] badger skin you have become the temple
[1:39:50] of God and God dwells inside of you you
[1:39:55] are not going to be Sons and Daughters
[1:39:57] of God now you are the sons of God now
[1:40:02] present tense
[1:40:03] so not nobody put that in future you
[1:40:06] have to recognize who you are that I am
[1:40:10] a son a daughter of the Living God
[1:40:15] now you are the Son of God it's not
[1:40:18] going to be in the future and that's him
[1:40:21] God is with you and in me today because
[1:40:25] you are a temple that God dwells in you
[1:40:30] and in me and he is what waiting on you
[1:40:33] and me so you got to be ready
[1:40:35] we have to make our mind up we have to
[1:40:38] stand on the word of God because God is
[1:40:40] supporting us all the way sometimes
[1:40:44] things may not seem the way you want it
[1:40:46] to go
[1:40:47] might not see the way you see it but
[1:40:50] don't give up
[1:40:51] he's still with you
[1:40:53] even in you
[1:40:54] so I'm just gonna conclude with that let
[1:40:59] expect
[1:41:01] let our expectation be high
[1:41:05] on what God is able to do
[1:41:08] not look at your circumstances don't
[1:41:11] look at the things around you
[1:41:13] sometimes
[1:41:15] life it seems to be so much shackles and
[1:41:19] things seems to be going all wrong
[1:41:22] but God is still in control
[1:41:24] he's in control of every situation
[1:41:27] he will turn things to the right way so
[1:41:30] let's keep on pressing on let's keep on
[1:41:33] fighting let's keep on doing our part
[1:41:35] and he has already done it because
[1:41:39] one thing is God can never feel or he
[1:41:42] cannot lie he keeps all his appointment
[1:41:44] keeps all his weight he's always on time
[1:41:48] when he made that promise to Abraham he
[1:41:51] swelled by Earth himself
[1:41:54] not by anybody he himself swear that I
[1:41:57] would do this I would do that out
[1:41:58] because he knows that we cannot keep it
[1:42:01] that's why the Lord changed because he
[1:42:04] said Abraham Adam if you do this if you
[1:42:07] do that then when he came to Abraham it
[1:42:10] was unconditional promise it's not what
[1:42:13] you have done it's what God has already
[1:42:16] done he has already done it so I called
[1:42:20] the musicians to come and let's prepare
[1:42:23] for the songs
[1:42:30] amen
[1:42:47] okay let's pray
[1:42:50] oh a gracious Eternal God
[1:42:53] I'm so grateful and thankful that what
[1:42:56] you place my heart I've just spoke it I
[1:42:58] pray that it blessed your people and if
[1:43:00] there's anything that was selling like
[1:43:02] you take it away from the heart and let
[1:43:04] be a blessing and bless your children
