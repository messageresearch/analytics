to be together again amen do you know that song um we're together [Music] again if you want to they can't stop [Music] oh [Applause] oh together [Music] [Applause] god before the foundation of the world amen he came down to this earth or were sent down to the earth here because god trusted and he had confidence in us as he had in job that no matter what the devil did and test and try them they're not going to curse him that we would come down here and that even though we got separated from one another and we didn't we don't know each other down here on earth back there we did but somehow by his miraculous power he would draw us together in a oneness that is in jesus christ hallelujah amen and is that brother danny oh i praise god god to see your brother anthony uh to just to let you know that that is why i am rejoicing when i'm seeing it not just that we are together again because we weren't in the building for months and then we got back together yes we are together again in that sense but i'm thinking on the largest sense that we are all together again let's praise the lord let's sing it again oh we're together again glory just praising the lord we're together again [Music] something good is in store we're together again praising the lord amen god bless you please be seated thank you all appreciate it very much thank you brothers good to have you here in the house of the lord and i want to first of all thank god for all the brethren that came here during the past week and yesterday to have all of the equipment set up because they're going to try for the first time to stream the entire service live onto youtube we don't know what problems we may have or anything of that nature but as you know it's the first time we're doing everything in this way and not the preaching but you know the first time we're going digital online like that live praise god not um that it's um it's recorded and then put up but it's actually going on live while we're speaking so they had to buy equipment and set things up and test and try and everything else before it could be in a position to do that so we want to thank all of those of you who cooperated with that and the worshipers the singers and all of that praise god so welcome to all of you back in the house of the lord amen so i thank god for every one of you i also want to ask those that were newly baptized during the time the church was closed baptisms went on so i'd ask you to stand wherever you are if you are baptized in water praise god praise god praise god praise the lord let's give them a hand amen the lord bless you real god please be seated just to let you know that baptism is a sign uh from god that just as much as we were jesus was buried and wrote to walk in his glorified life even so the symbol of going into the water is as if you were being buried spiritually you passed all the mistakes all your wrongs buried praise the lord and now you've been raised up to walk in newness of life to walk in the new life which is the life of jesus christ so may god bless you straighten you and guide you in the rest of your life's journey we will talk about this at another time we thank god for that i want to also uh speak upon the new protocols that we have to partake of and i'm wearing this for now i've already uh sent to try and get um a clear visor where i can speak much better uh you know it's made for for that type of thing where you can speak better but your face would be clearly seen but for now i have to use this blue one that i have here now so if you see me adjusting it from time to time you'll understand but so we have as you see the church is all marked out it's all distanced properly and uh let's stay with the protocols that we have here and the reasoning is very important because you may not know this but the last the the last service that we had here we actually had the police come and was counting how many people were in to see if we were at the right number and checking to see when you go in the parking lot whether or not we were trying to at least keep some distance you were checking and all that and you had people from around here going online and making all kinds of remarks and actually saying i am crazy the leadership is crazy to have people coming and having church and all this type of things and and actually they're the ones called the police and the police came and checked and they found nothing right because we already had you know we're telling people to distance themselves properly so they found nothing and that's what they said but it gave me at least that let me know that eyes are upon us you may not be seeing them or anything like that but eyes are upon us so it's very important that we stay with these directives and protocols that we are receiving and i think they're a little more strict on it because the government uses the four years there as a voting um they use it as an area for voting and other municipal or government things they will ask to use that so if we don't keep those protocols then they won't be encouraged to continue praise the lord so let's do our best in that particular area uh during the the months uh actually it's such a long time from march my goodness oh man praise god some of the kids are now young people they've grown up in such a short while but i during that period of time brother mike and his family were very very helpful and to myself and sister simon they actually came by and went to costco or went out to the store and did a lot of our buying and stuff you know until things began to ease up before sister simon would venture out and you know do some shopping and stuff like that but before that it was brother mike and his family that were doing that for us so i want to thank god for them also brother philip over here and his family brother philip in particular was very useful also in that area to run any errand or to do anything listen all of you are not living close enough by me to be able to do that i know that if you were there you would be willing to do it so it's not like i'm just singling them out i understand that but because they are closer they were able to be useful to me in that and my family in that particular way also brother alvin was also another person that was very very useful and i want to thank god for brother alvin and his family that were a real blessing to us thank god uh sister pat and and uh stanley also we want to thank god for them amen god bless them and keep them and keep him especially in health because he's been having some health challenges sister merle that is sister julie's mother wrote me to in rejoicing how that her husband who was not a believer of the message um god touched his heart you know he went into the hospital and while in there before he came out he became like a believer and so now they're going to church regularly and she is happy and rejoicing is for years and years praise god that she's been asking god for this and god has honored her praise the lord praise god now if i didn't uh refer to or say any and everything i should say uh today then um we'll have to pick that up another time and you i trust that you'll forgive me um and today we will go into the word of god and speak to you for a little while amen my uh my topic for today is going to come from judges chapter 21 verse 25 and you may find that in your bible and shall we rise and read this together and it's just verse praise god hallelujah in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes i'd like to read that again in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes may god bless the reading of his word our gracious heavenly father we ask your blessing upon the reading of your word now we would pray that you will break the bread of life to us and make it be fresh manna from heaven grant us angels food today lord but that by it we may live and be able to finish our life's journey for your glory and honor amen amen god bless you please be seated now as you know one of the last messages that was brought the tabernacle here was talking about the provocation in the wilderness and we talked about how the israelites led by the great pillar of fire going through the wilderness and how that some of them began to provoke god and they provoked him by questioning his ability they forgot his miracles that he had performed in the wilderness some murmured some complained some complained against god some murmured and complained against moses and the bible tells us most of all brothers that they doubted his power and his ability to keep them protect them and to bring them through the wilderness and so only two joshua and caleb that we know the bible spoke speaks of that really stood by the word of god and did not slow up did not back up did not bow or anything because they believed god's word completely because if he said i'm going to take you out of egypt i'm going to bring you to the wilderness i'm going to bring you into the promised land then he has to do that it's not for me to figure out how am i going to come out of this heat how am i going to come out of all of these snakes how am i going to come through all of the bitter waters of mara how am i going to be able to come through all this suffering that's not her our problem is he said he's going to bring us through and he promised that he has a place prepared for us that we should be ready to go there so just prepare yourself and not to worry but joshua and caleb were the only two that did not complain did not murmur did not doubt but they followed the pillar of fire praise the lord hallelujah amen now of course you know i'm uncomfortable with this i'm not used to it at all so um that's all right um anyway they did not worry they did not complain but they followed the word of god for their day we asked and we are called upon to follow the word of god for our day and the devil will do everything he'll show you every flaw every fault every mistake everything so that you can begin to murmur you can begin to complain you have to begin to see this and see that and hear this and hear that and everything else but this is all distractions of the devil to take you off of the word of god hallelujah now we are referring to this verse because remember they had just come out of the patriarchal period and they were about to make a change as you know this covid and all these problems is because there is a change going on the world is changing the atmosphere is changing we know that the devil is bringing in his powers and his governments his systems and those of god is fixing to go out because he's going to have to have control for a certain period of time so that certain prophecies got to be fulfilled israel has to go back amen we know that the antichrist spirit has to come in we know the false prophet has to make himself manifest we know that the world council of churches the of revelation 18 19 17 18 and 19 is going to be made manifest we know that a woman will rule in the united states brother branham said i don't know if it's a church or a woman or it could be a church and a woman we don't know but it's all going to happen according to this word of god that we have received so all these things must take place now for the time that you were out there from march until this present time god made sure there was no pastor there there was no deacons there there was no trustees there's nobody to tell you anything so now the question will be how did you conduct your lives there was no king in israel nobody to tell them anything nobody that they have to look over their shoulder and check is the pastor watching did brother phillip hear about this or that what about brother mike what about brother daniel this is no you didn't have to think about that you could go along your life free and easy and clear nobody there and god allowed that he allowed it deliberately so that everyone would be able to conduct themselves without having to wear a mask i preached on it last week you don't have to put on a religious mask because a mask in front of me you may even convince me how good how pious how great consecrated and dedicated you are i'm just a human so you may you may deceive me i don't know unless god would reveal to me so therefore god gives you that freedom to let you make yourself manifest to see who you really are in the book of deuteronomy chapter eight listen uh verses one two three all the commandments which i commanded thee this day shall you observe to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord swear unto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord led thee for this 40 years in the willingness purpose of leading you in the wilderness purpose of letting you go on the covet 19 purpose of why he allowed you to be by yourself right i let these 40 years in the will to humble thee to humble you to prove thee amen thirdly and to know what was in thine heart hallelujah whether thou would escape his commandments or no god wanted to test every one of us to see whether we would live by the word if there is no religious restraint no king no deacon no pastor no sunday service you know you're not gonna come and get your your sunday drink let me put it that way your sunday drink or your alcohol on sunday that will kind of spruce you up and spice you up so you leave rejoicing and you go forth in that strength for another two or three days and by the time you come to wednesday you get another bounce again and that keeps you to sunday and and you go on like that for years but if god took you and put you in the wilderness somewhere all by yourself will you be able to survive will you survive by his word praise god so god has deliberately allowed us to be out there and to be there with all these things around us now while i'm speaking you judge yourself i'm not here to judge you praise god because as i go on you will see later on why god allowed that you see for god has said in his word that he took us there that he might prove us proving what his word he has to prove which among us is really his word that was predestinated and foreknown by him we can all have a desire to serve god that's wonderful cain wanted to serve god he wanted to give god glory to but he wanted to do it his way not god's way but his own way praise god but we want to thank god for his holy spirit who is leading us that we might uh provide god with a service while doing his will praise the lord hallelujah let me turn this around the other way and see if it'll work a little better i know that um praise the lord hallelujah all right now he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger fed thee with manna which thou knowest not needed to die fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but man thought every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god hallelujah so we live by god's revealed word the word out of the mouth of god not just the word on the pages of the bible but the word that comes freshly out of god's mouth and that you hear his word right to your ears and that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god hallelujah be careful verse 10 when thou was eaten and not full oh i know the message i i got it i got the revelation at the last prophet's message i've caught that look i know i know the seven church ages i don't have to listen to the broadcast on wednesday because i got the book and i read it and i know the message and i know this and i know that you eat and you're full you're full of the revelation you're full of the word you you believe your noise you believe that it's already right and uh thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good land which he had given you are you happy today for this message are you happy for this good land which the lord has given us the prophet of god said in the leadership book that the holy spirit has led us into this found land of this message for this hour and i'm not talking about newfoundland up there i'm talking about this message that god led us to listen i've caught a hold of this i was in pentecost i was 14 years old i was in pentecost and when i say pentecost i'm talking about the real pentecost it was just to the tail end of it so i was barely able to see some of the real things of god like when uh that all rather come about i can remember his name a man of prayer and fasting and seeking god and he would raise up there and and and say somebody will be here on sunday to preach the word of god and he'll tell you he have on this kind of pants and this shirt and whatnot sunday we just sing the sims and we're just waiting the next thing you know bang the door open and here's a stranger and it comes in and you know he treats them and then the brother would ask if he's a preacher and where he's from and next thing you know he is a preacher and brother you know god that already told us you're coming you just go up and he'll preach the word of god and the power of god will come down amen and again you know what brother branham talk about people taking communion and and they have to back them out i've seen that man stand up and tell people that you touch that bread and drink that cup and they'll pack you out of here amen praise god hallelujah men of that nature not just him but there were others glory to god i seen one of those brothers preached and they sent missionaries from america to go and do missionary work when that man preaching a part of god fall in that place the missionaries are on their stomach they can't walk to the altar they have to crawl and that man is preaching the word of god demons are manifesting demons casting out all kinds of stuff while he is yet speaking so i seen the real pentecostal when i've seen all these guys getting up trying to copy cat brother branham it's good and no doubt they may even get some signs and some wonders like like those musicians they they had some signs too but moses almost swallowed theirs up and it's the same way brother sisters and so here we are having this word of god in this hour and so many copycats so much confusion that god allow all of this so that you can find yourself in him hallelujah because if you are not the original seed you won't make it true i said you won't make it true it doesn't matter that i preach the word of god to you because god allowed me to preach the word so that you will have a foundation so that when the winds come and the winds blow that you will you'll be funded on a rock so if the work comes and the winds blow and the trials come and it blows you away then what happened it means that you did not sit on the foundation that god gave to you praise the lord verse 16 who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not amen that he might humbly that he might prove thee to do the good in the latter end now you know brother branham preached the great message all god's gifts will find their appropriate places all god's appropriate gifts are going to find their places and this covet 19 all the tests and the trials that come with it is exactly to do that that everything will find its place it doesn't matter that you sat here and you've been in the church and you follow the message you are going to be tested if you haven't been already and it's going to do that so that you can come to your appropriate place and find whoever you are listen what brother branham said i mean the bible says here matthew 13 again the kingdom of heaven is like onto a net that was cast into the sea and garnered of every kind which when it was full they drew it to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels and cast the bad away quoting brother branham speaking now now a preacher he is there just to throw out the net he pulls him and in that great net the bible teaches he brings in everything hallelujah oh my praise god brother simon is a wonderful preacher praise the lord hallelujah so everybody that came in under his ministry are all predestinated chosen and they are all of god no we don't know that only god can prove that only god can test that and prove that not even i cannot say to you i know for sure you're one of them it might tell my senses might tell me that but that doesn't mean anything it's god must testify about abel's gifts his gods must testify about the eternal life the gift of god is eternal life and only he can testify about that now that preacher pulls in and in that net he brings in water spiders can you say amen frogs snakes lizards terrapins which is to say um what do you call them again terrapins is uh tertius turtis right or we say turtle right tap balls and also fish now it's not for me to determine or to judge any of them which is fish which is snake and which is that poles but you'll just watch them the nature that is in them will prove what they are because when the trials and the tests come you are going to find out who you really are you know one time uh muhammad ali had to fight joe former um what's his name again joe joe frazer yes that's him joe frazer and muhammad ali getting there and they start to box and you know he likes to talk while he's boxing so they start the box and he says man joe he says you made a mistake they put you in here to fight me he says they write you up and talking about you're a tiger and all of this stuff and so on like that and he says man i'm going to teach you a lot for the day so joe fraser said that's all right he says that's okay he said well when i put some pressure on you you're gonna go back to all them all habits that you had and then i'm gonna take you to pieces and that's exactly what joe frazer did he started putting pressure on him you know how he used to box he never stopped once he start he's just coming at you with all those red cross and uppercuts and everything else like that and so muhammad said man he says joe while they're boxing he says joe they told me in the paper you were a paper tiger he said they told you wrong ben and really took him apart praise the lord but the point is that joe fraser was making doesn't matter how much training you do when you're under pressure you're going to go right back to your original style which you think is good and that's with every human being when the trails of life and the problems begin to hit you you go right back to your original form hallelujah and then you show your real nature that's been hiding underneath the mask it begins to show up your nature will prove what they are you watch the gospel message many will come to the altar wow the nets got them but mr turtle will stick his head up and say i didn't believe it all from the very beginning i didn't believe the message i just followed it to see what it was like and uh and the snake will say you know there is something about what you just said so she he didn't say it but the turkish say it so he can still pull himself out he's a snake cunning smart subtle he said all that holy roller stuff i can't stop see and then the old mrs spider starts plop plop plop and she goes right back it was that to start with it's just that the net went over them that's exactly right but the fish was fish when the net over them and the spider was a spider when it went over them we are singing for fish god's the one to determine who is in that net so i'm preaching here but you yourself by the word to see where you are and what role you played during the time of us being separated one from the other you're separated from us but you're not separating from him and how did you act during that time oh thank god i'm free i'm free from all these brethren being around me watching me is not f brethren watching you if there's an eye that's watching you all the time god's watching you all the time praise god hallelujah reverend random speaking again white people can't keep the victory when a man preaches a revival under the power and demonstration of the holy spirit a net is drawn around the people that's right and if he's a bug to begin with he's a bug at the end of the revival if he's a water spider the first thing you know he'll go around saying i don't believe in this i don't believe in that and he'll plop he'll go right back to his old way back to the water if he's a snake he'll say i told you so i told you about it and where he will go he was a snake by nature to begin with see he has never been nothing else oh my see he can't be nothing else a man can't join church and just think he can get emotional and get all worked up and that makes him a christian no it's got to be a solid birth in the holy spirit dying out sincerely hallelujah crying out and leaving there until you're dead praise god i know i'm speaking but while i'm speaking the word of god is searching your heart and you're going to search your own self by the grace of god hallelujah oh my praise god listen to brother branham again speaking here in hebrews chapter six he said i am preaching he said actually i am pulling i am pulling there they are lord you know what they are i am just here to pull in the net all right now the turtle was a turtle to begin with but he just got caught in the net that's right people get caught up with emotion with oh hallelujah oh hallelujah oh praise the lord glory to god hallelujah you see what they got caught in the net but that all turtle spirit is still in them and on them and it's going it going to be long that they'll begin to say well i tell you this i tell you that and they'll go creeping right back to what they were old lady crawfish will just say i can't understand this i can't understand that and she'll back away from it miss spider there sat there for a little while and back she'll go mrs serpent will say oh that bunch of church people you're a snake to begin with the gospel net just caught you but the fish is took to the master's table for it was a fish to begin with the seed in him that was a fish to begin with so he began as a fish god knowed him as a fish from the foundations of the world and hallelujah that's what is he is praise god but remember he said they were all at one time breathing in the same muddy sinful water all of them were out there in the same water breathing in the same old dirty creek we were all made to drink of the spiritual rock eat the same manner joshua and caleb at the same manner that was in the wilderness and that the rest of them eat and they all fell in the wilderness only the two elected got over and went over to the other side praise the lord hallelujah amen don't you see why we made to rejoice together and why we are made to give god the glory and the praise and the honor together because that's the way that god made us to be one in the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen brother sister this is what's happening here today i am preaching about what is happening right now that we are all being tested and tried by what we have all been brought into here by the grace of god when you go home check it again hebrews chapter 7 brother branham speaking here praise the lord the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who went to a lake a river or a pond and throwed in his net he had turtles he had everything in there scavengers but he had some fish see the man is just singing as i am now just preaching the gospel and many will come to the altar and they cry and cry and cry that's not my business i wasn't sent here to judge what and who and whatever you see that's the reason why a lot of people uh have found my ministry and preaching to be kind of different because they'll come to the church and they'll see people dress differently they're not dressed in one right because the lord showed me that years ago no field ripens all the fruit written on the same day all the fruit on the tree grew up to a certain level on the same day and just so in the church people are at different stages of growth one may come in still wearing on the dress a little short or you know the pants a little tight or the pants a little low is that right and maybe you have a kind of a walk along with that you know you know you got that kind of a walk that those guys got in new york there you know they kind of they they got the right walk along with it but the fact is brother sister all have to come up at their own level i had a preacher look at one of the brothers in the church here and say you gotta cut that here man look look how you got you here what kind of uh that's not christian well i don't really know what is christian when you say christian god brother abraham said i don't care if he hears purple pink or green and he said i don't really care about that that's not the problem not that he was urging people to go and have their hair purple and pink and green or to have their lips purple pink or green or to their nails done in different ways or whatever like jezebel no it's not that he was doing that but he's saying just be yourself be free be who you are and if the holy spirit doesn't restrain you guide you direct you back to the word to change your actions and the way you walk and live then check yourself recognize what spirit you're of because if the holy spirit is on you he'll make you act like himself if you're one of his children he'll direct you how to act and how to walk other than that don't just come in the church and tighten up and try to cover up and hide no it's better you just relax and just be who you are and let the let the brothers and the sisters know exactly where you're at and then they're able to pray for you and pray with you and walk with you so there is no real tension in coming to this church or being here that somebody is going to look down on you and if anybody does do that it would reflect on them of how spiritual they are and where their growth is if they're to react on you in that kind of a way praise the lord hallelujah more mine brother branham speaking and the man that is born of the spirit of god hates the things of the world for if you love the world or the things of the world then the love of god is not in you if i run around with women every day and come and tell my wife in the evening that i loved her she'd know that i was nothing but a liar is that right think about it certainly i proved to her i didn't love her because i wasn't true to her she told me she if she told me she loved me every time i'd be gone and she'd take off with somebody else it would prove that she didn't love me her actions prove it i don't care how much she tried to tell me that her actions would speak louder than her words oh my think of it there's no one else in the world but you she would say to me but yet when i'm gone she's gone with somebody else that will make me know she's nothing but a liar and when you try to say lord i love you i love you and yet you are doing things to the world god knows you're a liar to begin with so that's the use to accept a halfway experience something another like that when the skies of heaven are full of the holy ghost do you what do you want to be a miserable proof we are real born again child of god with the joy bells of heaven ringing rejoicing praising god and living a life of victory through jesus christ praise the lord i'm going to stop here for today praise the lord i'm going to stop right now i intended to go on till about 12 30 but it's okay i'm gonna stop here it's our first day and we gotta i gotta find myself as much as you gotta find yourself here in the presence of the living god and i pray god will bless us all together as we come together in the uh in these coming days praise the lord after the service is over i'd like to see you um jose i'd like to see you all praise the lord in the back for a moment praise god i'm glad to see every one of you if you notice i picked up where i left off because i stopped by preaching on the provocation in the wilderness i hope you do not provoke him during this time while you're out there by yourself praise the lord because that is the temptation to start doing all kinds of little things nobody's there nobody's seeing you observing you but god is watching he is seeing he is observing and he knows our own hearts i ask you to bow your head close your eyes right now and i want you to talk to god may the great holy spirit speak to your heart but you know better than anyone else our gracious heavenly father with heads bowed and eyes closed and hearts reaching to you may the great holy spirit father speak into the hearts of your people and maybe may they recognize what i have said and may they measure themselves by the standards of god's word and see where they're at how they have been conducting themselves during this time we're away from one another and father as the journey continues we pray that the great angel of god will protect us every step of the way so that we will come to the end of our life's journey sheltered by the blood of the lamb in the name of jesus christ of the glory of god amen there's a woman at the well that was seeking for things that could not satisfy but then she heard our savior speaking draw free will which never shall run cry let's sing it feel i lifted up [Music] my soul [Music] [Applause] fill my cup [Music] fill it up [Music] this coming wednesday by the grace of god we will be online we will be continuing our study in the seven church ages and we pray that the holy spirit will bless us as we come together to study the word of god may god bless every one of you and uh may he keep you during the rest of the week and bring us together again now before i close i mean i mentioned this brother danny and his family are away on holiday brother joshua and sister charlotte god has led them by his holy spirit to go and minister the word of god in the province of new brunswick and so they have uprooted themselves sold their house bought one there and they've gone to live in new brunswick and to minister the word of god we made the necessary connections we have to make there and for believers that are scattered with no pastor that they will be able to at least not just having to go and search to find a few people but that there would be people there already whether it's 5 10 20 i don't know but they have been quarantined for the past two weeks so they haven't been able to do anything i believe their quarantine ends this weekend so from next week then people will be able to contact them and stuff will begin to happen but just so you know that that's what the holy spirit is doing also from the broadcast when it's from india china wherever from kenya a couple of pastors have already written to brother danny wanting to bring their churches uh which some a couple of them have you know few hundreds of people to bring them onto my ministry but i told you know i just let them know i am not that kind of a bishop that you all are thinking about and it's not necessary for you to come under my ministry there are men right in the country right there that have the message like i have it so they can contact you and you can discuss with them and you can grow from there but i'm letting you know that just so you know that the sermons online are taking effect and just so you know that people listen from around the world you go and you just see maybe 34 people 200 people that's what you see there but when you're going to if you could get the the electronics to get behind the scenes and be able to see um then their numbers that they have then you will see that some of those sermons is thousands of people from india pakistan afghanistan romania czechoslovakia all around the world brazil colombia wherever they are watching and they are listening to these messages so uh they this is happening all because of your faith your prayers and your support the ministry is changing it's not just anymore just being in the church here it's reaching out hallelujah way beyond these walls hallelujah jesus had a church with no walls and that's what's happening now he's staring down the walls so that the ministry is going beyond the wall to reach people wherever they are around the world around the world praise god a brother called also from romania and he needed some help because they just were about to throw him out in the streets like the next day him and his wife and children would be out on the streets a believer the message we confirmed it we talked to brother bischo and those brothers who have ministries in those areas and they knew the pastor in the area and the church that he went to so i got that information so i want to know it's not just somebody call up and pulling a trick to say that they need help it was a brother but because of the broadcast being there and the name of this church going out people are reaching out in different ways and our ministry is expanding from just uh ministering to you alone here in the building i may be speaking to you here alone in the building but from the uh broadcast that's going out online we are reaching thousands so we ought to give god praise and honor of glory [Applause] we are able to help another preacher in the nature in the nation of guyana south america praise the lord that was in dire straits and needed help and so we reached out to them as far as i know with a one-time assistance and to be able to help them to get on their feet and get on with the work of god that they have to get on with and we give god praise and honor and glory so i want you to know we were not asleep during this period we were locked down as you could see there was baptisms going on there were people being reached lines being hard touched and ministries that that appreciate the message that they're hearing the truth and even if they never came in to the message they're going to preach some of the things that they heard me saying and it's going to bless others and the true seed are going to catch that and if they have to come out they're going to come out but we just have to do our part so i want to thank every one of you that's a supporter and a believer may god bless you in every possible way so this wednesday online next sunday we're right back here in the house of god and we're going to be more improved than we were today may god bless you bless your real god [Music] [Applause] [Music] just so you know as well that uh this setup that we have right here is temporary because we will have proper cameras that will be attached and so that may be here for a few weeks but other than that uh it will be gone shortly all
