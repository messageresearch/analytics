TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends another wonderful Sunday morning may the Lord bless you richly as we gathered together here in his wonderful and glorious name let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the privilege and opportunity of coming together on this wonderful day of the rising of the Sun made a great holy spirit bless every word and every thought bless the speaker bless the hearers in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen and amen for the day our scripture will be found in the Book of Daniel chapter 2 reading from verse 19 then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed the God of heaven Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of God for ever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changed the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he given wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding may God bless the reading of his marvelous and wonderful word friends my topic today will be our changing world times are certainly changing the whole world is changing we can clearly see this from the things that are occurring around us at this point in time you see our world is like a great highway with junctions turning points change points we may call it exit ramps which are symbolic of places and periods of change in time now the Scriptures that we just read the background Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had a dream one night and when he woke up in the morning he could not remember his dream so he called for his wise men called for the great knowledgeable men of that day asking them to interpret for him his dream and of course they said Oh King how are we going to interpret your dream you can't remember and you haven't told us what the dream was and being upset he said to them you ought to be able to tell me what my dream was break back to my memory and give me the interpretation if not off with your heads however one of his people remembered that there was one in the kingdom that had wisdom and his name was Daniel and so they called for Daniel presented the problem to Daniel and then you said he'll go and pray and ask his God to give him wisdom and understanding to be able to interpret the King's dream so Danielle went along with his come bunions Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and they prayed and sought God for the answer and God visited Daniels in the night and this is where Daniel returned back to the king and gave him the interpretation of the dream and in part of this interpretation he used this phrase that we have just read here in the Word of God Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of God for ever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changed the times and the seasons he changes the times and the seasons according to his own will now from Adam to the fall Bible readers know that from Adam to Noah Adam to the fall it's called the dispensation of innocence when they were innocent living in idyllic conditions of innocence until the time of the fall after this we realize that it became the time of human government now we use the terms that the times really change and they really do now after the idyllic days of Adam and Eve enjoying their days of innocence in this wonderful garden that God had created and placed them in then came the sir which was not yet a snake he committed the first act of seduction and adultery which would Eve to produce King a wild uncontrollable man now when he did this the whole world changed the world that Adam and Eve lived in changed completely because of this wicked and evil thing and so from those idyllic days of the dispensation of innocence with Adam and Eve it changed to the wild wicked sex-crazed violent and pleasure man days called the days of Noah spoken of by none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself when he said in Luke chapter 17 which I would like to read right now verses 26 if you'll follow me in your Bibles attorney surly and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man they did eat they drank they married wise and they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted and they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed now as I've said they're all world changed from idyllic conditions from innocence to a wild pleasure crazy civilization at that particular time and God looked down upon this wickedness upon the spiritual and moral pollution of the land of his people he saw the violence he saw the wildness he saw the uncontrollable a sin and evil that prevailed over the land and about that time I believe God said it's time for a change then came the flood to wash away those that had polluted the earth now of course we know what pollution is not a new thing they were already polluting the earth at that time now this is our day we're in our day and in our time men women brothers sisters people everywhere just look around you and see what is taking place if the conditions as it was in the days of Noah if those very identical conditions do not exist in our time and in our present age and Jesus said it would prophesied as it was in the day up north so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is being revealed and I believe that is this thing I believe again he is signaling it's time for a change God is signaling to us it's time for there to be a change oh yes shall it should be of course according to Revelation chapter 18 11 and verse 18 when the scripture says God in his word speaking that he would destroy those who destroy the earth Oh brothers and sisters what a terrible time we're living in living in a world pollutant in every way nature itself is at a turning point nature is beginning to renew itself we have faced with the disaster of climate change the Earth's being ravaged by hurricanes typhoons tornadoes in the heavens tremors upon the earth beneath or quakes everywhere and all of these signs in the heavens and upon the earth are coming upon the world with increasing rapidity and as these dangers become closer and closer in time friends we're headed for the windup of all things I believe at this very moment while we're speaking whether it be in the political realm the realm of governments government world systems we are in the midst of spiritual global renovation the entire world system is now being renovated it is being reconstructed in a condition for renewal there's change going on there is absolute change taking place we're living in a changing world and things are changing around us and we must be aware of these changes that are taking place so the world systems various governments movements are being made movements are taking place whether you read whether you recognize them or not they're taking place and the reconstruction of this new world the renewing of all the systems of the world to meet the needs and challenges of our changing world is taking place right now while we are speaking many many discs disparate different things are taking place but really in fact they're all connected with one goal to change the structure of the entire world to change the way the world operates how it moves and that is taking place when we are speaking when noir came on the scene it was praying for the world to change from innocence to conscience when Jesus came it was time for the world to change from law to grace but the people of Jesus's day missed their day they mess what was really happening they were busy with their daily lives some were even busy with their church life busy in the synagogue busy and worshipping God and hurrying on but they with their religious sales of dogs and rams and goats n' and pigeons and various things merchandising had invaded the temple of god corruption and evil this guy's under the cloak of religion was everywhere and Jesus appeared on the scene first John the Baptist and then Jesus came on the scene now we realize that the people in Jesus's day missed their change they missed their change point they miss the turning point of their age and they fail to recognize God Saint boost for their day you say well rather say mean what do you mean God's a sign both now we know according to Scripture that the appearance of a prophet on the scene is a sign to the age something is fixing to happen God is fixin to move something is about to take place and so John the Baptist's coming on the scene his appearance was God's sign posts God's a signpost pointing to the coming of the word the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ this sign was to all peoples all nations all powers high and low it was a sign that God was fixing to fulfill his word I was fixing to change the age from law to grace now we recognize understand friends we recognize in our day at least I recognize what is happening and I trust that you will recognize what is really taking place because the people in John's day fail to recognize who he really was they failed to recognize what was actually taking place and that he was a signal to them that the times are a-changing our world was changing the world system was changing the way things were to be done we're going to change and this prophet John appearing on the scene was the sign and symbol of the appearance and cunning of the word and of the changing of the times now in the scriptures Matthew chapter 17 verses 10 to 13 the disciples came to Jesus and asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come that is Elijah but I say Elias truly shall come first and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spoke unto them of John the Baptist so John the Baptist was the Elijah for that day he was the man anointed with this spirit of Elijah to fulfill the Word of God for they D now brothers and sisters they missed God samples they miss God's signal to them that the time for a change had come from the old laws to grace for us Paul said the law was only used as a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ now the disciple says master a we thought Elijah was supposed to come and Jesus said he's already come but it was you who didn't recognize him you did not recognize who he really was he was the voice crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord John the Baptist was the voice of God to the people for that day and for that age furthermore he was the Elijah that was supposed to come spoken of in the first part of malachite for fights when he says what Elijah will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children now we see friends that he also was the fulfillment behold I send my messenger before my face Malachi 3:1 he was the fourth of that one who was to be the messenger that would come before the Lord Jesus Christ the signpost to the age pointing to and making people aware of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ his first coming his coming as the word returning as the word making them aware but here was the Word of God the Lamb of God come upon the scene so here we are John was there on the scene to identify and to certify that he Jesus was the real true certified Lamb of God the Word of God made flesh for he stood by the river and said behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ know their failure to recognize who John was also who John really was let me pause here little well that John was not just the son of you know Zacharias and Elizabeth he was much more than that as Jesus said he was a prophet and more than a prophet amongst men and so ah the people failed to recognize just a few resinize who he was but others did not recognize who really John was to them he was oh he was one of our local boys you know that born if you may say it this way he was born down in Kentucky he's one of our boys you know and we know his mother and father Charles and Ella Bren Hammer I to him when he went to school I know him when he worked on the hydro lines I don't know what profit you're talking about because I know John I know Elizabeth I know Zach Zacharias yes but they failed to recognize who he really was that he was the messenger for that day that turned the voice of God to that age and that season and a messenger that came before the first coming of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ yes friends Tinkerman they failed to recognize who Jesus who John was and my goodness they failed to recognize who Jesus the word was which caused them to persecute and to crucify him my friends and they did not realize that they were persecuting and crucifying the very God they worship and claimed deserve there it was the word being fulfilled singing the songs and songs of Zion praises to Jehovah in the temple while crucifying him up on the hill but God signified who he was by ripping up the veil of the temple from top to bottom so they can recognize deity made manifest in humanity yes sir all of that happen because they fail to recognize the samples of their day and of their age they fail to recognize that everything John said and done was pointing to Christ was pointing to the word and as it was then so is it today the church is at another turning point as the Pharisees Sadducees and the Jewish nation was at that time so is it in our day that the church world is at another turning point because friends when you're on a highway it is very important that you recognize the upcoming turning points change points exit ramps where you can are a place where you can turn around they fail to recognize what is happening because they weren't looking for the same post it's happened to me I've been driving on the highways here in Canada or in the United States and as I'm driving along I am talking I'm talking to somebody beside me and somehow I missed this signpost that pointed to my turnoff my friends who hasn't done that this is what has happened and now the church is faced with that type of a situation they're there on a broad highway and as the church world has been traveling along God sent His sight both in our name a 20th century prophet by the name of William Maryland brand ham born in Kentucky anointed by the Holy Spirit and use across the world and vindicated by the pillar of fire in the presence of Almighty God and the church world only recognizes when he benefited them by bringing many many to Jesus Christ into their ranks but when God anointed him to call them vipers the callin snakes in the grass when God anointed him to put the axe to the foundation of their teachings the roots they turned against him when he began to expand the Word of God and said this is restoration time the Word of God is not being restored to the church because the church has drifted off of her foundation drifted off of her original position back to the word back to the original faith and he began to expand the word of God to them and then my friends as he began to expand them bring their word and bring out the various doctrines in the Bible that are founded in the Bible itself scripture upon Scripture by revelation to the people they turn around and rejected him and rejected the word on the basis that it did not agree with their teaching rather than the fact of it agreeing with the word we know that what he has taught and what he has said and breathe with the word as much as we can say 100% but it does not agree with their doctrines upon which they founded these various organizations upon and it's a truth to have a prophet bringing a message that will threaten their entire existence as an organization when he proves that their foundational doctrines are false misguided and built many times on sinking cents think about it yes sir so here is oh man ordinary man comes on the scene and the church world fails to recognize who he is who he was all friends all now we find that they began to attack him they wanted his head as they did John's head back there this do every pull every trick every religious trick the Bible said they mocked his mouth they watched his every move they criticized his message they criticized everything that he said they box they they they tried to pass an elephant through a needle and do everything else to try to prove him wrong but they will not stand with him face to face when he stood in Chicago in front of for hundreds of their church leaders and their diligence and challenged them and said show me in the scriptures anything that I've taught that is not according to the Word of God not one of them stood up to challenge him but after he's dead and gone and his message continues and it is not dead or dying but it's a life it's moving and it's growing more than it ever was by the thousands and tens of thousands and millions around the world my friends there is a revival going on a genuine Holy Ghost Pentecostal revival none of the smothered Pentecost but of the original one anointed by the Word of God for the aged and for the owl nobody's gone he is been called all kinds of names all manner of things have been said about him Oh evening wolves even amongst his own followers have arisen some that are nothing but reddening wolves false teachers twisting a word of god with a Judas spirit upon them that will walk with him for so long and seize their opportunity to sell him out and have him and his message crucified before the world shame upon you the Holy Spirit of the Living God sees and knows everything being said and done by every person that's saying undoing it and the Holy Spirit knows who we are and we reward us according to our works for his ability for his humility his unparalleled humility for the divine love manifested through this wonderful messenger prophet God said to the aged all my friends what a blessing that God sent him to visit leart but the church there goes flying fast on the highway speeding up the highway and go right past God signpost and feeling as if all this world because they could they're able to continue the drive they're able to continue to be in the driver's seat they continue to be able to base their drop their blessings their success their prosperity upon numbers of upon upon the finance upon all the amassing of properties and stuff of that nature and the Bible says in in Revelation chapter 3 verse 18 and knowest thou not that you're Richard blind naked and don't know it because you're saying I'm rich I'm increased with good do you think that means God's blessing because I'm oh we are growing with we're growing yes my friends that's not the word the words that's because you sit like that because genuine faithful ministry no longer amongst you filled up with business managers administrators filled up with all the various Sciences dr. this a dr. Dalton whatever names that place upon manda fill them with religious pride to become stuffed shirts under the days of Christianity sincere people wonderful people but North no not you don't know you don't recognize that you're being blinded you're being led away from the Word of God and you're gone past God signed book I'd like to call your attention back go back and study and look in the Word of God link it with the life of this marvelous wonderful prophet that God has sent and see God has fulfilled his word in our day and is fulfilling his word in our day and we ought to come to attention of the Word of God for this day and for this hour a true prophet William Marion Britton the servant of God a broad high waves before you but there's a highway there and there's a way there are lines in the highway and if you stay within the white lines you'll get to heaven just on time my friends as I was force in this rich prosperous Church world of the day feels because the road is wide there's lots of space lots of growing we're just getting bigger and bigger and bigger like the Giants that walk in the land in the times of North or the J that were in the time of David who had to strengthen with a rock uh uh under the brook the revelation out of the word so that they can recognize that there is a God in heaven there's a God who rules over all things but it is not my friends it is not the time for us to feel comfortable lukewarm and self-sufficient with religious power all friends but to come back the church come back in humility in the presence of God if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray cry out to God and ask God my friends for a renewal of reconstruction a transformation a complete total restoration and then God will move it in the church movement in your life and renew your life renew your walk and get you ready for a rapture out of here oh yes our changing world our world is changing its homecoming time friends its rapture time yes sir I can see the handwriting on the wall I can see our Savior at the door soon the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side all the hosts of heaven will assemble b.o will be a glorious sight all the saints and spotless white and with Jesus we shall live eternally oh come and dine the master call it coming dying you will feast with Jesus at Jesus table all the time for he who fed the multitude and turns the water into wine he is calling now Oh child of mine or Church of the Living God once you come and dine upon the stored up food that I have provided through my voice for these last days and stored it up so that you can feed upon they stored up Word of God made a great holy spirit anoint your up your ears and your eyes of your heart not to be one that hears and hears not one that sees and sees not all friends made a holy spirit because we have come and the signs are pointing that we are at the ending of the Gentile dispensation and next week I'll pick this up the stop up and I'll carried on out my friends to assure you much more and to recognize what is really happening right now in our world and the change the next change or changes that are to come some are already in progress some are already taking place and I want you to be aware and prepared for this so that you will be ready for the coming of the Lord and ready for the changes that are upon their way may God bless you my friends my brothers my sisters it was such a wonderful time I spent here with you but I'll be back on Wednesday night with the lesson 7 on the 7 Church ages I'm still in the parts where I'm just introducing it but then I'll get to the individual Church ages as we go along next Sunday at 11 a.m. as I've said I'll be back with our changing world and the changes that are now in progress but while we are here and you have heard the Word of God I must call you once more come and dine come to the perfect word listen to the voice of God repent if you're a church member my friends dig a little deeper in God's Word and in the love of God if you want to ask any questions you may ask them freely and we'll try best to answer those questions of course you can contact us on our website or text us in some way subscribe to our Channel and let the Holy Spirit tell your friends tell your family tell all the believers let them hear the Word of God coming forth that you might be able to grow higher in the love of God and live closer in the grace of God may the Lord Jesus Christ richly bless you now and forevermore amen and amen goodbye friends until next Sunday [Music] you [Music]
