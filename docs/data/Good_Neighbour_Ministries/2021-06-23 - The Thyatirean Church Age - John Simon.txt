TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening my dear friends i'm so happy and thrilled to be with you here this evening as we study siren church age this age in this age we begin to see the identification of the originators and the institutors of denominational religion as the bible calls her mystery babylon the mother of harlots let us enter into our bible a teaching from the word of god as spoken by the seventh angel william marion branham the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 and the spirit spoke through him saying these things but first let us read from the book of revelation chapter 2 verses 18 to 29 and it reads thus and unto the angel of the church in siatira right these things said the son of god who had his eyes like onto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and my works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest the woman jezebel which call it herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed onto idols and i gave her space to repent for her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adulterate her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he that searches their reigns and hearts and i will give unto everyone according to his works but unto you i say and unto the rest in tithira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden but that which you have already hold fast till i come and he that overcome it and keep it my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with rod of iron as the vessels of potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i have received of my father and i will give him the morning star he that hat an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches our scripture reading for tonight let us pray our gracious god our loving heavenly father we thank thee for the gift of the holy spirit and of the word of god the bread of life as we feast upon the word today may your blessing come upon us enrich us encourage us and strengthen us causing us to grow into great trees of righteousness for thy glory honor and praise in the name of jesus christ our lord amen and amen the church age of sayathira now it is called the psia siren church age because god chose this city of tiotara as a as a representative or as a nursery of what was to come when that church age comes to its maturity from infancy to maturity so if we are to study we must begin by understanding the characteristics of the city of thyatira now concerning this city of satire historically speaking it was the least not worthy of the seven cities that god chose as representative cities and churches in those cities to represent the seven ages or the seven church ages we call them that were to come in other words these churches that were in asia and asia minor were like this seed bed or nurseries for the growth of the various spirit life and also of the word of god that was already planted in them and we are now here in the seventh church age at the end of the seven church age looking back and seeing the unfolding of prophecy and the fulfillment of the word of god right before our very eyes we are a blessed people we are a privileged people we are found standing in the gap looking backwards at prophecy spoken watching it unfold kind to its maturity in our day and our time and blessed to be able to look ahead to the future and see the future things or the things that are going to be we are blessed to be able to see and to understand that we may escape by the rapturing grace of god into the presence of god where we will continue to witness the unfolding of the earth history and all of the satanic manipulations that is taking place and will take place on the face of this earth and we will be given a grand stand amen we're in the lower seats now but one day we'll be called up higher and when we are here when we hear that voice saying come up hither then we'll answer the call there we will be with the other witnesses who will be able in the grandstands of heaven to be able to look down and to see the unfolding of the tribulations of the judgments the battle of armageddon and the things that must yet come to pass but for now we are looking at this city of science cyathira situated on the confines of miceae and eonia it was typically and i call this a type a spiritual eye will see this this city types a church and the city happens to be right at the confluence of several rivers several rivers flowed out from this city surrounded by many rivers and those rivers we're filled with religious all these the spiritual eyes sees them escapes because we know from out of the mother harlot church came all of the denominations of which god said i'll give you power over these nations and out of these many rivers of religion flowing from mystery babylon comes all of these denominational rivers filled with blood sucking and money sucking leeches that will take the very life out of you unless you can discern detect them and get them off of you and i know one good thing to make them fall away from you is fire and that's what we need in every heart and in every life is the fire of god to fall upon the altar of your heart oh praise god may the fires of god as we sing the song burn burn holy spirit burn in me set my soul on fire filled me with the holy ghost and with god's full desire amen make me like the christ of old healing and raising the dead amen oh give me the power of the holy spirit like jesus had amen may the holy may god fulfill his word bless his people in in a mighty marvelous and wonderful way now this city as many and most denominations are was well off very well off financially and it was well off financially listen which is spiritual heirs because the corporate interests for this also in there was the birth and growth of corporations coming from the guilds of the potter's guild of the potter's guild of the tanner's guild of the weavers well guild of the dyers guild of the rope makers carpenters guild rope makers guild it's like saying unions or it's like saying corporations they united themselves in secret orders that they can control all commerce and collect all monies and then the la the largest the the monies and the from that they will drop tons of it upon the of the the siren false church of their day and time and it was from this city that in the book of acts we hear of the lovely sister in the lord that has gone into the presence of god sister lydia who was a seller of purple and she came from there and she lydia was paul's first european convert so there it was and so the spirit of god of course chose this city as the one containing the spiritual elements spiritual elements in it see by the fourth age because of its religion well you must understand that the major religion of thyatira was the worship of apollo try mianos they worship the god apollo and this was united with the emperor worship cult they also worship their leader they worship the one who was the leader of the country and that was a a cult to the god apollo and of course apollo was the s u n god he was the sun god here we go again here comes the sun god in opposition to the s o n of god and we differentiate between the two all right now he apollo the s-u-n god was supposedly in a form of a trinity where he was the second figure of that mythological trinity that they made up he was second to zeus zeus who they claimed was his father okay and of course he was known as the averter of evil and he presided over religious law you know as we believe in jesus the word comes from him and so this apollo was supposed to be the one from which their religious laws flowed from a total impersonation of the truth but here it is he also was the one to dispense expiation which is to say forgiveness of sins forgiveness of mistakes forgiveness of your wrong he was to be the one to make amends for for your for anyone's guilt or wrong doing from this of course you you can think on that comes their confessionary and so on and so on and confessing to priests of of that nature but praise god forevermore brother sister i want to tell you that this is the truth from the word of god now plato said it this way he explains to men the institution of temples sacrifices services to deities rights connected with death and the after life he also communicated his knowledge and he did this communicated his knowledge of the future and his father's will to men doing it through profits and through oracles my friends doing it by oracles now know this here in this ritual the ritual of contacting apollo was done by a prophetess and her name was called jezebel how significant when you think of who jezebel was in her bible in the old testament but that is to come we will take study on that later on but here she was jezebel who claimed that she was a prophetess and like a type again she sits ruling in the church on a three-legged chair a tripod this is the foundation of denominationalism this is the foundation of mystery babylon the mother of harlots with the tree two-legged chair of the trinitarian doctrine that is contrary to the original word of god here we see again in the word she delivered messages while she was under a spell of enchantment she went into trances and she would deliver these messages from the god apollo but let me say the grip of this false religion was very strong upon the people of that day and time its power was formidable and there my friends you had to you had to believe or you would have no way to strive in that society of that time for they systematically set it in such a way for some to remain poor if they believed on jesus christ and followed the way of the word and the true church and for others to grow filthy rich [Music] by joining themselves to jezebel in her tripod chair and her set up of the economic and commercial and educational systems of that day we should reflect whether that does we see many of the same things in our day and in our time now of course her power did not rest exclusively in the realm of the mystery behind her religion but it also lay in the fact that no one could belong to the gills these orders corporations that you could not belong to one of them unless you first submitted to belong to the temple of apollo and to come under the woman jezebel and her leadership and anyone who refused to join with them and to be with them in their so-called religious feasts idolatrous feasts that they had at that time and their lawless lewd or licentious uh orgies that they would have at that particular time you would be barred if you did not join in with them be barred from the unions barred from making a really good way of life or living you'd be kept away so in order to be a intrica to be in the social and economic commercial life of that that that nation that city you had to be a practicing pagan idolater along with the rest of them then the church would help you then the third tyrion priestess and the priests below her would help you if not you were on the outside and any scraps may fall your way like the beggar at the rich man's table there it is most uh striking and most direct this sayacira the word the name thyatira actually means dominating female thus we find this age is characterized by denominate dominating females of course we know a woman types the church it will seem at one woman as if i'm speaking of women in general but i'm also speaking of the church the modern church that is in the world today so i'm speaking with a two-pronged effect here that you may see through the darkness and catch the glimpses of light or lightning coming off of the throne of almighty god yes we find that as a dominating force she would invade all areas of life conquering all and despotically and domineeringly control wherever she can control let me say according to god's servant and prophet quote a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world of course to repeat it the worst the world's greatest curse is a dominating female of course the wisest man that we know in this world was solomon the judgment of solomon is revered solomon said i applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and of madness and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands are as bands see who so pleased god shall escape from her now of course he's speaking of a natural woman but this is speaking to us also typing denominationalism speaking of the control and and and and the whole the place upon the people oh let us read the scriptures but the sinner the sinners shall be taken by her behold this i have found see at the preacher counting one by one to find out the account which yet my soul secret but i find not one man amongst a thousand have i but found woman among all those i have not found you'll find this scripture in ecclesiastes chapter 7 verses 25 to 28. of course the great apostle paul has said to us most clearly and authoritatively for he said not i what i am telling you now is not me just me paul speaking these things are the commandments or the word of the lord in other words this is just said the lord paul said i suffered not a woman to teach or to serp authority oh my friends that is in your bible from the very garden of eden onward the spirit of woman evil woman placed there by the serpent has constantly and successfully tried to take control over man amen and even today we find it's this has become a woman's world uh where in actual fact men appear like ahab to be sitting in the throne and in the places of power but really it's that little woman behind the scenes that actually pulls the strings and moves those so-called mighty men so we find in the world today has become a woman's world and the modern day gods of money the modern day goddesses the beautiful women so called of hollywood not the holy words of god but hollywood and so-called fallen stars from the presence of almighty god making their goddesses this modern wicked corrupt and perverted age naked women we you we would say half dressed but now it's come down to total lewdness an absolute nakedness and as prophesied by the prophet of malachi 4 5 it will come to pass he said he saw it in the vision women dancing loudly with nothing but a fig leaf in front of them oh god have mercy if it's not fully yet here it's partially here it is on the way it's almost here run for your life samson run amen flee into christ amen flee into the word of god for safety and for deliverance lord of god amen yes sir i want you to know my friends that a woman of course it's not meant to be a dominating person she's made with a feminine spirit a female spirit which is different to the male spirit and you can see it from childhood the difference the spirit in a boy to the spirit in a girl spirit in the mail and the attitude and spirit in the female women were not made to be dominating let me say something here but the devil in his satanic eden of today has shaped the society to push and press women into certain situations where they have to be aggressive or they they're pushed out of the society or they can't make any grounds they can't gain anything now i'm not saying that's right or that's good but the devil has created the atmosphere where some women can not make it unless they become aggressive and begin to act like a man oh my friends a woman was not made to be that way you were not made to be that way you were made to be a lady a real woman to have the feminine spirit which the scripture says it's submissive to the male and this is commanded by the word of god to her a woman of course who is truly female all-female will be of that kind of a submission but listen when i speak of a woman being humble and submissive to her husband for the bible says you're not submissive just to everybody but to your own husband amen now listen that woman now speaking to men is not supposed to be a dishrag or a doormat it doesn't mean that but you who are strong should have love understanding and pity and be able to help straighten and walk with such a one such a woman whom the bible says she is placed as i help meet she is not placed as a doormat and so we must love them and take care of them protect them provide for them and let them know that they are under your shelter your protection and by god's grace his direction through you with them amen yes sir but what do we find is that they want to dominate over the mail and no real female wants to dominate her husband when a woman marries a man she wants a real man as i've said before not a mango not a mouse not a not a tobacco leaf that moves with the wind not a piece of chocolate that will melt with the heat of trouble or trial but some someone that will stand like a rock and be a gentle man amen a man but a man that knows how to be gentle at the same time he knows how to be firm and when to be firm he's not aggressive he's not growling and grumpy all the time but he knows when this is supposed to be no of course the one she wants to rule over the mail when he is supposed to be head of the household uh uh how could that be and the worst curse in this world repeat is a woman that wants to dominate over men or to act or be like man a woman like that is the worst imitation or impersonation of what it means to be a man and they will never be able to do it let's just make themselves to be a laughingstock and trying to act that way before them they will have the impression that they're taken seriously but behind them it's another matter because a man knows a real man and he also recognizes who and what is a woman now when a woman breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted she has perverted from the true will and way of god and any man that lets a woman take authority over him tie him like a string around her finger like that my friends then we find out that he is perverted in that way if he would allow that and that is why the bible tells us in the book of deuteronomy that she should not wear the clothing or that which pertain it to a man or in the new testament the bible tells us she should not cut off her well hair don't want to go into this but in the old testament a woman cuts off her hair that's like a she's telling the world she becomes a harlot and now you know they bring it into all manner of styles and everything else until it becomes it's okay just cut off your hair do whatever you want it's your life your world and you do whatever you want right and that's the way it has become but that is not the word of god the word of god tells you the woman's hair is her glory amen hallelujah and she should not cut it off amen and the opposite to the man of course that the man is supposed to cut his hair to show that he is not under any other person's man's or woman's authority amen but he should be clean shaven and oh praise god forevermore so she is never to wear the garments that even pertains or looks male she is not to do it and she's not to cut off her hair and she's not to intrude into male authority one time i was confronted by a so-called woman preacher who said to me i heard that you teach that what no woman should preach in the pulpit i said yes ma'am she said how dare you for a you know a woman prophesied in the book of acts philips daughters prophesied in the book of acts and she start to bring all these various things how jesus spoke to the woman and she ran and told the disciples how he has risen so a woman can preach and so on i said well you may say that you may even quote those scriptures but the great apostle paul on the inspiration said she shall not teach she shall not teach nor she should not usurp authority she said well my husband is right here and and and i am the preacher of that church and he i said well he may be here and you may claim you are the preacher and you may even be a better preacher it is not a matter of your talent it's not a matter of your ability it's not a matter if you're able to do it you you you're able to have that kind of talent but god is saying if you're going to be obedient to him and follow his word she shall not teach i said the reason why is because teaching presupposes that the one that is teaching has some authority over those that are receiving the teaching and she shall not teach and you shall not preach according to this word of the living god now of course i couldn't go into all of the reasons other reasons that are clearly in the word of god and that is a topic in itself that we will discuss as time goes by but of course she got angry and mad and carry like that you know women calling themselves deaconess this and deaconess that and uh calling themselves missionary this and missionary that i said well a woman can testify when it says teach there it's not talking about teaching your kids it's not talking about talk teaching in sunday school it's talking about getting up and presenting yourself as a teacher of the word as a minister the minister of the word of god no the word of god says she shall not teach nor your serp authority amen over any such position amen praise god hallelujah and so we find help here today we have an age where women have invaded the pulpit and that is a perversion of the word of god but they're not supposed to be there in the first place but to be in submission to the word and i'm saying that because i'm thinking the church ought to be in submission to jesus christ the male the head who is the word which is a symbol of the woman to be in submission to the male but as i said before that male will treat her with the greatest love like jesus treated us and treats us with the love and protection that he is willing to let down his life for us that kind of a love that will never die will last forever oh praise god the bible says and loving his own he loved them to the very end oh glory to god amen may the great holy spirit show you what i'm talking about amen this is commanded and it's something that believing sisters and even unbelieving women if they have any uh reasonable sense to them they will obey the word of god they will obey even nature what nature tells them in that way a woman is never to do that and to take authority perverting herself and vetting the pulpit like that she must not do it but stay with the word of god when she does it she shows what kind of a spirit she is really got on her and that spirit is nothing but an anti-christ anti-war spirit that is upon a woman like that that may get angry and fuming even as i'm speaking on a topic of this nature oh my i've had some get up and walk out in a huff and a puff like a like a frog bullfrog with their faces all made up angry because they are hearing the word of god the way they should hear it medicine that you should take you don't like it but it's medicine that you ought to take it drink it it will purge you and make you good make you healthy make your whole and get all that uh denominational and worldly nonsense that's been placed lodged into you the word of god is here to root it out and take it out from you and make you into the beautiful lovely creature you are supposed to be according to this word of god which says let god be true and every man's word a lie yes sir the seeds of that false catholic church buried in her to rebel against her husband the word fight against the word do everything to rebel against it but a real woman will obey the word of god but in the beginning it was not so amen in the beginning god created them bought male and female we won't talk about adam and steve because we know that god only made adam and eve now my friends here we find that god made them male and female he made the rooster and the hand the duck and the drake the cow and the bull and so on but when it came to man god the bible says created only one he only created adam there's nowhere you'll find the scriptures that at the same time he created male and female he created adam and then out of adam god took a by-product or a part of adam that's why when a man finds his true mate and they come back to being one amen it's just like eve was separated from adam that he could ever make and then the end just like the church we have been separated from the lord jesus but in the end when he calls us back we are going right back to him and we will have a complete total oneness with god and in god one with him again a praise god hallelujah amen so when the woman stepped out she was a byproduct from the original creation we are by products of the original world and have been brought here on the scene that is why we are in flesh because we are in type the weak part of the word that is subject to temptation as eve was subject to temptation also it's all in the types like that and so she also was vastly different from the other females that god had placed upon the earth because we find out she could be seduced these other females could not be really seduced and the reason for that that is because god set times and seasons for them to come into a specific mating season some month some year someday like that but with this by-product it was different with this woman this by-product it was different she was made different so she could be like that at any time until the time of life her time of life has passed away from her then no more but during that span that she has she is absolutely different from all the other females that god made who has set times and seasons making seasons that he set but the time for mating for a natural woman at any time as we can see with just common sense and this is the weakness that satan saw that he that uh and allowed him to be able to attempt and to seduce her amen and so my friends we see clearly in the word of god the fulfillment of scripture because here we see that then an evil woman becomes a picture of a picture of vulgarity looseness foulness lewdness licentiousness on one hand she's looked upon something filthy and dirty evil but on the other hand a good woman is looked upon as the thing of of cleanliness a thing of beauty amen a thing that is a symbol of holiness and a receptacle for the holy spirit amen look on one hand that false woman church is called a harlot drunken with the blood of the saints and a drinking from a cup of fornications so she's a harlot she's a drunkard and she's a fornicator according to the word of god this evil woman a type of evil women here we find satan made her that way satan influencer to have that kind of a record of harlotry drunkenness and fornications oh god have mercy so on one hand you see the woman evil becomes that way on the other hand the woman accepts the word of god and she's considered the bride of christ hallelujah on one hand the what god calls her mystery babylon mother of harlots the abomination before god and she's on the other hand the good woman that believes the word the true church is called the new jerusalem the mother above hallelujah on one hand we look again this evil woman is seen as foul and wicked and lewd to the word of god and she will be cast into the lake of fire because that's the only fit place to put her she's not locked away in that lake of fire then she'll be running the streets and running the bars and running the bat dance everywhere my friends the only way is for god to place her there but thank god the good woman that holds to the word of god our place the bible says is in heaven for in my father's house there are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you amen so one is sent to hell the bride of satan oh the bride of the so-called jesus part of the spiritual frankenstein a man made up of little pieces little denominations their denomination patchwork together to make this beast this misra babylon the art we're living in but the other one the good woman the true church she's exalted to heaven glory to god and she is in her fitting place to sit beside the word as a part of the word and to be the queen in the presence of almighty god the true queen glory to god amen so back to our subject in this manner this age speaks to the fact of dominating females and that she is mystery babylon she is the great of revelation she is jezebel promoting herself as a prophetess who speaks for god when god says she shall not teach nor usurp authority why because the true female spirit is submissive to god and his word for he is the head and the headship of the body and she has no word but his word no thoughts but his thoughts praise god hallelujah his no leadership but his leadership amen or praise god but what about this false church what has she done she cast out the word just like many will kick out and kick away their husband oh cast out the word amen all my friends destroy bibles burn bibles burn prophets burn apostles burn holy men and holy women at the stake burn them kill them destroy them in every way slain many amen put in prison and persecute laws that teach the truth of god's word and take it even further put many of them to death because they reject her trinitarian doctrine and her way of walking yes she has lots of power she controlled presidents emperors governors judges she controls all kinds of political powers armies princes nations amen while insisting that she is the true body of jesus christ but my friends she's been seduced by the devil amen she's accepted for her leadership vikers of christ so-called popes so-called cardinals and bishops where all my friends all turned away from god's word seduced by the devil and she in turn is telling the same lie they told her and seducing others into idolatry in every possible way become the pride of satan producing nothing but bastard born children to the word of god they are not of the word they are not children of the word but she is making that claim to christ that they are his children and he is saying no because they do not conform to my word their bastard born to the word of god so here we have these so-called uh denominational religions contrary to the word of god claiming that they are the children of god they are sons and daughters of god but living contrary to his word amen yes friends she has dominated through the dark ages hundreds of years over 900 years she has plundered she has persecuted jailed killed burnt at the stake amen kill out the arts and the sciences killed out all manner of of of natural excellence she has destroyed but this is our way she killed the prophets killed the patriarchs and the prophets killed holy men and then shall turn around dig their bodies up and then deem them as saints they were already made holy by god they were already prophets of god they were already god anointed man doesn't need anybody to raise them up dig them out of their graves put them into a into a beautiful place and then they're going to raise them and say we are for the arts we are for the sciences we are for this but in the original they killed it they'll kill those who would create plain submarines uh helicopters and everything else then later on they praised them as if they were originated from them always the case my friends and they produced nothing but death until the very light of the truth was almost entirely gone and only a barely a sliver of light remain the oil and the wane of god almost ceased to flow in that day but god promised he would never leave himself without a witness and though she dominated all the world kingdoms and demanded of all men pay a homage and respects to her there was one little group no matter how much she boiled no matter how much she burned no matter not she jailed no matter how much she put in prison no matter how she persecuted they would not bend they would not boil their will not burn but they'll stand by the word of god and hold to god's unchanging hand amen and god kept his little flock amen yes sir and this so-called church of rome was just as heathen a screen italia in the old testament who tried to destroy all of the royal seed that was in her day and she almost succeeded but god reserved one god hid one and kept that little one away from her oh thank god amen and he was faithful and so in this art day god has preserved and is preserving a little flock protecting them watching out for them putting a shield around them he is their rock their soul sword their shield he is their full armor to unseen harmon to protect them hallelujah and so god is preserving his little flock through this long dark night this loud deceit night of darkness all might and we know he preserved them through the thyatira night and out of that god began to raise up raise the rising of the sun the peeping out of the sunlight through the ministry of martin luther of whom we shall speak on later and anyone who knows anything about this pagan church who claims christianity but is a perversion of the word of god anyone who knows their form of worship can tell why the city of saiathirah was chosen by the holy spirit to represent what he will say and what he would do in the dark ages that was ahead of them and now this is all made manifest and it's unfolding before us and in our modern times it's right before our very eyes may god help us everyone may god bless this study to your heart to your mind take heed take warning obey god's call obey god's word and hold to his unchanging hand and rest in his love mercy and grace and he will forgive you help you straighten you and see you through your troubles and your trials may god help you may god help us all as we hold to his unchanging hand god bless us all god be with you i'll see you on sunday at good neighbor ministries 5270 new street burlington ontario canada where we will be reopening the church with just a few believers as we begin to walk and grow into the fullness of our reopening may god bless you until then take care [Music] you
