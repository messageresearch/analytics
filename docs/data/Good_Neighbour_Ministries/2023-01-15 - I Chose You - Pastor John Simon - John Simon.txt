awesome God I don't know how many of you usually join our prayer meeting last week Friday not this Friday I entered a petition for my brother he was in a dire situation where he basically lost his job though he's contracted if there's no need for products to move production then he doesn't have work he is separated from his family and he has a court order that the judge has said you have children you need to maintain them and so unable to provide an issued warrant for his arrest due to non-payment my mother left an apartment and so him not being able to pay for the apartment that he was living in he asked those who were living in my mother's apartment you know this is a situation um I need the apartment they left the apartment and when they did they took the electrical wires off they broke the plumbing they took the doors and the window so he was left with a concrete wall which they hammered a couple of places then ran a hose from the outside to the window and flooded the apartment so no food no job no work no maintenance nothing it's a really really bad situation for anyone to be in but our Lord is all always mindful because you see when you go for a job and you have a certain skill set it's not asking you just to have recommendation provide your proof of licenses now they're asking you for a police check if you go for a police check and you have a record you're not going to get hired so this is what the Lord did he had an interview at a hardware he went in and he was grateful that they took him in for the day and he praised and he was so thankful but that was a day to test his skills because anybody can say I can do this just to get a job so the owner said I'll take some time and I will get back to you on Tuesday he received a phone call the owner called him and said I would like to offer you a full-time job six days a week praise the Lord so he got a job then the Lord moved in a financial way and paid off his outstanding payments so the warrant was now reversed amazing God and it continues my sister found an electrician he went in to see what they were looking at you know he simply asked well what's the situation what's going on and as my brother explained the electrician was moved with sympathy and compassion and love so he simply gave him a list of all the materials he would need and he said I will do it for free now that is the power of a living God thank the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] Praise You Lord Jesus thank you Jesus God will never reject your prayer praying makes you stronger I have never seen the righteous forsaken begging for bread a left to suffer foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] simply worship [Music] Christ worship if you are hurting myself [Music] just lift up your hands this is your Victory Day give him the praise Worship the Lord it is important you understand when God is speaking [Music] sometimes he may seem to be silent but that is have patience just wait and see what God will do when you lift up your hands and surrender God will pull you through and please [Applause] [Music] oh God [Music] he is [Music] [Music] my love God goes before you saying let you be he's healing your wounds Angels fighting from outside [Music] why should the Lord [Music] says [Music] [Music] [Applause] together that's that's not flash friends flesh doesn't want us to worship because of his grace amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus greatest he does in me greater is he that is in me oh [Music] that is in me Satan is like foreign [Music] prayer [Applause] that is away go into the upper room [Music] visit me neither is he that is foreign glory to God you want to stand this morning to change your positions a little bit you want to sing I want that times a blessing that kind of blessing when Jacob met the Lord upon that Holy Land on my soul there alone until the morning light he won a feisty title to write in for the ride I was [Applause] [Music] and well I'll be back I was [Applause] [Music] fine [Applause] [Music] [Music] we are a chosen Grace our God is right he's waiting to be gracious the prayer of it together I was he had the blessing I want I what I was [Music] salvation [Music] I satisfy myself amen [Music] good morning God bless you thank you so much God bless every one of you musicians we appreciate it very much God bless every one of you it's a pleasure to be here in the house of the Lord amen you can take it we welcome you here by his grace that we might come together praise the lord well you know we are here to have communion you know it's communion that we're here for today don't you uh because real communion is not just the bread and the wine the prophet said the real communion is um a group of people sitting and talking and chatting with each other and eating and drinking isn't that right well that's what we're going to do here we're going to eat and drink from the word of God is that right we will take in of the Holy Spirit and we Elite of the bread of life and we'll talk to each other wishing that preaching is not a school room you understand it's it's me preaching and talking to you and you talking back to me and that's what real preaching is but the system has got the people in a state where they believe that uh preaching or teaching is like a school room and that you're supposed to sit piously quietly and listen right while the preacher speaks but that is not the case uh we are here and we ought to talk with each other and talk with him amen sometimes you won't pay me attention you take your attention over and say praise the Lord is that right now that's okay but God that's what we're here for praise God God bless every one of you here today and you pray for me while I'm preaching the word is that right because we are here in spiritual communication that God might bless us together unveil himself open up the word open our hearts to receive the word and to see the word of God Amen praise the Lord God bless you richly hallelujah praise the Lord uh where uh if I can ask her now for my text to be uh placed up on the screen then that will be a blessing I have it here uh printed out John 15 16. and my subject is I chose you uh it just so happened on Wednesday night I was praying and what I was praying about is that uh brother Christopher doesn't break into my message because he just went across you know the ice and I just said well praise the Lord amen but praise God may the Lord bless us as we look into the word of God here today I chose you you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you amen praise God that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit would remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of Thy word now we ask for the unveiling of the word and we ask father for the quickening of the Holy Spirit to come upon the word of God and praise God may you Lord anoint the Tabernacle and that you uh will receive the glory Praise Your Name May the Holy Spirit bless us now in Jesus name the Lord bless you praise the Lord hallelujah it's good to see my good friend brother Glenn here always a faithful praise God hallelujah you can be seated please amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah now um we know of course that God is good Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever amen now we know God is light is that right and in him there is no Darkness at all no darkness no he's just light he's just wisdom understanding you can carry that out but God is light and he was in the beginning you know that um he was known or we know him now that he was Elohim in Isaiah in many of the prophets we read of him saying I am the only one there is none beside me amen he was the only one Elohim there now we know that name Elohim is really plural so when he says about himself being there alone as one being but uh out of him or in him was the sons of Light and Daughters of light praise the Lord and this great uh great Pillar of Fire this great God Almighty out of that out of himself because if he's gonna get something else he can't get it from anywhere it is nothing else it's just him so um these sons and dusters of light came off from him and that's signified by the the tongues and book of Acts chapter 2 but he the great Pillar of Fire just broke pieces off from himself so we are not made of any other material our original material is God himself and we're not from the ground we're from him praise the Lord the ground produced the dust the dust that produced their bodies where we come from we are of the Earth the physical bodies of the Earth but really the spirit men and women that were ordained as he said or chosen were are the ones that he elected to come out from himself and to come down here with a specific purpose that they might glorify him and produce fruit and you you study the scriptures you see the rest of it that they will produce him that he may receive all the glory and all the praise and and all the honor amen praise God so uh to produce those Sons he had to produce them by a spoken word so he said let there be light so when he said let there be light from himself went out light and the light naturally of course you know sun moon the stars that's not what I'm talking about here I'm talking about the sons of Light that came out from the presence of God the greater light to rule the night and the Lesser ones to rule in whichever age they come to be in now we see these sons and others which we will call the Lesser lights or one songwriter call them the lore lights they they came down that they might do the will and the plan and purpose of God Amen praise this wonderful name he's wonderful isn't he praise the Lord and so we come from I wanted you to know we come from an eternal source right we come from an eternal so it's not an but the Eternal Source who is God himself we come from him right now we know Paul was expressing this which I never understood fully clearly but Paul said he he that Sanctified under one that is Sanctified is of the same source is that right looking in your scriptures you're going to find it where Paul said that but you see all these things we used to just pass over them think it just means a cleansing healing you know and stuff like that which is true it does mean that too but they uh higher understanding and revelation of the word he that sanctifies Sanctified and the one that is Sanctified is of the same Source you come from the same place you're one amen you're one with him because you're from him praise the name of the Living God so when God said let there be light you see his spoken word allowed the thoughts the things the germs the genes that were in him to now go out to be expressed and uh all they have to do is live on the earth and while they're living on the earth their lives are the light of this world none of the Skies none of the heavens but their lives become the light of this world praise the Lord in other words the Stars don't have to work of themselves the moon doesn't have to work up and oh boy I better shine up or else I'm not going to shine bright tomorrow or or the next day no it just does lives just it's just there and while it is there is a force God the opportunity to flow through them to manifest his power and his presence through his sons and his daughters all glory to God isn't it wonderful to know we are children of the most high that we are Sons and Daughters of the almighty praise God let's sing that wonderful chorus that we all know so well will walk in the light will walk in the light such a beauty full light will walk where the Dew drops of mercies are bright shine all around us but day in by night oh it is Jesus he is the light of the world Amen praise God future home uh listen I want you to know friends that first of all I'm gonna lose some quotation from this book I'm not going to stop all the time to tell you oh it's from here it's from there but if if I gave them the quotes on the back and if it's timely you you may see it up there be able to uh read it amen now we know in the beginning what's the word right now remember you spoke the word and the word um let there be light I should go backwards now if you said let there be light and there was light Let There Be seeds on the earth and the plants whatever whether he call you a seed he call you light he call you whatever it's it's you right it's how he puts us down here for his Divine Purpose praise the Lord and for his glory that's the reason why we are here but it goes on and speaking of Jesus but you must understand when the word speaks of Jesus it's speaking of you and I we as sons and those of God because we were in him we were not yet separated from him we were in him so when it speaks about him is talking back to us right you understand in the beginning John 1 1 was the word and the Word was made flesh is that right praise the Lord so just as he came from him and then he was made flesh that he might go out on the ministry to a mission to carry out what God had in his mind so we come from God and a spirit man and then he ordained a certain mother father and and and then your body was formed that you might come into expression and manifestation on the face of the Earth to fulfill his Divine Purpose that the word of God might be spread abroad the light might shine across the Earth for his glory amen praise the name of the Lord so the word was red flesh the original great attribute was made flesh in that attribute were attributes uh Sons Daughters of God genes of God Amen praise the Lord will come later to see that these genes in him were all his wife so in him was all of that amen now quoting now now remember that the the was in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us praise God are you glad you're here praise Hallelujah now the three stages of it it was an attribute first uh and as an attribute that was God that attribute was God hallelujah amen because God is the great attribute and we were in him part of him just like your hand your foot is a part of you but you don't call that God you don't call that yeah just you that's not you that's just part of you but the whole thing is God amen and so what the attribute itself is the person that the the hand is the hand of that person it's the foot of that person and so we are attributes of God we are genes of God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen now praise God that he thought of of who thought of himself then as being human or becoming human amen and so once he thought that that transmitted him him down it's him transmitted down to become Jesus to be Jesus amen and then you see the word goes on it's God transmission to Jesus right yeah praise the Lord I'm not going through the whole process transmission Jesus and Jesus to who you the elected seed of God the elected now that body had to grow and be built but it wasn't built like uh nine months it was built through the church ages it was built through the church ages praise the name of the Lord now if you'll ever be here amen if you will ever be here now Prophet speaking to the elected seed but he's talking generally and leaving his statements for the whole world to hear but the elect will recognize what and who he's talking to is that right he says if you will ever be here where is he talking about where was he that he's talking about that he was right in the same building but you see an understanding you understand now what he was talking about he said if you will ever be here you was with him then amen you was with him then for there's only one form of eternal life and that is God Hallelujah so it's just like ABC if you want to come intellectually two and two makes four one eternal and now you're going to say you're born again and you just got eternal life where you got it from you see in the first place you can't have it's not a whole bunch of Eternal lives it's one eternal life and that eternal life expressing himself through human beings amen who he elected to carry his life in him in them praise God and that's how they are Eternal they did not one day on a date become Eternal by repenting of their sins at the altar though we are supposed to repent but we repent because of the things done in the flesh is that right that is but then he turns around and says son daughter you couldn't help that you're trapped you were trapped in there and while you're trapped in there then you're moving by the nature of that you see but I I I'm not looking that because I know the devil is using that to wave before my eyes so that I could condemn you or condemn this or condemn that but I am not looking at that I'm looking at what I put in there I I'm looking at the gene I'm looking at the germ amen all these things are just him manipulating events circumstances conditions to make you look bad to make you look so evil or wrong and he thinks that that's going to stir me up to bring judgment or or or or take you out of the book which I can't because you're part of me you know so so the devil is is so foolish with his attributes and his actions that he's carrying on with that he's blinded by his own Pride that he can't see that he is absolutely a creature and a creation and that he's a loser and he can never win he can't he's a loser amen oh my praise God you see you have to be there with him because there's only one form of of eternal life that's God and you have to be a part of God at the beginning and so not what you just choose down here but he chose you Hallelujah and that's what I'm talking about here today he chose you you are in him now there's other parts of him that are doing other things in this world and through the centuries and ages there's other parts of him that he elected to do all the things that is not our concern like he told Elijah you know say what about this one no the disciples what about the other one he says none of your business what is it to you whether I let him go or let him stay or whatever you just do what you're supposed to do you are in this age living this age would you worrying about Martin Luther and this one and that one you read about them but this is not their time this is your time you're in this hour under the inspiration of the mighty Angel The Covenant Angel glory to God hallelujah amen so it's not that us a brother like I said touched a little bit on it on Wednesday night it's not that you chose him down here and and chose him and by that choosing you suddenly got eternal life no God is all knowing god god is omniscient and omnipotent he knows all those who would have loved him before he even started anything he knows amen and so he already knows who will be here and who will choose him and who will not choose him he knows that but the whole thing has to play out is that right praise God uh like for instance you may know this person here is going to try to steal my car this person here is going to put their hand in my pocket to pick pocket what I have in my pocket and you may know it but you don't have any any place for judgment or Justice until you let them do it and then catch them in the act and then you have a claim for judgment is that right praise God so God has the and for salvation the same way reverse right now he has to let the whole drama play out amen so that he he can comfort with Justice judgment salvation so he can come out with it and literally like the prophet said he will hardly even have to judge you he said you literally judge yourself because when that plays out on the great screen of Ages before you and you see yourself and everything you have done he says you think the things we're doing here just go on pass away like that he says no just like you have a tape recorder God have all the graphics all the pictures all the technical everything will replay and you can't fool around and say oh no I didn't do that oh no I wasn't here no I wasn't no it's all in front of you that's you everything is there praise God but we are forgiven from that if we are True Believers not make Believers not trying to con God you mean you're so evil like the devil that you're gonna try to pull a con game on God who knows everything you can't do it amen praise God hallelujah amen praise God Amen oh praise God it was this is all of him and all of him is all of us is that right he made us uh uh praise the Lord and this is just these little things looks like nothing to you but what he said said there that is why you man you colored man man with colors put them down here as you men and women praise the Lord that he can manifest and live through them like flowers in a field just put them in different colors they're out there each one accent the other one each one and no one color it has its beauty but put together they all produce a riot of colors that's a blessing to the entire world it's the same thing he did praise God hallelujah and thank God Jesus said you haven't chosen me I have chosen you you think you chose me and time when I'm the self-existent one right but I chose you thanks be to God I give God the glory go con now future continue in the future home now the Methodist said when you shout you got it but a lot of them shouted and they didn't have it uh brother is there any way um maybe the next time we'll try to get larger not just for me but larger fonts so that the people can read it properly even if you have to scroll it a little more yeah it's much bigger behind oh good I'm sorry Brothers sorry praise the name of the Lord um I'm not reading from there either because I have it here but when I looked there then I thought about you and said well now if it's that small how are they going to read it sir that's why I raise that up now when you shout when they shout they said they got it amen a lot of them shouted but they didn't have it it's still happening to this day a lot of people shouting and they don't have it and they claim they have it the Pentecostal said when you speak in tongues you got it and many speak in tongues and they don't have it praise the Lord look how all kinds of forms these Pharisees had amen but when the word was made manifest they did not recognize it in other words they were reading this they were reading the five books of Moses the pentateuch and you're reading all those scriptures and everything else and studying it in fine detail is showing you intellectuals will not work the Pharisees sadness is already tried it even with pins they they memorize until they can tell you with their eyes closed what verses that pin went through and stuck on and they could do it amen and still they did not recognize the word when he revealed himself because it's not by natural human recognition of intellectualism but it's by the revelation of the holy spirit that the True Believer recognizes God oh not by something you can say Oh by this skill or that skill or this knowledge but you you come to a place where you know that you know God brings you to that place supernaturally amen praise God we weren't worthy of it we want to work ourselves up into worthiness work ourselves up into Holiness work ourselves up into spiritual manifestations of activity and that made us worthy in the presence of God because we we have in healing we're having Miracles we're having dancings in the spirit and oh we're having rejoicing the services overwhelming and music that's wonderful but that's not it amen praise God you have those things but your blessed bless God Like Jesus said you better praise him that your name was already written up there in heaven your name have to be there praise God hallelujah glory to God Amen oh my oh see many in tongues they didn't have it Hallelujah but you see if you are the bride the Bride is a part of the husband amen the only place you'll ever recognize it is to recognize what part of that husband that you are praise God I'll talk touch on that little later praise God Amen you have to recognize your position recognize which part of the Bride you are glory to God now I've got courts there but sometimes I'm not even we'll look at them I'll just talk with you because you understand here what he's talking about in the in the body of of the lord of the of the church the body being built of his wife that was separated from him at at Calvary or Golgotha amen praise God you understand uh it was built through the church ages um you can go up maybe we'll find that I have the code somewhere here where he said you understand God building the body and then the foot let's say the foot was in Luther and then the this part of the body gets rid of the waste and Wesley Holiness he was preaching and then it came up to the the body came to the point of tongues where the Pentecostals come on a scene he says and now we see the seeing age seeing age what the prophet is that right oh my praise God and so we go to the seeing age with a prophet praise the Lord and then all of a sudden it goes from the seeing Edge he says after that there are no more moving parts amen why it goes to the Mind age praise the Lord it goes to the Mind age because you see after the sin Edge where the words start breaking and a few Believers start seeing they'll have a while in the message itself while they're here to begin to process that word and that word starts going through them and when it goes there like a Roman a firecracker whatever you want to call it takes them into another dimension where their breath into the very presence of the Living God they break into the spirit of the Living God and they begin to live from that Dimension or that place or position praise the Lord God help me to express amen but praise the Lord Jesus they live from that point there so I say I believe that we are past the seeing age we have past those ages we are now in the place where we are right back in the mind of God hallelujah and the entire body no more moving Parts moving around but back the only move by him only his Spirit only his thoughts amen manifesting through them for the glory and praise of God hallelujah amen see oh how many sees that amen oh see that recognize what part of that husband of the word that you are how many sees that you see that's what he's getting at way back there he understood these things so he's trying to tell those people that were still tied up in Pentecostalism tied up in this and tied up in that but he's just preaching it and hoping that somebody would see it then but he knew after he was gone that these things are going to be made manifest Amen to the three elected seed to recognize their position in the husband now to say it in clear words so that you might understand which part of that of the body you are you are not in the foot so you are not in the Wesley for the West you are not in the tongues you're not in the lips we enjoyed being with the prophet with the age of discernment and all those things we enjoyed it but then it breaks me on him and it goes into the realm of the mind or spirit and right into God himself praise God and he's saying to you now that wife must wreck or bride if you want to call her must recognize what part of the body she really is is that right praise God so you we must recognize what age and what part of the body is represented or manifested in that particular age praise the Lord a seed has processes the planting time with growing time it's this time is maturing and ripening time is Harvest Time and praise God you recognize what part of the day you are in praise the Lord that is your position praise the Lord not like we many years we thought oh you must recognize your position you must recognize if you are this or if you are that and replace people in all kinds of confusion because it's not talking about those kinds of human positions it talks about your position in Christ praise the name of the Lord hallelujah now you see then you can't recognize somebody else's position amen he's not talking about the people in the church like they might have thought you can't recognize uh brother Neville's position or brother so-and-so position that's not what he was really talking about but they might have understood it that way he was talking about in that body being built you must understand and recognize what part of that you are in there which part you are represented in where is your representation in there praise God see you can't recognize somebody else's now here it is what if Moses would have come with Noah's message see and Noah was a part was a part of it praise God but it would not work Hallelujah why would we know about Luther and all these people and it's not that we are um lessening them or putting them off uh we know they're a part of this too amen this is what he's saying Noah was a part of it but you see Moses couldn't go back and just recognize Noah's position no he had to preach what God gave him for his day for his time and to live out that part that he is supposed to play for the glory of God hallelujah it would not work what if Jesus himself would come with Moses message it would not work it's true it's right it's scriptural but the skill was not the position was not the time it was not appropriate thing to be made Express and manifest for that hour amen he was there to express Redemption he was there to express salvation he was there to express himself as the Lamb of God that taken away the sins of the world praise God he could not go back to Moses time burning sacrifices and and you see it would have been out of tune out of the rhythm of the word of God he would have been out out of that praise the name of the Lord hallelujah see it was like that because it was a different age Hallelujah it was a different prophecy different part of the word that had to be fulfilled there or in other words in his time amen and this is the last part of the word for our our church ages to be fulfilled now praise God so we're not here to fulfill what they already fulfilled we are here to fulfill this part of the word and what part you supposed to fulfill to be the wife of Christ to be the United wife of Christ and to walk with him hand in hand The King and I walk life's Road Together amen and the people are just in wonderment as we go passing by oh praise God now wonderful it's nice when a husband can walk hand in hand with his wife some wives don't like that depends on the timing sometimes I go to hold my Western and say oh get away foreign I said well this is not the appropriate time to hold my hand there's so many people all around and looking on all this kind of thing like that you know praise God but that's just the human part amen but we are walking with the King of Kings we are walking with the King of Kings praise God hallelujah now the word had to be fulfilled there there there there was in another day of the week what week oh sorry about what week the week the churches the seven days week of the church ages when he said they were in another week now another day of the week right right praise God not Tuesday's work can't do that on Wednesday see oh my and Wednesday has to be done on Wednesday Saturday's work on Saturday Hallelujah see that's the way it is praise the Lord hallelujah is that wonderful to know brother sisters that we could be right in line with the word of God keep in step with the master wherever you go Hallelujah that's the way we have to live keeping in step with the word and let him lead us right on and we give him all the praise and the honor and Glory because he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the name of the Lord glory to God hallelujah oh my yes sir we've got to recognize our position in Him Praise the Lord not in the footage we're not in the hand age we're not in the uh Wesley's age we're not in the mountains amen we're not just in the mind age and anymore where we be we are now in the dimension of life life of Life praise God the dimension of eternal life praise the Lord hallelujah praise God oh praise God we come through all those other ages and you have to come through those ages and stages that you might we might come to what we are now praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen wonderful wonderful so you must recognize too I'm making several points he chose us and because he chose us that settles it in our heart that we don't have to wrestle with the thought anymore that from the inside out we are Eternal beings in a body of time is that right the body of time will pass away that because it's eternity dwelling in time for a period of time this world is not my home I'm just a passing through my treasures are laid up Way Beyond the blue amen oh praise God you feel the holy hills of Heaven calling out to you amen oh come home come home it's suppertime oh blessed be the name of the Living God Amen yes sir now quoting from who is this Melchizedek now being eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his talk of what you was only he wanted me to stand in the pulpit and his Prophet continues to speak but the thought I'm bringing here to you listen to what he said being Eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had not that you just got amen but the eternal life that you had you already had it because you are you are part of it you are in it amen and you have it so you didn't come down here to get it you understand what I'm saying you didn't come down here to get it because you already had it praise the name of the Lord Lord we can't speak for others I'm just talking to you you if you are three elected seed and that's not for even for me to be able to uh separate that that's for God to do but I must preach the word so that he could fulfill his duty and you to know and I don't know where I am and here's wonderful praise God hallelujah amen oh yes I'm so glad go back to what we spoke on I think it's last week the spirit man God being spirit and making if you go to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 you're going to find this like two atoms because it says he God form God first of all uh you know brought Adam here and Adam was an image he says of himself right and it tells you in a Genesis 2 how God formed man of the Dust of the earth well it's not two men right or the Bible comes with itself but it's God being God as the Holy Spirit the eternal spirit Adam In His Image a spirit man a spirit being and then uh that man like we explained could not till the soil he couldn't take a fork he couldn't take a branch and dig the ground to to keep the flowers or anything so God had to form a body to put that Spirit man in and that's what happened the spirit man went into the man of Earth hallelujah praise God now today uh we find out because of sin that's how it should have been but because of sin we find that the Earth's man cannot last amen and he has got to pass away amen but that man on the inside goes to meet its maker good or bad it has to meet this maker come from God it's got to meet God and meet its own judgment praise God hallelujah amen but what the Bible tells us after death the Judgment doesn't matter that's the way it has to be Judgment of this judgment seat of Christ or the great white Throne judgment amen but after death the Judgment in the presence of the Living God Amen praise God so you understand that when God breathed the breath of life into Adam in the beginning it was an eternal life breathed into him Adam was already eternal right he was already Eternal it was the spirit of natural life that God breathed there that he that that body that he had formed could now live and move amen praise God and we thank God for that that God came like that and fulfilled his purpose like that amen praise God glory to God Amen I'm just when I look down like this is some of the scribbles and scripts I have made on uh on the parts of some of these Pages here amen glory to God works as Faith expressed the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain things and you do it but that don't mean you're saved is that right the genuine Holy Spirit can anoint you to do something and yet that don't mean you're safe think of it prophesied Judas even went and cast out devils the other side of the miracle ministry Judas was a world famous evangelist is that right Amen in other words you're taking this thing from back in those days and it's expanding and growing and coming up to our time right it's just the germ showing you what's going to happen up here right but that's what it is he he could perform Miracles he came back with the rest of the disciples Master we cast out Devils we even heal the sick in your name and that is when Jesus said wonderful but uh he says don't Rejoice over that Rejoice if your name is written in heaven is that right praise the Lord watch the events watch the scripture and you will see it's right away once they said that then he said that that's how he responded to them praise the Lord now wonderful isn't it Oh Glory to God Amen so that don't mean that you are saved right the spirit anointed him this rain falls on the just and the unjust and the weeds can Rejoice with the wheat but it is what is at the core what's at the core on the inside amen well another place he said you've got to look at what is on the inside of the inside that's the one you've got to look to find out and the word test of the word is going to tell what it is amen sometimes my wife have seeds at home and the seeds may get out of the packages and a few mixed up but you can't tell what seed is what anymore well just put it in the garden and then give it the water test it Pour some water on it and just wait a while and the next thing you know them seeds begin to sprout and each one coming up to show whatever it is amen and when you come in the house of God it doesn't matter what front what face what act what you put on amen that's why I try to tell just be yourself doesn't matter what you put on the water that is coming forth here God sending water deliberately to spray on you so that whatever seed is in your heart your life will begin to break out whether you want to or you or you don't want it it's going to happen anyway because every seed must been fought after its kind that is the law of God that's the purpose of God and it must be fulfilled praise the name of the lord it's going to be done for his glory amen praise God hallelujah isn't that wonderful how do we can Rejoice praise God hallelujah glory to God and dance in the spirit and the wheat also get in the same anointing as I praise God hallelujah and dance the same way shout the same way move in the spirit the same way but it's still different because one is manifesting eternal life and the only one is manifesting whatever it is in that way praise the Lord do you understand this or do are you understanding it even if not all of it you grasp some of it here for his glory praise the Lord oh my what How Great Is Our God you can act like you received it isn't that something ain't meeting in this in this church here and you act like you received it I don't know that because your act your act not just your actions can be so polished that they're deceiving to me as a human but God is Not deceived God is Not mocked you can't deceive him or mock him amen listen scripture you act like you received it Christians can even act like if they are Christians amen real Christians right and act on the ever so good at it right but that still don't mean that you are saved that's exactly right the spirit can be there the real Spirit the genuine Spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you but still don't mean you are safe it's that inside soul That Never Dies that's got eternal life it's God eternal life it was always was eternal life isn't that wonderful it always was eternal life blessed be the name of the Lord I'm glad we serve a God Like This amen and he's making things clear and plain to us for the glory of God now now we spined here in the word of God that um certainly friends it doesn't matter what intellectuals you have amen if that Soul doesn't come from God it cannot be real all the impersonations it can't be real amen praise the name of the Lord we bless God he's the same yesterday today and forever if we can turn to the church each book amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen according Ephesians 4 5 I think that should be page 150 I have the park paragraphs here page 150 in the church age a book Ephesians 1 4 to 5. now according as he has chosen Us in him I'm going to stop when I'm arrested to stop okay because I'm not going to finish here today I'm just bringing the word and then I feel that you know it's time then I'll just you know praise the Lord no Ephesians 1 4 to 5. according as he has chosen us I have chosen you you have not chosen me I've ordained you that you might go forth and bring forth much fruit praise the Lord amen according as he had chosen us in him praise the name of the Lord you were chosen to be an astronaut to be on the ship right out of a whole lot of people you were chosen and uh trained God called God train pressurized and everything else Hallelujah like no other human beings was ever pressurized God pressurizes us for the journey and we we were in the Messiah ship already uh and praise God we recognize we are part of him glory to God hallelujah before the foundation of the world see you were there before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto adoption now I wanted to see this here you already in him chosen before the foundation of the world but now he's talking about this next stage when you come down here this part your predestinated onto the adoption which means placing the adoption of sons where you are placed in whatever age is supposed to come up in yeah yeah it's down to this age praise the name of the Lord the placing praise God hallelujah amen having predestinated us onto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ by the word the word is going to let you know your place and position according to the good pleasure of his will oh praise God now we're going to break into a little bit of the sovereignty of God for a little while here uh jump over some parts of this now uh now not without getting too involved in the subject of the sovereignty of God for that would take a book in itself let me point out according to those verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride praise the Lord hallelujah Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride it doesn't go the opposite way now this is the age where the bride is choosing her husband no but this is the way the the systems have preached it and taught it right causing us to believe that we as our brother quoted uh you take Jesus as your savior I'm going to take him too all right oh my it doesn't work that way I choose Jesus to be my savior it sounds good it sounds poetic it sounds uh religious and brings that evokes the feeling in our hearts but that's not what it is look we can't go I'm digressing a bit here but we can't go by this human body feelings emotions and that stuff let me tell you when I was in the Catholic church and you see they were singing the Ave Maria and they were singing some of those songs beautiful I would feel it I would feel it I don't know about you but I I would feel it it was wonderful and some of those guys you couldn't see who was singing because sometimes they would put them in a place to sing it where you only hear the voices coming like from heaven right and it's beautiful and I can see why those people are trapped and they believe and and they're held like that because they get those real feelings sacred feelings they go to pray and the atmosphere created they get those pills you see but that is where this message came to pull us out of that part of your being that you will divorce from that man divorce from them things and recognize the word for your day where you accept the word is as without sensation baptism the Holy Ghost without any sensation whatsoever you recognize afterwards who you are and your position in Christ oh my then your emotions may explode after that but you recognize Who You Are the word of God strikes you and you'll recognize your position in Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their Brides today the bride doesn't simply decide she is going to take a certain man of course I know it sounds ridiculous but she doesn't just walk out there and say oh I want that one oh my that part looks so tall and strapping and manly and oh look at his abdominals look at this muscles my that's the one no she doesn't go out there and just choose like that amen at least a sensible woman don't choose like that praise God it doesn't work that way according to God see she doesn't decide she's going to have a certain man for a husband no sir it's the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his right and he quotes our text bar you have not chosen me I have chosen you amen now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world praise the Lord she's not been chosen now amen that's not what's happening now praise God this choosing of the bride was purpose where in himself she was already there amen so she was purpose in him in his mind and his being he was purpose according to election might stand hallelujah praise God oh my you can't read this any other way the heart purpose the heart purpose amen and that word put in there the prophet said it but he's talking about his love for his wife his in there he chose her with the love in his heart his heart's purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world now let's talk about you and I watch carefully now see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God Amen God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship Him so he was at the time only potentially God which is to say he was eloh him the self-existing one he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind praise the Lord hallelujah yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about the thoughts of God there are eternal amen so the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things praise God and I believe we are seeing many things now when he said it then they could not see all them things back there but now we are seeing many things by the word of God opening up to us amen oh praise God God is unchangeable in both his essence and you're a part of that is that right and behavior praise God we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning right in other words like these theologians teach he's now finding out who is going to be saved and who is going to be lost Who belongs to him and who doesn't belong to him right so God is not now learning amen Lord is he taking counselor even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge yes he knew me yes he knew me but he is not adding to his knowledge or his knowing of who is going to be part of that bride that was already purpose in him with love before the foundations of the world well we just say that easily but the prophet kind of break it down by saying before there was even a speck of Stardust many other places said before there was even one molecule or atom and nothing was there but God himself and she was a part of him she was already in Him Praise the Lord glory to God now think of it no because all his thoughts he has always had they're eternal so you always had those thoughts in him amen and will always have he's not going to lose one because he loved them and knows the end from the beginning because he is God just the thoughts of God are eternal and they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form they are already real and eternal and a part of God in other words when God think of it he sees the beginning from the end and to him everything is real already it's just some passing of time for it to translate transmit transmute and more however you want to describe it it's just for that to take place but it's been spoken all right it has been spoken now let it be done praise God that's the way God in his wonderful that's out of the Smyrna Church age praise the Lord they are already real and they are Eternal praise the Lord God hallelujah amen God is good isn't he let's continue in the church age book here I just want you to see this now now you see uh I got this I'm pausing here now and I may even end in a little while where um people are saying that you don't have any choice really you don't have no choice because if you've been predestinated then you you don't have no choice right but that's not scriptural that's not the word see and that's not something that I'm confronting now I confronting this many years ago since the 80s where people were saying these kinds of things and the spirit of God took me back to the word and began to show it right out of the church age book here praise the name of the Lord now if we go out and says now it says in Isaiah 22 22 and the key of the House of David will lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and None Shall shut his choosing his bride and he's going to talking about a key Israel right he's going to talking about the key and that key is going to be on his shoulder praise the Lord amen and when he shuts no man can open when he opens no man can shut because of um prior teaching you will understand what that is speaking about but it will become clearer and None Shall open the spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church what the Key of David signified at that time is mere Shadow which is now fulfilled when now when now fulfilled in this day Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection not his Earthly Ministry amen after his resurrection and not his Earthly pilgrimage what does this key signified the answer lies in the position of the key not in the hands of other men not in the hands of a theologian I have the master key right I have the key to decode the Bible I have the key to unlock the Book of Revelation these are the kinds of things that talk about and it sounds wonderful but they're Liars and the truth is not in them for the word of God says he alone holds the key of David no man can open up your understanding like that no man can open up your heart like that no man can open that up and when I shut you out you are shut out no man can put you in there but no matter they can preach like an angel they can sing like like Angels they can speak in tongues that cannot bless you in this dimension only he who has the Key of David that can open and said come you my good and Faithful Servants enter in to the joys of your Lord hallelujah only he can do that amen oh my it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying he alone has the use of the key for he alone opens and shots praise God oh praise God you see if you take it simple that we understand these things now we see these things not that other people may not be even hearing some preachers preaching the same thing but are they understanding by Revelation what they're hearing not talking about understanding intellectually because anybody here in English language being spoken can understand that so you can easily say oh yeah I understand but the real understanding of Revelation from the word of God hallelujah now where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does the shoulder have to do with it Isaiah 9 6 the government shall be upon his shoulder you see praise God remember keep this in the mind he just come from Jesus choosing his bride then he comes talking about the key he comes talking about the key being on his shoulder amen but what does that mean the answer is this the government upon his shoulder it comes from the wedding ceremony of the East now regards the wedding now praise God weddings now praise God when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders praise the Lord amen praise God I'm just speaking here now because those things at the time I wrote them on the side of my old church age book where right there is where God says no I chose the bride but she in turn has to accept my choice that is her choosing that is her choosing is accepting my choice and this is where the script that the quotation here the prophet is saying and now the bride has been committed to the groom why because he accept the choice that he made and so she commits herself into his hands his leadership his guidance to walk with him talk with him praise the name of the Living God and text then she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders praise the Lord I I briefly glanced at at some of that before I came and and there you know all my friends of our inward thoughts and hearts all of our being all of the things many of us we carry things you carry things I carry things that I have hid in my soul in my heart and the whole world don't know anything about it until I speak it but other than that is between Me Myself and God amen praise God what the real bride doesn't care I found the bridegroom she tells him anything she opens up a heart she speaks to him and reveals whatever is in her mind praise God and that's where we are at here today by the grace of God we have got nothing else but him he is our Everything Jesus is our everything amen Hallelujah and from there she blesses us on the groom's shoulder signifying not only is she under his Dominion are we under his Dominion we under his preeminence amen she has transferred her rights to him and he is the head and also that he Bears responsibility praise God and Care hallelujah praise God you know all the things a man should do protection provision so on so on all that is symbolized by her taking off how she used to Avail her personality Avail herself she take the veil off put it on his shoulder amen now you I I I take off the mascara I take off all the paints I take off all the ax I take off amen oh my she took it all off I want you to see the real me then amen I I I don't want you just to be attracted to me just that my beauty is just skin deep but I want you to see the real Beauty inside of the inside of me and recognize me for who I am so she takes off all the veil that she used to have hiding up her face and everything else like that amen and transformed her rights to him that he is the head and also that he Bears responsibility and care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power no system none of them have any right or responsibility and that beloved is the Key of David and I've got the key thanks be to God I got the key the word has opened up and once the word opened up he gives us the key the Revelation is the key amen the revelation of the word of God now don't you see why the Bible become a new Bible and you read all them chapters that you've read through the Bible maybe I don't know how many times you read through it and yet when you go back over and you read again you can't hardly get out of one chapter or maybe one verse will grab you and you can't get away from that verse whether Branham got that scripture over there about job and he says I've been preaching three months and I can't get away move I can't get away from job on the aspile I I I can't get them off of there until God said okay you you preach enough about that and then he could move on but he was right there and that's so with every one of us sometimes you wake up one morning and one scripture strikes your mind it won't leave you all day maybe I won't leave you the next day it'll keep you like that until out of that he's able to show you what he really wants to tell you out of the very scripture that's the way it is and I'm going to close right here now praise God he for new God being sovereign for new by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him but that does not mean she did not have any part in that because she had to commit herself to him praise the Lord amen oh my Hallelujah he called her she did not call she did not come on her own amen he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone amen she is Holy committed to him while the musicians are coming amen and he accepts that obligation he is our head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is our Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight is that your Delight is that your joy that is our peace amen praise the name of the Lord when their ring those golden Bells and why that caught my attention because it it has a part in there I can't even remember the entire song word for word but it just keeps coming and then my chosen ones within those Gates and that's worth everything one of his chosen ones called by him and we go be up inside those Gates praise God I believe we already been invited into the portals of Glory and God opening up and revealing to us glorious and wonderful things do we have that wonderful tongue there's a land [Music] that we call the sweet forever decree one by one one by one will gain the portals [Music] with the Immortals [Music] for you and me ringing don't you hear the angels singing that's a Glory Hallelujah you believe in that power of sweets forever just beyond The Shining River when they bring those clothes and bells for you amen we'll Sing and Shout we'll dance about the lamb will dry our tears will have one grand home coming week that first ten thousand years this is what I wanted when we're in sight those let's see it believers and learn a lot of things [Music] [Music] send everybody will sing and shout will dance about the lamb will drive our tears [Music] ten thousand the Precious Blood of God's own son the Precious Blood of God's own son has saved and Sanctified if I Wanderers [Applause] and they are called The Bride the hair neglected and despised and despise someday the Lord will bring those jaws and ones within those days when we're inside those cats apart will learn a lot of things foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that's the truth that's the word of God to be within those portals and to be able to recognize the word for your day oh only the chosen ones of God are invited within those portals and to be with him and while we sing there I was just thinking why brother Branham so loved this little chorus and to think that he understood what he was singing from way back there not just about heaven and all of that that's part of it but to the chosen ones called within those Gates their understanding the Revelation lights up and their whole life is opened up with the presence of God aren't you glad do you believe you're one of those chosen ones I believe I'm one of those chosen ones come on say it after me I believe I'm one of the chosens I am one of the chosen I am one of the Chosen and you can sing I am one of the few I am one of the chosen I believe it praise God one in a million praise God come along brother Anthony [Music] [Applause] [Music] to follow me is home I always foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah you're dismissed this morning thank you God have a wonderful week amen [Music]
