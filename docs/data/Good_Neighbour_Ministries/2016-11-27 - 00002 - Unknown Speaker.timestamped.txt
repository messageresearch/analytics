[0:00] for the grace of God we're no better
[0:04] than anybody else there's nobody better
[0:06] in here than anybody else there's good
[0:08] businessman there's lousy businessman
[0:10] there's good new years there's auntie
[0:12] cleaners just using examples right here
[0:16] it is what it is but that attribute God
[0:20] cannot be compared to you can't compare
[0:25] that that's because God a lot of the
[0:27] love procreation to create human beings
[0:31] that would live in this dimension have a
[0:33] soul have a soul have an intelligence
[0:37] have a part of mine have the ability to
[0:40] recognize to see to hear to do to walk
[0:44] into all those things but one thing
[0:48] behold I show you we shall not all sleep
[0:52] but we shall be changed you see that's
[0:58] divine revelation that's something that
[1:00] only God can give you that mystery of
[1:02] what he wrote in his worthless what's
[1:05] inspired behind his word that is
[1:08] something that you cannot give to
[1:10] somebody God gives it to them God gives
[1:15] them that awakening God get from that
[1:17] eye opening experience where they say I
[1:19] see so you mean I wasn't baptized oh my
[1:23] goodness I was baptized as a baby I
[1:27] didn't repent baby can't repent you mean
[1:32] I gotta be baptized in the name of the
[1:36] Lord Jesus I gotta be immersed into that
[1:38] water I gotta be dead to my look like I
[1:42] gotta be very that's what it represents
[1:43] that's why it when an atom an individual
[1:46] catches out
[1:47] their life changes they realize oh my
[1:51] goodness I'm not covering God's provided
[1:52] way because God's Word cannot lie but
[1:55] and if I say that Nevada need to be
[1:58] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:59] Christ and I got baptized as a baby and
[2:03] I turn around and I say that I stand to
[2:05] that I'm actually rebelling against the
[2:08] Word of God because God can try God is
[2:12] the same yesterday today and brown so
[2:15] for some of the I don't care how sincere
[2:17] you where I gave millions I don't care
[2:20] [Music]
[2:22] exactly you really give it back to God
[2:25] when he gave you but one thing that God
[2:28] loves and God is pleased by is when an
[2:31] individual catches his word and says
[2:34] repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:37] the Lord Jesus I'm just use knives
[2:38] accepted because you're honoring his
[2:40] word and be baptized that anymore you
[2:42] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:44] Spirit and that's what washes you that's
[2:47] what makes you a son or daughter of God
[2:50] that's what places you and identifies
[2:53] you with the word of God if you see but
[2:58] mrs. simple teaching and I'm just here
[3:01] to as an attempt to show you how the
[3:02] world they can claim Christianity at all
[3:05] Trump he's the man that God has chosen
[3:08] he's the love that that's going to lead
[3:10] us and guide us and all of a sudden the
[3:12] Word of God doesn't need much anymore
[3:17] they go up to the mizane have you
[3:21] received the Holy Ghost since you
[3:24] believe I see you're believing I see
[3:26] that you're doing you're claiming Christ
[3:28] you're cleaning Christianity I see you
[3:31] go to church there by Sunday I seen you
[3:34] do a dissolute I know that's good but
[3:36] how do we see the Holy Ghost because if
[3:40] the same spirit that raised Christ from
[3:42] the dead dwells in you
[3:44] it will quicken your mortal body out of
[3:47] this dimension and away from Armageddon
[3:50] that's kind of there's going to be a
[3:53] great tribulation it's going to strike
[3:54] the land we're going to 1,000 years of
[3:56] peace but before that there's going to
[3:58] be three and a half years of hell oh boy
[4:03] nobody's going to be put the movies you
[4:05] know my views everything's calm right
[4:06] now is cool everybody's happy you know
[4:09] it's all good but you know that can one
[4:11] that can change and one more definite
[4:14] change my I'm 680news we just heard this
[4:18] is what's making news this morning
[4:20] California apparently has had a huge
[4:22] earthquake and they apparently made
[4:25] there's no communication and we just
[4:27] heard that the Canadian Armed Forces
[4:28] I've just said some CIA teams over there
[4:31] to see what's going on we'll keep you up
[4:33] to date 10 minutes later guess what they
[4:38] can't even find telephone they're all
[4:40] right they swear the rover in third
[4:42] grade art oscillator over it but the
[4:44] land is done that's a prophecy since I
[4:50] cannot change that prophecy God brought
[4:53] it to a profit in this twentieth century
[4:55] said thus saith the Lord California is
[4:58] going to sink every everything he said
[5:04] came to pass yeah we can't change that
[5:08] we can't do anything to change that
[5:11] that's just a word of it amen glory to
[5:16] god bless the Lord Jesus let's move on
[5:21] so where are we now next slide because
[5:26] it's important for us to realize you
[5:30] don't have to pick up these images you
[5:32] know some brothers in the message now
[5:38] look at them and I think Bob it's good
[5:41] there's you know there's some really
[5:42] good information in there and you know
[5:46] we need to realize what God has done in
[5:48] our day and we're we're and we need to
[5:51] see that you know we know that the rap
[5:53] is going to be an event and it's an
[5:56] event that's in progress right now but
[5:58] yet when it culminates it will be over
[6:01] and you become and that would be the
[6:04] interpretation of the rapture that
[6:07] begging of you are supposed to show up
[6:09] at work you're not going to show up your
[6:12] bosses goes oh I guess it said she said
[6:15] two days three days four days all of a
[6:21] sudden one of the other employees comes
[6:23] up and says you know what they can't
[6:25] find him or her anywhere and all they
[6:30] would talk to me about when they would
[6:32] sit down and we would talk a little god
[6:34] was that they were going to go to match
[6:37] one of these days States I know some of
[6:41] you know people in a go boy you know I
[6:44] got so much life to still live I don't
[6:48] know this is Raptor dunno like would

[6:53] want to have I got things same old wood
[6:56] board I tell my kids because sometimes
[7:00] they bring up that I tell listen let me
[7:03] tell you what a bit when you get there
[7:06] you not be too concerned about go back
[7:16] that's a prop I don't stop to see right
[7:21] now I know it's a little difficult to
[7:23] comprehend right now because come down
[7:25] and talk about this / how many years
[7:29] [Music]
[7:31] it's going to happen it's as sure as
[7:36] tomorrow is as sure as you can walk
[7:39] outside of the sun is shining right now
[7:42] it's a guarantee that it's going to
[7:44] happen so it's a it's an event and it's
[7:47] something that is building up and we got
[7:50] to see where it is that we're at and so
[7:52] looking over the last 50 60 years we see
[7:56] that God sent us a product and those
[7:59] were the years of preparation from 1946
[8:02] all the way up to 1963 I want you to
[8:05] know too that there were burned offense
[8:08] at all of these pinnacle moments in time
[8:12] there were worldly nuts go back to
[8:15] nineteen forty six it was Israel moving
[8:17] back into her homeland you want to know
[8:20] about Israel always watch Israel and you
[8:22] wonder love 1946 that was the end of
[8:24] World War two it was the beginning of
[8:27] Israel becoming the nation these were
[8:29] world-changing events things that have
[8:31] happened for thousands of years okay
[8:35] turn to bring into place you know tiny
[8:38] CC world events that are taking place
[8:41] and see where we all get into the whole
[8:43] situation and here 1963 here comes the
[8:47] mighty angel himself comes down on
[8:49] sunset
[8:50] to open the second seals of God amen and
[8:55] there was world offense that were taking
[8:58] place back then presidents were being
[9:00] assassinated well it was changes in
[9:03] America and things were happening in the
[9:06] world the doors black moves and there
[9:08] was visitation to the boat for the first
[9:10] time in America there was those things
[9:13] that were happening and people would
[9:15] just think all these are just these are
[9:17] just events they don't have any real
[9:20] significance but I'm telling you that
[9:21] they do they always have they always
[9:24] will you can go back to all the major
[9:28] events listen this is just plain history
[9:30] people on the tapes other videos you
[9:33] want to go back and you wanna you want
[9:35] to check this out you want to go back
[9:37] and look up the history of Israel and
[9:39] find out how Israel bidden to every
[9:42] major event and look at the history of
[9:44] Israel and how the Spanish Inquisition
[9:47] and the coming to America and all the
[9:51] all of the all of those events that
[9:53] surrounded Israel they were
[9:56] world-changing events World War two do
[10:02] you know that that whole war was around
[10:04] a psychotic demon power that God Braves
[10:08] nothing about to be raised up in order
[10:11] to come against than the nation of
[10:14] Israel for one purpose so that God can
[10:20] force them back into their own land so
[10:23] that God could put it in their hearts
[10:25] that they needed to be restored back to
[10:27] the original place where god bless them
[10:30] we're gonna be with them and you as
[10:33] son or daughter of God when you came
[10:34] into that that that first revelation of
[10:37] God you wonder why all the tribulation
[10:40] while all of the fighting and all the
[10:44] character building that God was doing so
[10:46] that he can get you back into your
[10:48] rightful position as a son or a daughter
[10:52] of God you wonder why these tribulations
[10:57] come upon your life well you got to see
[11:01] the stage down in because we are in the
[11:05] midst of Revelations 10 8 to 11 where
[11:10] the bride now takes the book remember
[11:12] all the way angel came down now these
[11:15] are things i'm just going to highlight
[11:16] these these events you need to go back
[11:18] and read and study and look into the
[11:21] seven seals and see how how significant
[11:24] all of these events were to you
[11:26] personally because when you first came
[11:29] in and any were told to take the bunk
[11:32] and eat it that's the stage where it's
[11:34] sweet everybody remembers the honeymoons
[11:37] names no oh it was boring stories
[11:41] everyone my god I can't believe look at
[11:44] this oh sure fancied the mystery of
[11:48] iniquity what really happened to
[11:49] gardenia wasn't an ass glory to God I
[11:52] think doesn't it make sense if somebody
[11:57] knows that they're naked by eating an
[11:59] apple like like the woodland what says
[12:03] his attic so the mystery man in Rio's
[12:07] sweet revelations of what women took
[12:09] place in the garden that it was an
[12:11] adultery that that even done with the
[12:14] sir
[12:15] platform on another lineage of children
[12:19] but it was all for God's purpose because
[12:21] remember he wanted to be a same here you
[12:23] want to compare him deeper you can't
[12:25] repeat or save something that isn't lost
[12:27] or redeemable so God wanted to express
[12:31] all these attributes and here you are
[12:33] ether all this and you're getting the
[12:36] answer to every question in your heart
[12:38] about doc I couldn't believe it every
[12:41] question that was in my heart about the
[12:44] Word of God here it was pouring it like
[12:47] squeeze them oh my goodness the guy had
[12:54] understanding the oneness of God and
[12:56] that he's not a Trinity he's not 31 he's
[12:59] you know that that he was in offices he
[13:02] was just expressing himself all these
[13:04] revelations on the water baptism on
[13:06] property being baptized ensuite because
[13:09] now you are coming God's provided way
[13:11] and God is obligated to honor his word
[13:14] not man God's not going to honor some
[13:17] man's interpretation when I will because
[13:19] I stood when I was first born again and
[13:21] I received the word that I stood the
[13:23] Baptist ministers and they would tell me
[13:25] about the Trinity now I'm just trying to
[13:27] see what I can't understand the Trinity
[13:30] like the weirdest places will look that
[13:32] just take a loony there's more quarters
[13:34] in a little what's the veloute I said
[13:38] home somebody
[13:44] if they need to make sense but you see
[13:48] God was all thing your understanding and
[13:50] sweet look we took that book and you eat
[13:53] it and you fell and you even Joyce over
[13:56] it but then you know what happens
[13:58] anything you eat something goes into
[14:00] your digestive system starts moving
[14:03] through your body starts dealing with
[14:05] certain things you could eat you know
[14:07] that you can eat something good and
[14:09] because there's something bad in there
[14:11] you've got problems right because you've
[14:14] got a bug in there that needs to be cast
[14:16] out and when that bug is being cast out
[14:19] its Old Glory up it's not easy to leave
[14:24] this message brother I don't want you
[14:27] but even this week I fought like crazy
[14:30] against the end I below you but it was a
[14:34] battle like you have no idea I'm not
[14:37] going to give it would but I'm just
[14:39] telling you this is not going to be
[14:42] party time while we're here right you
[14:46] are going to fight if you're going to
[14:47] read you're going to stand as a son of
[14:50] god you're going to have to you're going
[14:52] to have to pay better huh you're going
[14:54] to have to deal with the bitterness of
[14:56] feeling look with the word of God in
[14:59] your life because it comes and that's
[15:00] the one thing that the devil cannot
[15:02] personally is he eating impersonate a
[15:05] lot of the movie praise the Lord yes the
[15:08] word of the Lord Oh docs have a problem
[15:10] anybody can do that there's a lot of
[15:13] message searches that are laying it on
[15:14] town centre comic praise the Lord
[15:16] hallelujah but then real character no
[15:20] care serum no revelation no real
[15:24] revelation of the word of God they're
[15:26] gone by under law
[15:29] kind of disgrace where they taking the
[15:31] word told me too far this way or too far
[15:34] that way not realizing that there's that
[15:36] there's a life and there's a character
[15:38] that God is trying to develop it you
[15:41] because that's what you do take that's
[15:43] the one thing that you as a son or
[15:45] daughter of God remember we don't just
[15:47] go through a three-and-a-half-year not
[15:49] even yeah it's going to be good the
[15:52] three and a half years after that we got
[15:55] to come back here for a thousand years
[15:57] to reign with Christ and to remove the
[16:01] price on the earth in the Millennium
[16:03] don't forget that you think you got rid
[16:07] of this yeah you're going to get rid of
[16:09] this you can still have to deal with
[16:11] this it arms right here on this earth
[16:14] what God places you into this dimension
[16:17] to move with him for a thousand years
[16:19] looks very peaceful it's going to be
[16:21] peaceful but you still can be character
[16:24] do you mean character dog character
[16:26] comes from battles battles that was
[16:32] produced characters suffering produces
[16:34] character suffering do you know the same
[16:37] battle sometimes over and over and over
[16:40] it's because you haven't written over
[16:43] and over because you haven't heard the
[16:45] dogs go to putting that character i
[16:47] believe god for them putting you until
[16:49] place
[16:50] to repent if you realized I was wrong
[16:53] and you're going to realize that it's
[16:54] Lord take this pride away from you take
[16:57] this take this thing away from me that
[16:59] wants to a rule that wants to win I
[17:02] don't want it anymore see that something
[17:05] that you cannot that no better than how
[17:08] can you impersonate that and that's what
[17:10] good and that's what's tough that's the
[17:13] part that time evidence that you know
[17:15] what God wants you to have cared so that
[17:17] he can use you so that you can be useful
[17:20] in the kingdom of God so that you can do
[17:23] your part now which is that you must
[17:26] promise I again you must bring forward
[17:28] the word you are the word for this
[17:30] generation I'm doing right now what
[17:33] we're experiencing right now not just me
[17:36] up here speaking like you down there
[17:38] hearing you recognizing you are
[17:40] fulfilling than word God
[17:43] [Music]
[17:50] you are filling the Word of God you are
[17:54] in Turkey where to copy customer we see
[17:57] the word up and you're saying amen to
[18:00] the perk up and that's the part that
[18:03] this bride she's now in the midst of all
[18:05] that but in the midst of all of that
[18:09] there's world events that are taking
[18:12] place your part remember you gotta stay
[18:16] focused on who you are don't get too
[18:20] caught up one of these romancin in it no
[18:23] more than what do they mean what do they
[18:26] order they fit I'll let the fivefold
[18:29] ministry bring it in the teaching of the
[18:32] word through i pastored through enough I
[18:35] hold this
[18:38] Kenisha worked up I'll let that be done
[18:42] in God's time to season but for now I'm
[18:45] going to stand my post food I'm going to
[18:47] stand in my position what is that I'm
[18:50] supposed to do in a moment how do I fit
[18:52] in this church Mike this is what we are
[19:07] dealing with we've got to recognize our
[19:11] carpet gotta get into our decision and
[19:13] do what God wants us to do and so I
[19:16] watch your readiness up while all this
[19:20] is going on while we're in the midst of
[19:22] fulfilling revelations 10 8 to 11 and
[19:26] this firm is going for we are standing
[19:30] on the Word of God you hear ministers
[19:32] every something getting up there
[19:34] preaching word you pull it up there and
[19:36] tell the people what God has done in our
[19:39] paying that you know that there's a way
[19:41] there's that there's a way out of this
[19:43] mess everybody's looking for some
[19:45] political way out of this mess there's
[19:47] no political way out of this mess the
[19:51] word you cannot write the word of god
[19:53] what is going to happen is going to
[19:55] happen and all you can do is allow the
[19:57] prophecy to people built but in the
[20:00] midst of that I want you
[20:01] guys what brother prior to set about
[20:03] this dry and about this stage that she
[20:08] was in now we know that brother Graham
[20:24] talked about the third coat mystery of
[20:29] Christ revealed tying a season where
[20:32] there would be a change another
[20:35] dispensational change in we know that in
[20:37] 1963 when the mighty angel came down and
[20:40] what brother branham introduced the
[20:42] mighty angel to this generation there
[20:44] was a dispensational change you need to
[20:47] know that you need to realize that what
[20:50] he was preaching price in history of God
[20:51] revealed he says I want you to notice
[20:53] the clock it's at two o'clock the second
[20:56] pool is over the third pole now begins
[20:58] and when the third goal moved into its
[21:01] its phase of the ministry that was when
[21:04] there was a change and a dispensational
[21:07] change where it might be a Djinn himself
[21:09] that was going to come down where
[21:11] brother friend was going to go off the
[21:13] sea and the mighty angel Christ Himself
[21:16] was going to come on the scene and he
[21:18] was going to possess a people by the
[21:20] only of that seventh seal he said that
[21:24] seventh seal would not be something that
[21:26] you could easily interpret he says don't
[21:29] even try to interpret it it'll it'll be
[21:32] its own interpreter right you will not
[21:35] be able to impersonate like sexy boy you
[21:38] will not give in to it
[21:39] Christ it will be a light it will be a
[21:42] manifestation and that's why you know a
[21:44] lot of us at our time in our season you
[21:47] know could have been 30 years for so 20
[21:49] years ago five years ago six months ago
[21:51] whatever it is but there would be a time
[21:54] in a season where the Word of God would
[21:56] be spoken through the final ministry
[21:59] through the revelations are and it would
[22:01] call you in to your position call you in
[22:04] to the placing of the church give you a
[22:06] position in the church give you
[22:08] revelation inspiration that is way
[22:11] beyond the revelation that people are
[22:13] feeding on right now and so here we are
[22:17] now that the third pulled ministry we
[22:21] know that revelations 10 147 was
[22:23] fulfilled by the one man Ministry of the
[22:26] seventh church age William R and
[22:28] therefore revelations 10 127 was the
[22:31] Ministry of the shout and so the shout
[22:34] was between 1963 and 1965 and that was
[22:39] were brother Brandon the voice of the it
[22:42] was the voice coming out of brother
[22:44] Brett that was that was actually
[22:46] shouting and calling people to the
[22:49] attention of the money to himself to the
[22:52] message of the hour to the revelation of
[22:54] her that we are going to actually feed
[22:56] upon that was the shout of message going
[22:59] forth and calling sons and daughters of
[23:03] God that shelf still continued because
[23:06] it was a rep
[23:07] move from brother branham into the pride
[23:13] into the pride of christ into those
[23:16] whose names were written in the Lamb's
[23:19] Book of Life those are the sons and
[23:22] daughters of God and so we moved into an
[23:24] hour from 1963 there's always a plenty
[23:28] but then there's the voice there's the
[23:31] voice stage of the ministry with a pride
[23:33] is now she's actually the final voice
[23:36] she's the voice of God she has the
[23:38] revelation you don't know what it is
[23:40] that you're actually speaking that
[23:42] revelation you're living in your life
[23:44] you've been investing in you women the
[23:47] way you dress knowing presenting
[23:48] yourself and the way that you treat your
[23:53] your your your husband's and lot of
[23:55] husbands where you treat your eyes
[23:56] according to what Bob you're fulfilling
[23:58] the scripture you're living out the word
[24:01] is the voice is the light amen and so
[24:04] here we see that all through that that
[24:07] time you go back and you listen to all
[24:10] the messages that were a mother a
[24:12] greater than Solomon is here the
[24:14] manifestation of the mighty God all
[24:17] those messages he was introducing the
[24:19] mighty angel he was also shouting the
[24:22] message that we needed to feed upon and
[24:24] when you heard it he said take the book
[24:26] take that revelation eat it feet on it
[24:28] and move on to the next stage now in
[24:32] Revelations Teddy 211 and toxic o that
[24:35] thou must prophesy again and this is
[24:37] what we're talking about now we're
[24:38] living this
[24:39] we're living this message were in the
[24:41] midst of all these world events but
[24:44] we're not to get caught up by world
[24:45] events we are to stay in the channel of
[24:48] a word that's been revealed to us amen
[24:52] and that's what's going to give us
[24:54] perfect faith to overcome this Great
[24:58] Tribulation that's going to cover model
[25:00] and it may look good right now in
[25:03] America all they got an unprecedented
[25:04] things are going to get better there 20
[25:06] trillion dollars and dad they're still
[25:08] in 20 trillion dollars in debt they just
[25:10] got another chief commander that has to
[25:13] deal with 20 trillion dollars in debt
[25:14] and all the things that he's talking
[25:16] about I'm sitting on a natural stuff
[25:18] because people they're looking for
[25:20] they're looking for a savior they're
[25:21] looking for they're gonna you know their
[25:23] third they're gonna be able to live like
[25:25] in the land of paradise you know my life
[25:27] is going to change all these people
[25:28] applauding for Trump they're believing
[25:29] that they're gonna have a new bike could
[25:31] have job so you make a lot of money
[25:33] everything's going to get better it
[25:35] ain't going to get better not because
[25:38] I'm telling you ain't gonna get better
[25:40] because the Word of God shows clearly
[25:42] that the prophecy is not the things to
[25:45] get better therefore these two campers
[25:48] and so just because you know last week
[25:52] that the stock market rounding a
[25:54] thousand points is the biggest rally
[25:56] that advances 2011 because of the new
[25:59] president all of a sudden I think
[26:02] everything's going to be just fine but
[26:06] there's still 20 trillion dollars in
[26:08] debt and what trouble is proposing is
[26:11] going to take them so much deeper into
[26:13] debt that it doesn't even make logical
[26:16] sense what do you see but they're trying
[26:20] to make sense of it the trunk of the
[26:22] Brandon somehow miraculously change
[26:24] everything it can't change everything
[26:27] you can't change the word of god that's
[26:29] why and that's what working and I want
[26:33] you to see something here it's not a
[26:36] good thing while you just look at it and
[26:40] say all you need during that time that
[26:47] the bride is
[26:50] the voice in the last dayz during that
[26:54] season there's a stage in there where
[26:59] there's a preaching to the totally lost
[27:02] you know that what Jesus just before the
[27:05] resurrection now to the totally lost
[27:09] means that let's get this right here if
[27:12] you are a son or a daughter of god you
[27:16] can't be loved us okay sound okay so if
[27:24] you're a good college of Sweat right now
[27:28] if you want an old boy you mean this
[27:32] message is being preached to the totally
[27:34] lost yeah this there's individuals out
[27:43] there that can never be saved if they
[27:48] accept Christ they can be saved we're
[27:51] talking about two levels of salvation
[27:53] here but when it comes to get out of
[27:56] here before the great tribulation
[27:58] strikes the earth that only to a chosen
[28:03] elect group of God that he speaks about
[28:07] in the book of Revelation of those whose
[28:10] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[28:13] Life from before the foundations of the
[28:15] world you and I cannot change the names
[28:19] that are in there those names were put
[28:22] in there before you and I came here
[28:24] don't think oh I have to do something
[28:27] good in order to get in there no God
[28:30] already knew who would accept him and
[28:34] who would not he didn't make them in
[28:36] such a way that there would be robots
[28:38] and say okay you accept me you
[28:40] you exactly you don't know everybody has
[28:43] an opportunity to accept trust everyone
[28:47] there's nobody that is not that you
[28:50] people up to them and say brother you
[28:52] want your life to change but right you
[28:54] while you're like to change you can
[28:55] change it right now by accepting Jesus
[28:58] Christ as your personal Savior and
[29:00] repent of your sins and turn from God
[29:03] and get baptized in the name of the Lord
[29:04] Jesus Christ your life will change for
[29:07] the better because God will honor his
[29:10] word but you cannot change what somebody
[29:15] says I don't want I will have it and
[29:20] there's going to be people like that
[29:23] they're just going to say no thanks I
[29:25] don't believe it I don't believe what
[29:29] you're telling me and that you cannot
[29:32] change and so that's where the
[29:34] government comes in where you were going
[29:36] to actually be speaking to those that
[29:38] are totally lost there's nothing you can
[29:40] do to change so that element it's a bit
[29:44] of a disappointment when you think about
[29:46] it but God didn't put you in full
[29:51] responsibility of saving everybody
[29:53] that's not your position your position
[29:56] is to recognize your day your message
[29:59] and your revelation that God is giving
[30:01] you in your day and live it and do your
[30:04] part ken behind the ministry do what it
[30:07] is that God is showing you that you're
[30:09] supposed to be doing don't hold back
[30:11] from serving God for giving to the
[30:13] kingdom of God for doing what it is that
[30:16] God
[30:16] don't give up keep pressing on there's
[30:23] so much more that we have to do it once
[30:26] it's all done we leave it's that simple
[30:30] so in closing this is just no way I've
[30:36] got so many calls here and just seems
[30:38] like I can't get to them but you know
[30:42] program says here and now I'm persons
[30:44] like ourselves we're going to be cut out
[30:47] of all that together that's exactly
[30:49] because they won't be able to do it it's
[30:51] tightening and then when that time comes
[30:54] and the press comes to a place to where
[30:57] your press down and watch what I am
[31:00] fixing to tell you in a few minutes
[31:02] watch the third pull then it will be
[31:04] absolutely to the total loss but it will
[31:08] be for the bride and the church so
[31:12] there's going to come a point when that
[31:14] truck comes down and I believe we're in
[31:16] the midst of a truck all right now sees
[31:19] or we are being called to separate
[31:21] ourselves to dedicate ourselves
[31:23] rededicate ourselves to the Word of God
[31:26] and allow this revelation to change us
[31:29] and to get into our positions as sons
[31:31] and daughters of God because at that
[31:33] moment there's going to be a lot of
[31:35] supernatural change that's going to come
[31:37] over you it's going to be a revelation
[31:40] that's going to change you it's going to
[31:43] transform you from this dimension into
[31:45] that other dimension and notice when the
[31:48] third bowl of his ministry come the
[31:50] first was the healing of the sick we see
[31:53] the first ball to brother drives
[31:54] ministry we've seen that and if you look
[31:57] back you'll see three Bulls in every
[31:59] ministry Jesus when he was out there he
[32:02] had his first full ministry
[32:04] was to the people he'll become the sick
[32:06] you know raising of the Dead all the
[32:08] supernatural elements and then come the
[32:10] second fuller because the preaching of
[32:12] the word where all of a sudden the work
[32:15] you this is going to happen this is the
[32:18] scripture this is what's being fulfilled
[32:20] this is what's still to be fulfilled I
[32:22] am the fulfillment of that scripture you
[32:25] know you you as an individual you are
[32:27] the fulfillment of the scripture that
[32:29] God has allocated to this day this hour
[32:32] this season and you are actually
[32:34] fulfilling just like Jesus did the first
[32:36] a second in the third pole in every
[32:39] aspect of our own history the second was
[32:42] reviewing their organizations prophesied
[32:44] what they have done what they were and
[32:47] what was coming what is what his will
[32:49] come what wasn't it will come that's
[32:52] what he done is that right but his third
[32:55] pole was when he preached to the loss
[32:57] that couldn't be saved the Lord and
[33:01] that's when he was preaching for the
[33:03] lost that's when the world had gotten
[33:07] into such a condition where they
[33:09] believed that they could have a leader
[33:12] raised up and change their America that
[33:17] they do have somebody an individual that
[33:20] could change the world there's only one
[33:22] individual that can change the world
[33:24] there's only one individual that can
[33:26] change your world that's Jesus Christ
[33:29] your Savior Carly
[33:35] [Applause]
[33:38] amen that the musicians come lost could
[33:44] never be safe they had been chanted
[33:46] mercy listen America rejected mercy back
[33:50] in 1963 when brother brother had gone to
[33:54] America and he thought around America
[33:56] over and over and over again to the
[33:59] point where he hath of reach i infect
[34:01] dis generation for the second
[34:03] crucifixion of Jesus Christ because they
[34:05] rejected God's mercy they didn't realize
[34:09] that God had sent the Prophet you go
[34:11] back into the Old Testament you all
[34:13] you'll see every time Israel rejected
[34:16] the word of the Lord they went into
[34:19] chaos there was no good that would come
[34:23] out of it and so here his first full
[34:27] healed the sick it was too late then
[34:32] it's all over and the message will go to
[34:35] the totally lost just like it did in the
[34:38] days of Noah seven days in the ark seven
[34:41] Church ages all the time it hasn't hit
[34:45] in the days of Sodom Jesus himself in
[34:47] his third stage of his ministry he went
[34:50] preached the souls that were eternally
[34:51] lost that were in prison that we had to
[34:55] not long suffering in the days of Noah
[34:58] there's people that are just imprisoned
[35:00] by their own doctrine by their own
[35:03] beliefs their souls that are imprisoned
[35:06] by doctrine their prison by their either
[35:09] by the teachings as y'all you know my
[35:12] traditions and my teachings are good
[35:14] enough you talk to women Catholics
[35:16] things up oh it's our
[35:19] addition to do this first communion and
[35:21] all of these different sacraments you
[35:23] can't find in the Bible and try to tell
[35:27] them but you know what you guys start
[35:29] with ABC's that's always will be in
[35:31] Christ always would even work if you
[35:34] can't find in the word then you know
[35:36] what there's something seriously wrong
[35:39] with that experience and I'm not talking
[35:41] to that God's Word tells you that all
[35:44] rights the word that's that's going to
[35:45] be placed in front at the white throne
[35:48] judgment God's going places word there
[35:50] and that's going to be ravenous of your
[35:54] life is going to have to line up with
[35:56] this work not my interpretation not
[35:59] control the witness termination not the
[36:01] Baptist like a Pentecostal not the word
[36:04] church of god no it's God's words
[36:07] interpretation that's why we are not the
[36:10] denomination we are not some organized
[36:13] religion we are the interpretation of
[36:15] the word of God we are a continuation of
[36:18] the book of Acts that's who we are on
[36:23] the move bless the name of the Lord
[36:26] there's just so much more that we could
[36:29] say but we need to realize next slide
[36:33] last slide talks about the three comings
[36:41] of Christ there's three times you see
[36:47] how wait a minute no there's only two
[36:48] minutes three the first coming is when
[36:52] he came and restore that he came to be
[36:57] the Redeemer he came to be the savior he
[37:02] came to put the blood between your sin
[37:06] and your position back in glory he made
[37:12] a way that was his first coming to take
[37:16] your place because of
[37:18] because you were born in sin shaped
[37:20] iniquity and then he comes a second time
[37:23] which is now he's in our best and he's
[37:26] redeeming his bride he's come together
[37:29] he's come to get his bride in the
[37:32] rapture and the remember I said we come
[37:37] again after three half years we're
[37:41] coming right back to the server for
[37:43] 1,000 year later it will be a peaceful
[37:46] thousand years and you have not have to
[37:49] worry about time being any kind of a
[37:53] hindrance like it is right now you look
[37:57] at the barrier to see that extra wrinkle
