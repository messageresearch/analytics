[15:52] here the head Deacon here one of the
[15:54] foundation stones of uh this
[15:58] congregation they both worked on this
[16:00] building put everything they had into it
[16:02] it's funny thing I was thinking about a
[16:04] foundation stone this morning you would
[16:07] think that if something is a foundation
[16:09] own and you moved it
[16:11] away that the place would
[16:14] Shake not so not With God all he does is
[16:17] move his foundation stone and make him a
[16:19] foundation stone somewhere else praise
[16:22] the
[16:23] Lord and that's the way it is with the
[16:25] believer what God does for us is awesome

[17:48] blessing to see the numbers being added
[17:50] to the fellowship and as uh brother M
[17:53] says a foundation stone I don't I don't
[17:55] feel that I just feel I was doing what
[17:58] God put in my heart to do and just so
[18:00] much a part of this ministry
[18:02] and you know when God sends you
[18:04] somewhere um the greatest pleasure and
[18:07] I've said this before is that you can be
[18:09] released from your other obligations and
[18:12] I thank this congregation and Pastor
[18:13] Simon for letting us go not questioning
[18:16] and letting us do what God has us to do

[18:34] Jewels uh were just uh blessed to have
[18:38] grandchildren that we can uh reinforce
[18:41] the word of God in their hearts and you

[18:56] puppet named Rebecca and she had Rebecca
