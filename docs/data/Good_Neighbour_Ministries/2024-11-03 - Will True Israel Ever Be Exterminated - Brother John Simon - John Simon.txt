we're going to be uh dedicating Joshua Martin okay um you know uh really a wonderful name uh a strong name a perfect type of the age that we're actually living in because we're under the Joshua commission Amen to take us in and take us up to that Promised Land of the Rapture of the church where we'll have that great meeting in the air it's his leadership and his word that's that's bringing

praise God and so we will go to um uh to the scripture today we're going to um have them come up shortly okay but for right now we're just going to read a scripture we're going to make a few comments and um from slide number three you can see 1st Samuel chapter 1 verse 25-28 and they slew a bulock I want you to notice there they slew a bulock because they were coming under a sacrificial lamb under the blood amen and we bring our children to the Lord and we offer whatever we offer we offer under the blood by accepting and recognizing that Jesus Christ was our absolute propitiation for our sin and so we come to the Lord by the blood of Christ amen that is our relationship that is our uh inheritance and it says here and brought the child to Eli who was the priest and she said oh my Lord as thy soul liveth my Lord I am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the Lord for this child I prayed and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him therefore also I have lent him to the Lord now pay attention here this is what we want to look at as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord amen and he worshiped the Lord there praise God Joseph and Rachel I believe that the Lord has trusted you enough to give you not only Abigail this beautiful little girl amen but also Joshua another wonderful gift and addition to your family the greatest thing that you Joseph Joseph and Rachel have done in your service and in your lives is that you gave yourselves to the Lord you submitted to his word when it came to you amen and there's no greater Victory than that for a mother or a father to have first given themselves totally unto the service of the Lord amen amen you made him Lord over your lives you made him the absolute you made his word your absolute amen recently both of you like Hannah and Elana have endured the anguish of a child under different circumstances but the Lord has heard the Cry of your anguish and has turned it into Joy because of your faith and dedication to the Lord the Lord has blessed you with Abigail and Joshua the memory of your tears and of your sorrow the Lord now intermingles with tears of joy amen your love for the Lord and for one another has produced this beautiful son Joshua prise God I believe the Lord has given you Joshua as a gift as it says in the next scripture in Psalms 127 three low children are inh Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward amen the Lord rewards us with children can you imagine that when he gives you a child he's saying I am rewarding your faith you're now I'm talking about I'm talking about Christians I'm talking about those that have that have given their hearts to the Lord that that believe that the Lord is their savior that believe that the Lord will keep their home will keep their house hallah will bring joy and a blessing into their home because of the gift when you receive a gift from anybody what does it do it brings you Joy amen praise God and parents that love the Lord who can pray and ask the Lord to keep Joshua are parents that have faith to know that the Lord gives and the Lord takes the Lord is Sovereign his ways are perfect amen and this also Joshua is the greatest gift and blessing at this stage in his life this is his greatest blessing his greatest gift to be brought into a home of a family in Joseph and Rachel that love and serve the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise God I want to remind you to keep Jose uh Joshua in the atmosphere of a loving father and mother amen keep them and keep him in a place where they know about God take advantage of the challenging moments to make them teachable moments there's always challenge in children but we need to recognize that the Lord has a teaching that comes when we go back to his word and we apply his word in the training up of our children amen praise God hallelujah we have and and we know that it takes a village to raise a child and it shows here in the in the presence of these Witnesses here um Joseph and Rachel's family that they have uh witnessed and that they have come to say yes we will support the upbringing and the training up of Joshua in the name name of the Lord amen praise God like it says in Ephesians chap 6 verse4 to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord amen I want to ask them to now come and bring Joseph or Joshua to the front let any of the family that would like to surround them please feel free to come amen Joseph and sister Rachel God bless you God bless you Sister for standing as a witness over this tremendous hello Abigail thank you for being a part of this wonderful day amen and Joshua I believe what you're seeing and bringing Joshua here this morning um you're saying that we have Lent him to the Lord and that all the days as long as he lives he shall be lent and given to the Lord they shall train him up they shall lead him they shall guide him they shall create the atmosphere around him of love and the love of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's at this time that I would like to take the child in my arms and dedicate Joshua as we pray let's all bow our heads unto the Lord father what a

reads out of the word of God here 1354 for the Lord has chosen Jacob unto himself and Israel for his peculiar treasure praise the Lord God bless you for the bless the reading of the word please be seated God gave me this particular Topic at this particular time uh because it's right in the season of the word of God and this is Will true Israel ever be exterminated no now we realize that Israel types the church and any attempts naturally of Exterminating Israel speaks spiritually of Satan's attempts to exterminate the True Church of the Living God brother brandham said clearly if you want to know what's happening in the world among the Nations watch Israel naturally spiritually if you want to know what's going on he says watch the women watch the women the way they act the way they dress and the things they do will speak spiritually of what's happening with the Church of the Living God now we know that right now most of the world hates Israel how many knows that oh man how many knows of how many nations that really love Israel no matter of fact it is said that Israel is the fifth most hated nation in the world and especially now Israel is at War we all know that uh they were attacked and they have been responding and it has brought out so much more hatred and vital towards uh the nation of Israel it's all going on right now even uh just uh this morning Iran has vowed to strike at Israel and they said it will be a bone breaking and teeth break teeth breaking attack that will take Place coming from them now we know even from the United Nations uh not saying it out loudly but the call has gone out for the destruction the extermination of Israel now we know exterminate means to erase we know that it means to wipe out it means to eradicate those are just three things you can think about they want to get them completely completely out completely destroyed and off of the scene but this is nothing new for the world has already tried to exterminate Israel for thousands of years years and they have been trying for thousands of years to get rid of these people whoever they think they are they try to get rid of them completely and similarly the church world out there has always been trying to get rid of the true elect seed of God Amen wherever they have caught the true genuine revelation of God for this hour they have tried to wipe them out all the prophets from the beginning of time from Abel right on down we come back into history we see men like hus Luther zwingley uh Hugh Latimer many others that were under the destructive force of Vengeance that come From The Heart Of Satan trying to destroy or to Stamp Out the manifestation living evidences of the Living Word of a living God trying to get it off completely off of the scene but we know the word of our God will stand forever it can never be destroyed it can never be eliminated it cannot happen amen we know that that he has he will tried he has tried he has done with the great inquisitions burning people at the S stake you know of the Pilgrim's Progress you know of John the Revelator boiling him in oil for 24 hours and God protected him in that hot oil for 24 hours until they realized that they could not destroy him no matter how much they boil they could not destroy him praise be to God hallelujah let me tell you brother sister even if they throw you into Lion's Den the devil can't destroy you your flesh you are going to be fearful you may you may feel terrible you may feel horrible but if God wants to keep you and preserve you there's none that can destroy you nothing formed against you can prosper because you are the elected seed of God hallu the children of the most high oh praise God forever more yes sir true Israel and the true church can never be exterminated but as I've said before many attempts have been made to exterminate her let's go back and we see first of all in Pharaoh we see it displayed it's really the same devil it's Satan who was already in Cain and a hatred hatred for the True Believer in so much that he killed his own brother and here we see that Spirit coming down and coming and using Pharaoh as a way to express itself and there it tried again to destroy the nation of Israel this is a type of the world trying to destroy God's people and made them into slaves you know the story you read the book of Exodus if you haven't then read the book of Exodus and you'll see how they he tried to destroy the children of Israel but instead of destroying the children of Israel what happened he destroyed himself he destroyed his Empire he destroyed his kingdom just because he tried to destroy the people of God hallelujah he ended up in the Red Sea praise God hallelujah sin has tried to destroy you cigarettes have tried to destroy you drugs have tried to destroy you all all the things of the world have tried to destroy you but thank God under the Forgiveness of sins by the blood of Jesus Christ we can look back now and see all of our sins tumbling up in the Red Sea of the blood of [Music] Christ amen they're under the blood amen we've been washed and they are under the blood amen God has buried them in the sea of his forgetfulness amen blessed be his name praise God Hallelujah we see it again in the wicked and hateful spiteful Queen called aalia in the Bible you'll find her in 2 Kings 11 you'll find her again in 2 Chronicles 22 you'll find her in also in 2 Chronicles chapter 23 and she actually realized that one king died she remained as Queen but the king's seed his son she was trying with all her attempts to wipe out the king's seed and the devil is still trying to wipe out the king's seed wherever they are he's trying to wipe out the king's seed but you know what in the Bible it says he had a a a wet nurse that was taking care of him and and when she realized what the Queen's intention was she took the boy and hid him right amen she hid him and so what happened is that she did not really realize where he was or if he was there anymore of if he was killed with the rest because she killed out all the rest of the seed that were there so she thought he was also killed just like when Herod tried to kill all those babies thinking he'll get to Jesus you know and Moses you know it's right there in the types but anyway we see it clearly she thought that was over and now she started to line up her son that he might take the throne what she did not know that there was a faithful priest by the name of jeod and he in the temple praying and seeking God we h understand that he organized the people through captains through men of influence and spread out secretly the word that the real king after he had come to an age where he could rule he started to send out the word and gather the people together and told them to come to the temple on a certain day and there on that day he crowned him king and the people began to praise God and shout and glorify God and the queen in our Palace heard the noise and say what is that about and he said well something is going on in the temple let's go see and she came down and the Bible says and she saw the king upon his throne the people surrounding him and the armed guards around him and she screamed to the top of her voice treason treason treason reason oh my but though the people shouted louder Heil to the king amen God saved the king and they began to praise God and the priest said to the armed guards take a hold of her and all that agreed with her yes and take off their heads amen but let it not be in the temple take them outside and get rid of every one of them amen and so they did and that was her end and this will be the end of all those that come against Israel to exterminate her in this hour for they are God's precious seed in this day and this hour will true Israel ever be exterminated yes sir we see it clearly also in the word of God this displayed in the life story of Esther and hymon how many knows the story of Esther yes sir you know about hmon okay certainly we see it how he tried to get to trick the king into destroying Israel but thank God he had an Esther praise the Lord and I'm glad in our day God has an Esther God has a people that are will to say I believe this message I believe this word I recognize the revelation of this last prophet's message and if I perish let me perish but I'm going to see the king I'm going to see the king I'm waiting on a Rapture I'm waiting on a Rapture I'm waiting to see him face to face and tell the story saved by grace amen yes sir Hallelujah and there we know for the Jews the Feast of Purim is coming up that is when my friends they they commemorate the flame that was left in the temple that never went out it never went out and the oil kept burning let me tell you God has given us oil and wine in this day and in this hour and The Book of Revelation says hurt not the wine nor the oil Hallelujah don't hurt the oil don't hurt the wine praise God this is an eternal flame brother sister what we have is an eternal flame something that burns in our hearts something that will take us right into the presence of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir I thank God for that beautiful lady hadasa which is another word for Esther I thank God for her and I thank God for you that out of this wicked age that we are living in that God has called out the people for his name thank you Lord despite all the mockings and the scoffings of the onlookers and the Watchers on and and neighbors and friends and family and no matter how much they put you out of their Consciousness you remain as a living testimony thank you even if you never said one word of witness your life becomes a living testimony amen and just seeing you it it irks them it makes them feel guilty it makes others feel bad they don't want you around let me tell you if they can kill you as much as the devil try to kill Isel he'll get rid of the church but thank God Jesus said but the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the Church of the Living God it means they are going to fight to try to destroy the church but Jesus already let us know yes they're going to fight yes they're going to do everything yes they're going to burn yes they're going to kill yes they're going to boil yes they're going to try to make you bend your knees to false gods but they the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the True Church of the Living God can't Prevail because the word of God says so amen hallelujah we see it portrayed again in Nebuchadnezzar and his grandson Bel shazar and you know how they took uh uh Daniel and them and try to place them in Fire and place them in Alliance d and everything else and then at the last there while they were having the feast they wanted to make a a joke and mock the preacher which is what is going on today oh my friends they want to make a joke of Christianity and who is a real Christian it's fun for them to have great Saturday night life jokes but let me tell you Sunday is coming Rapture is coming our God is coming our King is Coming Jesus is coming and they'll have to answer for everything they said and done in this day and in this hour amen hallelujah yes sir praise God I want you to know my friends that Israel cannot be dist exterminated the true church cannot be exterminated uh forgive me if I get excited forgive me if I get loud because I know you didn't come here for a lecture uh you didn't want uh you know let's talk about butterflies uh is that okay no that should be classic enough for you to listen to uh you know this endangered species of butterfly what you're talking about the butterflies we are the endangered species they want to get rid of us amen we are the ones endanger you think the devil loves you no the devil doesn't love you God loves you and I love you and that's the way it should be amen the devil doesn't like you praise God hallelujah yes sir oh praise God but they can't destroy the church nor Israel because of four basic reasons they may be Hest but I'm just going to mention four one because of God's promise to Abraham and to his fed seed amen amen secondly because of his his calls he calls Israel and the church the apple of his eyes amen his wife is the apple of his eye praise God he calls Israel among all the nations that they are his wife and also he calls them his Covenant people they're the ones that are keeping his Covenant and he holds them true to the word amen so as a result both the bride and Israel has an eternal quality to them and you know I say that and touch on this briefly you not you know that Jehovah's wife was in him in him in his mind right and then later on you know the process of Redemption how that it came down and he displayed how he was going to do it in Adam by putting Adam's wife in him and then when it was the right time he put him to sleep and took his wife from in him and they were of the same material amen same material because one came out of the other and so they were the same material and therefore he displayed in that what he was going to do when Jesus went to the Cross Isaiah 53 when the the Bible says for Jehovah struck him amen Jehovah struck that Masterpiece and out of it fell off a a piece from off the Masterpiece amen oh aren't you glad we are chips off of the old block aren't you happy that we are a part of God amen amen amen and so out from Jesus came his wife represented by the chemical flowing of the blood out of him brother Bram says not that blood not that blood he says that that dried up on goat's Hill long ago but the life was in the blood in the talken book he says don't you know that today the church is the blood of Christ amen that's it for the spirit is in the bride it's in the Church the true church amen and she is the blood of Christ for this hour amen praise the Lord Lord God of hosts amen so we have this eternal quality given to us by God himself because if he was eternal his wife comes from him of the same Pro same quality then she's got to be Eternal is that right amen same one so if he is the word and she came from him she has to be what the word it baffles your mind to think that you are the word made manifest with with all my flaws with all my failures with all how how could I you don't have to worry about that God says you are the word in the beginning was the word in God and the Word was made flesh first come down in Jesus Christ first in MDC and morphe come true and morphe until he becomes flesh manifested and then crucified dead buried cornner weak burst forth and a thousandfold multiplied and here we are now the evidence of the word of God made manifest for this hour praise God hallelujah here we are by his grace hallelujah amen they can't destroy Israel amen yes sir they can't do it I tell you it's so marvelous to know that we are indestructible here in this time and in this hour Hallelujah but you see there these attempts to destroy them came because first of all they broke their Covenant with God Amen you you take the Commandments and you see they break the Covenant with God they bow down to Idols they lie cheat do every possible thing they break their Covenant with God Amen they disobeyed God's prophets when they came with a message they didn't want to listen to them they disobeyed God's prophets and they because of that they descended into what idolatry Thou shalt not worship other gods beside me I'm the only one amen none before me none behind me none beside me nobody else I am the one Elohim the self-existent one the Mighty God made manifest in Jesus Christ amen hallelujah yes sir oh praise God and so because of this idolatry and because of the harlotry of Israel and type we see it in the prophet Hosea read that book and his wife the prophet had his wife and she turned out to live the life of a harlot but it was God showing that even though she did that Hosea still loved her and God showing no matter what Israel does no matter what the church does no matter what the bride does God in God's eyes you're [Applause] Justified doesn't matter who on this Earth loves you they will pass away but the Eternal God loves you from eternity back to Eternity amen thank you Lord when he was Alpha you were in him and now he is Omega we're going back to our position in him him we'll find our place in him for all God's gifts all God's elect will find their appropriate places they'll find where they are and they'll sit down in his house and with him there forever and ever praise God and so God scattered Israel do you know that yes and you know that in I think it's May 177th 1948 they were brought back to their Homeland God brought them back right to their Homeland amen and there they are back but now what is happening these young Lions of God Amen National Force brother brand brother I'm not quoting the quote but he said this National Force God used National Force to bring them back or push them back into their Homeland amen and now what is happening they are trying to use National Force to claim all the rest of it but that's not God's plan you should be asking Jehovah to restore back to you what he promised to the prophet Abraham and let him do the restoration let him do all of that for you praise God but instead right now they're rushing ahead of God using National Force to try to bring about they know it's in the word but they're trying to use National Force to bring about uh the Fulfillment of Prophecy but the unrighteousness of man doesn't work the righteousness of God it doesn't work that way amen so they're now trying to expand their Homeland are you following me here am I hope I'm not going too far you see I'm try trying to get as much in as I can take your time amen yeah I can take my time but then we'll be here until about 4:00 is that right amen and uh never mind the young ones they're supposed to be hungry but a lot of older ones are going to be hungry too and we going to be starting to hear all kinds of voices and it won't be coming from your mouth either oh my amen hallelujah but you see they're trying to use National Force to expand their territory and to F and in so doing they think they'll be fulfilling the will of God now I understand and I'm just going to say it this way because you know in these modern times you have to be careful of what you say and how you say it yes uh you know but when God wants to accomplish something it's being always that way just before Jesus come on the scene all other false Messiahs were coming yeah you had Judas macabus you had tadas you had different ones I won't name them but a lot of them were coming thinking they're the one they're the one they're the one but they were not the one until Jesus came on the scene amen and so when you see the time for Israel to come into her glory is coming the anointing the presence of God to fulfill his word starting to come down on the world the devil acting up on one side the great contest is on the great Holy Spirit versus Satan then what uh begins to happen Men start stepping up thinking they're the ones to deliver Israel I'm the one and so but you see God turns around and uses maybe a man like David he uses men that are like Warriors they don't think about anything else but they are warriors they're made for war and they're made with bloody hands they kill they destroy they do everything because that anointing that was on David rest on them to kill destroy expand grow the Kingdom amen but all that was just so that God would use that David to clear the way so that then after him will come in a man with the spirit of Solomon that can bring a semblance of peace I say semblance of Peace because you know there will be no peace until the Prince of Peace comes until Jesus comes puts his foot on Mount Zion amen and and and declares himself who he really is because you know that uh they have to believe the same seven seal that we receive amen they have to receive it but they'll receive the the the sins will be preached to them by Moses and Elijah and the Seven seal himself will come down on Mount Zion and then they say where did you get those wounds he says in the house of my friends right uh you know just like Joseph was a type of him his own Brothers put him in the pit and so his own Brothers put him on a cross and kill him and everything else in the house of my friends the Bible says they're going to weep they're going to weep for days and days and days amen because now is the time they're entering into the Feast of their atonement yes amen and there could be no real atonement without Christ right they're keeping the he's now in tight with bulls and Rams and doves and goats but when the real one comes on the scene amen then the Bible says they'll recognize it then but for now their eyes are blinded they can't see yes what is their own but at that hour their eyes will be open and they will recognize what it was amen and so we find out that they're trying to use human National Force to bring themselves back to their former glory because you know that Israel once under Solomon they ruled all Lebanon parts of Syria all the way up there they were ruling all those places that were around Jordan and all those countries round about was under the power of of of Solomon amen and David amen yes and they're thinking of their former glory and they're trying to use National Force to reclaim it my friends but you see that's not the way it will be only the power of Jehovah will bring them back to their former glory I was in Israel and I was told by some who were on the battlefield they don't know what it was but in the Yum kipur war that they Egyptians were coming down with all their tanks you know that is were like 150 millions of Arabs against the Jews that were what like two or three million at that time oh my goodness and they were sure they were going to win but when they were coming down across the desert they heard the sounds of a mighty Army bigger than theirs they did not wait to see the army they jumped out of their tanks because the tanks weren't moving fast enough they deserted they left right and Center they were in confusion and they ran away when the Israelites come they wonder what why they running what's happening then later they realize the rabbis begin to tell them no that was Jehovah fighting for his people let me tell you the battle is not yours the battle belong unto the Lord hallelujah no matter what you are going through now and you don't think I'll never be able to come out of this I'll never be able to win this battle this argument this situation that's not for you to worry about place your cares in the hands of Jehovah place your cares in the hands of Jesus for you know that Jesus is Jehovah of the Old Testament is the same Jesus after you one is the spirit the the spirit the other one is the spirit Now put on flesh for God was made flesh in Jesus Christ amen hallelujah made visible Amen in the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah yes sir praise God forever more Hallelujah God promised to do it amen no matter what the other nations do they may bury you Hallelujah they may do everything to you but I will restore said the Lord amen Jeremiah 37 Jeremiah how can these Dry Bones live I'll bring you out of your prisons I'll bring you out of your coffins that you are in I bring you out to the lands you are in from the East the West the north the South wherever you were hallelujah oh praise God he promises can these Dry Bones live sir down knowest he says then I heard the sound as of a mighty Army and the bones begin to rise up every bone fitting right to his bone Hallelujah and here the nation lived again Israel will live again Israel will return to her former glory she cannot be exterminated and let me tell you brother sister we are here sitting down some from the East some from the West some from the north some from the south we come from everywhere around the world Hallelujah they come from the East and West let's sing that song they come from the lands of far to do what feace with the King to d as his how blessed Oh Glory to God beholding face GL like divine bless partakers part of [Music] his oh praise God hallelujah hallu let me share um uh some things here with you brother brandham speaking in the seventh seal he says them learn a parable of Victory when you see the Jew je they'll be hated of all Nations for my name and so forth also again he said paragraph 186 what they won't be done away with they try to kill the Jews off the Earth they'll never be able to do it amen amen that's a prophet speaking they'll never be able to do it praise God God and that comes from the seventh seal paragraph 186 hallelujah oh praise God what an hour now we know brother sister right now why why does the world actually hate Israel is because they can look and see their wrongdoings they can see their wrongdoings in the Bible says bam looked and he could see their sin so plain that he felt that now their sins are showing now I can curse them now I can curse them because the whole world is seeing their sins is seeing their wrongdoings obvious wrong doing so now I can curse them like that and he wanted to curse them brother the quote is the Israel and the church book five 1953 amen but brother Brenham said yes they were sinning just like everybody else were sinning they were doing every vile act like everybody else was doing amen he says but what bam as a prophet didn't recognize is that though they were doing the same things though they were making the same kind of wrongdoings yet at the same time they had a pillar of fire they had a pro Prophet they had a covenant amen they had an ark of the covenant they had a smitten Rock in the wilderness they had a prophet amongst them oh praise God hallelujah brother sister I want you to know so as to the church amen doesn't mean you are free to go out and do what you want that's right but for you to have Blessed Assurance to know that you are Anchored In Christ Hallelujah no matter what mistakes you made Hallelujah you have a prophet you have a pillar of fire you have a covenant you have the blood of Christ you have the Holy Spirit you have his word hallelujah rest upon the word of God rest upon the promise as Israel cannot be destroyed so can the elect the elect can never be destroyed why you're Justified you're Justified Satan lights the fire god es you to light the fire then call call the fire engent and say look him he's the one that light the fire yeah but you're the one that tempted me to light the fire it's not really me I didn't want to do it but the Temptation made me light the fire see so that's why Paul and all these Apostles explained to us we are we we are the supernatural Sons and Daughters of God dwelling in these bodies of Flesh amen that came into existence by Satan yes by procreation not by Spoken Word creation and therefore as such we find out we do a lot of things while we're in this body brother Bram said do you know that sticky nature will be with you right till you go into the Rapture right so don't you say oh I'm going I'm perfect I'm going to be perfect you're trying to get your outward actions perfect and and that's just for other people not God God knows you he knows you that part inside you can't hide that but this outer man you trying to get that perfect for other people to see you but the real believer knows in fact Perfection dwells within it's in the seed that's already in you oh I got to get more love there's love in the seed there's perfection in the seed there is brotherly kindness in the seed there's every virtue that you see in the seed already Hallelujah you may not be manifesting it that's why Paul said work out your salvation with fear and trembling work it out so other people can see it on the outside of you it's in you but let it come out so that people can see you that it's in there praise God so Perfection dwells within praise the Lord hallelujah oh my what a day that we are living in right now praise God hallelujah let me uh fish around here I'm fishing for something here this is not a third P but I'm fishing for some quotations I need to get here praise the name of the Lord uh trying to find what I have here praise the Lord now we know I just mentioned balum and I just mentioned how much he tried to curse Israel and God says you can't curse Israel I already blessed them so how you going to curse what God has blessed God has blessed Israel Hallelujah and I'm telling you brother sister i' been there close to seven or eight times you you can't curse them you may say it with your mouth but the curse no curse can go on them right and God doesn't change his mind about his word so oh my God they're so bad now I'm going to take back my God doesn't change his mind about this word he already got them under Covenant on the promise he got them under as Legal Wife he's got them in every position and it's impossible for anyone to exterminate the nation of Israel amen no Organization no group none whatsoever Hallelujah but you see lot of this is cause if you bear with me say Satan has infiltrated Israel the nation of Israel as much as he has infiltrated the true church and I mean infiltrated amongst those who claim to believe the message yes the devil has infiltrated among those who even claim they have Revelation and he's in the midst and so we find out right in Israel right as in the church we have the True Vine and the false Vine is all right twins as a brother said and we preached some years ago twins in the beginning twins again in the end right so they're in the same church they're in the same Nation but one is true and one is false there's a True Vine and there's a false Vine amen hallelujah but you see that false Vine group don't don't think when you say false vine when you say these things that you're talking about some devil out on the street do you know that Satan was more religious than some of us in here he had a voice like an angel oh man he knows music like a master yes H he was was just so brilliant that he thought my God I got got these people worshiping like this maybe you know maybe I can supplant God and so we find out that this uh spirit of the false Vine is religious it's very very religious right and it's right here in the church and it's in Israel also as the false Vine but thank God they go out and they live a wrong life say wrong things and in Israel they'll do wrong things and what's the purpose to create a false impression of what that people will think that's what the true vine is that's what the Pharisees did they tried to let people think God was a harsh god with no love and God was like that you see but uh that was a false impression and God had to send Jesus the word to let the people see his person and personality made manifest so they can know that God is a god of love and grace and God rich in Mercy and they could recognize him of who he is praise the name of the Lord and so they create false Impressions and uh I've seen people in the church creating false Impressions you'll think that they're real believer and as soon as the hot sunlight comes and shines upon them or the gospel is preached in such a hot cutting way all of a sudden they get bitter I thought the hot sun was supposed to sweeten but all of a sudden when it shines on you you get bitter you get angry you like Cain instead of he gets an offer if you would do like your brother would I not accept you he don't care about that he he wants to almost Force God to accept his worship of flowers and fruits and and human efforts and everything else he his n you see it was from in his nature yes his nature was causing him to act that way against God and against God's word amen but that's the way they are praise God but as the word says in the Book of Revelation as the prophet says not all Israel is real Israel and not all Jews yes are the real Israel amen he even said another place they may be come from Juda and he goes back to explain where that name Jews come from how when Nebuchadnezzar took them into Babylon because most of the Jews that he brought out at that time were from the hills of Judea he called them Jews and then that name stuck to all of them that they were Jews so when they go back to the land then they're all called Jews in Israel say I'm I'm I'm a Israeli I'm of Israel but the prophet said no it's not like that right it's not like that you see the difference anyway praise the Lord so uh we find the that uh that they're not uh true Israel is amongst the Jews in Israel but not the whole thing that we call Israel is really Israel and God knows that and the prophet has said it and the quotes are here that can show it which I will not quote them all actually the brother has them if any of you would like to have a copy of that you can have it where brother brand makes this all clear I'm just hitting some high points not to keep us here all afternoon I don't want anybody to pass out I don't want have to raise the dead like Paul I just want our the devil will distract you by causing somebody to do something and then everybody's attention gone over there and then the word can't go out so let's keep our thoughts on the word okay so many of them today are saying they're Jews but they're Jews only because a rabbi look into their background and give them human evidence yes we now approve of you that you are a Jew and they put their name in the book of the synagogue or the roles of the synagogue same in the true CH in the church church world you pass through our uh catechisms you pass through our converts class you go through our rigorous training of how to be a Christian which in you know a real Christian doesn't have to have training to be a Christian because the seed is in already in him and it will teach him how to be a real Christian is of course he'll be under a pastor Pastor will be outward guidance for him and the real Pastor is above that Pastor and he is shining down the light of the word for the age and for the time and for the Seas praise the Lord so they'll give them a scholarly uh reason why they are a Jew and put their name on a book amen but you see in reality God identifies his own whether there be jew or Gentile God identifies his own and their names of the Tre elect are already in Jehovah's book of redemption from before the foundations of the world hallelujah hallelujah the names are on that book before the foundations of the world and no man can take it off amen God Alone can do that amen hallelujah so Israel types of church repeating myself uh not everybody that says they a Jew is a real Jew not everyone that say they're a real Christian is a real Christian not everyone that say I'm a message believer um that doesn't make you a message believer if you haven't got a revelation of the message you believe some mess but not the message you see so you've got to look and see what God is doing in your life hallelujah amen Revelation says they say they are Jews but they are not and they are they are liars in other words he might as well repeat what Jesus said they are liars like their father the devil and Jesus called the Pharisees you are your father the devil a liar and a murderer from the very beginning hallelujah amen yes sir Hallelujah brother Bram quoting now now because they are Seed of Abraham now watch that is natural what are you typing brother bradam I am typing the church all that confess Christ is not Christians is that true how many knows that have you seen them on television nobody wants to admit they watch television because nobody wants to admit that they watch television well I have seen them on television and they were crying sincerely and the mascara was streaming down oh my God they can use their eyelashes as an umbrella the paint on their face my friends you could paint a wall in your house and they were saying I'm born again right it's sincere but a True Believer looking at them recognizing they don't even know what born again is they don't recognize what it is to be truly Born Again from the inside out because born again is not some choice that you going to make down here I took Jesus as my savior you take him too you take him that's 1950s stuff is that you don't just go and grab this oh this is a nice man over here look at him he's well built I choose him no doesn't work like that doesn't work like that you don't take Jesus as your savior no the prophet said you are to be in his mind from before the found ations of the worldall and now everything is now just going to be confirmed down here and you are not choosing him he chose you it's the father that draw you to the word that's why you are here is that right our saying that we accept him it's just like the bride and the groom taking off her her veil and throwing it on the shoulder saying I accept your choice you chose me and I accept your choice so it's not our choosing so much of him is him choosing us amen you have not chosen me but I chose you and ordain you praise the Lord that is why you in here today amen ordained by the will of God and the promise of God to be in the house of the Lord today praise the Lord shouting and praising his name glory to God hallelujah amen I wish I could young could be young again to jump 5et in the air click my heels and drop back down glory to God hallelujah listen this is real this is this is real brother sister amen something got to hold of me I don't know about you but something got a hold of me I know that the devil tried to hold my mouth and stop me from saying praise God but I don't have no no praise demon going to give me lock jar praise the Lord Lord hallelujah I'm going to give God the glory I'm going to give God praise I'm going to worship Him hallelujah amen praise God forever more hallelujah amen thank God that the true elected is brought out just like Israel was brought out a nation from within a nation yes then out of that nation that he already brought out he brought out two elect out of that so is it a lot of people thought oh we came out and we follow the message for 40 years 30 years 20 years H H I'm an elect no out of that God still pulls out his Chosen Few his elected few are pulled out of that by the grace of God hallelujah amen that's where you are we are right now Hallelujah so we are brought out of what is called the mess age right the the the the Turnal message into a mess and God pull us out of that message Hallelujah and we stand here with our robes clean and white amen washed not by our works but Washed by the blood of Christ Washed by the holy spirit amen glory to God hallelujah amen thank God that we are are the apple of his eye and we can give him praise and all and Glory Hallelujah so all Christians that go to church are not Christians I'm quoting here from Israel and the church he says here Jew not all Jews will be saved they will not be saved see they will not be I believe that you see here because of the tribe of Judah was taken by Nebuchadnezzar he called them Jews first and they were given that name of Jew and now they're called Jew see that's how it was so but but Israel is different and uh and Jew is all together different see there now he is just a Jew Paul never said said all Jews will be saved he said all Israel will be saved amen what Israel's a name that's the Redemptive name of the people see all Israel will be saved not all Judaism will be saved let me just quote that last part not all Judaism will be saved because not all Jews are the true elected Israel of God okay praise God that's in God's chosen place of worship 1965 see not all Israel is Israel not all Christians are Christians because that's the two Vines again the true and the false they're motivated by two different kinds of spirit one has the Holy Spirit and one is Anointed with the spirit of antichrist both claim to know and to be known of God both claiming to speak for God both believe certain basic truths but then they begin to differ on others since both bear the name the Lord being called Christians by the name bearing they claim a relationship to him amen see they claim that relationship God calls that relationship marriage and so because they make that claim god holds them both responsible to him amen and remember you cannot curse what go bless you can't bless what God has already cursed neither can the devil curse what God has blessed I want you to say after me I am blessed I am blessed say it again I am blessed I am blessed say it again one more time I am blessed I am blessed I am blessed I am blessed every day when I wake up I am blessed when I wake up in the morning in the morning when I lay my head to rest I am blessed bless bless amess praise God hallelujah remember this is all an individual Affair Hallelujah praise God you don't hide behind your old Mo your Old Faithful mother's skirt and think you're going to go into heaven that way no sir we one by one we gain the portals there to dwell with the Immortals when they ring those golden bells for you and we one by one we each one must know that the revelation of God has struck your soul and you can see clearly now because the rain is gone is that right oh praise God hallelujah yes sir oh my think of it now it's an individual Affair and I don't care no matter how poor you may be amen I don't care no matter how stupid no matter how how unlearned you may be how uneducated what God has blessed is blessed by God hallelujah praise God let's give the Lord Praise let's praise our god brother Simon I I don't know all those quotations like you do what does it have to do with it he says whether you're uneducated whether you can't read and write like pet uh the so-called first pope couldn't read and write couldn't even spell his name uh that doesn't matter it's the individual salvation knowing that the seed of God dwells in you and the seed of God first John do not commit sin this outside man does all kinds of thing and now we repent of that but this man here Satan can't touch that's why when you come in a presence of God you are Justified you're just as if you never sinned in the first place why because the man in sight never did anything he never did anything is is this man outside of Satan put you inside this prison and have you in it and cause it to act up and do all kinds of things then you have to come back the man inside have to come back and say oh Lord God I'm sorry I Repent thank God I'm so glad you know one thing if you if you commit a crime and they bring you up uh before the judge and the judge says you're guilty you're guilty and I'm going to send you to prison but if inide the man inside never done anything how you going to call him guilty how how can he be condemned he can't be condemned this man here is going to go back to the dust from whence it came and because of its association with the man inside God will give you a new body amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah oh my yes sir God speaking Deuteronomy 32:10 I found him Jacob in the desert lands in the west howling Wilderness he he led him by about he instructed him and he kept him as the apple of his eyes thus said the Lord of hosts after the glory had he said sent me into the Nations which spoiled you for he for he that touched you touched the apple of his eyes he says I sent him among the Nations which spoiled you that don't mean like a mother spoil a child but it means they robbed they destroyed they tried to break them bust them do everything else and God is saying but who toucheth you amen is touching the apple of my eyes amen praise God and they're not supposed to do that by the grace of almighty God hallelujah amen I want to go back to Bam here I'm jumping all around but God bless you today for your patience with me praise the Lord balam thought that a holy God would surely curse the people who had done such wrong surely God will do it you see he was money crazy we're living in a world like that isn't that right we living in that world you see the preachers everywhere money crazy filthy looker is that right there it is in the word of God we know we have our duty according to the word of God paying her tithe giving her offering that's that's different but we're talking preachers actually gone money crazy out there in those churches out there you see and every he tried to curse them he threw out a proph prophecy take up his mantle his Parable and instead of cursing he would find that he was blessing them in other words what was happening to him you know a prophet is a man that is under God's control and the Holy Spirit controls him so he would open his mouth to go curse Israel and the next thing you know out of his own mouth he's hearing himself blessed them you know and and that's what the scripture is trying to tell us you see balum fail to see what the modern preachers and modern people are failing to see in the Holy Ghost Church today amen I know they say I know a lot of them call themselves this that and the other things and I know what they've done I know what he done and what she done the prophet says I'll admit that brother amen they'll blow up with this they done that they' done this that's true they might even done it I admit what have done is wrong but where balam failed to see that there was a Brazen serpent a substitute for them he failed to see there was a smitten Rock going before them Hallelujah he saw those things going there making atonement for them God was calling it was God's election and they were God's people God had called them and separated them and put that serpent as an atonement and the smitten Rock and Baum failed to see that in the this day the modern preacher fails to see the power of the Holy Ghost the smitten Jesus Christ that we have now in this body amen one Spirit we're all baptized into one body members of one body that's what the Modern Man fail to see Hallelujah of the Holy ghost moving before us praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thank God God has chosen Jacob as a peculiar treasure to himself God has chosen you and I as peculiar Treasures unto himself one more uh one more quote to you and then I'm going to wind this all down here you'll find recognizing your D message he says National Force put them back in their Homeland and for National Force will put the nominal church back in the church in the world into that world counil of churches by using National Force but the power of God is going to put the bride into our Rapture praise the Lord hallelujah amen that's recognizing your day and its message and then W I want to leave this with you praise the Lord now in the Book of Revelation we find out that the Jews are gathering they've gathered back into Jerusalem but they don't even know their tribes and the reason why like I told you before Jews and Israelites right the true Israel and everybody calling themselves I'm a Jew uh you know you'll find among the quotes there brother Braham says no I'm not talking about those those those Wall Street greedy whatnot and he describes them Jews I'm not talking about those there are some real ones amongst them and those are elected ones elected by his hands he says and they've come back but now that they're back they've lost their tribal banners then they have lost their books and their books have been destroyed So when you say what what tribe are you from I don't know and that's where these rabbis come in and say well uh from our research from your features from how you look you are of the tribe of so and so and the rabbi tells them that and they accept it but brother B said really they don't know their tribes they don't really know where they're from I don't know one from Benjamin one from here the books have been destroyed through so many wars 2500 years only one thing they know they are Jews so they know they're back in their Homeland amen but they don't know their tribe but God knows Jehovah knows Hallelujah though they have lost their tribal banners and this or that who which is one and whether this is that or not amen they don't know whether they're from Benjamin or from Reuben or isachar or where they're from but but God called them there Revelation 7 12 God will choose 12,000 of each tribe of the elected out of all of it there is 12,000 of each tribe amen that's elected and that's where he will set them back right into order in other words this is there the proof showing that those 12,000 144,000 Jews will be called out of uh out of through Israel will be called out of what is called Judaism or from amongst the Jews and it will be 144,000 of them and right there God will then reveal to them their real tribal identities right which tribe they're really from as such amen see God will do that they're set right in order they're in their tribal order what will be in the tribal order not them regular Jews no but the ones that is elected the 144,000 will be set in order amen oh my we won't go into that that's what exactly also has to happen with the church and that's happen remember the church but with the church God has called our names already and he's telling us who we are and we don't have a number he just says there few there be right few but we know that we are a part of it and I want you to be confident that you're a part of it amen praise God hallelujah amen now he says here going to governmental Affairs right over here what are they doing they're hooking up with the Arabs don't you know God says whoever curses Israel will be cursed I said the prophet now speaking I stand with Israel can you say amen amen amen let me repeat it again I stand with Israel hallelujah praise the Lord listen what he says here every nation that turned against the Jews they s Everyone they paid a price for coming against Israel and then he goes on to talk about Muson and the other ones that tried to come against Israel and everyone sank what am I saying that every one of those people write down through history TR time through scripture that came against Israel they all paid the price all those who come against the true church PID the price and we cannot be exterminated and I close with the thought to recognize again I love this to quote it over and over again we are not creatures of time you don't come from time we came from eternity and we're going back to Eternity is that right do you know that you the person that's living in this body your body had a beginning but the person in there you had no beginning am you will never have an end because you are ET returnal as God is eternal you are part of him now revealed amen God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom being restored is that right God was in Christ Christ in the church praise the Lord and now here we are a manifestation of Jesus Christ the Christ is the mystery of God now being revealed in and through us for his glory and for his own I know I wore you out a little bit there but uh I just needed to get a lot of this stuff out even though it's not in the most pristine order that I would have loved to uh have it in but as long as I throughout enough for you to feed on eat on think on go back to the Bible search the scriptures search the cultes and see what the Lord has for you God bless every one of you so can we all answer the question now can true Israel ever be exterminated no can the true bride of Christ ever be ex terminated no can the devil Prevail against the True Church of the Living God no no we are more than conquerors through him that loved us through Jesus Christ Our Lord God bless you back to Pastor Dan at this time God bless you praise God how
