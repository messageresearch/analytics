right means nothing that's the TR amen and the Lord himself promised that he is the one who going to prepare amen now in Malachi 31 States behold I will send my m messenger and he shall prepare the way before me right so Jesus said he's the way right but he's going to send someone to prepare the way for him for his return amen hallelujah and he does nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophet so what when you want to know what God is doing in the time that you living him look for his prophet he is going to show you the way he is going to tell you what you need to get done amen amen did God send a prophet in this hour yes sure he did I Vindicated prophet and the world has missed him amen but it's only for those predestinated vessels that would Heen and hear the voice of God

breath stop brething you want to see but there is that desire inside Naturally Speaking that you want to breathe continue you want to live anybody on a dead bed or sick or anything they want to live no man wants to die amen hallelujah that's right but this life on this Earth here in this human vessels is not all because after death what next what next what next life here does not end when our

body is destined to die because the day man sin death came amen here is just a testing ground for all of us and it is up to the individual to determine where you want to spend eternity amen that's all the gospel is about the good news that God has given us that we don't have to continue the way in sin God has made a provided way for us to get again to escape it he himself and he said he is no other way but TR amen amen you either be with God for eternity or you will be with the Eternal L completely separated from the presence of the Lord amen amen hallelujah choose this day who you going to
