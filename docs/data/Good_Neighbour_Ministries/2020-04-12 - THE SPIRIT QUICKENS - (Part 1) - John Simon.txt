TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good Sunday morning friends happy Easter to one and all I'm here today to rejoice with you on this glorious resurrection morning may God richly bless one and all my subject for today is the spirit Quinton's the word in particular the spirit of god quickens the word of god for the age in which we live and what i want to show is that god's words written on the pages of our Bibles are dead unless resurrected or quickened by the spirit of a mighty god it is found in the scriptures let me read this for you briefly 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 6 Paul the Apostle speaking they letter kill it but the Spirit gives it life let me repeat they letter kill it but the Spirit gives it life it's Easter time it's resurrection time it's rapture time and I'm happy that I am a believer son of the Living God and I'm here today to show you that the Holy Spirit who is the Spirit of Truth here to quicken the words on the pages of this Bible to us through his marvelous grace to resurrect or to quittin that is why he is here and in particular - he is here to resurrect or quicken God's seed word gene or God's attribute that was deposited in the heart of the believer to resurrect it and raise it up in a certain age a certain season and a certain time this was placed in her life whether you're in a church or around a church if you are a child of God you're one of God's elected seed genes then that gene of God was placed in you from before the foundation of the world you came to this position and you are here listening even by God's supernatural election you are not watching or listening to this by chance but you are watching and listening because the Spirit of Almighty God led you here today I welcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now in the beginning Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 & 2 the Bible clearly tells us in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was with and the Spirit of God moved upon the waters and the earth was without form and void it was without form and void and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters yes the Spirit of God of course water-types the Word of God the spirit of God was moving on the face of the waters and it's that same Holy Spirit that moved on the waters in natural creation when God said let there be light when God said Let there be fishes in the sea it was the Spirit of God that anointed the Word of God and caused it to create whatever God had said by his word for his word cannot return to him boy according to the scriptures so the Spirit of God was there to quicken every word that God has spoken whatever God said and whatever God says the Holy Spirit of the Living God is there to quicken the word of God to our hearts and to the hearts of all believers that will believe wherever they are for God's grace now the Spirit was there to click in the word in the time of natural creation God said let there be light and as I said the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters the Spirit of God and the Giants the words God spoke the Spirit of God empowered the words that God spoke to bring it all to pass by his creative ability now that creation that natural creation of the world that time was not just a creation but it was also a resurrection now if we look at Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 & 2 we'll see in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth . yes . it was done the earth and the heaven was already created now we know God is perfect God is absolute perfection but the next verse says and the earth was without form and void in other words the world or the earth was in chaos the chaotic ages of birth at that time is what is described here in the scriptures now between God creating the heavens and the earth and the earth being without form and void something happened something took place and if you were to read as I did dr. Timbers hurts earliest ages we'll find out friends and we should ask is this the time when dinosaurs walked upon the face of the earth is this the time when Lucifer ruled so that when he was kicked out his jealousy for humankind exists to this very time who was there what kind of beings what kind of inhabitants were there at that particular time before the earth became without form and void now we understand it was God's moving on the natural creation it was the Holy Spirit and is the Holy Spirit who quickens God spoken word God's holy spirit came to a virgin and by his spoken word the Holy Spirit empowered energized and anointed and fertilized that word of God in the womb of Mary and that word of God was made flesh and produced a supernatural birth now by that spoken word you also can believe it in the womb of your heart and that same word of God will produce for you a supernatural birth where you know that you're a child of God you're a daughter of God you're a son of God no matter where you are no matter what your condition got you're hearing God spoken word and if you will receive it into your heart today I assure you your life will be changed and you will come to recognize that you are a child of the king yes it brought for the supernatural birth and that same spirit of God is here to quicken the Word of God to you to my heart to your heart and to bring us to a new birth and new birth not a natural birth where you will be reborn in your mother's womb but it births by the Holy Spirit where you become a new creation by God spoken word born again by the spoken word of God now one natural creation secondly the creation in the womb of Mary by Holy Spirit anointing God's spoken word then we read the ninety-third Li that it was the Holy Spirit when Jesus was crucified on dark Calvary when our Savior bowed his head and died it was the Holy Spirit when they laid him called in the tomb at the tomb and they thought it was over for him forgetting that he had said you can destroy this temple but I'll raise it up again in three days now we see it was the Holy Spirit that went and raised up the body of Jesus quickened him from the dead quickened him and raised him up now during his earthly ministry of course I mean we understand that Jesus recognized that even the Jewish nation need to be resurrected and raised up from traditions and and and all the teachings of the elders they need to be elevated in to a higher realm where they can receive the fullness of God's Word and so is it with Christianity the Holy Spirit wants to raise us all up to another dimension of Revelation understanding and personal perfect realization of the unfailing realities of the Living God that is being given to the earth by a supernatural ministry of the seventh angel no friends that is what happened at the resurrection Jesus the Word made flesh was crucified dead and buried but the Holy Spirit came to that dead word that was in the tomb and raised it up or quicken it by his power his mighty power he raised the word Jesus up from the dead now you I read their Bible before you might have read the various books before various listen to various tapes before but one day God has ordained in his word that the Holy Spirit will quicken the word like you've never heard it before open up the eyes and the ears of your understanding open up the understanding of your heart to recognize your day and the message for your day and to recognize him him Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we understand here in the Word of God that we he was raised up heed the word that was dead and buried was raised up from the tomb raised up from the grave it was God's Spirit and it takes God's Spirit moving across this word of God to bring it to life again the Bible has all the letters written upon it anyone understanding the English language can read it and say oh I believe I'm a Christian go to church do Bible studies to all kinds of seminarians studies theology hermeneutics pedagogy whatever studies they could have done all of that but unless one day God's Holy Spirit moves across the waters of that word and brings that word to life again and create classes the Bible to become a new Bible until it becomes so real to you that you recognize that it's a part of you and you were a part of it whoa listen up day that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled maybe we filled with God's Spirit even now while I speak here today oh this is resurrection time this is Easter time we are here to give glory and honor to God that this one person Jesus Christ who said I am he that liveth and was dead but now I am Alive forever more normally we say a person lived such a long life and then they died and that's it but for him I am he that liveth and was dead but I am Alive for evermore alive from the dead alive from the dead up from the grave he arose risen on this marvelous wonderful resurrection morning whoa what a wonderful mighty God we serve that God's Word that was buried for centuries he is able to raise it up again now let me get to the fourth part that the Word of God that was buried the Apostles dr. us true Paul true Peter true James to all the other apostles Barnabas that were there at that particular time the Apostles doctrine that was lost after 64 AD the troops of God's Word are the truth embodied in the full Word of God was lost it was meant to be crucified dead and buried it suffered entombment under the piercings of Roman god all this the place and happen during the Dark Ages pains of Inquisition chains of persecution turnings of suffering trouble sometimes upon the Church of the Living God at that time and the true face was buried Peter II they say and their friends it seems all what was lost it seems like darkness was everywhere the dirt ages closed in upon the church just as the darkness closed in upon Israel in the time of Egypt but thank God there is a God in heaven and that God had promised by his word enjoy a chapter 2 verses 23 to 26 I will restore seeing the Lord unto you all the years that they conquered and the caterpillar and the farmer worm had eaten away God promised according to his word that he will pour out of his spirit and had he will restore to the church all the doctrines that were eaten away all the joy that was taken out of the church all of the love and brotherly kindness that was eaten out of the church all of the true worship that was in the original church was eaten out of the church until it became a dead litany of so-called worship in the presence of God real worship is like what we saw in heaven when John spoke and said I saw all numberless numbers thousands upon thousands upon ten thousands with their voices like men waters crank under and glory and power and praise hallelujah praise be unto God and again in the scriptures it says where were you when the sons and daughters of God were shouting for joy before the foundation of the world friends look real Christianity is a noisy face it's a noisy face where people raise their hands embrace God where people glorify him and worship Him and it seems sometimes like it's confusion because some crying some are praising summer rejoicing somewhere in the spirit they're laughing why they are happy beyond belief Oh with a joy beyond anything that one can really experience just like by themselves only the Holy Spirit can give you joy unspeakable and full of glory may he give that to you here today maybe rejoice in your living rooms maker rejoice in the presence of God and recognize that the Spirit of God is here to quit them the Word of God now friends that God promised I would restore saith the Lord and just as much as Jesus's body the words Jesus the Word made flesh Jesus was raised up from the dead in three days even so the Word of God that was buried the revelation the truth of the word of God that was dead crucified dead and buried under Roman dogma and entombed within the dark ages of the church but that could only happen for so long because we understand friends that the God said that he would not suffer his Holy One to see corruption you cannot destroy the genuine truth spirit-filled and spirit of minded Church of the Living God he will raise it up again he promised he would restore the church and restore the truth of the word of God and so we understand God began his process of restoration and it began with Luther Martin Luther god bless that saint of god a marvelous and wonderful original Roman Catholic and he received God's Word at that time and after receiving the Word of God he recognized something made clear to him the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith and he used the words alone in other words not my works that men have done not by offerings of the body but by all kinds of works or sufferings that we can place upon ourselves but we are saved by my grace through faith in Jesus Christ that just shall live by faith and God's promise came to pass because he began to raise up his body his body that was entombed his word body that was entombed its resurrection it's wonderful restoration began with the Reformation reforming winning back into this wonderful body all the parts all the pieces all the neck going all the meat bones all the various bones bringing him back and bringing them back to frame their original place and position within that's marvelous wonderful plan that he had claimed before the world began so let me recap he was he the word in his work form not in this flesh body but in his work form was crucified dead and buried under Roman dogma and in tune during the time of the Dark Ages of a time of did not determine national church control right and you see by taking away or rolling back the stone that was seen when a Roman seal upon it that huge stone of doubt unbelief and fear please there by the legions of Rome but all that demons of Hell could not hold the Word of God captain it couldn't not keep him there for as the songwriter sent up from the grave he arose with a mighty triumph or his foes yes he arose the victor from the dark domain he arose what my friends as a victor with his Saints to reign and he reigns the day the sing yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ I am happy to say to you my friends I am one of his believers I am one that believed that he that Jesus Christ was crucified dead and buried and rose again for our justification Oh living he loved me dying he saved me buried it justified rising oh my old glorious day he's raised up to raise me up and take us away in a rapture and faith by the grace of Almighty God hallelujah blessed be his name oh no wonder it is Frank Timms that's yeah he is the mighty Conqueror for he retina failing to Satan could not conquer him the Bible tells us that while his dead body lay in the tomb he went down his solace went down into the pits of Hell and there he took captivity captive in a way to dramatize that he went down into hell and grabbed the keys of death in Hell from Satan and open those cell doors oh and live out those saints of God that were held captive between the old and the new testament what a blood was not yet shed but their believes unto eternal life but now the blood is shed already so we can be completely saved immediately but back then that word those people that believed it was counted on to them righteousness for this scene must face my revelation of this great Messiah this great deliverer of this great Conqueror that was to come and they put their faith in him so much that job said I know that my Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand upon the earth in the latter days job literally saw from way back where he was the coming of Christ right to his second coming and the coming of the Lord with his Saints like in the book of Jude and he said the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints blessed be his holy his righteous and precious name we see clearly friends that God then began to use he used let me say these words he used Martin Luther to nail his articles of protest on the door of Wittenberg castle protesting what he was taught before recognizing that it's not by the works of men or any such dumbness Creed's or whatever but he clearly said that just shall live by faith and that was the rebirth or the resurrection of genuine apostolic doctrine and Christianity upon the face of the earth but then we understand the Lutheran's began to say well the just shall live by faith and a son began to drink and smoke in party and carry on because as long as they believed they felt it was all right like some people as long as they're in the church as long as they're reading their Bibles doing Bible studies they think it's all right but God said also for the second day or you use the word in three days I'll raise it up again we understand that also means another age right another age so we understand that Wesley came in that next day or the second day recognizing that we must not only be justified by faith and then take our Liberty and go out and live anyway dress anyway speak anyway associate with any appearance of evil or or whatever and yet it will be all right with God so God sent Wesley and Wesley caught the revelation that not only must we be justified but we have to live holy lives we have to be sanctified by the grace of God second step in the process of the resurrection of apostolic doctrine from out of the graves of the dark angels out of the improvement within the dark ages out other away of that stone of doubt unbelief and fear that was placed there and sealed with a Roman seal we understand the seals were broken off of the Word of God by these two men at that time and it released me the word that was buried it raised it up into the view and the eyes of the elected of God for that particular day and God used him wonderfully well then you can read up the life of John Wesley how God used them but then after after the Lutheran's after the madness after justification came sanctification after sanctification came the Pentecostal revival with the baptism of the Holy Spirit God anointed a man in our day of twentieth century prophet by the name of William Marion grant him who came on the scripture of command came on the Holy Orders of Malachi 4:5 I spew all died single - in line to the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children off back to the father's turn the hearts of the modern-day children of the fake back to the face of the taluk fathers amen amen hallelujah thank you Jesus take your Lord I'm happy here today I'm rejoicing neither day as I walk into this wonderful way of the Lord Jesus Christ God sent him to bring Ababwa full restoration the full restoration amen for he said I will raise him back up in three days and so true three ages of church history after being entombed God sent this marvelous wonderful seven h7 messenger of the Church of the Living God to raise up his word for the hour hallelujah and to restore back walk not himself but to restore back the Word of God that was crucified dead and buried and to bring it back to the attention of the elected see the truth Church true Church of the Living God to restore to us the truths that were lost I'll give you an instance as for instance there is only one God there is only one Lord one faith one baptism one mediator between God and man one name by which we ought to be saved and that name is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ god help us that was restored powerfully under the great Ministry of William Marian bring him God's servant amen in this wonderful last name also to restore back to us Z this recognition that original baptism written right in the Bible is in is supposed to be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now remember Jesus had already told Peter how that you should go to all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost and now we understand the modern church uses that as if to say that is the name of which people have to be baptized now just pure English I will not take much time with this but your English will tell you Father is not a name son it's not a name Holy Ghost is not a name I'm a father I'm a son and I'm a human but that is not not my name but Peter and the Apostles had caught the revelation what he was saying so on the day of Pentecost when they asked him men and brethren what shall we do he to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins baptize in what name in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and furthermore he says for there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ our Lord I tell you Peter did not make a mistake Amen you don't have to make a choice whether to believe Jesus or to believe Peter because it's one and the same thing it's only the revelation of the word it's only the Spirit quickening the Word of God on your heart and may he quickened the Word of God to you here today in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to recognize who you are what you're hearing and may the Spirit of God speak it right into your soul Oh believing child of God you may not fully even understand but something in your heart is telling you that's the truth that's the Word of God I accept it in the name of Jesus Christ another thing he restored back to us is that there was no denominationalism from the apostolate doctrine there was only one church denominations that we have over 3000 or more of them they are all they're all man-made efforts man-made efforts my brothers and sisters to conserve the truth and to interpret the truth and also to defend what they think is the truth and thereby they put gone aside not recognizing that God is a defender of his own face and that God is his own interpreter he will make it plain yes God anoints his word and he makes it plain as he is making it plain for you named by his marvelous and wonderful grace God restores his own word God is his own interpreter of his own word so don't be deceived but only believes the Spirit of Almighty God what he's speaking and sing right into your heart here today Oh may he quickened the Word of God to your heart or believe in child of God may he quicken that word upon the altar of your heart and sit in a fire set your soul fire by his marvelous and wonderful grace amen even if that word of God that you heard since you were a child even that word of God that you might have learned since you were in the church if that word of God that when you were in the message seems to have died out within your heart and within your soul may the Holy Spirit of Almighty God today quicken that word quickly the embers of the word of God may the bright winds of the Holy Spirit fan the flames of the embers of the Word of God that is within your heart and may they come up blaze again with zeal with joy with hope with faith and with a testimony that I am born again I am freed from sin I've been washed in the blood or I believe the word of God and I receive it here today in the name of Jesus Christ within my heart within my life within my home and I'm a changed person well that one song writers say when the call of fire touch the Prophet making him as pure Rasputia me
