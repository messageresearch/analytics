[32:48] [Applause]
[33:01] are you happy you redeemed
[33:04] Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb thanks
[33:08] be unto God to God be the glory amen God
[33:12] bless you please be seated just for a
[33:14] moment
[33:15] we thank God we we heard from Sister
[33:18] Merlin from New Zealand she is pressing
[33:22] on praise the name of the Lord 90 is it
[33:25] amen 90 and pressing on to the glory of
[33:29] God how much more should it be for us
[33:33] that we would keep pressing on the
[33:36] battle until the Lord calls us home but
[33:39] that great saint of God is there believe
[33:42] in the word with all our heart thank God
[33:45] for all the years that she's been coming
[33:47] and coming until now it's become hard
[33:51] for her to to travel but God is still
[33:55] God and he is able amen we're glad to
[33:58] see every one of you here today in the
[34:01] house of the Lord and to come in the
[34:05] spirit of Christ to engage ourselves
[34:08] together because Fellowship is a very
[34:12] difficult thing in this day a lot of
[34:16] selfishness and a lot of um you know
[34:21] we we all take care of our own Affairs
[34:24] and you just don't think about it but
[34:26] we're no more in real Fellowship right
[34:29] but the Holy Spirit wants to be in
[34:32] fellowshipped right praise God not only
[34:35] when I'm preaching the word and you come
[34:37] here
[34:39] to come in an assembly which we call
[34:41] coming to church but that we would be in
[34:45] Fellowship one with the other as
[34:47] Brothers and Sisters in Christ as the
[34:50] law of the word and as time allows and
[34:54] as we make time and deliberately have to
[34:57] do it because Satan tries to obstruct
[35:00] that as much as he can and discourage it
[35:03] as much as he can but God wants us to be
[35:07] in Fellowship
[35:09] because Fellowship breeds a lot of
[35:11] things in us and in our hearts very
[35:14] important element for the Christian life
[35:17] it's so good to be in God's house today
[35:20] and to be with you and to share God's
[35:24] holy word well today by his grace we'd
[35:29] like to start a topic here
[35:32] um I don't believe it will end today but
[35:35] we'll follow follow it up and we'll see
[35:38] what God will tell us at this time
[35:41] because the ministry uh while brother
[35:45] Branham was here praise the Lord was
[35:49] really to do what gather the bride
[35:52] together
[35:53] from out of all the lands all the
[35:56] nations all the people tribes and towns
[35:59] that were everywhere around the world to
[36:03] preach the gospel and to attract the
[36:06] bride's attention that her attention
[36:09] might look towards him the word to look
[36:12] away from the world and the things of
[36:15] the world and to begin to see Jesus Amen
[36:19] in his fullness we had a demon
[36:22] denominational perspective of Jesus
[36:25] Christ but then the prophet came with a
[36:28] magnification that widened our view we
[36:31] were able to recognize him that he's not
[36:34] dead but look he's operating through an
[36:37] endless Man He's Alive forevermore he's
[36:41] just the same as he was back then he's
[36:44] here today again and he's proving that
[36:47] he is alive and he's moving amongst his
[36:50] people in a wonderful way and that
[36:54] attraction
[36:56] upon to attract us to the top of the
[36:58] pyramid to attack practice to the
[37:00] Mountaintop of God's word caught the
[37:04] attention of the genuine bride that
[37:07] caught everybody's attention for that
[37:10] matter right and when it caught
[37:13] everybody's attention under the first
[37:16] and the second pull amen caught
[37:20] everybody's attention then when
[37:23] everyone's attention was caught then he
[37:26] began to preach the word
[37:29] and when he began to preach the word it
[37:33] wasn't instantly recognized but slowly
[37:36] it started to create a difference
[37:39] it started to create a separation
[37:42] God was taking the grain from amongst
[37:46] the tears or the tears from Amongst the
[37:48] Wheat by the preaching of the word at
[37:53] one level that word brought us out amen
[37:56] the prophet's message brought us out to
[37:58] denomination now we see the fivefold
[38:02] ministry with his ministry began to the
[38:06] angels began to separate the shaft from
[38:09] the wheat and some could only separate
[38:13] it to a certain level amen praise God
[38:16] but then the holy spirit in these last
[38:19] days has been honing in and focusing his
[38:23] attention in getting that bride ready
[38:27] that she might go into the presence of
[38:30] the Lord and the word the ministry for
[38:33] this hour is bringing her to a place
[38:37] where she must and will be without spot
[38:41] or without ring go because he the Holy
[38:45] Spirit the Living God is washing her by
[38:49] the water of his living word amen that
[38:52] she might be ready to go with him I'm
[38:55] preaching already let's go to the
[38:57] scripture let's read the scriptures and
[39:00] let's go to the word of God here praise
[39:02] the name of the Lord shall we all stand
[39:08] Matthew 16 17-18
[39:15] and Jesus this is when he says who do
[39:19] men say that I am praise the Lord after
[39:24] he's doing all these Miracles who do men
[39:27] see I am and uh Simon Peter answered him
[39:30] and Jesus said unto him blessed art thou
[39:34] Simon barjuna for flesh and blood has
[39:39] not revealed this
[39:42] education didn't philosophies no nothing
[39:46] did it but Flesh and Blood nothing in
[39:50] Flesh and Blood give this to you Simon
[39:53] Peter but by my My Father which is in
[39:57] heaven
[39:59] and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and
[40:03] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[40:07] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[40:10] Hallelujah therefore first Peter 2

[43:30] to melchized Abraham in the form of a
[43:36] man the word began to take the shape of
[43:40] the form of a man

[43:46] Spirit of almighty God is again taken
[43:51] shape by the unveiling of the word in

[44:04] back there with Abraham that same the

[46:46] the physical form amen not like when he
[46:51] comes and takes the bride out of here
[46:53] but the recognizing him in his theophany
[46:58] form of the word that's now revealing
[47:02] itself
[47:03] amen and that's why if you can't
[47:06] recognize him now you won't be able to
[47:09] recognize him then amen you've got to

[47:16] and now that is what we are feeding on
[47:21] you come to church you come together
[47:24] because we want to feed on this unseen
[47:28] Force we want to feed on this living
[47:31] presence this being that engulfs our
[47:35] entire body our entire mind our entire
[47:39] existence engulfed by this living person
[47:42] who the Bible says in Revelation 1 when
[47:46] we begin to talk of him he steps right
[47:49] out of the bushes when we begin to talk
[47:52] of him the Bible says he's walking up
[47:55] and down among the candlesticks do you
[47:58] believe he's right here with us
[48:01] oh my do you believe he's walking up in
[48:04] them desires
[48:05] don't you believe he can touch you
[48:08] wherever you are
[48:09] you believe I have to come off with the
[48:12] puppet to lay hands on you no he is
[48:15] right here the great physician now is
[48:18] near the sympathizing Christ amen he is
[48:22] able to do the same he did yesterday
[48:25] he's able to do it today off only you
[48:28] will believe
[48:30] he'll break and Empower that tries to
[48:32] hold you he'll break every chain that
[48:35] tries to hold you he'll set you free
[48:38] from anything that tries to obstruct
[48:40] your path because he said he'll have a
[48:43] bride and the devil will do everything
[48:45] to Prevail against that but the Bible
[48:48] says he shall not Prevail because the
[48:51] word the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[48:54] already prevailed over him glory be to
[48:58] God hallelujah amen yes sir so we take
[49:02] God that while we are in a state now
[49:05] that we are literally expecting a body
[49:08] change
[49:10] just as Abraham and Sarah had a body
[49:14] change after meeting that theophany that
[49:18] change started amen from the day you
[49:22] come into a clear revelation of this
[49:26] word your change started
[49:29] amen I don't mean that your physical
[49:32] body May necessarily change but your
[49:36] soul on the inside began to change Paul
[49:40] talks about the renewing of the man on
[49:42] the inside you you become a new creation
[49:45] you're Changed by the power and the
[49:48] presence of almighty God you are no more
[49:51] your own you know you're bought with a
[49:53] price you're brought to him and you
[49:55] recognize him for who he is amen blessed
[49:59] be the name of the Lord amen I don't
[50:01] know about you but I already feel that
[50:05] Resurrection let me say rapturing power
[50:08] working within my being Hallelujah I
[50:12] feel the electrifying power and presence
[50:14] of almighty God hallelujah working
[50:17] through this word to bring glory to his
[50:20] mighty name amen hallelujah amen glory
[50:24] to God Amen you see the the thought let
[50:28] me give you this seat thought first so
[50:30] that you'll know what I'm talking about
[50:32] for the rest of the way
[50:34] is that um Peter he says and Upon This
[50:40] Rock I'll build my church and the Gates
[50:44] of Hell shall not Prevail praise the
[50:47] Lord and what He is wanting us to know
[50:50] is that as you know Peter's name
[50:53] actually means Stone
[50:55] it means Little Rock but remember I just
[50:59] read from the first Peter how this is
[51:02] made us clear I am the original chosen
[51:07] rock it says that and you are just
[51:11] little rocks amen little rocks in other
[51:15] words you're a chip off of the old rock
[51:18] you you're just a piece of him piece of
[51:22] that Pillar of Fire got uh inside of you
[51:26] by the opening of the word remember we
[51:30] come from him if we are true Sons and
[51:33] Daughters of God Amen then we had no
[51:37] beginning we had no end there's no time
[51:40] when you were not
[51:42] and there will be no time where you will
[51:45] not be
[51:47] for you being a part of God is Not Just
[51:51] to be another human you are human
[51:54] because you have to be on the earth and
[51:56] people have to see you you have to have
[51:58] location visibility knowledge self
[52:00] knowledge stuff like that now it's not
[52:03] just to be here but for you to recognize
[52:06] who you really are
[52:08] amen that you are the original
[52:12] ETS
[52:15] I I know that sounds funny I'm not
[52:19] trying to be funny but it is I'm just
[52:21] getting you to understand what it is
[52:23] they're looking for alien beings coming
[52:26] down from flying saucers amen and and
[52:29] they don't understand that Paul said we
[52:32] are not from here
[52:35] we are Eternal beings Tractive brother
[52:38] Brown said but you're only trapped for a
[52:40] season in a body of time
[52:43] your body only have 70 years or whatever
[52:46] on the Earth but the being that's in
[52:48] there is a Timeless being
[52:51] amen you come from God and you're going
[52:54] back to God that's why when The Sinner
[52:56] dies he don't know where he's going but
[52:59] we know who we come from we know where
[53:02] we come from we know why we are here we
[53:06] know what purpose we are for we are here
[53:08] to serve his purpose we come from him
[53:11] and we go back to him by faith in this
[53:14] word of God absent from the body you're
[53:17] present with the Lord amen because
[53:20] that's where you come from Hallelujah so
[53:23] we come here in his wonderful presence
[53:27] to fulfill his purpose for his glory so
[53:31] when I say that you are Lively stones
[53:36] he's really talking about the unshakable
[53:39] gene that is in you
[53:43] you are little stones
[53:45] you are little rocks
[53:48] off of the great Rock of Ages
[53:51] and as that that part that is in you
[53:55] there is unshakable Unsinkable
[53:58] indestructible it can't be changed it
[54:01] was set here by God
[54:03] and that is what he said to Peter
[54:05] because Peter was the first one that
[54:08] kind of had some recognition and he says
[54:11] Thou Art Peter you got the rock in you
[54:14] you got the stone in you you got the
[54:17] seed you got the gene you got the sword
[54:19] you got the attribute it's in you you
[54:22] recognize that you're different amen you
[54:25] recognize that you are different from
[54:28] the day you're born you're recognized
[54:30] why am I like this something was in your
[54:33] speaking to your soul and you're
[54:35] recognized you are not just ordinary you
[54:38] are Sons and Daughters of the Living God

[54:43] see I'm a Child of God I'm a Child of
[54:47] God

[54:52] are the trials of children of God I wash
[54:56] my robes in the Crimson Fountain I am a
[55:00] child of God hallelujah we wash the
[55:03] robes in the word of God and here we are
[55:07] as Sons and Daughters of God expressed
[55:10] visibly and physically upon the face of
[55:13] the Earth for a season of time until we
[55:15] are called back into his presence praise
[55:18] the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so
[55:21] thank God that God did uh represent or
[55:26] manifest himself to Abraham while he was
[55:30] not yet in solid flesh you understand
[55:33] and we are in court in the same time
[55:37] frame as uh as the elect lady or
[55:42] Abraham's Royal seed
[55:44] before he goes from being in this word
[55:49] form to go back to the fullness of his
[55:52] flesh form to come and pick her up and
[55:57] take her away we are allowed to
[56:00] recognize him by the word of God being
[56:03] preached to you amen hallelujah that's
[56:06] why you pray for me and I pray for you
[56:09] because what's manifesting here today is
[56:12] not John Simon alone standing over the
[56:15] spoken oh there's a power from the
[56:19] presence of almighty God there's a
[56:21] presence that no man can have of himself
[56:24] is the god of Heaven by the revealing of
[56:27] this word making themselves known amen
[56:30] is there where you see any signs and
[56:31] wonders and miracles we don't have to
[56:33] have that to have him here we have him
[56:36] here because he has the word and he is
[56:39] making himself known he has let you
[56:42] become conscious of his presence
[56:44] conscious that he is alive not dead but
[56:47] living among praise the name of the Lord
[56:50] God hallelujah thanks be to God yes sir
[56:53] so now he uh Abraham saw him back then
[56:57] now he's allowing the elect lady the
[57:01] bride to see him now
[57:05] in the form of his theophany which is a
[57:10] word body that has not yet gone back to
[57:13] being a flesh body amen praise the name
[57:17] of the Lord glory to God hallelujah now
[57:21] we are aware
[57:23] that uh let me give you a quotation
[57:26] first of all because some of you may not
[57:28] think I'm preaching the message if I
[57:30] don't quote from Brother Branham but
[57:33] they don't understand that the same
[57:35] inspiration that hit brother Branham he
[57:37] released it and it went out and he
[57:40] prophesied and said it will come on some
[57:43] of those young men I was a young man at
[57:45] the time when he was saying that
[57:47] it'll come on some of those young men
[57:49] and they'll take this word and they will
[57:54] break it down
[57:56] not because they know anything but at
[57:59] that time by inspiration of the Holy
[58:03] Spirit they will break it down so that
[58:06] you will understand hallelujah praise
[58:09] the name of the Lord and I believe
[58:10] that's what's happening
[58:12] listen
[58:14] but today
[58:16] it's members
[58:19] it's getting decisions
[58:21] it's bringing members into the church
[58:24] many members amen that's not it oh my
[58:31] yes sir I tell you I want to talk from
[58:35] my heart it's the truth all they look
[58:38] for is decisions join this church join
[58:43] that church join that other Church join
[58:45] this church and come join us over here
[58:48] join this over there all of them every
[58:52] one of them they are just thinking
[58:54] member members members members members
[58:59] I'm repeating what he's saying here
[59:00] decisions decisions decisions amen see
[59:05] that's what they're thinking hallelujah
[59:08] what I'm saying here is that when he
[59:11] came again now
[59:13] in word form not in this form that of
[59:18] just reading the Bible that they were
[59:21] looking for because they're expecting it
[59:24] as the written word form but now he's
[59:27] come back in this form of the uh
[59:31] theophany which is the same word but in
[59:34] a spirit form a spiritual form before it
[59:39] and morphs to the fullness of its state
[59:44] praise the Lord hallelujah and when he
[59:47] came in that form some even called him a
[59:50] devil
[59:51] oh my some doubted him
[59:56] some reject him my fact that
[59:58] Pentecostals rejected him they didn't
[1:00:01] want him they prefer his gifts
[1:00:04] but that didn't want him the word
[1:00:08] uh you know you have a lot of women like
[1:00:11] that in the world today type of the
[1:00:13] church
[1:00:14] they want all the offerings all the
[1:00:16] tidings all this they want all the gifts
[1:00:19] you know but they don't want him the
[1:00:23] word
[1:00:24] they just want him to have money bring
[1:00:28] money get money give them money or
[1:00:31] receive monies or whatever but they
[1:00:35] don't want the fullness of the word
[1:00:38] amen but he's calling us back to his
[1:00:41] original intention that you will love
[1:00:44] him and then everything else is made
[1:00:47] available to you
[1:00:49] praise the Lord hallelujah amen I'm not
[1:00:53] one for this modern calculation of uh
[1:00:56] women saying they're in love but they're
[1:00:58] only in love after they calculated that
[1:01:00] man he's going to do well he's going to
[1:01:03] have this job he's going to make lots of
[1:01:05] money he's going to become rich and
[1:01:06] therefore I'm going to be well off and
[1:01:09] then they fall in love
[1:01:11] right but not the real genuine love when
[1:01:14] a woman looks at a man I don't care what
[1:01:17] condition he's in I don't care how poor
[1:01:20] he is I don't care what he have with
[1:01:22] God's help amen but God's help
[1:01:25] we can I can't help him he can help me
[1:01:28] we can do it to the glory of God Amen
[1:01:32] real genuine God sent love amen but not
[1:01:36] this the last day uh love so-called
[1:01:40] calculating and scheming and everything
[1:01:43] else praise God if you want to see that
[1:01:46] go on the television you'll see a lot of
[1:01:47] that
[1:01:49] right all right like that amen oh my
[1:01:53] praise God but brother sister we are not
[1:01:56] here looking for members we are here
[1:01:59] looking for the character of Jesus
[1:02:01] Christ
[1:02:03] Hallelujah we are here looking for the
[1:02:07] little Stone inside of that person some
[1:02:11] a typos inside the person that's what
[1:02:15] we're looking for something that will
[1:02:17] hold them no matter how hard I preach
[1:02:20] the word or any other man preaches the
[1:02:23] word they'll hold to God's unchanging
[1:02:25] hand they'll hold to the promise of God
[1:02:28] for the hour they'll hold to his word
[1:02:31] because they got nothing else to hold to
[1:02:33] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:36] Christ amen hallelujah amen glory to God
[1:02:40] we're searching now and what we're
[1:02:42] searching for is to find them last
[1:02:44] members of the Bride
[1:02:46] wherever they are we're looking for them
[1:02:50] listen in any case what good is Stones
[1:02:55] you gather them if you've got a Stones
[1:02:59] you haven't even got a stone Nation to
[1:03:02] shut them out amen got them Stones
[1:03:06] having coming with confessions right see
[1:03:10] but you see when Peter made his
[1:03:13] confession Jesus said Thou Art Peter
[1:03:17] meaning brother Braham speaking a little
[1:03:19] Stone see but what good even is that
[1:03:24] stone if there isn't a stone mess and
[1:03:27] there to shape it into a son or daughter
[1:03:31] of God then all you got in there is but
[1:03:34] a pile of a bunch of rocks
[1:03:37] what is saying is if that person even if
[1:03:42] they're genuine seed and recognizing
[1:03:45] it's the seed of God it still needs a
[1:03:49] stone Mason which is one of the fivefold
[1:03:52] ministry or a minister a real genuine
[1:03:55] man of God to take a sharp tool and to
[1:03:59] begin to ship that uh personality that
[1:04:02] character that's in there undeveloped
[1:04:06] like a newborn
[1:04:08] and to developed by the preaching of the
[1:04:11] word
[1:04:13] and as it feeds on that word it grows in
[1:04:17] the word
[1:04:18] its character and its personality begins
[1:04:22] to emerge by the word that they have
[1:04:24] been receiving
[1:04:26] Hallelujah that's why he said well if
[1:04:28] you've been feeding on the soup made
[1:04:30] from the shadow of a skinny chicken
[1:04:35] you're going to be anemic
[1:04:37] you want to come to accomplish nothing
[1:04:40] whatsoever but you've got to come to
[1:04:42] receive the real preaching from the body
[1:04:46] word of Jesus Christ who is the same
[1:04:49] yesterday today and forever Hallelujah
[1:04:53] so their desire to display gifts
[1:04:56] uh they didn't want to receive this word
[1:04:59] because the gifts is like you know
[1:05:02] something we can hold on to but the word
[1:05:05] what is this word what is this
[1:05:07] Revelation
[1:05:08] you can't hold it you can't there's
[1:05:11] nothing for you to hold on to you just
[1:05:13] got to believe it and receive it within
[1:05:16] your heart but they want to come and
[1:05:19] every night or every day they come to
[1:05:21] church oh there's a miracle there's a
[1:05:23] healing oh somebody shocked somebody
[1:05:25] shouted somebody over there we're gonna
[1:05:28] shout too we're gonna praise God too
[1:05:30] we're going to give God glory but it's
[1:05:32] what you're shouting about
[1:05:34] well said when your worship when you
[1:05:37] sing when you pray or you preach he said
[1:05:40] preach pray with the understanding
[1:05:42] amen don't be like some something brass
[1:05:45] and a tickling symbol you don't even
[1:05:48] know what you're shouting about amen but
[1:05:51] when the word of God strikes your heart
[1:05:53] and you recognize the fullness of the
[1:05:55] word and you say hallelujah that's not
[1:05:59] something on the tip of your lips but
[1:06:01] something coming from the depth of your
[1:06:03] soul because you recognize what is
[1:06:06] really going on
[1:06:09] Peter thou art a little Stone but what
[1:06:13] good is even that stone
[1:06:16] if there isn't a stone Mason there to
[1:06:19] ship it into a son a daughter of God
[1:06:23] it's just a piling of a bunch of rocks
[1:06:26] piled together amen oh praise God in
[1:06:30] that wonderful to know that brother
[1:06:32] sisters that is why uh
[1:06:35] God love me to see the importance of
[1:06:39] every true genuine God called god Set
[1:06:44] Apart minister of this message
[1:06:48] I don't say every minister of this
[1:06:51] message
[1:06:51] but I'm telling you God is going to let
[1:06:55] people begin to see that there are
[1:06:59] ministers and there are ministers and
[1:07:02] you'll recognize a great difference
[1:07:04] not because the man says so
[1:07:08] not the man tries to make himself
[1:07:10] something but the spirit of Christ will
[1:07:13] separate them you'll recognize there's a
[1:07:16] difference there that is you can't
[1:07:18] explain it but there is a difference
[1:07:21] there that God does it by his word
[1:07:23] praise the name of the Living God
[1:07:25] hallelujah amen what good is them Stones
[1:07:29] if you haven't got a true Stone Mason

[1:07:36] and fit him into the place into the
[1:07:39] house of God that don't mean just a
[1:07:42] local church but he's talking about when
[1:07:45] Solomon built his original Temple the
[1:07:48] stones the Bible says some were given
[1:07:51] gifts the shape Stones Some to jewelry
[1:07:54] some for curtains tailoring just that
[1:07:57] and and they were used to shape the
[1:08:00] stones and in the shaping of the storms
[1:08:03] for Solomon's Temple not the sound of a
[1:08:05] hammer was not heard the sound of the
[1:08:09] fool or Nothing Was Heard and yet the
[1:08:12] ship that Temple by the power of God
[1:08:15] hallelujah let me tell you I went to

[1:08:21] long as three quarter of this inside of
[1:08:23] this church

[1:08:28] about five feet thick one piece
[1:08:32] they're still wondering how they move
[1:08:34] them
[1:08:35] how they got them there and they know
[1:08:38] that the stones is not from the original
[1:08:41] limestones that were right there in
[1:08:43] Israel where did they bring them from oh

[1:09:49] would never have known you
[1:09:51] you would never meet this person you
[1:09:54] would never meet the other person on so
[1:09:56] many levels on because of certain levels
[1:09:59] in society we all could live a full life
[1:10:02] but yet we're passing each other
[1:10:05] because we're living on different planes
[1:10:08] of society
[1:10:09] and then when you think of mental
[1:10:11] abilities that's another level we might
[1:10:14] never have met when you think of the
[1:10:16] racial level black white yellow brown
[1:10:19] whatever we might never have met it's
[1:10:23] only the grace of God and the revealing
[1:10:25] of this word brother

[1:10:38] honor amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:10:41] amen these Pentecostals
[1:10:45] instead of them recognizing Melchizedek
[1:10:48] the word they prefer to be caught up
[1:10:52] with The Spoils of the five Kings
[1:10:54] counting the five Kings and all the
[1:10:57] money all the jewelry they brought back
[1:10:59] from capturing the five Kings all of it
[1:11:02] was to go to Abraham and Abraham turned
[1:11:05] around and said no I don't want to just
[1:11:08] take enough to give my servants and
[1:11:10] stuff he gave it to the kings of Sodom
[1:11:13] you you all can take it and attempt to
[1:11:15] that he turned around and say this goes
[1:11:18] to Melchizedek
[1:11:19] amen praise God hallelujah and we see

[1:11:25] same thing in this day and in this hour
[1:11:28] amen glory to God hallelujah praise God
[1:11:32] I'm I'm preaching but I'm also watching
[1:11:35] the time praise the Lord glory to God
[1:11:37] I'm also sensing your spirit
[1:11:40] when you get tired of me I'll know it
[1:11:42] too
[1:11:43] amen amen praise the Lord amen praise
[1:11:48] God forevermore listen
[1:11:51] so you've got to have that sharp tool
[1:11:54] amen you got to minister you might be
[1:11:58] even preaching the message but he
[1:12:00] doesn't have a sharp tool the tool is
[1:12:03] dull uh you know it's not sharp when you
[1:12:08] say sharp it doesn't mean sharp mind it
[1:12:10] don't mean anything like that doesn't
[1:12:12] mean intelligence or or the human wisdom
[1:12:16] of man but but they they let me say this
[1:12:20] slow down let me think of what this is
[1:12:23] they the Discerning power the
[1:12:28] penetration of the word by the Holy
[1:12:31] Spirit to be able to separate truth from
[1:12:34] error not just me telling you it but
[1:12:38] when you hear it you recognize
[1:12:40] you will even know that's not that's
[1:12:42] just that man you'll know it believe you
[1:12:45] me nobody can really explain that but
[1:12:48] somehow you are going to know it amen
[1:12:51] you you'll even know when I come out of
[1:12:53] the spirit and I come into myself and I
[1:12:55] go back and the Spirit come back to my
[1:12:56] you'll recognize it because it's right
[1:12:59] before you if you are spiritual if you
[1:13:02] are one of those stones or those genes
[1:13:04] come from God you are recognized what's
[1:13:07] happening glory be to God hallelujah
[1:13:10] this is the mystery of preaching Paul
[1:13:12] talked about praise the name of the Lord
[1:13:14] glory to God how important it is to know
[1:13:16] that see so I come this morning and to
[1:13:21] some of you what I am preaching is
[1:13:23] nothing but using a hammer
[1:13:26] and the Bible said that Mason must come
[1:13:29] with some of you know about masonry how
[1:13:31] many in here knows what I mean oh you
[1:13:33] got some idea
[1:13:35] they have special hammers for the Mason
[1:13:38] so that when they want to break a brick
[1:13:40] it doesn't bust up the brick it just
[1:13:42] breaks that precise peace they want to
[1:13:45] break off that hammer is made when
[1:13:48] strikes there is going to break off that
[1:13:51] bad peace that that person shouldn't
[1:13:53] have in their life anymore it just
[1:13:55] breaks it off when the hammer strikes it
[1:13:57] like that and then he he what's the
[1:14:00] other little Spade that he has that
[1:14:03] spreads the mortar what they call that
[1:14:05] a trowel oh you know it okay so when I
[1:14:10] use it no problem
[1:14:14] so he has a trowel that he spreads the
[1:14:17] water because the Brick by itself is not
[1:14:20] going to build anything it's got to have
[1:14:23] Fellowship
[1:14:24] it's got to be cemented in love together
[1:14:28] as one
[1:14:30] amen so that they cannot together they
[1:14:33] can accomplish something for the glory
[1:14:35] of God
[1:14:37] Hallelujah that's what it's for and then
[1:14:40] uh you know the man has to have a chisel
[1:14:43] a sharp tool you gotta have a chisel
[1:14:46] that he has to use sometimes they have
[1:14:48] to put the names or something in the
[1:14:51] Rock and so they'll use a chisel to do
[1:14:54] that praise the name of the Lord and the
[1:14:56] pastor the preacher maybe has to take
[1:14:59] the word and sometimes it's gonna cut
[1:15:02] you
[1:15:04] Hallelujah my don't be ashamed if you
[1:15:08] got to shout out
[1:15:10] ouch or me ah whatever shout praise God
[1:15:14] hallelujah amen but he has to use a
[1:15:17] sharp tool
[1:15:19] sometimes God would let him even use a
[1:15:22] sharper tool
[1:15:24] and that would be the word itself
[1:15:27] and do some spiritual surgery
[1:15:30] because you might be having some atrophy
[1:15:33] of the heart
[1:15:34] a hard-heartedness and coldness and he
[1:15:39] has got to do a surgical work where uh
[1:15:42] you wake up and you don't realize you
[1:15:44] were operated on
[1:15:48] the preacher preaches the word and the
[1:15:52] word takes out the excess carnality or
[1:15:55] flesh
[1:15:57] takes out the selfishness The Pride
[1:15:59] takes out all those things out of you
[1:16:03] resentment and spirits of revention
[1:16:06] Vengeance instead of letting those
[1:16:08] things go and put your life in the hands
[1:16:11] of God and let him shape you and make
[1:16:14] you into what you're supposed to be a
[1:16:17] stone a living Stone being shaped by the
[1:16:20] word a preached word of God ready to be
[1:16:23] placed into the New Jerusalem that you
[1:16:27] might find your place in the kingdom of
[1:16:30] God hallelujah blessed be the name of
[1:16:32] the Lord oh my you see the rest of them
[1:16:38] they only want decisions
[1:16:41] amen but as a stone Mason he is there to
[1:16:45] shed that and make them quickness quit

[1:19:29] him the glory and all the praise amen
[1:19:32] yes sir this he says
[1:19:36] yes what the end time evangelism
[1:19:39] is all about
[1:19:41] it's taking them stones and beginning to
[1:19:46] shape them for the glory of God
[1:19:49] hallelujah and that's what I have been
[1:19:51] trying to do is taking the little genes
[1:19:55] the seeds of the germs of God that's in
[1:19:59] the hearts of the True Believers and
[1:20:02] shaping them to fit into the Rapture
[1:20:05] that's right at hand that we will all
[1:20:07] find our place in the presence of God
[1:20:10] Amen that we might make sure we are in
[1:20:14] the New Jerusalem that we are in that
[1:20:17] house that God told Solomon that my
[1:20:21] house you really can't build it I'll
[1:20:23] build myself a house amen and then we
[1:20:26] hear the voice from Heaven saying behold
[1:20:30] the Tabernacle of God is now with man
[1:20:33] for now I there will be my people I will
[1:20:37] be their God the habitation of God is
[1:20:41] now with man in man God's house is in
[1:20:45] you and me Paul said no you're not you
[1:20:49] are the Temple of the Holy Ghost God
[1:20:52] Lives in You by a truth amen praise the
[1:20:55] name of the Living God Amen repeat he
[1:20:59] says let me repeat what good
[1:21:02] what's that Stone the
[1:21:05] if you are just a pile with the rest of
[1:21:10] them
[1:21:12] and lay there
[1:21:14] with the rest of them pile them up
[1:21:17] together memberships memberships amen
[1:21:21] but a stone is no good without a stone
[1:21:25] Mason
[1:21:27] there's a lot of people let him say they
[1:21:28] don't need a pastor a lot of people that
[1:21:31] think that they can be their own pastor
[1:21:33] but you do not understand you maybe have
[1:21:36] the the same wisdom knowledge and
[1:21:40] intellectual ability
[1:21:43] um mentally you may have the same thing
[1:21:45] you maybe you'll have some better ideas
[1:21:47] than the pastor but you see a pastor is
[1:21:50] a predestinated tool that God set in the
[1:21:54] church that whenever he wants to speak
[1:21:57] whenever he wants to reveal whenever he
[1:22:00] wants to make known himself that he
[1:22:03] knows this is one vessel I can come to
[1:22:05] and he will use that vessel for that
[1:22:08] purpose
[1:22:09] they may not be good for anything else
[1:22:11] the man may not be good at books he may
[1:22:13] not be good at Medical he may not be
[1:22:15] good at that he may not yeah he may look
[1:22:18] as if he's upside manufacturer of
[1:22:20] somewhere here brother I've got a quote
[1:22:23] her brother Brian said they'll even
[1:22:24] think of him as a fanatic as a crank
[1:22:27] some all crank out of somewhere he says
[1:22:30] but that's the way God works
[1:22:33] is that right and God is able to now
[1:22:35] make himself manifest amen because God
[1:22:39] ordained that person to be his servant
[1:22:42] and to reveal himself through him praise
[1:22:45] the Lord for that glory amen yes sir oh
[1:22:49] my you see he has to have that stone
[1:22:52] Mason
[1:22:54] because Jesus doesn't count and I'm
[1:22:58] saying this he doesn't just count how
[1:23:00] many rocks or stones but Jesus looks and
[1:23:05] he counts the character that's there
[1:23:07] he counts the character not the members
[1:23:11] but those ones with the character praise
[1:23:15] the name of the Lord oh my see he
[1:23:18] repeats he comes character you see God
[1:23:22] always wants to get one man or woman in
[1:23:25] his hand and that's all he needs he'll
[1:23:29] do his work through many years through
[1:23:32] that see he could only find one
[1:23:34] righteous man in the time of know that
[1:23:37] he could work through in the time of
[1:23:39] Moses he only found one righteous man
[1:23:41] praise God hallelujah but friends here
[1:23:45] we are at the end time praise the Lord
[1:23:48] glory to God now I can even end now but
[1:23:52] I'll say some more praise God is that
[1:23:54] okay
[1:23:57] now a lot of people say brother Simon I
[1:24:00] already have that character
[1:24:02] I'm a man of dignity and and I'm a man
[1:24:07] of good habits and so on I'm a good man
[1:24:11] or good woman and that that's not what
[1:24:13] he's talking about
[1:24:15] person can be come to the Perfection of
[1:24:18] goodness and charitableness and be a
[1:24:20] good man a good woman but they don't
[1:24:23] have the seed they don't have the germ
[1:24:27] they don't have that chip of the Rock
[1:24:30] The Little Rock in them the stabilizing
[1:24:33] force in them they just don't have that
[1:24:36] amen another place Harry said if they
[1:24:39] don't have that they can be religious
[1:24:42] and everything else they want all they
[1:24:44] will ever be is another wonderful church
[1:24:47] member
[1:24:49] amen without that predestinated elected
[1:24:53] portion in them they'll end up being
[1:24:56] nothing but a beautiful wonderful church
[1:24:59] member but we want to have the life of
[1:25:02] God in us
[1:25:05] we want to know that we know that we
[1:25:08] know
[1:25:10] hallelujah praise God
[1:25:13] my goodness yes sir oh praise God
[1:25:17] hallelujah yes shaping you for the
[1:25:20] Rapture not members but men and women
[1:25:24] that God can work through the years how
[1:25:27] satisfying is that to a servant of God
[1:25:30] that even if God calls me away are you
[1:25:34] away that you know that Brethren are
[1:25:37] left here praise God that God can work
[1:25:40] through
[1:25:41] and God can continue his work and God
[1:25:44] can manifest himself and declare his
[1:25:47] generation for the glory of God
[1:25:49] hallelujah so oh my I I got the cartoon
[1:25:53] me even as Christians now and I'm going
[1:25:57] to preach a little on this and then
[1:25:58] leave to rest for next week praise the
[1:26:01] Lord and that's what's Nexus to come
[1:26:03] praise God I want you salivating so when
[1:26:06] you come back next week you received a
[1:26:09] word hallelujah but you see Peter sure
[1:26:13] thought he had that character
[1:26:16] because these men try to live the best
[1:26:19] they could right but listen what he says
[1:26:22] here
[1:26:23] now remember when they came for Jesus in
[1:26:27] Gethsemane
[1:26:29] Peter already believed see but Peter had
[1:26:33] a sword
[1:26:35] oh my
[1:26:38] and when they were trying to take Jesus
[1:26:41] the prophet said he pulled out that
[1:26:43] sword and was going to cut off the high
[1:26:48] priest's ears and things like that amen
[1:26:52] and he even did it amen and you know
[1:26:55] Jesus put it back but when it comes to
[1:26:58] real Christian Courage he had courage to
[1:27:01] do that
[1:27:02] but he did not have the real Christian
[1:27:05] Courage see he didn't have that because
[1:27:09] he surely didn't have it because right
[1:27:12] then
[1:27:13] he cut off the high priest's ears but
[1:27:16] backed up and backed away and denied the
[1:27:20] word right then
[1:27:22] you see the difference between those two
[1:27:24] types of Courage is that right you see
[1:27:27] he backed away from the word and it
[1:27:30] takes courage to embrace the word it
[1:27:33] takes courage to hold on to God's
[1:27:36] unchanging hand amen yes sir Oh my he
[1:27:40] cut off the high priest's ear with his
[1:27:42] sword
[1:27:44] because in this world he knew how to
[1:27:48] handle it
[1:27:49] my God I don't doubt we have a lot of
[1:27:52] good sword fences in here
[1:27:54] and sword fencing don't mean you have to
[1:27:56] know how to use a you know a sword like
[1:27:59] that but with words they can fence with
[1:28:01] the pastor and argue one you know and
[1:28:04] slip and slide and everything else they
[1:28:06] might even chop the pastor's ears off
[1:28:08] and whatever yeah yeah they may have
[1:28:12] that ability right there let me see my
[1:28:15] goodness because the prophet says here
[1:28:17] you cut off the high priest heirs with
[1:28:19] that sword yes because Peter knew how to
[1:28:22] that handle that sword well
[1:28:25] oh my yes sir but when it comes to the
[1:28:30] squeeze for them to stand up to the word
[1:28:33] then we'll see if they have that courage
[1:28:37] amen courage to stand up for the word
[1:28:40] then we're gonna see if they have that
[1:28:43] courage amen now that's where it is
[1:28:46] today
[1:28:48] he says they have a courage to build up
[1:28:52] great big buildings
[1:28:54] what Courage the great build great
[1:28:56] buildings you know he's talking about
[1:28:58] these are men they got courage and you
[1:29:01] got to give it to them that can walk up
[1:29:04] to a bank and say I need 40 million
[1:29:07] dollars
[1:29:09] and they got the courage to go into debt
[1:29:13] and the courage that somehow I'm gonna
[1:29:16] pay this off so they have courage
[1:29:19] but is the prophet said that's not the
[1:29:21] courage I'm talking about right you can
[1:29:24] build build big buildings with that kind
[1:29:26] of Courage yeah you can accomplish a lot
[1:29:30] of great things that way but that's not
[1:29:33] the courage that I'm talking about amen
[1:29:35] yeah the courage I'm talking about is to
[1:29:38] stay with this word
[1:29:40] because the squeeze is going to come
[1:29:42] down and you're going to have to make a
[1:29:45] choice uh Peter uh uh are you are you
[1:29:49] with them or uh well you weren't you the
[1:29:52] man in the garden there that I saw with
[1:29:54] Jesus not me I wasn't with that message
[1:29:58] uh that Branham thing I was I was I
[1:30:02] wasn't with it you see he had the
[1:30:03] courage to chop off the ears but not the
[1:30:05] cars to stand with the word the prophet
[1:30:07] said they got courage to build up them
[1:30:09] big buildings but even if they're in the
[1:30:12] message when the real squeeze comes down
[1:30:14] he says we'll see them how many is going
[1:30:17] to stand with God's word take the way
[1:30:20] with God's chosen through God's few and
[1:30:23] press their way into the kingdom of the
[1:30:26] Living God Amen yes sir hallelujah oh my
[1:30:31] think of it courage to go out there and
[1:30:35] to get them big buildings millions of
[1:30:40] dollars they got courage to trust God
[1:30:43] for pipe organs
[1:30:46] plush seats in their buildings
[1:30:49] everything else amen and everything else
[1:30:53] and to courage to press the light from
[1:30:56] one place to the other cross the world
[1:30:59] methodists turn them into Baptist
[1:31:01] Baptist turn them into something else
[1:31:03] but when it comes to the real Christian
[1:31:06] Courage to tell them we don't have any
[1:31:09] denomination
[1:31:11] we're not bringing you to our church
[1:31:13] government
[1:31:14] we're not bringing you into any system
[1:31:16] we're simply pointing you back to the
[1:31:19] word
[1:31:20] we are just Christians what do you mean
[1:31:23] you're just Christian you got to belong
[1:31:25] to something we belong to somebody
[1:31:28] uh you may belong to something but we
[1:31:31] belong to somebody and that person is
[1:31:34] Jesus Christ and we are Christians for
[1:31:37] belief the word of God I'm going to
[1:31:39] begin to wind this up now praise the
[1:31:41] name of the Lord hallelujah praise God
[1:31:44] you see they have all that courage amen
[1:31:47] but they don't have the courage to
[1:31:49] accept the word of God
[1:31:52] which is this message of the hour amen
[1:31:56] praise God hallelujah I'm still quoting
[1:31:59] all the time where I'm talking here
[1:32:01] again remember what good is the your
[1:32:07] stones without that stone missing
[1:32:10] amongst you
[1:32:12] amen you've got to have a pastor you've
[1:32:16] got to have one of the faithful Ministry
[1:32:18] ministering the word on the divine
[1:32:21] inspiration not just parenting
[1:32:24] collecting quotes and then put them
[1:32:26] together in uh logical ways and then
[1:32:31] bring them out to you no we are not here
[1:32:34] to be lawyers we are not here to be
[1:32:37] politicians we are not here to play
[1:32:40] membership against membership Rich
[1:32:42] against poor poor poor against Rich
[1:32:44] because we want to stay in good The
[1:32:46] Graces or the rich ones in the
[1:32:48] congregations no sir we are not
[1:32:50] politicians a real principle word of God
[1:32:54] and give you a punch from the word with
[1:32:56] their fists amen now you might know
[1:32:59] God's word hit your soul amen God's word
[1:33:03] is the one that's doing the job amen not
[1:33:06] for favoritism or anything of that
[1:33:08] matter Hallelujah glory be to God
[1:33:11] hallelujah I I know many can even say
[1:33:13] what I'm saying and still turn around
[1:33:14] and do the same thing they're talking
[1:33:16] against
[1:33:18] amen so though I'm telling you keep your
[1:33:21] spiritual hats on and recognize the
[1:33:24] devil in all this works he's cunning his
[1:33:26] Wicked he's smart he's sharp rather
[1:33:29] Brandon said in the church ages do you
[1:33:31] think with your little puny mind you're
[1:33:34] going to go against uh a being that's
[1:33:38] not an existence of 100 thousands of
[1:33:41] years
[1:33:42] and think you're gonna compete with him
[1:33:45] no that's why you need the presence of
[1:33:48] God in your life that's why you need
[1:33:51] Jesus Christ Hallelujah he is the one
[1:33:53] that has defeated him
[1:33:55] already defeated him and then he gets
[1:33:58] that power against that to you now if
[1:34:01] you believe this word and let me live
[1:34:03] through you then I can manifest myself
[1:34:06] through you and continue to manifest my
[1:34:09] great Victory and make a great parade of
[1:34:12] him or amen openly praise the Lord glory
[1:34:16] to God
[1:34:17] remember
[1:34:20] God is looking for character
[1:34:24] you must search yourself whether you are
[1:34:26] just you have that cartoon you and if
[1:34:30] you're not sure whether you have that
[1:34:31] character Lord make it plain to me make
[1:34:36] it plain to everybody else that that
[1:34:39] character is in me father because you're
[1:34:42] looking for character not membership
[1:34:44] amen
[1:34:47] Eleazar when he went to get the bride
[1:34:50] for Isaac he sweated it out until he was
[1:34:54] able to find someone with that character
[1:34:58] amen hallelujah remember see what was it
[1:35:03] that he had to do God wanted him to go
[1:35:06] out there and say hunt my bride and
[1:35:09] that's what this preacher the real
[1:35:12] sermon of God is supposed to do not just
[1:35:15] because
[1:35:16] any the church filled up amen and I
[1:35:20] repeat this again not because to make me
[1:35:24] look like somebody or something but at
[1:35:26] one time we had over 500 members and
[1:35:32] growing and the building we had at that
[1:35:34] time could not hold them and the parking
[1:35:37] began to become so clogged in the
[1:35:39] streets that the people began to
[1:35:41] complain to the municipality
[1:35:43] but then as the ministry changed and the
[1:35:47] word began to be preached and sharper
[1:35:50] edged sharper cutting shaping forming
[1:35:55] bringing it into something God wants it
[1:35:58] to be many fell away not because they're
[1:36:02] not good people but that little
[1:36:04] something that God is looking for just
[1:36:07] was not living there amen I've said it
[1:36:10] again not that some will not come up as
[1:36:12] servants as servers as guards or
[1:36:15] whatever but uh God is looking right now
[1:36:18] for the elect lady
[1:36:21] he's looking for his bride and there are
[1:36:25] few that be amen praise the Lord
[1:36:27] hallelujah see God bless your hearts we
[1:36:31] are not looking for members we're
[1:36:33] looking for the purine heart that will
[1:36:37] believe the word
[1:36:40] and I just make a note here God is
[1:36:43] looking through his ministers for people
[1:36:45] that can stand the preaching of the real
[1:36:48] word that can stand the preaching of the
[1:36:51] word and not move anyway no matter what
[1:36:54] happened to them they'll stand the word
[1:36:57] of God hallelujah well yes I looked
[1:37:01] amen and realize I can't do this by
[1:37:04] myself he asked for God's help to show
[1:37:07] him amen Rebecca that bride Elias of God
[1:37:13] in his knees God help me and when he
[1:37:16] referred to God God helped him so that
[1:37:20] the people he found that person he found
[1:37:23] was Rebecca a person that had character
[1:37:27] amen see praise God and thank God elieza
[1:37:32] I mean Rebecca was in love with Isaac
[1:37:36] before she even saw him
[1:37:39] is that right do you realize that's
[1:37:41] repeating again
[1:37:43] right now brother Branham said in
[1:37:47] another quotation the one whom you you
[1:37:50] don't see with your eyes but you feel
[1:37:53] Limited in your heart one day that
[1:37:56] person will become personalized before
[1:37:58] you he'll make himself manifest right
[1:38:00] before you but she loved him before she
[1:38:04] even saw him is that right oh we love
[1:38:08] him praise God before we even see him we
[1:38:13] see him in the word form but we don't
[1:38:15] see him in the flesh in front of us but
[1:38:17] we love him with all our hearts amen
[1:38:20] praise God and as jeans of the Living
[1:38:23] God my friends we want to Bow Down and
[1:38:27] Worship Him and to fulfill his Divine
[1:38:30] Purpose and we want to remain for the
[1:38:33] rest of our lives until he catches us
[1:38:35] home deeply in love with him praise the
[1:38:39] Lord don't get nervous when I say deeply
[1:38:41] in love I'm talking about him praise the
[1:38:43] name of the Lord you must know who you
[1:38:45] are deeply in love with but as far as
[1:38:48] I'm concerned I'm deeply in love with my
[1:38:52] wife I'm deeply in love with the word of
[1:38:55] God here and I live for that every day
[1:38:58] that I'm here praise the Lord glory to
[1:39:01] God thank you for putting up with me
[1:39:04] thank you Jesus I know because you know
[1:39:08] sometimes I'm preachers you you you
[1:39:10] appear like a person that's just come to
[1:39:13] hang out clothes
[1:39:16] every you're seeing spots and all these
[1:39:18] clothes and so you gotta use a piece of
[1:39:20] stick we call it a beater
[1:39:25] and beat The Living Daylights out of
[1:39:27] that sheet and make it white again
[1:39:30] praise the Lord so so sometimes that's
[1:39:33] the way you appear but you realize that
[1:39:35] if us Paul said as preachers we must
[1:39:38] speak the truth
[1:39:40] speak the truth in love
[1:39:43] and love is corrective
[1:39:46] it's comforting also but it's corrective
[1:39:50] and I thank God for that may God bless
[1:39:53] every one of you here today that's all
[1:39:56] we are trying to do as ministers
[1:39:57] regardless if whether I'm up here
[1:40:00] whether it's any of the other young
[1:40:03] ministers up here we're just trying to

[1:40:14] Ready
[1:40:15] by the change in your character and that
[1:40:19] change continues to go on Prophet said
[1:40:22] we will never come to the fullness of
[1:40:25] that until the Rapture comes and takes
[1:40:29] you out of here for the sticky nature
[1:40:32] will be with you amen all the way
[1:40:37] through until you get out of here the
[1:40:40] kind of scent that these churches are
[1:40:43] believing in is believing that they
[1:40:45] attains sainthood through Perfection of
[1:40:49] their physical being on the earth and
[1:40:51] God is saying no
[1:40:53] sainthood you don't have to physically
[1:40:56] die to be made a saint
