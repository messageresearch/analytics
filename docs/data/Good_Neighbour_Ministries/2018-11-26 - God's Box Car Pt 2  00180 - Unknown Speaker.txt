steps tears after we have eaten the bread and drops the line praise the Lord gracious father we thank you for the spiritual feast of the Word of God given to us and now we are about to break the bread and drink of wine the greater this represents your body problem for us and the wine this represents for shed blood in the simplicity and the sacredness of this movement bless us everyone in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen praise the Lord if I'm to read from the Bible verse covering tips you know how to find great or I am received of the Lord that which also I delivered up to you the Lord Jesus the same thing which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said thanks brother bread brother corrugation please I'm gracious Father Lord Jesus we give you thanks Lord for this bread represents what you did for us and you broke your life and you place it upon us and now we can partake in remembrance of your precious day on Calvary that now that light is

and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord what man horrible examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep or if we should shut ourselves we will not reach us but when what jobs will chase
