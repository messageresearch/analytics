[6:17] ask it in Jesus name to the glory of God
[6:20] Amen and amen
[6:23] amen together with one voice let us
[6:27] read and he said
[6:30] also unto his
[6:32] disciples there was a certain rich man
[6:35] which had a and the same was accused
[6:39] unto him that he had wasted his goods
[6:43] and he called him and said unto him how
[6:46] is it that I hear of this of thee give
[6:49] an account of thy stewardship for
[6:52] thouest no longer be sure then the Ste
[6:57] said with himself within him s what
[7:00] shall I do for my Lord take it away from
[7:03] me this lordship I cannot dig to beg I
[7:07] am ashamed I am resolved what to do that
[7:10] when I am put out of the stewardship
[7:13] they may receive me into their houses so
[7:16] he called every one of his Lord's deers
[7:19] unto him and said unto the first how
[7:22] much thou unto my Lord and he said 100
[7:25] measures of oil he said unto him take
[7:29] thy bills sit down quickly and write 50
[7:31] then said he to the other and how much
[7:34] are thou he said 100 measures of week he
[7:37] said take thy bill right Four score and
[7:40] the Lord commanded the just children
[7:43] because he had done wisely for the
[7:45] children of this world are in their
[7:48] generation wiser than the children of
[7:51] life and I say unto you make to
[7:54] yourselves Friends of the man of
[7:56] unrighteousness that when you fail they
[7:59] may receive you into Everlasting
[8:02] habitations he that is faithful in that
[8:05] which is least is faithful also in much
[8:08] and he that is unjust in the least is
[8:11] unjust also in much if therefore you
[8:14] have not been faithful in the
[8:16] unrighteous man who will commit to you
[8:19] trust the true riches and if you have
[8:22] not been faithful in that which is
[8:25] another man's who shall give you that
[8:28] which is your
[8:29] own no servant can serve two masters for
[8:36] neither either he will hate the one and
[8:38] love the other or else he will hold to
[8:42] the one and despise the other you cannot
[8:46] serve God and and when the Pharisees
[8:50] also who were cious heard all these
[8:54] things and they dered them Hallelujah
[9:00] praise der righted him praise the Lord
[9:03] may the Lord give us understanding and
[9:06] wisdom in his word please be
[9:17] seated glory to
[9:19] God hallelujah amen now I don't know
[9:24] about you but have you ever received or
[9:28] have you been receiving flight s in the
[9:30] mail about investment offers or
[9:34] opportunities um anybody anybody
[9:38] here or otherwise maybe you go to your
[9:41] bank and they're always pushing some
[9:43] investment uh thing at you uh for you to
[9:46] receive praise the Lord I believe you
[9:48] know brother Brandon spoke on the
[9:50] message called
[9:52] Investments um and uh in there I believe
[9:57] there are some quotes that they can
[9:59] there if you advance that okay brother
[10:02] Bram said any
[10:04] businessman if he's a good businessman
[10:08] is
[10:09] interested in good Investments because
[10:13] it pays off it pays off always or it
[10:17] always pays off in fact you invest
[10:21] because you want your Investments to
[10:23] increase amen there's nobody in here
[10:26] invest money uh and give it to the bank
[10:29] and happy that it decreased no sir you
[10:33] know if you go back and look at your
[10:35] bank account and it decreased even if
[10:37] it's genuine bills came out of
[10:39] it sometimes you still feel bad because
[10:44] you really would like your Investments
[10:47] to increase praise God and it looks like
[10:51] there is more
[10:52] opportunities uh coming to you for
[10:55] investment uh than than the money you
[10:58] got to really invest so uh today I'd
[11:04] like us to look at what is God's
[11:06] investment
[11:08] strategy and I know why I'm telling you
[11:11] this because many years
[11:13] ago uh the same thing that happened to
[11:16] brother Brenham one day when he a
[11:20] certain brother he was talking to the
[11:22] brother and in the middle of it all of a
[11:24] sudden the Holy Spirit spoke out and
[11:26] said go to this certain place by that
[11:29] land take there you're going to get
[11:32] oil and of course he went dug and he got
[11:36] discouraged because he wanted quick you
[11:39] know everybody you know most people like
[11:41] quick money they get the lottery or
[11:44] raffle or something um not something for
[11:47] nothing it's okay quick they want quick
[11:50] money so uh it didn't come quick so he
[11:53] gave up and sold it the other man bought
[11:56] the place dug and in less than a day or
[11:59] two he struck
[12:01] oil and the manale of course became very
[12:04] wealthy he rushed back to brother
[12:06] remember our Prophet said that wasn't me
[12:08] that was him so let me tell you the same
[12:11] thing it's not me it's him cuz I don't
[12:14] want anybody coming to me after and said
[12:17] brother speak a word for
[12:20] me because it doesn't work that way I
[12:24] don't even know all of a sudden the holy
[12:27] spirit will speak out it's his purpose
[12:30] amen is his divine plan so some years
[12:33] ago and some Believers didn't know about
[12:35] it there was a brother in the church and
[12:37] he came to me and we were talking and
[12:39] stuff like that the Holy Spirit spoke up
[12:41] and said go and invest on this certain
[12:44] certain
[12:46] stop and he
[12:48] did and within a month or two after that
[12:52] he was holding a half a million dollars
[12:55] from off of that stop that was worth
[12:57] literally like nothing
[12:59] pennies and he was holding half a
[13:02] million dollars it's never happened
[13:04] again but it happened there for real it
[13:07] happened there and he was holding this
[13:09] half a million dollars and after you got
[13:12] the half a million dollars a lot of
[13:14] events starting taking place after all
[13:16] of a sudden next thing you know he was
[13:18] like 8 to 900,000 so much he said
[13:22] brother by a few months more I'll Be A
[13:24] Millionaire praise God hallelujah I said
[13:27] brother you know what what you need to
[13:29] do take that money take half of the
[13:32] money or how much ever you feel in your
[13:34] heart put it in an investment some
[13:37] investment where you yourself can't
[13:39] hardly touch it and allow that part to
[13:42] grow and the other part that you have
[13:44] you can literally not waste it but do
[13:47] whatever you want with it whether it's a
[13:49] house this that whatever do what with it
[13:51] but you have at least some security that
[13:54] that's there working for you
[13:56] yes well he said yes brother yes brother
[13:59] didn't listen to me about a year later
[14:02] you know of course he was going on
[14:03] vacations and going different things and
[14:06] places and uh this is a brother I love
[14:08] I'm just using him as an illustration
[14:10] he's gone to be the Lord now but the
[14:13] fact is within a year
[14:16] right um all the money was
[14:19] God squandered away because he didn't
[14:22] listen to the same voice that told him
[14:25] how to get it he wouldn't listen to the
[14:27] same voice telling him how to use it
[14:30] right and surely as your faith brings
[14:33] the things to you your doubt takes it
[14:35] away Disobedience takes it away you've
[14:39] got to stay with the word of God at
[14:41] every turn and at every Point praise the
[14:44] Lord now um uh look at what the prophet
[14:47] of God says up there you are to have a
[14:51] good investment then if it's not a good
[14:55] it's not good business to keep what you
[14:57] got in your
[14:59] pocket all right because you better put
[15:02] it to work you remember our Lord talking
[15:05] about the talents when you rebuke this
[15:07] children and say why didn't you invest
[15:08] my money why didn't you invest it no you
[15:12] you when I'm talking about what happened
[15:14] there I don't want you to go into a
[15:16] spirit of fear and and then keep all
[15:18] your money in your pocket or in some uh
[15:22] bank account that uh gives you nothing
[15:24] but the fees is reducing it
[15:26] incrementally where you hardly can
[15:28] notice God is saying no you need to
[15:30] invest it yes amen naturally and
[15:34] spiritually praise the Lord hallelujah I
[15:37] might as well tell you I'm here to stir
[15:39] you up amen a great singer says Stir It
[15:42] Up and I'm here to Stir It Up I want you
[15:46] to get stirred up about it praise the
[15:49] Lord that God would have a channel
[15:52] through which to bless you amen praise
[15:55] the Lord hallelujah if you don't have a
[15:57] pipeline in your house there would be no
[16:00] place for you to be able to go and draw
[16:02] fresh water but you got to have a
[16:05] pipeline to the Natural economy whether
[16:08] business whether work whether job
[16:10] whether something you got to have a
[16:11] pipeline right to the ocean to the river
[16:15] to be able to get water you got to have
[16:17] a pipeline to God's economy for God to
[16:20] be able to send his blessings to you
[16:24] that's right whether by a quter in half
[16:26] in 1 in or a great big pip yes sir or
[16:30] truckloads it's up to you it's according
[16:33] to your faith so shall it be unto you if
[16:37] thou can believe all things are possible
[16:42] to them that can believe amen I'm
[16:44] starting to feel Faith lifting
[16:46] Hallelujah while I'm yet
[16:48] speaking I'm becoming sensitive and I
[16:51] can feel it starting to lift so thanks
[16:53] be to God
[16:55] hallelujah amen now half for the
[16:58] Parables Jesus told in the Bible had to
[17:01] deal with
[17:03] money and it's because money has a very
[17:07] important part to play in our
[17:09] lives and you can become super
[17:13] spiritual and and and just say you don't
[17:16] need to have money or you don't have
[17:18] need to have any of these things um but
[17:22] as I usually say you're not just going
[17:23] to pray to God and then all of a sudden
[17:26] a bag of money is going to drop down in
[17:28] your room bang on the ground and you
[17:30] wake up and say oh thank you Jesus and
[17:32] all of a sudden you're blessed you're
[17:33] rich it doesn't happen that way you got
[17:36] to do something for something to happen
[17:39] am you got to have action for reaction
[17:42] Hallelujah do all you can and then stand
[17:47] and wait on God and he will make a way
[17:49] up amen praise the name of the Lord amen
[17:52] now one out of every six verses in
[17:56] Matthew Mark Luke and John deal with
[17:59] money or with material
[18:02] blessings you remember when Peter asked
[18:05] the Lord he said Lord what will we get
[18:08] after the rest stay behind and kind of
[18:10] push Peter and say go ask him go ask him
[18:13] say what shall we get for following you
[18:15] now that sounds caral you have the
[18:18] privilege of Walking With Jesus the
[18:20] Messiah and you are going to ask him
[18:23] about caral things how to get blessed
[18:26] with money how to improve your State
[18:29] status in life how to lift your social
[18:32] condition those are natural things why
[18:34] would you talk to the Lord about that
[18:35] only ask God about how to get holy how
[18:38] to be humble but you see we are both
[18:42] human natural and we spiritual and
[18:45] you're not in heaven yet and you got to
[18:46] balance the two things you got to ask
[18:49] him to bless you so you can keep I know
[18:51] you want to worship him with your soul
[18:53] but you got to eat and live to keep Body
[18:56] and Soul together
[19:01] hallelujah
[19:05] amen how would it be like if I came to
[19:08] church here to preach only to Invisible
[19:11] Souls All Souls church and it's just
[19:17] soul but we need your soul with your
[19:20] body Hallelujah and God knows that so he
[19:24] wants to bless you naturally and
[19:27] spiritually so that you can PR together
[19:29] and when he raises you up he going to
[19:31] raise your take your soul and he raise
[19:33] up your body together praise the Lord
[19:36] they both got a go there praise to God
[19:38] so Jesus even spoke more about money
[19:41] than
[19:43] Heaven he spoke more about money than
[19:48] hell right and friends I think that
[19:52] should be interesting to
[19:54] us because I believe God is trying to
[19:57] say he knows the tremendous influence
[20:01] and impact money has in our
[20:04] lives and we cannot avoid it everywhere
[20:08] you turn the world system is set up to
[20:11] operate with money and it's set up in a
[20:15] way to get you in depth or indebted yes
[20:20] there is a pattern of global
[20:24] enslavement uh through their systems we
[20:28] won't talk about that now but just to
[20:31] for you to earn just enough when I was
[20:35] in
[20:36] school uh I got to repeat it again I was
[20:39] taken in a special class aside with just
[20:42] a few and this professor was teaching he
[20:45] says now what I'm going to tell you here
[20:47] is not normally known now you understand
[20:50] that some people in the economy have to
[20:53] be deliberately kept at a certain
[20:56] level because the business class and the
[21:00] investment class and the 1% needs to
[21:03] have an a pool of workers always
[21:07] available that they can di into to carry
[21:10] on the industries of the nation right
[21:14] and that's the reason also why we have a
[21:16] welfare system and even when some people
[21:19] are not even trying to get off of it
[21:21] they're left on it because you got to
[21:24] have that available tool always so that
[21:27] they can reach and get it and if we
[21:29] can't get it then we resort to
[21:32] immigration that keeps the wages and
[21:34] then he goes on with his economic
[21:36] theories and so on their wages at a
[21:38] certain level where they can control
[21:40] things so I just want to show you
[21:42] friends just enough that you can get by
[21:46] eat live wear clothes and you keeping a
[21:50] rat race where you work eat sleep wear
[21:54] go back to work again to get some more
[21:56] to eat sleep wear and the cyle continues
[21:59] and they'll keep it on going until the
[22:01] day you die is that right until you have
[22:04] you decide you got a right idea and you
[22:06] do something and you smash it where now
[22:09] you free yourself from that uh kind of
[22:12] enslavement and then you you still do it
[22:15] but you do it not because you want to do
[22:17] it right not because you have to do it
[22:20] but you're doing it not because you're
[22:22] free to do it I just thought I'd throw
[22:24] that in uh right now even though I don't
[22:26] have that in my notes Here praise the
[22:28] Lord hallelujah so money has great
[22:32] influence over our lives are you going
[22:34] to listen to to me here today yes sir
[22:36] just give me the opportunity to lay this
[22:38] out and it will change your life amen
[22:42] it'll change the way you think about
[22:44] things praise the Lord amen now we know
[22:48] we spend most of our time earning money
[22:52] do you realize that you actually spend
[22:55] more hours working for money than you do
[22:58] or anything else hallelujah praise
[23:02] absolutely only the Christian the
[23:05] dedicated Christian or the True Believer
[23:08] uses more time in the sense that whether
[23:11] we working sleeping eating waiting the
[23:13] Lord is on our hearts 247 we giv him the
[23:18] glory giving him the praise doesn't
[23:20] matter where we are what we're doing we
[23:22] are we are consumed with the presence of
[23:24] the Lord amen
[23:27] hallelujah but the rest of them out
[23:29] there they they're caught up only in a
[23:31] rat race right is that right amen
[23:34] they're caught up in a rat race and
[23:36] that's all they have to do so the fact
[23:39] that we spend Christian or unchristian
[23:42] most of our Lives earning money God has
[23:46] to tell us how to use money which
[23:50] represents the time of your life how
[23:52] much of time in your lifetime you use up
[23:55] to earn that money how to use it wisely
[23:59] nobody wants to live a wasted life right
[24:04] nobody wants to live a wasted life so
[24:07] God has to tell you how to wisely use
[24:10] what he has allowed you to get and or or
[24:15] keep in your lifetime or during your
[24:21] lifetime now we know even in the natural
[24:24] realm social uh Sciences government
[24:27] reports will tell you
[24:30] 56% of all divorces in the world occurs
[24:36] because of
[24:40] money you say Amen like you know expose
[24:43] something in your own walk or something
[24:46] praise that's what you can keep quiet
[24:51] on
[24:53] 56% of all divorces occur because of
[24:58] fight Financial tensions in the
[25:01] home right that is absolute fact not
[25:06] according to me but according to
[25:08] different places I've looked up amen
[25:10] praise the Lord hallelujah and if you
[25:13] don't manage your money well your money
[25:15] is going to manage
[25:17] you you've got to become a money Master
[25:21] our money is going to master you and
[25:24] rule over you over you praise the Lord
[25:28] now the Bible teaches us in that TR fact
[25:30] that money is a
[25:33] test praise the Lord money is a test is
[25:37] a spiritual test that God uses money to
[25:41] test us spiritually to see our our
[25:45] spiritual temperature our spiritual
[25:48] growth and where we are testing us to
[25:52] see if he gives you a little do you get
[25:54] attached to it and then you start
[25:57] cooling off from from him because you
[25:59] have to be busy with the money and not
[26:01] busy with him but when he sees you're
[26:03] faithful this way then he gives you more
[26:05] because he sees it's not getting into
[26:08] your eyes it's not controlling your
[26:10] thoughts and controlling your emotions
[26:12] you're not getting heart attack coming
[26:14] your money and falling over dead because
[26:16] it's so much or anything like that you
[26:18] know of course there was a man in the
[26:20] the town where I came from that was so
[26:22] wealthy and he trusted nobody when his
[26:25] money comes in he has to comfort him El
[26:29] and one day they found him over the
[26:30] table with filled with all the money
[26:33] there dead from a heart attack and uh
[26:37] the wife reported that she went into the
[26:39] room to give him a cup of coffee and he
[26:41] was counting
[26:42] and and he was sweating and and he come
[26:46] after got a heart
[26:49] attack
[26:51] de just like that he's gone counting the
[26:55] money God is saying don't be consumed by
[26:57] it yes and so he has placed in his word
[27:02] and in his economy test to test so that
[27:05] he can test us to see whether the best
[27:08] of us if you don't watch yourself you
[27:10] get you start getting attached to it and
[27:12] you got to come to yourself and break
[27:14] yourself away I don't care who you are
[27:16] you can be as spiritual as you like if
[27:18] you don't watch you will start getting
[27:20] attached to it and you start and then
[27:22] you you you break yourself away praise
[27:24] the lord we we're still human and
[27:27] sometimes we for yet that we are human
[27:30] we we're not up in heaven yet we still
[27:33] down here we got to face everything like
[27:35] everybody else amen but he gives us the
[27:38] power to overcome amen praise God he has
[27:41] given us the power to overcome praise
[27:44] God hallelujah so here me this now
[27:47] listen Luke
[27:50] 1611 if you have not been
[27:53] trustworthy in handling worldly wealth
[27:57] who will trust trust you with true
[28:02] riches you see who will trust you this
[28:06] is a this is a really outstanding
[28:08] parable of course in the Bible and when
[28:11] people read it they don't understand
[28:13] what uh Jesus is doing they actually
[28:16] think that he is glorifying a
[28:18] crook or praising a a cheating Steward
[28:24] uh somebody that pull a scheme on his
[28:26] boss they actually will think that but
[28:30] uh this this Parable is actually not
[28:32] even related to uh glorifying dishonesty
[28:36] or anything like that praise God now
[28:40] Luke 16:14 says the Pharisees who love
[28:43] money the living Bible uh heard all this
[28:47] and they were saring at Jesus mocking at
[28:50] him amen you can imagine the mockery of
[28:53] the Christian just like the mockery to
[28:55] Jesus Oh you saying that because you
[28:57] ain't got none
[28:59] foxes have a hole and the birds have a
[29:04] nest but the son of man he don't have
[29:07] nowhere to lay his sweet head all the
[29:11] phes must have laughed at him one
[29:14] suit and the suit you got somebody gave
[29:18] you you can't buy a suit for yourself
[29:21] and you're talking about the money I
[29:24] mean here's a a man that appears to be a
[29:27] beggar trying to advise a banker how to
[29:31] get
[29:32] money and the Pharisees were lacking
[29:36] their heads off the Bible tells us they
[29:39] sneered at him praise God hallelujah but
[29:44] Jesus was saying all you Pharisees you
[29:46] think you're smart but let me give you a
[29:49] model let me teach you something praise
[29:52] God now remember a greater than Solomon
[29:56] is here and he is teaching them a model
[30:00] and I'm going to use a cook for a model
[30:05] I'm going to use this SCP for a model
[30:07] and so you can understand that the
[30:09] people of this world are Sher or wiser
[30:14] than the people of light now he's
[30:17] talking about Believers and he's saying
[30:19] Believers now watch it now this P I'm
[30:22] going to use it to teach you that the
[30:25] people out there in the world are wiser
[30:29] in their generation
[30:31] smarter than the children of light amen
[30:35] the reason why is because the word of
[30:37] God deals with our nature and make us so
[30:39] much like sheep after a while if you
[30:41] don't watch yourself you get so naive
[30:45] yes is that right that you start
[30:48] swallowing anything that is tall to you
[30:51] true amen but he said be wise as a
[30:54] serpent but harmless as a dog praise the
[30:57] name of the Lord and even sheep have two
[31:02] horns rounds is that right they still
[31:05] got the all Testament and the New
[31:06] Testament to defend themselves with
[31:09] praise the Lord and that's what God has
[31:11] given to us praise the Lord what Jesus
[31:14] is really saying is that many
[31:16] unbelievers are wiser than Christians in
[31:18] how they manage their money amen what
[31:22] it's little or well it's much right it's
[31:25] not the amount here that is cting on and
[31:29] say oh brother Simon I only have a
[31:31] little he doesn't Jesus isn't talking
[31:33] about that he's talking about whether
[31:35] you have little or much he says you need
[31:38] to have wisdom in how you manage or
[31:41] handle your money praise the Lord and
[31:44] what he's also saying is we can learn
[31:47] from them yes amen even though they have
[31:50] a different set of values totally
[31:53] opposite to
[31:55] us we can look at them and certainly see
[31:59] a lot of the things that they they they
[32:02] they're doing that it's really wise
[32:05] praise God of course you can admire a
[32:08] person praise a person without agreeing
[32:11] with what they're doing amen you know in
[32:15] America uh their heroes are like Abraham
[32:19] Lincoln George
[32:21] Washington and later on it was uh Jack
[32:25] Kennedy uh and then Ronald Reagan
[32:28] but when you look the History Channel
[32:31] which I saw this week I was looking at
[32:32] that this week if honest a
[32:36] Lincoln was not as honest as they
[32:38] writing him up in history books he did a
[32:41] lot of corrupt and crooked things to get
[32:45] elected and you can go down the list
[32:48] right on down to Mr re say oh the
[32:50] greatest president in the United States
[32:52] he was selling drugs through Oliver
[32:55] North used him to sell drugs to get
[32:58] money to buy guns to give to the
[33:01] resistance in
[33:03] Nicaragua many many other things it's
[33:05] not demeaning any of these men but it's
[33:08] just to show you that you can admire
[33:10] them for what they
[33:11] accomplished but you don't have to agree
[33:14] with them with what they did and their
[33:17] life's values and their styles of what
[33:20] they did there was a there was
[33:22] interesting article news uh brief on CNN
[33:27] where they showed that Mr Reagan and his
[33:28] wife was leading the country by going to
[33:31] psychics and and having witches coming
[33:33] into the White House and doing seanes
[33:36] and all this stuff inside of The White
[33:38] House and that's how they were leading
[33:39] the country just think about it and and
[33:42] brother Bram spoke about this stuff
[33:44] Witchcraft and all this stuff right
[33:46] there white out long before but the fact
[33:49] is brother and sister we can had my
[33:52] people without agreeing with their
[33:56] values or their LIF
[33:59] and this is what Jesus is saying he says
[34:02] now look at the man don't look at his
[34:05] crookedness but look at his wisdom of
[34:09] how he managed money and what he was
[34:11] doing and learn a lesson from this
[34:15] praise the Lord does everybody in here
[34:17] understand what I'm trying to say amen I
[34:19] want to ask you one more time does
[34:21] everybody in here understand what I'm
[34:22] trying to say I ask you to repeat it
[34:25] because I don't want anybody to leave
[34:27] here and said brother Simon was
[34:29] preaching and teaching on to us how to
[34:32] become a
[34:39] crook Jesus is commanding this
[34:44] man this is how it
[34:46] appears it seems that Jesus is
[34:49] commanding this man or praising him for
[34:51] being
[34:53] dishonest right but what he's saying is
[34:56] that the man did something things that
[34:58] we need to learn from listen to the
[35:00] scriptures Luke 16 1-2 Jesus told his
[35:06] disciples there was a rich man whose
[35:09] manager was accused of wasting his
[35:11] possessions so he called him in and ask
[35:13] him what's this I hear about you give an
[35:17] account of your management because you
[35:19] cannot be a manager any longer now you
[35:23] see the word manager of course the word
[35:26] manager like we thought last week and
[35:27] the week before manager means
[35:30] sure right that's what it means it means
[35:33] sure praise the Lord and we know of
[35:36] course that this Parable it's a parable
[35:39] so it means it's in types it's in
[35:40] symbols it's in Shadows and you got to
[35:43] understand what the Lord God is saying
[35:45] here praise God Amen well now manager
[35:48] you know what that means managing it
[35:50] means managing the possessions or assets
[35:53] of another other than yourself amen that
[35:56] is what you a manager is and God is
[36:00] saying now uh as it says in Genesis 1
[36:04] Genesis 2 that what sorry that you are
[36:07] managers for me praise the Lord and I
[36:10] put you here to manage the Earth you
[36:12] know God says to man you're supposed to
[36:14] subdue it and rule over it like that and
[36:16] dress the garden and so on we place the
[36:19] whole human race placed here as managers
[36:23] so far Naturally Speaking the human race
[36:25] has been bad managers pollution poison
[36:28] all kinds of stuff like that but that's
[36:30] not what we're talking about here
[36:31] spiritually we're talking about the
[36:33] believer and the management of whatever
[36:36] God has placed under your
[36:39] responsibility after a while we'll have
[36:41] a day of accountability but for right
[36:43] now he is teaching us about have how to
[36:46] have this sense of responsibility
[36:49] Genesis
[36:50] 1:27 to 28 write that down um I I didn't
[36:55] put it up there but you can write that
[36:57] down that's when God tells man I want
[36:59] you to multiply replenish the Earth subd
[37:02] do it have dominion over it and also you
[37:05] can uh dress the the garden uh stuff
[37:08] like that praise the Lord so we were put
[37:10] here to manage the Earth and so everyone
[37:13] in here is a
[37:15] manager do you believe that you said me
[37:18] I just work in the factory you're still
[37:20] a manager praise the Lord your boss
[37:23] don't know it but actually you were his
[37:26] maner amen do you know that cuzz you can
[37:30] pray and move him move let God move him
[37:35] move his thoughts move his heart move
[37:38] them but you got to believe that you got
[37:42] the power amen it's in your hands yes
[37:45] praise the Lord hallelujah I said who
[37:47] got the power amen it's in the name of
[37:50] Jesus praise God because at the name of
[37:53] Jesus every knee shall bow amen and
[37:57] every
[37:58] must confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[38:01] amen now in this parable of course the
[38:03] man is clearly a crook and cheating his
[38:07] boss praise the Lord now you say brother
[38:10] Simon why did he do that one it was to
[38:15] make
[38:16] friends and two so that later on he can
[38:20] blackmail
[38:22] them Luke 168 says the master commanded
[38:26] the honest manager be because he acted
[38:29] shrewdly amen and he acted shely in
[38:34] other words you did something right even
[38:37] though you did that he did some things
[38:40] right praise the Lord and I want to
[38:44] share that with you what this man did
[38:47] right so we can take lessons from it are
[38:49] you willing amen are you ready for this
[38:52] amen number one he looked
[38:54] ahead Luke 163 the manager said to
[38:59] himself or talked within himself what
[39:03] shall I do the minute the master tell
[39:05] him you're
[39:06] [Music]
[39:07] fire
[39:09] Hallelujah he Tau with himself what
[39:11] shall I do now my master take it away my
[39:15] job has taken away my job I am not
[39:18] strong enough
[39:19] today and I'm ashamed to go and then you
[39:23] see he was already looking ahead why
[39:27] will my future be mhm praise the
[39:31] Lord secondly he didn't only look ahead
[39:34] he planned
[39:36] aead verse four he said I know what I
[39:40] will do when I lose my job here so
[39:44] people will welcome me into their houses
[39:47] into their business back then the house
[39:49] when they say houses doesn't mean the
[39:51] house you live in it means your entire
[39:53] estate all your business and everything
[39:56] else is included in that praise the Lord
[39:59] you see not only this man look ahead but
[40:02] he had a
[40:03] plan amen amen I'm glad I serve a god
[40:07] with a plan amen even though the world
[40:09] looks random like the the trees are just
[40:12] thrown on the grasses everywhere
[40:14] everything is exactly where it's
[40:15] supposed to be and when man thinks he's
[40:18] smart move it out of his place that's
[40:20] what he causes trouble God knows what to
[40:23] grow on the mountain top and what to
[40:25] grow down in the valley he knows what to
[40:27] be in the bottom of the ocean and watchs
[40:29] to fly in the air yes when we try to
[40:31] change it we make a mess of God's
[40:33] ecology and his economy and and the
[40:35] entire
[40:36] anthropological uh world that we Liv in
[40:39] and geological world that we live in
[40:42] Praise the Lord you know it's too bad
[40:45] but a lot of
[40:46] Christians because of some of the
[40:50] nonsense that a lot of preachers have
[40:52] preached to their
[40:54] congregation they don't want to preach
[40:56] this kind the stuff they might you
[41:00] know the people stop planting
[41:05] AE and they go oh I'm going to live by
[41:11] faith but faith is blind
[41:15] amen Faith looks into tomorrow amen is
[41:19] that right amen that you always here you
[41:22] sing about the eyes of Faith the the six
[41:26] SS
[41:27] amen you you know we use common words
[41:31] and throw them about without thinking H
[41:33] you have sight natural and then you have
[41:37] Insight is that right that's the seeing
[41:40] from inside praise God so so we got to
[41:45] understand what it is and we have to
[41:46] plan ahead you don't go blaming God when
[41:50] you get into trouble because you didn't
[41:53] BL and we want to blame God so why did
[41:56] God do this why did God allow me to get
[41:58] in this situation is the choices you
[42:01] made amen hallelujah take accountability
[42:04] for yourself and pull up your socks and
[42:07] pull yourself together and start being
[42:09] wise this is what Jesus is saying look
[42:12] ahead plan ahead and the third thing the
[42:15] man did he acted real
[42:17] quickly right the boss give him notice
[42:20] you're going to leave next week but
[42:22] before he leave he had his
[42:24] plans and so he start to G out to the
[42:29] customers and he called them on the
[42:32] telephone if they had gone back then but
[42:34] Bible says he acted in other words he
[42:36] acted quickly we get to go and visit
[42:39] them and say look how much you old boss
[42:42] once a well I owe so much he said look
[42:46] man cut that down to 50 right between me
[42:48] and you right this is under the table
[42:55] stock no ta
[43:03] right oh man hallah between me and
[43:07] especially said no this is between me
[43:09] and you you know that not words that
[43:11] needs to stay right here right praise
[43:14] God 50% right he goes to the next one he
[43:17] says how much you owe he says so much he
[43:19] cuts back on that b a you said come on
[43:22] man I mean we've been friends for years
[43:23] I mean I got to give you I got to help
[43:25] you out now the person doesn't know he
[43:27] had a plan but he he says man I got to
[43:30] help you out here man I see you in
[43:31] business was having a hard time let me
[43:33] give you a cut here and he gives him a
[43:35] cut and so on well Jesus just used two
[43:37] examples from the man's business but all
[43:40] I'm sure he spread it out far and wide
[43:43] so that there's no way his plan could
[43:46] fail yes somebody is going to take him
[43:51] [Music]
[43:52] in now when you read the scriptures you
[43:55] you can have fun in the scriptures you
[43:57] can enjoy the scriptures because the
[43:59] scriptures are real and it's come to
[44:01] life amen amen praise the name of the
[44:04] Lord God hallelujah glory to God Amen
[44:08] and what Jesus is saying is that in the
[44:11] light of everything that's going to
[44:12] happen in eternity you are to do the
[44:15] same thing with your
[44:17] money do the same thing with your money
[44:21] look
[44:22] ahead PL
[44:24] ahead and act quickly
[44:28] with whatever it is that you're going to
[44:31] do and do it quickly while you have an
[44:35] opportunity is that right work while it
[44:39] is day for the night cometh but you
[44:42] won't be able to work amen whether that
[44:45] means blindness or whe it means
[44:47] death work while it is day for the night
[44:52] cometh amen when you will not be able to
[44:56] work
[44:57] friends that is God's investment
[45:00] strategy right in front of you praise
[45:03] the Lord but thank God Jesus didn't
[45:05] speak things and leave them he turns
[45:07] around and he interprets his own Parable
[45:11] now in verses 19 9
[45:14] to13 uh Jesus gives us one a
[45:18] purpose a pattern a principle and
[45:23] reveals to us a
[45:25] priority that we ought to path this is
[45:28] what you need to do this is what you
[45:32] want to know about God's management plan
[45:37] first the purpose of God wanting you to
[45:40] [Music]
[45:42] give you've got to understand what is
[45:45] God's purpose Luke
[45:46] 16:9 I tell you use worldly wealth
[45:51] natural
[45:52] money to gain friends for yourself
[45:58] so that when it is
[46:00] gone you will be welcomed into Eternal
[46:05] dwellings does this shock you here this
[46:08] morning oh my use worldly wealth to gain
[46:12] friends so that when you get to heaven
[46:15] they will welcome you in praise God what
[46:20] is he talking about let me go to brother
[46:24] bradle beyond the C
[46:27] of
[46:28] time rejected King also and I heard a
[46:33] voice that spoke to me in the
[46:35] room and it said that this is what you
[46:39] preached was the Holy Ghost this is
[46:42] perfect love and nothing can enter here
[46:45] without it no tiredness no jealousy no
[46:49] death no sickness no mortality none
[46:53] could ever grow old amen none could C it
[46:57] was only joy and I heard the cries oh my
[47:02] precious brother my precious brother and
[47:06] they took me to a high place and I said
[47:08] I must be dreaming I looked back and I
[47:11] saw my body laying there on the bed and
[47:14] here come men and women numbers from
[47:19] both sides in the full bloom of their
[47:21] youth hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[47:26] and here they are screaming all of the
[47:29] bre
