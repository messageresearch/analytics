[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good evening friends very happy that we
[0:19] are back in the house of God I welcome
[0:24] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:28] there it is right behind me as the
[0:34] songwriter says times clock is striking
[0:38] the hour
[0:40] Jesus will soon this end clad in the
[0:45] garments of power the rain of sin to end
[0:51] let us pray father we thank you for this
[0:54] marvelous and wonderful opportunity of
[0:58] coming together in the middle of the
[1:02] week
[1:03] to pause and Lord meditate upon the
[1:08] things of God we pray that you'll bless
[1:12] our time together and made a spirit of
[1:15] God rest upon the word in the name of
[1:19] Jesus Christ we ask your blessing amen
[1:23] and amen
[1:25] I shall read from Genesis chapter 4
[1:29] divine verses 3 to 7 and Joseph said
[1:37] unto his brethren I am Joseph thought my
[1:42] father yet live and his brethren could
[1:47] not answer him for they were troubled at
[1:51] his presence and Joseph said unto his
[1:56] brethren come near unto me I pray you
[2:00] and they came near and he said I am
[2:05] Joseph your brother whom you sold into
[2:10] Egypt
[2:11] now therefore be not grieved or angry
[2:15] with yourselves that you sold me hither
[2:18] for God
[2:19] that sent me before you to preserve life
[2:24] for these two years at the famine beam
[2:28] in the land and yet there are five years
[2:32] in which there shall neither be airing
[2:36] nor harvest and God sent me before you
[2:41] to preserve you a posterity in the earth
[2:46] and to save your lives
[2:49] by a great deliverance fight the Lord
[2:54] Jesus sake the Great God of heaven for
[2:58] the reading of his word
[3:00] now last week to recap I spoke on Joseph
[3:09] the first part of Joseph a type of
[3:12] Christ and in this we showed clearly
[3:19] Joseph's life's journey and how his
[3:23] life's journey types symbolizes and
[3:28] prefigures the light prefigured the life
[3:32] of Christ who came after him we further
[3:39] talked about Joseph and Israel his
[3:41] homeland and how he was treated by his
[3:45] own bredrin his brothers true him in a
[3:49] pit his brothers sold him Joseph to some
[3:57] traders who took him into Egypt and
[4:02] woman there in Egypt he was cast into an
[4:08] Egyptian prison in Egypt while in that
[4:13] prison he met a butcher and the Baker
[4:18] they both had dreams God anointed him he
[4:24] interpreted those dreams one would live
[4:28] the baker and
[4:32] a butcher would die so the Baker was
[4:37] restored to his position later on
[4:41] Pharaoh had a dream while Joseph was
[4:45] still in prison
[4:46] and none of his wise men could interpret
[4:49] this dream but they on the butcher's
[4:53] advice that there is a man in your
[4:55] kingdom that that's able to interpret
[4:58] dreams and of great wisdom and
[5:00] understanding and so Pharaoh sent to
[5:05] procure Joseph out of that prison so I
[5:10] touched on the fact that his life's
[5:13] journey from the pit in Israel his old
[5:20] man to the prison in Egypt and from the
[5:26] prison into Pharaoh's Palace so you
[5:31] remember it that way and it will really
[5:33] help you in the marvelous wonderful way
[5:37] so Pharaoh immediately set for Joseph
[5:40] who came into his presence and told him
[5:43] that wisdom and understanding comes from
[5:46] God and so he has to ask God to give him
[5:50] the interpretation of Pharaoh's dream
[5:54] which he was given it by the God of
[5:57] heaven and hero Joseph interpreted
[6:03] Pharaoh's dream for him and told him
[6:08] about the coming famine the years of
[6:11] plenty and the years of famine and so
[6:16] Pharaoh himself being a wise ruler said
[6:21] who shall I find to administrate to
[6:25] handle this great problem and then he
[6:29] said well to himself and said it loudly
[6:33] to his counselors the best person I
[6:36] believe I can place into the
[6:39] is Joseph the interpreter of the dream
[6:42] for his already proved that he has
[6:44] wisdom and understanding therefore
[6:47] Joseph who was in the prison and should
[6:52] have been taken back to the prison and
[6:54] chains was now exalted and empowered by
[6:59] Pharaoh and placed at his right hand
[7:04] Moses Joseph began to manage all the
[7:08] affairs of the famine and the plenty
[7:11] that was to be in the land and during
[7:13] the course of time Pharaoh
[7:16] granted him his daughter in marriage
[7:21] what a life what a time now we want to
[7:28] move on now and handle this topic of
[7:33] Joseph's meeting his bedroom now we get
[7:39] back to the story finding that my
[7:43] friends dispensational times are
[7:48] changing
[7:49] I mentioned that we are again at the
[7:53] place of the changing from the Gentile
[7:57] dispensation back to the Jews just as
[8:02] much my friends as Joseph turns his
[8:06] attention from his bride that he had
[8:11] married to the presence of his brethren
[8:14] even so God even so the attention of the
[8:20] great Holy Spirit the Lord Jesus Christ
[8:24] Himself slowly turning his attention
[8:28] away from the Gentile bride to his
[8:34] brethren who are now coming into focus
[8:38] coming into power coming into a print in
[8:43] the presence of God where all their
[8:45] needs will
[8:46] met all their needs will be fulfilled
[8:49] great riches will be given to them great
[8:53] mounds of food will be given to them joy
[8:57] in their hearts love upon their lips
[9:00] going back to tell their father of their
[9:03] wonderful fortune in finding their
[9:07] brother Joseph now we recall of course
[9:14] let Joseph requested all the work from
[9:19] before him and ask for his brethren to
[9:23] appear but on their first visit he
[9:28] recognized that one was missing and so
[9:33] he told them go back and all of you must
[9:38] come bring all of the brothers but
[9:41] there's one brother that's missing and
[9:44] make no mistake about it so they went
[9:47] back they entreated their father the
[9:49] father was reluctant Jacob was reluctant
[9:53] to allow his last Benjamin to come on
[10:03] this journey but nevertheless to save
[10:06] posterity to save their lives
[10:10] these brothers returned back with their
[10:14] brother Benjamin and when they brought
[10:20] Benjamin in Joseph couldn't take it
[10:24] anymore and the Bible says he cried out
[10:28] aloud so that the servants of Pharaoh
[10:31] heard him and my friends he he just
[10:38] loved Benjamin who was his full brother
[10:43] thanks be to God even so will it be my
[10:47] friends when Jesus returns and finds his
[10:52] little brother who had kept the
[10:56] commandments of God
[10:57] this little brother who had held to
[11:02] God's unchanging hand who had fulfilled
[11:06] prophecy by going back to Palestine it
[11:10] will set his soul fire to know that
[11:14] these are his own oh what a wonderful
[11:18] day that will be my friends as the song
[11:22] set that says the day of redemption is
[11:26] near men's hearts are feeling fulfilled
[11:29] be filled with the spirit your lamps
[11:32] trimmed trimmed and clear look up your
[11:35] redemption is near yes Jesus is coming
[11:39] soon and he's coming back first to
[11:42] rapture his bride and then return to
[11:45] Israel to reveal himself to his brethren
[11:48] so that they may know him whom they have
[11:52] pierced Oh glory be to God no friends
[11:57] realize little Benjamin is a type of the
[12:04] 144,000 found in Revelation chapter 7
[12:08] verses 1 to 8 in which the Bible tells
[12:13] us clearly that in there under the tribe
[12:18] of Manasseh 12,000 the train of
[12:23] naturally 12,000 the tribe of Ephraim
[12:27] 12,000 the tribe of Judah
[12:29] so these my friends are the wonderful
[12:33] tribes of israel and they are jews they
[12:39] are not Gentiles that they repeat she
[12:43] acted heroically and emphatically this
[12:46] statement is in the Word of God they are
[12:49] of the tribes of Israel they are not
[12:54] Gentiles there are absolutely Jews here
[13:00] called out by God one hundred and
[13:04] 44,000 of them that none deceive you let
[13:09] none take your mind off of the Word of
[13:12] God but recognize clearly what God's
[13:16] Word is saying to you my brothers and
[13:19] sisters thanks be to God hallelujah all
[13:22] those Jews have gone back to Palestine
[13:26] waiting for their intention by the
[13:29] coming Messiah from about Stan God knows
[13:34] them other years and will recognize that
[13:38] wonder 144,000 that have been faithful
[13:43] and true to the Word of God and are
[13:47] standing in Israel who are waiting to
[13:50] receive him their Messiah many of them
[13:54] may not know his name many of them right
[13:57] now may not even believe that Jesus
[14:00] Christ is their Messiah and that's
[14:03] wonderful that's fine for everything
[14:06] there is a time there is a season there
[14:09] is a there is a a Junction as a place
[14:13] and time but the fullness of time the
[14:16] scripture says God sent forth his sons
[14:19] and so my friends there we see the
[14:21] Scriptures the Bible says that when they
[14:25] recognize him they will cry out they
[14:30] were crowd and said whence are you the
[14:34] wounds in your hand and in your feet
[14:37] where did you get these wounds and he
[14:40] said what's pierced you he says oh I've
[14:43] got them in the house of my friends oh
[14:48] my think of it oh what a weeping and
[14:53] wailing think of it when those brothers
[14:57] recognize this was the one we placed in
[15:00] the pit and now here he is in the palace
[15:04] in authority and most of all with power
[15:08] over our lives their fear that would be
[15:12] upon them and they
[15:14] and cried and scream thinking that their
[15:18] lives will be taken from them oh praise
[15:22] God hallelujah my friends but just think
[15:25] of it oh that these wonderful brothers
[15:31] Jewish brothers who wondered the entire
[15:35] world and suffered so much God and His
[15:39] plan is returning them and recalling
[15:43] them back to Palestine back to Israel in
[15:48] the presence of Almighty God just as
[15:51] much as Christian believers a Christian
[15:54] Church that has wandered away from the
[15:58] Word of God the promised land of true
[16:01] believer God's Spirit is calling every
[16:05] true believer back to the word back to
[16:08] the Bible back to your original
[16:11] apostolate
[16:13] listen to the voice of God speaking from
[16:16] his word in these last days and live for
[16:20] his glory and for his honor hallelujah
[16:23] yes my brothers and sisters I tell you
[16:26] here when Jesus comes when he reveals
[16:32] himself to his Jewish brothers and
[16:36] sisters he will reveal to them who he
[16:40] really is
[16:44] Feast of the trumpets to the Jews is as
[16:49] was the opening of the seven seals to us
[16:54] Gentile the fullness of the word
[16:57] breaking upon them by the Holy Spirit
[17:02] for God anointing anointing will be upon
[17:06] that word of God and the scales will
[17:09] fall off their eyes and they will
[17:13] recognize just as Paul being a type of
[17:16] them then recognize who their Messiah is
[17:20] that he is Jesus Christ the Lord
[17:23] oh my
[17:25] my god Lord God Almighty hallelujah or
[17:29] he will reveal himself to them that he
[17:32] is the ultimate lamb and that all the
[17:36] sacrifices they were offering spoke of
[17:40] him and of his coming revelation chapter
[17:47] five and six hope that he was that
[17:50] bloody bleeding man when the voice cried
[17:54] out who will take the book and open the
[17:57] seals thereof that it was him and he
[18:01] would make it known to them that he was
[18:04] not bleeding
[18:06] bloody bleeding lamb oh and bought their
[18:10] Redemption oh your precious blood never
[18:18] loses power till all the ransom Church
[18:22] of God are saved to sin no more oh yes
[18:26] he'll make himself known that he was
[18:30] that is that ultimate Lamb he is the
[18:35] fulfillment of those limbs those limbs
[18:38] were types but he is the substance he is
[18:42] the fulfillment he is the word itself
[18:45] and how that he liked the lamb sacrifice
[18:48] his life now he did it that Calgary and
[18:54] sacrifice his life for us down from his
[18:58] glory of a living story my god and
[19:02] savior came and Jesus was his name all
[19:05] praise God that's what really happened
[19:09] and at that time they were written ice
[19:11] what God has done for them and their
[19:15] families will gouge one family apart and
[19:18] with an agony weep and mourn and they'll
[19:22] get national revival repentance in the
[19:26] presence of great job of a god great
[19:29] Jehovah Jesus don't repent of their sins
[19:32] as a nation and
[19:35] in their fullness back to god no where
[19:40] will the Gentile church be when Joseph
[19:45] our Joseph Jesus will be making himself
[19:49] known to his Jewish brothers and sisters
[19:54] where will the church me the real Bride
[19:58] of Christ will be caught up into the
[20:02] presence of a man God because remember
[20:06] Joseph's wife his brain his Gentile
[20:11] brain and his two children they were in
[20:16] the balance for he had ordered everyone
[20:19] to be out while he reconciled reunited
[20:24] and came into a harmony with his
[20:28] brothers in that wonderful restoration
[20:31] time and so while he was talking to his
[20:37] brother sisters his wife was in the
[20:40] palace so will it be with the Lord Jesus
[20:45] oh what a glorious time that while he is
[20:49] reconciling with his with his brothers
[20:52] and sisters oh praise God
[20:56] they're full of waiting work time when
[21:05] she will be called out by him but
[21:08] meanwhile she will be there in the
[21:11] presence of God while he unites with his
[21:15] brothers won't praise God
[21:17] so the Gentile church will go into the
[21:21] rapture into the ivory palaces the
[21:24] brother she will be taken off of the
[21:27] earth caught up in the air let me stress
[21:31] before the tribulation before I repeat
[21:37] the tribulation the brain the waist of
[21:41] Christ will be caught up out into the
[21:46] presence of God
[21:48] there she'll be three and a half years
[21:53] why the wrath of God like the presence
[21:58] and wrath of God will be poured out
[22:02] while Ross is being poured out on earth
[22:08] we've been whaling she will be in the
[22:14] great wedding supper in the presence and
[22:20] glorious heavenly atmosphere of God so
[22:25] one set will be weeping and wailing but
[22:30] another set will be rejoicing and
[22:34] enjoying the great marriage supper of
[22:38] the Lamb
[22:40] to some it will bring them joy others
[22:44] deep despair oh praise God but the doors
[22:48] of us we look up for we know that our
[22:52] redemption is near
[22:54] what a glorious two lanes praise God the
[22:58] Lord Jesus leaving his bride in his
[23:02] father's house we have asked her before
[23:05] come and go with me to my father's house
[23:09] where there are many mansions and once
[23:12] she is in his father's house in those
[23:16] many mansions he returns back to his
[23:19] brethren and she enjoys her time in the
[23:23] father's house with the marriage supper
[23:26] of the lamb at this time the Antichrist
[23:33] government government will be upon the
[23:36] earth and we want to tell you of this
[23:40] great coming covenant that will take
[23:43] place between the Jewish people in Rome
[23:47] but Rome will absolutely break that
[23:53] covenant and the Jewish people will be
[23:59] so disappointed and as their
[24:02] scientist was betrayed so will the
[24:06] Jewish people be betrayed but one who
[24:11] was so close to them who was so nice to
[24:14] them who was trying to reach out to them
[24:17] will betrayed them and so they this
[24:21] great Empire that time will bring up
[24:26] their troops along with their allies to
[24:29] attack these good god-fearing Jews that
[24:33] are upon the face of the earth for their
[24:37] word of biting their god-fearing
[24:40] god-loving as they come against the city
[24:45] oh my god God Himself my friends will
[24:53] come against them for the Bible says
[24:57] there will appear in the heavens the
[24:59] signs of the coming of the Son of Man
[25:04] yes sir that surely will happen for just
[25:09] as much as Hitler was only a small
[25:13] symbol or type showing that a great evil
[25:19] is to come the Jewish people which we as
[25:24] Christians known as the Antichrist the
[25:27] man of sin the lawless one oh my friends
[25:32] it's coming the Covenant is coming this
[25:36] evil lawless rebellious one is coming
[25:40] this Superman for which the Gentiles
[25:44] Church is looking for to unite them
[25:47] together is coming oh all of this he
[25:52] true Rome will trick the Jews betray
[25:57] them and then begin my friends
[26:00] another tribulation upon them you will
[26:05] see Hitler put them through a
[26:09] troublesome time my friends Oh worse reg
[26:14] Evans
[26:15] timeless yet to come time to repent turn
[26:20] to Jehovah God turn to Jehovah Jesus
[26:24] commitments are it legalized to him and
[26:27] know him in the power of his
[26:30] resurrection yes sir and there it's fine
[26:33] spread as they come by friends against
[26:38] this great city the Son of Man will
[26:41] return to destroy those who are polluted
[26:45] and destroyed the earth revelation 11:18
[26:50] you'll find that my friends so he comes
[26:53] and presents himself fully to that
[26:57] 144,000 oh mighty power being displayed
[27:11] my friends there we burn well but he'll
[27:15] say don't be angry with yourself it's
[27:17] all right
[27:18] God was in all of this list you see for
[27:22] he did it so that I could be here to
[27:26] preserve your lives even so I believe
[27:29] Jesus himself will speak Jesus will
[27:32] speak love and peace to his Jewish
[27:35] brothers and let them know that he loves
[27:38] them cares for them and he came to
[27:41] preserve their life thank God His grace
[27:43] and mercy is what brought the Gentile
[27:46] church true and His grace and mercy will
[27:50] bring our Jewish brothers and sisters
[27:53] true amen why did why did they reject
[27:56] Jesus anyway maybe they're rejected him
[27:59] because God he was in it it was the only
[28:07] way that he could get Jesus to come like
[28:11] Joseph had to go to Egypt Jesus
[28:13] continued so that he could take a gentle
[28:16] bride so he died on the cross to
[28:21] preserve the life of the Gentile church
[28:24] think of it now these hundred
[28:27] and four to four thousand I'm not in the
[28:31] brain there are not a part of the wife
[28:34] of Christ they are Jews as I have said
[28:38] yes sir
[28:40] here they are the scripture says they
[28:43] follow the lamb that means they follow
[28:46] the word that means they recognize him
[28:50] the couple of their blindness and they
[28:54] recognize him
[28:55] they follow the lamb whithersoever equip
[28:58] and they have not defiled themselves
[29:01] with women showing that they are eunuchs
[29:05] unto God their spiritual attendance
[29:10] their intended by God to be spiritual
[29:13] attendance to his wife his bride and so
[29:18] they are in character by the Holy Spirit
[29:22] so these eunuchs keepers of the bridal
[29:27] chambers attendants they do not sit on
[29:31] the throne but they are before and by
[29:35] the truth they are not in the bride but
[29:39] yet they are included in his glorious
[29:43] millennial reign that is to come then we
[29:47] see friends but these lasts of Israel
[29:52] are joined to the Lord in great love for
[29:57] him at that time the enemies of the Lord
[30:01] and of his Christ are being destroyed
[30:03] and God begins to prepare his holy
[30:07] mountain his new Garden of Eden and
[30:11] there we find the brain and her
[30:15] attendants for the thousand years
[30:17] honeymoon which will be on the earth for
[30:21] the wedding took place on earth the
[30:24] honeymoon takes place in heaven and then
[30:29] the marriage supper takes place in
[30:32] heaven and then the honeymoon takes
[30:35] place on earth because he comes back
[30:38] with her right
[30:40] word on the horse and his name shall be
[30:44] called the Word of God and the honeymoon
[30:46] takes place here upon the earth now
[30:50] friends it's marvelous and wonderful
[30:53] know that our Lord Jesus the last Adam
[30:57] and his Eve his bright church by friends
[31:02] will walk in God's holy mountain and
[31:06] fulfill scripture for this Adam this eve
[31:11] will not fall but stand by the fullness
[31:15] of the word now I want to bring your
[31:18] attention as I'm about to close you
[31:23] recall that Joseph stood before his
[31:25] bredrin and when Benjamin was not yet
[31:31] with them but he stood before his
[31:34] bedroom and the Bible tells us that he
[31:37] spoke to them through an interpreter
[31:43] amen now why did he do that
[31:48] Juke Joseph knew Hebrew for he was a
[31:52] Hebrew but yet he hid himself for a
[31:56] while and before the unveiling of the
[32:01] mighty God before unveiling or revealing
[32:05] himself to them just before he did that
[32:09] he spoke in them to them in tongues
[32:13] he spoke to them in an unknown tongue
[32:17] which they could not understand no did
[32:23] you do you realize that at the first
[32:27] part of the Gentile age or the Gentile
[32:31] dispensation which my friends is in line
[32:34] with Daniels head of gold that great
[32:38] Babylonian age and time ended with a
[32:42] message at the feast of Belshazzar with
[32:46] thousands of his Lord with all of the
[32:50] partying and all of the feasting and all
[32:53] of that great wonderful time of
[32:56] prosperity and and safety that they
[33:01] thought they were enjoying while they
[33:04] were in the middle of all of it suddenly
[33:07] in the middle of it
[33:08] silence struck that hall for the Bible
[33:13] says dear that hand of man
[33:16] supernaturally writing words up on the
[33:20] wall meant amendment
[33:23] taking your first sin you are weighed in
[33:26] the balances and you are found one thing
[33:30] yes my friends so is that even our day
[33:34] while our world was on but it's madness
[33:38] and it's folly of this age in which we
[33:41] are in believing that we are safe
[33:44] because of our arms because of our
[33:46] military might we do not recognize that
[33:50] there's a God in heaven that rules over
[33:53] all and he sets up kings and brings down
[33:57] Kings this is the mighty God that we
[33:59] serve and again we see a proliferation
[34:03] of tongues speaking o friend our Joseph
[34:20] is fixing to appear again upon the scene
[34:24] but this time he is coming to take his
[34:27] bride away
[34:28] and then after which he returned work
[34:31] and begin to close out his little
[34:35] brother
[34:36] Oh little Benjamin that 144,000 that
[34:41] have been faithful to him well my
[34:44] friends this speaking in tongues it's
[34:47] not just the sign of the fullness of
[34:50] God's blessing it's also a sign that
[34:54] ichabod is written across the doorposts
[34:58] also my friends that the glory is
[35:02] departed the Spirit of God
[35:05] leaving the Gentile world and returning
[35:08] back to our Jewish brothers the Gentile
[35:11] churches the Gentile dispensation is now
[35:16] at its ending but take God Jesus is
[35:21] coming those who are held to God's
