of fire will touch the prophet amen and the word of God will go forth and the Spirit of the Living God will be glorified that is what we are here for uh we can communion and fellowship after the service but we are here to find some passage way that we can enter into his divine presence not just to come to church but when you're in here together with others you find a way to press yourself in to the presence of Al Mighty God so I'm asking today that as the word of God goes forth and your spirit deep calling to the deep that the holy spirit will respond to you and you will respond to him and together we can give him glory honor and praise God bless you sisters thank you so much amen God bless you sisters amen God bless you brother Paul glad you're back praise God God bless you sister your mom was on my heart all week praying for her and looking to the Lord amen God bless every one of you here in the house of God those that are not uh present are out there somewhere in the world God will protect them and bring them safely back to us again our older Believers that physically you know uh they're not capable of moving like they used to before and one day you'll get that way but uh if the Rapture permits but uh meanwhile we have to think about them too so some of them may be watching online right now I want them to know that we remember them can you say an amen am we're thinking about them amen and pray that the spirit of God will uh uh just uh confirm the word to them as much uh as he does to us that they will have the same reaction whether they're in their living room on their bed in their bedroom because of pain illness whatever uh it's that time of life they're free to do whatever they want as long as they're serving God and giving him their whole heart we pray God will bless us all together God bless you we'll turn give our first text up there I believe it's in Genesis 21 9 to 10 praise the Lord and shall we read the scripture and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had born unto Abraham mocking wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out this Bond woman and her son for the son of this Bond woman shall not be air with my son even Isaac amen praise the Lord God bless you our gracious father as we taught on these things and as the Holy Spirit just brought the Simplicity of it we pray that the holy spirit will bless us up and raise us up from being Earthbound like like the Hawks and the other rabbits but to be real eagles of God with sharp eyes and oh God Discerning of Hebrews 4:12 the spirit of Christ resting upon us living in us and may you be glorified in all this for we ask it in Jesus name praise the Lord God bless you please be seated the topic today is the shock will not inherit with the seed now if you will no this brother brenham's message it was the seed will not be air with the shock and he was correct because uh he was actually referring that the real seed is not in Pentecostal they're not going to take the Pentecostal message in other words those that died Faithfully in Pentecost they will inherit that inheritance that they had over there which is to be part of the Bride but not in this they're not going to be here so back then he had to say say it that the the seed will not be air with the shock that's right right but now we are in this day and we are saying it how we see it from the word that is the shock or the husk will not inherit the Kingdom with the seed they they have no place in it they can't see it they don't know how to enter it how are they going to be a part of it they can't be a part of it now let's that's just so you understand what direction I am going in with all that will be said praise the Lord and we look to the leodan church Age first of all a if you are still in any doubt about this ask God by his Spirit to fill you and Lead You for the elect can't be fooled do you believe that right I'm talking about the true elect I'm not talking about you think or you call yourself or you imagine but when you know that you have entered the king's chamber when you know you have stepped Beyond the Veil of this word when you know that you recognize him and he recognizes you and he is responding back to you as you live for him then you're in a different realm all together and you can't be fooled yes I'm telling you it's impossible when you become and you recognize not become in the sense of you know now going to become like it says you shall become the sons of God it's not meaning that you now become the sons of God but I want you to see this you can't be fooled why because the Christ lives in you the spirit of God lives in you how are you going to be fooled now not to say because of your flesh you may be temporarily thrown off balance because of your flesh but that spirit that is in you is going to show you right then or later or in the night or the next day he's going to make it clear clear to you that you will recognize you can't be fooled Hallelujah so don't let the devil put a spirit of fear upon you that you're going to hear something from somebody that's going to deceive you or lead you off this way or in that direction you can't be deceived praise God can can God be deceived about himself of who he is well oh my think about it so the elect there isn't any man can fool you Paul could not fool the elect had he been wrong and in the first Ephesian AG the elect there could not be fooled for they tried the false Apostles and Prophets and found them to be Liars and put them out Hallelujah his sheep hear his voice and they follow him praise God careful brother Simon remember those are our Brethren and you're talking about putting them out you you you're tough your hard you're talking about uh you know just let not come back here to this church go somewhere else but not here you're a little too tough no but it's in the word they tried by the word and found that there were Liars we didn't know there were Liars before but when our eyes got opened when we got the Revelation then these Giants begin to look like they were small they were Liars for who they are they try to make themselves Great Men great uh great images in in the messes great images in the world and we realize no oh oh boo down boo down boo P nothing nothing behind them because we are standing on the word of the Living God hallelujah we are the sons of God we are the children of God you are Daughters of God and sons of God walking in the light of this day praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord amen now thinking man's filter Israel was all outwardly spiritual he says spiritually but he means spiritual all filled with God's goodness like the Pentecostals today claim they're filled with the spirit of God and some of them really live holy lives they live really live decent clean nice beautiful people but God is not looking at how beautiful you are outside God is Not Looking how how holy you dress outside of course that's important but God is not he's looking to see search for his sons and his daughters and see the seeds in his heart you you can fool me 100% of the time that you are here on Earth but when you get to glory god knows your heart you're not hiding from anybody right you you're just hiding from man you're not hiding from God you commit all kind of vile acts all kind of wicked things and then turn around call yourself a Son of God call yourself a child of God God knows all about it you can't hide it from him amen praise God in the book of his remembrance it's all written down and when the books are open they'll come right up before you where you can't deny it amen if man has tape recorders that can show you your from years ago and give you films of what you were doing God has better than that amen he knows your very thoughts the prophet said even your thoughts are heard louder in heaven amen the thoughts of your heart are heard louder in heaven than your words that you're talking about amen now notice filled with God's goodness they reverence God but that didn't work inside of them could not recognize the word itself they couldn't recognize the word itself and right there and then they absolutely put themselves out you see before we put them out they put themselves out because they can't recognize the word of God but when you are born of the spirit of God then you are a son of God you always was a Son of God Amen and you always will be a Son of God do you believe that and no way to separate it because you have eternal life and eternal never did begin you believe that am Eternal never did begin so you see Pentecost not just Pentecostal all the churches out there believe telling the people and teaching them they were saved on a certain day that's the day when you got eternal life it's when you got saved on a day and they right then contradict themselves by by saying that because you are now saying Eternal is not really Eternal because Eternal has no beginning it has no ending it's a big circle and it keeps going and going and going and going and it can never end amen amen so we see then that we have eternal life all for the grace of God that he would give us understanding of such mystery that's Grace you know brother Tim that's Grace that you can understand what you're understanding now you can't get it in a school they can't teach you it by Logic by the the theologic or theologians or they can't teach you by any of those Sciences this can only come by Revelation through the opening of The Eyes Of Your Heart the spirit of the Living God deciding your day your time your hour and make himself known to you other than that you'll sit right there amen may my my my listen my daughter had a dog the dog is dead now we all mourned for the dog and everything else but uh and truly we felt very sad but she had a a whistle and uh she used that whistle and the dog will raise his head up but when she blew the whistle I heard nothing is that something I heard nothing and the scientist said that's because the dogs hearing is so sensitive it's on such a higher dimension of hearing that when you blow the whistle yes you don't hear any sound but the all of a sudden all the dogs turn around and then that particular one that's yours they know that you're really calling for and they run to you well that's just a little human example of what the preaching of the words is doing now I'm standing here I preaching all of you sitting here everybody hearing my voice but the word that's going forth from within me is only coming to the elected ears of your heart only the elected ears those with elected ears amen you can understand with your head but we're not talking about that amen praise God we're not talking about intelligence amen praise God because you have human intelligence you have Supernatural intelligence you got two kinds of knowledge knowledge accumulated Knowledge from Human Experience books learning that you only can embe or take into your body or your being with your through your five senses there's no other way you take it into three of five senses but there is a six sense there is another way a second way of knowledge that's given only by God through the super sense through the revelation of the word that'll strike your soul amen you know if you really ever had a real Vision or a real uh dream where God reveals himself you'll understand that God will only speak one word you might just say go but within that go right what you hear is just go but what I hear when he says go I see the place where he want me to go I know what he want me to do when I get to that place all of that and much more than that wrapped up in one word go you understand Revelation is like that God just say one thing and a whole world opens up praise be to God hallelujah amen let me give you another example under the Pentecost Holy Spirit fell everybody ran out their doors and the disciples staggering out on the street hallelujah amen my God and he said what does this all mean amen oh praise God you know Peter answered them this is that praise God and he spoke the word of God and the Bible say said and they all heard it are not these people speaking Galilean what is the supernatural miracle that one from capid doia one from Asia one from this place one from the other place all around the world but all of us are hearing and understanding we understanding at the same time you see God only speaks one word and every race and Nation Under the Sun will understand it he doesn't have to go learning having language skills he's the author he's the Creator so when he speaks the word whoever they are they hear the word amen they don't care about nothing else they are hearing the truth they're hearing the word of God going forth praise God forever more hallelujah amen praise God now we see this that we have eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord God hallelujah thanks be to God God let me move on here before we get into something here amen amen yes sir now notice carefully in the word of God here the word cannot deny itself amen I have heard but now I see amen now because down in your soul there was a pred destinated seed which was eternal life you heard what the seed was and is what the seed is eternal life is in you you you didn't come at the altar and ask God now give me eternal life but the gift of God is eternal life and he already gave you eternal life that it could reside in your spirit and the habitation of God is now in men and with men and he lives in US moves in us has his being in us we become his Temple of the Holy Ghost because God lives in us hallelujah Solomon said I'll build you a house he said I'll build my own house amen the temple passed away the temple is broken down I went to Jerusalem and see the great Stones all on the ground all around but it wasn't just that Temple he was speaking about the heavens of Heavens he says can't contain me he says they can't hold me I'll build my own house and his house was what his house is an eternal house his house is an indestructible house amen praise be to God hallelujah amen I'm just holding that I don't go off on tangents here but see now down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying there always was in there and all that the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them are as going to be lost Hallelujah you believe that am is anybody here going to be lost raise your hand oh I almost caught one couple of you no nobody that a real child of God can ever be lost you can't be lost because you are his sons and his daughters and you're walking in his grace amen praise the Lord God thank you Jesus oh praise God uh that's from the thinking man's filter sorry brother yes amen now when any thinking man hears the word of of God my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow why down in there is life and life connects with life is the same thing as saying the Deep calls to the Deep life connects with life well in other words life is not going to go somewhere to fall on something or someone where there is no life in there that it can germinate or wake up again bring to life again you see a person can't be borned again they can't be borned again if they didn't have some birth somewhere before right see that's why Jesus said how can a man go up up to heaven if he at first didn't come down from heaven no man can go back into heaven if he didn't come from there amen so we are not really from here when I say we not your flesh but the soul that's inside you're not from here that Paul said we are aliens we are strangers we are not from here oh your flesh was born in this country that country yes that's this man but that man inside is a Heavenly being amen he's Timeless amen I said You're Timeless your eternity you come from God and you're going back to God your father is really God he just used an Earthly man and a mother to produce a manifestation of Flesh that your soul can live in while it's here on Earth to serve its life's purpose and fulfill its mission that the father has placed within your life and within your heart amen I believe it it's the word of God praise God do you believe it oh praise God forever more amen yes sir I tell you this is truly the word that we are living by here in in this day and in this hour praise God look if I stumble around and go around like that it's because I'm going in and out and I'm just moving just the way that God wants me to move praise the Lord here now understand clearly amen praise the Lord that this word of God connects only with life in other words remember when Jesus went down in the water and when he came up what happens you see a dove coming down from the heavens and lighting upon him which we know that was the Holy Spirit coming down upon him we won't talk about the trinitarians having a problem with that uh uh saying how can it be one God when there is one coming from the heavens one sitting in the water and then I Heard a Voice so it's three as if God can't be in a million places at the same time and still be God he's answering prayers around the world right now while we're speaking by the millions and he's still one God he's healing people he's doing everything and he's still one God and adopted the Babylonian system of trinitarian ISM which was not is not even in the Bible and they triy to explain it as much as they can like he's a bunch of grapes and mocking him blaspheming against him he's like light he's like grapes he's like this three of that and three of that but there's only one God and his name is Jesus Christ amen Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new that Jehovah eternal spirit made a flesh body through a virgin brought it to birth amen and lived in that body that's why Jesus could say my father that dwelleth in me he do the works I and my father are one not three and one sat on the throne Revelation 5 amen one not three John said I looked and I saw one amen there's only one God hero Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord there's no other God beside me behind me before me only I Stand Alone amen the true and the Living God he is the one that we serve amen praise God hallelujah yes sir I certainly believe that life connects with life praise God what's the use the Holy Spirit falling on a piece of stone or brick you think that's going to come to life no he's going where we know there's a seed hidden under the dirt that's dirt you know but there's a soul there is a life there's a seed hidden under there the in individual might not have known it but all of a sudden the time comes for their Awakening the Holy Spirit strikes the seed and the Waters of Life begin to flow over it it begins to germinate and wake up and become its true self of who it should be amen praise the name of the Lord yes sir notice the Ephesian Church age the word of God is forever settled in heaven before one Speck of Stardust was made that word amen was there as it is written exactly in our Bible amen it was already there praise God I believe that praise God forever more the word of God is settled forever in heaven and it was already there praise God forever more Hallelujah yes yes sir now we we'll go over to the Smyrna Church age Hallelujah now what I want to bring to you here you'll see here in this quote now back then before there was ever a spec of Stardust before God was God for God is an object of washing and there was nobody to worship him that's we talking about before he even made Angels or anything he was there alone and there was nothing to worship him so he was not even God or known as God as yet until he made a creation that could worship him then he would be acknowledged and known as God right oh now so he was at the time only potentially God and he was known only as the eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind amen we were already in his mind way back in the eternities we were in his mind we were in his thoughts for he is the Eternal God and before he made any anything we were in his mind hallelujah amen yes she was there she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not hallelujah praise God forever more they're Eternal yes sir oh isn't that wonderful Proverbs chapter 8 I think it's from verse uh uh 21 to or 22 to 32 if you have can you find pull that up for me brother that's a note I just left home with the scriptures that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and I will fill their Treasures the Lord now this begins to speak of Jesus Christ and also it's speaking of you and I the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways before his works of old before he done anything just like we just said to you the Lord already owned you he already possessed you he already possessed his bride she was already in him listen this is scripture now this this is not even a quotation listen to the scripture not that there's much difference but listen I was set up oh my I don't want to preach on that I said you were set up God set you up brother sister amen amen before the fall you were set up you were set up for salvation you were set up for Redemption you were set up by the grace of God to meet your Redeemer and to walk in Redemption praise the name of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir I was set up from when from Everlasting from the beginning orever the Earth was when there were no depths I was brought forth remember I'm saying it's speaking about you and it's speaking about Jesus Christ in the largest sense amen right I was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth while as yet he had not made the Earth you were there I said said you were there you are in him before the foundations of the world it's right in your Bible amen while as yet he had not made the Earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the D dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he created the heavens I was there can you say that there Hallelujah say I was there I was there you may not be conscious that you were there because you're suffering from spiritual Amnesia sin of Adam and Eve in the garden brought you to a place where you suffer from spiritual Amnesia and only by the opening of the light of the scriptures you are slowly recapturing your original thoughts amen and recognizing as the word takes you back to familiar places take you back to familiar associations take you back to familiar smells and sounds and everything else you begin to recognize that it's me Mama it's me I know who I am now I recognize who I am you begin to see yourself within the word of God hallelujah please don't tell me don't get excited brother Simon you're too old you shouldn't be shouting that loud and you shouldn't be jumping that high but let me tell you if I could jump out of the skin and jump right into Glory I'll do it for his praise and honor and glory amen thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah amen let's continue oh my when he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then I was there I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight every day I was rejoicing always before him Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord L hallelujah what does telling you God was already having fellowship with his bride before the foundations of the world Amen I was rejoicing every day we were before the throne every day we were worshiping and praising his name that is why God turned around and said to job job see if you can remember amen see if you can remember when the morning Stars sign together and them sons of God was shouting for Joy amen you see we can now say I was there Hallelujah I was there when the Sons and Daughters of God were shouting for Joy but God just wanted to shake job out of his spiritual Amnesia to begin to recognize who he really is you are not a man of Earth alone you are in flesh you were born in flesh so you are a man but really on the inside of you you are an eternal being that was made manifested in flesh and because you come from God you're going back to God oh praise God forever more yes sir I believe every Jew drop has to go back where it come from because the s o n or the sun will pull it right back where it's supposed to be hallelujah amen hallelujah and I believe that magnet that great magnet of the Holy Ghost is right here right now well pull your heart pull your soul pull your spirit take your back in the presence of almighty God Amen praise God we're not just here to preach words amen but we're here to demonstrate the holy spirit that the Holy Spirit not on the Pentecost but to demonstrate the spirit for this hour that will reveal the word that will open the word in a supernatural way where you hear the same Bible but yet you're hearing something else you you you read the same verses but you're hearing something else what is that praise God it's the Holy Spirit taking a word and trying to individualize it break it down and bring it to you for what your needs are amen see God could speak to a million people all at the same time and each one can get something different because he's God doesn't make any difference so praise the Lord so receive your portion here today from out of the word of God Amen hallelujah amen so thank God isn't that wonderful that's why I love the oldtime religion how many loves the old time religion we have a new time religion now with all kinds of you know uh beautiful presentations and promotions and beautiful music everything else stars of the Christian so-called stars of the Christian uh uh culture and everything else entertaining and everything El but these people don't understand if they read the book of Ezekiel that Satan who was then known as Lucifer was the worship leader and the choir master in heaven he was called a lightbearer in heaven right but he didn't have a revelation that's what made him satanic right he tried to supersede his creator think of you made this bench and the bench trying to tell you that he's better than you it has more sense than you anything else God says I make it I can break it and make it all over again you come telling me about what you know so he was kicked out of heaven God just kick him out of Heaven that's what you got to do with the devil kick him out your life don't just take any lie he's going to tell you don't take any kind of s h things you go and in these particular days he's trying to bring a spirit of fear more fear I've seen and heard even on the TV fear on you you maybe you can get this disease you know maybe this already working in you maybe that's that pain you felt it could be this it could be that once you real enter the realm of could and maybe and it can be this it can you can anything can be told to you right the word of God truth remains truth truth does not divert change move or accommodate anybody it stands as the original word of God hallelujah and it cannot it will not for I am the Lord I change not he cannot lie he cannot change he is the Eternal God one and only the Mighty God they Our Redeemer I love him I praise him I give him glory and honor hallelujah amen so we come from the background of the oldtime religion H and the alltime religion didn't start in 3:25 ad it did not start a thousand years ago this one started listen right in the Bible tells you there there were shouting and singing in the presence of almighty God and praising him and glorifying him amen oh and that same religion comes back in the Book of Revelation said I saw a mighty multitude there were raising their hands they were shouting they were praising God I don't feel strange when I'm in church and I suddenly feel like shouting you go to some Churches and if you say Amen a little too loud everybody looks around to see it's who you know but in here we don't have that amen you feel like shouting your shout hallelujah don't care about nobody else God wants to bless you as an individual in the service don't come to me after the service like some people have done in the past you know brother Simon while you were preaching and the Word was going forth I felt so blessed I said I tell you I felt like shouting you know I said well why didn't you shout you should have shouted it would have been a blessing to others to know that somebody amongst us is getting blessed somebody is getting blessed yes somebody receiving something praise be to God hallelujah what do you think we here for praise God your natural life you're here to shake off all your inhibitions all your fears all your your all your repressions and everything else that's in you it's giving you mental stability and at the same time giving you spiritually strengthening you in the grace of almighty God so if you want to come in here you don't have like I said before you don't need to go to a psychiatrist and sit there and have him you pay $300 to tell you uh lay on the lay on the couch raise your hands and your feet up like if you're a little baby and scream the Primal scream of a child you don't need that you come in the house of God you hear the word preach you're happy you praise God hallelujah come on praise God this Queen Elizabeth stuff praise the Lord what what we here for we not here to praise God like that you it's almost as if God should feel the privilege of my raising my hand to praise him no we have the privilege of being called the Sons and Daughters of the Living God and we are here to praise God hallelujah amen yes sir praise God oh my goodness I come in the house of God I pray that the Holy Spirit Will Empower me and Empower you Empower me to preach and Empower you to worship Amen Let The Deep call back to the Deep amen and let the Deep respond amen if there's any deep in you and you're not the bottomless spit amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah yes sir so shouting in nothing strange to us brother Desmond shouting in church praising God in church that's nothing strange to us we we we felt comfortable with it up there we comfortable with it down here and we feel comfortable when we go back there again amen because it's just part of our our whole system Amen to praise God hallelujah you're driving out your driveway and you say oh praise God father I know I can count on your protection your safety your guidance amen amen hallelujah you your your food is cooked it's on the table you just bow your head you may not even bow your head but you may say prayer oh God thank you for the fruits of the feast the meat that you provide Lord God hallelujah praise be to God give him the glory and the honor and praise for every aspect of your life amen thank you Jesus hallelujah amen amen amen praise God forever more yes sir now notice he is not he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel with himself now nor is he any time adding to his knowledge he cannot add to his knowledge then he is not omnicient praise the name of the Lord the best we could say is that some sometimes he will be but that is not scriptural he is omnicient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had you understand Hallelujah God has always had his original thoughts in him and no other new thought is going to be added on Amen praise God oh what's that old song I love I used to sing back in Pentecost there's a new name written down in glory and it's mine thank God it's mine there is no new name written down in glory it was not written there it will never be there we sang the old sanki songs that used to say is my name written there on the page white and fair in the book of thy kingdom is my name written there and the old the other church that was opposing to that particular Church they sang back a song no not one no not one well you see we find now they all come down Through the Ages they each had a level of revelation that was right but other things that were not right and they didn't understand us yet until the word has come to its perfection in this day with the opening of the the seven seal with the sounding of the seven Thunders the breaking of the word he who WS the Key of David I open and no man shut and when I shut no man opens and the key of God's word is the holy spirit has come to open up the word and no Theologian can open up your understanding by by theological teaching by all the Sciences of theology they can't do it my God like friends I spent three years and there at the end of it when the spirit began to break the word I began to ask questions and that man bowed his head in tears but not tears of repentance or tears of sorrow but tears of anger if you could tear me limb from limb and then wrote me and wrote give me that letter and said don't come back don't bother coming back you were asking too many hard questions and hard saying like that but what is it I said but is it the word is it in the Bible Well it's in the Bible but it's different from our faith I say well thank you very much it's different from your faith that's all I need to know but in the word the word says it all it's right here in your Bible it's thus sayeth the Lord it's in the word of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir that's the truth yes sir he is is omnicient now those thoughts of God are Eternal they are real praise the Lord God I thank God for that that God's thoughts were not like man's thoughts they're just like you can think something now you forget the next day and then it's not a reality to you anymore but God's thoughts are real he sees them from beginning to end in other words he saw he had you there as a thought but he also know you like we knew Jeremiah I know you before you were even in your mother's womb I I don't only know you as a thought back there I even saw you right through your whole life that you're supposed to be a prophet you're supposed to do this you're supposed to do that the steps of a righteous man is Ed ordained of the Lord God knows our lives he knows the path of life for every one of us and the spirit of Christ is here to lead us and guide us right into our path of life that we might walk with him and talk with him have fellowship with him you can read some of these quotes I would't read them all here amen praise God but we understand that this God is a mighty God and he wanted to display himself to us and for us to recognize him for who he is and also to recognize ourselves for who we are amen now at the ending of that quotation listen what it says Adam gives you the idea about the thoughts that was in his mind and the thought was eternal and had to be expressed so when Adam was formed of the Dust of the earth and a spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thought expressed those Eternal thoughts were now manifested manifested where in flesh now you can see them but being in flesh doesn't mean they were not there before they manifest to your senses and your being an eternal child of God did not begin when you the day you were born and you become manifest in flesh you always was with God for you and him are one you are not God but you are part of him because he is your father and you have his image stamped within your heart that your nature and your your entire being is growing in His image that you might walk in his light and in his life amen praise God now God saw the real Adam and he saw ra you and me when he said uh let us make man let us make man now that's not a thing brother but praise the Lord let us make man of course we know that's not the trinitarians want to take that and twist it to say that was was three Gods talking to themselves and and saying let us make man but it's simple though we understand it the bride was already with him he's talking with his wife they're having a conversation let us make man and let's make body for ourselves he make one name Jesus Christ and the other one the other one is a many membered body the other way praise God but then we see it manifested now you know so many things passing through my thoughts right now I'm just picking here and grabbing there so if I seem that's why I said if I seem like I'm scrambling you make some sense out of it amen you know the TR word of God is truly Rich amen amen amen and it don't become rich by study oh I studied for 40 hours oh I fasted all week I fasted three days that's good if God tell you to do it but that's not what gives you it it just puts you in a condition to receive it that's all it does it puts you in a condition that you might receive something from the presence of the Living God now we coming back to it so we see God let said let us make man amen and when he said let us make man I'm making this short now we end up now in a flesh body right and we would have been in that flesh body with no interruptions no problem that's where Satan's sin and suffering tests trials tribulation comes into view Satan interrupted God's program right interrupted God's program he can't destroy those supernatural beings that God sent here down Through the Ages but he can make hell for them on Earth make their life like hell and that tells them when the devil is so interested in you that he's bring so much trouble you know that there's something living in you that he hates there's something living in you that he hates he can't stand it amen and it's God that's living in you even though you don't know it for let me tell you rep you see gifts and callings are without repentance before the person even repent or become a Believer or a Christian they realize there is something going on in their life but they can't explain it they don't know what it is but it's they don't really until the word begins to open it's God was working on us all the time amen God working in our hearts in our lives all the time Jesus SC went to the scripture and he said in my father's house many mansions if it were not so I would have told you amen my father's house God himself being the house and inside of that house you end up having many small rooms and you say Mansions you know you are a mansion you are a house you your body is a house you see so in my father's house there were many mansions amen in Christ we were all in him we're all in him and in Christ there's a whole lot of True Believers in Christ not the man back there but that spirit of God Eternal being that was in him this great Eternal Elohim we were all in him praise God we just expressed as human beings in this flesh aliens strangers this world is not our home we're just a passing through we're passing through and we're going back where we come from oh praise be to God forever more Hallelujah yes sir amen certainly that's the word of God many mansions many bodies many temples amen praise the name of the Lord God you see God was already seeing himself as becoming material as becoming material and making a body coming into a body that's what they don't understand that Jesus Christ and God the father is not two different beings for the God the Father the eternal spirit created a body for himself is that right and he did that using a vessel called Mary that is why she could not have any association with a natural man because God himself sent an angel to speak the word and said You shall bear a son that word was God's germ God's seed God's life that was planted in her womb by the spoken word of God and that word that word came to life so Jesus Christ was brought to life not by the hand of the instrumentality of a man but by the word of God that's why he was pure holy sinless Untouchable praise God he said you find no fault in me you can't find any he was a lamb without spot and without blemish oh praise God he Perfection of all Perfections for God God was in Christ reconciling the world to somebody else himself God was reconciling the world himself praise God forever more thank you Lord hallelujah amen God the word was multiplying himself you know all those scriptures where Jesus said don't you understand the son of man must fall in the ground so that I can come back up and be multiplied thousandfold and so many fold it was God trying to tell you this is the way I'm I'm using this way to multiply myself praise God let me repeat here again this is not saying that you are you are God we are just little pieces of him Jesus himself said you are common g o DS you are common gods in other words you love all the all the traits the family traits the family actions you'll have it all in you because you can't help it because he lives in you amen praise God hallelujah just said that in passing at that time praise God so God typed this all in Adam before Adam was even flesh t a little bit on this before while Adam was yet a spirit being Genesis I believe that's uh uh one or two somewhere in Genesis uh you'll find that I don't have that here praise God somewhere I left it home but anyway we find out God's God created Adam and he told Adam uh I want you to go multiply reproduce multiply replenish the Earth but then we find out that Adam was still only a spirit man he didn't have a body as yet to do any of those things that is why you will go and see if this mentions a second time in Genesis 2 and God created man from the dust of the earth now this is the physical body now for that Spirit man to come and live in right see and that was made because he couldn't till the soil as a spirit being he couldn't do all those things so so then this body was made he could come living living that body praise God and when Adam came and lived in that body Adam came with his wife already in him right so really God is displaying to us his plan of what he done what he did amen that's how he chose to display it so that Adam's wife was in him right and when the time was he says Adam he says it's not good for a man to be alone he's telling you that he was there in the eternity all by himself alone and just dealing with his thoughts and so just like Adam's wife could not be a goat a horse a donkey a monkey a pirate it has to be a being on the same level as he is is that right so God took Adam took Eve from out of Adam's side she was not made with some other element or some other part but she and him were one and Jesus said I and my father are one and when you realize you are part of that eternal spirit I'm just a little part of that eternal spirit has shown on the day of Pentecost with the little pillars of Fire coming upon them there NE none of them are the original big Pillar of Fire that is the whole big house but each one had a little flame of that pillar fire in them praise God oh my and they can say I and my father are one I and my father are one I'm just Eternal as my father is eternal amen I walk with him I talk with him praise God and I commune with him I pray I fellowship and I talk with him in the quietness praise the name of the Lord oh blessed quietness blessed quietness praise God so here was Adam's wife in him and then with his wife in him he says now multiply Yourself Praise the Lord hallelujah praise God isn't don't we serve a wonderful God Amen Hallelujah I'm talking to you I'm watching the clock but at the same time I'm trying to get as much as I can out to you before I step down here praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah yes sir Genesis 1: 26-28 that's where you're going to read where Adam was just a spirit being right Genesis 2:7 verse 7 and verse1 15 you find that that's where God created him with a physical body for him to live in so he could tell the soil and also he could multiply himself praise the Lord hallelujah praise God you believe what you're hearing so far I I go too far out on the world and you're going to start maybe thinking you're losing your mind because uh theologians have been telling us all kinds of things from the scriptures for so long and here you come with all this stuff you know where you getting this from then we said well um I'm getting it from by Revelation from the holy spirit because God sent a prophet seven sent a seventh angel to open up the word of God and but that word of God was just a um like you're going for a swim and what you call that board that you jump off of um springing spring board it it's just like a spring board that's what the prophet's message has been a springboard it's just like the mother Eagle kicking you out the nest and say okay You' seen all these things but you better go out there and do your own flying I can't fly for you anymore you got to fly for yourself praise God and you're going to experience everything I experience but you got to fly for your yourself you can't live off of my experience you got to get your own by going out there and flying yourself amen praise the name of the Lord God hallelujah amen yes sir how wonderful to know amen now first John the first chapter praise God forever more it's written now in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and all of the word was made flesh all wasn't made Flesh on the same day but down Through the Ages God knows your times God knows the season God knows the age you're supposed to come up in and they were made flesh but they were back there as Spiritual Beings in him praise the name of the Lord God of course if you don't understand all of this go back and listen the message again and I'm telling you that it will be a real blessing to to your heart amen praise God so we find out God wanted to reproduce himself he want to in other words this is talking about the multiplication of the word God wanted to multiply the word like I mentioned before Jesus talking about the seed going in the ground it's all the same thing trying to tell you God had this intent or intention to multiply himself praise God Hallelujah and to come into material bodies the first body that God made that way of course uh was Jesus Christ amen and he was God's super God's Masterpiece amen and the bride coming from him she is his Masterpiece amen because she comes from him praise the name of the Lord because God's bride was in him Adam comes his wife was in him Jesus comes his wife was in him Adam was put to sleep his wife was brought to taken out from him Jesus on Calvary he was struck Jehovah struck him and there it was his wife was brought forth from him praise God hallelujah but because you see two beings standing there Adam and Eve go back the scripture says but he he called their name Adam one name and you can have a million billion Christians in the world and he called their name Christians Sons and Daughters who really believe the word of God hallelujah because God is showing that the wife came out of the Lord Jesus Christ and she is has been being made manifest Through The Seven Ages of the church through the seven edges of the church all the way from Paul 64 ad right on down to this time it went into the ground in the Dark Ages and through the ministry of Martin Luther amen God raised it up in a Reformation bringing the church to a rebirth amen and it started coming up in uh Luther amen Wesley then it came to Pentecost none of them had the fullness of the word as yet they had the word but not the fullness of the understanding of the word and God counted it righteousness and blessed them and use them for his glory and for his honor praise God but now the Sun is up the light is shining arise and shine amen people that sat in denominational Darkness have seen a great light and upon them the light of the world has sprung up and it's shining upon them to do what to wake up the seeds that were buried under the ground to bring them to life again praise God to bring them to a place where they can recognize that they are not just flesh and blood but they are Spirit beings Sons and Daughters of the most high eternity dwells within the eternal life is a gift of God you can't work it up you can't bring it down you can't buy it you can't steal it you can't study your way into it you can't pray your way into it you can't do nothing of yourself it is a perfect gift of God it's by grace and grace alone hallelujah hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah God help me I haven't touched my even touched my real sub subject yet but I'm I'm careful of everything that's happening here here if you if you feel like getting up and you know because you feel a little stiff or stretch it's okay it's not going to throw me off or bother me or anything else don't even think that it's going to be oh that's blasphemous to be in church it's horrible if you get up no get up if you want to go and get a glass of water get some water praise the Lord God hallelujah I'm not going to tell you not to do this or that you you're not going to go off the word and do something that's not in the word praise the Lord hallelujah amen all right shall we continue all right if you walk with a dinner bell or a whistle you know when to whistle all right now in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh this is from the future home of the Heavenly bride in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us three stages think of it it was an attribute force that was in God Amen in other words are thought he thought of himself as being human and that transmitted him down to be Jesus uh you want to use that the Greek word and morphe he began to and morphe himself uh down to Being Human changing by degrees he's changing himself to becoming human praise God hallelujah and that transmitted him down to Jesus amen now if you'll ever be there you was in him then for there's only one form of eternal life is that right Satan would like to tell you there's two right but there is no two there's only one form of eternal life and the only form of eternal life we know is God himself praise God and God would God is just a general term or word you know that God which God you serve you has to have a name right it's just like me saying to you you're a human being you're human yes but what is your name God but what is his name amen praise God his name is Jesus Christ they asked Peter that in the book of Acts and you know his answers acts 1 Acts 2 he answered plainly that his name is Jesus Christ there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah that's the name Jesus Christ is really Father Son and Holy Ghost he's God in the father he's God in the son he's is God and the Holy Ghost he's God the only one I know God he's God and God don't ever change I know God he's God and Jesus is his name he's God up at the platform he's God back at the door he's God in the Amen Corner he's God all over the floor I know God he's God and God don't ever change I know God he is God and Jesus is his name he's God when the Lightning's flashing he's God when the Thunder's rle he's God in the Amen Corner he is God down in my soul I know God he's amen God don't ever change I know God is God and Jesus is his name amen Hall only one form of eternal life that's God and you had to be a part of God at the beginning not what you are choosing to do down here see he already chose you you are in him there already Chosen and in him praise God hallelujah praise God and all the father has given me welcome praise God because you was in him his ch chosen ones Beyond those Gates oh my God is worth everything praise God because the chosen ones will be there Hallelujah yes sir we were with him just like Isaac just like Jacob they were in him praise God hallelujah now I'm going to stop here now because this will take me into my uh the rest of the subject and that's going to be another two hours so um if you're okay and you want spend the other two hours is okay but I wouldn't bring you under that pressure Modern Life modern society modern actions people try to make us like we were the oldtime Saints but we come in a different age even our flesh Constitution is different because of the things we eat the clothes we wear and the things we do we we we don't have that toughness like they had well we try to be but we we just the human flesh through the meats the food the preservatives this that that is broken us to this point where we can only have such length of life amen I I I heard of a man that lived for 140 years in the West Indies over in Jamaica and the same week I met another man who was telling me of his uncle in Trinidad that died at 129 so you see there are some of those um physical traits still there where a man could live maybe a thousand years but that's long gone because the whole world is polluted now and everything has changed and we are here holding to God's unchanging hand I was just about to get into uh T Isaac and uh Joseph right into this and begin to bring the rest of the word but we'll talk about that another time by his grace praise the name of the Lord I don't want to overstay my wel come here praise the name of the Lord let's come up um Brothers Let's Worship the Lord of w you know the Pentecostals have it they do a whole lot of worship before the service but they don't understand it's just a little bit of worship before
