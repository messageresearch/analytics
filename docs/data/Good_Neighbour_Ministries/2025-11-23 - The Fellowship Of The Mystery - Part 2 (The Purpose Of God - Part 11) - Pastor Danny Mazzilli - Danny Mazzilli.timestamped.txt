[0:13] life.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; And it should bring a completely fresh
[0:17] experience with God every single day
[0:21] that you feast on the word of God. Amen.
[0:23] Praise God. So, we had some tremendous
[0:26] meetings there. While we were there, um,
[0:30] you know, uh, Brother Isaiah's
[0:31] granddaughter, you know, when she was,
[0:33] you know, I could tell right away when
[0:35] when I first met her, you know, um, on
[0:37] the Saturday night, there was something
[0:38] stirring in her heart and she was asking
[0:41] questions and I was saying, "Wow, she's
[0:43] asking me the right what this is while
[0:44] we're driving to the services because
[0:46] she lives with brother Isaiah. You know,
[0:49] the family lives together and she's
[0:51] asking I said, "Wow, she's asking the
[0:52] right questions." I said, "Praise God."
[0:55] I believe, you know, something's
[0:56] stirring in her heart. Well, anyway, by
[0:57] the end of the weekend, she wanted to be
[0:59] baptized again.
[1:02] She had been baptized and but but uh she
[1:05] realized that that uh you know something
[1:08] and and I was talking to her. I said,
[1:10] "Well, obviously something has changed
[1:11] on the inside, sister, that never
[1:14] happened." The she says, "Yes." And she
[1:17] was really just feasting on the word and
[1:19] zealous. And so anyways, um on the
[1:22] Sunday after the service, they they um
[1:25] um use a pool in one of the local uh
[1:30] hotels in the area. And so we went to
[1:33] this hotel and we went and she was
[1:36] baptized there. Uh brother Isaiah
[1:40] baptized her in the name of the Lord
[1:42] Jesus Christ. And while we were sitting
[1:44] there, you know, I'm sitting and I'm
[1:46] watching and I'm looking and I look over
[1:47] at the window. you could put up the the
[1:49] the picture there. And if you'll notice
[1:52] in that picture, I took a picture with
[1:55] brother Isaiah and his daughter. And
[1:58] then I said, "What do you see in that
[2:00] mirror in that in that window?" And they
[2:03] both looked at it and it was like the
[2:06] cloud in the picture. And they and they
[2:09] both said, "That's the cloud." I said,
[2:11] "How long you've been baptizing in this
[2:13] place?" They said, "Well, we've been
[2:15] coming here and baptizing." I said,
[2:16] "Well, praise God." I said, "I believe
[2:19] God is meeting his people right here,
[2:22] vindicating his presence." Amen. And so,
[2:24] um, we were very blessed, uh, for the
[2:27] Lord to vindicate, um, you know, our
[2:29] dear sister Michaela being baptized. And
[2:32] the next picture, I said, "Well, I got
[2:34] to get into this picture, too." So, I,
[2:36] you know, I I got into the picture and I
[2:38] said, "Praise God. I was there. I
[2:40] witnessed it. I saw it. Praise God." And
[2:43] so I'm very grateful to the Lord um for
[2:46] his wonderful move uh in Iowa last
[2:49] weekend. Praise God. But that was last
[2:51] weekend. We're interested in what God
[2:53] has for us today. Amen. You've come here
[2:56] today because you're interested in what
[2:58] the Lord has available for us. Amen. I'm
[3:01] excited about the word of God. I'm also
[3:03] excited about the upcoming Christmas um
[3:08] dinner that we will be hosting here at
[3:11] the Burlington Convention Center. I'm
[3:14] expecting to see everyone
[3:17] every single one of you um that are in
[3:20] this household of faith. You are part of
[3:22] the family of God. Uh uh guests are
[3:25] welcome also visitors are welcome to
[3:28] join us for the dinner. You just need to

[3:33] there. There's a list and we want you to

[3:38] people will be coming with your family.
[3:40] I don't want any excuses. Oh, brother,
[3:42] we're having a hard time right now. That
[3:44] doesn't matter. Put your name on the on
[3:46] the list. You know how things are done
[3:49] uh here. We trust God. Amen. We believe
[3:52] God. And so God wants every one of his
[3:55] children at the Christmas table this
[3:58] year. Amen. Praise God. So, I'm looking
[4:00] forward to seeing every single one of
[4:02] you there. Amen. Let's let's all stand.
[4:05] Let's all go to the word of God now as
[4:07] we um surrender ourselves. I trust that
[4:11] uh you've been praying. Amen.
[4:17] And that you have an expectation for the
[4:20] Lord to give us something. I'm just as
[4:24] expectant as you are. Amen. Let's pray.
[4:27] And let's ask the Lord to come. Father,
[4:30] we just so appreciate it every time that
[4:33] we come together in this way. Father,
[4:35] where you come, where you are the mighty
[4:39] angel, where you are the director, the
[4:43] guide, the inspiration in the midst of
[4:46] your children, Lord, that you're the one
[4:47] that breaks the bread of life and gives
[4:50] understanding to the hearts. Lord, it's
[4:53] only by revelation that we walk with you
[4:55] in this day and in this hour. And so we
[4:57] ask you to come and minister to our
[4:59] hearts, Lord. Speak to us this
[5:02] afternoon, Lord. Let our hearts burn
[5:04] within us, Lord, as we uh feast upon
[5:08] your word. Lord, I'm just a man, but I
[5:11] surrender this vessel to you now in the
[5:14] name of Jesus Christ. Lord, we commit
[5:16] this service and each and every need
[5:20] that's in every heart. Lord, you know
[5:23] each one. Father, may you meet that need
[5:25] now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise
[5:29] God.
[5:30] Let's um we've been on this series uh
[5:33] today. We're on part 11 of um the
[5:36] purpose of God and called unto adoption.
[5:38] We've been looking at obtaining our
[5:40] inheritance. It's all part of the
[5:43] adoption of sons and daughters of God.
[5:46] Amen. And uh last time that we
[5:48] ministered, we ministered on the
[5:50] fellowship of the mystery. Uh today we
[5:52] want to continue on that. We want to
[5:54] look at um so call it part two of the
[5:57] fellowship of the mystery and we're just
[5:59] uh trusting that the Lord is going to
[6:01] unveil to us a little bit more about
[6:04] this tremendous uh walk that we have
[6:07] with the Lord. Amen. This is not just a
[6:10] regular Christian uh church. Amen. We
[6:14] believe in the supernatural. We believe
[6:16] that God is is moving in this hour.
[6:20] Amen. and that there's individuals that
[6:22] have recognized that. Amen. Let's read
[6:23] our scripture from Colossians chapter 1
[6:27] verses 25- 27. Um Paul's speaking here.
[6:31] He says, "Whereof I am made a minister
[6:34] according to the dispensation of God
[6:37] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[6:42] the word of God." Amen. So he realized
[6:45] that he was a part of the word and that
[6:47] he was given a portion of the word to to
[6:50] bring forth so that it could fulfill the
[6:53] word. Amen. In his particular day. Amen.
[6:57] And he goes on to say here, even the
[6:59] mystery which hath been hid from ages
[7:03] and from generations,
[7:06] but now is made manifest to his saints.
[7:10] Amen. to whom God would make known what
[7:13] is the riches of the glory of this
[7:16] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[7:21] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[7:28] Praise God. I love that. To whom God
[7:32] would make known what is the riches of
[7:35] the glory of this mystery among the
[7:38] Gentiles. And then he goes to tell us
[7:40] what the mystery is,
[7:43] which is Christ in you,
[7:47] the hope of glory. Amen. Praise God.
[7:50] What it truly is to be a a a a son or a
[7:53] daughter of God. What it is to be a
[7:55] Christian. People talk about
[7:57] Christianity. There's churches that are
[7:59] full today.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; But there's a revelation to the sons and
[8:03] daughters of God. What is the true
[8:06] meaning of Christ in you?
[8:09] &gt;&gt; The meaning of being a Christian. Amen.
[8:12] Uh let's read the quote here. Brother
[8:13] Brand is speaking here in Christ the
[8:15] mystery of God revealed. He says, "Now
[8:18] for a text, I want to take out of there
[8:22] this for a text basing it upon the
[8:25] entire Bible."
[8:28] Not take note of this,
[8:31] but I want us title this Christ is the
[8:36] mystery of God revealed.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Christ being the mystery of God
[8:42] revealed. Now, I took it in order as a
[8:47] Sunday school lesson so we could all
[8:50] read together and have this fellowship
[8:54] together.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, you know, um
[8:59] we're looking at uh the fellowship of
[9:01] the mystery. And here, brother Brandham,
[9:04] you know, uh in 1963
[9:07] when the seals were open, you know, he
[9:10] came to the seventh seal. And when he
[9:12] opened the seventh seal, there was
[9:14] basically silence. And um there was not
[9:17] a lot that he would bring out when he
[9:20] actually ministered on the seventh seal.
[9:23] But what we've come to realize in this
[9:26] day is that this uh message that he
[9:30] preached, Christ is the mystery of God
[9:33] revealed, was actually the seventh seal
[9:36] being preached. Amen. And so, you know
[9:40] what ended up happening is when that
[9:42] seal was opened to brother Brandham, he
[9:45] said the Bible became a brand new book.
[9:48] Yes.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; And that's why he could say now for a
[9:51] text I want to take this and he says
[9:54] basing it on the entire Bible.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; So the entire Bible is based on Christ
[10:03] &gt;&gt; being revealed.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; It's about God's plan of revelation.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; And then God here, you know, in the book
[10:11] of Genesis, it's it's all in seed form.
[10:14] Everything, you know, shown in seed
[10:16] form. And then by the time we get to the
[10:19] book of Revelation, it's God revealing
[10:22] because that's why it's called the book
[10:24] of Revelation. And it's the revelation
[10:26] of Jesus Christ. It even says it right
[10:29] in the beginning of the book. Amen. God
[10:31] unveils this great plan that started not
[10:37] back in the Garden of Eden. No, no. It
[10:40] started before the foundations of the
[10:43] world.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read our next scripture. We
[10:46] read this last week in Ephesians 3:es
[10:49] 8-11 because Paul here, you know, we
[10:52] want to we want to uh catch the mind of
[10:54] Paul. We want to catch the thought of
[10:57] what the Holy Spirit was unveiling to
[10:59] Paul because Paul could only see so much
[11:01] in his day. And Paul did not fully
[11:05] comprehend
[11:06] this mystery of God. He didn't realize
[11:10] that it was going to go through another
[11:12] seven church ages. He was the first
[11:13] church age messenger. But yet there was
[11:16] another six church ages that were to
[11:18] transpire and another 2,000 years of
[11:22] church history was going to be made.
[11:24] Amen. And he had no idea that this was
[11:28] all going to, you know, uh culminate in
[11:32] in a a prophet coming in the 20th
[11:35] century by the name of William Branham
[11:38] because he didn't he didn't know about
[11:39] the reformation. He didn't know that
[11:41] there was going to be a reformation. He
[11:43] didn't understand that that that Luther
[11:45] was going to, you know, that that that
[11:47] the word was actually that this whole
[11:49] mystery of God, it was actually going to
[11:51] be, you know, uh, blackened out by the
[11:53] church. Amen. That they would try to
[11:56] blacken out because any time that the
[11:58] Holy Spirit would try to do anything,
[12:01] what would happen? organized religion
[12:04] would come in and take a hold the you
[12:06] know the the the nicicolein spirit which
[12:09] is to take over the church. Amen. And to
[12:12] control the word and we know that that
[12:14] that took place and and darkened
[12:18] everything and buried every son and
[12:21] daughter of God that would come and
[12:24] recognize the word for their day. Every
[12:26] bride member throughout the dark ages.
[12:28] Satan would just squash them. squashed
[12:31] them, squashed them, trying to put out,
[12:34] didn't realize that this whole
[12:37] process was still to take place, not
[12:40] realizing that God was going to send a
[12:42] prophet in the 20th century that would
[12:45] restore the word back to the faith of
[12:50] the original fathers, back to the
[12:52] original faith, to put back that that
[12:54] that uh divine revelation back into the
[12:58] hearts of the children of God. Amen.
[13:01] That they would that there would be a
[13:03] people in the last days that would catch
[13:05] this revelation and understand it and
[13:07] come out from under any kind of
[13:10] organized religion and allow the Holy
[13:13] Spirit to have absolute preeminence and
[13:15] control in their lives. And so here Paul
[13:19] only had a a a part of the understanding
[13:22] of what this fellowship but he did he
[13:24] did have an understanding because God
[13:27] gave him the revelation of himself. The
[13:30] Lord revealed himself to Paul. Amen. And
[13:34] that's what happened through in every
[13:37] bride member of the church. All through
[13:39] the dark ages, all through those seven
[13:41] church ages, Christ would reveal himself
[13:44] personally to each one. Amen. Praise
[13:47] God. And so here now
[13:50] Paul's speaking. He says, "Unto me who
[13:53] am less than the least of all the saints
[13:55] is this given." Here he is. He's
[13:57] speaking it again just like he's spoken
[13:59] in Colossians. That I should preach
[14:01] among the Gentiles the uncarchable
[14:04] riches of Christ. Amen. and to make all
[14:08] men see what is the fellowship of the
[14:11] mystery which from the beginning of the
[14:14] world hath been hidden God. Amen. who
[14:17] created all things by Jesus Christ, to
[14:20] the intent that now unto the
[14:22] principalities and powers in heavenly
[14:25] places might be known by the church, the
[14:28] manifold wisdom of God, according to the
[14:31] eternal purpose
[14:33] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
[14:38] Lord. Amen. So everything that's why
[14:41] brother Brandham preached that message
[14:43] and and titled it Christ is the mystery
[14:47] of God revealed and Christ has been
[14:50] condescending all the way from the
[14:54] thoughts that he had in his mind. He
[14:56] started to condescend and he's been
[14:58] condescending down through all of the
[15:00] ages. But yet there was this mystery
[15:02] that was locked up because there was one
[15:05] thing that he would never allow Satan to
[15:08] do and that was to impersonate
[15:12] the word.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's the only thing
[15:18] that will actually call you
[15:21] and give you a revelation
[15:25] of this hour,
[15:27] &gt;&gt; a revelation of what God is doing now.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Without you seeing the word, you will
[15:35] just be another church member.
[15:40] That was the element that he locked up
[15:43] and made it so that there was no way
[15:47] that my children would be deceived.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; He was going to Listen, there's no way
[15:52] that sons and daughters of God can ever
[15:55] be deceived.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; You think you were looking for God?
[16:02] &gt;&gt; You were not looking for God.
[16:04] It was God in the Garden of Eden when
[16:07] when when Adam and Eve fell into sin.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; And guess what? You're born in sin.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; So don't think for one minute, oh, I
[16:15] looking for God. I was always looking
[16:18] for God. I knew that I was a son of God.
[16:20] No, you didn't.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; You didn't know nothing. You were born
[16:25] in sin, shaped in iniquity. You were
[16:27] speaking lies. And like Adam and Eve,
[16:29] the moment sin covered you, you were
[16:33] hiding from God. God was an
[16:34] inconvenience to you. Going to church
[16:36] was an inconvenience because you you you
[16:38] you'd feel condemned so you'd stay away
[16:41] from church.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; But God knew your life. God knew that
[16:45] your life was going to go through what
[16:47] it went through. God knew that he had to
[16:49] come to you at a certain time. That he
[16:51] couldn't come to you when you were
[16:53] younger. You know that, you know, like
[16:55] not to say God can't come to young
[16:56] children. Sure he can. Amen. But God
[16:59] knows every single one of us personally.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Every attribute that went forth from
[17:05] God. You you are in his mind. You are
[17:09] him. You are his expression. So he knows
[17:12] you.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; He knows you better than you know
[17:14] yourself. This thing here that you got
[17:17] locked into and and fell into spiritual
[17:19] amnesia doesn't know God.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; It rebelss against God. It's the thing
[17:25] that fights you every time you got to
[17:27] come to church.
[17:30] You're excited, but this thing you get
[17:32] up and oh yeah, I got to feel a
[17:34] headache. You know, oh, I want Is it
[17:38] raining out? I wonder whether I should
[17:40] go to church.
[17:42] You're one of these weather believers,
[17:44] you know.
[17:46] I wonder whether I should go to church
[17:48] because, you know, it's bad out there.
[17:50] You know, I can trust God. I I can trust
[17:53] God for this, but I can't trust God to
[17:55] bring me safely to church.
[17:58] Oh, glory to God. Aren't you glad God
[18:00] found you?
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; You You weren't even searching for God.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; You It wasn't until God opened your
[18:08] understanding,
[18:10] &gt;&gt; okay, that you now actually started to
[18:12] search for him.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; But your understanding had to be opened
[18:17] first. I was thinking about this and I
[18:19] was wondering when was it that that that
[18:21] that moment that God, you know, actually
[18:25] called me. I was actually, you know,
[18:28] going back in my mind and wondering
[18:30] about that because every one of us
[18:32] should be able to remember that moment
[18:35] when when the light came on,
[18:38] &gt;&gt; when something took place, you didn't
[18:41] quite understand it. But what happens is
[18:44] that when when when the Lord comes to
[18:47] you and it could be in such a simple
[18:50] way. Amen.
[18:52] All of a sudden your desire and this is
[18:55] how you know that God has come. Pay
[18:58] attention. Your desire now is for the
[19:02] word.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden you're reading things.
[19:05] You're reading scripture that you just
[19:08] couldn't. You you try to read one
[19:10] paragraph and you were snoring.
[19:13] You never you never even took the time
[19:14] to open the Bible
[19:16] &gt;&gt; while you were in school and you were
[19:19] going to Catholic school. You go to
[19:22] church on on that once or twice a year
[19:24] and you would you would you would go for
[19:26] a for a snooze.
[19:29] But then all of a sudden God opens your
[19:32] understanding. Something clicks on the
[19:34] inside. You didn't realize but that was
[19:36] God now awakening that attribute. Yeah.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Because if you're a son or a daughter of
[19:42] God, you always were.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; You just came into this dimension
[19:47] into a human body born of your parents.
[19:52] But then you're in this amnesia, not
[19:55] knowing that you're actually an
[19:57] attribute of God. But when God decides
[19:59] to awaken that attribute, your desire
[20:02] changes for the word.
[20:05] All of a sudden, I remember I went to
[20:08] see Gabriel to go get some furniture.
[20:12] We're talking. He gives me an amazing
[20:14] deal on furniture. I said, I said, man,
[20:16] I said, this is a great deal, you know,
[20:19] uh, are you satisfied? I'm, you know, he
[20:21] goes, he looks at me, he goes, you a
[20:22] Christian? I said,
[20:25] I was brought up Roman Catholic. I said,
[20:26] if that's Christianity, I'm a hypocrite.
[20:29] He goes, yeah, that's good. He gives me
[20:32] a tape and it was the Hebrews 1957 and
[20:36] I'm listening to that tape. Now the
[20:39] here's where I want to make a point here
[20:42] because we are not against tapes or
[20:46] listening to tapes.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Let me make that clear,
[20:50] &gt;&gt; okay? Because I listen to them every
[20:52] day. I just wrote I just read you a
[20:54] quote from brother Brandham, okay? But I
[20:56] got a revelation and an understanding
[20:59] &gt;&gt; that that God gives revelation, not man.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Okay? Faith cometh by hearing. By
[21:06] hearing what? The man. The word.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; The word.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; And here I was listening to that tape. I
[21:12] didn't understand it. But by the time I
[21:14] got home,
[21:16] I wanted more. I called Gabriel. I left.
[21:20] The Lord had it for me to leave my $250
[21:23] sunglasses
[21:25] at a doughnut shop down the street from
[21:27] his place. I said, "I gotta go back for
[21:29] those glass." God knows, you know,
[21:32] you're going back for those glasses at
[21:33] the same time you're going to pick up
[21:34] some more. He gives me a whole box of
[21:36] tapes.
[21:38] For the next three months, I'm listening
[21:40] to those tapes and and I'm and I'm I'm
[21:42] talking about the word. I had no idea
[21:44] who this man was. I didn't know he was a
[21:46] prophet. I had no idea. I didn't even
[21:49] know that he was a prophet and fully
[21:51] have a revelation on who he was for
[21:53] probably seven, eight months after I was
[21:55] baptized.
[21:57] Amen. But my my experience was with the
[22:01] word.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; And your experience has to be with the
[22:05] word. Amen.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; That's how you know that something has
[22:08] changed your desire now because what it
[22:10] is, it's the Holy Ghost coming into your
[22:13] life to awaken you
[22:16] &gt;&gt; to him
[22:17] &gt;&gt; to the word. Amen. Praise God. And so I
[22:21] realized that that was the point where
[22:24] God had triggered that attribute.
[22:28] It was in that experience of that day
[22:31] being at brother Gabriel's and I know
[22:34] brother Tim Beers was there, brother
[22:36] Vishnu was there and they were having
[22:37] some fellowship there and they noticed
[22:41] when you know when myself and my family
[22:43] came in and they noticed certain things
[22:46] that you know that that were kind of
[22:48] awkward or you know and and so so the
[22:50] here was a time and a season. I'm just
[22:52] using that as an example. You can go
[22:54] back into your own experience, but you
[22:57] need to find, you know, you need to go
[22:59] back and and see where it was that that
[23:01] that you all all of a sudden your desire
[23:04] became for the word of God.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; And that's that's what's required for a
[23:10] son or a daughter to come into
[23:14] their position as manifested sons of
[23:17] God. This is the mystery. This is the
[23:20] fellowship of the mystery.
[23:24] This is what Paul was trying to convey
[23:26] to the people in his day. And here I am
[23:31] and I'm I'm I'm moving under this
[23:33] fellowship of this mystery of God,
[23:36] knowing and understanding much better
[23:38] now what it's all about. Amen. And so
[23:42] this entire series has been on the
[23:45] purpose of God. Amen. And how God, the
[23:48] self-existent one, had a plan. and and
[23:51] and that's all part of the of the
[23:53] fellowship of that mystery. Amen. And we
[23:55] looked at how, you know, and throughout
[23:57] this whole series, we've been looking at
[23:58] how the Holy Ghost, the evidence of the
[24:00] Holy Ghost was not you speaking in
[24:02] tongues or shouting or or or uh you know
[24:06] um uh sensation. The evidence of the
[24:10] Holy Ghost was your ability to recognize
[24:13] the word for your day.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; And it would it would change your your
[24:17] your whole purpose.
[24:20] That's the true birth.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Go back and you you'll see that that
[24:25] when when that genuine experience took
[24:28] place, your purpose changed. Your your
[24:30] whole life changed and people around you
[24:34] noticed.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; They said, "This person is either crazy
[24:39] or they've met God."
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's that's, you know,
[24:43] that's what what really the the purpose
[24:45] of God takes over your whole life. And
[24:48] now you're you're walking this new walk
[24:51] with God. Amen. And so that was the the
[24:54] true evidence of the of the Holy Ghost.
[24:56] And then we were looking at adoption and
[24:59] how we are predestinated
[25:02] unto adoption. Amen. We're not
[25:04] predestinated unto a heavenly dimension.
[25:08] That's not what No. No. We're
[25:11] predestinated unto the adoption of sons.
[25:15] Amen. And when when we when we become uh
[25:18] fully manifest sons, it's because we've
[25:22] we've actually made contact with our
[25:24] theophony bodies and and that that uh
[25:28] change which is being produced right now
[25:31] through the preaching of the word and
[25:33] which we call the rapture. This is the
[25:36] rapture dispensation. This is the
[25:38] element that that that has awakened us.
[25:42] Amen. It's the word that's right now
[25:45] quickening us into that other dimension.
[25:48] Amen. Praise God. And so we realize that
[25:52] that when God sent Malachi 4 and
[25:56] Revelations 10 through the Reformation,
[26:00] Amen. Luther Wesley,
[26:04] William Brham, the seventh church age
[26:07] messenger, the 20th century messenger.
[26:11] Amen. prophet to this age. We realized
[26:14] there was another dispensational change
[26:17] that took place. And you must recognize
[26:20] that dispensation
[26:23] is what we're in now. Amen. We're no
[26:26] longer under the seven church ages. We
[26:28] are under the eternal church age, which
[26:31] is the bride age, which is where Christ
[26:34] himself now is calling sons of God into
[26:39] adoption. adoption unto sons of God.
[26:44] Amen. Let's read our next quote here.
[26:48] So he says here the mystery of his will
[26:51] and remember how we hung on that. How
[26:55] many was here this morning? Let's see
[26:57] how we stuck on that. The mystery of his
[27:00] will. Amen. Now it is not just a little
[27:04] thing. Then it's a mystery.
[27:07] God's will is a mystery. And each man
[27:11] has to seek out the will of God for his
[27:14] or herself.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I took that quote
[27:20] because that jumped out on me. God's
[27:22] mystery, but God's mystery is not some
[27:26] universal understanding.
[27:29] God's mystery is something that includes
[27:33] you as a part of it. Amen.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; So it's not just knowing
[27:38] &gt;&gt; the mystery,
[27:40] &gt;&gt; but it's understanding that you are a
[27:42] part of
[27:43] &gt;&gt; the mystery.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; And this is what puts you into the
[27:48] fellowship
[27:49] &gt;&gt; of the mystery.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not talking about the
[27:52] mystery of fellowship
[27:54] &gt;&gt; where people come together and oh
[27:56] brother, let's have some fellowship and
[27:58] before you know it, it turns into
[27:59] battleship.
[28:00] No, I'm talking about the fellowship of
[28:02] the mystery
[28:04] &gt;&gt; because you've entered into that element
[28:07] where you recognize that you are a son
[28:09] or a daughter of God. You are a part of
[28:12] God's program. You've you've recognized
[28:15] that you were one of those attributes
[28:17] that was in the mind of God before the
[28:19] foundations of the world that was
[28:21] expressed into this age.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember what he said
[28:26] there in Colossians how that by that in
[28:28] that in that through the generations it
[28:31] was it was a mystery. It was not
[28:33] revealed through all those generations
[28:36] but it was to be revealed in these last
[28:39] days. Let's go to the next uh quote
[28:41] here. He says how that he would send
[28:43] Jesus. Amen. And this is where we you
[28:46] know where a lot of people they don't
[28:48] understand. All they do is they place
[28:51] Jesus on the cross.
[28:55] And that's all they put him there and
[28:57] they say he died for my sins. But they
[29:01] have no revelation on the fact that he
[29:04] came that the word that was from the
[29:07] beginning in the beginning was the word
[29:08] and the word was with God and the word
[29:10] was God and the word was made flesh.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Okay. His purpose in becoming flesh
[29:20] &gt;&gt; was so that man could be God. Amen.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; And so that God could be man
[29:26] &gt;&gt; and that when he died on the cross
[29:29] because you were in him in the before
[29:32] the foundation of the world, you were in
[29:34] him when he went to Calvary.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; When he rose from the dead, you rise
[29:40] from the dead.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Every attribute that was in God from the
[29:45] beginning, remember God in the
[29:47] beginning, he created angels. And the
[29:49] purpose of the angels was so that he
[29:51] could be called God. Yes,
[29:53] &gt;&gt; he wasn't even God before he created the
[29:55] angels because something had to worship
[29:57] him
[29:57] &gt;&gt; cuz God is an object of worship.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; But when he expressed sons, that's what
[30:03] made him father.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; And that's why you can say, I HAVE A
[30:08] FATHER.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; I am a SON OF GOD. I'M NOT AN ANGEL. I'm
[30:13] not some some being that's going to have
[30:16] a beginning and have an end. No, you
[30:18] have no beginning. You have no end
[30:21] &gt;&gt; because you're a son.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And he says here, he
[30:26] says how that he would send Jesus that
[30:29] through this sacrifice, we would all
[30:32] have a right to the tree of life. And
[30:34] who is the tree of life?
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; He's the tree that was in the Garden of
[30:39] Eden that Adam and Eve could feed on
[30:41] every night in the in the cool of the
[30:43] evening. They could just feast around
[30:46] that tree, which was not a literal tree.
[30:48] It was Christ.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; He was the tree of life. He says, "But
[30:53] of that tree,
[30:55] you shall not eat, for it is the tree of
[30:58] good and evil.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; It knows both.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; The day you eat thereof, you will die."
[31:05] And that's what brought about the reason
[31:08] we're here today.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God had a plan.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; God had a plan. Amen. And this is what
[31:15] we're feasting on. Amen. This is what's
[31:17] bringing us back home.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; This word is what's restoring us back to
[31:22] our original placing in the word of God.
[31:24] Amen. Glory to God. So he says those who
[31:27] he forneew, he called. Those who he
[31:30] called, he has already justified. Those
[31:33] who he had justified, he's already
[31:35] glorified. God since the beginning of
[31:38] the world predestinated us to the
[31:41] adoption of sons. Amen. Now the whole
[31:45] creation is groaning for the
[31:48] manifestation of the sons of God. Oh, I
[31:51] imagine Paul had a wonderful time. I'd
[31:54] have liked to have been there with him.
[31:56] Wouldn't you? Amen. You see, he he was
[31:59] he was caught up into this revelation
[32:01] and understanding that he was a son of
[32:04] God and that he would manifest a in the
[32:08] fullness at some point.
[32:11] But he knew that it hadn't come yet. He
[32:14] realized that this was something because
[32:17] he said the earth
[32:20] and the creation, the whole creation
[32:23] is groaning for the manifestation of the
[32:26] sons of God. Because when they ate from
[32:29] that tree of knowledge of good and evil,
[32:32] everything fell.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; All creation fell. the animals, the
[32:37] trees, everything had a now now
[32:40] everything had death.
[32:43] Now everything had a a death which is
[32:46] which is a separation from God because
[32:48] he's life.
[32:50] And so that's why Paul had an
[32:52] understanding that that there would be a
[32:54] time when the sons of God would come
[32:56] into manifestation in their fullness
[33:00] &gt;&gt; and it would restore everything back.
[33:04] And that's why the whole earth, that's
[33:06] why all of creation, that's why the the
[33:08] earth, that's why the the earth is
[33:10] belching with with with weather patterns
[33:12] and and and birth pains and and uh we're
[33:16] having all kinds of hurricanes and and
[33:18] and the world is just, you know,
[33:21] earthquakes and this and that. What is
[33:23] it? It's groaning. It's wanting the sons
[33:26] of God to manifest so that because they
[33:30] know that they carry the word of life
[33:33] that WHATEVER THEY SAY HAS to obey.
[33:36] Amen. That's why when when God placed
[33:38] Adam in the Garden of Eden, he says he
[33:40] says whatever you says I give you full
[33:43] dominion over the entire earth. If he
[33:46] had have spoken to the tree move to
[33:48] there, it would move.
[33:51] He had full dominion as a son. He was
[33:53] God on earth. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[33:57] Let's look at the next slide. These are
[34:00] quotes from adoption uh the fourth um
[34:04] the fourth uh message that he preached
[34:06] on it 1960. He says, "Now he said he
[34:09] made known to us the mystery." And
[34:12] listen what he says here. He says, "Get
[34:14] the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit on you
[34:16] sometime and start running that through.
[34:19] Just watch how it goes." This afternoon
[34:22] I had about 30 minutes to study. Just,
[34:24] you know, looked the lesson over, maybe
[34:26] not. Uh, I'll say half of that, maybe 15
[34:28] minutes between the times I got to
[34:30] running. And I thought, the mystery, how
[34:33] mysterious. And the scripture packed me
[34:37] back into the Old Testament, then back
[34:39] over into the New Testament, tied
[34:42] something together. See, the mystery of
[34:45] his coming. You see, this is what
[34:47] brother Brandham was breaking into when
[34:49] he was into this adoption series. He
[34:52] was, remember, he was he was the first
[34:54] fruit of the manifestation of a son of
[34:58] God going through the adoption process
[35:00] that would come into full manifestation.
[35:03] He didn't even realize that that
[35:07] Revelations 10:1-7 was coming, but he
[35:10] knew that that the that that the word
[35:13] would manifest the sons of God
[35:15] eventually. But he didn't have a full
[35:17] understanding of how it was going to
[35:18] happen. It wasn't until 1962, late '62,
[35:23] where God started to give him those
[35:24] visions. Sir, is this the time? Wh what
[35:28] was it? He didn't have any idea. And
[35:30] then even when he went to preach those
[35:32] seals, he said, "I'd have been
[35:34] completely wrong if the Holy Spirit, if
[35:37] the Holy Ghost, if the angel hadn't come
[35:40] into that room on on the opening of each
[35:43] of those seals and give me a revelation
[35:47] and broke the vision of exactly what was
[35:50] actually under those seals." Amen. He'd
[35:53] have made a mess of it. Goes to show you
[35:55] the progression of the word of God.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:00] And so here he says you know uh he says
[36:04] the mystery how mysterious in the
[36:05] scripture packed me back from the old to
[36:07] the new tied something together. See the
[36:09] mystery of his coming the mystery of his
[36:11] will the mystery of us sitting together.
[36:16] Remember it cannot be taught in any
[36:18] seminary.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; So don't be looking, oh I'm going to go
[36:23] do a study on God and how I am a son of
[36:26] God. No, forget it.
[36:28] You're not going to get it in any
[36:29] seminary. Period. It's a mystery.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; You cannot know it by education or by
[36:36] theology. It's it's the it's a mystery
[36:40] that's been hidden since the foundation
[36:41] of the world. Now, pay attention.
[36:44] Waiting for the manifestation of the
[36:48] sons of God.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Why does it why why does it need to wait
[36:53] for the manifestation of the sons of
[36:54] God, brother Chris? Why?
[36:58] What is it that's being unveiled
[37:01] in the revelation of this hour that
[37:04] requires sons of God to come into their
[37:07] full maturity, to come into their
[37:10] adoption, to come into an understanding
[37:13] that that church is not just about
[37:15] joining a church, going there on Sunday,
[37:19] going there on the Wednesday services,
[37:22] you know, going up to the front, taking
[37:24] the Lord's supper, all these the all
[37:27] these things. That's not what church is.
[37:31] God didn't even God didn't even
[37:33] institute church. It was man that
[37:36] instituted church.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; When the first church went out in the
[37:40] book of Acts, they went everywhere.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; They went into the highways and the
[37:44] byways and they and they just preached
[37:46] the word of God under the inspiration.
[37:48] Paul says, "I don't come to you with
[37:49] enticing words,
[37:51] &gt;&gt; catechisms, and all of this. I come to
[37:53] you in the power of his resurrection."
[37:55] In other words, God was in him.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; He recognized the Holy Ghost was in him
[38:00] and he was bringing forth the word for
[38:02] their day.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; He was he was manifesting sunship.
[38:06] Didn't understand it. Didn't realize it.
[38:08] But this is how God has always been
[38:10] doing it.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't change. Amen. Praise God.
[38:14] And so, we're looking at this whole
[38:18] fellowship of the mystery and and trying
[38:20] to understand it in a in a greater way.
[38:22] And you know, that's why I've been in
[38:24] this study. I've just been rejoicing
[38:26] around it. I don't know. Like I I can't
[38:28] convey to you all the thoughts that pour
[38:31] into my mind. I forget half of them.
[38:33] I'll be honest with you. You know, like
[38:35] I wake up in the morning sometimes and
[38:37] that's my best. That's when my mind is
[38:39] clear and I'm sitting there and I'm
[38:41] going thoughts are pouring through my
[38:43] mind on this word and I'm seeing things
[38:45] like, "Oh God, hallelujah. Praise God.
[38:48] But I'm lazy. I don't want to get up and
[38:50] go and write all these notes down right
[38:51] now. I'm still half asleep. But I'm but
[38:53] I'm but I'm rejoicing because this this
[38:57] revelation is not something that you can
[39:00] you can study. It's revealed.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; It's revealed to you.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; That's why your position, your calling,
[39:09] your placing in the body. Oh, I'm going
[39:11] to join the church and because I'm good
[39:13] at this, I'm going to do that for the
[39:14] church. No, God is going to place you in
[39:18] the body
[39:19] &gt;&gt; according to his purpose and his plan.
[39:22] what he saw in you before the
[39:24] foundations of the world.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what's in you, how
[39:29] you're built, how you're designed, and
[39:31] how he can best use you to edify and
[39:34] build the body of Christ.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I, you know, just started
[39:41] reading through certain scriptures on
[39:42] the on the sons of God. And, you know,
[39:45] let's go to the next scripture here from
[39:46] Romans chapter 8. you know, there's some
[39:49] some things in in the scripture here
[39:51] that just, you know, struck my heart.
[39:53] So, he goes on, he says here in Romans
[39:55] 8:es 8-11, he says, "Now, pay
[39:59] attention." Like, let's draw from the
[40:00] word because faith comes from the word.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got no I I don't have anything
[40:05] for you.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; I just have a yielded vessel,
[40:09] &gt;&gt; but I'm trusting that the Holy Spirit
[40:11] will will will, you know, as you're
[40:13] pulling on the word of God, God's going
[40:15] to meet your need. God's going to speak
[40:16] to you. God's going to make this word
[40:18] live.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the letter kills, but the
[40:21] spirit brings it to life. Amen. So then
[40:25] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[40:28] God. Now keep in mind, we're talking
[40:30] about the fellowship of the mystery,
[40:32] which is bringing into adoption sons of
[40:36] God.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. You coming into your rightful
[40:39] position as a son of God. And when I say
[40:42] sons, I mean daughters, too. Okay? But
[40:45] he says here, "But ye are not in the
[40:48] flesh,
[40:50] but in the spirit." Okay? If so be that
[40:54] the spirit of God dwell in you. So you
[40:56] got to, you know, do you know, have you
[40:59] received the Holy Ghost since you
[41:01] believed?
[41:02] &gt;&gt; That's the question that's coming out of
[41:04] there.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Paul's not saying that, but but Paul in
[41:07] Acts chapter uh 19, he asked a bunch of
[41:11] disciples. He says, "I see you're
[41:13] praising God. I see you get together. I
[41:15] see you guys having a great time. He
[41:17] says, "But have you received the Holy
[41:18] Ghost since you believed?" You could ask
[41:22] that question to 99%
[41:25] of the churches out there. They won't
[41:26] know how to answer that question.
[41:29] But if you've received it, you know,
[41:33] &gt;&gt; you know that you know. Amen. The word
[41:36] is alive. The word is real. When you
[41:38] read a scripture like this, it it just
[41:40] speaks to you in volumes. If so be that
[41:43] the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if
[41:45] any man have not the spirit of Christ,
[41:48] he is none of his.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; He's just making it straight.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; He's just making it plain. So you young
[41:54] people, if you're still questioning, if
[41:56] you're still wondering, oh, am I his am
[41:58] I am I a am I am I a part of the bride
[42:00] or anybody, young, old, doesn't matter.
[42:02] You could be in this message for 30
[42:04] years. Have you received the Holy Ghost
[42:05] since you believed?
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got he says he says here he
[42:10] says uh not if any man h have now if any
[42:13] man have not the spirit of Christ he is
[42:15] none of his. So you got to check
[42:17] yourself you need to make sure your
[42:18] calling your election and he says and if
[42:22] Christ be in you the body is dead
[42:25] because of sin.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; So in other words don't put any merit on
[42:31] your ability to do anything in this
[42:33] body. Oh I go to church every day. You
[42:36] got Catholics, they go to church every
[42:38] morning and every night.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; THE BODY'S DEAD.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; GOD is not LOOKING AT YOUR FLESH. GOD'S
[42:45] NOT LOOKING AT YOUR WORKS. God's not
[42:47] looking at your at your ability to to do
[42:50] what what you think you're doing for
[42:52] God.
[42:54] No, sir. You must be in Christ.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; You must have pleaded the blood of
[42:59] Christ. Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; You must recognize that when he died at
[43:03] Calvary, you died with him.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; And when he rose, you rose with him. But
[43:10] you're stuck in this body. But you know
[43:12] who you are. You recognize. Now look, he
[43:14] goes on. And if Christ being you, the
[43:16] body's dead in sin, but the spirit is
[43:19] life because of righteousness. Who's
[43:22] righteousness?
[43:23] He just said your body's dead, but
[43:26] because of the spirit in you
[43:29] righteousness.
[43:30] Whose righteousness? His righteousness.
[43:33] You can't have any righteousness that's
[43:36] going to please God. It's only if he
[43:38] dwells in you. So watch, he goes on. He
[43:40] says now, "But if the spirit of him,
[43:43] here it is, that raised up Jesus from
[43:45] the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[43:49] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[43:51] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[43:54] dwelleth in you." He's making it so
[43:56] clear here that it's by the Holy Ghost.
[44:00] It's by the spirit of God in you that
[44:03] you have any hope of being resurrected.
[44:07] He's made it clear here. Your body is
[44:09] dead because of sin. That's why Jesus
[44:13] had to come as a man. He had to be born
[44:17] in a the womb of a woman. Not the way
[44:22] that man is born where there was a man
[44:26] and a woman coming together. No, she had
[44:29] to be virgin. He He was virgin born. He
[44:33] was born of a virgin. Amen. By the
[44:36] spoken word. Remember, it's all about
[44:39] the word.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; You must you must receive the spoken
[44:44] word. You must like Mary say, "Be it
[44:47] unto me to the angel according to thy
[44:51] word."
[44:52] &gt;&gt; That's what gives you this relationship
[44:54] with Christ.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; That's what awakens you to the
[44:58] understanding that you are a son or a
[45:00] daughter of God.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; It's the word birth, not the natural
[45:04] birth. So, he goes on here. He says,
[45:06] "Now watch next scripture." We're going
[45:10] to continue here in Romans. He goes,
[45:11] "For as many as are led by the spirit of
[45:14] God, they are the sons of God."
[45:17] &gt;&gt; We're talking about sunship. Amen. For
[45:20] ye have not received the spirit of
[45:22] bondage again to fear,
[45:25] but ye have received the spirit of
[45:28] adoption.
[45:30] This is where God is actually uh
[45:33] bringing you through a process.
[45:36] of understanding who you really are.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; The adoption process, not and and why is
[45:42] he doing that? Because in the Old
[45:44] Testament, when there was an adoption of
[45:46] a son, it was because the father was
[45:49] passing down all of his rights,
[45:53] &gt;&gt; all of his all of his leadership,
[45:56] &gt;&gt; all of his wealth,
[45:58] &gt;&gt; all of his authority,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; all that was in God, he poured into
[46:03] Christ. And all that was in Christ, he
[46:06] poured into the church, which is the
[46:10] body of Christ. Amen. He's passing this
[46:14] authority of adoption. So, it's the
[46:16] spirit of adoption. And look, whereby we
[46:18] cry father.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; See, you can't call God father unless
[46:24] you're a son.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; You you you understand now. You're not
[46:28] just a churchgoer. You're not just a
[46:30] you're not just a a Roman Catholic or
[46:32] you're or a Baptist or a Presbyterian or
[46:35] or a Methodist or a Pentecostal. No.
[46:37] When you come into this revelation of
[46:39] the spirit of God in you, you turn
[46:41] around and say, "I'm not the son of
[46:43] Dominic and Ida Mazili.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; This is but I'M A SON OF GOD."
[46:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM caught that
[46:50] revelation. I'm not the son of Charles
[46:52] and Ella Brandham. I am the son, a son
[46:56] of God. Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; And now I can now knowing who I am, I
[47:02] can move into my position. I can
[47:04] understand my authority. I can recognize
[47:06] what God it what it is that God wants to
[47:09] impart unto me. Amen. Praise God. The
[47:14] spirit itself beare witness with our
[47:16] spirit that we are the children of God.
[47:20] Amen. And if children, here it is, then
[47:24] hes
[47:26] of God and joint hes with Christ. Amen.
[47:30] You see how it's all about the mystery
[47:32] of God. It's all about Christ becoming
[47:36] man and man becoming God.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this whole process that that
[47:42] God is bringing us through. And if
[47:43] children, heirs, heirs of God, and then
[47:46] if so be that we suffer with him, that
[47:49] we may also be glorified together. Amen.
[47:53] You got to bear the reproach for the
[47:55] word of God. Yes.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; It's not an easy walk. You're not going
[47:59] to just walk this walk and just come to
[48:01] church every Sunday and oh everything is
[48:04] fine and I can do this and I can do that
[48:06] and putting, you know, putting church
[48:09] secondary. No, no, no, no, no. If God
[48:12] has filled you with himself by the Holy
[48:15] Ghost, you can't wait to read the word.
[48:18] You can't wait to get into the house of
[48:20] the Lord to hear the word. You can't
[48:22] wait to hear the supernatural. You
[48:24] because listen,
[48:27] God discerns hearts.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; God knows what you have need of.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; God knows exactly where you're at. He
[48:33] knows what you need to hear in order to
[48:35] bring you out of that amnesia that
[48:37] you're in.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let's read on here.
[48:43] He says here, "For I reckon that the
[48:45] suffering of this present time are not
[48:49] worthy to be compared with the glory
[48:52] which shall be revealed in us."
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Now, and and look what he go and look
[48:57] how he ends this in verse 19. For the
[49:00] earnest expectation of the creature
[49:03] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[49:06] sons of God. There it is again. Glory to
[49:09] God. Listen, when the word opens up to
[49:12] you, like when I started to, you know,
[49:14] look into this and and, you know, I was
[49:16] triggered by listening to certain
[49:17] messages and I'm going to share a little
[49:19] testimony here in a bit. But but
[49:21] understanding how this this word you
[49:25] know all of a sudden that's why brother
[49:27] Brandham when the seals were ripped open
[49:30] for him and when God opened his
[49:33] understanding to the to the mighty angel
[49:35] himself that had come down this that's
[49:38] why the book became a new book that's
[49:40] why when you read these scriptures you
[49:42] just it just blows your mind look read
[49:45] on here Romans 8:22-23 for we know that
[49:48] the whole creation
[49:50] He goes and reiterates it again. Groanth
[49:55] and travaleth in pain together until
[49:58] now. Imagine the whole world has been in
[50:01] this great travail all the way going
[50:04] right back to Genesis when right back to
[50:07] the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve
[50:09] fell. Right from that very moment that
[50:11] death set in the earth started to groan.
[50:15] It was it was dying at that point. Why?
[50:18] because it was separated from God. The
[50:21] the the the the inheritance that God had
[50:25] placed in Adam that was to bring forth
[50:29] every son and every daughter of God, he
[50:32] lost it at that moment when when when
[50:34] Eve was deceived and allowed the enemy
[50:38] to come in and inject himself
[50:42] into her which brought forth
[50:45] Cain and Abel. That's why the original
[50:47] sin was not an apple. Had nothing to do
[50:50] with an apple. If apples opens the eyes
[50:53] of the women, then let's hand out some
[50:55] apples because they're walking naked and
[50:58] they don't know it. They dress
[51:00] themselves in ways they present
[51:02] themselves in ways that was the original
[51:05] thing that that you know that that when
[51:07] when the eyes were opened. Amen. And she
[51:11] wanted to create. She wanted to be a a
[51:15] procreator because that's that's what
[51:17] Satan wanted. He wanted to bring forth
[51:19] of his own kind. He wanted to pervert.
[51:22] He wanted to change the program of God.
[51:25] Amen. But that's what caused the entire
[51:28] fall of every son and daughter of God.
[51:31] Adam lost that book of life.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] But it's been restored.
[51:41] He says, "For for we know the whole
[51:43] creation groanth and travaleth in the
[51:45] pain together until now. And not only
[51:48] they, but ourselves also." Amen. That's
[51:51] why we we we struggle in this world
[51:54] which have the first fruits of the
[51:55] spirit. Even we ourselves grown within
[51:59] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[52:03] wit the redemption of our body.
[52:07] We're groaning within ourselves because
[52:09] there's something about another body
[52:12] that we go to. If this earthly
[52:14] tabernacle be dissolved, we have another
[52:18] one that's waiting
[52:20] &gt;&gt; and we're groaning for that
[52:23] &gt;&gt; because that will bring into full
[52:26] maturity the sons and daughters of the
[52:30] living God here on earth. Amen. Praise
[52:33] God. How many knows that we're going
[52:35] into a millennium?
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's going to have bodies for us.
[52:40] Glory to God. We are we are we are we
[52:43] are waiting for that adoption to wit to
[52:47] to to bring forth so that we can go to
[52:51] our bodies, the redemptive bodies that
[52:54] are waiting for us, our theophony bodies
[52:56] that are waiting for us, the ones that
[52:58] brother Brandham saw when he went beyond
[53:00] the curtain of time. Amen. And he saw
[53:03] each and every one of our bodies there.
[53:05] Amen. Waiting. Glory to God. Praise God.
[53:09] But there's a process to get us there.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And that process is the process that
[53:14] we're in right now.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; That's why church is not about just
[53:18] coming together and reading scripture.
[53:20] Church is about God speaking the word
[53:22] line upon line, precept upon precept,
[53:25] here a little, there a little,
[53:27] quickening your mortal bodies by the
[53:29] same spirit that dwelt in Christ,
[53:32] raising you into heavenly places so that
[53:34] you can recognize who you really are.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let's read our next
[53:41] our next scripture
[53:43] in first Peter verse 1 3-5. Listen here.
[53:46] He says, "Blessed be the God and Father
[53:48] of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
[53:50] according to his abundant mercy hath
[53:52] begotten us again.
[53:55] You were born into this world. You're
[53:58] born into flesh.
[54:00] But now he's you there's a there's a new
[54:02] birth unto a lively hope." And the word
[54:06] lively, if you look up lively, it means
[54:08] eternal life. It means life. The eternal
[54:12] life, the eternal hope.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. by the resurrection of Jesus
[54:17] Christ from the dead to an inheritance.
[54:22] Now, we we want to know about our
[54:23] inheritance. I want you to know that
[54:25] your inheritance is not something of
[54:28] this world
[54:30] &gt;&gt; because it's it it makes it very clear
[54:32] here. He says it's incorruptible.
[54:35] It's an inheritance that's
[54:36] incorruptible. So, it's not something
[54:39] that's going to that that's going to
[54:41] last, that's going to be No, it's it's
[54:42] fading away. Okay? Anything that's
[54:44] corruptible is going to fade. So don't
[54:46] be looking for, oh, God's going to give
[54:48] me billions of dollars here on earth.
[54:51] God can do whatever he wants. If he
[54:53] needs money to move through the ministry
[54:55] to fulfill his purpose, he will use
[54:58] those that have a revelation on Jehovah
[55:02] Gyra.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Until you you could be a son or a
[55:05] daughter of God, do you know that? And
[55:06] not have a revelation on Jehovah Gyra.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; You haven't come into it yet. There's a
[55:11] lot of people that are still groaning.
[55:14] They groan every time they got to go
[55:16] like this.
[55:22] You see, there's groaning going on, but
[55:25] you're you're you're groaning into the
[55:27] sons and daughters of God. Amen. And
[55:29] there's a there's a fullness of the word
[55:31] that God's made available in this day
[55:33] and in this hour. You will catch a clear
[55:36] revelation of everything that God wants
[55:38] you to have in order to fulfill his
[55:40] purpose because to each is given a
[55:42] portion of faith.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. In order to fulfill
[55:47] their part within the body. But he goes
[55:49] on here. He says to an inheritance
[55:51] incorruptible, undefiled. So it's not
[55:53] something that anybody could alter with.
[55:58] Has to be God. Amen. and that fadeth not
[56:01] away, reserved in heaven for you. Jesus
[56:04] says, "I go to prepare a place for you,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; that where I am, you may be also." What?
[56:12] God doesn't need to prepare houses for
[56:14] us.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about mansions.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the fact that when he
[56:21] rose, our theophies were in him because
[56:25] our theophies are the attributes of God.
[56:29] They are the they are the the the the
[56:31] bodies that he connects with the
[56:34] attribute in order for you to manifest
[56:37] as a man
[56:39] god on earth.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] So here he goes on. He says now reserved
[56:47] in heaven for you who. So who means that
[56:50] that's a person. Who? Not a not what
[56:55] that thing. No, no. Who meaning that
[56:59] it's an actual being, it's an actual
[57:02] expression of God himself who are kept
[57:05] by the power of God through faith unto
[57:09] salvation ready to be revealed
[57:12] in these last days.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; That's why there's a word for us today.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; And this is what we feast on.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; This is what I'm interested in. This is
[57:25] what excites me. Amen. Praise God. That
[57:28] inheritance that's incorruptible. Amen.
[57:30] Praise God. Because God is God is
[57:32] wanting you to be a son that can speak
[57:35] on his behalf. And this is the only age
[57:37] where the full adoption brings you to a
[57:40] place where you become the voice of God
[57:43] &gt;&gt; to the last generation. Amen. Praise
[57:45] God. Mature believers. Amen. Who who
[57:49] have a desire to fulfill the word of
[57:51] God. Not, oh, I don't know about going
[57:53] to church next week. I don't know if I'm
[57:55] going to be able to make it. I don't
[57:56] know about my schedule. I don't know
[57:58] about this. It's always No, no.
[58:00] Everything should be you working it out
[58:04] around
[58:06] your church, around your time with God.
[58:09] This is the hour where the sons of God.
[58:12] They they they they are moving into full
[58:15] manifestation. Amen. Everything else has
[58:18] got to fade away eventually. Everything
[58:20] else is going to fade away. This world
[58:23] is not our home. Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I'm I'm preaching this.
[58:27] It's another thing to live it. But we
[58:28] need to understand who we truly are.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; When you understand your authority, your
[58:34] position, it changes when you pray.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; It gives you a confidence that you can
[58:38] walk up and lay hands on the sick and
[58:41] know that you're not going to heal them,
[58:42] but God can heal them.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of That's why Brother
[58:47] Bram says when she gets to a place where
[58:50] she knows who she is, she'll be an
[58:52] invincible army. Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; For you to come into that into that
[58:59] position as a manifested son. Amen. That
[59:02] inheritance. Praise God. That's
[59:04] undefiled and fadeth not away. Praise
[59:06] God. Hallelujah. Amen. It's our man.
[59:10] It's our time to manifest the word for
[59:13] our day. And it is going to bring to
[59:17] pass the fullness of the body change.
[59:21] Amen. It's going to take us out of this
[59:24] dimension. Glory to God. Let's read on
[59:26] here. Next quote. Listen here. He says,
[59:29] "Now, what do you think?" He's talking
[59:32] about this scripture here. the writer of
[59:34] this book that seen it and seeing where
[59:38] it would be manifested in the last days,
[59:41] waiting for and groaning for those sons
[59:44] of God to rise in the last days with the
[59:46] power of the Holy Ghost at the end of
[59:50] the age to reveal the secret things from
[59:54] the foundation of the world to bring it
[59:57] up. Now, let's go back into the
[59:59] foundation of the world again to get a
[1:00:01] revelation to see if we're right or not.
[1:00:05] Here, brother Brandham. Now, he's he,
[1:00:08] you know, he he's he he he he realizes
[1:00:10] that that, you know, um from the reading
[1:00:14] of these scriptures that we've read
[1:00:15] here, he realizes that there was things
[1:00:18] that were to be revealed through the
[1:00:21] manifestation of these sons of God that
[1:00:24] would come into their position, that
[1:00:26] would recognize who they were. Amen. And
[1:00:28] so he says, he says, "Now these things,
[1:00:31] let's go back to the foundation of the
[1:00:33] world." So now what scripture comes to
[1:00:36] your mind? Job.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Where were you?
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; So let's read the scripture.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; He says here, "Where was thou when I
[1:00:47] laid the foundations of the earth?" Now
[1:00:49] he's talking to Job. Job is going
[1:00:51] through this whole experience, okay?
[1:00:54] this whole experience of losing
[1:00:56] everything, of being completely
[1:00:58] annihilated, his family being destroyed,
[1:01:00] his pets, his cows, his his all his
[1:01:03] herds, everything. God just allowed the
[1:01:06] enemy to just wipe out everything. Amen.
[1:01:09] Glory to God. This is all uh you know,
[1:01:12] this was all in the in the in the plan
[1:01:14] of God. This whole book of Job, you
[1:01:16] can't even really place where this book
[1:01:18] of Job really fits in. And I believe it
[1:01:20] was it was a scenario that God played
[1:01:22] out and and and inspired uh the writer
[1:01:27] uh of this book to to write it so that
[1:01:29] we could understand how God deals with
[1:01:32] sons and daughters. Amen. But he says
[1:01:34] here and he goes and he goes he says,
[1:01:36] "Where were you when I laid the
[1:01:38] foundations of the earth? Declare if
[1:01:40] thou has understanding
[1:01:43] who hath laid the measures thereof if
[1:01:46] thou knowest or who hath stretched the
[1:01:48] line upon it? Whereupon are the
[1:01:50] foundations thereof fastened? Or who
[1:01:53] laid the cornerstone thereof when the
[1:01:56] morning stars sang together and all the
[1:02:00] sons of God shouted for joy?
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; He's talking to Job here in the midst of
[1:02:07] his, you know, this great trial. Amen.
[1:02:10] But he was showing Job something. He was
[1:02:13] giving Job a revelation of who he
[1:02:16] actually was and who Job was. That's why
[1:02:19] Job caught the revelation and knew that
[1:02:22] I will see my redeemer. These these he
[1:02:26] he he knew that he would actually come
[1:02:28] into the manifestation of sunship
[1:02:31] because God revealed something to him.
[1:02:34] But here I want to share something here.
[1:02:37] I was listening to a service by brother
[1:02:41] Aleister Francis. Okay. Who was a pastor
[1:02:44] in South Africa and he's the brother
[1:02:46] that ministered at our youth camp here
[1:02:48] in July at uh brother Danquis many of
[1:02:52] you may remember
[1:02:55] and I was able to meet him and connect
[1:02:57] with him. And so I was listening to to a
[1:02:59] service that he was preaching and as he
[1:03:02] was preaching and in the beginning of
[1:03:03] this service he started to share an
[1:03:06] experience that he had and he said
[1:03:09] um
[1:03:11] I was many years ago and he was laying
[1:03:15] he he was bringing the thought because
[1:03:16] of you just read this scripture. Okay.
[1:03:20] And he says, "Many years ago, Brother
[1:03:22] Isaiah Brooks came to visit us here in
[1:03:26] South Africa and he brought with him
[1:03:29] another minister by the name of John
[1:03:32] Simon."
[1:03:33] And so I was
[1:03:36] directed to be their chauffeur to take
[1:03:40] them to the meetings. And we were taking
[1:03:44] them and I and this is brother
[1:03:45] Alistister saying and I was I was under
[1:03:47] the understanding that brother Isaiah
[1:03:50] Brooks was going to be ministering this
[1:03:52] service.
[1:03:54] And so when we got there, brother Isaiah
[1:03:56] Brooks said, "Oh no, brother." He says,
[1:03:58] "Would you please let John Simon,
[1:04:01] brother John Simon, preach this
[1:04:04] service." And brother Alistister didn't
[1:04:06] know Brother John. He didn't know who he
[1:04:08] was. He got a little bit nervous. He
[1:04:11] says, you know, like because you know,
[1:04:12] like you don't know what, but he says,
[1:04:14] "But I but I knew brother Isaiah." So he
[1:04:17] allowed Brother John to take the
[1:04:19] service.
[1:04:21] And so here now he was explaining and he
[1:04:24] went on to say that that um brother
[1:04:26] Simon took this very scripture from Job
[1:04:29] chapter 38 and he made and he read the
[1:04:32] scripture and then he made a very
[1:04:34] profound statement that brother
[1:04:36] Alistister said never left him. It set
[1:04:40] his mind racing because brother Simon
[1:04:43] went up there read the scripture and he
[1:04:45] made this statement. And he said, "If
[1:04:46] the sons of God shouted back there
[1:04:50] before the foundations of the world,
[1:04:52] then would they not also shout when they
[1:04:55] manifest in the last days?" Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; And he and brother Alistister said it
[1:04:59] just set his mind into a into a uproar
[1:05:03] of thoughts where where he couldn't he
[1:05:06] couldn't he just the whole day he was
[1:05:08] just you know mesmerized by these
[1:05:10] thoughts that had that had gone through
[1:05:11] his mind and and it just blew his his
[1:05:15] thoughts and and he says and it and it
[1:05:17] has never left him. has left and it has
[1:05:19] affected him up until this day where he
[1:05:22] brought this testimony about this actual
[1:05:26] uh uh experience that he had with
[1:05:28] brother Simon ministering the word.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; And so this thought that that you know
[1:05:34] that he was bringing forth I'm listening
[1:05:36] to all of this you know and he says and
[1:05:38] I just you know and I never mentioned
[1:05:40] that it was John Simon at the you know
[1:05:42] through the times that I've ministered
[1:05:43] but he says I want to give flowers now.
[1:05:47] I want to give credit. In other words,
[1:05:48] do where it was because God was
[1:05:51] anointing our pastor. And we know that
[1:05:54] we were under an anointed ministry. We
[1:05:56] know that it was a a spearheading
[1:05:58] ministry. We know that God was revealing
[1:06:01] not the man, but he was surrendered to
[1:06:03] the spirit of God. He he came into the
[1:06:06] revelation of who he was. That he was a
[1:06:09] voice in the last days. He was a son of
[1:06:12] God that was anointed under the
[1:06:14] five-fold ministry. And when you yield
[1:06:16] yourself in that way and you come under
[1:06:18] that kind of surrender, humility, God
[1:06:21] can use you and speak through you.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, while I'm listening to all
[1:06:26] this, you got to understand this all
[1:06:29] happened over the last, you know, maybe
[1:06:31] this happened about four four weeks ago.
[1:06:34] Four Yeah, about four four weeks ago.
[1:06:36] Four, five weeks ago
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; when this all just unfolded pe before
[1:06:41] me. And then I'm starting to look at
[1:06:43] everything and I'm and I'm and the Holy
[1:06:45] Spirit is just showing he says and you
[1:06:47] look at the individuals that were
[1:06:49] involved. Brother Isaiah Brooks, Brother
[1:06:51] John Simon, and here I am in this series
[1:06:55] inspired by a lot of the preaching
[1:06:58] that's been that's that that actually
[1:07:00] brother Alistister is is a teacher in
[1:07:03] the five-fold ministry like no other
[1:07:05] teacher that I've ever heard. I'm just
[1:07:08] gonna give flowers where they deserve.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I recognize that it's
[1:07:13] the five-fold ministry. I recognize that
[1:07:15] it's the mighty angel himself. I
[1:07:17] recognize that God is revealing things
[1:07:19] in this hour to the sons and daughters
[1:07:21] of God through the five-fold ministry
[1:07:24] and that there are individuals that are
[1:07:26] placed. I cannot teach like he teaches.
[1:07:29] Amen. I cannot preach like brother Simon
[1:07:31] preaches. I can but I'm I'm who I am.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Okay? And that's and that's that's what
[1:07:37] I I just want to express who I am. And
[1:07:39] every son or daughter of God can only be
[1:07:42] what God has made you to be. Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; And it's your ability to humble yourself
[1:07:46] and allow the Holy Spirit to use you. So
[1:07:49] all of this is going through my mind.
[1:07:51] And I look at the timing of everything.
[1:07:54] I'm listening to this. He's talking
[1:07:55] about brother Isaiah. Brother Isaiah had
[1:07:57] had uh um called me to ask me to come
[1:08:01] and minister in Iowa. And here this is
[1:08:04] all happening all at the same time. Now,
[1:08:06] while brother Alistister was preaching,
[1:08:09] and this is what really struck me, he
[1:08:11] was talking about how God's attributes
[1:08:14] were in his mind when he was the
[1:08:17] self-existent one, and he had these
[1:08:19] clusters of attributes that would go
[1:08:22] forth in different ages and
[1:08:24] dispensations.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; And he made this statement. He said,
[1:08:29] "Those clusters of attributes will find
[1:08:32] themselves.
[1:08:34] They will unite
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; in the dispensation under the leadership
[1:08:40] of the Holy Spirit under the revealed
[1:08:42] word for their day and for their hour.
[1:08:45] It would bring them into their position
[1:08:48] as adopted sons and daughters of God.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; You I said there's no way. Hey, and I I
[1:08:56] had, you know, I reached out to brother
[1:08:57] Alistister and I, you know, I was
[1:08:59] telling him, brother, like this is just
[1:09:01] remarkable the way this is all
[1:09:03] unfolding. And he says, "Yes, brother.
[1:09:06] It's the family of God. It's the
[1:09:08] clusters. They You couldn't miss. That's
[1:09:11] why I had to come to this church.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; You had to come to this church. Amen.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; If you're one of those clusters that
[1:09:18] went out from God that has to unite with
[1:09:21] the word because the uniting of the word
[1:09:24] IS BRINGING JESUS CHRIST BACK TO earth
[1:09:27] again
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; in bride form in the bride's ministry.
[1:09:32] AND IF YOU'RE A SON or a daughter OF
[1:09:34] GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO FIND YOUR RIGHTFUL
[1:09:36] POSITION IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. AND
[1:09:39] PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SAY, "OH, I just
[1:09:40] going to listen to the tapes." Good for
[1:09:42] you.
[1:09:44] You need to be under a ministry. You
[1:09:46] need to find where God has placed you.
[1:09:49] You need to know that you've got a
[1:09:51] pastor.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God didn't set up the
[1:09:54] five-fold ministry
[1:09:56] just for fun.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Exactly, brother.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; For the perfecting, for the equipping.
[1:10:06] Amen. I can even you can even go back
[1:10:09] and I can show you where quotes in the
[1:10:11] Bible where brother Brandham said that
[1:10:13] the pastor of a local church has supreme
[1:10:16] authority over that church even more
[1:10:19] than if he come into the church
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; and he was the prophet of the age
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; because he understood the offices of the
[1:10:27] pastor. He understood the offices of an
[1:10:29] evangelist of a of a of a a teacher. All
[1:10:32] of those God's those are God's gifts
[1:10:35] that he has that he has given to the
[1:10:37] church for the equipping and the
[1:10:40] perfecting of the body
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; till they all come in. Read the
[1:10:45] Ephesians 4. Till they all come into the
[1:10:47] unity of the faith, the revelation of
[1:10:51] Christ.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The body of Christ. Glory to God.
[1:10:55] And so this whole experience that I had
[1:10:59] and and seeing how God was working all
[1:11:02] of this out and hearing, you know, and I
[1:11:03] shared it with brother Simon and he was
[1:11:05] just hallelujah. Praise God. This is the
[1:11:08] attribute sons of God coming into the
[1:11:11] unity understanding what the word is is
[1:11:14] producing in this day and in this hour.
[1:11:17] Glory to God. Listen, I hope I haven't
[1:11:19] lost you. You guys still with me?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:11:24] This is that third pull. Hallelujah.
[1:11:27] Listen, I'm not going to get into all
[1:11:29] that element right now, but this is that
[1:11:31] third pull. It's the unveiling of that
[1:11:33] seal. Amen. It's the opening of the word
[1:11:36] to the sons and daughters of God. And
[1:11:38] they're all personally coming into their
[1:11:41] positions and understanding where they
[1:11:44] fit in the mystery.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. We're winding this
[1:11:49] down. Let's go to the next uh quote
[1:11:51] here. He says here in the hand of the
[1:11:54] Lord came upon me. The hand of the Lord
[1:11:57] 1954 he says why I said about God spoke
[1:12:00] to Job one day and he said Job where was
[1:12:04] you when I laid the foundations of the
[1:12:06] world tell me what what they're they're
[1:12:09] fastened unto said what when the morning
[1:12:12] stars sang together and the sons of God
[1:12:15] shouted for joy a hundred million years
[1:12:18] before the world was ever formed they
[1:12:21] had shouting religion. Oh my goodness.
[1:12:25] Glory to God. I'm not going to get into
[1:12:26] this today.
[1:12:29] This is going to be for next week. Amen.
[1:12:32] But here he's talking about then talk
[1:12:35] about something new. Why? It's the
[1:12:37] oldest there is. You see, God ain't
[1:12:40] going to use anything different. You
[1:12:42] see, sons of God shouted. HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; THEY SHOUTED. WHY WERE THEY SHOUTING?
[1:12:48] BECAUSE THEY HAD SOMETHING TO SHOUT.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. AND I BELIEVE
[1:12:53] THEY'RE SONS OF GOD IN THIS HOUR.
[1:12:55] THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING THEY need to
[1:12:56] shout.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Glory to God. He says,
[1:13:00] "Then talk about something new. Why?
[1:13:01] It's the oldest there is and the only
[1:13:03] kind that there really is." Yeah. It's
[1:13:06] the oldfashioned heartfelt sky blue
[1:13:09] sinkilling religion, brother. It don't
[1:13:12] whitewash you. IT WASHES YOU WHITE from
[1:13:15] the inside out. Yes, it does.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. would make you
[1:13:20] do things you didn't think you ever
[1:13:22] could.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; You're going to see and recognize and do
[1:13:26] things that you never thought were
[1:13:27] possible.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Let's read the
[1:13:31] next quote here. I'm winding it down. He
[1:13:33] says, "What was he? In the beginning was
[1:13:35] the word. The word was with God and the
[1:13:37] word was God. And the word was made
[1:13:39] flesh. And he said, "You condemn me
[1:13:42] because I call myself the son of God.
[1:13:45] And it's written in your laws that ye
[1:13:47] are gods." Man was made to be a god.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. This was God's plan.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; His domain is the earth.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The whole EARTH IS AWAITING
[1:14:00] NOW FOR THE MANIFESTATION of the sons of
[1:14:02] God to be made manifest. Look how far
[1:14:05] behind we are. But remember the
[1:14:08] prophets. He said if you call them gods
[1:14:11] who the word of God came to. Amen.
[1:14:14] Praise God. God is manifesting himself
[1:14:18] in sons
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; in this hour.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:14:25] Next quote. He says here, "It is I." And
[1:14:28] this sign was to return, not an ark, but
[1:14:32] God dwelling in the flesh of his people
[1:14:36] in his church.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. See, Jesus said, "Amen.
[1:14:42] At that day, you'll know that I'm in the
[1:14:44] Father, the Father in me, and I in you,
[1:14:48] and you in me. And it's God in you. All
[1:14:52] that God was, he poured into Christ. And
[1:14:56] all that Christ was, he poured into the
[1:14:58] church. And so, it's God above us, God
[1:15:01] with us, God in us. No wonder we are
[1:15:04] commissioned to baptize using Father,
[1:15:06] Son, and Holy Ghost. Not three different
[1:15:08] gods, three offices of one God. See, God
[1:15:12] above us, God in the Father, God in us,
[1:15:15] with us in the Son, cleansing his way,
[1:15:19] condescending, coming down, making a way
[1:15:22] that he could get back and bring his
[1:15:25] people back to make manifested sons of
[1:15:29] God. You see, it's not until we reunite
[1:15:32] with our theophony bodies that we come
[1:15:34] into the full manifestation of the sons
[1:15:38] of God. Because then our theophony is
[1:15:41] the body that we will possess which is
[1:15:44] an eternal body
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; so that we can dwell and rule with him
[1:15:49] here on the earth. Glory to God. He says
[1:15:52] just he says uh uh uh condescending
[1:15:55] coming down make back his people to make
[1:15:57] manifest his sons of God like they had
[1:15:59] them in the garden of Eden.
[1:16:02] The whole world is groaning and waiting
[1:16:04] for that hour for the manifestation of
[1:16:07] the sons of God.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come. I'm going to
[1:16:11] read one scripture
[1:16:14] and one final quote
[1:16:16] in John 1 John 1:es
[1:16:20] 1:2.
[1:16:23] He goes on and he says, "Behold, what
[1:16:25] manner of love the Father hath bestowed
[1:16:28] upon us that we should be called the
[1:16:31] sons of God."
[1:16:34] But he says, "Therefore, the world
[1:16:36] knoweth us not because it knew him not."
[1:16:41] You see, unless you know
[1:16:43] that you've got a father,
[1:16:46] how can you be a son?
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; You need to know the father.
[1:16:51] You need to know where you came from.
[1:16:53] You need to know the plan of God. You
[1:16:55] need to know that he wants you to know
[1:16:58] that it's it's I in you, your hope of
[1:17:01] glory. Like we read at the beginning,
[1:17:03] beloved, now are we the sons of God. And
[1:17:07] it doth not appear what we shall be, but

[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Listen here in this final quote. He
[1:17:29] says, "Tell me brother, my brother, tell
[1:17:32] me my sister, when was the time that the
[1:17:35] sons of God was ever to be manifested
[1:17:37] outside of this time?" Now
[1:17:41] when there when when was when were there
[1:17:44] ever a time in history that was to
[1:17:46] manifest the time to deliver all nature?
[1:17:50] Nature the nature itself is groaning
[1:17:53] waiting for the time of the
[1:17:54] manifestation. Why? Before the atonement
[1:17:57] was made, before the Holy Ghost was even
[1:18:00] poured out, before all the Old Testament
[1:18:03] on down there, there could have been
[1:18:05] manifestations.
[1:18:07] It had to wait till this time.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He says, "Now all
[1:18:15] things has been brought, coming, shaping
[1:18:18] up to the headstone. Glory to God. to
[1:18:20] the manifestations of the sons of God
[1:18:23] coming back and the spirit of God coming
[1:18:26] into these men so perfectly until their
[1:18:31] ministry will be so close like Christ
[1:18:34] till it will join him and his church
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; together.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
