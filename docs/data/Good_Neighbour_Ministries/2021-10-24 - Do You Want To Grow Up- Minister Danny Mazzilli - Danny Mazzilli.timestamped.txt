[16:47] spirit of god
[16:51] [Music]
[17:01] a chance to speak the
[17:02] word he said you are the god that
[17:06] healed all our disease
[17:08] and our disease was unbelief
[17:11] and you've healed it you sent your word
[17:12] and you've healed our unbelief lord

[17:52] so high and steel and everything it
[17:54] looked impenetrable it looked like it
[17:56] was an impossible thing but

[19:42] to testify uh

[19:51] testifying but we're gonna give him a
[19:53] few minutes and uh lord
[19:56] just bless us
[19:59] with faith that all things are possible
[20:01] if we only believe
[20:02] praise god i was reading a little quote
[20:04] on the wall in the school i work in they
[20:07] said if you believe
[20:09] you can do anything
[20:11] what kind of dogma is that
[20:15] i can't do nothing
[20:18] but i believe with him when all things
[20:20] are possible he can do everything amen
[20:22] so it's not about what you and i can do
[20:25] praise god it's about what the lord
[20:26] jesus is doing through us
[20:28] in this hour amen
[20:35] praise the lord
[20:38] what
[20:40] praise the lord

[20:45] face of the air so when you come to the
[20:47] house of the lord prepare to worship
[20:50] hallelujah our god is real
[20:53] this morning
[20:55] i'm going to read the latest scripture
[20:57] here
[20:57] john
[20:58] c john chapter 16
[21:01] verse 22
[21:02] to
[21:04] 24
[21:05] i i i yi now therefore have sorrow but i
[21:11] will see you again
[21:12] and your heart shall rejoice and your
[21:15] joy no mind take it away from you
[21:18] and in that day shall ask me nothing
[21:22] very very i say unto you whatsoever you
[21:25] shall ask the father in my name
[21:29] he would give it to you
[21:33] hello
[21:34] have he asked nothing in my name ask and
[21:37] you shall receive that your joy
[21:40] may be full
[21:42] hallelujah
[21:45] i just want to give a testimony this is
[21:48] a
[21:49] i kind of shocked
[21:51] i
[21:52] my my uncle died
[21:55] and then he was 120 years old
[21:58] he was a train with my mother
[22:03] so
[22:04] i left
[22:06] and went to ghana for funeral
[22:08] when i reached there the funeral
[22:13] everything was fantastic
[22:17] what i saw is wherever
[22:20] i know the brethren were praying and i
[22:22] prayed
[22:24] right now with them in the middle of 40
[22:26] days of prayer there is a purpose for
[22:28] that everybody open your mind your ear
[22:32] get into it
[22:35] uh
[22:36] so
[22:37] and ghana right now is a lot of rain
[22:41] so the people say oh
[22:43] and the ghana the way they do their
[22:44] funerals is is open park
[22:48] that's why it's not here we go inside
[22:50] the room no
[22:51] so they all the people but maybe two or
[22:53] three hundred people come together and
[22:55] support you
[22:56] so
[22:57] when i read that they said it's a lot of
[22:59] rain
[23:00] that
[23:01] maybe we cannot have a chance to do it
[23:05] and that's why i'm talking about the
[23:07] prayer we prayed
[23:09] brothers prayed brother simon prayed
[23:13] and when i i from accra to kumasi as
[23:16] soon as when i left accra there was no
[23:19] rain
[23:20] when i arrived kumasi as soon as i put
[23:23] my my key on my door
[23:26] heavy rain came
[23:29] that time
[23:30] the following day i left my village
[23:34] when i left my village
[23:36] as soon as i left kumasi to my village
[23:40] it rained all night to the following day
[23:43] my village no rain
[23:46] so the
[23:47] funeral has started and everybody
[23:49] thought that
[23:51] it's not gonna work
[23:53] and where we started the whole around
[23:56] the area
[23:57] everywhere was written but my place
[24:00] there was no raid
[24:02] so that's what the prayer
[24:05] is about
[24:08] and then
[24:10] we did two days
[24:11] and after sunday we went to the service
[24:15] we came and prepared
[24:17] about seven o'clock the heavy rain came
[24:20] down
[24:21] after we finished everything having rain
[24:24] came down
[24:26] and
[24:27] when we went miami coffee and bradford
[24:29] when we set up we baptize people in my
[24:32] village there so we set up a church and
[24:34] when the covert came
[24:36] he dismantled them so when when all the
[24:39] people came in their heart was into god
[24:42] when are we going to say wait
[24:45] god
[24:46] gonna give you somebody
[24:48] so wait
[24:49] so i spoke to them and i called my
[24:52] my nephew
[24:54] that he was drunk to death and we pray
[24:57] for him
[24:58] that time and then
[25:01] god helped him to stop the drinking
[25:04] and later on
[25:05] after the covenant you went back heavily
[25:07] drinking
[25:09] so
[25:10] i said you disgrace god
[25:12] he came and said sorry i said no not me
[25:15] you disgrace god
[25:17] so you have to go to god and talk to him
[25:20] it's not me i have nothing to do with it
[25:23] so
[25:25] when i came back here
[25:28] i came back here my sister called me
[25:30] did you pray for
[25:32] your nephew i said no i talked to him
[25:36] he said that day when you left over the
[25:39] night
[25:42] happened to that boy
[25:44] he was there and he said
[25:47] i i swallow bone i'm choking i'm choking
[25:50] and
[25:52] he vomit so bad they thought he was
[25:55] there they thought they have to take him
[25:57] to the hospital
[25:59] my knee said no leave him
[26:01] all of a sudden he was then he stood up
[26:05] and began
[26:06] to beg god to forgive him
[26:09] for everything that he has done
[26:11] he has failed him he has failed me he
[26:14] has failed all my uncle and stuff like
[26:16] that
[26:17] about two o'clock
[26:19] he cried and repented to a crook and
[26:23] from that time after now when is she
[26:25] drink he cannot touch drink anymore
[26:29] so god is real
[26:32] as you are sitting here
[26:34] god is real
[26:38] and then
[26:41] i think a year and a year and a half ago
[26:43] we went to ghana can you put a picture
[26:46] on there on the border
[26:52] yes
[26:53] everybody look at who is sitting down
[26:55] there

[27:04] brother this month sitting down there
[27:07] praise god
[27:08] see there's a baby on my laps
[27:11] that baby there
[27:13] when we went to ghana
[27:18] me brother coffee
[27:20] a young man over here called
[27:23] his daughter they married almost 10
[27:26] years they can't have children
[27:29] so
[27:30] he he urged her daughter to come and see
[27:33] me and brother phillip and brother kofi
[27:36] so she managed to came we sat down with
[27:39] her we opened the bible
[27:41] and we talked to her and we asked her if
[27:44] god give you a baby you're gonna give
[27:46] that baby to god
[27:47] or you're gonna serve god he said yes
[27:50] then
[27:52] we prayed with her and we came a year a
[27:55] year later
[27:56] the baby came out so when i went there
[27:59] they brought that baby for me to
[28:00] dedicate that baby to the lord so that
[28:02] baby you see there that's the baby that
[28:04] we pray for
[28:06] that's what a prayer can do
[28:09] christian without prayer you are not a
[28:12] christian
[28:13] hallelujah

[28:17] you see the manifestation of god the
[28:20] bible says your joy may be full how come
[28:22] your joy before when you see the
[28:25] manifestation of the word of god
[28:27] imprinting your eye that's your joy

[44:26] been getting so blessed in the study of
[44:28] it and seeing what what it is that he's

[44:37] slide there
[44:38] um so we're gonna be talking today about
[44:41] 40 days of prayer this is um uh
[44:44] something that you will have to
[44:46] participate in it's entirely up to you
[44:50] you will get directly back
[44:53] what you give to it in your time your
[44:56] sincerity
[44:57] your your prayer time with the lord your
[45:00] fellowship with one another your
[45:02] attendance in the ministry
[45:04] in the services on the wednesday nights
[45:06] the sunday services and even the friday
[45:09] night services the prayer meetings on
[45:12] friday nights this has all been
[45:15] beautifully put together
[45:17] so that we can just get into such a
[45:20] momentum
[45:21] that you will build
[45:24] you will build i've just been doing this
[45:26] for the last week and i'm i'm just blown
[45:29] away by the momentum that's starting to
[45:32] build in my life amen it you will see
[45:36] what can happen you see
[45:38] you just got to know that god is real
[45:41] you just got to know that you know this
[45:43] is not a program this is not about you
[45:46] know about doing uh you know let's let's
[45:48] just throw a program into the church and
[45:51] let's just you know decide that you know
[45:52] it'll kill 40 days for us and it'll give
[45:55] the minister some things to talk about
[45:57] no no no this is not what this is all
[45:59] about
[46:01] this is this is because you are under
[46:04] the revelation of this hour knowing what
[46:06] jesus christ is doing now
[46:09] everything that he brings to us
[46:12] as as those that are revelated by the
[46:15] word of god has a purpose
[46:18] it has a dramatic purpose
[46:20] in your life and these next 40 days
[46:24] are gonna be
[46:25] so that we can
[46:27] intensely
[46:30] grow spiritually
[46:34] you need to grow
[46:35] spiritually
[46:37] you are in this human realm here
[46:40] and you are so distracted by the things
[46:43] of life
[46:44] the cares of this world
[46:46] the cares of your work your job your
[46:48] family your health your wealth it's
[46:51] constantly bombarding your mind
[46:54] and you are under constant oppression
[46:57] because of this life
[46:59] but god wants you now to separate for 40
[47:02] days
[47:03] it's not that you're going to stop
[47:04] working you're going to keep doing all
[47:06] the things that you're doing but you are
[47:08] going to focus you are going to
[47:10] participate you are going to dedicate
[47:13] yourself you're going to make a covenant
[47:15] with the lord and with your brothers and
[47:18] sisters together that you will dedicate
[47:20] these next 40 days
[47:22] to change to spiritual growth so that
[47:26] you can change something in your life i
[47:29] don't know what's in your life right now
[47:31] that is really hindering you but there's
[47:33] something
[47:35] every single one of us has circumstances
[47:38] and situations in our lives that we need
[47:42] change
[47:43] we don't want them anymore we want to
[47:45] release those things we don't want them
[47:47] to have control over our lives anymore
[47:51] you might have trouble with with with
[47:53] you know with swearing i don't know
[47:55] you might have trouble with with uh
[47:58] relationships
[48:00] you know one of the greatest things
[48:02] about prayer
[48:04] and why god wants to wants you to pray
[48:07] is because it brings you into that
[48:09] relationship
[48:11] and you get to know how much he loves
[48:13] you amen amen
[48:15] you are going to know how much god loves
[48:18] you in these next 40 days
[48:21] we've heard about how much he loves us
[48:23] but it's different when you get intimate
[48:25] with him
[48:26] when you get pro when you get down and
[48:28] you start bringing your needs before him
[48:31] under a different uh revelation not just
[48:34] by
[48:35] you get up in the morning you get down
[48:37] on your knees say lord bless me today
[48:39] you know i need this i need that i need
[48:41] to just give him a list of things that
[48:42] you need
[48:45] meanwhile you don't even sit there long
[48:46] enough for him to tell you how
[48:50] you can get those things
[48:52] how you can grow
[48:54] how you can receive the things because
[48:56] sometimes we just miss it god has a way
[48:59] to bless you and you don't understand
[49:02] sometimes how he speaks because you
[49:05] don't listen long enough you don't stay
[49:07] there long enough
[49:09] amen praise god let's go to slide number
[49:12] one
[49:14] but before we do i want to offer up a
[49:16] word of prayer
[49:17] as we enter into this
[49:19] i also want to remember uh our brother
[49:21] gabriel lamp lemthu
[49:24] his wife passed away about a year ago
[49:27] this month
[49:28] okay and we just want to remember his
[49:30] family his children that the lord will
[49:33] just strengthen them and bless them and
[49:35] allow them to move forward and and
[49:37] prosper i believe that these next 40
[49:40] days if they really seek the lord they
[49:43] will find peace
[49:45] in god's perfect will for their lives
[49:47] amen let's pray father
[49:48] we are so blessed this morning lord we
[49:51] cannot possibly
[49:53] even word put to words father how
[49:57] privileged we are as your children this
[50:00] morning that we can approach you the
[50:02] living god
[50:03] that's present that loves us that wants
[50:06] to bless us that's concerned about every
[50:09] little thing but lord sometimes we get
[50:11] so caught up
[50:12] in the circumstance that we just don't
[50:15] we don't ask we don't we don't reach we
[50:17] we don't we don't come to you lord and
[50:20] father this next 40 days father may our
[50:23] lives be changed as a result of this may
[50:25] those that are hearing out in in youtube
[50:29] you know that are that are tuning in
[50:30] father where wherever they are whoever
[50:32] they are lord made us such an anointing
[50:36] go out from these services over these
[50:39] next 40 days that they would receive a
[50:42] blessing and their lives would be
[50:43] changed they would be delivered they
[50:45] would see life differently they would
[50:47] find peace and happiness and not be so
[50:50] caught up with the circumstances of this
[50:52] world lord meet every need remember our
[50:55] pastor strengthen him encourage him his
[50:58] family his wife lord just prosper them
[51:01] in a supernatural way we pray
[51:04] grant it now in jesus name amen and amen
[51:07] praise god
[51:09] so
[51:10] you know um
[51:12] we look here at the scripture in
[51:13] ephesians chapter 4 verse 14. it says
[51:17] now these are different versions of the
[51:20] scripture and how it's read but you will
[51:22] see that there's truth there we are not
[51:25] meant to remain as children at the mercy
[51:27] of every chance wind of teaching
[51:30] instead
[51:31] we are meant to hold firmly to the truth
[51:34] in love
[51:35] and grow up
[51:37] every
[51:39] way
[51:40] into christ
[51:43] we're not to remain as children listen
[51:45] you know if you are an adult today and
[51:48] you're still a child that's never grown
[51:51] up that's a sad condition to be in
[51:54] if you're a spiritual child in christ
[51:56] that's one thing that you've just come
[51:58] to christ
[52:00] but there is no way that you can remain
[52:02] that way you have to grow
[52:05] you have to spiritually grow there has
[52:08] to be spiritual growth you know because
[52:11] because if you don't grow you don't
[52:12] mature
[52:14] you see your children right we've all
[52:16] been through it we see them go through
[52:18] certain stages when they come to us you
[52:20] know when they're asking for things they
[52:23] just they just blame ass they don't know
[52:25] what's good for them they don't have any
[52:27] idea they could ask for a for for the
[52:29] for a super sharp knife that's on the
[52:32] wall that you use for hunting dad i want
[52:34] to play with that
[52:35] obviously you're not going to give it to
[52:37] them but they don't know they don't
[52:39] understand they're still children as
[52:40] they grow they start to develop you know
[52:43] certain attitudes and then they have
[52:46] certain desires and then they want to
[52:47] make certain decisions and you know as
[52:50] teenagers you know
[52:52] i i like i'm just going to say it the
[52:53] way it is when i was 16 i was really
[52:56] stupid
[52:58] i made a lot of stupid decisions
[53:01] when my dad said no don't do it i said
[53:05] i'm gonna do it
[53:07] and i paid the price
[53:09] and you can go back in your own life you
[53:11] know
[53:12] when you when you start to get more
[53:13] mature
[53:15] and you grow up then that maturity
[53:17] causes you to make the right decisions
[53:21] you know how to approach situations you
[53:24] don't make dumb decisions because that's
[53:26] a result of immaturity
[53:28] and that's what's happened with a lot of
[53:30] people they make stupid dumbest
[53:33] decisions while even serving the lord
[53:37] it's because they're immature
[53:40] but you're going to have an opportunity
[53:42] to spiritually grow in so many ways over
[53:45] these next 40 days that you will be
[53:47] immensely blessed
[53:49] let's go to slide number two
[53:52] the bible tells us that growth is god's
[53:55] will for your life
[53:58] babies are cute kids are cute but a
[54:00] child that doesn't grow up that's not
[54:02] cute
[54:04] amen you still got a lot of listen we're
[54:06] living in a world right now you go into
[54:08] some homes and you know the parents are
[54:10] 70 years old and they still got 35 year
[54:12] old children
[54:15] kids
[54:17] acting like spoiled brats
[54:20] why because they haven't grown up they
[54:22] haven't matured
[54:24] they're staying in a state of mind in a
[54:26] state of in a condition in their mind
[54:29] because they're they're they're being
[54:30] stubborn they don't want to grow they
[54:32] don't want to do the things that are
[54:33] necessary in order to develop properly
[54:36] disciplined new habits so that things
[54:39] can get better
[54:41] you know you're a creature of habit
[54:43] amen
[54:44] it is impossible to grow old
[54:48] it is possible to grow old and never
[54:50] grow up
[54:52] but our title today is do you want to
[54:54] grow up
[54:56] are you looking to grow maturely you
[54:58] know into into a walk with god that
[55:00] that's going to enhance everything

[55:08] change your your relationships you can
[55:10] change your your your financial position
[55:12] you can change all these things if you
[55:16] truly sincerely focus over these next 40
[55:19] days amen you want to be a really strong
[55:23] spiritually strong man or woman then
[55:25] listen to the things that you will be
[55:28] taught over these next 40 days
[55:31] participate
[55:33] amen
[55:35] growth is god's will ephesians chapter 4
[55:38] there on your on the outline at the top
[55:41] verse 14 says we are not meant to remain
[55:43] as children
[55:44] at the mercy of every wind of teaching
[55:48] in other words you just fall for
[55:50] anything
[55:51] when you're immature
[55:53] instead
[55:55] we're meant to hold firmly to the truth
[55:58] in love and to grow up in every way into
[56:02] christ we're not meant to remain as
[56:04] children but we're meant to grow up
[56:07] i want you to circle the word
[56:10] grow up in your mind
[56:12] circle it right now visually
[56:14] grow up amen
[56:17] what is the perfect picture of maturity
[56:20] look at jesus
[56:21] jesus is the ultimate picture of
[56:24] spiritual emotional
[56:26] intellectual maturity
[56:28] to have the thoughts of christ and know
[56:31] how to respond like he did
[56:33] will be a whole lot better in your life
[56:36] wow what a powerful thing that you would
[56:39] be able to
[56:40] deal with circumstances and situations
[56:43] the way that jesus would
[56:46] you know when jesus was on the earth
[56:50] the jews
[56:51] they were hearing oh the messiah is
[56:52] coming
[56:54] messiah is coming
[56:55] but messiah is supposed to come
[56:57] and destroy
[56:59] this this this government the romans
[57:02] destroy them
[57:04] they got carried away they started to
[57:06] think that you know that th that all the
[57:08] governments had conspiracies uh on them
[57:11] and and that and that and that that they
[57:13] were gonna get wiped out and yes all
[57:16] those things all those conspiracies all
[57:18] those listen this world
[57:21] these governments
[57:23] go back to the scripture jesus went into
[57:26] the wilderness for 40 days
[57:29] and he met face to face with satan
[57:32] and satan told him to bow before him
[57:36] that if he would bow before him he'd
[57:38] give him all the kingdoms of the world
[57:41] he says they're mine
[57:43] i'll give them to you if you bow before
[57:45] jesus said get behind me satan
[57:48] what are you talking about
[57:50] but he is
[57:52] like let's just tell it the way it is
[57:54] all the governments and all the oh
[57:56] listen they're trying to do the best
[57:57] that they can but let me tell you who's
[57:59] behind it all right
[58:02] the bible says he's the he's the god of
[58:04] this evil age
[58:07] he rules the governments he's
[58:08] controlling the governments you know
[58:10] that
[58:11] but you as a son or a daughter of god
[58:14] should not be getting caught up into
[58:16] that
[58:17] because your position is not to do with
[58:20] anything with them
[58:23] your position as a son or a daughter of
[58:25] god in this world
[58:27] is to feed on the word of god and allow
[58:31] the word to fulfill its purpose in your
[58:34] life
[58:37] you've got a supernatural calling upon
[58:40] your life as a son or a daughter of god
[58:44] people are getting caught up
[58:47] with the
[58:48] vaccine they become anti-vaxxers to the
[58:51] point where even the churches even the
[58:53] churches in this message imagine they're
[58:56] getting caught up into the government
[58:58] situations the controls the systems of
[59:01] this world
[59:02] thinking oh well we're not gonna we
[59:05] aren't taking the vaccine what the
[59:07] heck's the difference between the
[59:08] vaccine and a tetanus shot
[59:11] will somebody tell me
[59:14] yeah there's a there's a virus so they
[59:16] got a vaccine for the virus brother
[59:18] brown says vaccine virus take the
[59:20] vaccine
[59:22] he had to do certain things when he went
[59:24] on trips you know my my one of my
[59:27] motives for forgetting it was because i
[59:28] want to travel
[59:30] i don't want to be bound by nothing
[59:33] if god wants to allow me to travel i'm
[59:35] going to travel
[59:36] i'm not going to be controlled by any
[59:38] government
[59:40] and so if i need a vaccine
[59:42] i don't fear any vaccine
[59:45] if you're a son or a daughter of god you
[59:47] shouldn't fear anything like that
[59:50] [Applause]
[59:52] why would you fear it
[59:54] but i'm not also going out there and
[59:56] every single person that i see you've
[59:57] got no vaccine you're gonna die
[1:00:02] what business what all of a sudden i'm
[1:00:04] god that i can tell that i can tell
[1:00:06] who's going to die and who's not going
[1:00:07] to die
[1:00:09] come on saints let's get let's we want
[1:00:11] to mature here we want to grow up
[1:00:14] we don't want to get caught up into
[1:00:16] these these circumstances about the
[1:00:18] vaccine or no vaccine or i'm not taking
[1:00:21] it you're not taking it listen
[1:00:23] we're saying that there's still sons and
[1:00:25] daughters of god out there
[1:00:27] the government is saying you need to
[1:00:29] take the vaccine take it amen what's the
[1:00:32] big deal if you're a son or a daughter
[1:00:33] of god you should not fear any of that
[1:00:36] you want to move on with the program of
[1:00:38] god because there's people who still
[1:00:40] need to come into the household of faith
[1:00:43] okay if they want to come here they got
[1:00:45] to get vaccinated but if they're really
[1:00:47] revelated by the word of god they don't
[1:00:49] fear any of that
[1:00:51] they know that nothing can take them
[1:00:53] only god he's purposed
[1:00:55] a season a time and a season for all
[1:00:58] things in your life has a time and a

[1:01:57] he said love your enemy
[1:02:01] he says there's a time and a season for
[1:02:03] all things
[1:02:05] you just don't know what time it is
[1:02:07] you don't know who you're talking to
[1:02:10] you don't even realize who's standing
[1:02:11] here
[1:02:12] you think that i'm here and you're
[1:02:14] trying to tell me what it's supposed to
[1:02:15] be
[1:02:17] he was god in human flesh here on the
[1:02:19] earth
[1:02:20] he came for a purpose
[1:02:22] amen praise god hallelujah what happened
[1:02:25] to those jews they all got
[1:02:27] messed up a lot of them got killed
[1:02:29] a lot of them got so caught up into the
[1:02:31] things of the world they got snared by
[1:02:34] all the controversies by all the all the
[1:02:37] different uh you know um
[1:02:40] things that they're saying and oh we're
[1:02:42] gonna be put into concentration camps
[1:02:44] they're gonna they're you know they're
[1:02:45] injecting us with these things oh my god
[1:02:48] i don't want to hear it anymore
[1:02:50] it has nothing to do with us
[1:02:53] we're in the world but we're not of the
[1:02:55] world
[1:02:56] we are walking with god
[1:02:58] through a pandemic
[1:03:00] but we walk with god and if you're
[1:03:02] walking with him what do you fear why
[1:03:05] would you fear
[1:03:06] amen praise god forevermore hallelujah
[1:03:12] uh but you know in in this coming week
[1:03:16] in these next 40 days
[1:03:19] you want to understand the purpose
[1:03:20] behind it and you want to understand
[1:03:22] that there are laws of spiritual growth
[1:03:25] and that you have to understand these
[1:03:28] laws of spiritual growth
[1:03:30] and what is required of you to
[1:03:32] spiritually grow
[1:03:35] there's laws that control the universe
[1:03:37] there's the law of gravity
[1:03:39] these are laws that were placed here for
[1:03:41] a purpose and as long as you are in this
[1:03:44] thing here
[1:03:45] you're going to have to bring it under
[1:03:47] obedience to the laws of god's word
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:51] you're going to do your best
[1:03:54] and you're going to let god do the rest
[1:03:57] because as a human being you you you
[1:04:00] can't do
[1:04:01] everything that god requires of you
[1:04:04] so don't think that you are invincible
[1:04:07] in that you know in this human flesh
[1:04:09] here you're still you're still
[1:04:11] susceptible to all the things that go on
[1:04:13] out there
[1:04:15] okay you got to be careful you got to
[1:04:17] make the right decisions
[1:04:19] you're still under free moral agency to
[1:04:21] make certain decisions
[1:04:23] but i'm hoping that for the next 40 days
[1:04:26] and that it's going to create such a
[1:04:28] habit in you that it is going to change
[1:04:29] your life forever
[1:04:31] and bring you into a closer walk with
[1:04:33] god that you will do these things amen
[1:04:36] praise god
[1:04:38] you know god has a way
[1:04:40] if you want to grow you've got to
[1:04:42] cooperate with these laws
[1:04:46] it's just
[1:04:47] it's in the word you're going to see it
[1:04:49] it's all over the word
[1:04:51] at the end of the service today you're
[1:04:53] going to receive a handout which you
[1:04:55] know basically outlines and covers the
[1:04:57] things that that that we're going to

[1:05:23] you need to feed on this every single
[1:05:26] day you don't just come in here on
[1:05:28] sunday
[1:05:29] and decide oh that's good enough
[1:05:32] no sir it ain't good enough
[1:05:34] that ain't gonna be even close to good
[1:05:36] enough can you imagine that you just all
[1:05:38] you do is you go eat one day sunday you
[1:05:41] go to a big buffet you fill yourself and
[1:05:44] then you don't eat for the rest of the
[1:05:46] week
[1:05:47] good luck
[1:05:49] you're going to have all kinds of of
[1:05:51] health issues
[1:05:53] but you need to eat a little every day
[1:05:56] you need to feed every day on the word
[1:05:59] of god amen praise god
[1:06:02] every single day slide number four
[1:06:03] matthew 4 4 jesus says people need
[1:06:07] more than bread
[1:06:09] for their life
[1:06:11] they need bread and a little bit of tuna
[1:06:13] with it
[1:06:15] is that what it says
[1:06:16] no
[1:06:17] it says you need the bread of god's word
[1:06:21] you need god's word you need to feed
[1:06:24] constantly he says people need more than
[1:06:26] bread for their life they must feed on
[1:06:28] the word of god that's what god wants
[1:06:30] you to do is to feed on it a little bit
[1:06:34] every single day amen glory to god we
[1:06:38] want to help you develop that habit
[1:06:40] through these next 40 days
[1:06:42] that's what we want to do we want you to
[1:06:45] understand that you're going to need to
[1:06:46] feed every single day on god's word amen
[1:06:50] and notice all
[1:06:52] the blessings that god has for his
[1:06:55] people come
[1:06:57] from you feeding on the word of grace
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:02] would you like to have all the blessings
[1:07:03] that god has for you
[1:07:06] you know as your brother your friend
[1:07:08] your spiritual coach
[1:07:10] one of your spiritual coaches
[1:07:13] we've got our pastor we've got other
[1:07:14] brothers here administering brothers
[1:07:16] we want you
[1:07:18] to have uh uh you know uh
[1:07:21] all the blessings that god has for you
[1:07:23] we want you to we want you to to benefit
[1:07:26] from every aspect of these next 40 days
[1:07:30] and so you're going to need to
[1:07:31] participate you're going to need to be a
[1:07:33] part of it
[1:07:34] you know there are some gifts that god
[1:07:36] wants to give you but he's waiting for
[1:07:39] you to grow up
[1:07:41] before he gives them to you it's like
[1:07:43] our children we can't be giving them
[1:07:45] certain gifts
[1:07:46] when they're too young
[1:07:48] but as they mature and they get older
[1:07:50] then you know we start to receive you
[1:07:53] know we start to put things into their
[1:07:54] hand knowing that they're mature enough
[1:07:56] to handle the gifts that we give them
[1:07:59] well god wants to activate your gifts
[1:08:02] he wants to activate your position in
[1:08:04] the body of christ
[1:08:06] we all have a position in the word of
[1:08:08] god and we need to find it but how we
[1:08:11] find it is by feeding on the word
[1:08:13] participating in the word hearing the
[1:08:15] word and receiving the faith that
[1:08:18] activates the word in you
[1:08:21] amen
[1:08:23] so number five
[1:08:26] the word of grace is able to build you
[1:08:28] up and give you all blessings that god
[1:08:31] has for his people
[1:08:38] so
[1:08:39] it's important for you to feed now if
[1:08:41] you come here on sunday
[1:08:43] and you
[1:08:44] feed on the word
[1:08:45] guess what
[1:08:47] if that's all you do
[1:08:49] 95 of everything that i'm saying up here
[1:08:52] by wednesday night you're going to
[1:08:53] forget it
[1:08:56] that's just a fact
[1:08:58] because you have to do more than just
[1:09:01] one service
[1:09:03] one sermon
[1:09:04] you've got to build momentum that's what
[1:09:06] we're doing here these next 40 days are
[1:09:09] for you to build momentum
[1:09:11] so that you don't just forget you know
[1:09:13] in the first 72 hours
[1:09:15] you know
[1:09:16] everything
[1:09:17] that you were
[1:09:19] preached on sunday that's pretty
[1:09:21] depressing for the pastor you know that
[1:09:23] to know that you know if his people are
[1:09:25] not doing
[1:09:26] something on a daily basis to continue
[1:09:28] to feed on the word and and and have
[1:09:31] that relationship with god that within
[1:09:33] 72 hours all the time and the effort
[1:09:35] that he put in you know put into putting
[1:09:37] together that sermon that within 72
[1:09:40] hours 95 of it is going to be gone from
[1:09:42] the minds of his people
[1:09:46] and so that's why over these next 40
[1:09:49] days
[1:09:50] you're going to receive
[1:09:51] for those that of you that want it
[1:09:54] this 40 days
[1:09:55] of prayer workbook
[1:09:58] and it's it's it's phenomenal
[1:10:00] okay you need to have one of these
[1:10:04] if you're going to participate in the
[1:10:06] full program because it's connected to
[1:10:09] the friday night prayer meetings there's
[1:10:11] going to be teachings on there there'll
[1:10:12] be short teachings it's it's connected
[1:10:15] to you developing some some small groups
[1:10:18] you know like through you know you can
[1:10:20] zoom you know you you just choose a few
[1:10:24] you know like maybe five or six or seven
[1:10:27] of you that you that you normally
[1:10:28] associate with that you fellowship with
[1:10:31] and and use it now to bring your group
[1:10:33] together maybe once a week
[1:10:35] you know through a zoom meeting you
[1:10:36] don't have to get together at your homes
[1:10:38] but through a zoom meeting to just come
[1:10:40] together and just read through
[1:10:43] the the that week's little teaching that
[1:10:46] that week's little program and then you
[1:10:48] can actually even watch you know uh
[1:10:50] videos you can go online because rick
[1:10:53] warren has all those those little
[1:10:56] teachings he has them with very short
[1:10:59] 28-minute videos where he just shares
[1:11:02] his thoughts and goes through that and
[1:11:05] so don't be afraid don't think oh i'm
[1:11:07] not listening to him
[1:11:10] i'll listen to my pastor i'll listen to
[1:11:12] the brothers
[1:11:13] no listen
[1:11:14] you need to listen to the word amen you
[1:11:17] need to know that god has given you the
[1:11:19] spirit of revelation
[1:11:21] to discern
[1:11:22] and take from the word everything that
[1:11:25] you have need of no matter where you
[1:11:28] receive it from
[1:11:30] it's irrelevant
[1:11:32] you can be driving down the road
[1:11:35] and the truck says
[1:11:37] one way only
[1:11:40] and god could speak to you right through
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:43] one-way trucking
[1:11:45] lord your way
[1:11:47] is the way i want to go
[1:11:49] i want your way to be my way
[1:11:51] you see what i mean god can speak in any
[1:11:54] time any season and through anybody
[1:11:57] that's the thing that a lot of people
[1:11:59] are missing out
[1:12:01] and they're missing the program of god
[1:12:03] the continuation of god in this message
[1:12:06] god is progressing in this word and
[1:12:08] there's a lot of people they're not
[1:12:10] willing they're thinking that oh they're
[1:12:12] going off here they're going off there
[1:12:15] meanwhile it's christ moving in the
[1:12:17] power of revelation leading and guiding
[1:12:20] and these people that think that we're
[1:12:22] going off are being left behind
[1:12:28] i'm not going to say who or what or
[1:12:30] that's
[1:12:31] i don't even care who how what it's not
[1:12:34] it's irrelevant i love my brothers and
[1:12:37] my sisters
[1:12:39] i will continue to love them i will
[1:12:41] jesus said love
[1:12:43] everyone everything don't get he said
[1:12:46] love your enemy so if you're going to
[1:12:48] love your enemy you might as well love
[1:12:49] anybody else or anything else
[1:12:52] don't in other words don't get caught up
[1:12:55] with these
[1:12:58] tensions
[1:13:00] and these differences
[1:13:04] get caught up with the word
[1:13:07] let the love of god so fill you and
[1:13:10] penetrate your life
[1:13:12] not to be wishy-washy when you need to
[1:13:14] correct you've got to correct
[1:13:15] when you need to be corrected you are
[1:13:17] going to be corrected and you need to
[1:13:19] know how to take correction when god
[1:13:21] gives it
[1:13:23] it's for your good
[1:13:25] especially when you can take it back and
[1:13:27] you can see it's the truth pride will
[1:13:29] get in the way
[1:13:31] pride
[1:13:32] is always there just before you're gonna
[1:13:34] fall remember that
[1:13:36] so when you get all excited you get all
[1:13:38] puffed up i gotta be careful because of
[1:13:41] the position that i hold in in my
[1:13:42] business
[1:13:44] you know sometimes you you get tired you
[1:13:46] get overwhelmed you know you're going
[1:13:48] seven days a week 14 hours a day and
[1:13:51] situations start getting on your nerves
[1:13:53] you can't help it because you're you're
[1:13:55] still human and you got to watch that
[1:13:57] spirit of pride because it'll try to
[1:13:59] raise up it'll try to make you something
[1:14:02] and then the holy spirit says i will
[1:14:04] deal with this
[1:14:07] and when you can just stop and and say
[1:14:10] thank you lord
[1:14:11] and walk away from it
[1:14:14] he's your partner
[1:14:16] you're in constant prayer with him
[1:14:19] you're constantly communicating i don't
[1:14:21] know about you
[1:14:22] every single day every day constantly
[1:14:25] i'm just lord
[1:14:26] i'm going into this meeting now
[1:14:29] this guy
[1:14:31] i had to deal with it i i was dealing on
[1:14:32] a with an on an offer this week
[1:14:35] that was i'm telling you i have never
[1:14:37] dealt
[1:14:38] in a real estate transaction like this
[1:14:40] since i started real estate
[1:14:43] and i'm talking
[1:14:45] it tested every side of me
[1:14:51] i'm not kidding you i had to walk i had
[1:14:53] to stop my thoughts stop my my mouth
[1:14:57] stop
[1:14:58] when i the minute i would wanted to that
[1:15:00] i wanted to say something because this
[1:15:02] seller i was representing the buyer and
[1:15:04] this seller
[1:15:06] oh man anointed
[1:15:09] but
[1:15:11] every time that i that something would
[1:15:12] come i'd say you know he's a good
[1:15:15] businessman
[1:15:17] and he's he's trying to negotiate the
[1:15:19] best deal
[1:15:21] that's what i say
[1:15:23] i tell my clients i said he's you know
[1:15:24] what he's a shrewd businessman
[1:15:27] and he's going to go for whatever he can
[1:15:29] get
[1:15:31] and then i'd say lord
[1:15:34] deal with them
[1:15:35] that's all i had to do we got the deal
[1:15:40] because god is real
[1:15:43] i am never ever going to doubt his
[1:15:46] end result if the deal failed it failed
[1:15:50] because i tell my clients listen
[1:15:52] that was not for you
[1:15:55] that's why you didn't get it
[1:15:57] but i can promise you the one that's
[1:15:58] coming
[1:15:59] you're gonna love
[1:16:01] it'll be the right one and i'm telling
[1:16:03] you god is my witness it's the grace of
[1:16:06] god but it happens almost every time
[1:16:10] i see the supernatural constantly
[1:16:13] because we walk with god we believe that
[1:16:16] he is in control
[1:16:17] we have a relationship we can pray every
[1:16:20] day in the right way and god honors that
[1:16:24] especially if you're doing it totally
[1:16:26] reliant upon him and lord you've given
[1:16:29] me the ability you've given me this
[1:16:31] ability you've given me this negotiating
[1:16:34] ability you've given me this discipline
[1:16:36] to be to to to hold steady to to to not
[1:16:40] lose my temper lord you've given me all
[1:16:42] these things and i'm gonna i want to
[1:16:44] please you i want to serve you in the
[1:16:46] best way that i possibly can because i
[1:16:48] know that next week we we could be gone
[1:16:53] all of us we could be gone
[1:16:55] so all we want to do is have that right
[1:16:57] relationship so that when we go we can
[1:17:00] we can just exit with no baggage
[1:17:07] you're still human though
[1:17:09] you still got to recognize you got
[1:17:11] faults
[1:17:12] you're still going to make mistakes
[1:17:15] you're still gonna be disappointed
[1:17:17] you're still gonna
[1:17:19] you're still gonna get mad you're still
[1:17:21] gonna all these things but but in the
[1:17:23] back
[1:17:25] you either believe god or you don't
[1:17:28] and when you believe god through it all
[1:17:30] you're going to stand right back up and
[1:17:32] you're going to say god's will be done
[1:17:35] hallelujah
[1:17:37] glory to god amen next slide
[1:17:41] so
[1:17:43] a daily time with god is going to be
[1:17:46] one of the action steps that you're
[1:17:48] going to have to take for these next 40
[1:17:49] days now i know you all pray
[1:17:52] i know you do you might say oh brother
[1:17:54] day i pray every day
[1:17:57] you're going to pray different by the
[1:17:58] time
[1:17:59] we move through this series
[1:18:01] you're going to have a different
[1:18:02] approach
[1:18:04] you're going to be a little bit more
[1:18:05] mature in the way that you pray
[1:18:07] you're going to realize that there was a
[1:18:09] lot of immaturity in the way that you
[1:18:11] prayed because we're creatures of habit
[1:18:14] amen we are we are designed in a certain
[1:18:16] way that you know that
[1:18:18] we we just we just habitually do things
[1:18:21] go to the next slide
[1:18:23] but you know
[1:18:25] there's there's something about how we
[1:18:27] grow and how we learn and we learn in
[1:18:30] different ways
[1:18:33] and so if you go to the next slide
[1:18:36] you know god made us all unique god made
[1:18:39] us all different god made us in a
[1:18:41] certain way that you know that we need
[1:18:43] to understand you know our human
[1:18:46] limitations and strengths
[1:18:48] and that's what this is all designed to
[1:18:50] do
[1:18:51] is to just bring priorities in place so
[1:18:54] that you'll know how to properly grow in
[1:18:57] christ and so the first way that people
[1:19:00] learn is by listening
[1:19:02] and those are the kind of people that
[1:19:03] love church
[1:19:05] they come into church and they listen
[1:19:08] and they hear and they say amen i got it
[1:19:12] hallelujah and then there's those
[1:19:15] that
[1:19:17] learn by watching they need to watch
[1:19:20] they need that's why we put these up
[1:19:21] there you know and you're gonna receive
[1:19:23] certain
[1:19:24] um you know uh pamphlets when you leave
[1:19:27] uh and and and you're gonna be able to
[1:19:29] read them and so you will absorb because
[1:19:31] you watch you might watch the video i'm
[1:19:33] big on that
[1:19:35] i'm big on watching and learning
[1:19:37] okay
[1:19:38] there's a few ways that i noticed it
[1:19:40] because this got me to you know kind of
[1:19:42] focus in how it is that i grow
[1:19:44] and then there's some that learn by
[1:19:46] talking
[1:19:48] you'll notice that those are you know
[1:19:50] like if you get into a small group
[1:19:51] discussion the one that talks a lot
[1:19:54] he's learning from his talking
[1:19:57] he's hearing he's hearing certain things
[1:20:00] and until he speaks it
[1:20:02] he doesn't really get it
[1:20:05] it's just the way people are certain
[1:20:06] people are built they might see it they
[1:20:08] might hear it they might watch it but
[1:20:10] until they actually speak it it doesn't
[1:20:13] register in their minds
[1:20:15] so you need to so that's why it's
[1:20:17] important for you to fellowship
[1:20:19] fellowship with one another because as
[1:20:22] you fellowship with one another and you
[1:20:24] talk to one another it releases the the
[1:20:27] the way that god has designed you to
[1:20:29] receive his word
[1:20:33] and then there's those that learn by
[1:20:35] doing it
[1:20:36] you know there's some people they don't
[1:20:38] like to listen they don't like to watch
[1:20:41] and they don't like to talk
[1:20:43] that's men in general
[1:20:47] not all of them
[1:20:49] but they're doers
[1:20:52] they get in get underneath that hood
[1:20:55] lift that engine up
[1:20:56] that carburetor is not sounding right
[1:20:59] before you know it's 20 pieces on the
[1:21:00] floor
[1:21:02] and it's all back together again and
[1:21:04] she's running just right
[1:21:06] because they're doers they got to get
[1:21:08] into action
[1:21:09] but this next 40 days is going to get
[1:21:12] you to activate all those areas so that
[1:21:15] you will benefit in the way that god has
[1:21:18] designed you
[1:21:19] to grow and to pray and to have that
[1:21:22] relationship with christ and one another
[1:21:25] it's going to get you to see one another
[1:21:27] differently to look at one understand
[1:21:30] one another you know on how each of us
[1:21:33] live and learn and grow together amen
[1:21:37] different styles of learning you know
[1:21:40] some of you are auditory some of you
[1:21:42] learn by listening some of you learn by
[1:21:45] watching some of you learn by doing and
[1:21:47] some of you learn by seeing
[1:21:54] now let's go to the next slide
[1:22:00] we grow
[1:22:02] when we develop spiritual habits
[1:22:07] let's face it
[1:22:09] you can just kind of look at yourself
[1:22:13] and
[1:22:15] look at your habits
[1:22:17] and look at the results
[1:22:20] there's a saying that say you know it
[1:22:21] says
[1:22:22] you continue doing what you're doing you
[1:22:25] will continue to get what you got
[1:22:28] it's as simple as that
[1:22:31] and so in order for you to change
[1:22:33] certain things in your walk with god in
[1:22:36] your spiritual relationship with god and
[1:22:40] one another
[1:22:41] you will need to change
[1:22:43] your habits you will need to develop
[1:22:46] new spiritual habits
[1:22:48] some people they just
[1:22:51] are hard-headed
[1:22:53] and they don't want to change
[1:22:59] you need a body change
[1:23:02] so you better start saying amen to
[1:23:04] change
[1:23:07] you know like some people like they just
[1:23:10] don't like change period you know you
[1:23:11] get an argument every time you want to
[1:23:13] just you know
[1:23:15] you want to can we make this yellow
[1:23:18] i don't like yellow
[1:23:21] right away the thing comes up you know
[1:23:23] and anger and this and that meanwhile
[1:23:25] you're just suggesting something
[1:23:27] can we talk about this can we
[1:23:29] communicate
[1:23:30] you know but you got to watch that if
[1:23:33] you if you're in this habit that you
[1:23:34] don't like change
[1:23:36] you're you're going to be hard
[1:23:39] people stay people stay in churches for
[1:23:42] 20 years and they never change
[1:23:45] they have this stubborn
[1:23:46] attitude regardless whatever the
[1:23:49] situation whatever the first the first
[1:23:51] thing is you will you will sense it you
[1:23:53] will feel it there's there's resistance
[1:23:57] how can you resist change when god is
[1:23:59] trying to change you
[1:24:00] daily
[1:24:02] that's the whole process he's trying to
[1:24:04] develop the right habits in you so that
[1:24:06] you can become what he wants you to be
[1:24:09] amen
[1:24:10] you know uh
[1:24:11] we cannot overestimate estimate with you
[1:24:14] the importance of you building good
[1:24:16] habits in your life
[1:24:18] if you build good habits in your life
[1:24:20] you're going to you're going to have
[1:24:21] good character if you have good
[1:24:23] character you're going to have a great
[1:24:25] destiny your habits determine what you
[1:24:28] are and what you are determines where
[1:24:31] you go in life
[1:24:34] your character is the sum total of your
[1:24:36] habits
[1:24:37] amen you can't stay for instance i'm a
[1:24:40] kind person
[1:24:41] you know i i i have the character
[1:24:43] quality of kindness unless you're always
[1:24:46] kind unless it's habitual to you it's
[1:24:49] your habit to be kind if you're only
[1:24:51] kind 25 of the time you're not kind
[1:24:55] period
[1:24:56] if you're only kind when you want
[1:24:58] something
[1:25:01] you're not kind
[1:25:02] o honey i'll be faithful for you
[1:25:04] to you for 29 days a month
[1:25:07] you're not faithful
[1:25:11] it's that simple
[1:25:13] so it's not it's it's a matter of
[1:25:16] understanding that it's not 25 of the
[1:25:19] time
[1:25:20] it's developing a habit that is 100
[1:25:24] consistent
[1:25:27] and disciplined
[1:25:28] no matter what if it's only two or three
[1:25:30] things that you can develop over these
[1:25:32] next 40 days
[1:25:34] then let that be those fear those few
[1:25:36] things because i'll tell you something
[1:25:38] it takes at least six weeks
[1:25:41] to develop a new habit
[1:25:43] that's why this is 40 days 6 times 7 42
[1:25:47] days
[1:25:48] it takes you three weeks just to get a
[1:25:50] little bit comfortable with it
[1:25:53] and then another three weeks to actually
[1:25:55] make it a habit
[1:25:57] desmond has a habit
[1:25:59] of being
[1:26:00] joyful
[1:26:05] everybody knows that
[1:26:08] don't try to change that
[1:26:11] the joy of the lord is your strength
[1:26:14] there's a scripture in the word
[1:26:16] he's made it a habit to be joyful no
[1:26:18] matter what
[1:26:21] and there's strength that comes from
[1:26:23] that and if i know that in the word of
[1:26:25] god i'm gonna take that i'm gonna look
[1:26:27] at it i'm gonna say praise god i i want
[1:26:30] some of that
[1:26:32] i want the joy of the lord i want his
[1:26:34] strength in my life
[1:26:37] if it means developing a certain habit
[1:26:39] then i want to develop that habit
[1:26:43] i want to be somebody that's always
[1:26:45] approachable
[1:26:48] that's a habit
[1:26:50] you don't want to be the kind of person
[1:26:52] that you can approach them on sunday but
[1:26:54] you can't approach them on monday
[1:26:59] or friday you ever notice friday it was
[1:27:02] easy to talk to the boss
[1:27:06] because you knew you didn't have to see
[1:27:07] him for the next three days
[1:27:12] you see it's it's it's like you got to
[1:27:14] get it right
[1:27:16] you are or you're not you either believe
[1:27:19] the word or you don't
[1:27:21] it's just as simple as that
[1:27:24] uh we better move along here
[1:27:27] uh slide number 10
[1:27:28] the scripture says here in john chapter
[1:27:32] 13
[1:27:33] verse 17
[1:27:35] jesus says now that you know these
[1:27:37] things you will be blessed if you i want
[1:27:41] you to
[1:27:42] circle the next two words practice them
[1:27:46] there it is in the word of god you've
[1:27:47] got to practice certain things in order
[1:27:50] to develop the habit to do those things
[1:27:53] amen praise god
[1:27:55] and so you don't get god's blessings
[1:27:57] from knowing the right thing to do you
[1:28:00] get god's blessings for doing the right
[1:28:02] thing
[1:28:04] it's one thing to know oh i know this i
[1:28:06] know that but you don't do it it's no
[1:28:09] good to you
[1:28:10] unless you hear recognize and act
[1:28:15] there's no power in it there's no
[1:28:17] benefit from it
[1:28:18] amen praise god
[1:28:20] and so the way you build any habit in
[1:28:22] your life is in two ways through
[1:28:25] repetition and through practice
[1:28:27] repetition and practice you ever see an
[1:28:30] athlete they become athletes because
[1:28:32] they are disciplined to habitually do
[1:28:35] certain things regardless every single
[1:28:38] day they'll do it over and over and over
[1:28:41] again and they become olympic athletes
[1:28:44] you ever watch successful people they
[1:28:47] have certain habits they have habits on
[1:28:50] the way that they act the way that they
[1:28:52] communicate the way that they handle
[1:28:54] themselves the way that they show
[1:28:57] confidence and respect and all of those
[1:29:00] things there's a way to be successful in
[1:29:03] this world you you will not always deal
[1:29:06] with the with with with the most honest
[1:29:08] people and you will not always be under
[1:29:11] the greatest of circumstances but you
[1:29:13] don't have to change you can still be
[1:29:16] that same person you can still be
[1:29:19] truthful you can still tell the truth
[1:29:22] you can still be a person of integrity
[1:29:25] so that they will get to know this
[1:29:28] person is consistently somebody that we
[1:29:31] can trust because he's got the habit of
[1:29:34] saying the truth
[1:29:38] you see these are all examples
[1:29:42] it needs to become ingrained
[1:29:45] in your life over these next 40 days
[1:29:47] whatever it is
[1:29:49] you're gonna know you're gonna you're
[1:29:51] gonna take your own inventory you're
[1:29:52] gonna see where it is that you need new
[1:29:56] habits
[1:29:58] old habits kicked out
[1:30:00] new habits developed
[1:30:02] amen next slide
[1:30:06] some of you had habits in the past you
[1:30:08] dropped them off this is a time to go
[1:30:10] back to what god wants
[1:30:13] to do
[1:30:14] in you
[1:30:15] he says now that you know these things
[1:30:18] you'll be blessed if you practice them
[1:30:22] what happens when you practice good
[1:30:23] habits spiritual habits you grow
[1:30:28] it's that simple
[1:30:30] you grow
[1:30:38] but you see
[1:30:39] solid food is for mature people
[1:30:43] whose minds notice
[1:30:45] have been trained to practice that's
[1:30:48] called habit whose minds have been
[1:30:50] trained by practice to know the
[1:30:52] difference between good and evil
[1:30:56] see these are all scriptures right out
[1:30:58] of the word of god we read them all the
[1:30:59] time god is interested in your habits
[1:31:03] god wants you to develop some new habits
[1:31:06] amen
[1:31:09] you have to set up habits and be
[1:31:11] disciplined and do it so you need to
[1:31:14] literally you know that's what this this
[1:31:16] workbook is going to be good for you're
[1:31:18] going to be able to evaluate yourself
[1:31:19] look at certain things make some notes
[1:31:22] and study and and and work on those
[1:31:24] things 5 10 15 minutes a day that's all
[1:31:28] it's going to take but it will
[1:31:29] powerfully change your life amen
[1:31:33] hallelujah next slide
[1:31:35] the bible says in first corinthians all
[1:31:37] good athletes train hard and practice to
[1:31:40] get better
[1:31:42] they do it to win a prize that won't
[1:31:44] last
[1:31:45] but you
[1:31:47] you practice to win a prize that will
[1:31:49] last into eternity
[1:31:52] hallelujah first corinthians 9 25
[1:31:56] you know they worked so hard to win that
[1:31:58] prize so that they can pin it right here
[1:32:01] what good is that going to do when they
[1:32:03] cross over to meet the lord
[1:32:05] unless they've got the character
[1:32:07] unless they've got that relationship
[1:32:10] with the lord unless they have something
[1:32:13] real you've got something eternal that
[1:32:15] you will benefit from these next 40 days
[1:32:18] it will enhance your walk with god it
[1:32:21] will enhance your relationship with one
[1:32:23] another
[1:32:27] so we're gonna have you know uh these
[1:32:29] friday night prayer meetings
[1:32:33] i don't know is everybody getting the
[1:32:34] emails
[1:32:37] okay because like i sent i i think
[1:32:40] there's a lot of people not getting them
[1:32:41] i sent out an email about a week and a
[1:32:43] half ago
[1:32:44] to people and i said if you're
[1:32:47] if you want to continue to get these
[1:32:49] emails
[1:32:50] please respond back i think i got 15.
[1:32:54] so either you guys are all backslidden
[1:33:01] i don't know
[1:33:04] or
[1:33:06] you're not getting the emails
[1:33:09] so i'm just saying these are things
[1:33:13] you got certain habits
[1:33:16] you don't like to respond you don't like
[1:33:17] to whatever
[1:33:19] you need to change some habits because
[1:33:21] part of
[1:33:22] responding
[1:33:24] is communication
[1:33:26] and when you don't communicate with your
[1:33:30] heavenly father
[1:33:32] or your brothers and sisters
[1:33:36] with
[1:33:37] respectful courtesy
[1:33:40] it shows
[1:33:41] you need
[1:33:43] a habit change
[1:33:45] i don't care what you think
[1:33:47] okay i don't know i don't like
[1:33:49] technology this and i don't care if you
[1:33:51] don't like technology
[1:33:53] you can phone
[1:33:56] you still use a phone right
[1:33:58] you can call you can reach you can
[1:34:01] this next 40 days
[1:34:03] is going to require
[1:34:04] communication you're going to see it
[1:34:06] you're going to you're going to see how
[1:34:07] much we actually get into that
[1:34:09] how important it is how how much
[1:34:12] of an importance it is for us to respond
[1:34:15] and to communicate and to know that it's
[1:34:18] very important amen the next slide says
[1:34:21] if there was any verse in the bible okay
[1:34:25] that that that we would want
[1:34:28] is this every day the believers had the
[1:34:30] habit of meeting together
[1:34:32] in the temple courts to worship together
[1:34:35] and also in their homes for fellowship
[1:34:37] they ate together and celebrated with
[1:34:40] happy and thankful hearts that was
[1:34:43] something that the disciples in the
[1:34:45] books in the book of acts they didn't do
[1:34:47] it on sundays only
[1:34:49] they did it every single day they had
[1:34:52] communication they reached out to one
[1:34:55] another i i gotta say you know there's a
[1:34:57] lot of brothers and sisters they reach
[1:34:59] out they communicate with me and and i
[1:35:01] love it i love it you know they'll send
[1:35:03] me a text say brother you know pray for
[1:35:05] me on this situation brother this thing
[1:35:07] happened they say i'm so blessed i said
[1:35:09] praise god i'll respond back and say god
[1:35:11] is good you know there's because because
[1:35:14] we are encouraging one another sometimes
[1:35:17] they're down and they need to be
[1:35:18] encouraged back up again we are there
[1:35:21] for one another unless we understand how
[1:35:24] important that is it's the body of
[1:35:26] christ it's how the body is operating if
[1:35:29] listen these these last two years have
[1:35:31] done one thing the best separate
[1:35:36] getting people to totally separate from
[1:35:38] each other discommunicate no contact
[1:35:40] whatsoever to the point where when you
[1:35:43] even see them it's like hey
[1:35:46] like it's it's just gotten to a place
[1:35:48] where where it like like you're losing
[1:35:51] your first love
[1:35:54] you want that first love back again you
[1:35:56] want to get it back into your life into
[1:35:59] your relationships into everything that
[1:36:02] you do you want to project the love of
[1:36:04] god into that situation so that god can
[1:36:07] take a hold of it and do miracles he
[1:36:10] does miracles i don't care if it's
[1:36:12] something at work brother gabriel that
[1:36:14] next door neighbor you love him till
[1:36:16] till he's got to give whatever it is
[1:36:18] that god got released from him
[1:36:22] it's that simple
[1:36:25] because we serve a supernatural god
[1:36:28] we heard the testimony brother desmond
[1:36:30] there in africa the woman couldn't have
[1:36:32] a child
[1:36:34] it's not because brother desmond
[1:36:36] is because he's got faith in god
[1:36:40] and he knows that god can do it
[1:36:42] and so the first thing he says well come
[1:36:44] here let's pray
[1:36:46] let me lay hands on you i believe god's
[1:36:48] word
[1:36:49] that if you have faith in your heart
[1:36:51] that god can give you a child he's going
[1:36:53] to give it to you
[1:36:57] that's faith
[1:36:58] and that's something that's available to
[1:37:00] every son and every daughter of god
[1:37:02] because you believe
[1:37:04] god hallelujah
[1:37:09] daily time alone with god it's so
[1:37:11] important
[1:37:12] you know daily time alone and fellowship
[1:37:16] very important all those aspects go to
[1:37:19] the next slide
[1:37:20] in the bible it says in the book of
[1:37:22] joshua chapter 1
[1:37:24] verse 8 next slide please always
[1:37:26] remember what is written in this book
[1:37:29] read it and think about it every day and
[1:37:32] be sure to obey everything written in it
[1:37:35] if you do this you will be prosperous
[1:37:38] and successful in your life
[1:37:41] so why wouldn't we want to do these
[1:37:43] things
[1:37:44] why wouldn't we want to take time every
[1:37:46] single day to just believe god's word
[1:37:49] and not believe the circumstances in our
[1:37:52] lives
[1:37:52] they are there the bills do come in
[1:37:55] every month the children do act up
[1:37:57] there's health issues there's you know
[1:38:00] relationship those are all real things
[1:38:03] but there's nothing too hard for god if
[1:38:06] you are willing
[1:38:08] over the next 40 days
[1:38:10] to commit to god
[1:38:12] your time your few minutes every day
[1:38:15] your time to read your time to come into
[1:38:18] the services your time to attend the
[1:38:20] prayer meetings your time to have a
[1:38:22] little small group fellowship with one
[1:38:25] another to develop your relationships to
[1:38:27] develop and pray for one another to help
[1:38:30] one another to lift one up that's weak
[1:38:33] and to and
[1:38:34] to receive from him that's strong
[1:38:38] if you're willing to do that you will
[1:38:39] benefit you will be successful if you
[1:38:42] apply all of these things
[1:38:45] okay amen
[1:38:46] so you think god's lying god think god's
[1:38:49] just teasing you you think god's just
[1:38:51] making this up no god says you want to
[1:38:54] be prosperous you want to be successful
[1:38:57] well you're not
[1:38:58] doing what
[1:39:00] will be the key to it

[1:39:06] if you do this you'll make a whole lot
[1:39:09] fewer mistakes
[1:39:12] if you read it you study it you memorize
[1:39:15] it and you get it

[1:39:20] i promise you you will succeed in your
[1:39:22] life you want to succeed in your
[1:39:24] business you need to read it

[1:42:28] that hand gonna do
[1:42:29] it's gonna wither

[1:42:48] sisters that are like-minded that
[1:42:50] believe the word of god you need to
[1:42:52] strengthen one another encourage one
[1:42:54] another you need to have fellowship with
[1:42:57] one another
[1:42:58] you want to be alone out there you want
[1:43:00] to be a lone ranger oh well i believe
[1:43:02] this so i'm going to stay out here good
[1:43:04] for you good luck
[1:43:06] let me know when you need a drink of
[1:43:07] water there's still a drink right here
[1:43:10] right here
[1:43:13] hallelujah
[1:43:15] we need
[1:43:16] one another amen
[1:43:19] and we should
[1:43:20] love
[1:43:22] and i'm talking really
[1:43:25] love one another
[1:43:28] that's powerful saints
[1:43:30] it changes everything
[1:43:32] start to project love to that individual
[1:43:35] that you feel a little tension from just
[1:43:38] project hit just project love to that
[1:43:40] thing and you will see that the enemy
[1:43:42] that is between you and that person or
[1:43:45] you and that situation
[1:43:47] starts to dissolve and the power of god
[1:43:50] comes in
[1:43:51] and then god's grace takes over
[1:43:54] things start to change things just they
[1:43:57] cannot remain the same hallelujah and if
[1:44:00] that person cannot take it and that
[1:44:03] person cannot submit then don't worry
[1:44:05] god will probably
[1:44:07] take them out
[1:44:09] it's just the way the body works you
[1:44:11] know when when things get in there like
[1:44:13] antibodies
[1:44:14] you know if there's certain things that
[1:44:16] are getting into your body that that
[1:44:18] that you you know you just go and eat
[1:44:20] something that's not right it's not too
[1:44:22] long you're visiting the men's room or
[1:44:24] the ladies room
[1:44:25] right
[1:44:26] because your body knows how to kick it
[1:44:28] out
[1:44:29] well god knows
[1:44:31] every single one as they mature now
[1:44:34] because this is a this is a maturity
[1:44:36] time
[1:44:37] we're at the end of the end
[1:44:39] don't be surprised when you see certain
[1:44:41] things happen certain com certain goal
[1:44:44] don't be surprised by that
[1:44:45] every one everything must find its
[1:44:48] rightful position in the body or outside
[1:44:51] the body
[1:44:52] because remember the body the rapture
[1:44:55] it's only the body of christ that goes
[1:44:56] in the rapture
[1:44:58] okay so anything that's not supposed to
[1:45:01] be there will not be there
[1:45:04] god has a way of doing things you don't
[1:45:06] have to be fearful you don't have to
[1:45:08] worry
[1:45:09] but you still need to love them you
[1:45:11] still need to project the love of god
[1:45:14] you still need once in a while to say
[1:45:15] hey god bless you trust in all is well
[1:45:18] you still need to be there for them if
[1:45:20] they reach out
[1:45:22] we still need to pray for one another we
[1:45:24] still need to listen this is not like
[1:45:26] you know god isn't putting boundaries on
[1:45:29] his love he's not putting boundaries on
[1:45:32] the way that he wants to build this body
[1:45:34] because he's doing it
[1:45:36] and if you trust him then he'll do it
[1:45:39] and he'll do it
[1:45:40] perfectly
[1:45:43] hallelujah
[1:45:45] glory to god i'm going to just move
[1:45:46] ahead here my priorities
[1:45:48] not your priorities
[1:45:50] it's all about me
[1:45:52] we need each other it's not your
[1:45:54] priorities my priorities about us
[1:45:57] it's about the body it's about edifying
[1:45:59] nourishing strengthening building up the
[1:46:02] body of jesus christ next slide says in
[1:46:05] hebrews 10
[1:46:07] 24 he says let us be concerned for one
[1:46:09] another to help one another to show love
[1:46:13] and to do good let us not give up the
[1:46:16] habit of meeting together as some are
[1:46:18] doing
[1:46:19] instead let us encourage one another
[1:46:23] all the more
[1:46:27] let's not give up the habit of meeting
[1:46:29] together
[1:46:31] as summer doing let's let's let's get
[1:46:33] back into the habit of fellowshipping
[1:46:36] of of of you know calling one another
[1:46:40] you know you sisters you need to reach
[1:46:43] out to the other sisters on a regular
[1:46:45] basis
[1:46:47] you need to create the habit of doing
[1:46:49] that it it's
[1:46:51] every time my wife tells me about a
[1:46:53] fellowship that she had with sister june
[1:46:56] or sister elaine or sister so-and-so
[1:46:59] sister deborah sister you know a man she
[1:47:02] gets into you know little fellowship
[1:47:03] says she's always strengthened from
[1:47:05] those fellowships
[1:47:07] she's different
[1:47:09] we need to get into the habit of
[1:47:11] reaching out to one another just to say
[1:47:14] hey how's it going god bless you you
[1:47:16] know how's your week going not to gossip
[1:47:20] be careful of that
[1:47:24] oh did you hear this that's the only
[1:47:25] reason they're calling
[1:47:27] oh larry she's calling i know why she's
[1:47:29] calling i know why he's calling
[1:47:32] right as soon as something raises up
[1:47:34] right away
[1:47:35] no this you you if you're in the habit
[1:47:37] of of reaching out to one another
[1:47:40] sending out a little amen god bless you
[1:47:42] you know amanda there she sends out god
[1:47:44] bless your thursday god bless your
[1:47:46] sunday once in a while i don't see them
[1:47:48] all the time but whenever i do i thank
[1:47:51] god for them because i said praise god
[1:47:53] there's a blessing for me today
[1:47:55] and right away god bless you and your
[1:47:57] sist you and your family sister and
[1:47:59] brothers reach out in this one sense and
[1:48:01] that one sense they have the spirit of
[1:48:04] fellowship on them they understand that
[1:48:07] they need each other that we need one
[1:48:10] another that with community we can grow
[1:48:13] together
[1:48:16] next you know we need to get desperate
[1:48:19] sometimes in our situations
[1:48:23] you know
[1:48:26] notice what the bible says here also in
[1:48:28] james 16 5 16 said if you're confessing
[1:48:33] our faults getting right making ready
[1:48:35] for it confess our faults one to another
[1:48:38] having no no faults ask people to pray
[1:48:41] for you
[1:48:42] confessing our faults one to another
[1:48:44] this brother brown saying praying one
[1:48:46] for the other there you are with love
[1:48:49] love that i got confidence i can confess
[1:48:52] to you my wrong and you can confess to
[1:48:55] me you're wrong and i love you well
[1:48:58] enough that i'll pray for you and you'll
[1:49:00] pray for me and will stay with it with
[1:49:04] effectual fervent prayer until it's
[1:49:07] answered that's that's desperation
[1:49:10] that's what we should have all the time
[1:49:15] if there's a brother or sister or a
[1:49:16] situation
[1:49:18] we should immediately listen those
[1:49:20] prayer requests when they come out with
[1:49:22] brother bill he sends them out i know a
[1:49:24] lot of you you just look at it and you
[1:49:26] just go on with your day i know it
[1:49:29] it doesn't take long for you to read
[1:49:32] that and say lord just remember her
[1:49:34] right now remember him right now
[1:49:37] and move on
[1:49:39] that's all
[1:49:40] do you think that it
[1:49:42] oh
[1:49:43] lord jesus
[1:49:45] this brother lord
[1:49:47] i know what he's been doing and i know
[1:49:49] he deserves this
[1:49:51] but lord jesus
[1:49:58] oh god
[1:50:00] you know
[1:50:01] this has happened in this you hear that
[1:50:03] you look at the prayer requests and you
[1:50:06] you got the wrong habit up here
[1:50:08] oh you know what
[1:50:09] serves them right
[1:50:12] what kind of a demon is on you
[1:50:15] what kind of a spirit would think in
[1:50:17] that way
[1:50:21] in the body of christ
[1:50:24] you've got to get on your knees and
[1:50:27] you've got to get right you've got to
[1:50:28] get something out of you
[1:50:30] you need to change your habits
[1:50:33] you need to change your stinking
[1:50:34] thinking
[1:50:35] you need to you know do things and and
[1:50:38] and and
[1:50:39] and love one another in it you know
[1:50:42] change how you're seeing one another i
[1:50:45] hope after today you will look at one
[1:50:47] another different
[1:50:48] you will feel
[1:50:50] different you will know that you are a
[1:50:52] son of god that that is a son or a
[1:50:54] daughter of god that you are working
[1:50:57] together to get this work done for his
[1:51:00] glory
[1:51:01] that we are not here to separate we are
[1:51:04] here to
[1:51:05] come together in the unity of the faith
[1:51:07] so that we can do what needs to be done
[1:51:10] for the glory of god
[1:51:13] it's all about your attitude let's move
[1:51:15] on
[1:51:17] action step is to join a small group and
[1:51:20] to attend the friday night prayer
[1:51:21] meetings and start a small group and by
[1:51:24] saying that like i said like don't make
[1:51:26] it anything super you know difficult and
[1:51:28] everything else just reach out to a
[1:51:30] couple of people you know a couple of
[1:51:31] sisters and say hey let's let's just get
[1:51:33] together let's talk let's you know let's
[1:51:35] do a zoom meeting there's a few that can
[1:51:37] do zoom meetings and just you know read
[1:51:39] that thing for 15 20 minutes share each
[1:51:42] other talk between one another share
[1:51:45] some testimonies and and allow the holy
[1:51:47] spirit to bless
[1:51:49] under this umbrella of the 40 days of
[1:51:51] prayer here i'm talking about
[1:51:53] this is going to change your habits this
[1:51:55] is what's going to cause you to make
[1:51:57] those those changes amen praise god
[1:52:00] move on to the next slide we grow when
[1:52:03] we expect to grow
[1:52:06] you've got to be under expectation that
[1:52:08] god is going to do
[1:52:10] what you are asking him to do
[1:52:14] come on saints next slide you know
[1:52:18] uh
[1:52:19] for instance many times there are people
[1:52:21] come in the prayer line
[1:52:23] and i pray for them
[1:52:25] i never know what's going to happen i
[1:52:26] just pray for them and there is a power
[1:52:29] in prayer
[1:52:31] prayer will even change the word of god
[1:52:34] that was a striker wasn't it but it's
[1:52:36] the truth the word of the lord would you
[1:52:39] not believe the prophets the word of the
[1:52:42] lord came to isaiah and he went and told
[1:52:44] hezekiah that he wasn't coming off his
[1:52:47] bed he was going to die and hezekiah
[1:52:50] turned his face to the wall and wept
[1:52:53] bitterly and said lord i beseech thee
[1:52:56] i've walked before thee with a perfect
[1:52:58] heart and desire 15 more years of life
[1:53:02] and the prophet wasn't gone till the
[1:53:04] word of the lord came again to the
[1:53:06] prophet said go tell him i heard his
[1:53:09] prayer and he's coming off the bed in
[1:53:11] the next three days prayer changes
[1:53:15] things
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:18] because we expect we get into
[1:53:20] desperation
[1:53:22] we know that god can do it and so you've
[1:53:25] got to put yourself under the
[1:53:27] expectation that he's going to do it
[1:53:29] you've got to get desperate you've got
[1:53:31] to go to god and say lord jesus quote
[1:53:34] his word remind him of certain promises
[1:53:38] in his word and if you've kept your
[1:53:40] promises if you're doing what you know
[1:53:42] you can do all that you do then stand
[1:53:46] god will do the rest
[1:53:51] every time god moves
[1:53:54] out of heaven
[1:53:56] and moves on earth he does a miracle
[1:53:59] in somebody's life is because somebody
[1:54:02] believed
[1:54:04] somebody believed
[1:54:06] oh glory to god and the question i ask
[1:54:09] you
[1:54:10] if you haven't even thought about it
[1:54:13] until now
[1:54:15] is what are you going to expect
[1:54:19] to happen
[1:54:20] in your life
[1:54:22] in the next 40 days
[1:54:25] we're winding it down
[1:54:27] let the musicians come
[1:54:30] what are you expecting
[1:54:33] because if you haven't thought about it
[1:54:35] that's why
[1:54:36] this workbook is going to give you an
[1:54:38] opportunity to write these things down
[1:54:42] and then you'll be able to go back
[1:54:44] and you'll be able to see the things
[1:54:46] that have changed in your life
[1:54:48] you'll be able to go back
[1:54:50] and review those things and see how god
[1:54:53] has literally changed those things and
[1:54:56] it's all because you expected it
[1:55:02] next slide
[1:55:05] we grow
[1:55:07] when we commit
[1:55:09] to grow remember this is going to take a
[1:55:11] commitment this week
[1:55:13] it's going to start today you're going
[1:55:14] to make that commitment today
[1:55:18] to god and to one another
[1:55:21] that you will

[1:55:37] you must choose
[1:55:40] to grow
[1:55:41] you must choose
[1:55:43] to allow habits to change in your life
[1:55:46] you must choose
[1:55:48] to step out and do things that you
[1:55:50] normally
[1:55:51] haven't been doing
[1:55:54] so that change can take place
[1:56:00] it's going to take discipline

[1:59:09] and work on this
[1:59:11] and that
[1:59:12] and change this habit
[1:59:14] and that habit because i really want to
[1:59:17] change if you believe that with
[1:59:19] everything that's in you what i just
[1:59:21] said
[1:59:22] you watch the supernatural start from
[1:59:24] the moment you drop that pen
[1:59:26] you will see god in
[1:59:29] every
[1:59:30] thing you'll just start to recognize wow
[1:59:33] this is real
[1:59:35] why not because i said so
[1:59:38] but because you believe so
[1:59:40] you know you you know he's god you know

[1:59:48] next slide
[1:59:50] our greatest wish and power is that you

[1:59:59] god wants you to grow
[2:00:01] god wants you to mature
[2:00:03] god wants to use you
[2:00:06] in order to bring the rapture into its
[2:00:08] final stage
[2:00:10] that's what this is all about
[2:00:12] you're gonna you're you're gonna see the
[2:00:14] greater picture here this is not just
[2:00:15] about building a prayer relationship
[2:00:18] with god and your s and your brothers
[2:00:20] and sisters this is about the power of
[2:00:22] god
[2:00:23] coming into the body
[2:00:24] with that capstone of love and bringing
[2:00:27] such an anointing and such a
[2:00:29] brother brahm said that one morning he
[2:00:32] says you're gonna feel the love of god
[2:00:34] sweep over you like you've never felt
[2:00:37] before and something and you're going to
[2:00:39] get so caught away in the moment in the
[2:00:40] twinkling of an eye it'll be over
[2:00:43] but that is something
[2:00:45] that you're going to be conscious of
[2:00:49] you need to become part of that program
[2:00:51] you need to you need to get into that
[2:00:54] revelation the
[2:00:55] the rapture is a revelation remember
[2:00:57] that
[2:00:59] and so you're gonna need to feed on the
[2:01:00] word feed on the on the prophet listen
[2:01:02] to the messages everything that you now
[2:01:05] listen to and read you watch it'll bring
[2:01:07] you back to this
[2:01:09] it'll bring you back to it'll it'll
[2:01:11] remind you of certain habits it'll
[2:01:12] remind you of certain things that you're
[2:01:14] doing that you are doing because you
[2:01:16] know
[2:01:17] over these last few days i i looked at
[2:01:20] certain habits that i had and i and i
[2:01:22] realized you know
[2:01:24] their habits that do produce good
[2:01:26] results i look at the habits of my
[2:01:28] partner frank
[2:01:30] you know i was watching he's got certain
[2:01:32] habits that man he does not compromise
[2:01:35] for a second on it
[2:01:37] and because of that and sometimes i you
[2:01:39] know i like
[2:01:40] you know i get a little bit okay all
[2:01:42] right do it you know it's got you know
[2:01:44] but at the end it worked
[2:01:48] it it's because he knows
[2:01:51] that if he does this over and over and
[2:01:53] over again it'll produce the right
[2:01:55] result
[2:01:56] and it's positive
[2:01:58] and so by doing that becoming conscious
[2:02:01] of that we can do the same thing now in
[2:02:03] whatever it is that we want to change
[2:02:06] just make it a habit decide that no
[2:02:08] matter what
[2:02:11] know that god wants you
[2:02:14] to grow
[2:02:18] so are you expecting the rapture saints
[2:02:22] are you really expecting a body change
[2:02:25] the lord wants you to grow up
[2:02:28] the question is
[2:02:29] do you want to grow
[2:02:30] up because if you grow up
[2:02:34] you go up
[2:02:36] god bless you saints
