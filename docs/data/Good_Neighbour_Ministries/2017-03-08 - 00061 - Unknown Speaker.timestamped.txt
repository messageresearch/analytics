[0:00] Hallelujah. Then then he says that's for
[0:03] members of the church. But then if they
[0:06] are not members of the church,
[0:10] not members of the congregation,
[0:13] they should be made to be in a position
[0:16] to be ruled or governed. They've got to
[0:20] listen to our orders in here because
[0:24] this is the orders of the local church.
[0:28] This is things we don't want to do,
[0:30] things we don't like to do, but it's
[0:33] things that must be done. Amen.
[0:37] And I'm exposing myself
[0:40] here by telling all this on the deck.
[0:45] It's me. They can hear me talking and
[0:48] know that it's coming from me, not just
[0:51] from you men. Talking about the deacons
[0:54] and the trustees. You've asked me these
[0:57] questions. I'm giving it to you the best
[1:00] I know how from the word of God. And if
[1:03] these people get angry and go out from
[1:06] you, what does the scripture say about
[1:08] it? They went out from us because they
[1:10] wasn't of us and that settled them.
[1:12] Right. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now
[1:17] you say they will not listen because of
[1:20] children. The children are supposed to
[1:23] know discipline from hope. Amen.
[1:26] Right. That's right. The children are
[1:28] not to come to Sunday school to learn
[1:31] the
[1:35] Sunday school is not to be the uh kinder
[1:39] garden,
[1:41] right? It's it's to be the house of God
[1:44] where they taught the word of God,
[1:47] right? And brought up in the faith. But
[1:51] in the modern age, we find parents that
[1:53] just dump their kids even in the schools
[1:55] and and the and the teachers
[1:58] unsaved or saved makes no difference. Uh
[2:01] the teacher supposed to train them.
[2:04] They're supposed to get manners from the
[2:06] teacher. They're supposed to have this.
[2:08] But yet, you are not to discipline them.
[2:10] Don't raise your boys. Matter of fact,
[2:11] one grandfather, one man took a a
[2:14] teacher to court because the teacher
[2:17] mentioned something about hell and said
[2:20] the child couldn't sleep all night.
[2:25] And you know, he just talk about, you
[2:27] know, something the kids were talking
[2:29] about and we asked him if there's a
[2:30] place called hell and he made a mistake
[2:32] of telling them what he knows about hell
[2:36] from the Bible. And actually, you know,
[2:38] the guys before the court because he
[2:40] described hell so graphic that the child
[2:43] went into a nightmare and and the
[2:46] parents were so angry. They didn't
[2:48] understand that they that was the
[2:50] opportunity to lead that child to
[2:53] Christ.
[2:54] Amen. They didn't know that that was the
[2:56] opportunity to lead that child to Christ
[2:58] right there because why did all the kids
[3:00] in the whole class, why did they not
[3:02] sleep the whole night? Because it wasn't
[3:04] for them. It was for that one child. and
[3:07] that child would have been led to
[3:08] Christ. But of course, they didn't
[3:10] understand that. But here we are. Praise
[3:13] God. He's saying here now children are
[3:16] supposed to know discipline and they
[3:18] should get it from home.
[3:21] And even if it's mine and my kid come
[3:24] here and get disorderly,
[3:26] I don't want you to draw back and draw
[3:29] one string uh because it's brother
[3:32] Brandham's kid, Sarah, Rebecca, Joseph
[3:35] or Millie, whoever it might be. You tell
[3:38] me and I'll see to it. And if they don't
[3:40] behave, then they'll stay away from
[3:43] church till they learn to behave. This
[3:45] is not an arena.
[3:48] That's right. Is that right?
[3:50] This is the house of God. Amen. This is
[3:54] not a place to play. Amen. And skate
[4:00] and write notes and laugh and joke. This
[4:05] is the house of God and is to be carried
[4:08] out.
[4:10] You come here to wash, not even to
[4:13] visit. It's not a picnic ground. It's
[4:16] not a visitation place. This is if you
[4:20] want to say it's a visitation place,
[4:22] it's a place for the Holy Spirit to do a
[4:24] visitation.
[4:26] Listen to what he has to say and to look
[4:28] not to one another. We don't come here
[4:31] to fellowship with one another. We come
[4:33] to fellowship with Christ himself. This
[4:36] is the house of worship and children
[4:38] must be disciplined by the parents. Let
[4:40] it be known that if these parents and
[4:43] the children will not listen to what
[4:44] these deacons say, then the parents
[4:47] should be corrected themselves. Right?
[4:50] Praise the Lord. You remember the other
[4:52] place where we said it's not a problem
[4:54] of juvenile delinquency. It's parental
[4:57] delinquency to their duty. Right? Praise
[5:00] the Lord. Hallelujah. The children are
[5:02] behaving that way because of delinquency
[5:04] of parents and it shows up. Praise God.
[5:08] Okay. Hallelujah. Now, so that's where
[5:12] we we we we have got through this now.
[5:16] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I don't
[5:18] want to repeat myself. He says, "Now
[5:22] then you may have to call in say,
[5:23] "Brother Jones or sister so and so,
[5:27] we've called you here for a meeting.
[5:29] You're part of us. You're one of us. Let
[5:32] me set this straight now." Amen. We have
[5:35] asked you to make your children behave.
[5:38] If they won't behave and you can't make
[5:41] them behave in the church, then we are
[5:44] going to advise you to leave them with
[5:46] someone while you come to church until
[5:51] they learn how to behave themselves in
[5:53] the house of God or you teach them to
[5:56] behave in the house of God. See, but
[5:58] this is an order for God's house and
[6:01] it's got to be carried out. Praise the
[6:04] Lord. Is that right? Praise God. Notice
[6:07] I like I mentioned to you that wasn't
[6:09] just for the natural children. That's
[6:11] for spiritual children too in Christ.
[6:13] Amen. We got to have godly behavior if
[6:16] we want to attract um invite, attract
[6:22] and keep the presence of the Holy Spirit
[6:26] working among us in such a way that at
[6:30] any time anything can break out.
[6:33] We don't have to have a special time,
[6:36] right? We don't necessarily have to jump
[6:38] like um
[6:40] prophets and keep a whole lot of noise
[6:43] and then we say that's the Holy Spirit.
[6:45] The Holy Spirit should be able to come
[6:46] anytime he chooses. Amen. Amen. Whether
[6:50] we are talking, whether we are singing,
[6:52] whether we shouting, whether we are
[6:54] quietly praying, he is sovereign and he
[6:57] reserves the right and we should allow
[6:59] him to step in the middle of the service
[7:02] at any time. Amen. Praise the Lord. Do
[7:06] you believe that? I believe in the Holy
[7:08] Spirit. I believe in the power and
[7:10] presence of God. And I um dedicate
[7:13] myself to um the restoration
[7:17] uh of the gifts, not only justification
[7:20] and sanctification. Amen. But I also
[7:23] believe in the restoration of the gifts
[7:25] that brother Brandon did only come to
[7:27] restore the word, but to demonstrate the
[7:30] gifts and then let us know that they're
[7:33] not gone back in the days of the
[7:34] apostles, but they are here for us
[7:37] today. Is that right? Too many pregnant
[7:40] only believe in the restoration of the
[7:41] word for the hour. But they don't
[7:43] realize they're looking for restoration
[7:45] and gifts back in the church too.
[7:48] And it's all here again for us. But if
[7:52] you're not conscious of it and you're
[7:54] not aware of it and then it begins to
[7:56] break out amongst you, if you don't know
[7:58] it, you could criticize it. You're going
[8:00] to call it this, you're going to call it
[8:02] that, and whatever else. But then if you
[8:04] understand what is really happening is
[8:07] that the church has to be perfect
[8:10] exactly like it was back in the
[8:12] beginning and God was just adding all
[8:15] the virtues that were in that church.
[8:18] All of Samson's hair that was on his
[8:22] head has to grow back.
[8:25] Every strand has back got to be back in
[8:28] place. Amen. So that he has the strength
[8:30] to defeat the devil. That's right. As we
[8:33] come to the end of jour of of the life's
[8:35] journey. Amen. Praise the Lord. Shall we
[8:37] pray?
[8:39] Our gracious heavenly father, once
[8:41] again, we thank you that father uh we
[8:44] welcome you and we thank you that you
[8:46] showed up and you took the word and
[8:49] spoke to us and we are living here with
[8:52] more understanding than when we came in.
[8:54] We are living here with a clearer uh
[8:57] crisper walk with God. We pray you'll
[9:01] strengthen everyone. And father, if
[9:03] there be one here tonight, uh troubled
[9:06] heart, troubled mind, we pray that you
[9:09] will speak peace to their soul. Peace
[9:13] be still.
[9:15] Let there be a great calm and confidence
[9:19] that we serve a living God who is able
[9:22] to deliver, able to provide, able to
[9:25] protect, able to watch over us, our
[9:28] children. our belongings, our home,
[9:32] everything that we have, everything that
[9:35] we love, you promise you'll watch over
[9:38] it. You'll protect it. Our children near
[9:41] and far, wherever they might be, Father,
[9:43] overshadow them with the great wings of
[9:46] the great Jehovah, Father. And now, as
[9:48] we go from this place, we come again on
[9:50] Sunday. We pray for the minister,
[9:52] brother, lighter gifts. May he truly be
[9:55] an enlightened spirit, anointing of the
[9:57] Holy Ghost to bring the word of God.
[10:00] Bless us, Father, as we come with
[10:02] thanksgiving in the house of God. I was
[10:04] glad when they settled on me. Let us go
[10:06] into the house of the Lord. My feet will
[10:09] stand within your gates, oh Jerusalem.
[10:12] Father, we grant it, Father God, and
[10:14] bless your people. And Father, add
[10:17] something to the church that will take
[10:19] us in another dimension every day, in
[10:23] every way. Let things in our lives get
[10:25] better and better and let us grow into
[10:28] your grace. Thank you, Father. Dismiss
[10:32] us with your blessings and your
[10:34] protection on the road and for the rest
[10:37] of the week. Give us, oh God, wisdom,
[10:40] knowledge, and favor with man, course
[10:45] favor with you, and favor with the
[10:47] people we have to deal with, so that all
[10:51] things should go smoothly and sweetly
[10:54] under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
[10:57] As we walk right into our blessings, as
[10:59] we walk right into our inheritance
[11:02] reserved in the heavens for us, we
[11:06] surrender to your perfect will and let
[11:08] the wind of God blow us where it will.
[11:11] The wind blows where it lists. No man
[11:13] knows where it goes. But sons of God,
[11:16] daughters of God, led by the spirit of
[11:18] God, this is what we surrender ourselves
[11:21] for. You take the praise, though. You
[11:23] take the honor and the glory, Father, in
[11:26] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. The Lord
[11:29] bless you, brothers and sisters. Amen.
[11:32] Praise the Lord.
[11:38] And follow Jesus
[11:42] to the cross
[11:46] every day.
[11:50] Don't be ashamed.
[11:54] [Music]
