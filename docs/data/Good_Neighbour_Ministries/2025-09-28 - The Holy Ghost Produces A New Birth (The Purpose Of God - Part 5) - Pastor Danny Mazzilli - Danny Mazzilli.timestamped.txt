[6:36] Praise God. Welcome to House of the

[6:45] Our
[6:48] scripture is taken from Psalm 16.
[6:51] [Music]
[6:54] Psalms 16.
[7:00] Preserve me, oh God,
[7:04] for indeed do I put up my trust.
[7:09] Oh my soul, thou has said unto the Lord,
[7:13] Thou are my Lord, my goodness extend not
[7:18] to thee,
[7:20] extend. Thou are my Lord, my goodness
[7:23] extended not to thee, but to the s to
[7:27] the saints that are in the earth,
[7:30] and to the excellent in whom is all my
[7:34] delight.
[7:36] Their sorrows shall be multiplied that
[7:39] hasten after another god. Their drink
[7:43] offerings of blood will I not offer nor
[7:47] take up their names into my lips.
[7:51] [Music]
[7:52] The Lord is the portion of my
[7:55] inheritance
[7:58] and of my cup. Thou maintainest my not.
[8:06] The lines are fallen onto me in pleasant
[8:09] places. Here I have a goodly heritage.
[8:15] I'll bless the Lord who had given me
[8:18] counsel.
[8:19] My reigns also instruct me in the night
[8:22] seasons.
[8:24] I have said the Lord I like this
[8:26] portion. Verse eight. I have said the
[8:29] Lord always before me because he is at
[8:33] my right hand. I shall not be moved.
[8:36] That's putting God
[8:38] in front of him. Amen. That's living his
[8:41] presence. Therefore, my heart is glad
[8:44] and my glory rejoice. My flesh shall
[8:48] also rest in hope.
[8:52] For thou will not leave my soul in hell,
[8:55] neither shalt thou suffer thy holy one
[8:58] to see corruption. The last verse. Let's
[9:01] read together. Verse 11.
[9:03] Thou will show me the path of life. In
[9:07] thy presence is fullness of joy. At thy
[9:11] right hand there are pleasures forever.
[9:14] Amen. Let's give God an applause and
[9:17] here to worship.

[43:31] different way. But if you're paying
[43:32] attention, you're hearing the same
[43:35] voice.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we're listening for the
[43:38] voice of God.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. When you listen to
[43:41] the tapes, you're listening for the same
[43:43] thing. You're listening for the voice of
[43:46] God.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. To speak to you in this day.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, we certainly
[43:53] appreciate the five-fold ministry uh of
[43:56] this hour. Amen.
[43:58] And so this morning, um, we're going to
[44:00] continue along where we've been kind of,
[44:03] uh, moving here over the last four or
[44:05] five services on the purpose of God.
[44:08] Amen. And more specifically, the purpose
[44:11] of the Holy Ghost in and what, you know,
[44:14] it it's to produce in in this day and in
[44:16] this hour. And I believe that it's
[44:19] something that um that I'm getting
[44:21] tremendously blessed from it. I'm
[44:23] telling you now. I'm just, you know,
[44:25] doing the studying and and just getting
[44:27] in there and feeding on the word. And
[44:29] it's amazing because uh remember the
[44:32] Holy Ghost in this hour
[44:34] gives you
[44:37] an open book revelation like you've
[44:40] never had before.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; And if you think that you know that that
[44:45] um you know it all or there's nothing
[44:48] else that you need to know,
[44:51] stop right there. Okay. There is so much
[44:55] more that the Lord is unveiling in this
[44:56] day and in this hour. And this is the
[44:59] beauty of this revelation of the Holy
[45:02] Ghost because the Holy Ghost person
[45:06] Christ himself.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; We've been talking about that, you know,
[45:09] the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy
[45:12] Spirit, the Holy Ghost, the baptism of
[45:14] the Holy Ghost. There's a difference.
[45:17] It's it is the same God. It is our Lord
[45:20] and Savior Jesus Christ but in different
[45:23] manifestations. You can be anointed. You
[45:26] can you can have the influence of the
[45:28] Holy Spirit. That's why you can come
[45:29] into services, you know, like the ones
[45:31] we had here for our our young people
[45:33] back in in August. You know, there was
[45:36] such a a baptism and an anointing that
[45:39] came into those services and everybody
[45:42] caught got caught into that anointing
[45:44] and it's wonderful, but it needs to
[45:47] produce and and and progress in the
[45:51] individual's life
[45:53] &gt;&gt; more than just the anointing. Amen.
[45:55] Praise God. And so that's why we want to
[45:57] make sure that that we are in contact
[45:59] with the person of the Holy Ghost. not
[46:03] only in contact with him, but allowing
[46:04] him in
[46:06] because when he comes in,
[46:09] it's a whole new life.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let's go to the word
[46:13] of God. Let's look at um our uh so today
[46:17] we're we're looking we're still looking
[46:19] into the purpose of the Holy Ghost. What
[46:21] is the purpose of the Holy Ghost? But
[46:23] today we're going to we're we're we're
[46:25] making a statement that the Holy Ghost
[46:28] produces a new birth. A lot of people
[46:31] think that, you know, they heard Jesus
[46:33] say, "You must be born again." And
[46:35] everybody just puts, you know, Christian
[46:37] denominations out there. Oh, yes, we're
[46:39] born again Christians. We've been born
[46:41] again. And meanwhile, they believe in a
[46:44] trinity. They don't they have no idea of
[46:46] the coming of the Lord. They don't
[46:48] understand the rapture. Just like to,
[46:50] you know, this week there was talk on
[46:52] the rapture and everything. Anyways,
[46:53] let's go to the word and then we can let
[46:55] the Holy Spirit speak to our hearts.
[46:57] Amen. Praise God. And so today we want
[47:00] to look at the birth uh birth. It's a
[47:03] new birth that the Holy Spirit that the
[47:05] Holy Ghost produces in this hour. And a
[47:08] lot of people in this message, believe
[47:10] it or not, have not even been birthed.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's it's it's a pretty powerful
[47:16] statement, but it's going to stir hearts
[47:18] and lives. And like I said right from
[47:20] the very beginning, if you feel a little
[47:22] bit uncomfortable as the word is coming
[47:24] forth, that's okay. Just check your
[47:27] walk, check your experience and and see
[47:30] what the what the Holy Ghost is
[47:32] producing in your life. Amen. Praise
[47:34] God. So let's go to our scripture. Acts
[47:36] chapter 1 verses 7 to8
[47:41] and let's just ask the Lord for a
[47:43] blessing. Father, does anybody have a
[47:46] need this morning? An extra uh say Lord
[47:48] remember me. Remember this situation.
[47:51] Lord you see every uplifted hand in the
[47:54] house this morning. Father, mine are
[47:56] both lifted up. Father, there's so many
[47:58] needs, Lord. Oh, God. Lord, as long as
[48:01] we're here in this dimension, Lord, we
[48:03] are going to have to overcome.
[48:06] And Lord, I had to overcome this morning
[48:08] to get here. And Lord, I know that every
[48:11] single one of us here in the house of
[48:13] the Lord this morning, if they're having
[48:15] a real walk with you, Lord, the enemy
[48:17] don't like it. And it's going to be a
[48:19] battle every time to get into the house
[48:21] of the Lord. It'll be a battle every
[48:23] time to turn on that service and to tune
[48:26] in to receive what God has. But Lord,
[48:29] you never disappoint. That's the one
[48:32] thing that I am certain of, Father. That
[48:35] Lord, if our hearts are are are
[48:37] genuinely sincere this morning to
[48:39] receive something from you, you will
[48:42] come. You will speak. You will meet
[48:44] needs. You will deliver. You will set
[48:46] free. You will open the blinded eyes.
[48:48] You will, Lord, you'll raise the dead,
[48:51] Father. Oh, God. Let it be done this
[48:53] morning as your word comes forth and do
[48:55] a great work in our midst. Lord, we
[48:57] surrender ourselves to your service,
[48:59] Lord. Bless your people. Take us into
[49:01] heavenly places. In Jesus' name we pray.
[49:04] Amen. And amen. Praise God. And in Acts
[49:08] 1 7 to8 it said and he said unto them
[49:11] and Jesus speaking here because he had
[49:13] just appeared you know to the to the
[49:15] disciples he said it is not for you to
[49:18] know the times or the seasons which the
[49:21] father hath put in his own power. Amen.
[49:26] So we need to realize here that that
[49:28] that that God is the supreme authority
[49:32] that the power that he's talking about
[49:34] here his own power is his authority his
[49:40] plan his absolute
[49:43] uh vision that he had from before the
[49:46] foundations of the world. Amen. That's
[49:49] something that that you or I we don't
[49:51] have control over that but we come into
[49:54] it. Amen. And this is how we come in.
[49:57] But ye receive power. He's talking about
[50:00] a different power here. The power that
[50:03] he's talking about when he says that the
[50:05] father hath his own power, that's
[50:07] authority. Amen. That's his authority.
[50:11] Then he's talking about that you shall
[50:13] receive power. And look, after that the
[50:17] Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye
[50:21] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[50:25] Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria,
[50:29] and unto the uttermost part of the
[50:33] earth. The Lord add his blessing to the
[50:35] word of God. Amen. You may be seated.
[50:38] Praise God. You know here Jesus was
[50:41] making it very clear that first of all
[50:46] there was a dispensational change. Amen.
[50:50] That because the people were asking him
[50:53] you know how we're going to know and
[50:54] what what you know h how will we know uh
[50:58] you know the time in the season that
[51:00] we're in? And he says, "Don't worry
[51:02] about that because I'm going to send you
[51:05] the power that you need by the Holy
[51:08] Ghost." And that when you receive the
[51:10] Holy Ghost in your day, it's going to
[51:13] it's going to lead you into all truth.
[51:16] It's going to open the scripture in such
[51:18] a way that you, you know, all of a
[51:20] sudden now you're going to be able to
[51:22] understand why there's so much confusion
[51:25] out in the world when it comes to
[51:27] Christianity. We've got thousands of
[51:29] denominations, Christian denominations,
[51:33] all kinds of interpretations.
[51:35] But Jesus made it very clear that he
[51:38] would send the Holy Ghost and then you
[51:41] could really truly be a witness because
[51:43] you need to you need to know what you
[51:46] know what the Holy Ghost is all about.
[51:49] Amen. It's not about you getting your
[51:51] own understanding. You're you getting
[51:54] your own interpretation on on what
[51:56] Christianity is. No, it's you receiving
[51:59] him, his purpose,
[52:02] and you be setting you being set aside
[52:05] now in the day that you're living in to
[52:08] actually bring forth the manifestation
[52:12] or the interpretation
[52:14] of what it is to be a Christian.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; In this day,
[52:18] &gt;&gt; a true understanding of Christianity.
[52:21] Amen. Glory to God. there'd be a genuine
[52:25] experience that when the Holy Ghost
[52:27] comes upon you, you will know that you
[52:30] know.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to I can't I can't
[52:34] um you know uh emphasize it or make it
[52:37] any clearer than what I'm saying when I
[52:40] say to you, you will know, you will be
[52:43] changed. You will not have the same
[52:46] desires. You will be transformed. You
[52:50] will be like a like you know when when
[52:52] John said that I baptize you unto
[52:54] repentance but he that cometh after me
[52:57] which is and we know is the Lord Jesus
[53:01] Christ he's going to baptize you with
[53:03] fire and the Holy Ghost.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the fire you know a lot of
[53:08] people you got to understand what the
[53:10] fire is. Well, listen, fire, you know,
[53:13] it's like a person like I I remember
[53:16] when the Holy Ghost came into my life,
[53:19] when I when I realized that that my God,
[53:22] I'm I'm I'm actually possessed by the
[53:24] spirit of God because
[53:27] you become like a house on fire.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; The fire is the zeal for the word of
[53:32] God. And all of a sudden you re, you
[53:34] know, you want to tell everybody,
[53:36] &gt;&gt; you want to let everybody know your
[53:38] family and you cause a complete and
[53:41] total religious disturbance in your life
[53:43] when this happens.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; You show me one birth that isn't messy.
[53:49] Every birth is messy.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why when the Holy Ghost
[53:54] comes, you'll know it.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost has a purpose. when
[54:00] it comes upon us, there is there is a
[54:03] visible change that our old life is now
[54:06] secondary to the new life.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; It's it's automatic. You you can't help
[54:12] but talk about him.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; You're talking about him. You're reading
[54:16] about him. You're every everywhere you
[54:18] look, you look into nature, you're going
[54:20] to see him.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; He's everywhere because all of a sudden,
[54:24] there's a new nature that's come upon
[54:26] you. Amen. Praise God. The old life
[54:29] dies. Your way of thinking changes. Your
[54:32] way of living changes. Your soul starts
[54:36] to thirst after the living God.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you that, you know, a an
[54:42] experience of the Holy Ghost. You get a
[54:45] thirst for the living God.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; You want to know what God's doing right
[54:49] now.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; You want to understand how it is that my
[54:52] life is is in the situation that it is
[54:54] right now and know that God can change
[54:57] it right now.
[54:58] that you don't have to stay in the
[55:00] condition that you might find yourself
[55:02] in, you know, because you're still
[55:04] human. You're still going to have to
[55:06] overcome. You're still going to get
[55:08] depressed. You're still going to have to
[55:11] fight. You're still going to have to
[55:13] fight for your family, for your loved
[55:15] ones, for your finance, for your health.
[55:18] Many there's people going like look at
[55:20] Sister Sheila. She's been Ela. She's
[55:23] been fighting for her life. Amen.
[55:26] Because over the last couple years,
[55:28] she's gone through so much. But there's
[55:30] something keeping her.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost. The purpose of God.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; The purpose of God once it gets in you,
[55:40] it overrides the disease.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; It overrides the depression.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; It overrides the the the the lack of of
[55:50] your needs. It overrides your mistakes.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Glory to
[55:56] God. Brother Brandham said that when you
[55:59] make a mistake as a son or a daughter of
[56:02] God, that's you can make mistakes with
[56:04] the Holy Ghost.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be perfect when you
[56:09] receive him. He's perfect.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not going to be
[56:14] perfect till this gets changed. Amen.
[56:16] But he says that when you as a son or a
[56:18] daughter of God makes a mistake,
[56:21] something cries out of you and says, "Oh
[56:24] God,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; forgive me, Lord. I didn't mean to say
[56:27] that." And right there, Brother Bram
[56:29] said, "And right there, God doesn't even
[56:31] see it."
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. This is the God that
[56:37] we serve. Listen. Listen. God had to
[56:41] make a way for you in this age
[56:45] &gt;&gt; in a condition like the world is in
[56:48] right now. He needed to make a way for
[56:50] you
[56:51] &gt;&gt; to to overcome this age. Amen. And he
[56:55] knew exactly what he'd have to give you.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Glory. Amen. Listen,
[57:04] John the Baptist, you know, like when
[57:05] when John the Baptist saw
[57:09] Jesus coming into the Jordan, okay? He
[57:12] knew right there and then that he was he
[57:16] was going to be going through a
[57:17] dispensational change because he knew
[57:20] who he was. He recognized the the the
[57:24] the anointing and the word that he was
[57:28] actually fulfilling. He actually quoted
[57:30] it back to the people cuz they came to
[57:32] him. The people were in confusion just
[57:34] like today. There's people all over the
[57:37] earth call themselves Christians, but
[57:40] they still you go and ask them, "Have
[57:41] you received the Holy Ghost?"
[57:44] I can see that you're a believer, but
[57:46] have you received the Holy Ghost
[57:50] since you believe? Because I can see
[57:52] you're a believer. But just like in the
[57:55] day of John, he had to say, "You need to
[57:58] repent. You need to turn from your
[58:01] traditions, your understanding of the
[58:03] word because now the word himself is
[58:07] coming on the scene." And he realized
[58:10] right there and then that he would have
[58:13] to decrease.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; He would have to go off and so that
[58:18] Christ could come on. Amen. And these
[58:21] are the things that that have taken
[58:23] place in our day under the message of
[58:27] this hour. And people are failing to
[58:30] recognize the dispensational changes
[58:34] when the Holy Ghost is introduced to the
[58:37] people by the teaching of the word. Even
[58:40] brother Brandham says that the people
[58:41] don't understand the Holy Ghost because
[58:44] of lack of teaching.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; That's what this is all about here. When
[58:49] I started to look into this and dig
[58:51] deeper into it and and listen to
[58:53] sermons, you know, that that that
[58:55] individuals that have caught the
[58:57] revelation of this of this hour when it
[59:00] comes to understanding what the Holy
[59:03] Ghost is to produce, it changed. The
[59:06] book becomes a new book. All of a
[59:08] sudden, you start to see things and
[59:10] realize, "Oh my God, I was I was seeing
[59:14] it this way having not a clarity of
[59:16] understanding." But I believe as we move
[59:19] through this, you're going to be blessed
[59:22] to see how clear and and it's going to
[59:24] vindicate where you're standing. It's
[59:27] going to give you confidence to stand
[59:29] where you are and to know that you're
[59:31] not standing on some slimy sand that's
[59:34] going to that's going to allow you to
[59:37] fall into the sea when that great
[59:39] earthquake takes place. No, you're going
[59:41] to be standing on a rock and you're
[59:43] going to have a revelation that's going
[59:44] to take you right out. Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we need to understand that
[59:51] when the Holy Ghost
[59:54] changes dispensation
[59:56] and is progressing from age to age, a
[1:00:01] new birth is actually required.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; A brand new birth. You mean you can be
[1:00:07] born again? Yes.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Again?
[1:00:12] because you thought what you were under
[1:00:14] was going to produce the things in your
[1:00:17] life and you're looking at everything
[1:00:19] and you're looking at the confusion. You
[1:00:21] see yourself in a church. You see that
[1:00:23] there's division. You see, listen, as
[1:00:26] long as you go to church, there's going
[1:00:28] to be three kinds of believers in every
[1:00:29] church.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; It's going to be right to the very end.
[1:00:32] The true believer, the makebeliever, and
[1:00:36] the unbeliever. Amen. And those three
[1:00:39] are always going to be in the midst. And
[1:00:42] and so understanding that that there's
[1:00:44] an absolute truth that the Holy Ghost
[1:00:47] will progress us onto you surrender now
[1:00:52] to understand that there's a
[1:00:54] dispensational change that can take
[1:00:57] place in my day that that could actually
[1:01:01] bring a greater understanding of what
[1:01:04] the word is to produce and how it's
[1:01:06] going to produce the rapture.
[1:01:09] Because remember the message that we
[1:01:12] speak and that we preach in this day and
[1:01:15] in this hour is the message for the
[1:01:18] rapture of the church.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Rapturing faith lies within the open
[1:01:26] word for this day and this hour.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Rapturing faith lays within the Holy
[1:01:32] Ghost
[1:01:34] for this hour. Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; The same God, but what he's doing now.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, listen here in uh you can go
[1:01:43] to the first quote there
[1:01:46] uh voice of the sign. Look, look at
[1:01:49] John. No selfishness in him. He never
[1:01:51] took any glory.
[1:01:54] They tried to call him the Messiah. Now,
[1:01:57] I want you to as I'm reading this, I
[1:01:59] want you to think about the day we're
[1:02:00] living in. How God sent us a prophet. uh
[1:02:04] uh Malachi 4:5, William Branham, the
[1:02:08] messenger to the Pentecostal age, to the
[1:02:10] Leodysian church age. I want you to
[1:02:13] understand how it was how he was
[1:02:16] misinterpreted and how he was
[1:02:18] interpreted and how he is even today
[1:02:21] being misinterpreted.
[1:02:23] Amen. But the Holy Ghost brings a clear
[1:02:26] interpretation of who he is, where he
[1:02:29] stands, and where you stand.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "No selfishness in him."
[1:02:34] He never took any glory. They tried to
[1:02:36] call him the Messiah. That's what they
[1:02:38] did to William Brandham, too. I'm not
[1:02:41] worthy to lose his shoes. But as soon as
[1:02:43] Jesus appeared, he had a sign, a pillar
[1:02:47] of fire, a light above him like a dove
[1:02:51] come down a voice saying, "This is my
[1:02:54] beloved son whom I'm well pleased."
[1:03:00] If you go and you actually get the
[1:03:01] interpretation of that, who I'm who I'm
[1:03:03] well pleased, it's whom I'm pleased to
[1:03:06] dwell in.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; God was coming to dwell
[1:03:12] as God in a man.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; That's what it was.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Not you know the father, the son, and
[1:03:18] the holy ghost three in one. No, no, no,
[1:03:21] no. God was now changing manifestation.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. of Almighty God, the self-existent
[1:03:29] one, who had to make the sacrifice
[1:03:33] himself. Amen. Glory to God. Come down
[1:03:37] and take a human vessel.
[1:03:41] Called it the Son, which was Jesus,
[1:03:45] Jehovah, God with us, Emmanuel. The word
[1:03:50] was made flesh and dwelt among us. How
[1:03:54] many interpretations do you want?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was God himself
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; saying, "I'm now come down.
[1:04:02] My word is going to which is which was
[1:04:04] the Holy Ghost." Okay. The person of God
[1:04:08] himself now coming into a human man
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; to show that he could unite with man
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; so that he could redeem us
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; in man form.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Okay? That's why he became man so that
[1:04:24] he could redeem us.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; A man had to go to Calvary. God didn't
[1:04:30] go to Calvary.
[1:04:32] A human vessel
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; that was ordained
[1:04:39] as a man went to Calvary to die a
[1:04:42] sacrifice. God could not die. God can't
[1:04:46] die.
[1:04:47] That's why the Holy Ghost, that's why
[1:04:49] brother Brandham says that God left him
[1:04:51] at the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; and he had to go to the cross as a man
[1:04:56] and suffer as a man and came under
[1:04:59] obedience to the call which was the word
[1:05:02] that said that that he would be the
[1:05:05] sacrificial lamb that would go to
[1:05:08] Calvary. He he says, "I come not to do
[1:05:12] my own will." He says, "I come to do the
[1:05:15] will of the father, which was the will
[1:05:18] of the father." The word for the day.
[1:05:21] Jesus was the word in his day to go to
[1:05:24] Calvary and die for your sin, my sin,
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; so that he could send back the Holy
[1:05:30] Ghost
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; himself, the person now in multiplied
[1:05:35] form. Amen. And so here, this is my
[1:05:38] beloved son whom I'm well pleased.
[1:05:40] Notice. And John immediately said, "He
[1:05:42] must increase.
[1:05:45] The Lord must increase. I must
[1:05:47] decrease." He presented the church to
[1:05:50] Christ.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; He was actually presenting the church to
[1:05:54] Christ. Those that had received John's
[1:05:57] message that had received repentance by
[1:06:01] being baptized unto repentance from what
[1:06:03] they were believing because they were
[1:06:05] all believing wrong. They had an
[1:06:07] interpretation of how the Messiah was
[1:06:08] going to come. And look at all the
[1:06:10] religious leaders of that day didn't
[1:06:14] recognize him. What does that tell you?
[1:06:18] It's going to happen again.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; It's exactly what's happened again.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; I hate to be the bearer of, you know,
[1:06:26] tough news. But you know what? 98% of
[1:06:30] the churches that call themselves
[1:06:32] Christians out there have missed him
[1:06:34] again.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; They're waiting on his coming. They're
[1:06:38] waiting on the clouds of glory to
[1:06:40] display this great announcement of the
[1:06:43] Lord Jesus. They're looking for people
[1:06:45] to go in the rapture. Some people think
[1:06:47] that they're going to be changed and
[1:06:48] their bodies are going to lift and we're
[1:06:50] going to see people raising up their
[1:06:52] bodies going up into the air.
[1:06:55] That's why this week they made they made
[1:06:57] fun of it. Actually CNN had a an a news
[1:07:00] article, you know, they a video that I
[1:07:02] watched and and they were talking about,
[1:07:04] you know, this guy that was in Africa
[1:07:06] that had that that God had spoken to
[1:07:08] him. The rapture was going to happen on
[1:07:11] September the 23rd.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; God had showed him. People were getting
[1:07:16] ready. People were doing everything to
[1:07:18] to be prepared for the rapture that it
[1:07:20] was going to happen. They have no idea
[1:07:23] that the rapture is already in progress.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; That you are already in the rapture.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; One's going to be in the bed. One's
[1:07:32] going to be taken. One's going to be in
[1:07:33] the field. One's going to be taken how?
[1:07:36] By this message.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Because the rapture is Christ. It is the
[1:07:41] word for your day. And and it's a
[1:07:44] revelation of what God is doing. That's
[1:07:46] why when you get changed in the
[1:07:48] twinkling of an eye,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; that's going to be the final stage of
[1:07:52] what he's doing right now in your life
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; by the opening of the word in you and
[1:07:58] giving you a revelation of who you are,
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; where you belong,
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; what the Holy Ghost is supposed to
[1:08:04] produce, how it changes your life, that
[1:08:07] it's not some just sign your name on a
[1:08:10] on a church and now you're a member of a
[1:08:12] church. They have a total they are
[1:08:15] completely blind to the revelation of
[1:08:18] the rapture. Why? Because they missed
[1:08:21] the messenger for their age.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. God had a messenger in the 20th
[1:08:27] century. Malachi 4:5. Oh, they'll
[1:08:30] recognize John L John Wesley. They'll
[1:08:32] recognize Martin Luther. Oh, they'll
[1:08:35] recognize, you know, Swingley and all
[1:08:37] these different Calvin and all these
[1:08:39] other, you know, men of God that that
[1:08:42] were on the mission fields, but they
[1:08:44] failed to recognize the prophet that God
[1:08:48] sent. He says, "Behold, I'll send you
[1:08:50] Elijah the prophet. He'll turn you back
[1:08:53] to the word.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; He'll give you He'll have a teaching
[1:08:57] that'll bring you back to the word of
[1:08:58] God." That's the that was the the the
[1:09:01] the purpose of the prophet. and then
[1:09:03] that he would fulfill Revelations
[1:09:05] 10:1-7, the opening of those seven
[1:09:08] seals, which would actually bring Christ
[1:09:11] back to earth again.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It would be another new birth.
[1:09:17] That's why the prophet said, "This book
[1:09:19] is a brand new Bible to me." It's
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; because now he was possessed of the Holy
[1:09:24] Ghost. He was the first fruits of the
[1:09:26] bride of Christ moving into the bride
[1:09:29] age to recognize there's going to be a
[1:09:31] word that's going to actually bring the
[1:09:34] mystical body of Christ, Adam and Eve,
[1:09:37] right back together to be one again.
[1:09:39] Glory. Hallelujah. So here he says, I
[1:09:42] must increase.
[1:09:45] I must uh he must increase. I must
[1:09:47] decrease. He presented the church to
[1:09:49] Christ. Amen. And we are told that in
[1:09:51] the last days that will repeat again.
[1:09:54] That's what I was just talking about. I
[1:09:56] got a little bit ahead of the quote.
[1:09:58] Amen. There's going to be a message come
[1:10:01] forth. Glory to God. That will introduce
[1:10:04] the Messiah to the people. And it'll be
[1:10:07] in such a way they'll stand dumbfounded
[1:10:10] like they did then. He promised it.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; And it's happening again.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're down the road, saints. It's
[1:10:18] happening again. where the where the
[1:10:21] mighty angel himself under the ministry
[1:10:24] of a five-fold ministry where he's got
[1:10:26] individuals that have recognized and
[1:10:28] receive the Holy Ghost in their day and
[1:10:32] receive the new birth in their day which
[1:10:35] allows them to look back into the word
[1:10:37] and see exactly what the word is to
[1:10:40] produce in their day.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus understood what the
[1:10:45] word was to produce in his day.
[1:10:48] He's got to go to Calvary
[1:10:51] regardless of what any but Peter comes
[1:10:53] to him and says, "Lord," he says,
[1:10:55] "What?" When when when he told him that
[1:10:57] he must die and that he, "No way." Peter
[1:11:00] says, "You're not going. You're not
[1:11:02] going to There's no way you're going.
[1:11:04] I'm going to go with you. I'll I I'll
[1:11:05] stop them. I'll do everything." He says,
[1:11:07] "Now look what Jesus turns around and
[1:11:09] says,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Peter, no." He said, "Satan, get behind
[1:11:13] me."
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Because he knew what was talking through
[1:11:16] Peter. Amen.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; He realized
[1:11:20] Jesus was the word. He knew what the
[1:11:23] word was going to produce. He wasn't
[1:11:25] going to let anything stop him in
[1:11:28] fulfilling the word for his day.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Didn't matter if everybody denied him
[1:11:33] just like they did. Only a dozen
[1:11:35] followed him. And even they needed to
[1:11:37] receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And that's why a lot of
[1:11:41] people have received Christ
[1:11:45] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost, in the
[1:11:48] baptism of the Holy Spirit, under the
[1:11:52] teachings, but have not actually allowed
[1:11:56] him to come in
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; and take over so that his purpose can be
[1:12:02] fulfilled in every individual life.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God forever more.
[1:12:10] He's interested in every individual.
[1:12:14] Praise God. And so here now, we know
[1:12:18] that when we talk about the Holy Spirit,
[1:12:20] when we talk about the Holy Ghost, we're
[1:12:22] talking about being separated. When you
[1:12:25] receive the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost
[1:12:28] into your life, it's because God is
[1:12:31] separating you for a purpose. And the
[1:12:34] purpose in this day is to manifest the
[1:12:37] word of the hour.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; The the revealed word which will
[1:12:43] identify prophecy. It identify current
[1:12:46] events. The word will identify Israel
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; because it's the Holy Ghost. Remember,
[1:12:52] he knows all things. But you know,
[1:12:56] that's why with w with with with the
[1:12:58] Holy Ghost, you're going to you're going
[1:13:00] to take man's interpretation. You're
[1:13:02] going to take your own emotional
[1:13:04] understanding and interpretation when
[1:13:06] you see certain riots going on. People
[1:13:08] look at all these riots, people seeing,
[1:13:11] you know, like what's going on in Israel
[1:13:12] in Gaza there, thousands of people being
[1:13:15] killed. It's sad. It's absolutely
[1:13:18] terrible what's going on. But they don't
[1:13:21] realize that this is prophetic. This is
[1:13:24] prophecy. They don't understand the
[1:13:27] position of Israel. why Israel is able
[1:13:30] to stand as long as they've been
[1:13:32] standing to this day. It's it's it's
[1:13:35] God. They could never have done it
[1:13:38] without God's purpose
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; in their nation
[1:13:44] in in their in in in the word. Every
[1:13:47] promise that he made back in the Old
[1:13:49] Testament, that purpose will be
[1:13:52] fulfilled in the nation of Israel.
[1:13:55] Nobody can stop it. There's nothing that
[1:13:57] can change it. They will never divide
[1:14:00] the land. I'm telling you now, God says,
[1:14:02] "I shall I will not allow you to divide
[1:14:04] the land."
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; And if God says you're not going to
[1:14:07] divide the land, who's going to who's
[1:14:08] going to go over override God's word?
[1:14:11] They want to they think that they can do
[1:14:13] it, but that's because they're under a
[1:14:16] an illusion. They're under a delusion.
[1:14:18] They're under a reprobate understanding
[1:14:21] of the word.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; That's why it's all about the word.
[1:14:27] understanding what God has declared for
[1:14:30] us in this day and in this hour. So, we
[1:14:32] understand that that when when the Holy
[1:14:36] Ghost when we're talking about the Holy
[1:14:38] Ghost coming into your life, it's
[1:14:40] because God's purpose in relation to,
[1:14:45] with, and in man.
[1:14:49] That's what the Holy Ghost is all about.
[1:14:54] his relation to man, with man, in man.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And this is the hour where it's in man
[1:15:02] to manifest himself in the church, in
[1:15:06] the bride, in the the the the the true
[1:15:09] church of the hour. There's got to be
[1:15:11] one original.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; I know everybody out there, oh, what you
[1:15:14] saying? You're the only church. I'm not
[1:15:16] saying I'm the only church. We're not
[1:15:18] saying Good Neighbor Ministries is the
[1:15:19] only church. We're saying that the body
[1:15:21] of Christ is the only church
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; and he is the word.
[1:15:27] Amen. That's that's what we're saying.
[1:15:30] We're not we're not putting, you know,
[1:15:31] we're not we're not identifying names of
[1:15:33] churches and people. We're identifying
[1:15:36] the word of God, the body of Christ in
[1:15:41] this day and in this hour. Amen. Praise
[1:15:44] God. So, let's move on because we're
[1:15:47] looking at things here um you know in
[1:15:49] the scripture. We want to look at Acts 2
[1:15:52] 37-38.
[1:15:54] Very familiar scripture, but it it's a
[1:15:58] new book to me. Now I read these
[1:16:00] scriptures, I'm seeing things that I
[1:16:02] never saw before.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This this word never stops
[1:16:06] unveiling itself. Amen. Praise God,
[1:16:08] brother Phillip. It's wonderful. Listen
[1:16:11] now, when they heard this, now remember,
[1:16:14] this is the day of Pentecost. They had
[1:16:17] just come out of the upper room. There's
[1:16:19] all kinds of, you know, uh, disciples,
[1:16:22] 120 of them come running into the
[1:16:24] streets. They are rejoicing because the
[1:16:27] Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost has come
[1:16:29] upon them. Amen. They're speaking in
[1:16:32] tongues. They were speaking. Now, if you
[1:16:34] go back and read and understand and look
[1:16:37] into, they were speaking in languages of
[1:16:40] the day.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; They weren't speaking gibberish.
[1:16:45] There was actual language that was being
[1:16:48] spoken and there was people that were
[1:16:51] hearing it in their own language because
[1:16:53] there was people from Samaria. There was
[1:16:55] different they were from different
[1:16:56] regions receiving the word in their day
[1:17:01] by the Holy Ghost. They were hearing
[1:17:03] their own language. When God wants to
[1:17:06] speak to you, you're going to hear him.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're going to hear the the
[1:17:10] interpretation of what it means, what
[1:17:13] what he actually means in his word when
[1:17:16] you're hearing the word. That's a type
[1:17:18] of hearing the word for your day. Amen.
[1:17:21] Hearing it in a language that you're
[1:17:23] going to understand, which is by
[1:17:25] revelation.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Now, when they heard this, they were
[1:17:30] pricricked in their hearts, the people,
[1:17:32] and said unto Peter and the rest of the
[1:17:34] apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall
[1:17:36] we do?" Then Peter said unto themreent
[1:17:40] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:17:44] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:17:47] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:17:50] of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is
[1:17:54] unto you and to your children and to all
[1:17:58] that are a far off, even as many as the
[1:18:01] Lord our God shall call.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So here now when we
[1:18:09] look at this scripture
[1:18:12] we are seeing here that
[1:18:15] remember when John was on the scene what
[1:18:18] was he saying to the people? Repent for
[1:18:22] he is coming.
[1:18:24] Repent from your understanding. Turn
[1:18:27] away what it is. What is it to repent?
[1:18:30] People think that oh I got to stop you
[1:18:33] know I got to stop lying. I got to stop
[1:18:35] drinking. I got to stop smoking. Uh, you
[1:18:38] know, I got to stop going into the wrong
[1:18:40] places. They think that that is the
[1:18:42] interpretation of repent. Thinking that
[1:18:45] it's those things,
[1:18:47] those are the attributes of sin.
[1:18:50] What you need to repent of is your
[1:18:53] interpretation
[1:18:55] of how you see the word of God.
[1:18:59] people are are are placing their own
[1:19:02] interpretation or their church's
[1:19:04] interpretation or their their their
[1:19:07] pastor's interpretation or their
[1:19:09] organization's interpretation on the
[1:19:11] word thinking that that that uh you know
[1:19:16] is the way that it is. But remember, to
[1:19:20] truly repent is to turn away from
[1:19:24] everything the way that you thought it
[1:19:27] was and allow the spirit of God to
[1:19:31] interpret it to you.
[1:19:36] So
[1:19:38] notice
[1:19:40] when there's true genuine repentance
[1:19:43] and you are baptized into the name of
[1:19:46] Jesus Christ. A lot of people don't even
[1:19:49] understand that.
[1:19:50] They think, "Oh, I just need to go into
[1:19:54] water and pronounce
[1:19:56] and speak it this way, and that is going
[1:20:00] to
[1:20:01] give them the Holy Ghost because I've
[1:20:04] done it the right way." That's not it,
[1:20:06] saints. You can, like we've talked many
[1:20:09] times, you can go into that water, but
[1:20:12] if you have not truly repented and been
[1:20:16] changed because that's the first thing,
[1:20:19] nothing is going to happen. And then if
[1:20:22] you don't take on his name, what is the
[1:20:24] name of Jesus Christ? Jesus himself
[1:20:27] says, I come in my father's name.
[1:20:31] What was he saying? I'm coming in the
[1:20:34] life
[1:20:35] of the Holy Ghost. The self-existent,
[1:20:38] the almighty, the life of God.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; His name is a person. It's a life. It's
[1:20:46] a purpose. It has a plan. It has a
[1:20:49] destiny. It has a desire to fulfill his
[1:20:52] own purpose of redemption to redeem his
[1:20:55] sons and daughters. So when you take on
[1:20:58] his actual name, you're taking on the
[1:21:01] actual life of God in you.
[1:21:06] when you're you're you're you're
[1:21:08] accepting him as your Lord, your Savior.
[1:21:11] Remember, baptism is an outward
[1:21:13] expression of something that's already
[1:21:16] happened on the inside.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; And then you shall receive the gift
[1:21:22] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:24] Now, the gift of the Holy Ghost is not
[1:21:27] something that you deserved that you did
[1:21:31] to receive it. It's a gift. Notice he
[1:21:34] said, "You shall receive a gift." A
[1:21:38] gift.
[1:21:40] Somebody brings you a gift. If you don't
[1:21:42] receive it, you don't get it.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; So, you need to receive the gift and you
[1:21:48] need to understand that it was not given
[1:21:50] to you for any other reason other than
[1:21:53] he had a purpose in giving it to you.
[1:21:56] There's individuals that are ordained
[1:21:59] because there's life inside of them from
[1:22:01] before the foundations of the world that
[1:22:04] are to receive the gift.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; And that's how we need to understand how
[1:22:10] God is calling each and every
[1:22:13] individual. It's not because you did
[1:22:15] something. He put no conditions on it.
[1:22:18] That's why it's a gift. We put
[1:22:20] conditions on it. Oh, before I get
[1:22:22] baptized, I got to go and I got to clean
[1:22:24] up my life. Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
[1:22:29] You do need to, you know, be be, you
[1:22:31] know, conscious that you need to clean
[1:22:33] up your life. But you need to also
[1:22:35] understand that if you receive this
[1:22:37] gift, it's not going to be because of
[1:22:39] your own works. It's not going to be
[1:22:41] because of you doing something. It's not
[1:22:44] going to be we need to take ourselves
[1:22:45] out of the picture
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; and don't look at our own abilities
[1:22:50] based base our experience on on on on
[1:22:53] anything else but the promise of his
[1:22:56] word.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; And when you place your experience
[1:23:01] not on well you know the the the the
[1:23:04] individual told me if I go get baptized
[1:23:06] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:07] I'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:09] No, no. You need to base the experience
[1:23:12] on your genuine faith in the word
[1:23:17] that that that you and the word have
[1:23:19] connected that now you're you're seeing
[1:23:22] something that you never saw before.
[1:23:25] You're recognizing an element in the
[1:23:28] word that that that your faith is now
[1:23:30] going to demonstrate that it's actually
[1:23:32] in you. that it's not because you're
[1:23:34] being that that that you're that you're
[1:23:36] being uh you know coerced or being
[1:23:39] convinced to come to the water of
[1:23:41] baptism. No, no, no. It's because
[1:23:44] something genuinely took place in your
[1:23:47] heart that has that is that has that has
[1:23:51] caught your attention to the word
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; to now you're looking at the word and
[1:23:55] you're saying, "Yeah, I can see it as
[1:23:58] clear as a bell. It says, "Be baptized
[1:24:00] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:24:03] Why do they baptize into the titles of
[1:24:05] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? Well,
[1:24:07] because Jesus said in Matthew 28:19,
[1:24:10] "You can be baptized. Go into all the
[1:24:11] world baptizing them in the name of the
[1:24:15] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[1:24:17] Ghost." Jesus said, "I come in my
[1:24:18] father's name."
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; So, what was the name of God?
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus. Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; And that's why on the day of Pentecost
[1:24:27] when Jesus told all the disciples and
[1:24:30] Peter was right there he when he said go
[1:24:33] ye into all the world and baptize in the
[1:24:36] name of the father. Peter on the day of
[1:24:38] penet we just read it and Peter told
[1:24:41] them to repent and be baptized in the
[1:24:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Why
[1:24:47] didn't he say in the name of the father
[1:24:48] son and holy ghost? Because he had a
[1:24:51] genuine revelation. Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; He had a genuine experience by the word.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; He had recognized that the word had
[1:24:59] spoken to him and awakened something
[1:25:02] inside of him that he didn't even fully
[1:25:04] comprehend, but all he could do was say,
[1:25:06] "Amen."
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; I believe it. And that's what's going to
[1:25:09] come out of you when you truly genuinely
[1:25:12] make God your absolute. You're going to
[1:25:14] just say amen to the word of God. You
[1:25:16] may not fully understand it just yet,
[1:25:19] but I believe God.
[1:25:21] I believe if God needs to turn me
[1:25:23] around, God needs to open my
[1:25:25] understanding, if God needs to remove
[1:25:27] certain things out of my life, he can do
[1:25:29] it.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; I trust in it. I I believe in it. Now
[1:25:33] you're Now you're getting somewhere. Now
[1:25:35] you're on the right road. Amen. Glory to
[1:25:38] God. Because receiving the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:40] not based on sensation, speaking in
[1:25:42] tongues, or shouting.
[1:25:46] Everybody has their own experience when
[1:25:49] it comes to receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:25:51] because remember it's the word for your
[1:25:53] day.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; That's the evidence, the word for your
[1:25:56] day. Amen. You could make mistakes. You
[1:25:59] could do all kinds of things that has
[1:26:01] nothing to do with you receiving the
[1:26:04] word for your day.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Listen, we're going to
[1:26:07] move on here. Listen, the uh uh you
[1:26:09] know, it's as simple as receiving the
[1:26:12] the the word from a friend at work. Have
[1:26:16] you heard that God sent a prophet in the
[1:26:19] 20th century to restore the word because
[1:26:22] there was so much confusion? When I
[1:26:24] first heard that, you know, you know, my
[1:26:28] first experience was with him, the
[1:26:30] mighty God himself, because you know,
[1:26:32] everybody comes in a different way. It
[1:26:33] all depends where you're at your path of
[1:26:36] life. I was stuck in a drug addiction.
[1:26:39] So God needed to take that demon out of
[1:26:41] the way in order to get my attention to
[1:26:43] the word of God. That's what that's how
[1:26:45] God moves. He He can He can do it in any
[1:26:48] way he wants to do it.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Don't put any interpretation on the way
[1:26:52] God is going to birth an individual.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; The new birth can come in very simple
[1:26:57] ways. Amen. We've got a lot of young
[1:27:00] people that are born in this message,
[1:27:03] brought up under a a a family, a a
[1:27:06] father and a mother that's that that's
[1:27:08] believing this message. And those young
[1:27:10] people, they need the same experience,
[1:27:14] not in the way that you got it. You
[1:27:16] know, that's the problem. A lot of the
[1:27:17] times we want to see them have the same
[1:27:20] experience that we did when it comes to,
[1:27:22] you know, because we were we were lost
[1:27:25] in sin, committing all kinds of
[1:27:27] wickedness in the world and and cheating
[1:27:30] and lying and stealing and they and
[1:27:32] they've been living good lives, but they
[1:27:34] still haven't got the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; They need to understand what the Holy
[1:27:39] Ghost got to produce in their life.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's always back to the word. It
[1:27:45] always brings you back to the word as a
[1:27:47] genuine experience. Amen. So, you know,
[1:27:50] we could be uh you know, preaching this
[1:27:53] message, quoting brother Brandham over
[1:27:56] and over and over again, quoting
[1:27:58] scripture on top of scripture. If you
[1:28:01] have not received the message of your
[1:28:04] day by the opening of the word, which is
[1:28:08] the Holy Ghost in your day, you can
[1:28:11] listen to tapes all day long. You can
[1:28:14] come to church six days a week.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; It is not going to change you
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; until you come under this anointing of
[1:28:23] the Holy Ghost for this hour which
[1:28:26] produces a brand new birth and opens the
[1:28:29] word of God to you personally like like
[1:28:32] nobody else. Now you've got something
[1:28:35] that you can tell the people.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Now you've got a message that can change
[1:28:39] lives. Now you've got something inside
[1:28:41] of you that can strengthen your
[1:28:43] brethren. Amen. That can edify the body
[1:28:46] of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:48] Let's go to the next quote here. In the
[1:28:51] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:28:53] and the earthly bride. Wonderful
[1:28:55] message. Go back and listen to it.
[1:28:58] There's so much in there on the Holy
[1:29:00] Ghost. It's it's just tremendous. But he
[1:29:02] goes on here and he says, "Now the first
[1:29:03] step is repentance towards God." Now pay
[1:29:07] attention. And then follows after that
[1:29:09] is water baptism. Water baptism. Repent
[1:29:12] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:29:15] Christ. See, water baptism follows
[1:29:18] showing that repentance was genuine.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; So you young people, if you're going to
[1:29:25] come to the water,
[1:29:28] seek a genuine repentance before you
[1:29:33] come to that water. Amen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Make it up in your own mind. Decide
[1:29:39] right there and then. Now, this is part
[1:29:42] of overcoming. You see, people think
[1:29:43] that, oh, I can just go to the water.
[1:29:46] It doesn't it it's not just going to the
[1:29:49] water. It's going to the water with a
[1:29:51] genuine
[1:29:53] repentance. Because watch to remit your
[1:29:57] past sins. It has nothing to do with
[1:29:59] future sin. It only remits. Now, this is
[1:30:02] interesting. Repent and be baptized in
[1:30:04] the name of Jesus Christ. What for?
[1:30:06] Remission. Taking away of past sin has
[1:30:10] nothing to do with the future.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; You know what that says? It says that
[1:30:17] you can actually repent. You can get
[1:30:20] baptized. And when you do get baptized,
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; your your sin of the past wiped away.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; It's gone.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; You and and you know you know who it's
[1:30:30] gone to? Not to God.
[1:30:33] to you.
[1:30:35] You need to let go of your past. You
[1:30:38] need that that to to to be have those
[1:30:41] sins blotted out of your life
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; through the baptism, through a genuine
[1:30:46] repentance. But it still doesn't mean
[1:30:49] that you're going to go on and from that
[1:30:51] day on you're just going to be like an
[1:30:53] angel floating into church every Sunday,
[1:30:56] every Wednesday. You're going to be an
[1:30:58] angel at work. You're going to be such a
[1:31:00] a goodie tooth two shoes and everything
[1:31:02] else. Yeah, right. A lot of you right
[1:31:05] here today, right now, you made a lot of
[1:31:08] mistakes this week.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; And you know it. And you know you need
[1:31:12] the blood of Christ to cleanse it. Amen.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; But here now, by this by this
[1:31:18] understanding, you can you can just move
[1:31:20] up a little higher on the enemy. You can
[1:31:23] have just one one more revelation and
[1:31:26] understanding because watch he goes on.
[1:31:28] He says now takes away your past sin has
[1:31:30] nothing to do with the future. Just your
[1:31:32] sin has been chopped off. What you did,
[1:31:35] you can't repent for what Adam done. You
[1:31:37] never done it. Adam did. You just get
[1:31:40] forgiveness for what you done. The old
[1:31:43] nature is still there.
[1:31:48] You still got your old nature. You know,
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; you're going to fight
[1:31:54] the old nature and the new nature.
[1:31:58] inside of you is Jacob and Esau.
[1:32:02] You're going to struggle with that old
[1:32:04] nature until the rapture.
[1:32:07] You need to understand what the Holy
[1:32:10] Ghost can do for you in this hour.
[1:32:13] Because if you understand what he can do
[1:32:15] for you by the new birth, it just breaks
[1:32:18] the power of the enemy and all these
[1:32:20] things that try to affect your old
[1:32:22] nature,
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; that try to bring you down, put you into
[1:32:26] depression, knock you back down, tell
[1:32:28] you you're not a son of God, you're not
[1:32:30] a daughter of God. Listen, if you are a
[1:32:32] son or a daughter of God, let's just get
[1:32:34] it straight right now. You were always a
[1:32:36] son or a daughter of God.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; You were lost in an amnesia. You came
[1:32:42] into this dimension and you had to be
[1:32:44] born as a human being and you come
[1:32:47] through a spiritual amnesia forgetting
[1:32:49] who you were until this message of the
[1:32:52] hour comes to you
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden things start to
[1:32:56] open up and you start to see the word of
[1:32:58] God and you start to see things in the
[1:33:00] word like you never seen it before. You
[1:33:02] just can't understand why am I seeing
[1:33:04] this? Why is it so clear? because there
[1:33:06] was something already there
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; that could be awakened from before the
[1:33:12] foundations of the world and it's now
[1:33:14] coming into manifestation. Amen. We are
[1:33:17] we are seeing here that your sins if you
[1:33:21] come to the water you're washed you're
[1:33:23] cleansed your old life is dead and if
[1:33:28] you've truly genuinely repented and
[1:33:32] taken on the name of Jesus Christ which
[1:33:35] is his life the Holy Ghost seals you it
[1:33:39] comes the gift now comes to you remember
[1:33:42] it's a gift God gives it to you not
[1:33:45] because you deserve it. He already knows
[1:33:48] that you that that you're going to go
[1:33:49] out there and you're going to make
[1:33:50] mistakes again. Your old nature is going
[1:33:53] to win some of the battles. Amen. Praise
[1:33:56] God. But we need to understand how this
[1:33:59] whole experience and you know brother
[1:34:01] Brandham you know he drew a diagram one
[1:34:04] time when when he was talking about you
[1:34:05] know explaining on the Holy Ghost and he
[1:34:07] drew this diagram on on the wall and and
[1:34:11] he drew a heart and in and he drew two
[1:34:13] different hearts and one had a snake in
[1:34:15] it and the other one had a dove in it
[1:34:17] and and one the snake was the the old
[1:34:19] nature. Amen. That's why when when we
[1:34:22] read in Ezekiel chapter 36, I will put
[1:34:26] in you a brand new heart. I will put in
[1:34:29] you my spirit.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that he says, I'll give you a
[1:34:34] a heart of flesh. He will restore your
[1:34:37] heart. He will give you back to to the
[1:34:40] to the genuine uh uh anointing of the
[1:34:44] spirit of God, not that old nature that
[1:34:47] you were brought up under and all the
[1:34:49] influence of your, you know, your your
[1:34:51] your teachings, all your influence from
[1:34:54] generational spirits in your life, all
[1:34:57] the influences of your denominational
[1:34:59] teaching on the word of God, having no
[1:35:01] real clear understanding on what it is
[1:35:04] to be a Christian in this day and in
[1:35:06] this hour. And that snake has to be
[1:35:10] rooted out.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Has to be completely taken out. That
[1:35:15] nature slowly starts to die out. Amen.
[1:35:18] Praise God. And that's why the second
[1:35:22] that's why baptism in water, it just
[1:35:25] simplifies
[1:35:27] you being washed or sanctified. water
[1:35:30] being a separation
[1:35:32] so that you can be used
[1:35:35] for the purpose of God. And what is it
[1:35:38] that God is going to sanctify you from?
[1:35:41] Let's listen to the quote here. Let's go
[1:35:43] to the next quote.
[1:35:45] He goes on here. He says, "Then secondly
[1:35:48] comes sanctification
[1:35:51] which sets our minds in order for
[1:35:54] holiness." Now pay attention. Holiness,
[1:35:57] remember, holiness is not being holier
[1:35:59] than anybody else. Holiness is being
[1:36:04] called and separated for the purpose of
[1:36:06] God. Important to understand that to
[1:36:09] think right,
[1:36:11] to actually have a clear understanding
[1:36:14] what it is that God wants to do in our
[1:36:16] lives. Take away sanctification is a
[1:36:19] compound Greek word which means cleaned
[1:36:22] and set aside for service.
[1:36:25] Then the next comes the baptism of the
[1:36:28] fire and the Holy Ghost that God might
[1:36:30] dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses
[1:36:34] our hearts from sin
[1:36:37] and puts the Holy Ghost inside.
[1:36:41] Then we bring forth the same life that
[1:36:45] this did because that's in us.
[1:36:49] See, God is letting you know that the
[1:36:54] bornag again experience is his spirit
[1:36:57] coming into you and completely
[1:37:02] possessing
[1:37:04] and your purpose now of what you thought
[1:37:08] you were purposed to accomplish in this
[1:37:10] life. all your ideas of what it meant to
[1:37:14] be a Christian as a denominational
[1:37:17] Christian
[1:37:19] and you know you're living a
[1:37:21] hypocritical life. You know that you you
[1:37:24] go to church on Sunday but you're a
[1:37:25] different person on Monday.
[1:37:29] He says no I'm going to change that that
[1:37:31] that when when when the Holy Ghost when
[1:37:34] I come in there your desires are going
[1:37:37] to be completely changed. That's how
[1:37:39] you'll know that something really
[1:37:41] happened.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; All your desire will be different.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Your desire will no longer be for the
[1:37:48] for the things of the world. You'll
[1:37:50] you're it just it just you can't help
[1:37:53] it. There's a there's a new nature in
[1:37:54] you.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; The nature starts to take over. Now,
[1:37:58] it's a process.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; It's a process. It doesn't happen
[1:38:01] overnight. But we need to understand
[1:38:04] that that that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:06] supposed to produce in my life. And
[1:38:09] that's why we can check ourselves to see
[1:38:11] is this what I have yielded myself to.
[1:38:15] Have I surrendered to to my own desires?
[1:38:18] Am I putting them aside? Am I not
[1:38:20] allowing my desires to to override the
[1:38:24] purpose of God? Because he's sanctifying
[1:38:27] you for one purpose. and he's
[1:38:30] sanctifying you of the things that are
[1:38:33] getting in his way on what he wants to
[1:38:36] accomplish through the word in you.
[1:38:40] Those are the things he's getting rid of
[1:38:41] in your life. Not that when you receive
[1:38:44] the Holy Ghost, you got to go and
[1:38:45] separate yourself from all your friends
[1:38:47] and all your family and and and you you
[1:38:50] know, you can't even work at the place
[1:38:51] anymore because they swear too much and
[1:38:53] what? You're holier than thou.
[1:38:56] That's not the separation he's talking
[1:38:58] about.
[1:38:59] He's talking about a cleansing and a
[1:39:01] sanctification that that that replaces
[1:39:04] your desires.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; And now your communication with your
[1:39:08] friends at work, with your family, with
[1:39:10] your all your friends and and your and
[1:39:13] it it's it's around him. It's displaying
[1:39:16] the life of God now on display. It's not
[1:39:20] your own life. It's a new birth.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:39:27] Let's read on.
[1:39:29] But now it has to go through. Now here
[1:39:31] he's talking about, you know, I I kind
[1:39:34] of uh, you know, skipped where he's
[1:39:36] talking about the earth. Now he's saying
[1:39:38] that every baptism, every birth, every
[1:39:41] individual goes through this process,
[1:39:44] including the earth had to go through
[1:39:46] this process in order to prepare for
[1:39:49] what he's preparing us for. But now it
[1:39:52] has to go through a baptism of fire,
[1:39:55] holy fire from God, which cleanses the
[1:39:58] earth and the heavens around it. God,
[1:40:01] remember, God was coming down to the
[1:40:04] earth to fulfill the plan that he
[1:40:07] originally started in the Garden of
[1:40:09] Eden.
[1:40:11] Adam and Eve were in the image of God,
[1:40:14] having full dominion that what they said
[1:40:18] would go.
[1:40:20] God having full supreme authority on the
[1:40:24] earth. This is what we're coming back
[1:40:26] to. And he goes on here and he says,
[1:40:29] "Then he says, it's purchased so that
[1:40:32] the redeemed can live on it. Live in it
[1:40:36] in peace." Notice the baptism of fire is
[1:40:39] to cleanse it from sin, from sickness,
[1:40:43] from disease, germs, from sinners, from
[1:40:46] the devil and all of his group. He is to
[1:40:50] be cast out into the lake of fire.
[1:40:54] Holy fire from God comes down from God
[1:40:57] out of heaven and burns it up. Notice it
[1:41:01] makes it ready for God to dwell in.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; And this is exactly the process that he
[1:41:08] does for you. He sends the Holy Ghost
[1:41:12] and fire to come in to take possession
[1:41:16] to burn out all the unbelief which is
[1:41:19] all your teachings, all your
[1:41:21] understandings, all your traditions of
[1:41:23] what you thought the word was supposed
[1:41:25] to produce. And now you're producing and
[1:41:30] preparing so that he can dwell in. Let's
[1:41:33] read on. for God in the new world that
[1:41:37] is to come is to dwell in the earth.
[1:41:41] Because you say God, he dwells in human
[1:41:43] hearts.
[1:41:46] But he and the bride becomes one. You
[1:41:50] see this whole process of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:53] coming upon the church in this hour is
[1:41:56] to identify you as Eve, as him in bride
[1:42:02] form.
[1:42:04] That's that's why he goes on here. He
[1:42:06] says, I'll read it again. And God, he
[1:42:08] dwells in the human heart. But he and
[1:42:11] the bride becomes one and they go to
[1:42:13] their home in the new world. And the
[1:42:16] same plan of redemption is used to
[1:42:19] redeem both world and persons that live
[1:42:23] in it. That's what he's doing. See, God
[1:42:27] and man uniting.
[1:42:30] That's why Jesus came to the earth.
[1:42:33] See the heart has to be cleansed like
[1:42:36] that before God can come down in the
[1:42:39] person of the Holy Ghost. The person of
[1:42:43] the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming
[1:42:46] down and dwell in the human heart. It
[1:42:50] first must be repented. It must be
[1:42:53] baptized in water in his name to show
[1:42:57] who it who belongs who who it belongs
[1:43:01] to.
[1:43:03] That's why when you go and you take on
[1:43:05] the name of Christ, like a woman when
[1:43:07] she goes to the altar and she takes on
[1:43:10] her husband's name, it's identified that
[1:43:13] she belongs to him.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; And he belongs to her.
[1:43:18] She's taken on the one name which is the
[1:43:20] the name of Christ, which is the life of
[1:43:23] Christ, which is which is a brand new
[1:43:28] heaven and earth.
[1:43:32] Heaven, Christ, Earth, the bride
[1:43:35] becoming one.
[1:43:38] Praise God forever more.
[1:43:40] Let's go on. Acts 5:32.
[1:43:46] And we are his witnesses of these
[1:43:50] things. And notice what it says here.
[1:43:54] And so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God
[1:43:57] hath given to them that obey him.
[1:44:00] And what is it that we have come to
[1:44:02] obey? That we've come under the headship
[1:44:05] of the word for our day that we've
[1:44:09] repented from our old life, our own
[1:44:12] ideas, our own interpretation of the
[1:44:14] word of God. And we've taken on God's
[1:44:17] interpretation,
[1:44:19] God's desires, God's will for your life,
[1:44:23] God's purpose in calling you. When God
[1:44:27] when when God calls you, it's because he
[1:44:30] has a purpose for you. He has a desire
[1:44:33] to change you and place you into the
[1:44:37] body of Christ so that you can be put
[1:44:39] into service.
[1:44:42] Amen. Glory to God. Let's read on
[1:44:46] then. And from message desperations, he
[1:44:48] goes, "Then the life that was in Christ
[1:44:50] is the Holy Ghost." Not the third
[1:44:53] person, but the same person in the form
[1:44:56] of the Holy Spirit coming upon you as a
[1:45:00] token that your life and your fair is
[1:45:04] paid. You have been accepted.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the display of the token.
[1:45:10] People will know that you're not the
[1:45:12] same person that you were when you
[1:45:14] received the word for your day.
[1:45:18] You identify completely different. The
[1:45:21] reason why you're still in confusion and
[1:45:23] you don't fully understand is because
[1:45:25] you haven't found your true identity in
[1:45:28] this day and in this hour, what it is
[1:45:30] that you're supposed to produce. Amen.
[1:45:33] He says, now he says, now watch, he goes
[1:45:35] on and he says, until that token comes,
[1:45:39] you're not permitted on the highway.
[1:45:41] You're not permitted on the on the bus
[1:45:43] line. You're not permitted to go in
[1:45:45] until you can present this token, which
[1:45:48] is the Holy Ghost on display. And that
[1:45:51] token is your fair. And now it shows
[1:45:54] that the blood has been shed and has
[1:45:56] been applied to you. The price has been
[1:45:59] applied to you. And you have the token
[1:46:02] that the blood is applied to you and
[1:46:05] you're accepted. You get it now? Oh my.
[1:46:08] Now, now just not know certain evidence.
[1:46:12] See, don't be thinking that it's got to
[1:46:14] be an evidence. It's something. He says,
[1:46:16] you say, "Brother Brandom, I feel it in
[1:46:18] your minds." You see, with what? Why
[1:46:21] will Why will I know? He says, "Look
[1:46:24] what you what were you?" Pay attention
[1:46:28] here now. What were you and what are
[1:46:31] you? He's saying, "How you going to
[1:46:33] know? How you going to know that that
[1:46:36] the Holy Ghost has truly done something
[1:46:38] to change?" He says, "What were you and
[1:46:41] what are you now?" He goes, "And there
[1:46:44] there there is how you know." See what
[1:46:46] you were before this token was applied,
[1:46:49] what you are after it's applied, what
[1:46:52] was your desires before, and what is
[1:46:55] your desires after.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Then you know whether the token is
[1:46:59] applied or not. And these other things
[1:47:02] just automatically go with that.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; You listen, we we don't want to make
[1:47:09] this difficult, but it's as simple as
[1:47:11] that. You know, you you want you want to
[1:47:13] you know, you want to check to see where
[1:47:15] you're at. You know, have you actually
[1:47:17] really received the change? Well, you
[1:47:19] tell me what you were back then before
[1:47:21] and you tell me what you are today.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Are you one of these young people that
[1:47:25] goes to camp meetings every year and
[1:47:28] does a repeat every year of the same old
[1:47:30] thing and you haven't gone any further
[1:47:33] down the road with him? If you're still
[1:47:35] the person that you were a year ago
[1:47:37] today, there's something wrong. You need
[1:47:39] to go back and check to see if you've
[1:47:42] progressed in the word and the Holy
[1:47:44] Ghost is changing you,
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; changing your desires,
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; got you coming into the house of the
[1:47:51] Lord on a regular basis. Got you
[1:47:54] fellowshipping with other young people,
[1:47:56] looking for opportunity to share this
[1:47:59] word to with other young people when
[1:48:01] you're at school. It really shows if the
[1:48:04] zeal of God, if the fire of God is in
[1:48:06] you, it's going to be a token that's
[1:48:08] going to be on display.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be something that you
[1:48:11] you're going to hide it. You come here,
[1:48:14] you put your your skirts on when you
[1:48:15] come on Sunday, but you put your pants
[1:48:17] on when you go on Tuesday.
[1:48:20] You're not going to fool God.
[1:48:23] There's a genuine change. You were some
[1:48:26] you were a certain way, now you're
[1:48:28] changed. You're not the same way
[1:48:29] anymore. Praise God. And you need to
[1:48:32] obey that call on your life. If if it's
[1:48:34] truly there, then it's time to
[1:48:36] surrender. Then it's time to make the
[1:48:39] effort. You need to you need to
[1:48:41] overcome. The Bible says in the in this
[1:48:44] last age, to them that overcome will I
[1:48:48] grant to sit with me in the throne.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know that the bride is already
[1:48:53] seated with him in the throne?
[1:48:55] the ones that have overcome.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; She's been given the ability to loose
[1:49:02] and to bind.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; She's been given the power to speak the
[1:49:06] word of God. I'm not talking about
[1:49:09] arrogance here. I'm talking about an
[1:49:11] understanding on the word of God where
[1:49:14] you are, where God has placed you in the
[1:49:16] body of Christ. Do you know? Have you
[1:49:20] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:49:23] believed?
[1:49:24] Is there a genuine change? And is that
[1:49:27] change continuing in your life? Amen.
[1:49:30] Praise God. We need to understand that.
[1:49:33] Let's read the next scripture from Titus
[1:49:35] chapter 3:es
[1:49:37] 3:5. We're talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:49:39] producing a new birth. And when the new
[1:49:42] birth genuinely takes place, there's
[1:49:44] genuine change. In Titus 3:es 3-5, it
[1:49:49] says, "For we ourselves also were
[1:49:52] sometimes foolish, disobedient,
[1:49:55] deceived, serving diverse lusts and
[1:49:58] pleasures, living in malice and envy,
[1:50:01] hateful and hating one another." You
[1:50:03] know that there's people in this message
[1:50:05] that are still in this condition.
[1:50:08] Churches breaking up. People not
[1:50:11] associating with other churches.
[1:50:13] ministers not associating with other
[1:50:15] ministers because of because they they
[1:50:18] because of their own pride
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; because of their own pride their own you
[1:50:24] know listen if we if if I disagree with
[1:50:28] something with somebody else it's not my
[1:50:31] business unless God shows me to
[1:50:34] personally go to the individual and
[1:50:36] speak to that individual that pastor or
[1:50:38] that individual if God shows in in that
[1:50:41] in that way God has has a way of doing
[1:50:43] things. Otherwise, I don't need to I
[1:50:46] don't need to place any any kind of an
[1:50:48] interpretation on that person.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let God interpret it
[1:50:52] himself.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about what I
[1:50:56] preach from here. I I got to trust God
[1:50:59] in the gift that he's placed and the
[1:51:01] inspiration that he puts on me that he's
[1:51:03] going to meet your needs.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; That's that's all that that's all that's
[1:51:07] on my heart. If there's anything, God
[1:51:09] knows that my heart is sincere. When I
[1:51:12] say, "Lord, I I I I don't know what to
[1:51:14] bring to the people. But if you will
[1:51:16] come and you will meet their needs,
[1:51:18] that's that that that's all I can that's
[1:51:20] all I can ask for."
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Open my understanding. Give me the
[1:51:24] revelation that I need that your people
[1:51:26] need.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm responsible for. I'm
[1:51:30] not responsible to go and correct other
[1:51:32] pastors. The word will correct them.
[1:51:36] They will hear the word just like you
[1:51:38] hear the word. And the faith cometh by
[1:51:40] what? Hearing the word. And whatever God
[1:51:43] is doing in this hour and how he's
[1:51:46] dealing with, you know, with
[1:51:47] individuals, that's God's business.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; It's not our business. But people are
[1:51:54] still in this condition. It goes to show
[1:51:57] that there's no real change yet that's
[1:52:00] taken place
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; because what? But after that, the
[1:52:04] kindness and love of God our savior
[1:52:06] towards man appeared.
[1:52:10] And that's the Holy Ghost, the message
[1:52:12] of the hour.
[1:52:15] Not by works of righteousness.
[1:52:18] It's not what you did. Remember this
[1:52:19] gift of the Holy Ghost. It's not because
[1:52:22] you deserve it. It's not because you you
[1:52:24] did anything for it. It's don't put your
[1:52:27] works on it. You know, that's what the
[1:52:28] Catholics do. Oh, if I go to church and
[1:52:30] I light so many candles and I say so
[1:52:32] many Hail Marys and I do so many That's
[1:52:35] total deception.
[1:52:38] They're actually putting their faith in
[1:52:40] works. And there it says real clear
[1:52:43] here, not by works of righteousness
[1:52:46] which we have done, but according to his
[1:52:49] mercy, he saved us by the washing of
[1:52:53] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[1:52:57] Ghost. What is that? by a new birth.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Regeneration is your mind taking on the
[1:53:04] mind of Christ.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Your desires taking on his desires,
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; his purpose, his will in your life.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; A true genuine birth.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Go to the next slide here. I read this
[1:53:21] last week. He says, "You that wants the
[1:53:24] Holy Spirit, you that wants that
[1:53:26] experience, not an emotional excitement,
[1:53:29] I'm not here to try and emotionally get
[1:53:31] you uh excited. I'm not here to try and
[1:53:34] and and and convince you and scare you.
[1:53:38] This is not about scaring our young
[1:53:40] people. You better get the Holy Ghost."
[1:53:42] You can't get it unless he's going to
[1:53:44] give it to you. But you need to
[1:53:46] understand what it is so that you can so
[1:53:48] that you're not in a confused state of
[1:53:50] mind on what the Holy Ghost actually is
[1:53:53] and what he wants to produce in your
[1:53:56] life.
[1:53:57] You can live an absolutely normal young
[1:54:00] beautiful life as a young person and
[1:54:03] enjoy this world and enjoy marriage and
[1:54:06] enjoy relationships
[1:54:08] in the Holy Ghost. when you come to
[1:54:11] understand that that's what he desires
[1:54:13] for you. Amen. But it comes by a new
[1:54:17] birth.
[1:54:19] We need to understand that there's a new
[1:54:21] birth. He says not an emotional
[1:54:22] excitement. You want the Holy Ghost, the
[1:54:25] life, the germ of life inside you. And
[1:54:29] you want to get rid of that amnesia
[1:54:31] that's making you that you can't
[1:54:34] identify yourself. You see, the moment
[1:54:37] you receive the Holy Ghost, it
[1:54:39] identifies you where you're supposed to
[1:54:41] be, why you're in this church, why you
[1:54:45] believe God sent a prophet, why you
[1:54:47] believe in the opening of the seven
[1:54:49] seals, why you understand that you got
[1:54:51] to take the book and eat the book and
[1:54:54] and and that that and that you and that
[1:54:56] you've actually been given the
[1:54:57] commission to to prophesy. Prophesy
[1:55:00] what? The word.
[1:55:03] He's told you to eat the word. Take the
[1:55:07] word. Understand the word. Receive him.
[1:55:11] He says, "You can't identify yourself.
[1:55:14] You don't know where you stand. You
[1:55:15] don't know what you are. Let's get rid
[1:55:18] of it right now." Hallelujah. There is a
[1:55:22] new birth here for you. A real genuine
[1:55:26] new birth.
[1:55:30] That's what God is telling us today.
[1:55:35] Amen.
[1:55:37] Let's let's finish up here. Couple of
[1:55:39] more quotes. Amen. Listen, I I take a
[1:55:43] lot of quotes from the prophet because
[1:55:46] he was the messenger for our day that
[1:55:49] restored the truth of the word of God
[1:55:52] back into our hearts.
[1:55:55] That's why we quote him.
[1:55:57] We don't quote him because he's the
[1:56:02] absolute.
[1:56:03] No, no. William Brham is not the
[1:56:05] absolute. William Branham was the
[1:56:07] prophet of Malachi 4:5, the messenger of
[1:56:10] Revelations 101:7.
[1:56:13] Amen. He was the messenger that was on
[1:56:16] the earth when the mighty angel came
[1:56:17] down in 1963 to open to to bring to us
[1:56:21] the open book so that we could receive
[1:56:23] our new birth. That's where you receive
[1:56:26] the new birth. Amen. We're going to
[1:57:28] Amen. This is what caught my attention.
[1:57:32] The Holy Ghost is the word of God in you
[1:57:36] that identifies itself by accepting that
[1:57:40] word.
[1:57:42] I'm going to read it again.
[1:57:44] Remember, it's recognizing your word.
[1:57:47] the day that you're living in. The Holy
[1:57:50] Ghost is the word of God in you that
[1:57:53] identifies itself by accepting that
[1:57:56] word. Outside of that, it can't be the
[1:57:59] Holy Ghost.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. People come to
[1:58:04] you and say, "You can be baptized in the
[1:58:06] name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[1:58:07] You can be baptiz then then you can be
[1:58:09] baptized in the in the in the name of
[1:58:11] the Rosa Sharon because that he's also
[1:58:14] known as the Rosa Sharon. He's known as
[1:58:16] the lily of the valley. But the book of
[1:58:19] Acts shows 8,000 baptisms and every
[1:58:22] single one of them in the name of the
[1:58:23] Lord Jesus Christ. You can't show me one
[1:58:26] baptism any other way in the scripture.
[1:58:30] And if the Holy Ghost is in you, and he
[1:58:32] says, I'll send you the comforter, which
[1:58:34] is the Holy Ghost, and he will guide you
[1:58:36] into all truth. And you're going to tell
[1:58:39] me that the Holy Ghost is going to go
[1:58:40] against his own word.
[1:58:43] Can't do it. If it's not, if it's
[1:58:46] listen, cannot be the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:48] That's the evidence whether you believe
[1:58:49] or not if the word in you responds to
[1:58:53] the word.
[1:58:55] Amen. Next slide. I heard brother
[1:58:57] Neville say uh this morning someone
[1:59:00] might have been asking him, "Why don't I
[1:59:02] preach on the Holy Ghost?" They were,
[1:59:05] you know, somebody had asked brother
[1:59:06] Neville, "Why isn't brother Brandon
[1:59:08] preaching on the Holy Ghost?" He goes,
[1:59:10] "Why didn't I do this?" Here it is. The
[1:59:12] Holy Ghost is in the action is in the
[1:59:15] action in you.
[1:59:18] That's what the Holy Ghost is. When you
[1:59:20] see your life being transformed. Amen.
[1:59:23] It's the action that's that that that's
[1:59:25] in you. Amen. And it's it's a life, not
[1:59:29] an emotion, not some sort of fleshly
[1:59:31] evidence, but it is a person. Jesus
[1:59:35] Christ, the word of God established in
[1:59:38] your heart to quicken every word of this
[1:59:42] age.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat that, right? He says
[1:59:47] it. But it is the person Jesus Christ,
[1:59:49] the word of God established in your
[1:59:52] heart to quicken every word of this age.
[1:59:56] In other words, your life will display
[1:59:59] the message of the hour. You can't you
[2:00:02] can't deny God sent a prophet because
[2:00:05] the Holy Ghost can never deny his own
[2:00:07] word. You can't deny that the seals were
[2:00:10] open in 1963.
[2:00:12] You can't deny that that God has has
[2:00:16] given us the open book. Amen. And given
[2:00:19] us an understanding that we're to take
[2:00:21] the book which is the word for this day
[2:00:24] and this hour. Amen. People are afraid
[2:00:27] of the book of Revelation. But we're not
[2:00:28] afraid of it because the revelation, the
[2:00:32] book of Revelation is the revelation of
[2:00:34] Jesus Christ. And you are the revelation
[2:00:37] of Jesus Christ when you receive the
[2:00:39] word in your day and you display it to
[2:00:42] the people in the 20 in 2025.
[2:00:46] Hallelujah. Praise God forever more.
[2:00:48] Amen. Let's read on.
[2:00:51] He says in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 11-16
[2:00:55] he says for what man knoweth the things
[2:00:58] of a man save the spirit of a man which
[2:01:01] is in him. Even so this is how we
[2:01:04] understand the Holy Ghost. Even so the
[2:01:07] things of God knoweth no man but the
[2:01:10] spirit of God. Now we have received not
[2:01:14] the spirit of the world, but the spirit
[2:01:17] which is of God, that we might know the
[2:01:21] things that are freely given to us of
[2:01:24] God, which things also we speak, not in
[2:01:29] words which man's wisdom teaches. Okay?
[2:01:32] We're not interested in man's wisdom and
[2:01:34] teachings and everything. That's what
[2:01:36] we've been saying here. But we're
[2:01:38] interested. He says, "But which the Holy
[2:01:40] Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual
[2:01:43] things with spiritual, but the natural
[2:01:47] man receiveth not the things of the
[2:01:49] Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[2:01:52] unto him, neither can he know them,
[2:01:55] because they are spiritually discerned.
[2:01:59] For he that is spiritual judgeth all
[2:02:01] things, yet he himself is judged of no
[2:02:05] man. For who hath known the mind of the
[2:02:08] Lord, that he may instruct him? But we
[2:02:12] have the mind of Christ. What is the
[2:02:15] mind of Christ? The Holy Ghost. What is
[2:02:17] the Holy Ghost? The word for your day.
[2:02:20] What is the word for your day going to
[2:02:22] do? What God wants purposed in your
[2:02:25] life. What God has purposed for this
[2:02:27] church, for the mystical body of Jesus
[2:02:30] Christ. He's never going to alter his
[2:02:32] desire for yours.
[2:02:35] So your desires must change. They must
[2:02:38] be for the word of God. Amen. And we're
[2:02:41] going to close on this uh last quote
[2:02:43] here from Sriian Church age. He says,
[2:02:46] "Now before I close this subject, now we
[2:02:49] need to understand about
[2:02:51] predestination."
[2:02:53] Okay? Because a lot of people say, "Oh,
[2:02:55] so what you're saying is that you're
[2:02:56] just, you know, God just chose you and
[2:02:59] and uh you know, uh God didn't choose
[2:03:01] him." No, that's not what it meant.
[2:03:03] predestination by fornowledge. God saw
[2:03:06] where his word would would end up. God
[2:03:10] saw where his seed, you know about the
[2:03:12] parable of the seed and some seed fell
[2:03:14] on good ground. And God by the grace of
[2:03:17] God seed fell into some good ground here
[2:03:20] this morning because you can recognize
[2:03:22] you wouldn't be able to see this unless
[2:03:24] the seed was in you. You wouldn't
[2:03:26] understand what I'm preaching this
[2:03:27] morning unless there was a deep inside
[2:03:30] of you already able to respond the the
[2:03:33] Holy Ghost in you responding to the word
[2:03:35] of God. Amen. He says, he says, "Now, I
[2:03:38] know there's a question in your minds.
[2:03:40] You will want to know if I believe in
[2:03:42] the doctrine of pre-existence. I don't
[2:03:44] believe in that Mormon doctrine of
[2:03:46] pre-existence of souls any more than I
[2:03:48] believe in reincarnation or the
[2:03:50] transmigration of souls." Be careful
[2:03:53] here and see this. It is not the person
[2:03:56] that comes predestinated eternally from
[2:03:59] God. It is the word
[2:04:03] not the person.
[2:04:05] So don't look at people.
[2:04:08] Understand that in the mind of God
[2:04:10] before the foundations of the world you
[2:04:13] were a thought.
[2:04:15] You were a thought and a thought when it
[2:04:17] is expressed it becomes the word. It
[2:04:20] becomes word expressed in that
[2:04:22] particular age. And that's what God was
[2:04:25] doing all the way from Genesis to
[2:04:27] Revelation. He was manifesting himself
[2:04:30] in different manifestations of the Holy
[2:04:33] Spirit in the Old Testament and now in
[2:04:35] the hol as the Holy Ghost in the New
[2:04:37] Testament.
[2:04:38] Amen. Interpreting himself. So it's not
[2:04:42] the seed, it's not the individual, it's
[2:04:44] not the person, it's the word that you
[2:04:48] had representation from before the
[2:04:50] foundations of the world. Pay attention.
[2:04:54] That is it. Way back there, too far back
[2:04:57] for the human mind to grasp. The eternal
[2:05:00] God with eternal thoughts thought and
[2:05:03] decreed, Jacob have I loved, but Esau
[2:05:06] have I hated
[2:05:08] in Romans 9:13. And neither was born,
[2:05:11] they weren't even born yet. And God
[2:05:12] turns around and says, I hate Esau and I
[2:05:15] love Jacob. Why? because he knew the
[2:05:18] word that was in him was was represented
[2:05:22] and identified as Jacob not Esau.
[2:05:26] Hallelujah.
[2:05:28] And so here now see it was the thought
[2:05:31] and then that thought became expressed
[2:05:34] and God brought back Jacob because Jacob
[2:05:37] alone was seed.
[2:05:44] Jacob alone. Next slide. Jacob alone had
[2:05:47] the seed. Let the musicians come. That
[2:05:50] is why he had respect to the birthright
[2:05:53] and covenant of God. There's something
[2:05:56] in you that when you hear this word,
[2:06:00] you're not going to just walk out of the
[2:06:01] church and forget about it.
[2:06:04] Something will awaken inside of you and
[2:06:07] will want the right birth. And that's
[2:06:11] what Jacob desired. That's what was in
[2:06:13] Jacob. Amen. If you are true seed, you
[2:06:16] will hear that word. The spirit will
[2:06:18] baptize you into the body of Christ,
[2:06:21] filling you and empowering you, and you
[2:06:24] will receive the word for your day and
[2:06:28] age. Did you hear that?
[2:06:31] You will receive the word for your day
[2:06:34] and your age. Hallelujah. See how clear
[2:06:37] the true evidence becomes when the word
[2:06:40] is revealed to you. Again, note Jesus
[2:06:43] was the royal seed. He lived in a human
[2:06:46] body. When the spirit called to him, the
[2:06:48] word manifested thought. He went to
[2:06:52] Jordan and was there baptized in water,
[2:06:55] obeying the word. The Holy Spirit came
[2:06:58] upon him. And the voice said, "This is
[2:07:01] my beloved son. Hear ye him." The voice
[2:07:04] did not say, "This has become my son."
[2:07:08] Glory. Hallelujah. When God says, "You
[2:07:11] are my son. You are my daughter." You
[2:07:13] don't just become a son or a daughter of
[2:07:15] God. You were always a son or daughter
[2:07:17] of God, but you were under amnesia. You
[2:07:20] didn't know it. You were lost in sin.
[2:07:22] You were lost under tradition. You were
[2:07:24] lost in the teachings of man. But now
[2:07:26] God has given you the word to awaken you
[2:07:28] to the message of this hour.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; That he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:07:33] forever. Amen. Then having been filled
[2:07:35] thus and the same pattern holds at
[2:07:39] Pentecost and ever after he went in
[2:07:42] demonstrated power receiving the full
[2:07:46] revelation of God and from God for that
[2:07:50] day. Now, we have been constantly saying
[2:07:54] that the true evidence of being baptized
[2:07:57] with the Holy Ghost is for the believer
[2:08:00] to receive the word for the age in which
[2:08:06] he lives.
[2:08:09] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:08:12] I've received I've received a message.
[2:08:15] Glory to God. We've received a word in
[2:08:18] this day that that that can change your
[2:08:20] life. You don't need to remain the same
[2:08:23] way. You can leave here today, this
[2:08:26] Sunday. You can leave and you can start
[2:08:28] a fresh. You can understand now why why
[2:08:31] he wants to take control. Why he wants
[2:08:34] to purge you. He wants to sanctify you.
[2:08:36] What he's sanctifying you from. He's
[2:08:38] sanctifying you from the things that are
[2:08:40] that are distracting you from his will
[2:08:42] and his purpose for your life. Amen.
[2:08:46] Glory to God.
[2:08:48] Hallelujah.
[2:08:50] I'm ready to move on up to another
[2:08:51] dimension right now. Glory to God. Amen.
[2:08:56] I'm ready to receive the the Holy Ghost
[2:08:59] power that's going to translate. Listen,
[2:09:01] if the same spirit that raised Christ
[2:09:04] from the dead dwell in you, it's going
[2:09:06] to quicken you.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; It's going to translate you. It's going
[2:09:11] to move you. I'm ready to move. I move
[2:09:14] on up to another dimension.
[2:09:18] I'm ready to change. Relocate to another
[2:09:21] location.

[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; See, that's the Holy Ghost's power and
[2:11:45] purpose that you know, a couple months
[2:11:48] ago, the enemy wanted to take him down.
[2:11:50] Amen. But God's power in the Holy Ghost
[2:11:54] has a purpose and a plan, and it will
[2:11:57] override sickness. It'll override
[2:11:59] whatever the enemy throws at us. We will
