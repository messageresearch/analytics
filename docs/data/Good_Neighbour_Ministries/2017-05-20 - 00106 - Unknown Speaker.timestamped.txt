[0:01] because it's not going to solve the
[0:02] problem. It's the height of stupidity
[0:04] when they do that. That's right. And
[0:06] they stand before the neighbor to answer
[0:08] because that's not how God brings
[0:11] deliverance. The scripture that says God
[0:13] so loved the world, he looked at the
[0:14] stinky world. He looked at a crooked
[0:17] world. He looked at a world filled with
[0:20] disease, filled with despair. He looked
[0:23] at a world filled with
[0:25] deception, and he loved it. Can you can
[0:29] you distinctly
[0:31] deliberately condition your mind when
[0:33] you leave the space to start looking at
[0:36] people
[0:39] nice color
[0:44] hair? Oh, I love that that breeze. How
[0:48] those girls that African woman look she
[0:50] said you're so beautiful, strong. And
[0:53] you know what? when she walks up here at
[0:56] some point maybe said gosh man I wish I
[0:59] had here
[1:03] sisters I wish I had here these sisters
[1:06] because you know what when I get my hair
[1:08] fixed I'm going to scream out and stuff
[1:09] to hold it
[1:12] tight because the moment I go out in the
[1:15] whip what
[1:18] happened but the sister she goes up
[1:20] there and she just go as she in the whip
[1:24] And it's just the same way. When there's
[1:25] not, everything has done its purpose
[1:30] and
[1:32] it's there's a time that people detested
[1:35] dark skin still. A lot of people lying
[1:37] on the beach right
[1:45] now. Right now the best skin is halfway.
[1:51] Burn it up. Burn the saloon. Get burned
[1:53] up. Bring yourself that way. And then
[1:56] next thing you know, you saw a sister
[1:57] coming in and then all of a sudden you
[1:59] see something
[2:00] strange. Look at some of the stars and
[2:03] all of a sudden they go to get some
[2:05] shaking their lips so they should be
[2:07] like mine.
[2:16] You know how silly we've been through
[2:17] world history and then it changes
[2:21] around let's stop and say thank you Lord
[2:24] for
[2:26] [Applause]
[2:33] who hallelujah the word but he gave his
[2:36] opening go and make a gift now is a
[2:39] problem I have conservative Christians
[2:42] in America
[2:44] not have it I don't know about the
[2:46] behavior of Catholic.
[2:52] They have this
[2:55] passion for righteousness. They say and
[2:59] Lord is like put that in. They
[3:02] say they have a passion for
[3:05] righteousness. And so the whole theme in
[3:09] America is they have selected some bad
[3:13] behavior,
[3:17] homosexuality, abortion,
[3:21] and they selected some bad behavior.
[3:24] In their mind, they feel they're about
[3:27] to do something about it.
[3:29] And the way they're going to do
[3:31] something about it, we can put some laws
[3:34] in these people. We're going to do this.
[3:37] All hatred and and people are marching
[3:40] and chanting and hatred and crying and
[3:42] suffering and and angst and attitude and
[3:45] the conservative church of our Lord and
[3:48] Savior Jesus Christ.
[3:50] Now the whole mission is to attack bad
[3:55] people. That is what we know. Stop and
[3:58] think what is going on there. They are
[4:00] attacking people that in their minds are
[4:03] bad.
[4:04] They are attacking them. It used to be
[4:07] the world used to persecute the church,
[4:10] but my wife told me one day, she said,
[4:12] you know, look like the church is
[4:13] persecuting the world.
[4:17] They are persecuting and they're
[4:18] attacking people in the
[4:23] world. Listen how deceived and deluded
[4:27] that is. I don't care how. I don't care.
[4:32] But regardless of how wrong people are,
[4:36] how sinful they are,
[4:38] uh how degraded they are, Jesus never
[4:42] approached
[4:44] them with hate and judgment and
[4:48] condemnation. Amen. The scripture just
[4:50] read there, it says he came not into the
[4:53] world to condemn the world, but to
[4:56] save. So he saw people, it doesn't
[4:59] matter what intervention, as an
[5:01] opportunity to give them love and to
[5:05] give them redemption perhaps because all
[5:08] men will not receive. But it doesn't
[5:11] matter. He will make sure everyone has
[5:14] received the gift of love and kindness
[5:17] and an extended arm. Come unto me all
[5:20] you who labor and they're pimilated and
[5:22] hanging in your wrist.
[5:24] The conservative church is not behaving
[5:26] like Jesus. They just got to stop and
[5:29] think because Jesus said, "I came not
[5:32] into the world to condemn the world. I
[5:34] came to save him." It's a seeking to
[5:36] save it. And who do you seek and save?
[5:38] People are lost. People are in trouble.
[5:42] And you're not going to save people by
[5:44] watching them in the morning and say,
[5:45] "You stinking rat. Look at you. You're
[5:46] dirty as dog. You look at you. Yeah.
[5:48] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at your
[5:50] hand. Save the person if you want to
[5:52] save that person. Oh my god. Come
[5:54] quickly. The person is in the
[5:57] m compassion. Pull the person up. Get
[6:00] some water. Wash them up. That's how you
[6:02] rescue.
[6:05] You know how serious it is. Many times I
[6:07] see some guys over the
[6:08] mountains mountains in the snow and then
[6:11] they get stuck in the mountain rest of a
[6:15] million dollars for this joker up there
[6:18] just because he can go up in the
[6:19] mountain.
[6:21] He's up there and get stuck in a
[6:22] mountain. They do over every year it's
[6:24] happening. Somebody get stuck in a
[6:26] mountain somewhere. A helicopter's got
[6:28] to go. Millions of dollars are spent to
[6:31] get them out.
[6:33] But what happens when that guy acts so
[6:35] silly that cause that? I think it's
[6:37] silly.
[6:39] But help yourself. I can't judge them if
[6:43] they get energy and follow the light
[6:45] that I have no condemnation with them.
[6:48] But I'm looking into say you know what
[6:49] happened when a guy goes up there and
[6:51] gets into trouble that stuff or two to
[6:54] get him off that
[6:55] ledge. People are
[6:57] endangered. Rescue squads are in danger.
[7:00] But they do it joyfully. They do it
[7:04] heroically. They feel their heroes. We
[7:06] going to rescue. We res the heroes.
[7:10] Somebody did something they shouldn't
[7:12] get back. And they bring them out.
[7:14] Everybody's cheering on the news.
[7:17] Brought him
[7:19] down. What about others who stuck not on
[7:22] a mountain ledge, but they're stuck in
[7:26] the ghetto. They're stuck in sin
[7:29] somewhere. They're stuck in the dirt
[7:32] somewhere. They're stuck in all kind of
[7:33] bad behavior. Where are the heroes that
[7:36] could behave like Jesus when Jesus said,
[7:38] "I came to see to save them. I'm going
[7:41] after them. I want to get them." And the
[7:44] way he went after the sinner was, he
[7:47] bled to death for them. Right now, we
[7:49] want to kill those sinners.
[7:53] Conservative churches want to harm
[7:55] people that haven't lived up to the
[7:57] standard. You know, Dr. God looked down
[8:00] at earth and he gave Jesus, he saw
[8:02] nobody that believed him up to the
[8:04] standard. All sin will come short of the
[8:07] glory of God.
[8:09] Everybody was sinful. Everybody was born
[8:12] in sin and shaped in iniquity.
[8:15] And I want you to listen carefully to
[8:16] this what I'm saying. I repeat this
[8:19] everywhere I go.
[8:21] this miracle, this wonder, this majesty
[8:25] that causes you to say, "I'm saved. I'm
[8:28] redeemed." This is how it happened.
[8:32] Jesus said, "You saw me. You're a liar.
[8:35] You're a thief. You're a fornicator.
[8:37] You're an adulterer.
[8:40] You're full of anger. You cheat people.
[8:42] You hurt people.
[8:44] You beat up your wife.
[8:47] You hurt your kids. You're despicable in
[8:50] the job. You don't know what you're
[8:52] supposed to do to get paid, but you
[8:54] don't do what you're prepared to do.
[8:57] You're cheating people. God looked, he
[9:00] saw the whole thing. He saw
[9:01] homosexuality. He saw adultery. He saw
[9:03] fornication. He saw everything. It's
[9:06] when he saw all that, he says, "I love
[9:10] the world, and I'm going to do something
[9:12] about it." Glor.
[9:18] love that God has made had and has made
[9:22] him give something for their help and
[9:24] their redemption.
[9:27] People are suffering in America, they
[9:28] want to take away the healthcare because
[9:29] they want to play a game and do money
[9:31] games to it because somebody will get
[9:34] more if the health care is positioned
[9:36] this way. They get more money out of it
[9:38] and then somebody's mad with someone
[9:40] else is getting a deep cut in this and
[9:42] so they'll say with healthcare in
[9:43] America, oh we got a fortune, we got a
[9:45] fortune. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. If my wife
[9:47] is dying, do you think any amount of
[9:49] money is a question? That's the mind
[9:52] that I have. If I have a child, if I
[9:55] have a wife, if I have mother and
[9:57] somebody and they're in desperate
[9:58] strength and they're about to die and I
[10:01] get $10
[10:02] million, I go to see the baby. I said,
[10:06] "No, no, baby. We got 10
[10:09] million if we really try get you to the
[10:13] doctor and catch your monster."
[10:18] Is that how you think? Is that what
[10:21] people are thinking about? Oh, don't say
[10:24] they're thinking in that way because you
[10:25] know what? They're never thinking about
[10:26] themselves. Sometime
[10:28] well, but they're talking about what
[10:30] other people do. Don't get taken away
[10:32] from them, right? Some of them don't
[10:35] deserve because they're lazy. When Jesus
[10:37] came to say, he never even said whether
[10:39] they're lazy or not.
[10:42] Jesus came and he reached out to the
[10:44] lazy and the liars and the thieves and
[10:46] the fornicator and the trumpets
[10:48] everything. He saw all of
[10:51] us and they're on the cross. Father,
[10:55] forgive them and know what they do.
[10:59] Look, this is the hardest part of this
[11:03] statistically right now somebody people
[11:07] all over the world are having sex right
[11:09] now.
[11:11] They're fornicating right now. They
[11:13] committed adultery right this moment.
[11:16] Homosexual acts are being performed
[11:17] right now somewhere in the
[11:20] earth. Sometimes some places the earth
[11:22] is not and some are creeping in places
[11:25] with prostitutes and they're doing all
[11:27] of those things. Whatever they're going
[11:28] to do, somebody's being killed for
[11:32] $20.
[11:33] Somebody It was like
[11:36] that when God so loved the world. It was
[11:39] like that when Jesus died for
[11:43] them while we are yet in
[11:47] sin. What happened?
[11:52] Could you think carefully?
[11:55] This brain of Christianity that have
[11:58] this posture that this person is a
[12:00] fornicate, this person is a thief and so
[12:02] forth and I'm going to try to hurt them.
[12:04] You know what I see as that spirit is
[12:08] from the devil. Let me tell you why. It
[12:11] it enates those type of people and they
[12:13] hate the church. And that's exactly the
[12:15] effect that spirit want. It wants that
[12:18] those type of people whoever they may be
[12:20] whatever sins they are to hate the
[12:22] church. I don't want to hear nothing the
[12:24] church has to say. And the devil is
[12:25] laughing because why
[12:28] ugly things Christians will say about
[12:30] those type of people and bapt I don't
[12:32] want to go to that church. All anything
[12:35] Christians is hurtful. That's the
[12:39] effect. But Jesus on the opposite side,
[12:41] he said, "Come unto me all you who labor
[12:45] under heaven. Come fornicators. Come
[12:47] adulterers. Come homosexuals. Come
[12:49] drunkers. Come liars. Come. Just come.
[12:52] My arms are open to you. I'm not
[12:54] standing up looking
[13:00] like disgusting slime.
[13:05] That's the energy coming out of too much
[13:08] of the church and God is speaking
[13:10] singing to me. I weep many times and I'm
[13:14] baffled. I'm saying God, how could they
[13:16] behave this way? The wrath of man does
[13:19] not work the righteousness of God.
[13:22] That's right. Your wrath and your anger
[13:25] is not going to bring salvation. Amen.
[13:28] Salvation only comes by an act of
[13:30] redemptive love and it comes from the
[13:32] one who has this unconditional
[13:35] lovability. That's right. He loved us
[13:38] unconditionally. So when Jesus was dying
[13:41] on the cross, he who he dying who was he
[13:44] dying for
[13:46] the sins of the world. He was dying for
[13:48] everybody. That's right. And that
[13:50] everybody there was somebody that he was
[13:52] dying for that was committing a a
[13:54] fornication act, an adultery act, was
[13:56] committing a homosexual act. That
[13:58] somebody is lay waiting and calling
[13:59] somebody running away with their money
[14:01] and he is dying to that very
[14:05] person. We as believers have got to get
[14:09] back to the call of the
[14:11] master. Listen to him. We listen too
[14:14] often to denominations and organizations
[14:17] and they have their own polities and
[14:19] policies and we begin to let the voice
[14:22] of Jesus stay
[14:23] away. Jesus said follow
[14:26] me. The voice of heaven said this is my
[14:28] beloved son here. Listen to what I say.
[14:31] But people had listened to every voice.
[14:33] They listened to every argument here
[14:35] argument there on the internet and the
[14:37] television and everybody spewing hate
[14:39] spewing chopping people down. They
[14:41] graing people. Yet still when Jesus came
[14:43] all he did was love.
[14:46] [Music]
[14:47] So what could they be bad behavior? It's
[14:49] none of your business. Your business is
[14:51] your bad behavior. That's the that's the
[14:53] concern. The most eager the most
[14:57] important concern is how are you? What
[15:00] is your behavior? Are we going to behave
[15:02] like Jesus did? That's what we got to
[15:05] strike for. And when we see Jesus, we
[15:07] saw the woman taken in the very act of
[15:12] And the holy ones rushed and they poked
[15:15] the love and said this man behaving
[15:18] weird. Where was the man? They weren't
[15:20] even judging
[15:24] right
[15:26] away. I don't know what happened. But
[15:28] only the woman there. And then Bible
[15:32] shows this. Jesus said if you have no
[15:36] s they couldn't do it. Now there was one
[15:39] there who had no sin. Jesus. He said if
[15:43] they want to do this throwing stone
[15:45] stone be
[15:47] sinless and they walk away they have
[15:50] hidden stuff. But here is Jesus. He had
[15:52] no sin and still the sinless one showed
[15:56] us what to
[15:58] do. Forgiven
[16:05] you could do better.
[16:08] Jesus, get away from them. Get away from
[16:11] these righteous people. They want to
[16:12] kill you because God caught you. Look,
[16:14] this thing is so bad. This spirit that
[16:16] has brought this mindset is so bad that
[16:19] in churches people look at someone and
[16:26] said and some of you been in company you
[16:29] heard that
[16:32] stuff I hope
[16:37] I'm just using the
[16:43] name brother
[16:49] And then before we know it, it begin to
[16:51] walk. And then sister begin to be
[16:56] shocked. Jack, sister, push it
[17:00] away. How did you talk to your
[17:04] husband? Push it
[17:07] away.
[17:09] Sh. And look what that
[17:13] means. They don't know anything. They're
[17:16] suspecting and they want to harm you.
[17:19] This is how bad it is. Jesus was brought
[17:21] a woman taken in the very act. It can't
[17:23] get any worse than that. She was
[17:26] not. She was caught in the very act. And
[17:29] Jesus
[17:30] is extricating her loosing over the
[17:33] stone. He's telling them you want the
[17:35] stone. You got to know what you're
[17:36] doing. Put them at the spot. They look
[17:39] at her, "Go you where you
[17:41] s of trouble." Love covers a multitude
[17:45] of sins. So when you're operating in
[17:47] love, you're not a peep and destroy
[17:50] person. You hear what I'm saying? You're
[17:52] not a peep and destroy. You're not
[17:53] peeping at people peeping in the line.
[17:55] You want to find them. You always do it.
[17:58] And then you don't see anything. All you
[18:01] do is you suspect somebody and you don't
[18:03] like them. Now Jesus said these people
[18:06] may suspect this woman. They know she
[18:09] did it. She go and get you to get this.
[18:12] You got to get there. Amen. So you
[18:15] shouldn't even think about presenting
[18:17] people to God that look suspicious to
[18:18] you.
[18:20] If they look suspicious and it's scary
[18:22] suspicion, you have to pray. Amen. And
[18:24] pray good prayers towards them. Oh, God.
[18:27] Help a person to rise in the name of
[18:29] Jesus through God. Whatever difficulties
[18:32] you're going through, Lord, bless the
[18:34] Lord. Jesus said, I came to seek and
[18:36] save. And so the whole thing I came not
[18:39] into the world to condemn the word, but
[18:40] the word through me like save. So now if
[18:42] you operating in love, this is what love
[18:44] does. Bible says God so loved what he
[18:46] gave. Love is a giving thing of this
[18:48] love that came from God made him gave.
[18:51] It's only God's son. Amen. So I would
[18:53] like to see all these people see all the
[18:55] sins in America, everywhere, look
[18:57] sinful. Look at your bad.
[19:00] Let's raise some offering bread. Let's
[19:02] go. We sacrifice. Let's t let's go.
[19:05] We're going to go there and feed them
[19:07] and be nice to them and kind of them. I
[19:09] would like to see the church get a group
[19:11] of brothers if there's a gay march going
[19:14] on
[19:16] there and they're protesting. They're
[19:18] angry. I'd like to see some church get
[19:21] there and wear some nice outfits that
[19:24] says God loves us all. Don't just have
[19:27] it and say God loves you.
[19:30] God, you're not putting off. Yeah. No,
[19:33] God loves you anyway. He loves you
[19:35] anymore. No, God loves us all. You know,
[19:39] that's how I got saved
[19:42] by my
[19:43] condemnation. That's how you got saved.
[19:46] Don't forget,
[19:48] wear a t-shirt say God loves us all. And
[19:51] finally, they have that gay march. And
[19:54] then they prepare and
[19:55] get bottles of water cold water. bought
[19:59] cold water and some sandwiches and
[20:01] actually just and just go out there and
[20:03] when they come by certain corner just
[20:05] wait until they and just smile and give
[20:08] them a cold a bottle of cold water and
[20:10] give them some sandwiches to eat and so
[20:12] forth. Don't make a commentary on their
[20:15] sin. The Bible says this is the
[20:19] condemnation that men that light is
[20:21] coming to the world and men love
[20:23] darkness rather than light and their
[20:24] deeds are evil. So in other words, what
[20:26] people do does them
[20:29] You don't have to add insult to injury.
[20:31] The wages of sin is death. So if I'm
[20:34] going to be a lifegiver, I can't add
[20:36] insult to injury. This person is on the
[20:38] road of death. So I'm not going to send
[20:40] them a head faster.
[20:43] I'm going to push them over the cliff by
[20:46] cursing them. I'm nearing them. They're
[20:49] doing the
[20:50] right. And Christ is a hand extended to
[20:54] bring
[20:56] them a slave. And you give them no
[21:02] doctor. Have a good day. Take care and
[21:05] slide. Give them something. No. No. No.
[21:09] No. Get them to church.
[21:11] No. Or you do that when somebody comes
[21:14] here. You get a problem. You listen
[21:16] call.
[21:19] All I'm saying is do like Jesus did.
[21:22] Amen. Amen. Do like the
[21:25] savior does.
[21:30] He came not into the world to judge the
[21:33] world. I'm closing off by saying this.
[21:37] You see all this judging people are
[21:38] doing it. Jesus clearly say to the
[21:41] followers of Jesus, "Judge,
[21:44] lest you be judged." It doesn't feel
[21:47] good for people to judge you, especially
[21:48] when you know you're right. You haven't
[21:49] done anything wrong for you to judge
[21:50] him. Amen. Don't give it that ugly
[21:53] spirit. Don't give the spirit of
[21:55] judgment because Jesus said it clearly.
[21:58] I was sent by the father to the world
[22:00] and I came not to judge the world. Why
[22:03] do you feel you're following Jesus by
[22:05] judging
[22:06] me? When Jesus said, "I am sent to the
[22:10] mission not to judge but to seek and
[22:13] say, stay right there. Seek and say and
[22:16] then they don't want to change it. They
[22:18] want to stay nasty." The Bible says,
[22:19] "Let him let the filthy let be filthy
[22:21] still. And let those who be holy be holy
[22:23] still. They have a choice. Yes. But we
[22:26] have no choice in the matter deciding
[22:29] whether we're going to condemn them or
[22:31] judge them because we are not given that
[22:34] qualification. We not qualified to do
[22:37] it. That's right. We don't have the
[22:40] [Music]
[22:41] qualification. Look at the crooked
[22:43] judgment of the woman taking an act of
[22:44] adultery. If it was a just judgment,
[22:46] they would have got the man too.
[22:51] We fall short. I don't want you to have
[22:54] that. The only part I want you to have
[22:55] is do it like my son did. Just give
[22:58] gifts. Love people. Love sinners and
[23:00] whatever. That's the ending. That's the
[23:01] whole D. That's the whole commitment of
[23:04] Christians. Be nice. Be kind. Fill the
[23:06] atmosphere with goodness. Let the church
[23:08] come under a greater anointing where
[23:10] people see a change in direction and
[23:13] disposition. That's right.
[23:15] Don't cause people to be hating the
[23:18] church and alienated from the church
[23:21] because you're attacking them and
[23:22] judging them. You're out of place when
[23:25] you judge them because there is a
[23:27] judgment day and the one who knows how
[23:29] to judge does it right because angels
[23:31] are walking around all the time and
[23:33] writing them. The Bible says in book of
[23:35] revelation and then the bread might show
[23:37] judgment. The books are going to be open
[23:38] and it's going to be not right. Amen.
[23:41] That's right. When people go to the
[23:42] judgment, when we judge people, a lot of
[23:44] people go down that were innocent. Check
[23:47] the courts out. Check the jails. We
[23:49] can't do it. And God is not putting this
[23:51] high gift of salvation in the hands of
[23:54] people or bumbling detectives.
[23:58] We don't do it right and we can't do it
[23:59] right. Only he knows how to do it right
[24:01] because he got he's got this thing
[24:03] surrounded 24/7 angels and checking it
[24:06] and keep it and say on that day this is
[24:08] his job. So don't get in God's way and
[24:10] do his job. Do the job that you are
[24:13] supposed to do. Follow Jesus. Be kind.
[24:18] Go from here
[24:20] intentionally. See people in your job
[24:22] that you used to just ignore. Stop and
[24:24] just go from your smile. That's right.
[24:26] And differently towards them. Somebody
[24:28] that hurt your feeling. Just go for
[24:29] them. Just say something nice. Make a
[24:31] conversation. small talk and
[24:34] just because you are a living
[24:39] epist read the Bible they're going to
[24:41] look at me and you and you're going to
[24:43] be clue as to if this thing is really
[24:45] about what she's I can't believe what
[24:47] she has I couldn't drink that I look
[24:51] she's smiling and she's coming I want
[24:53] that that's peace that's joy it's
[24:55] righteousness and joy in the morning
[24:58] praise God hallelujah hallelujah
[25:02] [Applause]
[25:07] Thank God for the opportunity to come
[25:09] here and share with
[25:11] you. Listen carefully to what I'm
[25:13] saying. This is recorded. Listen to
[25:16] again and again and again. I'm bringing
[25:18] no new doctrine. I'm just reaffirming
[25:22] what a master said. Listen to what he
[25:24] said. He that hath an ear to hear,
[25:28] let him hear what the spirit is saying,
[25:33] of the church. Father, I give you thanks
[25:36] this day for the opportunity to lift you
[25:39] up. And I ask, oh God, that we wrap our
[25:45] hearts
[25:46] around. Give us a new energy, a new
[25:48] direction, a new sense of your presence.
[25:51] Give us the creativity to go distinctly
[25:54] intentionally loving people and treating
[25:56] people kindly. Those that we avoided,
[25:59] those that we disliked, let them become
[26:02] our first objective to change the
[26:05] paradigm. Help us to go to them tomorrow
[26:08] at work in our neighborhood. Do
[26:11] something
[26:12] like overcome the hate, the good. Let
[26:17] love, the light of love, cast away the
[26:21] darkness. Thanks, Lord. And I glorify
[26:24] your name.
[26:27] Amen.
[26:31] Amen. God love you and by God's grace,
[26:34] we will see you again at another time.

[27:11] flight to catch you off. Amen. Did you

[27:22] safely home. God be with you and say
