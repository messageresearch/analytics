have a dedication of a baby and may the lord bless us all as we come together on this wonderful marvelous day everything is to his glory and to his honor and that's why we have come together here in his marvelous name thank you so much god bless you all we'll go to the word and god bless you good to see you praise the lord uh god in the word we find in the book of john chapter 10 chapter 10 of the book of john jesus speaking okay reading from verse 1 john 10 verse 1. verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climb it up some other way this same is a thief and a robber but he that enter it in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the partner porter opnet and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leaded them out and when he put forth his own sheep he go it before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers let us pray gracious heavenly father once again we are invited into your marvelous wonderful royal presence thank you for these represented here today and may the holy spirit take the word and speak to us once again for we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen praise god god bless you please be seated i'm going to try something here that i don't normally try and that is using trying to see if i can use a tablet uh i'm trying to swing around to see if i can start using these newfangled things but uh i'm not like brother chris that's cerullo he's just uh he's just i praise god hallelujah my sheep know my voice now you know that the bible from genesis to revelation is really the story of redemption it's of how god transformed himself from unseen spirit being right on down to a visible being of flesh that we could know in the form and in the name of jesus christ now we know that the second adam who is jesus christ is now expressing or manifesting himself through the first adam who was the man that was flesh so spirit is now manifesting itself through flesh amen uh you'll find first corinthians 15 44 to 48 the first adam was earthy he was a flesh the second adam is the lord from heaven his spirit he is the quickening spirit that quickens everything amen so the gene of god the un unseen gene of god is here to express itself through visible flesh that has your name on it so the gene is expressing itself through us who are made of flesh so god in his great uh as i explained before how that god created man and man was first a spirit man but then in genesis 2 he says he formed man and so he took the spirit man adam who could not yet kill the soil and put him into the flesh man so that he could till the soil and so we find out that god sent the gene down here but then he had to form a body for that gene so he used our dabs and moms to form that body that that gene would come to we find in isaiah 44 1-4 and you can write it down he said to isaiah i formed thee from the womb and in psalms 139 13 1 to 16 he david said i was curiously wrought or formed right and wondrously made in the otherwise part of the earth then into jeremiah 1 4-5 he said jeremiah i form thee in the belly and i knew you before i formed you praise god god knew you before you were even formed hallelujah amen so i brought that to bring to your attention that the gene of god that was set down here amen is now searching to find its body now in you maybe it's found this body but it's searching to find its natural body amen and even so as your gene had to search to find your natural body the holy spirit as the great jehovah eagle is searching now to find the genes that he sent down here he is now here searching to find those genes amen you know brother branham's eagle's story that we know he told a story but it was really a story he was trying to illustrate something how that god the great eagle has come to earth and is searching to find his very own let me make the statement eternal life knows its own and eternal life knows its own body praise god hallelujah now about 800 years before mary got here on the earth mary i'm talking about the mother of jesus 800 years before isaiah the prophet stood up and said behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and his name shall be called emmanuel amen praise god and so praise the lord i'll get by past that back then the virgin conceived today i don't know if the church modern church can conceive the word in this day an hour in which we live hallelujah praise god so when that prophet spoke the word god said my word runs swiftly throughout the earth and it will not come back to me void until it's accomplished what i sent it forth to do so that word the spoken word from the mouth of god went out and when it went out for 800 years that word of god started brooding over the waters as in the beginning but this time the waters of the people it started searching in other words to find that body find mary wherever she was i'm sure a lot of denominations presented themselves that maybe they are the virgin and it searched maybe there was a lot of virgins in the land but the holy spirit bypassed every single one he bypassed them and came right straight to the he had to wait for the time and the season before he could find the exact virgin that god already had in his mind because you know we are made in the image of god and if you say chair right away you you visualize chair uh you you can see the chair you can see the eagle or whatever and god is the same way god spoke the word and right then he already knew who the virgin was so the holy spirit went out searching to find that virgin that was spoken of in the word of god hallelujah and the lord kept searching and would not stop until mary was born hallelujah and because the eternal spoken word of god always knows its own body that word went right straight to mary the virgin that was predestinated to receive that word and to hear it for her day and for her time and for our hour praise god amen you'll find brother branham making that statement in questions and answers on the seals paragraph 96 where he is the one that said eternal life knows its own body and it will find its own body wherever that is is such till it finds that body right there praise god so we are thankful to god that the lord found me i'm glad the word found you i'm glad he found all of us amen we are here not because we were searching for god but god searched for his own and he found his own amen and we are here because he has found us and he has identified himself with us praise god amen the word will always know the word if the word is in you then the word in you will always know and recognize the word amen praise god and we see here uh that word let me bypass that praise god these two attributes or these two thoughts of god that came out of the mind of god let's say jesus and mary that came out hallelujah there in the mind of god they were identified together right because he knew that jesus had to come through mary so before the beginning before the beginning in the mind of god these two attributes were together and so is it with you and i that you and i were identified in the mind of god with this message and this word of god that one day somewhere this word and you will come together by the will and purpose and plan of god because this is what he had in his mind from before the foundation of the world hallelujah so we find that this body of truth that we call or know as the message had to be here so that we could identify with it praise the lord and we were ordained by god to recognize each other the message will recognize you and you will recognize it and there will be a resurrection of recognition and that's what i'm talking about briefly here today by the grace of god and i wish those in the back will take note of that and place the name of this sermon on the internet when this goes up by the grace of god the resurrection of recognition praise god hallelujah oh praise god now that is why all of our life even before we were christians we were always finding ourselves different or we were searching and we didn't know what we were searching for no matter what we did we we never could feel satisfied we couldn't feel fulfilled because something in us that we were unconscious of was searching to find something that will bring satisfaction bring fulfillment to us and we could never find it now i won't go down the list because you know you have other preachers can do that and say you know you were into drugs you were into this you were into that you tried that you tried this you tried the other your spirit is searching everywhere but there it is my friend that we were there searching to find this great word amen hallelujah now what it was was just this message and the moment that i found this true message of god for this hour my it's just like i let off the pressure hey man praise god now let me make this straight not when i first came in the message of course i was like everybody i was just slinging rocks and slashing with my sword and chopping everything in sight and fighting the devil and doing whatever i have to do like that but then as the spirit of god began to teach you mold you and everything else you'll find out that you only use the sword when god tells you to you don't do anything unless he tells you to other than that you just hold to god's unchanging hand amen now in the mind of god these two thoughts of you and the message knew one another before you even got here you knew each other back there in the very mind of god and you were searching and you didn't know what you were searching for hallelujah because the body was searching for its head and you were searching to find the word that would lead you enough preeminence over you and to be able to guide you through your life amen hallelujah you don't you were unconscious of course because none of us knew what we were searching for what we were longing for and what we were watching for hallelujah but thank god we found the the message found us or brother branham puts this this way your theophany found you amen your theophany found you but you see once i heard this message maybe the same with you i don't know what it was but i could sense something different i could sense a connection i could sense something there within me it seems like i had heard this before it seems as if i had seen it before but i don't know where it seems to me brother sister that i could sense an unconscious affinity with what i was hearing coming out of the prophet it connected in other words with something inside of here and i couldn't put it into english or to be able to explain it to you what i'm telling you here now um maybe others have said it but i'm telling you what the holy spirit has been speaking to me over this past week and and putting into my soul here and i'm just bringing that to you here now by the grace of god hallelujah an unconscious affinity within me that's why the prophet said when there the true seed hear this message he said they'll take to it like a duck to water because it's their nature it's just their nature they can't avoid it hallelujah praise god amen praise god let's look at this word recognize and you know you can see today i'm a little slower and i'm deliberately being slower i looked on the dictionary.com on the internet and it says to recognize is to identify something someone or somewhere that was previously seen or known by you the individual or you could not recognize it amen you had to know it before you had to see it before you had to be in that place before or else you could not recognize it do you recognize your day and the message for your day do you recognize this christ hallelujah amen amen praise god we were there in the mind of god and we had some affinity with this word already but we did not recognize it for a reason which i will further touch upon now in biochemistry recognize means to bind two objects together to unite with recognized means one substance recognizes the other substance that they would fit together and thus are of two molecular shapes or structures will be able to fit and bind and they have the word there and cleave together praise god oh my your nighting time praise god amen the invisible union of the pride when this g inside of you recognizes the word it brings about the union praise god because something in you recognizes the word for your day and a message for your day hallelujah and there is beyond the chemical reaction amen because that's another things here they said some something that all of the same substance that will fit hallelujah recognize each other and those substances are able to blend together as one they can blend together me and jesus we got a good thing going oh my praise god god in christ christ in the church amen the kingdom coming back together again by the grace of god oh may god give us a resurrection in our hearts us recognition of him the word of god for this day and our amen so with all those remarks i have been saying that to say that for you to recognize something you have had to or somebody or recognize a place or somewhere you had to have seen it before you have had to have been there before you have to have heard it before or not beforehand hallelujah or be familiar with it or you won't be able to recognize it or praise god you say how do you know that because i got a garden shed in the back of my house and in that shed i got shovels i got forks i got uh a pick and other things in there i got saws for cutting branches on trees it's all there but now here you come you don't know anything about any of those tools and i'm outside with you and we're talking and everything else and i just turned around and said oh don't get me a shovel there and i keep working keep working when i look around you come up to me and you got a fork in your hand so what are you doing with the fork i sent you for a shovel right but you see that person doesn't know what a chef list to begin with so how they're going to recognize it even if they see it when you look what do you see what do you recognize you're looking at the same word i'm looking at but what do you recognize because of something the gene whatever is in you it's never been there it doesn't know the person it's not familiar with the place so how could it recognize now here even if the thing is right in front of you right in front of you you will recognize it because you are not there to begin with jesus said no man can go up to heaven unless he first came down from heaven you can't do it it's impossible praise god amen oh my brother sister how will you know what the gene of god in you is looking for amen i want to ask you how did nathaniel know what his soul inside was really looking for amen because when he came in contact with jesus something about jesus seemed familiar to him his spirit he in him was familiar with what he was hearing what he was seeing oh may god help you to recognize what you are hearing what you are seeing and just don't look at me but look at the word of god hallelujah amen praise god amen i tell your friends you remember brother branham's life story he said when he was a boy he was fetching water to go to the house and he's going to pass a a big pine tree and out of the branches of the tree you know he heard a voice speaking and the voice speaking and telling him not to defile yourself don't you smoke nor drink for i have great work for you to do amen many many years later now he's praying in his prayer room in his house and while he's praying there praying there all of a sudden a light appeared above him in the room and he's wondering to know what it was and then the light grows bigger and bigger and bigger and out of the light steps a man right and you know a lot of people will think those things that these things brother branham told her like stories but i'm going to insert myself in here and whatever you want to think about it that's up to you but when i heard about this message just about 18 years old and i started to preach it in the town where my wife is from and the holy spirit began to move and revival broke out oh we would be fellowshipping late in the night myself and the brothers standing on a bridge and we're talking and there's a bush behind them and i'm facing them and we're talking and out of that bush comes up light about 18 inches across like that and it's moving slowly it's not in no hurry it's moving slow and i i'm just wondering maybe because we read about the message so much in here about the prophet i'm i'm seeing this so this so i didn't tell them i just turned i said brothers just step back a little bit and look tell me if you see anything and they when they turn around oh what what what is that they were they were seeing it too but then i thought i said well all of us believe the message maybe because we read it and we study it and we talk about it so much we're imagining things so my aunt's house was like where the neighbor's house is and i went over there to to them and this was like midnight uh and i knocked on the door bang bang bang and they came out in their night clothing you know five six of them said what's the matter boy what's what's wrong i said can you look and tell me if you see anything amen and they looked and when they look like oh my god what is that what is that so the five six of them who don't believe the message they are nobody convinced by nothing right and they could see it and apparently this being and i call it a being because once it was moving slow and waiting and once they come out and they could see it that's just to get me confident and for me to know this is just saith the lord once they became aware of that that thing suddenly went and went up into the heavens and just went up among the stars and disappeared and that was the end of it so i am not talking about this just because i read it in the book i am telling you because it is the truth and because i personally experience it but brother branham heard that voice in the bush and years later when he's in a man he's a man out of this light steps a person a man hallelujah said and his face and picture had no beard not like the one they have pictures of jesus but he stepped right out of the light and said fear not i'm set from the presence of almighty god to tell you that your peculiar life and ministry and he began to declare to him he said the moment that angel began to speak i recognized that it was the same voice that called to me from within the bush when he was a boy he recognizes the same voice hallelujah praise god it's the same way brother sisters no matter what form it comes in wherever you are how long it takes when you hear that genuine real voice you know it's thus saith the lord as the voice of god in these last days nobody has to convince you and i'm not here to convince anybody amen my struggling is over because god keeps his own god speaks to his own god straightens his own hallelujah and we just teach the word of god here by the glory of god hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise god now we go back to the scriptures john 10 jesus said my sheep know my voice hallelujah and a stranger they will not follow well the sheep never met him until he came down to earth those few sheep that he had back there they only met him when he came to work how are they going to know him if they never met him before but you see he said in another place i had joy with you before the foundations of the earth before you even knew it i knew you and i had joy with you praise god so my sheep now he's not talking only of those 12 that were back there throughout the rest of the ages they're gonna know my voice why they're gonna know my voice because the resurrection of supernatural recognition within them is going to take place and they're going to recognize they didn't just come now but that they were back there before the foundations of the world that's why they could hear it recognize it see it and know what it is amen and that's why you are here today not because of me but you are here because of something in your soul look after i'm gone from this place praise god by his grace i thank god for excellent help that god is keeping me and i i'd like to boast a little bit on my age i'm 76 uh 70 yes i'll be 76 in a few days and uh then i'm on on the road praise god but let me tell you something praise god about the time that i am going to and you better prepare yourself and pray about this i'm going to have to hand over the leadership and reigns of this church you don't want me to keep preaching until i'm old and decorated and and they have to wheel me up in a wheelchair and i'm saying and the lord said no you don't want that to happen amen praise the lord so i'm going to have to place this responsibility on somebody else's shoulders in my mind let me say that way right now i believe it's going to fall on brother uh danny missy i believe it's going to fall on his shoulders now if god wants something different that's in god's hands but i'm just telling you what i think praise the lord so brothers this whole thing is not built on me this is built on him the word and i'm just saying that long after i am gone which i'm not hustling to go away too soon let me say because you got to watch what you say these days i don't want god to take me at my word lord you know a lot of christians do that you know lord i'm ready to go oh you're ready okay i'll call you tonight oh no no everybody wants to go to heaven nobody wants to die how are you going to get to heaven right see so we we just just understand what i'm trying to say praise the lord brother sister that how will the sheep know his voice the sheep will know my voice now because of a shock that the human race had through a spiritual car crash is the way i'd like to uh visualize it you know people get car crashing they get their neck and their back and different things happen to them some lose their mind they lose their memory everything else well the human race went through something like that and because of that shock amen our memories have been darkened brother branham said it in the future home of the heavenly bride and bridegroom he said only jesus was the only person because he was god when he come down here he knows full well everything that happened from before the foundation of the world right on down but the rest of us he said our minds were darkened we're not allowed to remember what took place before the foundations of the world right but if you are a part of his people or you are part of him and you are in him then you were there but it was not it's not time for you to remember because the sin of adam and eve so shocked us that it caused us to go into that state which is called spiritual amnesia back again listen amnesia the loss of a large block of memories it is a complete or partial loss of your memories caused by some shock or brain injury we can't even remember who we are some of us came in the world and we said we'll drink the ramen throw in the bottle and enjoy ourselves with the high wine and enjoy ourselves with the johnny walker whiskey and everything else because we want to act like a pig act like the world dance like the world carry on like the world because that's who we thought we were because we were in a state of spiritual amnesia and that's what we thought we were and we carried on that way amen we can't even remember when we finish enjoying ourselves and everything else and we want to go back home we don't even know where our home is we go wandering all around the streets wondering where is your home right like that and we end up many of us end up in the gutters we end up in all kinds of places unseemly places at the time it seemed okay in your mind and in your mind's eyes uh like that you you pass by all friends that you used to have fellowship with and joy with amen before the foundations you walk right past them you don't recognize them anymore because you're in a state of spiritual amnesia familiar places you go right by it and you don't recognize what it is amen praise god things that you once knew you forgot totally forgot praise god how can we remember how can you experience that restoration a spiritual uh recognition amen and i continue of what the holy spirit was speaking to me about he says read again john 14 26 let us turn to our bibles because i want you to read it which we all have read it many times but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you of all things now this is gonna this is bringing a different thought because when they preach the scriptures they use the same words but they think that he will teach you and bring to your remembrance but the holy spirit says not just the remembrance of the things you learn down here but he is to bring that is his office to bring to your remembrance when your mind was darkened all them things you couldn't remember he is now here to walk with you and teach you and remind you of all that you forgot since before the foundations of the world amen let's read it together again praise god hallelujah but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all all things not some things all things the seals are open the word is open he will bring to you all things your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you here and there i bring everything i said to you back there and what i say to you here here bring it all to your remembrance right here while you're here upon the earth amen you'll need a resurrection hallelujah of spiritual recognition amen a restoration of your remembrance praise god hallelujah amen praise god just think of it the holy spirit is now here so open up our darkened memories and day by day as we come in the house of god or read or study our bibles at home the holy spirit the man that can turn on the light is right there to turn on light and bring to your attention all the things that you learned when you are back there in the presence of god hallelujah amen things that you heard back there you know you participated when the sons and daughters of god were shouting for joy bring it all back to your remembrance praise the lord i'm not going to expand i'm going to wind this message up now but praise god he's just going to start bringing to your remembrance when you are in the quietness and in the presence of the living god and show you where you come from amen and begin to reveal to you persons and things from the dim and ancient past of your of your existence and of your memories he'll bring it back to you praise god praise the lord you know i i'm not preaching on that well i just say this in passing that tells you that any christian that have a problem with their mind a mental problem the holy spirit is here with this word to balance you back off and bring back to your memories everything you lost naturally and spiritually and give you back a a perfect mind amen give your back clear thinking clear thoughts amen and bring you back to your original went before the devil messed you up or shocked your mind or shut you up no way god is gonna bring you back to who you really are by this word amen hallelujah oh with the opening of these seals our darkened minds are receiving the resurrection of spiritual recognition of the word of who we are and who he is and these two substances these two same material husband and wife are drawn together by the great holy spirit of the living god amen jesus he is the light of the world praise god amen praise god hallelujah so i'm thankful to god that he chose us to recognize him later on another time we'll touch on the fact that we really didn't choose him but he chose us you have not chosen me but i have chosen you know you go to most of these churches or pentecostal churches and they tell you run up to the altar and and uh you take jesus as your savior that's wonderful that's marvelous but the fact is he chose you before you even knew anything before you knew anything he chose you praise the lord brother branham said you are only coming to recognize that now hallelujah but you are already chosen you are one of his elected one of his chosen people one called by the grace of god and brought to his grace amen his loving grace amen i trust the day by just listening to the word that you will come to a place of spiritual resurrection and recognition if not i'm going to pray that you will begin to say to yourself and say to the lord in the words of this little chorus we all know while the musicians are coming lord fill me now jesus come and fill me now fill me with the teacher the one that will remind me fill me with thy holy spirit oh jesus come and fill me now how many wants to be filled or refilled or refreshed with the holy spirit look i want a refreshing every day i don't know about you but i want to be refreshed with the holy spirit every single day of my life and i thank god for that amen because you can i can read the scriptures a thousand times a million times and god can still show me things in there that i still haven't seen you better not take your crayon and mark off a scripture and say i understand that one and mark it and say well you know you already mine everything out of it no no man by searching can find out god but to whom he would reveal himself to isn't he wonderful i'm so thankful to him fill me now just let's just worship the lord [Music] fill me now lord fill me now jesus come and fill me now fill me with thy holy spirit come o come and feel one more time [Music] fill me now fill me now [Music] jesus come and fill me now fill me with thy holy spirit here oh come and build our gracious heavenly father we have declared thy word now we pray the great holy spirit will take the word and deposit it where he wills to thee be all the praise the honor and the glory for we ask it in the name of our blessed lord and savior jesus christ amen now while the musicians play a few hymns we prepare ourselves for the dedication of this baby of hannah asari bringing her baby malaya to be dedicated to the glory of god amen god bless you i'll just just take a minute and i'll be right back out god bless you [Music] [Applause] [Music] rain [Applause] is [Music] bring them [Music] the in [Music] could you put up the words for i'm an attribute of god look at me [Music] before the world was born [Music] before [Music] tomorrow [Music] me [Music] was nothing can separate us [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] oh over here [Music] i was always there [Music] is [Music] me [Music] praise god we're happy to be here today for this marvelous and wonderful dedication and it is my prayer that the great holy spirit will bless not only the child but the entire family after this maybe in a week's time you'll be able to receive a dedication certificate okay [Music] as you of course god has used you to bring this child in to the world but that only proves that you're a man and that she's a woman that is different from being a mother and a father that's another part of the entire journey that we have on this earth that that's the protection the provision and so on all those various things amen so we pray that god will help you to take the now parental responsibility that we all must take uh for for our journey here on earth the dedication of this child is not to dedicate the child and then you are bond on the child because i i place the child in god's hand so now god is going to take care of it no we don't a bond on the child we place the child in god's hand because we're asking for his help because if in no other day or in no other time in this time that we are living in every parent including myself we need help we need god's help because we are not able to raise these kids by of by ourselves you cannot watch them 24 7. you can't know what is in their thoughts the times are changing the age is changing sometimes we don't even know what they're thinking because they don't think like us anymore everything is changed so we must ask for god's help and so this great uh experience here at this altar is asking for the direction of god to come upon the child but don't forget you are the trainer you are the coach you are the example you are the one that the child will be looking up looking on and taking their imprint in their mind and mentality their whole character and their environment is going to shape them and so we must take that responsibility that we will do the best we can we can only do the best we can and with god's help that he will help us to be what we are supposed to be we can't escape from that amen and the bible tells us proverbs 22 6 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old they will not depart from it that is supposed to be old-fashioned the modern way is to leave them in the school teach them psychology and and let them have their way but i am sorry i was raised the old-fashioned way with the old switch named john and when my father said bring me john from off the wall there you know what's going to happen so therefore with that old-fashioned training i don't think it spoiled me or did me anything or damaged me mentally or in any way right never mind the bible doesn't tell us to abuse but he says we need to discipline we need to train these children up in the grace of god hallelujah amen jesus when he was young said to mary wish you not i must be about my father's business amen praise god and so god is asking you to engage yourself in a tax-free job of child rearing you're not going to be paid for this financially paid for it but um every seed draws to itself its own blessing just a natural seed goes in the ground you know it pulls like they said about about six feet away that seed starts pulling nutrients to itself spiritually speaking every child literally does the same thing it begins to draw to the parents blessings not for the parent's sake but for that child's sake it starts pulling it and drawing it to itself so that the parents are able to sustain raise and grow that child in the fear and grace of god it's a full-time job and it's really going to tax your patience praise the lord hallelujah i hope you're not in a hurry because we live in a day where everything got to be quick fast quit russia rush the rest there but the god doesn't work that way right isn't that true right bible tells us foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child but the rod of correction shall drive it far from them so we need discipline from time to time look i was watching the tv and some homeless kids down in toronto some of them were crying to the reporter and saying oh when i look at my friends when their parents come and find them in the street and take them back home and crying over them oh i i wish my parents would come and correct me and and come and pull me or what they actually want the parent to correct them they actually want the parent to tell them right even when they might act like they don't want to hear but they're still listening you just have to share with them what you know and then let god do the rest as i tell the church here do your best and then let god do the rest that's all you can do is to do your best right so god spirit is actually wanting you to go through a training course of your life here um and to train this child by his grace so you brought this child to the this altar for dedication and you must be conscious through divine revelation of god's purpose and plan not just for the child but for you amen and that god will raise you all up listen john 16 he will show you things to come he will glorify me he shall receive of mine and show it unto you all things that the father had our mind therefore said i he shall take of mine and show it unto you amen praise god thank god god knew like i just finished preaching that this child would be here and god just used you to bring that child here right but before this child was there physically it was in god spiritually but he had to get it here and he had to use somebody to get it here but it's here now and he's saying while it's here this is something that i want you to take care of amen praise god hallelujah so brother sisters recognize this amen god said to abraham i know abraham that he will command and train his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment amen the privilege of parenthood i say privilege because lots of people that i know of spend their whole life wanting one one grain we say one child and they weren't able to get it right so it's a privilege of parenthood when god could bless you that way it's also our honor that god would select you to do that amen and also their wits for you great rewards at the end of the road because the your greatest legacy is if you grow old enough like me let's say that you know you get all like me and you end up having children and grandchildren then you can look at them with pride you can look at them and say well you know like myself i know i made a lot of mistakes i could have done things better but what is done is done but the best that i did i did the best i could the rest is in god's hand nothing else i can do about it but now i can pray for them at least i can advise them if they want advice but it's really all in god's hand amen praise the name of the lord and god will reward you moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful amen and god said that he you will give account of your stewardship for thou mayest be no longer assured amen so it's important that god bless you that god sanctify your walk and that god will sanctify your home god would sanctify your union god will sanctify the child god will bless the entire family because a family is a support system it's a blanket support system telling you without speaking you're not on your own your daddy is here your mommy is here you know your uncle you you're on they're here they're not saying it but by their very presence they're telling you we are a support system so you have a problem don't keep it by yourself just talk about it you know praise god uh choose somebody in the family you know you could have personal talk with and share what's in your heart and then pray together and god will make a way somehow right so i commit you as pastor into the hands of god and that god would lead and guide both of you and strengthen you in your divine walk of course let me give you the name of the child malaya siree moore born february 1st 2021 to henry asari and jermaine moore we welcome you here in the house of the lord amen praise the lord with no hesitation whatsoever we welcome you and we welcome this beautiful wonderful child praise god it's all right you hold her she's so friendly look she's happy praise god she's one one great barrel of joy am i look at her she actually wants to come princess god some children cry where she wants to come you know she you can see she's going to be an extrovert you know we're experts in person praise the lord yeah i guess she sends my spirit because i'm like that my wife usually say to me when we're walking and i say hi how are you personally you know that person no i don't know them but it's just my way i just love people regardless and it's the same way right right right praise the lord okay let us pray praise god hallelujah father in the name of jesus christ thy beloved son as your representative your servant i lay my hands upon this beloved child and i pray that the great holy spirit will bless her pour your spirit out upon her pour your spirit upon his parents father and help them in raising this child whom you have given to them that this child will come to know you in the power of your resurrection and come to walk with you and love you from the bottom of their heart i commit her in your name i dedicate malia in your name i bless her in your name i prosper her way in your name i ask your divine knowledge the great holy spirit will follow her protect her and reveal yourself to her when it is the of the right time and season for we ask it in the name of jesus christ and for divine help to these two parents father we pray in the name of jesus christ you will be here with anna you will be here with germaine the great holy spirit will overshadow them lead them and guide them in your name's sake and may the spirit of god come upon this entire family lord may the great holy spirit you are not dead but you're alive forevermore oh god of heaven who hears and knows all things you who know it the hearts of all men
