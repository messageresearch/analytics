[0:00] and when that comes he said that algebra
[0:03] will be revealed to them
[0:05] at that particular time praise god oh my
[0:11] i don't know much about astronomy
[0:15] i don't know much about geography
[0:18] oh praise god but i know that god has
[0:22] revealed to me this word
[0:24] this led me back where i can see the
[0:27] fullness of the word the word he said
[0:30] it's not even written in the bible
[0:32] praise the lord i've made this kind of
[0:34] clear i'm not going to keep you all day
[0:37] but i want to make this clear
[0:39] that um
[0:41] you know the seven thunders if i can
[0:43] give you a human illustration it's like
[0:46] when you're speaking right
[0:48] there's the word you're hearing and then
[0:51] there's the nuances
[0:53] coming out from that word
[0:55] right because you can read there the
[0:57] book says what
[1:00] or why
[1:02] but then if you heard the actual person
[1:04] use it you will know how
[1:07] why
[1:08] why
[1:09] why
[1:12] why is that see
[1:14] so therefore you can't just trust that
[1:16] you oh i read it in the bible that's
[1:18] good that you read it there but did you
[1:21] get a revelation
[1:23] and the prophet said the only way you
[1:25] can get that he said that will take the
[1:27] author of the book to come and reveal
[1:32] the author of the book has to reveal to
[1:36] you
[1:37] for you to recognize what god is saying
[1:40] in the word that's just being able to
[1:42] read your bible read the quotes it's
[1:44] just being able to know english and have
[1:46] a good intelligence to be able to read
[1:48] and understand
[1:50] that amen hallelujah all praise god
[1:54] hallelujah no
[1:57] brother brown said those seven sons are
[1:58] not even written
[2:01] and if they're not written
[2:03] they're telling you
[2:04] they're not going to believe
[2:06] they're not going to believe it
[2:08] whatsoever because they got to see it to
[2:11] believe it
[2:12] amen right praise god and they're not
[2:16] they're people right now in the world
[2:17] they will not accept the unwritten word
[2:20] in other words they will accept from the
[2:22] seven thunders for the prophet tells you
[2:25] clear and the bible tells you seven
[2:27] thunders were not to be written
[2:30] hallelujah
[2:32] it's to become living epistles to be
[2:35] read of all men in god's people
[2:39] hallelujah the seven thunders are going
[2:41] to be made manifest in a people and will
[2:44] be revealed to them it'll be algebra to
[2:47] the rest of them but to us we will
[2:49] understand you will be made to
[2:50] understand hallelujah i can assume that
[2:53] all of you sitting in front of me is one
[2:56] of them i you must know that for
[2:58] yourself
[2:59] hallelujah you must be able to catch the
[3:03] revelation of the word and let the word
[3:05] embed itself in you wake up the seed of
[3:09] life that is in you the germ the gene
[3:12] that's in you hallelujah
[3:15] where you can't fail to recognize you
[3:18] just oh i'm just a housewife uh oh it
[3:21] ain't got none of that anymore
[3:24] you don't have to know anything
[3:26] when that word begins to break like the
[3:28] prophet said uh wash a woman out in the
[3:31] middle of nowhere one revelation that
[3:34] veil rips
[3:35] once it rips and she puts her head in
[3:37] did she see a little something she
[3:39] started to go in further the next week
[3:41] going further she's gone beyond the veil
[3:44] lord of god hallelujah may god help
[3:47] every one of us
[3:49] to be able to go beyond the veil of the
[3:52] written word and enter into christ the
[3:56] word making itself known hallelujah amen
[4:00] we know
[4:01] that voice the seven thunders israeli
[4:05] the voice of the mighty angel of
[4:07] revelation 10.
[4:09] revelation 10 3
[4:11] the bible says when he
[4:13] uttered his voice
[4:16] seven thunders
[4:18] blasted out amen
[4:20] remember when them when those various uh
[4:24] messengers came
[4:26] each one of them this thunder broke and
[4:29] a seal blasted and then the truth made
[4:31] known to them they heard one thunder
[4:34] what is telling you they're down through
[4:36] the edges all the other edges got one
[4:40] thunder two 3
[4:42] being revealed to them in other words
[4:44] they only could receive partial truths
[4:48] is that right
[4:50] but seven is the number of perfection
[4:54] and the mighty angel's
[4:56] message
[4:58] will be the full voice of the mighty
[5:01] angel
[5:03] amen being made known to his beloved
[5:06] bride
[5:08] hallelujah
[5:09] and that means that we have been blessed
[5:12] of god
[5:13] not to hear
[5:14] one thunder blast in a spiritual war
[5:17] declare but we are here hearing the
[5:21] rolling thunder of the voice of the
[5:23] mighty angel
[5:25] amen hallelujah amen rolling roaring
[5:29] rolling what's the difference the voice
[5:32] of the mighty angel rolling with the
[5:35] word of god one after the other bringing
[5:38] you to a place where you recognize that
[5:41] it's god speaking from his word amen
[5:44] glory to god hallelujah amen yes sir oh
[5:49] it's called the unwritten word what's
[5:51] the purpose what's the purpose of those
[5:55] seven mysterious thunders of the voice
[5:58] of that mighty angel that are not
[6:01] written at all listen
[6:04] they're not even written at all
[6:07] i believe
[6:09] that through the purpose of the seven
[6:11] thunders through
[6:13] these seven thunders
[6:16] one
[6:17] will be revealed
[6:20] in order to get the bride together for
[6:25] rupturing faith
[6:27] amen let me go back what's the purpose
[6:30] of the seven thunders
[6:33] the seven thunders will be revealed
[6:37] first of all it will be a revelation
[6:40] right it's telling you right there the
[6:42] seven thunders will be a revelation it's
[6:44] not something you're going to go and
[6:46] study
[6:47] or do
[6:48] all kinds of efforts of man
[6:52] and what's the purpose of it in order
[6:55] to get the bride together
[7:00] in a convention in a camp meeting
[7:03] in any kind of
[7:05] thing like that even though it's good
[7:08] intention that's man-made effort
[7:10] but the fulfillment of the word is the
[7:13] genuine elect of god will come together
[7:17] when the watchman isaiah speaking
[7:20] on the walls of zion
[7:23] will begin to see eye to eye
[7:26] they'll see the same thing if i stand on
[7:30] the rock where moses stood
[7:33] what am i going to see i'm only going to
[7:35] see what he already saw
[7:37] because it's the same scene i'm sitting
[7:39] on the same rock that he stood i'm
[7:42] looking in the same direction so i'm
[7:44] seeing what he saw
[7:46] and that's what the seven thunders does
[7:48] for you and i we begin to see what the
[7:51] prophet saw
[7:52] what he saw on why he said many things
[7:55] that he is saying and has said we begin
[7:58] to get a clear understanding we got a
[8:01] distillation and clarity on what he has
[8:04] said amen because it's right before us
[8:08] by the holy spirit through grace alone
[8:12] amen hallelujah oh my praise god of
[8:17] course if you want to accept the
[8:19] unwritten word you simply won't be in
[8:21] the rapture it's just as simple as that
[8:23] you simply won't be in the rapture
[8:25] because it's the seven unwritten
[8:28] thunders that gives you
[8:30] rapturing faith
[8:32] what is faith
[8:35] what did brother branham say his faith
[8:36] anybody can tell me verbally
[8:38] say it love come on
[8:41] amen
[8:42] faith is a revelation so when he said
[8:45] that the seven thunders would give to us
[8:48] rapturing what
[8:51] revelation
[8:54] rapturing revelation
[8:56] a revelation that will put you in
[8:59] that state that rapturing condition that
[9:03] rapturing state glory to god hallelujah
[9:07] you don't have to do nothing you don't
[9:09] have to try nothing you don't have to
[9:10] work up yourself to nothing but by a
[9:13] revelation amen you are brought into a
[9:16] rapturing condition by the grace of
[9:18] almighty god hallelujah amen yes sir so
[9:23] somebody tells you uh that there's that
[9:26] there's like how i'm preaching now about
[9:28] seven mysterious thunders and the turn
[9:30] of the voice of the mighty angel it's
[9:32] nice for me to be saying that here and
[9:34] you just listening but this is
[9:37] declaring a spiritual war
[9:40] and no doubt there are people that may
[9:42] be fuming angry or mad already from
[9:44] hearing what i'm saying
[9:46] talking about eternal church age how
[9:49] dare you
[9:50] you're talking about seven thunders or
[9:54] not written in the bible and asking me
[9:56] to believe
[9:57] oh my spiritual war
[10:01] hey man you'll understand what i'm
[10:03] saying here i'm going to use up my time
[10:05] if you don't mind is that okay i'm going
[10:08] to use up my time here praise the name
[10:10] of the lord jesus hallelujah a spiritual
[10:13] war is beginning and it's starting with
[10:16] thee with this preaching and talking
[10:18] about the unwritten word amen praise god
[10:23] hallelujah i want to thank god that he
[10:26] had a man named william marion branham
[10:30] who became the mount peace
[10:34] for a voice for the mighty angel
[10:38] many of you have heard it in the in the
[10:40] message i don't know if they still have
[10:41] that part in uh
[10:44] looking to the unseen when a voice
[10:45] suddenly spoke out
[10:47] this is not william branham speaking
[10:50] this is the lord god almighty come down
[10:54] amen praise god what it was the spirit
[10:58] of god speaking through the prophet
[11:01] god making himself known amen hallelujah
[11:05] many times many of you here
[11:08] and if you don't do it you should do it
[11:12] you said but long after i'm gone you
[11:14] just sit in a chair
[11:16] laying up you know in your living room
[11:20] in a quietness and listen
[11:22] while them tips are playing hallelujah
[11:26] and while they're playing there in the
[11:28] middle of the quietness revelation will
[11:30] strike your heart
[11:32] out to the voice of that prophet out of
[11:34] that message revelation is going to
[11:36] strike your heart amen yes sir oh my i
[11:41] tell you friends those seven thunders
[11:45] declares spiritual war
[11:48] amen
[11:49] it brings the bride together
[11:52] i know i'm repeating myself but i'm just
[11:54] nailing like the prophet said a good
[11:56] carpenter you don't hit the nail one
[11:58] time and stop you hit it a couple of
[11:59] times to make sure it catches amen and
[12:03] so here we are it gathers the bride
[12:06] together
[12:07] it gives faith or revelation for
[12:10] rapturing grace
[12:13] hallelujah for revelation is my grace
[12:17] alone
[12:18] praise god hallelujah it reveals christ
[12:24] hallelujah what does the seven
[12:26] thunders do it reveals christ
[12:30] he's revealed in his own word amen
[12:34] let's listen
[12:36] seven thunders to get the bride together
[12:40] because what we got right now we won't
[12:42] be able to do it
[12:44] you're trying to operate on the second
[12:46] pull and get into the rapture
[12:48] by by being able to say you heal this
[12:50] person and you you cast out this devil
[12:53] many gonna come to me in that day and in
[12:55] my name even that's saying that they've
[12:57] done these things but that's not it the
[13:00] thing is the word for this day and for
[13:02] this hour all those things gonna follow
[13:04] the people that are carrying the word of
[13:06] god when it is necessary we don't have
[13:09] to do all these other things to prove
[13:12] that god is with us but when god needs
[13:15] to use you for that purpose
[13:18] it will happen is that right
[13:21] i know what i'm talking i'm just saying
[13:23] hi how are you and i just took the
[13:25] person

[16:03] it's all by faith by the help by the
[16:06] holy spirit that's gonna hear the voice
[16:10] of the mighty angel when the word begins
[16:13] to you recognize it all of a sudden the
[16:15] excitement built in your soul and the
[16:17] word starts to blast off within you amen
[16:20] inside your entire being praise god
[16:24] hallelujah think of it
[16:27] we've only got faith
[16:30] amen
[16:33] enough faith for that
[16:35] for divine healing
[16:37] yeah there's lots of brothers even in
[16:39] this message they got faith for divine
[16:41] healing and casting out devils and all
[16:43] that he said yeah we only got fed for
[16:45] that
[16:46] amen and that's good
[16:48] but
[16:49] he said you've got to have enough faith
[16:54] or revelation
[16:55] to be changed in a moment to be swept
[17:00] up out of this earth
[17:02] and we will find that
[17:06] after a while the lord willing we will
[17:10] find where it is written
[17:15] listen
[17:16] he said the seven thunder is the
[17:17] unwritten word amen hallelujah now he's
[17:21] turning around and he's saying
[17:24] we got to have
[17:26] revelation
[17:28] right in a moment to be swept up off the
[17:31] earth and we will find that
[17:35] after a while the lord willing we will
[17:38] find
[17:39] where it is written you're going to go
[17:42] right back to these same spoken word
[17:44] books that you used to read and you
[17:46] understood in a certain way and all of a
[17:48] sudden
[17:50] you're gonna find
[17:51] it right in those spoken words book it's
[17:54] written but it's not written
[17:58] you're reading it
[17:59] and when you give somebody else the same
[18:01] thing to read all they can see is the
[18:03] writing
[18:04] but you are reading something else into
[18:07] it
[18:07] because it's right there in front of
[18:09] your eyes
[18:11] you'll find where it is written after a
[18:13] while praise god i think we're in the
[18:15] middle of it right now
[18:18] i believe we are partakers of it
[18:20] then
[18:22] the judgments
[18:24] of these evil
[18:26] doers
[18:28] that we've seen through the church ages
[18:31] as the seals
[18:35] was breaking
[18:37] amen
[18:39] you know that the seals never really
[18:42] just all break at the seventh church age
[18:44] they were breaking down through the ages
[18:47] they only come to the consummation and
[18:49] fullness
[18:50] at the end of time
[18:52] he's saying it right here
[18:53] he said the seals have been breaking
[18:57] through the ages
[18:59] on until now
[19:01] the last seal
[19:04] is broken
[19:06] then all the judgments of these evil
[19:08] doers we see down through the edges
[19:12] as these have been breaking
[19:15] until
[19:16] see until now
[19:19] as they have been watching on these
[19:21] seals
[19:23] and and they were presuming at them
[19:26] and presuming at what they were doing
[19:30] see
[19:31] oh my
[19:32] but now
[19:34] at the end of the ages of all the church
[19:38] ages
[19:39] all of these evil dwarves will take
[19:43] their place
[19:45] and head up begin to head up for the
[19:48] tribulation
[19:50] amen hallelujah
[19:52] oh praise god amen yes sir because their
[19:56] soul can't find no place to identify
[19:59] with it can identify with the word
[20:03] coming forth for this age and can't find
[20:06] no place to identify there praise the
[20:08] lord now
[20:10] let me say something here and remember
[20:12] this or write it down
[20:15] with the seals god used brother branham
[20:19] to identify
[20:21] and to give us the entire history
[20:25] and revelation to uncover satan and all
[20:28] of his evil actions and deeds
[20:31] through the ages of time from the garden
[20:35] of eden
[20:36] right to this hour
[20:38] that's what that was doing making known
[20:42] to you
[20:43] what the devil was doing
[20:46] that's what the seals did is that right
[20:49] as i told you the seals really speak of
[20:51] the past
[20:53] right if you go back and look at all the
[20:55] scenes it's only when you get to the
[20:56] semester don't say nothing
[20:58] you read the same seal you don't read
[21:00] nothing there he's gone into another
[21:02] dimension but all the rest of it is
[21:04] telling you of the past
[21:06] amen and the brothers that study that to
[21:09] death and can outline it to you and they
[21:11] have gifts for that purpose and and god
[21:13] bless them because that's their purpose
[21:15] they can outline all those dispensations
[21:19] and ages and stuff like that and weeks
[21:21] and feasts of weeks and so on they can
[21:24] outline that it's right there amen but
[21:27] these seals
[21:29] amen
[21:30] are all of the evil doers of the seven
[21:33] seals
[21:35] and all their workings
[21:37] working mysteriously
[21:40] within the church
[21:42] amen
[21:44] and we will find out in a minute
[21:48] they even worked in the name
[21:51] of the church
[21:53] amen you see so that's what the seals
[21:56] were for is to unveil or uncover the
[22:00] antichrist or anti-war spirit
[22:03] it was there to uncover the evil one the
[22:07] mystery of inequity the trail of the
[22:10] serpent and you have to know the
[22:13] antichrist
[22:14] to be able to recognize the real christ
[22:17] amen hallelujah uh
[22:21] if you only know
[22:22] white you wouldn't know what is black or
[22:25] black then you know what is white that
