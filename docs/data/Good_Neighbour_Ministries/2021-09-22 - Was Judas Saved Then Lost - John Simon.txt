TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good wednesday evening to you all may the lord bless us all together praise his marvelous and wonderful name on sunday last sunday we had such a wonderful time speaking on that marvelous topic amen and my brothers it was just so marvelous how the holy spirit moved in a wonderful and precious way amen and how many many millions around the world not only in north america but around the world many are dying on the doctor's doorstep they're right close to it but refuse to keep pace refuse to take what god offers to them through the doctors and men of science may god bless us all as we look into the word today on a an absolutely different topic for we are speaking uh indirectly on the book of life but we will be touching on the life of judas in the bible was jesus uh saved and later when he sinned was he lost so that is our topic for tonight was judas saved or lost our scripture is found in revelation chapter 3 verse 5. he that overcometh same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels thank god for his for this marvelous bread of life the word of god which if a man eat in faith he will live forever let us pray our gracious father we thank you for this thy word and as we enter into the spirit of the word we pray in the name of jesus christ are risen lord that you will gather us together in oneness no matter how physically far apart we may be when may we be gathered together by the pull of the holy spirit and under the anointing of the word that you may use this opportunity as we sit beneath the tree of life that your voice will come speaking to us through the leaves may you receive all praise all glory all worship we bow down before you we worship you we adore you and magnify you be thou glorified we pray in jesus name amen praise god hallelujah now in the book of john 6 i would like to read a scripture here amen and in this we read all that the father had give given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which had sent me that of all which he had given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seat the son and believe it on him had everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day amen praise god for this marvelous uh reading of his holy word amen praise god hallelujah now in revelation 3 of which we read verse 5 the bible tells us clearly that he that overcome it and i'm reading it right now the same shall be clothed with white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life i will not blot out his name one who overcomes their name will not be removed from the book of life or lamb's book of life they're one and the same the book of course uh is a book with sections but it's the same book the book of life the lamb's book of life is the very same book now because of prevailing thinking which i have heard and you would have heard also of how that there is this teaching and this embedded belief that has been placed into the minds and into the hearts of the people many people that god places the names of those who are born again within the lamb's book of life and it's written down earth's place there at the time of their born-again experience amen and they believe that the name is written at that particular time now of course we recognize that that is not so as we begin or continue this study here there is not one record anywhere in the bible in the word of god that will tell you that god is presently recording names within any book and the reason why that is not found like that is because the names were already placed within that book before the foundation of the world hallelujah for god doesn't have to wait to know your act your intention no matter how century many centuries or millennials their passes god is the great i am he's ever present so he knows all he sees all he's aware of all he knows what we would do before we do it he knows what decisions actions we will take before we take them so he doesn't have to wait for your age your time your day that moment to come for you to actually do say or act on something before he he actually like just like a man says oh i've seen him done it so now i'm going to write his name within the book no we're talking about the almighty god who knows all who sees all and your name was already written in the book of life before the foundations of the world amen now when we go down the road of thinking along the old song i always uh refer to my own congregation there's a new name written down in glory and it's mine oh yes it's mine oh that is one of the songs that we sang and maybe is still being sung by many in the various organizations and churches out there that they were a new name now being written in god's book but when you do that you automatically uh magically are introducing the thought that there are two groups of people one group whose name they're written in the book and another group whose names have been refused and not and their names are not placed within the book whatsoever so we we find that the scriptures we will find from the scriptures that such a thing is not true for there are many multitudes that will come into god's kingdom and receive eternal life that never were born again on earth or did any repenting whatsoever on earth but yet will be introduced into eternal life by the hand of god secondly there is a group of people another group of people whose names were on the lamb's book of life before the foundations of the world and such a ones whom the bible calls god's elect under no circumstances can their names be removed from off of the lamb's book of life amen hallelujah oh there's another group whose names were on that great divine record before the foundation of the world but their names will be removed from off of the lamb's book of life now to reemphasize there is no basis for any claim to think that the book of life and the lamb's book of life are different books it's the same book book of life the lamb's book of life it also may be called in the scripture christ's book it might be called my friends the book of the living it might even be called the book but it's all the same book within that book there may be sections or different groups of people coming in but they are all they're recorded in that book oh yes and some as we have just stated that are elected by god before the foundation of the world under no circumstances whatsoever can their names be removed from off of god's holy record uh that he has uh take given or written or recorded now my friends we see it here as we read from revelation chapter 3 13 verse 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him the beast whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world amen yes sir so their names not written in the lamb's book of life slain from the foundation of the world revelation 17 8 the beast that thou sawest and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when the beast saw when they behold the beast that was an is not and yet is and again another reading revelation 20 12-15 and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of all those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and a hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not written found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire you can see my friends that the other books are mentioned this one book the book of life or the lamb's book of life is mentioned here as the record that god has amen praise god now you say well brother simon um where is that book located is it in some monastery somewhere is it a secret record kept by an illustrious person upon the earth uh is it kept uh some ins by some secret order with the names on it absolutely not for the bible tells us from luke 10 17-24 and the 70 returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject to us through thy name and he said unto them i be held satan fall from heaven light lightning behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you not with standing in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rejoice rather because your names are written in heaven so the book is located in heaven hallelujah and in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and of earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered me of my father no man know it who is the son the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son would reveal him so the book of life is definitely located in heaven and it will appear at the white throne judgment where the earth will be judged all sinners will be judged as the bible tells us judged every man judged according to his works what are your works what does your actions say what does your lifestyle say the bible tells us you will be judged by your works therefore let us search ourselves search our actions watch how we act what we do and how we live so that when the where we're referred back into the book he will know you by your works let us look my friends and see what god has for us amen in this verse that we just read jesus told them jesus told them your names were written in heaven hallelujah they were written in the book of life hallelujah because that's where the names are placed amen that's where it was verse 17 of john 6 jesus speaking to the 70. amen and also in verse 23 he spoke to his 12 disciples they had been rejoicing come back from a revival meeting and they were casting out devils and healing the sick and having great success and great blessing you know rejoicing like that i believe a lot of churches would rejoice in that a lot of groups and organizations will rejoice in that and yes we should rejoice in that but jesus is saying uh the the thing you really should rejoice in not that you the sick are healed or devils are cast out but rejoice that your names are written in heaven but in other words that is your blessed assurance your name is already written there on the page bright and fair in the book of his kingdom your name is already written there and now my friends what a great blessed assurance that to know that our names are written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world glory to god hallelujah amen you will notice that when jesus spoke to the 70 and when he said your names rejoice that your name your names are written or recorded in the heavens that judas was amongst them was jesus saved or was he lost many assumed that judas was saved because he was a part of jesus's church or congregation or group and he believed and went along with everything that jesus did later on we read in the holy scriptures how that judas was the guide to them that came to capture jesus he had sold him for 30 pieces of silva like many of you are doing to our lord today selling him out for not just 30 pieces of silver but now it's 30 000. now it's 30 million but the same principle action and attitude selling out our lord for for drink or money or woman or for fame or for fortune or position or popularity they're selling out the word selling out the lord selling out their faith selling out their belief and laying it down just like that judas was amongst them they were casting out devils and he was casting out devils they were praying for the sick he was praying for the sick also amen in john chapter 6 verses 70 to 71 jesus said have not i chosen you twelve listen have not i chosen you twelve and one of you that he just said i chose you twelve but one of you is a devil amen yes sir he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that would betray him being one of the twelve john 17 12 while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name thou those that thou gave us me i have kept and none of them is lost but this son of perdition that son of the devil son of perdition son of hell yes that the scriptures might be fulfilled and again in john chapter 13 verses 10 to 11 and verse 18. jesus said to him he he that is washed needed not safe to wash his feet but is clean every wit and you are clean but not all i speak not of you all for but and i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture might be fulfilled he that eat that bread with me had lifted up his heel against me yes my friends judas was chosen by jesus we all should admit that for it's written in your bible in the scriptures he was given to jesus by the father chosen by jesus himself and jesus testified that his name was recorded in heaven judas's name was recorded in heaven does that mean he was saved no it does not but here it says his name was recorded in heaven now let me uh pause here for a moment if you will write this scripture down go read it sometime first kings chapter 22 verses 20 to 23. in these verses within this chapter you will find the story or the record of how god sitting on his throne the prophet uh michaela speaking of how god sitting on his throne and in a vision he saw a lying spirit come up before the lord and ask god choose me give me permission to go down to be a lying spirit in the mouth of ahab's prophets and i will entice them and i will lie in their through their mouths and the bible tells us that god permitted him or chose him to go for that job there upon the earth and that lying spirit came down to the earth went into the 400 prophets of uh baal which were prophets of ahab and used their lips their mouths their thoughts to tell religious lies i believe that's repeating again that those same lying spirits have returned to earth again and they're they're dropping an anointing and using a lot of preachers to tell religious lies enticing spirits operating in the religious realm on the religious covering hiding behind the veil of christianity to lie and cheat and steal commit adultery fornications to to commit all manner unspeakable crimes in the name of christ they use his name in vain and do these things that are unspeakable that are not to be even talked about but it is there for everyone to hear and know about yes my friends judas was chosen but he was not saved he was not born again his name was written or recorded in the heavens but yet he was not part of god's elect certainly his name being on the book of life for he is a living creature a living being living person so he's in that book of life within the lamb's book of life as we have read he was a son of perdition but the bible tells us he was given by the father chosen by jesus name recorded in the heavens and yet he was lost yet he was he was a son of the devil he was a hell-bound creature posing acting and speaking and doing while in jesus's congregation while in jesus's church while claiming christian christ he was operating under that guise but it was nothing but a chosen and permitted devil that had to come to the earth to be the accuser to be the one that will sell out the word oh my friends jesus the scripture says that the scriptures might be fulfilled hallelujah amen so there are such ones upon the earth at this time who knows if i have any within my church or group maybe i do maybe i don't i don't know that's for god to say but here we find my friends judas was in jesus's church so why would my church or my little group uh be you know so special that it would have none i don't know of that but i must look to the word the word is showing us and telling us what god is saying here within his word amen now very similar to pharaoh from the book of exodus the bible tells us clearly that pharaoh was chosen he was chosen but his name was not in the book of life let me repeat pharaoh was also chosen by god but his name was not recorded in the book of life now i want you to see here my friends that the choosing doesn't mean like the election of the bride of christ or the believer it's similar to the lying spirit that went up before god and had the job to come and lie on the earth and god permitted him to come on the earth as a liar to come on the earth as an enticer a tempter an accuser god permitted that spirit that anointed judas to come up on the earth get in him and to steal and to lie and to cheat and to sell out jesus but at the same time he was performing miracles you read many stories of such situation men claiming to be men of god committing all matter of whoredoms all manner of drunkenness rivalry all manner of uh bigamy all of every unspeakable crime and evil that you could think about oh my friends the spirit of judas is still prevalent in the world today it's only that that is not here in the person of judas the man walking around and jesus is not here in the person of christ as the man jesus walking around but jesus is here in the form of the word of god being revealed to you and judah's spirit is here as a supplanter of the word of god yes judas was also chosen and his name was recorded in heaven but the bible tells us his name was blotted out or removed from heaven he was never saved to begin with he was always lost to begin with it's just that for that job his name was recorded and he had to come to earth and do the job that he did separately and differently his experience and his walk is far removed from that of the elect bride of jesus christ for if one is a part of that bride it means you were also chosen by god but you were chosen with a different uh purpose for in every house there are various vessels some to honor some to dishonor amen and here uh this group of people elected before the foundation of the world their names recorded in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world to do what to love him to serve him that there will be on the people on the earth to worship him to never deny him to never walk away from him never to sell him out but to stand by the word of god all the time amen and hold to his unchanging hand and as we were elected and i believe that i am part of that i believe it in the depths of my heart elected to carry out god's plan and god's eternal purposes here on the earth and thank god we were chosen but we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world hallelujah in other words when jesus the word came forth we were already in him so we were part of the word that judas was going to plot against that judas was going to sell out even you will be sold out yes plotted against sold out evil spoken of oh a false witness is born against him but yet oh jesus was god expressed on the earth and now we were in him from before the foundation of the world as paul said ephesians in the book of ephesians we were chosen in him praise god and our names in that lamb's book of life as the prophet of this 20th century said who their names under no circumstances can their names be removed from out of that book oh praise god hallelujah what a blessing to know that our names are in the book and that our names can never be removed from that book amen hallelujah think of it what kind of destructive religious influence was upon judas that he would be the way even though he would heal the sick cast out devils religious go to church hear every sermon that jesus preached and never rep repent of his sins never was able to give his life to christ because the seed in him amen was not of god to begin with that seed in him was sent down here for a for a different purpose it was a vessel of dishonor my friend oh and so as the scripture says uh the apostle said he was numbered with us and obtained a part of this ministry in other words when judas was in jesus church he had a genuine walk he had a part of the genuine ministry anointing upon him and he was numbered with them hallelujah oh my and the part that he had was not inferior to the others it's just what he did with it it is motive of what he did with it amen acts 1 25 that he may take part of this ministry and the apostleship oh being called an apostle or a being a preacher does not make one immune because those devils are looking in every way to influence any man that claims the name of christ amen that he may take part of this ministry an apostleship from which judas by transgression fell fell from heaven fell to earth fell to the earth and fell from the earth into hell but the bible tells us by transgression fell that he might go to his own place amen whoa he went to his own place because in the body of christ there was no place found for him he could not fit in any part of that body and so he had to go to his own place judas was a devil and he was lost he was never born again never a son of god but a son of perdition yes he had a real god-given anointed ministry upon him like many ministers today amen we will speak on that uh at another time of how the rain falls on the weeds as well as on the the good grain of wheat so the rainfall doesn't change the nature of the of the weed it remains a weed and so there are many preachers out there many with the anointing of the holy ghost gifts of the spirit and yet a devil and lost and held bound and my friends and have their own place reserved for them yes sir you know judas killed himself he committed suicide and went to his own place and his name was even in the book of life his name was even in the book of life but the scriptures record but his name was blotted out here ends our study for tonight may the lord take these few words of truth and plant them place them within your heart and raise a flag of victory and salvation that you will commit your life to christ that your works may be seen recorded in heaven and that god will recognize you that you were chosen in him come to him now speak to him from the depths of your heart ask god to forgive you cleanse you wash you in his precious cleansing blood and seek out one that will baptize you correctly in the name of jesus christ not in not in vague titles such as father son and holy ghost for their titles it's in the bible in one name the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost one name and so here we go my friends that that name peter said in acts 2 38 is the name of jesus christ which is correct scriptural christian baptism may god bless you may god save you baptize you and may we be able to welcome you into the kingdom of almighty god but without our dogs hormones witchcraft workers liars and blasphemers coffers mockers and those who my friends will make fun of the people of god and the things of god while we stand looking for his re return and holding to his unchanging hand may god bless those of you who are who believe and whose names are written in the heavens chosen in him may god bless you and keep you will come again on sunday again pray for me that god will send to us another message that will speak to our hearts and change us and get us pressurized and ready for our trip into glory god bless you amen [Music] you
