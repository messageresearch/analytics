morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I welcome all of our guests all of our friends praise God um I know that uh We've we've had a a new believer that's joined us here um sister K praise God is she here with us this morning praise God God bless you Sister I believe I believe um you know she's got a very short testimony for us come sister I'm going to give you the microphone yeah and I just want her to share just a quick testimony of how she she came here um at Good Neighbor Ministries check one two check perfect praise God God bless you Saint I'm casine actually I came from Kenya I'm new here in barington and as he said my testimony I can say it's amazing how I found this church it's by God's grace I live nearby I was passing to go in this shopping center near here so as I was passing I saw the bellboard actually to me it wasn't a message believer church but it was a church so CU I decided now I have stayed in the house for long without going to Church in fact I have been attending a online service from my country all through like four five months since I came here and now I thank the Lord talk to me and told me what if you have a Ministry in you which is supposed to help the church what will you do if you you will continue fellowshipping in the online so I heard oh God this is not me I have to look for the church when I went in the Google The Google didn't show me this church in fact I I could say the scao and Bramton and it was very far for me so I told God you know what I'll go to the nearby church that's where you will bless me from CA even the prophet said uh if you go to the church it's not that must be a message believer's church but whever is preached there take the meat leave the bones so that's why I told my God you know what this church near me it's where I am going and in fact I W up in the morning I prepared my myself I came here the song leader somehow mentioned prophet he didn't mention the name of the Prophet but he mentioned Prophet I was like H what is this and now when the preacher came mentioned Propet Branham I told myself oh my God this is where I belong so Lord you have le me finally to where I belong and so now I decided I'll be fellowshipping here all through time actually I'm working like every other weekend but every weekend which I'll not be fellowshipping I'll be coming here and I will Avail myself on each and every Wednesday I'll be coming may God bless you so much praise God amen amen amen amen now is the Lord Lord adding to the church who adds to the church the Lord does who leads and guides his children they shall be led by the spirit of God Amen I love that that that uh thought that she that she mentioned that how can if God has placed a gift in me how am I supposed to allow that gift to operate to edify the body of Jesus Christ unless I assemble myself there's a sermon right there Saints we could all go home right now and be blessed amen thank you sister wonderful testimony praise God um we are very grateful do we have any other visitors here today amen and uh your name my brother brother Aaron okay and um are you from the area or oh wow okay okay let's get a microphone real real quick and then we'll we'll catch that because I believe this is important praise God I'm not used to speak to microphone be with me yeah so I was saying that um in the beginning of this year I was praying God to lead me to which church to go pray I went to Google just searching churches I churches I also listen to the preachings so I was not really convinced I kept on praying praying praying and one day I found this Church online it was in uh beginning of February now I started it was Pastor Danny I started like to listen to the preaching I was like oh this is what I'm looking for then I will be listening to the preaching all the week on Wednesday I started to listen I was like okay the more I was listening the more I was convinced till uh last Sunday I was like okay let me just go see how the chatties like because when you you stream they they do not show all this right I was like okay let me just go and see and when I came here I was like okay this is this is my my place and definitely uh I'll be coming here to fellowship with amen praise God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus glory to God and so we Rejoice knowing that um that the spirit of God is moving on the hearts of the people drawing his sons and daughters to the word they need to be attracted to the word it's the word that attracts the true Sons and Daughters of God that are interested in Christ amen praise God and so um we can see that uh the father's business is still very operational very active amen and we're very grateful for that glory to God and so um let's all stand we're going to go to the word of God here today we're going to continue where we left off last Sunday amen talking about the father's business I believe that this there's no greater business than that you could ever be a part of that you could be employed by that you could be in partnership with amen praise God let us pray father we're so grateful this morning Lord we're grateful for these testimonies of your spirit moving and calling and and adding Lord as you would see fit father to the ministry to the body of Jesus Christ Lord we're so grateful father we're asking now that you would come and fellowship with us by the word of God this morning as we Minister your word Lord we just yield ourselves take the vessel and speak to the needs of your people Lord and may there be faith in their hearts Lord to draw and to pull upon your anointing your spirit and your gift that you have placed in our midst father we give you thanks and we give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name amen praise God and so let's read our scripture same scripture that we're reading in St Luke chapter 2 verse 49 and he said unto them how is it that that ye sought me wish ye not that I must be about my father's business amen God bless you you may be seated you know we read last week um we we were looking whoops computer decides to do a reboot right in the midst all right well any anyways um we will um correct this problem here in a moment but um we were talking last week and we we were looking at the scriptures and one of the scriptures that we looked at was Revelations 10 8- 11 and we realize that that that's that's the ministry that God has given us God has placed a Ministry in us to be Witnesses and to prophesy to take the word that was delivered unto us in our day amen to take the word that God uh provided for us in this day and in this hour and for us to take that word to feed on that word uh eat the word it's going to be sweet in our mouths because we're going to realize that my God this is the Living God this is the Living Word this is the word of God this is not just a religion uh I I didn't just come into contact with with uh some other you know Christian church but I've actually come into contact with the Living God Amen and now the Living God wants to use me wants to speak through me wants to anoint my life so that I can be a witness he said that you would be Witnesses in uh throughout all of the earth and that you would carry a witness of the word remember we're not Witnesses of doctrines we're not interested in in in enforcing Doctrine unto people this word that God has given us has got nothing to do with doctrines although there are many doctrines in the word but it has to do with the Living Word coming into our lives and fulfilling and manifesting the doctrines it's bringing the doctrines to life amen it's manifesting them before the people so that they can see that the word is a Living Word it's not a man's teaching it's not something that that that we have to uh convince somebody of but it is actually the Living Word that God has placed within our lives amen praise God and so we were looking at that and um uh I'm almost there I'm going to be right back to where I left off here praise God and so that we can uh move quickly and smoothly because I want to I want to be able to to deliver everything that the Lord has placed on my heart this morning and I want to I I'd like to finish this this series okay today part three and it'll be completed today by God's grace and so um let me just get there technology is amazing but sometimes it can be a little frustrating just decided to do a Rebo right then unusual but God knows we all need a reboot every now and then praise God hallelujah amen thank you Jesus praise God we're getting there all right praise the Lord Jesus and so now I want to um I want to read this um quote here that that we ended off with last week the prophecy that calls out the bride the true church for our day there's a prophecy that God has placed within us that calls the true church and we had read this quote these men why why was they called and was put in this condition these Pharisees by Jesus said in vain you worship me you worship him genuine worship true worship from their hearts in vain you worship me why teaching for Doctrine their tradition of man therefore you make the Commandments of God of no effect to the people if I taught you the Methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bride time it's if Moses taught the message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's given for that seed see it won't grow any other condition it must be in the condition that grows it so in other words it's got to be the word and the the revealed word for the day that we're living in because in you there's a seed there's an attribute of God to respond to that word you cannot respond to Luther's message although Luther's message of justification was a part of the word but it wasn't enough to call you you wouldn't you there wasn't enough in Wesley's message to call you that's why while you were in the world you know years ago before you actually came to this Revelation in this message you knew Christianity you had gone to church some of you maybe some didn't at all but you you you knew about the word but you didn't know that you were actually in the word and that there would be a time where there would be water of God's word that would come in its season that would actually awaken you now that's why I couldn't understand I was you know I remember in 1992 and '93 just before the word came and awakened me out of my Amnesia there was many people I had my nephew he was reading the Bible you know he had split up with his wife and he was living in the store upstairs and he'd be reading his Bible every day and while I'm T you know I would say okay you come to the market with me downtown you know and he'd be reading the Bible and he's telling me about the word and tell and I'm just saying oh man bible thumper you know this guy's driving me crazy you know he's my nephew and he needed a place to live live right now so I gave him a place you know and then I had a driver who was a 7 Day ad you know like he was like like Church of God and and he would be constantly telling me about you know uh you need to go to church and you need to go on Saturday and if and all these people you see these people that go to church on Sunday they're all lost he'd be telling me this and he'd be telling me you need to come to church you need to come to my church you know until finally you know like I was listening to my refu and then you know there was some discussions once in a while about you know religion and then you'd hear about the Catholic teaching and then you know and I and you know it was just going on and finally one day I said to my driver you know Carlo he you know he was telling me I said listen enough you know because he'd be talking to the people that were delivering to my truck too you know he was too fanatical I said listen that's enough I said said if God wants me he'll come and talk to me not you and I said that firmly to him and it shut him up but you see we didn't realize that we were around the word and we were hearing the word but it wasn't our time it wasn't our season yet to receive the word and so here brother Braham speaking he says the word must deliver the word bride Church Okay so there's a church in the last days we're in the end time people are talking about the end time you know there's all the churches are going into chaos and and things are happening right now and here we are in the end time but there's a word that's ordained to the word church those that are actually ordained just like in the days of Luther there was a group of people that heard Luther's message and it they responded to it they came out from the Catholic church and the Protestant churches started and and then Wesley was the continuation for sanctification Luther had had justification Wesley had sanctification and then the Pentecostals come along and here we've got the moving of the Holy Spirit the gifts of God manifesting speaking in tongues healing manifestations and so forth and that was another Revival but that was not the one that you were going to be called out under you had a messenger come in the 20th century which would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and there was a scripture ordained for your day that's why Malachi 4 says I send unto you that's right you personally amen not to your church not to your organization not to your priest not to your friends and family but to you personal amen and so the church has got to be delivered out of her abro died for Christ so in other words now you've got all these churches all these different denominations and Christ is on the scene now calling out from all of those churches those that will recognize the word for their day now some observations I was listening you know to the message last night this morning recognizing your day and its message and the Lord just laid these thoughts on my heart this morning just before I was you know going to get ready to come to church and I put them all down and I thought okay praise God I was listening to the message and it struck me and brother Braham says this has been the now if you go back and listen to recognize your day and its message okay in uh 1965 I believe it is 64 okay he says this has been the hardest message that I've had to put together and I'm I'm just listening to his opening comments before he actually gets into everything he said the devil was fighting me he says he was fighting him you know to to to to bring that message and but notice the scripture that he took okay now you go back and you think okay well recognizing your day and its message and we know what that all means but look at the scripture that he took he took the scripture from Hosea chapter 6 and he said says come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight and if you go on he goes on and he reads all of that and you wonder you know if you if you go back and you actually think about it you think well that's an unusual scripture for recognizing your day and it's message but you know as I was listening to him when you get you know like as you go on brother brandham talks about Israel these are all in his opening comments he wanted to draw our attention to the time and I thought oh that's interesting aren't we in an interesting time right now she is the time piece he says he wanted the audience to realize and recognize the time he says that the time that we're living in here listen to what he says here he says we are dealing today upon a Sunday school lesson that I want you to realize and recognize the time that we're living we're just about to run out and I thought boy are we ever that much closer to running out this is back in 1964 as you see and then by this you should know the very hour and time and sign and message that you are to receive do you hear that you need to recognize that there's a message that's got to go to the church I'm not talking about just this church there's people online that are hearing this that are listening in on this message that that need to know that there 's a message that is going out to the church world and they need to know that this message is the message for today for this hour amen he goes on here he says brother brandham he starts talking about now if you listen you go back and listen he starts talking about the signs in the Moon and the Sun and how you know he says and the positions of the nations of that particular time and I thought wow Lord look at this look at the positions of the Nations right now right now today here we are in the midst of a world that's in in in global war there's Global chaos and the the the the nations are in in all kinds of different positions right now that are setting up to fulfill absolutely the word of God and the prophecy for this hour he talks about how the hierarchy of Rome left and went back to to Palestine well that to me just says that they're going back to Palestine in other words they're supporting Palestine they're they're they're they're they're bringing now listen of course we are human and we feel the emotional uh disturbance and and the burden of the of the people that are being killed and you know war is a terrible thing there's always the casualties that come as a result of war and many times it's innocent women innocent children innocent people we know that and it's terrible but here we also know that the scripture is very clear and that we know that Israel is God's time piece God's chosen people God's way of of communicating to the world the time and the season that we are presently living in and it's important and he talks about only the only light that was left when he was talking about the moon moon and the and the sun was was the minority Church would have a certain amount of light and it's a small light we're a small group people think we're kind of strange they think we're fanatical about the word of God but there always were individuals in every dispensation in every time in every book of the Old Testament God had Witnesses God had individuals God had had prophets that were anointed by the word of God in their particular day to bring forth God's voice God's mind God's desires for the world and for the for the world at that time and the conditions of the people it was God coming with his Mercy to speak to the needs of the people and here today there's a minority there's a small light he said it would be a very small light of truth that would be revealed he talked about the mysterious Cloud which was the mighty Angel we know coming down in 1963 to open the mysteries of the Seven Seals and how those seals were open and all the mysteries of God have been released and you are one of those Mysteries you are one of those individuals that were called under that anointed word of God that was brought forth you didn't realize what was going to call you you didn't know you know like Tim says he was at the altar there in the Catholic church and he and he heard a voice say you won't find me here you didn't realize that God was was actually a living God but he was somewhere you needed to find out where his provided place was you need it wasn't it's not in a church it's not in a building it's in the body of Christ amen it's when you come personal and you meet God lip to ear and he speaks to you and he calls you he delivers you from your circumstances nobody's going to tell me that God is not a living God and a real God if you've witnessed and you've experienced him you know what I'm talking about how the Lord has been calling a gentile bride he says here he talked about the seven sabbaths and now after the seven sabbaths would come the day of atonement listen here he's speaking here in same message recognizing your day and its message now we noticed last Sunday there there was preaching the feast days that there was a feast of Pentecost and between the Feast of Pentecost and the Feast of trumpets that was a long period of time exactly 50 days between Pentecost and the Feast of trumpets and 50 days which Pentecost means 50 it was sheath waving or the ingat the first fruits of the Harvest was brought in in and we see it was in tyght back there with the natural first fruits representing first fruits of the Holy Spirit to be poured out upon the people that's why we are we we experienced Pentecost when you came to this Revelation your experience was what God was doing which was Pentecost which was God calling out a gentile church out of the Gentile Nations and so receiving Pentecost means you receive the Holy Ghost you receive the Holy Ghost which is the word of God in your day so you receive the word that's what came to you that's what we're talking about here all right God God now watch and we find out then that them 50 days was received by the Gentiles which God called from the Gentiles a people for his name that's why the church is a woman and she is the bride the wife of Christ the Feast of Pentecost and we have been going through that long Feast of Pentecost now actually from the 50 days would be exactly seven sabbaths okay and seven sabbaths represent the seven Church ages that we've come through to the to to be called in the time of the Pentecostal Feast of Pentecost to call a people from the Gentiles for his name so we are the church that's being called for his name now at the end of these seven sabbaths and this is what caught my attention which has been there was to be a day of atonement which was the seven trumpets and the Seven trumpets was to call a day of mour back for or the sacrifice or the atonement and we find out then that Israel the seven trumpets pertained only to Israel and it's a time of atonement a time of mourning Israel is going to receive this message which is Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry in this day and it's going to bring them into the season of The Feast of atonement and mourning that they actually crucified their Messiah they're going to be awakened and how close are we to that now why is this all coming out in such a way and and being expressed and and and here we are in the condition in the world and Israel and the situation that it's under and how it's under attack and how everything is coming together perfectly so so that Israel will come to their day of atonement but the bride of Christ before all of that takes place she goes in a Rapture and so for us I only lay this in here as a background to bring us into a clearer understanding of the day that we're living in so that we can recognize now what it is that God is doing for us now here let's move on there was three stages uh to it as I said the Mar's age of the Martyr and then the stage of the reformers and now the calling out time he's talking about from the time of Pentecost all the way up to where we are now okay there was the time of the mar the Dark Ages many had to die for this gospel oh there was many Martyrs those that had to stand on the word of God but the but the you know but the enemy would destroy he would try and destroy the Holy Spirit you could never destroy the Holy Spirit in the people you could destroy the people but the spirit of God is eternal it would move on that's why there's it's not you that's coming under uh you know sometimes you're under oppression you come under the the the reproach for the word of God and people call you fanatical you're you're a little too fanatical about God it's okay they don't realize that it's not you it's the spirit of God that you've received in you that's going to stand on the word it's going to it's it's the it's the the witness that God is a just God God is not going to judge based on which church you went to God is going to judge you according to his word his word is a Living Word it's not a word that can be changed he's the same yesterday today and forever H amen and so here we are and then the stage of the reformers and now the calling out time when finished at leod Dean age according to Revelations 10 the mystery of all the Bible would be known to the bride is that right Revelations 10 now listen close uh-huh bride called called out by the word that's why you're never going to hear me coming up with you know or any real minister of God coming up with their own ideas they're just going to tell you what the word says they're just going to tell you exactly what the because it's the word that's going to call you out it's simple baptism in Jesus name you look into the scripture acts 238 it's right there it's plain as repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then you read on and and it said 3,000 were added to the church that day and they were baptized that way way Peter was right there he was the one that that that cried out to them be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins he was there when Jesus said go in ye into all the world because you know preachers will go back and they'll say to you know they'll say to me yeah but you got to read Matthew 28:19 I go yeah I read it Jesus says go ye on into all the world baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost and Peter was right there the same one that was on the day of Pentecost was right there so why is it that Peter when on the day of Pentecost said in the name of Jesus Christ because Jesus said the name of the father he said to Philip if you seen me you've seen the father so what's the father's name the Earthly name was Jesus Christ amen in all that you do in the name do it all in the name of Jesus Christ you see it's simple to the to to the to the true church you can't deny that you you can't believe Trinity Trinity is not in your vocabulary there's no such thing the Lord thy God is one you see me you see the father Jesus made it very clear I and the father are one he never said to praise God anyway so here it is the Bible would be known to the bride is that right all the Mysteries would be made known and and the bride bride she'd be called out by the word Christ himself calling out the bride the church making plain Hebrews 138 that he's the same yesterday today and forever does the same and is the same I'm going to repeat that he does the same and he is the same don't be putting your own interpretation on the word of God it's of no private interpretation listen here he goes on to say here in in the visible Union of the Bride he says but you remember when it went down and the grain begin to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stock has to be dead in other words all the the all the teachings all the doctrines all the things that you thought were the truth even though you were in a church remember a church is like a like a like a stock of corn every you know that corn that grain is going up through the stock and it's a carrier of the seed of the true word of the absolute perfect word of God and the church was carrying the seed but the but the church stock was not the seed it died and fell away and you can't bring any of that any of your own teachings any of your own doctrines any of your own ideas you can't bring that into the body of Christ you've got a let all of that die that's why you must be born again you cannot be born again when you want to hold on to an old life you got to let that old life go completely and then the spirit of God is the new life that comes in you by the Holy Ghost and then when you look at the word you read the word you can only say Amen to the word let my word be truth and every man's word I don't care if he's a priest if he's a theologian he's got 27 llds if he says Trinity he's deceived and he is not of God Amen it's as simple as that if he gets the new birth he can become born again and the spirit of God will replace his own Spirit his own doctrines his own ideas and and it'll it'll only say what the word says amen praise God and so Hallelujah you can't can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again Christ is in the word seed word again and the church is a is an isolated segregated group of individuals that are filled with the Holy Ghost and they will not deny the word of God Amen life is in the grain what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground that same Jesus in Bride form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here and all the life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the Rapture hallelujah praise God all that the father hath given me will come that's right not one of them is going to be plucked out of my hand Jesus said my sheep hear my voice they're not going to follow any other voice amen praise God now here he says in Christ The Mystery of God revealed now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride so now it's Christ remember it's always been Christ from Genesis remember the faith of the fathers it's always been Jesus Christ it's been Elohim the self-existent one in the in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God it's always been Christ coming down through the Old Testament in in mzc who do you think mzc was MDC was Jesus Christ in the form of a man that he he he came and visited Abraham it was still the same God the Lord God it was Jes Jesus Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament amen praise God and so he says here it's the same coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at first in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last days he promised this in the last days now if you're spiritual you'll catch it you see what he's saying you need to put on your spiritual thinking cap and and take away all your own ideas all your own doctrines all your own teachings forget about listen oh but my Ministry is a big Ministry it's a worldwide Ministry you're trying to tell me that that you know this ministry that's got you know he had 400,000 views on his on his web on on his YouTube channel he's also got a crew of social media experts that are advertising and using Google and advertising and every time you go to this site It'll point back to his then it goes back to that and they'll share their links they'll put out the listen YouTube channels all that stuff you go there and you start looking oh I only had 25 views oh I only had 50 I don't care if I get three views as long as one of them's the a son or a daughter of God he'll change everybody's life it's not about views it's about receiving the spirit of God to recognize your day and the message that you need to hear but I got a big church I got thousands of Believers I got 20,000 people that'll that'll assemble on Sunday what do you got I don't know 100 what's the difference when Jesus was on Earth he had a dozen followers and the rest of them were saying he was a freak he was he was be above they would call him a devil what's the difference we're not looking for that we're looking for the word have you heard the word for your day have you re recognize what God is doing that can change and transform your life now right now not some not some you know great uh positive mental attitude yeah I believe in positive attitude I believe in in speaking positive I believe all those things that you should speak positive and have those things but if all you preach is positive and positive and Jesus is positive and even in your sin Jesus is positive that you you need to hear that you need deliverance from your unbelief cuz sin is unbelief drinking smoking lying cheating committing adultery all those things it's just unbelief in the word of God oh I can't come to your church because I got too much sin no you need to come into the house of the Lord where the word of God will cleanse you and Purge you of your sin hallelujah it's not about numbers here he says the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space Time and Eternity he could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin and that you went beyond the cycles of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and on out into Infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is but he wanted but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and that's why we've come to know the father and that's why we've come into the father's business and that's why we will only speak and teach and preach about the father's business that's what we're interested in every business has something that it's selling that it's offering whether it's a message or they're selling or promoting some kind of a product you know the definition of a business is an Enterprise that exists to promote a product or me message in business terminology the product is this thing that you offer to satisfy the consumers needs there's a lot of consumers out there today there may even be some in here today that need something to meet their need they don't need just a preaching they don't need just a you know pat on the back and join the church and put your name on the roster they need a a a a a holy ghost uh Revival and and Supernatural meeting with God on your knees where you stay there until God comes and delivers you from the thing that you are in bondage over because many of us find ourselves in bondage in some way shape or form but you need the Living God Amen listen it can be a tangible thing that you're that you know that you're promoting like you know people promote automobiles they promote you know technology and everything else it can also be you know intangible things like you know insurance they sell car insurance they sh they sell life insurance we don't sell it we promote eternal life Assurance that's what we promote but there's no price for that you just need to receive Jesus Christ you just need to receive the word for your day and for your hour amen praise God you know if we were try to accurately describe the church's products you know some might say that the church's products are the sermons that are preached the songs that are sung you know the prayers that are prayed that are prayed the specific doctrines that we emphasize we don't emphasize Doctrine here we emphasize the word the word will get in you and fulfill Doctrine according to the word it's as simple as that each one of these features has a benefit with it you know it's got good feelings you know you come in and you say oh boy that brother you know Pastor Danny ministered a good feel message today you need more than a good feel message you need something that's going to change your life amen that's going to change your circumstances amen it's going to it's going to give you some life lessons it's going to to deliver you from certain control that that that the enemy in this world chains of circumstance may be holding you down in certain ways and certain areas you can be free today by the word of God amen hallelujah it's good that we've clarified these things but the main question remains to be answered what is the message that's being promoted in this house it's the father's business amen it's the father's business it's about relationships amen it's about the the the the message of this hour that's that's the father's business amen praise God what is it that the church makes available to fill people's needs it's all summarized under one thing the word of God that's the only thing that will satisfy because the word has an answer for every situation in your life there's an answer for every question in your heart Thank You Lord let's go to slide number three Colossians even Colossians 1:26-27 even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles listen if there's a mystery Saints don't be looking for all kinds of mysteries don't be looking to to you know oh it's it's a treasure that's hidden in in this certain place you know there's people that are still looking for the cup that Jesus drank from the Shroud the nails they've got some somewhere I don't know if they've got them somewhere in in the Vatican they've got and they and and they make it something they it's it you know what you'll be there and it'll be a total mystery until you die because the mystery is not the nails the mystery is where the nail Prince went and what the nail Prince represented and what it represented is right here amongst the Gentile which is Christ in you the hope of glory he went to the cross and shed his blood was nailed to the cross so that the spirit of God the Holy Ghost could come back on you in your your day your day don't be looking back there and people are always praising God for what he did back there yes he went to the Cross but it was a finished work from before the foundations of the world what are you going to do with that you see it happened before you were even born it happened before it actually happened here on the earth because he was slain from before the foundations of the world you see how theologians and everything they need to read the word word they need to recognize and see the revelation of the meaning behind Christ in you your hope of glory listen to brother brand he says here he says God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in the church in his church the he says um you know uh it's about relationships here okay this you and Christ it's about relationships and now we want to look at you know um the the mission of the church what is the mission what is your mission our our purpose statement says to bring people to Christ so that they can fulfill their purpose in the body of Christ and like the sister Kon said when she said if God is placed a gift in me then I've got to I've got to join that body even if that gift is invisible even if it's one that's that's like you know you've got you've got you know you've got a pancreas that controls the sugar in your in your in your system and if that pancreas is not properly cared for and it's and it and it gets out of order then all kinds of sugar levels start to spike and what what happens is you get diabetes and all of a sudden your body gets you know uh diseased and there's problems well well God has Parts in the body of Christ that need to be here am that of this local body they were ordained to be here from before the foundations of the world Amen oh I don't need to go to a church I don't need to beong I can just listen to the tapes just press play and Obey how's that going to edify the body of Jesus Christ amen no you need to be a part of that body you need to assemble yourself even more so as that day approaches why because he's fulfilling the final stage of the Rapture and everyone must get into their position whether they're believer make believer or unbeliever it all works together but in the mystical Body of Christ that goes in the Rapture it's only attributes of God and there is no way you are going to keep an attribute of God at home listening to tapes no way there's just no way think about it you're G to you're going to miss out on the supernatural element of the preaching of the word where he can come and speak to your personal need right here speak to this situation deal with that healing heal you here and and deliver you there and give you the wisdom that you need listen God is a living God it's Christ in you Christ in the body he didn't leave back in 65 when brother brandham died that's right no brother brandham himself even said I must decrease so that he can increase John the Baptist said I must decrease so that he can increase he came into his public Ministry he came and progressed into the word that he needed to fulfill for this day and we are fulf fulfilling that part now Hallelujah listen let's read Matthew 22 next slide he says here then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying Master which is the great command which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto the him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart there's one and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and now listen to the second one he says is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law of and all the law and the prophets everything is hanging on that that you shall love the Lord your God in other words you got to love the word because remember in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so you got to love the word with all of your heart your mind and your soul you're not going to compromise on the word when somebody comes to you and says hey you need to be baptized properly in the name of the in the name of Jesus Christ not in the name of the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost you they need they need to know the truth Jesus said the truth shall set you free it's simple these are all just examples okay and so here let's read the next um slide Acts chapter 2 he goes on here and he says now listen this is the church now remember love the Lord thy God and love one another now look at the early church people ask me all the time what do you believe Danny what is it like what is your church like what what what Doctrine what who who's who's your your your mother church or who's the the we don't have we are the book of of Acts continuing we are the Church of Christ is basically a continuation of the book of Acts we're self-sufficient just like they were they went and they preached the word of God in season out of season here they were they devoted themselves to the apostles teachings and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer that's what we do everyone was filled with awe and Many Wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles you know that he's still doing miracles signs and wonders amen he follows his word amen everyone all the Believers were together and had everything in common selling their possessions and goods they gave to everyone as he had need every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere Hearts praising God and enjoying the favor of all all the people and the Lord added to their numbers daily those who were being saved we're still the same church don't you think you need to be pulling people into this church you don't need to be pulling people God will move them right into the area and then God will lead them right by the church amen God will lead them to a to a message online God will lead them somewhere and when they need to hear his voice they're going to hear it he'll do it because he's still the same God Amen Hallelujah we need to pay attention to the manner at which Jesus conducted his Earthly Ministry because we are expressing him amen we're we're we're under the same Ministry Saints Jesus listen he he was a master at building relationships with people he could he he could he could share his gift with whomever he wanted the gift of salvation but he did it by relationship he did it by calling their names he did it by by by uh uh recognizing who they were and them recognizing who he was it was a real relationship amen but what happens listen Jesus never invited people to church meetings he simply built relationships with people and use those relationships as platforms from which to talk about the kingdom of God Amen about the father's business and that's what we need to recognize and and keep it simple but what happens is we get too caught up in our own business we get distracted and it keeps us from being about the father's business you know we've heard many times mind your own business business everybody said that you know my you you'll even hear it sometimes you know you you'll want to interject a little bit about well you know you hear this person having a problem and you know they've got somebody at home that's sick and you kind of get in there and you say Hey you know I'm I'm a Christian and and and I can pray for your brother or your sister or your mother and they turn around and say listen mind your own business well that is my business but okay I'll mind my own business you see if you're not a Christian then you're not obligated to involve yourself in God's business it's as simple as that so so if somebody doesn't want to be involved in God's business in the father's business you can't force them first of all God has to call them all you can do is create the atmosphere around them speak about the word of God let yourself be a witness and let God do the rest Hallelujah you know but here we are and I'm just you know bringing this analogy here according to the culture you're ex you're you're expected to mind your own business and to deal with your own life you through close family ties and really good friends will likely be invited to be a part of some other business and be caught up with the cares of this life but that's the problem it's this life but we're talking about eternal life we're talking talking about the father's business and the true benefits come from the father's business for it has Eternal benefits too many Christians are more concerned about their own business than they are God's business they make time for all the things that they want to do and squeeze a little bit of time in for God why because they're minding their own business as a first priority and God's business as a leftover most Christians do not give sacrificially to the Lord's work but often find time and the money for special events and big sales at Walmart they're minding their own business as a first priority and God's business as a leftover you need to know that God is not happy with leftovers he wants all of you if he calls you give him all give him your best give him what he deserves amen God has an expectation that his children will be about his business once they are called amen praise God we don't look for excuses we don't look for uh we don't put any other priorities we start to respond to opportunities to do things that God wants us to do sometimes there's a call that goes out hey we've got listen we've got a youth camp coming up in September it's already been set for September uh long weekend it starts on August the 30th it'll end on July the 1st it's Friday Saturday and Sunday and we're going to need to plan that event and we want to make it the best Camp ever we've been doing it for 27 28 years now we want this to be the best one ever we've secured a minister by the leading of the Holy ho spirit I believe that that's the most important element in the meetings is when God sends us the right voice the right the right the the right individual somebody that that he wants that he's going to use that he's going to speak to the the young people and all of us amen it's an opportunity but we need you to step up and to be prepared to do your part in preparation for this weekend event and so that's an opportunity and we need to get behind the opportunity because it's God's business it's the father's business and he wants you involved so that you can fulfill your part your part might only be to give your part might be to to give time your part might be to to to to be there for the for the church cleaning whatever it is get into the father's business because this Youth Camp God has been blessed blessing it God has been providing for it God has been vindicating it year after year after year and we are about the father's business and I don't take it lightly I want to give 1,000% of our abilities and our knowledge and our and our our knowhow and the gifts that God has placed in this local body to do their part just like you did for the pastor's uh retirement celebration everybody came and they and they stood and and all I can say is that the Lord was proud of your sacrifices and your your giving and and all that you did and it came together and was a huge success for God's glory amen praise God it's the father's business amen and so God wants us not to be given any excuses we want to be getting there do uh listen do do any of us have more to accomplish on this Earth than than the Lord Jesus did most of us have lived already I'm I'm I'm almost twice the the the the the number of years that Jesus was on the earth and what he accomplished what about us we've got something that we need to accomplish and that we need to make the priority of the father's business our first priority amen praise God Hallelujah the New Testament teaches that we are all ambassadors for Christ and ministers in his name First Peter chapter uh 2 ver9 says but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation a people belonging to God that you may declare the Praises of him who called you out of Darkness into his glorious light 1 Peter 4:10 says each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others and to nourish and to edify the body of Jesus Christ Faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms amen as Christians whether we earn our living in a grocery store in a factory or in an office in our homes we are the Church of God In Action we are about the father father's business amen praise God and you know there's always promotion we're talking about business here and I'm I'm kind of mixing you know literal business with God's business and there's things in there that we can see similarities you know when I uh uh promote fantasy garden centers you know we'll run some ads in the newspapers we will do certain specials and promotions to draw the people in it's all part of promoting promoting right promotion is communicating the nature of what it is that you're trying to sell amen promotion is important because without it your product doesn't stand a chance of succeeding in meeting the people's needs and you know what our promotion is how many can guess what our promotion is your testimony your testimony is the greatest promotion that you will ever display when it comes to the father's business Hallelujah people you know businesses for example AT&T back in the 70s paid $60 million for a fword slogan Reach Out And Touch someone five $60 million but look at what it was Reach Out And Touch someone how do we reach out and touch somebody with our testimony that's all let them know what God did for you they will assimilate and say wait a minute maybe God can do that for me you see that's the father's business it's about relationships it's about you first having a relationship with Christ and then you through your relationship introducing him to them and if they have representation remember let's go back to the beginning you're ordained to receive this word from before the foundations of the world before you came here God prepared you to be the display of his word in your day and you'll only receive it if you're ordained to receive it amen praise God but how you going to know if they can receive it if you don't share it brother Gabriel handed me a tape he said ' are you a Christian I said ' I don't know I said I was brought up Roman Catholic if that's Christianity I'm a hypocrite because I don't practice what they preach he said yeah that's good I didn't say all of that all I said was the first part but he said yeah that's good here listen to this and he handed me a tape 1957 Hebrews series how Paul brother BR was preaching about Paul getting knocked off of his high horse so that he could recognize God was a reality Hallelujah and that he was going to call him no idea what God was doing but when God wants to do it he's going to do it hallelujah praise God and so you know our Our Testimony is our way of promoting Jesus Christ you know and as far as you know as far as the church is concerned re research consistently shows that people who have made Jesus Christ their lord and savior were led to that decision by the testimony of another person that they knew and were related what does that research tell us let less than 1% of Born Again Believers in Canada and the US made Jesus Christ their lord and savior through the efforts of Evangelical TV programs less than 1% a slightly higher number have become Christians by reading Christian books and magazines by listening to Christian radio programs about 5% became Christians through special programs at churches a slightly higher percentage did so because of the preacher at the certain congregation but listen to this however over 85% of those who make Jesus Christ their lord and savior have done so through the efforts and testimony of their friends families and neighbors so do you see why he wants to live through you you see how it is that he's reaching others by you EX accepting his word not a Doctrine not a man's teaching not because my dad went to this church my mom went to that church my no I was baptized as a baby no those are all excuses that keep you from coming to the word for your day and for this hour Hallelujah listen here I'm going to close with this every business does usually have a price that is offered for their product determining a price for a product is a very complex task it involves so many different variables the ultimate goal of price is the business in the business is that it should accomplish the following things bring a fair and reasonable return on your investment make the product financially accessible to the people who need it and provide a realistic value of service to those who need it keep your spiritual minds and thinking on here there's one important concept we have to remember as a church we can't cons we cannot confuse the concept of price with the concept of Finance we don't we don't correlate those two in in the house of God money does not correlate when it comes to Salvation the nature of our product is one in which a financial transaction is totally unnecessary the church on the other hand is required to make an investment an investment of of of commitment to the body of Christ amen an investment to the word an emotional investment a total personal and physical and intellectual commitment to the word of God that's the investment that we make as Sons and Daughters of God the church needs money to operate but that's not the price of our product we don't collect money so that we can put out the word that's not the way it works God will anoint individuals with Revelation to give to give tithing and to give offering if they're truly Sons and Daughters of God they cannot bypass that if they do they will struggle not necessarily financially you can struggle in many other ways than financially but when you miss that element because of certain uh you know fear or greed or not willing to let go and let God operate and flow through you in your tithes and offerings it it breaks down your your your spiritual strength your overcoming power it breaks down your relationships it makes you miss church it makes you disconnect from the body of Jesus Christ it all it all comes in many mysterious ways financial support for the church is an outgrowth of a person's desire to further spread the the the word of God it's it's it's it's something that somebody realizes hey by giving to the missions the word gets out there by giving and keeping our church healthy and strong and and physically fit it keeps people coming in and finding a place where they can hear the word of God keeping it clean and so forth amen Jesus listen he served as as a premier example of how to deal with this situation Jesus walked the roads and the streets in Judea and Galilee paying little attention to fundraising his primary concern was establishing relationships getting people to Christ getting them to that place where they can receive and get help from their condition and the circumstances and live a happy prosperous joyful life in Christ amen amen the investment the church needs to make is an investment from the heart and not So Much from the wallet we are about the father's business through our unique gifts and the abilities that God has placed within us as the mystical body of Jesus Christ we don't treat the church is promoting of the word as an opportunity for personal gain we're freed from using money as our scale of success money will come as a result of Faith because without faith there is no way you can please God with a million a trillion a billion it's got no relevance to God God wants character amen God wants you to have character God wants you to be so surrender and yielded to his spirit that that that when you come to that place and you're giving by Revelation and you know that he's Jehovah Gyra then blessings just automatically pour into your life they're your needs are just going to be met you don't you're not focused on on the money you're focused on on giving yourself to the to the ministry and to the father's business amen the church engages in mark marketing for a higher purpose the calling of the Sons and Daughters of God to an to the attention of the word and in closing let the musicians come I'll read you a little story here a young man in poverty named Howard Kelly and this is a true story was selling goods from door to door to pay his way through college one day he had nothing but a dime to his name and he was hungry he decided that he would ask ask for a meal at the next house however he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water he thought she thought he looked hungry and so she brought him a large glass of milk instead he drank it slowly and then asked how much do I owe you she said you don't owe me anything she replied my mother taught us never to accept payment for kindness he said then I thank you from my heart as he left that house he not only felt stronger physically but his faith in God and His emotional well-being were strengthened too he had been ready to just give up and quit years later that same woman became critically ill the local doctors were baffled they finally sent her to the big city where they called in for consultation when he heard the name of the town she came from no oh sorry where they where they called in Specialists to study her rare disease Dr Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation when he heard the name of the town she came from he went down the hall of the hospital to her room dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her he recognized her at once he went back to the consultation room determined to do his best to save her life from that day he gave special attention to the case after a long struggle the battle against the disease Was Won Dr Kelly requested that the hospital billing department send the final bill to him for approval he looked at it then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room she was afraid to open it because she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for it all finally she opened the bill and looked at it and saw something that caught her attention on the side of the bill she read these words paid in full with one glass of milk signed Dr Howard [Applause] Kelly the Bible tells us that the debt was paid you owe nothing there is nothing that you can do that could change your position in Jesus Christ as a son or a daughter of God there is no price that you need to pay because it was paid once for all amen it says in Ephesians 2:8 for it is by Grace you have been saved through faith that this is not from yourselves it is a gift of God this is a gift that God has given you salvation is your gift there's no price to pay a gift is something that you receive and it's free 2 Corinthians verse uh chapter 9:15 says thanks be to God for his Indescribable unmerited wonderful gift for his unspeakable gift amen
