heaven in Jesus then we invite your presence to come and feed you feed us this afternoon thank you we give you all the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen I have a couple of scriptures that you're going to be reading back and forth whilst we're going through it so um my first scripture will be taken from second Kings chapter 2 chapter 6 verse 25. and then we're going to read Second Kings seven one Acts um acts 12 verse once we they're going to ask we'll act 12 15 first religious couple of scriptures and then was we're going on with a bunch of scriptures so um first one is second case and that was a great farming in Samaria and behold they beseech it until an ass head was sold for CE called pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cup of doves dunk for five pieces of silver if you don't know that dogs dank is like excuse my language pupu of the dog of the dog that's what they were selling for it was so bad over there and then if you read the entire chapter six you read that it was so bad that somebody two people and they agreed to eat their children so one gave her his son or whatever button and they eat that children because it was super I don't have money and then the other one instead of bringing her son he hide it he didn't give the son so that they eat the sun and the King had it and the King rent his clothes and was crying but second Kings chapter 7 verse 1. then Elijah said hear ye the word of the Lord thus said the Lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flower be sold for a circle and two measures of Bali for a circle in the gate of Samaria then a lot in whose hand the king lean answered the man of God and said behold if the Lord will make Windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold thou shall see it with thy eyes but Thou shalt not evolve this man was so much consumed with the circumstance around that time and he checked the situation and all that you can see was the five stances so we selling dogs down to eat and pass price has so skyrocketing are you telling me that tomorrow you didn't even say be one month tomorrow you're gonna have abundance of free abundance of food he said no way it can happen because what he is expectation was doubtful so my pick today gonna be effects of expectation and let's read Acts chapter 12 15. then I I'll read back and forthwise you'll be doing it chapter 12 15. and they said unto her thou are mad but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then sad day it is his Angel and this situation is about Peter when he was released from the prison um that time they cut off James head so they were persecution and fear on the people on the disciples so when he was in prison and the damn cell told the disciples that Peter is here they said no he cannot be him even though they prayed and the things was manifested right there they weren't expecting it so just be seated so we're gonna read back and forth so my topic is effects of your expectation amen okay praise God and just to even begin with you get what you expect and today whilst you are here whatever you expect is what you're gonna get if you hear to find something to criticize you'll find a lot of problem to criticize but if you came here with the right mental attitude that when I hear something from God God will speak to your heart so you get what you expect and I'm afraid in the life of the children of Israel when God gave them that sacrifice that sacrifice killing of animals ghosts and all those things I think I ran before he says Christ was born it became it came to a Time that daily sacrifice become became common to them they didn't approach it it became like a tradition so they just bring it and sacrifice they just bring it and sacrifice so there was no sincerity in their worship and I wonder if that same spirit is creeping into the church as times is going as the message is getting longer and longer because when he came in people were expecting the Rapture to happen just like that even myself I wasn't expecting that I'll ever have kids and grow to be teenagers I used to tell people that before the Rapture I'm not going to go through anything these problems deal with my kids because the Rapture is just around the corner and it's just creeping or it's coming and it's coming so what I'm trying to say is that when it takes so long that people become relaxed that's why he said that all the virgins were were asleep because they don't approach it like their first love God wants us to go back to our first love when he was dealing when he came here I couldn't wait to come to service we couldn't wait to Pray by the way brother welcome back from Trinidad we couldn't wait to pray we couldn't wait to get in the house of the Living God But as time goes on it becomes common it's becoming tradition there are some people living it gets so bad that in the night when they're just going to pray oh God bless this one God bless you and then they just sleep it's time that we have to wake up it's time that we have to be serious it's time that you have to come back to the word it's time that you have to come back to what God wants us to do and knock away all the Traditions all the legalism and everything unlike Christ and approach him sincerely because when you're approach him sincerely he will answer your prayer he will come down and vindicate you he will come and be there with you so it's the same yesterday today and forever so our approach is very very important amen praise because so what I'm saying when I'm coming back to my topic as I said before it was if you read that second Kings it was life was very hard it was very tough now um if you compare to our Modern Life it has not been so bad that people are killing people to eat but the economic pressure is creeping slowly is creeping in slurry they increase the interest rates and when they increase the interest rather than said they take money from the system and while the interest rate is up food prices are skyrocketing rent mortgage everything I know someone was paying like 3 000 more they went to six thousand and they have to be go and sell that house and go and what uh rent for four thousand so everything is getting higher and higher and getting economic action remember it's economic pressure religious pressure and political pressure the three combined and put us into schools and they really buy from here but Asbury was saying that that time that as you're getting all this economic pressure and everything let's know you had the trouble believe that God is to be I said be strong and become and know that God is in control let not your heart be troubled by the present conditions don't let your heart be troubled about the economic conditions going on right now just look to God because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's never changed he's the same God hallelujah so if you read down here in Second Kings you see that can you put it on for me Second Kings seven verse one going verse 3 and he said that then there were four lepers men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why City we here until we die because if you're in Samaria they say that they are dead but he told them why should we sit here and die and just if you if verse 4 if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city so there was no food in some area they say that there's a farming over there and which I died there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall into the host of The Experience if they save us alive we shall live if they kill us reside that what died so I believe that that was the same thing that Esther came to do he said that if I perish let me perish I'm going to see the king so when desperation sits in it puts you under pressure you got to move you have to make a decision because God is also sometimes waiting on us it's not only God but you have a part to play that's why Joshua said everywhere that your footsteps I have given to you and footsteps is possession possess your possession amen break your footsteps and whatever you have need of God is able to provide for you don't stay still do something real every action brings reaction action that retail is gonna bring reaction so don't stay put and just look at the condition and cry don't look at the circumstances it covers every circumstances it Masters every circumstances so don't look at your circumstances because faith is a substance evidence of things that red substance it's not it's more than things that you can see or taste or feel Faith looks beyond what is wrong it looks beyond that so don't look at your present conditions and see their Idol but believe God's trade act on the word of God and God and God is going to get your reaction because when you act something will happen if you do not have not to happen they said that if you stay here we are dead but if we go maybe they will save us alive if they don't save us life we die we die but we may get something so God expects you to do something do something about the situation at least if you can't do anything just pray and don't only pray you pray and you act that's why in in in Mark 11 23 24 said that When you pray believe don't just only pray ER is the worst the best the most weapon the best weapon that any Christian can use so don't only what Pray when you act on your prayer because believe and act of date because if you look at the disciples the thing happened right there that you weren't expecting it this um man here who leaned on the king he wasn't expecting it so tonight this afternoon sorry by the time we leave here at least I wanted to ingrain everybody heart you get what you expect condition your mind that way I expect only good things in my life all the negative things is I it is not for me I reject anything I'm doubting my doubts I'm believing God's word I am accepting his promises because listen he died on Calvary everything he gave its rest is based on your acceptance even if the Lord Jesus Christ were to be here this morning this time he can never heal you because he has done it already on Calvary you have to accept your healing you have to accept your Financial Freedom you have to accept everything you have need of because without you accepting it you can never get it amen every self and awesome God his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he never lost a battle amen praise God I'm trying to say that what that Prophet said it came to pass let's continue with the second things and they rose up in the Twilight to go into the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of Syria behold there was no man there for the Lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of Terrors and a noise of horses even the noise of great hosts and they stepped onto another load the king of Israel had hired against us the king of the hectis and the kings of the Egyptians so come upon us wherefore they are rose and fled the Twilight and left their fence and their horses and their asses even their Camp as it was and fled for their life and when the lepers came to the outermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried Hands Held silver and gold and Raymond and went and hide it and came again and entered into another tent and carry things also and wet and hide it they said to another we do not well this day is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace if we carry till the morning light some Mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household in other words try to say that don't be selfish don't live for yourself a Christian life is to live for others the Lord came and shared his blood for us he came and lived for us so whatever you have you have to live for others don't obey be selfish when you get something if God placed in your heart bless people with it support his kingdom why do you want to be prospered if your motive is just for yourself and selfish need you won't get it but if the motive is to what support the kingdom and support missionaries and let the work of God then God will back you up because he knows your Motif is right and your objective is right your attitude is right yes I'm not saying I don't live inheritance for your children there was almost a wise man lived inheritance for his children listen for your family they support God's work support the missionaries play your side be faithful and God will bless you how he's going to bless you I don't know but you take care of you he's gonna take care of you because it's the same yes yesterday today and forever amen verse 11 and he called the apostas then said okay so verse 10. so they came and called to the port of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there voice of man the horses tied and asked us tied and they test us the way and he called the protest and they said and they told you to the King's house within and the King arose in the night and said unto his servants I will not show you what the students have done to us they know that we be hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in their fields seeing when they come out of the city we shall guide them alive and get into the city we see why the King was who was thinking he wasn't expecting nothing so when even guten is coming to him he's a thinking negative that's why some people even when people are saying certain things they don't know the motive behind what they are saying right away they got the negative aspect of what they are saying we have to be positive and know that being a son or daughter of God nothing that nothing everything that comes to your life God permit it Satan cannot do nothing unless he even seek permission from God himself so anything that comes to you they send him back a lemon out of your lemonade make a lemonade out of your lemon so anything that comes to you look it in a positive way because all is well everything gonna turn out to Gold not everything that comes to our life is good that is going to turn out to good sometimes it's God trying your faith sometimes God allows some people to step on your toes to see how he's going to react he allow all those circumstances to come to your life to see your reaction so just take things the way they are and believe God don't be negative I don't like to be around negative people you got to be positive positive minded towards every promise of God because the king wasn't expecting nothing so when the news came he was still thinking negative oh they have Trappers oh they're going to do this they are going oh if we do this oh this thing will come on you that will come on you but they won't think about the positive part so God is telling them because human nature that's the way right these five senses but the word of God goes beyond that amen praise our God okay I'm not going to read for verse 17 in the end if you read the whole scripture everything came as was what expected verse 16 and the people went out and spoiled a tense of the syrians so a measure of fine Flora was sold for a circle and two measures of the valley for a circle according to what the word of God that means that the word of God will not come avoid unless accomplish what it was what thankful amen so God's word will come to pass regardless of the circumstances regardless of what is going on God's will will come to pass amen and the prophecy came from because the one that doubted it he died and he came to pass that the man of God spoken has spoken the king saying two measures of baling for a circle and measure of fine flow of seconds I'll be tomorrow about this time in the gate and the Lord answered the man of God and said now behold if the Lord to open make Windows in heaven my search attendee and he said behold thou shall see you thine eyes that shall not what eat thereof and so it felt it felt unto him for the people thrown upon him in the gate and he died if you read the whole scripture he was the one that he was the king told him to be in charge so he saw it he really enjoy it because what he doubted so the Bible the Bible said doubt your doubt believe God's word it takes more strength to doubt than to even to believe it's easier to believe than to doubt is that if you say to this mountain be thou removed and do not doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you sir have what you said it's a promise to the believer if you say to this Martin whatever you say you can even go and Live Another Mountain for yourself you can speak your own word and living in that case believe those things is available it's not a history it's not a myth he's the same yesterday to them forever there is nothing that God cannot do he can open Windows of Heaven to all to bless whatever he wants he can do it is God because these people they forgot that the same God When the Children of Israel didn't have food he Reign manner from Heaven God can do everything why did he tell the prophet's word because what unbelief we have some people they can never believe we have some people they make believe they try to believe but we have some people naturally they don't do nothing they can they just believe that is what is it's what they see it in there has nothing because in their soul is either Faith or doubt so if their faith is already it naturally believe God's word it doesn't force it doesn't push it doesn't do anything it's naturally believe God's word but you have a choice for Abraham Abraham believed he started not at the promise of God but he was constantly giving praise he didn't look at his condition as 75 years old my big promise to have a child and and the wife is 60 years but if he looks at the doctor's report you would have doubted it but he never looked at a doctor's report he didn't look at his condition but he trusted God's word and even though a terrorists it came to pass so even though the reason a terrorists to come to pass whatever promise that God has given you if thou can't believe it will come to pass whatever God this afternoon is needing your heart to believe just believe it and you come to pass it doesn't matter how it lingers that's how much how you see the circumstances go beyond the circumstances believe God's word if God could send Elijah is the man like we are passion and pray that should not Reign three and a half years and didn't happen what about you and me that was even beyond the calvary whatever you have need of just believe just trust God don't listen to the um those lots of voices that is that is saying that it cannot happen With God all things are possible amen praise our wonderful God Amen praise God hallelujah so I am and I'm gonna go back to the book of Acts chapter 12. from verse 1. now about the time Herod the king stress forth his sons to Vex certain of the church and he killed James the brother of John with the sword that put fears in the Believers um believer's heart and because he saw a place the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also so when the thing happened the disciples were scared because he took James head and then he took Peter also then were the days of unleavened bread and when he had appointed him he put him in prison and deliver him to what four continuous of soldiers to keep him intended after he started to bring him forth to the people so his intention was to kill Peter but I believe that Peter wasn't scared because the Lord has told him that he's gonna be an old man so even though Peter himself it doesn't matter what that Herod was doing he knew that he wasn't old yet so he didn't care he wasn't scared but verse five Peter therefore was kept in prison but what prayer was made without season of the church unto God for him amen we have a prayer team prayer Was Made For That season they prayed they prayed and when we pray we have and get an answer so if prayer will bring God down why don't you pray pray pray amen pray and prayer will bring God's anointing down it will change circumstances changes one time prayer was even able to change God's mind you say yes yes God does not change his mind but when the Prophet The Prophet went to him and told him that you have 15 more years to believe is that you have to prepare your house to die he said that he prayed and said I want 15 more years and God let the prophet go back I said I gave you 15 years why it's a prayer that changed everything so prayer is the the biggest weapon every Christian can have so pray pray in your heart everywhere you're going you don't have to be just in your room you don't have every situation Pro over it I was reading the um was saying that if you face with a situation and you don't know how to act just be neutral and prayed because he deals in the form of vision but not all of us have the ability to have those Visions so he said that when you are confronted with a situation and you don't know which way to take the left or right you prayed but whilst you're praying don't take be neutral and wants to continue to pray wherever you leaning more towards that's why we have to work go because if you are praying with a neutral attitude he gonna reveal it to you and you're gonna get a clear cut so pray pray and you're gonna get your answer hallelujah amen and then verse 6. and when Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers banned with Chase are you banned with chains of circumstances this afternoon amen and they keep us before the door kept freezing and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him in a light sign in the prison and spot Peter on the side and raise the map saying I Rise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands amen with seven and living God that those prisoners did not see anything an angel of God went to the prison and said Peter free that same God is here this afternoon whatever circumstances that you are training he's able to cut it off he can take any channel circumstances from you because it's the same yesterday today and forever I blessed your name that sounds that are in the middle of life you find yourself in a Praying the prison of your mind reach out and defy those shares in Jesus name amen defile those things in Jesus name amen because that chain of second the angel of God came and delivered Peter from there and Herod if you read the whole thing he became puff up and God let him die because what he he wanted he went you went afarov but that's what happened so back the Believers that time I believe that they were doubting they weren't expecting because the church was infancy that's what has happened that's what the Holy Ghost came they're having all those financial happening in their life and then they prayed and you read the entire verse 15 and when she knew Peter's voice she opened not the gate for gladness the lady was so happy when she saw that God has answered their prayer little Maid she was so happy to hear that God prayer had been answered he was rejoicing and he forgot she forgotten herself to reopen the door to let you tell him amen sometimes when God assess your prayer the joy that comes in your heart the happiness that come with faith is inexplicable when God assess the situation sometimes he gets into a place that you don't have nowhere to turn but God comes in and solve it and bring Joyce in your heart you bring happiness in your heart you can't explain it but become happiness because what God has done it it's a paradise we cannot explain it but it happened amen how can you explain me scientifically prove to me somebody who chain abound in a prison with um two people guiding him and then nobody saw him and then he disappeared and the King came they checked everything was locked scientifically proved to me you can't prove it scientifically because my God swear cannot representative proof prove to me how Joshua could say stand stand still and the stands true still you come and prove it to me scientifically Moses the boy and who was so scientifically minded and he teached the Egyptians even their own language and everything that sounds like you can't improve that burning books how that boost was what burning and then it was that that it was banned what it was Banning is that right and there was no fight the fire fire was burning there was no thing over there you can't stand to carry prove God we believe God because certain things that happens the doctors even can understand it that is done by the hand of the Living God that's the God that you are serving this afternoon this name is the Lord Jesus Christ he's never lost a battle he said I'll be with you even in you until the consideration of the time he is with you this afternoon he will never forsake you not leave you no matter what comes my way my God my life is in his hand no matter what circumstances my life is the hand of Jesus Christ he is my savior He's My Redeemer he's my everything he loves me oh how I love Jesus because he first loved me the love of God is beyond a measure he said that us and you shall receive as abundantly so that your joy may become full the same phrase when I ask for that little thing that same faith can believe for big things he said that when you go to the supernatural you say you can't exhaust God's goodness is that right you can never exhaust his good this amen imagine that face said that he's gonna drink a small amount of water from the ocean it doesn't make sense because you can't limit God resources he said that I will give you a band that more than what you shall even desire even your heart is thinking I'll do it abundantly that's the god that we are saving he's done answering prayer God he said God that loves her he said God that answers prayer he never change he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah God is awesome amen what almighty God will say thank you Jesus amen Hallelujah and that person that was in prison was Paul Paul and Barnabas also went to preach and they were in prison if you read I think ask chapter 16 verse 25 to 28. and at midnight Paul and Silas parade and sang Praises unto God and the prisons heard them and suddenly there arose a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison was shaking and immediately all the doors were open and every once band will lose and the keepers of the prison are working out of his sleep and saying the prison doors open he drew his thought and would have killed himself suppose that the prison had been fled but Paul cried out saying do thyself no harm we are all here if you read down the road that's Supernatural a graved that man's heart to such a sense that him and his whole household believe Paul and Sarah's in the oil they were saved and that same God is here he can do those Financial in your life if you consecrate yourself because Paul in Philemon he talks about also a prisoner of Christ it's a different kind of prison that he's talking about that prisoner of Christ let me read this quotation here in the um in the it's called prison that's a different kind of prison but before and I would like to make this statement that God always has to take any man that was heaving truly to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition he is God everything that is yes everything his life soul and body will Ambitions and everything else and become a complete prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God you might have to walk contrary to your better judgment maybe in a certain organization you might think that they could lift you up and give you something great that you might Flash but what do you find yourself you find yourself defeated after a while until God can get a man that is willing to become a prisoner to him God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything by Christ even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you are only connected with Christ and him only then God can use you until then you can't so that if you follow me deny yourself and other Apostles Peter and the rest Peter said we have forsaken mother father and the world and follow you what shall we got in return he said there's no one that has left mother father sister and follow me that will not be blessed in this world and they were the world to come so that's they're following of Christ called for forsaken he called for surrounding I'm not saying that ignore them or don't take care of them but when it comes to everything God has to be first he has to be priority over my wife over my children God has to be first in other circumstances then your family and the rest I'm not saying that ignore them the way I'm trying to say that they sometimes if they have to be a stumbling block you have to choose Christ support them the person that you came but don't let them be in your way of serving God because if you do that I cannot serve God God wants people who are separatists and Abraham cannot even be blessed until he separate himself from from lot because he took all those garbage those baggage with him God called Abraham alone but Abraham didn't want to go by himself he'd take his dad and God let the dad died he took his nephew and it their future has given me a lot of trouble that he has to separate himself from his nephew until he separate himself then God said look the Stars and bless you all your Defenders and everything so God's word called for total separation from unbelief unbelieving is right because there is only one thing unbelief in God's word it's Faith or unbelief amen so he's calling us to separate us from every trace of unbelief amen and if you look all those men that serve God were separatists Joseph was put in prison before he could become who he was and in prison when you are in prison you secluded you are confined you don't have a choice you follow the instructions so it's a true Christian without your yourself you can follow it to Jesus his leadership that's why I want God's way to be my way amen no matter what I want God's will to be my way amen even though the road be rough and steep but he needs me I will follow because I want God's way to be my way God's way is the best even though it's not easy because a Christian work is not enough Larry Bird of is but we have to follow you have no choice you have come this far he didn't bring us this far to leave us he didn't bring us this party for seconds you're gonna take us through sister let's believe God let's trust God and confide to him and let him lead us let us surrender all our Ambitions all our world and put under Jesus feet he will guide us and direct us for his perfect world sometimes if the road seems to be so rough things seems to be not happening you look at circumstances you give up but never give up never give up press on press on press on if you only know what awaits for you you're gonna press down don't give up don't ever give up pressed on the mask called The High Calling he's calling you to that level he's the same yesterday today and forever amen praise our God our God is Awesome hallelujah amen so don't ever give up and another person that was a prisoner was also Moses Moses was highly educated he could teach all the first and everything but he tried to deliver the children of Israel by his own Mighty hand with all his uh intellectual things but it did not work so God has to take him to the desert for 40 years for him to be a prisoner to God's word and when God knock at every nonsense he has learned from Pharaoh's house and all those things that he became a candidate to be used and when he got there he was so weak that he thought that he has to use my sins and everything to deliver the people he said what can I do how am I going to do it he said what is it in your hand so what do you have in your hand this afternoon whatever you have surrendered to God and when Moses surrounded that that thing to God it was able to do the work just a little stick and he did the work just like David he asked what that five Souls that took care of Goliath a thing that it's all it's not the souls by the faith behind the man who was using it who was behind that Stones the Lord Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever amen praise our God our God is good he's an awesome God you are blessed to have the Lord Jesus Christ in our midst when the people don't know what they are doing from left south and east amen you got what you expect because God one time revealed to Simon that he was never going to die until he see the Messiah and Simon all around he was expecting the Messiah amen when the time came the crisis has led him to the birth of Christ and he said that let your servant rejoice in peace you have seen the hand of the Living God and brother is the same God let let Simon to that Christ thing that same God is him that has led you here this afternoon if that can't believe you get what happened of today he's the same yesterday to them forever just believe God you didn't come here by chance you will become a Christian by chance God pre-ordained he or far then he predestinated you for such a time like this you are reserved for this time of the year you are reserved for this time of the day of the age God could put his trust in you because I deal with that test will not be made perfect amen because they are all waiting on us foreign has to do but they need to be surrounded we need to be prisoner of Christ there's so many things that is attaching us God wants us to get rid of all those attachments so that he can fully float through us the way you want to do oh God and be a prisoner of Christ let God take control over the situation commit your ways to God let him take control and he will bring it to pass he's the same yesterday today and forever and God never change Hallelujah is the same God praise our God thank you Jesus amen Hallelujah and if you read I understand scripture about us chapter 16. Acts chapter 14. verse 8 to 15. Acts chapter 14 verse 8. and then sat a man at least right important in his feet being a from his mother's womb who never had walked the next verse please the same help Paul speaking who steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had Faith to be healed set with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he lived and walked continue reading and when the people saw what Paul had done they let out of their voice saying in the speech of light Corner that Gods had come down to earth in the likeness of men continue and they called badhabas Jupiter and Paul mercuros because he was a chief speaker keep on reading then the prince of Jupiter which was before their City brought oxen and garlands onto the gates and would have done sacrifice to the people next which when the Apostle Barnabas and Paul head of they rent their clothes and run in among the people crying out and saying says why do you these things we also are men of like persons with you and preach until that ye should turn from these vanities into the Living God which made Heavenly and Earth and the Sea and all things that they are in so my point is Paul was trying to let them know that they also have passion like they are as Elijah was a man subject to like passion like you are so my point today is If God could use Paul in that capacity that somebody was crippled from his womb to come back to life that same God is here today to give all your need to use you if you surrender yourself because we are not different from them there are men of right past they make mistakes they have anger they have all those things but when they were surrendered to God became prisoner of Christ he could that thing could happen in his ministry and one thing that you have to learn from that is that Paul and Panama never accepted that worship because Jesus Christ is God and him alone has to be worshiped if you check in the scripture every man of God none of them accept worship God is jealous of his worship His share not his worship with anybody that's why he Kickstarter from Heaven because Satan being a creation of God wanted to receive worship so he was cast down and anyone that received worship is of the devil because God allows to worship His name is the Lord Jesus Christ that's why he accepted worship that's why he allow them to worship him even if you read in Revelation 19 when John the Revelator was so caught up with the angel that that imaginary said that he wanted to have said no worship God I'm your brethren one of your breathing so don't worship me the angels Don't worship God that angels are alive to worship him so he's a prophet amen he was so caught up the God used him so much that when God incarnate in the people and he used that no we'll see they said that they they found out that Peter and John were ignorant and on rented but they said they have been root of Jesus when God incarnate himself if you surrender yourself you're a seed of God and God incarnate himself so much in you and the people see the trace of God sometimes they mistake you to be God that's why Abraham has to get away from the preaching about three years because people are worshiping his name people are doing all kind of things he said no you can't make me Antichrist he's got her from it for three years but oh that God revealed to himself my brother don't worry they did that to John the Baptist that he understood so all those things if you see it going on don't worry it's a spirit that you as a son or daughter of God you worship only Jesus Christ These Are Everything Jesus Christ Our everything he's my father is my mother he is everything to me him I love me worship amen our God is Awesome Hallelujah Jesus Christ is God Amen there's no other gods that there's no God this time there's no God after me I'm the Lord God heal is right the Lord your God is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God let's give him our plows amen he's God he has risen from the dead is God every knee shall by every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is God Amen praise God I'm just gonna give a little testimony here then I'll close shortly one time I went to work on the job side in Mississauga and there was this guy here um you are so nice to me a carpenter he treats me so good help me doing everything and I will end up talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and I told him that because Jesus Christ is God it doesn't matter what religion they are when they got in trouble unconsciously that name is on the back of the people's mind they mentioned the name he said that no way forget it Philip you I I never mentioned this testimony I got in trouble today he's not God he's just another person there are three Gods all that kind of thing so I just forget about him I went back the following day and God had that I was just around him he was working in a in the kitchen in the master home suite trying to do a window black rest and this guy did everything he couldn't fix the window and he was struggling struggling I said oh Jesus Oh I thought you don't you don't message these things he did it for like three times and then the following thing I happened to go to work but I was late and something told me to buy a coffee for this guy so when I bought the coffee double double when I got there the guy was just in his van going to buy a coffee so I gave that coffee to him and he said oh my goodness you know what to do to himself but I'm trying to like Jesus Christ is God you can't deny that he's the same yesterday to them forever he is like he's the one that created everything and that same God is in you and in me today because when he came to shed his blood on Calvary so that he became what available to everyone of us so now as the brother said you agree the badger skin you have become the temple of God and God dwells inside of you you are not going to be Sons and Daughters of God now you are the sons of God now present tense so not nobody put that in future you have to recognize who you are that I am a son a daughter of the Living God now you are the Son of God it's not going to be in the future and that's him God is with you and in me today because you are a temple that God dwells in you and in me and he is what waiting on you and me so you got to be ready we have to make our mind up we have to stand on the word of God because God is supporting us all the way sometimes things may not seem the way you want it to go might not see the way you see it but don't give up he's still with you even in you so I'm just gonna conclude with that let expect let our expectation be high on what God is able to do not look at your circumstances don't look at the things around you sometimes life it seems to be so much shackles and things seems to be going all wrong but God is still in control he's in control of every situation he will turn things to the right way so let's keep on pressing on let's keep on fighting let's keep on doing our part and he has already done it because one thing is God can never feel or he cannot lie he keeps all his appointment keeps all his weight he's always on time when he made that promise to Abraham he swelled by Earth himself not by anybody he himself swear that I would do this I would do that out because he knows that we cannot keep it that's why the Lord changed because he said Abraham Adam if you do this if you do that then when he came to Abraham it was unconditional promise it's not what you have done it's what God has already done he has already done it so I called the musicians to come and let's prepare for the songs amen okay let's pray oh a gracious Eternal God I'm so grateful and thankful that what you place my heart I've just spoke it I pray that it blessed your people and if there's anything that was
