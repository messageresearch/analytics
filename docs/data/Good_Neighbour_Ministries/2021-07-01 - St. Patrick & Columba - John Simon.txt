TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] another wonderful evening another holy night wonderful indeed for the stars of god are brightly shining the great messengers that god has sent are all shining brightly in the skies of the heart of the true believers and may the great holy spirit help us all to understand their reflections and projections of the light of the sun may the great holy spirit visit with us and bless us all tonight god to god be the glory great things he has done i'm glad to be here with you friends and to share god's word from the bottom of my heart and from this glorious wonderful timeless book of which critics have hammered against it but the anvil remains and the hammers have all been worn out and gone for the word of god stands secure heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away saith the lord now as we look into this scripture reading this fourth church age in revelation chapter 2 verse 18 and unto the angel of the church in thyathira right these things saith the son of god who had his eyes like onto a flame of fire and his feast are like fine brass we'll also like to read as a background out of matthew chapter 23 reading from verse 27 to 31 and it reads woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are like unto whited sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead man's bones and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity wow unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophet and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous and say if we have been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that you are the children of them which killed the prophets god's blessing upon his wonderful words of life now the last time we were here we talked about the true church and the false church and the continuous effort like cain with abel the continuous effort to kill off to persecute silence the true church god's little flock which is always under the criticism and destruction danger of destruction by the false church but thank god he never leaves himself without a witness and god always has a little flock and here again we see the hand of god that in the midst of the persecution the darkness of this evil age of tayatara that god in the midst of it all preserved a little flock and we thank god for that now as the church and when i say the church i'm including true and false together now we find that the church split into two parts the eastern and the western you may even have a pieces of that still uh pointing those truths to us today as some of you know that there are still the eastern arm of the church and the western arm also of the church now within these two divisions ever so often there would be glimmers of light and truth and power for men would arise from the midst of of them and within these two arms and divisions and they would lead some segment or part of the church into some deeper truths deeper life and closer walk with god well such a man in the western division was saint francis of a city and he was truly successful with the work that he was doing for the glory of god but finally all of his work was put under the control and power of the hierarchy of rome then there was peter waldo he was just a merchant but a godly man who surrendered his life surrendered his all and committed himself to serving the lord in a very active way and drew many many were drawn to jesus christ because of this man's life and of his ministry and so as he took the word of god out to the multitudes once again we see the false church twerked his works obstructed him and also he was excommunicated by the then pope out of the western part of the church but you see what i'm saying is that out of the western part out of the eastern part there was no man with such light grace and power to yet arise that could fulfill that part of being the messenger to the triathlon church age however there were two men in the british isles that we must think about and consider for this of course one of them has already been identified as the messenger to this age by the prophet of this 20th century our precious brother william marion branham and indeed these two men were outstanding bought in their supernatural ministries of the word and their supernatural ministries and exploits and de-up and deeds by the power of the precious holy spirit they were fully recognized and these two men were saint patrick and saint columba it was to columba that the responsibility fell to be the messenger of the lord of this church age of sayatyra but we would love to speak about saint patrick for he is a notable saint of god and he needs to be recognized and we need to recognize him so that we may take from him an example of righteousness and of walk with the living god and also we find that i speak we want to speak or we speak on saint patrick to debunk lie that is in the historical roman church that saint patrick was one of them when we look into the historical and practical facts we find out that saint patrick of course he had never actually been to rome and he had never been commissioned by rome and there is no claim in other words it's a total lie for them to claim that patrick was one of them as much a lie as saying joan of arc was one of them but to speak on that my friends we must understand from the scripture i read this is the pattern from the times of christ to our day and in our time the consistent eradication persecution total destruction and if one could not be confined to oblivion then there will then build a great tomb write great books right great facts about the individual praise them and elevate them as if to say uh here was one of us and that would then blind the multitudes to the fact that they were the ones that actually killed saint joan of arc the ones that persecuted the true saint their blood is upon their hands oh this cannot be washed off like pilate with a basin of water but one has to take responsibility and even now there are more deaths there more destruction quietly taking place unknowing to many it is happening even while we speak now saint patrick of course was born as the nephew of saint martin who was the messenger of the previous church age god used martin in a marvelous and wonderful way and now here comes saint patrick a nephew for he was born to saint martin's sister he a wonderful mother marvelous genes dna uh god bless him in a marvelous way it was said that he was born in a town called burn on the banks of the river clyde and one day while playing on the shoreline with his two sisters pirates suddenly appeared and kidnapped them and took them away and history does not record what happened to his sisters but of saint patrick whose name was sukkat he was sold to a chief chieftain in the northern part of ireland and of his duty as a slave was to feed the swine to take out the pigs and take charge of them to in other words to make his job easier to make his job something that he could do well it is recorded that this young man trained dogs and he trained those dogs so well that many people came from far and near to by the dogs that he would train in the midst of this all this young man was so lonely that after work he would sit looking at the stars in his loneliness and beginning to cry out to god and to talk to god and god was able to speak to his heart and to save his soul with his great salvation there came an urgent burning desire within his heart to escape and to return back to his home and to his parents and as such martin formed a plan and he planned to use his ability as a dog trainer uh to carry out this plan so he began to train these dogs how to cover his body he would live on the ground and all the dogs would come and cover his entire body he trained them to do that to cover his entire body carefully and they were not to move until he commanded them then one day his honor that that means the owner of him and the dogs sold the team of dogs that he had trained to someone else and of course the owner had to send a captain of a ship to pick up that pack of dogs and to take them to where he was living and martin led the dogs as he walked behind the owner his owner when they got to the shoreline we find that martin gave a signal to the leader of the pack of dogs who immediately ran off and when he ran off of course they were beside themselves trying to catch that one dog and to bring him back so that the contract will be completely filled while they were busy with that martin got into this marvelous boat and commanded the dogs to cover him so he laid on the bottom of that boat and the dogs all lay on top of him and covered him entirely and when he was sure he was covered he gave a whiffle a secret signal and the leader of the pack on the shore of course heard it and he came back and immediately leapt in the boat and also left on top of that pack of dogs as they lay there of course the owner told the captain to quickly take off lest one of them were to jump out again and so he took off with his with those dogs going away with them the owner not seeing martin around thinking maybe he had gone back he decided to leave and return to his home meanwhile patrick was in the bottom of that boat covered by those dogs and when he was sure after a lengthy period of time that he was far away from where he started and that the captain of that boat will not turn back because he had gone too far to turn back anymore may god help every one of us that we would live for christ in such a way that we will realize that we have gone too far to turn back now i want to say i believe i'm at that place where i've gone too far where i would turn back now the spirit of the lord has brought me thus far by faith and maybe he has brought you thus far by faith and i urge you and encourage you let us press on in the name of our lord jesus christ that we may gain the ultimate prize that we may have the announcement of our victory come thou good and faithful servants enter into the joy of the lord then step to the front receive your crown of life that fadeth not away receive the morning star receive the tree of life amen and so on god has promised the overcomer all these marvelous and wonderful promises if we press on right to the very end and cross the finish line ending this race of life and entering into the glories of our lord blessed be the name of the lord and so martin came from amongst the dogs and the captain of course was in surprise and martin threatened him that if he turned back he would lose the dogs uh upon upon his ship upon that boat and he would have a lot of trouble and he would take over he might he patrick would take over that boat so the captain happened to be a christian and when martin told him of his kidnapping of his sisters and his entire story of his slavery the captain decided that he would take martin right back to his home where he came from and he did and so martin returned to his home and there my friends god used him in a mighty way and he began to preach the word and in the preaching of the word hundred over a hundred thousand people did you hear me over a hundred thousand people were converted to true genuine christianity and they were born again by the holy spirit into the kingdom of god now the truth of the matter is that when rome tried to gain a foothold into the island they could not because of the preaching of saint patrick but after a while they were able to do it and once they were able to do it at their earliest opportunity they slaughtered killed and destroyed that hundred thousand hundred thousand people that followed the message of saint patrick well but today what do we have their great celebrations of saint patrick's day the garnishing of the tomb of the prophets and of these messengers this is the tactic and technique to cause people to forget what they did in the past they make a glorious thing about it and we ought to respect saint patrick and if we can we ought to celebrate his life and his accomplishment but no association with catholicism no association whatsoever but his association is with thus said the lord of the truth of the word of god god bless him god bless his descendants god bless those that follow the message that saint patrick preached now 60 years after the death of saint patrick columba was born in county donegal in northern ireland and he was born to a royal family the royal family of fergus born to that position he was brilliant intellectually he was also a consecrated scholar one who spent most of his time not just reading his bible but studying the word of god and he became a real uh one who actually memorized the scripture and knew the scripture back and forth for god gave him a brilliant mind and memory to use for that one day god called him not by imagination but he heard an audible voice calling out to him and to follow and saw columba he did that voice and once he heeded that voice nothing could stop him when a man or a woman or a child hear the voice of god and the calling of the holy spirit my friends not mother not father not church not pope not priests not superintendent supervisor no person can stop them with their desire and their hunger to fulfill the will and purpose of god within their lives because my friends they heard the message they heard the word and now they're going to run with that message that god has placed in their heart for here they are on fire with the word of the living god and so he began to preach the word miracles and signs began to follow the ministry of columba and not just one or two miracles and signs but multitudes of miracles and myriads of signs began to follow him his ministry and such an outstanding way that historians have written about this messenger of this fourth church age of sciatica they have written that since the days of them apostles this man's ministry is like those of the apostles for the power of god in the presence of the holy spirit vindicated him and followed him wherever he went glory to god so great was his ministry signs and wonders miracles that even it was heard about way over in europe in rome and even when they heard the signs wonders and miracles they they thought it was exaggerations that it was exaggerated but it was not it was the truth for god was back in the church again god you know the god with one man can make a majority god if god can get a hold of a surrendered heart a surrendered man a surrendered woman a surrendered child had surrendered someone god can take a no body and turn them into a somebody for his glory and for his honor and so he took kalumba and began to use him it is said that in one of his missionary trips approached the city and when he approached the city as they saw him coming they closed the gates oh back in the old testament they saw uh samuel the prophet coming they closed the gates they wanted to know the reason for his come cometh now in peace they wanted to be sure he didn't come with a curse but with a blessing oh my and saw the sphere of god was upon them they closed the city gates against columba and barnett against him but there in front of those gates he lifted up his voice and prayed to god asking god to intervene in this situation and to allow him access into the city his purpose being not business his purpose being not just associations oh but his purpose being to spread the word of truth everywhere that the hearts of men may come out of darkness into the glorious light of our lord jesus christ and so he prayed and as he began to pray they sent out the court magicians and musicians and caused them to begin to bang and harass columba and to keep all manner of noise to block out the sounds of his prayer and of his voice uh before god before the people that were trying to listen they they just blotted him all out like that and then he changed from praying and he decided he was going to sing a song he was going to sing a psalm unto the lord oh how excellent o lord is thy name in all the earth oh praise god and as he begin to sing and to praise god suddenly god's anointing came upon him and the volume of his voice began to increase but with so much sound and loudness until it drowned out the noises of all those hidden musicians that were coming against him and while he was still singing and while their voices were drowned out and while the gates they had it still barred all of a sudden they watched the gate began to open up on their own accord the gates swung open wide praise god and columba walk right into the city under the divine protection and leadership of the holy spirit oh may god give us men like that may god help me to be a man like that may god help you to be a woman a child a person like that that god can use that will be so surrendered to him that revival time would be here again that the holy spirit will be here on earth again wherever you are no matter how it seems don't look at the scenery don't look at the appearance of things but look unto the mighty god in christ who is above all and works through his children in a mighty and marvelous and wonderful way amen another time i'm speaking about columba the messenger of the tired siren churches and here he is going to another village to preach the word and again he was shut out completely out of that village and after a while he turned away as if he wanted to depart he was departing but then suddenly the son of the chieftain of that village fell violently ill he was so ill nigh unto death it caused the chieftain to open up and send out messengers to get columba and to bring him in to that village and so he prayed the prayer of faith with the powerful almighty god and god's spirit came upon the land a man and the boy jumped up and was instantly healed by the power of god and the entire village was so excited that it was opened up to the evangelization of the gospel of our lord jesus christ of course the pure gospel that was preached by columba my friends and his fellow workers it spread out from ireland it spread all over scotland the revival's fires began to burn it spread into northern europe the word began to move oh you better get ready when god gets ready to move god's spirit all over the world is moving amen god promised in these last days his spirit will move not with man-made movements but he himself god would restore his word would move in the church of the living god all the years the conquer worm palmer worm caterpillar all these armies have the spiritual armies of trying to destroy god's seed but thank god god has raised up a people again a people that lives by the word feeds on the word walks with the word oh my and saw the revival spread from ireland to scotland right into northern europe and began to spread out the fires of life of light and power of the great holy spirit of the living god overflowing in every way amen but you see he started out that way but then god started to give him a method and his method was that he would send out 12 brothers anointed with the holy spirit taught in the scriptures and they would go out usually there was a carpenter preachers there were agricultural people that could plant farmers and so on and he would send them out to start a small town and they would start a village together the word of god hallelujah and they lived holy lies versed in the scripture and they would be enclosed in that little uh village with a wall and very soon people were coming from near and far surrounding that village to be students disciples of the world and as they gathered it moved from just a fellowship of twelve it began to explode in numbers as it grew into a village and into a town and those men would study the word and go out from that place to preach in the outlying districts yet lying areas villages towns and declare the word of god and may i say these men were not priests these men were pastors and preachers missionaries evangelists that were set by the holy ghost and saw there were men who were allowed to marry they married amen some of them chose not to marry but most of them married and had families but there were preachers that were sent out with the word of god and they were they were not maintained by the state they were not given money help or maintenance sustenance by the state they kept far away from the state and they steered clear of any politics they kept right out of it they kept their eyes on the word of god as our prophet has said look away to jesus oh look away keep your eyes upon jesus amen and so my friends they're steered away from politics and my friend they believed that the truth of the world was the greatest weapon that they had and all they had to do was preach the revelation of the hour the power of the holy spirit embodied in the word of god amen hallelujah amen so they were absolutely independent of any religious hierarchy or leadership of that day in time including rome they were not my friends under any other hatship than the leadership and headship of jesus christ our lord saint columba was also the founder of a great bible school where he would take young men and begin to teach them the the word of god the rudiments of the word of god because one can only teach are various branches of the word but the revelation has to be of god amen so this bible school was on the island of high which was uh off of the southwest coast of scotland that was a notable island where the island was like barren no one could really plant uh food there to sustain themselves but the lumbar planted and prayed on this barren place and as he planted it one hand the other hand up raised to god in pear and while he prayed and planted we have the testimony that after a while it became the most fruitful and fertile island throughout that then known world oh praise god and from that that god-centered bible-taught and bible-shattered little island went fought many mighty scholars with the word of god who were endowed with wisdom and empowered by the power of god my friends whenever we read the history of this great servant of god and of the wonderful work that he did it saddens our hearts that the purple power nothing to bring all men under their control and jurisdiction bring all men into their grasping hands came and defiled those mission fields and destroyed much of the truth that was taught by columba at that time my friends tonight's lesson was to present to you the messenger of this fourth church age the church age of thyatira we we spoke on the fact that many great men arose but they did not come to the level where god could appoint them as the messenger to the age even said patrick the most outstanding of them all who was the nephew of saint martin he arose and was mightily used of god and he was a saint of god not a saint of rome but a saint of god and oh god bless his heart but up 60 years after him along comes columba and columba has been identified by history identified by the holy spirit by his word and his works that follow him to this very day may god bless him and use columba as we continue to study into these church ages going to our next topic where we will touch on the salutation we will touch my friends also upon the seed of nicolaitanism and may the great holy spirit help us as we delve into the word of god be with us for our next study next wednesday evening at this time god bless you subscribe like and come back again and may the lord pour out his spirit upon you and watch between us until we meet again god bless you [Music] you
