TRANSCRIPT
========================================
purpose that's because we know that by coming into the house of God we are keeping our connection with an unseen being the great Holy Spirit The Shepherd of the Sheepfold amen who has come down Among Us by the opening of that seventh seal and even though we don't see him brother Bram said yet the one who you feel in your heart one day he'll come visible before you you'll become personalized you him because you see him in the world that's why I'm here that's why I'm always touched when I come into this place whether there's 2 or 10,000 which I've spoken to 25,000 at one time it makes no difference Brothers amen something happened to me when I was young and it's never left me I I don't believe it ever will it's got a hold of me and it won't let me go amen I thank God that even though I as a human being in weakness you may want to let go but he won't let you go Hallelujah because we belong to him we're glad to be here in the house of the Lord welcome back and the Lord bless you real good now we know time is of the essence especially in the middle of the week and we'd like to uh take for topic uh tonight the mystery of the ages if those if we can get that of let's see if it's going to work um and we want to uh we we would like to use the scripture here out of just let me get a shorter scripture so that we don't have to read that long a long one that I have here the okay First Corinthians 27 but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew or had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory amen gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy we thank you that we a part of your plan your predestinated plan of what you're doing in this great hour and in this great time we pray that you'll bless us tonight as we go into the word in Jesus name amen amen God bless you I as a pastor I'm just trying to build into you building blocks of life that every night something is added every day something is added so that you can can grow in the grace of God amen amen now who likes a mystery I don't know about you but I take Mysteries amen and human beings are naturally created with a curiosity that anything that stifles them anything that they you know they unknown let me use the word that the unknown actually attracts us if we don't know something we want to know about it we want to know what it is and so we are always attracted uh by Myster but yet we got a little there a little fear also with that mystery we call that reverence from God is Not fright but a little fear a respectful fear because you don't know what it is and so here it is brother sister uh from the beginning of time all creation uh all creation everything that God created whether it be the moon the stars the Earth the the animals the the plants the whatever it is the fishes in the ocean all had one ultimate goal and purpose amen one ultimate go and purpose and that was that uh which is what I want you to know is that God had this purpose that he wanted to have a bride for himself one that could rule and reign with him amen this is what was in his mind now you understand that first of all uh from We Know by The Prophet's message through for knowledge predestination you know calling justification and then we end up with glorification when we get into Glory we're glorified now by the Holy Spirit the proph said but then you really will have the full total Deliverance when you get into the presence of the Lord however here we are now first we were in the mind of God the mind of God spiritually and then we were in Adam naturally amen because God was displaying in Adam the figure the representation of Adam actually what he was doing or going to do in himself amen So Adam came and when he came he had a bride in him right right amen so God was showing you that from the from from eternity from the Eternal uh ages we were in his mind amen you see we were in his mind we he had a bride in him but his bride was in his mind Adam's bride was in him in his side right is that right but then we understand later on brothers and sisters that there God had to make her manifest so we understand now the next thing is that since we were sat down here I can't dwell on all these of course uh we we we were just like other people we living like everybody else we're just humans we living here we we do everything everybody else did we sin we curse we where we li we lost we whatever whatever but then what actually uh God sent out his has his plan where his children would be born again or salvation by Revelation amen amen so that you will begin to know who you are and understand who you are in other words you start to come into an understanding of the mystery am this mystery the Ages which started way in the Eternal Realms and now we start to get an inkling of an understanding of who we are where we come from who our real parent is amen all right we have natural parents but now we not to understand like brother B said I understand I am not really the child the son of Charles and Elam oh great Jehovah you are my father I'm coming home to you see really God is our parent because we are Eternal as he's Eternal am our natural parents are going to die and they're going to go on unless they were a part of this mystery also see but our father is eternal so an eternal father father Eternal children God being almighty God God goats give you know work to goats horse to horse and God to God God Amen Gods that's why he said you are God Miner Miner in other words you have the same traits you got a creative spirit either you want to paint sing whatever because the spirit of creation is on you doesn't matter who who the child is born they want to create take a stick make a snowman or make a sand man or something because they have a part of God uh in them amen and so God starts by now by loing of the seven seal he starts to give an understanding to us an ining of his plan that he had before the world began and that he is revealing to you your life didn't start 20 30 40 50 years ago you there was no time when you were not right you always in him from before the foundation of the world but then he wanted to make you manifest just like when he wanted to make himself manifest he made a body and he stepped into it right but in this case he used a mother and a father to make that body so you can step into it brother said the moment that get St that spirit from God or wherever it come from goes into that child right so here you are you're now in Earth you are now on Earth Daniel said and I looked and I saw Thrones and crowns cast down from the heavens is US Kings and Priests to God and we come down here but what happened by by mother and father your physical body was made you entered into it but that was not the beginning of your existence no you existed as long as God existed and that's for eternally amen amen amen so now we are starting to understand the mystery praise God and as by the revelation of this message as we understand the Myster that is what causes you to be able to enter what is known as Paul calls it The Fellowship of the mystery right amen because once the genuine Revelation I'm not talking about understanding the message I'm talking about catching the genine revelation of Y breaks upon you and you go behind that Veil and you begin to really catch Revelation from the Holy Spirit feeding you him his own word of breaking apart of himself amen right and feeding himself to you amen Jesus but he's the bread of life yes and he gives a part of himself to you praise the Lord and once you begin to understand that and that begins to take a hold of you then there becomes a separation from unbelief amen praise God what am I talking about you might be in the message M you might be even in the church yeah and then you start talking to a fellow uh message believer and you start talking about what God is doing in your life and your understanding of the word amen and as you you talk you are going to sense I can't explain that to you they're not catching what you're talking about amen they're quoting the same words but they're still not catching what you're talking about it's passing right by they're not understanding it whatsoever then you realize wait a minute you in a different dimension even though we got the same message we talking the same same works we still in the same Dimension and only the people who have caught the Revelation to that level can really Fellowship amen it's like let me illustrate uh you can play with your kids when they're two and three years old but you really can't have fellowship with them you see and so when the believer hasn't really caught the revelation right uh fully and it has gotten a hold of them to the point that it scripped them and will let them go now you can't say you didn't know you don't can't say it was revealed to you you can't escape it now it's got a hold of you amen then you enter into what Paul calls The Fellowship of the mystery right where even if you beet a strange a stranger you mean another believer the first time doesn't matter who they are if they are that same fellowship with the mystery you're going to fit like a hand to the glove amen if not the case you're going to be stalk in the word and then you come up against a wall or you come up against something that's you know goes this way or goes that way or it differs you start to enter into the Fellowship of the mystery you really cannot have a genuine Fellowship in other words it's not gathering together in a crowd is fellowship or oh we got to have a fellowship tonight so there's oh a th people oh it was a great Fellowship that doesn't make it a great Fellowship what makes it a Great Fellowship is when in the words of Isaiah in that day The Watchmen of the walls of Zion will begin to see eye to eye right amen you're going to be right on the word and you start to understand it even if you never heard it before when you heard hear it you going know your spirit I had never I had never heard brother bradle I never heard anything about it but then at 16 years old when that message book come in to come to me stuck on my door and I started to read that thing Serpent scen and all this stuff my God I never heard such a thing I didn't understand it but there was something in me that believed it come on you see not my head but my heart I believed it I believed it before I understood it you see and God is telling you the same thing that uh and even I think it was uh John he said and you have a witness you have something in you that will witness back to the world Amen brother puts it this way the Deep will call to the deepen it'll call right back there something starts going on between you and the word and then when you get to that place you'll feel it even coming from the pulpit it'll go back and forth back and forth between you and the word coming off of the pulpit what is it it's the holy spirit amen be record to the word of God amen amen praise the Lord then after you begin to understand the Fellowship of the mystery and break into it praise the Lord that is when you yourself begin uh to become a revelation of that mystery am I making sense here I don't want to be talking to myself because I get carried away and then you know I just keep talking but you become a revelation of the word you're not going to try to be a Christian no you're not going to try to be to reveal the word you're not going to try to have patience Temperance brotherly kindness godliness oh you got to have perfect love that's good but the fact is who by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature you can't really add one cubit to his stature he said oh but Peter said to your faith add patience add this add that wow what he's talking about is not you going into to make more but it's meaning that you need to grow into the stature of Christ just as much as long as you feed your child they going to be adding height they going to be adding weight they going to be adding wisdom they're going to be you see it's just going to be that way it's not you sticking something onto them a bird feather or a dove feather and telling them they a dove and now they're Christian that's not the way it works it's the word that brings it out and then you just live your life amen naturally super naturally M because the holy spirit in you is going to make your life a supernatural one even though you're living naturally like everybody else amen and so you become a revelation praise God now why because Christ is the mystery of God being reveal but you are you must understand you are a part of him so the headship came and revealed himself now it's the bride part of God that is revealing herself and if you understand uh what I'm really talking about here I really haven't even gotten to it I'm just um give background but the fact is I'm talking about the bride I'm talking about you and I I'm talking about the church the church was a mystery that God hid from Satan and the princes of this world he hid it even from the prophets and the Patriarchs even most of the Jewish Patriarchs did not know that God was going to have a gentile bride because he himself he told the Jews they must marry Jews they must they must marry with their Jewish thing but then if you watch the tipes and the Shadows you watch the very Patriots that are acting out God and dis playing and representing God this one go and marry to an Ethiopian the next one marry a midianite the next one marry a woman from AI you know you what's going on God just told him to marry all within the certain boundary but then you see it's tiped out there amen coming all the way down to fulfill his purpose which is in the book of Acts when Peter said it that this mystery was hi because God was going to call out of the Gentiles a people for his name amen hallelujah a people for his name that we would be married to him praise God that he bypass all others and marry a gentile bride and the times are right there whe it's RAB R you you know you can come you through the Bible yourself he was short it was literally right in front of them and they still couldn't understand because it wasn't the time for it to be made known or to be revealed but now is the time for us to understand so we can enter in The Fellowship of the mystery and recognize we are a part of that and the Bride is a part of the revelation of Christ Hallelujah yes for we are the bright part of him Amen brother puts it this way she is him revealed praise God she is him revealed glory to God hallelujah I'm so glad that I can say I'm amen praise the Lord and every day you know I said wow I read all the books I heard all the Tes my goodness I've gone over the church age books so many times until my church AG book is falling apart from the marks I don't have any more space to put any more notes and everything else and you said well this is it you know it's going to come to it can't come to an end because it's God Amen is all right yes and Revelation keeps unfolding not that it's going to come with something different contrary to the world or mysterious or something like that but it will unfold the same word and make you see it in different lights different angles different colors of the rainbow you know Lightnings Thunders coming off of the Throne of God's word so that you can recognize it's all God amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah so uh first of all we know our place we have to know place that we are we are that mystery of the angel amen you and I that's what was hidden from from the devil that we were going to be here and we were going to be manifesting Christ when you hear Brother speak and say oh the Mighty God unveil before us oh lots of people think it's him right oh the Mighty God unveiled before us the word is now being revealed to us in this hour praise God the Mighty God is on Veil before us he really was pointing to the bride now being on veil by the word that he was preaching amen he was lifting the veil off of her so she could know herself and so people could know her and that she could be made known to the world praise the Lord and it's going on right now because all of the Bride is not in yet Hallelujah so they're still being called out and still being unveiled the unveiling of the might God the unveiling of the Bride is taking place and of course the unveiling of the word is still taking place and of course the Lord himself is still revealing himself amen hallelujah and we are a part of this thing uh like I've said before to you uh not to you personally sister I talk like that and I point I'm not talking to you in eventually but I'm talking to you as a as a group God is up to something big amen and glad I'm a part of it now you know what this something big is and you are a part of that mystery of God now being revealed glory to God hallelujah oh glorious mystery that day he set me free and turn my heart into his very home oh my what an hour what a time what a season that we could know who we are recognize our position and know where we are going hallelujah amen this is not my chance it didn't happen unanticipated but let me mention when you come down as an eternal spirit your mom and your dad were used by God produced the body you entered in it and right away you become trapped in time I think it's in the future home brother gram said trapped in a body all time amen calls it a city so you're trapped we got trapped in this body now why would he say trap because your spirit was like God's spirit there was no walls there I mean the wall wouldn't be an object for you to see beyond it or feel or hear or do whatever because you were a part of him but now you have self-consciousness you're in a body you have location because you're in a body you you you you have a you have only a small space you occupy because you are in a body and so on this is what happened so we actually are trapped in time like the message we preached sometime ago we are here actually doing time right we are doing time right now by the grace of God so here we are so but this didn't not by accident amen what God is trying to tell us that this is part of his blood amen so whatever you're going through while you're here on Earth uh while it seems like Peter said uh so terrible right now to you the triy of your faith Works patience and the end of it is getting you ready for going back where you come from that's right amen yes Lord hallelujah every seeding for B and the cycle continues to bring another seed and another seed and you come from God and go back to God that's a certainty that that's a certainty just as much as H2O is water doesn't matter how you work the formula is got to come back to water and if you are a part of him you're coming back to him and there's no devil in hell can stop is that right doesn't matter what you go through what back sliding what this what that somebody CAU you doing this what's that mean amen that of course you you repent you're sorry whatever but it doesn't upset God's plan thank you no matter what the devil does now he can't upset God's plan that's why he shed the blood the blood was shed to eradicate to erase to wipe away everything the devil will do to try to upset God's plan he can't do it God oh if the princes of this world knew they would never crucify the Lord of glory amen we are not here by accident glory to God Amen you understand that he's been building this image this body uh through endless ages and that you and I are God's Masterpiece amen you and I are God's Masterpiece here we are the Masterpiece of God look we are going to have un bailing when we come to the end praise God now we hid amongst all the other people people right now we hidden amongst them but there's going to be a day when we going to be unveiled by the great artist and the world will recognize us for who we are amen praise the Lord glory to God hallelujah amen amen you can read Romans 8 and Ephesians 1 glory to God hallelujah amen now First Corinthians 27 and 8 said but we speak wisdom even his wisdom which for God ordained before the world unto our Glory you understand what that means that God hidden the word the revelation of the word hidden wisdom hidden before the foundation of the world knowing that his genuine children when they have caught that hidden wisdom it glorifies them it giv it glorifies them puts you into a when glorified which none of the princes of this world knew for had they know it they would not have broken the seven seal they would not have uh crucified the Lord Of Glory of course what I'm saying there is that physically he was the Seal of the Father the father was in him and when he got crucified of Calvary it was a symbol or a type also that one day he the seven seal would be broken and the blood that was in that seal like it was physically shed back there would now be shed or set free praise the Lord so that you could receive it brother R said of course we know the blood it's not the red blood back there he said it's the Holy Ghost right it's the Holy Ghost amen and the church is the blood of Christ by the holy spirit being in her amen hallelujah what allows you to catch this mystery except a man be born again amen he cannot see the kingdom of God hallelujah then again he said uh in the same uh chapter except a man be born again he cannot enter the kingdom of God you can go read it in John chapter 3 two times he talks about being born again and the effects of being born again is forced to make you see and then to make you enter Because if you can't see how you going to find the door to enter you first of all have to give you Revelation open your eyes open your understanding and then you can enter praise God salvation is by Revelation glory to God Amen so now listen to this the apostles they had to catch the Revelation before they can break in that's what happened to them them under their Pentecost listen Ephesians 3:9 Paul speaking and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory to God so God's ultimate goal was to create uh some persons to inhabit eternity with him someone that he could share with and have fellowship with and that he could love and I would love him praise the Lord hallelujah thank god brother and sister that we are the children of God Amen not uh not an animal not a beast not something else because you fellowship with something on your own level of being right you can't fellowship with a monkey or a parot that only can repeat the message you you can't fellowship with my or or something else you have to fellowship with a being on the same level amen praise the Lord amen so here it is amen God had a desire to have a bride from way back there and like I told you he has been working on that right through all these endless ages amen and that is the mystery of the ages not only tracing the serpent seed but tracing the seed of righteousness that's coming down right on Amen the mystery of godliness coming right from Genesis from eternity down to Genesis right on to this very time the mystery of godliness praise God hallelujah amen so that is why we have been predestinated to be here in this season and in this time for this hour and we are the last part of God's body that was being built through the ages of the body of the second Adam the second Adam's wife being built Through the Ages we are the last part of it right because he started way back there with Paul of them praise God and started building that body and then you know the devil tried to give him a setback in the Dark Ages and stuff and then you know he continued his job and brother Bron goes through that is showing you stature of a perfect man until we come right down to this last Church age that we are in Ephesians uh says here in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of his him that worketh all things after the comfor of his will praise God predestinated we are the bride is called what the family of God family of God blood relations in other words it's like the Bible he's telling you your blood relations with him you are part of the family of God Amen God's blood is Spirit the Holy Spirit brother V say God doesn't have chemical blood he went into a body so that you could recognize that he bled something out but when he when that bleeding was finished he said he gave up the ghost right and the Holy Ghost is the token which is the spirit blood if you want to say it that way of God Amen that's made available to us now and we are the family of God Amen Hallelujah but not only are your family the bride is described as the God's house many scriptures no he not through the temple and so on many many scriptures Revelation when it says for the habitation of God is not with man and I will dwell in them and walk in them and I they shall be my people and I will be their God hallelujah so we are the house of God but listen any house being built has to have a foundation that's right is that right if you going to build a building it has to have a foundation if you're going to build even a family that has to have a foundation any individual their character has to have a foundation amen or just be wish Wasing you got to have a foundation even in your character praise be to God hallelujah and the building the family the the individual and their life or their existence is going to be no better than the foundation of what which it rests foundations are important amen because you're want to BU a super structure which is why Jesus illustration illustration about God building on the sand the other one building on the Rock be cure what you build on Paul speaks and said be careful what you build onless when you come to an end you finish the building and you think it's okay you know and it's tested by fire it's tested by this and that the whole thing crumbles because you didn't pay attention to your foundation to make sure it was the genuine revelation of the hour and that is what you're built on the foundation praise the Lord amen and so we know that the foundation of this entire mystery is the revelation of who Jesus is amen his the ENT the identification of our Lord Jesus Christ that is not just a prophet he's not a passing scholar he's not a philosopher he's not just the wise man he's not the greatest salesman in the world he's not the deepest Lodge man he's not the wisest teacher but he is the god of the prophets amen God come down to be his own Propet Jesus amen almighty God one God and his name is Jesus Christ amen and everything is built on that you see uh if the the picture of the pyramid glory to God uh the picture of the pyramid uh that we usually have up there it starts with the slier and the foundation brother R put Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so that's the foundation that we built on praise God but we're not building on the man Jesus Christ because Jesus came to do what Ral the father or reveal God we're building on the revelation of who he is flesh and blood has not revealed on but my Father in Heaven has revealed on you amen and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of H not against the revelation of who he is praise the Lord hallelujah amen so the entire mystery of the genuine true church rests not on itn't rest on indulgences 1 Stations of the Cross it doesn't rest upon any history of man it rests entirely upon the foundations of the Apostles and the prophet and the Great Indian chief chief Corone uh is built on him Christ the Chief Cornerstone the one rejected the stone a great preacher by the name of I believe his name was uh J Parker preached a message called uh the rejected Stone and what he said is notice in the Scripture it says the stone the Builder is rejected he says these were not ignorant people these were trained Builders they're supposed to know how to recognize the good Stone and the properly place it when they're building something but for some reason they looked at this Stone and don't bite it and they just didn't include it in their building and you know whatever re built is got is going to all come down soety is going to come down every structure that man builds is coming down the world is falling apart and the only thing that will stand is the word of our God that will stand forever forever 1 Corinthians 3 10-13 amen [Music] according to what God has given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another bill there on what's he talking about Paul already knew other Messengers will come after you and that he would do his job and leave a foundation the next messenger was come and build on that the next one will come and build on that and build on that but I am laying my part now as a wise master builder praise God you see and another build it there on but let every man take heed how he builds there on hallelujah praise the Lord what is he saying there he saying stay in the word be careful how you're building and don't move away from the word be careful how you build on the foundation that I done for other Foundation can no man lay there is no other Foundation that you can lay it's got to be as as Isaiah said word brother BR said word on top of word Isaiah said it word on top of word here a little there a little here a little there a little but it's got to be word on top of word it can't be anything else right glory to God hallelujah now if any man build upon this Foundation go okay you bringing P silver ceremony right glory to God this message is in there we can preach on how when Solomon left Shields of gold to protect the Empire after he start to he left the seed you know they they melt down the shields of gold and and they put back the shame shap but now the shields were in syver and then when they're out of money again this oh my God they melt down the silver and they end up with shields of brass and and the entire thing become a mockery that's the type of the modern church the church how been going through the ages and devaluing the word of God right devaluing the word of God until now you know that they valued it to such a point that when you try to share it with people they think there's no value to their life listening to any Bible or any picture or or anything to them they don't think there's any value to it there's the value that effectively by their their various uh Corruptions deceit false teachings and everything else uh cly divid his fables Hallelujah because every man's work shall be made manifest oh it might look shiny and fantastic and wonderful but when it gets tested see then you find that the gold melts the silver melts and everything else praise God hallelujah amen but what part of that mystery are you what part of the Myster you God can use you in different ways now um God may use one of us as a window is that right you may use you as a window just to give somebody a glimpse that they can get curious about this message and look in at the word of God Amen I want to know what is in there what's in that house what's in that church what's in these people God God can use you as a window others of us God uses us as a door we're literally like a Shepherd like a minister people can actually enter in through you get born again baptized and everything else God can use you as a door like that see each believer have uh various uh different position H but when we find our place we fit the together in harmony amen praise the Lord I Hope none of you feel your way time of theight Amen praise the Lord I hope you're benefiting from it amen glory to his name I so down when I'm taking my time because I'm like a carpenter tonight that's not just rushing but I want to make sure that when I bang brother bam said a good Carpenter will hit a second time sometimes a third time to make sure the nail clinches P amen now praise God now I think it's caught glory to God can't move it amen praise the Lord look at this I can't move this hallelujah amen that's the way it is praise the Lord listen to Ephesians [Music] 2:21 we are a building of course fitly framed together fitly framed together Hallelujah you know uh it says that Solomon when the temple was built there wasn't a sound of sawing and banging and all this stuff but yet when the stones were put together and even though when you go to Israel there certain parts of those stones of course weather wears some of them away but some of them you still can't put take a piece of paper and stick in between there that's right even though one of the stones are like long like from from the pit here to that back wall that's right and like 5 ft high and they don't know how they move them and fit them one on the other and you still can't sometimes get a piece of paper to go in between them right see so when it says fitly framed together properly fitted and placed together they're so close knit amen they're close to one another they're built up praise God frame together into a growing together into a holy Temple in the Lord Holy Temple in the Lord in my father's house are many brother R says bodies he say Mansions he says bodies we are God's house in my father's house there are many bodies there are many mansions many rooms praise the Lord hallelujah huah and I'm glad I'm a part of that amen praise God listen Hebrews 36 tells us this whose house we are amen we are a part of that mystery yes sir and the Revelation lives in the mystery God in Christ he said Christ in the church the kingdom in restor Back to Eden again Adam and Eve walking again not in the natural one but in the Edom of God up there walking together for his glory furthermore let's give another scripture first Peter 2:5 we as Lively stones are built up into a spiritual house in other words all the translations agree with this we as living stones you restor and you're living and God takes you and fits you and you find your your place in the body of Christ in the temple of God that he's building amen my mother love to sing an old song that fits right with what I'm saying it just came to my memory we are we are building day by day as the moments fly away a temple the world cannot see every Victory won by Grace it is sure to find a place in our building for eternity amen so every day we're building and we're finding our places and we're fitting we are living stones hallelujah what does that mean a living Stone praise God you you're not a living uh you're a living stone that Finds Its place I I was just going to go off there into something but here you're finding your place as a living Stone in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen Peter was called what Petra what does Petra mean stone or Rock Amen here you are so you are a living Stone praise God hallelujah built up into a spiritual house according to First Peter 2:5 amen praise the Lord now here's what I was running ahead of myself but you know that a stone is different from a brick how many knows that amen amen can anybody here tell me the difference between a stone and a brick
