[19:13] Oh night divine.
[19:16] [music]
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:19] Oh night divine. Oh night divine. Listen
[19:22] to this verse. Brother speaking here in
[19:25] white little Bethlehem. He says what we
[19:27] need today is a fresh pouring out of the
[19:29] Holy Spirit upon our hearts.
[19:33] That's humble. He said, "We need a real
[19:35] Christmas, a birthplace."
[19:37] If you could realize that you're nothing
[19:39] but a stable.
[19:42] Nothing but a stable. [snorts] God
[19:44] didn't go to Jerusalem, to Shiloh, to
[19:47] Ramadillion, [music]
[19:48] all those places. He said they were they
[19:50] were the high places in in Jerusalem. He
[19:52] said he didn't go there. He went to
[19:54] Bethlehem. [music] He said he he came to
[19:57] a stable that was polluted.
[20:00] When you let God become and you realize
[20:02] yourself is [music] nothing but a
[20:04] stinking stable and you open your doors
[20:10] when these great places and ends are
[20:12] turning him away. Open your doors of
[20:16] your manger of your heart
[20:18] and let Jehovah come into that and watch
[20:21] what takes place for he is the word. He
[20:24] said if you abide in me and my word
[20:27] abide in you, he is the word. Let him
[20:29] come into you and watch what takes
[20:31] place. Then ask what you will and it
[20:36] shall be done
[20:38] e flat.
[20:42] And so let your word
[20:46] be [music] born
[20:48] in the manger of my heart. [music]
[20:53] Let it live in me. that it's time
[21:00] live inside [music] this house of clay
[21:05] and mold it every day. [music]
[21:09] That's your word
[21:12] [music] in the [singing] manger.
[21:19] It was a time to stay [music]
[21:24] on or beaten and warm
[21:28] hardly [music] a place
[21:31] for a king to be born.
[21:35] He didn't do something [music]
[21:37] special
[21:39] to reveal his majesty. [music]
[21:43] So I know he gave control.
[21:47] He'll be born in [music] me.
[21:50] So let your word
[21:54] be born [music]
[21:56] in the manger of my heart.
[22:00] Let it live in me. Let it [music] stop.
[22:06] Oh live inside this house of clay.
[22:10] [music] I know it every day
[22:15] that your word [music] be [singing] born
[22:18] in the mure
[22:20] of [music] my life while I'm
[22:25] well outwardly
[22:29] [music] not much to behold
[22:33] unlikely the place
[22:36] [music] for his word to unfold.
[22:40] But if you just [music] heal this vessel
[22:44] and let him have his way
[22:47] from glory [music] on to glory,
[22:51] he'll change me day by day.
[22:55] Oh, let your [music] word be born
[23:00] in the manger of my heart. [music]
[23:04] Let it live in me. Let it s
[23:10] [music]
[23:11] live inside this house of clay
[23:15] [music] and mold it every day. [singing]
[23:19] Let your world be born
[23:22] in the manger.
[23:26] [music]
[23:28] Live inside this house of clay
[23:33] and mold it [music] every day. [singing]
[23:37] Let your word be born
[23:40] in the manger. [music]
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love him this morning.

[50:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. God bless you,
[50:44] Brother David. Nice to see you. Amen. So
[50:48] we um we continue to keep the saints in
[50:50] prayer that uh that have been sick and
[50:53] you know um afflicted amongst us.
[50:56] Continue to pray for them. remember
[50:58] sister Sheila, she had um you know a
[51:01] situation that came up this week, but
[51:03] the Lord came on the scene again. Amen.
[51:06] and raised this standard. you know, from
[51:09] one moment uh having to be in the
[51:12] hospital and they had detected that uh
[51:15] you know that there some sort of a virus
[51:18] had attacked her and was attacking her
[51:20] even in her brain and um that they had
[51:24] prepared they were doing tests and they
[51:26] had prepared uh and had a an ambulance
[51:30] helicopter on standby there at the
[51:33] hospital waiting um you know based on
[51:35] the results that because if it had hit a
[51:37] certain percentage of the viral
[51:39] infection, she would have had to been
[51:41] rushed uh immediately to uh Toronto um
[51:45] Western.
[51:47] But the results came back and they came
[51:49] back miraculously.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just in a short period of time,
[51:54] God came on the scene and so um the
[51:57] situation was uh completely
[52:00] uh changed in a moment and so she's back
[52:05] home with the family. continue to keep
[52:07] her in prayer. Uh continue to remember
[52:10] Sister Deborah as she continues to heal.
[52:13] Amen. Um we we believe in the power of
[52:18] God to heal and restore
[52:21] &gt;&gt; perfectly.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, let's just keep
[52:26] believing and let's keep under
[52:28] expectation. Glory to God. And so, um,
[52:33] we're just going to, uh, watch a quick
[52:34] video as an introduction video to, um,
[52:37] our Christmas service today. You may be
[52:40] seated. Sorry to keep you standing, but
[52:43] you'll be seated for a while now anyway.
[52:46] Amen.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music]
[53:23] [music]
[53:29] [music]
[53:35] [music]
[53:41] Heat. Heat. N. [music]
[54:33] Amen. Let's all stand and read the word
[54:35] of God.
[54:39] Today we're going to be looking at the
[54:41] power to become. Amen. And then you can
[54:45] you can add to that uh many different
[54:48] aspects um of to become we know
[54:53] ultimately we are sons and daughters of
[54:56] God but we have the power we've been
[54:59] given the power to become overcomers.
[55:02] We've been given the power to become uh
[55:05] you know mediators,
[55:10] testimonies to the world and especially
[55:12] at a time like this at Christmas. Amen.
[55:15] Glory to God. And so this is the season
[55:18] of Christmas and it invites us to
[55:20] prepare our hearts. Amen. For the wonder
[55:25] of the coming of the Lord. Amen. This is
[55:28] what Christmas was uh is based on the
[55:33] coming of the Lord. Amen. God becoming
[55:36] flesh to dwell among us. Amen. So that
[55:40] we in turn may become children of God,
[55:45] sons and daughters of the king,
[55:47] transformed, redeemed by the word and by
[55:51] his grace. Amen. Now, we all know that
[55:55] December is not actually the time
[56:00] of his birth. Amen.
[56:03] His birth was in in the spring. Amen.
[56:06] Praise God. That's when shepherds are in
[56:09] the fields
[56:10] &gt;&gt; with their sheep. They're not there in
[56:12] the in the middle of winter. Amen. And
[56:15] so we we know that, but that's
[56:18] irrelevant because we recognize
[56:20] Christmas as something that we
[56:22] experience and we celebrate every day.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Because Christmas is to worship Christ.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Glenn. Welcome
[56:31] back, brother. Amen. You're looking
[56:34] good. You're looking all healthy and
[56:37] strong. Praise God. Let's read the word
[56:39] of God. Scripture is from St. John
[56:42] 1:es 10-14.
[56:45] It says he was in the world and the
[56:48] world was made by him and the world knew
[56:52] him not. He came unto his own and his
[56:57] own received him not. But as many as
[57:00] received him, to them gave he power to
[57:04] become
[57:05] &gt;&gt; the sons of God. Even to them that
[57:08] believe on his name, which were born not
[57:11] of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
[57:14] nor of the will of man, but of God.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Word was made flesh and
[57:21] dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory,
[57:24] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[57:28] father, full of grace and truth.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father,
[57:35] Lord, we realize this time of year is a
[57:38] time where the world kind of comes into
[57:41] a focus of recognizing you, Lord. But in
[57:47] the ways of tradition, in the ways of of
[57:51] uh Lord doing things
[57:55] commercially and and uh Lord making it a
[57:59] time where it's just mostly about
[58:01] parties and about the giving of gifts to
[58:04] one another. But Lord, the greatest gift
[58:08] that that man could have ever received,
[58:11] Lord, we seem to uh put it aside and,
[58:16] you know, not give it the glory and the
[58:19] victory and the and the uh praise that
[58:22] that it deserves, Father, the gift of
[58:24] your life coming for your children. And
[58:29] Lord, we ask that you would just take
[58:30] control of the service now. Bless your
[58:32] people, Lord. Let this uh service be um
[58:38] a time of of uh looking within ourselves
[58:42] and searching within our hearts and
[58:44] really uh understanding the purpose and
[58:47] the meaning of Christmas. Lord, may it
[58:49] become a greater reality to us as we
[58:53] feed and as we uh uh
[58:57] ponder upon your word. Grant it we pray.
[58:59] Father take control speaker and hearers
[59:03] in Jesus Christ's name.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. God bless you. May be
[59:07] seated.
[59:11] Glory to God. Amen. The scripture says
[59:13] he was in the world.
[59:16] It's so incredible. God became man.
[59:19] Word became flesh.
[59:22] Eternal became time bound. Imagine God
[59:26] the creator became created in human
[59:29] form. It describes perhaps the greatest
[59:34] downward movement ever conceived where
[59:37] God would condescend from his
[59:41] self-existence
[59:43] from his spirit
[59:45] to where he would condescend to become
[59:49] and to be with man. Amen.
[59:53] Glory to God. Not just to be a baby,
[59:57] to be a single cell planted inside a
[1:00:00] young woman's body,
[1:00:02] but to become God, the word made flesh
[1:00:06] so that he could make a way back for his
[1:00:09] children to be restored back to their
[1:00:12] rightful positions as sons and daughters
[1:00:15] of God. Amen. Glory to God. There's an
[1:00:19] unspeakable mystery here that we all
[1:00:22] recognize that we all, you know, when we
[1:00:25] sing it in the song, veiled in flesh,
[1:00:29] the Godhead see.
[1:00:31] Oh, the incarnate deity pleased as man
[1:00:34] with men to dwell. Jesus, our Emmanuel.
[1:00:40] Amen. Praise God. It's a song that's
[1:00:42] sung every day at Christmas, you know,
[1:00:45] at Christmas time. Emmanuel. Emmanuel,
[1:00:48] but do they understand
[1:00:50] the mystery? You know, when we read here
[1:00:54] from from St. John,
[1:00:56] we see here that um you know that he
[1:00:59] doesn't he doesn't uh bring the
[1:01:02] scripture in the same way that it's you
[1:01:04] know that that we hear it in Luke and
[1:01:06] and um you know, Mark and Matthew where
[1:01:10] it describes all the events and how the
[1:01:12] angel came to the Virgin Mary and
[1:01:14] everything else. John just goes right to
[1:01:17] the point because John had a revelation
[1:01:21] of the mystery. You know, that's why
[1:01:24] John was different than the rest of the
[1:01:26] disciples. Amen. He had a a a a spirit
[1:01:30] of revelation upon him to recognize that
[1:01:33] the word was more than what the people
[1:01:36] had been reading about.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; You know, he says he says here that he
[1:01:42] was in the world. He He's like he's
[1:01:44] proclaiming, listen, this is God. God
[1:01:48] had come down and he was in the world.
[1:01:51] Amen. And and the world was actually
[1:01:53] made by him.
[1:01:56] Glory to God. It's what a tremendous
[1:01:59] revelation to know, you know, that what
[1:02:02] like what what the true meaning of
[1:02:04] Christ is, the true meaning of
[1:02:06] Christmas, the the the real uh
[1:02:09] significance that's that's taken a hold
[1:02:12] of our lives to the point where now we
[1:02:15] we live for him. We seek him. We we we
[1:02:20] talk about him. We can't we can't
[1:02:21] fellowship about the things of the world
[1:02:24] for too long. We have to bring him into
[1:02:26] the fellowship. Amen. Glory to God. He
[1:02:29] came to his own and his own received him
[1:02:32] not. But as many as received him, he
[1:02:37] gave the power.
[1:02:39] What power? The power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to read a quote here from
[1:02:46] uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:02:48] because John had a tremendous
[1:02:51] understanding on the word of God. And we
[1:02:53] thank God that the Lord has sent us a
[1:02:57] prophet in our day. Amen. That would
[1:03:00] give us light upon the word of God and
[1:03:03] allow us to have that same spirit of
[1:03:05] revelation. Here he says the first thing
[1:03:08] was that God wanted to reveal himself to
[1:03:12] the people. He couldn't do it as the
[1:03:15] great Jehovah God who covered all space,
[1:03:18] time, and eternity. He could not. He is
[1:03:21] too great to ever be revealed to people
[1:03:24] because it would be too mysterious. How
[1:03:27] could that great being that never did
[1:03:30] begin? Amen. That that after you went
[1:03:34] beyond the cycle of a hundreds of
[1:03:36] billions and trillions and trillions of
[1:03:39] years of light space and on on out into
[1:03:43] the infinite into the eternity. and a
[1:03:46] great creature that was all that and
[1:03:50] still is.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Next slide. But but
[1:03:55] what he wanted to do, he loved
[1:03:58] fatherhood.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; For he was a father.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And the only way that he could express
[1:04:04] it was to become a son of man.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had to take on human flesh. He
[1:04:12] had to come and be one of us so that we
[1:04:16] could be one of him.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. That's the reason
[1:04:21] Jesus kept saying the son of man.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; They did see they didn't know what he
[1:04:27] was talking about many of them. But now
[1:04:31] you get it.
