[4:24] ready to be revealed in
[4:28] the last time thanks be to god friends
[4:32] we live in tremendous and momentous
[4:36] times as we will all be conscious of
[4:39] that
[4:40] great earth-shaking events
[4:43] are unfolding even as we speak
[4:49] great uh cataclysmic
[4:53] events are now in progress
[4:57] events with prophetic
[5:01] outlook on out are now
[5:04] in progress they vary earth
[5:08] and all the world systems
[5:13] and all the nations are experiencing
[5:17] the the burp pains of a
[5:21] new a brand new millennium
[5:24] is just about to dawn
[5:28] as one ends another one
[5:32] is about to be born now these tumultuous
[5:36] times in which we
[5:37] live are significant as coming events
[5:41] are casting their shadows
[5:43] upon the curtains of time
[5:47] these events
[5:50] these supernatural signs
[5:53] that are upon the earth lights
[5:57] mysterious lights appearing
[6:00] mysterious happenings upon the face of
[6:03] the earth
[6:05] earthquakes tidal waves typhoons
[6:09] hurricanes pestilences
[6:13] uh all manner of strange events
[6:17] in nature earth and sky
[6:21] are taking place
[6:25] and so friends these things
[6:28] are here and these
[6:31] are all emerging changes
[6:35] in the flow of human history
[6:39] now we know we are living in the
[6:43] sixth millennium
[6:46] i believe of course that our lord jesus
[6:49] christ
[6:50] returns towards the ending towards the
[6:53] ending
[6:55] of the sixth millennium which we are in
[6:58] at this time now
[7:01] we realize that the that that the word
[7:04] six
[7:05] the the word the number six is the
[7:09] number of men so we know we're living in
[7:13] man's day this is
[7:14] not the lord's day as yet but it's man's
[7:18] day
[7:19] where it's man's ideas minds inventions
[7:22] man's science man's wisdom
[7:26] even man's uh church that he has
[7:29] shaped through the figment of his
[7:31] imagination
[7:32] and his interpretation from the word of
[7:35] god
[7:36] into a system of what he think god
[7:40] uh loves or god will want
[7:43] just like cain making an altar
[7:46] a beautiful and a beautiful system but
[7:50] he thinks that because of the beauty of
[7:52] it that's what will make god
[7:54] love it but here was bell with a
[7:58] raw rugged uh significant
[8:01] gospel the slaying of a lamb
[8:04] the blood spraying everywhere oh my god
[8:08] how could that be
[8:10] a sign of the messiah to come but it
[8:13] was a prophetic symbol and sign
[8:18] of the coming lamb of god that will be
[8:21] taking away the sins of the world and
[8:25] god abel god made
[8:28] about by revelation to
[8:32] recognize what the plan of god
[8:36] was that since by sin
[8:39] came man it had to be god coming in the
[8:43] form
[8:43] of a man to deliver the entire
[8:46] human race and so we come back to the
[8:50] fact that this number
[8:51] six and 666
[8:54] everyone knows that and the number six
[8:58] relates to man
[9:00] for it is the number of men and we
[9:04] live in the man's day
[9:07] and man's time now we realize
[9:10] friends that uh millennium
[9:14] when we use the word millennium comes
[9:16] from the latin word mille
[9:18] which means one thousand one thousand so
[9:22] we said the sixth millennium 6000
[9:25] years as far as we know of the world
[9:29] the earth's existence is what we're
[9:32] talking about
[9:33] that we are living in that sixth
[9:36] millennium
[9:37] praise god hallelujah and so the fifth
[9:40] millennium
[9:42] has passed already and we are now
[9:45] in the sixth one every two thousand
[9:49] years a clap
[9:50] christmas or event takes place
[9:54] something terrible happens and now
[9:57] living in the
[9:58] sixth millennium
[10:02] two two thousand year periods have
[10:05] already passed
[10:07] second millennium fourth millennium now
[10:09] we're in the sixth millennium
[10:11] at the end of each something tremendous
[10:14] happened
[10:15] now we're almost to the ending of the
[10:19] sixth millennium something is fixing to
[10:22] take place
[10:24] my friends with this awareness as human
[10:28] beings
[10:29] have we lost any sense
[10:32] of god have we lost the sense
[10:35] of the supernatural have we any
[10:38] spiritual intelligence to recognize
[10:42] that there is something eventful
[10:46] fixing to their place even when there is
[10:49] an
[10:49] earthquake or some terrible
[10:53] a storm coming the animals
[10:56] the nature knows it long before human
[11:00] beings
[11:01] are even aware of it as god said the
[11:04] stark knows the time of my coming the
[11:06] swallow knows the time of my coming
[11:09] but my people knows not the
[11:12] judgments of the lord may god help us
[11:16] to regain the supernatural intelligence
[11:19] that we lost from the garden of eden
[11:22] when
[11:22] man sinned against god and
[11:26] fell into this state of ruin
[11:29] and in despair so here we are
[11:33] in the sixth millennium
[11:37] and the signs on the earth are pointing
[11:41] to it at this particular time
[11:45] in the first millennium the first
[11:47] thousand years
[11:48] well it was a time of change when the
[11:51] millennium
[11:51] comes to its end a time of tremendous
[11:55] change
[11:56] and we understand at that time the world
[11:59] was flooded out
[12:01] the world was flooded out oh my
[12:05] and there was we're noah
[12:08] which jesus said that time of noah
[12:12] will repeat again back there
[12:15] they were trying to build a castle
[12:18] a building that will go right up into
[12:22] the heavens
[12:23] uh and they uh it was really a form of
[12:26] rebellion of satan
[12:27] that he is going to find a way even
[12:30] though he was cast out
[12:31] he will now find an artificial way
[12:35] to climb up back into the presence
[12:39] of almighty god but it was not possible
[12:42] for god broke the entire thing down
[12:46] and later as we know there was great
[12:49] a flooding that took place upon
[12:52] we understand flooding that took place
[12:54] upon the face of the earth
[12:56] now recognize men today are actually
[12:58] trying to do the same things
[13:00] doing it by rocket ships doing it by
[13:03] satellites
[13:04] but god already spoke in the book of
[13:06] isaiah
[13:07] though you go up and try to make your
[13:10] nest your home among the stars lo
[13:13] i shall bring thee down oh may god have
[13:17] mercy upon us
[13:18] to recognize now speaking on this first
[13:22] millennium the world was flooded
[13:25] and no was the man that was
[13:29] used for that moment
[13:32] now my emphasis today is to let you
[13:36] know whoever you are brother sister no
[13:39] matter how
[13:40] insignificant you think you are
[13:43] god has you here on time
[13:46] in this age on the earth in this place
[13:50] and position
[13:51] for his divine purpose to fulfill
[13:54] the manifestation of his word
[13:58] and so you and i we together
[14:02] are the people for this moment
[14:05] you are the person that god has placed
[14:08] here
[14:08] for this moment along with your other
[14:11] brothers and sisters we were
[14:14] predestinated by the
[14:16] hand of god to be here upon the earth
[14:18] for
[14:19] this hour and to meet every challenge of
[14:22] the enemy
[14:23] every doubt every fear and to overcome
[14:26] them
[14:27] by the manifestation of the word of god
[14:30] through our lives thank god for noah
[14:34] who was a ignore of the word
[14:38] he was open to the revelation
[14:41] of the holy spirit of the living god
[14:44] at that time as in our time
[14:49] the imagination of men's hearts were
[14:51] evil
[14:54] man's heart the bible says were evil
[14:57] continually
[14:59] figuring out all vain imaginations
[15:02] of schemes and tricks whatever it was
[15:07] the bible said violence covered the land
[15:10] what what a culture we are living in now
[15:14] guns murder mass murder
[15:17] death on every hand bloodshed
[15:21] blood flowing in our streets death and
[15:24] violence everywhere all the works
[15:28] of man's hand yes sir
[15:31] and then noah
[15:35] being on the scene he had a destiny
[15:40] and being armed with the revealed word
[15:42] of god for his day
[15:44] he withstood all the armies of satan
[15:48] and stood unashamed as one man
[15:52] in the door of that ark and before he
[15:56] even
[15:56] built the ark he announced god told him
[15:59] to build an ark
[16:00] he was made a mocking stock a
[16:02] laughingstock
[16:03] how are you going to escape how are you
[16:05] going to get out of here
[16:07] and more than that no are you building
[16:10] an
[16:10] ark on top of a mountain you you would
[16:13] want to build it in the valley
[16:14] but no he knew what god had said
[16:18] and god's thoughts are far above our
[16:21] thoughts
[16:22] so he was obeying the word of the living
[16:24] god
[16:25] so noah preached the gospel for 120
[16:29] years
[16:30] noah built the ark as a way of escape
[16:34] and we are here today as the persons of
[16:38] this moment to declare the word of the
[16:41] lord
[16:42] a way of escape for you a way of escape
[16:45] for anyone
[16:46] and there is still room at the cross for
[16:50] you
[16:50] if you come to him now and find your
[16:54] place and position in the kingdom of god
[16:57] even if you are already a believer ask
[17:01] god to reveal to you his prime purpose
[17:04] for your
[17:05] life your activity that you may with
[17:08] certainty go about the purposes of god
[17:12] and then god will bless you and anoint
[17:15] you
[17:16] to perform his divine will
[17:19] the second millennial came it was also a
[17:22] time of change
[17:25] the world was lost in darkness
[17:29] it was lost in the blindness of idolatry
[17:34] but there on the on the plains of shinar
[17:39] their god ordained predestinated
[17:43] chose one man through which he could
[17:47] reflect himself
[17:49] and declare his divine word
[17:52] and that man of course was abraham
[17:57] for the world had drifted
[18:00] from the original knowledge of god
[18:04] that god was one god
[18:07] and had drifted into the
[18:10] paganism of idolatry
[18:14] carvings of stone bowing down to them
[18:18] and worshipping them
[18:20] which later in exodus god was to
[18:23] give us the commandments saying that
[18:26] anything
[18:27] carved by man any idols of wood stone or
[18:31] brass
[18:32] thou shall not bow
[18:35] down to them nor serve them declare
[18:39] who regardless who tells you it's
[18:42] okay for i the lord thy god
[18:45] is a jealous god and god will not stand
[18:49] for it
[18:49] it is paganism it is absolutely
[18:53] paganism under the disguise of
[18:56] christianity but at that time darkness
[19:00] covered the land idolatry was everywhere
[19:04] and abraham was not different than
[19:06] anybody else his father
[19:08] will no doubt was an idol maker
[19:11] sculptor carver and now that he was
[19:15] working along with his father
[19:18] but god had put him on the earth for a
[19:21] purpose
[19:22] and in the fullness of god's time
[19:26] when god was ready to use him or to
[19:29] awaken
[19:30] the seeds of life the potentials
[19:33] that were hidden in him that he knew
[19:36] nothing about
[19:37] god was ready to reveal that to him
[19:41] then the holy spirit god visited him
[19:45] amen visited him because he was
[19:49] predestinated to hear the
[19:52] voice of god the word the revealed word
[19:55] of god
[19:56] for his day for his time and for his
[19:59] hour
[20:00] god woken up by his voice
[20:04] and here it was god placed in his heart
[20:09] to restore back to the world at that
[20:11] time
[20:12] the revelation of one god
[20:17] amen and father abraham
[20:20] as we know founded the great
[20:23] nation of israel
[20:26] based on that revelation
[20:29] of one god to whom his descendants to
[20:32] this day
[20:34] believe in only one god the
[20:37] great jehovah elohim the
[20:40] one only and true god as christians
[20:44] what has been revealed to us from the
[20:47] word
[20:48] is that jehovah elohim in order to
[20:52] save mankind created a body
[20:56] for himself to indwell
[20:59] came down and dwelt in that body
[21:03] in the form of the man christ jesus
[21:07] having a body so the body could die on
[21:10] the cross
[21:12] to pay the redemptive purchase
[21:15] price of redemption for his sons and
[21:18] daughters
[21:19] but then thou he gives up the ghost
[21:22] and the god the spirit of god can go
[21:25] back into glory
[21:26] where it was in the first place
[21:30] now recognize that god used abraham
[21:34] abraham was an idolater like everyone
[21:38] else
[21:39] abraham was not better than anybody else
[21:44] but through the grace of god he was
[21:47] chosen by god
[21:49] oh we are not abraham
[21:52] but we are of the faith seed of abraham
[21:56] we are abraham's fake children
[21:59] because remember god gave abraham
[22:03] promises and one of the promises
[22:06] he says abraham look up to the stars
[22:09] for even more than these stars or even
[22:12] if you could cut the
[22:13] dust of the earth oh my your
[22:17] descendants are going to be number less
[22:20] than the sands of the seashore
[22:22] number less than the stars within the
[22:24] heavens
[22:25] of course we realize that that
[22:29] did not speak only of israel for the
[22:32] nation of israel
[22:34] is actually a very small
[22:37] nation but in that compound
[22:41] statement god had included
[22:45] abraham's seed faith
[22:48] abraham's children of faith
[22:51] amen abraham's faith seed so we are
[22:54] happy to be
[22:55] also children of abraham
[22:58] not by flesh but by faith
[23:02] but by revelation having the same
[23:05] attitude to god
[23:07] and the very approach to god that he
[23:10] had god has chosen us
[23:14] in this millennium in this generation
[23:17] to be the man and women for the moment
[23:22] that he could use for his glory in the
[23:25] midst of idolatry
[23:26] in the midst of darkness in the midst of
[23:30] drifting away
[23:31] from the things of god that we can stand
[23:34] up on his word
[23:35] and receive his blessing which he also
[23:38] promised to abraham
[23:40] in yours in thy seed shall all the
[23:44] nations of the earth be blessed not only
[23:47] in the nation of israel certainly but
[23:51] also abraham's children through
[23:54] faith through them the gospel
[23:58] will enrich the entire world
[24:01] for this message this the smell shall be
[24:04] preached into
[24:05] all the world and then shall the end
[24:08] come
[24:09] oh thanks be to god for his blessing
[24:12] upon us in these last days i'm speaking
[24:16] about
[24:17] men for the moment
[24:21] men and women people chosen by god
[24:24] for this day this time this moment
[24:28] god has raised us up for his glory
[24:32] and for his honor now the third
[24:35] uh millennium came along
[24:39] the nation of israel was again found in
[24:41] confusion
[24:43] under constant attack by her enemies
[24:48] oh my think about it and just about that
[24:52] time
[24:53] after saul had disobeyed god
[24:58] disobeyed the word of the prophet samuel
[25:01] god anointed david
[25:06] and raised him up and placed him
[25:10] upon the throne thank god god sets up
[25:13] kings and he takes down kings
[25:16] oh praise god when saul was taken down
[25:20] then a david came upon the throne
[25:24] at that time and god used him
[25:29] to defeat all of israel's
[25:32] enemies so that they could have
[25:36] peace they could have security they
[25:39] could have
[25:40] hope in this present world
[25:43] and praise god from david's lineage
[25:46] the promise was given that the messiah
[25:50] will come from the loins or the lineage
[25:54] of david that he would be a son
[25:58] or of the lineage of david
[26:01] praise god a savior of all
[26:04] mankind thank god for that third
[26:08] millennium oh praise god then
[26:11] comes the fourth millennium once again
[26:15] the world was lost in sin hopelessness
[26:20] injustice under invasion
[26:24] and under the thraldom of roman
[26:28] tradition roman idolatry
[26:32] paganism at that time
[26:36] spiritual darkness covered the land
[26:40] and evil rain everywhere
[26:44] just about that time the millennium
[26:48] chains was fixing to change from the
[26:51] third
[26:52] to the fourth amen and there came one
[26:57] born on the scene whose the angel
[27:00] said to his mother mary thou shalt
[27:03] call his name jesus for he shall
[27:06] save his people from their
[27:10] sins and the world changed
[27:13] the darkness fled away for the
[27:17] son the s-u-n the s-o-n
[27:20] of god shined upon the scene
[27:23] and the people that sat in darkness saw
[27:26] a great light in the person
[27:29] and life of jesus christ the word of god
[27:32] made flesh and so the sunrise of hope
[27:37] dawned upon the hearts of the people
[27:40] supernatural lights were turned on
[27:43] in the world and the darkness fled away
[27:47] for he was the true light that shines
[27:50] shining into the heart of man he was
[27:54] my friends the the center of
[27:57] all history which you know to this day
[28:00] is divided between
[28:04] before christ bc
[28:08] and autonomy after christ
[28:12] here we are praise god but his life
[28:16] came in the very center of history
[28:20] well did ezekiel say he is the wheel in
[28:24] the middle of the wheel
[28:25] she is the center of our attention
[28:29] at the center of everything oh
[28:32] praise god aren't you happy for the lord
[28:35] jesus christ
[28:36] amen then came the
[28:39] fifth millennium another
[28:42] change came in the world
[28:45] and again the world lay in
[28:48] satan's grip of error
[28:51] corruption ignorance spiritual bondage
[28:57] and at that time the bible was a closed
[29:01] book it was a mysterious book
[29:04] and it was used by certain
[29:08] religious authorities to engender
[29:11] fear and superstition in the hearts
[29:15] and in the minds of men for the bible
[29:18] remain the closed book and was closely
[29:22] guarded
[29:23] by the so-called church that claimed
[29:27] that it was the defender of the faith as
[29:30] if god needs someone to defend
[29:32] his faith now here it is friends we
[29:35] understand
[29:37] that that was used by the roman pagans
[29:41] at that time
[29:43] the skies under the robes and guys
[29:47] of christianity and guarding
[29:51] my friends the bible unlocking up the
[29:54] bible and imprisoning the very
[29:57] word of god and ruling on the religious
[30:01] fear superstition and thy force at
[30:04] paganism
[30:05] and i idolatry
[30:09] brought from from pagan rome
[30:13] invading into christianity
[30:16] changing from a military power into a
[30:20] religious power upon the face
[30:23] of the very earth here we find my
[30:27] friends
[30:28] the light trying to shine within a
[30:32] so-called
[30:33] church saturated
[30:36] and steeped in religious tradition
[30:40] dogmas false doctrine
[30:45] all of this i repeat under
[30:48] the disguise and honor the sheepskins
[30:53] of christianity
[30:56] the word of god was chained to the
[30:59] rostrums the pulpits
[31:02] the walls of these cathedrals
[31:07] magnificent cathedrals
[31:10] in whose shadows lay the poor helpless
[31:13] homeless blind
[31:15] and those that walked and lived in fear
[31:18] and darkness
[31:20] at that particular time and the word of
[31:23] god
[31:23] even when a little portions of it was
[31:26] read out
[31:27] it was used by satan
[31:30] to mask it by using a
[31:34] language the people did not
[31:37] understand whether they were hearing a
[31:39] blessing or a curse
[31:41] they did not know but they were given
[31:44] the impression
[31:45] it was a holy thing to have the word of
[31:48] god
[31:48] hidden and masked away from them instead
[31:52] of the
[31:52] clear word of god so that they can
[31:55] judge for themselves oh my by the holy
[31:59] spirit
[32:00] and recognize what god is saying
[32:03] to them oh praise god brother sister
[32:07] what a time of day
[32:10] a day of darkness now we know this is
[32:13] just
[32:14] about 700 years after the times
[32:17] of the apostles and the people were
[32:20] living
[32:21] under that kind of religious domination
[32:24] trolling and fear under the
[32:28] spirit of feudalism and
[32:31] the roman inquisition
[32:35] uh i'm astonished that they would claim
[32:39] they were the ones that were being
[32:41] persecuted and
[32:42] the inquisition was against them but we
[32:45] know
[32:45] from from even natural history that it
[32:49] was
[32:49] rome that were the prime inquisitors
[32:54] and the ones that
[32:57] empowered the inquisition to be able to
[33:01] convert of protestants
[33:04] back into catholicism and there
[33:07] deal with them in the harshest tortures
[33:11] and and using all manner of racks and
[33:14] all manner of
[33:15] terrible horrible satanic inventions and
[33:19] cruel inventions
[33:21] that will strain the limits of humanity
[33:25] and turning men upon men into
[33:28] beasts squalor was everywhere
[33:33] hunger was everywhere
[33:36] superstition my friends
[33:40] but the millennium was ready to change
[33:45] time for a change time
[33:49] people were mad for that moment
[33:53] people that were there in that hour were
[33:55] designed for
[33:57] destiny praise god
[34:00] and it seemed in the darkness as if god
[34:03] had forgotten his own
[34:06] but never never ever get the devil to
[34:09] believe
[34:10] that you to believe that that god
[34:12] forgets his own
[34:14] for god never forgets his own he himself
[34:18] said in the word
[34:19] i will never leave you not forsake you
[34:22] but i'll be
[34:22] with you to the very end of the age
[34:26] well do we know that god stands in the
[34:29] shadows
[34:30] watching over his own i i'm just
[34:34] thinking of an old song that says
[34:36] standing somewhere in the shadows you
[34:39] will find
[34:40] jesus he is the lord who cares and
[34:44] understands yes friends he may be
[34:47] standing
[34:48] watching and he is there watching over
[34:51] his
[34:52] own as a mother watches over
[34:55] their own all the time praise god
[34:58] god never forgets his own and he never
[35:02] leaves them without a witness
[35:05] glory to god hallelujah now friends
[35:09] thank god shortly after that
[35:14] this new millennium being born
[35:19] oh praise god five
[35:23] we see it here the number of grace
[35:28] then the church of god
[35:31] acts chapter 2 came on the scene
[35:35] those disciples those apostles were the
[35:39] men and women for that moment as i
[35:42] believe
[35:42] we are those men and women for this
[35:46] moment
[35:47] to carry the word of the lord we may
[35:50] feel insufficient in ourselves but let
[35:53] me
[35:54] tell you by god's help we can
[35:57] by god's power we can by god's spirit we
[36:01] can
[36:01] and god never forgets his own but he
[36:04] will keep his promises
[36:06] as he blesses and anoints his children
[36:09] glory to god hallelujah
[36:11] now friends this is not a complicated
[36:14] deep
[36:14] dark doctrinal message of any kind but
[36:18] this is something to point you into the
[36:20] right direction
[36:22] this is something to inspire you
[36:24] something to encourage
[36:26] you and something that will set your
[36:29] heart of fire
[36:30] and give you purpose in the age in which
[36:33] we live and when suddenly the bible says
[36:37] suddenly when the day of pentecost was
[36:41] fully come
[36:42] and you know the rest of the story
[36:46] how that the holy spirit descended upon
[36:49] them
[36:51] and gave and the disciples and apostles
[36:54] gave great witness of the word of god
[36:57] and thousands were saved and baptized
[37:01] even
[37:01] on the first day without any marketing
[37:04] any kind of business administration
[37:08] public relations of any of the
[37:10] scientific thing
[37:11] we know that that has its place but
[37:14] certainly friends the the real
[37:18] movement of god the real organism of god
[37:22] needs god to be on their side and
[37:25] anointing them and using them for his
[37:28] glory and honor
[37:29] and he'll take care of the rest of it
[37:32] and i'm resting upon that now when the
[37:35] when the church was born
[37:38] there hallelujah my brothers and sisters
[37:41] the church ages began the seven church
[37:45] ages found in the book of revelation
[37:47] chapter one
[37:48] which the bible speaks about those
[37:50] church agents
[37:52] coming those seven ages
[37:55] begun right there in the time
[37:58] of the apostles and
[38:01] we find out brothers that after
[38:05] the death of the apostle john
[38:08] then came others like saint martin
[38:13] irenaeus polycarp
[38:17] who was a direct disciple of john
[38:21] and others later came
[38:24] like looter and so friends
[38:29] god was going to restore back
[38:32] the original teaching of one god
[38:37] lost in the garden of eden satan tried
[38:40] to bury it with idolatry
[38:43] and a multiplicity of gods god brought
[38:46] abraham restored it back
[38:48] one god again satan with his
[38:52] never-ending attempts trying to break it
[38:55] up
[38:55] and destroy it through israel into
[38:59] egyptian idolatry god brought them out
[39:02] by a mighty hand
[39:04] and there followed that story through
[39:06] the bible
[39:08] the fight between god versus
[39:11] satan one god versus many gods
[39:14] because if you don't believe in one god
[39:17] you start to believe in two
[39:19] then he can get you to believe in three
[39:21] and once he can
[39:22] get you to believe in three you can
[39:24] believe in 10
[39:25] 20 a million gods and you're not
[39:28] different than any other pagan
[39:32] religion that believes in many gods
[39:35] once you veer off of the revelation
[39:39] of heroin israel the lord thy
[39:42] god is one lord amen hallelujah
[39:46] only one god and so friends
[39:52] the infant church after the time of the
[39:55] apostles
[39:57] began wandering in the wilderness of
[40:00] darkness and false doctrine
[40:04] and then they were weak
[40:07] hidden haunted persecuted
[40:12] and hunted down
[40:15] by the religious
[40:18] legions of rome
[40:24] moving with their pagan
[40:31] operations anointed
[40:35] by the same spirits that anointed
[40:39] pharaoh that a minded
[40:42] uh nebuchadnezzar that anointed herod
[40:47] always to destroy and to kill
[40:51] out the royal seed but the royal
[40:55] seed of god are the people for the
[40:58] moment they are here to stay
[41:00] for they are not just physical seed of
[41:03] abraham
[41:04] but they are the spiritual faith-seeked
[41:07] children
[41:08] of abraham by the grace of god that
[41:11] cannot die but in them god placed a
[41:15] portion
[41:16] of his eternal life for the gift of god
[41:19] is eternal life through jesus christ oh
[41:22] lord
[41:23] amen so here on the disguise of
[41:26] christianity
[41:27] satan operating under that guise
[41:31] the true church being hunted
[41:34] and persecuted but the church
[41:37] resisted and persisted by god's grace
[41:42] and endured slowly slowly
[41:46] and ever so slowly god
[41:49] began to bring forth men that would
[41:53] this declare the truth of the
[41:56] word of god not revelation one tells you
[42:00] not only the seven church ages began
[42:04] but god lays out from revelation one two
[42:07] three
[42:08] how he would use seven messengers
[42:12] each one relegated
[42:15] to take care of a church age and to be
[42:18] the
[42:19] angel or messenger to that church age
[42:23] also to be the voice of god to that
[42:26] church
[42:27] age not that the man is god but
[42:30] the spirit of god will be the voice
[42:33] speaking through the man
[42:35] and pointing the people back to the word
[42:38] and the people of that day not
[42:41] understanding
[42:42] that god didn't need anyone need their
[42:45] education their wisdom
[42:47] for it was god himself that would be
[42:49] speaking through that man
[42:51] and so even though they may try to
[42:53] destroy the man destroy his repetition
[42:56] the word of god will stand and live
[42:58] forever
[42:59] for it was not a man's word it was the
[43:02] word of god and his the word of god
[43:05] for it stands and lived forever and
[43:08] forever glory to god and so god sent
[43:11] luther
[43:12] on the scene we know there were others
[43:15] before
[43:16] amen praise god but then god sent
[43:20] looter at this after that time upon the
[43:23] scene
[43:24] with the the revelation that the just
[43:27] shall
[43:28] live by faith not by works
[43:31] not by by the pain of money
[43:35] it's not by buying yourself out of
[43:38] purgatory or hell it's not
[43:40] by any righteousness of of your own
[43:44] it's not that you can move the hand of
[43:46] god
[43:47] by by the size of the candles that you
[43:50] burn
[43:51] or by the multitude of them oh my
[43:54] friend but by faith in his word that
[43:57] just shall live by faith praise god
[44:01] hallelujah
[44:02] amen but then it took another 500 years
[44:07] from luther wesley down to pentecost
[44:11] to bring the church back to the place of
[44:14] a revelation of one god
[44:17] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[44:19] christ
[44:21] and the baptism
[44:24] of the holy ghost then came this time
[44:29] when malachi 4 5
[44:32] should be fulfilled
[44:35] in the church that is still
[44:39] bound by traditions denomination
[44:42] and walking around in confusion
[44:46] and then god brought his servant prophet
[44:48] on the scene
[44:50] who right now many deny many
[44:53] refuse and will not receive but i tell
[44:56] you in the name of jesus christ
[44:59] one of these days your the world will
[45:02] recognize that he was
[45:05] a true prophet speaking in the name of
[45:08] the lord
[45:09] and around that time it was too late for
[45:12] some
[45:13] right now they do not understand fully
[45:16] what
[45:16] god is accomplishing and doing through
[45:19] him
[45:19] but the day will come when they
[45:21] recognize
[45:22] that god was using him to restore the
[45:25] faith of our fathers restore us back
[45:29] to the faith of our fathers hallelujah
[45:32] for god used him to reveal to us out of
[45:36] the word of god
[45:37] how clearly that eve did not eat an
[45:40] apple
[45:41] but it was adultery which this with the
[45:44] serpent who was not the snake
[45:46] at that time but later had to be put on
[45:49] his belly
[45:50] but was the missing link between uh man
[45:54] and the rest of the beast he was used of
[45:57] god
[45:58] to show us friends the trail of the
[46:02] serpent's seed
[46:03] oh my hallelujah satan's
[46:07] children operating true cain
[46:10] oh my friends the
[46:14] false and true vine that began in the
[46:17] garden of eden
[46:18] twins that came forth from eve
[46:22] one of god and one of the devil oh
[46:26] my lord may god have mercy upon us
[46:29] yes sir and they are present in the
[46:32] church
[46:33] even today two different spirits
[46:37] in operation in the midst of god's
[46:40] last name church and god also
[46:43] used that his servant prophet
[46:47] with the opening of the seven seal
[46:51] mystery book to our generation
[46:55] for the glory of god and god used him
[46:58] also
[47:00] to lay out the word of god in such a way
[47:03] that the eyes of god's chosen ones
[47:08] as our tech said
[47:11] that reserve for the latter times
[47:16] to be revealed in the last day i believe
[47:20] we are that group i believe
[47:23] you may be in that group predestinated
[47:26] for this
[47:27] hour and to be revealed in this last day
[47:30] for god will keep his bride hidden
[47:34] and as it was spoken will we unveil her
[47:38] or lift the veil that she may be
[47:40] revealed
[47:41] in the last day and then the rapture
[47:44] goes up
[47:44] it'll be too late then after that quick
[47:48] short mighty work and after this evil
[47:51] of satan and his dark legions of doom
[47:55] within the operating under the very
[47:58] framework of the church of the living
[48:01] god
[48:02] is exposed in the midst of
[48:05] what is called the church today that is
[48:08] steeped in dynamic nationalism
[48:10] i want you to know friends that the true
[48:14] believing church of god did not just
[48:18] tumble upon the scene but we are the
[48:21] apple of his
[48:22] eye we are the fullness
[48:25] of his eternal purpose here
[48:29] we were made for this moment you were
[48:32] designed with this
[48:34] destiny and mind you was shaped to serve
[48:37] him
[48:38] to praise him to give him glory and to
[48:42] carry the word of god to bear
[48:45] reproach for his name in this last hour
[48:49] oh thank god i would encourage you
[48:52] never be ashamed of him but stand
[48:55] upon the word of god and here we are
[48:59] standing on the brink of another
[49:02] millennium
[49:03] change from the sixth to the seventh
[49:06] oh glory to god hallelujah another
[49:09] millennium
[49:10] is just about to be born
[49:13] and the world is undergoing the throes
[49:17] and the birth pains of change
[49:20] thank god the mighty angel
[49:23] praise god just come down according to
[49:27] revelation
[49:29] amen 10 1-7
[49:32] and by the instrumentality of the sound
[49:34] angel
[49:37] has brought forth his mighty word and
[49:40] said the church agents
[49:42] are now over time
[49:46] shall be no more it doesn't mean
[49:49] earthly time shall be no more but the
[49:52] time for the ages are now over
[49:56] the people who are of god's uh god's
[49:59] elected
[50:00] are ready to move back into the first
[50:02] day the new day
[50:04] amen praise the lord we'll expand on
[50:07] that in other preachings and teachings
[50:09] but right now friends we are in the
[50:11] midst of the changing
[50:13] of an age as i have been emphasizing
[50:17] uh there in the word of god hallelujah
[50:20] and we are not here to present to you
[50:22] canned
[50:23] bible studies of man that are so
[50:26] beautifully
[50:27] laid out and so psychologically
[50:31] uh placed there for you and just
[50:35] available for you you don't have to be
[50:39] more an eagle anymore
[50:42] think about it the changing of the age
[50:45] gent from gentiles to jews back again
[50:48] the light going from the west back to
[50:51] the east
[50:52] again lord of god yes sir
[50:55] oh praise god gentile the gentile day is
[50:59] over
[51:00] praise god as the songwriter said
[51:03] nations
[51:04] are breaking and israel's awakening the
[51:08] signs that the prophets
[51:10] foretold gentiled as
[51:13] numbered with horrors and cumbered
[51:16] return all dispersed to your own
[51:20] for the day of redemption
[51:24] is so near very near
[51:27] man's hearts are failing for fear
[51:32] be filled with god's spirit your lamb
[51:35] streamed
[51:36] and clear look up
[51:39] your redemption is there
[51:42] yes you were made for this moment
[51:47] you were made for this season and time
[51:51] you were designed with a destiny
[51:54] to fulfill the word of god for this hour
[51:58] to be unveiled to be revealed
[52:01] in this last day not just the unveiling
[52:05] of the mighty god back there
[52:08] 1900 years ago not the unveiling of the
[52:12] mighty god
[52:13] all just uh in the ministry
[52:17] of brother william marion branham
[52:20] unveiling
[52:21] the mighty god who is the word
[52:24] but the unveiling of the mighty god in
[52:27] the bright form
[52:29] it's taking place even now god
[52:32] revealing and unveiling his own
[52:36] taking his adopted sons and daughters
[52:38] and placing them before the public
[52:41] so the public would recognize that these
[52:44] are the sons of god
[52:46] these are the children of the most high
[52:48] oh praise god forevermore
[52:51] here we are friends to rail to go on
[52:55] and to carry the word of god nothing
[52:58] could completely destroy the
[53:00] church the conquer worm
[53:03] the palmer worm the caterpillar and even
[53:07] the locusts
[53:08] eating away at the true church of god
[53:11] and up down it right down to a stump
[53:15] where the devil thought the church was
[53:18] dead but god
[53:19] promised he would restore and that's the
[53:22] reason why
[53:23] he sent the prophet william marin
[53:26] branham
[53:27] to come on the scene the messenger
[53:30] the last church age messenger to come
[53:33] upon the scene
[53:34] and to restore back the truth of the
[53:38] word of god
[53:39] that hero israel people of god there's
[53:42] only one god
[53:43] water baptism is in the name of jesus
[53:46] christ
[53:46] there is no other name given under
[53:49] heaven whereby we must be saved
[53:51] these are simple apparently simple
[53:54] themes
[53:54] but god hides in simplicity and reveals
[53:58] himself
[53:59] in the same oh my friends you may want
[54:02] to hear
[54:02] great deep things that'll tickle your
[54:04] ears and cause you to tap your feet but
[54:06] this is something that will speak to
[54:09] your heart

[54:59] in every home as i'm beginning to wind

[55:07] don't use
[55:08] just for every meal but they are set
[55:11] apart
[55:12] they place somewhere and then
[55:15] at some other time when we have special
[55:18] guests
[55:19] they have taken out their vessels of
[55:21] honor
[55:22] and when those vessels of honor that are
[55:25] taken out from hiding they are taken
[55:28] out from where they were reserved and
[55:30] preserved
[55:31] and covered up then god begins to unveil
[55:35] them

[55:53] but it's there to use for the best
[55:57] takes the best seven course meal that
[56:00] you can think about
[56:02] is being used on those vessels

[57:01] god hallelujah
[57:02] and the unveiling of the mighty god
[57:06] within his bride not in jesus back there
[57:10] but the mighty god that was unveiled in
[57:12] christ
[57:13] is now being unveiled in his beloved
[57:16] ones
[57:17] for this hour who were made and
[57:20] predestinated
[57:22] for this moment praise god hallelujah
[57:25] so god's true church is not a designed
[57:28] by
[57:28] man it's not designed by man's system
[57:32] man's organization and administration
[57:36] but god set in the church his
[57:39] supernatural spiritual administration
[57:43] and no matter what anyone says the book
[57:45] of acts is the blueprint for the church
[57:48] of the living god
[57:49] and anyone any organization any church
[57:52] that sways away from the blueprint and
[57:55] changes the dynamics the measurements
[57:58] the balance the plumb line
[58:00] of the great architect who created earth
[58:03] sea and sky
[58:04] my friends you will be in deep trouble
[58:07] for the
[58:08] great architect knows exactly what he
[58:11] is doing praise god hallelujah i want to
[58:14] thank god
[58:16] that we want to design for
[58:20] the israel was not designed to fit
[58:23] in to egyptian culture
[58:26] and the true believer is not fit in to
[58:29] be conformed to this world
[58:32] but to be transformed by the power of
[58:34] god
[58:35] the true believer israel
[58:38] was not designed to be slaves
[58:41] and to stay in a state of slavery
[58:46] israel was designed to be a free
[58:49] people and so is the true believer
[58:52] designed not to be a slave to the habits
[58:54] of sin
[58:56] and the works of this world but to go
[58:59] and enjoy the freedom of jesus christ
[59:04] israel was not designed to be a
[59:06] wandering people
[59:08] but to be a people in their own land
[59:11] given to them
[59:12] by the true and living god the most high
[59:16] they were not designed to be a people
[59:18] that will ever be in captivity
[59:20] and the true believer was not designed
[59:23] to
[59:24] remain in captivity oh for we are god's
[59:27] eagles for this hour the most pitiful
[59:30] sight is to see an eagle caged inside of
[59:33] a zoo
[59:34] with his witness feathers drooping
[59:38] that's those sharp talons that were
[59:40] created by god to
[59:42] hunt to receive fresh killed meat
[59:46] oh my that was designed by god to eat
[59:50] fresh killed bloody bleeding lamb word
[59:54] that the eagle finds itself in a
[59:57] denominational zoo
[59:59] losing those talons losing the sharpness
[1:00:02] of its curved beak
[1:00:04] amen to be able to hook on and grab and
[1:00:07] hold to
[1:00:08] god's unchanging hand of his divine word
[1:00:11] all praises holy and precious name
[1:00:14] and and so the eagle's a pitiful sight
[1:00:17] when
[1:00:18] the the eagle falls to the ground
[1:00:22] and becomes denominationally diseased
[1:00:25] with all kinds of man-made designs
[1:00:28] not meant to scrape and claw
[1:00:32] and dig for worms and dig for things up
[1:00:35] on this earth
[1:00:37] but my god the eagle was meant to soar
[1:00:41] in the heavenly places
[1:00:43] to rise up into the presence of glory of
[1:00:47] god
[1:00:47] may god help you if you've lost your
[1:00:50] wings
[1:00:50] if you've lost your your talons you lost
[1:00:53] your beak
[1:00:54] come back to your foundations come back
[1:00:57] to the word of god
[1:00:58] come back to god's original intention
[1:01:01] for you
[1:01:02] and then god will bless you and raise
[1:01:04] you up in the heavenlies
[1:01:06] where you back where you belong amen
[1:01:10] we are not designed israel was never
[1:01:12] designed for
[1:01:13] bigotry and hatred and discrimination
[1:01:16] it was not there in them oh
[1:01:20] my many call themselves jews
[1:01:23] and they are not but the bible says
[1:01:26] no they are false amen may god help us
[1:01:30] brothers
[1:01:31] to realize that a true christian do not
[1:01:34] have
[1:01:34] these qualities within their heart it's
[1:01:37] not even in them
[1:01:38] because god's love consumes them and
[1:01:41] takes them over
[1:01:43] and there is nothing else there but the
[1:01:45] love and grace of god
[1:01:47] and lastly as true believers made for
[1:01:51] the moment
[1:01:52] we were not designed for any form of
[1:01:55] defeat
[1:01:57] for first john 4 says greater is he that
[1:02:00] is in you
[1:02:02] than he that is in the world praise
[1:02:06] god and also jesus said
[1:02:10] be of good courage for i have overcome
[1:02:13] the world
[1:02:14] the overcomer is in you so there is
[1:02:17] nothing
[1:02:18] that you cannot overcome for he
[1:02:21] overcomes everything for you the
[1:02:23] battle is not yours but the battle
[1:02:27] is the lord's and he is more than a
[1:02:30] conqueror
[1:02:31] who lives within you and that is the
[1:02:33] reason why
[1:02:34] we can say that also we are more
[1:02:37] than conquerors for he conquered satan
[1:02:40] sin death hell and the grave
[1:02:44] and he lives in you and me today for he
[1:02:47] said in that day you will know i'm in
[1:02:49] the father the father in me
[1:02:51] and i in you so it doesn't matter my
[1:02:54] friend
[1:02:54] what is happening in your life at this
[1:02:57] very
[1:02:58] moment believe me in the name of the
[1:03:01] lord that no matter what
[1:03:03] is happening in your life no matter how
[1:03:05] dark it is believer
[1:03:07] no matter how it is whether you are
[1:03:10] not to believe another church goal but
[1:03:13] you
[1:03:13] in your heart still a child of the most
[1:03:16] high god
[1:03:17] you were made for this moment and
[1:03:20] by god to serve him and the glory
[1:03:24] glorify his name for matthew 16 18 he
[1:03:27] says
[1:03:28] i will build my church and the
[1:03:31] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:03:34] it
[1:03:34] you were made for this moment you were
[1:03:37] designed for
[1:03:38] this day glory to god hallelujah
[1:03:41] and you taught my friends need to
[1:03:44] conform to the world
[1:03:45] but you need to believe god and that you
[1:03:48] can still
[1:03:49] live the way god wants you to live and
[1:03:52] to overcome
[1:03:54] and live a spirit-filled holy ghost
[1:03:57] anointed life of god and believe in
[1:04:01] one god and deny these denominational
[1:04:04] teachings of
[1:04:05] three gods and three and one and all
[1:04:08] such unbelievable nonsense and
[1:04:12] come back to the original faith hero
[1:04:15] israel there is the lord thy god is
[1:04:18] one lord and no one can show me where
[1:04:22] god ever changed his mind about his word
[1:04:26] being one and suddenly becoming three
[1:04:29] god is one god and we believe in
[1:04:33] only one god and the name of that god
[1:04:37] is jesus christ and that is why we
[1:04:40] baptize
[1:04:40] in his name and we pray and do all we do
[1:04:44] in the name of jesus christ your
[1:04:47] unchanging god
[1:04:49] hallelujah amen we are still holding to
[1:04:52] god's unchanging hand for he's an
[1:04:55] unchanging god
[1:04:56] his word is unchanging and we hold to it
[1:05:00] amen we hate sin
[1:05:03] but we love the sinner as god loves the
[1:05:06] sinner
[1:05:07] but hates his sin and god designs us
[1:05:11] we have what the world needs and this is
[1:05:14] our day
[1:05:16] we're kept for this hour
[1:05:19] and to receive this revelation and to
[1:05:22] prepare
[1:05:23] for the rapture before it goes into the
[1:05:27] tribulation
[1:05:29] after which armageddon after which
[1:05:32] we will go into the great time
[1:05:36] of the great millennium which is the
[1:05:39] seventh
[1:05:40] millennium back to eden again
[1:05:44] the complete cycle of the work on the
[1:05:47] plan of god
[1:05:48] being fulfilled in our day and in our
[1:05:51] time
[1:05:52] do you recognize your position in christ
[1:05:55] and in his word
[1:05:56] that you were really designed and made
[1:06:00] for this moment designed for this day
[1:06:04] and that's the reason why you have
[1:06:06] always been different
[1:06:08] you couldn't recognize what it was you
[1:06:11] didn't know
[1:06:11] what was speaking to you what was
[1:06:14] leaving you what was guiding you
[1:06:16] what was making you act the way you were
[1:06:18] acting
[1:06:19] but you were like an eagle trying to
[1:06:22] live in a
[1:06:22] chicken pen a barn house of something
[1:06:26] nominational so-called teaching
[1:06:30] canned worms or living off of something
[1:06:33] like that but you've come to recognize
[1:06:35] your day your time
[1:06:38] your moment and that you were made
[1:06:42] for this moment the lord bless you and
[1:06:46] keep you and cause his face to shine
