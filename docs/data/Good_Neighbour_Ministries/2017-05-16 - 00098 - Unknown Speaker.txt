TRANSCRIPT
========================================
of Christ in you the character of Christ in you and of course you know this symbol that's on the wall is not only the church ages those are the seven virtues and those are the seven expressions of the character of Christ amen let us read Ephesians 1:4 just for a starting point I could have used several scriptures I could have used the scripture Christ in you the hope Glory you know power of God work in you many scriptures could be used but I'll use Ephesians 1:4 praise the Lord God answers prayer hallah I understand a lot of you been getting answers answered prayer amen I understand that the prayer group is working my God is working mightily through the prayer group amen prayers come in and prayer are answered glory to God isn't that wonderful praise God remember the meeting coming on the end of the week and ask God to anoint the minister and bless the meeting amen and invite your friends invite folks in the best you can and let's get together and give God glory and praise amen amen let us pray before we read one verse out of Ephesians 4 our dear God and gracious Heavenly Father we are together again just like we were up in heaven you send our souls down upon the Earth to represent you and being trapped in this body we were subject to sin and pain and suffering and sickness but by the opening of the word the soon the son of man sets free is free indeed and father as we are about to read your will from your holy word May the spirit of almighty God come on the see and anoint the word of God for our hearts father Lift us up in the spirit break the chains of doubt and fear I rebuke every Spirit of hindrance and obstacle and and and loose the minds of the people to believe the word of God for this out we ask your blessing now and the and the multiplication and portioning of the word in Jesus name amen and amen thank you according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundations of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love I'll go to the next verse having predestinated us onto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will God bless you please be seated there's a little little uh chorus that I love to sing Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me all God's wonderful passions and Pur oh thou Spirit divine all my nature refine till the beauty of Jesus be seen let's sing it one more time let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me all God wonderful passions and oh th Spirit divine all my nature till the beauty of Jesus in me amen praise the name of the Lord God Bless you that's a little chorus I love to sing in prayer time with loan with the Lord let him refine my nature so I can be like him now um switching from that talk brother Bren uh clearly says um that in the last days amen that women types the church how many knows that said that women types the church praise God and uh the thing about that also he says that in the choosing of a bride uh that we must there'll be a rise of the in the beauty of women in the last days he said that clearly he says back in the days or the women that were beauty queens back there he said they won't even they won't even they won't even be chosen to be in the lineup anymore because just the know normal woman of today is a beauty amen some of the sisters didn't know that but I'm telling them that now praise the Lord random said that that's the prophet saying that he says the normal woman today would have been a beauty queen back there and what they call Beauty is totally different today but the then he prophesied that there will be a rise of beauty of women in the last days Amen in other words he says they'll get the women will get more beautiful and more beautiful and more beautiful and the men will get weaker but wiser right they may look bigger but the natural fact they'll get weaker but WIS but women will rise in Beauty in every possible way amen and then he goes on to talk about uh let me let me actually find it right here now he says now you know a woman is a type of the church we are the bride and the CH the church is the bride that's a woman types the bride a lot of brides there are out there and let don't let them women entice you see you see them ministers are letting them churches pull them off from the truth she be switching between the Natural Woman and the spiritual woman uh like there what she cuts her hair and when she does that that woman has cut off her power and her glory not against sisters if God would give a man a better thing than a good wife he' have given him that but not all women are good and not all women are wise you see or not all femal are even mothers not all that have children are real motherly I've seen some i' have better respects for a dog than to take their kids and set them out in the street and lay out there not even caring people coming out in these little old clothes and things until in this hour our women are immorally dressed can you say Amen that wow now in the children Ching of a bride or a wife I'm just laying some background here amen he says you may look at there might be one girl that's real pretty and another one with a great stature that looks better than this other one wow but Brothers you may have to sacrifice one for the other if she's not the of a woman or of a lady I don't care whether she's pretty or she's not pretty you brothers that better look at her [Music] character whether she's pretty or not pretty look at her character now for it is becoming if a Christian would choose a wife he have to choose a genuine Born Again woman regardless of what she looks like if what she is what makes her and then again that reflects his own Godly character and watch in his mind for a wife what's going to be in the future for his family but if he marries one of these modern day flers recers sex Queens what would he expect what kind of a home if he marries a girl that ain't got morals enough to stay home and take care of the house amen what kind of a housekeeper will she be you see that's it but that's the beauty of the women that is to happen in the last days amen that is what's supposed to be happening in this in these last days that we are living in praise the Lord I want to give you one more quote here because uh he's striking on the fact that uh gifts without character is satanic amen now how I'm applying it certain women are given certain gifts they may be given a lot of um uh gifts in their bodily shape and form While others may not be gifted in that way but gifts without character is satanic you seeing how I'm applying it amen I'm applying it in that way and then I'm talking also about supernatural spiritual gifts in the life of an individual if if that individual does not allow the Holy Spirit first to form and control the character the manifestation of those gifts the genuine know they may be would be devilish amen right the application of it would be devilish brother Brandon said about himself he said having a gift of Des discernment if you allow yourself not to pray enough and you start to get carnal instead of of the gift operating as a gift of discernment it will become one of the worst critics because then the person is starting to see things carnally in other words you you're doing it you're doing it from a carnal point of view right it's the same thing just as much as he says really he says them witches out there if they had surrendered themselves to God they would have been Servants of God with gifts of Prophecy and discernment amen amen but they allow themselves to be controlled by the devil and therefore the devil manifest himself through them you see where I'm talking about now you see why we are on the razor's head and you can fall either way even though you're a Christian you following me now yes you can go either way though you're a big Christian a lot of people take this message and Solomon said it's wise to be not over much righteous that sounds so funny how you could be too righteous but you can right the old Pentecost used to say you get so righteous you're noly good spiritually your mind is so much in the heavens that you're not dealing with reality see we've got to be both deeply spiritual but intensely practical amen recognize your day and the hour of your day that you're living in or else you're going to go right off and as a result of that a lot of ministers have made mess of a lot of people's lives amen I'm not thinking of any particular person or persons I'm not talking in general uh mess the people's Li up because they they just so push them this way push them that way and get them in all kinds of fanaticism and you know like that instead of keeping them solidly balanced on the word of God now listen to The Prophet before I started going into the message itself he says now unless we suffer we cannot reign with him how many will say you have to suffer he said before you can re the reason for this is that character is simply is never made without suffering amen amen let's use job I don't mean that you going to have the suffering the extremity of job he God was using job as a as a type or as a symbol so we can have an example as a Christian that every son or daughter of God must be tested you must be tested and so he says your character uh can be formed without suffering for character is a victory amen not a gift that's right thank you amen Hallelujah a man without character can't rain because power apart from character is Satan but Power with character is f to Ru amen and since he wants to share his throne on the same basis that he overcome and is set down in his father's Throne then then we have to overcome before we can sit down with him amen amen then we have to overcome and the little temporary sufferings we go through is not worthy to be compared with the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter in his kingdom through much tribulation amen God wants men how many believe that when suffer the lamb he's speaking man is not measured by how big his arms are but God measures a man by his character certainly he can be a big man and be nothing but a brute I seen men weigh 200 lb and didn't have one oce of a manhood in them nobody saying amen not one o see but a man is measured by character and so are women measured by their character and if we are truly Sons and Daughters of God what type of character then should we have amen you should have the character of Christ amen that is what we should have we are not here to talk Christianity but to live Christianity and be genuine Christians for the glory of God now having the gifts of God wonderful marvelous gifts without having the character to control those gifts amen makes them not only satanic but makes them a stumbling block to un believer because here is the guy preaching here is the woman talking that is a Christian andless she goes out line cheating the preacher doing all kinds of ungodly things and they claiming to be a man of God and claiming to be a Christian and it becomes a contradiction and it's a St block to the unbeliever that's right so we must be faithful to God he said gifts without character the gifts without these virtues is not accepted by God that's right God doesn't accept it Blasphemous names page 21 he's saying that when you have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness breadly love the Holy Ghost seals you as a unit the same way he seals the church the way he makes his bright is the way he makes individual out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam and RI from his side amen so we have to have the same character as Christ amen now we know when we born again the Lord comes in and he makes your heart his home amen or his house or his Tabernacle his Sanctuary where he dwells and he lives in us know him not that you you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen and that God dwells in you by faith he lives in your heart amen he lives in me He Lives in You by he lives in your heart now Christ is in you and when he comes in of course the Lord himself is perfection you believe that the Lord himself is perfection so the moment you are born again you are a perfect spiritual being just like when a baby is born it's a perfect natural human being but even though it's perfect and and and it has every Perfection of a human being in it yet it's not capable as yet expressing his full humanity and so is a Christian even though Christ came in and he himself is perfection he said but why am I not acting perfect well it's like a baby asking why I'm not walking like the rest of them why am not talking why am you can't do it right away but I I I go back after Paul's word we now have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling amen that Perfection that you have inside has to work until it comes outside amen is that right now God's real Christianity doesn't come from the outside he says it's not sticking Christianity on yourself like a bird feather oh the Bible says I supposed to have virtue so you try to stick that on oh the Bible says I'm going to add this so I add a little knowledge I that he says that's not how it works the Perfection is already in you but you need to surrender yourself to God so that he can manifest himself through you and these Seven Virtues will begin to flow out of you not because of you working yourself up into some state of fervor but he himself expressing his own character through you amen and that is why in the next statements he's saying here now you now you see you really can't impersonate them you can't imitate them amen praise God how could you say that and yet say the Christian elans have love more than some of you there are people out there not born again expressing virtues that looks more beautiful and like they're more CHR Chris that's the real chran is that right wow and yet he says but this can't be impers what he's saying is that the real Christ you can't impersonate that you can't impersonate his personality they can go out like the devil and try to to do the same thing by human effort but it's still not the same it's still not the same you can't do it it's not really there and you can't do it of yourself amen it's like when Israel God gave them the law and said Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not Li Thou shalt not kill thou sht not do this thou sht not do that but in actual fact God placed those laws deliberately so that they will come back to him and say Lord we we can't K this while we in this flesh as humans we we can't K us there's no way for us to keep law then he would give them the power to keep the law because it will take the blood to do that it took it would take the blood to do that but they did not do that it's the same way all these virtues oh I'm supposed to do this I'm supposed to do this then you find yourself not doing it like what Paul said the things I should do I don't do and what I shouldn't do I find myself doing because of the human nature that we are living in and the only thing that can help you is Christ himself in you your glory this is a mistake that the Pentecostals made they are trying to be like Jesus and to live like Christ without the character and person of Christ dwelling right within them and he living out his own life not you trying to live his life but he himself living his life in you is expressed in this way you will try to go and play a piano maybe you can but if beov was able to come and fill you one moment later you'll be able to play some matters you'll be able to play all kinds of conts different things you be able to play why because it's not you playing it's beat over in you playing the music amen well this is what real Christianity is is not you coming and and thinking that by uh just reading your Bible and praying and doing all these things all of a sudden you're a Christian no it's Christ in youah living out his own life through you thank you Lord apply this correctly God is his own interpreter amen amen he is the only one can interpret his own life amen amen you are only trying to live it the way you think he was but he is expressing himself now to let you know who he is is that right amen God in the present stage of his ministry expressing himself through human beings Born Again by The Blood amen hallelujah so gifts without the person and character of Christ operating through that life controlling these gifts amen without him it's amen amen even if he is there and the person is operating from a kind point of view it said but if prist is you and you humble down yourself and you surrender and you let yourself get out of the way amen praise the name of the Lord then God is able to work through you amen is that right and that's why you will become humble humble because once you got the Revelation realize that this is not me this is him that's right it's right it's not me it's him then Paul says what's there to boast about that nothing you can boast on you can't boast on your Holiness because it's not yours you can't boast on your humility it's not yours you can't boast on the gifts it's not yours you can't boast on love it's not yours none of it is yours it's him it's all about him Christ in you your hope Glory the of Christ controlling the caral nature taking it over and he expressing himself through you amen what that's the unve of the mighty Goden God unbeing himself hiding in sinful people I'm revealing himself through simple people praise God hallelujah amen glory to God isn't it wonderful that we can be real Believers trusting in God hallelujah amen see that's the way it is and then you see in the adoption of son God this man this king would have to his son would have tutors to raise him and if the son ever became here and if he was the right son then he would obey his father and he would be adopted and positionally placed praise the Lord he became he owner of whatever the father had praise God Paul refers to that of course in Galatians about the adoption of the son amen at the placing of a son amen you see he was a son when he was born you were born uh by Revelation to be a believer but then as you walk God tests you and proves you to see if you have the character to administrate the father's estate many have given over to their children their estate and you know the stories they squand it because they didn't have the character to be able to handle it they squandered it they destroyed the Legacy that the that the mom and dad left and everything else because it didn't have the character so God tests his children before he begins to give them responsibility to use and dispense his power and presence amen test you and as we read before through trial through testing through Temptation through trouble through tribulation amen that wasn't made to break you but to make you and to change you that you could be a real Christian in the presence of God hallelujah Believers that will not run on the Fire amen my God you know soldiers when they are when they're practicing to be a soldier oh they're drilling you they're showing you how to be a to shoot with the gun and to hit the Target and they show you how to polish your boots and polish your medals and out the March and everything else you have all the actions right you look like a real Christian but then when they go to the war and they run off those boats and they coming up the beaches and they go foxo and the enemy starts firing the shots do you know when the war starts at the beginning the general have to stay at the back because most of those young soldiers many of them try to run yeah they try to run and the general have to stand there with a bunch of Sergeants with machines guns and said anybody to get pass us you're dead you're not going pass us come here to fight amen go back to the fight amen sometimes that's what the pastor has to do you know come back to the fight we you're going amen crying and hollering for sympathy all the time like that instead of stand like a woman and Fai the thing in [Applause] Jesus Hallelujah you see so they're trying to run because what your character has been tested Hallelujah and when you're under Fire that's when your real character comes out when the trial comes believer that you see looking strong and spiritual and everything else like that oh they sh Hallelujah louder than everybody praise the Lord and when the tral comes they melt like chocolate it's true amen God wants men and women with character H time test Lord you to be like a rock for the Lord because after all you're a child of the king I'm a rock of Angel CH off of your [Applause] rock strong the Lord in the power of His might to resist that going through something right now res res the resist all of the of the disappointments [Applause] God the cross you bow he will take away your Sorrows just let him have your burdens now amen oh go your body be wed in pain and your mind trouble you surrender to him and he'll make away God will make even he has to open [Applause] the one time the master to a slave and says Moses you really believe that Bible what it says there you really believe it so much suppose your God tell you jump to the jump through that wall you still going to jump he said I'm still going to jump because if he told me to jump it's his business to know how going to make a way through the wall praise God so that's the way we ad meit trust him where you can't understand that's right yes Lord where your natural mind can understand him trust him and believe his word amen praise the name of the Lord see don't worry every when you're a real Christian the Holy Spirit comes down and seals you into the kingdom and don't you have to worry about nothing everybody will know when you really got it hallelujah oh you don't necessar have to go around speaking in Tong publicly for people know you got the Holy Ghost oh she got the Holy Ghost I heard her go she got it amen I do that privately praise the Lord hallelujah and if the spirit of God wants to give a prophecy or interpretation then it will go public amen is that right amen other than that you don't need to for people to know oh he got it you know this one got it or that one got it even more than the other one oh my God praise the Lord no see everybody will know not from the tongs is that right but from the Life of Christ right right because though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not Char it profits nothing fact you become a something drama empty empty drama a sing symbol amen keeping a whole lot of noise and behind it is not is that praise God is that right hallelujah what did the old and chief said he said much Thunder lot lightning no rain amen praise God hallelujah but we want to hold to God's unchanging hand now we know you don't have to say a word about it you don't say you don't have to say I got

the scriptures Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God you prison you no more own with the price rans he Ransom you with the blood his own blood and now you are chain to him and you are his prisoner and you do whatever he says praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen not worried about people and what people think too many people allow themselves to be imprisoned by the opinion of others rather than the presence of Christ in their Liv I'm not ashamed of him praise God ashamed to buy a head in a restaurant to pray God people going to look at you all those Petty carnal childish stuff like that at the same time I'm not I'm not talking you go the opposite way and you're praying loud because you want people to see that you're CH you see always got to have a balance amen amen praise the Lord you do these things praise the Lord hallelujah amen you know sometimes I will just take the fork and I started e oh you didn't pray I hope you I didn't pray I didn't feel like praying

watching people picking picking there this is not what you call Old McDonald have a farm a little PE here and a PE there PE we're not picking up nobody amen we are here to live a solid Christian Life hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah what kind of a pastor or Farm is going to plant a seed in somebody's heart or in the ground and every next morning you going and dig it up let me see if it's growing the next day you come back you pick it up preacher doesn't have to do that matter of fact you know with your own children you're sending them to school every day you can't watch them 24/7 you got to put the rest of the time when you're not with them or seeing them in the hands of God amen amen because he says even if you stay awake he said the Watchman watch but in vain but he that keepeth Israel I Slumber neither Slumbers nor sleep so BL it be in the Lord's hand let him take control do what you can and then take a stand I said do what you can and take oh praise God [Applause] Hallelujah Jesus Rock sh in You Got It Made In The Shame oh praise God when the Sun is hot and the rest of them are screaming and Hing how hot it is you were in the shade in that rocking rejoicing in Christ walking as a genuine Christian and seeing God expressing himself through your life aren't you glad you're a Christian glad you're serving the lord and you glad you can say I'm one of them I'm one of I'm So GL I'm I'm I'm so glad I can of them Hallelujah I'm one of them no matter what anybody say I one of them praise God forever more hallelujah oh my the Holy Spirit think about it God through the Holy Spirit brought us into his kingdom as his children and sent us the best Sho shooter that we could have from Heaven the holy spirit for he will guide you into all truth that's right and show you things to God Amen the Holy Ghost is our teacher how many knows that the Holy Ghost is our teacher praise the Lord you say oh the Holy Ghost is teacher I don't need a pastor I don't need I don't need a f Ministry I don't need any of those well the Holy Ghost teaching through the 5f ministry the the scripture said his fan is in his hand and he will toally Purge or clean up the floor well the fan you know is in his hand five fingers that's the fivefold ministry and the fan is the open word the revealed word so he grabs the revealed word by these five minist and then he's able to purge all draws and all of the you know out out of the Church of the Living God hallelujah so the Holy Spirit teaches through these ministries of course he can teach you individually and personally also but the prophet puts that that we understand but you'll never rise above your past is that right if you do then you are not to be praise the Lord because God I'm not going to bypass his representative and go to you and show you something else certainly he will reveal something you that can be helpful in the church cuz I know of that people been using the church say this that that the other praise the Lord that but then it must always be filtered through the Pastoral Ministry or the minister that's there at the time that main gift has to filter those things that's that's why he used to tell him write your dreams write your prophecy don't just take it and think you can just interpret it by yourself and and you may not be seeing everything as clearly as God will allow that man to see it I had a case where somebody had a dream and they came and and and they were tell telling it in the church I said stop don't do that they said well you know Lord I said don't do it you know because when interpretation comes you don't know what it's going to be well they didn't listen they continue talking about it and I'm preaching away one Sunday one Sunday then I noticed the whole family got mad and this and then they start jingling their car keys and stopping and next thing you stopped and they walked out what happened their own dream exposed them and it was revealed amen and I didn't wake up the dream so if you want to drink it so you can't say I made anything up the holy spirit so that's the way it is so you be careful it may not be be the way you seem or you think that's why he says many times you write it down you you you or you go to the pastor you let it be known that way rather than you go first among the congregation and spreading all kinds of stuff that you don't understand fully what it means and then come to the pastor afterwards no you don't do it you got it backwards you come to the pastor first and then you make those things known and allow the Holy Spirit if he said but I don't understand it right now I'm going to pray about it all the prophets did that they said I don't know the Lord hide it from me I don't know I have to go pray and then you pray and then God will give some interpretation or understanding and then the church moves on in an orderly fashion by the Holy Spirit praise the Lord are you following does this make sense praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so we are uh we thank God that we we are being we are here to be chored by the right chor and the trth is the holy spirit according to John 14 amen hallelujah see now when a member is born by the Holy Ghost and is proving to have these virtues in them and God can see them amen that's when you see a real son and daughter of God hallelujah that true church is going to be there the church is predestinated to be there by to adoption God is telling you you are predestinated onto adoption you are predestinated to come to that Perfection and have all those things operating in your life never mind what you think about yourself it's what he thinks about you that's why Paul said even if your heart condemns you God what he says is greater than your heart amen is that right praise the name of the Lord God is working out something right now I said God is working I believe he's in the house you believe that this is my house he's in the house he wants to with you he's in the house he in the house the SI that heal when he's in the house the crowds are gathering around and say what's going on because he's in the house even if you got to make a hole in the roof to get to church you want to make a hole in the roof because he's in the house Lord he's in the house you want to be in the house of the Lord together man of praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God Amen do you know that after a while the Holy Spirit has to make a report to upon your character he has to report about you how you were fussing [Music] fighting how you are having differences how you are going in there un separating Brotherhood oh how that must grieve God in the body of Christ these things happening in the body of Christ think about it it is our own character that is tearing us down our own character is tearing us down amen now we are children don't forget that but when you are truly born again and you a child of God you may be a child of God but a disobedient child of God is that right now what is he talking about he's not talking here about backsliding is that right because a real believer really you can't really backslide as such you can't backslide you can't be lost anymore because God can't make you a child today and make you a devil tomorrow that's right amen God is eternal and when he makes a decision is always the right decision and it doesn't change no matter how the circumstances look it doesn't change amen so you are the child of God so you can be a child but you're a disobedient child you can have your own child let's use your own child whoever they are it's your child but today it's an obedient child you couldn't want better tomorrow I met this [Music] child
