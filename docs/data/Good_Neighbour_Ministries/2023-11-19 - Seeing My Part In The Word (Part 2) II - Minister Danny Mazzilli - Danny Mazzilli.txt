anger and plenteous in Mercy he will not always chy neither will he keep his anger forever he had not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heavens are high above the Earth so great is his Mercy towards them that fear him as far as the east from the West so far he had removed our transgressions from us like as a father pth his children so the Lord pith them that fear Him for he knoweth our frame he remember that we are dust as for men the day his days are as grass as the flower of the field so he flourish for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto the children's children to such as keep

and believe that uh you would uh receive something of the Lord amen praise God God bless you Saints thank you musicians praise God I bring you all greetings from Pastor Simon brother Desmond brother Kofi they um uh we uh were in touch with them this week things are going very well they are uh ministering at a couple of different churches this morning Pastor Simon is ministering at brother Robert aqua's uh Church Pastor uh Robert Aqua he's a brother that um uh that brother Michael assari connected with at some point in the past and was um you know communicating with them on a regular basis the pastor was um you know listening in on our services even before then you know he was he would tune in and listen to Pastor Simon Minister the word and and uh was was being very blessed and then somehow the Lord just worked it all out that uh they were able to connect at um at this trip on on this trip by God's grace so yesterday I received a a text message from Pastor Aqua I didn't know who it was he just you know text me and says God bless you brother and uh trusting all is well and this and that and I said oh God bless you and I noticed that there was an emblem there from um you know brother brandham uh with the halo over his head so I figured he was a believer of the message and so I reached out to him and I said oh God bless you uh Pastor Robert and uh how did you get my contact information you know and he said oh I'm I'm here with Pastor Simon and you know brother Desmond and uh they gave me your contact information and I just thought I would reach out and you know greet you all and send greetings to the Saints and I said oh and he sent a bunch of pictures with Pastor Simon and sister desire and brother Desmond and and brother coffee and Paul is there and they're all you know um rejoicing today uh Pastor Simon is ministering for them so we trust that the Lord will just pour out a great blessing for them amen praise God and uh Pastor Simon and brother Kofi will be back and brother Paul will be back this week sometime midweek or so so they should be here on um Sunday to fellowship with us by the grace of God praise God so we've come this morning um to continue on the word of God and to continue to allow the Holy Spirit to um direct our lives and um we're staying in the same uh thought of seeing our part in the word of God we want to we want to uh continue on this and you know there's scriptures and quotes that you may have heard and you may have read so many times over and over again that's great but when the Holy Spirit wants to minister to the body in a particular way and wants to um you know instill certain Faith then we then we uh receive inspiration and God speaks to us and reveals personally yes where we fit in the whole program of God there's nothing new Under the Sun that's right but the holy spirit makes all things new amen when he wants to and he can do things that go beyond our own you know ways of thinking and we're and remember you're still only human and humans forget but thank God that he reminds us and he reminds us over and over again praise God so this morning we're going to be uh just continuing from where we left off on Wednesday and then we're going to move on from there by the grace of God and so before we do let's just pray father we're so grateful this morning Lord you have a a a program you have a a plan it's all been from before the foundations of the world you had a way of of um organizing your plan and keeping it a mystery through all the ages Lord but yet in each age a portion of that mystery was made known and the individuals that could catch that thought and catch the understanding of their day it placed them into the body of Christ and it allowed them to put be put into action and to manifest and to fulfill the word for that day and here we are once again today Lord under that same Revelation under the anointing for this day and for this hour and your anointing is power it is the power of the church to accomplish and to have preeminence in all areas and so father may you take control now through the speaker and through each heer father and bless us and take us into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we pray remembering our pastor as he ministers the word this morning in Africa may it come with great power and demonstration Lord speak to the needs there father and do a great work father as we give you all the praise the glory and the honor bring them safely home in Jesus name amen praise God let's go to the scripture 1 Corinthians 12 we read this on Wednesday night now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant you know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as ye were LED wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit God bless you you may be seated so you know when we're when we look at this scripture here and when we look at this thought like we said on Wednesday night we're seeing here that Paul is speaking to the Corinthian Church and they must have been in you know some sort of confusion because these gifts were obviously operating in their midst it was in it was in their midst they were operating but you know maybe Paul went there and the Holy Spirit showed Paul clearly that you know what there's a lot of people out of line here they don't have an understanding of these gifts and you know some of them were were were looking looking at it like competition well I can speak in tongues and you can't well I've got the the gift of Prophecy and you don't and so there was all kinds of confusion amongst them and that's why Paul had to come and literally rebuke them you know he would tell them listen I don't want you guys to be ignorant about these gifts because a lot of you are acting out of line you're not in your positions you're not understanding what it is that the word is actually asking of you and how it is that I am actually moving through these gifts that the holy spirit is the one that's moving through these gifts that they all operate by one spirit amen and having an understanding of that it it'll it'll it once you you clearly understand that it humbles you amen it brings you to a place where you realize that this is not something that that you earn you don't earn spiritual gifts amen you don't you don't earn them you don't uh you don't do anything to deserve them these gifts can operate at any time God can operate multiple gifts through one individual if he wants and God could use the least that's in the ministry that that may be the most quiet the one that you don't hear much from you don't see very much you know them trying to get into the Limelight but they've got a Ministry that is that is a solid Prayer Ministry that is supporting the ministry that is giving unction and giving an atmosphere and preparing in things for the spirit of God to come and move amen amen praise God and so we we need to understand these things and so when we're looking at these nine gifts we're going to move through this quite quickly um uh go to the next slide in the in the book of Corinthians it talks about nine spiritual gifts but actually there's a lot more gifts okay it's just how the Lord wants to um Empower each and every son and daughter of God to use them in some way and you know we were saying Wednesday that every single one of you Sons and Daughters of God have a gift amen there is something in you that God wants to bring to the surface he wants to use you he wants to manifest through you he wants you to recognize it because by you recognizing your gift and how it is that you edify by the body of Christ God gives you perfect faith God gives you rapturing Faith God's going to give you something that that you can't you can't work it up on your own but when you're just moving under the Simplicity of the word and allowing the spirit of God to use you in that particular way in that particular way then then it edifies it nourishes and it builds the body of Christ amen praise God so when we look at these nine spiritual gifts we're just going to look at it we can see them in that they fall into three divisions okay just a way of expressing it and the first is the gifts of Revelation the word of wisdom the word of knowledge Discerning of spirits and then the gifts of inspiration the the that prophecy can come forth diverse tongues and interpretations of tongues when we look at um the gifts of power then we look at the gift of faith and we see the gift of healing and the working of Miracles so when we look at these three aspects and we start by looking at the gift of revelation we see that it is something that God reveals Revelation is Supernatural and it's revealed in certain ways and we know that Revelation is what the whole church is built on it's the foundation of it all without revelation of the gift it's just works that's why faith without works but Faith with works is powerful amen praise God so the word of wisdom and so when we look at these things it's a supernatural Revelation or insight into the Divine will and purpose often given by the spirit to solve some perplexing issues or situations within the body of Christ you know all of a sudden you know we're at a meeting and the Holy Spirit you know is talking and and and ministering through one of the brothers or even one of the sisters can a sister have a spirit of w a gift of wisdom of course it's listen this is all leading up to as this series progresses it's all leading up to us recognizing uh that we have to come into the fullness of Christ and the fullness of Christ is Adam and Eve back one again amen and Adam and Eve back one again is Jesus Christ in the fullness of his spirit amen praise God and so we need to understand that the gift of Revelation is what operates through it all amen but wisdom God can give wisdom to anybody and it's not something that you know you because you've studied so long and you're a Divine you know uh PhD and lldd and so forth and you've been to you've been in in a in a a a seminary for half your life and you've learned so much about the Bible to the point where you don't believe it anymore because you've intellectualized it so much that you don't believe in the Supernatural element anymore and you're missing that element of the supernatural but wisdom God's wisdom is Supernatural it gives it when it when he wants to give it to the situation that he wants to give it to it's a gift of being able to sort through facts and data and discover what needs to be done for the church that's an example of wisdom so when we meet and we're looking for direction of the Lord and we're looking you know for for the leadership to direct the church and move it in a certain direction we're looking for the wisdom of the Lord and the Lord can come and he can anoint and give wisdom to anybody in that meeting right keep yourself open to what God can do through your life then we look at the word of knowledge the word of knowledge is a supernatural revelation of divine knowledge or Insight in the Divine Mind Of God will uh will or plan of God to know things that could not be known of oneself so God in other words God decides to you know to lead a certain brother or sister to to you know to study in certain areas and while they're studying God is releasing Revelation and giving them Supernatural knowledge on how to deal with certain aspects now that could be an aspect of dealing with the finance of the church God can give knowledge and Supernatural understanding so that when you're dealing with the finance as a trustee through the church you're doing it by the knowledge and the spirit of God and not by your own intellectual ways and the way that you would you know want it to be or your ideas or or anybody else's ideas you want it according to the knowledge and the will of God there's a supernatural element to gifts remember that they are without repentance which doesn't mean that because somebody is is uh you know not you know like uh so spiritual okay or even come to a place where they've actually been birthed by the word of God that something of knowledge supernaturally can't be spoken through them it can happen it's happened in the scriptures and it's happened around us amen praise God that's why gifts and callings are without repentance amen Discerning of spirits okay um that's that's uh also a supernatural Revelation or insight into the Realms of the spirit realm okay and it's a gift that God places usually amongst the ministry there's always going to be individuals that will have the ability to discern Spirits usually these individuals move into offices most likely offices of ministry preaching Deacon Etc okay because God is not going to be the author of confusion God is not going to have you know lay members that are you know that are just you know like they're they're they're not listen when I say just lay members you are just as important as anybody else in the body of Christ let's make that clear I do not put any uh oh I I'm I've got more Revelation than you I'm higher than you I'm lower than you no sir that does not exist in this body amen what exists is the spirit of God but we need to understand that if the holy spirit is doing things in its proper order he will do it through the authorities of the ministry he's not going to have somebody that that's that's you know a a Sunday school teacher coming up and starting to rebuke the de uh the the the deacons or the trusties and and saying you know and no if you see something as a lay member any member you see something on an individual you pray for them and you pray that the holy spirit will move through the office that it needs to move through in order to deal with that particular spirit amen so God's not going to be the author of confusion and start to put you know uh that's how this that's how the devil Works he'll come and say well I got a I got a gift of discernment brother and you've got a demon of lust on you just walk right up to the person and and and and do something like that okay there's a way of dealing with everything and God's provided way will do it in a way that it will edify it will build it will correct in love it'll be done in such a way that it'll be really you will know that it is the spirit of God and you will you will be edified and strengthened by it amen praise God then we look at Gifts of inspiration Gifts of inspiration are things that where God supernaturally starts to reveal through prophecy and prophecy is something that you know that that the holy spirit will will speak and it will not be confusion it'll be facts it will not be something that um you know that that that somebody makes up because they feel inspired to you know to to say something because they think that that's the way things are going in the world and so I'm going to get up and I'm going to prophesy here youo Church Israel is this is going to happen to Israel that's going to happen to Israel and it's going to happen before the end of the month well listen if it's the Holy Ghost and it's true then it will come to pass exactly as it was spoken but if it doesn't come to pass you don't listen to that anymore that's right actually the church will correct it and put it in its place and say you need to be silent amen because that's the way that the holy spirit is going to deal in the body of Christ amen praise God hallelujah then we look at diverse kinds of tongues the supernatural utterance of other languages and this is still very real it's still active in the church it's still a part of the of the body of Jesus Christ but it moves under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit spirit and it is not confusion so we're not going to hear all kinds of speaking in tongues and then there not be any interpretation to it when it's in its proper order there will be the tongues and there will be the interpretation that's what Paul was rebuking them for because everybody was feeling self- edified by by speaking in tongues they felt and and this is what happened in in the in the Pentecostal movement that if you did not speak in tongues then you didn't have the Holy Ghost and this is absolutely false speaking in tongues is something that is of the spirit of God and it happens when God wants to send and speak a message to the church if you listen to brother brandham and you listen to many of the tapes you will hear there are speaking in tongues and immediately after that there will be an interpretation and this is the proper order and so we want to understand that we want to understand that that that speaking in tongues is a gift but it is in its proper order and if you only feel inspired to speak in tongues and there's and it's because you're you're you're so caught up in the spirit uh great but there but there should be an interpretation of it otherwise keep silent and it's always subject to the preacher it's not going to just stand up in the middle of preaching and decide that it's got a message that's going to over ride the preacher doesn't work that way amen praise God and then there's um uh interpretation of tongues well we've covered that it's a supernatural ability to interpret when the Holy Spirit speaks in tongues through another individual or even yourself you could have both you could speak it and you could interpret it because God gives you the interpretation on it amen praise God and then there's Gifts of power and these gifts of power Gifts of faith and this is a super like you know a gift of faith we know that that's a gift of Revelation that's something that that you that you have that you know but then there's there's that Faith where you know individuals like you'll often hear me say listen either you believe it or you don't in other words you either got the faith or you don't have the faith in this particular area and if you do not have the faith in that particular area then you leave it alone but God God could give you a gift of faith in a certain area like for example in the in the in the area of healing okay where God will move supernaturally when you pray for somebody because God's placed that gift in you which is healing all right but you've got a revelation on it God's placed it in you you know that it operates you see it operate okay and you know that it's not when you want it to operate but it's when he wants it to operate amen and so people with this gift of Faith they have such great confidence in the power and the promises of God that they can stand strong in their belief no matter what tries to shake them okay they can also stand up for the church for the body of Christ okay and for their faith in such a way as to defend and actually move the church forward because they have that Faith they have that boldness on them and now God can use them in evangelism God can use them in leadership God can use them in committees amen praise God Allelujah gift of healing again it's a supernatural element the healing of all manner of sickness by Supernatural power without human Aid or medicine that's what healing is and healing can can happen in a in a a very miraculous way which is the next one the work of Miracles usually Miracles you know when the Holy Spirit does a miracle it's usually pretty instant you'll see it happen and it happens quickly and you'll know that it's a miracle and and and it'll cause a stir God will use it to stir the church and to stir the faith of the people and get the people back you know excited about the moving of the holy spirit amen so Miracles are usually instant in nature and not explainable by man then you know there's all these other gifts Okay so we've covered the nine you know major spiritual gifts that are mentioned in the book of Corinthians okay but then there's other gifts and these are the helps within the ministry and these are where you know you're gifted in certain special ways and I'm just going to give some brief you know um examples and uh Administration this is a gift of administration the ability to help steer the church or a Ministry towards a successful completion of God's given goals with skills in planning organizing and supervising these are certain skills and ability and you'll know that you have this ability because you will be inspired to to to volunteer and to move into certain uh Avenues within the ministry you're not listen you're not called to this church to just be somebody that's going to fill a Pew get it straight right now this is going home time this is where the bride comes into the perfect Faith a perfect revelation of who they are where they fit into the body of Christ what they've been called to do and to watch the supernatural move through their lives amen there's a Supernatural church right now that's coming together that's going to go in a Rapture and she needs to have Revelation on the word of God and how the Rapture is going to fulfill itself in each and every one of our Lives amen and so there's Gifts of you know of missions you know Apostle a person sent into new places with the gospel you know we're we're experiencing it right now we're seeing the fruits of it even right now our pastor and and brother coffee and brother Desmond out on the mission Fields these are things that they've been doing for years it's it's obvious it's obvious that God has placed those gifts within our ministry because we have been able by the grace of God to raise churches in different parts of the world this ministry has built and raised churches in many different countries in the world Amen now it's not because that that that that that we decided to do it it's because because God places the gifts within the ministry and then God feeds all the Avenues that are required for those gifts to move into their positions and that's why missions when when when a minister is called to be a missionary an apostle an evangelist to go out God will move on both ends of that Ministry he will open the invitation doors and he will provide everything that you have need of in order to fulfill that arm of the ministry and we want to continue to support it we want to continue to to speak it to to open ourselves to the opportunities amen but we want it to be done in its proper order under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and through the identified gifts that God has placed in this local body amen and so then you know the same thing for an evangelist the ability to successfully communicate the message of the hour amen and and do it in such a way that uh uh and especially to non-believers you know sometime like you know when when when you've got that you you'll just find yourself that you know you're talking to some people and before you know it you're on the word and you're you're you're you're being an evangelist and you don't even know it because you're sharing your testimony of how God can move how real God is how Supernatural God is God can change your situation you know brother Phillip you could be talking to one of your clients and they they've got a certain problem and a certain situation and his marriage is falling apart and he's talking to brother Phillip and brother Philip will say do you know that God can restore do you know that God Is A Healer God can heal your wife God can heal you God can take away those things do you believe those things I believe those things I've experienced those things I've seen it happen in my life you see you've got that that Evangelistic Spirit on you remember these are gifts that you could have many many gifts on you I want you to recognize where you feel the inspiration where you're feeling it where you're recognizing that God is using you at those particular times and you will know you'll know it feels good you feel energized when the spirit of God moves into a into a conversation you'll feel the atmosphere osphere it starts to tingle it starts to change around the individual you start to see that they're actually catching something and they're responding it's because God is actually speaking and wanting to deal with that P with that particular situation amen praise God uh you know the the gift of exhortation there's many of us here there's Gifts of exhortation in our midst I've seen it many times where where you know just just just an excellent gift of of of uh encouragement and and uh edifying and lifting up and you know and it discerns certain situations in your life and when it discerns it in your life it does it in a way that God you can you know that it's God you know that God wants to deliver you God is loves you cares about you and they can exort themselves in such a way that it you know it it Comforts it supports and especially someone that's down that God wants them you know to get back up again amen praise God and then there's the GI you know the gift of giving you know a giver a true Giver is somebody that when they give they have no expectation of getting it back that's you know like if you want you know you try to put a a definition on the on the on the gift of giving and you wonder how you know what is the evidence of the gift of giving well first of all God will make way for you to give amen and you'll know that that that God just blessed me what am I going to do God just poured out Another Blessing how can I you know like and I know that it came from the Lord amen I know it came from the Lord because I only did this I only did whatever I I could whatever I could possibly do and listen we need to do the things that we know we should and can do we can't be just sitting back and just waiting for money to fall from the sky or going to buy a lottery ticket and expecting that's going to be my ticket this week that's not how it works with the Lord when the Lord places that gift upon your life to give you will not have anything in your heart that you need it back you will give without the expectation you'll have a revelation that you know God says you try me and see if I don't open the windows of heaven and that Revelation in the back of your mind is saying hallelujah Lord I know you're going to open those windows I just because I see you doing it I see you doing it for others and I believe you can do it for me if you haven't experienced it yet and you're looking at others that are experiencing it and you're looking and say well why doesn't God do that for me it ain't coming your way you got the wrong attitude right off the bat that's not the spirit of giving the spirit of giving is something that when it's on you you're not afraid to give you're you're you're you're willing to even stretch sometimes to give when you can't give okay because you know that you you you know that it's part of your experience you're not looking to others to you know to to repay you you don't look at anything like that if if if you've got a spirit of giving upon you you'll do it and you will look for no you listen don't let your right hand no what your left hand is doing okay that's what the scripture says okay so there's you don't need to be uh doesn't need nobody needs to know that you're giving or that you're giving in this way or you're giving in that way you do it and you just let God do the rest Amen Let the Holy Spirit deal with everything else God knows exactly where the need is you know it's like we're it's like we're saying about you know the Christmas dinner there are individuals that may be going through you know a little short season okay we've all gone through those periods of life where all of a sudden you know that extra payment needed to be done or one of the kids needed a payment for college or university and this comes up and that comes up and all of a sudden at the end of the month you're saying holy smokes I'm short well listen the body of Christ we need to come into the Revelation because this is all around the gift of giving amen I haven't left that topic yet okay we need to come into the understanding of how the body of Christ the the scripture says that the body every joint supplieth the other joint there's a there's a way that God moves through the body of Christ that can supply all the needs that are within the ministry every son and daughter of God is important to God Amen and so when we have an understanding of that then we can have confidence we're not going to be the kind of people listen if you've got if you've got the wrong spirit and you're just going to take advantage and you're going to do things don't worry the holy spirit will deal with you in those areas we're not worried about those things okay you need to understand that there are times and Seasons when you cannot give you cannot do those things that you want to do and so the body of Christ is set up in such a way especially if the ministry that you're under is operating under that Revelation not every ministry will operate in that way especially in this level of of faith and understanding because there's a lot of churches out there that they operate and their giving is what they push all the time give give give give you're not going to hear that coming from this pulpit you're going to give by faith and by Revelation and when you do it that way it allows the supernatural to come on the scene and when there's times where you're short and you can't give the body will provide because the listen the body provides for itself when when the body listen when you get a bruise you ever notice that it you know you get this blue and black buildup that's a bruise that's because all of a sudden there's been some damage done in that area over a period of time you'll see that bruise disappear naturally you don't know how it's happening but it's happening and sometimes we come into times in our lives where we get bruised in a financial situation and we you we you know yeah maybe you even made a mistake but because of the Revelation that you get back up again in order for God to continue to use you and move you through that mistake you can get back up and God will provide a way for that bruise to come and be naturally healed thank you Jesus the body operates in such a miraculous way that it's it's just Supernatural it's tremendous and we're blessed to be a part of the body of Christ amen amen praise God and so there's giving then there's you know and then there's Hospitality there's individuals that are given to the gift of hospitality they know how to welcome people they know how to you know entertain people in a way that makes them feel welcome makes them feel that they're that they're a part of the body of Christ amen we want all these gifts to activate we want everybody to to move and get into a spirit you know every single one of us should have the spirit of hospitality I'm not talking about the gift but the spirit of hospitality just the simple way of greeting one another with a smile SM with a smile not a frown with a smile it's good to see you brother it's good to see you sister God bless you you know and and and it's it's hospitable it's just makes people feel welcome praise God amen glory to God hallelujah we're almost done with these a gift of Mercy there's you know there's there's Gifts of Mercy it's right in in in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 there you know when when you being merciful do it as as as the mercy of God because God is a merciful god God is not a judgment God all the time God is going to judge the Earth God is going to judge according to whatever is against his word but God is God has a heart of mercy and we should have a heart of Mercy we should be able to be compassionate and merciful to one another when we Fellowship when we when we Ed ify when we encourage one another amen it's it's uh you know this is definitely a trait of a person with great sensitivity for those who are suffering it manifests itself in offering compassion encouragement and in love for giving practical help to somebody that's in need amen serving a talent for identifying tasks needed for the body of Christ and using available resources to get the job done you know you will notice things within the body of Christ you will see things within the body of Christ where you know that you could help that you could serve and you can move into those positions and you can do it in the proper way by going to the heads by going to the Committees we have we have committees here you if you if you're unsure you see one of the trust they'll direct you or one of the deacons they'll direct you if you you see an area where you want to serve and you feel that maybe this is an area where I can serve because you know what I've got the gift of teaching you know well guess what we need Sunday school teachers and so if that gift is something that you feel you feel passionate about and and you want to be able to offer it unto the Lord that's a gift that you can give back to the body of Christ and you need to see sister Jennifer for the the superintendent of the Sunday school and let her know that hey you know what I I I think I would like to you know exercise my uh Zeal to be a Sunday school teacher or to assist in with with the young people or or the or the children maybe to be an assistant to start out in whatever way let the holy spirit guide you into your position naturally don't don't do it now because brother Danny said oh we need Sunday school teachers I'll just go do that no pray about it get the spirit of God the leadership of the Holy Spirit on it on on on you in prayer and see if it's something that the Lord wants you to move into and then go step out hearing recognizing and then what acting on the word of God Amen God wants you to act upon it God will vindicate God will confirm what it is that that he wants you to do amen pray praise God and that was our last you know the last and then you know there's the they call it general gifts of helps you know where you all of a sudden you feel led to help one individual one of the ministers you know that's that's you know that that you can do certain things to help him to prepare for certain aspects or make yourself available hey brother you know I know you're going to be ministering this this uh Sunday is there anything that you would like you know that you need done is there anything I can help with you know and it's usually helps in specific areas and specific ways so you see how many different Avenues and Gifts God has within the body of Christ amen praise God let's go to the next slide now we want to get into you know nobody listen to brother Braham speaking here three kinds of Believers we know that there's three kinds of Believers in every church it's unfortunate but it's just the way that it is all right right but God has a way of weaving out I believe if we work hard enough there's only going to be one super natural believing body of Jesus Christ in this church and when it happens the Miracles are going to happen one after the other healings are going to take place one after the other because Satan's power is going to be it's going to be he won't know who to use anymore because you know he needs to use somebody he'll use he'll use individuals right here within these walls to to try try and tear down but let's let's move on here nobody can take your place no matter how little you say I'm just a housewife yeah you're a powerful housewife if you've got the Holy Ghost amen you've got a Supernatural Ministry as a housewife if you've got the Holy Ghost because you can now pray for your husband you can pray for your children you can pray for the church you can pray for the preaching you are a supernatural housewife you're not just an ordinary housewife when you've got Revelation nobody can take your place amen God in his great economy has set so has so set so the body of Christ in order till there's no one can take your place that's important to understand Saints no one can take your place how I would like brother B says how I would like to take Billy Graham's place any of us ministers but we can't do it but just remember Billy can't take our Place amen listen there's Ministries out there I'm telling you I go sometimes I'm flipping through YouTube and I look at some of these Ministries that are out there and these guys are getting 800,000 views you know preachers you know uh they got they got two million followers it's it's remarkable you know and then I'll go in there and I'll you know I'll say you know what let me hear what this guy saying let me you know because it's if it's the word of God and I've got a revelation that I don't I don't I don't look at Flesh and Blood I look at the word of God and God has given me the Holy Ghost and he said I will lead you into all truth when the Holy Ghost is on you you're going to be able to discern truth and you're going to be able to feed on the truth and you'll be able to like brother Bram says spit out the pits amen but it's amazing these ministries of these individuals they're operating Ministries Worldwide they're bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars it's remarkable but then you listen and they're preaching on the Trinity they're preaching on things that are you know on on doctrines of their church if we're going to have a class 101 in this church for new believers then we are going to teach doctrines from the Bible not doctrines from the church amen praise God and so you know it's amazing but yet these individuals have a incredible Ministries Billy Graham had an amazing Ministry it was worldwide and and and It produced hundreds of millions of dollars in offerings and so forth but that was his ministry our ministry if you go back into the word of God and you see clearly how our ministry fit in the scriptures from Genesis to Revelation you will see that it is a Supernatural Ministry it is not governed by the doctrines of man it is LED and controlled by the leadership of the Holy Ghost and it'll always be that way see we all have a Place some of us are evangelists some prophets some teachers some pastors whatever we are some Housewives here he goes again some mechanics oh yeah brother Mike even mechanics in the body of Christ Oh yeah and when God wants to use that gift and raise it up in whatever way just like he did with brother Alvin there when we were having the the youth meetings and the power went out God had every everything ready to go Hallelujah because somebody was sitting in their position and were willing and and ready and yielded to the spirit of God to do certain things and just naturally does these things that's why the greatest gifts let me tell you are the ones that you will not see uh you know being projected or lifted up or anything like that but they are the ones that that really do things in the background because God is a humble God the spirit of God is is is surrounded in humility amen and when you've truly got a gift of God and it and it operates in your life you you will you will bring that that Spirit of Pride that tries to control because remember that the pride of life you know the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh those three things will attack you over and over and over again but you need to to bring you need to bring those things that's where we overcome that's where we got to we just got to bite the tongue once in a while and just wait on the Lord let him come and give it in such a way that it's just going to it's going to be in an in an edification and it's going to build the body of Christ amen praise God we want that kind of a spirit of humility because that's how the Holy Spirit operates and these gifts usually a lot lot of times they won't be a public show they're not going to be a public show don't be looking for big public shows if God wants to do something Supernatural because he needs to bring somebody into the church and deliver them supernaturally like he did for me and like he's done for many of you in certain situations in your life to get your attention he'll do it amen but then he'll just move on and carry on with the program of God some mechanics some Farmers what Whatever It Is God has set you in your place see amen praise God let's go to the next slide in Romans chapter 12 just going to take a quick drink here in Romans chap 12: 1- 4 we see here speaking to the Romans he says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God there's a foundation to serving God and having a gift that is gonna that is gonna actually benefit the body of Christ and without the foundation and understanding of renewing of your mind and and feeding on the word and and and coming into the presence of the Lord and and fellowshipping around the word and and making sure you read your scriptures and your Bible every every day and listen to the messages listen to brother brandham listen to the to the to the preaching of the word you're you're constantly Renewing Your Mind when you're doing that okay because you forget that's why you you know you you you're going to hear things today that that you're going to say praise God hallelujah there it is right there in the scripture look for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think there it is right there you see how how you know how the the the gifts they have to operate in such a way because remember it it it edifies and it and it builds the body and it feeds itself so you are you are feeding and you are being fed in the body of Christ and so he doesn't he says don't don't think you're you're more High than than anybody else but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man the measure of Revelation so you can't be anything more than what you are that's right and what what you are naturally and and what you do without trying that's the faith that that gets expressed through your life amen in your everyday living in your everyday fellowshipping in your everyday talk in the way that you work you know listen a person that is a that is a help in the church that is somebody that's good at you know uh leadership or good at you know organizing they're usually good at that at their workplace and at home they usually have that that that same aspect upon their lives and then God just triggers it as a gift in the body and all of a sudden the individual starts to get blessed they don't know why they just got a raise at work all I did was you know last week I went and did this at the church nobody knew about it but Lord all of a sudden the boss comes to me and he says I need to have an interview with you uhoh I'm in trouble no you're not you just got a raise you just got a promotion you just got moved because God Is providing your needs because now you have the revelation of him being your provider amen he's your boss he's who you work for not for for brother so and so or Pastor so and so I'm doing this for him and because I got that Revelation he's watching over me amen it just it just happens it's just natural amen so so God according to the measure of the faith that he's given you for as now watch it says here for for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office see God has given us particular individuals that are suited in the in the right way so that God can use it in the body to build to edify and to bring us to that place of full maturity which is the goal go to the next slide he says nobody can take your place and you shouldn't try to take anybody else's place it's as simple as that be yourself be what God made you to be do what you do listen if you've been doing it in the house of the Lord for the last 20 30 years or last 20 30 days whatever it is just keep doing it amen God will confirm vind indicate and if there's any problem in that area the holy spirit will deal with it if not just keep doing what you're doing because guess what it's blessing the body okay if you see certain situations happening they will interpret themselves it'll come up it'll it'll become visible the holy spirit will show it to the proper office within the ministry to deal with it in whatever way it needs to be dealt with and God will do it amen praise God he says because you are an individual to God and God has a purpose for you he made you thus you say why did he do it because he's Sovereign God knew the end from the beginning God knew you before you came to this earth God knew that you would come under a certain family under certain influences under certain atmospheres God knew all the things that you had to deal with in growing up but listen when God wants to call you and place you there's no demon in in hell that can stop it amen glory to God he says because God is not listen we're always going to be that way he's got a reason for for making you that way we're always going to be that way because God is not a Sears and robu Harmony House Hallelujah he doesn't just put out clones and everybody's the same everybody's doing the same thing can you imagine a church where everybody everybody's a preacher everybody just wants to preach and they just they got to be a preacher and and and and and we don't need and the house of the Lord would be a mess there'd be spider webs everywhere there'd be a mess everywhere and we would never be able to operate as a living mystical Body of Christ he is a god of variety he makes one one way and another another but we must serve him the way way that God made us and be glad be happy that God made you that way use it for his glory and and turn it for good Hallelujah you know I used to be a feisty kind of guy back in the world and and and you know my wife even once in a while you know when when somebody cuts me off or something she settle down settle down you know like you know it's just it's just you know because there was just certain aspects but I was a go-getter I go get it man let's let's go let's go grab it let's do what we got to do amen but now God you know he he takes the gifts and he starts to mold them and shape them in such a way that he can use it in the right way and he can start molding and shaping each and every one of our lives and take the certain aspects that you've been built and and molded and shaped by amen and turn it into something that's it's going to be a Powerhouse in the house of the Lord amen praise God hallelujah I never I never imagine brother Phillip would have the the the anointing that that comes upon him to preach the word from time to time brother Tim you know brother Chris the the the the wisdom and the and the teaching uh ability that comes you would have never known that but you see when the gifts get exercised that's what starts to happen all of a sudden the maturity starts to come God starts dealing with the individual lives God starts to show that hey this is an office and you better take it serious you know I I'm going to move through that office I'm going to use that office and I want you to yield yourself surrender yourself and these gifts when we yield ourselves to them when we give to God God uses us and all of a sudden now we've got all these different powerhouses that God is developing because listen when the anointing comes on somebody that's the ultimate power of God did you know that if an anointing comes on somebody to pray over somebody with cancer and that person is healed right there and then only the power of God can do that no man can do that no man can claim I did this or I did that it's God when he wants to move and he wants to send his anointing that's why we just listen I get scared sometimes I got to preach again Sunday oh man Lord help me I'm out to the Lord amen I said Lord I need your help you know I pray for these brothers I know what it's like you know like you got to you got to you got to focus in on the Lord and you got to allow the Holy Spirit to you know to do you see you you got to do what you know you can and should do remember that then God adds to it God moves so don't be afraid when you're called to a position if if all of a sudden you know myself or one of the deacons or one of the trustees comes to you and says hey brother you know sister would you be able to assist in this area you you just you just right there and then say brother sister you know what I'm going to pray about that thank you very much or maybe God's already showed you and then because remember God works on both ends hey and all of a sudden brother Mike walks up to you and says hey brother you know my goodness you did such a beautiful job there on that uh you know when you fix those steps and you know and this and that I just so appreciate what you did and thank God you know praise God we thank God for the for the for the flooring company down the street there you know that those by the way those steps I went and ordered those steps it was a $5 or $1,800 order I didn't know this person I just knew that there were a friend of a friend and he says go to him I said okay I'm going to go to him I went there I said I need to order steps went to the order desk the order came out oh he says oh yeah Tony mentioned you were coming this and that okay what do you need measured it all out boom boom boom everything else called me okay they're in I said oh good wonderful I said uh I'm going to get a check and and just give me the amount you know I know that you gave me an estimate at the time he says oh no he says we're donating it I said I said what I thought in my mind I said wow I said Lord you're something else you're something else I said praise God I said to him I said all I could say to him I said my friend let me tell you you something you're in for one big blessing I can tell you that okay and I just want you to know how much we appreciate that you know and when I went to pick it up and we thanked him and praise God and we brought it here and you know by the grace of God that's just the grace of God that's how God works because he knows the desires he knows what we're doing he knows that you know that that we have budgets and everything else God knows all those things we don't have to be fearful or worried God is still Jehovah Gyra and he will continue to provide until we get out of here and that's that's I I don't see it any other way and you'll either Believe it or you don't Hallelujah let's go to the next slide Romans chapter 12 we're just going to continue on the same scripture from verse five now he says so we being many are one body in Christ he's making this very clear here and everyone members one of another you mean we're all related I thought we talked Hey Brother Hey sister well last time I checked brothers and sisters they're related they're all members of the same family and especially this family of God because this family I could tell you of millions and billions of families that are gone but this family it doesn't end this is an eternal family it had no beg Look up the word Eternal had no beginning and it'll have no end am and so you are going to be my brother and sister into eternity you may not like me in certain areas and certain ways down here as a human but I promise you when we are both in our Eternal State theophany bodies there will be no iron to rub against Hallelujah glory to God we are going to be Brothers and Sisters in Christ and we're going to say Hey Brother let's go for a little trip to the other side of the world and we're going to be there and fellowship for a couple of thousand years because time will mean nothing Hallelujah brothers and sisters into eternity glory to God he says so being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the portion of Revelation in other words God reveals it to you and you know that it's a clear Revelation then you can you can give the prophecy amen don't be afraid you got to allow the gift to operate but you'll know if it's God or not and sometimes you know you want to run it by your pastor you want to allow the deacons to to to you know to you get a certain uh Vision or a certain dream you write it down you you go and you see you know you should go and see your Deacon and your Deacon will direct it to the pastor if necessary amen praise God and so according to the grace that is given to us whether prophesy let us prophesy accord or Ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation see here's all those other gifts he that giveth let him do so what with Simplicity what were we saying keep it simple don't try and make your giving such a a complicated thing and you got to go and all do all the math every month and you got to make sure that it's exactly 10% you know what I'm saying like do it in Simplicity allow the Holy Spirit to just you know uh guide you and and direct you in Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy see there it is with cheerfulness look at that mercy and cheerfulness now you just did something that is absolutely ridiculous and you you you you you hurt somebody and the deacon now is going to come there and he's going to correct that situation the Deacon you know he's if he's got Mercy in his mind now cheerfulness doesn't mean make a joke of it we're not going to make any jokes of anything but we are going to approach it with the right attitude to not slay the person person and make them feel even worse for doing what they did because they got trapped the devil set a trap and he beat them and boom he knocked them right down and God exposed it because he wants to deliver the individual not because he wants to kill him or destroy him or destroy his influence you understand amen it's important so listen with with cheerfulness let love be without dissimilation abore that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectioned one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring the other preferring the other we need to be reminded of these things you know I appreciate going through this series here because I'm learning so much about how God is dealing with me and molding my character and my ways and you know my certain characteristics because remember this is all about maturity this is all about God maturing and giving you the character for the next stage of your ministry yes whatever it might be even if it is for a thousand years ruling with Christ here on Earth remember the only thing you're going to take with you is your character amen that's it and you're going to have to have character that's fit to rule because character without power without character cannot rule it just it just makes a mess of things amen praise God let's go to the next slide so here first Corinthians now just to just to you know to confirm in 1 Corinthians 12:6 it says and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit himself is that what it said no no it said with all so whatever the spirit is doing and operating through your life is because he's trying to profit the whole entire body of Christ amen praise God Ephesians 4:16 says from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint Supply look at this just the way the Revelation that he had here according to the effectual working in the measure of every part my God he's talking about every every little detail of your body every aspect of the body of Christ every individual you might think you're not important the little girls that come up here and and bring our purpose statement and those young children that that do those plays and sing those songs and and and and the worship team when they're up there under the anointing and they they've taken their position as a serious position as a musician and so forth do you know that the spirit is riding those strings it's riding those drums it's riding the voices because the voices are consecrated unto the Lord they've they've got an understanding that they've been called they've got an understanding that it's not because they want to be seen I'm up here listen if the wrong spirit is on you while you're up here people see it amen I'll tell you right now you better be up here because you've got a spirit of humility and you want to create an atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to bring us into Heavenly places so that we can feed on the word of God than you Jes that should be the desire to be up here not any other reason or any other motive and your life needs to be in its proper order amen praise God hallelujah so and he says according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh look it it increases maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself itself in love love what's the Capstone that we keep seeing above the church ages love what's going to take us brother Braham says one of these mornings there's going to be an anointing which is the power of God to come down and he says It'll be such a love that it'll sweep you right out of your body you won't even know in the moment in the twinkling of an eye you're going to be changed Hallelujah because God's love is the is the Fulfillment of his whole Plan of Redemption his love is the blood that flows through our bodies Hallelujah without the Holy Spirit without the love of God flowing through a body without blood that body is as good as dead hallelujah it's good for nothing amen it's just a dead carcass brother B says it's worth a couple dollars amen praise God but when it's got the anointing when it's got the blood flowing through it the Holy Spirit operating in all the gifts and nourishing and edifying it starts to edify itself let's go to the next scripture listen We Are One we are one this is Brother Braham speaking here in Christ The Mystery of God revealed I've been so blessed in reading that book you know over the last couple of weeks if you get a chance read it listen to it do both he says we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you and go and chop it off it doesn't make any sense he says I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand but you're a left hand why you trying to make the left do something that the right can only do leave it alone let the right stay where it is let the left stay where it is amen he says he's my left hand I want him to stay there Hallelujah even the little tip of my finger you try to pick something up if you lose the tips of your fingers go try and pick something up it's not easy amen he says I want my little finger to stay right there I want it to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another amen praise God forever more go to the next slide so what is it in summary we are joints that Supply one another we Supply and we edify one another we are spiritually linked to one another you're my brother you're my sister you come from God you're going back to God and I'm coming with you amen we are attributes of God then we will have a revelation of who our father is amen we will know exactly where we stand we will understand that God has called us into a local assembly for a purpose you don't want to be leaving here today and wondering and being confused if there's anything you want to be wondering about just let it be look Lord I am excited about being put into my position where you want me to be used because when you get into that position a supernatural anointing will come upon your entire life because your ministry in the body of Christ is something that affects everything around you outside of this church no matter where you are whatever you're doing you become like an anointing like Joseph on you that everything you start to touch starts to prosper amen it may take some time because there's things around you and things you're dealing with and things that you're overcoming that's okay that's okay I've been around the message for 20 years I've been around for 30 years I've been I don't care how many years you've been around you still need perfecting amen because until you come into the fullness and you come into the unity and you come into the revelation of your position and how it is that God is using it in love and how God wants you to to understand that that we're spiritually linked to one another Hallelujah then you're you're you're you're still going to need perfecting you're still going to need to hear the word you're still going to need to to to be molded and shaped by the word of God I need to be molded and shaped every single day by the word of God amen the minute that you think you don't need to be shaped and molded anymore you're in trouble I'm telling you right now you're going to start to see things happening around you and you're wondering why is this going on why is that happening what what's going on here what's going on there because you got to stay with the program of God you got to allow yourself to be surrendered and yielded and and let the Holy Spirit have his way when we join the body we become responsible for one another you got to start thinking about how you affect the rest of the body by the way that your attitude and by the way that you come into the house of the Lord you come in prepared or you comeing in all ruffled up because you got up late and you didn't get your coffee and you're miserable no I'm serious we need to know that we have to be responsible for one another and the way we greet one another the way we treat one another and the way we we acknowledge one another is very important especially as a body of Believers that we come into the house of the Lord we need to come in we're coming into this Sanctuary we don't want to bring anything but a sweet humble spirit before God so that the spirit of God can move and minister to the needs of the people and lift burdens and and heal sicknesses and and and supernaturally provide needs that's what this Sanctuary is for amen listen it all all starts in the house of the Lord Brother Chris right it all starts right here where we come in and we come in broken down we come in broken up and you know maybe we need something and if you come in with the right Revelation and the right understanding you will not leave the same way you will leave with the joy of the Lord that you can't even explain it God's anointing you cannot explain it comes when it wants we don't live selfishly anymore but we live for one another AMJ Hal Hallelujah yes sir we love and we protect one another let's go to the next quote here brother Bram speaking here he says and after making my own Consecration and after making having the church do so now if God blessed us the way that he has in these last few meetings he's talking about how he set himself aside you know as the minister for for a series of meetings that week he says with that little consecration what will he do if we keep it up see if we get into a uh you know if if we just start from today we start coming to church on time you know what on time is at least half an hour 15 half an hour before church starts that's on time when you walk into the sanctuary I don't care what office you're in by the way 11:00 the worship service starts you should be in here worshiping the Lord and getting into that atmosphere and praising God and bringing down the anointing so that the Holy Spirit can meet the needs of the body hallelujah praise God there's offices that have been assigned there's there's there's ushers that that that are covering the doors and everything else we're safe you just need to get into the sanctuary and you need to do your part heart so that God can do his amen praise God there's time after or if you need to do something you got to come a little earlier then and get it done so that you can be in the sanctuary amen he has a he has in the last few meetings so he says now just keep it up now listen you're in love with one another now I seen you standing in the aisles this morning and this week with your hands to God and the lovely Spirit moving around over you he says now don't you listen to one foul thing the devil has got to say he's now he's because you know we know that the enemy is going to attack okay even after this preaching I'll tell you right now there's going to be some attacks but that's okay that's that's that's God vindicating and showing that you know what the word it was what I wanted to say so just be under expectation but be aware but know that God will never allow anything more than what you have been ordained and designed to handle amen he says now listen he says don't you listen to one foul thing the devil's got to say see if the devil shows you some or tells you something evil about one of the members of the body of Christ don't you believe it now that's a rule you hear something unless that thing has been absolutely investigated properly by the Holy Ghost through the proper channels and avenues you do not believe it and you do not repeat it you do not even allow it to be gone any further and if it's coming to you and it's not supposed to come to you you stop that person right there and then and say wh you need to speak to your Deacon and that's important we want to protect so he says here he he says don't you believe it for as soon as you believe it you Mar your experience can you imagine because all of a sudden if you're believing that without proper investigation and and and all of a sudden you've just been given an evil report about somebody do you know that that all of a sudden there's a picture in your mind of that person and if you're not careful and you don't know how to handle that you could have a a complex and all of a sudden you'll never trust that person again and meanwhile it's not even proven yet that that it actually happened but that's the way the devil works so be careful amen he says he says for as soon as you believe it you Mar your experience and if you see one of the members of the body of Christ doing something evil don't tell nobody else amen now it doesn't mean you don't tell absolutely nobody else you got to understand here he's talking about you going to another brother or sister that has no reason whatsoever to know about it at all and you start going to talk about it with them did you see that what he did there and what she did there and oh my goodness and everything else that's not the spirit of God I'll tell you right now that's not how we kick the devil out the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee he says now watch he says for as soon as you believe you Mar and if you are one of doing something don't tell nobody else but go to that member and with love and see if you can't bring them back to Christ again if you feel confident enough that you can go because sometimes there are things that you know between sisters and stuff like that you don't need to go to the Deacon if it's something you know you're an elder sister and you want to help that sister you should go and help that sister and sit down with that sister and say Hey sister I just want to bring something to your attention you know and and and I'm doing it because I love you because I want us to to to be strong in the Lord I want us to be I want us to be a Powerhouse as the body of Christ I don't want any division amongst us I don't want any separation and you will tell that person and then and then so you know he goes on he says with love and see if you can bring that person back to Christ again and if you can't do it then tell one other person that's where you'll go to a deacon and the Deacon will do it all in the proper way okay or let them go with you do it the way listen do it the way the scripture says see but don't if somebody says sister so and so and brothers so and so don't you believe one word of it you just leave it go because remember it's the devil trying to tear you to pieces now just look for him to come in cuz he'll do it that's he's talking about look for the Holy Spirit to come into it now you let the good man of the house fake stand right there and don't you receive one thing these people have been set in Heavenly places with you to Fellowship together around the blessings of God taking the communion at the table and the Holy Spirit has witness that they are the children of god let's just be real sweet kindhearted forgiving loving and if the person other person talks evil against you you talk sweet against them amen hallelujah watch how sweet comes to you then see that's right just always return good for evil and love for hate so the next scripture in Romans 12 sorry let the music musicians come because I'm not going to go any further we're going to stop right here so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the portion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministry or he teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation that means don't have favoritism abore that which is evil and cleave to that which is good be kindly affectionate one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another may the Lord bless and add something to your experience as a son or a daughter of God this morning that the word of God would have an effect on your lives that You' you'd be you'd be confident to go and change certain aspects of of you know bad habits that you might have Etc because this is a time where the Holy Spirit wants us to come into that fullness into the maturity and that's what we're going to be going into next we're going to be looking at how the body of Christ is
