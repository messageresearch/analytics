[18:50] to be in the house of the Lord amen amen
[18:53] let us go to uh the scriptures tonight
[18:56] this Bible study
[18:58] so we'll just be read in a lot of
[19:00] scripture and some quotes and and pray
[19:04] that God will give us a little bit of
[19:05] inspiration on it Hallelujah and God
[19:08] will speak to your heart somehow some
[19:10] way that you'll leave today and and uh
[19:13] something will open up to you amen
[19:16] Ephesians 4 16 is a pretty lengthy
[19:19] scripture here because I want to talk
[19:22] about
[19:23] um
[19:24] uh character under the power
[19:27] of the third pull
[19:29] will overcome
[19:31] a character that's under the power of
[19:33] the third poll which we know the third
[19:35] poll is the revealing of the word
[19:38] amen so a character under the revealing
[19:40] of the word will overcome in this hour
[19:43] God has given us everything that we have
[19:45] need of
[19:47] he's given us everything we there's
[19:49] nothing that he's lacked in this bride
[19:52] and and nothing that uh you know uh
[19:57] Abraham might and Sarah might have
[19:59] thought you know
[20:00] or they might have thought in that day
[20:02] you know there was something lacking but
[20:04] when God speaks his word when God gives
[20:06] a promise everything is there everything
[20:09] that it that is needed is released
[20:12] through the spoken word to make it come
[20:14] to pass and fulfill so everything that
[20:17] is spoken and that's what we have to we
[20:19] have to come into the house of the Lord
[20:21] not only the house of Lord but seven
[20:22] days a week we gotta believe that in our
[20:25] heart regardless of what we're seeing or
[20:28] what we're experiencing we got to
[20:30] believe that above anything else we got
[20:33] to believe this word
[20:35] when we start believing that word like
[20:37] this we're going to start seeing that
[20:39] same character that was developed in the
[20:41] prophet in US amen Ephesians 4 16.
[20:46] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[20:49] together and come backed by that which
[20:52] joint every joint supplyeth according to
[20:56] the affection working in the measure of
[20:59] every part maketh increase of the body
[21:02] unto the edifying of itself in love this
[21:05] I say therefore and testify in the Lord
[21:08] that yea henceforth walk not as other
[21:11] Gentiles walk
[21:13] in the vanity of their mind having the
[21:17] understand and darken being aliated from
[21:21] the life of God through the ignorance
[21:24] that is in them because of the blindness
[21:27] of their hearts
[21:28] who being
[21:30] passed feeling have given themself over
[21:34] to lucidness which means sexual weakness
[21:38] to work all uncleanness with greediness
[21:42] but yea have not so learned Christ
[21:47] if so be that ye have heard him and have
[21:52] been taught by him as the truth is in
[21:55] Jesus that ye put off concern in the
[21:58] former conversation the old man which is
[22:01] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[22:05] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[22:07] mind
[22:09] and that ye put on the new man which
[22:13] after God is created in righteousness
[22:15] and true Holiness amen as we go along
[22:18] here you're seeing the character of God
[22:22] amen it's all in the scripture
[22:25] wherefore putting away lion speaking
[22:28] every man truth to his neighbor for we
[22:30] are members one of another be ye angry
[22:34] and sin not let not the sun go down upon
[22:37] your wrath neither give place to the
[22:39] devil
[22:40] let him that stole steal no more but
[22:43] rather let him labor working with his
[22:45] hands the thing which is good that he
[22:48] may have to give to them to him that
[22:51] needeth let no corrupt communication
[22:54] proceed out of your mouth
[22:56] but that which is good to the use of
[23:00] edifying that it may Minister Grace unto
[23:04] the hearers
[23:05] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[23:07] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[23:10] your Redemption let all bitterness and
[23:12] all wrath and all anger and clamor and
[23:15] evil speak and put away from you with
[23:17] all malice be kind one to another
[23:20] tenderhearted forgiven one another even
[23:23] as God for Christ's sake has forgiven
[23:25] you

[24:07] accomplished in the Brethren that are in

[26:17] and when we suffer it says right here
[26:20] our suffering brings us to a place
[26:24] of perfection
[26:26] he he makes us perfect
[26:28] he establishes us he strengthens us he
[26:31] settles us down
[26:33] that we may be still
[26:35] in this life
[26:37] Hallelujah so we're not tossed to and
[26:39] fro amen
[26:41] the devil seeks who he he's tossed to
[26:44] and fro he's seeking who he may devour
[26:46] but God is doing the opposite to his
[26:49] people
[26:50] he's building a character in them
[26:53] amen we see the wave Sheep amen we see
[26:57] Jesus Christ as our wave sheet we see
[27:00] that same wave sheet came into the
[27:02] prophet of the Living God we've seen the
[27:05] character being built even Jesus himself
[27:07] had to learn obedience amen by the
[27:11] things that he suffered he had to learn
[27:13] it he was God in flesh but he had to
[27:15] learn it and even more so us he didn't
[27:18] bypass this theophany we bypassed it
[27:21] into a sinful nature we were darkened
[27:24] aliated as separated from God the seed
[27:28] was not awakened alive so the only thing
[27:31] that we lived the only thing that we
[27:33] knew and we understand and that
[27:36] developed most of our Lives was our
[27:38] sinful nature
[27:41] that's that is that is
[27:44] you know my brothers and sisters
[27:46] that is the power when I look at that I
[27:49] don't look at my weaknesses I don't look
[27:52] at the generational things that were
[27:53] passed down I don't look at the things
[27:56] that are impossible in my life amen we
[27:59] see those things amen we all do when we
[28:02] look in the mirror we see those things
[28:04] but I look to the word of God I look to
[28:08] the power of God I look to the spoken
[28:11] word because that's the only thing in
[28:14] this hour that's going to cause us to
[28:16] overcome
[28:19] Brother Brad says justification ain't
[28:22] good enough sanctification ain't good
[28:24] enough in this hour baptism of the Holy
[28:26] Ghost is not good enough it's the Holy
[28:28] Ghost himself
[28:29] amen
[28:31] because it's got to produce a Rapture
[28:33] and there's only one person he is the
[28:36] resurrection in life he's the only one
[28:39] that can produce a Rapture in US
[28:41] so he's got to have the full preemness
[28:44] in US
[28:45] oh my
[28:48] we are not just a religion we are not
[28:51] just a Community Church
[28:53] amen we're gathered under the spiritual
[28:56] tent of the supernatural God
[28:59] transforming human beings
[29:02] Hallelujah
[29:03] you talk about alienated
[29:06] from this world
[29:07] you talk about aliens
[29:10] they are aliens to us and we are aliens
[29:13] to them
[29:15] they glorify the flesh they worship the
[29:18] flesh they're they're exalt In the Flesh
[29:21] they're feeding the flesh making us
[29:23] stronger and stronger and here we are
[29:25] dying out to the flesh amen
[29:28] died out to the flesh
[29:30] oh my
[29:32] glory to God
[29:34] Luke 10 18.
[29:38] and he said
[29:40] unto them I beheld Satan as Leighton
[29:43] fallen from heaven
[29:46] behold I give unto you power to tread on
[29:48] serpents and on scorpions
[29:51] and of all over all the power of the
[29:54] enemy
[29:55] and nothing by Shall any means hurt you
[29:58] now listen to that
[30:01] Hallelujah we see Satan has fallen
[30:04] we see that Satan is defeated
[30:08] if we get an understanding in a
[30:10] revelation in our hearts God will reveal
[30:13] that to us that Satan is a defeated foe
[30:18] he can never never overcome or conquer a
[30:23] son and daughter of God
[30:25] He Has Fallen
[30:27] not only that we have been given Power
[30:30] To Tread on him to tread on serpents on
[30:34] scorpions
[30:36] and all the power of the enemy that will
[30:39] come into your life
[30:42] all I need listen I need to speak my own
[30:45] world I need to create my own atmosphere
[30:48] and go live on it
[30:49] amen
[30:51] I gotta work out my own salvation so
[30:54] what is in my life Hallelujah that is
[30:58] the scripture for what's in my life the
[31:01] Scorpions amen the snakes all the demon
[31:06] power that came along and try to follow
[31:08] me through my life I have been given
[31:11] power over them
[31:14] and it's up to me as an individual and
[31:17] up to you as an individual to overcome
[31:20] those powers
[31:21] in your life
[31:23] and there's only one way to do it is by
[31:26] the word
[31:28] Satan cannot fight against this word
[31:34] Hallelujah
[31:40] listen Saints we don't desire to be
[31:43] perfect in the flesh
[31:45] when we try
[31:47] to control the circumstances in our life
[31:51] and the people around us
[31:54] amen that's where we get into trouble
[31:57] God doesn't want us to be perfect in the
[31:59] flesh
[32:00] but he wants us to become Godly amen
[32:04] with his values his attitudes his
[32:07] characteristics
[32:09] God's goal in our life
[32:12] on this Earth
[32:14] it's not the con is to conform his
[32:16] character development in US
[32:18] he wants us to grow up spiritually and
[32:22] become like Christ becoming like Christ
[32:24] doesn't mean losing your personality or
[32:28] becoming a Mindless clone
[32:31] laughs
[32:33] some you know what
[32:35] you say well you know some people when
[32:37] they get religious
[32:39] when they get under law in this hour
[32:43] and they get legalistic
[32:45] they lose their personality
[32:49] they lose they lose their mind
[32:52] listen it's okay to lose your mind if
[32:55] you get Christ's mind
[32:57] you got to make sure you get Christ's
[32:59] mind
[33:00] but if you lose your mind and you just
[33:02] lost your mind and you're gone crazy
[33:05] religiously crazy that's not good
[33:09] in this hour
[33:11] God doesn't want us to lose our
[33:12] personalities
[33:17] I don't want to lose my voice
[33:21] Hallelujah was doing good there but
[33:23] amen
[33:25] but he wants to change our character
[33:29] not our personality
[33:31] because it's in the character right is
[33:35] where the flaws are
[33:37] it's in the character that controls the
[33:40] whole person
[33:42] so by changing that character that
[33:45] character then amen shines through that
[33:49] personality
[33:50] and that's what God is doing in this
[33:52] hour
[33:53] Hallelujah
[33:58] every time you forget that character is
[34:00] one of God's purposes for your life you
[34:03] will never become frustrated by your
[34:06] circumstances
[34:08] you wonder why is this happening to me
[34:10] why is why am I having such a difficult
[34:13] time
[34:15] one answer is that life is supposed to
[34:17] be difficult
[34:19] is what enables us to grow remember
[34:22] Earth is not heaven
[34:25] so when we think you know and we get
[34:30] frustrated by the circumstances in our
[34:32] lives
[34:34] and by the situations
[34:36] we're we're losing sight that God is
[34:39] working on our character
[34:42] amen
[34:43] God is developing our character he's
[34:45] doing a work within us
[34:48] as the Bible says Rejoice through your
[34:50] trials and your troubles and your
[34:52] situations amen all things are working
[34:56] for our good to a Believer they're
[34:59] walking in that kind of Faith they're
[35:02] walking in that kind of understanding
[35:04] they know whatever happens to them has
[35:08] to be permitted by God to develop inside
[35:11] of them a character to rule and to reign
[35:15] in this hour
[35:18] no more questioning why is this
[35:19] happening to me
[35:21] why did I go through that we did that at
[35:24] the beginning when we're babies
[35:27] when we didn't have the understanding
[35:29] but this is the hour
[35:30] that are understanding
[35:33] amen is higher than that
[35:36] many Christians misinterpret Jesus
[35:39] promises
[35:41] of the Abundant Life
[35:43] and John 10 10.
[35:45] to mean perfect health
[35:47] a comfortable lifestyle
[35:49] constant happiness
[35:52] full realization of your dreams
[35:54] didn't relief from your problems through
[35:57] prayer and faith
[35:59] oh my how many times we pray that I know
[36:03] I have in the past
[36:05] as soon as we pray and there's a problem
[36:07] there's a situation as soon as we pray
[36:10] we want instant relief and we even speak
[36:13] it sometimes let it happen now let it be
[36:17] done now
[36:23] and it might happen I'm not saying it's
[36:25] not going to happen
[36:26] I'm not interpreting nothing
[36:29] I'm just telling you God is The
[36:31] Interpreter right let us I'm trying to
[36:35] show you a character here as we go along
[36:37] here little by little makes God give us
[36:40] something here tonight show us a little
[36:42] bit in the character that he wants to be
[36:44] developing us maybe you start seeing
[36:46] that developing in you he's already
[36:48] doing that within you Hallelujah
[36:51] amen
[36:53] in a word they expect Christian life is
[36:56] to be easy
[36:57] they expect heaven on Earth
[37:00] here we say in right here we just said
[37:04] remember Earth is not heaven but
[37:06] Christians expect heaven to be on earth
[37:13] think about it eh Hallelujah
[37:16] oh my
[37:18] God what what God puts up with us as
[37:21] he's grown along that's why there's
[37:23] nobody like him
[37:24] no one like my Lord Jesus
[37:27] oh God by the grace of God hallelujah
[37:31] I'm just so privileged and I just
[37:33] thinking about that today how honored
[37:35] and privileged I am just to stand up
[37:36] here to be in this position it's just a
[37:39] just just it's just a miracle I thank
[37:42] the Lord that's all I got is just just
[37:44] Thanksgiving for the Lord eh you know
[37:47] just think we just preach one message
[37:49] just one anointed message from God
[37:53] just like that Lily in the valley comes
[37:56] up and lets up perfume out once and a
[37:58] bypasser comes by and smells it and it
[38:01] fulfills God's purpose
[38:03] just to be elected Amen to do something
[38:07] not only do something but hear the truth
[38:10] of the hour hear the word of God it's
[38:14] always been like that down Through the
[38:16] Ages my brothers and sisters when Jesus
[38:18] came he was nothing he was a carpenter's
[38:21] son he was brought up in Nazareth
[38:24] all kinds of names connected to him
[38:26] isn't he isn't he's so-and-so's brother
[38:29] or cousin or whatever look at the way
[38:31] they thought of him but he was God in
[38:34] flesh the prophet came Amen in this hour
[38:39] never been a prophet like this Prophet
[38:42] to the whole world all the churches amen
[38:46] and look at the way they treated him
[38:48] it's always the same way a prophet is
[38:51] not welcome in his homeland
[38:55] Hallelujah
[38:57] and they look at us amen
[39:00] it's not it's not it's you know what
[39:02] it's not what I think or what you think
[39:05] of yourself is what God says about you
[39:09] it's the anointing around your life that
[39:12] he's placed around your life
[39:13] and what he's doing in your life what
[39:15] he's confirming
[39:18] Hallelujah
[39:20] if it was up to me my brothers and
[39:22] sisters
[39:23] no way
[39:25] I would have been gone a long time ago
[39:27] but it's him
[39:29] it's always been him
[39:31] and now I recognizing that and when you
[39:33] recognize that in your character you
[39:36] just let go and let God have his way
[39:39] I don't understand tomorrow
[39:42] I don't understand how I'm going to do
[39:44] this or how I'm going to do that I don't
[39:47] need to
[39:48] I don't need to that's what was Moses's
[39:51] problem
[39:51] amen
[39:53] every time he came up against a
[39:55] challenge he had to go back crying to
[39:57] the Lord Lord I did this but Pharaoh did
[40:00] this I did this but Pharaoh did this in
[40:03] his musicians
[40:04] until it came to the time amen where God
[40:07] says now do you believe
[40:10] now do you believe it doesn't matter
[40:13] what Satan puts in front of you how he
[40:16] challenges you how he tested you you got
[40:18] to know that God Is Bigger and greater
[40:22] I know you're going to come out of it
[40:24] oh my
[40:29] Hallelujah
[40:31] now character for the third poll
[40:40] the church age here
[40:42] power with with character is fifth to
[40:45] rule
[40:46] suffering is part of this character
[40:49] building
[40:51] is part of controlling the power by
[40:53] faith in us
[40:55] Jesus learned obedience for the things
[40:58] he suffered
[40:59] moreover God builds character
[41:03] in the circumstances of our life
[41:05] he does he does this as we experience
[41:09] situations in which we are tempted
[41:12] to do the exact opposite of what
[41:16] character looks like
[41:18] character development always involves
[41:21] choice
[41:23] when we make the right choice
[41:25] our character grows and we become more
[41:30] like Christ
[41:31] in the suffering there are choices
[41:35] in the trial in the temptation
[41:39] in the bondage
[41:42] there's choices that we have to make
[41:46] Hallelujah
[41:51] God for God knows the plans that he has
[41:54] for you
[41:56] plans to prosper you not to harm you
[41:59] plans to give you hope and a future
[42:02] Jeremiah 29.
[42:04] 11. now remember before if you go back
[42:07] and read that a lot of people use that
[42:10] that scripture
[42:12] for just prosperity
[42:14] and you know God you know lifted people
[42:17] up but remember what God under the
[42:20] context that God is saying this
[42:22] scripture is because if you read before
[42:25] that Israel was rebelling against God's
[42:28] Commandments
[42:30] his voice
[42:32] and God allowed them to go into slavery
[42:35] into bondage
[42:39] that wasn't God's plan
[42:41] that wasn't God's purpose right for is
[42:45] perfect will for them but because of
[42:47] their Disobedience and their Rebellion
[42:49] God is saying here I know all the plans
[42:52] that I have for you
[42:54] I want to bless you and prosper you
[42:57] spiritually
[42:58] even in your trials and your troubles I
[43:01] want to bless you
[43:03] there's a blessing there a spiritual
[43:06] awakening a spiritual growth in it
[43:10] but it's our rebellion and our
[43:13] Disobedience sometimes that puts us in
[43:16] the devil or the flesh bondage and
[43:18] slavery
[43:19] but God comes back and says I know what
[43:22] plans I have for you those are not my
[43:25] plans for you
[43:26] those are the plans that you're creating
[43:28] for yourself by your choices and your
[43:31] decisions not to obey me and follow me
[43:36] Hallelujah
[43:39] amen
[43:47] yes you know my brothers and sisters
[43:50] preachers taken
[43:51] this this uh message
[43:54] taking quotes and taking Revelations
[43:57] from The Prophet's message putting a
[43:59] looking like a very nice spiritual
[44:01] message together
[44:03] tickle the ears of those in the message
[44:05] that are looking to be entertained
[44:08] by a religious spirit
[44:11] Hallelujah
[44:12] like Timothy said in the Bible he says
[44:15] denying the very power to live this life
[44:17] they didn't they they oh they they're
[44:20] here but they deny the power my brothers
[44:22] and sister it's not about putting this
[44:25] and putting that and making it look so
[44:27] pretty and so well put together amen
[44:30] Paul says I Don't Preach though not I
[44:33] preach the gospel not only in word but I
[44:36] preach it in spirit and in demonstration
[44:38] and in power of the Holy Ghost
[44:42] because that's the only thing that's
[44:44] going to set us free
[44:47] we don't want to be a polished up church
[44:49] we want to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:52] we want to be a living Epistles run of
[44:55] old man we want to be Overcomers
[44:59] we want that same life that was in
[45:01] Christ that same power that overcame in
[45:04] Christ and overcame in the profit in Us
[45:07] in this hour
[45:09] Hallelujah
[45:12] amen
[45:16] it is the same with God's word unless we
[45:19] tap into the power in the power in the
[45:22] proper way of this tremendous power we
[45:27] do us no good or produce nothing in our
[45:31] lives this is the connection between
[45:33] knowledge and Power
[45:35] if we know the word then we experience
[45:39] this power when we experience this power
[45:42] we we experience God's power tapping
[45:46] into God's word
[45:49] therefore requires things that every
[45:53] things that we can do when we read the
[45:56] word of God
[45:58] you see unless you had the written word
[46:02] you cannot get to the unwritten word to
[46:05] tap into God's power what did Brother
[46:07] Bradham say he said simple
[46:11] read your Bible and pray every day
[46:15] we need to tap into the word of God the
[46:18] Bible also says for a lack of knowledge
[46:21] of what the word my people perish
[46:25] so we need to be in the word not just
[46:28] come on Wednesday night or come on
[46:31] Sunday morning and get a little fill get
[46:34] a little trickle in us but we need to
[46:38] feed on this word every day
[46:45] where you have to overcome this age the
[46:48] busyness of this age the circumstances
[46:51] around your life that this age produces
[46:54] that is where you personally need to
[46:57] overcome and get into this word
[47:01] maybe stop making yourself so busy
[47:05] so occupied
[47:07] get down in prayer and fasten and seeing
[47:10] how what the Lord will reveal to you and
[47:13] make known to you how you can separate
[47:15] your life more
[47:17] for the work of God
[47:19] each one of us is called to a different
[47:21] level
[47:22] read the word the base connection that
[47:26] begins the power flows is made by
[47:29] reading the word once you feel God's
[47:31] power through the word surgeon through
[47:33] your life by reading it and by it being
[47:36] revealed to you
[47:37] then it will come naturally every day
[47:40] once you start breaking into that word
[47:43] and that word starts speaking to you
[47:45] listen
[47:47] once I get a taste of a good dessert
[47:50] you better keep that thing away from me
[47:53] especially if it's chocolate
[47:58] I'm not going to go and I'm going to go
[48:00] and I'm going to seek out I'm going to
[48:02] find it
[48:03] Hallelujah my body ain't gonna like it
[48:06] but I'm gonna want it sometimes I hear
[48:08] somebody's making a certain thing I
[48:10] don't care how I feel I'm going
[48:13] that is with the word of God
[48:16] once that word starts becoming real and
[48:19] life to you and starts speaking to you
[48:21] amen but it takes a Desperate Heart
[48:24] sometimes it takes desperation and
[48:26] perseverance sometimes it takes you to
[48:29] press through sometimes
[48:31] your flesh
[48:34] the unbelief that's in your life the
[48:38] doubts that go through your mind
[48:41] oh my what a battle we're going through
[48:43] Hallelujah but we got a mighty God we
[48:46] got a mighty word amen
[48:49] Hallelujah responds to the word in
[48:52] obedience
[48:53] there's danger in thinking that if we
[48:55] read the Bible we have done God's will
[48:58] we read the Bible in order to know God's
[49:02] will
[49:03] but the next step is obedience
[49:06] however is what transforms knowledge
[49:10] into power and power is what creates
[49:14] change in us a powerful living is
[49:17] produced by a powerful obeying they all
[49:21] go hand in hand together
[49:24] we can't leave anything out
[49:28] in our walk
[49:30] in our experience
[49:32] with this word
[49:35] so obedience read the word
[49:38] obey the word
[49:40] the power comes from the word that's the
[49:43] thing that creates change
[49:45] Hallelujah
[49:47] an Awakening seed learns obedience
[49:50] Jesus learned obedience by the things he
[49:53] suffered his experience and and testing
[49:57] and trying he went through brother
[49:59] Brandon went through many experiences
[50:01] where he had to learn obedience to
[50:03] listen to God first
[50:06] not his family not the preachers he was
[50:10] tested by losing his father his brother
[50:13] his wife his daughter
[50:15] when brother Brandon went to Africa
[50:18] God told him to stay and preach in a
[50:20] certain place but he didn't he listened
[50:23] to the preachers he got sick and he
[50:24] almost died
[50:25] yes
[50:27] yes you hear what I'm saying yes
[50:32] and he almost died until God delivered
[50:34] him and he said every time he goes God
[50:37] makes it hard on him because of that
[50:40] time he didn't listen to God
[50:42] it's just God keeping his son
[50:45] under obedience
[50:47] amen
[50:49] reminding him every single time Amen to
[50:53] obey listen to me when I'm when I'm
[50:56] speaking to you
[50:57] obey my voice
[51:00] because I know what's best for you
[51:02] doesn't God know what's best for us
[51:05] he knows our life he knows our tomorrow
[51:09] he knows everything
[51:11] the trust and and leave everything in
[51:13] his hands and let him control everything
[51:16] in our lives
[51:18] Hallelujah
[51:20] amen
[51:22] to be sold out vessels
[51:24] Hallelujah
[51:28] surrender to the headship of the word
[51:30] is a vessel under subjection then all
[51:33] things are possible
[51:35] to them that are sold out Hebrews
[51:38] chapter 12 God says chastening you we
[51:42] are not fit to rule until we've been
[51:44] tested the third pull the revealing of
[51:47] the word knocks out all the wrong
[51:50] understanding that came from our past
[51:53] life or our education our denominational
[51:56] thinking our knowledge or religion
[52:00] just like he did with Moses he took in
[52:03] 40 years to knock out all of Egypt out
[52:06] of him
[52:08] and it takes time to be holy it takes
[52:11] God time
[52:13] to deal with us
[52:15] not because of him but because of us
[52:19] because God knows what we can handle and
[52:22] he doesn't give us anything more than
[52:24] what we can handle
[52:26] amen
[52:28] glory to God
[52:31] God this was not like Pastor Simon
[52:34] always says it's not a it's we're not
[52:35] going to break it's a Bend it's a
[52:38] turning of a corner in our lives
[52:40] what we're going through
[52:42] the changes that take place
[52:45] Hallelujah the trusting God and
[52:48] everything that comes your way
[52:51] that come to a place of faith and
[52:54] realize and recognize and be alert be
[52:57] sober that everything that happens
[52:59] around your life is coming into your
[53:02] life for a purpose and reason
[53:04] you talk about being positive
[53:07] you talk about being certain and
[53:10] confident
[53:11] nothing brings that like this like the
[53:13] word of God does in our lives
[53:15] when God tells us who we are and what
[53:18] we're raised up for and that nothing can
[53:20] harm us no power in hell can come
[53:22] against us that Gates of Hell will not
[53:24] Prevail against us
[53:27] but we need to walk a certain way we
[53:30] need to walk in the path that he's given
[53:33] each and every one of us we need to go
[53:36] in that path my brothers and sisters we
[53:38] can't go to the left or the right that's
[53:40] why the prophet seeing the vision of the
[53:43] Bride getting out of line
[53:46] and he screamed get back in line
[53:49] that's us that's me that's you in our
[53:52] walks in our lives sometimes the spirit
[53:54] of God speaks to us get back in line get
[53:57] back focus on this word
[54:00] on the life your purpose of your calling
[54:03] and your position
[54:05] Hallelujah
[54:08] amen
[54:10] the bride gets to see the prophets
[54:12] failures and mistakes
[54:14] and how was how he learned and grown
[54:18] Moses his mistakes his temper
[54:22] as we look in the Bible we look at the
[54:25] children of Israel brothers sisters we
[54:28] are standing here today and we get to
[54:30] look back and see all that
[54:33] amen
[54:34] we have everything in this hour
[54:38] we are the last ones the Baton is handed
[54:41] to us
[54:42] I believe with all my heart
[54:45] am I am I saying God told me the time no
[54:49] but I believe by what I see by faith
[54:52] what I see the prophecies being
[54:54] fulfilled I what I see what God is doing
[54:57] in my life and what he's doing in The
[54:58] Bride of Jesus Christ's life and how the
[55:01] word of God has come into a place my
[55:03] brothers and sisters I see in the spirit
[55:06] that God is trying to take his church
[55:09] his bride to another level of faith
[55:13] another level of Deliverance
[55:15] another level of where we're coming
[55:17] another level of surrender
[55:20] Our Lives to him I see it in the spirit
[55:23] being released to the people
[55:26] you just open up your heart and believe
[55:29] God
[55:30] that's how he comes in amen and he does
[55:35] the work he does the change and he does
[55:37] the creating
[55:39] but Mary said beat unto me according to
[55:41] Thy word that I'm here in this hour the
[55:44] word that you're hearing beat unto me
[55:47] according to Thy Word
[55:48] when God is speaking and want to make
[55:50] himself more real to you want to deliver
[55:52] you he's he's speaking out of his word
[55:55] trying to bring Faith to you
[55:58] you have to believe it you have to say
[56:00] Let It Be unto me in my situation I
[56:03] believe it Lord
[56:04] and I'm walking by faith
[56:08] walk by faith
[56:10] not by sight
[56:13] get rid of sight
[56:15] and walk by faith
[56:16] and then when you walk by faith
[56:19] amen you're walking with him
[56:21] Hallelujah
[56:23] oh my
[56:26] God Amen
[56:30] we learn and we see the prophet
[56:33] the battles
[56:35] even the prophet said
[56:38] my brothers and sisters obey
[56:41] surrender
[56:42] let go and let God
[56:44] that you may have less Battle Scars
[56:47] you talk about Battle Scars sometimes we
[56:49] battle scar ourselves
[56:52] you know that's a great movement out
[56:54] there the spirit of the devil battle
[56:56] scarring people in their flesh cutting
[56:58] themselves and all that stuff
[57:00] my brothers and sisters let's not give
[57:02] ourselves any more battle scars than
[57:06] what we should
[57:08] by not listening to the voice of God
[57:12] the prophet said right here
[57:15] we need to be aware alert and conscious
[57:18] of how God is maturing us through
[57:20] suffering through testing through trials
[57:22] through molding through shaping you say
[57:25] brother Tim yes that's good I know that
[57:28] but when you're going through it are you
[57:31] conscious of it do you recognize it
[57:34] because there's a different attitude
[57:36] there's a different response the way you
[57:39] speak the way you act or sometimes the
[57:42] way you don't speak
[57:43] sometimes going through these testing
[57:45] and trying times you need to be still
[57:48] and know that he is God inside of you
[57:51] working inside of you and don't say a
[57:54] word
[57:57] because at the moment you might not
[57:58] understand and that's where the devil
[58:00] plays on your mind
[58:01] and and go by your feelings
[58:05] and let your feelings and your emotions
[58:07] and your memory and all these things
[58:10] start getting to you
[58:12] and then you start speaking
[58:15] you see he can't impersonate this word
[58:17] because he knows nothing about it
[58:21] he don't understand it
[58:23] he only understands where you are at
[58:26] when you speak
[58:28] don't show him anything don't tell him
[58:31] anything
[58:33] do you understand what I'm saying
[58:36] when you're going through the testing in
[58:38] the trials be still
[58:41] that I have only seen one thing and that
[58:44] is your faith your belief and your trust
[58:46] in God
[58:48] my God is more than able
[58:53] to take me through
[58:56] this Red Sea my God is more than able to
[59:00] depart it open
[59:02] this sickness my God is more than able
[59:05] to heal it
[59:10] oh my
[59:18] I don't know I got this uh when I was
[59:20] putting this together
[59:22] I got these two uh things mixed up here
[59:25] but I don't know why I put them together
[59:27] like that and I just hopping on the
[59:29] computer I guess I got here hold in
[59:31] anger
[59:32] is drinking poison
[59:34] expecting the other person to die
[59:39] okay
[59:41] hold in Anger within us
[59:44] resentment
[59:48] is drinking poison and expecting the
[59:49] other person to die
[59:51] we don't want to drink Satan's poison
[59:54] we don't want to drink his lies
[59:56] his deception that's all he's a father
[59:58] of Lies everything he speaks to you is a
[1:00:01] lie
[1:00:05] if we understand that
[1:00:07] we don't listen to Liars you know if you
[1:00:10] knew somebody in the flesh
[1:00:12] that are compulsive liars
[1:00:15] you wouldn't believe a word they say
[1:00:18] but here's Satan
[1:00:20] he can't impersonate it he knows nothing
[1:00:23] about it he don't understand it but when
[1:00:26] he speaks to us he speaks lies and we
[1:00:28] believe him
[1:00:38] first Peter 5 10 after you suffered
[1:00:42] Exodus 23 19. I will not drive them out
[1:00:46] in one day but little by little this is
[1:00:49] how I deliver the Deliverance comes
[1:00:52] why speak to the storm when you can't
[1:00:54] keep your mind and your spirit in order
[1:00:58] think about it my brothers and sisters
[1:01:00] let's put things in order here God has
[1:01:02] an order amen and and building character
[1:01:05] we try to speak we pray speak to the
[1:01:08] story speak to this speak that we try to
[1:01:10] take the beam out of our own brother our
[1:01:12] own sister's eyes when we got one in our
[1:01:14] own eye
[1:01:15] and we can't bring our flesh under
[1:01:17] subjection to the word
[1:01:20] we can't keep our mouths shut sometimes
[1:01:22] from speaking unbelief and doubt and
[1:01:25] lies
[1:01:26] and we try to speak all this other stuff
[1:01:30] we have to get rid of that stuff
[1:01:35] God knows what he's saying
[1:01:39] when it comes to reality your mind opens
[1:01:42] it up brother I'm saying here your mind
[1:01:44] either accepts it or rejects it
[1:01:48] that's it friends
[1:01:49] God let none of them miss it
[1:01:52] you see it's your mind that opens up the
[1:01:56] door or closes the door and listens to
[1:01:59] your conscience
[1:02:00] or listens to your memory or listens to
[1:02:03] your affection but when your mind closes
[1:02:06] itself to these things and let God's
[1:02:09] spirit of his word come in it blows the
[1:02:13] rest of this stuff out
[1:02:15] every Delta is gone every fear is gone
[1:02:18] every sensation of Doubt is gone every
[1:02:21] feeling is gone there's nothing standing
[1:02:24] there but the word of God and Satan
[1:02:28] cannot battle against that
[1:02:31] no sir
[1:02:34] that's what it's all about my brothers
[1:02:35] and sisters

[1:04:21] going somewhere something is happening
[1:04:24] tonight within us by the spirit of God
[1:04:27] something is developing in US revealing
[1:04:30] to us tonight by the spirit of God
[1:04:32] Sunday Morning by the spirit of God
[1:04:36] we're on a journey
[1:04:38] we're overcoming we're all Overcomers to

[1:04:43] to set with me on my throne
[1:04:46] that's where we're going tonight to sit
[1:04:49] with him on his throne
[1:04:51] Hallelujah
[1:04:54] Glory
[1:04:57] thank you Lord
[1:05:01] the Bible says it takes time for the
[1:05:03] bride to come into that perfect Faith
[1:05:05] perfect character to Manifest this third
[1:05:08] pull
[1:05:09] it's going to take a lot of time to deal
[1:05:11] with the Flesh and weaknesses
[1:05:13] and her own thinking and her own
[1:05:15] interpretation so that God can trust her
[1:05:17] with the spoken word
[1:05:19] because without it
[1:05:21] she would be prideful
[1:05:23] selfish arrogant ignorant
[1:05:27] of that spoken word
[1:05:29] hello I can I look at these scriptures
[1:05:32] and say oh God
[1:05:34] 32 years I've been walking
[1:05:37] and I can see that
[1:05:39] God has taken me through a lot of this
[1:05:42] stuff and I I see myself growing am I
[1:05:44] there no I'm I'm here tonight because
[1:05:46] I'm going there
[1:05:48] Hallelujah I'm going there it's
[1:05:51] developing in me but I see a process
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:54] that's that's that's the that's the
[1:05:57] thing that brother Brown said when the
[1:05:58] bride recognizes who she is when she
[1:06:00] recognizes the process that's taken
[1:06:02] place in her that she can look back and
[1:06:04] say my I that was me I used to think
[1:06:07] that way that was my understanding but
[1:06:09] here I am God you took me onto a higher
[1:06:12] level God you're raising me up higher
[1:06:17] that's what's taking place
[1:06:20] overcoming casting out unbelief Casino
[1:06:23] Devil's Castle of unbelief
[1:06:27] God cast out unbelief from our lives
[1:06:30] Hallelujah
[1:06:32] glory to God
[1:06:34] amen for I reckon that the suffering of
[1:06:37] this present time is not worthy to be
[1:06:39] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:06:42] revealed in US amen
[1:06:43] now we look at that that's going to be
[1:06:46] there
[1:06:47] hey man we're going to be known as he is
[1:06:49] knowing there but that scripture right
[1:06:52] there the suffering that we're going
[1:06:54] through is not going to compare to the
[1:06:57] Revelation he's going to bring out of
[1:06:59] our Lives the character the victory amen
[1:07:02] the spirit of God that's going to
[1:07:04] manifest out of our lives
[1:07:07] you see when you're born again
[1:07:10] you don't need more of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:12] don't listen to that
[1:07:13] when you're born again you've got the
[1:07:15] Holy Ghost
[1:07:16] the thing is the Holy Ghost wants more
[1:07:18] of you
[1:07:21] think about that
[1:07:23] think about that
[1:07:26] we got this illusion in our minds from
[1:07:28] denominational thinking amen from from
[1:07:31] from from from uh lack of uh uh
[1:07:34] Revelation back there that was brought
[1:07:36] up down through the church ages now God
[1:07:39] fill me for the Holy Ghost I need more
[1:07:41] of the Holy Ghost I thought that way no
[1:07:43] I got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:07:46] Wants More of Me
[1:07:48] then you're going to see that you are
[1:07:50] filled with the Holy Ghost when the Holy
[1:07:52] Ghost gets more of you he has more to
[1:07:54] manifest through you
[1:07:56] oh God filled me more filled me more no
[1:07:58] you just got out of the way you just
[1:08:00] died out to yourself you just got
[1:08:02] victory in an area so the Holy Ghost can
[1:08:04] manifest himself more in your life
[1:08:07] Hallelujah
[1:08:09] because that's a that's a lie of the
[1:08:11] devil
[1:08:12] especially to the young people when
[1:08:14] they're born again
[1:08:16] how many times you see them why do you
[1:08:18] think there's altars why do you think
[1:08:20] there's altars and people come to the
[1:08:22] Altar for that one reason I guarantee
[1:08:25] you most of the time God fill me full of
[1:08:28] the Holy Ghost give me more than the
[1:08:29] Holy Ghost
[1:08:30] I did that once at a cap meeting when I
[1:08:33] first came in
[1:08:35] and I'm talking about supernatural
[1:08:37] experiences in my life
[1:08:40] and I I came to the altar I knelt down
[1:08:43] and outside I was praying
[1:08:44] God fill me full of Holy Ghost give me
[1:08:46] the Holy Ghost I felt the shoulder a top
[1:08:49] of my shoulder I said brother you got
[1:08:51] the Holy Ghost get back to your seat
[1:08:57] you don't need more of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:59] never understood it I said oh okay
[1:09:01] all right thank you Lord you heard my
[1:09:03] prayer but that's not what it was that
[1:09:06] was my understanding amen
[1:09:09] Hallelujah
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:13] Hallelujah
[1:09:15] glory to God
[1:09:19] character is a victory
[1:09:22] it's not a gift
[1:09:25] like we talked about gifts there's gifts
[1:09:27] in the body
[1:09:29] but gifts are not it
[1:09:32] amen character is a victory
[1:09:36] just because you got a gift it don't
[1:09:39] mean you got character
[1:09:41] because there's a lot of gifts out there
[1:09:43] without any character
[1:09:45] and they're satanic and they're be used
[1:09:48] of the devil false teaching false lion
[1:09:50] Trinity devils
[1:09:53] but character is a victory
[1:09:56] characters when you overcome and you go
[1:09:59] through the testing and you go through
[1:10:01] the Garden of Gethsemane and just like
[1:10:03] the wine has to be pressed amen that's
[1:10:07] what Guardian Gethsemane means you get
[1:10:09] pressed and pressed and the goal gets
[1:10:12] beaten and beaten until it shines
[1:10:15] then the victory comes then the
[1:10:18] character comes
[1:10:19] oh my let's not lose sight of that this
[1:10:23] is more precious than gold my brothers
[1:10:25] and sisters when a church is not being
[1:10:28] tested and tried and under persecution a
[1:10:31] church is dying but when they're under
[1:10:34] that they're growing they're striving
[1:10:37] amen they're over Covenant in the spirit
[1:10:40] of God
[1:10:42] don't worry about what comes our way my
[1:10:45] brothers and sisters get on your knees
[1:10:47] and pray and speak that word and thank
[1:10:49] God for the victory
[1:10:51] amen thank God for the victory
[1:10:55] you're blessed in the church Lord you're
[1:10:57] bringing in such should be saved Lord
[1:11:00] glory to God you're adding to the church
[1:11:02] daily Lord
[1:11:04] glory to God Satan can't stop it
[1:11:09] Glory
[1:11:12] a man without character can't Reign
[1:11:15] because power apart from character
[1:11:17] satanic but Power with characters fit
[1:11:20] the rule
[1:11:21] and since he wants us to share
[1:11:25] in his throne on the same basis that he
[1:11:28] overcame sat down on his father's Throne
[1:11:31] then we have to overcome and sit down
[1:11:34] with him on his throne
[1:11:35] this little temporary suffering we go
[1:11:37] through now is not worthy to compare to
[1:11:40] the tremendous Glory that will be
[1:11:42] revealed in US
[1:11:44] Oh Glory
[1:11:46] Hallelujah
[1:11:48] amen thinking not strange concerning the
[1:11:51] fiery trials
[1:11:52] that come to try you that is what Peter
[1:11:55] said it's not strange that God wants us
[1:11:57] to develop a christ-like character that
[1:12:00] that comes through suffering
[1:12:02] Hallelujah Hebrews 12 6 8 for whom the
[1:12:06] Lord loveth he chasten he scourgeth
[1:12:09] every son to whom he receiveth but if
[1:12:12] you be without chastisement therefore
[1:12:15] all you are partakers then you are
[1:12:17] bastards not Sons
[1:12:19] so praise God
[1:12:22] Hallelujah
[1:12:25] Hallelujah
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:29] Hallelujah Brother Brad I'm speaking
[1:12:30] here I'm going to try to wind this down
[1:12:37] in uh Christ is the mystery of God
[1:12:39] revealed
[1:12:41] by having the revelation of this secret
[1:12:43] made known unto them by his grace it
[1:12:46] means the church that he is trying to
[1:12:50] get into
[1:12:52] okay
[1:12:55] question and answers 1964. then he said
[1:12:59] that which is in part will be done away
[1:13:01] with
[1:13:03] when that which is perfect has come
[1:13:06] or when that which is perfect is made
[1:13:09] knowing
[1:13:12] okay
[1:13:15] the greatest anointing that was ever
[1:13:19] to anybody was was on Jesus Christ
[1:13:23] the anointing is not emotions the
[1:13:25] anointing is supreme power in control of
[1:13:29] known exactly what and how and that is
[1:13:33] what is here now
[1:13:36] we always say it the Rapture is here now
[1:13:39] perfect faith is here now
[1:13:42] that's what is here now exactly knowing
[1:13:48] the inner Veil
[1:13:52] it has always been that third pull three
[1:13:56] is perfection the ministry comes to its
[1:13:59] Perfection when it reproduces Christ
[1:14:01] again in the natural amongst human
[1:14:04] beings
[1:14:06] Souls that are in prison now
[1:14:09] the third pull is beginning to move you
[1:14:12] see
[1:14:13] it is within me now
[1:14:19] it's here
[1:14:21] now
[1:14:23] tapping into the power of the word the
[1:14:26] reveal word the third pull is here now
[1:14:29] Hallelujah
[1:14:33] character under the power of the third
[1:14:36] pull
[1:14:38] now will overcome
[1:14:40] it's not going to come my brothers and
[1:14:42] sisters it's here now
[1:14:45] everything you have need of is here now
[1:14:48] God has given it to us the seals are
[1:14:51] open
[1:14:52] that Mysteries are revealed
[1:14:55] you are revealed you are those you're
[1:14:58] part of those seals
[1:15:00] Hallelujah
[1:15:01] you know it's all about understanding
[1:15:05] it's all about recognizing it's all
[1:15:08] about an Awakening in this hour it's all
[1:15:11] about perfect Faith coming in this hour
[1:15:14] that's why you're hearing these messages
[1:15:15] the series of brother Danny is preaching
[1:15:18] on perfect faith my series Great
[1:15:20] Awakening the mystery all these things
[1:15:23] that are taking place is happening right
[1:15:26] now and it's what the bride is of need
[1:15:29] of
[1:15:35] you know just like the you know the
[1:15:36] brother Brian said when you get there
[1:15:38] you're going to look at that devil and
[1:15:40] you're gonna go that was the guy that
[1:15:42] caused all this problems that that guy
[1:15:46] caused all that problems
[1:15:57] what am I trying to say
[1:16:00] if you look at somebody naturally in the
[1:16:03] world and somebody you know this guy
[1:16:06] here
[1:16:07] doesn't bug me he doesn't threaten me he
[1:16:10] doesn't intimidate me he's nothing
[1:16:12] I'm so far above him you know how we
[1:16:14] think naturally right and out in the
[1:16:15] world we think that we don't even bother
[1:16:17] with certain people
[1:16:18] because of their attitude or whatever
[1:16:20] but we bother so much and we listen to
[1:16:22] the devil so much
[1:16:24] and why why
[1:16:26] because we don't know the word enough
[1:16:29] to know whose voice is speaking to you
[1:16:33] just like Martin Luther when he was
[1:16:35] lying there in bed and the devil came
[1:16:36] right to in his bed with the crown on
[1:16:38] his head and all that stuff says Martin
[1:16:40] Luther worshiped me worship me I'm the
[1:16:42] Lord Jesus worship me he looked he knew
[1:16:45] the word
[1:16:46] he knew that the Saints at the end would
[1:16:48] Crown the Lord Jesus Christ he looked he
[1:16:51] says Get Behind Me Satan he turned over
[1:16:53] and went to bed
[1:16:56] and another guy was preaching a a great
[1:16:58] Revival series under a 10 meeting back
[1:17:01] in the day I forget his name right now
[1:17:03] but the power of God was moving healing
[1:17:06] miracles signs and wonders
[1:17:09] night after night he was preaching
[1:17:11] day after day just went back into the
[1:17:14] room and he went to take a little nap
[1:17:16] and he felt the darkness come over the
[1:17:18] room he felt a dark presence come into
[1:17:21] the room
[1:17:22] and he turned over and he looked and he
[1:17:24] seen a back a black smoke starting to
[1:17:26] shape into a person like that and he
[1:17:28] looked over he goes oh it's you get out
[1:17:31] of here he went back to bed
[1:17:34] that's how much attention he paid to him
[1:17:37] that's somebody who recognizes God and
[1:17:40] experienced God Amen that knows God and
[1:17:43] the power of his resurrection
[1:17:46] Paul said I want to know him and the
[1:17:47] power is right you know God in the power
[1:17:49] of his resurrection
[1:17:51] then you'll know
[1:17:53] that the devil's no match for you
[1:17:55] Hallelujah
[1:17:57] let's try to wind this down here
[1:18:00] one of the last things that the bride
[1:18:01] will face
[1:18:03] to bring forth this third pull
[1:18:05] manifestation is rejection
[1:18:09] that is coming
[1:18:11] through the bride
[1:18:15] not in the denominations in the message
[1:18:19] right amongst you
[1:18:21] rejection
[1:18:24] the word when it's always made flesh
[1:18:27] and always comes into his manifestation
[1:18:31] when Jesus was the appointed time
[1:18:35] many times he said it's not my time but
[1:18:37] when it was his time to come into
[1:18:40] manifestation and fulfill his ministry
[1:18:43] Hallelujah
[1:18:45] where he came he said I my father are
[1:18:47] one of the same where he went and the
[1:18:49] temple said uh today this scripture is
[1:18:54] fulfilled
[1:18:56] that he was rejected
[1:18:59] oh my
[1:19:01] my brothers and sisters
[1:19:03] this bride is going to face rejection
[1:19:07] when Jesus proclaimed that he was one
[1:19:09] with the father making himself God he
[1:19:12] was rejected despised and forsaken this
[1:19:15] bride will have the character and the
[1:19:17] understanding of who she is to face that
[1:19:19] rejection in this hour
[1:19:22] God has given us everything in this hour
[1:19:26] oh my
[1:19:27] the bride carries a heart of an
[1:19:30] overcomer those who sail into deep
[1:19:33] Waters develop something very key to
[1:19:36] maintain an overcoming heart the
[1:19:39] scriptures speak that in the last days
[1:19:41] those who will remain and gain great
[1:19:44] blessings will be those who carry an
[1:19:47] overcoming heart
[1:19:49] we are Overcomers
[1:19:51] we are constantly overcoming
[1:19:54] we never stop overcoming
[1:19:57] every day you wake up and you put your
[1:20:00] feet on the ground you're an overcomer
[1:20:03] oh Hallelujah
[1:20:05] glory to God
[1:20:07] you take your first step you know faith
[1:20:09] is taken go walking outside your door
[1:20:11] going into your car going to do the
[1:20:13] things that you know you have to do it
[1:20:15] takes Faith to do that
[1:20:19] and when God speaks to you during the
[1:20:21] day
[1:20:23] in the midst of all your your your your
[1:20:25] natural life God has the preeminence and
[1:20:29] he comes and he moves you this way and
[1:20:31] he comes and he moves you that way
[1:20:33] how many times does this happen I know
[1:20:35] there's lots of you have testimonies
[1:20:37] amen I'm walking down and the next thing
[1:20:39] you know I stop and I'm ordering
[1:20:42] something at at the food place and I
[1:20:44] stop I look over and the Holy Spirit
[1:20:46] there's a guy over there in a corner
[1:20:47] like this and the Holy Spirit says
[1:20:50] go over to him
[1:20:52] you'll walk over to him
[1:20:55] and then you start speaking you start
[1:20:56] seeing the hand of God moving
[1:20:59] and things happen I'm not going to tell
[1:21:02] you what happened but things happen
[1:21:04] that's how God moves
[1:21:06] and manifestes himself
[1:21:09] in our midst
[1:21:11] Hallelujah
[1:21:13] an overcomer walks with a plan a and no
[1:21:16] plan B Attitude they have fully given
[1:21:19] themselves to God in his ways
[1:21:22] they have a mindset that says everything
[1:21:24] in me that is not of God needs to go
[1:21:29] well
[1:21:31] many make peace and justify their
[1:21:34] strongholds
[1:21:36] their flesh
[1:21:38] their weaknesses
[1:21:41] an overcomer never contends or makes a
[1:21:45] peace with the Enemy
[1:21:47] I preached the whole message on that one
[1:21:49] time making a treaty with the Devil
[1:21:52] you don't bug me I don't bug you
[1:21:54] let me tell you
[1:21:56] he's a liar
[1:21:58] don't forget that
[1:22:00] don't make no treaty with him
[1:22:02] he tells you to put down your sword and
[1:22:04] he won't bug you
[1:22:05] he's coming back on the other side
[1:22:08] to hit you
[1:22:10] never let down your sword
[1:22:13] never compromise with the word of God
[1:22:16] never compromise with this world this
[1:22:20] flesh
[1:22:22] that's why the Bible says the enemies of
[1:22:24] your own household Jesus said I'll
[1:22:26] separate you from your mother your
[1:22:28] father your mother-in-law your
[1:22:29] brother-in-law the Bible doesn't say
[1:22:31] that that's still the word of God
[1:22:34] watch out
[1:22:38] the spirit of compromise comes through
[1:22:40] that Avenue sometimes
[1:22:45] be alert be diligent
[1:22:47] your adversary to devils like a roaring
[1:22:49] lion
[1:22:50] seeking to devour you
[1:22:52] they are single-minded deep water people
[1:22:55] learn to become single-minded When
[1:22:57] Storms Come they cannot entertain the
[1:23:00] what ifs or would have beens or could
[1:23:03] have beens or should have been kind of
[1:23:04] thoughts
[1:23:06] no more of those things
[1:23:09] it's God's word and that's it
[1:23:11] it's either Faith or dealt
[1:23:13] Hallelujah
[1:23:20] let me read this quote here I got a
[1:23:22] couple quotes and then I'm going to
[1:23:23] close
[1:23:25] Allelujah I want to get this thought
[1:23:27] down
[1:23:29] Hallelujah this process here
[1:23:32] they don't know
[1:23:33] what the overcoming means and I begin to
[1:23:37] think of this text then overcome and
[1:23:39] keep life in you when life went out
[1:23:43] that's what brought that log to that
[1:23:45] condition see
[1:23:47] and it made it worse than ever when it
[1:23:51] laid in the branch where the water was
[1:23:54] and then there you take a Christian
[1:23:57] that's supposed to be a Christian
[1:23:59] let the life of God go out from him and
[1:24:02] experience the joy of serving Christ and
[1:24:06] living in a church where such is going
[1:24:08] on he rottens twice as quick
[1:24:13] living under that
[1:24:15] if we are trying to follow this message
[1:24:18] of this hour he says what brother I'm
[1:24:20] speaking here we're trying to follow
[1:24:22] this message of this hour we should live
[1:24:25] constantly in the Life of Christ see
[1:24:30] because it don't lay don't you lay
[1:24:33] around
[1:24:34] and know that these things that you're
[1:24:37] supposed to do and you don't do them
[1:24:41] what is he saying here
[1:24:43] God is speaking to your life
[1:24:46] God has given you instructions he's
[1:24:48] dealing with you he's revealing things
[1:24:51] to you
[1:24:52] he tells you to move like he always does
[1:24:55] Through the Bible in a Direction
[1:24:58] that's what he's saying here
[1:25:00] and you don't do that
[1:25:03] he that knoweth to do good and do it not
[1:25:06] to him is sin unbelief
[1:25:09] then when you become Dodie and rotten
[1:25:12] when you separated from the life of God
[1:25:15] so strive with all that is in you to
[1:25:19] stay in the life of God that is in you
[1:25:22] to be fruitful and bear in Fruit we see
[1:25:25] this age that we're living in it's one
[1:25:28] of the grandest ages of all ages the
[1:25:31] laosian church age the grandest of all
[1:25:34] Church ages because it's the ending of
[1:25:36] time and the blending of Eternity and
[1:25:39] then it's the greatest sinful age
[1:25:42] that's ever been
[1:25:45] sinful the greatest unbelief we can see
[1:25:48] that there's never been a there's never
[1:25:50] been an age like this
[1:25:52] look at brother bradham's day it's a
[1:25:54] joke
[1:25:56] I I believe the prophet's seen he's seen
[1:25:59] he seen it seed for him he's seen it
[1:26:01] with those people back there that were
[1:26:03] following his ministry and not have no
[1:26:05] clue of what's going on out here the
[1:26:08] ones that are gone on the age that we're
[1:26:09] living the unbelief that we're fighting
[1:26:11] now
[1:26:13] but how greater is the word
[1:26:16] he says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:26:19] flood I will raise a standard
[1:26:21] he says I'll make my word more real to
[1:26:23] you there's never been an age where God
[1:26:27] is making his word more real to his
[1:26:30] people than now
[1:26:32] he's going to make it so real that
[1:26:34] nothing else matters to her
[1:26:37] and it's going to Quicken her the
[1:26:39] quickening spirit in her is going to
[1:26:40] Quicken her so much
[1:26:42] it's gonna Quicken her out of here
[1:26:45] oh my
[1:26:48] whoa Hallelujah you ever get caught up
[1:26:51] in the word of God oh my you get caught

[1:27:08] God Amen I see that increase in more and
