[21:24] we will
[21:26] um today we want to come to the ending
[21:30] of the spoken word it's the Original
[21:34] Seed the series that is what we we were
[21:39] dealing with
[21:40] laughs
[21:42] and this will be the last uh lesson on
[21:47] that and which we will entitle this the
[21:53] last Harvest
[21:55] the last Harvest okay and for scripture
[22:00] let's read revelation 18.
[22:06] I'll be as brief as possible eighteen
[22:09] one and two
[22:11] verses 1 and 2 then we'll go to verses
[22:15] 9. and 10.
[22:19] shall we read
[22:21] and after these things
[22:24] I saw another Angel come down from
[22:29] heaven
[22:30] having great power and the Earth was
[22:35] lightened with his glory
[22:39] and he cried mightily with a strong
[22:42] voice
[22:43] saying Babylon has fallen the greatest
[22:47] Fallen
[22:48] it's fallen and has become the
[22:52] habitation of devils and the hold of
[22:56] every foul Spirit and the cage of every
[23:01] unclean and hateful bird
[23:05] verses 9 and 10.
[23:10] and the kings of the earth who had
[23:13] committed fornication and lived
[23:16] deliciously with her shall bewild her
[23:19] and lament for her when they shall see
[23:24] the smoke of her burning
[23:28] standing up far off for the fear of her
[23:32] torment saying alas alas that great City
[23:37] Babylon that Mighty City for in one hour
[23:43] is thy judgment come
[23:46] our gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[23:48] thee for this the reading of the word
[23:51] we pray that the great holy spirit will
[23:55] bless us together give us your insight
[23:59] into your word and divine understanding
[24:04] that we may know how to live and how to
[24:08] walk and what to know in this time in
[24:12] which we live we ask it in the name of
[24:15] Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you
[24:18] all please be seated we know that the
[24:22] age or the ages it's wrapping up very
[24:25] very swiftly
[24:28] and we are seeing the signs everywhere
[24:31] uh that things are coming are quickly to
[24:35] an end I'm talking about for the Gentile
[24:38] dispensation that is quickly coming to
[24:42] its end uh and the transition over to
[24:48] unfocus on Israel God's timepiece so
[24:53] let's keep our eyes now on Israel
[24:58] we now are waiting and watching uh for
[25:03] the rapture
[25:05] moment
[25:08] we are in the process where we are
[25:10] waiting for that last Spark
[25:13] before everything goes up
[25:16] but for tonight we want to talk about
[25:18] the last Harvest
[25:21] now uh we know that each Church age has
[25:25] its Harvest
[25:28] because the messenger for whatever
[25:30] Church age that it is
[25:34] uh calls out the elect for that age
[25:38] and there are there are best Harvest of
[25:42] that particular age
[25:45] but
[25:46] they have to wait for the rest of all
[25:50] the ages to come to their harvests
[25:55] and then we have this last Great Harvest
[26:01] where everything together is caught up
[26:06] in the presence of God that's why the
[26:09] Bible tells us they have to sleep they
[26:11] have to wait a day without us cannot be
[26:14] made perfect
[26:16] is that right uh they can't be made
[26:19] perfect that way so each Edge has its
[26:24] individual Harvest
[26:26] uh and we come to our age on our age has
[26:32] to have its individual Harvest
[26:37] and all those seven harvests the Rapture
[26:41] now will be the Gathering of all those
[26:45] seven harvests
[26:47] into one last Great Harvest that we can
[26:53] call it from the bride's point of view
[26:55] we call that the Rapture is that right
[26:58] because we are caught up out of this
[27:00] entire thing but that will be the this
[27:03] will be the Harvest of all the ages this
[27:07] is what and we are in the middle of what
[27:09] I'm talking about now
[27:12] all of what we're talking about is
[27:14] actually taking place
[27:16] it's happening around us okay now
[27:20] calling the prophet we know that we are
[27:25] now at the end time and I can say Amen
[27:31] he says the seeds are sowed they're
[27:35] already sowed amen praise God how were
[27:39] they sold they were sowed by the
[27:42] prophets Ministry they were sowed by his
[27:45] message
[27:47] and let out in the world I praise God
[27:51] the soul went forth to sow and he saw
[27:54] seeds the message has already gone
[27:56] forward but then we find that as we
[27:59] spoke on before God already had the
[28:03] prepared ground right prepared ground
[28:07] that is not just dirt but this prepared
[28:12] ground dirt like the other dirt but yet
[28:15] it's different because it's ground that
[28:18] he prepared before the foundation of the
[28:20] world
[28:21] now we find out that that this repair
[28:25] ground it's actually the genes that were
[28:30] placed in his children
[28:32] so that when the word or the water of
[28:37] the word comes
[28:39] that it the work comes it would be able
[28:42] to receive that water on that word that
[28:49] dropped on the good ground and the good
[28:51] ground would be an absorbent to receive
[28:55] it all praise God don't get mixed up
[28:58] with how I said all of that but I'm
[29:00] thinking different things while I'm
[29:02] talking but the you know if you have
[29:05] caught this message doesn't matter how
[29:08] jungled I sound you are going to know
[29:10] what I'm really saying
[29:13] right so the seeds have already been
[29:17] sold praise God we thank god well what
[29:21] we are now we hear the talk we're
[29:24] waiting on that last one to come in we
[29:26] don't know where that individual that
[29:29] person or persons are and that's why we
[29:32] keep preaching the word because we don't
[29:35] know where the last one is and so the
[29:38] word uh continue has to go forth so that
[29:43] it can attract the The Thirst or hunger
[29:46] that's in that Gene in that person
[29:49] wherever they are and call them to
[29:52] attention of the word of God
[29:55] okay praise the name of the Lord
[29:57] hallelujah amen praise God he says here
[30:01] the seeds are sown
[30:05] and the latter rain is falling
[30:08] hallelujah praise God Amen the latter
[30:12] rain is falling why why why are you he's
[30:16] talking about the lot of rain which we
[30:18] know of course that his ministry was the
[30:22] the latter rain amen and we are
[30:25] receiving both former and latter rain
[30:28] right now by the grace of God the
[30:31] teaching Reign and the Harvest rain we
[30:35] are receiving it all right now praise
[30:37] the name of the Lord we thank God for
[30:40] that now he says the light rain is
[30:42] falling
[30:43] and I'm saying this now but it's falling
[30:48] so it can bring these seeds to fullness
[30:52] that is why that last rain comes even
[30:56] with natural harvest the rain comes to
[30:59] bring the fruits to their fullness
[31:03] if they just get sunlight sunlight
[31:06] sunlight all the time they'll be sweet
[31:08] yeah but they'll be kind of shriveled up
[31:10] and and they not have the body to them
[31:13] that they need they got to have balance
[31:15] of sun and rain and so the rain he said
[31:20] is now falling praise God and that rain
[31:23] is falling the reason for it falling
[31:25] which is what I'm telling you now is to
[31:28] bring
[31:29] both seeds to their fullness
[31:32] because we're talking now not just the
[31:36] seed of God
[31:38] but remember that there come an evil one
[31:41] that he sought seeds too
[31:43] and uh they both fell
[31:46] uh and now the rain is falling and it's
[31:49] falling on the Justin on the unjust
[31:52] and all those seeds are coming up
[31:55] maturing and coming to their fullness at
[31:59] this time uh to so that they can be
[32:02] gathered up together praise God now one
[32:07] seed one group of seeds will be gathered
[32:12] together into a great Federation of
[32:15] churches
[32:17] it'll be gathered into a great
[32:19] Federation of churches
[32:21] and the other group which I believe we
[32:25] are a part of that group
[32:27] uh is being gathered
[32:31] into into a a what we would call the
[32:36] bride
[32:37] she's being gathered together uh as the
[32:41] bride Hallelujah
[32:43] she of course is the Original Seed
[32:48] praise the Lord because the sower sown
[32:52] he says and then an enemy came
[32:56] but the Original Seed is what I'm
[32:59] talking about there all right that
[33:02] Original Seed of the Living God
[33:06] that they the first group is trying to
[33:10] go to put her out of operations
[33:14] absolutely listen to The Prophet here he
[33:17] says they will first bring themselves
[33:20] into a Federation of churches
[33:25] and then this great this kind of church
[33:30] like this is talking about the
[33:32] Tabernacle where he was speaking he says
[33:35] will be put out of operations
[33:40] see
[33:41] my but at that time
[33:45] Jesus will appear
[33:48] and he will then begin to show which is
[33:54] the bride and which is not the bride
[33:58] I believe he's talking about the quick
[34:01] short work right there and the bride
[34:03] being put on display for a short while
[34:06] for a short period of time she'll be put
[34:08] on display and uh and the world will
[34:12] have an opportunity at least to know
[34:15] what and who is the true bride and who
[34:18] is not the true bride that we know
[34:21] according to the word of God hallelujah
[34:25] amen now all scripture has got to be
[34:28] fulfilled we know that every scripture
[34:31] has got to be fulfilled in its day and
[34:35] in its time praise God hallelujah now
[34:39] remember before
[34:42] scripture must be fulfilled he says but
[34:45] this boycott I'm telling you about has
[34:49] to come
[34:51] that is part of the scriptures that must
[34:55] be fulfilled
[34:57] amen praise God
[35:01] no
[35:03] but before this boycott comes on her
[35:08] right
[35:09] there has to be a seed already sown for
[35:15] God to take a church out of that
[35:18] amen it's going to repeat themselves but
[35:21] he's telling you the fact a seed has got
[35:24] to be sowed and it's already sold that
[35:28] God already has now the opportunity to
[35:32] take his elect out of that praise God
[35:35] hallelujah amen do you understand now
[35:39] do you understand
[35:41] the seed and he repeats again this seed
[35:45] has already been sown
[35:48] the seed has been sown
[35:50] oh my yes yes now think of it
[35:55] first the denominational seed now this
[35:59] is my connotation uh the first the
[36:03] denominational seed has been sold
[36:05] you believe that
[36:07] amen who do you think saw that I mean
[36:11] sowing down Through the Ages but in our
[36:13] age why you think he mentioned Billy
[36:15] Graham or Roberts what do you think you
[36:18] mentioned those they were actually
[36:20] blinding and whatever else the people
[36:23] and they were actually suing the other
[36:26] seed
[36:27] and while he is sowing uh you know an
[36:32] enemy has done it at the other side is
[36:34] sowing also and uh and those that have
[36:38] no Revelation all calls it the word all
[36:41] is calling it The Seed it's the same
[36:44] thing to them they think it's the same
[36:46] thing it's not the same thing right
[36:49] because one was sowing towards the
[36:52] denominational seeds on the Earth
[36:56] and the other was sowing towards the
[37:00] elect of God the original seed that
[37:04] would come out of the Earth's Harvest
[37:07] okay praise God hallelujah now he says
[37:12] that denominational seed for is making a
[37:17] form
[37:18] forming itself
[37:20] into an image of the Beast
[37:24] they're forming in other words the
[37:26] religious uh uh configuration of
[37:30] churches or system it's changing all the
[37:33] time
[37:34] right some are being swallowed up by
[37:38] others
[37:39] others you may say oh that church closed
[37:41] down they disappeared no they went over
[37:44] into another group
[37:46] right
[37:47] so all these groups are consolidating
[37:50] they might not even know they're
[37:52] consolidating or consciously
[37:55] consolidating but they are consolidating
[37:59] together by the God's will purpose it's
[38:03] happening because the word must be
[38:06] fulfilled
[38:07] okay praise God so that denominational
[38:11] seed making and forming itself to an
[38:15] image of the Beast amen
[38:18] then he puts here now the Church of Rome
[38:23] right the Church of Rome
[38:26] but remember
[38:28] Hallelujah the other seed that's for
[38:32] being formed is the true bride of Jesus
[38:36] Christ
[38:38] hallelujah amen God what is happening
[38:41] now is the finishing of the mystery
[38:45] The Mystery of the ages is actually the
[38:48] true church
[38:50] right the true church in each age was
[38:54] the mystery of that age but now we are
[38:57] the end of it so just the angel cried
[39:00] and tried to tell us that in Revelation
[39:02] 10 the finishing the mystery you'll
[39:06] finish the mystery amen the mystery of
[39:09] God hallelujah amen in this form praise
[39:13] God so the mystery and formation of uh
[39:18] the completion let me say it this way of
[39:22] the body of Jesus Christ
[39:25] uh that was being formed down Through
[39:27] the Ages the new creation not the old
[39:31] creation which is physical natural but
[39:34] Jesus and my father work and now I work
[39:37] the father worked on a natural creation
[39:39] which came on the scene as we see it and
[39:42] know it now but he says now I work and
[39:45] his work was what this new creation
[39:48] a nuclear that's New Creation praise the
[39:51] Lord and that new creation was a
[39:54] formation of his body just like God
[39:58] formed the Natural Body of Adam and it
[40:00] laid on the Earth
[40:02] until God was ready to breathe in it the
[40:05] breath of life now we find out in the
[40:08] same way but we've quoted the courts and
[40:10] you've heard them before when he said in
[40:12] each age God formed like the feet and
[40:15] then he came up to the ties and then he
[40:17] came right up to the to the uh tongue uh
[40:21] of the Pentecostals and the CNAs and the
[40:24] of the Prophet amen and then the
[40:27] intelligence amen no more moving Parts
[40:31] but even then the body Adam laid on the
[40:35] ground perfect but until God breathed
[40:39] the Breath of Life in him Hallelujah
[40:42] that's the same thing now now we find
[40:45] out the body of the bride was formed
[40:48] down up Through the Ages until the thing
[40:51] the thing has come up now to its
[40:54] Perfection of the formation of the body
[40:57] of Christ Hallelujah and just waiting
[41:01] for that fullness of the breath of life
[41:03] to strike her amen watch we are here
[41:07] worshiping serving every day but this
[41:10] thing is going to begin to stand on its
[41:12] own feet walk move speak and do all
[41:16] things for the glory of God that will be
[41:19] just for a short while that they can
[41:21] know what's real and what's not real but
[41:23] I'm glad that I'm a part of it I'm glad
[41:26] that God has me look I can't answer
[41:28] every question I don't know how that's
[41:31] going to happen this is going to happen
[41:32] but the Bible says it's going to happen
[41:35] the Bible says all scripture must be
[41:39] fulfilled amen praise God hallelujah
[41:42] amen praise God I'm so glad for this
[41:45] prophet of God
[41:48] because his ministry sowed these seeds
[41:51] up today I I mean every day you do that
[41:55] the same thing you pick up a book maybe
[41:58] you don't read the whole team and read a
[42:00] couple of pages or something but every
[42:02] page every tape every sermon you'll find
[42:07] seeds seeds seeds seeds seeds seeds
[42:10] they're everywhere planted in there oh
[42:14] my and you see them and it's time for
[42:16] you to see them praise the Lord and
[42:19] you're quickened by them you're
[42:21] germinated by them it brings you to a
[42:24] place where we realize there praise God
[42:27] that this prophecies saw the message and
[42:32] Ministry sought the seeds and also
[42:35] brought down the dung pour of this lack
[42:39] of rain upon us that we might know who
[42:42] God is and what he's doing in this last
[42:44] time amen hallelujah now you understand
[42:50] that Adam's branded that's Eve was
[42:54] rejected
[42:56] to bring life
[42:59] to bring life
[43:01] amen she was at that time
[43:06] eternal life she would have been an
[43:08] instrument to bring forth
[43:11] eternal life
[43:12] but he says she was rejected to bring
[43:17] life and instead she brought forth death
[43:22] by her product
[43:25] that she produced then he says here our
[43:29] bodies amen is her product amen and uh
[43:35] and that we know that we all will die
[43:39] amen look at us you can see it that we
[43:42] all die because that's her product amen
[43:46] she didn't bring forth God's product uh
[43:49] what God wanted her to bring forth but
[43:52] she bring forth what she wants to bring
[43:54] forth the church is doing the same
[43:56] they're not bringing for what God wants
[43:58] them to bring forth they'll bring him
[44:01] forth whatever Doctrine they feel is
[44:03] right and what they feel what they think
[44:05] are what they see arise or whatever they
[44:08] they put together by their knowledge of
[44:11] languages and everything else mystifying
[44:14] the people that they know something when
[44:16] they know nothing they don't have
[44:18] anything whatsoever now we know that
[44:23] Adam's right rejected it and brought
[44:27] death
[44:28] Jehovah's brine is talking about Israel
[44:31] now you see now he died and God took a
[44:38] people out of the Gentiles for his name
[44:44] is not right I said his name
[44:48] Hallelujah not just titles his name
[44:52] his name just like a woman takes a man's
[44:57] name right
[45:00] the same way the bride see that's it my
[45:06] goodness now we know that uh he's going
[45:10] back what I've already said but he's
[45:12] saying here every Revival in each age uh
[45:17] that preacher or that Minister that God
[45:22] placed in that particular age
[45:24] it brings forth a true preacher
[45:27] and that preacher stays on the word
[45:31] and that creates a Revival that gathers
[45:36] all them elect out of that generation
[45:40] amen so that's what I was telling you
[45:43] down Through the Ages a harvest was
[45:47] gathered but by each uh messenger that
[45:51] was in that particular age our harvests
[45:54] were gathered but we are now at the end
[45:57] of all things for the church ages and we
[46:01] are at the last Harvest of all the ages
[46:05] to go out of here see oh my but now
[46:11] we find out
[46:13] that
[46:15] uh when they gathered them seeds right
[46:20] one set went into
[46:24] seed meaning it went rotten right oh and
[46:29] God could never use that again talking
[46:32] about denominationalism entering into
[46:34] the True Church of the Living God and
[46:37] once they denominated God could not use
[46:41] them again see and she died right then
[46:46] when she denominated
[46:49] died right then
[46:51] think of the al-muti god used them men
[46:55] but look at the and he named an
[46:58] organization he says they are dead at
[47:01] midnight
[47:02] look at their methodists look at them
[47:03] Pentecostals look at the Presbyterians
[47:06] look at the lutherans look at the
[47:07] nazarenes look at the pilgrim Holiness
[47:09] Godly men great man well you know
[47:13] Whitfield Robinson and many of the
[47:15] others they preached that gospel that
[47:18] generation received this seed and was
[47:22] that was sown for their part of the body
[47:26] that was to be formed for that age
[47:30] Hallelujah they received that part of
[47:33] the word to enable them to form that
[47:36] part of the body
[47:38] That was supposed to be formed for that
[47:40] particular age amen just not the way it
[47:44] is just like corn you know goes from the
[47:47] bud the stock and so on Leaf right up to
[47:50] the tassel and each age has to produce
[47:53] their particular uh part that they're
[47:55] supposed to produce right yeah the the
[47:58] corn is not going to just come up out of
[48:00] the ground it's got to start be informed
[48:03] first in one stage next stage next stage
[48:06] and we're at the last part where the
[48:09] full air we're all now all the husk and
[48:14] shock are curling away they're getting
[48:17] away from the real true seed of the
[48:19] Living God we don't have to as we used
[48:22] to think we don't have to separate
[48:24] ourselves from anybody God is a let the
[48:27] separation take place they naturally
[48:29] separate themselves they don't want to
[48:33] be around the true seed but they will
[48:37] want to turn on and said you put them
[48:40] out you separated yourself from them but
[48:44] you did no such thing amen you just
[48:46] stood on the word and you didn't change
[48:48] your faith you didn't change whatever
[48:50] you're doing but they just can't stand
[48:53] being around you with you or hear what
[48:55] you're talking and they can't take it
[48:57] anymore and then naturally just separate
[49:00] see it just curled away from the entire
[49:03] thing right oh praise God hallelujah
[49:07] also
[49:09] whatever it is that Minister brought the
[49:14] word for that particular day
[49:18] and then it called them people from the
[49:23] Four Winds of the Earth
[49:26] and took out the elect of that
[49:28] generation
[49:30] and from the elect ones he built that
[49:34] part of the House of the Living God
[49:36] amen praise God hallelujah amen oh
[49:41] praise God and then he says but now this
[49:45] ministry here
[49:47] has has to hone everything into place
[49:52] amen oh so when he comes when that
[49:56] headstone comes it will just catch right
[49:59] into it amen praise God hallelujah see
[50:03] oh my there will be a Rapture right then
[50:07] see because that headstone will come
[50:10] catch right into it and they'll be a
[50:13] Rapture and they'll all be taken
[50:16] Hallelujah and the rest of the body that
[50:20] was there will also have to come with it
[50:23] he's saying when we are caught up they
[50:26] without us couldn't be made perfect
[50:29] but once the Lord begins to move and we
[50:32] are being caught up amen they without us
[50:35] can't the body cannot be a perfect body
[50:37] until all the parts are there and so
[50:40] they all have to be raised they all have
[50:43] to be brought up praise God and the
[50:45] whole thing brought up together what
[50:47] Paul said then shall we be caught up
[50:50] together to meet the Lord in the air
[50:53] Hallelujah we'll all be together in the
[50:56] presence of the Living God hallelujah
[50:59] amen praise God now praise God and so
[51:04] she'll be then you must understand
[51:08] she'll be gone into heaven then do you
[51:13] believe that
[51:14] praise the Lord shall be gone into
[51:17] heaven now friends when I say she'll be
[51:20] gone into heaven not a denomination
[51:26] he made sure that he made it plain that
[51:29] you understand him clearly I'm not
[51:31] talking about denomination he said and
[51:34] continues I'm talking about the Church
[51:37] of the word of God she has gone into
[51:40] heaven and not a denomination he says do
[51:44] you believe it
[51:45] amen I believe it friends and I believe
[51:49] we're caught up in the middle of it
[51:50] right now and I'm winding this down here
[51:53] now by the grace of God remember I
[51:56] repeat again the word has been sold
[52:03] amen
[52:04] and
[52:06] now is the coming forth of the spirit
[52:11] amen
[52:12] use the word rain that's what he's
[52:15] saying he knows he sold the word and
[52:17] he's leaving so he says now what is
[52:20] happening is the coming forth of the
[52:23] spirit the rain the spirit rain is now
[52:26] to come upon the genes of God that's
[52:30] here upon the Earth Hallelujah because
[52:34] remember Billy Graham and them
[52:38] he let them preach everywhere
[52:41] or the Roberts and them Godly men though
[52:45] they be let them preach everywhere
[52:48] Hallelujah
[52:50] but thank God the Lord has sent me to
[52:55] sow seeds somewhere else
[52:58] that he might have a church amen and I
[53:02] believe the seed he repeats has been
[53:06] sown
[53:07] I believe she is now ready for the
[53:12] Harvest
[53:13] hallelujah praise God Amen now I put my
[53:19] uh a little
[53:21] note here calling this prophecy nothing
[53:24] it doesn't say that here but I put that
[53:27] beside here because that's how I see it
[53:30] and when that Spirit Falls
[53:34] and begins to move amongst them people
[53:39] that will cause them denominations
[53:43] to begin to swing together
[53:46] just as certain as I'm standing here in
[53:49] this pulpit
[53:50] see
[53:52] and then we know that the church
[53:57] at that time will be ousted I believe we
[54:02] are right near to that right now because
[54:05] the revelation of the world is building
[54:07] to such a point that literally as we
[54:10] have said before is when you try to talk
[54:13] to people even in the message and still
[54:17] don't have a real revelation of what the
[54:20] prophet taught and you sound as if you
[54:23] are one that's speaking in tongues uh
[54:25] you know
[54:27] um and that took to people they will not
[54:30] understand you people in the message
[54:31] might not get a full revelation of what
[54:33] you're saying but it will infuriate
[54:37] the denominational people
[54:39] because of what you are teaching what
[54:41] you are preaching is total opposition
[54:45] and and and the devil knows where it's
[54:48] headed the people naturally may not be
[54:51] consciously aware of where it's headed
[54:54] but the devil knows where this thing is
[54:56] headed and as the prophet said he's
[54:58] going to try to close you up but he said
[55:00] he's not going to be closed up she's
[55:02] going up
[55:03] praise God and we'll thank God for that
[55:06] hallelujah amen praise God they'll you
[55:11] see and the True Church of God will be
[55:17] ousted amen because them denominationals
[55:21] will swing together a certainness I'm
[55:23] standing here in this pulpit
[55:26] and the church will be ousted
[55:30] then there will start such a racket
[55:36] and in other words they're going to be
[55:38] against her the church and living God to
[55:42] discover there are people teaching
[55:43] there's one God when all of us all of us
[55:47] are teaching the Trinity
[55:48] you're telling us we are we are liars we
[55:52] are lying we're bringing false doctrine
[55:54] that we are this and you're not educated
[55:56] and we have all these doctors with
[55:57] divinity you can understand what he's
[55:59] saying there yeah such a racket that
[56:03] they'll swing together and Confederate
[56:06] it
[56:07] see
[56:09] and by confedering in it they'll put a
[56:13] boycott
[56:14] on anybody that does not belong to them
[56:19] amen that will not belong to them he's
[56:22] talking about that Confederation of
[56:24] churches right they will put a boycott
[56:27] on you
[56:28] amen praise the Lord hallelujah and then
[56:34] Rome will rule the world
[56:39] and then
[56:41] Rome will rule the world
[56:45] amen remember
[56:48] but shall only rule for one hour
[56:52] according to the scriptures we read it
[56:54] in the scripture there Babylon the
[56:57] greatest Fallen but in one hour all her
[57:00] glory and everything is taken away from
[57:03] her hallelujah amen remember
[57:08] she remember this she'll rule yes but
[57:12] only for a little piece of time only for
[57:17] a little piece of time right oh my
[57:21] she'll remember again he said not
[57:25] communism
[57:27] keep your eyes on romanism
[57:31] not on the Iron Curtain not on the
[57:35] Chinese bamboo curtain but on the Roman
[57:39] Purple curtain that's where we're to
[57:43] keep our eyes for romanism will rule
[57:48] this world and she'll rule it with the
[57:53] cooperation
[57:54] of the Protestants
[57:58] in a denominational formation of
[58:02] churches
[58:04] right oh my which God has already
[58:09] rejected he rejected it in type in Eve
[58:13] and he has rejected it consistently down
[58:16] Through the Ages the moment they
[58:18] denominated that's it that was the end
[58:21] of the whole thing that now friends
[58:24] that's as close as I know as I can tell
[58:28] you from the word of God
[58:31] amen
[58:33] before I close this let me show this to
[58:37] you here uh that in the same way
[58:42] when Jesus was brought to be tried and
[58:45] crucified
[58:47] because that's what it reminded me so
[58:50] much of
[58:51] that
[58:52] this do you know the Sadducees and the
[58:55] Pharisees who are bitter enemies
[58:58] because the Sadducees
[59:00] they were like modernism modern
[59:03] Christians they don't believe in angels
[59:07] and and spirits and all these kinds of
[59:10] things
[59:11] the Pharisees believed in angels and
[59:15] demons and supernatural beings the
[59:17] Sadducees wanted nothing to do with them
[59:20] because they they don't believe that
[59:22] right see and then you had
[59:27] um Herod well Herod was a worldly man
[59:30] Wine Woman song and great big parties
[59:34] and everything else and both Pharisees
[59:37] and Sadducees want nothing to do with
[59:38] him
[59:39] because the at least were people who
[59:41] spend their time in the Torah and so on
[59:45] and they want nothing to do with him and
[59:47] his worldliness uh that he had out there
[59:50] and then there was a pilot and Rome
[59:55] and they did not want to do much with
[59:58] them they gave them their orders they
[1:00:00] tell them what they had to do but there
[1:00:02] was not too much of Association but what
[1:00:05] I'm showing you here when we go back to
[1:00:07] the scripture
[1:00:08] Herod says Babylon has fallen in one
[1:00:12] hour but I and this formation of
[1:00:14] churches takes place just with a racket
[1:00:17] and then all of a sudden they come
[1:00:18] together but now in one night
[1:00:23] the Pharisees and the Sadducees the
[1:00:26] Romans Herod
[1:00:28] they all come into agreement
[1:00:30] this man has got to be crucified
[1:00:34] we got to get these people out of the
[1:00:37] land we've got to stop them from
[1:00:39] whatever they're doing the same thing
[1:00:42] they did back there you see that spirit
[1:00:45] is gone that spirit is still here fixing
[1:00:49] itself and getting ready to do the same
[1:00:51] thing again
[1:00:53] amen one night better enemies your night
[1:00:58] confederated that they might come
[1:01:01] against the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:01:04] they're coming against him again in his
[1:01:07] great form
[1:01:08] brother I'm going back as I wind it
[1:01:11] close now he says remember this is as
[1:01:15] close as I know the word of God and
[1:01:19] remember
[1:01:20] all I have told you is the truth
[1:01:26] now take it home
[1:01:29] study it real closely
[1:01:32] and wisely
[1:01:34] pray and see what the Lord will reveal
[1:01:39] to you
[1:01:40] he's literally telling you not just
[1:01:42] because I'm say it you just believe it
[1:01:44] but I want you to take this go back seek
[1:01:48] the Lord for yourself pray pray over it
[1:01:50] ask him to show you reveal to you wisely
[1:01:54] and God will make it known do you love
[1:01:58] him
[1:01:59] do you love him he's asking that and I'm
[1:02:02] asking that do you love him will you
[1:02:04] serve him praise the name of the Lord
[1:02:06] God bless you all as we come to the end
[1:02:08] the last Harvest praise God God bless
[1:02:11] you tonight our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:02:14] we trust that you give forth wisdom and
[1:02:17] understanding to your people in the
