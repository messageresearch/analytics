[42:31] God called
[42:33] himen they were living in that land of
[42:36] Haron right and they came down in this
[42:40] land and Abraham wasn't better than
[42:42] anyone else as we were saying amen
[42:46] hallelujah but when God called Abraham
[42:49] he saved him and he gave him his
[42:52] Covenant
[42:55] unconditionally
[42:57] no attachment to
[42:58] it amen

[43:13] eat of that Forbidden Fruit of the tree
[43:17] amen you're going to die and you're
[43:20] going to surely die so there was a
[43:22] condition attached to that but with
[43:25] Abraham here now the promise that he
[43:27] gave to Abraham he said I will praise
[43:31] God Amen I will unconditional nothing
[43:36] attached to it God promised it and he's
[43:39] going to fulfill it no matter what it

[43:51] we don't want to jump ahead now the Lord
[43:54] had said unto Abraham get thee out of

[44:00] from thy Father's House unto a land that
[44:05] I will show you amen hallelujah slide
[44:09] four amen you got it up
[44:11] there now the Lords and I will make thee

[45:26] bless those people who receed
[45:29] them amen that's
[45:32] history

[45:38] Lord had spoken unto him and lot went
[45:42] with him big
[45:44] mistake Hallelujah and Abraham was 75
[45:49] years old when he departed out of Haron
[45:53] and Abraham took Sarah Abra

[46:00] brother's son and all their substance
[46:03] they had gathered and the souls that
[46:06] they had gotten in Haron and they went
[46:09] forth to go into the land of Canaan and
[46:12] into the land of Canaan they came amen

[46:26] Hallelujah and when God calls amen a man
[46:32] hallelujah

[1:02:01] hallelujah thank you
[1:02:03] Lord now we see Abraham in this walk
[1:02:07] that God called him to you know he never

[1:02:14] he kept moving on as God's
[1:02:18] spirit has you know guide him and
[1:02:21] directed him amen and as you see from
[1:02:24] the scripture yeah in Genesis 12: 7 it
[1:02:28] says and the Lord appeared unto Abraham
[1:02:30] and he said unto thy seed will I give
[1:02:32] thee this land and there he build he an
[1:02:35] altar unto the Lord who appeared unto
[1:02:38] him Genesis 129 and Abraham journeyed
[1:02:43] going on still towards the
[1:02:47] South amen hallelujah so he never put
[1:02:51] down roots and say well this is it I'm
[1:02:54] settled here amen hallelujah until God
[1:02:58] took him down
[1:03:01] Amen to the outskirts of
[1:03:05] Sodom Hallelujah where the bright lights
[1:03:08] were where the city life was very very
[1:03:12] attractive and Satan loves to bring us
[1:03:16] to the bright lights Amen to add to the
[1:03:20] attractive things where the life seem so
[1:03:23] easygoing in amen you have everything
[1:03:27] all the money all the woman all the
[1:03:30] parties to attend to all the the
[1:03:33] hierarchy and big shot all the dressing
[1:03:36] and everything else and Satan loves to
[1:03:39] attract you with those things
[1:03:42] amen but beside it all God was blessing
[1:03:46] Abraham so much amen that it comes at it
[1:03:49] came a time in his life when he had to
[1:03:52] separate himself from
[1:03:55] lot and lot represents the nominal
[1:04:00] church or the nominal Christian or the
[1:04:03] nomal or the unbeliever how you might
[1:04:05] want to put it man and as we said God is
[1:04:08] calling you for separation but when God
[1:04:11] called Abraham he didn't call lot but
[1:04:13] God took lot um Abraham took lot with
[1:04:15] him and he took his father I believe his
[1:04:19] father with him too amen and God could
[1:04:22] not bless him the way he want wanted to
[1:04:24] bless him until they had to separate
[1:04:27] them amen hallelujah praise God and we
[1:04:30] see that lot went down to Sodom and
[1:04:32] Abraham took the hillside
[1:04:34] amen and and in Genesis 121 say and it
[1:04:38] came to pass when he was come near into
[1:04:41] Egypt that he said unto Sarai his wife
[1:04:45] behold now I know that thou art a fear
[1:04:48] woman to look
[1:04:50] upon so from the very s day
[1:04:56] that God gave Sarah or Abraham and Sarah
[1:04:59] that
[1:05:00] promise though she was Barren she didn't
[1:05:04] have any CH children amen their bodies
[1:05:09] started to change
[1:05:12] right as they journeyed and
[1:05:15] walk with the Lord their bodies started
[1:05:19] to
[1:05:20] change not only internally but
[1:05:23] externally it started to show when you
[1:05:26] started to walk in this revealed word at
[1:05:30] this hour God already started to change
[1:05:35] you and we always he the Rapture is
[1:05:38] already in you it's a
[1:05:40] process amen and one day you're going to
[1:05:43] see the full manifestation of that
[1:05:47] process that already began in you amen
[1:05:50] amen hallelujah and I always say the
[1:05:52] things you used to do
[1:05:55] you do them no
[1:05:56] more so God already start a change in
[1:05:59] your life
[1:06:00] already amen the places you used to go I
[1:06:05] go them no
[1:06:06] more the songs I used to sing I sing
[1:06:09] them no more you stop the swearing you
[1:06:12] stop the drinking you stop the carousing
[1:06:14] the partying and all them kind of thing
[1:06:17] right Hallelujah because God already
[1:06:20] started a change in your life and you as
[1:06:23] you walk along the Christian pathway and
[1:06:26] journey a change has already begun in
[1:06:30] you and people will observe and notice
[1:06:34] it you're different and they will tell
[1:06:38] you you're different so when Sarah Sarah
[1:06:41] went down into Egypt she started to look
[1:06:44] like a young
[1:06:45] lady she was already looking like a
[1:06:48] young lady amen so this change was
[1:06:51] already inside her and was reflecting on
[1:06:54] the outside so when she went down there
[1:06:58] amen you know the story Pharaoh the king
[1:07:01] down there saw her and
[1:07:04] wanted you know he saw her and he asked
[1:07:07] who's this feir Maiden who's this
[1:07:10] beautiful young lady that I I want her
[1:07:13] so Abraham say said listen now man to
[1:07:15] save my neck you better tell them you're
[1:07:19] my sister you know it's a half you tell
[1:07:22] them you know that was his half sister
[1:07:25] he didn't tell a full lie tell a half
[1:07:27] lie half
[1:07:31] truth but lie is lie
[1:07:34] anyhow what happened to
[1:07:37] Eve one
[1:07:38] [Applause]
[1:07:41] word one word one word destroyed the
[1:07:45] whole the whole plan starting there amen
[1:07:49] put everybody on that
[1:07:51] sinen
[1:07:52] Hallelujah and then God had to take them
[1:07:55] out of that situation amen hallelujah
[1:07:58] because you see God had a plan for Sarah
[1:08:01] and Sarah alone he said I will and he
[1:08:05] will do everything to bring that to pass
[1:08:08] so that King could not marry her as wife
[1:08:12] amen because God had it a perfect plan
[1:08:17] to down through Sarah Through the Ages
[1:08:20] amen for the Christ child amen and for
[1:08:25] you and I as Abraham fth
[1:08:28] seed amen you know your part of
[1:08:31] Abraham amen because then you receive
[1:08:34] Abraham's Faith or Revelation amen

[1:08:40] seat could receive that kind of
[1:08:42] Fai hallelujah amen hallelujah praise
[1:08:48] God praise God I'm going to just wind
[1:08:50] this up in about five minutes but uh
[1:08:54] so you can
[1:08:55] start getting yourself prepared for the
[1:08:58] baptism hallelujah we're going to have
[1:09:00] to continue this some other time amen
[1:09:03] and just want to wrap it up a little bit
[1:09:05] here
[1:09:09] hallelujah so we saw that Pharaoh tried
[1:09:12] to take Sarah as his wife amen if you
[1:09:15] read the scriptures in Genesis 12 men D
[1:09:21] and then God's
[1:09:22] blessing was with great substance amen
[1:09:27] for Abraham and they God had to separate
[1:09:30] them
[1:09:32] Hallelujah then after many battles and
[1:09:35] tests God brought them through amen so
[1:09:40] you see God promised that she would be a
[1:09:43] mother of Nations and she would conceive
[1:09:46] and bear a son But as time passed their
[1:09:51] Fai were tested
[1:09:54] just as so you and I God made promises
[1:09:57] to you and Satan always comes and and
[1:10:00] whisper in ear did he really mean
[1:10:03] that all the time he comes and question
[1:10:06] you are you really
[1:10:08] saved you say you're born again look
[1:10:12] what you just thought of just now look
[1:10:15] what you just did or something along the
[1:10:18] line amen hallelujah and then you get
[1:10:22] tested from outside and you get tested
[1:10:25] from
[1:10:26] inside and the worst kind of testing
[1:10:29] this is to get is from inside or
[1:10:32] not the ones that closest to you test
[1:10:35] you and try you Amen to the core to see
[1:10:39] if you're really mean or you really you
[1:10:42] really believe or you really believe man
[1:10:45] hallelujah hallelujah you know what I
[1:10:47] say the enemies of your own household
[1:10:50] amen hallelujah and we have a saying in
[1:10:52] Trinidad that is the worst thing to get
[1:10:55] bit by your own
[1:11:03] dog but that's how life is you know and
[1:11:06] God does bring test to you to see your
[1:11:09] reaction because you're not fight
[1:11:11] against fighting against flesh and
[1:11:15] blood
[1:11:17] principalities Amen in high places it's
[1:11:20] not just ordinary place from high place
[1:11:22] them think those things come from
[1:11:24] Hallelujah so don't give up when you're
[1:11:26] testing and the Trials come keep
[1:11:28] pressing on
[1:11:31] hallelujah praise
[1:11:34] God but it come it came a time where
[1:11:39] Sarah was having trouble believing the
[1:11:44] promise of
[1:11:46] God we ever reached a situation like
[1:11:48] that in that in in our walk that we
[1:11:52] start to kind of you know little bit you
[1:11:56] know doubt a little bit now is this true
[1:12:00] that we promised and the enemy love to
[1:12:03] whisper that into our ears and we try in
[1:12:06] our own efforts now to bring it to
[1:12:10] pass amen hallelujah we try to take
[1:12:13] God's plan and we try to work it out for
[1:12:16] ourselves but you cannot do
[1:12:19] that amen you could only please God by
[1:12:25] Revelation what God shows you to do he's
[1:12:28] the one you say you put your life in his
[1:12:31] hand amen and you said he's the one
[1:12:33] who's going to lead me and he's the one
[1:12:35] who's going to guide me then you take
[1:12:37] your hand off and you're taking the
[1:12:39] situation now in your own hand now to
[1:12:41] work it out for your own
[1:12:43] self and it doesn't work right it going
[1:12:47] to bring a whole lot of
[1:12:50] chaos and in Abraham's life up to this
[1:12:54] day this very moment that chaos that
[1:12:58] started there woking up to this very
[1:13:01] moment Hallelujah so we see Abraham amen

[1:13:36] means so long 10 years pass 15 years
[1:13:40] past God say I'm going to have a child
[1:13:44] but see all along if Sarah was observing
[1:13:48] herself in the
[1:13:51] mirror in God's mirror in God God's word
[1:13:54] you and I just want to type it she would
[1:13:56] have seen a change already started and

[1:20:19] already taking place in the inside so we
[1:20:22] have
[1:20:23] a couple of scriptures I'm going to read
[1:20:26] and then we go from
[1:20:29] there my first scripture will be be
[1:20:32] taken from
[1:20:35] Matthew
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:41] 2819 Matthew 28:19 said go ye therefore
[1:20:45] and teach All Nations baptizing them in
[1:20:48] the name of the father and of the son
[1:20:51] and of the Holy Ghost he never say names
[1:20:54] you will know that Father Son and Holy
[1:20:56] Ghost are just titles of God and then
[1:20:59] when you go to Luke
[1:21:00] 24 verse
[1:21:04] 47-49 it says that and that repentance
[1:21:09] and remission of sins should be preached
[1:21:11] in his name among all nations beginning
[1:21:15] at Jerusalem that's expressing the
[1:21:17] importance of the name that remission of
[1:21:20] sins forgiveness everything should be
[1:21:23] preached in his name Samuel said that
[1:21:25] everything you do in works or In Deed do
[1:21:28] it in my name and when you go to verse 4
[1:21:31] say behold I sent the promise of my
[1:21:34] father upon you be ye in the city of
[1:21:38] Jerusalem until you be Ed with the power
[1:21:41] from on high in other words when this
[1:21:43] promise was given Peter was there in
[1:21:46] Matthew
[1:21:47] 28:19 but he told them to wait until the
[1:21:51] promise comes and Acts 2 verse 3739 when
[1:21:56] the promise came when the Holy Ghost
[1:21:59] that they were waiting on came they
[1:22:01] asked them now acts 2:
[1:22:06] 37-39 acts chap 2 vers
[1:22:12] 37-39 they asked him now when they heard
[1:22:16] this they were pred in their heart and
[1:22:21] said unto Peter and the of the Apostles
[1:22:24] men and
[1:22:25] Brethren what shall we do then Peter
[1:22:28] said unto them
[1:22:30] repent and be baptized everyone of you
[1:22:34] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:22:37] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:22:40] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:22:43] the promise is unto you and to your
[1:22:47] children and to all that are far off
[1:22:51] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:22:54] called is God still calling yes amen
[1:22:57] okay so the last one in Romans said that
[1:23:00] therefore Romans chapter 6: 4-6 Romans
[1:23:04] 64-6 it says that therefore we are
[1:23:07] buried with him by baptism into death
[1:23:11] that like as Christ was raised up from
[1:23:14] dead by the glory of the father even so
[1:23:17] we should also walk in the newness of
[1:23:21] life for if you are been planted
[1:23:23] together in the likeness of death we
[1:23:25] shall also be in the likeness of his
[1:23:27] resurrection amen that means that if you
[1:23:31] really repented you believe then you
[1:23:33] leing all your sins in this water
[1:23:35] tonight you bury them can inside
