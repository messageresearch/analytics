[Music] amen we never conquered death he has conquered that for us he is our David of this day and he conquered death to bring us bethlehem's bread and water glory to God hallelujah having the best bread and the best water in all of Palestine and Christ is the believer's Bethlehem for the best bread and the best water praise God aren't you happy amen that we can say that we are one of them and that we are part of the Great uh day that we are living in Praise the Lord hallelujah amen let me begin to wind this up oh Bethlehem dwellers God bless you Christ wants a real Church in this hour he wants a real bride oh would you take the word and cut our way through get out of here take those creeps away that the real drinkers we are real drinkers that's right that the real drinkers can come back and get a real drink of cool Pentecostal Waters that once flowed out of this great well of God's word amen praise the Lord fresh water amen coming out of The Well of God's word and still flowing oh praise God all you Warriors will you pull your swords the sword of God and say I am true with all these Traditions around me I am coming back to the word I'm coming back to the truth amen hallelujah and when I come back to the truth we don't want it all seasoned up we want that word just the way it is that's right that's right Hallelujah in other words he thinking of all these programs and all the fancy stuff they have around the word of God you know uh put it this way it's like you go to some of these great fancy churches or the fancy churches or like some of these fancy restaurants where you go and you pay an exorbitant some right and you and they give you a fancy name [Music] whatever and then the chef comes out with a nice you know white his nice napkin over his arm and he's holding a silver platter comes like that with a flare and a flourish it just like that and he places it before you and until you left with that mystery there's going to be a revealing now now you're waiting for the sermon and out he pulls the cover off and when he pulls the cover off instead of a roast docker Rose turkey you look and you see a small Medallion Medallion sticks is all right I've always told him the story of how many maybe a way back but they used to have a show what this show used to be called Mr T and what was that show anyway you know Mr T that great big black man with a whole lot of jewelry around him like that and uh you know he went to New York and his limo with his driver and he felt hungry so he stopped and stop at the restaurant when when he order us get me a steak we got to properly Point give me a steak and the guy comes back and does all this stuff and then he unveils and he does What's happen you call St he says you ain't getting my money man I'm going cross down to get me some real soul food amen I'm going to go cross town get me some real soul food and that's what we want sometimes you go like the Indian Chief and uh they said Chief how was the service he went to one of his foral church he says Lots Lightning L ofer L is that right you didn't get nothing from the serice he said praise the Lord and that's what happens they go into these churches they go through all the form Melodies they can even go through screaming and shouting and yelling falling on the ground and everything else but a True Believer whose ears are tuned to the world will realize that man preach this great big sermon and everybody is caught up with it and actual fact he really didn't preach nothing you know I went to visit the uh I went back to the old country many years ago and I visited the mother of a friend of mine the friend is out here and his mother was back there so I felt it was very respectful and I the lady so I go and just pass by and visit with her and when when I went there to visit with her she was telling me you know we chatted and everything else and she said you know she said you know one day I was cooking and I I placed the Cal I don't know if some of you don't know what that let me use the Canadian word [Music] Spanish they placed inside of the I going to say but they place it inside of the pan sauce not sauce pan what you call it FL FL one anyway she was crying it up she says and somebody came to visit me and you know I had a pile of it inside there and while um while I'm cooking I'm talking with them and uh we're talking and talking and then I realiz oh my God so I kept talking when I picked up the B spoon and I'm going to stir it she says you know I'm still stirring because I'm still trying to find it the whole thing went right down until it just came to a little handful that's what she meant and I'm searching for it within the bo but that's what you have to do when you go to some of these churches they preach and they preach and they preach and you for the life for you you're hoping that the guy will just say something that you can at least get a crown that h on to and you're not getting nothing is that right all you got is spirit is Sous Mis see see that's all is and you don't have nothing coming out from it and you wonder and marble that multitudes are running in that direction brother B said you see you can get a whole bunch of chickens every 6 weeks you can produce a whole bunch of chickens but you know what an eagle one year before you get one one year before you get one eag think about it amazing look how fast you can get a whole bunch of Pharisees but look how many years it take to develop a Moses or Abraham amen sometimes it's 40 years it takes to do that that's what it is praise the Lord so here we are this is Christmas praise the Lord I don't see us having all kind of multicolored lights brother said that's the devil trying to represent the rainbow lights around God's Throne he's just a liar he's using the influence of that and then people he said hang palm trees D in Florida hang them everywhere there's no snow there or nothing and and yet they can have lights there and everything else and hang up all these lights everywhere and tinsel everywhere and then bringing paganism he said has infiltrated and mixed into Christianity amen and get the people to believe that that's Christianity that's not Christianity am this is Christianity this is Christmas God hiding in what Simplicity is that right God hiding in Simplicity not God hiding in a suit that's shiny is that right see what are you talking about you remember when that angel appeared to Mark St Martin after he had he had uh done something good on the street and that night uh uh he opened his eyes and there was the Lord standing in front of him in shining garments and he said Martin looked at him and he took a little Lo he says Martin don't you know me I am your Lord and Savior Jesus bow down and wash me and Martin looking again but brother B said the word was in St Martin and he realized that this being had a Crum on his head and the Bible said the Saints will from him at the End of the Age so Martin said you can't be him because what you doing with a crumb on your head the Saints will crumb him at the End of the Age disappear gone that devil took right off amen praise the Lord so God is Not featured in all this fantastic stuff they going on am so if you don't get a gift one gift this Christmas don't be singing the blues honestly goodness because you already got the greatest gift that anybody ever give you is the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord just saying that even if you never got any gift or somebody forgot you right don't feel slighted don't feel pushed out because you have the greatest gift that anybody can have and that gift is eternal life what what difference does it make if you have a b of gold but you got no water to get across the desert this is a story of two Prospectors they prospecting from gold and they struck gold they got it and they filled up their sacks and everything else now the boat are going to be rich but that night they're going to have to check across the desert and one of them decided that he's going to kill the other one then he could be poisonous Rich so he kills the other guy but before that happened you know they were drinking wine that they had were drinking wine that they made from some kind of U thing there I don't know how they make the tequila but anyway they make wine out there in the desert with um with the cactus they even know how to make a wine with that so they were drinking the wine and enjoying themselves now they're going to be rich and they went to sleep he killed his part loaded up the stuff on his um donkey and grabbed the water or skin that they had and headed out to the desert when he's in the middle of the desert got thirsty grabbed the water skin and started to drink only to realize that in the dark of the early morning he had picked up the water the the wine bottle and instead of the water bottle and the rest of the story is the gold didn't mean anything to him in the desert there because you can't eat it you can't drink it and he died right there with the sacks beside him for somebody else to come along and just pick it up that easy and that's how the Bible says the wicked does and the righteous just comes after and inherits it think about it amen so we don't want it seasoned up we just want it the way it is praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen last two comments here God knew they needed a savior but they were praying for a warrior to come and instead God gave them a baby they wanted a general gave them a laugh think about it he know he knew what they needed and that was their Christmas present he knows what we need he knows what you need today and what you and I need today more than above all else is a savior and that savior is Christ the Lord amen that is what we need more than anything else no matter much education whatever you have all us will come to an end and if you have no savior it doesn't make any difference but what we really need is to have a Savor this is the time to do it now Christmas was the birth of Christ so if Christmas was the birth of Christ would you let Christ be born in you again then that is Christmas that's right when Christ is born again in you that's right let Christ be born in us and you what is Christ Christ is the word amen think about him when he was being born it was the time of the decline or the fall of the Roman Empire look at that they were having a great uh a great Fandango in other words just like now they got commercial rejoicing and everything else and uh uh women going around more interested in sex appeal youth in the condition that it is just that the way the Roman Empire fell confusion among the various churches and religions oh think about it and increase taxation you know that he said as it was when Jesus was born the first time and he came the first time taxes was going up and then the increase and now he's again taxes going up how many of you heard about taxes going down your house tax going down education tax going down no all the time your taxes keep going up amen and even if they try to tell you oh well we will not uh taxes won't be raised for the next year or two but that w mean nothing because it's still going to go go up it's going up all the time like that so that's how it is Luke 2 1-7 that's where you'll find the scripture and it came to pass in the time of Herod gria that all the world should be taxed all the world and nobody's going to escape it very soon they're going to tax you for having a cat yeah a dog a bicycle even to have a phone when you pay for the phone you got to pay tax so what am I saying you're already paying tax for the phone is that right but everything is going to be taxed so uh take the word I don't want to expand you're spiritual it'll be a tax in time for believers not only natural tax you have to pay but he's telling you also that it's going to be a taxing time for you because you'll be tested all your friends out there jumping up and rejoicing Christmas turn on the shering gifts and the giv cards and everything else and you seem like Christmas coming and going and you're not joining the Trump is that right you're not going to join the band and the music and with everything else not that we're not happy we are happy we're happy to be with our families we're happy to share what we have with with the those are the less fortunate but we're doing all this with a revelation amen knowing really what Christmas is all about amen amen when the Angels came down and S to the Shepherds praise God hallelujah May the holy spirit of God anoint the angels to come down once again and Inspire us and sing to us and comfort us that to you in the House of David is a savior is Lord and that savior is is none other come M but Christ the lord glory to God hallelujah wonderful brothers and sister now um the I know the G family will be going for you know for about 2 weeks uh uh down in the Southern Caribbean uh the fongs are going also praise God I don't know who else is going are you going yes sister Johnson you praise the Lord she's going to to to to Jama praise God hallelujah amen glory to God I hope a

going to be around town or around in our area I want some of you to start to stop and think about um people or persons in our congregation that may be single and would have anywhere to go like I preach and said it's one of the lonliest times Christmas time great great you have to think about them and even though you have your family do what you have with your family but at the same time think about those people and see how you can do something to make their time also a wonderful happy and welcoming time also on your own let the Holy Spirit inspire you about those that may be among us but may be less fortunate God Inspire tell you to do anything then you do it for his glory and for his honor amen amen praise the Lord all by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit brother might take it from
