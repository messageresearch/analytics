[7:07] he meets any kinds of singing Jesus
[7:11] constantly shifts constant planets that
[7:15] is constant inspiration under glass
[7:18] [Music]
[7:21] this purpose Lord it's Wednesday night
[7:31] and it's Bible study night and it gives
[7:35] us an opportunity to look at the areas
[7:38] of the word and study and kind of draw
[7:41] from it what we have need of and what we
[7:44] desire from the Lord because he knows
[7:46] that you need faith he knows that's why
[7:49] he says don't fail to assemble
[7:52] yourselves because that's where I'm
[7:55] going to give you the faith in order to
[7:58] overcome and produce the part of the
[8:02] word you are many more so tonight we're
[8:08] going to read from the book of second
[8:09] kings thank you musicians god bless you
[8:17] second Kings chapter 2 we're gonna read
[8:22] for a verse you mean two verse eight
[8:36] praise God
[8:38] our gracious Eternal Father Lord Jesus
[8:42] we thank you tonight or that we can
[8:45] assemble knowing that your anointing
[8:48] your spirit is in our midst
[8:50] and that Lord these are precious times
[8:53] for the sons and daughters of God when
[8:56] we can gather by faith and will that you
[8:58] come and bail with us and speak and
[9:03] hear through us and it just creates such
[9:07] an atmosphere or God you can be
[9:10] strengthened and encouraged and blessed
[9:12] and we can leave
[9:15] different than the way we entered in
[9:17] Fondren that is our desire tonight Lord
[9:19] that you would just take each vessel or
[9:22] move us aside now allow us to move into
[9:24] heavenly places with you and receive all
[9:28] that you would have for us
[9:30] granted we pray will humanity aside but
[9:35] the supernatural take control
[9:41] and the Elijah from verse 8 2nd Kings
[9:44] chapter 2 and Elijah took his mantle and
[9:48] wrapped it together and smote the waters
[9:51] and they were divided hither and thither
[9:54] so that they too went over on dry ground
[9:57] and it came to pass when they were gone
[10:01] over that I gave my job said unto Elijah
[10:06] ask what I shall do for thee before I be
[10:10] taken away from thee and he has said I
[10:14] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[10:18] spirit be upon me and he said thou hast
[10:22] asked a hard thing nevertheless it
[10:25] without see me when I am taken from thee
[10:28] it shall be so unto thee but if not it
[10:32] shall not be so well praise God for it
[10:37] aren't you glad that you've recognized
[10:39] that God sent a prophet in this day
[10:42] aren't you glad that your eyes have been
[10:45] needed to realize that that the Word of
[10:49] God you know I remember when I came to
[10:52] this message I didn't realise brother
[10:55] Branham was but then there came a time
[10:59] in a season when it was made known unto
[11:03] me and it was made known unto you and
[11:07] this is what gives us to talk about
[11:12] tonight you may be seen double portion I
[11:17] believe it's a double portion a perfect
[11:19] favor
[11:32] praise God and so tonight we're going to
[11:37] be looking at that I believe that double
[11:40] portion anointing is what has come down
[11:43] upon the church in this and in this hour
[11:47] and she's operating under a faith that
[11:51] is beyond literal faith let's put it
[11:55] that way because I believe that it's
[11:58] going to take perfect fit for us to
[12:01] actually receive this body change that
[12:03] the word promises we are going to
[12:05] receive because that isn't a promise for
[12:07] this up it is a body change it is the
[12:11] rapture that is the portion of the word
[12:13] there but we have to you know sometimes
[12:16] become a look and see where it is that
[12:19] God is right now of what it is that he's
[12:23] fulfilling the portion of the word that
[12:24] is fulfilling and where the greatest
[12:28] strength and the greatest anointing the
[12:32] greatest overcoming ability comes when
[12:35] you recognize the place of the word the
[12:38] placing of the word the season of the
[12:41] word the anointing that's on the word
[12:43] for your day and what it is that you are
[12:46] expected to do by the portion of faith
[12:49] that's being released because it's an
[12:52] it's a portion of maintenance being
[12:53] released through the preaching of the
[12:56] word unity that's why it's so important
[12:58] that we get under it illegally we get
[13:00] under a ministry we must be hundra a God
[13:04] led pastor directed ministry in this
[13:09] David this hour
[13:11] and move in ways where you're jumping
[13:15] from here to there in the cab gaining
[13:19] speed right that's where you're going to
[13:20] get what you need you're under you're
[13:23] under the wrong revelation you're under
[13:26] the wrong expectation you're not you're
[13:29] not likely not where God wants you to be
[13:32] and God needs you in a certain place
[13:35] under a certain ministry fulfilling a
[13:37] certain portion of the Word of God and
[13:40] if you're if you're moving in different
[13:42] ways and your own interpretation and
[13:45] good looking for something you know
[13:47] you're looking for something you know
[13:49] really deep you're gonna miss about
[13:51] you're just gonna miss him a hundred
[13:54] billion miles amen but you want to look
[13:56] here you want to see just here we're
[13:58] gonna look at a live show and that
[14:00] notice that Elijah you know she'd have
[14:03] to her eyes Adie Elijah
[14:05] you know she recognized that he was the
[14:09] word her heard his name and she realized
[14:13] that this is where God loves this is the
[14:17] anointing for God was moving and
[14:19] revealing him and making himself known
[14:22] and doing supernatural things the word
[14:25] of the Lord was being released and
[14:27] spoken right from his love and I should
[14:31] realize that him and he crazy
[14:33] he just said there's no way I'm gonna
[14:36] let him out of my sight
[14:43] [Music]
[14:49] [Music]
[14:57] this was where he had to go you can't
[15:07] wait to assemble you can't wait for the
[15:11] word of God to come forth and meet your
[15:14] needs and speak to your life with your
[15:16] situations and to serve the very needs
[15:18] that you have the night show us was you
[15:25] know she was soul focus she realized
[15:28] that this is where I needed to be this
[15:31] is my place this is where God is gonna
[15:34] bless me this is where crockett amiss my
[15:37] blessing and I want you to know as it
[15:39] was when it was wet when they crossed
[15:41] over it was when they crossed over that
[15:44] ami Shia she realized that this is where
[15:48] I was to receive why because it was
[15:51] there that Elijah the word for her day
[15:55] said what is it that you have need and
[15:58] you know in this life you're going to
[16:02] school you're going to work you're doing
[16:04] all kinds of things and your focus in
[16:08] the things of the world
[16:09] is going to take you away from God if
[16:12] you get too focused on the things of the
[16:14] world and you get too focused on trying
[16:17] to preserve your own - and then you know
[16:20] work towards your own personal goals and
[16:23] everything else I mean that's fine but
[16:26] you need to realize that this is this is
[16:29] the hour where God is supernatural you
[17:13] need to just live marry and spend all
[17:18] our money and just saw your house and
[17:20] just burn it all up but you must have a
[17:25] revelation of who you are
[17:28] this message didn't he wants to give
[17:44] responsibility to just because work
[17:47] because remember when God comes on the
[17:50] scene and he wants to bulldoze work he's
[17:52] going to anoint some people because
[17:59] that's how his word gets fulfilled
[18:02] cerissa is a supernatural event but
[18:06] there's some people that's a revelation
[18:14] revelation of the rapture it's not a
[18:17] future event is because you're in it
[18:29] [Music]
[18:32] the change is what it's done in the
[18:35] progress and the at the end of faith in
[18:38] them and then and the body change in the
[18:40] Equality in happiness necessary to bring
[18:43] it to pass is now taking place it's
[18:49] filling of something it's perfect
[18:52] personalizing and self in you because
[18:55] he's is the word
[18:56] and he wants you to realize and I'm
[18:58] looking at my figure she caught such a
[19:01] revelation that with that double portion
[19:07] [Music]
[19:43] [Music]
[19:58] [Music]
[20:05] [Music]
[20:16] [Music]
[20:26] what is your situation
[20:37] interpretation is you get four stars and
[20:52] they want anybody on any circumstance
[20:58] character
[21:00] [Music]
[21:17] [Music]
[21:24] [Music]
[21:39] [Music]
[22:02] [Music]
[22:14] [Music]
[22:18] and so we progression of the church for
[22:24] this name this hour have to recognize
[22:27] see what this has been already fulfilled
[22:29] and not be so you know because there's a
[22:34] lot there still you know every word that
[22:37] the Prophet said you can only say what
[22:41] we believe
[22:49] [Music]
[23:07] [Music]
[23:17] my position there's an anointing that
[23:20] comes upon that position it's like I've
[23:23] always said this is God's position in
[23:25] the place individuals in the body in the
[23:28] Church of God with a purpose and a plan
[23:31] and when he position he places a person
[23:34] or an individual into whatever office
[23:37] whether it be a deacon or trustee or a
[23:39] Russian or a sunday-school teacher it's
[23:48] a position that God individuals beyond
[24:04] and recognized and she went to pieces
[25:16] he's you gotta get rid of yourself you
[25:20] gotta you gotta get rid of your own
[25:21] ideas all your upbringing all your
[25:24] tradition all the things that you
[25:26] thought that they should be
[25:29] [Music]
[25:43] [Music]
[25:52] [Music]
[26:03] [Music]
[26:13] [Music]
[26:28] [Music]
[26:42] [Music]
[27:03] [Music]
[27:16] all these things because and what the
[27:28] sons of the prophets which were to view
[27:31] a gear pole sorry
[27:34] they said the spirit of Elijah does rest
[27:37] on the Elijah and they came to bow
[27:41] themselves to the before you see when
[27:47] you get to a place where you're walking
[27:50] with God you've got that desire to to
[27:54] please the Lord you just you're walking
[27:57] because this this is the our seats of
[28:01] God I want you to hear me though this is
[28:04] the hour where this church goes back to
[28:12] the free world agency and faith and
[28:17] revelation there was no fear there was
[28:33] no doubt there was perfect love and
[28:37] perfect harmony they walked together
[28:41] God said whatever you say I give you
[28:47] dominion over the earth
[28:49] look if you say to this tree he plucked
[28:53] up and will go whatever you made in the
[28:56] animals and he'll please me you see they
[28:59] were so one they were so one and they
[29:03] were walking so
[29:04] together there was perfect faith between
[29:10] it's a special block and like I can't
[29:14] even fully fathom sometimes I get to
[29:17] thinking about it and I think Lord I
[29:19] know that we're doing back for the
[29:28] foundation your position you're crazy
[29:36] you're talking it was all from the for
[29:41] the foundations of the world everything
[29:45] that's being released now through the
[29:48] preaching of the word should be bringing
[29:51] you out of your spiritual of Asia and
[29:54] into the position that God wants you to
[29:58] be walking in just before you take a
[30:02] rapture exactly so this is a walk this
[30:10] is a progression of God's Word that
[30:12] means
[30:27] [Music]
[30:42] [Music]
[30:51] [Music]
[30:54] there's I can't really describe almost
[31:06] around this walk we're all a part of it
[31:10] if you're if you're walking with God
[31:11] you've got the revelation of this day
[31:13] this hour you've got a desire to move on
[31:16] to press on to get to get to know
[31:20] understand the mind of God of the
[31:23] purpose of God for your life and for
[31:25] your walk so that you can do what it is
[31:27] that God requires of you it's a super
[31:30] habitable walk and set it up you know
[31:33] Enoch he walked with God
[31:49] [Music]
[31:55] [Music]
[32:01] [Music]
[32:06] for so many ways to please the Lord they
[32:09] think thinkin that they can you know
[32:11] work that they can you know do it's not
[32:15] a matter there's only one thing that you
[32:25] cannot wear it says so these you wanna
[32:43] say I've seen that this is a lot of
[32:45] faith this is a supernatural cockamamie
[32:49] and look at watch watch Howard Elijah
[32:52] progresses people top their be with my
[32:57] service fifty strong men because all of
[33:00] a sudden these these people that have
[33:03] recognized what God does
[33:06] you see they were starting to recognize
[33:07] better day and its message that's what
[33:09] it's all about this is all the
[33:10] progressive revelation and when God you
[33:14] know moves along he gets a hold of your
[33:16] life there's individuals that you're
[33:18] gonna cross paths
[33:21] might be one of those whose names was
[33:24] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[33:26] at that point give it a speak a certain
[33:30] sentence and you're gonna think oh boy
[33:32] you know God's endtime prophecies
[33:36] Almighty God the revelations of God of
[33:38] the supernatural do you think that's
[33:41] good and something spoke to something
[34:01] inside we needed that wouldn't that cost
[34:04] me to respond with a certain way that I
[34:08] have never recognized or realized until
[34:12] it got hold of me and it's not so much
[34:17] what who's speaking
[34:24] [Music]
[34:28] and that changes all things that can
[34:33] change your whole circumstance in your
[34:43] own experience you receive this
[34:46] revelation
[34:47] [Music]
[34:58] [Applause]
[35:09] [Music]

[35:28] [Music]
[35:38] [Music]

[39:20] and there ain't no tellin how that can
[39:23] touch you
[39:24] how no leader didn't but he goes up he
[39:29] says so now I've got these 50 strong men
[39:32] let them go we appreciated seed my
[39:35] master less pre adventure the Spirit of
[39:38] the Lord had taken and cast it upon some
[39:41] know there's people still looking for
[39:43] brother brother still underrated right
[39:45] he's going to raise up he said don't go

[40:12] remain shall be caught up together to be
[40:15] the Lord that's gonna be the next
[40:22] [Music]
[40:23] forward and so let's read on when they
[40:29] urged him till he was a shady said seven
[40:33] and they said the fifty minute of me
[40:35] Italy he just got to know just let him
[40:38] go don't get caught up in any of the
[40:41] doctrines this is the tousle the seventh
[40:44] under the this that
[40:50] God isn't the perfect 700 word of God
[40:55] that's being released through smoking of
[40:57] the seven seals that's where he is he's
[41:02] he's now speaking and talking those
[41:05] nations that were after that seventh
[41:07] seal that's where he is now he's right
[41:11] now that's where he is in the five fold
[41:13] ministry was speaking and calling and
[41:16] placing all this individual sons and
[41:19] daughters of God and the over that's
[41:21] happening right at your local church
[41:23] amen
[41:27] right at your local church and he said
[41:30] bring me a new crew stand back here and
[41:36] then when they urge duplicate when they
[41:39] came again to him for you Terry the
[41:42] terrible he said did I not say dodo and
[41:45] the men of the city seven time I shot
[41:47] the whole that created the situation of
[41:50] the city is pleasant as my lord see it
[41:53] but the water is not and the preppin
[41:56] barren and he said bring me into
[41:58] approves and put salt there live and
[42:01] they brought a tab and he led forth unto
[42:04] the spread of the waters and cast the
[42:06] salt in there and said thus see here I
[42:09] have healed these waters there shall not
[42:12] be from death any more death or barren
[42:16] land
[42:17] so the lovers were healed unto this day
[42:19] according to the same of a mashup which
[42:23] he said he was moving into his ministry
[42:27] he was moving into his ministry where he
[42:31] now is the carrier of the prophetic word
[42:34] of God
[42:38] [Music]
[43:18] we recognize we see we heard she's a
[43:22] type of the bride she's the female
[43:25] aspect of Christ in this demonstrates
[43:31] the power of the spoken word to heal to
[43:36] heal the better lives in other words he
[43:39] spoke prosperity into the city and we've
[43:43] got that same ability that lives and
[43:45] blows in us that we could speak
[43:48] prosperity into our homes into our
[43:50] families into our situations we know he
[43:57] was demonstrating that with the right
[43:59] character things notice because this is
[44:22] important for us to recognize - you are
[44:27] a carrier of Living Word of God and
[44:31] sometimes you find yourself getting
[44:33] frustrated if by yourself getting into
[44:36] situations you know
[44:40] like to insult Anika you know he got
[44:46] like personally attacked he lashed out
[44:52] he didn't say that was now that it
[45:03] worked to show that there's a purpose in
[45:06] yeah it's going to show us that as sons
[45:10] and daughters of God does looking for us
[45:13] to have the right character that were
[45:15] not angered and we're not to be
[45:19] controlled by my spirit that's why Jesus
[45:22] said love your enemies you know he's
[45:25] talking to a friend of mine you know
[45:26] because you know he was upset because
[45:28] certain deal
[45:29] people have done in a certain way they
[45:32] were they were not being very honest
[45:34] about situations the way he was getting
[45:37] upset I said I said well we're fighting
[45:41] evil I said things have a way of working
[45:46] themselves up you know I believe
[46:02] [Music]
[46:15] I want to say I say exactly what I could
[46:19] deserve the spirit was a little bit
[46:22] different and most active in the same
[46:25] way and so but you see with a revelation
[46:28] we understand the power that base within
[46:33] us end up at the responsibility that God
[46:36] has given us as sons and daughters head
[46:39] so that we can weaken because sometimes
[46:43] we can make a mess of things your to say
[46:45] it will never not be a son or daughter
[46:48] of God if you learn it can never change
[46:52] but you can do things that sometimes
[46:56] will bring about not good situations you
[47:01] know the law of sowing and reaping and
[47:03] everything else right and there is power
[47:06] in it words you know that you speak to
[47:10] somebody and you say something to them
[47:12] and you just sing in the wrong way that
[47:15] anger and it's not being done right it
[47:18] can hurt the person it could scar the
[47:21] person it can cause the vision it can do
[47:24] things that get you got what you needed
[47:27] so you want to be careful in the way
