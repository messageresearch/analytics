[1:39] Amen I will read the scriptures at this
[1:46] time out of Revelation chapter 9 verses
[1:52] 1 and 2 and the fifth angel sounded and
[1:58] I saw a star fall from heaven unto the
[2:03] earth and to him was given the key of
[2:08] the bottomless pit and he opened the
[2:11] bottomless pit and there arose out of
[2:16] the pit as the smoke of a great furnace
[2:20] and the Sun and air were darkened by the
[2:27] reason of the smoke of the pit and from
[2:32] the book of Revelation chapter 12 verse
[2:37] 12 therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye
[2:44] that dwell in them woe to the
[2:48] inhabitants of the earth and of the sea
[2:52] for the devil is come down unto you
[2:56] having great wrath because he knoweth
[3:00] that he
[3:03] but a short time friends today I'm going
[3:09] to be brief I'm reaching out and I will
[3:17] not get into anything too doctrinal on
[3:23] Wednesday night at 7:30 teaching will be
[3:28] given for my local church good morning
[3:35] friends I'm pastor John Simon of Good
[3:40] Neighbor ministries of Burlington
[3:43] Ontario just an old-fashioned preacher
[3:47] just trying to be a good neighbor
[3:50] by ministering this sermon this word of
[3:57] warning to help my fellow citizens in
[4:02] knowing what to do and how to live in
[4:07] this dark hour of fear anxiety and
[4:13] crisis our entire world is now under an
[4:19] invasion and we are all now under attack
[4:26] many world leaders have used the phrase
[4:29] we're at war they say it but do not
[4:35] fully understand what kind of war it is
[4:41] our governments are under attack our
[4:47] economic system is stretched to the
[4:51] breaking point our churches and their
[4:55] ministers are even being hindered from
[4:59] their ministry our culture and Wale way
[5:04] of life is under attack we are facing
[5:09] the breakdown of marriages that break
[5:14] down of families
[5:16] and the fabric of our society is
[5:19] straining under pressure now with the
[5:26] presence of this code at 19 every
[5:31] individual is personally under attack
[5:36] your body your mind with fear and worry
[5:42] and your soul with doubt and unbelief we
[5:50] are all experiencing an invasion and
[5:54] some are calling out the army to defend
[6:00] us a good friend of mine told me he saw
[6:05] the tanks rolling into the city armored
[6:09] vehicles great guns many soldiers but we
[6:17] are not fighting an army of tanks bombs
[6:22] and bullets we are under invasion but
[6:28] not by an army of planes or rockets
[6:31] missiles or millions of men I want you
[6:37] to know seriously today folks that as I
[6:42] speak planet Earth is now being invaded
[6:45] by an unseen army and that is my topic
[6:50] here today the invasion of planet Earth
[6:55] [Music]
[6:57] we're experiencing right now a pandemic
[7:00] of biblical proportions
[7:04] in the book of Exodus
[7:07] we are told of a great final horrible
[7:11] plague and we seen and read and heard
[7:19] about the plagues that fell upon that
[7:23] sinful nation of Egypt that was in
[7:28] rebellion against our God Jehovah in my
[7:35] view our present condition we can see is
[7:42] rebellious and that we live on a sinful
[7:47] planet a planet and a world system that
[7:53] is arrogant with its power with its
[7:57] greed and with its selfishness that
[8:02] system is now experiencing somewhat of a
[8:08] biblical plague of viral infestation by
[8:16] unseen armies straight from the pit of
[8:20] hell unseen armies of disease demons
[8:30] evil spirits sin and death it is written
[8:37] in the scriptures for all to read for
[8:42] all the take note Ephesians chapter 6
[8:45] verses 11 to 13 put on the whole armour
[8:52] of God that you may be able to stand
[8:56] against the wiles of the devil for we
[9:01] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[9:07] against principalities
[9:10] against powers against the rulers of the
[9:14] darkness of this world against spiritual
[9:19] wickedness in high places
[9:22] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[9:27] of God that you may be able to stand in
[9:31] the evil day and having done all to
[9:35] stand well the whole armour of God is
[9:38] the whole Word of God it's the whole
[9:42] revelation of God's Word that is our
[9:46] defense that is our great wall of
[9:51] defense that protects us from all the
[9:54] works of Satan and his evil cohorts now
[10:03] let me ask the question what is a virus
[10:06] I added to my computer I checked on
[10:12] Google and here is the answer that I
[10:16] receive biologically of course Google
[10:20] says it's a microscopic parasite
[10:25] predominantly viruses have a reputation
[10:29] for being the cause of contagion spread
[10:34] disease and even death a microscopic
[10:42] infective agent that is able to multiply
[10:48] itself within the living cells of a host
[10:53] that is what is a virus now
[10:59] that's speaking physically biologically
[11:02] now I want to speak digitally as if
[11:06] we're talking about computers but I'm
[11:10] making a spiritual application at the
[11:13] same time it says a computer virus is a
[11:18] piece of code which is capable of
[11:22] copying
[11:23] itself and typically having the effect
[11:28] of corrupting an entire computer system
[11:31] and destroying its data when your
[11:36] computer is under attack do you do the
[11:41] first thing you want to do is to call it
[11:44] Jim
[11:46] and when your mind your body is under
[11:51] attack I'll advise you to do the same
[11:54] thing call a technician call on Jesus
[11:58] Christ call ungodly men ministers of the
[12:03] gospel that can render prayer service
[12:10] healing to you if of course cop
[12:16] I believe doctors and the work they do
[12:21] it's wonderful and it's marvelous they
[12:25] have their place and we as ministers
[12:28] have our place and together we can
[12:32] accomplish much for the glory of God now
[12:37] if you have a computer and it's under
[12:39] attack you also want to depend on your
[12:42] firewall we as Christians we depend on
[12:47] our firewall of the great Holy Spirit of
[12:50] the Living God who puts a wall of fire
[12:54] about us and that's why Christians do
[12:58] not have the spirit of fear but of power
[13:01] and of love and of a sound mind again if
[13:08] your computer is under attack you deploy
[13:12] an antivirus software to search and
[13:16] destroy certainly we ought to ask the
[13:21] great Holy Spirit there's an old song
[13:25] that says search me O God and cleanse my
[13:33] heart today
[13:37] see if there be any wicked way in me
[13:45] amen
[13:46] cleanse me from every sin and set me
[13:51] free that is what we want God to do in
[13:54] our hearts we place in there in the
[13:58] computer a software that will D crap
[14:02] affiant
[14:03] and delete every virus and everything
[14:08] that is corrupting your system and here
[14:12] we want the Holy Spirit to come in our
[14:16] lives to t crappy fire lines from every
[14:21] wrong thing that we have done and with
[14:25] our humility and prayer for forgiveness
[14:30] we would but ask God to delete our sins
[14:34] by placing them in the sea of his
[14:38] forgetfulness as he has said let's ask
[14:43] him to uninstall any program any action
[14:49] in our lives that may open gateways for
[14:53] demons Devils viruses of the spirit
[14:57] world to get into your system now we all
[15:05] know that when physically you our body
[15:11] is under attack you need to get a
[15:15] checkup
[15:16] and if you are suffering right now from
[15:20] an attack of kovat 19 you urgently need
[15:25] to get a checkup spiritually every
[15:32] Christian every believer every person if
[15:37] you're in doubt of your standing with
[15:40] God you need a checkup and
[15:45] right person to check you up is the
[15:48] Blessed holy spirit I will also ask you
[15:52] to trust your doctor to give you the
[15:56] best viral medicines and to help you
[16:02] with your immunity wash your hands a
[16:09] Christian is asked to wash his hundred
[16:12] cleanse your soul in the blood of the
[16:15] Lamb he says and I will pass I will pass
[16:19] over you we are asked also to isolate
[16:23] and socially distance ourselves as
[16:27] advised by the government and our
[16:30] medical authorities certainly we also
[16:36] ought to clean up our surroundings and
[16:39] disinfect roundabouts you
[16:42] and lastly monitor yourself every person
[16:50] should monitor their health to see where
[16:54] it is and at the first sign of an attack
[16:58] take steps to have a recovery by
[17:05] trusting your doctor by going for a
[17:07] check-up by washing your hands by
[17:09] practicing social distancing by cleaning
[17:14] up and monitoring yourself constantly
[17:18] and consistently now the minister I must
[17:24] bring to your attention that we are
[17:27] living in the Generation X Generation X
[17:32] is described as the
[17:44] right so insanity could believer those
[17:52] that they should have a firewall should
[17:58] by taking the Word of God within their
[18:02] heart that is the protection God gave
[18:07] them in the garden but they doubted
[18:13] God's Word they walked away from God's
[18:17] Word ring and terror you know that by
[18:30] placing the Word of God in our hearts as
[18:33] David said that he puts the Word of God
[18:35] in his heart that he will not I and we
[18:42] also ask God to fill us with his blessed
[18:45] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit in us
[18:49] with this baptism of fire of the Holy
[18:53] Spirit he becomes air to fire it certain
[19:01] in the scriptures forsake not the
[19:03] assembling of yourselves together as the
[19:06] manner of some is now a true believer
[19:12] knows they need a personal connection to
[19:16] God you also need a connection to a
[19:22] group you need to be connected to a
[19:27] church or a community of faith somewhere
[19:32] it's alright to believe but you must all
[19:37] wrong
[19:42] a real believer knows they need a
[19:45] god-sent
[19:46] man of God or minister in their life and
[19:53] in these times of natural and spiritual
[19:55] pandemonium and infestation and
[20:01] contagion of sin everyone needs to be in
[20:05] the care of the best doctor there is

[20:13] marvelous and a wonderful doctor I'll
[20:16] give you his name and I trust that you
[20:20] rush to him run to him as quickly as you
[20:26] can

[20:38] the very best doctor for your soul mind
[20:42] and body yes let me repeat his name is
[20:48] Jesus and it is on public record that

[24:33] there's an old song that says and I'll
[24:37] try to sing it the best I can as I said
[24:40] I'm an old fashioned preacher my voice
[24:43] cracks if it doesn't sound professional
[24:46] that's wonderful I just love the Lord
[24:49] and I love to preach pray and sing for
[24:53] his glory he for our transgressions he
[25:02] was bruised for our iniquities surely
[25:09] bore all of our sorrows and by His
[25:17] stripes we are healed if you can believe
[25:23] God right now be healed in the name of
[25:29] Jesus Christ friends in the midst of
[25:36] this vision of planet Earth by Satan
[25:38] spirits of disease wickedness lies and
[25:42] licentiousness let us remember the
[25:48] lessons of Pearl Harbor as you know
[25:52] Pearl Harbor was under attack by
[25:59] Imperial Japan they were attacking the
[26:07] American naval base in Hawaii
[26:15] was about 8 a.m. on Sunday morning
[26:19] December 7 1941 now listen and pay
[26:28] attention to this this impending pawn to
[26:35] US forces they were warned about the
[26:38] enemy and that the enemy was planning to
[26:42] invade but they ignored the warning I
[26:48] hope you do not ignore God's warning
[26:53] they knew the enemy was assembling ships
[26:58] planes men and munitions but yet they
[27:04] sat there ripe for invasion why they
[27:11] ignored the warning and so is it today
[27:16] churches are ignoring the warning the
[27:20] peoples of the earth have been
[27:22] repeatedly warned of the coming of
[27:26] plagues and of coming judgement and a
[27:30] world to come
[27:34] planet Earth was warned by many sermons
[27:38] of God throughout the centuries but they
[27:43] ignored the warnings many even laughed
[27:47] at men of God burnt them at the stake
[27:54] boiled them in oil court drawn court to
[27:59] them call them all manner of names some
[28:07] have said nonsense
[28:11] you're just a gloom and doom preacher
[28:15] some have even said you're mad but on
[28:26] on Pearl Harbor it is said they had a
[28:29] big dance party and I believe that's the
[28:32] way this world is going now stumbling on
[28:36] a drunken state in a drunken party
[28:41] attitude enjoying itself
[28:44] let's lift a day for tomorrow we die
[28:47] with no thought that after death there
[28:51] comes a judgement from the presence of
[28:54] Almighty God military officers were busy
[29:00] giving passes for members of the
[29:03] military to attend this great marvelous
[29:08] dance as they thought which trucks were
[29:12] rolling in I can see them filled with
[29:15] beer and wine and all manner of spirits
[29:21] for that party for they were going to
[29:24] have a wonderful time in in their view
[29:28] that was life that was real living
[29:33] meanwhile the enemy fleet was drawing
[29:38] closer and closer danger was at the door
[29:46] sin was at the door plagues was at the
[29:49] door
[29:50] sickness was at the door death was at
[29:54] the door but they failed to heed the
[29:58] warning anyone who tried to warn them as
[30:03] I'm trying to warn you were mocked you
[30:07] were laughed at as us in our modern day
[30:10] jokes about preachers on the on the TV
[30:16] or on radio oh that preacher was
[30:18] preaching about the end of the world
[30:20] about plagues and and prophecies and all
[30:25] these things but friends though they
[30:29] prophecy waits and delays it shall come
[30:35] to pass according to the Word of God
[30:37] heaven
[30:38] earth will pass away but my word will
[30:42] never pass away you gloom and doom old
[30:48] fashioned preacher you you may not say
[30:51] it but you may think it but one night on
[30:56] that night before the attack on Pearl
[31:01] Harbor my friends as I said they partied
[31:08] all night they accused the preacher of
[31:13] fear-mongering the next morning when the
[31:18] alarm was given most were found in a
[31:22] drunken stupor others were fast asleep
[31:27] and so could not answer the call because
[31:35] they fail to heed the warning and so it
[31:39] is at the coming of the Lord over two
[31:45] thousand years ago Jesus already
[31:49] prophesied and said what would happen
[31:51] here are its words for nation shall rise
[31:56] against nation this is 2000 years ago
[32:03] and Kingdom against Kingdom and there
[32:08] shall be famines and pestilences and
[32:14] earthquakes in diverse places all these
[32:20] are the beginning of Sorrows in ordinary
[32:28] language it's of the coming of the
[32:37] itself its face these are just signs not
[32:44] a of the Tribulation Period
[32:53] Matthew 22 8 he also said as it was in
[33:02] the days of Noah so shall it be also in
[33:07] the days of the Son of Man they did eat
[33:11] they drank they married weddings they
[33:14] were given in marriage until the day
[33:17] that Noah entered into the ark just as
[33:21] are they eating drinking partying
[33:25] womanizing having a great time while
[33:29] danger is at the door
[33:32] invasion is upon us that devil is upon
[33:36] you sickness is upon you sorrow trouble
[33:39] nervous tension is upon you heart heart
[33:43] attacks at a higher rate than ever
[33:46] before anxiety mental problems
[33:49] everything is upon us at this time the
[33:53] Bible tells us likewise also was it in
[33:57] the days of God they did eat they drank
[34:01] they bought they sold they planted they
[34:07] builded see they were caught up with
[34:09] business they occupied have no time for
[34:12] God when he says even the wealth you
[34:15] have I give you the power to get wealth
[34:19] and he says if I give it I can also take
[34:22] it away heed the warning lest you fall
[34:26] in the hands of an angry god but the
[34:30] same day that lot went out of Sodom it
[34:35] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[34:38] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[34:44] it be in the day when the Son of Man is
[34:49] revealed I believe that is this day I
[34:55] believe that is this hour at any moment
[35:01] our Lord Jesus can come
[35:05] at any moment that Saints of the Living
[35:08] God can be raptured out of here

[39:14] of the country and we've just returned
[39:17] it is imperative and important that we
[39:21] heed the warning
[39:26] your health and your salvation of course
[39:31] is an individual affair you may say to
[39:38] me well pastor Simon mind your business
[39:41] well my business is really God's
[39:45] business and I'm about my father's
[39:47] business I'm part of the company of God
[39:51] and sons and that is why I'm here
[39:54] speaking to you and with you here today
[39:59] in these troublesome and dangerous times
[40:04] it is shocking to me to realize that
[40:09] there are some who still believe that
[40:14] this is all a joke this is all a
[40:17] conspiracy but regardless of what
[40:25] conspiracy theories you may hear all the
[40:31] jokes and making light of the directives
[40:36] you've received spiritually about the
[40:41] Word of God and the warnings out of
[40:44] God's Word I want to encourage you here
[40:48] today heed the warning but naturally and
[40:55] spiritually take the test get yourself
[41:00] treated immediately most of all get the
[41:06] vaccine as soon as it is available but
[41:11] spiritually I want you to know that the
[41:15] vaccine for sin has always been
[41:17] available and it's available for anyone
[41:21] who wants it and you can have it now
[41:26] just ask God to forgive you of your sins
[41:30] repent and be baptized in the name of
[41:35] Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your
[41:37] sins and
[41:39] he will baptize you and give you the
[41:42] presence of the Holy Spirit within your
[41:46] life again I refer to another well-known
[41:54] song there is a fountain filled with
[42:01] blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins where
[42:09] sinners plunged beneath that flood lose
[42:14] all their guilty stains may you lose all
[42:23] your virus symptoms right now even while
[42:28] you are listening to me in the name of
[42:30] Jesus Christ and may you also lose all
[42:37] your sin stains that have stained and
[42:42] sullied your life leave your past behind
[42:47] you're a better person than you think
[42:51] you are god bless you all today I'm
[42:54] Pastor John P Simon and this life stream
[42:58] is brought to you sponsored by good
