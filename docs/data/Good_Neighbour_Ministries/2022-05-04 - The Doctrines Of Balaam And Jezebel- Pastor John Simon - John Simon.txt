truth bring forth the word to your people lord not never rejoice and be so thankful for what you have given to us lord for this we ask in jesus name amen and amen praise god god bless you i'm so thankful for this message and especially when i have an opportunity to compare it with something else which i i had you know just uh yesterday and oh my it's just so different and i'm so thankful to god that he brought me in praise the lord into his word and his promise for this day revelation 2 14 but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed onto idols and to commit fornication so as thou them so has thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nickelodeons which thing i hate verse 20 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou hast thou sufferest that woman jezebel which call it herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols praise god the topic tonight is the doctrines of balaam and of jezebel right for god bless you please be seated and let us put our hearts place our hearts inside of this word of god of course you know out of numbers 22 how the story of balaam how that um balak who was the king you see israel had just conquered um uh and uh the king of baitian it conquered them and he knew that his nation his lands were next in line so he was waiting for that attack but he realized how that israel had driven these other nations that were bigger and greater than his and taken over their territory so he knew that he couldn't withstand them with just with his army alone so uh he didn't go to other kings around to ask their help you see he sought for spiritual help which he already sought and knew in his mind is greater than having all the armies that you can go in the neighborhood and and pay or whatever to come but instead of paying armies mercenaries to come and fight for him he told his servants take the price or the reward you will find the word rewards of divination to balaam and ask him to come down and see me and talk with me to have a conversation and they brought the money and gifts to balaam once you know you ask god shall i go up god says no you know they come back with more they raise the stakes you know he i go back to god and says god should i really not go that says no don't go and the king says uh to his servants you can read that scripture you know you can give him houses of gold in other words pilot as much as he wants and as long as he comes down to see me to have these discussions of what to do to stop these people who are covering the land and taking it over and balaam went back to god and says god shall i go up and see uh balak and talk with him and god says yes go go and as i was reading this i noticed something the bible says and balaam then decide then then gotten this donkey to go up and the scripture says but the lord was angry with him after he had just told him you can go up but the bible says the lord was angry with him amen why because he wasn't going into the will of god he was going in the permissive will of god right god permitted him to go but that was only his permissive will so there's a lesson there to be learned his desire of his heart was for the money what's for the wealth what's for the fame was for the name was for the association with great king and so he overruled god's word with the desire of his heart and we got to be watchful that we don't do the same thing you see pentecost made the same mistake the desire their heart was more the towns more than to have the real holy spirit that would be correcting them and it's proven because a prophet has come with the genuine holy spirit the power of god the the gifts of the spirit that they're talking about he was manifesting miles above them are everywhere i read somewhere where they said what these evangelists would uh have uh two three or ten this man would have thousands of miracles in one night some of them not right in front of him he doesn't have to be there right praise god people coming off trains to the meeting they're healed people come to the hotel before they could go out the heel they delivered praise god uh supernatural god was moving in that way praise the lord listen when we come to church like this you've got to realize whether there is a thousand ten or five of us hallelujah there's a person here who who we are serving and we're worshiping you're not seeing him but he is here the living god amen we talking about the pillar of fire pillar fire until it becomes like an imagination and just a talking but let me tell you my god is real i said he's real praise god not only because i read it in the bible seeing the picture on the over the prophet's head but as a young man i've literally seen it amen and watch it go up into the heavens oh praise god let me tell you we're not walking following something that's imagination we're not following something that's a fantasy or some religious illusion we are believing and following something that will lead us from art to glory or from the grave to glory if you will believe this promise of this word of god hallelujah i'm getting a little excited here oh praise god hallelujah but you see this king was having problems with his kingdom and balaam's help was just a maneuver for expediency to help him out to retain or maintain his power and so you know there balaam went up and gave advice that that you know upset the israel and their way of life and worship over and it was such a simple advice he gave to them why don't we just go over and talk with balak you know when you talk with somebody you sit down uh you know you have a nice meal and over that meal you have a conversation and you talk somewhere you can come to an understanding that's human understanding but you can come to an understanding and the relationship will not be so acrimonious it would be bad it will it will actually get better amen praise god hallelujah praise god and that's where ah he encouraged them to iron out their differences and to get over it and then you'll understand one another praise god and once you do that then you can accomplish things great things together by working together you can accomplish great things and then the next step was to seduce them into worshipping get into worship along with balak and so the same thing happened with the church in the new testament exactly the same thing but this time it wasn't balak of the old testament it was constant time of rome in our times that had the same problem he was having problems with his empire the roman empire and his stand was a bit shaky so he needs some propping up he needed some help something that will invigorate and inspire his people like that amen so not to sing in his empire outside of the vision of the cross and all of that he had that but the fact is he noticed that the christians were growing in number growing greatly in number so any politician you know that they deal with numbers and when you see those numbers well if i get these numbers on my side and i get this other coalition on my side and i get that together two and two makes four and then i would win right i would remain emperor so he decided that he was going to court the the the christians right well he approached the nominal christians and there it was to secure his kingdom he had a great talk with them and invited them to all come and that was what we know as the nicean council of 325 a.d that was the invitation and that was a purpose that was his scheme that he had in his mind we are talking about it now but back then uh you know the christians couldn't see that we are now talking about it but this was his scheme showing that the same spirit that was there with me luck and balaam is the same spirit that came back and was with him using him in the same manner to let them come together so as you can see here uh my brothers that all the christians came up to the meeting bought the true vine and the false vine because nobody knew what was going to come out of it but as the meeting went on the true believers uh begin to pull out uh they start staying away from it they just move out from the meetings they didn't want to have anything to do with it because after the argumentation with athanasius and the other fellow that was there representing the false vine for hours debating and talking about the word of god they realized that this was just like to them a waste of time and and plus they they were being attacked also secretly before they even got to the meeting by the false vine and so it was a dangerous situation to be in right so my brothers um the ones that remained in the meeting he offered them monies from the state treasuries the state will provide funds for you to build uh churches that's how cathedrals start being built right with the state money that he started give giving out to them and along with the uh monies from the treasury uh you will have recognition with me personally politically oh my those men were so proud and you will also have the power of my entire army behind you anything to do with the church so he gave them political power he gave them backing with military power he gave them backing with money or financial power and therefore the nominal church grew and he began to introduce through this nominal church now which we will go back over that how all those old roman rituals and things they have which were actually the religion the babylonian religion that had come that far which we taught on before but then they switched everything over they start switching the names and switching the everything over the other way no so he allowed the church now to begin to introduce to the people all these babylonian teachings which to cook here he introduced the people to idol worship and spiritism for statues with the names of saints dead saints placed in the buildings and the people were taught by the priests to commune that way with the dead right not realizing that there were actually committing what the bible says called necromancy they were committing spiritual necromancy praying to the dead like some nations some people pray to their ancestors right but here they were actually praying to so-called saints people maybe some were true some were not that lived holy lives and they respected them and loved them and and and they began to tell them that these people can help them even though they're dead and so they introduced them to spiritism you see just the pause here really uh just as in africa you got all the masks and things it's this it's the vision that the which doctor saw of that spirit that spoke to him that he actually gets them to carve out the face of the thing and then the person takes it and they don't know there's a spirit back of that there's a life that is back of that right and that is why when they're dancing around it doesn't mean not just africa all over the world it is a similar thing the influence is the same that that witch doctor or priest will put on the mask when he is going to dance or he's going to commit something because it is calling that spirit to come on him that he saw in his visions right like that okay and so they taught the people to pray to the saints which is nothing less than spiritism and you know the bible tells us the food we need is the word of god the word of god is our spiritual food praise god hallelujah but they uh they changed the diet and that the diet was changed to litanies and rituals and creeds that they started to come forth with all these great bishops and great men begin to produce their own writings and place them there and they start to slowly insert or insinuate those words in the common belief so that they can seduce the minds of the people away from the written word of god hallelujah yes that was their their dogmas and their creeds and saw one god then they slowly introduce three gods that are one so we're not saying nothing against you having one god but really the one god is three persons and they slip that in on the people amen like that right so here it goes they bring brought in that compound name they call it uh you know father son holy ghost and then my friends water baptism the genuine one gave way once they changed that one god to three then now they got so-called three names and they that's the way they introduced them to pagan warship right of venus zeus right astarte they they introduced them like that a gentle slow coming slip over right to that kind of worship but not the real believers they move out to that meeting they wouldn't go they wouldn't have anything to do with it and those that went came out of there and they had lost much of the truth roots of god's word already and from that time they began to lose uh the clear understanding of the one god and of the godhead now what i was just talking about you can see that that shows how satan was looking to dilute and to create chaos and confusion in what the people were believing because he throughout so many propagandas and unbelief and stuff like that now and we see the power of propaganda and lies what it's doing in the world right now so you understand me what i'm trying to tell you because the same principles they're using tell a lie over and over and over again and and get the people to believe that lie and all of a sudden to them that lie becomes the truth you see oh my there it goes my friends so now we find out let's consider this doctrine of balaam and his deliberate uh maneuver to influence the people to change the way their way of faith and from faith to unbelief i quote brother branham the nicolaitan doctrine you see was the corruption of the clergy and by the corruption of the clergy as they sought political power among themselves they were corrupted because they were looking for that among themselves one want to be higher than the other one wants to be in a bigger position of that nature right so see my you see but balaamism now nicoletian's ism corruption of the clergy balaamism is corruption and subjection of the people to their system of creeds their way of worship and by that they wanted to desire to hold them right so they wanted to bind the people with unseen chains of the mind so they brought it in that way oh the church looks so nice and nice stained glass windows beautiful doors brass gold everywhere and carpets everything but it's a prison house prophet said house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ her gates are the gates of hell oh my yes brothers hallelujah my god hallelujah so what bound the people in the church the constant drumming of the litanies the creeds the the whether it was latin or whatever they were singing and speaking they kept drumming it away from them since their children until they get old and it bound their minds it bound their hearts right like that see and that's what bound the people prophet asked it here what was it that bound the people to that nominal church what is this that destroyed them it was their creeds it was their dogmas and their dogmas were formed into tenants and those tenants are now the doctrine of the roman catholic church they were not given given they were not giving the people true food the word no sir they were giving them food offered to idols amen see there were giving them babylonian paganism wrapped up in christian terminology amen see that very spirit and doctrine is right now here amongst all the protestants here today and we call the name of that spirit denomination i usually say demon nations but uh you know it's not far from what is being sent forth here praise god hallelujah remember nicolasianism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church and by doing that they depose the holy spirit you put up a pope and you bring down the holy spirit you put up some other great name and you bring down the holy spirit for the prophet says the moment you humanize the leadership and you put that up he says you depose the holy spirit out of his position right bala mission now is not just organization it is denominationalism amen praise god because you got organization and business that's a principle all right that's there but denomination that's a real spiritual grip on a person's mind and a heart that they're out for right which takes the church instead of the bible is that the truth in other words he's trying to say they believe the church more than they believe the bible you go right now when you tell people some of the words here they'll tell you what my church says is that right that is a way of telling you that take the word of the church above the bible in their minds the church has more credibility than the bible does they'll even argue with you and say oh there's mistakes in the bible man wrote the bible and whatever else but the church says the church says his holiness so-called self and so on like that and they will try to dismiss the word of god hallelujah oh my think of it right the hour uh you see and right at this very hour now our day now brother brandon is speaking of many of god's people are still caught in the snare of the nominationalism and god is crying to them come out hallelujah of her my people lest you be partakers of our sins and that you receive not her place amen you see a lot of the people are in there and he says it here because they are ignorant they were not aware but sadly he continues on and i'm just speaking what he's saying here he says no plea of ignorance it's gonna make carry any effect or leniency in god's appeal court you can't go saying you were ignorant you had the bible even if they wouldn't tell you read your bible amen hallelujah praise god amen my my parents weren't church goers they were just reading the bible and the bible will speak to you it will reveal itself to you if you have a sincere heart and you are one of god's own he'll make himself known to you the word will begin to unfold hallelujah and you'll be seeing god hide in his word blessed be the name of the lord amen so we see nicoletanism clergy balaamism organization hallelujah i want you to understand i am not against the people what i am against he says is against that system and that's what we are against is the system and not against the people they're good people there's a lot of nice people wonderful people just don't let that seduce you to believe what like they believe that's all the difference is but you're against the system that is controlling them praise god behind the scenes hallelujah see with that kind of a state and church union the devil already had that principle way back is showing in the dark ages so when they do it now it's nothing new they're doing you can see it coming from on hundreds of years ago that is coming right it's been set for the dark ages and for a thousand years the church went into the depths of darkness knowing the depths of satan and when any religious believing people would embrace both nicholatism and balaamism and then are awkward political financial and physical power you see the same kind of atmosphere begins to come back again because all the elements of the cake you know are mixed together correctly right so once that happens again uh then you see the next direction is only one they can go and the next direction is in the direction of the doctrine of jezebel nickelodeonism balaamism and jezebel right history doctrines actually here at the outlying review actually an outline identifying back to us right these three doctrines are dangerous triple spirits back of these doctrines bringing a trinity of satan bringing the church into the depths of satan right here right remember this woman jesse bell was a sidonian she wasn't a jew daughter of abbay al king priest astante and he was a murderer see the woman married ahab king of israel for political purposes right then she took over the religion of the people and began to murder the preachers the levites and erected her own temples wherein she caused the people to worship venus who is astarte and baal the prophet here has who's the sun god and that's why you see the sun burst is always there people don't know it but you go and you see it always in the churches there like that that's what it really is okay of course if you said that even though one of their people standing right there they'll turn and say oh oh no come on don't become superstitious and all like that but really back of it all is the worship of baal right they're worshiping the devil and they don't know it amen they're being the temple of god as the bible tells us and thinking they're worshiping god and they're really worshipping the devil amen now notice what this jezebel spirit did what is her teaching what what does she do she first of all taught the priests her own teachings of what she said brother brandon puts it this way she formulated her own teachings and made the her priests her priests which means she's the one that made them priests they owing her their credibility their loyalty is to her and she made her priests teach her teaching and they in turn made or influenced the people to accept it now this is it this is what's going on even today right this is going on today got that same spirit is here oh praise god see oh my there you see is exactly what the nominal church was in the dark ages that's what's come back now they left the word of god entirely see for names and titles of the godhead rather than the real one name they exchange it for uh the word that what came to me when i was you know going that day was empty names right empty names right father son holy ghost empty names demons don't even respect that they won't even listen to that brother branham said when he was going to cast out the devil he said let me see and he says in the name of the father and the son of the holy ghost come out of him the devil laughed the devil wouldn't move right he says in the name of jesus christ out he goes amen power in the name of jesus hallelujah the others like that empty names oh and they're not even names titles they call them names right now remember see that left the word of god except for titles and a few scriptural principles they twisted what they did and took things out of the bible by changing its meaning amen see the college of bishops wrote vast treaties and their popes wrote you know we know some of the words encyclials and bulls they wrote them and they cleared themselves to be infallible now the infallible who's involved is god invaluable anymore but or anyway and began to claim that they were receiving revelation from god and they are speaking for god to the people all this was taught to the priests and brought fear made by fear made the people the believer that god was the one talking and saw the people were scared and fearful i don't know about you but since a child when i was going to the catholic saint aloysius boy school and going to attend the services i would go into the cathedral and i i i would feel so fearful and the things that i would smell and sense but i didn't know what it was then but my my mind such fear would be upon you because what it was nothing but a horse of hell nothing but legions of demons that were all around clouds of darkness were everywhere brother sister oh my think about it see this is what no watch here there were my friends that no extermination has become much worse than death in the minds of the people amen and the voice of the church he says here took over rather than the voice of god the voice you see he's going back now because spiritually that's what happened with jezebel and ahab after a while the soldiers the politicians they respected the words of jezebel and the commands of jezebel and they listen to her more than they listen to the king they have after a while the king had to go to her and saying i want that lion she said you call yourself a king and a man and you can't take the land from the boat let me get it for you and you know the rest of the story right that took place right there and then hallelujah but thank god he was god was faithful to his little flock in spite of what rome did to their bodies martyred killed murdered thousands millions of them but god will never forsake his own god will always be with his people oh praise god hallelujah i'm so thankful that we as they are surrounded by those devils and demons and clouds of darkness we are surrounded by the angels of light we are surrounded by the holy ghost amen we are surrounded by the anointing of the holy spirit praise god with us in us over us all through us hallelujah and i'm thankful of god for that amen oh blessed assurance jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine heirs of salvation oh my god purchased by god hallelujah himself oh glory to god amen oh the god was faithful to his little flock in spite of what rome might do have done to their bodies but rome could not kill that spirit that was living within them praise god hallelujah and rome can't do it with you or with me or anyone else that has the holy spirit within their lives hallelujah in the light of truth shun threw them back by the holy ghost and the power of god amen think of it deeds and doctrines of the nicolasians doctrine of balaam then the doctrine of the false prophetess jezebel these do not constitute three spirits or make spirit three spiritual principles these are three manifestations of the same spirit going from depth to depth taking them deeper and deeper into darkness and mire and death it is the antichrist spirit of organization in its three in its various stages and once the clergy separated themselves organized themselves and began to oppress the people by leading them into the organization binding them to the organization see the organization of course was based on queens based on dogmas and they taught the people that instead of the pure word of god hallelujah brother sister we are blessed i am thankful to god you know i sat and i was sitting there thinking the prophet left spoken word books some people may take them and throw them in the garbage believe some believers will take them leave them on the shelf the prophet is gone now the message moved to another realm some people may not even be reading their books anymore and i mean listen to the tapes anymore praise god while others who've really seen the light that thing has so gripped their heart they can't even they can't even stop reading it they can't stop seeing god they can't stop seeing him wherever they go whatever they look whatever they hear they're seeing god everywhere hallelujah and that's what happens when the word of god really gets a hold of you your body getting old what does that mean that would mean a thing the inward man is being renewed day by day paul said hallelujah praise god amen i'm so glad i'm so thankful praise god because in any case like paul said so if we drop this or what if this body in my body outward body be dissolved we have another one waiting praise god amen accent from the body present with the lord lord of god hallelujah amen oh my my my praise god hallelujah how wonderful to know that he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah so instead of the pure word of god they taught the people creeds and dogmas and rituals and ceremonies you know rituals and ceremonies can become habitual and habits can bind you you know that if you have a bad habit you don't know it's go it can't bind you oh i can stop smoking whenever i want oh i can stop using these drugs and then when they try to stop then they realize that the hobbit has bound them well it's that same thing they're doing with the ritual the creeds and the darkness but by this just saying it with religious terminologies over the pulpits and talking like that the people who think it's they're blessed they're being blessed they're not realizing they're being cursed they're they don't realizing what they're happening they're being imprisoned their minds are being imprisoned with bands not of steel but of demonic power spiritism they're being bound in every possible way amen see because what now that whole system right and their ceremonies their way of worship the whole system was a militant and diabolical power and it does its best to control all around it through persuasion of discourse the simple oh he's just talking he's just having a discourse but that is planting seeds in the hearts and the minds of those who are hearing it amen now of course you watch the word militant the prophet used there you understand where he's going back to he's going right back to nimrod because nimrod is the one that started to organize people into groups and armies with the intention of taking over other nations right not one of these churches out there not happy if the other one break up and then and they take them over every one of them they're gonna say oh oh we're not but they're happy so that they can conquer another nation or denomination right oh my there it is now it was antichrist then and it is antichrist now absolutely see he came in christ's name prophet said i put the word he operated in christ's name right they're operating under the guise that they're christian and this is christ and the work of christ praise god i'm going to wind this up just now okay praise the lord hallelujah praise god now it seems my friends by no stretch of the imagination could god be in such teachings of the roman catholic church and i'm quoting here directly from the church ages he says no way for the by their teachings and by their conduct god could not in any way possible could not place anything in their teaching in color these protests were disregarded and they died from failure to arouse anybody's attention this is doing the same thing today oh so many people die in the school over there so many of this happened over there this happened over there and it's just like water's falling from a duck's back thousands of years hundreds of years have passed and nobody is doing anything or it seems like they can't do anything whatsoever like that right oh my see but then thank god god in his sovereign grace when it seems like all was lost sent a messenger by the name of martin luther and started the reformation and it worked on the climate of the catholic church because the catholic church he said she started getting full of herself and of our power that he says [Music] the church had been given so much rope that she was about to hung herself with it they had so much freedom so much money so much power so much liberty right and it was in that climate and atmosphere that luther preached justification by faith amen the true vine for the first time in many centuries began to grow again in bountiful manner as the nominal church had used state power to back themselves up the very state that was for them began to go against them oh my and this is where martin luther at that time began to gain power and then he made his mistake listen to it two minutes and i'll be finished here see his mistake was that him and the believers that were with him they accepted state subsidy just like the false buying was getting money to build churches now that they uh constantine turn against them he just take the money that was going to the one side and put it on the other side right and they did not refuse it and look to god but they accepted the thinking it's a blessing it was not a blessing it was a curse to the church at that time and so they allowed the state to subsidize them and so you see this age did not launch out too far or too deep into the word right that they had but thank god that it even went as far as it did under those that claim it and conditions right because it leaned on political power by accepting those subsidies it leaned on political power rather than leaning on the arm of god right praise god hallelujah see and looters the very group that in luther's generation that had broken from the false vine now began to slowly turn right back to become daughters of the harlot for she went right into nicolithianism balaamism and jezebel religion and that is what we see here today hallelujah though they had many factions fighting among themselves for precedence and power amen but how far were they from the true seed of god far away from the true seed of god they persecuted each other even under death in many cases in

in our age amen hallelujah fear not little flock it is my father's pleasure to give you a king the kingdom may the lord bless you on this talk of the doctrines of balaam and jezebel may the lord bless
