TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus, it won't be long with these things going on. The rapture is around the corner. Amen. Even if it terrorists, we are going to the sixth dimension. We are going to meet our loved ones when the time comes for God to call us. But with the modern events with this pope from America and all the scriptures as we read over here so many scriptures were fulfilled on one day when the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified. So don't let anybody put this in future for you. Anything all things can happen like with just like pimp p then we gone in a twinkle of an eye. We're going to be with the Lord. Amen. We shall be changed one of these days. As Sarah was changed to be a young lady before she received that promised child. So we going to be changed one of these days to receive our rapture. Amen. We are going to fulfill that rapture. We are the last one fulfill the rapture. Amen. Hallelujah. It's never happened before of the group of people. Yes, it took place with Elijah. It took place with Enoch. But it never happen with a whole bunch of people going one at one time. But it's going to happen. There is a meeting going on in the air in the street by me. Going to meet him in the air. Brothers, I will meet you over on the other side. Amen. Our God is awesome. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; One of these days, all the sorrow will end. Hallelujah. One of these days, brother Brian, all the gray hair will go back. You're going to be like a 21 year old boy. Amen. Enjoy the presence of God. Amen. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; Sooner, very soon, you're going to see our king. &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder that black mind that talk about he said that I don't want no crowns. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I just want to see his face. &gt;&gt; Amen. 24 hours. The one that we love, &gt;&gt; the one that we've been praying, the one that we cherish. &gt;&gt; One of these days you're going to see him face to face. Oh man, also be God. Hallelujah. We are blessed people. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Our God is good. He hasn't changed and he will never change. Whatever he did back then, he's doing the same thing in our lives because it's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is this gospel real to you? &gt;&gt; Is it real to you, brothers and sisters? Yes. Amen. If it's real to you, then you have met God on the back side of the desert. Amen. Because when it becomes real to you, you can't stop. But talk about him. Let's talk about Jesus. 24 hours. He's the king of kings. Amen. He's the rose of Sharon, Lily of Valley. Amen. Oh, if our conversation, everything should be centered around him. And sometimes you know why some people can't stand you, it's not your fault. Because all your conversation when you talk to them for a long time, it brings back the word. You talk with them, you talk them for long unconsciously something you bring back some of the word and the people that fifth dimension them they hate it and there sometimes I have some friends that old friends try to talk to them because like when the gospel first comes to you bum bum you want to let everybody knows but as as you matured you project grace. Yes. &gt;&gt; So we I never in my heart when I say anything about gospel to them just talk about normal things basketball but because there's something in the believer you talk talk talk talk talk you by time you catch yourself something of the scriptures comes in and something rise up in them and they fighting it &gt;&gt; but it's not your fault. So you are not the one going to separate yourself from anybody. The word of God that's the separation. So you don't have to worry. Just be pleasant. Be simple and live a Christian life. Everything will fall in place. And one other thing to listen to your thoughts because it's a voice of God to you. If you miss it, you miss a lot of things. God speaks in a little so small voice. Some people when they pray, they only want to do the talking. They pray. They don't relax and let God speak back to them because it's not a one-way prayer. There have to be a relationship. Give me an opportunity to talk back to you in the cool of the evening. Because remember Elijah when the wind the thunder that was in him so many things but he came in a little still small voice that same God is here today he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed amen praise God and one more other story about the reality of the Lord Jesus Christ about the story that Abraham gave about birth his friend &gt;&gt; who was a wicked h said he has like a lizard eye and then when they went for the fishing no for the for the hunting he just to get the phones to kill them and one thing that really um touched my heart over the weekend when I listened to that queen of Sheba was the love &gt;&gt; that that mother dear project. &gt;&gt; She was willing to give her life. That deer realized that her life was at danger, but she don't she didn't care. She was willing to die. And because of that love of God, the love that she projected, it brought God down. In that mind bullet could not what could not work. And he saw the reality of God. And when God becomes red to you like that, &gt;&gt; nobody will tell you to serve him. And as a Christians sometimes God has to come and give us a flash of those reality of him that give us a faith to move on to push on to press on because you need those experiences. You need to have that encounter with God. It helped Moses. It helped Paul. They were never the same. know that Abraham said you have to meet God face to face like those people met him before you can even preach because those encounter it helps you and encourages you like if God put some thought in your heart and you see it manifest one time and then he give you another one it manifest the second time it keep on manifesting what does it do to you it gives you courage it gives you encouragement to trust that voice &gt;&gt; because you know that voice that speak to you, that voice will never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the reality of the word of God &gt;&gt; become so real to you. You know he's with you. His presence is with you. So he gives you what? The reality of the word of the living God. And if God let you pray for somebody, the person get healed. You pray for the next one, you get healed. You pray for situation. What does it do? It gives you encouragement &gt;&gt; to be able to step on and do that. But the problem of it is some people will not even make an attempt &gt;&gt; to try. &gt;&gt; You got to try. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And one thing that we have to realize, you are not God. I am not God. He's a sovereign God. He does what he wants. So when you pray for the situation, it's not you obligated to raise that person. You are not obligated to bring the thing to pass. He is obligated to bring what he wants to bring to pass. He's obligated to answer what he wants to answer. He obligated to do what he has to do because he's a sovereign God. So if you pray for somebody once and it doesn't happen, it doesn't mean that you should stop because that thing pastor Mo used to say never what give up. You got to keep on doing it. &gt;&gt; Doing your best and God will take care of the situation because it's a sovereign God. And even in our normal lives when you ask God for something I always say it because the life here is too fast. Even my children they want this daddy we want it now. &gt;&gt; But God doesn't operate in that. He want us to have patience at the right time. He will make it clear. He'll bring it to pass. You can't force God. You can't tell him what to do. You can just bring your petition with faith believing it will come to pass. And every prayer God answers. Sometimes is wait a little a little bit. Sometimes is yes right away. Sometimes it's no. But whenever as a true Christian, whatever God's perfect will is, we want that to be what? To be there in our lives. &gt;&gt; Even though true sunshine or rain, whatever, whatever it takes to please God, that's what I'm willing to do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'll trade sunshine for rain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll trade sunshine for rain. If that is his will, I'm willing because life is short. You here today, you gone tomorrow. I think it brings me to this thing that I want to read. Let me see this. I came across something like that here. Um, that's fine. That's okay. Does a place that That's okay. I don't have it. But there's a place that you are saying that life is short. &gt;&gt; You cannot even say you got to tomorrow be tomorrow is for you. Anything can happen at any time. &gt;&gt; So we got to be ready and just serve God the best that we know how because tomorrow is not for you. We all know what happened to our precious brother Kufi on that night. If it was his time, he would have gone just like that 2:00 a.m. in the morning. So tomorrow is not for you, it's not for me. So we got to be ready every time. We have to have spirit of forgiveness. Never hold anything or hurt against anybody regardless of the situation. Let love project and grace will takes over because you are there to receive this word of God. Amen. Our God is awesome. And then if you carry back, you carry the thought from Jesus Christ from the time of Paul, the church went into what? um dark ages and in those dark ages the Catholic Church they kill 68 millions those is in first book of Matus and Inquisition Spanish Inquisition and all those places they murdered 68 million Christians who do not believe Catholic teachings which was contrary the word of God. So the church went what like in the dark ages but the Bible said that whatever the caterpillar has eaten the can has I will restored say the Lord. So during the restoration time, God raised up Luther and he was revealed to him that the just shall live by faith. And at that time, those attribute of God, those children of God who were ordained to life, they received what Luther said. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They came out from the Catholic Church, received the word that came through Luther. &gt;&gt; Yes. And the gospel move on to who? Wesley sanctification. You got to live a sanctified life. Then it's preach to get rid of all the lipstick and all the immoral dressing and everything and be sanctified. Lead that clean life. And at that time those who are ordained to life, they followed that voice. And then it came to Pentecost, restoration of what? Of the gift. And they began to speak in tongues this that that and then they made the speaking in tones as the evidence of the Holy Ghost. But the Bible, the Bible didn't say the speaking in tones is the evidence. It's a gift of the Holy Ghost. So the gospel has to move and God sent us a vindicated prophet William Myron Braham. He fulfilled Malachi 4:5, Revelation 10:7, Amos 3:7, um Luke 17:30, so many scriptures. And what happened? Because the people at his time, those who were not ordained to life, they love the part of the healing. When he was sending the people to their churches, they were so happy receiving them. But when it came to the revealing of the word, when the seas were open, when he began to tell them that women should not preach, you have to have um a deacon should be a man of wine wife trying to set the church in order. Talking about the serpent seed, not apple, it was an adultery that caused the fall of man. He began to tell all the gospel truth. They began to get away from him. And when the final thing happened, the revelation of the seven seals. When the seven angels caught him up in the constellation to bring the seals, that was his third pool ministry. They didn't want nothing to do with him. But that was a crowning of his ministry. Amen. Ended. The sins were revealed. And it's been open from that time. Christ came down the sin. Christ has come down. He is the capstone the reveal that seven seals. Amen. And when that thing happened, he said I must decrease and Christ must increase. So what is happening is that there's a movement going on because we said if Luther people that follow Luther if they have received what Luther said and and also believe what God will reveal after they would have been in a better place. But they just make a doctrine out of that and and bust God in that doctrine. And Wesley did the same thing. And Pentecost did the same thing. But he said that you have to what? Receive what God has given. And because the gospel keep on moving on. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. I'm not saying that he's going to give you something different. Whatever he's revealing going to line up with the word, but you can't limit God because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And the mistake that some people make is that as Elijah cried out, where is the God of Elijah? He was looking for the same spirit that was in Elijah. That God that was in Elijah is what Elisha cried for. So the bride will always cry for the same God that was in the pro because remember he said that your servant Moses is dead. Joshua be that courageous and move on with the word of God. And Joshua types the Holy Ghost. So we gone past baptism with the Holy Ghost. It's now the Holy Ghost himself in the bride riding the trail once more because the bride and the Christ become one. The husband and the wife is one. Eve was the same material for Adam. And that same God is here. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He didn't use other material. He's the same in the bride and the spirit. will say exact same thing because in the same spirit that raised up Christ is in you, it also resurrect what your your your mortal body. Amen. Because the same God, God hasn't changed. Now they're looking for Jesus Christ on the cross, but they forgot that now he's in the body. &gt;&gt; He's in you, brother Mike. He's in you here. Amen. Jesus move. And the people that have some people have missed that change. They miss that change that um what am I saying? They miss that manifestation or they miss the promise for the age because remember it happened the Pharisees and they said this. They were looking to the letter, but the letter has put on the flesh &gt;&gt; and they crucify the flesh that the letter has put on. And I'm afraid the same thing is happening now. Some people are crucifying Jesus Christ in the flesh without even not knowing it because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. You are part of him, part of the attribute of Christ. He's in you. He's in me. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Let me see if I can find this. Amen. Hallelujah. He said that not all men will receive Christ. Oh no. But those which God for ordaining life is housed around some of the death of the earth. That's the one he comes to quicken. They are the ones that now that death will lay there in the sun and say, "Oh, this old sand is too hot. That rock say this old son is too hot." But that little seed said, "That's what I'm looking for." And begin to spring forth to life. It quickened that part of the death because the son was sent not to quicken the rock, not to quicken the dead but to quicken the life of the seed. So if that life of the seed is in you, you will recognize what God is doing now. &gt;&gt; You won't put him in the past. You will not misplace that word of God. You'll not dis dislocate it because he's the same yesterday, today, forever. Everyone who is ordained to life will recognize what Christ is doing in his age. That's the time that we are living in is a bright age, a bright time. Remember that um the wave chief when the Israelites when they get their first fruits the the chief the priest wave it he doesn't wave it on the seventh day but what the first day which comes back the eighth day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So now is a mighty angel in the bride of Christ doing the exact same thing he did because except he said except a wheat of corn in the ground what it abides alone. So Christ he died on Calvary just to what multiply himself. So now a true Christian have become a hot potato in the hand of the devil because first he only have the Lord as one person to deal with but now he has but everybody the bride in a many member body so he doesn't know what to do. Amen. And that God is in you is in me. He's the same yesterday today and forever. Amen. So, I think I'm going to wrap it up very soon with this here. Let me see. Amen. Hallelujah. Yeah. Wrap it up right now. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's on time. God. Hallelujah. God is good. So what I'm trying to say is that you have to have confidence in and in God that is inside of you. Don't underestimate yourself because it's not you but Christ in you the hope of glory. He is the one living your life through you. You see we get become it become a burden on us when we try to do things by ourself trying to fulfill it by our own self. You can't do it by your own self but allow him and recognize that he's inside of you doing the things. And when you come down in the middle of it, he will manifest himself because the true bride is not just a church member. Some people think that church attendance will put their name in it. It's good to come to church. Don't get me wrong, but you must be in the mystical body of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the main thing. You must have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Before I preach, I always used to have if I become a preacher, I always going to preach about the Holy Ghost because that's your token. &gt;&gt; That's your everything. &gt;&gt; You must have it. You must receive it. You must know what Christ is doing. And you have to live it in your life. &gt;&gt; You got to have that. If you don't have it, you miss the main thing. Amen. Hallelujah. Our God is awesome, &gt;&gt; brother Mike. So, I think I'm done for the day. Just a little exaltation. I hope that it blesses and helps somebody because our God is on time. God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He hasn't changed. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. How do you believe that he's here? I mean, believe that that the present stage of his ministry is that he's come. But where did he come to? Let's all stand. He came to me. [Music] He came to me. When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. That's why he died [Music] on Calary. [Music] When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. One more time, everybody. He came to me. Thank you, Lord. He came to me. [Music] When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. [Music] That's why he [Applause] [Music] could [Music] he came to me. Oh, I got to prove I'm one in a million. I got to show the power of the blood. I got to prove I don't belong in Satan's e. I've got to show that I'm a person. This world isn't worthy of again. Oh, I got to prove I'm one in a million. I got to show the power of the blood. I got to prove I don't belong in Satan's got to show that I'm a person. [Music] Oh, we are the ones who are going to stand. Keep our testimony clean in the midst of an unbelieving world. We keep looking to the unseen and really know that we will overcome and receive his promise. I strong. Oh, I got to prove I'm in a million. Yes, I got to show the power of the blood. I got to prove I don't belong in Satan's evil [Music] that I'm a person. One more time. Yes. I got to prove. Oh, I got to prove I'm one in a million. I got to show the power of the god. I got to prove I don't belong in Satan's evil. I got to show that I'm a person. This world isn't worthy of &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh as uh brother Tim often says, he changes it and he says, "What are we going to prove?" Nothing. But there's one inside that's going to prove. And you got to identify with that one, and that'll be you proving that you're one in a million. All right. Praise God. You're dismissed. God bless you on this wonderful Wednesday night. And uh may the Lord uh bless your Thursday. Bless your day at work. Bless your day with that fella or that guy or that girl. Bless my day with that guy I was talking about tomorrow. Cuz I know you know what the darkness that that fella is in. A little bit of light creeped in today and and then he he he you can see that he was hungry. So let's see what happens tomorrow. How many believe God is more than able to do whatever he wants to do? He'll go just like he came to you. He'll go to somebody else. But how will he do it? Through a life lived. Not just words spoken, brother. Forget that stuff. They got they they got sick and tired of that stuff. It's everywhere. But this word lived and spoken will do marvelous things. Amen. God bless you. What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see. When I look upon his face, the one who saves me by his grace. When he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land, what a day, glorious day that will be. There will be no sorrow there. No more burdens to bear. No more sickness will be no more partying over there and forever I will be with the one for me. What a day. Glorious day to be. Oh, what a [Music] when my Jesus I shall see upon his face [Music] by God's gra by the hand that leads me through the promises. [Music] Glorious [Music] rejoicing as I walk away for the hand of God in all my life. I see the reason the [Music] [Applause]
