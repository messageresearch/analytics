[music] Going to read little parts of it. It's a long one, so we'll just see. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, thou hast searched me and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting, my [music] uprising. Thou understandeth my thought a far off. Thou compass my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways. Oh man, does he know you that way? Hallelujah. For there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, [music] oh Lord, thou knowest it alltogether. Thou [music] hast beset me behind and before and laid thy hand upon me. Oh, hallelujah. Such knowledge [music] is too wonderful for me. It is high. I cannot attain to it unto it. [music] Whether shall I go from thy spirit? Or whether shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into the heavens, thou art there. If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. [music] If I take my wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me. Doesn't matter where we are this morning. and what condition we are. Amen. And thy right [music] hand shall hold me. If I say surely darkness shall cover me, even night shall be light unto me. Hallelujah. Yay, the darkness hideth not from me thee, but the night shineth as a day. The darkness [music] and the light are both alike to thee. Doesn't matter saints. Hallelujah. What you're going [music] through, it's all light. Hallelujah. We're going to skip down to here. Hallelujah. How precious also are the thoughts unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of them. If I should [music] count them, they are more in number than the sand. Oh, hallelujah. When I awake, [music] I am still with thee. Surely thou slain the wicked, oh God. [music] Depart from me there, therefore, ye bloody men. Let us go down to 23. Search me, oh God. [music] This is what we want this morning. The word of God. Search me, oh God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me. and lead me in the way of everlasting. Amen. That's our prayer this morning. That's why we're here. [music] We're not here because of the building. Even we're not even here because of one of another.

For their children. To stand through a test like this, I'll tell you, it's only God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And God has started the work. He will finish it. &gt;&gt; We believe it with all of our hearts. Amen. Praise God. So, we're we're excited about being here today about the word of God. Amen. I I'm just so excited. God bless you, saints. Thank you so much, musicians. Praise God. I'm excited about the word of God. I'm excited about this series that we've been on on adoption. I believe that it's just something that um you know, uh it's who we are. Amen. And it's the message of the hour. It's what God is doing in this hour. It's the Joshua commission. Amen. It's where God comes on the scene. He comes direct. He comes uh and manifests himself directly to the sons and daughters of God so that they can know for sure who they are, &gt;&gt; the hour that we're standing, the hour that we're living in, and the word that's required of this day. She knows it. She knows it because he is with her. Amen. Praise God. So, we're grateful today. Just a reminder, we will have our general meeting after the service today. Praise God. But we're going to have some refreshments um between that. Right after the service, we will go out. We'll have some light refreshments for about uh 2530 minutes and then we'll all gather back into the house of the Lord here to have our general meeting for all the tithe paying members. Praise God. Amen. Let's go to our um let's go to the word today. Glory to God. We've been on this series of uh um the purpose of God and um the last few weeks we've been looking at obtaining our inheritance and all the elements around it. And um today we just want to continue um you know it's part four of obtaining our inheritance. It's actually part 10 of um the purpose of God series. Amen. And the uh being called unto the adoption, being called to sunship. Amen. That's what this is all about. This is the message of the day. Amen. That the sons and daughters of God will manifest and she will produce the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. The message of the hour. Let's go to our scripture. Amen. Our scripture is from Ephesians 1:es 9-11. having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself. Amen. that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance. Amen. being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. Let us pray. Father, Lord, we've read your word. We welcome you now to come and break the word of life. Lord, the same way that you did it when you came the first time, Lord, on the resurrection, you came and you met individually. It wasn't a public show anymore, Father. It was you speaking to the hearts individually of your sons and daughters, bringing them into a recognition of your presence in their midst. Lord, won't you do it this morning once again? speak to our hearts. Let that element of silence just explode within our hearts the revelation of your word, Lord, manifesting the day, the hour that we're living in now. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Glory to God. Amen. You know the mystery of his will. We are the inheritance of God. He has a will. Everything that he purposed within himself before the foundations of the world, he will bring to pass. &gt;&gt; He will bring into manifestation. And in that will, there are sons and daughters of God that have an inheritance. Amen. And he says here that he's making known unto us the mystery of his will. Amen. Praise God. And that we have obtained an inheritance. It's not something that that you know that you have to work for. It's not something that you have to um you know pay the price for. The price has already been paid. Amen. He's prepared the will. He's prepared your inheritance. All you need to do is obtain it. Amen. Recognize that it's yours. That your name is written there. And how do you know? By recognizing the word for your day. by recognizing what God is doing in this hour. Amen. Praise God. Because this is all a predestination according to his will. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Let's read the the the quote here. Um you can go to the next slide from adoption 4. He says, "Look, has predestinated us unto this inheritance." If I'm right, inheritance is something. If God is knocking at my heart and saying, "William Brandom, I called you a long time ago before the foundations of the world to preach the gospel. I have an inheritance, an inheritance of eternal life." Now, God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has sent the word for our day. Who is Jesus? Jesus is the word. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Amen. And if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he's sent Jesus to you, it's because he sent you the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. And he says, and he's made it real to me because there was nothing I could do to he says there uh but in the fullness there was nothing I could do to to inherit it. It was blank. It was valid. There's nothing I could do. But in the fullness of time, God sent in his own good time. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. God's got a plan. It's not according to man's plan. It's all according to his good time. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Uh uh Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. His blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance. Amen. Why would he have to shed blood for us to go to our inheritance? TO BE WHAT? WHAT INHERITANCE? The sunship. to be a son of God. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. You know, when we look at um you know, the original definition of adoption, we go back into the Bible days, it was all based on the fact that there would be an inheritance. And it was not based on the concept of today. And we've, you know, we've said this already. It was based on the concept, you know, that God that that that a father would declare his son supreme authority over his inheritance. Amen. This is the biblical inheritance. This is the one that we are looking into. This is the one that we have come into adoption of. Amen. It's a full authority in full power. Amen. This this is the adoption that we're talking about. Amen. It's the manifestation of the sons of God in the last times. Amen. In the last days. And the Lord predestinated you for that particular portion of the word. &gt;&gt; That's the portion that you are ordained to. Amen. In this day and in this hour to manifest sons of God. Amen. Glory to God. in a supreme authority to speak on his behalf. Hallelujah. Amen. To speak. He says, "This is the only age where full adoption brings you to be the voice of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. In the last days, in the end time, God has given us his full authority to speak his word. Amen. Why? In order to produce mature believers. Amen. To fulfill the purpose of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. Let's go to our uh next scripture. Ephesians chapter 3 verse one. Now for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles. If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to you, Ward, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, so pay attention here as we as we go into this. as I wrote a for in few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ. &gt;&gt; So there's an element of mystery that God would would leave until the end time and he's not talking about mysteries. Paul is making it very clear here that there is a mystery of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. The whole plan of redemption is based around this mystery of Christ. Amen. Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men. Amen. This is not for sons of men. This mystery is for sons of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The manifested sons of God. Amen. Glory to God. It's not revealed unto his holy prophets. uh a and is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit. Amen. Aren't you glad that God sent us a prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. To make known the mystery of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is this is what's actually brought us here. &gt;&gt; This is why you're here today. &gt;&gt; You're not here because, oh, I'm a Christian and I belong to this church. Oh, I belong to that church. I go to this church. I'm a Baptist. I'm a Presbyterian. I'm a Catholic. No, this is not why you're here. If you're here today, you're saying, "I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I've come into contact with my father. &gt;&gt; I know that I have a heavenly father." &gt;&gt; That's the true relationship of Christianity. Amen. If there's a definition, Christianity is is to have Christ in you &gt;&gt; and to know it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he goes on here, verse six, that the Gentiles should be fellow airs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel, by the word. In Christ, by the word. Amen. whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. Amen. Glory to God. Let's read on. Go to the next slide. Now pay attention. And he says, "Unto me who am less than the least of all the saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the uncarchable riches of Christ." &gt;&gt; Like you you got to see here what like Paul is bringing forth a revelation of God. And he goes on and he says, "And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery." There is it. There it is again. You see, there's a mystery that's unveiling itself. Amen. Now, we're not trying to make this mysterious. That's not Listen, if if there's anything, I want this to be so simple that even the children can understand it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. But here he's saying there's a fellowship of that mystery so that we can see it. And Paul, he was, you know, he he was the the the first church age messenger that was given so much revelation on this mystery of God. Hallelujah. But yet, he didn't have the full understanding of this mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He only had the portion that he was given in that first church age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's move on. which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden. God &gt;&gt; who CREATED ALL THINGS BY JESUS CHRIST TO the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You read that, you study that scripture, you can go back and you can draw so much out of that. It was all a mystery that he had from before the foundations of the world. Where was that mystery? In him. &gt;&gt; What who whose purpose was it? His purpose. How was it all done? Through Jesus Christ who created all things. How can Jesus create all things and not be God? So he was God in the beginning. In the beginning was the word. Amen. The word was made flesh. This whole plan is all about him. &gt;&gt; It's all about him bringing himself into manifestation. And this is what the world, the church world has always missed. They missed it the very first time that he came. He came to his own and his own received him not. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were not given the eyes to see. They could not recognize. He said to them, you know, to the to the disciples when they're, you know, they said, "Lord, you know, you just preached the word of life and and it's so real to us." But look, they're all leaving. Why? Why are they leaving? He says, "Blessed are your ears. unto you. It has been given to know the mysteries &gt;&gt; of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, there's an element that draws us together. And this is what Paul is is preaching here. And this is what we want to look at. We want to look at the depths of the fellowship of the mystery. Amen. Praise God. So, in order for us to look at this, let's go to the you just stay on this slide here for a few minutes. So in order for us to be like God, we need to understand that this that this fellowship was in him from the very beginning. Amen. Glory to God. Paul here who's the first church age messenger speaking to the Gentiles these uncarchable riches of Christ. So you can't search this out. &gt;&gt; It must be revealed. He made it very clear who who God who by revelation you know people read that scripture and they don't understand the the the the the importance of revelation that that the word of God is not something that you figure out. &gt;&gt; It's something that you surrender to. &gt;&gt; It's something that you yield your spirit to him and you say Lord reveal your thoughts unto me. &gt;&gt; And this is what Paul was making very clear. these unsearchable riches. He couldn't search them. He couldn't listen, he was he was a theologian of theologians. &gt;&gt; But when he got converted, he had to go to the to the desert for for two or three years to get all his theology out of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it was not God. Listen, you can take in the word, you can read the word, but it takes the spirit to give it life. &gt;&gt; It takes the Holy Ghost to bring it to life in you. And that only happens by revelation. Amen. And he says that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs of the same body, sons of God. And what does the adoption do? It makes you a minister of the word for your day. That's what sunship does. It brings you into a place of authority as a son to speak on behalf of God. So Paul is preaching so that we can discover what is the fellowship of the mystery fellowship of the not mystery of fellowship. It's not about coming to you know oh let's get together and and let's have fellowship you know we can fellowship all around. No no no there's a mystery there's a there's a there's a fellowship in the mystery. &gt;&gt; That's where the true fellowship lies. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the fellowship that sons of God gather together week in and week out. They're they're under the fellowship of the mystery. Amen. Praise God. And our ministry is to show that fellowship, to show that ministry, to show that mystery in our lives &gt;&gt; to show that Jesus Christ is not just some denominational teaching out there or some man's interpretation of of the word. It's of no private interpretation. Amen. Praise God. So, what do we get from this scripture? We see that this this was hidden from the foundations of the world. But yet it requires sons of God to be manifested &gt;&gt; in order to bring out this fellowship. &gt;&gt; Understand? This this this mystery that that Paul is is is explaining here is also telling us that it that it takes it takes sons of God to come into manifestation in order to to bring this mystery into into plain view. in order to draw the sons and daughters of God to where the carcass is to where the the mana is to where the fresh revelation of of God making himself known having preeminence in the church. Amen. Under the five-fold ministry, it takes the sons to manifest. This mystery was from the beginning. It was hidden in [clears throat] God who created all things by Jesus Christ. So if all things were created by Jesus Christ, then Jesus Christ was in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And he's the same God. &gt;&gt; He's not one in three. He's not part of a trinity. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Hallelujah. He was the word made flesh. God became man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This was God's plan right from the very beginning. This is the fellowship of the mystery. Amen. Glory to God. That he was the logus, the word that went forth from himself. Jesus only came 2,000 years ago. So, how could he create all things? Because he is the self-existent one. Hallelujah. It's the fellowship of the mystery that was hidden in God &gt;&gt; but now being made manifest. So we are here to manifest that very element of the mystery of God which is to reveal the sons of God and to manifest the sons of God. Amen. Let's go to our quote here in adoption two. He says some people say well why didn't God just stop it in the beginning? You know and one and and and brother Bram's speaking here and he's quoting some. He says he somebody said he's a cruelhearted brute said Joe Lewis the one that condemned Joe or Jack Co. See he said he's just a cruelhearted brute. There's no such a thing as God. If there was such a thing he'd oh I'd just call him all kinds of names. See but it's just because he might have a lot of knowledge up here but he ain't got nothing down in here. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why a lot of people there, I'm an atheist. I don't believe Jesus Christ. I don't believe that God exists. It's because there's nothing in here. There's no representation. &gt;&gt; Amen. But watch what he goes on to say. But it's just because he might he might have a lot of knowledge up here, but he ain't got nothing down here. Now, that's where it's at. See, this word tells it here, and he's hid it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And these mysteries has been hid. Now remember the Bible said since the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; But watch waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God to display them to the church. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You get it? You see, there's a portion of word that you are &gt;&gt; that you've been ordained to that you will display in these last days &gt;&gt; to the church. Amen. Glory to God. It It's God and man, God on earth. Amen. To bring many brethren like unto himself. Philippians 3 21 says, "Who shall change our vile body?" Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. That it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, &gt;&gt; according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. Let me tell you something. If you're in Christ and you've receive the word of God and you are heir to this revelation, all things are subject to you as a son or daughter of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost came into you, it came in order to have his purpose control and and and take divine preeminence over your life. &gt;&gt; No matter what comes into your life, no matter what situation comes into your life, if it's sickness that comes into your life, IT'S IRRELEVANT. THE HOLY GHOST in you will override that sickness &gt;&gt; because God's purpose will and must override that sickness. &gt;&gt; It is the It is because sons of God will manifest God. &gt;&gt; And sickness cannot stay where God is. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It has to come subject to him. It must obey the word of God. You his purpose will override your purpose. It'll override your weakness. It'll override your days when you feel depressed. When you feel that you can't you can't do it on your own. You you can't figure it out. You you just you just can't you CAN'T YOU CAN'T PUT IT TOGETHER, RIGHT? YOU JUST YOU'RE LOOKING EVERYWHERE. Everywhere you look, you can't see the answer. Amen. BUT THE PURPOSE OF GOD WILL OVERRIDE IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He goes on here. He says, "Now you go to the next slide." He says, "Now I stop on my story just a little bit or I'll bring I'll go to my to my next thought to get this." Now remember, all through the ages of Moses, back through the ages of the prophets, back through all the ages, they've waited until this latter days for these things to be displayed according to the scriptures. That's right. For it is to be revealed to the sons of God. Hallelujah. This revelation is not for everybody. &gt;&gt; It's not, oh, I'm in the message. I believe God sent a prophet. I believe in the opening of the seals. I believe in the seven church ages. THAT'S THAT'S THAT DON'T MEAN NOTHING. AMEN. It's for sons of God. &gt;&gt; It's for those that have recognized. Amen. That's right. For it is for it to be revealed to the sons of God. Why? From the lost until like the pyramid. As I as I have said, building closer and closer. There is a plan of God. Why do you think we call this the capstone age? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because Christ himself come down in 1963. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Listen, you he may not have come to you yet. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. The coming of the Lord is not always Listen, we can't put a date on the coming of the Lord. Hallelujah. Listen. Was the coming of the Lord the same when he came to Zach? Uh uh Zach uh Zakiah &gt;&gt; Zakius. Amen. Was he coming to Zakius the same at at the same time that he came to the woman at the well? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. It was different times. But yet when he came at his appointed time, &gt;&gt; they said, "Thou art the Christ. &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ." Our father said like the woman at the well that that that that when Messiah would come, he would do these things. Hallelujah. Glory to God. You've read it in the word. You heard what brother Brandham said. You've listened to the tapes. We listen to those tapes. I listen. I wouldn't even have a message if I didn't listen to those tapes. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have a message if we didn't recognize the prophet of Malachi 4:5. Amen. REVELATIONS 10:17. YOU would not know. you'd have nothing to preach. Hallelujah. But the Holy Ghost, HE SAYS THE building is moving closer and closer into completion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. My my my servant Moses is dead. BUT HE SAYS, JOSHUA, BE courageous because you're going to need courage in this hour &gt;&gt; to to hold that word before the people and to stand there and and take the uh the the the reproach for the word of God because because you're YOU'RE RECOGNIZING JOSHUA IS YOUR CAPTAIN. JOSHUA is your leader. And who is our Joshua? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. In order to manifest and to reveal or to make known sons of God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Now, with all the great power and victories that all the Old Testament prophets and kings, they had they did they did not get to where they could be in this position of manifested sons of God. &gt;&gt; Look at their great accomplishments. But yet, it took the coming of the Lord. Without the coming of the Lord, there would be no manifested sons. &gt;&gt; Because he was the first fruits, remember we are the ones that are going to take on that same image as his glorious image. Amen. Praise God. And they could not achieve it. They had to die and they went to that fifth dimension. They had to wait on the coming of the Lord. Amen. They were me. Look at David. He had great victories. He was anointed with the Holy Spirit, anointed by God to to have great victories, but yet he fell back into adultery. He fell into situations. He made mistakes. Hallelujah. Because why? Because it was going to take the one to come and take the place for all sin. &gt;&gt; If a man sin, a man had to die. Amen. Glory to God. That was the only way that God could bring sons of God, daughters of God back to eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where we were before we came here. Amen. Glory to God. He had to pay the price for redemption by going to the cross and giving up the Holy Ghost which now made a way for the Old Testament saints to receive their sunship. They listen when Christ came when when when when Christ died on the cross, he he went back to his theophony. He went back to his to his sunship. Amen. To the image of God. He was now God in human in a human form back on earth. And he go and what does he do? He goes down to hell because that theophony body can moved dimensional. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. This is the hour where we interdimensionally change, saints. &gt;&gt; And and this was all reflected in him. He went down. He He grabbed all those that were waiting on him, took the keys away from the from the enemy. Amen. And took them to their theophony bodies. Amen. Glory to God. And now they're waiting on us &gt;&gt; because we've got something that we need to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. We listen. They cannot be made perfect without us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. So what is going on? It's the Holy Ghost, the person of God himself uniting or capping the body in order to produce sons and manifested sons of God. Amen. Glory to God. But why does BUT WHY NOW DOES THIS come to its fullness? Why why why does it have to come to its fullness now? because we're at the age where the rapture must be manifested &gt;&gt; in order to produce and manifest sons of God who and what is a son of God? He is a God. He is he is like God. &gt;&gt; Listen, if God brings forth children, he brings forth sons. He brings forth daughters. Amen. Glory to God. But why now? because it's the time of the rapture. &gt;&gt; And then it's the time for the millennium. Hallelujah. Where the sons of God will come back in their theophanes in order to rule with him. Allelujah. Praise God. Forever more. [snorts] Let's let's move on here. In John chapter one, we're talking about manifesting sons of God and that there's a there's a there's a fellowship in the mystery of that. And that's what we are here doing this morning. This is what Paul was bringing out. And this is what now has been it's been it's been given to us to to manifest that mystery of God. Amen. Praise God. And look, he says here, he came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he the power &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even to them that believe on his name, which were were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. We must be born of the word. &gt;&gt; We cannot be born by man's denominational teaching. &gt;&gt; We cannot be born by the by by the teachings that are even within the message. Now &gt;&gt; that you know that they're they're telling you how you you must approach God. There's only one way and that's through the tapes. That's not God's provided way. Hallelujah. Praise God. We need to recognize the revelation of God himself come down in order to fulfill and and and manifest the the the portion of the word which brings the manifestation of the sons of God into their fullness. Amen. And when that happens, we're changed. &gt;&gt; We manifest the rapture. Hallelujah. Praise God. Listen, let's read the next quote here in in adoption because this is all about the adoption of sons. How many's been reading the paper this week? What Kruchev and them said? Oh, they're ready. So are we. Amen. Ready. It's all right. See? Oh, what? What a privilege. What a day. If the Christians could only realize the day that we're living in. My what do you think the writer of this book that's seen it and seen where it would be manifested in the last days waiting waiting and groaning for those sons of God to rise in the last days. &gt;&gt; So there's there there's something about us that brings the word into its fullness. Amen. And you can see that the earth is groaning. &gt;&gt; There's wars. There's there's there's this political systems are falling apart. What is it? That's all the groaning of the world &gt;&gt; because the because we are the only ones with us here on this earth. This earth still continues to survive. But watch when the Holy Ghost takes the sons of God and lifts off of this earth. You watch the chaos that comes into this earth. &gt;&gt; Do you know that it's because we're here that this earth is still intact? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the only reason why things are still intact here on earth is because the sons of God have not come into full manifestation yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're coming into manifestation. We are predestinated unto the adoption of sons. Amen. A lot of people, they'll read about the adoption. They'll talk about the adoption. They'll listen to the tapes on adoption, but they don't recognize that it's an adoption unto &gt;&gt; sons of God. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. So, he says here in the last days with the power of the Holy Ghost at the end of the age to reveal the secret things from the foundations of the world to bring it up. Now, let's go back into the foundation of the world again to get a revelation to see if we're right or not. You see, brother Brandham, he was he was recognizing that all of our positioning, all of our salvation, all of our healing, if if if if there was ever going to be anything saved, there would have to be a savior and there would have to be something to save. Everything was back in the before the foundations of the world. And brother Brandham was seeing the clarity of that because there were sons of God before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a there's a difference between sons of God and the angels. God created the angels. &gt;&gt; Those angels were created to worship him and that's why he could be called God. &gt;&gt; But it was sons that were actually a manifestation of himself. Amen. And brother Brandham saw this. He saw that this element had to come in the last days. Amen. Where the where the sons of God would manifest the word to produce this rapture, this change that we are now in the midst of. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. So he goes on here. Let's go to the next slide here. In adopt in adoption, he says, what did he do? He by fornowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a savior, self-existent. There was no angels, no nothing, just God, Ella Elohim, the self-existent one. Nothing but him alone. &gt;&gt; But in him was a savior. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, what's he going to save? There's nothing lost. Knowing that, then he knowed that this great attribute in him would project something out yonder that he could save. &gt;&gt; And that's why the logust in the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. When the logust went forth, it was Jesus Christ in the image of God, a son of God, in the image of God to create and to bring the first manifestation of a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. One unto like his glorious body. That's what we're in the process of. Amen. So he knowed that that that great attribute in him would project something out yonder he would save. Then when it did that by fornowledge he looked down and he saw everyone that would accept it. &gt;&gt; He saw that you would be in this day and in this age. &gt;&gt; He saw that you would have that attribute that he sent forth. &gt;&gt; That attribute happened to land in you. &gt;&gt; But it didn't have to land in you. It could have landed anywhere else. But it landed in you. &gt;&gt; And and because it landed in you, when the word is spoken, that's why you don't know where the seed is. You he he scattered the seed. Some fell on good ground. Some fell on on on stony ground. Amen. But but there was there was some that when the when the word receives the when when that seed receives the word for their day and they are that attribute that he that he saw in his mind. He he saw that in his mind that those attributes were going to go out there like a like a like a a cluster of attributes in in this in this age. &gt;&gt; And you you you had to come to this revelation. You you had to unite with what we had to unite. I had to come under this leadership. &gt;&gt; There was nothing that could stop it. I didn't understand why I was pulled there. But something Gabriel had something the Lord had placed within him, a word that had to BE SPOKEN THAT BROUGHT life and and watered the seed, the attribute that was in me and it brought it to life &gt;&gt; all of a sudden as without understanding being pulled to the word of God. What is it? It's attributes of God coming into manifestation in order to produce the word for our day. &gt;&gt; That's why you can't how can you dis how can you just say oh I can just listen to the tapes. You need the you need Christ. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED CHRIST HIMSELF TO SPEAK to you. You need his word to come directly purposed into your heart as an attribute of God to bring you into manifestation in your day. Otherwise, you're just a churchgoer. &gt;&gt; You're just like anybody else. Amen. Glory to God. Go on. Now, he says the next slide. He says, "Then he came down and he taken upon himself. And while he did that, he did that he might save you who wants to be saved." &gt;&gt; You had a desire. Listen, don't try to explain it. I was in a condition, all I know is I I was in a condition where where Satan had me bound by drugs, but I wanted to be delivered. &gt;&gt; I wanted to be delivered. And and I knew that I couldn't do it on my own. God places certain, you know, characteristics and certain conditions in your life. &gt;&gt; You look at the situations and the circumstances that you're that you're in. You need to be in them. &gt;&gt; THE ATTRIBUTE THAT GOD SENT to you has a purpose to overcome those circumstances. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, HE WOULD NOT HAVE SENT IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; He He needed to send it to you so that you could know and want the word to deliver you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; you you you didn't know what you needed. YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND what you needed, but you knew that you needed salvation. You knew that you needed deliverance. You didn't. But then when the deliverance came, then he drops a revelation on you and says, "You are a son." &gt;&gt; And you say, "Glory to God. What? &gt;&gt; I'm a son." Yes. You and I've given you eyes to see. And then all of a sudden, you start reading. You start listening to the prophet. You start reading the books. And all of a sudden, the the the word is just coming to life. You're you go to church and you know you the preacher's preaching and it's just burning within your heart. You can't understand what it is. What is it? It's the manifestation of a son of God. &gt;&gt; It's an attribute coming into its maturity. &gt;&gt; You can't stop it. It's going to happen. It's going to it's going to transform you. It's going to it's going to translate you from this dimension into that other dimension. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And he goes on now he says here, do you see what I mean? By forn knowledge the infinite God who knowed all things saw the lamb and he slayed the lamb when before the foundations of the world. Oh, glory to God. I'll tell you, John was just having one great big party. Hallelujah. in in in chapter five, he goes from from from who's who who's worthy to loose the seals, WHO'S WORTHY TO OPEN THE BOOK BECAUSE THERE'S A MYSTERY in there that that that he knows that he's he's in desperation that he needs to understand. But here now, here's that that lamb that that that he saw a lamb. He slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world and he put your name on the lamb's book of life. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Listen, I'm telling you, John got excited when he saw the lamb step out from the throne. &gt;&gt; He knew that the mystery of his name being in that book was now going to be released. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. You didn't understand what was going on. That's why I'm saying you're you're just you're just coming to church. You can't you you don't you can't go anywhere else. You try to go to another church and it's dry. YOU CAN'T HEAR NOTHING. &gt;&gt; You you you turn the station on and and they're TALKING ABOUT JESUS. THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT JESUS, BUT YET THERE'S NO REVELATION COMING OUT OF THE TEACHING. &gt;&gt; WHY? Because your name was written under this mystery. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; This is what calls you. This is what brings you into manifestation as a son of God. There's no mystery there. There's no revelation there. How you going to be called? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He goes on here and he says, he says, next slide. And he and he's seen the deceitfulness of Satan. Amen. Of this age. That's why it's so deceiving. And now that deception has come right up into the message. So, so you know, keep your thinking cap on here. All right? Because this is the end. This is where that's why he saved this to the end. Amen. Because the deception would be so deceiving that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible. But listen what he says. And he's seen the deceitfulness of Satan what he would do. So he put your name on there and he said that the antichrist would be so religious. Oh boy. So good. &gt;&gt; Such a fine fellow. Amen. Such a smart man, such a religious man that he would deceive the very elect if IT WAS POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; OH my goodness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it is impossible. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN UNDER THAT MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE MYSTERY THAT PAUL'S TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S THE FELLOWSHIP that that that that we're fellowshipping on here this morning. THAT'S WHAT'S BROUGHT YOU INTO LIFE. GLORY TO GOD. IT'S WHAT GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE and courage TO TO PRESS ON and to believe this word and to and to keep pressing THE BATTLE. AMEN. REGARDLESS of the battle, don't worry. The attribute in you will overcome. &gt;&gt; Impossible. Because their names were for ordained before the foundation of the world. By election he chose them. And by predestination they know where they are going. &gt;&gt; There you are. THAT'S YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOU. That's you that he's talking about. There you are. Amen. Glory to God. BECAUSE YOU HAD THAT mystery &gt;&gt; placed within you before the foundations of the world. Amen. There's no devil in hell that's going to take that out of you. Listen, let's read the next scripture here in in uh Hebrews 11:es 1 to4. He says, "God who at sundry times and in diverse manner spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets &gt;&gt; hath in these last days spoken unto unto us by his son." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's still speaking, saints. He's still anointing &gt;&gt; the five-fold ministry to speak his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who hath appointed heir appointed heir of all things by the by whom also he made the worlds. Glory to God. There it is again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just like we read in Ephesians 3:9. And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which was from the beginning of the world hid IN GOD. WHO CREATED ALL THINGS by who? Jesus Christ. And what does the scripture say here? He says, "By whom also he made the worlds." &gt;&gt; So if he made the worlds, then he is the self-existent one. You see? You see how all of a sudden there's no such thing as a trinity? &gt;&gt; You see, that's the mystery. That's the mystery of God. They don't realize that's that's the very mystery of God that that he he didn't he he he he could express himself in attribute form and yet he could have many attributes but yet still be one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See who being the brightness. Now let's go on. Who be being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person. He's ex showing here that Jesus Christ was the expressed image of God and upholding all things by the word of his power. [snorts] Okay? Not by your own power, not by your own ability, not by I'm going to speak the word. No, no, no. You need to speak the word that's anointed by him speaking through you. &gt;&gt; That's the anointed word. That's understanding that you are a son of God. Amen. Praise God. That has the authority as a son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. THIS THIS AUTHORITY, SAINTS, like we need to see what what what what he's placed in our hands. &gt;&gt; We need to understand the you know the the the importance of this revelation that he's giving us as sons of God in this hour having this fellowship around the mystery. &gt;&gt; It puts us into full authority. &gt;&gt; It'll change the way you approach somebody that needs prayer. AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SAINTS. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IT CHANGES EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; You lay hands ON THE SICK, YOU KNOW THAT THEY SHALL RECOVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT NOT NOT NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE making them recover because the word said &gt;&gt; and YOU ARE A REPRESENTATION of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. He says here upholding all things by the power of his word. and he had by himself purged all our sins. So listen, once you're in him, don't let the devil lie to you and bring back your past and bring back you remember this, you remember that. You remind him where he's going. &gt;&gt; That's what you need to do. Just remind him, Satan, you're going to the lake of fire pretty soon. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. You're going to be bound up for a thousand years. I'm going to get to watch you bound up for a thousand years. Amen. If you're a son of God, you don't fear that devil. &gt;&gt; You have nothing to fear as a son of God. Amen. Glory to God. When he by purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high. Now listen, this is Paul displaying and telling us what a son is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. that a son sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. Listen, the lamb when he took the book out of out of from out of the one that was in the throne, that was he himself &gt;&gt; stepping out of the throne because there was you go back and read chapter 4 of Revelation, he says there was one that sat on the throne &gt;&gt; and then all of a SUDDEN A LAMB STEPS out from the throne. one who had been slain from the foundation of the what what God's just expressing his plan. &gt;&gt; He was he was showing TO JOHN EXACTLY WHAT was going to take place. Amen. Glory to God. But but here Peter, he didn't understand that this time and season would have to come. He all he could see was what God was revealing to him that that that that we would be seated at the right hand of the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels. You remember God created the angels first. Angels cannot be sons. &gt;&gt; Angels have a beginning. They're going to have an end. Sons are are expressed from God. So we have we have a a an existence so much higher. He says so much better than the angels as he hath an by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. What is that name? Sons of God. &gt;&gt; Sons of God. They were angels. That was their name. But you're not an angel. You're a son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Oh, a son is someone who the father can speak by. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what Paul is trying to explain to us here. He's trying to show us true sunship, heir of all things that the father owns. All things. The brightness of his glory. What is the brightness of his glory? What what what is the brightness of his glory? The brightness of his glory is his theophony. That's what the brightness of his glory is. That that's how we are going to be expressed. That's when we go into full sunship, we connect with our theophony. And we have a a a we have a a a glorious body. This corruption must put on incorruption. Amen. A body like unto his glorious body. Amen. Glory to God. So, so what this revelation of sunship is is a revelation that you've got a theophony &gt;&gt; that you've got a body that's that if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, you have another one waiting. &gt;&gt; And yet, you're you're you're already dissolving. &gt;&gt; Little by little, YOU ARE DISSOLVING. YOU'RE DYING OUT to your own interpretation of the word of God. You're dying out to your own ideas, and you're taking on the full word of God. She hath made herself ready. Amen. Glory to God. Sons reveal the father. And what is the father? It's the nature of God. &gt;&gt; It's his nature, his authority, his strength, his ability, not your ability. As a son, YOU CAN EXPRESS HIS ABILITY. AMEN. you you're able to uphold all the challenges that come your way by the power of his word in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. We're winding it down here. Sat down at the right hand. He is equal to the power of God. Has the authority. Listen to him that overcomemeth. Remember what it said in Revelations 3 21. Let me read it to you from verse 20 because this is the hour that we're living in right now. He's outside of the church door right now. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; And he's still knocking. &gt;&gt; He's knocking. He says here, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. And if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know, people want to put this in the in the seventh church age. They just want to place it there. He's still knocking &gt;&gt; because there's people that are outside that that that that are that are not letting him in. They're they all they want to do is just nope. We just go to listen to the tapes. That's all we do. We just we don't want we don't we don't need any uh you know authority. People that that only say I only listen to tapes, you know what they're saying? I do not come subject to a pastor. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's what they're saying. I'm not coming subject to a pastor. &gt;&gt; I'll pay my tithes to brother Brandham &gt;&gt; and they'll send their tithes to Voice of God. And I'm not saying that that Listen, if they've got a revelation of Brother Joseph as their pastor, &gt;&gt; fine. That's their business. Praise God. Let them pay their ties. I got nothing against any of that. But what but what is it that a person who doesn't want to belong to a church doesn't want to be you know exposed &gt;&gt; and and and and be a part of a body because now they got to come under subjection. &gt;&gt; They don't realize the person that they're they're they're rebelling and not coming under subjection to is not the pastor. It's Christ the word &gt;&gt; in the present stage of his ministry. &gt;&gt; That's what they don't want. They don't want the word to correct their lives. They don't want the word to tell them that they need a pastor. Even the prophet said you you stay with your pastor. &gt;&gt; He even said it. He says he'll take you through. Amen. You need a revelation on that. But listen, you can't give people revelation. You just have to let them in their own time and season come. So he's still knocking. But to him that overcomemeth, this hour, the deception of this hour, I will grant to sit with me in my throne. How can you be in the throne unless you are in Christ? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As as and he goes here, even as I overcame. Remember Jesus came to show us the way back. &gt;&gt; He came to display himself. Amen. He that hath an ear, let him hear. He says, he says, even as I overcame and am set down with my father in his throne, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Amen. Praise God. This is our inheritance. Glory to God. We become the mystery of God. Let the musicians come. Amen. We are listen a more excellent name than the angels. Why? Because he God became man. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is his original plan that God could be man so that man could be God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sons of God. What is greater than the angels? The sons of God. Amen. The sons of God are coming out of their spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; Amen. The church forgot that we are the express that we are to express Christ. &gt;&gt; That's you know that's people just go to church out of tradition. They don't realize that their purpose in in in being a Christian is to express Jesus Christ to this generation. Amen. So by Jesus Christ the word for our day. He awakens us and he awakens others through you and me as we live and manifest this word. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. I'll just read this last quote here from spiritual amnesia. [snorts] He says, "They think just because I belong to church that's all that is necessary. Oh brother, that means no more to God than to be a mason or anything else." any other lodge to belong to church. That don't mean nothing to God. You've got to be sons and daughters of God. You've got to be born of God. And God is the word. And when I become a part of my father, I become all my I become all my father. Hallelujah. Did you hear that? I become all my father. When you become a part of God, you become God in full. &gt;&gt; Amen. his whole word. You believe it all &gt;&gt; spiritual amnesia. He says you come out of your spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop right there. There's more, but we'll continue the next time that we come together. And I just want to remind you that next weekend I'll be ministering at brother Isaiah Brooks in Iowa.
