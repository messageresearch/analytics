[28:47] quotations here as a background for this
[28:49] for inspiration uh for Supernatural
[28:52] communication of the Holy Spirit to
[28:54] brother eagles eat Eagles food MH is
[28:58] that
[29:00] right you can't be a chicken and a
[29:03] chicken can't be an eagle because Eagles
[29:07] have a scream but chickens are cheap
[29:11] chap cheap
[29:13] cheap right they always cheap it's one
[29:17] of the cheapest meat you can even
[29:22] R right so we are
[29:25] eagles praise God what the 6 weeks
[29:29] whatever you can have a chicken grown up
[29:31] and ready to to sell go to market it
[29:34] takes a year for one Eagle to even start
[29:38] to grow and to come forth so we ain't
[29:40] cheap God put us here and it cost us the
[29:44] price the precious blood of Christ
[29:47] hallelujah praise the Lord You're a part
[29:50] of the eagle
