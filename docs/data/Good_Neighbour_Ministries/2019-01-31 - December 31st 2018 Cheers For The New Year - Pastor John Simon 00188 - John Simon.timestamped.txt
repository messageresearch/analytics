[7:28] praise the Lord
[7:30] please begin to
[7:33] [Music]
[7:52] [Music]
[8:00] I'll read them how the scripture because
[8:03] there's one more step after the Lord
[8:06] stop though this is out of the book of
[8:12] John and Jesus is speaking the supper
[8:24] Jesus Jesus knowing that the father had
[8:29] given all things into his hands and that
[8:32] he was come from God went to God rising
[8:36] up from supper and laid aside his
[8:39] garments took a towel and girded itself
[8:44] after that he poured water into a basin
[8:47] I begin to wash the disciples feet and
[8:51] to wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[8:54] was hurting then cometh he to Simon
[8:58] Peter and Peter said they wash my feet
[9:03] jesus said unto Him what I do not know
[9:12] here because some of them thou shalt
[9:17] never wash my feet jesus said unto him
[9:20] if I watched enough of us no part with
[9:23] me so I could be the son of a lord that
[9:27] was my people you become I am
[9:37] [Music]
[10:00] [Music]
[10:12] you also you should do tell me you
[10:40] servant is not greater than stored in
[10:43] the he had sent greater than he that is
[10:47] sent any servants if you know these
[10:52] things and happy are you if you do them
[11:00] [Music]
[11:01] so we have the Lord's Supper
[11:03] after the Lord's Supper it is over there
[11:07] the sisters downstairs auxiliary to put
[11:12] up the proper curtain here and they will
[11:20] wash one another's feet there the
[11:24] brothers will stay upstairs
[11:25] we will watch each other
[11:30] [Music]
[11:43] amen
[11:46] [Music]
[11:57] [Music]
[11:59] take these few moments to search your
[12:03] heart and hope most of you are believers
[12:06] but this is what he was talking about
[12:09] I've explained this before that what
[12:13] Peter did not understand right is that
[12:18] he had washed them by the work by the
[12:20] preaching but every day they have to
[12:25] walk out in the villages of the tops
[12:27] with their sandals and back in those
[12:29] days the transportation was not
[12:31] Cadillacs and cars it was and these
[12:39] camels and horses would that will be the
[12:45] street they're dumb industry so if
[12:49] you're not watching you maybe walk and
[12:52] step into it plus the dust would be on
[12:57] your feet so the tradition was whenever
[13:00] they went to somebody's home the first
[13:03] thing so yes you're safe if you're
[13:27] picking up dust you pick it up
[13:30] differently then I thought even thoughts
[13:32] you might have the wrong thing
[13:34] just then things you pick up along the
[13:36] way and he's saying to you you need to
[13:41] wash and that's why we have to repent if
[13:45] you have to talk to God amen we have
[13:48] advocated the Father Jesus Christ
[13:52] and we also ought to learn to watch our
[13:57] brothers and sisters speak physically
[14:00] and spiritually look at them even if you
[14:05] see seeing things doesn't mean that you
[14:09] have to go see about them even though
[14:12] the individual maybe Deborah you only
[14:15] say or do is not tell you do not pray
[14:21] pray for that person
[14:26] surrender your rights it is your right
[14:40] [Music]
[14:44] you know it's one thing to control is to
[14:58] be able to see and know still use that
[15:04] to expose people honest or they use them
[15:09] to go condemn people true character to
[15:16] anointing is paused on the control
[15:21] not using it in discriminately a bargain
[15:26] who is just straight water all over the
[15:28] place but knowing exactly what you're
[15:31] doing under the anointing inspirations
[15:34] Holy Spirit
[15:35] so let's wash one another's feet
[15:37] naturally and then the same time briefly
[15:40] a brother and sister but some people am
[15:49] work stick on to them that God bar would
[15:52] you want to see you but you put your
[15:56] body and everything else like that the
[15:59] depth is like that control things that
[16:01] you like that we pray one from truly
[16:10] sincere praise God shall be honest
[16:20] [Music]
[17:02] [Music]
[17:19] and when you have taken the brandy Jim
[17:23] planks break it and said take eat this
[17:29] is my body broken for you let us partake
[17:34] of this emblem here to us thank you lord
[17:40] [Music]
[17:59] and after this he took the cup and said
[18:07] this confident of the New Testament
[18:13] tricky all of it
