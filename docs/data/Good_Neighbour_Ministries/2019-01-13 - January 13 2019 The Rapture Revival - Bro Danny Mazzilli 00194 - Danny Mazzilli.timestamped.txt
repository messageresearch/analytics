[0:00] watching and waiting in that I believe
[0:02] that we can leave today
[0:07] the glories of God God bless you states
[0:12] certainly continue to prepare a costume
[0:14] that he has a wonderful vacation after
[0:17] 50 years of marriage you know
[0:25] you know I'm 33 years now of marriage
[0:29] and vacations are always good you know
[0:33] it gets that rekindles it gets me fired
[0:38] up and and rested about here reflect
[0:41] what the Lord is doing because as sons
[0:44] and daughters of God interested in our
[0:48] lives so long read from the book of
[0:56] Ephesians today we're going to be
[0:59] looking at of course the first light
[1:07] title today is the rapture the Bible and
[1:11] then the phrase God we know that the
[1:13] Lord he always does things in different
[1:18] times and different seasons and a
[1:21] different dispensation but we have to
[1:23] recognize what a sensation were actually
[1:27] in order for the word to have full
[1:29] effect upon our lives because it could
[1:32] be you know what I say
[1:33] many times the Cadbury Moses's message
[1:36] today you couldn't bring no as a message
[1:40] when Jesus Christ was coming to the
[1:42] earth it all typed it but it was not a
[1:45] message of the hour
[1:47] amen brings it up and so how relevant
[1:51] and how important it is that when we
[1:53] feast on the Word of God and when we
[1:55] read the Word of God even hear the word
[1:58] of God you want to be under the right
[2:01] expectation we want to know the
[2:03] dispensation of living and what the word
[2:06] is expected to produce the amenity
[2:10] praise God and so we're going to be
[2:13] looking at this rock today and then
[2:16] we're going to be entering into
[2:18] something that the Lord you know just
[2:20] just kind of moved in a peculiar way
[2:23] this week and just the way that all of
[2:27] this and so let's just Lord that we can
[2:38] just the Living God present God the
[2:43] mighty angel Lord that you have the
[2:45] president ministry the stage and the
[2:48] time of the season of your history Lord
[2:51] that could bring us a reality of the
[2:53] presence it brings clarity and oh god it
[2:57] brings fear Lord brings such such a
[3:04] awesome experience and in the woods any
[3:12] describe father because you are God Lord
[3:17] you if you are supernatural and your
[3:22] word comes by faith as a supernatural
[3:25] experience for the sons and daughters of
[3:28] God so this morning Lord as we assemble
[3:31] around you and you word your presence
[3:34] will got me you just blew the side of
[3:36] the speaker
[3:37] move aside - here let me actually Buse
[3:41] of God that are never expressed from
[3:44] that mighty anvil from glory this
[3:46] morning may they come together Oh God
[3:49] and they may there be such a powerful
[3:53] yeah heavily gathering this morning the
[3:56] angels of God even appear in this
[3:58] morning and those Lord that that have
[4:01] gone before us O God because they
[4:03] without us cannot be made perfect Oh God
[4:06] may this be a Assembly of the sons and
[4:10] daughters of God and the power and the
[4:12] anointing of the Holy Spirit in every
[4:16] area in every aspect in every life and
[4:18] bring every demon power subject to your
[4:22] word this morning every chain that
[4:25] hinders the people they can be broken
[4:27] this morning every blind demon that
[4:30] would try to hinder the people from
[4:33] receiving Lord what they need to see in
[4:35] the Word of God this morning may the
[4:38] chains be broken
[4:39] may the shackles be loosed I'm going on
[4:42] may the house of God so sweep into the
[4:44] house this morning lower that the people
[4:46] would be set free liberated that they
[4:49] could see who they are already because
[4:52] this is who we are this is why you
[4:54] called us brethren we pray O God
[4:57] remember our posture blessing
[4:59] prostrating watch children in the name
[5:01] of Jesus Christ bring them safely home
[5:03] Lord we commit this
[5:06] in Jesus a lesser sense according as he
[5:14] hath chosen us in here before the
[5:19] foundations of the world that we should
[5:23] be holy and without blame before
[5:26] everything love having predestinated us
[5:30] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[5:34] Christ to himself according to the good
[5:39] pleasure of his friend the Lord has
[5:43] blessed us for you see this one the
[5:55] Praxis here in the rapture message it
[5:58] says but to the church the bride the
[6:03] rapture is a revelation to her it's
[6:06] revealed to her that the revelation the
[6:09] true Bride of Christ will be waiting for
[6:15] that revelation of the rapture a member
[6:18] now why did it recognize what he's
[6:21] saying here that he's saying that there
[6:22] is and that there was to come a
[6:25] revelation to the bride of Jesus Christ
[6:28] because we know that the day that we're
[6:30] living in is the day where the private
[6:33] Christ
[6:34] the true church because there's
[6:37] thousands of churches out there okay and
[6:40] we're not we're not putting some kind
[6:42] enough emphasis on us we're not putting
[6:48] an emphasis on who we are this little
[6:50] church here good neighbor
[6:52] history's or some kind of an emphasis on
[6:55] this organization that we are a part of
[6:58] good neighbor of ministries we are
[6:59] talking about the Church of the Living
[7:02] God we're talking about
[7:05] because God talks about the proc maybe
[7:08] the bride is the wife of Christ the true
[7:11] church and there can only be one bride
[7:14] that there only be one true church
[7:16] everything listen there's only one
[7:19] original daughter everything else that's
[7:22] counterfeit everything else is
[7:25] counterfeit except the original and so
[7:29] if we believe that God is God and that
[7:32] his word is true and that he's not going
[7:35] to change his word and that he said that
[7:37] there is going to be my bride that
[7:40] there's going to be a true church that
[7:42] there's only gonna be one it's that
[7:45] simple
[7:46] now out of all the churches that are up
[7:48] there and you were scattered in all
[7:51] kinds of different churches they were
[7:53] scattered in all kinds of different
[7:55] teachings all kinds of different
[7:57] interpretations of the word of god but
[8:00] God called you because like we just read
[8:05] he's not a church he's not a people he's
[8:09] not sons and daughters of God that he is
[8:12] going to adopt that he is going to
[8:15] to this church and purpose will
[8:33] teachings and doctrines we've got
[8:37] thousands of different interpretations
[8:39] now that Christianity let alone all the
[8:42] different sects and different religions
[8:44] and teachings and all kinds of different
[8:47] interpretations on God we're not
[8:50] interested in that we're interested in
[8:52] what he said in his word that there
[8:54] would be a church and that going be sons
[8:57] and there would be daughters and that he
[8:59] would be adopting them to show that
[9:03] these were his children here like we
[9:08] talked about when somebody goes and
[9:10] adopts a child no no this is not what
[9:14] we're talking about this plan of God was
[9:18] already finished before that you read
[9:21] the scripture it said from being for the
[9:25] nations of the world
[9:29] well you know what boy I look into that
[9:32] church and that girl get all Sidney and
[9:35] that young man there john-boy there are
[9:38] Christians there doing a good job
[9:40] they're out on the mission fields
[9:42] they're doing great things
[9:44] you know what the scripture says without
[9:47] faith it is impossible to please stop
[9:53] baby so we're not looking at works
[9:55] yanti we're not looking at people's
[9:58] ability for the yams people of churches
[10:00] out there in this house
[10:06] [Music]
[10:23] oh yes because it's not that he's
[10:47] dealing with its that attribute that is
[10:50] talking back at home he's bringing back
[10:55] his church he's restoring that that he
[11:00] had work with you will be sons of God
[11:03] rejoice
[11:30] because Jesus resisted truth shall set
[11:51] you come on because he knows the people
[11:54] who are under bondage above there's a
[11:57] lot of you that are still under bondage
[11:59] because that accepted the truth the mud
[12:03] they're accepting some teaching some
[12:05] doctrine interpretation
[12:16] [Applause]
[12:20] [Music]
[12:37] [Music]
[12:40] [Applause]
[13:10] [Music]
[13:17] [Music]
[13:19] scripture verses seven eight though I
[13:31] walk in the midst of truth somebody fall
[13:39] here though the bark in the midst of
[13:44] trouble some need to be tried for this
[13:52] Russian God knows he needs to revive God
[13:57] knows he needs to wake up God knows he
[14:01] needs to take care that Schlemmer a
[14:04] condition that mental condition I don't
[14:06] know what it is for god knows what it is
[14:09] he says thou shalt stretch forth thy
[14:12] hand against the wrath of my enemies
[14:15] because Satan wants to bite you he was
[14:18] to chain you he wants to keep you under
[14:21] some kind of teaching some kind of
[14:24] denominational you know when you pop
[14:26] over to this church that church I don't
[14:28] care what church you will do you need to
[14:30] be born again
[14:45] yes at the end in the tribulation yes
[15:35] sir because they couldn't get hurt by
[15:37] this worm they come accept them in their
[15:41] dead
[15:44] [Music]
[15:50] they're a little bit fanatical that
[15:54] preacher is a little bit he's a little
[15:58] bit she loves the Lord too much talks
[16:01] about Jesus a little bit too much that's
[16:04] okay those that talked about Jesus we're
[16:09] only an animal the ones that were
[16:12] talking it at Shane poopoo heretic this
[16:15] a nap or a day and uh a lot of them were
[16:19] priests and Jesus went to them and says
[16:22] here up your father and their father
[16:30] Jesus
[16:32] [Music]
[16:40] [Music]
[16:48] [Music]
[16:58] and that's why Jesus when they stood in
[17:02] there and all the Pharisees that they
[17:04] were talking to him and they were saying
[17:06] we are the seed of Abraham we are the
[17:10] children of Abraham we know God but he
[17:13] he says if you were Abraham's seed which
[17:19] is a supernatural see it wasn't that he
[17:45] ate it was a deception it wasn't a pair
[17:51] on the tree or a fruit it was a pair on
[17:54] the ground and they made love and that
[17:58] serpent beguiled Eve and brought forth
[18:01] serpent seed and which is the
[18:03] characteristic that every one of us is
[18:05] born and simply you're born in sin
[18:09] because the character and the nature
[18:11] that was injected into Eve and that's
[18:14] why Cain killed his brother because he
[18:17] was of this father and death
[18:37] [Music]
[18:44] [Music]
[18:46] your path has led to where you are today
[18:52] you can look back on your path of life
[18:55] and you can see so many things that took
[18:58] place in your life and if you are a son
[19:01] or daughter adult you know that you
[19:04] always you know never with the rest they
[19:13] just knew you were a little bit
[19:14] different you were little bit like just
[19:16] just go in the most barriers and then
[19:20] somehow thanks what happened but
[19:23] intercede and intervening your life and
[19:25] you just and you didn't know
[19:38] back on my life it's like a rope you
[19:42] know and I just you know love me because
[19:44] but when I was looking into this yellow
[19:46] you know just reflect on my life as I'm
[19:49] doing that you can see with God
[19:53] intervened where he was just moving I
[19:56] remember you know as a young man just in
[20:00] school and I was there I remember the
[20:03] classroom I can still see it as clear as
[20:06] a bell I was sitting there at tennis
[20:09] with my head and I was there and I was
[20:11] just all of a sudden I just wasn't in
[20:13] the room anymore and I've got this
[20:15] presence that I could not explain it
[20:18] just it just possibly us to think why am
[20:22] I here what am I doing here and and that
[20:26] was an experience that never left it was
[20:31] realized because his spirit inside he
[20:43] was a part of God he could never leave
[20:46] it he was always with it and then till
[20:49] you started to grow up and he started to
[20:51] go things and I remember getting my
[20:53] first job my first job was at Caravan
[20:56] trips it was a manufacturing company and
[21:00] their staple their third third or local
[21:03] was three cameras and they were making I
[21:07] got a job there was one summer before
[21:09] College my first year of college and I
[21:12] decided you know what I'm going to work
[21:14] through it and and it was a full-time
[21:16] job it was a good-paying job I thought
[21:18] all this is good so I stayed there and
[21:21] then they offered me a promotion by the
[21:23] end of the summer and I was rich
[21:26] I looked at the I looked at college I
[21:30] thought about money and I got school I'm
[21:35] in high school within four years of
[21:43] being on that company I got to know the
[21:46] owner of the company very well we kind
[21:48] of just took me under this way his name
[21:52] was Gabriel alter he sent me within four
[21:57] years to the office right next and
[22:00] spending hundreds of thousands of
[22:03] dollars into buying and purchasing rough
[22:06] material for the company at 20 years old
[22:10] I was trying to the local sudden
[22:23] something came on me that I had to be a
[22:25] male but during that time while I was in
[22:28] care man under the leadership of Gabriel
[22:31] alter I went by Rebecca and she was
[22:37] there I heard nobody that there was a
[22:39] new secretary in the office
[22:47] [Music]
[23:02] because some of you up there and I
[23:09] started to look around I was looking for
[23:11] her and then I looked into that corner
[23:14] over there and she was standing at the
[23:16] bottom cap and I remember she looked and
[23:21] I flash of light like a flash of that
[23:27] woman I didn't understand it I just put
[23:29] it away as though stuff I figured wash
[23:34] it or something no it was two attributes
[23:40] was a purpose you look back into the
[23:46] lives you will see were God how do you
[23:48] were I was dealing with you or God was
[23:50] around you yeah it's over there we move
[24:02] done and I went into my home business
[24:05] and I went off on my own and I had some
[24:08] serious ups and major downs and it was
[24:15] 1991 that Bob decided to take everything
[24:20] because it was getting closer to that
[24:23] time where he was not a place he was
[24:26] when a position he was the brilliant
[24:29] revelation to I'm just using this
[24:34] sample season but I want you to see that
[24:37] God's hand is upon your life and the God
[24:40] has a purpose for each and every son
[24:43] you're not an accent I hear he decided
[24:47] that he was gonna see said everything
[24:50] God he wiped out everything I that God
[24:54] had all stretched there was some real
[24:56] statement about doing all kinds of
[24:59] things he said God I remember sitting at
[25:04] the vet Michaels crying this is a young
[25:07] baby just born 1991 he was born
[25:10] Christina just a young child I was
[25:12] sitting on a bed contemplating how I
[25:15] would end my life because it was a mess
[25:20] and I just remember looking up and where
[25:23] my ceiling I said if there's a god I
[25:25] need you that's all I remember
[25:28] and then it was a whirlwind from that
[25:32] point on the next three years and then
[25:34] another
[26:11] [Music]
[26:27] I'd see my friends in church on Sunday
[26:31] and Saturday negative with a different
[26:33] woman I knew the kind of like I knew it
[26:37] was a hypocritical life that's good
[26:40] he says here and he handed me a tape he
[26:43] was 1957 brother banner topical all get
[26:47] knocked off his horse but see had chains
[27:00] and his time that was changed
[27:04] and buck took that path of life and
[27:08] moved it into another direction for
[27:11] years this is going to be hard with a
[27:32] duck this is what's under that heart
[27:35] attack one day just that's how I figured
[27:37] that I would go because when you got so
[27:39] high your heart would race to the point
[27:52] [Applause]
[28:03] [Applause]
[28:14] [Applause]
[28:25] [Music]
[28:26] [Applause]
[28:35] [Applause]
[28:37] yeah all the time comes around and he
[28:40] tries to put on pants but when God comes
[28:44] into here my color so real
[28:48] [Music]
[28:53] [Applause]
[29:09] yes which concerns at 7:00
[29:14] well the battery just emergency that's
[29:19] why please do this edge here program
[29:30] speaking I took a bunch of calls from
[29:33] the adoption series I just I rejoiced
[29:38] around this week all my business you get
[29:42] a chance go back and feed on the
[29:44] adoption the series is absolutely
[29:47] incredible
[29:48] there are things in there were stored up
[29:58] in the world of data problem he had
[30:01] given me everything that we have so that
[30:06] when the time
[30:08] - and out of the table the fivefold
[30:11] ministry because let's get this thing
[30:17] straight
[30:18] this is a 20th century profit so that
[30:29] the word can be restored so that the
[30:31] hearts of the children could be turned
[30:34] back to the faith and so he started all
[30:42] this food so for the five fold ministry
[30:46] was the inspiration of my experiences
[30:59] just listening to the words I hope
[31:02] you're placing yourself
[31:44] but we just feel the baby at this point
[31:48] at this time it might be good to come to
[31:51] bring the church so what I think to a
[31:54] complete understanding position you know
[31:59] that if you're not exactly in the right
[32:01] position the word before
[32:05] that's right brother Brad had visions
[32:09] and he would have to wait for everything
[32:13] to come and he was praying for a person
[32:18] one day somebody had to walk in with a
[32:21] half and put that back down and do
[32:24] certain things and then he turned on
[32:27] saying thus saith the Lord
[32:28] you can rise up
[32:30] we just got past the plan and God has
[32:34] sons and daughters of God that need to
[32:36] be positionally placed in the word so
[32:40] that the other side shoot with them so
[32:50] that all those things that he
[32:52] experienced can come to pass me and you
[32:55] were in that crowd gotta get into your
[32:57] possession you need to be adopted so he
[33:03] says here a complete understanding
[33:05] essentially of what we are in Christ
[33:09] Jesus and sometimes I think that
[33:12] preaching is a wonderful thing but these
[33:15] effects by the dealer that teaching goes
[33:17] beyond that and company especially to
[33:20] the church looks like and then if God
[33:27] has sent us to be okay now preachy
[33:39] easily captures the center brings him
[33:42] under condemnation by the word but
[33:46] teaching places places where I love
[33:52] teaching this morning
[33:53] [Music]
[34:15] [Music]
[34:37] [Music]
[34:51] [Music]
[34:58] - because investors
[35:10] [Music]
[35:19] [Applause]
[35:21] is the mobile you are yes to know what's
[35:25] message that you need to follow what
[35:28] church you need to belong to is not a
[35:31] church for the Piedmont unless it says
[35:35] Jesus body of Christ because that is the
[35:42] church there's a lot of people in here
[35:45] and every Church these three types of
[35:46] Muslims adopt the true believer you've
[35:50] done and that's in every Church but the
[35:57] true believer she wants to know Jesus
[36:00] because that's what this is all about
[36:02] this is the revelation that God gave you
[36:05] that gave you the faith to come and
[36:08] assemble under this revelation to feed
[36:10] on this you can't be anything else you
[36:14] go out there and sing about this church
[36:16] the Catholic Church the one that called
[36:31] you is the one that's continuing to give
[36:34] you the bank to keep pressing
[37:22] [Applause]
[37:32] [Applause]
[37:44] and now the Christ in the church is just
[37:49] being made the whole thing is the
[37:52] revelation of God to take back
[37:56] everything we talked about back in the
[37:58] dark you see how that had to take part
[38:03] of her sin in order to redeem her back
[38:10] just like Jesus had to take on simple
[38:14] flesh and come to this earth and died on
[38:18] a cross so that even we do and bring
[38:21] back is the church the true church
[38:26] that's why you know there's all kinds of
[38:29] teachings up there you could spend days
[38:31] on YouTube with all these different
[38:37] interpretations the world how it began
[38:43] they talked about there's all kinds of
[38:46] different teachings you know ancient
[38:48] teachings the world is ten million years
[38:51] old ten thousand years old those events
[38:53] of lugia destruction eleven thousand
