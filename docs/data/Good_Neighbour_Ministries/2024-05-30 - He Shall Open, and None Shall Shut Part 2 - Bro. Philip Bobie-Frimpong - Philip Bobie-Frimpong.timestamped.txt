[23:20] about to come you couldn't find you
[23:21] couldn't print it the printer has been

[23:38] not going
[23:39] to worry about
[23:42] it the enemy is just always try to what
[23:48] distract but you have to ignore his
[23:50] distractions and move on Amen Hallelujah
[23:55] okay so our scripture
[23:57] tonight is taken from I have three
[23:59] scriptures and then I'm going to
[24:02] continue what we started on the May
[24:06] 15
[24:08] um okay so three scriptures Matthew 171
[24:13] to13 Hebrews
[24:15] 122 and Revelation
[24:19] 3:7 okay Matthew
[24:23] 171-3 and after 6 days Jesus thed people
[24:30] James and
[24:31] John his brother and bringing them up
[24:34] into an high mountain
[24:37] apart and was transed before them and
[24:41] his face this shine as the sun and his
[24:44] rment was white as the
[24:46] light and behold there appeared unto
[24:50] them Moses and leas talking with
[24:55] them then answered Peter and
[24:59] said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us
[25:02] to be here if thou will let us make here
[25:07] three
[25:08] Tabernacles one for thee and one for
[25:12] Moses and one for
[25:16] elas
[25:18] then then answered Peter and said
[25:22] on while he yet spake Behold a bright
[25:27] Cloud overshadowed them them and behold
[25:30] a voice out of the cloud which said this
[25:32] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[25:36] pleased hear ye him I'm going
[25:40] to stress more on the verse five and
[25:44] when the disciples heard it they fell on
[25:46] their face and were so afraid and Jesus
[25:50] came and touched them and said arise and
[25:53] be not afraid and when they had lifted
[25:56] up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus
[26:02] only and as they came that the become
[26:06] more understanding with time and you
[26:08] read it becomes so I don't know how to
[26:10] express it but this Bible has become a
[26:12] new Bible to me and as they came down
[26:15] from the mountain Jesus shed them saying
[26:19] tell the vision to know man until the
[26:22] son of mine be raisen again from the
[26:24] dead and his disciples asked him saying
[26:28] why then say the scribes that elas must
[26:31] first
[26:32] come and Jesus answered and said unto
[26:35] them elas truly shall first come and
[26:38] restore all things but I see unto you
[26:42] that elas is come already and they knew
[26:46] him not but they have done unto him
[26:48] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[26:51] also the son of man suffer of them then
[26:54] they understood that he spoke unto them
[26:56] of John the Baptist Hebrews
[27:12] 122 looking onto this say the author and
[27:15] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[27:18] that was set before him endured the
[27:20] cross
[27:22] despising the shame and he sat down at
[27:24] the right hand of the Throne of God and
[27:26] then the same scripture last week
[27:30] Revelation 3:7 and to the angel of the
[27:33] Church of in Philadelphia WR these
[27:36] things said he that is Holy he that is
[27:39] true he that had the Key of David he
[27:43] that open it and no man shout it and
[27:46] shout it and no man open it that'll be
[27:49] my part two of what I did last week
[27:52] Heavenly Father may you bless the
[27:54] reading of their word in the name of our
[27:56] Lord Jesus Christ amen please be
[28:04] seated
[28:14] okay um so I'm going to recap a little
[28:16] bit from the previous week we talk about
[28:20] he that open it and no one can sh it and
[28:23] when you sh it no one can open it and
[28:26] you talk about how
[28:28] God reveal himself to an individual it's
[28:31] not he that rth but God who is rich in
[28:35] Mercy and then we concluded in Isaiah
[28:38] 20:22 saying that he that he shall open
[28:42] and no one can shut and he that shut no
[28:45] one can open he has it on his shoulder
[28:48] that means that he took a responsibility
[28:51] of ourselves like when you get married
[28:54] and you take a responsibility of that
[28:56] woman he took all
[28:58] responsibilities came and died on
[29:01] Calvary Forest so I'm just going to
[29:03] still read the same quote that I read
[29:05] then I go on my thing the other day I
[29:09] was talking and we were thinking of
[29:12] scriptures um pama's local canum caterp
[29:18] paragraph
[29:21] 55 there it is and happened to and I
[29:24] happen to think I don't care how clear
[29:28] it is how much the scripture teaches it
[29:31] you'll never be able to say it until God
[29:34] himself show it to you don't care how
[29:38] clear it is and the whole Bible is built
[29:42] and the whole Church of the Living God
[29:44] is built upon a spiritual revelation of
[29:47] the word why did Abel offer a more
[29:50] excellent sacrifice than Kain why didn't
[29:54] Abel follow Kain he had most beautiful
[29:57] ch
[29:58] but it was revealed to him when Jesus
[30:01] came from man transgression and they
[30:03] said who th man say I the son of am one
[30:07] said elas and one said you are prophet
[30:09] and so forth he said but who do you say
[30:13] I am Peter said thou are the Christ the
[30:15] son of the Living God he said blessed
[30:17] art thou Simon the son of Jonas for
[30:20] Flesh and Blood never revealed this to
[30:23] you you never learn it with some books
[30:26] or some seminaries or s station of man M
[30:29] schem but my Father in Heaven has
[30:32] revealed that to you and upon this Ro I
[30:36] will build my church and the Gates of
[30:38] Hell cannot Prevail against it there you
[30:40] are spiritual revelation of the word of
[30:44] God and then you also talk about for you
[30:47] it is given to what understand the
[30:51] mystery of the Kingdom to them it's not
[30:53] given so what I'm trying to say is that
[30:57] um as you read scriptures
[30:59] remember God does not deal with the
[31:02] majority he deals with individual who
[31:04] have a pure heart and when he has a
[31:08] church of 500 one day he said except you
[31:11] eat of My Flesh and drink my blood you
[31:14] have no part in me and they left it was
[31:17] left with 70 and he said the son of man
[31:20] who is now standing here in heaven and
[31:24] they say they never heard this saying so
[31:26] they left him and it was left with 12
[31:29] and one of them was a devil and then in
[31:31] man transgression it has three of them
[31:35] John Peter and James and that was hope
[31:39] faith and uh charity then the crowd th
[31:44] down later on then he asked them who do
[31:47] you say I am the son of man I am so
[31:50] right now it became individual from 500
[31:54] to to to 70 to 12 to three and then it
[31:59] has th down to you as an individual
[32:03] tonight who do you say this
[32:08] is what time are you living in what part
[32:12] of the scripture are you
[32:14] fulfilling what is going doing in his
[32:18] present day
[32:20] Ministry who do you say this is this is
[32:24] not a group Affair it's an
[32:28] individual Affair God call us
[32:30] individually going to face him
[32:32] individually one time there was a
[32:35] somebody that um somebody winess to I
[32:38] think winess to him I did not know I met
[32:42] him at the library and he was telling
[32:44] that oh that church everything they
[32:47] spoke is truth but I brought my wife he
[32:50] prayed for me and my wife came from
[32:52] Africa over here and my wife doesn't
[32:55] like the church so I'm going to stay
[32:57] home home and follow my wife to bring
[32:59] peace and I said brother we don't do it
[33:02] that way because you as an individual is
[33:05] going to face God you are not going to
[33:08] face god with your
[33:10] wife you take the stand and God who
[33:14] created that wife of yours is more than
[33:16] able to turn him to turn her around but
[33:19] you first have to stand for the word of
[33:22] God it's a test to you because listen is
[33:27] good to have a wonderful family in this
[33:30] life but no wonder the scripture said
[33:32] that I rather go to heaven with one
[33:35] Blind Eye than to have all my eyes and
[33:39] miss this eternal life miss this heaven
[33:43] so nothing in this life can be compared
[33:47] to the Salvation of our soul when it
[33:50] comes to Salvation an individual this is
[33:53] life and death you don't compromise it
[33:56] on your wife or your husband or your
[33:59] children or anyone else this is you and
[34:02] God it is me I standing here in the need
[34:05] of prayer me that need the grace of God
[34:09] in my life every day it's me that I'm
[34:12] asking God for his abundance Grace it's
[34:15] me I'm standing here needing God it's
[34:18] not you and your brother it's not you
[34:21] this thing he said two in the B I'll
[34:24] take one and I'll leave one
[34:27] the crowd is
[34:30] thinning we don't have to
[34:33] joke with our Salvation this thing God
[34:37] has given to us is more than the whole
[34:39] world no wonder he says that when one
[34:42] Soul
[34:44] repented the whole Heavenly Host
[34:47] Rejoice this is an individual
[34:52] Affair is not a group and it's never
[34:56] going to be a group
[34:58] so let's serve God the best that we can
[35:03] whilst we have our
[35:06] living amen praise our
[35:10] God
[35:11] hallelujah
[35:13] amen thank you Jesus our God is
[35:19] good
[35:21] amen yes and
[35:23] then I'll come back to the scripture
[35:26] that we read
[35:28] in Matthew 17 verse4 I think verse three
[35:33] and behold there appeared unto them
[35:36] Moses and elas talking with him then
[35:40] answered Peter and said unto him Jesus
[35:43] Lord it is good for us to be here he was
[35:46] excited amen so many times we get
[35:49] excited when we have revelation God
[35:52] reveals them to the excitement becomes
[35:54] so great and I believe that Peter was
[35:56] excited he's always been excited anyway
[35:59] amen and he said if thou will let
[36:04] us make their three
[36:08] Tabernacles one for
[36:10] thee one for Moses and one for
[36:15] elas while he yet
[36:19] spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed
[36:23] them which Behold a voice out of the
[36:25] cloud said this is my beloved Son hear
[36:30] ye him in other words Peter was trying
[36:34] to make a tabernacle or make um a
[36:38] worship whatever to to what for Moses
[36:41] and Moses what the law Giver before
[36:45] Genesis before Exodus 19 they did not
[36:48] have a law God gave them Grace by a
[36:50] prophet pillow of fire and everything
[36:53] and they asked for the Lord because
[36:54] remember when God called Abraham
[36:58] he gave him unconditional what Covenant
[37:01] unlike Adam and Eve said that if thou do
[37:04] this if thou do this if thou do not do
[37:07] not partake of the tree if you partake
[37:09] of a tree this will happen that will
[37:11] happen but when it came to Abraham God
[37:14] gave him what an unconditional covenant
[37:17] not Abraham do this or that but I God
[37:20] have done it all so being a royal Seed
[37:23] of Abraham we have the same Covenant of
[37:27] Grace it's not what you have done or
[37:29] what I have done but the grace of God
[37:31] but the children of Israel because they
[37:34] wanted to have something to do with it
[37:38] so they asked for the law and they
[37:40] couldn't keep the
[37:42] law because the LA will always point you
[37:45] to your mistakes to be a sinner what the
[37:47] that's what the Lord does it point you
[37:49] to the school Master follow this thou
[37:53] shall not do this thou shall not do that
[37:55] th shall not do this and even in this
[37:57] this message a lot of people I'm afraid
[38:01] a lot of people are following this word
[38:03] without their own personal
[38:06] revelation because somebody tell them
[38:09] wear a long skirt they wear the long
[38:12] skirt don't cut your head they don't cut
[38:14] it's all good and the man put on nice
[38:17] suit nice pants it's all good to dress
[38:20] right but somewhere braah was even
[38:23] saying that if I tell you do not wear
[38:25] pants and some something in your heart
[38:29] do not tell you don't do do do that
[38:32] don't do it do it of revelation of
[38:36] understanding when God reveal it to you
[38:38] and you understand what you are doing
[38:41] then you can stand on
[38:43] it because then you know what you are
[38:48] doing just like the Hebrew children they
[38:52] knew what they were doing they know who
[38:53] they were following so when the time
[38:56] came that they said they were going to
[38:59] bend them because they have a revelation
[39:02] of God that they are serving they could
[39:04] stand there and said that we know our
[39:08] God is able to deliver us but even if he
[39:12] chose not to you are not going to bow
[39:15] down to that image so it is a true
[39:19] Christian who has had understanding of
[39:21] the word of God he doesn't follow it by
[39:24] the
[39:25] law because no one can follow The Ten
[39:28] Commandments that's why he said that my
[39:32] yoke is easy he that is heavy laden come
[39:36] unto me and I will give you rest into
[39:39] your soul that rest is the Holy Ghost
[39:42] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost in you
[39:44] will help you to overcome because it's
[39:47] not by power or by might but by my
[39:50] spirit says the Lord so when the spirit
[39:53] of Christ in you there the his Spirit
[39:56] who is the ho holy ghost that will help
[39:59] you to overcome that will help you to
[40:01] live beyond this flesh that will help
[40:04] you to overcome things that you
[40:07] naturally cannot overcome because we
[40:10] ourselves we cannot do it but with the
[40:13] grace of God with the help of Christ in
[40:16] us he help us to overcome our our
[40:20] Temptations to overcome things that we
[40:22] cannot overcome so what the people need
[40:25] most is to be born again to have the
[40:28] true revelation of the word of God for
[40:31] their day so that they can live what
[40:34] walking in the line of God because they
[40:36] are not being told what to
[40:39] do they are doing it from the depth of
[40:42] their heart it's just like paying tight
[40:46] just like coming to church just like
[40:49] praying just like um fasting all those
[40:52] things are good but has to be done with
[40:54] a revelation because we doing all those
[40:58] things out from the depth of your heart
[41:00] to love of God with faith you know what
[41:03] you are
[41:04] doing then you don't look at your
[41:06] circumstances and look at your pocket
[41:09] and look at the bills and said oh my
[41:11] paycheck is maybe $100 how can I pay $10
[41:15] with this economic condition but if you
[41:17] have a revelation you know that it's God
[41:20] who gave you the strength even to go to
[41:22] work it's God who has given your health
[41:24] tonight it's God who is protecting you
[41:27] it's God he that started that good work
[41:29] in you is able to take you the end so
[41:32] you don't look at your circumstances but
[41:35] you look at the promise of God and
[41:37] Believe on what that word said because
[41:39] that word is your
[41:41] absolute so nothing
[41:44] else should hinder you by pleasing God
[41:48] that's what the Bible said that it's
[41:50] impossible to please God without what
[41:52] faith and faith is a revelation by it
[41:56] all the elders he gave us s Samson of of
[42:00] Abraham every one of them they were only
[42:03] able to please God by faith so the thing
[42:07] has to revealed to you know our Pastor
[42:09] said all the time when God asked Abel to
[42:13] make that sacrifice there was no Bible
[42:16] written but by inspiration from God he
[42:20] was able to what offer an excellent
[42:23] sacrifice so with that inspiration from
[42:26] God you cannot please him he said no one
[42:29] comes to the father except I draw him
[42:31] first you are predestinated you are part
[42:34] of him you are elected so elected child
[42:37] or daughter of God God will reveal
[42:40] himself to you he won't hide himself
[42:44] from you when the time comes for you to
[42:47] know he will make it plain to you
[42:49] because he's the same yesterday today
[42:52] and forever as he did to the elders
[42:54] you're going to do it to you and to me
[42:57] God hasn't changed amen he will never
[43:00] forsake you nor leave you amen so back
[43:05] to what Peter said he wanted to build
[43:08] another Tabernacle for Elijah Elijah was
[43:12] Justice judgment God's justice I don't I
[43:17] cannot stand God Justice or God judgment
[43:21] I want his grace and grace and grace
[43:25] alone the Judgment of of God the jti of
[43:28] God that's why the Bible said that he
[43:30] that believe on me has has has passed
[43:33] from Death unto life and shall not come
[43:36] into what any
[43:38] condemnation amen you cannot do by our
[43:42] own righteousness he said your own
[43:44] righteousness is like onto F racks but
[43:48] his
[43:49] righteousness it helps you to live above
[43:51] sin so Christ who is righteous God
[43:55] living his righteous life through you it
[43:58] makes everything become simple so we are
[44:00] not asking God for law or for justice
[44:06] but I want the grace of God grace and
[44:10] grace alone the Capstone the cry it went
[44:14] on the capsu was Grace The Headstone
[44:18] Grace Grace Grace Grace is UN merited
[44:22] favor something that you and I have not
[44:25] worked to what to Merit
[44:27] it because the law the children of
[44:30] Israel they follow every bit of the law
[44:35] but when Christ the word came they could
[44:39] not recognize him they were emphasizing
[44:43] more on washing of their caps of
[44:47] their uh catary all those things and
[44:53] that was all good but when the effect of
[44:57] perfection came they said one time why
[45:00] your disciples eat with um unwashed
[45:03] hands he told them it's not what goes
[45:06] into the mouth not what it's not what um
[45:10] goes into the mouth that def a man but
[45:14] what comes out of the man that defies
[45:16] them not the washing of the hands but is
[45:19] the
[45:20] inside inside because that's why we are
[45:24] Sav from the inside out the do is wash
[45:27] from the inside or cleanses it from the
[45:29] inside and they were emphasing too much
[45:33] on the
[45:34] outside do not do this in Africa
[45:37] somewhere it have become so bad that the
[45:40] women they think because they don't cut
[45:44] they don't H do do anything to their
[45:46] head they make it natural that qualifies
[45:49] them to go to the Rapture
[45:51] no if you do not want to keep your hair
[45:56] naturally that's fine but don't use it
[45:59] as a
[46:01] doctrine that is what is
[46:03] happening a lot of people are using the
[46:07] word something that they feel
[46:10] comfortable to do to be a doctrine that
[46:13] shall not do this you have to do this
[46:15] you have to do that
[46:17] no if it's good for you do it like
[46:20] vegetarian if you want to eat your vegan
[46:22] go ahead and eat it don't push it on me
[46:28] that's what is going on with all these
[46:30] genders whatever gender you want to have
[46:32] is your pro it's your problem you want
[46:34] to be this gender that's fine don't push
[46:36] it on me lead me to live my
[46:39] life and do what God has revealed to me
[46:42] as individual to do it's not a
[46:45] collective H it's individual work with
[46:48] the
[46:48] Gentiles so those things are all
[46:51] good but don't make it as a law
[46:57] and put it on the
[47:00] people that's what is happening out
[47:02] there but God has set us free the blood
[47:05] of Christ has set us free from all
[47:07] things you are free whom the son of man
[47:10] has set free is free and free indeed you
[47:14] can eat anything said let no one judge
[47:16] you in meat or in anything you bless it
[47:19] and eat it I'm not saying that you have
[47:21] to eat um unconcern you have to be
[47:24] selective what but just the main
[47:27] emphasis is bless your food and eat it
[47:31] that's it don't let nobody judge you by
[47:33] what you
[47:35] eat just try the best to e the best that
[47:38] you can because the system and
[47:40] everything is not good but let no one
[47:42] judge you you have to do what God
[47:46] revealed to you and it became so bad
[47:49] that even our own brother Peter hide and
[47:52] go and meet with the Gentiles and Paul
[47:54] has to rebuke him
[47:57] you
[47:58] see it's easy for the people to
[48:02] what um criticize it criticize that but
[48:06] they don't look into themselves to see
[48:09] what where they stand what that somewh
[48:12] they said that he that tells you don't
[48:13] steal does he steal he that tell does he
[48:17] do all
[48:18] that is no more law we pass from law to
[48:24] Grace he who is doing it is it's not you
[48:27] or me it's God's Grace Grace Grace Grace
[48:33] Grace that is greater than all my sins
[48:37] Grace that will take us through
[48:40] hallelujah amen praise our God our God
[48:45] is
[48:45] good amen thank you Jesus I'm still over
[48:50] here and verse
[48:54] seven and Jesus came and touched them
[48:57] and said arise and be not afraid and
[49:00] when they had lifted up their eyes they
[49:03] saw no man save what Jesus holy amen
[49:08] Jesus
[49:09] holy it is Jesus Hallelujah he has
[49:14] touched the Hem of my garment and his
[49:16] blood has made me whole when the eyes
[49:20] were open it was only on Jesus we thank
[49:24] God for sending us
[49:27] Vindicated Prophet Malachi
[49:31] 456 Revelation 10:7 Amos
[49:34] 37 God s with the power and
[49:37] demonstration of the Holy Ghost apart
[49:39] from the ministry of the Lord Jesus
[49:41] Christ never happened on the face of
[49:43] this Earth brother William myON Braham
[49:48] to reveal the seven SE and all those
[49:51] things but when you look in John
[49:54] somewhere he said that arm your fellow
[49:56] servant worship God we worship the Lord
[50:01] Jesus Christ and we thank God for
[50:04] sending us a prophet so that our eyes
[50:07] can see can have understanding of what
[50:10] is going on now but we are not
[50:12] worshipping the prophet we put him in
[50:15] his proper position know that he is a
[50:17] seventh
[50:19] angel but our our worship is only to the
[50:23] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he is every
[50:27] he pointed us to Christ he never pointed
[50:29] us to
[50:31] himself elas was a man subject to like
[50:34] we are he prayed endless that not rain
[50:37] and rain did not come he identifies us
[50:41] and everything that this message preach
[50:44] is pointing us to Christ never to
[50:48] himself and we thank God for him we
[50:51] thank God for the
[50:52] ministry but just like elazar and Isaac
[50:57] and Rebecca God sent his Prophet to find
[51:00] a bride like Ela found that Bride for
[51:03] Isaac and when elizar brought Rebecca to
[51:08] Isaac it was a love affair between
[51:11] Rebecca and Isaac so it's a love affair
[51:14] between the bride of Christ and the and
[51:17] Christ amen we thank God for the
[51:21] messenger we thank God for the
[51:24] message amen that has opened up eyes of
[51:27] understanding without this message none
[51:29] of us can know anything could have heard
[51:32] anything the godhead SE marriage and
[51:35] divorce all this things God used the
[51:37] prophet to make it plain to us and he
[51:40] that receive um give the prophet
[51:45] um prophet's reward refuse the receive
[51:48] the prophet's
[51:49] reward so we accept him and give him his
[51:53] place and thank God for him and God is
[51:56] going to give us that reward but we
[51:59] worship Jesus Christ it's Christ and
[52:02] Christ
[52:03] alone that's why if you check in the um
[52:08] future home of the Heavenly bride and
[52:10] Earthly messenger groom he said that God
[52:14] redeemed the Earth with what the same
[52:17] three stages and four stages
[52:19] justification sanctification baptism of
[52:21] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost himself
[52:23] like in the the in the Earth you tap is
[52:27] like Noah God sent the rain to justify
[52:30] the people at that time and then he came
[52:32] and shed his blood to Sanctified then
[52:36] another 6,000 the 6,000 years he's going
[52:38] to use what come and destroy all the
[52:41] atmosphere here then after that we go to
[52:43] the Millennium which the seven Church
[52:45] age and the Millennium we are going to
[52:48] work we're going to plant we're going to
[52:50] do everything but when he comes to in
[52:53] the new Earth and the new heaven Heep
[52:56] preparing from Heaven that thing that
[52:59] time with the time like the eighth
[53:01] messenger like the convocation the first
[53:03] day became L the the seven the seventh
[53:06] goes the eighth day like the first day
[53:10] and then the eighth day is like the
[53:11] first day again after the convocation
[53:14] the
[53:15] 5777 is 49 when it enter the 50th it
[53:19] goes back to day one and the Lord Jesus
[53:21] Christ rose up on the what the eth day
[53:25] so the Eighth Day is himself Eternal
[53:28] Church age messenger is Christ himself
[53:32] this no he has no man hands on it it's
[53:35] Christ Alone he is the one is our
[53:38] messenger he's the one leading us he's
[53:40] the one guiding us he's
[53:42] absolute amen he let all those seven
[53:46] churches ages do all that they can
[53:48] Luther Luther wesle Pentecost and and
[53:52] the and the
[53:53] Pentecostal but when it came to the E
[53:56] day day he said I go and prepare a place
[53:59] for you amen a new Heaven and new earth
[54:02] is God himself on the throne he share
[54:05] not his glory with anyone he's the Lord

[56:10] stries Billy you were healed he's the
[56:14] same yesterday today and
[56:17] forever that love of God if it wasn't
[56:20] for that labory where will you have been
[56:24] and if you see what he has done for us
[56:28] then it also should encourage us even
[56:31] love our enemies and pray for those who
[56:35] despitefully
[56:36] uses amen because God allow his reain to
[56:42] fall on the just and the
[56:46] unjust he didn't send a rain only for
[56:49] his just
[56:50] people for both just and unjust that
[56:54] means that we should also also
[56:57] what help and do good to anyone
[57:01] regardless first you help those in the
[57:05] same Faith but your good to the people
[57:09] outside there should not
[57:11] discriminate if they are not Christians
[57:13] so what help them
[57:18] anyhow because listen if you are living
[57:21] the time of Jesus and you are a
[57:24] Christian and May be before the teeth on
[57:27] the cross was on the cross and said
[57:29] remember
[57:31] me in his time if you had come and steal
[57:34] something from you or he has done
[57:35] something wrong with you if you are gone
[57:37] with your naked ey you C the man do
[57:40] everything but if you have the spirit of
[57:43] Christ no matter what the people has
[57:44] done for you
[57:47] just forgive them before he forgiv
[57:53] us forgiveness forgiveness is the key
[57:57] you don't forgive because someone tell
[57:59] you to forgive but unconsciously from
[58:02] your heart you forgive them then you get
[58:04] the
[58:05] blessing you pray if you can let God
[58:08] help you so that you can forgive the
[58:11] people from your
[58:13] heart because you don't know whom you
[58:17] are dealing with no
[58:19] wonder Steven said do not hold this
[58:24] charge on them
[58:26] because Paul at that time was Saul he
[58:30] was part of those who were persecuting
[58:32] Steven but the grace of God that was in
[58:36] steeven heart he asked God not to what
[58:41] hold it to their account forgive them
[58:45] for they do not know what they are
[58:49] doing so let's have forgiveness
[58:53] spirit and forgive the people regardless
[58:56] of what they do to
[58:58] us because our God he said if you do not
[59:01] forgive our heavenly father will also
[59:04] not forgive you your
[59:06] sins so how do you expect something from
[59:09] God when you hold something against
[59:10] somebody in your heart regardless what
[59:13] they have done for you you have to
[59:15] forgive amen our God is good I haven't
[59:19] even gone to um most of the things I
[59:21] want to say okay let's keep on going
[59:29] okay and
[59:31] then when and as they came down from
[59:34] verse 9 from
[59:36] Mountain Jesus shed them saying tell the
[59:39] vision to no man until the son of man be
[59:43] raisen again from the
[59:46] dead and his disciples asked him saying
[59:49] why
[59:51] then they
[59:54] say why then say the scribes that elas
[59:58] must first
[1:00:02] come you see even though the Disciples
[1:00:05] of Jesus Christ they walk with him they
[1:00:07] fish with him everything but they
[1:00:11] Mi that what Ministry of John the
[1:00:16] Baptist so they were asking him that if
[1:00:20] you are going to the cross and to be
[1:00:22] risen again then Elijah must first come
[1:00:26] before that thing
[1:00:28] happens
[1:00:29] scripturally but that thing has happened
[1:00:32] gone and they did not know it so it is
[1:00:37] happening in our time in our
[1:00:41] day God has sent a Vindicated Prophet to
[1:00:46] fulfill Malachi 4:56 Revelation 107 Amos
[1:00:50] 37 all those scriptures and the people
[1:00:54] in the denominational world they don't
[1:00:56] have a clue what has happened and this
[1:01:00] thing has happened and gone throughout
[1:01:01] the whole world only the elected
[1:01:05] few eyes have been open that's why to
[1:01:09] you it is given to know the mystery of
[1:01:13] the Kingdom to them it is not given so
[1:01:16] that the eyes is the eyes will what will
[1:01:20] not be open and their ears will not be
[1:01:23] what um their ears can cannot hear so
[1:01:26] they will not hear and their eyes will
[1:01:28] not be open to noise so that they can be
[1:01:31] converted but for you it is given to
[1:01:34] know the mystery of the Kingdom it's God
[1:01:39] who open your understanding and shatter
[1:01:42] the understanding of those dominal world
[1:01:45] so that alone should let you be what
[1:01:48] happy and move on say that you are
[1:01:51] precious in the eyes of the Living God
[1:01:54] Amen nothing should let you
[1:01:57] down and those denomination people their
[1:02:00] eyes have what shut Grace can you put on
[1:02:03] that quotation for me to read and go on
[1:02:05] with my word and then what am I saying
[1:02:09] when it an absolute verse 205
[1:02:13] to 200 to
[1:02:15] 205 and then when you come to even
[1:02:19] around the ranks of the message the
[1:02:21] Bible said many are called but few are
[1:02:24] chosen as the brother um said in last
[1:02:28] week that everyone that has received
[1:02:31] this message are called to recognize
[1:02:34] what the prophet is doing but the bride
[1:02:36] is within the message amen the same way
[1:02:40] they ask that the scripture say why do
[1:02:42] elas must first come so I'm afraid
[1:02:47] people around the scrope of the message
[1:02:50] one day those who are not the True by
[1:02:53] elest of God will wake up and said why
[1:02:57] does the scripture said Rapture must
[1:02:59] first come and the Rapture has come and
[1:03:02] gone and they did not know it no one I
[1:03:07] said that could be pass through like
[1:03:09] their nose and they won't even know know
[1:03:12] it but every scripture has been what
[1:03:18] fulfilled that's why he says somewhere
[1:03:21] that
[1:03:23] before there will be a drop of BB before
[1:03:27] this third word take place you'll be
[1:03:30] what you'll be caught up to be the Lord
[1:03:33] in the air there are so many
[1:03:36] scriptures
[1:03:38] that when that has to happen before the
[1:03:43] tribulation times it has to happen for
[1:03:45] the bride to go so those who are around
[1:03:49] the
[1:03:50] message that knows the letter this that
[1:03:53] that but do having got because he a
[1:03:56] foolish virgin and wise virgin all of
[1:04:00] them are Christians they all have done
[1:04:02] everything but the difference is what
[1:04:05] oil oil being the Revelation the true
[1:04:08] revelation of the word of God they don't
[1:04:11] have it but they have the letter said
[1:04:14] the letter kth but the spirit giveth
[1:04:18] life so they don't
[1:04:20] have that thing so that that piece of
[1:04:24] the Chinese G what come and C them up
[1:04:28] and take them to the the presence of God
[1:04:30] to that Rapture but they will recognized
[1:04:34] one day and they wake up and realize
[1:04:38] that that Rapture is gone because
[1:04:41] remember it's not going to be a public
[1:04:43] show he said two in the bed I'll take
[1:04:46] one and I'll leave one can put it on for
[1:04:48] me Grace and then it's not a many member
[1:04:53] body
[1:04:56] okay yeah there's isn't one thing left
[1:04:59] as I see in the prophet word one thing
[1:05:02] left one thing hindering that's not the
[1:05:05] one but that's okay one thing hindering
[1:05:07] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ this
[1:05:09] very hour not one thing left in the
[1:05:12] Bible everything that's not the one but
[1:05:15] that's fine everything has been
[1:05:18] fulfilled waiting now for the coming and
[1:05:21] how should we
[1:05:29] okay that's fine so what I'm trying to
[1:05:33] say is that by time they realize that
[1:05:36] everything is what is gone and then we
[1:05:39] be in the presence of the Lord
[1:05:42] hallelujah amen praise God
[1:05:46] hallelujah thank you
[1:05:49] Jesus
[1:05:51] hallelujah praise our wonderful God our
[1:05:54] God is good all the time Hallelujah okay
[1:05:58] just put the one that you put on for me
[1:05:59] to
[1:06:05] read just make it
[1:06:18] big so what I'm trying to say is that we
[1:06:21] have to be what ready every
[1:06:24] time no matter what comes our way we
[1:06:27] have to be ready just like um the sister
[1:06:31] who was one time going to um New York he
[1:06:35] was from
[1:06:36] Ireland going to New York and when she
[1:06:39] was going the ship the ship was about to
[1:06:42] sink and when that thing happened the
[1:06:46] people were panicking because remember
[1:06:48] before they were singing jazz and they
[1:06:50] were
[1:06:51] making they were dancing and everything
[1:06:53] the ship but then the captain told them
[1:06:56] in the next half an hour this ship is
[1:07:00] going to
[1:07:01] sink and right there the people stop
[1:07:05] from their just music to sing Amazing
[1:07:08] Grace when people see death are coming
[1:07:12] the attitude changed just like 911 when
[1:07:15] that thing happened all the Bible was
[1:07:17] told out in New York but within a what a
[1:07:20] month or two they forgot about
[1:07:22] everything so we have to pray
[1:07:26] up because Prayer Changes Things and if
[1:07:31] Prayer Changes Things why don't you pray
[1:07:34] pray and pray so that sister was what
[1:07:39] prayed up so the captain went to her and
[1:07:42] said that Hey sister what is going on
[1:07:46] everybody is shaking and sinking and you
[1:07:48] are laughing and as if nothing is
[1:07:51] happening and she told her that why
[1:07:54] should I worry said do you know what is
[1:07:55] happening she said yes I know this s
[1:07:59] this ship can sink in 30 minutes or we
[1:08:03] can overcome it and I'll be in New York
[1:08:06] so either this ship sink in 30 minutes
[1:08:10] I'm going to have two two daughters one
[1:08:12] of them is in glory so if this sink ship
[1:08:16] in 30 minutes I'm going to meet the one
[1:08:18] in glory if it does not sink and it
[1:08:22] survive the sink I'll be in New York
[1:08:25] I'll see my other daughter why should I
[1:08:27] worry so I'm telling you tonight why
[1:08:30] should you praise God we have this
[1:08:33] assurance because listen this is not the
[1:08:37] time that you going to say maybe just we
[1:08:41] have to be certain of God now the
[1:08:45] absence from here presence with the
[1:08:48] Lord it doesn't matter what you go
[1:08:51] through you have to be prayed up you
[1:08:53] have to be ready
[1:08:55] I know that absence from here going to
[1:08:58] be present with the Lord Death is what
[1:09:01] most people fear even the prophet job
[1:09:05] they were all scared of death but when
[1:09:07] the Lord Jesus Christ came he took the
[1:09:10] key of death that key from the devil he
[1:09:12] he conquered hell grave and and he
[1:09:16] conquered death health and Grave he
[1:09:18] conquered all three he said because I
[1:09:21] live you shall also live also so you
[1:09:24] shouldn't be
[1:09:26] sced of death in any day you should be
[1:09:30] ready because it can happen today or
[1:09:32] tomorrow any moment as brother Des
[1:09:35] always give an example that we were here
[1:09:37] with brother Daniel one Sunday the
[1:09:40] following Monday he was
[1:09:42] gone so we have to be
[1:09:46] ready no matter what we have to be ready
[1:09:50] and expect the coming of the Lord
[1:09:52] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:09:55] and forever amen our God is good we
[1:10:00] thank God for opening our eyes of
[1:10:02] understanding when he shut no one can
[1:10:05] open when he opens no one can shut and
[1:10:07] by his grace and mercy our eyes of
[1:10:11] understanding he has opened up at last
[1:10:13] amen and true jubilees this amen our God
[1:10:17] is great he's an awesome God he's the
[1:10:19] same yesterday today and forever amen so
[1:10:23] I'm going to conclude by saying that God
[1:10:27] has a purpose in Saving you and me he
[1:10:31] has a purpose in Saving you he has a
[1:10:34] purpose in Saving me and he didn't save
[1:10:37] us to let us drawn he didn't bring us
[1:10:41] this far to leave us he bring us to take
[1:10:45] us to all to himself to glory and he has
[1:10:49] a purpose in Saving you delivering you
[1:10:52] from alcohol delivering you from all
[1:10:54] kind of life and bring you to a New
[1:10:57] Found land who is the Holy Ghost himself
[1:10:59] and now he's the anchor he's the one
[1:11:02] that is leading us you are predestinated
[1:11:05] you are elected bride to receive this
[1:11:07] word for your day many even the prophets
[1:11:11] of they all long to have heard
[1:11:14] this but God preserved to his last day
[1:11:17] bride we should be encouraged by this
[1:11:20] have consolation absent from here
[1:11:23] presentence with the Lord Within tle of
[1:11:25] an hour you going to meet the Lord in
[1:11:27] the
[1:11:29] air there is going to be a meeting in
[1:11:31] the
[1:11:32] air in the street by by amen I'm going
[1:11:36] to meet you over there Hallelujah so
[1:11:40] let's be
[1:11:42] happy and glorify God knowing that one
[1:11:47] of these days we're going to be changed
[1:11:50] but I encourage you because there
[1:11:53] is not one thing left all the prophets
[1:11:58] the prophecies has been fulfilled for
[1:12:01] the left what the coming nothing but the
[1:12:05] coming of bride
[1:12:07] remember Israel types the bride and if
[1:12:11] you check I was listening to a thing
[1:12:13] yesterday that they have been what
[1:12:16] attacked by seven
[1:12:19] fronts
[1:12:21] heah Hamas h htis
[1:12:25] um in Yemen some of them in Iraq Iran
[1:12:29] people in Iraq all of them attacking
[1:12:32] Israel and if you see that there's
[1:12:36] attack on Israel naturally it means that
[1:12:39] a spiritual warfare on the bride and
[1:12:42] what should the bride do because
[1:12:45] everything that happens in the natural
[1:12:47] realm it takes place in the spiritual
[1:12:50] realm face so spiritually we have to be
[1:12:53] on the Forefront praying because our
[1:12:55] armor of defense is
[1:12:58] prayer that's the greatest weapon that
[1:13:01] God has given to the
[1:13:03] bride so we have to pray pray pray
[1:13:07] pray because there is a battle going
[1:13:11] on our eyes cannot see it spiritual but
[1:13:15] it's going on so we have to be prayed up
[1:13:19] and very
[1:13:20] soon
[1:13:22] as the biggest guess early us everyone
[1:13:29] is deserting them the prophet told us
[1:13:31] it's going to be a time that Israel will
[1:13:34] go along so is the bride of Christ
[1:13:38] there's going to be a time you're going
[1:13:39] to betrayed as Judas betrayed
[1:13:43] Christ so is Judas the Bible is going to
[1:13:47] betray the re the red
[1:13:50] bright so we have to be ready we have to
[1:13:54] be spiritual
[1:13:56] awaken and be conscious of what is going
[1:14:00] on and not to take things like Grace can
[1:14:04] you put me that one the one you put to
[1:14:06] back let me read it first and close with
[1:14:09] that you can't put it on okay that's
[1:14:12] fine so I'm just going to
[1:14:15] conclude to encourage us to know that
[1:14:18] our God loves us and he has opened our
[1:14:23] eyes of understanding
[1:14:26] when he shed it no one can open and when
[1:14:30] he open no one can s but to you it is
[1:14:33] given to know the mysteries of what the
[1:14:37] kingdom he has opened our eyes of
[1:14:40] understanding so you shall be thankful
[1:14:42] and praise th God Amen that's what I
[1:14:45] have for tonight amen
[1:14:58] okay let's
