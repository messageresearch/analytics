========================================
[Music] oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever blessed be the name of the lord [Music] another wonderful sunday morning to be with god's people we're together again just praising the lord giving glory and honor to his wonderful name i'm pastor john simon and i come to you in the name of the lord jesus christ from good neighbor ministries burlington ontario may the great holy spirit use the word of god to speak to your heart and that you may make your choice to serve him walk with him to love him and to serve him god bless us all as i read from the word of god the book of numbers chapter 20 reading from verse 7 to 11 and the lord spake unto moses saying take thy rod and gather thou the assembly round about you and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so that thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts to drink and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them here now you rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also praise god hallelujah let us pray a gracious heavenly father we thank thee for the reading of the word we pray that the great holy spirit the heavenly dove will rest upon us find a resting place within our hearts and speak lord may your word go forth lord may your people be blessed lord may lives be changed may your name be glorified and lifted up father as we commit all things into thy hands in the name of jesus christ to the glory of god amen praise god hallelujah amen praise the lord now we realize we are coming into we have come into a great wonderful and marvelous age spoken of by the prophets and now by the prophet of this marvelous 20th century and we realize that the age we are in is no longer a pentecostal age the church has come through the seven church ages as have been prophesied and spoken of in revelation chapters one through three and we know that now we are no more in the pentecostal age for luther changed to the lutherans changed the methodists and then god started working with the methodists and then finally the pentecostals came out of the methodists god started working with the pentecostals but our god has marched on and now pentecost modern day pentecost i'm speaking of is one essential mess it is a cesspool of sin thank god this is not the pentecostal age this is the bride age this is the rapture time age for the rapturing people with a rapturing faith that have hearts open to receive the rapturing grace from god in heaven amen all things have been pointing to this marvelous time in this great hour down through the years many patriarchs prophets saints apostles longed for this hour amen they long for this day that they could be here in this age when they did not necessarily have to die but that they could be changed by god's power to transform oh my glory to his marvelous name how that the great holy spirit promised in this age through the apostle paul you shall not all sleep which means you shall not all die but some will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye glory to god that is god's supernatural rapture the taking away of his bride as a thief in the night praise god i take him for the hour of the body change i thank him for this season of the catching up so we may be caught up in the presence of the living god hallelujah amen thank god we could be alive now an age of great truth and revelation but at the same time it's a great hour also of deception satan is now coming to the maturity of his deception and seduction my glory to god hallelujah thank god that god has raised the standard for when the enemy comes in like a flood god promised he would raise up a standard against them god has raised up anointed men and women anointed with the truth hallelujah praise god one may have an anointing and it may be wonderful spectacular uh attractive but listen to the voice listen to hear the truth the revelation coming from the word of god hallelujah so god has imparted to his church gifts of men anointed to bring forth amen anointed with the holy spirit with god-given ability to bring forth the revelation of god's word for this hour and to keep god's people lined up straight with the word of god for this day and for this hour i know paul said that there will be a great falling away and i know many will fall to the wayside especially in this hour cove it around plagued the realm sickness around a job no job nor this problems troubles tribulation trials and god has taken his people as it were in a wilderness and he said as i took israel out to try them and to prove them to see whether they really are were his people glory to god so is god allowing the same thing happening to us today amen so many are falling badder wayside giving heed to seducing spirits like eve did in the garden listening to that vile seducer speaking into her mind oh and departing from the word of god the tree of life whoa paul said to us perilous times shall come i believe we are living in those perilous times right now and that jesus said they'll be so perilous unless he shorten the days because of the evil and darkness that will be covering the land except he shortened the days no flesh would be raptured no flesh would be taken out from this place hallelujah so we realize as the old song says trouble sometimes are here filling men's hearts with fear freedom we all hold dear now is at stake humble your heart to god saves from the chastening rod seek the whip pilgrims trod christians awake oh jesus is coming soon morning or night or noon many will meet their doom trumpets will sound all the dead shallow rise righteously in the skies going where no one dies heaven word bound amen praise god i know sometimes it seems like if we appear to the people as if we are fanatic and that we are like old-fashioned and the reason why is because most of the sacredness of from the word of god and the age in which we live has been taken away by the acts uh and the lives of the people in the scripture which we read god told moses to take up his rod and take it with him behold i will stand before thee upon the rock hallelujah thank god the same holy spirit will stand on the same rock the same revelation you have i have the true saints have god will stand on his word heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away amen praise god hallelujah my friends i want you to know that that rock was not just a boulder or a granite or a mass of rock only in the wilderness it was but it was a symbol and a type of jesus christ for in first corinthians chapter 10 paul speaks of that rock reading from verse one to six he said our fathers at manna in the wilderness they drank from that rock in the wilderness and that spiritual rock was christ hallelujah so christ was the rock in the wilderness i'm thinking of an old song jesus is the rock and the weary land the very land a weary land jesus is the rock in the weary land he's a shelter in the time of storm yes jesus was and is that rock in a weary land of trouble and trial amen hallelujah praise god and it's so significant that israel went into the wilderness it was the same month that jesus christ himself was crucified upon the cross that they went in to the wilderness oh praise god hallelujah now friends remember in the beginning of the bible jesus christ was smitten in the form of a rock in the wilderness for the people to drink from that rock and to have shelter and shade from the heat of their troubles and trials the heat of the sun the heat of what was going on around them they could find shelter in his shadows oh praise god hallelujah i'm so thankful to god my friends that when we don't know what to do we can come to jesus christ and find shelter in him in our time of storm praise god so just as the rock was smitten in the wilderness jesus had to be smitten also that he could be recognized that he was that rock that was in the wilderness amen and for three and a half years he was smitten by the leaders of the jewish nation the rabbis the great teachers the great pharisees the sadducees the libertarians the libertines the epicureans many others that were there in that hour or in other words the theologians of that day they looked at him jesus the word and they kept criticizing finding fault marking his mouth every little word he spoke every action that he did they were ready to put their criticism upon it not knowing they were smiting the rock for three and a half years you were smiting the rock until finally he came to the kel golgotha's hill climbed the hill they hung him by his found him up there to die and there the bible says he was struck and there he died for our sins and our salvation pouring out what pouring out his life from him water from the rock type of day or symbol of the word of god pouring out of him praise god so that if that woman that was at the well would have been there i don't know if she was but if she was there she says oh this is the well that we really should drink from oh this is the rock where i can drink from the waters and i will never ever thirst again oh thank god he jesus was the word made flesh and in him was the blessed holy spirit of the living god and the only way that we could get uh the living waters of the holy spirit to pour out of him amen he had to be smitten or crucified so that the blood life could flow out of him and be made available for us to be able to receive it within our hearts and with our lives brother william aaron branham the prophet of this 20th century oh praise god called him the bloody bleeding lamb the bloody bleeding word the word that's bleeding the word is always pouring out revelation the word is always bringing understanding the word is always bringing light thank god hallelujah that his loved ones could believe could receive him and believe him he is the bloody bleeding lamb that took our place oh ah i love when the spirit strikes my heart thou dying lamb thy precious blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom church of god are saved to sin no more oh dear dying lamb thy precious blood hallelujah oh praise god friends at the cross at the cross where i first saw i first saw oh i received my sight and then the word was opened up to me praise god that's where i first saw the light and the light from god's word the understanding the revelation from god's word flashed before me my eyes were opened and i could recognize who i am and where i come from and where i'm going i'm not just a pig or a dog turned into a sheep i was always one of his own from before the foundation of the world i am only now recognizing who i am and who my father is he only use my earthly father and mother to bring me here but my real genuine father is up above hallelujah and i recognize my father i respect my earthly father love my earthly mother but that's the great real father of us all praise god hallelujah oh my my my praise god amen paul said we should be washed by the water of the world oh may the word of god wash me cleanse my mind renew my spirit just make me a new creature in christ by the washing of the water of the word of god hallelujah how can you be washed by the water of the word smitten why was the rock smitten so that it could open up the way was the words written that it could open up that it could reveal itself and we could recognize god in his word hallelujah amen for us to be able to get the benefits the blessings the privileges uh to become noise of the word and to recognize the day in which we live they theologians the doctors of letters of religion the dds llds phds whatever listen education is not bad it's good right it's good as long as it's surrendered to christ that paul said i count all my knowledge and he was the wisest man of his day i counted dull and ash that i might win christ hallelujah oh praise god my brother sister it's wonderful when we see here how god allowed these different groups back their fantasies uh pharisees and so on the various denominational groups as well as their great theologians to reject the word smite the word so that and the jews to reject the word and reject him and turn away from him so physically and spiritually so that we could recognize who he was because it was by their smiting their rejection and their pushing him the word away from them that opened up the opportunity for us to become beneficiaries when the life came out of him they drove him out from their midst but he came to me oh take god i said that drove him the word out of their midst but he came to us thank god he came looking for a woman by the well he came from the danielle he came over there for james he came for peter glory of god he came for sarah he came for darkness he comfort all those ones whose names were in that lamb's book of life many others they were right there and the holy spirit had come for them and so he crawled out to his own amen and praised god by smiting of that rock it opened up and seven seals gushed out of that the revealing of the word and the inspiration the will of god filling up your soul and pouring out the word for this hour to the hearts of them that we believe amen hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah somebody had to hear it before they could reject it my friends hallelujah a person does not is not a blasphemer just because they reject the bible a person is not a blasphemer because they walked away from the message the individual commits blasphemy of the holy ghost and crucifies him afresh within their heart and life by sitting sitting listening to this open revelation amen being preached and explained in its simplicity purity clearness to them and then to turn around and call it false doctrine and walk away from it they commit blasphemy against the great holy spirit yes my subject is the smitten rock i spoken on this i'm speaking on it and will speak on it again isn't it strange that everywhere that israel went the bible said the rock was present with them everywhere that israel went the bible said the rock followed them in the desert reminds me mary had a little lamb the lamb was white as snow and everywhere that mary went that lamb was sure to go oh thank god just the same way my friends that rock followed israel everywhere they went you me true elected believers who knew they couldn't tell what was the difference with them they thought something was wrong with them why were they seeing things from a different angle than most everybody else but you see that was the rock being with you and everywhere that mary wet the land the lamb was sure to go everywhere israel went the rock was sure to go and everywhere the true elected bride goes whether she knows who she was or she didn't know who she was that rock is sure to go and then it will open up and the truth the revelation the refreshing waters of life will flow out of it i'll praise god to inspire to anoint her soul and to bring her into a relationship with the lord jesus christ of course that river that that rock that followed them in the wilderness was that a rock that they could carry around and this is not something you can go into a school and go study it and carry it around with you is that something you can pack in a briefcase yes my friends this rock is a spiritual ruckus christ and christ fills your heart fills your life with his spirit with his presence and power and leads you and guides you for his name's sake amen that rock is like the pyramid today praise god hallelujah the rock is the pyramid representation of the perfect body of jesus christ sitting upon the foundation of the true and full word of the living god amen hallelujah my friends thank god for this word aren't you happy i am happy i'm overjoyed that the lord has opened my eyes that i can see in a heart to believe the word of god when that rock or when this word that i am preaching now was in the wilderness it appeared to israel as if it were a rock following them in the wilderness and then when the rock was smitten water life-giving water refreshing water came out of that rock hallelujah later on when that rock came in the manifestation of the very person of jesus christ he was the rock and he was smitten as i've said and there my friends finally gave his all on calvary's three isaiah 53 you will read how the bible says and he the lord struck him he was stricken smitten and afflicted of god wounded for our transgressions bruised for our inequities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his traits hallelujah we are healed you are healed you're delivered by the power of god thank god for this that if we only believe all things are possible and you'll be free from this hour for you have already been healed from the day he gave his life and shed his blood you only believe it now and receive the benefits of it now because you are only realizing it now and recognizing fully what he has done for you so receive the blessings of god and god be with you from this moment hallelujah here we see him that he jesus christ smitten died on the cross went down in the grave rose back up but he said before dying and he gave up the ghost so the holy spirit came back down on the day of pentecost and the holy ghost has been with the church right to this hour the rock that followed them that spiritual rock is jesus christ hallelujah the holy spirit following every genuine son or daughter of god and here we are friends we see the third time this great rock has come the word this word for the hour smitten by critics that once followed this message critics inside and outside sadducees pharisees all kinds of theologians and everything they smite it they strike it they speak against it they attack it they call it all manner of names and the more they smite it it's the more revelation comes out of it to the true believer who embraces the word and receives the word of god for this hour and i thank god that the word has been smitten in our day and in our time again and now we can have a spoken word message we can have a spoken word the spoken word revelation we can hear it believe it receive it act upon it and receive the become beneficiaries of it hallelujah the spoken word the spoken revealed word now making itself manifested in the heart and life of the believer listen in a sermon called masterpiece brother branham said the word now living and in action their bible bride not some man-made bride not some man-made bride or magma church but god's bible bride the bible bride smitten and afflicted of god in this hour hallelujah praise god amen my friends so counted all joy when you are criticized by friends family strangers calls all men renames he said if they persecute me will then not also percy cute you oh certainly amen so that rock had to be smitten again in our day oh and the seals broke open that rock opened up and the word poured fought and revelation came out of it amen praise god hallelujah i thank god that he is the same yesterday today and forever that his life could be poured out as a sin offering for us the true believer amen praise god amen thank god for this word that we have received in this day i thank god for those who have received the word and walk in the light of it but whatever form it was in regardless of whether it was laying there looking like a rock or whether that was hanging on a cross looking like a man in flesh oh or whether it's here now in this day and in this hour manifesting itself true flesh it's the same word it's the same rock amen for now it's manifesting itself true flesh as the bride body of jesus christ again so the rock being smitten twice once in jesus christ and twice in his bright form praise the lord back in israel back there it was the natural smiting but this now we have the smiting of jesus christ himself out of him poured forth the life out of adam came eve out of christ came the rib came the life that comes down to us that we could represent him to manifest his word and his life so whether the rock is in a in the form of the man christ jesus or in the form of the woman bride church for this day and time standing here standing there sta standing wherever it is still the word the living word making itself manifested in this day and in this hour it's the same rock in the wilderness again amen oh my do you remember paul was on his road down to damascus it was a hot day sun shining down paul sitting on his horse riding with his eastern arabic clothes on riding with his entourage behind him going down to persecute the christians and then out of the midday sun came a bright shining light and a voice saying saul saul what a persecutors down me oh and he fell from his high horse i believe some of us sometimes we are too high and mighty big position big money big job influence in society god bless you that's wonderful but never put it in front of him and sometimes god needs to strike some of us off your high horse down bite the dust and recognize who you are before your creator before your maker the almighty god hallelujah and paul fell the voice said i am jesus he said who are you lord well you know a jew calls no one lord or god like that he asked him who are you god who are you lord and he said i am jesus whom thou persecute us but you see paul was persecuting the church the believers and killing the believers but jesus said it's same as killing me for what the husband and the wife she is him revealed the two are one christ and the bride are one he is the man form and she is in the bright form praise god hallelujah amen praise god he was the word so she is the living word walking amen praise god hallelujah so they were prosecuting jesus christ when he was persecuting the saints it was jesus christ being smitten when he thought he was killing just saints smiting just saints he was actually smiting the lord jesus christ i want to quote again from why little bethlehem he is also our water for our journey now we know that he is the water like israel in their journey either the smaller rock of their ore and water came out or their bread came down from heaven oh hallelujah aren't you happy today jesus christ is our journey water and he also is our journey cake he is our journey bread or he is bread for your journey he is water for your journey no matter what storms what a trials what tribulations what wilderness you're passing through he is your water for the journey and he is your bread your cake your journey cake for that journey amen well praise god hallelujah oh my but the rock had to be smitten so they could drink from it to have sustaining life for their journey go smite the rock oh smite it praise god and the rock is jesus christ do you believe it i believe it with all my heart so life could come out of that rock amen we need the holy spirit today my brother sister hallelujah oh praise god who in a sign form will smite the word amen and out of the word will comfort the understanding the revelation light of the word of god i am so glad there is a man here that can turn on the light there's a man here that can open the eyes of your heart there's a man here and his name is jesus christ i'm so glad that he is not dead but he's alive he's in spirit form he's alive forevermore he said i am he that liveth and was dead but i am alive forevermore and because i live you shall live also oh thanks be to god hallelujah amen i believe what we need today friends it's not just having the bible it's not just going and having the bible rather explained to you naturally speaking but we need in this last day friends is a holy spirit opening up of the word of god that lives and moves and have its being in us and thank god he is this jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever according to hebrews chapter 13 verse 8. amen thank god hallelujah oh praise god i'm glad friends we bypass all their dogmas we all we bypass all their high church creeds we bypass all their stinking drinking stagnated water lutheran water methodist water catholic water baptist water they kept it in that pool standing still until it's full of tadpoles and all kinds of wiggling worms inside of it or praise cup but thank god we now have a flesh pouring out of the waters of the word of life that we can drink from that water got water god's rain water from the heavens above that we can drink and live and have a new life a new walk a second chance amen so you can walk and live for him i pray that the holy spirit will come while i'm speaking and smite the sign smite the signpost the super saiyan i trust the holy spirit will come open the rock and let the word of god flow forth to our hearts and to our lives amen i bless the name of the lord that he is the same amen praise god amen praise god hallelujah my friends the cross is the same just the same one that was sticking up there on golgotha but now they're calling the hill pulpits the pulpits are the crosses of today it's over the pulpits that they'll preach about you they'll talk about you they'll scandalize your name all kinds of stuff they're gonna call you they're they're smiting the rock and they don't know it but they're smiting the rock right from their pulpits right from their pulpits today and crucifying the word of god again amen hallelujah oh my god there and they tell the people oh he doesn't know what he's talking about oh he doesn't understand the message i understand it he doesn't he doesn't know about those seven seals those seven seals are false to begin with they're not right uh those doctrines that you're hearing they're not right they're they're they're false or something amen see when they do that that's taken him to their high pulpit taking him to calvary once again and they're crucifying the very words to you they're crucifying the word to you and there we find it praise god that they're twisting that spoken word that's being given to you to make it look to you as if it's just a bunch of nonsense that is just it's just nonsense it's old-fashioned it's nothing fresh new to you but in your soul if you're a seed of god a chain of god a germ of god a child of god something stares something moves within hallelujah and you recognize amen that this is that spoken of by the prophets by the apostles amen and here we are while they're thinking this is a bunch of nonsense yet they are crucifying the very word of god right over their pulpit pulpits once again but this time what they're crucifying is the spoken revealed manifested word of god for the hour that they are but and try to keep the people away from the word of god trying to stop them or turn them away from the word of god and to speak evil against the word of god the racist christ amen and thank god that he sent a prophet who struck the rock open the rock so life could pour out of it amen the rock is the word take god but now it's the holy spirit here opening up the word of god to you in a sign and let the word come out i said let the word come out let the holy spirit bring forth the word of god within your soul let there be a holy spirit moving within your heart within your life amen hallelujah glory to god paul said if the princes of this world only knew they would have not smitten that rock they would not have crucified the lord of glory if them theologians and denominations knew they would not have criticized and condemned this message of the hour because little did they know it's like a man stomping on a campfire and instead of putting it out he actually spread the sparks spreads the fire everywhere let me tell you the fire of guarding of this message is spreading everywhere it's in africa it's in india it's in china it's all everywhere out in south america this fire of god is moving across the world brother sister hallelujah thank god amen amen amen if some of the message so-called believers knew they would not be criticizing the prophet that will be criticizing his teaching or the people who truly believe the opening of this word amen and have caught the revelation of that la this last prophet's message they would not do it amen thank god in our day again there was a smiting and the seven seals have been opened up to us amen and with that what happens immediately after the smiting of jesus christ on calvary the burial then there had to be a resurrection and even so with the smiting criticism and everything of this word and of the people who are carriers of the word the word lives in them they are now experiencing and will be experiencing a resurrection time and a rapture time because the word has gone forth and the word is pulling them from amongst dead creeds dead dogmas dead dirt and putting them right into the presence of the living god with a rapturing faith a rapture revelation never heard never seen before being made known to them praise the lord that they might walk in the light of his word amen so here they are smiting him again in his bright body amen praise god and all that does is brings a gushing forth the rapture revelation gushing out of them because that's what is in them and it's going forth in the power of the holy spirit amen glory to god amen amen amen i'm so glad i can say i am one of them i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them i'm one of them one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah now i want to speak uh touch again here out of the third exodus brother branham speaking just like balaam was they come to the top of a hill where israel was and there was israel not a nation but a people thank god israel was a nation uh him it was not a nation just a people thank god and i thank god we are not a denomination but we are just a people that have been called out to receive his name the name of our husband spiritually is jesus christ which makes us real true christians by the word of the living god hallelujah there was israel not a nation just the people floating around were guilty they were not members of any church they were just floating around everywhere but whoa yes they were guilty of a whole lot of things they made a whole lot of mistakes they stumbled here and stumbled there and stumbled everywhere and moab the church people of that day were looking at them and saying look he did this and she did that and he did that and when he calls himself a christian he calls himself a preacher he called or she calls herself a sister she calls it and i know she did the she did that and he did that and oh my the more bites and my god the more they see you the more they want to bite those more bites who want to come after you in every possible way those church members they want to come after you in every possible way see and moab his brother the intellectual the organized man come to the top of the hill with the bishop and put up an altar and offered the same sacrifice you see there were impersonators copycats of of the israelite people that were there and they were cop but you see he failed to see he failed to see that the pillar of fire was with them he failed to see that the splitting rock was amongst them glory to god hallelujah they're coming and look and here you are you know just simple people ordinary people whether you're gathering in a palace uh uh you're gathering in a penthouse or you gather it in somebody's house or you're gathering under somebody's house god doesn't care about that amen when they look at that it blinds them to what they should really see and they don't recognize that these were the people of god they failed to see the pillar of fire amongst those people oh praise god that purifier that was with israel is not dead he's alive forevermore brother sister and he can appear any time he wants to glory to god hallelujah they failed to see the smitten rock the open world that the people had with them and that was walking with them that that rock was crucified opened up and the word was pouring out of it they could see that rock they could not see the rock it's so strange they couldn't see it but you who appears to be nobodies you up you who uh are just uh a regular person it's like playing as daylight to you it's it just touches your heart and you recognize the day and the hour in which you live israel saw it was glad because they knew that that rock came from jehovah god almighty from above hallelujah amen the spoken revealed word to us in this day and hour amen they see you but they can't catch and they cannot see the opening of the revelations of this hour oh praise god now remember things that are to be he is the one that uh quickening power he is the one who opened those seals he christ hears those seals for the whole word of god is christ amen and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ god bless you my friend today amen my subject was this smitten rock this smitten bloody bleeding word with the life of god pouring out of it may that life pour out of this word made pour out of this life and may the spirit of god rest upon you repent back to christ back to
