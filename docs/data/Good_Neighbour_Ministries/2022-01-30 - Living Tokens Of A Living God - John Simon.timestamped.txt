[17:44] good sunday morning friends
[17:48] here we are together again
[17:51] yes
[17:52] here we are praising jesus
[17:56] and giving glory to his wonderful
[17:59] and marvelous name
[18:02] may the lord bless us
[18:04] as we gather together
[18:07] to magnify and glorify
[18:10] his great
[18:12] name
[18:13] thanks be unto god
[18:15] before i advance
[18:18] i would
[18:19] like to
[18:21] indicate
[18:22] to you or let you know
[18:25] of the
[18:27] crossing over
[18:30] of our
[18:31] sister
[18:33] hammond
[18:34] sister nelly hammond
[18:37] and the
[18:38] crossing over
[18:40] of our sister carol
[18:43] ramdan
[18:45] may the lord bless them
[18:49] they have received their total
[18:51] deliverance
[18:53] they have entered into the joys of their
[18:55] lord
[18:57] and into the freedom
[19:00] that only
[19:02] jesus christ can give
[19:04] they're broken the bars of death and
[19:08] sin they have dropped off the chains of
[19:12] earth
[19:13] and now they revel in the glory of god
[19:18] and rejoice
[19:20] with the millions of saints who have
[19:23] welcomed them
[19:25] into the very throne room of god
[19:29] may god rest their souls
[19:32] amen
[19:33] hallelujah we celebrate their lives
[19:37] we give god glory to have known them on
[19:41] earth
[19:43] and we shall
[19:44] meet them again
[19:46] for christians never die
[19:49] but we part
[19:52] but we will meet again
[19:54] god bless their hearts
[19:57] and be with their souls
[20:00] for today
[20:03] we would speak on the subject called
[20:08] living tokens of a living god
[20:12] now our scripture is found
[20:16] in second corinthians
[20:18] chapter 4
[20:21] verses 3
[20:22] to 7
[20:26] but if our gospel be hid
[20:30] it is hid to them that are lost
[20:35] in whom the god of this world
[20:39] had blinded
[20:41] the minds of them which believe not
[20:46] lest the light
[20:47] of the glorious gospel
[20:50] of jesus
[20:52] christ who is the image of god
[20:56] should shine upon them
[20:59] for we preach not ourselves
[21:02] but je christ jesus
[21:05] the lord
[21:07] and ourselves
[21:09] your servants
[21:11] for jesus sake
[21:14] for god who had commanded the light
[21:19] to shine out of darkness
[21:22] had shined in our hearts
[21:26] to give the light
[21:28] of the knowledge
[21:30] of the glory of god
[21:32] in the face of jesus christ
[21:37] but we have this treasure
[21:41] in earthen vessels
[21:45] that the excellency
[21:47] of the power
[21:49] may be of god
[21:51] and not
[21:53] of us
[21:55] oh let us pray
[21:57] our righteous
[21:59] heavenly father
[22:01] we thank you
[22:03] for this wonderful time
[22:06] in your presence
[22:08] your children around your throne
[22:12] your children feeding upon your word
[22:15] we thank you lord for this blessing
[22:20] that was given to us
[22:22] for as you sent a prophet
[22:25] and he stored up food
[22:27] and now we can
[22:29] feed upon that stored up food lord
[22:33] hidden manna
[22:35] oh lamb of god
[22:38] that no many how no matter how many
[22:41] years may roll on
[22:44] the
[22:46] mana they show bread
[22:49] that
[22:50] was hidden
[22:51] behind the veil now comes into view by
[22:56] the power of the holy spirit and by the
[22:59] great revelation of god
[23:02] may you receive all glory honor and
[23:04] praise
[23:05] for we ask it in jesus name amen
[23:12] now from the wictionary
[23:16] not dictionary but the
[23:20] wictionary the word token
[23:25] is
[23:26] an object
[23:27] or thing
[23:29] serving
[23:30] as an expression
[23:32] of something else
[23:35] for example
[23:36] it may be a sign
[23:39] it may be a seal
[23:41] it may be a symbol
[23:44] but it is used to
[23:46] represent
[23:48] some distinguished person
[23:51] or thing
[23:54] it's also shown
[23:57] or displayed
[23:59] as a symbol of guarantee
[24:05] displayed as a symbol also of authority
[24:12] also a symbol
[24:14] of authenticity
[24:18] and of quality
[24:21] and of power
[24:25] this
[24:26] token or the word token
[24:30] can be also
[24:32] said to be a tally
[24:35] okay
[24:37] our
[24:38] brother william marion branham
[24:42] the great prophet of god of this
[24:47] the
[24:48] last church age
[24:52] has spoken on this subject
[24:55] of the token
[24:58] and he has spoken on it several times
[25:02] whether he named it that at the time or
[25:05] not
[25:06] you will find scattered about
[25:10] are bits pieces gems
[25:13] scattered everywhere
[25:15] but principally
[25:17] he spoke on this subject
[25:20] in the great anointed message
[25:24] called the token
[25:26] and again he spoke up on this message
[25:31] seal of god he spoke about
[25:34] what was the holy ghost
[25:37] given for
[25:38] and many others
[25:42] now
[25:42] you see brother branham being the
[25:45] prophet he saw the overall picture
[25:50] but
[25:51] in this sermon the token
[25:55] he was only
[25:57] allowed to speak on it
[26:02] to a certain point of view
[26:06] a limited amount
[26:08] of what he had to say
[26:10] there
[26:11] and the rest
[26:13] were left
[26:15] in different parts
[26:18] in the storehouse
[26:20] waiting
[26:22] for the elected sons of god
[26:26] those of whom he spoke sang
[26:28] they will see
[26:30] when it is time for them to see
[26:33] and i believe that r has come
[26:37] and the spirit of god be a record of
[26:40] that this wonderful time
[26:43] now today
[26:45] i want to show you
[26:48] that
[26:50] the attribute this is what i want you to
[26:53] see
[26:54] that the attribute
[26:57] that is in you
[26:58] the gene
[27:00] of god the germ
[27:02] that is
[27:03] in you
[27:04] in
[27:05] those of the elect of god
[27:10] is a token of god himself
[27:15] in the individual
[27:17] hallelujah
[27:19] in other words
[27:21] the germ the gene in you
[27:24] is
[27:25] a portion or a town of fire
[27:29] you see for the holy spirit himself
[27:33] is the token
[27:36] not a token but the token
[27:40] the supreme the great token
[27:43] for in him
[27:45] was the fullness of the godhead bodily
[27:48] and on the day
[27:50] when he gave up the ghost
[27:53] then he broke himself into species
[27:57] to come
[27:58] and live in man
[28:01] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[28:04] the habitation of god is with men
[28:08] thanks be to god
[28:10] and so friends
[28:13] a token
[28:15] a portion
[28:16] a peace
[28:18] or a part of god
[28:20] indwells the elected
[28:23] and
[28:24] as that being in them
[28:28] they can rejoice
[28:31] oh praise god
[28:33] now to make this a little clearer
[28:36] from man's point of view
[28:40] when many of us may remember or know
[28:44] about the good
[28:45] housekeeping seal
[28:49] and the good housekeeping seal of course
[28:53] was a token
[28:56] that spoke of authenticity
[29:00] it spoke my friends
[29:03] of a guarantee
[29:05] that the object
[29:07] that you were purchasing
[29:10] was authentic
[29:12] and
[29:13] it had the quality
[29:16] that it is supposed to have
[29:19] once it had the seal
[29:22] it tells you
[29:24] that that is an authentic object
[29:27] and when the believer of course has
[29:30] god's seal it proves they are authentic
[29:35] never mind what man says about it but
[29:38] what god says about it when he gives
[29:41] that elected individual his seal of
[29:46] authenticity
[29:47] and his seal of approval
[29:51] look at it again from this point of view
[29:56] i remember going into crowded spaces
[30:02] you may even be going into a crowded
[30:05] space
[30:07] you're well aware of what
[30:09] i'm speaking about here
[30:11] you'll go into a crowded space whether
[30:14] it be a wedding whether it be
[30:16] a banquet and in the winter quotes have
[30:20] to be taken
[30:22] and given to someone that will oversee
[30:26] them
[30:28] and when you give that individual your
[30:30] coat
[30:32] they will give you a ticket
[30:35] called a token
[30:37] you'll receive that ticket and it'll
[30:39] have numbers on it
[30:42] and they'll give you the other half
[30:45] so that when you return
[30:48] the ticket that you have
[30:50] must match the one that they have the
[30:53] numbers on it and then they're aware of
[30:57] ownership
[30:59] right then they're aware of
[31:02] ownership you will be the owner praise
[31:05] god hallelujah amen yes sir now when
[31:09] let's look at this that's man's point of
[31:12] view but when we look at it from god's
[31:15] point of view
[31:16] you see god's point of view
[31:20] the guarantee of a promise
[31:22] like the rainbow
[31:25] that
[31:26] was a token and here's a token given to
[31:29] us
[31:30] genesis 9
[31:31] 12-17
[31:34] the blood in egypt that was placed on
[31:38] the doorpost
[31:39] that was just a sign a symbol a tape
[31:43] it was a token
[31:45] right it was the token to israel
[31:49] hey token
[31:50] to israel
[31:52] it was to them the token but in reality
[31:56] it was a
[31:57] symbol
[31:58] to them at that time amen praise god now
[32:03] what did this token represent it
[32:06] represented
[32:08] god's protection
[32:10] it represented
[32:13] god's
[32:14] identification
[32:16] god identifying them
[32:19] as his own
[32:21] so they should not be touched they
[32:23] should not
[32:24] be any way uh
[32:27] destroyed because they were under the
[32:31] token of the blood hallelujah and so
[32:35] today are we
[32:36] who are real believers
[32:39] also under the talk and blood of christ
[32:43] hallelujah the reality the real blood

[35:32] the things of god
[35:34] things
[35:35] that are going to be
[35:39] now
[35:39] what a marvelous type
[35:42] when we see
[35:43] that jesus christ our lord
[35:47] is our token today
[35:50] not blood
[35:52] of bulls and goats
[35:54] not the blood of some
[35:57] animal
[35:58] but the blood of our blessed lord jesus
[36:02] is our talking today
[36:05] and of course the blood
[36:07] is a token
[36:08] his blood of his life
[36:11] of the holy spirit praise god and we
[36:15] have a part of that wit in us
[36:18] we have a portion within us
[36:21] hallelujah the blood on the door
[36:24] when that dead angel
[36:27] came true hallelujah was the proof that
[36:31] a lamb had died or praised god so the
[36:35] blood
[36:36] was a token of identification
[36:41] amen and we have that token in us today
[36:46] that the precious lamb of god died for
[36:50] our sins took our place and the life
[36:54] that was upon him has come to earth
[36:57] again in the form of the holy spirit to
[37:01] rest upon us
[37:02] identify us as his own to protect us as
[37:07] we he walks with us so we have been
[37:10] given a token
[37:12] which of course
[37:15] that was a type
[37:18] of this the antitype
[37:21] hallelujah
[37:22] and back there they had a natural token
[37:26] now we have a supernatural token within
[37:30] our lives amen hallelujah and all those
[37:34] talking back there was foreshadowing
[37:38] this great supreme token that we have
[37:42] the earnest of our inheritance we have
[37:46] the holy spirit the supreme token in our
[37:50] hearts and
[37:52] buried within
[37:54] our lives hallelujah for the holy ghost
[37:58] is our token amen the holy ghost is our
[38:03] identification
[38:05] the holy ghost is our seal the holy
[38:09] ghost is our sign upon our hearts and
[38:13] lives amen oh praise god he it displays
[38:19] to god and to the world that we have
[38:22] accepted the death of the lord jesus
[38:27] thou dying lamb thy precious blood will
[38:31] never lose its power till all the ransom
[38:35] church of god
[38:36] are saved to sin no more blessed be the
[38:41] name of the living god hallelujah amen
[38:45] you see
[38:46] not only was jesus living a human life
[38:50] but it was god manifested
[38:54] in the flesh
[38:56] walking upon the earth hallelujah and
[38:59] when he came back on us that brought
[39:02] back brought to us the adoption of sons
[39:06] glory to god and now we are the sons and
[39:10] daughters of the living god by this
[39:12] overshadowing of the holy ghost by this
[39:15] adoption of the holy spirit is our
[39:19] identification that we believe god and
[39:24] god has accepted us because we believe
[39:28] him the bleeding word of god has bled
[39:33] and we allowed the blood to sprinkle
[39:37] itself upon us to become god's speckled
[39:41] bird of the hour the holy spirit resting
[39:45] upon our lives glory to god now let me
[39:49] go to this
[39:50] make this a little clearer
[39:53] listen to god's servant and prophet
[39:57] speaking the word listen
[40:01] now you remember here
[40:03] in
[40:04] america
[40:06] years ago
[40:08] the chinese
[40:11] brother that would uh come to my house
[40:15] to my mind when i was talking to him
[40:19] you see when they came they could not
[40:23] speak
[40:24] english
[40:26] they and they run laundries
[40:30] and you would go up to the laundry to
[40:32] get your laundry done you know how it
[40:35] was
[40:36] and they would take your laundry
[40:40] and
[40:41] at that time because they could not read
[40:44] and write
[40:46] what they would do
[40:49] is
[40:50] tear a bill or a piece of paper
[40:54] into two pieces
[40:56] and they will give you a half
[40:59] and they will keep the other part
[41:02] and when you return
[41:04] the piece you had
[41:06] had to perfectly fit
[41:09] what they had
[41:11] or you would not be able to pick up your
[41:15] clothing
[41:16] now what this chinese the chinese
[41:20] laundry man was doing
[41:22] they
[41:23] knew
[41:24] about the practice of their culture
[41:28] of tokens
[41:31] and they knew what a token was
[41:34] and this was not a simple statement by
[41:37] brother branham
[41:38] he just mentioned it and passed
[41:41] over and went on made the point and went
[41:44] on
[41:45] but regard what he's talking about here
[41:49] the two portions
[41:52] oh my
[41:53] and this is what the the mistake of many
[41:58] even in the message
[42:00] thinking that the holy spirit
[42:02] just comes down upon the individual and
[42:06] then fills them
[42:08] and then they are filled with him
[42:11] but listen my friends
[42:13] the deep calls to the deep and the deep
[42:16] must respond
[42:18] there must be a part of that laundry tag
[42:23] there must be
[42:25] a portion a token of god in
[42:28] you so that you may receive the rest of
[42:33] the token what am i talking about i
[42:36] can't expand on all these parts but
[42:38] think of it here is the wife
[42:41] here is the husband
[42:43] here is the body here comes the hit ship
[42:47] it's coming together another uniting
[42:51] time another oneness when the great
[42:54] spirit of the living god from spirit
[42:58] with spirit will meet all glory to god
[43:01] the holy spirit comes to meet that part
[43:04] of himself that is buried within the
[43:07] elected seed of the of the living god
[43:10] amen leaving tokens of a living god and
[43:14] god comes to meet that part of himself
[43:19] like adam met that part of himself glory
[43:23] to god the weaker part of himself but he
[43:26] met her praise god and together there
[43:30] were one amen amen praise be to god
[43:35] hallelujah amen
[43:38] listen
[43:39] or praise god
[43:41] that chinese laundry man would take
[43:43] attack tear it in a certain way when you
[43:46] bring it back he take the other part
[43:48] match them together when you come to
[43:51] claim your belongings see and if that
[43:55] did not dovetail just exactly right
[43:59] amen
[44:00] and because he had one piece amen but if
[44:03] that did
[44:04] then you got
[44:06] what belongs to you when you possess the
[44:10] other part the other part of the con
[44:14] contract hallelujah so one part of the
[44:18] track the gene is in you here comes the
[44:22] blessed holy spirit amen
[44:25] and he comes to the gene that is in you
[44:29] and when your
[44:31] the gene in you and the spirit connects
[44:36] and they contact when the deep crawls to
[44:39] the deep and the shepherd calls to his
[44:41] sheep they come together as one they see
[44:45] eye to eye anything he says they say
[44:49] amen everything he says they see it they
[44:52] understand it they have a revelation
[44:55] about it because they were born mad that
[44:58] way praise god by the blessed holy
[45:01] spirit being in them glory to god now
[45:05] you understand
[45:08] still here
[45:10] when god
[45:12] why and when god tore his son
[45:15] into two parts
[45:17] at calvary
[45:19] and taking the body up as a
[45:21] sacrifice and then sent back down the
[45:25] holy spirit to us that once lived in a
[45:29] man jesus amen
[45:32] the same god was in a veil praise god
[45:36] but now those two pieces has come back
[45:41] to come together then
[45:45] if it comes to you you are a part of the
[45:48] contract oh glory to god hallelujah amen
[45:52] you see god did this
[45:55] so
[45:56] that he would know man better
[45:59] when he made himself
[46:02] man
[46:03] amen so he come back to living human
[46:07] beings he come back to living man he
[46:11] come back on the earth again
[46:14] to reveal himself and live true man
[46:19] this my friends we understand that is
[46:23] what he's talking about in a nice way is
[46:26] the revealing of the son of man
[46:29] hallelujah
[46:30] in a bright form living in his people
[46:34] and the holy spirit projecting and
[46:36] reflecting the very lights of god the
[46:40] brightness and effulgence of the holy
[46:43] spirit flowing through their lives
[46:45] thrown through their hearts
[46:47] effortlessly by the power of god amen
[46:50] hallelujah amen then he spoke about a
[46:55] certain king
[46:57] who loved his people
[46:59] and he loved them so much
[47:02] that he told his ministers look i'm
[47:04] going to leave this throne take off my
[47:07] robes and i'm going down to live amongst
[47:11] them like a plain man because i love
[47:15] them and i want to know what they are
[47:19] going through and we thank god that
[47:22] jesus was a king like that and he is a
[47:25] king like that who changed himself from
[47:28] the jehovah
[47:30] god amen changed his form amen and came
[47:34] down and dwelt among us emmanuel
[47:38] god with us a man in our midst walking
[47:41] and talking a god man for it was god in
[47:46] a man hallelujah that he might test
[47:49] death that he might taste all these
[47:51] things
[47:52] wash the feet of the lawley that he
[47:55] could be a friend my friends to those
[47:58] that are in
[48:00] the streets tonight the cold winter's
[48:03] night on being out there sleeping in a
[48:06] city street under some cardboard he came
[48:10] down that he might know you that he
[48:12] might know what folk are going through a
[48:16] man and lay decide his scar his purple
[48:19] robe oh praise god he slept in the woods
[48:23] he slept in the rocks amen and he became
[48:27] one of us that he may understand us and
[48:31] be a high priest that can be touched
[48:34] with the feeling of our
[48:37] infirmities
[48:40] oh praise god
[48:42] now i want to quote from
[48:45] the mighty god unveiled before us
[48:48] now god in the beginning
[48:52] was life the eternal one
[48:55] in him was attributes
[48:57] and those attributes
[48:59] became words
[49:04] and
[49:06] them words the word became flesh you see
[49:11] that is why the scripture says the
[49:13] fullness of the godhead was in him
[49:17] godlily praise god like all we all my
[49:21] father's children were in him praise god
[49:26] until they become manifested and
[49:28] expressed
[49:29] they were in him and the bible tells us
[49:33] that we were in him praise god but there
[49:37] were words and those words make up the
[49:42] word amen and the word
[49:47] became flesh praise god amen see
[49:53] and jesus was
[49:55] the redeemer of what and let me say this
[49:59] he was the redeemer for the rest of the
[50:02] words
[50:03] amen hallelujah amen and to redeem means
[50:07] to bring back glory to god and to bring
[50:11] it back it had to be somewhere else for
[50:15] you to bring it back to where it was to
[50:18] begin with
[50:19] hallelujah and i take god
[50:23] with the lifting of spiritual amnesia
[50:26] we can recognize that we come from god
[50:30] and we're going back to god hallelujah
[50:34] and so he came to redeem us back to god
[50:37] hallelujah as the scripture says that he
[50:41] redeemed us unto himself glory to god
[50:45] amen so all people
[50:48] will never see this
[50:52] because all people
[50:55] wasn't
[50:56] in the beginning
[50:58] in the thoughts
[51:00] of god
[51:02] amen page 11
[51:06] the mighty god unveiled before us
[51:11] you see i caught again
[51:14] all people
[51:16] will never be able to see it
[51:20] because all people
[51:22] was not in the beginning
[51:25] in god's thoughts
[51:28] oh
[51:29] let me show he says
[51:32] look at the priest
[51:34] amen
[51:35] he showed his nature he showed where it
[51:38] was from
[51:40] and called jesus the word
[51:43] beelzebub
[51:44] call him other names you see he was
[51:47] proving where he come from who he was
[51:51] but look at the little prostitute
[51:54] when jesus came to her
[51:58] she first of all that seed that germ
[52:01] began to open up and it opened up until
[52:05] she said when messiah comes he will do
[52:09] these things
[52:10] and jesus said i that speak to thee am
[52:14] he
[52:15] glory to god watch them two tags come
[52:18] together watch them two tokens come
[52:22] together the supreme talking and the
[52:25] living token of from a living god
[52:29] inside of a
[52:31] prostitute
[52:32] and yet it was a daughter of god a child
[52:36] of the king hallelujah and the holy
[52:38] spirit exposed the priest
[52:41] and redeemed the prostitute back to god
[52:45] where she came from hallelujah i thank
[52:48] god for the blessed holy spirit and the
[52:51] unveiling of god in this hour not the
[52:56] unveiling of god back there but the
[52:58] unveiling of this bride
[53:00] the revealing of the son of man
[53:03] god making himself known in this day in
[53:07] this time and in this hour by the
[53:09] blessed holy spirit praise god amen oh
[53:14] praise god thank god
[53:17] he has rent the veil
[53:20] i've spoken few weeks ago
[53:23] on the subject of
[53:25] inside and outside
[53:29] if you're inside you're seeing
[53:31] everything inside
[53:33] if you're outside you can't see anything
[53:36] we spoke
[53:37] on the
[53:40] pulling back the veil and how he pulled
[53:42] the veil back
[53:44] there when he was crucified on calvary
[53:48] veil of the temple was renting twain or
[53:51] praise god god pulled back the veil just
[53:55] as he's told brother branham that you
[53:58] pull back the veil now oh praise god and
[54:02] the prophet pulled back the veil and now
[54:06] we can enter in we look at the word and
[54:10] we see the unveiling of the word the
[54:12] revealing of the word of the living god
[54:16] in this day and in this hour praise god
[54:20] oh praise god listen i quote now page 31
[54:24] mighty god unveil before us think of it
[54:28] god the god of heaven unfolding himself
[54:32] making himself known the great king of
[54:36] glory let them fall down in the hearts
[54:40] of people that we might see this
[54:42] unveiled one the one who came down and
[54:47] rent the veil of the temple then went
[54:51] right behind right out of that veil and
[54:55] come right down into this veil into
[54:58] human veils
[55:00] again on the day of pentecost and it has
[55:04] ever been the same
[55:06] edge the edge changing from glory unto
[55:10] glory hallelujah blessed be the name of
[55:12] the lord friends so we see
[55:15] the deep calls to the deep
[55:19] and the deep must respond
[55:22] praise god
[55:24] the germ the gene
[55:26] calls our father
[55:28] and the holy spirit comes upon it amen
[55:32] and the two tags meet the two tokens
[55:36] meet hallelujah amen praise god of
[55:41] course
[55:42] we know
[55:43] the token
[55:44] is a seal it could be as the prophet
[55:47] said your boss talking your boss talking
[55:51] or it could be your plane ticket
[55:54] to ride in the skies or glory to god but
[55:58] we look at it now from the point of view
[56:01] that the token is the token in the
[56:04] believer is the believer's
[56:07] identification
[56:09] hallelujah
[56:11] it's the identification
[56:13] that you are under the king's protection
[56:17] because back in the old days
[56:21] the king would give a certain person a
[56:23] ring
[56:24] or give them a badge or give them some
[56:27] some little trinket and whenever anyone
[56:31] would see that they will dare not touch
[56:34] that person they were
[56:37] identified oh hallelujah they were
[56:41] protected amen and the death angel knew
[56:45] that and knows that that once you are
[56:49] under that seal that token of the living
[56:53] god amen you are not to be touched the
[56:57] devil knows it you are not to be touched
[57:00] you are protected because you're under
[57:04] the cover ring wings of the blood of
[57:07] jesus christ hallelujah amen
[57:10] hallelujah that blood
[57:13] the lamb's blood
[57:15] identifies you just as a natural life it
[57:19] identifies who really is your father
[57:23] glory to god hallelujah that little
[57:27] portion that tag in you it identifies
[57:32] your family origins of where you come
[57:35] from and where you are going going to
[57:40] also
[57:41] that's that token tells of your
[57:44] ownership
[57:45] who owns you amen thank god that the
[57:50] token shows your ownership and you are a
[57:53] living token of a living god hallelujah
[57:57] the god lives in you praise god and he's
[58:01] showing and identifying himself that he
[58:04] lives within you praise be to god
[58:08] amen that token also
[58:12] reveals the believers rank
[58:16] position
[58:18] in the world
[58:20] it reveals
[58:22] that you're of noble birth kings and
[58:25] priests to the living god
[58:27] in the olden days
[58:29] they would wear the token in various
[58:32] ways
[58:33] in some cultures it was a badge
[58:36] in other places
[58:38] it was a
[58:40] uh a sash that there wore across their
[58:43] body in some cultures
[58:46] it was a piece of the token was a piece
[58:50] of board or or or a metal or stone
[58:55] hanging on a string at their side and it
[58:58] told of their
[59:00] birth their
[59:02] their social status it told of their
[59:05] rank it spoke my friends of all these
[59:09] things praise god
[59:11] and certain uniforms and when you have
[59:14] on you the real token of god amen i tell
[59:19] you my friends there it
[59:22] identifies you every devil will know who
[59:25] you are without you having to say one
[59:28] word because you're a living token of
[59:32] the presence of the living god amen
[59:35] hallelujah amen of course
[59:39] as i've said before
[59:42] the token is a token of certification
[59:46] it's a token my friends
[59:50] that you're a certified son a certified
[59:53] seed son
[59:54] that you might
[59:56] my child my daughter in christ
[59:59] all my sons and daughters in christ to
[1:00:03] recognize that you are certified
[1:00:06] authenticated sons and daughters of god
[1:00:10] not by you saying it but because you
[1:00:13] already come you had nothing to do with
[1:00:16] it but in you was the deposit in you was
[1:00:20] the supreme treasure oh praise god

[1:01:18] hallelujah you're a sealed daughter of
[1:01:22] god sealed son of the living god amen or
[1:01:27] praise god when a message
[1:01:31] in those olden days was sent
[1:01:35] with a messenger
[1:01:37] by the king
[1:01:40] or was sent by a general
[1:01:43] or one of nobility
[1:01:46] in a very high possession
[1:01:50] the person bearing the message
[1:01:55] had to have a token
[1:01:59] and the king knew
[1:02:02] that when the person that was to receive
[1:02:05] the message when the messenger got there
[1:02:08] that
[1:02:09] that person
[1:02:11] would recognize that token
[1:02:15] hallelujah because the king would have
[1:02:17] shown it to them before
[1:02:21] so that when they see it again
[1:02:25] but now
[1:02:26] it's in the hands
[1:02:28] of a messenger
[1:02:30] they will recognize the token and that
[1:02:34] is what the elected seed of god have
[1:02:36] done we have recognized the messenger
[1:02:40] with the message from the king of glory
[1:02:44] speaking to our hearts to our souls amen
[1:02:47] we recognize it because the deep calls
[1:02:51] to the deep not for healing
[1:02:53] not for discernment but it's calling for
[1:02:57] the third pull the great magnet has come
[1:03:00] down and pulling and drawing his sons
[1:03:04] and daughters unto himself oh thank god
[1:03:07] for the living tokens of today living

[1:03:16] towns of fire hallelujah amen oh glory
[1:03:20] to god hallelujah amen oh praise god you
[1:03:26] have to have a talking
[1:03:29] to receive the message
[1:03:33] in certain situations
[1:03:36] when the king sent a messenger
[1:03:40] he would
[1:03:42] break a seal one of his seal
[1:03:45] he will break one of his seals
[1:03:48] and give a half the messenger
[1:03:51] and the other half would be given to
[1:03:54] that general
[1:03:55] that spy
[1:03:57] or that nobility that he wanted to
[1:04:00] receive that message
[1:04:02] so when the messenger got there
[1:04:06] to that person
[1:04:07] he would not deliver that message he'll
[1:04:11] just tell them i have a message
[1:04:14] i must deliver this message
[1:04:17] it is a supernatural message
[1:04:20] it's a wonderful message
[1:04:23] hallelujah but he really cannot give
[1:04:27] that message
[1:04:28] to that person because the very message
[1:04:31] that he has it's sealed he's only the
[1:04:34] bearer of the message
[1:04:36] but if the one to whom he brings that
[1:04:39] message
[1:04:41] has the other tag or the other piece
[1:04:44] of the king seal
[1:04:47] that the two of them will match it
[1:04:50] together
[1:04:52] and when they're fit he'll just hand
[1:04:55] over the message to that person's
[1:04:57] keeping oh praise god aren't you glad
[1:05:01] that god placed that gene in you knowing
[1:05:04] that he was going to send a messenger

[1:05:20] the lord you'll recognize that it's the
[1:05:23] word of the living god hallelujah thank
[1:05:27] god that the prophet
[1:05:30] talking
[1:05:31] came
[1:05:32] to the

[1:06:05] their hands talk about it explain it

[1:06:13] is always there to peep and mutter and
[1:06:15] sneak and try to find what's behind
[1:06:18] what's under the seals and everything
[1:06:20] else and all he will get my friends is
[1:06:24] the rima of the world all he'll get my
[1:06:27] friends is that part of it but the real
[1:06:31] logos that only comes to god's elected
[1:06:35] few and they must have that part of the
[1:06:39] gene within them so what when the holy
[1:06:42] spirit anoints the word from the
[1:06:44] prophet's lips glory to god the message
