TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because it's not going to solve the problem. It's the height of stupidity when they do that. That's right. And they stand before the neighbor to answer because that's not how God brings deliverance. The scripture that says God so loved the world, he looked at the stinky world. He looked at a crooked world. He looked at a world filled with disease, filled with despair. He looked at a world filled with deception, and he loved it. Can you can you distinctly deliberately condition your mind when you leave the space to start looking at people nice color hair? Oh, I love that that breeze. How those girls that African woman look she said you're so beautiful, strong. And you know what? when she walks up here at some point maybe said gosh man I wish I had here sisters I wish I had here these sisters because you know what when I get my hair fixed I'm going to scream out and stuff to hold it tight because the moment I go out in the whip what happened but the sister she goes up there and she just go as she in the whip And it's just the same way. When there's not, everything has done its purpose and it's there's a time that people detested dark skin still. A lot of people lying on the beach right now. Right now the best skin is halfway. Burn it up. Burn the saloon. Get burned up. Bring yourself that way. And then next thing you know, you saw a sister coming in and then all of a sudden you see something strange. Look at some of the stars and all of a sudden they go to get some shaking their lips so they should be like mine. You know how silly we've been through world history and then it changes around let's stop and say thank you Lord for [Applause] who hallelujah the word but he gave his opening go and make a gift now is a problem I have conservative Christians in America not have it I don't know about the behavior of Catholic. They have this passion for righteousness. They say and Lord is like put that in. They say they have a passion for righteousness. And so the whole theme in America is they have selected some bad behavior, homosexuality, abortion, and they selected some bad behavior. In their mind, they feel they're about to do something about it. And the way they're going to do something about it, we can put some laws in these people. We're going to do this. All hatred and and people are marching and chanting and hatred and crying and suffering and and angst and attitude and the conservative church of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Now the whole mission is to attack bad people. That is what we know. Stop and think what is going on there. They are attacking people that in their minds are bad. They are attacking them. It used to be the world used to persecute the church, but my wife told me one day, she said, you know, look like the church is persecuting the world. They are persecuting and they're attacking people in the world. Listen how deceived and deluded that is. I don't care how. I don't care. But regardless of how wrong people are, how sinful they are, uh how degraded they are, Jesus never approached them with hate and judgment and condemnation. Amen. The scripture just read there, it says he came not into the world to condemn the world, but to save. So he saw people, it doesn't matter what intervention, as an opportunity to give them love and to give them redemption perhaps because all men will not receive. But it doesn't matter. He will make sure everyone has received the gift of love and kindness and an extended arm. Come unto me all you who labor and they're pimilated and hanging in your wrist. The conservative church is not behaving like Jesus. They just got to stop and think because Jesus said, "I came not into the world to condemn the world. I came to save him." It's a seeking to save it. And who do you seek and save? People are lost. People are in trouble. And you're not going to save people by watching them in the morning and say, "You stinking rat. Look at you. You're dirty as dog. You look at you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at your hand. Save the person if you want to save that person. Oh my god. Come quickly. The person is in the m compassion. Pull the person up. Get some water. Wash them up. That's how you rescue. You know how serious it is. Many times I see some guys over the mountains mountains in the snow and then they get stuck in the mountain rest of a million dollars for this joker up there just because he can go up in the mountain. He's up there and get stuck in a mountain. They do over every year it's happening. Somebody get stuck in a mountain somewhere. A helicopter's got to go. Millions of dollars are spent to get them out. But what happens when that guy acts so silly that cause that? I think it's silly. But help yourself. I can't judge them if they get energy and follow the light that I have no condemnation with them. But I'm looking into say you know what happened when a guy goes up there and gets into trouble that stuff or two to get him off that ledge. People are endangered. Rescue squads are in danger. But they do it joyfully. They do it heroically. They feel their heroes. We going to rescue. We res the heroes. Somebody did something they shouldn't get back. And they bring them out. Everybody's cheering on the news. Brought him down. What about others who stuck not on a mountain ledge, but they're stuck in the ghetto. They're stuck in sin somewhere. They're stuck in the dirt somewhere. They're stuck in all kind of bad behavior. Where are the heroes that could behave like Jesus when Jesus said, "I came to see to save them. I'm going after them. I want to get them." And the way he went after the sinner was, he bled to death for them. Right now, we want to kill those sinners. Conservative churches want to harm people that haven't lived up to the standard. You know, Dr. God looked down at earth and he gave Jesus, he saw nobody that believed him up to the standard. All sin will come short of the glory of God. Everybody was sinful. Everybody was born in sin and shaped in iniquity. And I want you to listen carefully to this what I'm saying. I repeat this everywhere I go. this miracle, this wonder, this majesty that causes you to say, "I'm saved. I'm redeemed." This is how it happened. Jesus said, "You saw me. You're a liar. You're a thief. You're a fornicator. You're an adulterer. You're full of anger. You cheat people. You hurt people. You beat up your wife. You hurt your kids. You're despicable in the job. You don't know what you're supposed to do to get paid, but you don't do what you're prepared to do. You're cheating people. God looked, he saw the whole thing. He saw homosexuality. He saw adultery. He saw fornication. He saw everything. It's when he saw all that, he says, "I love the world, and I'm going to do something about it." Glor. love that God has made had and has made him give something for their help and their redemption. People are suffering in America, they want to take away the healthcare because they want to play a game and do money games to it because somebody will get more if the health care is positioned this way. They get more money out of it and then somebody's mad with someone else is getting a deep cut in this and so they'll say with healthcare in America, oh we got a fortune, we got a fortune. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. If my wife is dying, do you think any amount of money is a question? That's the mind that I have. If I have a child, if I have a wife, if I have mother and somebody and they're in desperate strength and they're about to die and I get $10 million, I go to see the baby. I said, "No, no, baby. We got 10 million if we really try get you to the doctor and catch your monster." Is that how you think? Is that what people are thinking about? Oh, don't say they're thinking in that way because you know what? They're never thinking about themselves. Sometime well, but they're talking about what other people do. Don't get taken away from them, right? Some of them don't deserve because they're lazy. When Jesus came to say, he never even said whether they're lazy or not. Jesus came and he reached out to the lazy and the liars and the thieves and the fornicator and the trumpets everything. He saw all of us and they're on the cross. Father, forgive them and know what they do. Look, this is the hardest part of this statistically right now somebody people all over the world are having sex right now. They're fornicating right now. They committed adultery right this moment. Homosexual acts are being performed right now somewhere in the earth. Sometimes some places the earth is not and some are creeping in places with prostitutes and they're doing all of those things. Whatever they're going to do, somebody's being killed for $20. Somebody It was like that when God so loved the world. It was like that when Jesus died for them while we are yet in sin. What happened? Could you think carefully? This brain of Christianity that have this posture that this person is a fornicate, this person is a thief and so forth and I'm going to try to hurt them. You know what I see as that spirit is from the devil. Let me tell you why. It it enates those type of people and they hate the church. And that's exactly the effect that spirit want. It wants that those type of people whoever they may be whatever sins they are to hate the church. I don't want to hear nothing the church has to say. And the devil is laughing because why ugly things Christians will say about those type of people and bapt I don't want to go to that church. All anything Christians is hurtful. That's the effect. But Jesus on the opposite side, he said, "Come unto me all you who labor under heaven. Come fornicators. Come adulterers. Come homosexuals. Come drunkers. Come liars. Come. Just come. My arms are open to you. I'm not standing up looking like disgusting slime. That's the energy coming out of too much of the church and God is speaking singing to me. I weep many times and I'm baffled. I'm saying God, how could they behave this way? The wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God. That's right. Your wrath and your anger is not going to bring salvation. Amen. Salvation only comes by an act of redemptive love and it comes from the one who has this unconditional lovability. That's right. He loved us unconditionally. So when Jesus was dying on the cross, he who he dying who was he dying for the sins of the world. He was dying for everybody. That's right. And that everybody there was somebody that he was dying for that was committing a a fornication act, an adultery act, was committing a homosexual act. That somebody is lay waiting and calling somebody running away with their money and he is dying to that very person. We as believers have got to get back to the call of the master. Listen to him. We listen too often to denominations and organizations and they have their own polities and policies and we begin to let the voice of Jesus stay away. Jesus said follow me. The voice of heaven said this is my beloved son here. Listen to what I say. But people had listened to every voice. They listened to every argument here argument there on the internet and the television and everybody spewing hate spewing chopping people down. They graing people. Yet still when Jesus came all he did was love. [Music] So what could they be bad behavior? It's none of your business. Your business is your bad behavior. That's the that's the concern. The most eager the most important concern is how are you? What is your behavior? Are we going to behave like Jesus did? That's what we got to strike for. And when we see Jesus, we saw the woman taken in the very act of And the holy ones rushed and they poked the love and said this man behaving weird. Where was the man? They weren't even judging right away. I don't know what happened. But only the woman there. And then Bible shows this. Jesus said if you have no s they couldn't do it. Now there was one there who had no sin. Jesus. He said if they want to do this throwing stone stone be sinless and they walk away they have hidden stuff. But here is Jesus. He had no sin and still the sinless one showed us what to do. Forgiven you could do better. Jesus, get away from them. Get away from these righteous people. They want to kill you because God caught you. Look, this thing is so bad. This spirit that has brought this mindset is so bad that in churches people look at someone and said and some of you been in company you heard that stuff I hope I'm just using the name brother And then before we know it, it begin to walk. And then sister begin to be shocked. Jack, sister, push it away. How did you talk to your husband? Push it away. Sh. And look what that means. They don't know anything. They're suspecting and they want to harm you. This is how bad it is. Jesus was brought a woman taken in the very act. It can't get any worse than that. She was not. She was caught in the very act. And Jesus is extricating her loosing over the stone. He's telling them you want the stone. You got to know what you're doing. Put them at the spot. They look at her, "Go you where you s of trouble." Love covers a multitude of sins. So when you're operating in love, you're not a peep and destroy person. You hear what I'm saying? You're not a peep and destroy. You're not peeping at people peeping in the line. You want to find them. You always do it. And then you don't see anything. All you do is you suspect somebody and you don't like them. Now Jesus said these people may suspect this woman. They know she did it. She go and get you to get this. You got to get there. Amen. So you shouldn't even think about presenting people to God that look suspicious to you. If they look suspicious and it's scary suspicion, you have to pray. Amen. And pray good prayers towards them. Oh, God. Help a person to rise in the name of Jesus through God. Whatever difficulties you're going through, Lord, bless the Lord. Jesus said, I came to seek and save. And so the whole thing I came not into the world to condemn the word, but the word through me like save. So now if you operating in love, this is what love does. Bible says God so loved what he gave. Love is a giving thing of this love that came from God made him gave. It's only God's son. Amen. So I would like to see all these people see all the sins in America, everywhere, look sinful. Look at your bad. Let's raise some offering bread. Let's go. We sacrifice. Let's t let's go. We're going to go there and feed them and be nice to them and kind of them. I would like to see the church get a group of brothers if there's a gay march going on there and they're protesting. They're angry. I'd like to see some church get there and wear some nice outfits that says God loves us all. Don't just have it and say God loves you. God, you're not putting off. Yeah. No, God loves you anyway. He loves you anymore. No, God loves us all. You know, that's how I got saved by my condemnation. That's how you got saved. Don't forget, wear a t-shirt say God loves us all. And finally, they have that gay march. And then they prepare and get bottles of water cold water. bought cold water and some sandwiches and actually just and just go out there and when they come by certain corner just wait until they and just smile and give them a cold a bottle of cold water and give them some sandwiches to eat and so forth. Don't make a commentary on their sin. The Bible says this is the condemnation that men that light is coming to the world and men love darkness rather than light and their deeds are evil. So in other words, what people do does them You don't have to add insult to injury. The wages of sin is death. So if I'm going to be a lifegiver, I can't add insult to injury. This person is on the road of death. So I'm not going to send them a head faster. I'm going to push them over the cliff by cursing them. I'm nearing them. They're doing the right. And Christ is a hand extended to bring them a slave. And you give them no doctor. Have a good day. Take care and slide. Give them something. No. No. No. No. Get them to church. No. Or you do that when somebody comes here. You get a problem. You listen call. All I'm saying is do like Jesus did. Amen. Amen. Do like the savior does. He came not into the world to judge the world. I'm closing off by saying this. You see all this judging people are doing it. Jesus clearly say to the followers of Jesus, "Judge, lest you be judged." It doesn't feel good for people to judge you, especially when you know you're right. You haven't done anything wrong for you to judge him. Amen. Don't give it that ugly spirit. Don't give the spirit of judgment because Jesus said it clearly. I was sent by the father to the world and I came not to judge the world. Why do you feel you're following Jesus by judging me? When Jesus said, "I am sent to the mission not to judge but to seek and say, stay right there. Seek and say and then they don't want to change it. They want to stay nasty." The Bible says, "Let him let the filthy let be filthy still. And let those who be holy be holy still. They have a choice. Yes. But we have no choice in the matter deciding whether we're going to condemn them or judge them because we are not given that qualification. We not qualified to do it. That's right. We don't have the [Music] qualification. Look at the crooked judgment of the woman taking an act of adultery. If it was a just judgment, they would have got the man too. We fall short. I don't want you to have that. The only part I want you to have is do it like my son did. Just give gifts. Love people. Love sinners and whatever. That's the ending. That's the whole D. That's the whole commitment of Christians. Be nice. Be kind. Fill the atmosphere with goodness. Let the church come under a greater anointing where people see a change in direction and disposition. That's right. Don't cause people to be hating the church and alienated from the church because you're attacking them and judging them. You're out of place when you judge them because there is a judgment day and the one who knows how to judge does it right because angels are walking around all the time and writing them. The Bible says in book of revelation and then the bread might show judgment. The books are going to be open and it's going to be not right. Amen. That's right. When people go to the judgment, when we judge people, a lot of people go down that were innocent. Check the courts out. Check the jails. We can't do it. And God is not putting this high gift of salvation in the hands of people or bumbling detectives. We don't do it right and we can't do it right. Only he knows how to do it right because he got he's got this thing surrounded 24/7 angels and checking it and keep it and say on that day this is his job. So don't get in God's way and do his job. Do the job that you are supposed to do. Follow Jesus. Be kind. Go from here intentionally. See people in your job that you used to just ignore. Stop and just go from your smile. That's right. And differently towards them. Somebody that hurt your feeling. Just go for them. Just say something nice. Make a conversation. small talk and just because you are a living epist read the Bible they're going to look at me and you and you're going to be clue as to if this thing is really about what she's I can't believe what she has I couldn't drink that I look she's smiling and she's coming I want that that's peace that's joy it's righteousness and joy in the morning praise God hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] Thank God for the opportunity to come here and share with you. Listen carefully to what I'm saying. This is recorded. Listen to again and again and again. I'm bringing no new doctrine. I'm just reaffirming what a master said. Listen to what he said. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the spirit is saying, of the church. Father, I give you thanks this day for the opportunity to lift you up. And I ask, oh God, that we wrap our hearts around. Give us a new energy, a new direction, a new sense of your presence. Give us the creativity to go distinctly intentionally loving people and treating people kindly. Those that we avoided, those that we disliked, let them become our first objective to change the paradigm. Help us to go to them tomorrow at work in our neighborhood. Do something like overcome the hate, the good. Let love, the light of love, cast away the darkness. Thanks, Lord. And I glorify your name. Amen. Amen. God love you and by God's grace, we will see you again at another time. [Applause] They just getting ready to Okay. Bless you. [Applause] Praise God for that. Amen. Yes.
