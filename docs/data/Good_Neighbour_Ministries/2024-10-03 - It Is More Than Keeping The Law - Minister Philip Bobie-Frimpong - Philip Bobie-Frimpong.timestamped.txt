[17:34] pains you touch him and let your perfect
[17:37] will be done in his life in Jesus name
[17:40] amen hallelujah so um today
[17:44] is um Bible study so think I'm going to
[17:49] be reading a lot of scriptures back and
[17:51] forth maybe three or four scriptures so
[17:54] um you get have to get your Bible
[17:57] ready our first
[18:00] scripture will be taken
[18:03] from Mark chapter
[18:05] 10 verse
[18:08] 17 to
[18:13] 30
[18:20] okay
[18:22] think okay
[18:25] yeah Mark chapter 10
[18:44] strange okay yeah
[18:47] and when he was gone forth into the
[18:52] way there came one running and kneeled
[18:56] to him and asked him good
[18:59] Master what shall I do that I may
[19:02] inherit eternal
[19:04] life and Jus said unto him why callest
[19:08] thou me good there is none good but one
[19:14] that is
[19:15] God thou knowest the Commandments do not
[19:19] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[19:24] do not bear false witness the fraud not
[19:27] honor thy father father and mother and
[19:30] he answered and said unto him master all
[19:34] these have I observed from my youth in
[19:37] the Matthew said all this have I kept
[19:40] from my youth so I'm going to um my
[19:44] topics everything based on here all this
[19:47] have I kept from my youth so if I'm
[19:49] going to um titled it's going to
[19:53] be um it is more than keeping the law
[19:57] then J says behold him loved him and
[20:00] said unto him one thing thou
[20:03] liketh go thy way sell whatever thou
[20:07] Hast and give to the poor and thou shall
[20:10] have treasure in heaven and come take up
[20:14] the cross and follow me and he was sad
[20:18] at that saying and went away
[20:21] grieved for he had great
[20:26] possessions and Jesus looked around
[20:29] about and said unto his disciples how
[20:32] hardly shall the that have riches enter
[20:35] into the kingdom of God and the
[20:38] disciples were astonished at his words
[20:41] but Jesus answered again and said unto
[20:43] them children how hard is it for them
[20:47] that trust in riches to enter into the
[20:51] kingdom of God it is easier for a camel
[20:54] to go through the eye of a needle than
[20:57] for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
[20:59] of God and they were astonished out of
[21:02] measure saying among themselves who then
[21:06] can be
[21:07] saved and Jesus looking upon them with
[21:11] men it is
[21:14] impossible but With
[21:17] God all things not some things all
[21:20] things are possible then began Peter to
[21:24] say unto him Lo we have left all
[21:30] and have followed thee that means that
[21:32] if you really become a Christian you
[21:34] have to leave
[21:35] everything and Jesus answered and said
[21:38] ver I say unto you there is no man that
[21:41] had left house or Brethren or sisters or
[21:45] father or mother or wife or children or
[21:48] LS for my sake and the gospels but he
[21:54] shall receive aund foot now in this
[21:59] this
[22:02] time but he shall receive 100 fold now
[22:05] in this time houses and Brethren and
[22:08] sisters and mothers and children and LS
[22:12] with persecution and in the world to
[22:15] come eternal life Heavenly Father may
[22:20] you please bless the reading of your
[22:23] word in the name of our Lord Jesus
[22:26] Christ amen amen please be
[22:30] seated um I first got this
[22:34] thought couple of weeks or maybe a month
[22:37] when our pastor Danny was preaching and
[22:39] he talk
[22:41] about some people when you meet them
[22:44] they said that they do not commit they
[22:48] have not killed they not commit any sin
[22:51] I don't know if some of you have met
[22:53] people all the time you talk them oh I'm
[22:55] good Phil me I don't go after anybody's
[23:00] wife um I'm good I'm I I don't I don't
[23:05] go for anybody's wife I don't steal I
[23:08] don't Mur I don't do this I'm good but
[23:12] the scripture was saying here they said
[23:14] there's not good only God is
[23:18] good so that's what the people they
[23:21] think by themselves keeping the law made
[23:25] them good but the Bible said that there
[23:28] is none good only the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:32] is good amen so the problem we have is
[23:37] that the Rich Young
[23:39] Ruler he has obeyed all those laws from
[23:44] his
[23:45] youth but he still realized that he La
[23:48] something so it's not about following
[23:51] the
[23:52] laws but I believe it's all about when
[23:56] the word of God for your day
[23:59] is presented to you at your time of
[24:01] living how you approach it how you
[24:05] regard it because that Rich Young Ruler
[24:10] he obey all the
[24:11] laws but he still knows he lacks
[24:14] something there's not a person in this
[24:18] world
[24:19] that have not met the Lord say chist
[24:23] that in his heart he knew that he lacked
[24:26] something it doesn't matter how rich he
[24:28] has or how religious he is if he hasn't
[24:31] met God for his time there is something
[24:35] missing in that person's life amen they
[24:39] it doesn't matter how they shout how
[24:41] they scream if they don't have the Holy
[24:44] Ghost they have not been fully born
[24:47] again and they don't know which that
[24:50] which they know that they know that they
[24:51] know it is they know there's something
[24:54] lacking and that lacking God put a
[24:57] thirst of him s in every human heart and
[25:00] only him can satisfy that heart so to be
[25:05] at rest you have to meet God for your
[25:08] time of
[25:09] visitation and
[25:12] remember
[25:13] Moses was also a rich young man in his
[25:18] time you
[25:20] know the same God that the Rich Young
[25:24] Ruler met is the same one that Moses met
[25:27] when Moses Moses met him he was in the
[25:30] form of Pillar of Fire and he spoke to
[25:33] Moses yes from that H from that fire
[25:37] from that light but you remember when
[25:40] the Lord Jesus Christ was here he said
[25:42] that before Abraham was I am in other
[25:45] words he was trying to refer to them
[25:47] that that bush that fire that Moses met
[25:50] that has put on flesh and is standing
[25:53] right in their face and when that word
[25:56] became flesh and standing in the face of
[25:59] the wrong ruler despite that he has kept
[26:02] all the laws from his youth he still
[26:05] couldn't accept that word for his day
[26:08] but
[26:09] Moses he killed
[26:13] somebody because he was young man strong
[26:17] and he recognized that he is the one
[26:20] that has to lead the children of Israel
[26:22] because since his youth his mom has been
[26:24] telling him that you were a proper child
[26:27] you were born for this purpose and he
[26:29] knew he was the one has to do it but the
[26:32] problem that Moses had like most of us
[26:35] have is that we try to do things by our
[26:38] own selves he TR that he's strong he's a
[26:43] military man he's intelligent more than
[26:47] all the Pharaohs he can even teach them
[26:49] he has high form of Education he knows
[26:53] all the knowledge and everything the
[26:54] craft military man he can lead the war
[26:58] and do everything so he trust in his own
[27:01] strength so when he trust his own
[27:04] strength his own ability he failed
[27:07] miserably am he tried to do it by
[27:09] himself he end up killing somebody and
[27:12] he has to run for his life but it
[27:15] doesn't matter how he killed somebody
[27:18] when that word of God came in front of
[27:21] him he receed it
[27:24] gladly but this man has let a moral
[27:28] clean life since his youth on but when
[27:32] the word was presented to him he denyed
[27:35] it amen and based on that some people
[27:39] can deny the word of God but they still
[27:42] can go on and prosper this man denied
[27:45] the word of God he rejected it but the
[27:48] Bible said that his b got full he became
[27:51] so rich rich that he got to a place that
[27:56] he said that um I'm going to have what a
[27:58] fan or whatever to rest he was so his f
[28:01] everything went on well for him and in
[28:04] between then God gave him another chance
[28:07] La just passed by him and he just gave L
[28:11] those crumps did not repent for the
[28:13] second time he gave he had a second
[28:16] chance he still Let It Go by but in the
[28:20] end he went to wrong place he was also
[28:25] begging what Lazarus for water but
[28:29] Abraham said that a distance is so far
[28:32] he can't help you so all it doesn't
[28:34] matter all obeying the law without the
[28:39] Holy Ghost without meeting God for
[28:41] yourself without expression without
[28:43] receiving the word for the hour the law
[28:46] that you obeying doesn't mean
[28:48] nothing it's all works it doesn't mean
[28:51] nothing you are not saved by works you
[28:53] are saved by grace and grace alone work
[28:57] comeing in appreciation to what God has
[29:00] done for you so it's not the wor that
[29:02] you have done or I have done it's the
[29:05] grace of God and when the same thing was
[29:07] presented to Moses he accepted it gladly
[29:11] amen let me read a little thing for you
[29:13] over here amen praise God
[29:18] hallelujah I'm excited
[29:21] now and this young fellow proved that he
[29:24] was a fine cultured boy not just some
[29:29] what we call today a hod I think this is
[29:31] from the investment he was a fine type
[29:34] of boy being raised up in a good
[29:38] home he said Master I've done these
[29:41] things since I was a
[29:44] boy all my life he's followed the law
[29:48] man see he showed that his parents was
[29:52] nice parents he went to a church that
[29:55] believe in keeping the Commandments but
[29:58] yet in the church keeping the
[30:00] Commandments still didn't answer what he
[30:03] saw in Jesus he knew with all with our C
[30:09] and with our church and keeping the
[30:11] Commandments still doesn't give us
[30:13] eternal life it did not then neither
[30:18] does it do it today there is something
[30:21] you've got to do now you find that it
[30:24] wasn't because that he wasn't a church
[30:26] member it wasn't because he wasn't
[30:28] morally right he was but you can be a
[30:32] church member and morally right still
[30:36] not obtain eternal life not to know the
[30:40] word some of them are theologians and
[30:42] Scholars and Sunday school teachers
[30:45] Bible Expos test but that doesn't mean
[30:49] anything Satan knows that Bible better
[30:52] than any of us the Bible said to know
[30:55] him is life
[30:58] not know the word know him is life Satan
[31:03] also believe and trembles but we've got
[31:06] to have an experience of a death burial
[31:11] and Resurrection from our old life to
[31:14] the new life which comes in Christ it
[31:17] comes only by what the Holy Spirit of
[31:21] the new
[31:22] life I know this is a very simple topic
[31:25] that I'm saying but I believe that God
[31:28] is also in Simplicity amen so with all
[31:32] that he has he couldn't what make it so
[31:36] it's good to come to
[31:38] church I'm not saying don't come to
[31:41] church but don't come to don't bring the
[31:43] people Church bring the people to Christ
[31:46] you must come into Christ he's the
[31:48] Fountain of Life and The Giver of all
[31:50] good things coming to church obeying all
[31:52] the regions is all good you can even
[31:55] preach the gospel you still going to
[31:56] missx it it comes back back to said
[31:58] somewh said that if you have ch you have
[32:01] all give all your poor your all
[32:03] everything to the people have faith to
[32:06] move mountains do all this without
[32:08] charity which is Grace it means nothing
[32:12] and that charity is the Holy Ghost amen
[32:14] so you are blessed tonight that you have
[32:18] the Holy Ghost you have recognized what
[32:20] God is doing in your day and you believe
[32:23] it and you have believe in it so you
[32:26] have received the Holy Ghost but if you
[32:28] know that you don't know what you know
[32:30] and you're lacking something then I
[32:32] encourage you online wherever you are
[32:34] you got to seek God you have to be
[32:36] desperate for the best right because
[32:39] that's the only thing that when he SE I
[32:41] will pass over you we that angel that
[32:45] angel will go and seal only those who
[32:49] cry and sigh for the abomination of the
[32:51] sins of the world only those who have
[32:52] the blood tag when I see the blood I
[32:56] will pass over you so it's having the
[32:59] Holy Ghost the birth right that is more
[33:01] important than anything else this Young
[33:04] Ruler he was young and Rich but I
[33:07] believe that
[33:10] Moses was more famous and richer than
[33:14] him in his time because Moses was to be
[33:16] the next Pharaoh just like American
[33:19] president but in the Bible here in um in
[33:25] Hebrews he said by faith Hebrew
[33:28] 11:24 by faith Moses when he was come to
[33:32] years refused to be called the son of
[33:35] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[33:38] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[33:42] than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a
[33:46] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[33:49] greater
[33:50] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[33:54] he had respect on the recompense of the
[33:57] what by faith he forsook Egypt not
[34:01] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[34:04] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[34:07] in other words in other words
[34:11] Moses was like more richer more f
[34:15] everything than that Rich Young Ruler
[34:18] but he forsook everything and followed
[34:23] Christ so is everyone of us tonight
[34:28] some of us maybe on the high r with the
[34:30] rich and everything they left everything
[34:33] and follow Christ that's what um Peter
[34:37] said Lord we are forsaken everything
[34:40] what are we going to get in return He
[34:42] said that there's none that has left all
[34:44] this things that will not be blessed in
[34:46] this world and what the world to come so
[34:51] I encourage you doesn't matter what you
[34:53] have left have confidence that God is
[34:57] going to bless you in the present tense
[35:00] and the world to come somewhere David
[35:03] said that in Psalms he said that no good
[35:06] thing will he uphold from those that
[35:10] walk uprightly before him he said that
[35:13] the long lion like
[35:15] it but the um they that obey God they
[35:22] that love God there's nothing that I
[35:25] will what take away from that think
[35:29] 34:4 so if you with all your heart
[35:32] follow the lord Jesus Christ I believe
[35:35] that there's nothing that he going to
[35:38] you going to take it any no good thing
[35:41] will God take it away from you if you do
[35:45] not get something it means that maybe it
[35:48] might not be good for you at the right
[35:51] time if you need is good for you he
[35:53] going to give it to you and he's a good
[35:56] God so it's not not about the law it's
[35:59] about you
[36:01] recognizing what God is doing for your
[36:04] day and what leaving it we have so many
[36:09] examples when he preached I was working
[36:11] I hope I can recollect everything
[36:13] something came on me and it opened to me
[36:15] so much everywhere in the scriptures I I
[36:18] hope I can bring it the way that it
[36:21] became so clear to me hallelujah amen
[36:25] amen we have examples
[36:28] with Esau and
[36:29] Jacob the Bible saidah said that Esau
[36:32] was more gentleman than Jacob and he was
[36:36] so gentleman and so good that he always
[36:40] go and kill H and give to his that he
[36:44] almost received his Prophet
[36:47] Daddy but Jacob was a supplanter he was
[36:51] a deceiver he deceived this he did this
[36:54] he did that he did that so all that
[36:57] Christian is about it's not about good
[37:00] work brother or sister then if it's
[37:03] about good work then the Muslims are far
[37:05] because they pray like seven times a day
[37:08] some people they don't like their their
[37:13] um they they are loyal to their wives
[37:17] they are loyal to their husband they
[37:19] don't steal morally they live clean
[37:23] life but that doesn't mean nothing amen
[37:27] that the difference is when that person
[37:30] life is messed up and Christ comes into
[37:34] his life and it changes that person from
[37:37] the inside out that makes a difference
[37:41] it's not what is on the outside that is
[37:43] most important is the inside thing when
[37:46] the people met Christ nobody will tell
[37:49] them don't do this don't do that don't
[37:51] do that don't do that because they have
[37:53] met Christ the word of God hallelujah
[37:56] they become rest amen they don't do it
[37:59] by their own works or their own efforts
[38:01] anymore that's why he that is of heavy
[38:03] laden come unto me and I will give rest
[38:06] unto your soul God wants us to rest on
[38:10] him so that he can take us through he
[38:13] going to ride the trail through you and
[38:15] me he doesn't need your effort we live
[38:17] in a time of day that all the demons
[38:21] from the time of nimrod and all those
[38:23] things are
[38:24] here but all those
[38:28] Spirit of Christ from Noah Abraham they
[38:31] also here so greater is he that is in
[38:33] you than me he that the world so God
[38:37] recognized that no man he can't trust
[38:40] this with anybody now he has to come
[38:42] himself to be his own interpreter to
[38:45] live in our heart and live his life
[38:47] through us so that we can overcome the
[38:50] enemy we can overcome the Temptation
[38:52] because without God himself in you
[38:55] leading this life you're going to be
[38:57] mess up you crumble your marriage
[38:59] whatever it is all going to be cramped
[39:02] if you have a proper marriage you live
[39:04] with your wife for day is the grace of
[39:06] God it's God that is keeping that
[39:08] marriage because in the time that you
[39:10] are living it takes the grace of God the
[39:13] devil attacked the homes he knows the
[39:16] homes the foundation so he attack the
[39:18] homes he messed up the people's life and
[39:21] the only way that you survive I survive
[39:24] is the grace of God because God who
[39:26] created heaven El has come inside you he
[39:29] lives inside of you inside of me so he
[39:32] take control of your house he take
[39:34] control of your temple you become the
[39:36] temple of God Amen the Bible said that
[39:39] you have become the Temple of the Living
[39:42] God and He Who that defiles that Temple
[39:45] God will destroy him destroy him so you
[39:48] that God live inside of you is his
[39:53] grace you didn't choose it's a s Grace
[39:58] that came into your life amen that he
[40:01] has lived his life through you amen just
[40:05] like John Wesley said when he saw that
[40:07] bomb the drunen said there I am by the
[40:11] grace of God so is a Grace that is
[40:14] keeping you that is keeping me so let's
[40:17] thank god let's appreciate him let's
[40:20] give him all when you look at what he
[40:22] has done for us it encourag us to thank
[40:25] him more to praise him to glorify his
[40:28] name out of billions he came to you he
[40:30] came to me he save you the question of
[40:33] when he came to you he save you and he
[40:36] seal you listen the enemy means knows
[40:41] that is getting to end time Israel is at
[40:45] War and the Bride is a spiritual Israel
[40:49] they hav attack all FR firing they
[40:52] fighting on you can't stay uh like that
[40:56] you got to go on your and pray you got
[40:58] to do the part that you have to do
[41:00] because the battle going on the greatest
[41:02] battle ever fought is going on now so
[41:05] what the enemy does he can come and
[41:07] attack oh you are not saved oh you are
[41:09] not a good Christian oh you have done
[41:12] this oh you have done that oh you look
[41:14] at what you did he's going to bring all
[41:16] kind of mistakes to you but what I
[41:19] encourage you to remember that you are
[41:22] saved when God save you save once and
[41:24] for all you are a son or a daughter of
[41:27] God your condition doesn't change your
[41:30] position when it comes to letting know
[41:32] that you are a son of God I am a
[41:35] daughter of God I saved God has
[41:37] confirmed me being saving going to
[41:39] heaven salvation that thing is it
[41:41] shouldn't even bother a true Christian
[41:43] on this time of the age because that one
[41:45] is done done deal so don't let the devil
[41:48] come and play with your mind that oh
[41:50] this that that is all lies from him you
[41:53] have to be confident at this time that
[41:56] you are a son or a daughter of God
[41:59] because remember it's not your position
[42:02] it's your condition as a Son of God that
[42:05] is more important than anything else no
[42:07] wonder David said I would rather be a
[42:09] dmat In The House of the god of the
[42:12] Living God but to be in the congregation
[42:15] of the wicked so being a Son of God is
[42:19] the most vital thing here your position
[42:26] as a son or da daughter of God is very
[42:29] important that's why Pastor was telling
[42:32] last to your
[42:33] identity you have to identify yourself
[42:36] and know that I am what the word of God
[42:39] said I am and word god Hest his word
[42:43] more than his name he said let every
[42:45] man's word be a li but mine be the truth
[42:48] amen so if God's word is the truth then
[42:51] have to rest on his word he said that by
[42:54] his stripes I am healed amen what I said
[42:57] that you have to accept it you might be
[43:00] sick for Thousand Years whatever years
[43:03] but the word of God said by Stripes i
[43:05] healed I don't care how much I have
[43:07] pains in my back I don't care how much I
[43:10] have a headache how much I'm going
[43:12] through I'll still confess because Jesus
[43:14] Christ the high priest of our confession
[43:17] based on what you confess you get it he
[43:19] said on the right hand of God
[43:21] interceding for US based on our
[43:24] confession and I confess our whole from
[43:28] the top of my head to the to to the to
[43:30] my knee I'm whole every part of me I'm
[43:33] whole I'm Healed I'm blessed I'm a son
[43:36] of the Living God he lives in me your
[43:38] confession is more than important so
[43:41] once you confess the truth and you
[43:43] believe and you accept it it will come
[43:46] to pass because our God is an awesome
[43:49] God he keeps all his where he said where
[43:52] two or three are gathered in my name
[43:55] I'll be in your midst when two or three
[43:58] agreed concerning anything I will honor
[44:01] it so tonight we are more than two or
[44:03] three here if all of us come in
[44:05] agreement with one Accord whatever you
[44:08] need tonight you believe it in your
[44:10] heart you're going to receive it tonight
[44:12] before you leave here because our God
[44:14] our Serv is a living God he honors his
[44:16] word more than his name you have to
[44:19] accept it you have to accept your
[44:21] healing you have to accept your
[44:22] salvation you have to accept whatever
[44:25] you have and we all agreed in one
[44:28] nothing in the time of nimrod they made
[44:32] one agreement and they were going to go
[44:34] up to heaven and build that Tower and
[44:36] God confounded them but on day of
[44:38] Pentecost they were all in one Accord
[44:41] and the spirit of God came and what they
[44:44] did was God himself he divided himself
[44:47] into all of them because why they all
[44:49] were in one Accord so when you agreed on
[44:53] one thing and believe it it will come to
[44:56] pass
[44:57] the only thing that will hinder our
[44:59] prayer that will hinder things happen to
[45:02] us is
[45:04] fears that's why in Psalm 34 verse4
[45:10] David said I saw the Lord to deliver me
[45:14] from all my
[45:17] fears so if there is anything that you
[45:21] think you fear you have to S God for
[45:24] deliverance because David S God for
[45:27] deliverance amen so that those fears
[45:29] will not have effect in his life
[45:32] anything remember that job feared it
[45:34] came on him but the Bible said if thou
[45:37] can believe all things are possible to
[45:40] them that believe faith is a key to
[45:45] unlock God's blessing amen faith is a
[45:49] key to everything that you have need of
[45:52] am and faith is a revelation amen and
[45:55] God has given you the key
[45:58] to unlock your blessings so all I have
[46:00] to open that key to whatever you need
[46:03] and God will want give it to you just
[46:06] turn it like that by faith stand on the
[46:09] word of God revelation of the word of
[46:11] God it will bring every Divine promise
[46:14] to pass because he's the same yesterday
[46:18] today and forever our God is aome God
[46:22] hallelujah what am I trying to say Esau
[46:26] was small gentleman but just like so
[46:29] many people he despised the birth
[46:34] right he being the Elder
[46:36] son supposed to receive the blessing but
[46:40] he sold it for just what a partt of
[46:42] belly how many people in our time are
[46:47] selling their birth right just like Esau
[46:51] because of small amount of money that
[46:53] some people get to buy food and on the
[46:56] table they reject coming the house of
[46:59] God I'm not saying that I don't have to
[47:02] work the Bible said the hands that has
[47:05] no work should not eat but don't let
[47:08] your work become your God Amen there
[47:11] have to be a
[47:12] balance in everything that you are doing
[47:16] put God first and his kingdom first and
[47:19] all other things will be added onto it
[47:23] amen so many people they even
[47:27] don't trust God enough to pay their ties
[47:31] because they scared they don't have
[47:33] money to pay this bill to pay that bill
[47:35] to pay that bill but trust in God he
[47:39] said bring all SI and offering in my
[47:41] house and test me with if I will not
[47:44] open Windows of Heaven that blessing
[47:47] might not be necessary money sometimes
[47:49] you protect you on the road he give you
[47:51] a health he give you so many things that
[47:54] your eyes cannot even see Glory so let's
[47:57] trust
[47:58] God don't put your trust in your chos or
[48:02] your money or your Equity or it's all
[48:04] going to G away let's put it in Christ
[48:08] the Rich Young Ruler had an opportunity
[48:10] to sell everything and receive eternal
[48:14] life and more plus but he his eyes was
[48:18] just seeing his
[48:20] surroundings he didn't see far just like
[48:24] hazy he said oh
[48:27] Our Father father the serious Army are
[48:30] all camper arounders Elijah said oh God
[48:33] open the young my's eye to see
[48:36] Hallelujah because his eyes was just
[48:38] seeing only thing but Faith looks beyond
[48:40] what your eye can see amen it goes the
[48:44] six the six St it defies all the O of
[48:48] what your natural eyes can see when his
[48:51] eyes was open then he know that they
[48:54] that were with them is greater than they
[48:56] that was against them so if your eyes
[48:58] could open you will know that God he he
[49:02] controls everything Silver and Gold
[49:06] Everything is his Just Surrender
[49:08] yourself to himen and he will give you
[49:11] the desires of your heart he's a
[49:14] wonderful God Amen we love him with all
[49:17] our heart hallelujah our god is
[49:21] good he's the same yesterday today and
[49:25] forever amen and he keeps all his
[49:27] appointment he keeps all his word
[49:31] hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus
[49:34] another person I'm going to talk about
[49:37] is
[49:38] Judas and the and the thief on the cross
[49:43] you can see it all over in the
[49:45] scriptures
[49:47] Judas walked with the Lord he listened
[49:51] to every preaching that the Lord Jesus
[49:54] Christ preached within that 3 and a half
[49:56] years
[49:57] but it didn't do him no good the teeth
[50:02] on the cross was a
[50:04] thief stealing
[50:07] people their casts in modern times
[50:12] stealing their shoes their money doing
[50:14] all kind of wicked things but you see
[50:20] Judas
[50:22] rejected
[50:24] despised the word of God for his day MH
[50:29] he denied that he so that birth
[50:34] right and he repented but it was too
[50:38] late the same that Esau sought
[50:41] repentance with fears he didn't do him
[50:44] nothing so was
[50:47] Judas but that teeth on the cross when
[50:52] that word of God come on came to him M
[50:57] at the point of death he said Lord
[51:00] remember
[51:01] me and he said tonight you'll be with me
[51:06] Hallelujah in in what in
[51:08] Paradise that thief on the cross outside
[51:13] was M he looked so wicked outside that's
[51:17] what the devil covered him that night
[51:19] but he was a Son of God and Judas was a
[51:22] son of pedition and covered himself with
[51:25] religious spirit and look so great and
[51:27] Pious outside but when the time came
[51:30] they all went to their POS their what
[51:32] where they came from amen so it's not
[51:35] the outside work it's the seed of God
[51:38] inside you or inside you that makes the
[51:41] difference thank you that seed when he
[51:44] hear the word of God it will accept it
[51:48] no matter what that seed has done back
[51:51] to Jacob again he was a r i don't talk
[51:55] about this I talk much about Jacob he
[51:58] deceived this father-in-law he deceived
[52:00] he did all those things but when he met
[52:03] that angel of God he wrestled that angel
[52:07] and said unless you bless me I'm not
[52:10] going to let you
[52:12] go he restle with him until that angel
[52:15] blesses him so if you are backslider
[52:19] whoever you are if you know that you
[52:22] don't know that you not 100% sure that
[52:26] you have met God for yourself you don't
[52:28] have the Holy Ghost you got to cry and
[52:31] seek God until you are satisfied until
[52:35] you know God has come to you until you
[52:38] know something has happened oh man when
[52:41] met that woman who was so beautiful and
[52:44] that woman was insan institution she
[52:48] went she prayed a little bit she prayed
[52:51] she said a said you haven't done nothing
[52:54] when the woman prayed prayed it get to a
[52:56] place said now you saying
[52:58] something she became
[53:00] desperate and Sheed
[53:03] deliverance from that insane
[53:06] institution so without desperation
[53:09] sometime you cannot please God you got
[53:11] to be
[53:13] desperate like David said as the there
[53:17] thirsted for the water Brook so my soul
[53:19] thirst after thee for the Living God
[53:22] Amen you have be desperate and thir for
[53:25] God am and see because listen the only
[53:29] thing in this life that when you
[53:32] received you always want more and more
[53:36] and more is the Holy
[53:41] Ghost replenishing and replenishing you
[53:44] get one time the rest you replenish it
[53:47] you replenish it like that like that
[53:49] because listen everything in this life
[53:52] it doesn't satisfy to the fullest that's
[53:55] why the people they took the drugs they
[53:57] keep on taking High drugs this that that
[54:00] because they time from come from
[54:01] cigarette you go to COC you go to you
[54:03] take B it doesn't satisfy you want more
[54:06] you see what I mean you have to go to
[54:08] this that that women they can go but
[54:10] they change so many men doesn't satisfy
[54:12] them they get all the cars they get this
[54:15] they get everything but they know
[54:16] something is lacking but this Holy
[54:19] Ghost it satisfies you and that
[54:23] satisfaction doesn't become boring it
[54:26] doesn't become what do I see like I
[54:30] always give example if I don't have a
[54:33] watch and I get a nice um Swiss watch
[54:38] that is like maybe 10 15 whatever it is

[54:43] it so much you put this watch clean it
[54:47] like a new car all those new houses you
[54:49] clean everything now you so cherishing
[54:51] but after a while that Satisfaction Just
[54:55] erods but the word of God never erose
[54:57] every time you pick up this gospel this
[55:00] Bible something more revealed to you it
[55:02] becomes a new Bible we pick this you get
[55:04] this inspiration you get inspiration it
[55:06] goes on oh my I don't know how to
[55:09] express it but God is good brother D he
[55:11] has been so good to us oh man that you
[55:15] are son or daughter of God and he can
[55:18] come and whisper in your ears the things
[55:21] that you have need of and sometimes
[55:23] speak to you tells you do this do that
[55:25] do that don't underestimate your thought
[55:30] son or daughter of God is God thought
[55:33] that he pass it through you so when he
[55:35] tells you to do something
[55:38] anytime those little voices you miss it
[55:43] you become you realize that you didn't
[55:46] follow that voice you know you done some
[55:49] something oh if I had only followed my
[55:51] thought if I only follow my thought so
[55:54] don't let that thought pass by
[55:56] you Jesus Christ is passing by this day
[56:00] he he's passing this evening he's
[56:02] passing everywhere so don't let that
[56:04] thought don't miss that thought act on
[56:06] it so many of us like
[56:10] procrastination do today's work today
[56:12] don't put it tomorrow Tomorrow Will
[56:14] Never
[56:15] Come amen there's no satisfaction or
[56:18] there's no when you a dead person cannot
[56:21] praise God now that you are living this
[56:24] is the time you have to praise God
[56:27] this is the time we have to worship God
[56:29] this is the time we have to give him
[56:30] praise this is the time that we can wake
[56:33] up in the morning and see the sun shine
[56:36] you got to praise him you got to glorify
[56:38] him we have to exalt him some people
[56:41] cannot even open their
[56:43] mouth but once you have your health once
[56:47] you
[56:48] have
[56:51] everything Praise Him worship the Lord
[56:55] you don't Know What's happen tomorrow
[56:58] people in Ukraine on all those areas now
[57:02] the can't is passed there will be a time
[57:05] your book is
[57:07] closed but now that your book is
[57:10] open give praise to God give him the
[57:13] glory because we are wired to worship
[57:16] God that's why God created
[57:19] us for his glory and pleasure so that
[57:22] you were created to worship him what
[57:25] does the angels do they worship Him 24
[57:27] hours you got to worship
[57:30] God let nothing come between you and
[57:33] this Mighty
[57:34] God Search Your Heart search your mind
[57:38] search your soul if there's anything
[57:42] that is trying to come between you and
[57:43] God cut it off no wonder the scripture
[57:46] said that I rather go to heaven with
[57:48] blind one Blind Eye than to have my full
[57:52] eye and lose my eternal life I rather go
[57:55] there with one arm shop than to go there
[57:58] with all my full arms and and lose it so
[58:01] it's very
[58:03] vital that we give all our soul our mind
[58:10] everything to
[58:12] God because he created us amen you are
[58:16] created to worship Him
[58:19] hallelujah amen praise God so I'm going
[58:22] to read just one scripture to back that
[58:25] Judas and the thief on the cross in
[58:27] Ezekiel 18: 20-
[58:31] 24 he said that the soul that
[58:35] sinth
[58:36] it it shall
[58:39] die the sign shall not bear the iniquity
[58:42] of the
[58:43] father neither shall the father bear the
[58:45] iniquity of the son the righteousness of
[58:49] the righteous shall be upon him and the
[58:51] wickedness of the wickedness shall be
[58:54] upon him but if the wicked will turn
[58:59] from all his sins so it doesn't matter
[59:01] how that person had Liv in sins if he
[59:05] can tell from all his sins that he has
[59:08] committed and keep all my stles and do
[59:11] that which is lawful and right he shall
[59:13] surely what live he shall not what die
[59:19] all his transgression that he had
[59:21] committed they shall not be Mery unto
[59:23] him like you and me God forgive us and
[59:28] also you are Justified as if we not even
[59:32] do it in the first place all his
[59:34] transgress that he had committed they
[59:36] shall not be mentioned unto him in his
[59:39] righteous that he had done he shall
[59:44] live have I any pleasure at all that the
[59:48] wicked should die said the Lord God and
[59:52] not that he should return from his ways
[59:54] and leave but when the right turn away
[59:57] from his righteousness and commit
[59:59] iniquity and do it according to all the
[1:00:02] Abominations that his Wicked Man doe it
[1:00:05] shall he leave all his righteous that he
[1:00:08] had done shall not be mentioned in his
[1:00:10] trespass that he had trespassed in his
[1:00:12] sin that he had Sinn in them shall he
[1:00:14] die in other words
[1:00:18] if like example of that is
[1:00:22] Judas he had all that but he went and
[1:00:27] lost but you're not talking to a a
[1:00:30] situation where a brother or a sister
[1:00:33] has done something wrong or done
[1:00:35] mistakes because because we are in this
[1:00:38] flesh always going to make
[1:00:39] mistakes so God is start talking about
[1:00:42] that he's talking about those like
[1:00:45] judas's name was brought out from the
[1:00:46] land's book of life but because we are
[1:00:49] in this place you're going to make
[1:00:50] mistakes but as soon as a righteous
[1:00:52] falls seven times and what he rises up
[1:00:55] seven times amen you going to make
[1:00:57] mistake but God doesn't want you to stay
[1:00:59] in that in that your M rise up and try
[1:01:02] again amen don't stay in that M amen
[1:01:06] praise
[1:01:07] God God is
[1:01:09] good all the time this is not about your
[1:01:13] righteousness or my righte it's his
[1:01:16] righteousness is he living his life
[1:01:18] through you and me amen he's a wonderful
[1:01:22] God he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:25] for forever I'll talk about David and
[1:01:30] Uzziah both of them were
[1:01:33] Kings King Uzziah was brought up
[1:01:37] righteous he was taught by his parents
[1:01:40] to live good at the age of 14 or 16
[1:01:44] became a king he did everything that was
[1:01:47] right in the eyes of
[1:01:49] God but he went out of way out of order
[1:01:55] he being a king has no right to
[1:02:00] what turn on the incense in the office
[1:02:04] or to take the duties of the
[1:02:07] priest despite all that he done in his
[1:02:12] all these
[1:02:13] years when the priest confronted him and
[1:02:17] told him that King this is not your
[1:02:20] office instead of
[1:02:23] him um accepting that
[1:02:27] that even though he's a king when it
[1:02:30] comes to God's house the priest is
[1:02:33] higher than
[1:02:34] him the problem we have in this message
[1:02:37] some people because God has blessed them
[1:02:40] outside with financial blessing when
[1:02:42] they come to the house of God they want
[1:02:45] to be bosses in there with education um
[1:02:48] pH and everything they want to bring
[1:02:50] that in but when you are true son or
[1:02:53] daughter of God when you come come to
[1:02:56] the house of God the office of God you
[1:03:00] going to put all your education
[1:03:02] everything
[1:03:03] aside and come here as a humble man
[1:03:07] because it's the natural and spiritual
[1:03:09] thing so God bless Uzziah in the natural
[1:03:13] thing he wasn't supposed to take the
[1:03:16] position of the
[1:03:18] priest but when the priest told him you
[1:03:22] can't do that instead of repenting and
[1:03:27] accepting that
[1:03:28] correction that he refused the
[1:03:31] corruption the Bible said they were so
[1:03:34] angry and God WRA until God turn him
[1:03:39] into a
[1:03:40] leprosy but David was also a king a man
[1:03:45] after God's Own
[1:03:47] Heart David send his Soldier to go to
[1:03:51] war because he has so many wives he only
[1:03:55] saw The Soldier's wife instead of going
[1:03:57] for his wife he took the Soldier's wife
[1:03:59] slept with him send him to war bring him
[1:04:04] back to do something with the woman the
[1:04:06] soldier said no I have to go and what do
[1:04:08] my my my my master thing he didn't slpt
[1:04:13] the wife went back to war then he told
[1:04:16] them to put him the war front where he
[1:04:18] can
[1:04:21] die
[1:04:23] and yes he got killed so David could
[1:04:28] take that woman as his
[1:04:31] wife but you know the difference between
[1:04:33] David and
[1:04:35] Uzziah when David the king the the
[1:04:39] prophet Nathan went to him he said King
[1:04:43] somebody in your
[1:04:45] kingdom he
[1:04:46] has um 100 sheep or whatever it is and
[1:04:51] then he got a visitor instead of killing
[1:04:53] one of his sheep to
[1:04:56] serve the visitor he decided to go and
[1:04:59] take his neighbor's sheep and kill for
[1:05:03] that visitor David said my kingdom here
[1:05:06] he was Qui to judge he's going to die
[1:05:10] but the grace of God took over and the
[1:05:14] na said David you shall not die but
[1:05:17] sword will never live in your house but
[1:05:20] the difference is that when David
[1:05:22] recognized that he repented Psalm 5 1 he
[1:05:26] said Lord you only have I done this
[1:05:29] great sin against you only the have I
[1:05:32] done this and he cried and that s has
[1:05:36] become the greatest
[1:05:37] Psalm create in me a clean heart and
[1:05:40] renew the right Spirit Within Me restore
[1:05:43] unto me the joy of my salvation he cried
[1:05:47] onto God and repented so God want a
[1:05:50] repented heart no matter what far you
[1:05:53] have gone he looking to you and me to
[1:05:57] repent don't be arrogant like
[1:06:00] Uzziah who just what he was so WRA to
[1:06:05] take that
[1:06:06] correction that's why David was man God
[1:06:10] man after God's Own Heart he
[1:06:13] repented of his
[1:06:16] mistakes so if you happen to be the CEO
[1:06:22] or the big man whoever you are or you
[1:06:24] are the one with the pH the highest the
[1:06:28] society you've been accepted when you
[1:06:31] come the word of God you come to House
[1:06:33] of God be humble enough to accept
[1:06:38] correction don't let your position
[1:06:40] become a
[1:06:41] hindrance to your eternal life the Rich
[1:06:45] Young Ruler he was so Pious about the
[1:06:48] things that he
[1:06:49] wants he didn't want and lose that
[1:06:53] friendship but
[1:06:56] he lost
[1:06:58] eternally so what I'm encouraging you
[1:07:02] let's love God let's have repented heart
[1:07:06] don't just be
[1:07:08] arrogant when even a situation happens
[1:07:12] and the deacons has to deal with you or
[1:07:15] the pastor has to talk to you just
[1:07:17] accept
[1:07:18] Corrections don't try to be holy outou
[1:07:22] don't try to be I know everything as
[1:07:25] accept
[1:07:26] Corrections because sometime you might
[1:07:28] not even know that you are wrong but
[1:07:31] when that's pointed to you accept it in
[1:07:33] good
[1:07:35] faith don't try to be arrogant like what
[1:07:38] Uzziah did by David with all his
[1:07:42] mistakes with everything that he did if
[1:07:45] it was to B to be today I don't think
[1:07:47] any preacher will go to his his um his
[1:07:51] his puppet if was supposed to be nobody
[1:07:53] will go and preach for him again he will
[1:07:55] been done done done his name would have
[1:07:57] been black
[1:07:58] out but God looks into their heart and
[1:08:03] said David you are man after my own
[1:08:06] heart so God is looking to us to have
[1:08:09] that repented heart amen it's very very
[1:08:12] important no wonder braam said that he
[1:08:15] repent like thousand times a day because
[1:08:17] of thoughts that pass through his mind
[1:08:18] every let's make things right all that
[1:08:21] God is asking for is make things right
[1:08:24] don't hold things in your heart forgive
[1:08:27] and
[1:08:28] forget because the hard thing for people
[1:08:31] is to
[1:08:32] forgive human being is
[1:08:34] hard some people they forgive they say
[1:08:37] they forgive but they haven't
[1:08:40] forget
[1:08:42] and they don't want to even see the
[1:08:44] people's face no if you really forgive
[1:08:47] you forgive and make it
[1:08:49] right just forgive love the
[1:08:52] people you see the Bible said love those
[1:08:55] if it's easy for me to love Cofe love
[1:09:00] people are very close to you but the
[1:09:03] true love of God project love to those
[1:09:05] who hate you you know they really
[1:09:08] despise you you know they they don't
[1:09:12] like you but in your heart you have to
[1:09:14] pray for them because they don't know
[1:09:17] what they are doing said sometimes God
[1:09:20] is even trying your faith trying to look
[1:09:22] at your reaction because the god that we
[1:09:25] serve
[1:09:26] he let his rain fall on the just on the
[1:09:28] unjust he doesn't discriminate the only
[1:09:31] thing is going to judge them for not
[1:09:33] obeying his word but you being obedient
[1:09:37] to his word he going to bless you
[1:09:41] because you have recognized that the
[1:09:44] rain that is falling on you you re you
[1:09:49] accept it you know it's him doing it and
[1:09:51] you give him the glory back but they
[1:09:54] receive God re they receive God blessing
[1:09:57] they still go and Cur his name and every
[1:09:59] little thing they blame the they blaming
[1:10:02] God instead of blaming the devil who is
[1:10:04] causing all that they are blaming god
[1:10:08] so let's have a repented heart and let's
[1:10:12] forgive because the Bible said that even
[1:10:14] if you not forgive do not go and even
[1:10:16] pray
[1:10:18] hallelujah amen our God is good all the
[1:10:21] all the time God is good Hallelujah
[1:10:25] praise
[1:10:27] God and one one more thing I think I'm
[1:10:31] going to try to wrap up very
[1:10:34] soon one more thing was
[1:10:38] Abraham God did not chose Abraham based
[1:10:41] on what Abraham has done the Covenant
[1:10:43] between Abraham was God done it Abraham
[1:10:48] not you do this I do that not you do
[1:10:51] this I do that but said that I chose you
[1:10:55] I have done this I have done that
[1:10:56] unconditional love that's what a Seed of
[1:11:00] Abraham we have
[1:11:02] received but when
[1:11:05] Abraham went to Egypt because remember
[1:11:09] any time the children of Israel they
[1:11:12] left Palestine they got in
[1:11:16] trouble
[1:11:17] Naomi and the husband they left Israel
[1:11:21] they got in
[1:11:23] trouble Abraham left there
[1:11:26] for
[1:11:27] food so many people do do that all the
[1:11:30] time when the economy gets so hard a
[1:11:32] little bit they want to move here left
[1:11:34] right everywhere to just find
[1:11:37] food Abraham went to find food and he
[1:11:41] got in trouble he realized that King is
[1:11:44] the wicked King he's going to take his
[1:11:45] wife so he lied to the king that it's my
[1:11:48] sister and braam said that he
[1:11:51] repented and because he repented God
[1:11:54] heard his voice
[1:11:56] and he's and God will also not permit
[1:11:59] that King to do that because he going to
[1:12:01] mess up that race that Isaac was
[1:12:04] supposed to come through Sarah so even
[1:12:06] though he lied he did that God also
[1:12:10] stood by said that let him go and pray
[1:12:12] for you if he does not pray for you all
[1:12:14] you and your I'm going to destroy you he
[1:12:17] he did that thing he said oh Lord didn't
[1:12:20] he told me that he was is his is his
[1:12:23] sister didn't he say that he was my he
[1:12:26] was my brother he said I know that I
[1:12:28] know the Integrity of your heart that's
[1:12:30] why I told you to restore that man's
[1:12:32] wife to him he Resto him and give him
[1:12:35] more
[1:12:36] money that's the grace of God Sam said
[1:12:39] said that his Prophet need some money so
[1:12:42] he had permit all those things to happen
[1:12:44] he got all those money from the from the
[1:12:46] King it was so much that when later he
[1:12:48] went the wall he told them I don't need
[1:12:51] nothing from you I'm rich enough I don't
[1:12:53] need nothing from you so he a grace of
[1:12:55] God a repented heart Abraham repented
[1:13:00] that's what God is looking at it's not
[1:13:02] your works of righteousness amen
[1:13:05] hallelujah I think I'm going to I read
[1:13:09] one more thing here and then I'm going
[1:13:13] to try to
[1:13:15] close Okay so it was a repent Abraham
[1:13:19] repented and goded that Hallelujah
[1:13:24] that's fine
[1:13:27] and all that I'm trying to say is that
[1:13:31] God is looking to us for a repented
[1:13:33] heart there are so many scriptures the
[1:13:36] prodigal son he went he recognized
[1:13:41] that where he was what he has done was
[1:13:44] strong he repented and came back and his
[1:13:48] father red accepted him the prodal and
[1:13:51] whil he was even out there he was still
[1:13:54] a son
[1:13:55] MH it doesn't change the sunship so it's
[1:13:59] you and me it doesn't matter how much
[1:14:01] you make make mistake or things will
[1:14:03] fall you are still a son amen recognize
[1:14:08] and accept you are still a son or
[1:14:10] daughter of God God is not looking at
[1:14:13] your condition he's looking at your
[1:14:16] position yes sir the position is the
[1:14:18] most important thing recognize who you
[1:14:22] are that you are son or daughter of the
[1:14:25] Living God hallelujah that's the most
[1:14:28] important the woman at the
[1:14:31] world she had lived and messed up her
[1:14:35] life with five different
[1:14:37] men it doesn't matter
[1:14:40] how her life was
[1:14:42] rotten when that word of God came in
[1:14:45] front of him and her heart was
[1:14:49] revealed and all that she has there in
[1:14:52] the secret was revealed to him to her
[1:14:55] sorry she said oh thou the Mah she went
[1:14:59] back and
[1:15:01] witnessed so is you and me God has been
[1:15:04] so good to us so what God has done to us
[1:15:08] let's tell people about it the Bible
[1:15:10] said that because of a
[1:15:12] testimony people came and hear about the
[1:15:15] Lord Jesus Christ even though her life
[1:15:18] was mess as mess could
[1:15:21] be but when she met the word of the hour
[1:15:24] for her day
[1:15:25] she receive it the one who was caught in
[1:15:29] the very
[1:15:30] act she was caught merly in the very
[1:15:35] act those people by law supposed to
[1:15:38] Stone
[1:15:39] her those who are going to Stone her
[1:15:43] they have kept the LA from their
[1:15:46] youth but they didn't qualify to Stone
[1:15:49] ha that's why he began to write on the
[1:15:53] floor and then they recognized that they
[1:15:56] do not qualify to Stone her he as he
[1:16:00] asked her where are your
[1:16:02] accusers by law they have obeyed the
[1:16:06] law but that doesn't give them the right
[1:16:10] to Stone that
[1:16:11] woman outside they look
[1:16:14] clean but that woman look Mery on the
[1:16:18] outside being a daughter of God her life
[1:16:21] was messed up caught up in the very act
[1:16:24] but all that God was requiring when the
[1:16:27] word for her day was presented to
