[14:13] to the promise we have in you our eyes
[14:17] just
[14:17] have been caught away from the things of
[14:20] this world and away from the men of this
[14:22] world and the powers and principalities
[14:24] and everything of this world and
[14:26] have been attracted to the true and the
[14:29] living god

[49:24] christmas star set to light
[49:28] up the night on december 21st
[49:36] with this year's winter solstice comes
[49:39] more than
[49:40] just confirmation of our our
[49:44] already cold weather and fleeting
[49:47] daylight
[49:49] a rare christmas star to appear
[49:53] in the skies
[49:56] a great conjunction of stars
[50:00] is happening on december 21st
[50:05] 2020 it is the meeting
[50:09] of the planets jupiter
[50:12] and saturn
[50:15] then rare celestial event
[50:22] christmas star will the star
[50:25] of bethlehem appear
[50:29] on december 21st i'm just reading just
[50:33] the headlines and some of these things
[50:37] christmas star what does the bible say
[50:42] about december 21st the great
[50:46] conjunction that's about to take place
[50:51] now brothers and sisters oh
[50:54] um lots of people have christmas trees
[50:57] how many know what a christmas tree is
[51:00] how many of you know oh you know what a
[51:02] christmas tree is
[51:03] okay uh praise the lord uh
[51:07] and people decorate the christmas tree
[51:11] and put all kinds of things on the
[51:14] christmas trees
[51:15] and uh most of the time
[51:19] on the top of the tree they'll have
[51:23] a star and the star
[51:27] sits on the top of the tree
[51:30] now i'm quoting from holiday history
[51:34] which says decorating a christmas tree
[51:38] ahead of the holidays
[51:40] is a family tradition in many households
[51:44] memories come to life while unpacking
[51:48] ornaments streaming lights
[51:51] hanging tinsel on the tree
[51:55] young children vying for the honor
[51:58] to be trust lifted into the
[52:01] air and to nestle an ornament
[52:05] onto the top of the tree
[52:09] and that will either be a star
[52:13] or an angel which is the most common
[52:18] top for a christmas tree
[52:21] but originally the
[52:24] infant jesus is the one
[52:28] who adorned the top of christmas trees
[52:32] however however this trend later evolved
[52:36] instead of a baby on the top of the tree
[52:40] into a star which
[52:44] are both significant christian symbols
[52:48] in the nativity of jesus
[52:51] of course the star of bethlehem
[52:55] is also referred to as the
[52:58] christmas star that
[53:01] guided the wise men are the magic
[53:05] to the birthplace of christ
[53:09] in classic christian story of
[53:12] jesus of nazareth's birth
[53:16] see praise god i'll stop there
[53:19] as far as that is concerned hallelujah
[53:23] i just wanted to make sure that i laid
[53:26] that foundation
[53:27] that you're aware now what actually
[53:29] happened
[53:30] is that the lord gave me this thought of
[53:34] the
[53:34] of the significance of the christmas
[53:36] star
[53:38] and i had already written a few
[53:41] notes by hand on uh some papers
[53:45] actually praise the lord i still have
[53:48] the
[53:48] original year of all my scribbles and
[53:51] scrolls
[53:52] and um while thinking on these things
[53:56] you know i had to talk to
[53:59] brother eastman in new york
[54:03] and while talking with him from one
[54:06] thing to the other he said oh
[54:08] he said did you hear of this astonishing
[54:11] event that's taken place
[54:13] uh you should look at it on december
[54:17] 21st
[54:18] they were supposed to be the christmas
[54:21] stars appearing
[54:22] after over 800 years
[54:26] it's suddenly coming again
[54:30] and appearing in the skies i said what
[54:34] i said what did you say he said the
[54:36] christmas star
[54:38] is appearing i said oh my god
[54:42] i i'm already preparing uh a talk or a
[54:45] sermon
[54:46] on the christmas star he said what
[54:50] you sure you didn't read it in the
[54:52] newspapers or hear it in the news or
[54:55] somebody told you before i said no
[54:58] i said not at all it just struck me
[55:02] to focus on this so
[55:05] uh i said that the fact that you're
[55:07] telling me now just confirms to me
[55:10] that's what i'm supposed to speak about
[55:13] amen
[55:13] praise the lord hallelujah so i
[55:16] thank god for it and thank god for him
[55:20] and for the thought that was there
[55:23] expressed praise the lord hallelujah
[55:27] now of course we realize here
[55:30] that i want to talk about the
[55:32] significance
[55:33] of this christmas star
[55:37] the significance of it appearing
[55:40] at this time in the skies
[55:44] this is something that even
[55:48] the nominal christian world
[55:51] recognizes that it's a mystic star
[55:55] something is fixing to happen
[55:58] they don't understand what the
[56:00] significance of
[56:02] it is but here it is after
[56:05] 800 years suddenly putting in
[56:09] an appearance my god
[56:12] back in the bible matthew 2 1
[56:16] 2 our text we have heard
[56:19] it preached we have read it over time
[56:23] about the wise man following
[56:27] the star from the east coming towards
[56:30] the west
[56:32] and uh as they looked at the star
[56:36] they were in the east so the star
[56:39] had to be in the west and so they were
[56:42] going west
[56:44] towards this star and they looked follow
[56:47] the star
[56:48] in the sky but praise god
[56:53] i'm placing it into your heart and mind
[56:57] just a little droplet don't you
[57:01] said the thought uh look at the star
[57:04] in the sky that the wise men looked at
[57:07] back there
[57:08] that's not the star you are to look at
[57:11] now
[57:12] they looked at the one in the sky but
[57:14] you keep your eyes
[57:16] on the one in the tree praise god
[57:20] so i thank god that our star
[57:23] was on the top of golgotha's hill
[57:27] hanging on the top of our christmas tree
[57:30] and we give him praise and we give him
[57:33] thanks and we give him glory
[57:35] because he came down and gave his life
[57:37] for us
[57:40] and that's why he is the star of our
[57:43] lives
[57:44] that's why we said king of my life i
[57:47] crown thee now thine shall the glory be
[57:51] oh hallelujah because he is the star
[57:55] and the hope of our lives oh glory to
[57:59] god
[57:59] amen hallelujah my god we give him glory
[58:04] amen now before jesus was even born
[58:10] out of balaam's mouth came the prophecy
[58:14] that all jacob will rise a star
[58:18] amen a star would arise
[58:21] praise the lord and we thank god
[58:24] that this great star of numbers 2417
[58:29] has arisen out of jacob
[58:32] now that was the very start
[58:36] and scripture that caused the wise men
[58:39] to recognize
[58:40] what was happening for when they saw
[58:44] that star
[58:44] appeared being wise men
[58:48] they had revelation
[58:51] which is what made them wise to
[58:54] recognize
[58:55] the significance of what was taking
[58:58] place
[59:00] and as i was looking online at some of
[59:04] this
[59:05] one of the astronomers was showing
[59:09] that way back then when the first star
[59:13] appeared
[59:14] it appeared in whatever constellation
[59:17] but then he showed
[59:18] it was under the sign of leo
[59:22] and virgo leo mainly
[59:26] and there it was shaped in the form
[59:30] of a lion and he said
[59:33] you know so when i saw that i realized
[59:35] oh
[59:36] so when the wise men looked they
[59:40] realized a king a newborn king
[59:44] out of the land of the tribe of judah
[59:48] is a right about to come up on the earth
[59:51] hallelujah
[59:52] glory to god amen i thank god
[59:56] that our star has appeared
[59:59] amen and our star which is
[1:00:03] a reflection of the great star god
[1:00:06] sent us a church age messenger
[1:00:11] and we by looking at that messenger
[1:00:14] recognize that the newborn word
[1:00:19] or the birth of the word was to take
[1:00:22] place
[1:00:23] which we know it has taken place oh
[1:00:28] praise god
[1:00:29] the seals are open all the swaddling
[1:00:33] clothes have been taken
[1:00:35] and here is the newborn world
[1:00:38] exposed and revealing itself
[1:00:41] that we are able to hold on to it praise
[1:00:44] god
[1:00:45] and bring all of our gifts
[1:00:48] and potentials that are in our lives
[1:00:52] and we give him all our talents we give
[1:00:55] him all our gifts
[1:00:57] we lay ourselves at his feet and we pray
[1:01:00] that he will
[1:01:01] take us and use us for his glory and
[1:01:04] honor
[1:01:06] amen that is the reason why i'm here to
[1:01:10] have a real christmas
[1:01:12] which is the worship of christ and the
[1:01:15] way to worship him
[1:01:17] is first you must recognize who he is
[1:01:21] or else you worship but you know not who
[1:01:24] you're washing
[1:01:25] but with the revelation you know who you
[1:01:28] worship
[1:01:29] not just using the word jesus or christ
[1:01:33] but recognizing who he is
[1:01:36] amen and laying your life
[1:01:39] at his feet amen praise god hallelujah
[1:01:43] so before he was born
[1:01:46] he was signified
[1:01:49] by a star hallelujah
[1:01:53] revelation 22 16 calls him
[1:01:57] the bright and the morning star
[1:02:00] glory be to god hallelujah jeremiah 31
[1:02:04] 35 he says
[1:02:06] and he the almighty giveth the stars
[1:02:10] to give us light praise god
[1:02:13] so the stars are here to give us light
[1:02:17] what about that bright and morning star
[1:02:20] it's to bring warning in your heart
[1:02:22] brother sister
[1:02:24] it's to drive away the gloom it's the
[1:02:27] hill
[1:02:28] the coming of the sun it's the hill
[1:02:31] the rising of the sun i thank god
[1:02:35] that the day star of peter has shined
[1:02:38] into our hearts
[1:02:40] and caused us to be able to see the
[1:02:42] light of this hour
[1:02:44] that we might walk truly with him
[1:02:47] for the glory of god amen hallelujah
[1:02:50] oh my when you look what do you see
[1:02:55] do you see what i see oh
[1:02:58] star a star oh hallelujah
[1:03:01] i see a star and the star i see
[1:03:05] is christ amen christ revealing his own
[1:03:09] word
[1:03:10] christ reveals his own prophet christ
[1:03:13] revealing his own people oh blessed be
[1:03:16] the name of the lord
[1:03:18] that's the reason why i'm here this
[1:03:20] morning beside myself
[1:03:22] because we are in the prophecy we are
[1:03:25] part of the prophecy
[1:03:27] and we are walking in the light of this
[1:03:29] hour glory of god hallelujah
[1:03:31] amen amen praise god
[1:03:35] long before us god sent a messenger
[1:03:40] and after that messenger there's a lot
[1:03:42] of lesser lights
[1:03:44] amen you know what i'm talking about i'm
[1:03:47] paying honor to
[1:03:48] all those men and ministers that came
[1:03:52] at the time of brother branham after the
[1:03:55] prophet
[1:03:56] and god used them in partial ways
[1:03:59] each one of them bringing out a part of
[1:04:01] the truth this one preached and he
[1:04:03] emphasized thunders the next one
[1:04:05] preached
[1:04:05] and he emphasized two soul the next one
[1:04:08] preached and he emphasized
[1:04:10] holiness or healing or something else
[1:04:12] but
[1:04:13] god use them for a purpose
[1:04:16] the real bride comes now looks at the
[1:04:18] whole thing
[1:04:19] and she sees the entire picture amen
[1:04:23] she doesn't just see a part of it but
[1:04:25] she sees the entire picture
[1:04:27] and gives glory and praise to god i
[1:04:30] thank god
[1:04:31] for men like brother coleman i thank god
[1:04:34] for men that brother vale i thank god
[1:04:37] hallelujah
[1:04:38] for every one of them i don't want to
[1:04:40] name all of them padarus and this one
[1:04:43] and that one and the other one
[1:04:44] there were so many of them that god was
[1:04:47] using
[1:04:48] in startling and marvelous wonderful
[1:04:51] ways
[1:04:51] but there were use of god to bring out a
[1:04:54] part of that truth
[1:04:56] so that when we look now we can take all
[1:04:59] of it
[1:04:59] and the thing fits together like a hand
[1:05:02] in the glove glory of god
[1:05:04] hallelujah and we give him praise and
[1:05:06] honor
[1:05:07] and glory for what he has given to us
[1:05:10] amen hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:05:14] now hallelujah
[1:05:19] when you see a star
[1:05:22] uh you know
[1:05:26] what it takes to be a star
[1:05:30] i'm not talking about the star in the
[1:05:32] sky she they're following the movie star
[1:05:34] but we are following the mystic
[1:05:36] star we are following the morning star
[1:05:38] while they're following the movie stars
[1:05:41] you know what it takes to be a star then
[1:05:45] you become famous you get credibility
[1:05:48] and
[1:05:48] people begin to follow you
[1:05:51] people begin to amp you or copy what you
[1:05:55] wear and how you dress or uh how you
[1:05:58] act and stuff like that what i'm saying
[1:06:02] is that the people of the world take
[1:06:04] politicians
[1:06:05] movie stars business leaders successful
[1:06:09] people
[1:06:10] and they make them into their stars
[1:06:14] and put them at the top of their tree
[1:06:17] but the
[1:06:18] top of our tree has one star
[1:06:21] and that star is jesus christ our lord
[1:06:24] hallelujah
[1:06:25] we want to be like him
[1:06:29] we want to walk like him move like him
[1:06:32] move in his spirit and be a part of his
[1:06:35] great economy
[1:06:37] we look around and you see all these
[1:06:39] young men young women
[1:06:40] they paint up and and they wear all
[1:06:43] kinds of shorts
[1:06:44] pants all kinds of various things that
[1:06:48] are contrary to the word of god
[1:06:50] and they are going after these
[1:06:54] stars of the world but we are looking
[1:06:57] our
[1:06:58] eyes on the bright and morning star who
[1:07:00] is jesus christ amen
[1:07:03] and we are following him and walking in
[1:07:06] the light
[1:07:07] of the world amen hallelujah thank god
[1:07:10] forevermore
[1:07:11] i give him glory and i give him praise
[1:07:15] praise god aren't you aren't you happy
[1:07:17] that he is our star
[1:07:20] he is the king of our lives and we want
[1:07:23] to crown him now
[1:07:25] as the song said thine shall the glory
[1:07:28] be
[1:07:28] hallelujah lest i forget gethsemane and
[1:07:32] calvary
[1:07:33] oh god may crown you back up
[1:07:36] divine submission and humility to the
[1:07:39] will
[1:07:40] and plan of god hallelujah
[1:07:43] yes sir so he was the great star
[1:07:48] that spoke to moses in the burning bush
[1:07:53] he was the pillar of fire
[1:07:56] amen he was the time
[1:08:00] he shined in that time of darkness
[1:08:04] lord of god hallelujah i believe
[1:08:08] as the prophetess said that he was the
[1:08:12] star
[1:08:13] that struck paul from off of his
[1:08:16] intellectual
[1:08:17] horse of higher learning
[1:08:20] and struck him to bite the dust my
[1:08:23] friends of humility
[1:08:25] and to cast off that and to put his
[1:08:29] faith in jesus christ and into
[1:08:33] present truth not dead truths
[1:08:36] buried in the libraries of the world
[1:08:39] but living present tense truth god
[1:08:43] revealing himself moment by moment
[1:08:46] making himself known and revealing
[1:08:48] himself to the true child of god
[1:08:51] hallelujah paul looking upon the
[1:08:56] person of the resurrected christ
[1:09:00] was struck by the brilliance from the
[1:09:02] effulgence
[1:09:04] of the light of god that was coming from
[1:09:07] the divine personage
[1:09:09] of jesus christ and you know a jew never
[1:09:12] says lord
[1:09:13] if you say lord you're saying god and he
[1:09:16] said
[1:09:16] lord who art thou lord and that god
[1:09:20] in that light answered i am jesus
[1:09:25] hallelujah whom thou persecuted us amen
[1:09:28] for he was in his people where he always
[1:09:32] is in the true believer so that when
[1:09:34] you're persecuting them
[1:09:36] you're rarely persecuting him and paul
[1:09:39] recognized that the star that struck him
[1:09:43] off of his horse
[1:09:44] was jesus christ the great pillar of
[1:09:47] fire
[1:09:48] came and struck him off of his

[1:10:42] he comes in the form of a star
[1:10:46] right i've seen him many times
[1:10:50] but then when it became visible

[1:11:15] the corner
[1:11:16] and the light reflecting in the room
[1:11:20] but this light got brighter
[1:11:24] and brighter i looked at the door there
[1:11:27] was no
[1:11:28] automobile and when i looked
[1:11:31] the light got greater and just above me
[1:11:34] when i looked there hung a
[1:11:38] great star and the light from the star
[1:11:42] was a a greenish yellowish green
[1:11:46] shining on the floor and
[1:11:49] out of that light of that star
[1:11:52] come walking through that light a
[1:11:55] man that looked like as i said before
[1:12:00] would weigh about 200 pounds
[1:12:03] he was a huge man whoa
[1:12:06] oh my he was more of an
[1:12:09] olive complexion he had dark eyes
[1:12:14] and was close to me as this

[1:13:04] their diseases and you will if you'll be
[1:13:07] reverent before long

[1:13:47] healer but i'm not a divine healer
[1:13:50] you see the preaching divine healing
[1:13:53] doesn't make me a divine healer
[1:13:55] more than preaching salvation will make
[1:13:57] a man a divine savior

[1:14:02] about that time while i was speaking
[1:14:06] the glory and power of god came
[1:14:09] down and there happened to be a

[1:14:14] standing there to shoot a picture
[1:14:19] and when he looked he almost had a
[1:14:23] heart attack it come in so many meetings
[1:14:28] a great world of fire moving
[1:14:33] oh my and that took the picture
[1:14:37] see here not long ago
[1:14:42] i was at the foot of spring feast spring
[1:14:45] street
[1:14:46] in jeffersonville in the month of august
[1:14:50] and there that world of fire come out of
[1:14:53] the skies
[1:14:54] visible to about 10 000 people
[1:14:58] on the banks moved to where i was
[1:15:01] the voice the voice screaming out of it
[1:15:05] oh hundreds fainted on the banks of the
[1:15:09] river
[1:15:10] and all the newspapers carried it mystic
[1:15:13] star
[1:15:14] appears over minister
[1:15:17] while baptizing oh my
[1:15:21] you see and while i was speaking of that
[1:15:25] one night here in the building
[1:15:27] i started praying for that little boy
[1:15:31] the mother and father brought
[1:15:34] he was crippled his feet were drawn up
[1:15:37] like
[1:15:38] with polio i was holding the little
[1:15:41] fellow
[1:15:42] in my arms and i was praying
[1:15:45] and while i was praying that
[1:15:48] light suddenly appeared
[1:15:51] and got real bright in my face
[1:15:55] with my eyes closed i thought the
[1:15:57] custodian
[1:15:58] had turned on the light oh my but i
[1:16:02] kept praying and it got brighter and
[1:16:05] brighter
[1:16:06] and brighter when i raise my head
[1:16:09] down come through the room that bright
[1:16:13] and morning star
[1:16:15] right up where i was holding the baby
[1:16:18] see i don't know what happened
[1:16:21] whether i dropped it or what happened
[1:16:24] but when i
[1:16:25] looked it hit the floor and the feet
[1:16:28] crooked feet straightened out
[1:16:30] oh my the mother sitting in the front
[1:16:33] raised her head
[1:16:34] and began screaming until she fainted
[1:16:38] and fell on the floor and the little boy
[1:16:40] started
[1:16:41] running around the platform hollering
[1:16:44] for his mother
[1:16:46] there in the corner was a nazarene girl
[1:16:51] pretty attractive young woman
[1:16:54] setting playing the piano when she
[1:16:57] looked and seen that star
[1:17:00] she threw up her hands got real white
[1:17:03] for she knew that she was intimate
[1:17:07] friends of that couple whose child
[1:17:10] was crippled and seeing what happened
[1:17:15] and seeing the star she
[1:17:18] ran away from that piano
[1:17:22] for she was playing to him the great
[1:17:25] physician
[1:17:27] now with snail you've heard it
[1:17:30] and there as soon as she ran away
[1:17:34] right before 5 000 people
[1:17:38] them ivory keys continued playing
[1:17:43] the great physician now
[1:17:46] is near the sympathizing jesus
[1:17:53] he speaks the true pink heart
[1:17:57] to chair no other name but
[1:18:02] he thought my friends
[1:18:06] it played not just one word one
[1:18:10] sentence but though it played the
[1:18:14] entire him through
[1:18:17] hundreds began screaming and pouring to
[1:18:21] the altar
[1:18:22] screaming at where with their
[1:18:24] handkerchiefs crying
[1:18:25] god have mercy on me a sinner
[1:18:28] i pray someone today hearing this
[1:18:32] will cry out in their home in their room
[1:18:35] in their heart oh god have mercy on me a
[1:18:39] sinner amen
[1:18:40] forgive me cleanse me of my sin and
[1:18:43] receive me into your kingdom
[1:18:45] as a child of god mr lacey looked
[1:18:50] and said well there's been a lot of
[1:18:53] hypocrites
[1:18:54] they've painted them saints and even the
[1:18:57] savior
[1:18:58] with lights around them but that was
[1:19:01] nothing but artists work but this
[1:19:05] this is not psychology this is not
[1:19:09] something else
[1:19:11] the optical light struck the the optical
[1:19:14] lens of this camera and psychology won't
[1:19:18] do that
[1:19:19] oh my praise god hallelujah
[1:19:22] it's real friends i said it's real
[1:19:27] and i know it's real because when the
[1:19:30] message
[1:19:31] came to me wild yet a boy young man
[1:19:35] in the nation of guyana
[1:19:38] just kicked out of the pentecostal
[1:19:42] denomination
[1:19:43] just started the first church in the
[1:19:46] message in that nation
[1:19:49] storms bricks bottles everything and
[1:19:52] thrown on top
[1:19:53] calls all kinds of names
[1:19:56] and after the service standing there
[1:19:59] with the four or five brothers
[1:20:02] on a bridge the site of a bridge talking
[1:20:06] and there was a bush behind them out of
[1:20:09] that bush came a ball of light about
[1:20:13] this size
[1:20:15] and it was not moving fast it was just
[1:20:17] moving slowly
[1:20:19] i didn't know whether because i read
[1:20:22] about brother branham i'm
[1:20:24] you know just imagining things or so
[1:20:27] so i said the brothers do you see
[1:20:29] anything
[1:20:30] so they turned around for their password
[1:20:33] to it and then they
[1:20:34] oh my god and they backed away there
[1:20:37] was this light rising up going slowly
[1:20:41] well i said well i still thought well we
[1:20:44] all
[1:20:45] follow the message of brother branham
[1:20:46] maybe maybe we're just
[1:20:49] imagining because we read so about him
[1:20:52] so i ran to my aunt's house which was
[1:20:55] like where this house is
[1:20:56] but across it was across a canal and so
[1:21:00] i ran over there
[1:21:01] and bang bang it was about midnight they
[1:21:03] were sleeping
[1:21:04] bang bang bang on the door so they came
[1:21:07] out said what's the matter boy what's
[1:21:08] going on
[1:21:09] i said do you see anything and they said
[1:21:14] oh my god what is that and there was the
[1:21:17] light
[1:21:18] moving so what is that what is it
[1:21:21] i i've never seen anything like and just
[1:21:24] about that time it went like this
[1:21:27] and took off like a rocket faster than
[1:21:30] light
[1:21:30] right up into the skies and disappeared
[1:21:33] oh my friends
[1:21:35] i don't know if that is what brother
[1:21:38] branham saw
[1:21:39] i don't know if that's the original
[1:21:41] pillar of fire but if it is
[1:21:43] then i was allowed to see it
[1:21:46] i was allowed to see it an experience
[1:21:49] that is
[1:21:50] real it's not a joke of course that
[1:21:52] caused me to believe the message even
[1:21:54] more
[1:21:54] because this is not somebody telling me
[1:21:57] i'm seeing it
[1:21:58] amen with my natural eyes and it takes
[1:22:00] spirituality to see that it was right
[1:22:02] there
[1:22:03] the sinners my were there they saw it
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:06] and they recognized what it was my
[1:22:09] brothers and sister
[1:22:10] let me tell you the christmas star amen
[1:22:14] oh my was a reflection of the bright and
[1:22:17] morning star
[1:22:18] a reflection the christ our lord is born
[1:22:21] today
[1:22:22] he is born on the earth praise god i'm
[1:22:25] glad that i can say that
[1:22:27] he is born as the savior in the manger
[1:22:30] of my heart
[1:22:31] he lives in me praise god he walks in me
[1:22:35] amen
[1:22:35] and i give god pray praise and honor and
[1:22:39] glory
[1:22:39] for that amen hallelujah oh
[1:22:43] praise god hallelujah amen
[1:22:46] yes sir think about it oh my he says
[1:22:50] friends settle yourself down
[1:22:54] now the r has come upon us
[1:22:57] there's been a lot of playing religion
[1:22:59] and playing church
[1:23:01] but god is now calling out his people
[1:23:04] for his name amen
[1:23:06] oh my and he is vindicating it by
[1:23:10] signs and wonders now
[1:23:13] when i just came to the ministry he's
[1:23:15] speaking again
[1:23:18] an astronomer astrologer came to me
[1:23:21] speaking about cycles and and that this
[1:23:25] great star amen that came
[1:23:28] of the star that came back in the days
[1:23:30] of christ
[1:23:32] and how they represented shem ham and
[1:23:35] jeffers
[1:23:35] the sons of noah and so on like that
[1:23:39] these different stars yes see for you
[1:23:42] must recognize
[1:23:45] that those three wise men
[1:23:48] were following in actual fact three
[1:23:51] different stars in another place he said
[1:23:56] of course it was
[1:23:56] venus jupiter and saturn uh venus
[1:24:00] mars i think and saturn right together
[1:24:03] they were following different stars but
[1:24:06] when
[1:24:07] you see them stars
[1:24:10] moved in the heavens and came together
[1:24:13] as
[1:24:14] one on the earth the three
[1:24:18] who did not know each other moved on the
[1:24:21] earth
[1:24:23] and met each other at the bethlehem
[1:24:27] gate oh my following three different
[1:24:31] star
[1:24:32] but then they formed into one morning
[1:24:35] star
[1:24:36] that hung over christ oh my
[1:24:39] think of it and when they're separated
[1:24:43] they never went back to their orbits and
[1:24:45] never have since then
[1:24:47] oh my it was supernaturally
[1:24:50] given and so she said
[1:24:55] your gift your star
[1:24:58] was sent in commemoration of the
[1:25:02] greatest
[1:25:03] gift that god ever gave to the earth
[1:25:06] he sends back sometimes something
[1:25:10] in cycles something lesser
[1:25:14] but in commemoration of what he did the
[1:25:17] first time amen
[1:25:20] and i believe the significance of this
[1:25:23] christmas star that you can see in the
[1:25:26] sky
[1:25:26] anytime after 5 5 30 tomorrow
[1:25:30] night it'll be there for all to see
[1:25:33] amen but this time it's not
[1:25:36] three stars it's only two stars
[1:25:41] oh jupiter and saturn
[1:25:44] and there's going to be a conjunction
[1:25:48] which is another word for a mystic
[1:25:51] union gonna come together
[1:25:56] symbolizing christ and his church
[1:25:59] becoming one oh
[1:26:03] the first birth was the headship being
[1:26:07] born
[1:26:08] but now it's the son of man
[1:26:12] being revealed again in the bridefall
[1:26:17] and then the capstone or head
[1:26:20] comes down on your nights with the body
[1:26:24] making the full stature of a perfect man
[1:26:28] fulfilling the scripture in him
[1:26:32] dwelleth the fullness of the godhead
[1:26:35] bodily oh christ this
[1:26:38] body in the hour making himself known
[1:26:42] this is the house that he has built for
[1:26:44] himself
[1:26:46] not the house that solomon built but the
[1:26:48] house
[1:26:49] he has built for himself no you're
[1:26:52] not you are the temple of the living god
[1:26:55] and that the holy ghost lives in you by
[1:26:57] faith

[1:29:29] how he sits at night looks up to the
[1:29:31] stars

[1:30:01] that causes meat to shine that's the way
[1:30:05] it
[1:30:05] is with every true born

[1:30:14] giving that testimony living a life for
[1:30:18] christ
[1:30:19] then it's not the individual see
[1:30:22] it's the holy spirit in them reflecting
[1:30:26] back his light through that individual
[1:30:29] making his light to shine in a dark
[1:30:32] sinkers world
[1:30:34] oh glory to god i'm glad i'm a part of

[1:35:29] evening
[1:35:30] just like we are in the world today amen
[1:35:33] the one part is in darkness and one is
[1:35:35] in light

[1:47:53] the holy spirit
[1:47:55] and he's moving in human beings we have
[1:47:58] seen a star
[1:48:00] and that has caused us to come and want
[1:48:02] to worship him
[1:48:04] amen what is it wise men
[1:48:08] wise women wise people
[1:48:12] humbling heart they have seen his star
[1:48:16] and they are here to worship him that is
[1:48:19] in god's wrap
[1:48:20] gift amen think of it god
[1:48:24] by his word his law has made molecules
[1:48:28] that's the law of god then god made
[1:48:31] atoms
[1:48:32] when god made the sun and out of the sun
[1:48:36] from the sun came the stars
[1:48:39] for them stars are little pieces
[1:48:42] of the sun did you get that
[1:48:46] oh my not the s-u-n only but the s-o-m
[1:48:50] oh praise god out of that sun
[1:48:53] come them stars little pieces of the sun
[1:48:57] come flying off
[1:48:58] oh my you see what did they what
[1:49:02] why why what did he have what happened
[1:49:05] there
[1:49:05] you see that's his attributes
[1:49:09] that are now displaying themselves
[1:49:12] oh praise god his attributes came out of
[1:49:15] him
[1:49:16] and now the attributes are on the earth
[1:49:19] and they're displaying
[1:49:20] themselves i was remarking to my wife
[1:49:23] coming down the street
[1:49:25] oh by the way that is from a message
[1:49:27] called thy house
[1:49:29] i was remarking to my wife coming down
[1:49:31] the street
[1:49:32] how the moon and the star
[1:49:36] and that star was right there hanging
[1:49:39] just above that cross oh my
[1:49:43] i guess i look at things that way
[1:49:46] maybe kind of complementary to my belief
[1:49:50] in god and in my ministry
[1:49:53] but that's the way i see it what he saw
[1:49:56] the star
[1:49:57] on the top of the cross and we see the
[1:50:00] star
[1:50:01] on the top of golgotha's hill
[1:50:04] we see the star hanging on the cross
[1:50:07] and they have the star on the top of the
[1:50:10] christmas tree
[1:50:11] but don't understand the full
[1:50:12] significance they may even say oh it
[1:50:15] represents jesus but they don't
[1:50:16] understand the full significance
[1:50:19] but we understand that that one pointed
[1:50:22] to him that he was going to
[1:50:24] hang on a tree and die for our sins
[1:50:27] and to make us his christians amen
[1:50:30] praise
[1:50:31] god your whole world has become a
[1:50:34] petrifying
[1:50:35] sword oh my there is no
[1:50:38] clean thing anywhere

[1:50:45] unclean because santa claus
[1:50:49] has taken over christmas and
[1:50:52] birth in the manger and the rabbit
[1:50:56] and the chicken and new hats on the
[1:50:59] ladies
[1:51:00] have taken the place of the resurrection
[1:51:04] where does god appear in all this see
[1:51:07] man has made it all commercial
[1:51:13] but we keep our eyes upon his star
[1:51:17] is there where we're going to keep our
[1:51:18] eyes on keep your eyes upon the stars
[1:51:22] let's all stand as we look to the lord

[1:51:27] and there are
[1:51:28] other brothers and preachers
[1:51:31] ministers that are opening up the word
[1:51:34] that can tell you more about the star
[1:51:37] i depend upon the lord to send the word
[1:51:41] wherever
[1:51:42] he wishes for it to go glory to god

[1:51:48] of the stars
