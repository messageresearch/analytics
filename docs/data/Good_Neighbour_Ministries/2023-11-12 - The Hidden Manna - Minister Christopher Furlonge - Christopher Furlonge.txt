TRANSCRIPT

any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world

writer of the song he talked about what inspired him about this song he had heard a story of this man who I guess he was from Iran and Muslim guy who had got converted into Christianity and this man went against all the laws went around the country and raising up churches he would raise up 10 Church 10 people 10 churches with 10 people and they would go around and they would be ministering the gospel he eventually got arrested and was being persecuted by the government what they will do they will let his fingers grow out and take a visce grip and pull one nail out for each of the churches he rose up we might not have to go through that but let us look at our situation and see where where we could be more given unto the Lord where we can let ourself go give our away and some probably

they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it that's right amen reading for me Revelation chapter 2 verse 17 he that had an air let him hear do you have a air to hear this morning from the Lord amen amen are you expecting from the Lord today to speak to your heart because we don't hear with our natural is we hear with our hearts so he that had an air to hear Let Him hear what the spirit said unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Mana Hallelujah come on

God has a promise for you today Amen to the Overcomers amen hallelujah now there is a farming in the land not for bread and water but for the word and not just because there are so many churches yeah they say the speaking the preaching from the word amen but you know something it's not just for the word but it's for the true revealed word for this day for this hour amen hallelujah come on thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah the B but the Bible said in these days that there will be a famine not for the bread alone but for the hearing of the word would and men would go from the east west north and south trying to find it and they would feil amen hallelujah you see this is a special reveal word when you say h when you say hidden something that is hidden amen it's only hidden from the eyes who don't see who can't see but those who have eyes to see going to see it and those who have ears to hear going to hear it and it's for prepared vessels amen special people is a special food hallelujah thank you Lord the meaning of Mana as we read from the scriptures I believe in Exodus in the time of the the Journey of the children of Israel and was a miraculous food supplied to the Israelites in their Journey Through the Wilderness are we in our Wilderness today do we have a famine today lacking for the true revealed word of God out there on Amen but God has sent in this day some someone to store up food in the time of famine amen hallelujah and the those and that food is available for those special people hallelujah hallelujah are you special today amen amen hallelujah you are special

churches out there the preaching from the Bible Bible preaching the word right they say from the word from the written word amen but there is more than thaten there is a revealed word for this hour that is being set aside only for those who enter in the inner Veil see in the time of Moses is Israel Journey Through the Wilderness God commanded Moses to go and collect some of that manner that fell and put it in a vessel and place it into the holy of holies where God's presence is continuously present yes it don't SP spil it don't get stale amen hallelujah it's fresh every day it stays fresh every day and that is the hidden manner that was placed there for every generation after that a priest appointed to that office could have gone in there and partake of that manner and it be as I witnessed to them what God had done for them through that Wilderness experience amen so it was a testimony to them that any priest appointed into that position could have gone in there and that was only the priest and priest alone could have entered there back then now you are the priest of God today and God has made made a way for every single one of you to enter into that holy of holies and partake of that sweet manner that hidden food amen hallelujah that was just a type for what you are having to experience today now was death for anyone to go in there at that time that time was death but now is death if you don't go in come on hallelujah amen Hallelujah so there is an open way for you to enter in and if you fail to partake of that hidden food amen that has been stored up for you in this day God sent a prophet Amen in this end time and stored up that manner for you and I amen hallelujah that hidden manner that was hidden from all the denomination out there and it's still hidden from them and it's only for those who who have eyes to see the ones that overcome and who can see this revealed word for this hour to partake of that hidden manner what is that hidden manner the Mysteries that were sealed up and hidden amen God has revealed it unto us that there's going to be a body change in this time Hallelujah all these prophecies that we seeing happening right now all

hidden manner only God could feed you that but you need to have that desire to partake of it amen seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and all things all them hidden up things will be given to you you live on that sustain will it will help you on life Journey it will change your walk change your talk change your lifestyle amen hallelujah praise God so if you're going on a treacherous road today amen Turn Around Jesus is Calling You he's calling you to this this way that he has provided it may be straight it may be narrow it may seem strange amen strange to the world out there but to you and I is sweet honey from The Rock his word becomes sweet to you when God speaks to your heart you experiencing it right now when God speaks to you know that what you're hearing is the truth amen and you're enjoying itall you're enjoying it because when he corrects you you know he loves you when he encourage you he brings something across your path amen you know that he is with you he provides for you he said child I love you I love you child daughter son I love you amen amen it's only those that the father loves he chastising he corrects so when God corrects you amen you're supposed to be happy amen he said listen you're going on a a dangerous path there you need you don't need to do this no more I want you I call in your here here come follow me come follow me the way is straight and narrow amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord today blessed be his wonderful name thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you see there are plenty of food water clothes nice homes and cars to drive out there they're talking about beautiful homes and fancy cars and all the gadgets that people desire it's out there they don't have need or nothing they don't have need of anything amen hallelujah but there is a famine for the hearing of the true word of God Amen it's not every Church you're going to you're going to get this Center you go sometimes out there and you do visit man hallelujah or you you you want to listening to some of the things what you're receiving of from here amen is from Heaven amen is from Heaven that's right it's the truth amen it's corrective amen it's to give you Direction amen a lot of preachers a lot of ministers fail to cor collect the people to correct them they give they teach they preach a happy go lucky gospel a gospel of Love Gospel of God loves everybody you know God loves you know and a money moneymaking system gospel that if you do this you give this you get back this you know but when it comes to listen Hellbound and fiery preaching they want to take that they don't want to correct the people because they're going to lose congregation they're going to lose membership they're going to lose all this high high tight paying membership man so if you correct them they they want they they they want to lose that because they in a business but when you're in God's business amen under God's anointing under God's leadership you going to be responsible for those people amen that if you don't correct them as you say their blood is on your hand amen so you need to correct the people because God ways are corrective amen hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord thank you Lord Jesus so there's a famine for the hearing of the word and men do not know what to believe because there's so much teaching and Doctrine and Creeds and all kind of thing out there when you tell them it baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen they say well um Jesus didn't tell Peter name that you see faith comes by a revelation comes only from God that's it only from God can give you Revelation only God can open up your understanding that's right to the truth of this word amen hallelujah man can't give it to you not at all amen and when you receive it you know you receive it amen you know that is truth amen so there is nothing contradictory when you say baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptize in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost as we already hear and we been taught many times about it's just titles amen hallelujah so go back to the word go back to the the the prescription from acts and 2:38 amen hallelujah repent and be baptized in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus which is the foundation of Christianity the foundation of being a Christian hallelujah amen thank you Lord you see and so much confusion out there so people do not know what to believe amen and Satan love to bring confusion to confuse this teaching that teaching which one to believe which one to believe everybody's saying different different which one is the real one but if you lack Wisdom ask God if you lack Revelation he's the one to give it to you and he doesn't lead you astray even surely in a sincere heart God is going to reveal himself to you and reveal the truth unto you because Hallelujah you see when you receive him he he shall guide you into all truth amen amen and his word is truth and it's life Hallelujah so feed on Life feed on your truth and you get eternal life hallelujah praise God you know in the time of Elijah amen there was a famine in the land amen and Elijah called for the famine amen and everything dried up all around all around Elijah and Elijah time all no rain no nothing no food nothing and God took Elijah into a cave and fed him with Supernatural food Heavenly fooden hidden manner Heavenly food that even after that ran out am amen fed him with water every day Heavenly food amen and that's what you're receiving in this dry and tosty land that we living in amen hallelujah famine for the word of the Lord True Word of the Lord then after that he led him to a widow woman amen and he got miraculous food from a barrel of uh uh uh of flour and a cruiser oil amen hallel alah and that's what God has been doing to us the oil of the holy spirit amen and the bread of life amen Supernatural food in this time of famine hallelujah amen you see the time of Israel Journey Through the Wilderness praise God hallelujah I think we went that already praise God so my subject today was hidden Mana amen I didn't get onto it to let you be aware of what we speaking on today we're just giving you baby a little recollection back and forth amen you see hidden manner symbolizing God's word is concealed from the rest of the worlden Hallelujah it is special in sight from God that feeds the soul and sustains spiritual life you want me to repeat that again so you can grasp it what is hidden Mana is God's word is concealed from the rest of the world the denominational W is hidden from the wise and prudent and has been revealed unto babes and sucklings and such as those that want to get learning want to be learned man who wants to be receive that amen hallelujah it's special Insight from God that feeds the soul amen and sustains spiritual life thank you so here is the the the prescription or here is the remedy if you want a strong vibrant spiritual life what to do is to feed on that hidden manner which is God's revealed word for this hour am not Noah time amen not Moses time men but for this day amen for this time thank hallelujah thank you Lord and let me try to give an interpretation the best I can what does hidden manner types hidden manner was a manner that was kept in a place in the Bible that was only for the priests as we said before amen so at that time only the priest could have partake of it but God now is inviting us we are priests and Kings unto the Lord for you now you have full access to that manner Hallelujah you know the last time we talk about we spoke about the three experiences of man and how the temple types man man's experience right we talk about the outer Court the inner court and the holy of holies amen your experience could be out there your you're controlled by the natural elements by your outer ex the elements that controls your your your your being then if the Sun is up you're happy when it's raining you're sad man so a cloudy day you're in a cloudy condition then you go to the inner Court there was a candlestick artificial light you know amen so after a little while your light your life been burning burning amen your candle been burning your your your your lamb get suot or get cloudy The Experience get a little bit cloudy not just recapping a little bit you know but there is a place the holy of holies where the glory never fails you living in the presence of almighty God Amen your experience is fresh every day day yes amen hallelujah it keeps you nothing you shut out from the things of the world you're in this world but you're not of this world no matter what circumstance and conditions around your life out there you're locked in with God in a secret place hallelujah hallelujah daring and beholding his face so no matter what's happening there you and God Alone Hallelujah but but you know something your experience right now in the word of the lord your Christian experience could be of three different types amen you could be in three different conditions even right now hallelujah praise God you could be there on the outside man hallelujah praise God yes I serving God yes I coming to church you know um it's my duty for me to come to church to to pay my ties and do everything you know like that but you know you're just there that's your experience you're just there then you go a little f one step further you get justification now you get sanctification now you're a little bit more closer to the Lord your walk is a little bit more closer to him amen your life has been clean up yes you was out there you're still in the world a little bit dangling up with the things of the world but now you come and get a little bit closer to God Sanctified them things they kind of keep dropping off but you don't have that full blessing yet the full anointing the full surrendered life to God you know but God is calling you one step higher he wants you into that Holy place you said we sang this morning we are a temple of God yes you are a temple but you could be in three different stages in that temple in your life amen hope you're getting it your walk with him could be in three different stages with him but God is want want is is's calling you for a close close walk with him where you can be shut in with him and him alone when he's speaking lip the air with you when his Spirit has total control of your life are you willing to surrender all to him today that he can have full preeminence in your life amen that no matter what comes you Meen your life is totally in his hands and when you place your life in God's hands men he will lead you all the way he'll take care of all your troubles lay it all at his feet amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so where are you today where are you sitting today do you want to be with him into that secret chamber feeding on that Heavenly manner that encourage you sustains you amen encamps totally around you surrounds you totally shut out from all the experiences that may be offered out there in the world that there is no pull from the W you know a lot of Christians a lot of people who fall in the Lord men Hallelujah they're still attached to the things of the world just like the children of Egypt when they left Egypt the the the the the onions and the all the the the the spicy foods and everything all their things they they left it behind but their minds was still on it they're always looking back to that experience they had out there the the desire for those things was always there God wants your desire to be totally surrendered to him amen no more desire for the things of the world but your desire is for him and him alone amen why we come to church just to hear our next good some to tickle your ear or something that's not what it is for something that would feed your soul that would encourage you on this path to glory amen that should be every one of us you know uh expectations that God would give us that nourishment that sustaining ability that will encourage us amen that yes we have problems don't we have problems out there everyone faces problems situation conditions around our life but don't let us those things tie us down be focused and centered around our lives let him

sustaining power real sustaining nourishment today feed on God and God as in John says in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us amen it's it's a understand so you want is when the Lord said feed on my flesh they thought you know the people thought that he's a that you got to be a cannibal you see they failed to real recognize what he was speaking about because Jesus loved to speak in Parables and it only takes Faith or Revelation to understand what he was speaking about and Simon Peter knew what he was speaking about when he said to go baptize amen so when Jesus said to feed on my flesh amen and drink my blood you know they thought that was literal he was a cannibal amen but he said his Spirit which represents amen the life that was in that blood his Spirit to partake of that amen amen when we take communion we take communion with a true understanding of what we're doing amen amen so when you feed on the broken world you see when Jesus fed the 5,000 he broke that bread amen and he gave it to his ministers to feed the people Amen to feed his people to feed the pl amen hallelujah and that's what is happening today that

soldiers that are gonna stand at their post of Duty and fill for those that are you know starting to uh you know there's retired individual uals not retiring from the word but they're pulling back in certain ways in certain areas and God is going to add to the church this is all the move of God Amen so be under expectation to see what God is going to do praise God but like I said if you have any questions or concerns you see your Deacon uh thanks to all the saints that are participating in keeping our church clean amen we ask that you are respectful in when you're using the facility ities when you're whatever you're doing you know you're walking through the sanctuary you're walking downstairs and there's there's there's anything on the floor we appreciate it when we see somebody pick it up and put it in the garbage we want to keep the house of the Lord clean and we certainly appreciate those that are in that Ministry amen infants room the infants room is for twoyear olds and under okay newborns to twoy olds for feeding mothers okay no one else when possible it should be sisters only okay that are in there that are feeding their children and doing what they need to do with their young children amen nobody else should be in there no food no other food okay um you know mothers don't be taking your six and seven year olds in there to feed them lunch that's not what the room is designed for all right it's for infants up to two years old and feeding mothers amen praise God um and then when you do leave you know feeding mothers you do use it there's disinfectant wipes in there please disinfect the areas that you use Etc leave it clean the way that you came in we appreciate that all right on behalf of the Sunday School Superintendent sister Jennifer and the Sunday School teachers there's sister Amanda sister Marsha sister Jasmine Sister Rose they have implemented a parents Sunday school WhatsApp group chat okay it's for parents that have children in their Sunday school and it'll be moderated by Sister Marsha she will be sending out or maybe already has for some of the parents um you'll receive a message uh inviting you to this group chat as a parent that has a Sunday school child or children children in the ministry and it'll be used basically to collaborate on special events activities okay when they're doing song specials or upcoming events that they need to do practices for then they can notify you through this group chat and also for parents when they want to um you know communicate that their child will not be in the Sunday school because they may be sick or for whatever reason it's good for the Sunday School teachers to know in advance it helps them to properly prepare and they'll also be praying for your children if they're sick or whatever the situation might be amen so be looking um for that it's going to be strictly for parents that have Sunday school children that's who will be a part of this group chat uh Sunday school just a reminder it starts with two classes uh we have two classes ages is it 3 to five or 3 to six it's 3 to S okay so it's for children 3 to 7 and then there's another class that is from 8 to 12 amen and so those Sunday School classes they start at 10:25 am sharp it's important that you bring your children in before 10:25 so that the Sunday School teachers can start right at 10:25 sharp because they need to be we want to run it for about 30 minutes it needs to stop no later than 1055 at the very latest because some of the teachers do have other Ministries within the ministry for example they're in the worship team and so we are expecting that at 11:00 a.m. when the sun when when the song service starts everybody's in the sanctuary parents have their children and they're in the sanctuary with their children getting into the worship in order to prepare for the word the worship team they're going to be starting right at 11:00 am. and so those Sunday school teachers that are involved they need to be up here before 11:00 a.m. and so we want to remind the teachers even that they must finish their classes must finish their classes by 1055 am so that everybody can be in the sanctuary in the worship and when I say everybody that means everybody deacons trustees ushers whatever uh Ministry you might have even the cleaners your cleaning Duties are to be done either either before or after the worship and the word because we want everybody to be in the house of the Lord to receive the word of God that is going to come down every Sunday every Wednesday we we uh uh you know we want this proper order in place it's a part of the body coming together in the unity of the faith it's the things that are being preached amen and so it shows if you're actually catching the Revelation when you get into your position and you follow the leadership amen praise God trust that you will understand what I'm saying there amen song service will start right at 11:00 am we appreciate everybody's tithes and offerings we please ask that you continue to support the ministry and whenever possible please do it via ET transfer it is a preferred Avenue for the trustees it just helps them to um you know keep things or in order and less time here on Sundays um dealing with it all so whenever it's possible please if you don't have the information on ER transfer then ask your Deacon we'll get it to you right away amen you should be receiving updates from GN Ministry Communications this is an important Avenue by which we communicate all of our messages any upcoming events and details if you are not receiving it then you need to submit your email addresses you will be placed on the membership list and you will then be receiving all the updates as they come forth amen we look forward to our Bible studies on Wednesday nights and we continue to have our Friday night prayer meetings online and we will continue to do that indefinitely it has been a huge success everybody is um uh
