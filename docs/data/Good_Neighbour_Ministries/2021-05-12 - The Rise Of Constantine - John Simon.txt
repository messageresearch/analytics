TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening my dear friends what a joy it is to come into the house of god one with the other gathered together in his name this living assembly of the saints of the most high god we are here for another church age lesson and our scripture for tonight is found in revelation chapter 2 verses 14 to 16. and our topic is the rise of constant time the rise of constant time let us read our scriptures have a brief word of prayer and a short bible study in the presence of the lord as we prepare for the weekend and for those who come into his presence with thanksgiving and with joy we welcome all of you baptized unbaptized preparing to be baptized having your hearts open and ready to receive the word of god may the great holy spirit of almighty god minister to you the truth of his word we read from revelation chapter 2 but i have a few things against thee because thou has there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed onto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nickelodeons which thing i hate glory be to god our gracious heavenly father we thank thee for the reading of the word we pray that the great holy spirit will once again visit with us breaking the bread of life and causing us to drink of the stimulating effects of the presence and the power the efficacy of the holy spirit within our hearts and within our lives in the midst of the weak mingling mixing rubbing our shoulders and our our beings and our our our thoughts with the people of the world and the things of the world oh god which we were once in and we so love them pity them sorry for them and pray that the blood of jesus will be shed abroad in their hearts and they'll be brought to the knowledge the same knowledge that that was given to us by the opening of our hearts and of the word to thee be the praise that you showed mercy to us that we were allowed father to approach thee by the opening of our eyes and our ears to others their ears are deaf and their mouths are sealed but to us you have given to us an open door to thee be the praise the honor and the glory for we ask it in no other name but in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen praise god last week we spoke of the church of god in a state of pergamus in a state of purgatory in a state of persecution uh so we can understand that the church of god the little church that had the revelation of one god being persecuted by those babylonian priests who had the favor of the then seat of government and so using their favor they could manipulate the powers of the government to act on their behalf and to persecute the saints of god just as much as cain who was a brother persecuted abel who was his brother and so that happened naturally in genesis no it it ha it happened then spiritually and it is happening again in our day and in our time and i want you to be absolutely conscious of that or having a spiritual awareness that you might recognize it for everyone says i'm a christian i'm a believer i go to a church i do this i do that well cain was from the same mother or mother church eve we came from the same mother but they were not of the same father one of god one of the devil one of adam and one of the serpent we must recognize that this is why the bible tells us try the spirits and see if they be of god how do you tried a spirit they're tested or tried by the word of god give them the word test how do they react to this message how do they react to the truth of the word of god do they try to explain it away do they try to shuffle it away put it under a rug put it in the past or do they try to uh you know reject it to be lit lit or uh uh you know just put it to the corner no my brothers the moment you see that you realize that that's a spirit of darkness a spirit of light wants the truth what's the revelation wants the power of the holy spirit because man's soul is not fed by intellectual information even though to survive in this modern world it that is important education information is important but that is only to exist in this present world but to have fellowship in your encounters with god my friends we need that connection that supernatural invisible union of your soul to christ christ just means the anointed word for he was the anointed physically the anointed word son of god now we have the written word but only when the holy spirit comes and anoints that word to your eyes the word opens up your your vision breaks revelation comes and then you know how to act you don't just read the bible and try to act as they did in the past but you allow the holy spirit who is the same yesterday today and forever to reveal his word to you and without thinking about it you will be under his influence his power where you will be acting the life and living the life of christ even automatically and even unconsciously you won't have to think about your christianity anymore you have to try to do this i have to be that i have to do this i can't do this and i can't do that and they can't do the other now we don't do something certain things not because we can't but we don't want to because the word tells us and we want to walk in union and in line with the word of god and to obey the word of god hallelujah glory to god so the terrible persecution of official rome fell upon the true believers of that time until constant time arose on the scene and the first thing he did was to grant freedom excuse me freedom of religious worship and he had a reason or reasons why he granted religious freedom of religious worship and one he realized that the good emperors before him were emperors that left the christians alone and allow them to worship their god for the romans had many gods god for harvest god for traveling god for sickness god for this and a god for that now maybe called saints now but but that's what the romans had back then various gods for different uh things and so he left the christians alone because he believed in the eyes of the population he would be perceived as a good emperor and he realized that killing christians was a senseless affair there was no real political capital for him in engaging in killing christians and finally he noticed that the public had got tired of this bloody persecution of the christians and they didn't like it anymore even though they were pagans themselves they there were satiated with uh this bloody time of christians as the bible says they eat up my people as they eat bread oh my and thousands of believers slaughtered and killed at that time and the public turned against it and he recognized it as a good politician he left it alone and he took the uh persona he took the the appearance or to project the fact that he wanted to be recognized as a good emperor and so the persecution halted and christians began to have freedom of worship and to be able to give glory to their god on high that was his first reason for giving them freedom of religious worship the second and the best known reason is because constantine knew that he had a very difficult battle military battle ahead and he needed all the help that he could get because it was important for him to win that battle so that he could have the control of farm control on his empire the roman empire at that time one night he went to bed and constantine dreamed the dream and in his dream he saw a white cross appearing before him and the voice speaking saying by this thou shalt conquer and so he walk out of the dream struck by it him being a pagan why would he have a dream like that he looked on it as an old man from some higher power that was trying to tell him that if he got the christians to pray for him he would get the victory he would win the battle so he went to the christians and asked them to pray for him and promise them that if their prayers were effective he promised them absolute total freedom of worship and service to their god on high well you know the rest of the story he was victorious and freedom of religious worship was now granted not by just whim or wish or just mere words of the emperor but from the edict of nantes n-a-n-t-e-s 3-12 a.d freedom of worship was legally granted to christians and constantine made himself the patron of christianity at that time so he was the emperor but he made himself the patron because he now felt that if he took care of these christians and and and behaved in such a way that he could be a help to them whoever their god was would bless him and bless his empire watch over him and keep him safely so as a petr patron he decided that the church needed his help there you go now here is man trying to work the righteousness of god by his own will this is not by a dream this is not by a revelation this is not by direction this is his own feeling even though it's a good desire even though it's a good thought but it was not god's perfect will many times we have a thought we think this we think that go back to the word is it there does the word permit you does the word allow you is it the truth is that what god is telling you according to his promises within his word and so he decided that he would help the church in every way especially in her own affairs and here is where he uh emperor a politician a military man puts his influence and his hand into the affairs of the church my friends you understand what that is that how god's church and god's truth is is strange to the world and the those that are of the world and then that spiritual man an unnatural man can hardly find agreement because the natural spirit of natural man will not uh you know be in agreement with the spirit of god because one is carnal one is spiritual oh my and so the church started to go now into a tail spin like an airplane falling from the sky why he wanted to help the church [Music] is because this sworn in the flesh this patch of weeds in god's garden of eden began to come up because leaders of the church were in disagreement over certain doctrines and teachings in the church there was one called arius bishop of alexander who taught his followers believers that jesus was not god he was not truly god that's what he was teaching while yet claiming to be a christian of course the other group of people from the western church held a totally opposite view believing that jesus was the very essence of the one true god amen hallelujah so that caused the emperor to call for what we know in history and what you should note call for the council at the city of nicaea in 325 a.d called the nicean council and that council as i have for told you was the purpose is to work out the difference between jesus not being god and jesus being the essence of god the one true god god and flesh appearing hallelujah glory to god amen and so here it was this intrusion or interference of pagan influence through the emperor who thought he was doing good into private church affairs at the particular time was not according to the word even though you see i want you to catch this back of his thoughts he really thought he was doing good because he believed now he was uniting having this council so that he could unite the christians the two parties one believing in jesus christ as the one only true god and the other believing he is not god as such and so he wanted them to iron out their differences and come to a common understanding you're going to find that that same spirit that caused him to do that runs right into our day and in our time still attempting to do the same thing between the doctrines of the trinity and the teachings of hero israel the lord thy god is one lord there is one lord and jehovah that led the churn of israel as a pillar of fire as the cloud of fire in the old testament is the same jesus of the new testament for back there he was in a pillar of fire he was in a bush a burning bush he was in a pillar of fire he was in a pillar of cloud and now he comes back but where they try to to intertwine their trinity doctrine they don't realize that that was not a second person but that the god the eternal spirit the father spirit created a body for himself and that body was called his son because it came out from him and that body was a temporal one that he could come into and use so that he could speak to his people through that body so this is my beloved son hear ye him why because god was in christ reconciling the world onto himself and so all of this started with constantine trying to bring union unity of all the of the churches at that time that time together as one but that spirit didn't die it's alive until today still attempting to form a world council of churches still trying to bring about an ecumenical council and in their minds and in their hearts they're thinking like constantine did that this is a good thing this is a wonderful thing they're not seeing behind it the workings of that satanic power they're not seeing behind it the powers of darkness they are not seeing behind it the lies of lucifer they do not see the real motivator puppet master and engineer of what is really going on oh what satan failed to achieve back then he will achieve for the bible tells us that later on he will achieve that and it will come to pass that he will do it through an ecumenical move but thank god may god help us that before that time that he'll catch his waiting right away and she'll be in the presence of almighty god when this tribulation on the earth starts and the purging of sin and the purging of evil oh the coming of the king with his bride beside him riding on a white horse and his name shall be called the word of god hallelujah with the armies of heaven following him to bring about judgments of the wrath of god upon the face of the earth at that particular time oh praise god oh it's always a troublesome thing when governments begin to put their fingers and to interfere into the word of god and interfere in the ways of the church of the living god now the very decision in that that time that was handed down by the council of course uh was first of all they said it was right that jesus was the very essence of god two years later on the pagan influence that reversed it and said no uh that was that was a wrong judgment we gave and from that time that false doctrine started being foisted or placed in the minds and in the hearts of the people and it opened the door also for church and state to come together but this wasn't ready for known by god because look what age we are studying here today the age of pergamos and pergamos or the word pergamos means one sorry married sorrowly married so god already through the spirit of prophecy through the telescopic vision of god's prophetic saints uh prophets and servants he foretold that there would be a marriage a spiritual marriage taken place and here is what it is and here it was the spiritual marriage between state and church to this day those attempts are constantly being made church and state married now those babylonian priesthood could achieve their work of marrying the church joining or uniting the church with politics so politics and religion got united and the offspring or the child of that kind of a union what else could it be but some hybrid denominational uh work i'll just stop there and you can take that on but all manner of hybrids and eve brought 14 and now the state government mixed into the church brings forth nothing but a hybrid yes sir what did this interference accomplish first of all by interfering into the affairs of the church the church got married to the state who now feels it's responsible to watch over the church imagine that the state watches over the church when the church been the spiritual one that has the heart and the mind the eyes leadership guidance prophetic powers of the holy spirit to be able to even go to the king and tell him oh king this is happening this is going to happen that's going to happen but of course now they don't believe such things like elisha going to the king and say oh the enemy is going to attack you around here put your armies there or they're trying to come by this area no they don't believe in that anymore they don't trust that they will now come and tell the church what to do and how to do it but they try to do it in such a way well we only cost so far and the rest believe to you but they make sure they have their hands on it they can control every part of it now make no mistake about it god says you are to heed the higher powers that above you god tells us whether it's a good or a bad government he said be subject to the higher powers god put them there for a reason regardless of good or bad that's not our business we are here to be christians and to live the life god wants us to live amen now notice carefully while politics married to christianity at the same time that interference of christian time caused paganism babylonianism to be married into christianity so it's that the nicene concert paganism and christianity got mixed and intermingled together and all those mystery babylon teachings of the babylonian priesthood with its orders secret societies with all of its so-called uh mysteries and hidden knowledge got mixed into christianity and now they can put christian labels on it they can legitimately call themselves this or that name themselves with a christian name to gain credibility now constantine's interference also caused federal aid or government aid could now flow into the churches legally by law because that's the time when churches began to have money constantine began to give them buildings now you i i can't go on this but let me just drop the thought jesus never really had a church building none of the apostles if you read in your bible they know about the church building they met in homes they met everywhere it's at this particular time that he began to give buildings and caused the people to come up from homes come out from caves and grow into buildings now i'm not saying that we should go back on the trees or on the buildings i'm just showing you the the truth or the rationale of why this has happened just to protect us from the heat and the cold and our physical body give us shade and stuff like that uh but originally it was not so or we shall say in the words of god's servant in the beginning it was not so and so here it was the church began to fall air to properties beautiful buildings and money given to them to build beautiful marble white marble altars and beautiful carved images artistic they claim it's beautiful art it is but that's not whether it's art it's crude rude a rock or whether it's a beautiful image god said you shall thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god oh my and yet my friends it's being done even to our day and given such so-called dignity acceptability and credibility that masses multitudes are drawn into this net this web of sin this web of disobedience to the will way and word of god back to the word back to the original faith back to the bible back to the sayings that god has given to us that we might keep his word with all our hearts amen and so here are the beautiful altars like cain had a beautiful altar while a bell's was not beautiful just looks rough and crude a bloody bleeding bleeding lamb that was there crying for its life but yet dying for the lost oh just as jesus eli eli lama sabactin i and he gave up the ghost the lamb of god given his life for the loss that we might be saved oh thank god i know it was the blood i know it was the blood i know it was the blood for me well that day jesus died upon the cross he gave his life up brother sisters for the lost amen hallelujah and i know it was the blood for me oh praise god forevermore amen it was right in this age according to revelation chapter 13 verse 3 how that the beast was wounded unto death that was the pagan empire got wounded unto death but take god when we look in the bible we read that it actually came back to life next week we'll speak about that we'll expand a little more so you can fully and truly understand and i would like for you to read in preparation for that uh danielle chapter 2 verses 31 to 35. we would love to read that during the week actually you can read the entire chapter but we will be focused on verses 31 to 35 because this roman empire that was dying was wounded life bleeding out of it oh my friends was now about to arise come back to life amen but now imperial rome militaristic rome with all its legions is now transforming itself to return to power in the form of what is known today as the holy roman empire suddenly got holy no more pagan or no more so-called pagan in exit maybe pagan but her name was called the holy roman empire it suffered so much depletion so much losses right down through their entire histories oh when you see the time of the various ones right on true uh that'll take me into other histories let's just stop let's stop here we'll continue on next week as we go into how the roman empire transformed itself from a military and political power into a a religious power and therefore when it was dominating and controlling and ruling from the outside obvious as a military power it now transformed itself from a pagan militaristic political power into a religious power that would not control and rule from the inside now this is a symbol and type of mystery babylon and how the system works ruling and dominating right from the very confessionary of the priests right to the very pinnacles of rome tentacles everywhere in every nation every country almost at every street corner controlling dominating communications information flowing back and forth influences various kinds of powers acting as if it's a sleeping cat just sleeping with his eyes like lazy it's holy uh you know it's harmless until the moment comes it's disturbed and then the fangs come out and it's ready my friends to persecute and kill and destroy as it did in the years of the inquisition we will get back to the word of god we will talk more about this and get into the study of this are you with me shall i continue along this line oh praise god those those of you whose hearts are open whose minds are open and who are willing to receive this knowledge praise god take it in what you are receiving not even not many preachers don't hardly even know this they're not willing to receive this but god promised that he'll make the law places high and the high place is low may the great holy spirit take the knowledge of the word of god and fill all the earth and may the knowledge of the lord stand to the very end while we are waiting on the coming of the lord may the lord jesus christ bless you now and forevermore in a wonderful way and i'll be here with you preaching the word of god god bless you my brothers and sisters amen praise god [Music] you
