but you do everything to be here and the Lord knows your heart and may the Lord bless you for your sacrifice because your sacrifice what you put in is what you going to get the Lord bless you please I don't waste my time let us go into the word because you are not here to see brother Kofi you are here because you want to see the word comes to you yeah praise the Lord tonight I will speak about feith that's what God lay on my heart amen because without faith it's impossible to please him that's right with faith all things are possible to them that believe so uh brother Phillip lead us in prayer yes Lord yes Lord amen please we reading from Gans ginans chapter 3 verse 7 the same chapter 4 verse 22 and I'll read Romans 9:11 but that one you can sit down so we I begin know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreing that God would justify the heaven the heaven through faith preach before the gospel unto ABR saying indeed shall All Nation be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham okay that's one part the second part is for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by the B made the other by the fair woman right but he who was of the BN woman was born after the flesh but he of the fair woman was by promise okay may the Lord add his Blessing Romans 9:11 but that one why I'm talking I'll just bring it I'll just read it may the Lord had his blessing upon the word please be seated as I was saying God word come by faith without faith you cannot please God and someone may say what is faith faith is a revelation faith is the one that going to carry you and I through because through faith you can see what God is doing for your day because without faith it's impossible to please God there's all kinds of churches they are pleasing they think they praising God but because they don't have the Revelation like we have have right it become harder for them because the it make not the people know oh like you talk to some of denomination people they will tell oh Jesus is coming but he's coming they they thinking because they don't have feet they are thinking Jesus is coming way behind right but through our brother William Braham message when the seven seal has open it has declared to us 1963 the crowd that came on the sanset mountain that crowd was the second coming of what Christ to come and open the seventh seal so that when Christ opened the seven seal he didn't go he's here in the word form opening the word to us amen so we must know the time the hour that we are living in because when we look the whole world right now is what in a Tom oil Israel right now is under pressure of the whole world they want them to back off from Hamas but n has recognized naturally that he have to stand as a leader for Israel to go and root Hamas so is the wife of Christ the bride the spiritual bride we are the Abraham seed right no matter what the devil does to you my brother my sister rise up and possess the Gate of the enemy because if you don't rise up and possess the gates of the enemy the enemy will possess you and take over you because we live in the hour whereby God is speaking to you and I sometime of course we miss some it's like a soldier in a battle fail if you a true bride sometime you go into a battle and the battle you go you get lose the enemy shoot at you you didn't seee it and God allowed it but don't let that thing put you down because you have a God who have promised you you a God who promis Abraham who does not sleep who does not Slumber come on so that God is in you yes sir that's why he prays the word and says the righteous man falls seven times but he rise up seven times because why you are a soldier of the Lord you are a soldier of the Lord amen and a soldier sometime bullets hit you I grew up in barracks in my country I know about how soldiers do things how sometime it make even some people get frustrated and things happen and all that but let me tell you once they hear their Trumpet of the soldier trumpet everyone chest puffed up they are ready to take take the gun and go and do what the requirement of the commander saying to them and what is our commander our commander is the Lord Jesus Christ amen and he has told us through the prophet that the prophet asks him what is my future it says the angel of the Lord pick up the paper and true in the air when he came down he says your future is clear right don't you know it's a type of you your future is so [Applause] clear that I say sorry I say this Don't Be Afraid by The Arrow that fry by night or by day the Lord is on your side the Lord is on on your side he always protect you he always when you fall down just cry like me I cry a lot because I said my God why couldn't I see this that that that that that the enemy has knocked me down but let me tell you I am not going to stay down I'm not going to I'm I'm not a type of go going back like like something happened I'm going to go back that build me up how to go forward how to go into the trench and fight hard on the enemy because when you fight hard on the enemy you overcome and our enemy is what is not flesh and and blood even if I do you something no good don't look at oh brother Kofi did this brother Kofi did that brother so and so did that sister so so and so did that it's not the sister the enemy is this this this man here his enemy right but look away to Jesus that's what the prophet said when you look what did you see right when we look into this world the way the world is what are we seeing we must see Jesus that the hour is late that the time is at hand that once nyat is serious about going to root Hamas we also must be serious Amen brother going to root any evil thing that is attacking us so that we can be victorious right because the scripture says he that overcometh I will grant him to sit with me in my father's Throne right it didn't say he that go halfway many has come here halfway and they all gone but let not even forget about them when we pray remember them we don't know who the Lord maybe because they were fighting and they get Hur and because they get Hur sometime the devil does that right but when we stick together pray for them and surrender our heart with one Accord then the Lord will do a great thing and the Lord knows who he want who he doesn't want it's not my job not your job God is saying by faith Abel offer a better sacrifice than what king what is Faith Revelation right it is not easy my sister my brother I really let me let me say something tonight if you see a brother or a sister that bring people to Christ let me tell you respect that sister respect that brother you don't know what they go through because it's they they have to go to the enemy camp to fight to pull pull out that eagle and going to the enemy camp you get so much bullet bullets that sometime you don't want to even said what I don't I don't have where to put it but the Lord knows but we are not soldiers that back off no sir God didn't raise us God in God there's no back off okay we marching forward with the word of God with the anointing of God to defeat Satan because no matter what he does the Lord has promises our future is what clear clear your future is what clear and don't worry if you have fall down it doesn't matter how long you have fall down whether you are watching me online whether you are sitting here wherever you are watching me let me tell you you are still a soldier of the Lord there's no least soldier of the Lord or big soldier of the lord we are all soldiers of the Lord so have no fear have confidence in you you says in my father's house every weapon I need to defeat the enemy is there everything that you need God have it for you to defeat the Satan so don't be afraid by faith you can overcome anything all the challenge that enemy through with you before Jacob and Esau was born that's Romans 9:11 when you read it God says I love Jacob I hate Esau because in Jacob has already inside him the token he have the word of God the seed of God in him and so is you and I because that seed lay down there but your flesh is still have Temptation because this was born not by perfect will of God because of the sin that took place in the at Garden of Eden so the enemy will tempt us this sticky nature will stick there till we live here right that's it but don't be afraid don't worry about it the Lord knows how to pull everything that let that seed that he has placed in you come forth you see the Lily the Lily doesn't come from good place nice smooth clean place it come from muddy place but that Lily that Lily pushes out all the garbages all the FI and one day it bring forth nice perfume that that's why we get nice perfume to use if that Lily didn't come out like that there will be no smelling good perfume and that Lily is who you me so God is saying to you have confidence have courage have no fear you will make mistakes listen people think Christianity is holier than thou so as soon as you join Church you are perfect if you're looking for that kind I'm not brother Kofi I'm still here on this Earth right but there's one thing I press towards every day if I make mistake I'm going to make it right and move up further by Revelation I know I can overcome because this work I won't let no Satan distract me because this is one way Tak it in Africa you don't know we that come from Africa some people wanted to come to Europe like me one time I was so small but I tried I wanted to come and I came to Libya Tripoli I didn't have correct papers they put me in jail but in the night I look through the window on the sea and I used to see the Italian light it's far but I says to myself you know what the next time I'm going to make the next trip I'm going to pass over and go to Europe right I'm not coming back to Africa because the life there on my family that time was tough for me so you struggle you struggle you struggle you struggle you do everything and you want to hit the target right you don't want to hit it with a mess but it's like Christianity if you are afraid that you hit the you want to hit targets and you're going to miss and make mess you can't win nothing you can't be a good soldier for the Lord because you going to some time you you you want to strike the enemy then you see the enemy strike you but when you go don't go and said that's the end go back fix your your your ammunition good and attack again with full them the next time you see yourself you go over and what you wanted to achieve for the Lord you got it so is it with we that go to Europe you see so many of them some were even falling to the water dying they picking them bodies but it doesn't stop some of them they turn them back and they come they says we are coming cuz they see that that is the place they go at least they can have some what Natural Freedom so is the gospel the Lord has given to you the faith everything you need is in the word but he says you have to fight it by in you gain ground by inch you gain ground B but there a little here a little right you gain ground so revelation will comes to you by you coming to the service it's true revelation will come to you by you listen to the tape of brother Braham revelation will come to you by you listening to our beloved pastor preaching tiia preaching Christ proper preaching desmon preaching Philip preaching mind preaching there a little here a little yes sir it build you up and you will see that you'll be like a cocoon one day you're going to fly away or you'll be like a sheep you'll be started to produce a genuine mck because the cow don't know how he produce mil he eat the grasses and all he does is it bring forth what mck right a baby all he have to do is when he's hungry he cry and the mother quickly run and prepare the food and you you see her you give it to the baby and the baby just lick it slowly slowly slowly slowly look at you and me that's what has grown Us big as human beings and now even we are talking we walking we doing things but before we were born we didn't know what nothing right so don't stay home I don't encourage people that stay home because the great Holy Spirit don't want you to stay home be in his presence I don't care what you say if you have problem then you stay home problem like maybe your child gets sick something serious has happened that day there's nothing you could do you stay home and or go maybe in the hospital or something serious happen other than that pull yourself out be a soldier because a soldier you are in a battlefield we came to this world this world is not our home this world we are living in is not our home it's a mess it's chaos it's I don't care even if you live in Queen Palace or Vatican is still a mess you B there is still a mess so you need God you need Christ in your life you need Jesus and without him your life can't be complete because he's the one that complete make you complete he is the one that promised Abraham if you check Abraham life in the Bible showing Abraham is a man he lied right am I telling the truth he lie he make mistakes s the Lord even asks s a question s do what lie but Abraham staggered not the promise of God through unbelief what is unbelief sin is unbelief and what is sin if you don't believe what the prophet preached the Bible has said for this day the revealed well of the hour then you are a sinner then you need to come to Under The Altar and repent and baptize in Jesus name the Bible says the promise is unto you unto your children unto the many the Lord Our God shall call amen otherwise then except you believe that you Parish not me saying it the scripture is saying it only Christ can save no man on Earth no Priest No Pope no King no father mother only Jesus can SA so we must rest in him he's our antidote he is the creator that can do all things he's the Creator when we are in problems we goes to him he pick us up and Shel ties in his arm in his wing in his word and leaders because God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son these are not worse that whosoever believe in him should not what punish God children we cannot do what parish because we have the same material of God in us the same material you are the same material so God cannot destroy you and if God is inside you you cannot wait for fellowship if God is inside you you can't push your brothers and sisters out you will love them you will speak good for them whether they see it whether they don't when Jesus was here he spoke good for the whole world didn't he he spoke good for the whole world but what did the world do turn around and Pierce him put him in the cross and Jesus did he C them no all he says father forgive them they don't know what they doing doing right and many at times as Believers the road is not easy this road Christianity walk let me tell you I said it one time it takes a wise man or a wise woman to be a Christian is easy to become a president or or king of uh Hollywood uh atlete to make billions like Billy gate or apple and all those but take the gospel to them there you will see what the Lord has done for you there you will see that you are the wise men and Wise Women in the world in the eyes of God because wise person is not educated or El literate or rich or popularity wise man is somebody who can catch the word of God and go home and live it and and let the word of God made manifest for his day and it come by what by Revelation it come by Revelation because God word when he give you Revelation you know it you become so certain you become so confident you don't fear nothing even if death is coming to your throne you are not still afraid you know that absent from this body present with the Lord these things are not just written in just paper and ink only cuz remember this Bible was first they used to read it in the sky right wasn't written in the paper to the time of Moses god used to go to them and speak and their heart and they used to speak it and bring it but the Lord allowed it to put it in paper form and what sometime the enemy has does is he has learned the paper form a lot but he forget one thing that God will God is a spirit spirit and they that will worship Him will worship him what in spirit and in truth he deal with his children by what by his Spirit that's why when you make mistake it break your heart am I lying of Truth it break your heart it let you know what you have done is not right says make it right if you you don't make it right you're not going nowhere but if you are true son or daughter of God you cannot wait you are willing to make everything right put it before the table of the Lord and let the Lord deal with it so that the fire of God will fall and burn it so that you will be free so that the glory of God could shine because you know what the enemy has done you know what the enemy has done he tell us oh look at that brother you're going to tell him you do this you have done this you have done this then he know your secret even the pastor you tell him this you tell this you have know your secret then some of them Pride they won't surrounder then they walk up no if you are a child of God every spirit of God God going to try it by his fire every single one of us are going to be Tried by fire and you like brother Christopher one time said it you don't choose the tries you don't know how it's coming how it going to go only the Lord choose it right just a test comes to you like that broke you to pieces then if you are a child of God you can't wait from your father you cry you moan you say Lord help me I want to make it right I want to do things right because you know one thing the true child of God they don't care about popity they're not looking for position or popularity a true child of God doesn't look for those things God knows their hearts and he bring his his word to them and when he bring the word sometime even they themselves whoever he bring the word sometime they running for cover but God keep on bringing it because he God whatever he has spoken he says I am God I lie not whatever I have spoken I will perform it so tonight brother my time is up okay you said 8 okay all right so I have a letter time so whatever God has done for you and I let us know that this message not everybody can receive it if you are able to receive it that means you have the faith of God in you don't estimate yourself because without faith it's impossible to do what please God so ask yourself what make you come Sunday Wednesday prayer meeting every time you come here by what what by faith and you receive the word by what by faith you may think you don't know nothing but God is saying to you you are somebody in my eye you are the apple of my eye don't estimate yourself you are real Soldier when I God look to you you are the true soldier that the world don't know that God's Soldier he says one will chase a thousand two will chase 10,000 you think it's who who going to chase the Thousand you alone will chase thand but when you are two you're going to chase what 10,000 three what 30 or 40 I don't know more we are more than what concrete so don't esate yourself sometime you go down ask your big brothers to pray for you sometime you go down ask your big sisters to pray for you you will see what God will do to you even if you have made mistake the spirit will bring you right back a true repentance I remember one time when we were in brale that time sister Joyce was there brother Mike was leading the song and I used to work in direct home and I went to my boss and while I was in front of him he he asked me a question sharp question and I lie and I came home my wife I told my wife my boss was asking me a question and I lie I know it's not good my wife said oh yeah once you have make it right it's not good but God didn't like it that time the church was a lot and brother Mike was leading the song service in the middle of it he stopped says who have a testimony brother Mike sister Joyce get up and went and testify his testimony and I'm sitting down in the congregation and the spirit of God I could see my heart going boom boom boom boom I don't know what happened it dragged me to the front and I repent and let let me tell you I never felt the the spirit of God in my life like that God spoke to me the whole day he says why did you do that why and I could hear the voice loud and clear you did this because of me I said Lord I know what I did I make mistake I have to lie I have to make it right I don't care who it who you can call me what you want but God get the glory the lord I could hear the Lord speaking to my ear you are my son you are my son I love you you are my son I hear that loud and clear the whole day because why God when you clean up I believe like Isaiah [Music] when H King Hosea was blinding Isaiah for Isaiah to see God but the Lord have to take King oiah so that Isaiah could see Christ and when Isaiah saw it it what happened he was able to accomplish what God want him to accomplished and Christianity we can come with our tie our suit our dress looking nice but God knows the heart God is saying come open up the heart the Revelation that is coming from the pulpit take it go home eat it and you will be blessed you will be blessed it will do the job because listen God is streaming me you may say brother Kofi you are so strong you are so preach up this that no I am not I am the least in the kingdom of God when we went to montre Brother Ivan will tell you something happened and he was even pushing me I didn't know God put it into his heart and he says brother I know it's not you is God God I see that let me tell you popity po to preach no for witnessing when I came to the message it's on my heart I won't lie to anybody me and flip sitting here we used to go all the way to scabo East to just go witness to one person and bring him to the house of the Lord after the service we drive him all the way to scabo we used to be brel the church used to be bro and Dro in almost flip where ages right you can remember we on fire to witness that's all I I used to believe just people to get into Christ like you those days you want to sh the books you want to you want to push the word into the people throat but as you grow and the Lord begin to settle you down then you know that it's not so you have to let the Lord lead you and when God is leading you it's not you going to do anything he going to bring the person out would that Revelation is impossible to you praise God each and every one of us so take Revelation with you tonight with my broken words
