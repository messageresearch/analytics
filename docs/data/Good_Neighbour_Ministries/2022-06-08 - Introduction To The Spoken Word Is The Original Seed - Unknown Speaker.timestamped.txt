[31:56] hallelujah well
[31:59] we are going to begin
[32:01] tonight
[32:02] um studying in
[32:05] the
[32:06] wonderful message
[32:09] called
[32:10] this spoken word
[32:12] is the original seed
[32:15] this spoken word
[32:17] so tonight um
[32:19] we won't be very long
[32:22] because i'm just doing like the
[32:23] introduction
[32:25] a little bit of an introduction to it
[32:28] okay
[32:29] and then we will get into it uh starting
[32:33] more in depth
[32:35] next week god willing praise the lord
[32:39] hallelujah
[32:41] we
[32:43] we will look now to the word i wanted to
[32:46] comment but you know this is going out
[32:49] online so i'll leave that until
[32:52] afterwards
[32:54] brother branham is now praying
[32:57] our heavenly father
[33:00] as you said in your word
[33:02] if i be lifted up from the earth
[33:07] i will draw all men onto me
[33:11] and that is our purpose praise god
[33:16] see
[33:16] everybody talks about purpose
[33:19] but brother branham is making clear and
[33:22] the word is making clear
[33:25] that our
[33:27] chief purpose in natural life
[33:31] is to lift up the lord jesus christ
[33:34] to bring glory to his name
[33:37] to bring attention to him
[33:40] that people may look to him you remember
[33:43] in the wilderness
[33:45] when the people were sick they were
[33:48] poisoned they were snake bit
[33:50] and everything else
[33:52] uh
[33:53] moses made that uh
[33:56] that bronze
[33:58] carving or whatever of the serpent that
[34:02] was in the wilderness
[34:03] and he told them to look and live
[34:07] look and live you see what the serpent
[34:11] represented
[34:12] is sin
[34:14] dead on the cross
[34:16] when when satan
[34:18] satan actually was deceived in the sense
[34:21] that he was fooled he didn't realize
[34:24] when he was killing jesus
[34:27] he was really like a snake biting its
[34:29] own tail
[34:30] you see because death killed death right
[34:34] because he became sin meaning all the
[34:37] sins in the world
[34:40] past present future whatever he died for
[34:43] all of it
[34:44] so when
[34:46] satan think he's just killing him
[34:48] he killed all sin
[34:52] or brought an end to everything
[34:55] that's why paul kept saying if the
[34:57] princes of this world knew
[35:00] they would have not crucified the lord
[35:02] of glory
[35:04] because they would have realized what
[35:06] was happening amen hallelujah so our
[35:10] purpose in life
[35:12] is to lift him up before a dying
[35:16] generation of people
[35:19] just like moses did
[35:21] lifted up the serpent then tell him look
[35:25] and live look and be healed hallelujah
[35:28] but now we are pointing them back to the
[35:32] lord jesus christ
[35:34] and we are saying look to him and live
[35:38] everything you need is in him praise god
[35:41] and i'm so glad we serve this living god
[35:46] hallelujah praise the lord
[35:49] now
[35:51] we know
[35:52] that jesus christ
[35:54] is still
[35:56] he says this son of god
[35:59] nothing hasn't changed
[36:00] no matter how much time passed he is
[36:03] still the son of god
[36:05] you can't diminish his glory you can't
[36:09] take away from his accomplishments you
[36:12] can't do anything to lessen
[36:15] what what he did hallelujah praise god
[36:19] i'm so happy to know that praise god
[36:24] and now knowing that
[36:26] we know then
[36:28] that after this life is finished
[36:32] there will be
[36:34] another life on the other side
[36:38] hallelujah
[36:39] amen
[36:41] that will be so glorious
[36:43] that these toils of
[36:46] these few hours of life that we are
[36:50] passing through
[36:52] see
[36:53] will seem as nothing hallelujah amen see
[36:58] when you leave this old wretched body
[37:00] that you're living in
[37:03] and we cross over
[37:05] into the new body
[37:08] praise god
[37:11] and i'm so glad because the clarity of
[37:14] understanding that brings to
[37:16] not just me but to all of us
[37:19] uh uh on
[37:20] assurance uh a confidence in god
[37:24] that when we leave here
[37:27] when we come to our expiry date
[37:31] hallelujah as they say kick the can but
[37:35] when that can expires then it's thrown
[37:39] out but when we come to that time we're
[37:42] not worried
[37:43] because the bible tells us you are
[37:47] already before you actually expire or
[37:51] leave this body you already have an
[37:54] assurance by revelation
[37:58] that when we put off this mortal
[38:01] the prophet said by revelation you've
[38:04] already made contact with that theophany
[38:09] amen or you will not be seeing what
[38:12] you're seeing now
[38:13] for he said in that hour only the elect
[38:16] will see only the bride will be able to
[38:20] see and understand what god is doing so
[38:24] we already have made contact
[38:27] i know i made contact you have got to
[38:29] know for yourself
[38:31] whether you make contact with that that
[38:34] theophany out there
[38:36] amen you may not be able to explain it
[38:38] what it's like and all this type of
[38:41] stuff but you know
[38:43] that you have made a definite certain
[38:46] contact
[38:47] and something is speaking back to you
[38:50] something is revealing itself to you
[38:54] praise god hallelujah i won't get into
[38:56] all of that but the but the collectively
[38:59] all
[39:00] of the theophanies is really the holy
[39:02] spirit so you are only a part of that
[39:05] and that little part is your theophany
[39:09] but he the holy spirit is all of it
[39:13] praise god hallelujah so i'm thankful to
[39:16] god that we have blessed assurance
[39:20] we are not just here singing songs just
[39:23] to be heard
[39:24] that's why brother branham said if
[39:27] you're gonna sing or paul said it to
[39:30] sing with your understanding
[39:33] sing from your heart hallelujah don't
[39:36] just
[39:37] you know the singing songs just like
[39:39] it's a a matter of fault no it means
[39:42] something to me
[39:44] it's something in my soul that registers
[39:47] there there that causes me to know that
[39:51] i know i know that i know
[39:54] the devil doesn't come and tell me what
[39:56] i know i know what i know for myself
[40:01] by looking in the word of god something
[40:03] strikes me every time i look into this
[40:06] word hallelujah and i can't help see it
[40:10] seeing
[40:11] jesus christ lifted up before me every
[40:14] time i look into this word of god praise
[40:17] be to god hallelujah that is why it's
[40:20] not hard for me brother
[40:23] sister it's not hard for me
[40:25] whether there is two
[40:27] or there was ten thousand
[40:30] is this if it just brings the same kind
[40:33] of effect on my soul hallelujah because
[40:37] i just want to talk about jesus christ
[40:40] hallelujah i just want to talk about his
[40:42] grace i may talk about him but from
[40:45] various angles different ways
[40:47] approaching him but it's always him
[40:51] it's always about him and we thank god
[40:53] for that amen so we when this life is
[40:57] finished hallelujah and his trials of
[41:01] the road
[41:03] we are now passing through these sheds
[41:07] and shadows
[41:09] of life down here see what he's talking
[41:13] about is that this present state
[41:16] while you're living in this body passing
[41:19] through the earth here with all his
[41:21] troubles and trials it's just as david
[41:24] said yes
[41:26] i walk through the valley of the shadow
[41:30] another place you can find those quotes
[41:32] if you look there look it carefully he
[41:35] says it's just you're passing through
[41:37] the valley and you're having the shadows
[41:40] of death amen and that's what we are
[41:43] doing here because the devil can't
[41:45] really
[41:46] really kill us he can't really
[41:49] destroy us hallelujah he cannot do it
[41:53] whatsoever so the re the shadows of
[41:57] death that we are seeing now he says
[42:00] don't fear that i want fear if i pass
[42:03] through that valley i would have because
[42:05] all that is is a shadow
[42:08] but you know the devil that's a way of
[42:10] making shadows look so real
[42:13] hallelujah i've told it before i was a
[42:16] boy i woke up and i saw a man standing
[42:18] in the bedroom there
[42:20] and i was so scared i could not sleep
[42:24] until the sun came up and when the sun
[42:26] came up i found it was my father's pants
[42:29] hanging on the
[42:31] and his hat on the top of it
[42:34] you see so the devil has a way of using
[42:37] shadows and those shadows can appear so
[42:41] real to you but when the light comes
[42:44] you're able to recognize that
[42:47] you have needless fear
[42:49] for the bible says there
[42:52] there were they
[42:55] uh in fear amen when they need not fare
[42:59] when they fear not they need not to fear
[43:01] whatsoever or where there was no where
[43:04] no fear was there were they in fear
[43:07] where no fear was that's what the bible
[43:10] says so i thank god for that amen see
[43:15] passing through
[43:16] the valley of the shadows of that death
[43:21] because in their the testing ground
[43:25] hallelujah
[43:27] and isn't that right
[43:29] the testing ground is right here and
[43:31] sometimes you get tested right to your
[43:34] breaking point you think you're gonna
[43:36] die but it's just a shadow of death
[43:40] you're not going to die praise god
[43:43] you're just passing through the testing
[43:45] ground and god knows like paul said
[43:49] he knows exactly how much to test you
[43:55] right
[43:56] just exactly to bring you to that point
[43:59] and then he takes back his hand off so
[44:02] you can get some relief but by that time
[44:04] oh
[44:05] you feel so saved right praise god you
[44:09] know have you ever watched a robin uh
[44:12] taking a worm out from the ground
[44:15] god built them that way they know
[44:17] exactly how much tension to pull that
[44:20] worm so it don't break
[44:22] it doesn't escape and they just go like
[44:24] that they do it quick but that's what
[44:26] they're doing they're sensing the
[44:28] tension from that worm so they can pull
[44:30] the whole worm out and it doesn't break
[44:33] whatsoever and the bible is telling us
[44:36] the same thing
[44:38] that he will not tempt you or test you
[44:41] with some temptation you are not able to
[44:45] bear
[44:46] there's so much hidden under there that
[44:48] is telling you that he already knows
[44:51] each one of us he knows our breaking
[44:54] points
[44:55] some more than others and he know
[44:57] exactly how far to take you and every
[45:01] time he takes you there because he
[45:02] doesn't stop you grow a little stronger
[45:06] he pulls you a little more you grow a
[45:07] little stronger
[45:09] whatever but that's what this is all
[45:11] about we're just passing through the
[45:14] valley of the shadows of death praise
[45:18] the lord jesus hallelujah oh my we are
[45:22] now entering into an orbit thank god i'm
[45:27] in orbit i don't know about you but i'm
[45:29] in orbit i'm just moving
[45:32] and waiting praise god for that call to
[45:35] come from above the countdown is here
[45:39] praise the lord glory to god amen for
[45:43] soon there will come a time
[45:46] when god's time is fulfilled not man's
[45:50] time but god's time is fulfilled
[45:54] hallelujah see
[45:56] it is god's time and that great arm has
[46:00] held back the time for so long
[46:03] hallelujah well we know what that was
[46:06] because i
[46:07] we all misunderstood it when the angel
[46:10] raised his hands to heaven and said time
[46:13] shall be no more we thought it meant end
[46:16] of the world
[46:18] but we understand that it didn't mean
[46:21] the end of the world it was speaking
[46:23] about the end of the seven church ages
[46:26] time shall be
[46:28] no more praise god and so
[46:32] we we clearly see that that the time
[46:36] when god's time is fulfilled
[46:39] and he holds the time back for so long
[46:44] but finally he will let it go
[46:47] amen
[46:48] and when he does
[46:50] the church will move off from this earth
[46:53] hallelujah into space out yonder into a
[46:58] land where there is no sickness sorrow
[47:01] or old age or death and that's why we
[47:05] are gathered here today praise god i'm
[47:08] so thankful to god amen brother sister
[47:12] that there is a land
[47:15] we move out of here and we move to
[47:17] another land and it's a total opposite
[47:21] of this
[47:22] you see satan tries to copy cat and he
[47:24] try to get a reflection of the one
[47:26] that's there but that one is the one
[47:30] we're headed to
[47:32] oh praise god hallelujah amen do you
[47:36] know
[47:37] uh as i
[47:39] was uh looking into this
[47:41] i could clearly see how god used the
[47:45] prophets
[47:46] of malachi 4 revelation 10 7 whom we
[47:50] know as william marion branham the 20th
[47:54] century prophet
[47:56] god used him in the operation and
[48:00] manifestation of the gifts
[48:04] hallelujah to prove to us
[48:08] there is a land that you can't see
[48:12] there is a dimension here that you have
[48:15] not yet entered into
[48:17] but by these gifts he was proving to us
[48:21] only believe all things are possible
[48:24] when you leave here you go into that
[48:27] other dimension you go to that other
[48:29] land because look i'm seeing it
[48:32] i'm seeing it
[48:34] this is what's happening in that land i
[48:36] even crossed or was allowed to cross
[48:39] over and can't come back right here
[48:42] there is a land
[48:44] oh praise god i'm so glad there's a land
[48:48] beyond the river
[48:50] that we call a sweet forever
[48:54] amen and we'll only reach that shore by
[48:58] god's decree amen hallelujah and he did
[49:02] decree
[49:03] that you and i will be there
[49:06] because we are his germs we are his seed
[49:10] oh praise god let me not get into that
[49:13] oh praise god but more brothers we are
[49:17] the original
[49:19] amen and we come from god and that's why
[49:23] we are traveling back home to god see a
[49:26] lot of these things is happening right
[49:28] now
[49:29] but because we are in this flesh we're
[49:31] not conscious of it but it's taking
[49:34] place right now
[49:36] and we're in the middle of a great
[49:38] supernatural events
[49:40] are taking place around us
[49:42] amen glory to god hallelujah i'm so glad
[49:47] to know
[49:48] that this is not just bringing us
[49:51] together
[49:53] for something
[49:55] in vain
[49:57] but it has been proven to us
[50:01] to be the greatest reality in the world
[50:06] hallelujah now what i told you about the
[50:09] gifts and how he operated under the
[50:11] gifts and
[50:12] came back and gave us answers and now
[50:15] that's not you're not going to find this
[50:16] here but i'm telling you here and uh i
[50:19] know that that is
[50:21] where he is going and that's what he's
[50:23] saying that is proven to you over and
[50:27] over again that there is a greater
[50:30] reality
[50:32] you think this is reality but this
[50:35] reality so called your eyes and your
[50:37] mind will pass away but there is an
[50:41] unfailing reality of a living god
[50:44] that will not fail praise god cannot die
[50:47] can't pass away but will always be there
[50:51] for every one of us praise be to god
[50:55] hallelujah amen yes
[50:58] the greatest reality has ever been known
[51:01] hallelujah and to begin to know that
[51:06] greatest reality it is this
[51:08] that the son of god is not dead but he's
[51:13] alive praise god
[51:16] amen oh praise god that's the greatest
[51:20] reality for you to become aware of
[51:25] oh
[51:25] when you are aware
[51:27] that you he is not dead but he is alive
[51:32] praise god sometimes you go alone in
[51:34] your prayer room
[51:36] and uh my friends if you you because
[51:38] we're in this flesh sometimes you even
[51:40] get scared
[51:42] you say oh you're scared but you're in
[51:44] the presence of god yeah you your flesh
[51:46] in contact with the power of the holy
[51:48] spirit and the presence of the living
[51:50] god are you praying by your bed and you
[51:53] feel somebody sit down on the bed right
[51:55] now you listening to what you're saying
[51:58] my god i'm letting you know it's real my
[52:01] brothers my doubts are settled and i
[52:04] know the word of god is real not only
[52:07] the word written word but the living
[52:10] word it lives forevermore
[52:13] he's not dead they couldn't crucify him
[52:16] they couldn't burn him they couldn't
[52:18] bend him they couldn't bury him but he's
[52:21] alive here amen and he's with us praise
[52:23] the lord we come together like this to
[52:26] worship and to glorify the name of the
[52:30] lord and when we do that brother branham
[52:33] said whenever you begin to worship sing
[52:36] talk about the word in reality he says
[52:39] jesus draws near
[52:43] just like he did in ms
[52:45] he says you see always talk about him
[52:48] you want him always near you you always
[52:51] want him to be around you so think about
[52:54] him talk about him and when you start
[52:57] thinking about him talking about him he
[52:59] says jesus draws near oh thank god
[53:03] hallelujah amen amen praise god he's
[53:08] alive
[53:09] amen
[53:11] for he made the promises hallelujah and
[53:15] so he is alive among us forevermore
[53:20] amen because he is there to back up his
[53:23] promises
[53:24] to back up his word
[53:27] god's words are not empty words that go
[53:30] in the ear and disappear but god's words
[53:33] live on
[53:35] they live forever
[53:37] the words he said i speak their spirit
[53:40] and their life
[53:42] praise god now you go down that in your
[53:44] mind it's not just the bible is talking
[53:46] about you too their spirit
[53:49] beings and their life because they're
[53:51] part of his life amen praise god they
[53:54] can't fail they can't fall they can't
[53:56] you know they can't disappear and if i
[53:59] send them forth he said the word that i
[54:02] sent forth or speak he says it cannot
[54:06] return to me void
[54:08] first of all he just doesn't think about
[54:12] one of them not returning
[54:15] the word that i speak the words i speak
[54:18] they
[54:19] shall return to me they cannot return to
[54:22] me void hallelujah everyone is going to
[54:26] return he already knows that and he's
[54:28] saying when they come back they're not
[54:30] going to come back void or empty praise
[54:33] god i'm so thankful to god for that
[54:36] hallelujah that we are going to return
[54:39] fulfilling all the various uh purposes
[54:43] that he had in his mind for every one of
[54:47] us
[54:49] so we are trying them knowing this
[54:53] that there is a land
[54:55] praise god
[54:57] that there is another dimension as we
[54:59] spoke of on sunday
[55:02] like the prophet said is passing through
[55:04] the room right here
[55:05] it's just that you can't see it you
[55:07] can't feel it
[55:08] then he talks about a radio he said you
[55:11] have a radio you see he says they're
[55:13] picking that up now because by science
[55:16] they develop a crystal or something
[55:19] where they can tap into that
[55:21] not the places he mentioned like
[55:23] children breaking into god's toolbox and
[55:27] playing around hallelujah you see but
[55:30] there is a land there is another
[55:33] dimension
[55:34] and that's why he said a prophet is
[55:36] different to you you see
[55:38] you have to pray and pray or or dream
[55:41] before your conscience and subconscious
[55:44] can come together and then god can
[55:47] reveal or dream or give you something
[55:50] like a vision or something he says when
[55:52] the prophet is not like that a prophet
[55:55] comes with both already together and
[55:57] he's looking in this dimension and he's
[56:00] still looking in the other one
[56:02] and that's why he can scream out like
[56:05] that and tell you it's real it's right
[56:07] here right now he's in the building why
[56:10] he is seeing it amen he said oh he's
[56:14] going around the building now it's right
[56:17] praise god hallelujah that's what he
[56:19] said do you believe in other words
[56:21] believe him and wait and pray to god
[56:25] until the day he'll open your eyes that
[56:27] you'll be able to see it
[56:29] but you know that day is coming
[56:32] you know it's already in the bible
[56:33] telling you that day is coming
[56:35] when you and i are going to start seeing
[56:37] to that land
[56:39] before we break over on the other side
[56:42] you remember when jesus went and bring
[56:44] them saints out from that were
[56:46] imprisoned there and brought them out of
[56:48] there and put that and they were in
[56:51] jerusalem and what did the bible say
[56:53] they started to see those saints
[56:56] hallelujah they started to see them
[56:58] praise be to god and i'm telling you
[57:01] right now before we break out into the
[57:05] event let's say of the rapture and grace
[57:08] of god
[57:10] some of us are to
[57:12] rub our eyes am i seeing right but how
[57:15] do i know that man is abraham
[57:18] you see
[57:19] just the same way that you know this
[57:21] word of god is right
[57:23] and he is a part of that word so when
[57:25] you see him you don't have to have a
[57:27] description of him before you see him
[57:30] because you know the word and because
[57:32] you know the word the moment you see any
[57:34] one of them you're going to know them
[57:36] praise god it's all by revelation and
[57:39] inspiration
[57:40] brother sister we are in a tremendous
[57:43] time of this message
[57:46] and i want to say god has blessed us
[57:49] to a great extent kind of being almost
[57:53] like a head of the pack
[57:55] and so
[57:56] it makes us having to be careful of what
[57:59] we say and how we say it praise the lord
[58:02] oh praise god forevermore how wonderful
[58:05] to know
[58:06] i am so glad that god gave us a prophet
[58:10] the prophet
[58:12] and that man faithfully patiently with
[58:15] the grace and love of god in his heart
[58:17] constantly waving that wave sheep
[58:20] trying to tell us there's another realm
[58:23] this is not this just this life or when
[58:26] this life is over it's all done and gone
[58:29] no there is another land there's another
[58:32] place we go to oh one has paid the price
[58:35] for you to travel and go there
[58:37] your price is paid you don't have to
[58:40] worry just commit yourself repent of
[58:42] your sins turn from your wicked ways
[58:45] come to jesus christ know him in the
[58:48] power of his resurrection
[58:50] oh my what are an assurance it gives to
[58:54] the soul of the christian
[58:57] oh my friends this great hour is now
[59:02] approaching us
[59:03] we see that time coming before us lord
[59:07] and our hearts born within us
[59:11] why because he's talking with us along
[59:14] the way
[59:15] not physically but he's doing the same
[59:17] thing just as we talking about the word
[59:19] he comes with us and he talks to our
[59:21] hearts and our hearts begin to burn
[59:23] along the way praise god why we
[59:28] are hearts born because we want to make
[59:32] ready hallelujah praise god we want to
[59:35] make ready praise god hallelujah
[59:40] and as we make ready then what happens
[59:43] one by one we go down that lane
[59:49] amen i use the other word that he loves
[59:53] and sings one by one we gain the portal
[59:57] amen praise god hallelujah
[1:00:00] dare to dwell with the immortals oh
[1:00:04] praise god hallelujah oh my
[1:00:07] lord bring our hearts so we understand
[1:00:12] oh god bring sinners even to repentance
[1:00:17] bring the sick people
[1:00:19] and let them be healed
[1:00:21] bring
[1:00:22] others
[1:00:23] so that they may come to the knowledge
[1:00:27] of god
[1:00:28] oh
[1:00:29] hallelujah oh god and then bless them
[1:00:33] saints and bind their hearts together i
[1:00:36] believe that's what he's doing right now
[1:00:39] amen praise god hallelujah oh and may
[1:00:43] them ministering brethren
[1:00:46] who maybe
[1:00:47] once used to misunderstand
[1:00:52] may they understand
[1:00:54] now hallelujah he was saying that then
[1:00:58] but i am repeating his words at the same
[1:01:00] time i'm saying the same thing right now
[1:01:03] because i know what it means a lot of
[1:01:06] people misunderstood
[1:01:08] because they hadn't come to that place
[1:01:11] yet and it seems like a a lot of
[1:01:13] ministers are starting to come to that
[1:01:16] place and recognize what god is doing
[1:01:19] hallelujah and what god is manifesting
[1:01:23] by the opening of the word of god
[1:01:27] hallelujah amen and may they
[1:01:31] now these ministering brethren may they
[1:01:34] who once misunderstood
[1:01:36] let them understand now lord so that
[1:01:40] your church
[1:01:41] might be
[1:01:42] prepared
[1:01:44] hallelujah praise the name of the living
[1:01:48] god amen
[1:01:49] now
[1:01:51] my beloved brethren
[1:01:53] everything that i have said
[1:01:56] and i have done
[1:01:57] i have said it from my heart
[1:02:00] and i want you to know
[1:02:02] i did it for a
[1:02:04] purpose
[1:02:06] you remember i always use a quote when
[1:02:08] he goes back unveiling of the of out of
[1:02:11] my unveiling of god i think it's page
[1:02:13] seven where he says the things i have
[1:02:16] said and i have done he used the same
[1:02:18] words but then he went on further i
[1:02:22] purposely said it
[1:02:24] and did it and then he gave the reason
[1:02:27] why that some may go out
[1:02:29] right you know some may get wandering
[1:02:31] some maybe left confused other ones
[1:02:34] might just you know
[1:02:36] come in and so on he said clearly he
[1:02:39] said but i did it
[1:02:42] all for a purpose
[1:02:44] amen hallelujah and
[1:02:47] what this is all about
[1:02:50] is by god's help
[1:02:52] to explain to you from the bible
[1:02:56] that purpose
[1:02:58] and why i have done it
[1:03:00] amen praise the lord so that is really
[1:03:04] what we are going to be studying here in
[1:03:06] the weeks to come praise the lord why
[1:03:10] god used him in that way now
[1:03:14] he said you might disagree with me
[1:03:18] right
[1:03:19] and uh
[1:03:21] because
[1:03:22] you see
[1:03:23] you have a right to disagree with me
[1:03:26] as you may see it different amen
[1:03:31] hallelujah oh my friends that's the
[1:03:34] place we we have got to come to
[1:03:36] that people have a right to disagree
[1:03:40] and they have a right to disagree with
[1:03:42] you
[1:03:43] and with me
[1:03:44] even even though it's the word of god
[1:03:46] you're quoting to them
[1:03:48] even though you're telling them the word
[1:03:49] of god don't get upset
[1:03:53] don't get mad
[1:03:54] they have a right to disagree because
[1:03:57] especially if they're not seeing it yet
[1:04:01] what are you going to be fighting up and
[1:04:04] trying to by argumentation by logic by
[1:04:07] reasoning by
[1:04:10] man's
[1:04:11] will trying to convince them it's the
[1:04:14] holy spirit's job
[1:04:17] all you need to do is bring the love of
[1:04:19] god in your heart the understanding the
[1:04:22] patience the temperance and all these
[1:04:24] various fortunes with you around them
[1:04:28] and let the spirit of god use that to
[1:04:30] create an atmosphere around them that he
[1:04:33] could drop into and then speak into
[1:04:36] their hearts praise the lord and bring
[1:04:38] about it praise the lord hallelujah amen
[1:04:42] and friends
[1:04:44] this i will be ending here in a few
[1:04:45] minutes
[1:04:48] i want you to know
[1:04:50] praise the lord
[1:04:52] let me back up here a bit
[1:04:54] praise the lord
[1:04:56] now
[1:04:58] no matter
[1:05:01] see i have never had a bad feeling
[1:05:04] against anyone
[1:05:06] i can't say that
[1:05:09] but brother branham could say that at
[1:05:11] the time
[1:05:12] we all had to repent and confess
[1:05:15] and lay those things down
[1:05:18] i can say at this time i don't have any
[1:05:20] bad feelings against anyone
[1:05:22] because i've come to the understanding
[1:05:26] of the word of god
[1:05:27] and clean out myself
[1:05:30] hallelujah
[1:05:31] not with cenapods but with the savior
[1:05:34] spots save you you want to put it that
[1:05:37] way
[1:05:40] no matter if they disagreed with me as
[1:05:43] far
[1:05:44] as the east is from the west
[1:05:47] i still love them
[1:05:50] and as long as i have the spirit of god
[1:05:53] in me i'll always love his people
[1:05:58] no matter what they do
[1:06:00] hallelujah praise god in other words
[1:06:03] you're looking right at them and you
[1:06:04] know what they're doing is wrong but it
[1:06:06] says don't matter what they do
[1:06:09] i still love them
[1:06:11] the old thing back in all pentecost and
[1:06:14] even in the early days of the message a
[1:06:16] brother or sister do something and you
[1:06:17] distance yourself from them now it's a
[1:06:20] different matter if they distance
[1:06:22] themselves from you
[1:06:25] because the devil is going to play on
[1:06:27] their mind and tell them that that you
[1:06:29] want nothing to do with them because
[1:06:31] he'd done this and she done that and the
[1:06:33] other one done this and the other one
[1:06:34] done that but they don't understand the
[1:06:36] grace of god just like how god looks on
[1:06:38] things with no impartiality that spirit
[1:06:41] starts coming on you that you don't have
[1:06:43] no partiality you don't condone wrong
[1:06:47] but you don't just uh you know get away
[1:06:50] from people and as they're all teaching
[1:06:52] of separate yourself mean to they in the
[1:06:54] same restaurant and you go on to the
[1:06:56] opposite side of the wall because you
[1:06:58] want nothing to do with them oh it's
[1:07:00] nothing of the kind amen praise god now
[1:07:04] that would be we now have the
[1:07:06] opportunity now to embrace
[1:07:08] we have the opportunity now to exercise
[1:07:11] and manifest their love of god
[1:07:14] the 11th commandment is now in force
[1:07:18] we under the spirit of charity
[1:07:21] we under the inspiration of the capstone
[1:07:24] hallelujah now doesn't mean you're
[1:07:26] compromising when you do that
[1:07:29] that's just a legalistic spirit praise
[1:07:32] god you listen paul said even if we got
[1:07:35] to reach down our hands and pluck them
[1:07:38] like a brand from the burning you know
[1:07:40] what he's saying there if you got to
[1:07:42] reach your hand sometimes almost in the
[1:07:45] pit of hell to pull them out
[1:07:48] hallelujah and you may get some burns
[1:07:51] too
[1:07:52] when you're trying to pull them out
[1:07:55] because people looking on wouldn't
[1:07:57] understand what you're doing and they're
[1:07:59] going to bring all kinds of
[1:08:01] accusations against you
[1:08:03] you know one time a brother
[1:08:06] was in a bar
[1:08:08] i'm not telling you to go to a bar
[1:08:12] but they happened to have a christmas
[1:08:14] party at the end
[1:08:16] and he was the administrator of the
[1:08:19] hospital and the employees
[1:08:22] said come on you have to come but then
[1:08:24] he's a preacher they know he doesn't
[1:08:25] drink he doesn't smoke on this but he
[1:08:27] said but you must come and so and so and
[1:08:29] he thought about it and he decided he
[1:08:31] was going to go
[1:08:32] and when he went there he asked them for
[1:08:35] what we call a cream soda uh any of you
[1:08:38] know what's a cream soda
[1:08:40] okay well you know that it's clear it
[1:08:43] looks like vodka
[1:08:44] and sure enough by the next day the
[1:08:47] rumor had gone around the first time
[1:08:50] i've seen this man take a good drink
[1:08:54] i was
[1:08:56] they i passed there and i saw with these
[1:09:01] eyes
[1:09:02] right through the glass of the of the
[1:09:05] bar room i saw him put that glass too
[1:09:10] and he took the whole thing done in one
[1:09:12] shot
[1:09:14] like an experienced drinker
[1:09:17] it's not till later he had to explain to
[1:09:19] them it wasn't vodka it was just a cream
[1:09:22] soda
[1:09:24] but the devil will take anything like
[1:09:25] that to burn you
[1:09:27] is that what i mean he going to a bar
[1:09:30] room
[1:09:31] because he said now they really want me
[1:09:33] to be there to give him an opportunity
[1:09:35] to be able to witness to some of them
[1:09:37] like that right but while he's in there
[1:09:40] he pick up some burns so that's what i'm
[1:09:43] saying that uh sometimes we have to bear
[1:09:45] the reproach for his name
[1:09:49] right that way i remember talking to
[1:09:51] some
[1:09:52] fisherman
[1:09:53] and uh their
[1:09:55] girlfriends were prostitutes of the red
[1:09:59] light district and all like that but god
[1:10:01] led me to witness to them they're
[1:10:03] cursing me swearing while i'm witnessing
[1:10:06] and and then
[1:10:07] when the others don't realize it
[1:10:10] two of them slip away and talking to me
[1:10:12] quietly in the background
[1:10:14] you see and as i've said
[1:10:17] i've left the sea some of them got
[1:10:20] married raised families and they were
[1:10:23] even stricter than the regular dad
[1:10:26] because they knew life they knew what
[1:10:28] life is all about and so they just stood
[1:10:31] their ground but some and of course i
[1:10:33] got all kinds of calls all kinds of
[1:10:35] names at that particular time because
[1:10:38] nobody realized what it was you're
[1:10:41] trying to accomplish amen praise god
[1:10:45] that's as much as saying the scripture
[1:10:46] just came to me
[1:10:48] that he's a friend of sinners
[1:10:54] he's a friend of simmers
[1:10:56] and surely of course that's they were
[1:10:57] speaking the truth and the prophet
[1:10:59] saying the truth not knowing it he was a
[1:11:01] friend of sinners and that's what he
[1:11:03] came to do
[1:11:04] is to save sinners amen no matter what
[1:11:08] they do
[1:11:11] or no matter how they may treat me
[1:11:16] oh stop right there oh my goodness it's
[1:11:19] one thing what they're doing and and
[1:11:22] that some of us may put up with well
[1:11:25] when it comes to the point of how they
[1:11:28] treat me
[1:11:30] hey that's another matter now
[1:11:32] oh
[1:11:33] they're attacking your persona you're
[1:11:36] attacking you personally so you got to
[1:11:39] defend yourself you got to get your arms
[1:11:43] up and ready to do battle but no that's
[1:11:46] not what the prophet said he said no
[1:11:49] matter how they treat me
[1:11:52] that won't have not anything to do with
[1:11:56] it
[1:11:56] because i still love them
[1:12:01] what is saying
[1:12:02] there without saying it
[1:12:05] is that that person talking to him like
[1:12:07] that and treating him like that
[1:12:10] they have to have a reason
[1:12:13] and we're going to take it from the low
[1:12:15] end it could be they're having a bad day
[1:12:19] i've come in cases where
[1:12:21] it end up with me having to pray with
[1:12:23] the person because then i find out from
[1:12:25] talking they had a problem at home
[1:12:28] before they came to work
[1:12:31] amen and they won't just go out and tell
[1:12:34] anybody like that
[1:12:35] but just god just made them treat me
[1:12:38] like that so i could be the one
[1:12:41] to
[1:12:42] under get that
[1:12:44] quietly
[1:12:46] pray about it and it stays right there
[1:12:49] oh praise god but we serve a living god
[1:12:52] a wise god he knows what he is doing so
[1:12:55] we place our lies in his hands and let
[1:12:58] him lead us and guide us
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:01] you know
[1:13:03] sometimes
[1:13:05] he says
[1:13:07] one time there was a man named moses
[1:13:11] and then people
[1:13:13] were constantly as in our southern
[1:13:16] expression you may say or aggravating
[1:13:19] him
[1:13:20] now but he in other words a nice way
[1:13:22] he's saying even the preachers go
[1:13:23] through that
[1:13:25] the preacher is there trying to preach
[1:13:27] the truth to them and then the very
[1:13:30] people that he's preaching to turn
[1:13:31] around and aggravating him why why are
[1:13:35] they how are they aggravating him
[1:13:37] every time they're with a murmur or with
[1:13:41] some complaint
[1:13:43] or something else hallelujah and when
[1:13:46] god said separate yourself from them
[1:13:48] moses i'm going to start a new nation
[1:13:52] moses threw himself in the path
[1:13:54] he says no lord take me not the people
[1:13:58] take me save them that was the spirit of
[1:14:01] christ in moses that's the spirit of
[1:14:04] christ that should be in us
[1:14:06] for the glory of god
[1:14:08] no matter how much someone would
[1:14:10] disagree with me
[1:14:12] if he doesn't feel the way that way then
[1:14:15] if a believer doesn't feel that way then
[1:14:18] they are lacking of christ
[1:14:22] see
[1:14:23] i was in a chicago meeting with a
[1:14:26] colored man that was sitting up there
[1:14:30] and he kept saying i want to see dr
[1:14:33] branham

[1:15:32] amen and if we love him let's call him
[1:15:36] brother as we do brother branham
[1:15:40] and gave me this title amen
[1:15:44] and he in respects did so i take a few
[1:15:47] lines to write on a paper all the titles
[1:15:51] and the names of that he had
[1:15:55] but all he had to call me was brother
[1:15:58] branham
[1:16:01] he told me that he was interested
[1:16:03] he was really interested in his church
[1:16:06] and the things of god
[1:16:08] and he's left something with me that i
[1:16:10] shall never forget

[1:16:55] always functioned that way because that
