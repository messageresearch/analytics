praise our God forevermore God bless you Saints thank you trusting in the Lord that's what we're doing here tonight amen we're trusting in the Lord we're trusting that the Lord is going to give us something that is going to encourage us and to give us the strength to keep pressing on to keep believing the word of God this is uh one of the greatest most amazing ages that's ever been experienced for the Sons and Daughters of God brother Branham talked about it thought that he was actually living in it at the time but boy if he you know I'm sure he's looking over the portal of time and and seeing what it is that's really taking place here now and how much has transpired since he left the scene you know as it was in the days of Sodom back in brother branham's day and you look at the condition today and you wonder wow it's becoming so common to the people it's just becoming very normal to be living in a world that is in my opinion and in most of the sons and daughters thoughts and hearts doesn't even make sense absolutely ridiculous that they've taken the word of God and placed it into such chaos amen praise God but we also know that that is the scripture that is the prophecy that is the time in the season that we're supposed to be living in amen praise God so God bless you we're here it's Tuesday night Bible study gives us an opportunity to allow the Holy Spirit to just unveil through the word of God things that are Upon Our Hearts to know the hour that we're living in and the season that we're living in amen and so we're going to be looking I'm starting a new series here that the Lord laid upon my heart on rapturing faith amen and so tonight we're just gonna sort of give the introduction to it and we're going to look at it and we know that rapturing faith is something that um you know we often think about we often wonder about the Rapture brother Branham said that the Rapture was a revelation and we know that Revelation is faith and we know that we're going to need some pretty Supernatural faith in order to change these bodies but yet if you just look at your own life and look at when God started with you you will see that there's a great change that's already started amen and that's all part of the revelation of the Rapture amen so let's read our scripture it's from Romans chapter 1 verses 16 and 17. amen let us pray before we go to the word father we just so appreciate this opportunity Lord to read your word and to invite you great Jehovah to come and Minister and discern and meet the needs of your children Lord through your word you bring Faith Faith cometh by hearing your word Lord and this is how you do it and so we're here ready for service Lord use the vessel speak every need in our midst tonight Lord anoint the hearts of your children to receive Lord me we just move so into Heavenly places now Lord may your great spirit come Lord and just Lift Every uh unbelief father Lift Every burden every concern of your people Lord many cares of this life father dealing with sickness dealing with uh Financial issues dealing with family problems Lord relationships all the things that that this life Lord seems to bombard upon the people Lord but tonight Lord just bring us into that Pavilion tonight Lord into that into your secret place father where all things are possible Lord where we can just receive that small portion that you have for each and every one of us tonight granted we pray bless our pastor bless the Saints bless them online father may your spirit move father discern every heart Lord You're The Same Spirit Lord you can move through there's no time there's no space there's no distance for you take control we pray in Jesus name amen praise God for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith now I want to read the Amplified version here I am not ashamed of the Gospel for it is the power of God for salvation for his wrath and Punishment to everyone who believes in Christ Our Savior as Savior to the Jew first and also to the Greek for in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed both springing from faith and leading to Faith disclosed in a way that awakens more faith as it is written and forever remains written the just and upright shall live by faith you may be seated amen praise God our next scripture is from The Book of Psalms 27 5. for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me He Shall Set me upon a rock Alleluia glory to God Amen so when we look at this scripture we're talking about rapturing faith and tonight we just want to start by looking at you know the aspects of faith and how it is that you know that that we first started I want you to know that from the day that you received God which is the message for your day the word of God for your day when when that happened there was an a portion of faith that was placed inside of you right there and then and that portion of faith was rapturing faith you might think oh well it was just you know God interceding in my life you know I was in a life of sin and I was you know not living right and and you know I needed God I was you know my marriage was falling apart my my my my job situation was terrible and I needed somebody to come and save me out of it you know because a lot of people that's the kind of interpretation that they put on your experience sometimes you know they want to say oh well yeah you know Danny you know I remember when when the Lord came into my life you know 30 almost 30 years ago and a lot of people said oh Danny's just you know going through something you know again you know like he's he's a pretty you know emotional kind of guy he can he can get pretty uh you know excited about things and we've seen him get excited about you know network marketing at times and we've seen him get excited about this opportunity and that opportunity and this is just another opportunity that Danny is involved with and you know you can put yourself there right and and just look at your own experience but that's not what it was it was because we were the seed of God elected to receive the word in this day you see when you look at the history of Christianity you will look back and all you've got to do is you know go back and look at the life of Jesus Christ and then look at those that were chosen around him these were simple regular individuals if Peter was a fisherman you know uh Mary Magdalene her life was just a complete mess okay she was so demon possessed from bad experiences and being abused and everything else you look at the lives you look at Matthew the tax collector you look at all of you know those that that were called in the time when Jesus was here on the earth and they were just ordinary people but you see something struck their heart that changed their lives I can see them you know when Jesus first you know walked up to them and introduced himself to them here was God the Living God the word made flesh and he's coming up to simple people but yet they were not just anybody they were elected and chosen and he knew them from before the foundations of the world just like he knew you he knew that you would be living in this age he knew that you would be the ones that would receive the word of God in your day and in your season and he knew that when he would come to you you would need him he knew you would need him he knew that that there was going to have to be something greater than just normal Faith because remember these individuals a lot of them were Jews they were living by the law they they were brought up according to the law but yet they were having experiences in life and going through situations and and things that that anybody can go through they were discouraged they would look at Mary Magdalene she wanted to probably kill herself over and over again but yet God knew that he had to go and call her look at the woman at the well her life was a complete disaster but God knew that it was time for him to go and call her and he also knew that it was going to take more than a rabbi more than some traditional teaching you needed more than just you know being being an altar boy at the Catholic church or or or being you know in the choir at your church and you know being brought into the church because your parents brought you into the church you need more than that you need it more than that to serve God in the capacity that you are serving him right now Jesus knew when he was coming into our lives that it wasn't just going to be ordinary faith that we were going to require in this day back in that day when Jesus came to the Earth the kind of faith that they were going to require was Faith to overcome the the the the humiliation of being a dozen people that were actually following the Messiah that would actually be the ones that were going to actually spearhead the Christian church he said to Peter one day when Peter was at his you know like if you get a chance you know we've been watching a series and it's available you can actually watch it now on Netflix it's called The Chosen and if you get a chance you might just want to watch you know season one I think that once you watch season one you'll probably want to continue to watch it but it's all about you know simple people at the time when Jesus came to the you know came to them in their lives and it's it's looking at their lives just like we're talking about your life here tonight you were just an ordinary person and yet these individuals were chosen of God and and they were the ones that he chose in that time and they were to go and spearhead the Christian Church they you know Peter like I was saying Peter was got into such a condition you know that he was so discouraged he thought his life was finished he owed so much money to the tax he was you know he was discouraged he couldn't you know provide for his family for his life financially things were just you know going really bad and and so here now Christ comes along gives him a boatload of fish allows him to you know to to move forward and now he says you're not you're no longer going to be a Fisher a fish you're going to be a fisher of men so he was going to need some sort of a faith in order to spearhead and be the first ones that would actually go out and bring Christ to the people that was a special kind of faith that was the faith that they needed in that day and then we can look and and we can come right up to you know where Luther broke away from the Catholic Church you know uh he needed a certain level of faith he's the one that actually caught that first you know understanding of the revelation of faith that it was something that you had to have yourself this is a personal experience and so he required a certain amount of Faith now to actually protest against the Catholic Church the most powerful religious organization on the earth in that day he needed a certain portion of faith he needed a faith to to deal with with great hierarchies and everything else but yet God gave them that Faith because God was now breaking away and bringing us to this day because it went from Luther then to Wesley Wesley had to receive a certain level of faith we're laying in a foundation here so that we can understand how important it is to understand the kind of faith that we are receiving and so here Wesley now receives faith to sanctify his life and then the Pentecostals receive faith in order to receive the gifts in order to allow the Holy Spirit to now start to manifest in a supernatural way in and through the people they required a certain level of faith in order to do that and then Here Comes brother Branham brother Branham a 20th century Prophet the one who God chose now to to actually change the dispensation to call out a people from all of the uh of the mess of of organized religion all over the world and you can see and we've experienced the kind of faith that God had to give brother Branham it was Supernatural faith it was signs and wonders like like the like the Earth had never seen before that was an amazing Faith because God had put upon his life such a call but he had the faith God gave him the faith he accomplished his goal he did what it was that was required of him in order to fulfill the word and to bring God's Plan of Redemption because this is what we are fulfilling the Plan of Redemption and so now when we're looking at the at the scripture here and we're seeing that that faith upon faith upon faith that God is increasing the the the the the the the portion of faith and the kind of faith that you received when this message came to you ten years ago 20 years ago it was actually rapturing faith that was coming to you because this is the age of the rapture it's not ordinary faith that you're actually receiving listen to brother Branham here now this quote really struck me and and I'm going to read it to you now tomorrow this is from Jehovah Jireh 1964. he says now tomorrow tomorrow at two o'clock tomorrow the entire service tomorrow afternoon is given over to the sick for prayer for the sick now many people refer to it as a healing service well we don't exactly like to refer to it like that because let's call it a faith service now you got to remember the time that brother Branham was living in and the word that was coming to brother Branham and what it was that his calling and his ministry was all about let's call it a faith so if our faith can come to that spot after him identified Among Us and know everything that's in our heart and has proved it to us see that he is alive and confirmed it by the scripture he's explaining to the people the kind of faith and he says here did you notice how he backed up Every Word by his living presence now if God is going to do something in your life that's going to give you rapturing faith it's going to need to be his living presence he's going to have to come to you personally a living presence of God in your life to transform you and to change you and to translate you from this Dimension into the other but not so much even that that's going to be amazing but you're going to need Faith to get to that you're going to need the kind of Faith to overcome the age that you're living in so that you can produce that portion of the word listen he says by his living present congregation says amen see see now that shows that you don't have to just think we're just trying to say something that's some kind of mystical something I'm not just speaking something mystical here I'm not here tonight as a minister to just you know speak things uh that you know just repeat what's said in the word repeat the prophet and tell you what the prophet said you need to put on your spiritual thinking here and recognize what it is that the holy spirit is actually revealing to us as individuals Sons and Daughters of God that are going to need rapturing Faith to change these bodies but you need to wreck you need to be aware we're going to be looking at certain things you're going to need to be aware of what it's going to take so that it places you under the right expectation he says here not some mystical something what this Bible has promised that's the truth see now every word is true now I may not have faith enough to make every word of it Act but I certainly wouldn't stand in the way of anybody that did have that faith you see he's he's coming on the scene in this day and in this hour he's making himself personally known to you as an individual you receive that Faith you're going to have to act upon that faith you're gonna have to say Amen to that faith when it comes into your life amen eat listen here Enoch had faith enough one day to take an afternoon stroll with God and just kept on walking God walked with Enoch Enoch knew that God was with him Noah was watching Enoch no one knew that Enoch was walking with God no one knew that something Supernatural Enoch knew the experience that he was having as an individual it wasn't something that he just belonged to a church a lot of people just come to church they just go to church on Wednesday they go to church on Sunday and they figure that's enough it's not this is a personal Supernatural walk with God so brother Branham is trying to bring the people to a level of understanding in preparation for a faith healing meeting the next day and he doesn't want to call it that he wants to call it faith he wants the people to enter into a level of Faith where they can receive the actual material change in their body if it's a healing that's needed you have that same access in this Dane in this hour by rapturing faith you do not have ordinary faith when you talk about faith from this day on I want you to think rapturing faith God has given me rapturing Faith to overcome my financial problems it's not normal faith It's Supernatural faith so and he kept on walking went up home without dying now I think the church has got to come to that to a rapturing faith he says I may not have that Faith just now but I sure wouldn't stand in the way of somebody that did have that faith I'm telling you Saints there's a people on Earth right now that have that kind of faith it's being revealed to them it's being unveiled to them and so this kind of faith is is is what I'm talking about here tonight this is the study that we're going to be looking at and that we're going to be moving into over these next few sessions as the Lord would provide amen and then we look at the scripture of Psalms 27 5. and it says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion brother Branham used this scripture when he preached the rapture and I want you to notice in the secret of his Tabernacle he's talking about the body of Christ he's talking about us being sealed in that there is a people in this hour that are being sealed in for the rapture they're being sealed into a supernatural body which is called the body of Christ it's not a church it's more than a church everybody goes to church everybody says I belong to a church we don't belong to a church we belong to a natural church but that natural church is the same as all the other natural churches out there but what differentiates us is the fact that we belong to the body of Christ it's a supernatural body that is now being prepared for a rapture remember everything that we read everything that we preach everything that we feed on is feeding the faith to bring us to the Rapture and to fulfill that final stage of the Rapture which is going to happen in the moment in the twinkling of an eye but it's all happening now rapturing Faith is already in you it's already listen he said he's going to come like a thief in the night he's already come like a thief in the night and he's stolen you out of the world he's already pulled you out of your conditions he's already delivered you from from from certain aspects of the world they had a hold of you they had control over your life but he came like a thief one night and he stole you he says I'll take one I'll leave the other Hallelujah you're you're you're you're you're you're one of the blessed that have been taken and placed into that Pavilion that secret place that Tabernacle where he's he's hid you you're you're already hidden in Christ you're already Justified there's nothing that you need to do in order to to fulfill the Rapture of the church the only thing you need to do is believe the word act upon the word speak the word speak the promises of God when the Devil comes in like a flood God will raise a standard and all you've got to do is say amen and and repeat the promises of God repeat what he said he would do for you he's hidden you in that secret place and he shall set you upon a what a rock oh let me tell you this is not some ordinary Rock this is rapturing revelation Rock this is a rock that's going to withstand Every Storm it's the kind of rock that whatever situation you think is going to try and take you you might think tonight oh I got to deal with this situation it's tax time I probably owe money to the government how am I going to deal with that I couldn't even get together enough to you know to to to pay my rent but thank God I paid my tithes oh Hallelujah praise God that's the first place you want to make sure you want to make sure that your investment into the kingdom of God is first everything else don't worry about it because you're standing on a rock you're standing on a Rapture Revelation Rock you're standing on rapturing faith Rock tonight you're not on just some some ordinary Rock oh I got faith it takes more than just the kind of faith that people quote unquote say I got faith no no you need rapturing faith in this hour that's the kind of Faith that's going to change you and give you the overcoming power to get through this age and so go to the next slide so our thought here tonight and this is only the introduction of course is we're going to be looking at the maturity in the bride you see you got to come to a place where you mature in your faith you know we talk about it all the time we read about it all the time but God wants us to be conscious God wants us to be conscious as adults we're not children anymore we're not feeding on just milk you know a lot of people they they get satisfied with just milk alone they get satisfied with just going to church you know maybe once every couple weeks or once you know uh you know no no you got to be feeding on the word of God all day long what do you mean brother Danny I you know I gotta go to work while you're at work you can feed on God's word David said you know I'll meditate on the Lord all day long you can meditate on God's promises all day long now I'm not talking about where you're where you're a fanatic but while you're working if you've got a job that requires a lot of physical strength then you need to think about God coming to his uh children that he where he says in your in your weakest moments I'm your strength I am your strength you need to think about when God anointed David who was just a just a a small runt you know that that he wasn't anything you know like like a great warrior he wasn't a great fighter he became one because of God's anointing in his life but when he had to go and face Goliath which was a giant in the land something came over him you know what it was it was faith it was the faith that God gave him that when a lion came in and tried to steal one of his sheep Supernatural strength came into his life that gave him the ability to just to to defeat that lion destroy the lion and get back his sheep and one day a bear came in and all those thoughts started to pour into David those were not just ordinary thoughts that was Supernatural faith God has given you that same kind of Faith so while you're at work if you require strength to overcome these Giants then you just have to say Lord you gave that kind of Faith to David you're the same yesterday today and forever I've got I've got a double portion of that now you're you've made available rapturing Faith David didn't didn't require his body to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye to be translated from this Dimension to the other because David was not facing the Great Tribulation that we that this Earth is going to face not us we go in the rapture that's why the message for this day is all around the rapture and so that's why rapturing faith is what he's giving us over and over again and so when you're so when now from from this day when you're thinking about the situations that you're facing I want you to know that you've been placed on on a supernatural Rock and the maturity level needs to increase now you need to start to get more serious with what you believe to become more consecrated unto the Lord on what he's revealed to you to to start moving in the Realms where God is looking for a mature woman a mature wife you know when a woman first starts out as a young woman she's Giddy and she has a lot of fun and she's thinking about this and thinking about the wedding and thinking about all the fun and all the traveling and you know all the good times that that that that you know that she's going to be approaching as she as she goes to that wedding uh supper thinking about the honeymoon and oh that that's all that's con the clothes that she's gonna wear how she's gonna pretty herself up make herself look better than all the other women and make sure that her husband notices her and and constantly you know uh having those thoughts but then she gets married then she becomes a wife then the husband has to go to work every day then the husband has to provide and the wife is there to support him to be his help mate to actually maybe take a job and work with him because now they're starting to build you know a future because now children are on the horizon they're thinking about children they start to mature you can watch that woman go through a complete change where she starts to take notice and she becomes much more mature in her attitude her attitude towards situations towards her husband things get serious sometimes Trials come from time to time and we have to overcome those trials and if we're not together with the husband and the wife if we're not if we're not you know pleasing to one another supporting one another feeding one another you you got to feed the holy spirit with your prayers and your and your and your praise and your and your desire to serve him as you walk with him and as you live that kind of a life it creates a a different kind of relationship between you and your husband because he's coming for a bride he's he's coming for a wife he's coming to manifest that that she is going to be an actual expression of him nothing pleases a husband more than when his wife is expressing his qualities good qualities the kind of character that pleases a husband when he sees his wife having you know a calm controlled attitude and nature God is looking for maturity not somebody that's just going to look at everybody else and and listen to everybody else's opinions a wife should not be listening to everybody else's opinions if you're a wife that's married to a holy ghost-filled Son of God then he is the priest and he is your lord he is Christ in your house he's the one that God has chosen to speak your needs and to speak the family needs and to and to provide and and nothing should you know like nothing should should come between that when a husband and wife have a a real you know conscious pure revelation of God in their lives because it's not man that we are that that we are responsible to it's God that we are responsible to and when a woman understands that and a man understands that then a man is going to treat his wife the same way that Christ loves and treats the church a husband should never be putting down his wife never a husband should always be encouraging and and lifting them up and and and if they have weaknesses they should be they they should be turned into something like like like reversed into strength you know encourage and and and and lift up and and that's what he's doing for us he's encouraging us he's not here to beat us up this is not that listen just before a man is going to take his wife to the Altar and marry her he's not gonna he's not gonna treat her like garbage he's looking to treat her like the most important most special person in the world and that's the kind of relationship that Christ wants to enter into through this age that we're living in right now he wants that kind of a relationship with us and it's going to require that we understand what's required of us and to be mature mature Sons and Daughters of God brother Branham now as we enter into this we want to look at the five musts and we want to understand it as we as we look through it brother Branham you can bring up the next slide it's from the message trying to do God a service without being the will of God and one of the things that we must understand if we're to be mature Sons and Daughters of God in this day and in this hour we need to understand what God is expecting from us we need to understand these things so let's look at the first one brother Brown speaking here he says but these five musts I want you to remember these no matter how sincere A man may be in doing it and be in doing it doing God a service these this these five must be there pay attention first it must be his time to do it now you see how important it is to recognize your day and its message you need to know what God is doing in this day God is not trying to preach only sanctification or preach only gifts if you don't got gifts and if gifts are not showing up in your life then the holy spirit is not upon your life you need to recognize that it's his time to do what what is it that he's going to achieve in this day for you and me the rapture let's get focused this is the rapture age this is the time listen there's there's another Thousand Years after the Rapture by the way hello okay time shall be no more for you as a son and daughter of God because this Rapture puts you into your theophany you need to know his time to do it it's his time to do and to change and to take this bride out of this dimension what if Moses would come say well we'll build an ark and float up the Nile like Noah did Noah's time was all right for for an ark but not his time it's not the time for Noah it's not the time for there's going to be great floods and there's going to be a Great Tribulation that's going to strike the Earth and this Earth is going to be in total chaos but you need to understand where your part is in all of that you don't go into that chaos you do not go into the tribulation you are receiving rapturing faith for a body change in order to be translated from this dimension to the dimension of the redeemed let's continue what if Jesus would come said now I'll tell you what will do we'll just go up on the mount like Moses did and get a new Declaration of laws see ah he was that law see it's not the time to be hammering the people with the law a lot of people when they preach you know you know you go into different churches and it's just law this and you got to do this and you gotta wear your skirts long they got to be measured you know you make sure the deacons you know okay in your length of the skirt and you know all these laws and you can't do this and you can't do that this is not the age for that this is the rapture age you must be in his time in his time he says in his time he makes all things beautiful you must be in his time for for for the rapture the word that's being expressed right now whatever it is like like I said what we feed on what we hear what we read what we Fellowship about when we come into the house of the Lord I don't know about you but when I come into the house of the Lord on Wednesday and Sunday I'm listening for something that is going to give me Supernatural faith I'm listening for another line upon line because precept upon precept he's given me the overcoming power and he's given me the confidence to continue to serve him every single day I'm more excited about the word of God today than I've ever been why because he's a living God his presence is Vindicated in our midst through the discernment of the word through Supernatural events that are happening around my life people don't have to be raised from the dead for me to be convinced that God is God when I see somebody receive a revelation and live that Revelation that is being brought from the dead when an individual can receive this message which is very far and few between that is more Supernatural than anything else to a son or daughter of God and a pastor of the church he's looking for that he's looking for for God to add to the church not just people God's looking for rainbow trout God is God is looking for individuals that are going to be filled with Revelation when a pastor is leading a church he's looking for people that are going to be filled with Revelation to live and to and to and to perform in the position that God is going to place them in because when they get placed into that position by Revelation that's rapturing Faith being expressed in their lives it takes Supernatural Faith we're living in a time where people are falling away they're falling away from God they're they're not serious about this message like they were maybe when they first came in why what's going on but the scripture said that there would be a falling away people would would but it's not so much that they're falling away it's that the word is progressing and moving on the revelation of the Rapture is getting stronger and stronger God is shaking the church like we heard here on Sunday why is he shaking the church because that which will be shaken will be shaken but that which will remain is the Sons and Daughters of God that are going to produce the body change they're going to produce the rapture they're going to produce an overpower an overcoming life they're going to produce fruit for the kingdom of God verse 114. well first you must be in his time it must be in his season you got that now must be in his time it must be in his season time and season we are in the season of The Rapture that's the season that we're in when people when listen when I talk to people out there and they they call themselves Christians you know eventually I'm going to get to the place where I'm gonna say so so you know praise God you know the world's going like because you know a lot of people they'll talk about the chaos they'll talk about the sodomite conditions they'll talk about you know things that are happening in the world where where you know Financial situations are taking place now and they'll talk about the mark of the beast and you won't be able to buy or sell and this and that and I say well thank God praise God for the rapture yeah they if if if they had a Rapture Revelation in them they're going to respond they're going to say Amen brother in the twinkling of an eye we're going to be changed Hallelujah because if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it's gonna Quicken your mortal Hallelujah you see that's the Deep call to the Deep that's that's a response that you want to hear and then you want to talk about God you know giving rapturing faith in this hour the kind of faith that we're going to need because you know the just shall live by faith but what kind of Faith do you have do you have the faith to overcome he says yes I do I'm just like the Son of God Jesus Christ so you believe in the trinity well yeah there's the father there's the son and then there's the Holy Spirit which is the power of God nope deep called to the Deep an attribute of God can never Place God into three it can't happen it's not in the here ye Israel the Lord thy God is one Philip stood right in front of her right in front of Jesus and he said Lord show us the Father and Jesus looked at him he says Philip have I not been with you so long if you see me you see the father one not two not three you see but without that kind of faith without the attribute of God because listen let's just face it we were just like anybody else and we are just like anybody else in this don't you try to tell me oh no I I can do this and I can do that and yeah you can go you can can you go without sleep for 48 hours are you that super being that you're already in your theophany no but there's something in you called the attribute of God and that can never ever disbelieve the word of God when you've got a revelation of that and you know that you are an attribute of God an expression of God and how do you know that you are because you will recognize your word for the day you will recognize God sent the prophet you will recognize the hour the day the season the time and what God is requiring for us to fulfill in this day and in this hour verse 114 and it must be according to his word that has been spoken God sent us a prophet for that very purpose because God does nothing unless he first reveals it unto his servants the prophets and so we got to recognize that we've received his word through a Vindicated prophet and that word has been so Vindicated in you personally you've become one with that word you know I mean there's so much we could get into here about about receiving a profit but it's absolutely necessary for the world to know that God sent a 20th century Prophet by the name of William Miriam Branham to fulfill scripture that would bring us to where we are today we're going to be looking at all of that through this whole rapturing Faith series I've been studying over the last couple weeks and there's been so much that that that that's there and so much that that the Lord is just pouring out all kinds of uh quotes and scripture and inspiration and vindicating here and there about what it is that that that's in this message that I've been so blessed but then two days no yesterday the Lord said whoa settle down son this is you know you you got it you gotta put this into the right perspective you got to lay in a foundation you got to let the simple people this word has got to be so simple that the youngest children in the house need to be able to recognize what God is doing that God is giving them faith to receive this word and receive this message it needs to be simple it needs to be brought in a way where people can recognize and those that are listening in and and and you know that are in other denomination and people that you that you testify to you can't just walk up to them and tell them Hey listen you know what God sent a prophet if you haven't heard that you're going to hell because he came to call out of people and that's all there's to it no that's not all that's to it there's a lot of people that will quote that and a lot of people are saying oh if you don't believe God sent a prophet and you don't believe exactly what the prophet said and only what the prophet said then you're not going anywhere no sir this what brother Branham was talking about when he was saying we're going to have a faith meeting and people are going to recognize his Supernatural presence and they will be healed because God will so reveal the faith to them that they're healed that they will be healed God reveals to you as God reveals to you this rapturing faith the Rapture will become so real to you that you will be expecting it around you constantly that it could happen at any moment because God is so real God is not some mummy and daddy tells me about about God no that's not what this is about oh brother Simon Beacon preach the word of God he can put those quotes together so perfect that that must be the church where the Rapture is going to be I got to make sure I'm there every Sunday when Pastor Simon preaches because then I'll be sure to be in the rapture God don't have any grandchildren God only has Sons and Daughters of God that are going to fulfill this word because of him in them they will he says on that day he shall know that I am in the father ye and me and I in you so just think back of when you came to the Lord what was the thing that that stirred upon your heart I remember I remember when I was listening to Pastor Simon preaching and he was talking about the Holy Ghost he said that spirit of God he the Holy Ghost this the holy ghost that and I said I need the Holy Ghost and God gave me the Holy Ghost when he allowed me to see this message God told me I had the Holy Ghost because I could see them I remember when I went to Pastor Simon I said pastor Simon I want the Holy Ghost and I remember him looking and he said to me he says brother you got the Holy Ghost I said yeah I said but I want to be baptized you see that is the element that we need to recognize that this is not something that just started this is something that God is doing this is not a future event this is a now event so it must be according to his word that's been spoken it must I don't care how well you say this ought to be or that ought to be or this ought to be it's got to be according to his word according to his time and his season and it must be given according to the person he has chosen to do it by now a lot of people they recognize that God sent a prophet when brother Branham was on the scene and they were the bride they were the called out they were the chosen of that day they recognized that God had sent a prophet they realized brother Branham was Malachi 4 they realized that he was Revelations 10 7. they saw and they recognize that he was the one that God had chosen to bring that portion of the word by but what God was doing in the days of when brother Branham was here was that he was calling out a church from Pentecost he was calling out a church out of laodicea he was not calling for the Rapture at that time he was calling for a church to come out of the denominational laodocian Church age and those that recognized the season of brother Branham they recognized the season of what brother branham's part was in the word of God that he was not the mighty angel there was two angels in Revelations 10. there was the mighty Angel which was Jesus Christ standing on the earth and on the land and on the sea and said that time shall be no more but then there was an Earthly angel that had to be on the earth at that particular time when the Seven Seals were going to be revealed we're going to be looking at all of this and breaking it down and and seeing how important it was for these events to have taken place but brother Branham was the one that God had chosen at that time it's always been God next you must be in his time you know when I read that it kind of stepped out of the page and I came to realize yeah recognizing that that now you can take this how you want but the word is compounded and when I read that it spoke to me you must be in that time you must be in that in that in that season you must be conscious of yourself in the word of God that you are in that season of the word to be fulfilled that the Rapture is going to take place and that you are the you are accounted as one of those that's going to be in the rapture it must be in his season you got you got that now must be in his time must be in his season time and season and it must be according to his word that has been spoken okay it must it must I don't care how well you you say this ought to be so we don't want our own interpretation and he has chosen and and the person he has chosen let's go to the next slide sorry I don't care how much dignitaries there is a King David just as great as any of them he was King over the nation but he had a way of doing it and he had told them how he would do it but they failed to do it they were told how they were to do everything in the in the days of David that you know with the ark and everything that they were told to do but it must be according to his word not man's interpretation of the word to his time according to his program next and it must be by the person he has chosen to give it and to do it Moses tried to run from it take somebody else but God chose Moses to do it many of them Paul tried to get out of it many others but it got to it's got to be by the one he chooses to do it and it must come first to His prophets the word of God must come to His prophets and we know that brother Branham was our prophet but listen carefully here the word of God must come to His prophets Amos 3 7 the Lord God will do nothing until he first reveals it unto his servant the prophet four and the prophet must be Vindicated by the word of God there is your five musts they need to be Vindicated now it's got to be that way his time his season when he said it would be and the man that he chose and it must come to the prophet and the prophet must be a Vindicated Prophet we find out many of them in the Bible it come to the prophets and it wasn't Vindicated our Prophet is Jesus Christ let the musicians come we need to recognize that God is looking for maturity he's looking for us to come to a place where we will recognize what is required the time the season how he's bringing his word as we continue here we're going to be moving forward into the season that we're not in the season of William Miriam Branham anymore we are no longer in the laodicean church age spiritually we are from a physical standpoint it's laodicea all around us but we have transitioned into another age next slide and this is what we're going to be looking at in part two fruit cannot ripen unless the sun ripens it we need to know what is going to be required in order for us to have the rapturing faith to be translated it's not something that you're going to be taught oh brother Denny's going to teach us how to go in the Rapture no nobody can teach anybody how to go in the rapture but what we're going to recognize as we go through this series is that you need to be in the right atmosphere you need to be in the right expectation you need to see yourself in the right dispensation the time that we're living in and what it is that God is looking to do no matter how much you preach whatever you do it cannot be ripened it cannot be manifested it cannot be Vindicated only by him who said I am the light of the world the word so there has to come forth a power the Holy Spirit himself to ripen or to vindicate or to prove or to make manifested that what he predicted would happen in this day I'm not talking about brother branham's day yes he spoke that quote but all there's a lot here we're going to be looking at a lot that brother Branham listen it was the voice of God God was speaking through the angel it would when when brother Branham said thus saith the Lord it was not brother Branham saying that it was God speaking we need to realize that it's going to take that Supernatural element that's going to bring us into that rapturing Faith condition and realize that we are being translated we're being changed word upon word line upon line precept upon precept the evening light produces that we are in the evening time this is the time where the where where we're being called out this is evening time evangelism we need to have the right message we need to be able to communicate the right message to to when when we testify when we tell the people about the spirit of God what God is doing in this hour we need to be mature Sons and Daughters of God and so we're going to be looking at these things I've got some quotes here I'm not going to read them now but it talks about how we've moved from the little decision age and that we are now in the bright age and we are in an eternal Church age praise God may the Lord bless you may it cause you to go search and and Ponder on these thoughts I don't got ordinary faith say it I don't have ordinary faith I have rapturing faith it's going to change us it's going to transform us it's going to change the conditions around my life I'm not going to remain I'm not going to get caught into the situations of this world I'm not going to be pulled into the tribulation too many people are are looking at the tribulation and and the way they're they're looking into it and and trying to understand it and everything else you know they they want to store up food they want to do this they want to put cash away they want to you know all these things because they're preparing for the tribulation no we're we're preparing in a different way praise God let's pray father thank you tonight Lord for these thoughts simple as they are Lord [Music] I know that you're doing something wonderful in a personal Supernatural way with each and every one of us you're bringing us into that place of maturity father as your wife now not a bride that's all excited about you know this that but but a bride wife that's starting to recognize what's required how to please you how to recognize what you're doing Lord bless each and every one of us father and let these thoughts go and may they Ponder upon our hearts Lord and may we may we overcome by the testimony of our mouths oh God that we have rapturing faith in us now grant that father we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] surely change [Music] is stronger of my soul today [Music] Rapture in Bridge to be
