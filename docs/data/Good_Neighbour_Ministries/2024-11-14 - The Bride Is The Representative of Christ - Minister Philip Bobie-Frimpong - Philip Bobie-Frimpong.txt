if you have done anything wrong father we didn't mean it please um without you here it will just be worse so you invite your presence that you come and speak to your children because Lord I have nothing to give unless you take control and bless your ch we asking and we have confidence that Lord you always show up so we believe that we show up tonight to bless your children in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen ah praise God I have something I was so fully prepared and last me change on me so I don't know I haven't really prepared this 100% but just for give me half things all over the place I hope it blesses you um if I'm going to title it's going to be the brightest representative of Christ my uh scripture will be taken from Acts chapter 4 verse 13- 22 now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus we're going to stress on that most of the time and beholding the man which was he standing with them they could say nothing against it because they have they saw the testimony themselves and the person was there so you can't deny that amen yeah and behold the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council and confir among themselves saying what shall we do this men for that indeed a notable Miracle had been done by them is Manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot deny it but that is spread no further among the people let us stly threaten them that they speak hence forth to no man in this name and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus but Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of God to Heen unto you more than God judge ye for we cannot be speak the things which we have seen and heard so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorify God for that which was done for the man was about 40 years old on whom this miracle of healing was showed Heavenly Father please bless the reading of your word in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen please be seated so um my title is the bride is representative of Christ okay but if the background before this happened Peter and John they were they didn't have that boldness that they have back then before that because um the Christ was not crucified yet because the Holy Ghost was not giv even though Peter did so many things but they were still not um I they were not um I forgot the exact word that the scripture used but they have all that they were not converted if my scripture is right so they did before then they were scared but when Christ died on Calvary he gave up the ghost so when they put that on his side what came was his spirit so that Spirit became available on the day of Pentecost and only 120 went there to receive it so after they received the Holy Ghost then they went with boldness and they demonstrate to the people the power of Christ they were not scared again Peter who denied him and all those things wasn't scared and what make it more relevant that the people had recognized that they had been with what the Lord Jesus Christ so the emphasiz is that as we are moving among the people Christ that we profess that he lives inside of us has to be visible to the People by our actions people have to see Christ in us that's why he read he spoke over here um he said that it I think it influenced 1963 1130b and if we take the testimony of being Christians I think that that is one of the most solemn things that a man or a woman boy or girl could do world when he takes on the name of Christ that he's going to be a representative of Christ we should watch every move you make because somebody is watching you and in this it reflects God what what God has done for you inside of you so what has taken place inside of you will automatically reflect outside so it's not how much the knowledge you have about the message is good the knowledge is good but it has to be revealed to you and that knowledge without works is nothing so if you know all the Mysteries and your life doesn't match up to what you are talking about what profit doesn't profit the people because the people want to see actions they want to see the reality of what you are talking about they are fed up with w w are cheap but they want to see the chist that you are professing inside of you remember all those mamad Dan and know they can do signs and wers all over but the difference is when Christ is in you it will conquer all of them one will chase it they will see like Elijah he told those people they do all those things that they did but one action from Elijah consume like Moses when he met pharaoh and his those jambes and those they tried to do all everything and the trick but everything they did because Moses had the true one his s his name consumed this so God has to prove that he's behind you and your testimony have to be real people have to testify and see that you have been with Jesus because if you read the whole scriptures when that miracle was done 5,000 people believe Christ amen am so you don't even need adver advertisement one thing major thing from God will bring the people when that thing was done it said 5,000 people believed on the Lord Jesus Christ so he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed and he's still doing the same thing so if he did that through Peter why can't you do that through you and me if it's the same yesterday today and because God hasn't changed what he did back then he'll do it in you and in me he's the same God God hasn't changed his word hasn't changed and the word of God will defeat the Devil at any place anywhere at any point if you take God at his word and apply it with Revelation behind it not just the words because people can even quot it better than you and me but the difference is is it revealed to you if it's revealed it makes a difference because God revealed to Abel how to make the sacrifice and when that was revealed God himself testify of it Cain brought a very beautiful sacrifice but God rejected it because it wasn't done by Revelation the Bible say anything done without faith it's sin and faith is a revelation so even your offering everything has to be done with faith and when Abraham believed God the Bible said that everything that Abraham bought with money that was his servant whatever he circumcised all of them that means that when God bless you with your money and anything that you doing you have to take God into account that it was wasn't just by you your power your might but God has blessed you so you have to what use it for his glory and honor am that's the god that we are serving he's the Living God Amen and God that created heaven and earth he's still here today he hasn't changed he sent us a Vindicated Prophet type of Abraham sending a laser to look for right for him and that is natural tying spiritual and when you read the Bible in Genesis chapter Genesis 20 24:7 Abraham told elar because when it was time for elizar to go and look for the bride elazar was scared and he was doubting and he told him that um in verse 5 and the servant s him per Adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me into this land must I need bring thy son again unto the land from when thou comest and Abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son th again verse seven the Lord God of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spoke unto me and th swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shall take a wife unto my son from thanks because Abraham has confidence in God of what God has done to him in the past he remembered God that took him from his Kindred from his parents from all those things has led him th far if God has led you this far what do you have need of tonight what are you scared of Abraham was not scared of anything because he has confidence that if God could bring him from the his Kindred land from all over the place and even his only son that God promised him to what H that through him he going to bless him and take and possess all the land when the time came Abraham have confidence to sacrifice that sign because you have confidence that God that gave the child to him would somebody who was dead in um the like the wife was dead in his in her womb the wife could not they were of Shing of old he has confidence that God that gave them as someone who were said was able to raise Isaac up and he saw all those testimony of God providing himself his own sacrifice so with all those testimonies in his belt with that experience you think he was going to be worried about um telling him to go and find a wife a wife for his son no he wasn't worried so it's a true Christian of Christ because you cannot um you cannot leave you cannot have that faith without having a testimony behind your faith has to have a testimony you have to have something to stand on it has to be revealed to you but if you say you're a Christian then God somewhere along the line must have revealed something to you in the past something in your past that you have seen God has done to for you if you could go back and see what the Lord has done for you in the past then when you are facing tomorrow no matter how dark that tomorrow may be your confidence should be in that God and I know that that God will bring you out because he brought you out in the past he will do it again and again and again and I'm afraid if you don't have that confidence if you have not met God for yourself if you have not seen him if he has not seen him for yourself or you have don't have any TI post when the enemy comes to you it's going to be a trouble on you it's going to be hard I'm not saying that you going to fight the battle yourself but if God is in you has done something in the past for you it will give you confidence to tell the devil that shut up Satan I'm not yours I'm a son of the Living God brah said that when the enemy comes to him and tell him all those things then he will s us okay what about this what about that Satan what about this that did go God did for what about this what about that what about that so that he ran away because why he has a tle he has a testimony so what God does that he reveal himself to us in the past and do those things to us so that when the time comes to face the enemy you can remember what God has done for you like Samson when he got to a place that he was blind and they were carrying him and he had has done wrong and everything but Abraham said that when they were tied him and everything he was thinking what God has done for him thinking about how God used him with a Jawbone to kill like thousand of those Philistines and all those major things that God he was thinking and then he repented said once more let me die with my enemies because he has God been with Jesus before he has seen that testimony and I believe that elazar also was um was influenced by the faith of his master so when he got to the place to look for the bride he didn't go by himself he prayed so prayer will bring God anointing down amen and the the main thing is if your motive is right and your objective is right God is under obligation to answer you you can say to this mountain be th removed if you not doubt in your heart believe what you have said it will come to pass it's not you just going say I want this I speak this I speak that that will not work but when the deity Christ in you spoke through you it will come to pass because the date is speaking through you am and you are Christ Christ you are representative of Christ so with that day is in new speaking it will come to pass that makes a difference so elazar prayed and he saw the answer of his prayer right there he saw the manifestation Rebecca came and do exactly the sign he asked of God but the thing is after all those things were done they wanted to hold her a little back and she has to make her own decision so is the bride of Christ every one of us there are times in our life we be confronted we be forced to make a decision and El laser Rebecca when she was asked she said she will go with elaser I believe that Ruth and opa was also confronted with the same situation they were forced to make a decision and Opa like the noral Christian he wasn't willing to go all the way she wasn't willing to go all the way she went a halfway and when um Naomi presented the thing to her to look so bad to look so awkward to look that there's no hope for her to follow her she just bow down to the pressure but God doesn't want us to bow down to the pressure a true Christian you have to go all the way no matter what comes our way our life is in his hands he's able to lead us through doesn't matter what how it looks outward how it looks dark Ruth didn't worry about that she said your God will be my God your people will be my people when you die I will also die why because he has caught revelation she realized that there's something about Nomi she have that Revelation that when she follow her even though it's going to be tough but God will be with her so is the bride of Christ no matter what we are going through no matter how sometimes you see the road is that move forward amen s not everything that God will tell you but by faith step forward don't stay in your comfort zone step forward step on the word of God and it will come to pass Hallelujah so what is happening is that um braam talk about in the where Pentecost field and so many other places it just strike me only last week or two he's saying that what God revealed to Luther was 100% truth what God revealed to Methodist Wesley 100% truth to the Pentecostals 100% truth but the problem the trouble of it is when God reveal it to them they stay put over what God has revealed to them and put a hedge around them that this is what God has done they don't want nothing more but he said if they could have accepted what had God God has revealed to them and believe what he was going to continue to reveal it will have lead them to a better place but they just say God has revealed this and that's it but said if you could they could have recognized what God has done and what God was going to to reveal in the future and they were willing to accept what he was going to reveal in the future it will have been different and I'm afraid exact same thing is happening to some of the message Believers because God sent us a Vindicated Prophet his name is William myON Bram it has never happen on the face of this Earth how God used him people without an ball could get an eyeball people without even a food could get a food and he could design and see what you have done it wasn't him it was God using his prophet and it's never happened before and he God used him as the the what do you call the highest point of using anyone but the problem is all that God did through him is 100% true that said the Lord I believe with all my heart and ref feed on that word of God just like elazar finding Bride for Christ so God sent the prophet William Bram to find a spiritual bride for Christ amen and when if you read back elizar when elizar took Rebecca to Isaac it was a love affair between Rebecca and Isaac amen so what I'm trying to say that God sent us a Vindicated Prophet with that say the Lord and without the prophet none of the four five will have a message the serpent did everything God used him mightly what happened was that when God used him to that High Point like that just like the Lord Jesus Christ Ministry the first portion was the healing and second second pool was designing the heart of the people Jesus Christ Ministry the second pool was rebuking the fares and the sedu and when he was started rebuking them they didn't want nothing to do with him he said that um the son of man said that except eat of my My Flesh and drink of my blood you have no part in me they they walk away with him no more so is the prophet when he began to preach that the woman should not preach um the serpent marriage and divorce all those scriptures e going on the Pentecostal they not have to do with him again but God crowned him with a revealing of the seals when the people departed from him that was when God was was crowning his ministry but the point I'm trying to make is that he said I my inrease Christ must increase so God revealed all the truth God did all these things we we we we we love him we we Reverend everything he said but the the thing is mov moving on because God took him off the scene but he never took his spirit that same spirit is here A type Elijah in Elisha three si three pH of Elijah meeting um before Elisha before Elijah went there were three stages and the last stage was what when he gave him his mant he said that I want a double portion of your spirit and when Elijah took that mantle he cried and said where is the god of Elijah amen so we are not calling for Willam Braham to come back but we calling on the god of julam mar Braham to come and on the scene amen that's the God that you are serving the same God that was in the prophet that's the God we are calling on the SE just like Elijah said where is the god of Elijah amen he said and you give if you see me go it's hard if you see me go he put that where is the god of Elijah and then he got a double portion of his spirit so is Christ said that that um The Works that I do shall you also greater than this shall you do also double portion the bride that same God that was in the prophet is the bride now it's in the bride what doing exact same thing in a many member body he didn't die the spirit of God not die with the prophet that same spirit is here tonight that whatever you have need of if thou can believe I challenge you you can have it if you have confidence in the word of God that William Braham God is here the god of Elijah is here tonight to answer all your need if you sick he said by his stripes I was healed that was way done way back on 2,000 years ago you can accept your healing right now no matter what you are going through this is done on 2,000 years ago if Jesus was to be here he cannot even heal you because he's done it already it's done finished done capito is done already this is that deal it's up to you to what accept it and believe it and testify of it because we don't have to wait to see it before we testify that woman whose son was dead amen the prophet asked her is all well with you she said all is well even though her son was dead she didn't look at the death of her son she has confidence that Prophet that God used him to let her has that baby she was a baren she never asked for a son and if God could through that Prophet let her have a son even though that that son is there that same God of that Prophet is able to bring her son back to life so when they asked her is all well with you with your side she said all is well that's the confidence we have you have to have all the time the god that has brought us all this F that reveal himself to us deliver some of us from alcohol smoke and all human all that kind of spirit that God that deliver you would't he able to heal you tonight what he has done for you in the past he's the same yesterday today and forever don't let any situation look hard because the problem of faith is when you look and a situation and you analyze with only what your eyes see you're going to get in trouble I believe that's what happened to the children of Israel the 10 spies they went to spy the land they saw the graves and the wines and everything and they saw the Giants of the people so they look at the Giants Too Tall and they look at them they like grass purose to them so their eyes they came to give an evil report because all that God did for them in Egypt he opened the Red Sea for them to pass through send them Mana to eat all these Miracles and they still doubted God about his promise and Joshua and Caleb they never believe or accept what their eyes was seeing by faith they have confidence that God is able to deliver them and give those people to them as they as God open the r seat to them those people are nothing to them because their God is more than able to defeat those enemies so Joshua and Caleb never doubted they still the how the people's heart be still and know that our God is God don't look at your eyes only what your eyes are seen look to the promise of God look to God's word and believe that every promise in that book it's your it's mine no matter what the circumstances may seem to appear God's word is Tru God Hest his word God keeps his word amen that word will come to pass regardless of whatever condition that you may find yourself inside in so those children of Israel they Rebel and God was going to destroy all of them but Moses even though the people were wrong as wrong can be Moses interceded that's the spirit of Christ in Moses and said God destroy me before you destroy the people so what am I saying the people out there might be wrong as strong could be Abraham the Sodom and gomorra their life was worse as worse could be but Abraham pleaded for them so the Mery seat is in the bright now it's you and me don't look at the condition of the people just speak for them just plead for them cry for them there might be one there that might be God's son no one that Steven couldn't even um do anything because after he was being stoned he said father forgive them they didn't know what they are doing and Paul was standing there and Paul that God used to replace because remember when Judas betrayed God and they have to replace him the people voted they vote for Matas but the B say he didn't do nothing but Paul was a murderer when have anger and everything but that was God's choice amen so stepen couldn't say anything that will Hur Paul but the spirit of compassion Spirit of Christ in steeven he said father forgive them don't hold anything against them so that same Spirit of Christ is in the bride and if it's in the bride what does it do it call for Mercy Mercy Mercy the people are wrong as wrong can be one time the prophet me somebody and his and his girlfriend was going to make a love and the spirit asked him say whatever you want and he said in the name of Jesus let them repent they repent and make things right so I'm not condoning sin but all I'm saying is that with the spirit of Christ it always what intercede for the people for your children no matter how you see them do wrong we have the power of God to change things don't look at what they are doing see what the words I used to them because whatever you speak will come to pass amen so we have to watch our way people around us they might be wrong as wrong can be even on our work people do certain things very bad but let's pray for them because God can turn them around and they can be good friends to you on the job side don't just fight on every little thing just have compassion on them amen they don't know what they are doing amen sometimes even God allowed them to test you to test your patient to try your patient to see your reaction amen one time the prophet of God saw somebody at the bar doing all kind of stuff he was so angry he said how can you allow this to live wipe it wipe her out from the face of the Earth and God brought him back and saw what God has been doing for him and he oh God thank you for your blood for covering my sin for your blood covering my sin but said you want me to kill I forgive you want me to wipe her on the face of this Earth so we must have compassion on the people don't be quick to judge I'm not saying that we condone sin but don't be quick to judge let God lead you let him direct you and know who when to be a lion and when to be a lamb there has to be a balance in everything that we are doing but it's the Life of Christ when that Life of Christ project you it gives life to the people it give grace to the people you are representative of Christ tonight whatever you said will come to pass in my name shall cast out Devils when you lay your hands on the S they shall recover he said that the works that I do shall you also there will be I said I'll be with you even in you until what the consumation of time he's the same yesterday today and forever amen Our God hasn't changed hallelujah our God is good all the time he's God that never lose a battle he's a he's a physician that never lost a never lost a patient and he is all Al um he's a lawyer that never lose a case he's the same yesterday today and forever amen so what am I trying to say it was a love affair between Rebecca and Isaac so now is a love affair between the bride of Christ and the groom yes the spirit and the bride will say exact same thing he here Elijah God is here amen hallelujah God has in change he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah hallelujah amen praise God thank you Jesus amen so what am I trying to say when those people was strong as strong can be Moses interceded for them and Joshua and Caleb they to by God's word and they stand by that and what is it is that we have to be sure of our decision making because decisions are very very vital amen and every that we make we going to what rip out of it and bad or good you you are where you are today based on decision you made about four five years ago and that same God is here God that was in elazar that that led elizar to find Rebeca has led the prophet to find this so what am I trying to say um here in the sign of this time bra said that that I made a point that where Pentecost F where the um the Luther and all the RO because they made um what they said God has revealed this to us that's it they didn't move forward from what God has said that if they could have accept every more what God would have do have been different and here he said that and now we have left Pentecostal age now we are coming coming to where like in the pyramid not the pyramid doctrines now but I mean like as the pyramid The Headstone when it comes to Faith is got to be whole there's got to be a Ministry in the church the True Church of the Living God to where when The Headstone comes Christ or the ministry of Christ and Christ will fit right in together perfectly then that brings back the redeemed to take the whole house of God to Glory the Methodist the Baptist and Presbyterian through the great Reformation ages that come out and gave their life in persecution and thanks for the kingdom of God but that Stone is coming yes sir it certainly will come God will send it it will fit all the building together upon it see now we see these signs as you see the ministry from Christ beginning to narrow up now to complete the ministry of Christ in the fullness of the holy spirit amen so what is trying to say that it becomes narrow when it gets The Headstone is no more a man remember all the seals he preached this six when it came the seven seal he didn't there's nothing to talk about it so it's no more man is God himself that will take you the cstone nobody can take you there to that pyramid and is God alone that will take you there and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ a man cannot take you there he going to come and Whisper to you like the way he whisper to H and all those people and and and eser in their ears God has to whisper God has to bring you that nobody can take you to the top of the pyramid it's God himself it's no man and mind Ministry he has left from the seventh age to the eighth age Eternal Church age Christ himself the hope of glory in the a leading his people the son of man being revealed again in the bright form amen hallelujah that same year remember the last time he did to Sodom before Sodom was destroyed he reveal himself to Abraham yes he did he did and if that thing has happened God and the world is in Sodom that we never seen sodomy people coming out from their closet right until when lot when those two angels went there and they came out open and if you see all those things happen you have know that your Redemption was drawing nearer it's there n now because the time is short very soon is coming for his bride amen it won't be long people are saying that oh this President will come and going to have Christ in America I I said listen you don't you cannot do America has rejected God already and this things nobody can fight it it's a part of Prophecy to fulfill so that you can go home we don't condone it we don't like it we speak against it but we can't fight it right because the prophet that has to be fulfilled that is fulfilling amen so all that you have to that God is revealing himself to us the people out there are condoning that and doing but we Christ is revealing himself more and more and more to his children amen because remember when that sign happened Sarah God has to change her I know you know about it God change her to be a young lady to receive the promise because she couldn't have had a to go to labor to get to give birth to Isaac God has to change her mil vein change everything that's why she the the the king fell in love with her she wasn't an old lady again and soon and very soon we're going to be Chang in a twinkle of eye to see the one that we love the one that you have talking about all these years the Lord Jesus Christ one day our eyes going to be pop open with a twink of right going to be changed to see him to beet the Lord in the air that's our promise that's our promise listen we are not going to face death I believe it with all my heart in the Dark Ages they gave their life for this gospel they killed them they turned them a sender they cut their head of They Crucified them they did everything to them it was an us anointing but but in our time an eagle anointing we are not going to die amen recently maybe you guys have come across it I read about the man that through him we have have decided to follow Jesus I know maybe most of have read about the story and the story goes like in the 18th century or the 19th century 18 something missionaries they went to India to talk about the Lord Jesus Christ and there was a chief over there who didn't receive them so this man sneak away and follow the king follow the missionaries to hear what they have to say and he received the Lord Jesus Christ he received the message they brought to him and he began to talk about the Lord Jesus Christ and the chief was so angry the chief told him and make a gathering and said I'm going to kill your children if you do not renounce this gospel and he said I have decided to follow Jesus I'm not going to renounce he killed his sons and then he show him his wife I'm killing your wife if you do not renounce this gospel he said that the world before me the cross before me I'm not going to renounce they kill his wife and he said I'm going to kill you too he said the world before me I've decided to follow Jesus I'm not turning back and the king killed him so after he killed him the king begin to think what kind of power what kind of spirit that this man have that he could witness me killing his sons killing his daughter his wife and himself and the King was so consumed by the power of God and the faith that this man had in such a way that he embraced that Christianity and the whole village they took Christ and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal because that man stood for the Lord Jesus Christ we have to stand for the Lord and we have been enjoying that song I've decided to follow Jesus no matter what happened because someone gave his life amen we have to give our life for this gospel if it's true amen if it's not true let's leave it and go and enjoy the world for a season but if it's true that have to support it with everything within us our mind our soul our spirit everything to support this gospel amen because that's the only way halfway will not do it yes we have to go all the way yes not halfway not Halfway Christian amen not have Bak you have to be hot potato you have to have Christ in you in such a way the devil at this time do not know what to do with you amen because Christ have been so R to you amen our God is good he's awesome God hallelujah he wonderful amen that man gave his life he had decided to follow Jesus are you decided to follow Jesus tonight no matter what the cross before me the World Behind Me amen let's give all all to the Lord Jesus Christ he deserve to be glorified

God God stand by them no matter what your mistakes no matter what you do wrong stand by the word of God stand by the gospel and he will stand by you he will never leave you nor forsake you though the world the things might get Hur they get Hur but he's in control amen you are here today you come to what else what do you lose amen hallelujah let's let's press on Amen let's press on Hallelujah let's

Ghost is in you and in me amen you are the apple of God's eye amen he promised he will never leave you nor forsake you be with you even in you thank you Lord the people are depending on you all this world is still staying because the bride is still here amen so what am I saying as Abraham pleaded for the people in L let's go for The Lost Ones amen let's continue to go for the lost ones because once the last one gets in we gone the door is s and if you don't go after them and we become lazy we are not going because remember God cannot do anything but you you are the hands of God you are representative of God it's you God is W because remember in somewhere in Hebrews he said that all those they what they are waiting on us they were son Ascender they will do this all those fa by faith Able by faith this by faith that by faith that but they all waiting on us you are the last one the last baton that God has put his confidence in you and in me to ride the trail once more so let's ask God if you don't have that Spirit of witnessing I so happy on Friday when that prayer request came and you could see how God is dealing with every individual everyone witnessing here and there amen because it's it's a gleaning time it's a gleaning time now I understand but you could see everyone is doing his part and that God is here tonight let's take the world to the world Amen and don't just keep it all to ourselves don't worry what the people will say don't worry about what they will see if it's for them they will get it because remember it's not you all that the father has given to me will come to me so our business is just to tell like Phillip invited Nathaniel come and see that's what we have to tell them that's our portion the rest is not in our hands and none of us can even add a stature a had to his St whatever you going to fulfill you can't fulfill more than what God has ordained for you you can't fulfill more you can't fulfill less so let don't look at one another but look at what God wants to do through you individually because we are not the same according to what the measure of Faith he gave some this he gave some that so your portion that God wants you to fulfill that's what you have to ask him no what God is fulfilling through Des fulfill what God want to do through you what will you have me to do that's the most important thing so I think that's I have for tonight anony can you please come and then let's end it amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah amen our god is awesome he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah God is good all the
