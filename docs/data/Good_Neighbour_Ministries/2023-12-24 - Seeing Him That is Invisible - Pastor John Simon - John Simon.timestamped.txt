[39:01] for those who are
[39:04] online uh watching at this uh broadcast
[39:08] at this time may the Lord bless you real
[39:11] good and may the Lord bless us all who
[39:14] are gathered here today under the
[39:18] inspiration of the word of God for this
[39:21] day and for this hour thank you so much
[39:24] uh very much for your uh praise and
[39:27] worship and glory be to God Amen God is
[39:31] good isn't
[39:32] he amen uh we want to look to Hebrews
[39:37] chapter 11 we're not going to keep you
[39:40] uh long but we at least want to bring
[39:44] the word of God to you and point your
[39:46] thoughts your minds and your hearts back
[39:49] to the
[39:50] word because as you know we are not here
[39:55] um as part of the systems that are out
[39:59] there in the world uh which is caught up
[40:03] with this
[40:04] fiction uh that is called uh modern
[40:10] Christmas now we know that there is a
[40:13] Christmas in the sense that Christ was
[40:15] born but this that we see outside with
[40:18] the
[40:20] commercialism the the tinsil the the uh
[40:23] green trees and stuff like that it's all
[40:27] Pagan
[40:28] worship right it's all Pagan worship
[40:30] we're not teaching on that now but you
[40:32] read Jeremiah where he say they cut a
[40:35] tree and they they they fix it on
[40:38] another piece of wood and they keep it
[40:40] and dress it up with all kinds of tensil
[40:43] and shiny stuff like that and they
[40:46] worship it as a God because you see when
[40:49] all the other trees died the pine trees
[40:52] remain green right so they start
[40:55] worshiping it as a God and it's come
[40:57] down until this time until it's become a
[41:01] tradition um people are doing it but
[41:04] they don't know why they're doing it now
[41:06] don't think I'm here uh preaching
[41:09] against Christmas trees um uh as such
[41:12] I'm just letting you know the truth of
[41:14] it and you decide what you want to do if
[41:17] you want to have a Christmas tree up
[41:19] nobody's going to condemn you or tell
[41:21] you anything because it's just the tree
[41:24] right but make sure that you let your
[41:26] children know that that's just a
[41:29] tradition that's not the word of God is
[41:32] that right just as much as uh uh St
[41:36] Nicholas that that's not in the Bible
[41:39] it's not scripture it's it's a Fiction
[41:41] made up of this St Nicholas who can see
[41:46] everything you're doing everywhere know
[41:49] everything you want everywhere and he's
[41:52] everywhere at every time and it's
[41:54] nothing but reverse the name
[41:58] Satan St Nicholas Santa just just just
[42:02] turn the word around and you see Satan
[42:04] hiding behind that and um he's telling
[42:09] you right now he's trying to get his
[42:10] claws in you
[42:13] right um so so you got to be spiritual
[42:17] and recognize what is happening because
[42:20] he does these things and he stays behind
[42:22] the scene and he's literally laughing at
[42:24] the people and mocking at them because
[42:27] they don't recognize he is back there
[42:30] doing his evil works that he normally
[42:34] does but thank God that we have a people
[42:37] called out by a prophetic message amen
[42:41] that have recognize the day and the hour
[42:44] that we're living in we are no more
[42:47] under rituals we no more under
[42:50] traditions we are not under religious
[42:53] systems we're under the preeminence of
[42:56] rulership and headship of the word of
[42:59] God is that right we are led by God's
[43:03] word I know when we speak like this
[43:05] people on the outside of the Tabernacle
[43:08] of the tent they don't know what you're
[43:10] talking about and we are also Christians
[43:13] we are also go to church right now our
[43:16] church is fill it's more full than your
[43:18] church and stuff like that you know but
[43:21] that's not the
[43:23] point amen broad is the way but you see
[43:27] we understand Jesus said that just few
[43:30] there be that will find that narrow way
[43:34] may God help every one of us to keep our
[43:36] eyes on the prize and upon the word of
[43:39] God as we go to our subject in Hebrews
[43:43] 11: 24-
[43:48] 27 Hebrews chapter
[43:51] 11 24-
[43:55] 27
[43:56] and let us read without uh delay praise
[44:00] God oh my uh by faith Moses when he was
[44:06] come to years refused to be called the
[44:09] son of Pharaoh's daughter he recognize
[44:12] who he was uh choosing rather than to
[44:16] suffer I'm going to preach if I take
[44:18] every verse so I stop I just going to
[44:21] read choosing rather to suffer
[44:24] Affliction with the people of of God
[44:26] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[44:29] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[44:32] greater riches than the treasures in
[44:35] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[44:38] recompense of the reward by faith he
[44:42] forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of
[44:45] the king for he
[44:47] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[44:52] and that's what I want to talk about
[44:54] here today seeing him that is invisible
[44:58] amen our gracious Heavenly Father we
[45:00] thank you for the reading of your word
[45:03] now we ask that the angel that troubled
[45:05] the waters back there and heal that sick
[45:09] man may you heal our sin sick Souls may
[45:14] you trouble the Waters of the word of
[45:18] God and Father we will give you glory
[45:20] and praise and we will not hesitate but
[45:23] to step into the anointing will step
[45:26] into the pool of your spirit and may you
[45:29] take the glory the honor and the praise
[45:32] in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen
[45:35] praise the Lord God bless
[45:40] you you know there's a poem that says
[45:44] who has seen the wind I think brother
[45:47] Desmond on Wednesday night was alluding
[45:50] to that and I said who has seen the wind
[45:55] uh but
[45:56] we have not seen the wind but we
[45:59] know that when the leaves are moving
[46:03] that the wind is passing by that's what
[46:06] David was saying he says when he sees
[46:09] the mulberry bushes moving I I'll know
[46:13] that that that you're passing by amen so
[46:16] when God begins to move and his Spirit
[46:21] comes into the church we know and we
[46:24] recognize him now when we read our
[46:28] scripture it tells us that Moses
[46:32] endured uh Pharaoh's wrath his anger uh
[46:37] he endured it and he had the power to
[46:40] endure using Brother brenham's message I
[46:44] I'm not quoting from that but I'm using
[46:46] the the topic to let you know what I'm
[46:49] talking about uh that he
[46:53] persevered he endured
[46:56] regardless of how angry Pharaoh was he
[47:01] had no fear for Pharaoh amen he had lost
[47:05] all the fear for Pharaoh because he had
[47:09] seen the face of the invisible
[47:12] King and seeing the invisible he was not
[47:16] worried about the visible because all
[47:19] things visible comes from the invisible
[47:22] Hallelujah he is the creator he is the
[47:25] originat
[47:26] he is everything of everything and so if
[47:30] I can come under his guidance his
[47:33] leadership his kingship no other king no
[47:36] other ruler no other power can can be of
[47:41] such a stature in front of my eyes that
[47:44] I would not obey him so Moses did not
[47:49] even fear uh Pharaoh anymore you see
[47:53] when you begin to get a vision and see
[47:57] him that is invisible you start to lose
[47:59] the fear of man you start losing the
[48:03] fear of great titles and great names and
[48:07] great authorities you respect them but
[48:10] you have lost your fear of all those
[48:13] things because you come on the invisible
[48:16] Kingdom of the resurrected Christ that's
[48:20] what we are here for today praise God
[48:23] anointed by the Holy Spirit to keep our
[48:26] eyes seeing him that is invisible
[48:30] hallelujah amen Lord Jesus said when you
[48:34] see me you have seen the father when you
[48:38] see me the visible me you are looking at
[48:41] the invisible father that indwells me
[48:44] praise God when you see the word
[48:48] hallelujah that is as the outward part
[48:50] but when you recognize what you're
[48:52] looking at you're beginning to see the
[48:55] father father that's in the word back of
[48:58] that word you're seeing invisible God
[49:01] hallelujah amen and that gives us the
[49:04] power to endure doesn't matter what
[49:07] problems no matter what trouble whatever
[49:10] trial what sickness whatever Satan puts
[49:13] upon you you can come through it all why
[49:16] you're seeing him that is invisible
[49:19] Hallelujah keep your eyes on him that is
[49:22] invisible Hallelujah yes sir praise God
[49:26] hallelujah yes sir so I'm saying if you
[49:30] can
[49:31] see and
[49:33] understand this revealed word of this
[49:37] hour you are looking at the father amen
[49:41] you are seeing the father not with your
[49:45] visible eyes but you are seeing him
[49:48] through Revelation by the eyes of the
[49:51] Soul amen oh praise God we sing the
[49:56] songs but do we really think Open the
[49:59] Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of
[50:03] My Heart Lord I want to see you I want
[50:09] to see you to see you high and lifted up
[50:14] oh praise God don't you want to see him
[50:17] high and lifted up oh yes may God Open
[50:20] the Eyes of My Heart on this uh this day
[50:24] that we are celebrating the birth of
[50:27] Jesus Christ into flesh amen you see all
[50:32] comes into view what
[50:35] condescension coming down from the
[50:37] invisible to become visible so we can
[50:41] understand him and then he can go back
[50:43] to the visible and we don't care whether
[50:45] we see him with our physical eyes but we
[50:49] recognize him within our heart the
[50:51] invisible God hallelujah amen yes sir
[50:56] praise God isn't it written in the
[50:59] scriptures where Jesus said blessed are
[51:04] the pure in heart for they shall see
[51:09] God it's only when I looked at this
[51:13] scripture and begin to understand what
[51:15] it means what he was really saying
[51:17] blessed are they who have that seed in
[51:21] them that can't sin blessed are the pure
[51:25] in
[51:26] heart for they the ones that will see
[51:31] God they will recognize him the
[51:34] invisible King made himself in a visible
[51:38] a a visible body so that we could
[51:43] understand and recognize him and know
[51:46] who he was praise the Lord thank God for
[51:50] the seed that is within your
[51:52] life for the seed of God cannot s
[51:55] amen you say oh I'm not I'm not perfect
[51:59] I'm not pure yes it's this man outside
[52:01] here but the man inside blessed are they
[52:04] pure in heart I said you're pure in
[52:08] heart I don't care what you done what
[52:11] you done in the past what You' done
[52:13] yesterday the Bible says the Lord God
[52:16] says you're pure in heart because his
[52:19] life his seed is within you and it
[52:22] cannot sin but you are kept not by
[52:25] yourself or by your you're kept by the
[52:28] power of God through faith you're kept
[52:31] by the power of God through faith
[52:33] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[52:36] Lord God I praise God and give God the
[52:39] glory for his wonderful works praise the
[52:42] Lord amen just take a little walk with
[52:46] me and let's go down the road a little
[52:50] while not here but back over there back
[52:54] in the east back in J Around Judea amen
[52:59] hallelujah and while we walk if we look
[53:03] in the crowds the jostling crowds
[53:06] because at this time of the year in
[53:09] Jerusalem and in Juda the people with
[53:13] their garments on are rushing back and
[53:16] forth as they're preparing to roast
[53:19] Lambs or whatever like that and as we
[53:23] walk we we
[53:26] see a man preaching and he's preaching
[53:29] by the side of the way and when we see
[53:32] him preaching we want to stop to hear
[53:36] what he is saying amen yes sir some stop
[53:41] to hear him like it is today some will
[53:44] stop to hear and some will just pass by
[53:49] you give them a track you give them a
[53:52] book they'll take it and throw it in the
[53:54] dumpster
[53:56] some will hold it and will read it when
[53:59] they get home but uh you see the times
[54:04] have
[54:05] changed the buildings the clothing but
[54:08] the sensual man has not change he's the
[54:13] same if at 10,000 years pass he's still
[54:16] the same still born in sin shaped in
[54:20] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[54:23] and accept for the grace of God God by a
[54:26] life that he placed in us we had no hope
[54:29] but by him in our lives we have hope in
[54:32] Jesus Christ there is no other hope but
[54:34] the hope we have in Christ amen praise
[54:37] God hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise
[54:42] God and here is this man
[54:45] preaching and I tell you if that man was
[54:48] a lawyer he would be successful because
[54:51] he was preaching speaking
[54:53] boldly telling of the word of God thus
[54:57] sayeth the Lord amen yes sir that man
[55:01] might have been a a great doctor and
[55:03] maybe he'll make millions of dollars and
[55:07] I just thought I'd ask him who he was
[55:11] said sir you're preaching like we saw in
[55:14] Ghana we saw people preaching by the
[55:17] side of the road sir what is your name
[55:21] and he said well uh my name is Isaiah
[55:26] my name is Isaiah well Isaiah what are
[55:29] you doing Isaiah what why you here out
[55:32] in the street preaching why not go up in
[55:35] one of the churches or in the temple he
[55:38] said well I'd rather be out here
[55:40] preaching to the people so the people
[55:43] can hear me what it is that I have to
[55:46] say uh well well Isaiah you're doing a
[55:49] good job but it don't look like the
[55:51] people appreciate
[55:53] you because because some are walking
[55:56] away others don't want to hear what you
[55:59] have to say they don't seem to
[56:01] appreciate you but Isaiah said sir you
[56:04] don't understand uh real Servants of God
[56:09] I'm not here preaching to be appreciated
[56:11] I'm here preaching to bring forth the
[56:14] word of God whatever it might do or
[56:17] whatever it has to do I'm just here to
[56:20] speak it I'm here to preach it amen not
[56:22] to be appreciated lifted up and counted
[56:25] worthy but I'm here to do the will of
[56:28] the Living God and I hope every one of
[56:30] us here is here for that purpose and I
[56:32] hope you live your life in that way to
[56:35] please God and not to please your
[56:37] neighbor not to please Mrs Jones and Mr
[56:40] Jones Next Door whatever they are doing
[56:42] that's their Affairs but you keep you
[56:44] your life in line with the word of the
[56:46] Living God Amen praise God forever more
[56:51] amen
[56:53] well Isaiah
[56:56] you not
[56:57] normal uh how you acting is not normal
[57:01] Isaiah said well I can understand what
[57:04] you're
[57:05] saying but when I tell you that one day
[57:08] I went to the Tabernacle and I was there
[57:12] in prayer and when I was there in prayer
[57:16] I saw them cherub bims and
[57:19] Sims I saw them in the temple I saw the
[57:23] Lord sitting on the Throne I saw him
[57:26] high and lifted up Hallelujah the
[57:29] Holiness struck my soul I couldn't take
[57:33] it I said who is me oh I am undone My
[57:37] Flesh can't take it amen Oh my he was
[57:41] like that voice is me I am undone he
[57:44] said I Heard a Voice said who will go
[57:48] who will go for us whom shall I send and
[57:52] who will go oh my that's voice is crying
[57:56] out again today who will go who will I
[58:00] send who will obey the voice of God who
[58:03] will hear the word of God for this day
[58:05] and for this hour amen if you seen the
[58:08] word if you seen the
[58:11] Revelation really in its fullness you
[58:14] will begin to say like Isaiah who is me
[58:18] Lord who is me father my eyes have seen
[58:23] the glory of the living God and I walk
[58:26] with him alone amen yes sir amen praise
[58:31] God hallelujah and while when that was
[58:34] happening one of those angels went and
[58:38] took a a tongue and picked up a call
[58:42] from off the the great chandel the great
[58:46] sensor that they had there and took it
[58:49] from The Altar and brought it right and
[58:53] placed it on my tongue amen which means
[58:58] he had to open his mouth praise God and
[59:01] we got to open our mouths is I right I
[59:04] said we come to church we got to open
[59:06] our mouths if we want to get blessed we
[59:09] got to open our mouth it means we got to
[59:12] praise God we got to give God the glory
[59:15] and we got to honor him amen he placed
[59:18] that call on my tongue set my tongue on
[59:22] fire oh my that I couldn't help
[59:26] preaching everywhere I went I couldn't
[59:28] help talking about him I couldn't talk
[59:31] anything else about but Jehovah because

[1:00:06] because I am seeing him that is
[1:00:10] invisible I trust when you see him like
[1:00:13] Isaiah did it will set your soul on fire

[1:00:34] have come down to see a burning uh you

[1:00:40] Nebuchadnezzar gave an order to burn
[1:00:43] three of them Hebrew boys burn them in a
[1:00:46] fire and there the crowds gather and

[1:13:56] preaching they tell him the same thing
[1:13:58] they told Isaiah the people don't
[1:14:00] appreciate you but and in the first
[1:14:03] place you should not be preaching cuz
[1:14:06] you're just a
[1:14:07] deacon you're just a deacon what are you
[1:14:10] doing getting up there on the pulpit
[1:14:12] saying that you're preaching he says
[1:14:15] yeah but I'm a preaching
[1:14:17] Deacon thank God for those preaching
[1:14:19] deacons I said thank God for those
[1:14:21] preaching Deacons oh praise God and he
[1:14:25] was preaching the word of God and while
[1:14:27] he was preaching there somebody took a
[1:14:30] brick and threw it at him praise the
[1:14:32] Lord you know in some societies it's not
[1:14:34] quite as nice like here we get up on a
[1:14:37] nice pulpit in a nice Church like this
[1:14:39] you got to be out there and you are
[1:14:41] constantly in battle because you are in
[1:14:44] the streets you are preaching and

[1:14:57] you you you got to stand with the word
[1:14:59] of God and withstand those Devils amen

[1:15:04] facing and the bricks began to hit him
[1:15:08] beat him bloody him and when they looked
[1:15:11] at him instead of him being scared and
[1:15:14] wanting to run he had a smile on his
[1:15:17] face Oh my he fell on the ground I ran
[1:15:20] over I picked him up and picked his head
[1:15:23] up he was still smiling I said Stephen

[1:15:29] smiling he says I'm smiling because I
[1:15:32] see Jesus standing oh come on Steven
