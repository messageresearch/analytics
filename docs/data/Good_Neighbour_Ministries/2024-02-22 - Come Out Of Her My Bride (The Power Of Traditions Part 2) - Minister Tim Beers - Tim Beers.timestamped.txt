[24:05] series on the power of tradition I want
[24:08] to I want to call this uh come out of
[24:11] her my
[24:12] bride part two amen so let us turn to
[24:16] the Book of Revelations chapter we got
[24:18] three scripture
[24:20] readings Revelations
[24:22] 181 then we're going to go to John 8:31
[24:26] and then Matthew 242 2 Hallelujah we've
[24:29] been talking about um you know the power
[24:33] of tradition everybody remember kind of
[24:36] remember the first uh
[24:37] part well we'll just re recap a little
[24:40] bit and we'll just get right into it
[24:42] amen Revelation 181 and after these
[24:46] things I saw another Angel come down
[24:48] from heaven having a great power and the
[24:52] Earth was lightning with his glory and
[24:55] he cried mightily
[24:58] with a strong voice saying Babylon the
[25:01] great is Fallen is fallen and is become
[25:05] the habitation of devils and and the
[25:08] hold of every foul spirit and a cage of
[25:12] every unclean and hateful bird for all
[25:16] nations have drunk of the wine of the
[25:19] wrath of her fornication and the kings
[25:22] of the Earth have committed fornication
[25:24] with her and the merchants of the Earth
[25:27] are waed Rich through her abundance of
[25:31] her jealousy and I heard another voice
[25:34] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[25:36] people that ye be not partakers of her
[25:40] sins and that you receive not of her
[25:42] plagues for her sins have reached unto
[25:45] heaven and God had remembered her
[25:48] iniquities amen let's go to John
[25:56] 8:31
[26:02] Hallelujah then said Jesus to those Jews
[26:05] which believed on him if ye continue in
[26:09] my word then ye are my disciples
[26:12] indeed and you shall know the truth and
[26:16] the truth shall make you free they
[26:18] answered him we be Abraham's seed and we
[26:22] never EMB bonish to any man how sayest
[26:25] thou ye shall be made free Jesus
[26:28] answered them verily verily I say unto
[26:30] you whosoever committed sin is a servant
[26:34] of sin and the servant abideth not in
[26:37] the house forever but the son abideth
[26:40] forever if the son therefore shall make
[26:43] you free you shall be free
[26:47] indeed Matthew
[26:54] 24:22 and except those days should be
[26:58] shorten there should no flesh be saved
[27:02] but for the elect's sake those days
[27:04] shall be
[27:05] shorten then if any man shall say unto
[27:09] you Lo here is Christ or there believe
[27:13] it not for there shall rise false
[27:17] christs false prophets and shall show
[27:20] great signs and wonders in so much that
[27:22] if it were possible they shall deceive
[27:26] the very evil
[27:28] elect let us pray father we thank you

[29:28] here my brothers and sisters it's not

[29:44] we're fighting against here amen it's
[29:47] not positions that we're fighting
[29:48] against here but it's principalities
[29:51] owers spiritual wickedness in high
[29:55] places it's always been that battle and
[29:58] it always will be that battle and it's
[30:01] always been that same Deliverance that
[30:03] God's people had to overcome in every
[30:06] age that they
[30:08] faced just like it says in the Book of
[30:10] Revelations to him that overcometh to
[30:13] him that overcometh it's always to the
[30:15] Overcomer and we have to be Overcomers
[30:19] in order for us to reign with him in
[30:21] this hour there's no way about it
[30:24] there's no way around it amen
[30:28] Hallelujah and we must know our enemy we
[30:31] must not be ignorant of his devices in
[30:34] order to defeat the enemy you got to
[30:37] know his tactics you got to know his
[30:38] strengths amen you got to know where
[30:41] he's going to hit
[30:44] hallelujah
[30:46] amen Jesus said you'll know the truth
[30:49] and the truth will set you free now we
[30:51] look back at the first service and we
[30:56] see that Jesus when he came we know that
[31:01] Christ was the
[31:03] law amen and the Pharisees and Sadducees
[31:07] and the scribes were there coming
[31:10] against the law they say they were
[31:12] keeping the law but they were coming
[31:15] against the very law that they were
[31:17] trying to keep why they didn't recognize
[31:20] him they didn't recognize that he had
[31:23] come to fulfill the law because of all
[31:27] their
[31:28] traditions because of all their dogmas
[31:31] and
[31:32] Creeds because of their oral law that
[31:35] they created it blinded them to the law
[31:38] himself Christ they blinded themsel it
[31:42] blinded them from the very prophecies in
[31:45] the law that spoke of Jesus to fulfill
[31:49] in that day they could not see it though
[31:52] they studied it though they knew it from
[31:55] back and front and here was standing
[31:57] before
[31:58] them and they couldn't recognize it the
[32:02] very law the living law before them the
[32:05] ones the law that they studied all these
[32:07] years but they created so much Tradition
[32:11] now we're talking about a spirit
[32:13] here the two spirits that have always
[32:16] come down to the
[32:18] end the trail of the serpent
[32:22] amen remember people die but Spirits
[32:25] don't die remember history always
[32:29] repeats
[32:30] itself and we can look back and see that
[32:33] here was Jesus fulfilling the law he had
[32:37] to come to fulfill that law he had to be
[32:42] rejected he had to be rejected he had to
[32:45] be crucified in order for what to
[32:48] fulfill the law to let the old the old
[32:53] Covenant the law the mosaic law to be
[32:56] done away with
[32:57] and then enter into the New
[33:00] Covenant with the New Covenant the New
[33:03] Testament with the church to set it up
[33:07] and it's always been that same
[33:11] way there has to be a rejection there
[33:15] has to be a
[33:16] crucifixion of the
[33:19] truth stay with
[33:21] me
[33:25] Hallelujah now do we
[33:27] realize and greatest battle ever
[33:30] fought there's only really two
[33:33] powers in the whole universe all of our
[33:37] differences between nations difference
[33:40] between each other there's only two
[33:43] powers and two kingdoms and the rest of
[33:45] the little miners are connected either
[33:48] one of those powers and those powers are
[33:51] God's power and Satan's power that's all
[33:55] that there is there's two two Powers
[33:57] here
[33:58] tonight Satan's power of unbelief and
[34:02] deception and God's power of Truth and
[34:05] Revelation that sets us free
[34:09] Hallelujah we are not free completely or
[34:14] indeed until the son of man comes by
[34:17] faith and sets us free we are not free
[34:21] because we believe in the message we're
[34:24] not free because we believe in a Prophet
[34:27] our real prophet of this day those
[34:30] things are good but we are free when we
[34:32] catch a revelation and when the son of
[34:35] man comes to you and reveals to you
[34:39] that's what sets you
[34:42] free that's what sets you
[34:44] free how do you know look at the
[34:47] Pharisees and Sadducees look at them we
[34:50] we be not in bondage we Abraham's seed
[34:54] we in the message we have no sin I
[34:57] believe the message I believe everything
[34:59] we be not in
[35:01] bondage and when the word came to them
[35:04] what did they do he said we not we don't
[35:07] have no sin we're not in bondage to no
[35:09] man but here was Christ the word saying
[35:13] you are definitely in sin in unbelief
[35:16] and you need forgiveness of your sins
[35:21] Hallelujah that's us tonight my brothers
[35:23] and sisters we need to progress in this
[35:26] word

[35:41] us that we didn't want we got to take
[35:45] the word and seek the word in
[35:48] desperation to break these things off of

[36:47] the church ages and that has come with
[36:50] great power of deception it's us that
[36:53] has to come out of it it's the bride
[36:56] that's coming out he said come out of
[36:58] her my people not the Sinners not the

[37:20] Hallelujah that's what we want to talk
[37:23] about part three is going to be
[37:27] right in the
[37:28] message right in the
[37:33] message the open of the Seven Seals was
[37:36] the beginning of Deliverance of the
[37:38] bondage of the great from her
[37:41] false teaching in all her lives about
[37:44] the Bible it revealed her Traditions her
[37:48] dogmas her Creeds was not God's word the
[37:52] Lord Jesus was set his bride free to
[37:55] manifest his life in this last
[37:59] generation 400 years without a
[38:02] word from one Prophet to another he
[38:05] journeyed until the last prophet was
[38:07] Malachi and then there was another
[38:09] Prophet for 400 there wasn't another
[38:11] Prophet for 400 years and then God came
[38:14] on the scene one day he walked amongst
[38:17] them again but their
[38:20] Traditions had so tooken a place amongst
[38:23] them he was a stranger to them
[38:28] let me tell
[38:29] you this is being fulfilled today but
[38:33] not to the
[38:35] bride not to the
[38:38] bride no
[38:40] way this has to take place you order you
[38:44] see an order for the setting for
[38:47] prophecies to take place when when
[38:50] Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive 800
[38:53] years later there had to be a time and a
[38:56] a season and a place where Jesus Christ
[39:00] would had to come on the scene all the
[39:03] elements amen of the world and the
[39:06] system had to be everything had to be in
[39:09] place to welcome
[39:12] him to welcome his revi his rival to the
[39:17] world so he can fulfill it's the same
[39:20] thing today no different than back then
[39:25] hallelujah
[39:27] but their Traditions took the place
[39:29] amongst them he was a stranger to them
[39:32] the traditions of the fathers had
[39:35] washing pans and a way to groom their
[39:37] hair and wear certain buttons on their
[39:40] coats and their certain Priestess robes
[39:44] one starchy Pharisee and another one
[39:47] sadducee you see and that had taken the
[39:50] place of the word amongst those men
[39:53] until God visited them and he was forign
[39:56] to them oh let me tell you about the
[39:59] traditions in this message wearing of
[40:02] hair skirts all these things amen doing
[40:06] it this way doing it that way so many
[40:09] Traditions man-made interpretations
[40:12] making up things that are not in the
[40:14] word that were never instructed by the
[40:17] prophet of
[40:20] God what is it
[40:22] doing what is it really
[40:25] doing it's blinding them from him as
[40:28] making him Jesus Christ a foreigner to
[40:32] them and not even recognizing it not
[40:36] even recognizing it is happening to
[40:39] them if it were possible to deceive the
[40:41] very elect caught in these Traditions
[40:45] caught in the cultures of this
[40:51] message
[40:54] Hallelujah that taking the place place
[40:56] of the word amongst men may I say this
[40:59] with love going beyond the camp brother

[41:43] fulfilled in this day and there's
[41:46] nothing there is no
[41:48] setting no
[41:51] atmosphere that can produce the real
[41:53] bride of Jesus Christ unless this comes
[41:56] on the scene in the midst of
[41:59] her she has to be walking in the midst
[42:02] of her because it's Jesus Christ
[42:06] revealing the hidden secrets to her what
[42:09] are the hidden secrets revealing things
[42:13] that are of this spirit this Antichrist
[42:15] spirit so she doesn't be

[43:20] 3:25 the Roman Empire Constantine took
[43:24] over the political control of the
[43:28] church forcing it to believe
[43:31] unscriptural words and embrace Pagan
[43:34] beliefs and Jesus right away immediately
[43:38] at the first church age told them in
[43:40] Revelations chapter 2 I have somewhat
[43:44] against you because these Deeds of the
[43:49] nicadan we can't hit on every foul
[43:52] spirit and every demon but we're going
[43:54] to talk about Nick Ian Spirit here very
[43:59] important very important amongst the
[44:01] Gentiles
[44:03] especially now what does it
[44:09] mean nickel conquer the ly in other
[44:13] words they want to make instead of
[44:15] everyone being holy they want to take
[44:18] away from the leot and make a holy man
[44:22] it's not a holy man or a Holy Hill it's
[44:25] a holy God amongst the people and the L
[44:28] has a part of it we are children there's
[44:33] no great one amongst us how can you have
[44:36] faith when you desire respect for one
[44:39] another or control one
[44:43] another we are all one in Christ there's
[44:46] no big man little man we're all the same
[44:49] we're children of one father and we are
[44:52] children of him 1963 greater than
[44:55] Solomon is
[44:57] here we are not a
[45:00] denomination written mystery Babylon the
[45:03] great mother of abomination the mother
[45:05] of harlots Abominations of the earth
[45:08] what is she she's a
[45:11] and what she is a mother of what
[45:15] she's a mother she had begotten
[45:17] something a mother of Sons of harlots
[45:20] what is a harlot something as a
[45:23] immoral woman what made her immoral her
[45:28] Doctrine her beliefs made her a
[45:34] immoral spiritually
[45:37] speaking
[45:39] Hallelujah she was pretending to be a
[45:41] Christan church but was given out
[45:45] man-made dogmas and here she said that
[45:48] she was the first
[45:50] organization then seems like some
[45:53] organizations come out of her my people
[45:56] dogmas means the doctrine of belief in a
[46:01] religion or a political system the
[46:05] literal meaning of Dogma in ancient
[46:08] Greek was something that seems true
[46:12] think about it in the ancient Greek
[46:14] Dogma something that seems
[46:18] true it's not truth Jesus said said You
[46:22] shall know the truth and it the truth
[46:24] shall set you free not not something
[46:27] that seems to be truth not something
[46:30] that man is and interpret to be truth
[46:33] but you'll know the
[46:36] truth these days in the English Dogma is
[46:40] more absolute if you believe in a
[46:42] certain religion or pH philosophy you
[46:46] believe in its Dogma or core
[46:50] assumption assuming assumption the core
[46:54] assumption you talk about core belief
[46:58] but the dogmas are core
[47:01] assumptions now you're automatically I
[47:03] know you're automatically looking back
[47:06] to the Catholic church but remember that
[47:10] Spirit has entered in brother bram's
[47:13] seen the trail of The Serpent and he's
[47:16] seen that serpent which is that Spirit
[47:18] right there of
[47:20] denomination come right into the
[47:22] message right in here Spirits don't die
[47:28] they're
[47:30] alive we have to
[47:34] recognize what the spirit is saying to
[47:36] the
[47:37] churches what the spirit is saying in
[47:40] this hour
[47:43] hallelujah
[47:44] amen get out of this this this belief
[47:48] that you're okay that you're safe in the
[47:50] message that you're safe in The Message
[47:54] Church get get out of that
[47:56] belief because you fight not flesh and
[48:00] blood amen we're only safe in Christ in
[48:04] the revelation of the word and that
[48:06] comes by a new birth unless a man or
[48:09] woman is born again they cannot see or
[48:11] enter into the kingdom of God in
[48:13] desperation in the token message in
[48:19] desperation when he preached a token
[48:22] message it put him in
[48:24] desperation
[48:26] it'll put you in desperation if your
[48:29] eyes are open to see the two spirits
[48:32] that are manifested in the church
[48:35] today the
[48:37] message I'm only preaching about the
[48:41] Catholic church in the and the
[48:43] here and mystery Babylon to show you
[48:46] where these Spirits originated from and
[48:48] that they're not dead they're still
[48:51] alive amen and to over and to order to
[48:55] overcome
[48:56] we got to recognize them here

[51:08] that don't mean nothing you tell me
[51:10] that's not here today you tell me that's
[51:13] not in the message today that same
[51:15] spirit is not here today manifesting
[51:17] itself so if those Spirits are
[51:19] manifesting itself then that Spirit of
[51:22] denomination is here today you don't
[51:24] believe what they believe you don't
[51:26] believe their Doctrine in this message
[51:28] like they believe it you don't tally up
[51:31] to what they believe and come into their
[51:34] group or their movement they'll
[51:36] excommunicate you it's taking place now
[51:40] and manifesting amongst the message
[51:42] right now what is it is it Flesh and
[51:45] Blood no it's principalities spiritual
[51:48] wickedness in high places taking
[51:51] over
[51:53] ministers right now
[51:58] Hallelujah the elevation of a holy man
[52:00] above the Le or congregation was a major
[52:04] sin in the first
[52:06] church these elevated church leaders are
[52:08] called nickel
[52:10] adans Revelations
[52:12] 2:6 but this thou H has that hatest the
[52:16] deed ofation which I also hate in the
[52:19] first church the leaders began pushing
[52:22] down
[52:24] people oh oh
[52:26] my it's not happening
[52:29] today all right let's get the war
[52:33] here
[52:34] hallelujah pushing down
[52:37] people
[52:39] hallelujah church leaders love to be
[52:42] important Revelations
[52:44] 2:15 write these scriptures down that's
[52:47] why I'm giving them to you thou has also
[52:52] them that hold the doctrine of the
[52:53] nickel leans which I hate this is the
[52:56] third Church age between 312 ad and 606
[53:00] ad Deeds had developed into a Doctrine
[53:04] now now they elevated priests or pastors
[53:09] who officially in charge of each Church
[53:13] a bishop then was elevated to be in
[53:15] charge of the number of priests and
[53:18] pastors by the fourth Church age there
[53:21] were Cardinals in charge of Bishops and
[53:24] artch Bishops
[53:26] but God hates elevating human leadership
[53:29] in the church we must never forget that
[53:32] principle Revelations 510 thou has made
[53:36] us unto our God Kings and Priests us
[53:41] means all of
[53:43] us it's pushing people
[53:46] down that's what that Spirit does it
[53:49] doesn't give the freedom that Christ
[53:52] wants in his church and his people to
[53:54] manifest
[53:57] Fest go back study the book of Acts
[54:01] study the early church study the history
[54:05] and see how they manifest
[54:07] it and see how God prospered them see
[54:11] how they
[54:16] grew and see what Spirit was manifesting
[54:19] amongst
[54:20] them every saved Christian is a king and
[54:23] priest a priest stood between the Jews
[54:25] and God every saved Christian is a
[54:28] priest towards the unsaved because they
[54:31] can lead a sinner to Christ but once
[54:34] that sinner accepts Christ then he also
[54:37] becomes a priest the only one above a
[54:40] priest was the high priest that is Jesus
[54:45] all saved Christians are priests with no
[54:48] other human above them only Jesus is
[54:51] above the priests all priests are equal
[54:54] to each other
[54:55] priests are only above sinners in terms
[54:58] of the kingdom of God Hebrews 3:1
[55:01] therefore holy Brethren partakers of the
[55:04] Heavenly colon consider the Apostle the
[55:06] high priest of our profession Christ
[55:08] Jesus all kings are equal the only H one
[55:13] higher than the king is the king of
[55:15] kings who is Jesus Mark 10 4245
[55:20] greatness in the kingdom of God will be
[55:24] of elevated in a complete different way
[55:27] than greatness in the world by the world
[55:30] standard servants are numbered amongst
[55:32] the least because they must take orders
[55:35] from those who have authority over them
[55:38] but in the kingdom of God the greatest
[55:40] is the least in the kingdom and the
[55:42] least is the greatest Revelations
[55:45] 19:16 and he had on his vesture on his
[55:49] thigh a name King of Kings so no
[55:53] Christian is above a Christian this
[55:55] nickel leismo be a Christian you must be

[56:11] hallelujah Ephesians 3:14: 15 our Lord
[56:15] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[56:17] Heaven and Earth is named the entire
[56:20] church is one big family we are all

[57:01] and said behold my mother and my
[57:03] brethren for whosoever do the will of My
[57:07] Father which is in heaven is the same as
[57:11] my brother as my sister and as my
[57:15] mother what is this for my brothers and
[57:18] sisters what is this
[57:22] saying is to kill that
[57:25] spirit because that spirit will push
[57:29] people
[57:30] down that's not the spirit of
[57:34] Christ Hallelujah we are brethren we are
[57:38] family of God Amen nobody is better and
[57:42] greater we have different gifts yes we
[57:44] have different portions of Faith but we
[57:47] respect one another and the Bible also
[57:50] says those who are given much is
[57:52] expected much and those who are given
[57:55] amen as a lot and became and God has
[57:59] placed them in the kingdom of God must
[58:00] become the least Hallelujah anybody
[58:04] who's great in the Kingdom will make the
[58:06] other person feel greater than
[58:08] themselves and that's how God runs his
[58:11] body and his
[58:13] church but that nickel Adan Spirit you

[59:02] only being part of the family of God and
[59:05] doing his will your position in the body
[59:08] depends on doing his will no part of the
[59:11] body is inferior or below another part
[59:15] the only top position in the body is the
[59:18] head because the body is controlled by
[59:21] the head only the head is above the body
[59:24] parts and controls them this position of
[59:28] the head belongs only to Jesus Christ
[59:32] Ephesians 523 for Christ is the head of
[59:36] the church Christ is our head Hallelujah

[1:00:04] the body I'm talking the new birth is
[1:00:07] the greatest miracle that ever could
[1:00:09] take

[1:00:17] might be some out there that have to

[1:01:04] three parts and the City of all Nations
[1:01:06] fell the great Babylon came in
[1:01:09] remembrance before God and give unto her

[1:01:15] the wrath of God Revelation 16 19 God
[1:01:20] will someday destroy spiritual Babylon
[1:01:23] with great anger because of its great
[1:01:25] wickedness and there came one out of the
[1:01:28] seventh angel which had the seven vials
[1:01:31] and talked with me saying unto me come

[1:02:32] controlled by one city yet covering the
[1:02:35] whole entire Earth no other than the

[1:02:43] movement of the religious tolerance and
[1:02:46] uniting of everything today that is
[1:02:49] called Humanity not uniting for Christ
[1:02:52] but Humanity that's the the call of the
[1:02:55] Catholic church today uniting Humanity
[1:02:58] together think about it my brothers and
[1:03:00] sisters we're not uniting flesh and
[1:03:03] blood we're not uniting Humanity amen

[1:03:41] habitation of the Earth has been drunken
[1:03:43] by her wine Revelation 17:2 religious
[1:03:47] fornication is the term God uses in
[1:03:50] Fallen organizations that claim to be
[1:03:53] Christians but in reality is a traitor
[1:03:57] of everything that God has
[1:04:01] ordained God has ordained his word he's
[1:04:05] ordained a prophet in these last days to
[1:04:08] give us a pure
[1:04:10] word and that's what he's ordained in
[1:04:12] this day and nothing
[1:04:15] else that's the only thing that he's
[1:04:17] going to stand
[1:04:18] behind
[1:04:21] Hallelujah he's not calling out a bunch

[1:14:32] they refused to repent Revelation 9:20
[1:14:35] to 21 but now they also curse God
[1:14:41] indicating an increase in hardness in
[1:14:44] their lives and in their hearts the
[1:14:46] outpouring of the six bowl the nomical
[1:14:50] spirits from the Satanic Trinity enti
[1:14:53] rulers of the world to make war with one
[1:14:56] another what result is not just a battle
[1:14:59] between nations but is the great day of
[1:15:02] battle for the almighty himself when he
[1:15:05] destroys his enemies Revelations 12:14
[1:15:08] without warning God acts the
[1:15:12] unexpectedness of his intervention is a
[1:15:15] good reason for believers always to be
[1:15:18] prepared so that they are not ashamed
[1:15:21] when he comes
[1:15:24] oh he's going to act my brothers and
[1:15:25] sisters you know just just like the the

[1:15:37] is coming Tighter and Tighter and
[1:15:39] Tighter in this hour this deception is
[1:15:42] growing stronger and stronger in this

[1:15:48] swiftly
[1:15:49] unexpectedly amen hallelujah and the
[1:15:53] Bride of Jesus Christ the ones with the
[1:15:55] oil in their lamps not the foolish
[1:15:59] virgins ones being
[1:16:02] foolish but the wise version are going
[1:16:05] to be ready and only they are going to
[1:16:07] be ready in this
[1:16:09] hour as with the seven seal and the
[1:16:12] Seven trumpets so with the seven bowls
[1:16:15] our flash of lightning pearls and
[1:16:18] Thunders and and earthquakes Revelation
[1:16:21] 17:18 revelation 85 Revelations 11:19
[1:16:26] like the great City Babylon the ungodly
[1:16:29] world has become so proud of his
[1:16:31] achievements and power that it has
[1:16:34] chosen to ignore God and build
[1:16:38] civilization soberly to suit
[1:16:44] itself
[1:16:46] purposely avoid
[1:16:49] God by their
[1:16:52] traditions
[1:16:54] and took the word to suit
[1:16:59] themselves
[1:17:03] Hallelujah Satan's bride has a voice my
[1:17:06] brothers and
[1:17:08] sisters therefore like Babylon it is
[1:17:11] destroyed in a terrible judgment from
[1:17:13] all powers and the holy God Revelations
[1:17:18] 19:21 this judgment will describe in the
[1:17:21] great detail the voice of the Bride
[1:17:25] there are many voices in this present
[1:17:27] generation however the one voice that
[1:17:31] hasn't yet been heard in its entirety in
[1:17:34] its fullness is the voice of the
[1:17:37] Bride Revelations 18 why my brothers and
[1:17:41] sisters why hasn't she been heard in her
[1:17:44] entirety in her fullness because she has
[1:17:47] to come into the fullness and the
[1:17:49] entirety of the word of God the
[1:17:52] understanding of who who she is when she
[1:17:54] recognizes who she is in this hour when
[1:17:56] she overcomes my brothers and sisters
[1:17:58] when she can discern the two spirits in
[1:18:01] the framework of the church or the
[1:18:03] message Hallelujah then her voice is
[1:18:06] going to be start being heard then God

[1:27:40] virgins I'm winding it
[1:27:45] down 144,000
[1:27:49] Jews what's the matter today with the
[1:27:51] sleeping virgin stay long enough they
[1:27:53] don't stay long enough to get they only
[1:27:56] stay long enough to get part of that
[1:27:57] word not all of the
[1:27:59] word the deceived Church stays long
[1:28:02] enough to get part of that word not all
[1:28:04] of the
[1:28:06] word yeah they were sincere and honest
[1:28:09] about it so was Eve and Eve was
[1:28:12] deceived the Bible says she was
[1:28:16] deceived message people pick up a few
[1:28:19] base ideas about the Bible from the
[1:28:21] quotes of brother brandham then they
[1:28:23] focus on interpreting certain careful
[1:28:26] selected quotes without proving them
[1:28:28] from the scripture soon they refer very
[1:28:32] little to scripture as it is much easier
[1:28:35] to read brother bram's sermons than
[1:28:38] study the Bible because studying the
[1:28:39] Bible's hard work studying the word of
[1:28:43] God as a result message people have
[1:28:46] become increasingly Bible
[1:28:48] illiterate and the greatest enemy of
[1:28:51] knowledge
[1:28:52] is not just ignorance it is also the
[1:28:55] illusion of
[1:28:56] knowledge people splicing selecting
[1:28:59] quotes together in a way that is not
[1:29:01] established in
[1:29:03] scripture putting a cow on the
[1:29:08] roof you understanding it's going on
[1:29:12] it's taking place right
[1:29:14] now one of the last signs that elij one
[1:29:17] of the last signs that the world will
[1:29:19] receive is Elijah's
[1:29:20] Ministry that is why it it has the last
[1:29:25] sign and it and and most of it it is
[1:29:29] because that word is now in The Bride As
[1:29:33] prophesied now they say that he went off
[1:29:36] at the end of his ministry talking about
[1:29:39] brother brandham here the prophet but
[1:29:41] that's when he brought the correct word
[1:29:44] the pure word to bring us back to the
[1:29:47] Faith of Our Fathers but because they
[1:29:51] loved their TR
[1:29:52] Traditions more than they love the word
[1:29:54] of
[1:29:56] God they said he went off but he was
[1:30:00] just he was just getting it right it
[1:30:04] brought us the focus the bride the
[1:30:08] focus that she needed to get ready for
[1:30:11] the Rapture it didn't go off it was the
[1:30:15] pure
[1:30:16] word that was brought to us the pure
[1:30:18] Faith the perfect faith it brought the
[1:30:21] Bri the
[1:30:23] focus amen the focus to overcome the
[1:30:27] focus to take this
[1:30:29] word the focus to to Smite every enemy
[1:30:33] and every unclean spirit and every demon
[1:30:35] power and every level that Satan will
[1:30:39] try to hit her at the religious level
[1:30:42] the worldly level level the human level
[1:30:45] every
[1:30:46] level musicians
[1:30:50] come you know no we are living at the
[1:30:52] end time it is this age that the church
[1:30:55] is going to come
[1:30:57] together and as they are even now
[1:31:00] controlling the world politics they will
[1:31:02] soon control the finances of the world
[1:31:06] it's happening now then if you don't
[1:31:09] belong to the world organization of
[1:31:11] churches you won't be able to buy or
[1:31:15] sell you will lose
[1:31:18] all those who stay true to God's word
[1:31:21] will keep their garments clean from the
[1:31:23] defilement of this world system of
[1:31:26] church order will be physically deprived
[1:31:29] or of lacking
[1:31:31] something oh you talk about a testing
[1:31:34] time coming upon the Bride of Jesus

[1:31:50] that word to speak things into existence
[1:31:53] is g to come upon her let me tell you
[1:31:57] don't think that you can be in this
[1:32:00] message my brothers be in Christ be in

[1:32:11] don't have Christ you know you don't
[1:32:14] have that Revelation inside of you to

[1:32:17] give in because your flesh is going to
[1:32:19] give in because you never overc came
[1:32:22] that flesh but the Bride of Jesus Christ
