[42:06] we know that we were in the house of God
[42:09] in the heavens together
[42:11] and therefore brought together from from
[42:15] the East the western North in the South
[42:18] that's why brother Branham loved that
[42:20] song because he recognized that those
[42:23] elected saints of God those ones that
[42:28] were with him his children that were
[42:30] with him and in him are called together
[42:34] when they hear the familiarity of the
[42:37] voice that called them and spoke to them
[42:40] in the morning coming in the evening
[42:43] time under inspiration of the evening
[42:47] Messenger to call us and bring us to
[42:51] attention of his word and now that we
[42:55] are here as Spirit beings that were once
[42:59] in God the great spirit
[43:02] sent down to the Earth to live down here
[43:05] and to be in human bodies with a plan
[43:10] with a purpose for his glory and then
[43:14] now that we are made manifest In the
[43:18] Flesh the flesh fails us was our brother
[43:21] preached the other night the flesh may
[43:23] be failing you but your real identity is
[43:27] you're not identified by your actions on
[43:30] the outside and the things that happen
[43:32] in your being on the outside you're
[43:34] identified by the spirit of God working
[43:38] through you by the seed of life by the
[43:41] gene of God making itself manifest
[43:44] through you and I'm so glad for that
[43:46] that we don't live on the condemnation
[43:49] but we live under grace justification
[43:53] just as you're never done it in the
[43:55] first place because you never did the
[43:58] spirit and you never did your flesh your
[44:01] body you get influence your imagination
[44:04] your your memories your thoughts
[44:07] everything else took you off from the
[44:10] word of God but the word of God comes
[44:13] and God sends his preachers this men of
[44:16] God whoever they are and tries to bring
[44:20] us back to line us up with the word so
[44:23] that he can take us back where we come
[44:26] from
[44:27] but we say we are together again that's
[44:30] because here we are
[44:32] gathered together in this house
[44:35] uh you know we may not be all that we
[44:38] want to be on the Earth
[44:41] we're trying to be the best that we can
[44:44] be on the earth and we may never be
[44:48] fully what we want to be but we are who
[44:52] God says we are
[44:55] my son my daughter my child it doesn't
[45:00] matter how the devil tries to paint you
[45:03] blacken your name whatever he wants to
[45:05] do whatever he wants to call you he can
[45:07] call you what he wants he's only going
[45:09] to do that for age of time but time
[45:12] passes and blends right into eternity
[45:15] amen and that will all pass away praise
[45:19] the Lord hallelujah thank you so much
[45:21] God bless you all appreciate you amen
[45:24] God bless you thank you so much for the
[45:26] music we appreciate you all amen God is
[45:29] good isn't he
[45:30] praise the name of the Lord he's the
[45:32] same yesterday to the end forever praise
[45:36] God last week
[45:39] we started on the subject
[45:42] of God uh you know shaping The Living
[45:46] Stones not not rocks that were put in
[45:50] the Solomon's Temple back there but
[45:52] living stones placed into his Heavenly
[45:56] Temple where he you know Solomon said
[46:00] I'll build you a house you're gonna
[46:01] build me a house the heaven the heavens
[46:03] can't contain me I own everything so are
[46:07] you going to build me up anyway go ahead
[46:08] but that's not my house right so God
[46:12] built building his house built his house
[46:15] and is building his house and we know
[46:18] that each one of us is one of those
[46:20] stones that comes for to fit in God's
[46:24] Temple he tries to fit you in the
[46:26] Earthly house the church right down here
[46:28] as an example or a symbol of how he will
[46:32] fit us into his Heavenly uh his Heavenly
[46:36] Home his Heavenly house which the Bible
[46:39] says you are the Temple of the living
[46:42] God as a book of Revelation says the
[46:45] voice cried out from the throne saying
[46:47] and now the habitation of God is with
[46:51] men
[46:52] and I will dwell in them and they shall
[46:57] be my people and I will be their God
[47:01] hallelujah so he has this Great temple
[47:05] yet we are living in but uh for us to
[47:09] take our place positionally in the body
[47:12] of Jesus Christ he has to shape us
[47:16] and last week we touched on the fact
[47:19] that God uses uh his stone masons to to
[47:24] shape us and sometimes the pastor
[47:27] preaches a messaging or says something
[47:30] that God will make him even say some
[47:32] things deliberately to get you mad to
[47:34] get you angry sometimes you get you sad
[47:37] you know God will make that man say all
[47:42] kinds of things that you don't know what
[47:44] in the world what's wrong with this
[47:46] person the person themselves don't know
[47:48] what's wrong with them because it's not
[47:50] that you know the man is God
[47:54] but the devil is in the world and he's
[47:57] so cunning that he will play with
[48:00] people's mind and say oh that's just him
[48:01] trying to make an excuse for his
[48:03] foolishness or his this or his death oh
[48:06] my goodness and it's something there to
[48:08] sit and listen and know what the devil
[48:12] is doing and you have to leave it alone
[48:13] and how people's minds are working and
[48:16] going like that
[48:17] my goodness it's something else but
[48:20] that's the way God works he's shaping us
[48:23] and using the ministerial gifts that he
[48:28] has placed in the church to shape us
[48:31] amen praise God so it is important that
[48:36] we submit ourselves to the ministry
[48:39] gifts of God not as the man But as God
[48:44] working through those men for his glory
[48:47] and for his honor amen so of course a
[48:52] lot of uh of ministers take abuse take
[48:56] advantage of that and and a spiritual
[48:59] child abuse goes on and we're not here
[49:02] for that we're never here for that but
[49:05] any parent knows no matter how they love
[49:07] their child and if they do really love
[49:09] their child then their love will be both
[49:13] comforting and they're going to be
[49:15] corrective
[49:16] it'll also know when to warn and when to
[49:21] whip
[49:22] you know God does that and that's the
[49:26] way he does praise the Lord amen let's
[49:29] read our scripture first uh before we
[49:33] start talking about these things and
[49:37] make a go one step further
[49:40] and
[49:42] um I wanted to end it all today but
[49:45] um there's one more uh message that has
[49:49] to comfort from this I pray the Lord
[49:52] will make the way for that we'll read
[49:54] out of uh Hebrews chapter 12.
[49:59] and reading from verse 25 right to 29.
[50:08] let's read together
[50:10] see that ye refuse not him that speak it
[50:15] for if they escape not who refuse him
[50:19] that spake on Earth
[50:22] much more shall not re-escape if we turn
[50:26] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[50:30] you know that's talking about those that
[50:33] refuse when he spoke from Earth to Moses
[50:36] and they refuse and reject that and
[50:40] saying all and Moses you go and carve
[50:43] that stuff yourself and bring it down
[50:45] the air because you want to have
[50:47] influence and you want to bless the this
[50:50] and that the people and so on like that
[50:52] we like the devil does he puts it off on
[50:55] demand and God says no you refuse him
[50:58] back there but now that messenger from
[51:02] Heaven has come down
[51:04] and he's speaking again
[51:06] and when he speaks with much more shall
[51:11] not we escape if we turn away from him
[51:15] that speaketh from heaven
[51:17] amen praise the Lord glory to God whose
[51:22] voice then shook the Earth
[51:25] but now
[51:27] he had promised saying yet once more I
[51:31] shake not the Earth but also the heaven
[51:35] praise God Amen
[51:39] and this word yet once more
[51:42] signifies the removing of those things
[51:46] that are Satan or supposed to be shaken
[51:50] as those things which are made that
[51:54] those things which cannot be shaken
[51:57] shall remain blessed be the name of the
[52:00] Lord hallelujah amen wherefore we
[52:05] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[52:09] moved let us have Grace whereby we may
[52:13] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[52:18] godly fear
[52:22] for our God
[52:24] is a consuming fire praise the Lord a
[52:28] gracious Heavenly Father uh simply we we
[52:32] have just read your word and father we
[52:35] ask that the great Holy Spirit who moved
[52:39] on the face of the waters in rev Genesis
[52:43] 1 the spirit of God moved upon the face
[52:47] of the word Waters and then God said let
[52:51] there be light grant that father that
[52:54] the same angel that moved upon the
[52:57] waters in the times of Jesus that
[53:00] stepped forth and asked do you want to
[53:03] be healed do you want to be well and
[53:07] this one who stirred the waters thank
[53:10] you Lord is here again with us today and
[53:13] we give you a blessing and praise and
[53:15] honor as we come together in Jesus name
[53:18] for his glory
[53:20] amen and amen God bless you please be
[53:23] seated
[53:30] uh you know uh first of all I spoke of
[53:33] God shaping his stones on his kingdom
[53:37] and from the point of view God using men
[53:40] to shake shape these Stones
[53:44] um for to fit into his kingdoms
[53:48] but we know that God also shaped the
[53:51] Earth the entire universe and the World
[53:55] by his word
[53:57] he shaped it by the sharp tool of his
[54:01] word
[54:02] and the voice of God as the book of
[54:06] Psalms will tell you shake at the Earth
[54:10] the Thundering voice of the Lord causes
[54:14] the mountains to quake and the cities of
[54:17] Lebanon began to break because of the
[54:20] voice of the Living God Amen Hallelujah
[54:23] you know in the beginning God spoke the
[54:26] word and scientists will tell you all of
[54:29] us there was a Ice Age there was ages
[54:33] where God carved and chopped out the
[54:37] Earth by using earthquakes and using uh
[54:41] you know these various elements Amen to
[54:45] cause some parts to go low and other
[54:47] parts to go high and become a mountain
[54:49] but he uses that by his voice
[54:53] and his voice shaped the entire Earth
[54:56] and the universe it placed every tree
[55:00] and every object that he wanted right
[55:04] where it ought to be he knew where he
[55:07] wanted a certain type of Pine Tree on
[55:09] top and if you brought it down to the
[55:12] valley it would survive because it
[55:14] wasn't made to survive down there in the
[55:17] world it was made to survive on the
[55:21] mountain top so God caused the entire
[55:24] Earth the world to be framed by his
[55:29] voice which is the word Hebrews 11 3 for
[55:34] we understand
[55:36] that by faith the worlds were framed by
[55:43] the word of God
[55:44] the worlds were shaped they were framed
[55:48] by the voice of God hallelujah and he
[55:52] says we know that by faith that's how we
[55:56] know by a revelation he knew that the
[55:59] world was shaped and formed by the word
[56:03] of God now just as much as God shape the
[56:09] world the natural world by his voice by
[56:12] his word
[56:13] God is taking the bride to another level
[56:18] not where only man being used to shape
[56:23] those stones
[56:24] but he is shaping the Stones by his own
[56:29] voice
[56:30] he's shaping it again and doing it for
[56:33] his glory so I want to talk about
[56:36] God's Champion by shaking
[56:40] he is shaping Us by shaking us just as
[56:45] much as he did the same thing in the
[56:48] world out there praise the Lord now to
[56:51] quote brother Branham getting into the
[56:54] spirit
[56:55] oh there's my friend Joseph goes Boze he
[57:02] always told me years ago brother Branham
[57:06] we always I always have this feeling in
[57:10] my heart that I want to see Chicago
[57:13] shook
[57:15] I want to see Chicago shock amen
[57:21] and I turned to him and said Brother
[57:24] Joseph Brother Joseph
[57:26] your great desire
[57:29] has already been fulfilled
[57:34] you see uh but you see you don't fully
[57:39] understand it
[57:41] you see oh my because when you talk
[57:45] about shaking a city
[57:47] shaking a nation that doesn't mean God
[57:51] is going to shake that Atomic father
[57:55] that is out there running around it
[57:58] means that he is checking his bride
[58:02] amen the bride is the one that gets the
[58:06] shaking
[58:07] that's not that ecclesiastial group it's
[58:12] not the body of Christ the church world
[58:15] no matter what denominational dams they
[58:17] give themselves that's not what he is
[58:20] shaking
[58:21] no sir see he is shaking his elect and
[58:26] that's the one the body of Christ that
[58:30] shakes he shakes to get it back in line
[58:35] again with his War he wants to get her
[58:40] back in line with his word now you can
[58:43] think on that they were once in line but
[58:45] now they're out of line and he's
[58:47] bringing them back in line with his word
[58:50] now brother bran was speaking again
[58:54] I am convinced
[58:57] that Chicago has already been shook
[59:02] amen not the Canon father
[59:06] not these great buildings they have out
[59:09] there great skyscrapers up and down the
[59:13] street not these women immorally dressed
[59:18] not these men these drunks and carrying
[59:23] on them who even call themselves
[59:26] Christians and going to church and then
[59:30] go eat some light bread and make
[59:34] something out of that I don't believe in
[59:36] that stuff go into the church belching
[59:40] whiskey all kinds of stuff on their
[59:42] breath think of it then go out and take
[59:47] communion and then have their name on
[59:51] the church book amen and then call
[59:55] themselves Christian I don't believe in
[59:58] that I believe the Church of Jesus
[1:00:01] Christ is a called out group do you
[1:00:03] believe that
[1:00:04] I believe that the Church of Jesus
[1:00:08] Christ is a Sanctified group Sanctified
[1:00:12] by the blood of Jesus Christ I believe
[1:00:15] she is set aside for service I believe
[1:00:19] the things that we are now seeing if you
[1:00:24] can understand that is the appearing of
[1:00:28] Jesus Christ
[1:00:30] in our midst today do you believe that
[1:00:34] [Music]
[1:00:35] hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah
[1:00:39] now you see what he's talking about that
[1:00:42] um you know uh one time he asked brother
[1:00:46] Billy Paul he says all the meetings were
[1:00:49] wonderful how many people do you think
[1:00:51] understood what I preached on and he
[1:00:54] turned around and said well you know oh
[1:00:57] they all understood that's why they were
[1:00:59] shouting and praising God and giving
[1:01:01] glory in the spirit of God falling like
[1:01:04] that and the other and he says
[1:01:09] how many do you really think understood
[1:01:13] what I preached about and Billy Paul
[1:01:17] said I don't know I don't know he says
[1:01:19] only that many
[1:01:22] and you're talking about thousands and
[1:01:25] thousands of people in there when he
[1:01:29] said that but let's go on and you'll
[1:01:31] understand further here amen hallelujah
[1:01:35] now he was trying to tell brother uh
[1:01:39] Madison Bose
[1:01:41] Chicago has already been shook
[1:01:44] but uh you are looking and saying that
[1:01:49] you're waiting for it to be shaken it's
[1:01:53] already been shook it's just you didn't
[1:01:55] recognize that it was shook because the
[1:01:59] shaken is not those thousands of people
[1:02:01] that were shaking under the holy ghost
[1:02:03] in the building is the ones that he
[1:02:08] elect in there that were shaken by the
[1:02:10] word of God
[1:02:12] because that's when the spirit began to
[1:02:14] shake some people loose from
[1:02:17] denominational ideas and beliefs they
[1:02:20] had in their mind and the Word was
[1:02:22] shaking them to pull them away from that
[1:02:25] that they can recognize the word for
[1:02:28] their day recognize what God is doing
[1:02:31] and are they our time by his Great and
[1:02:35] Mighty Holy Spirit hallelujah amen and I
[1:02:39] believe the same thing is happening
[1:02:41] today do you believe that
[1:02:44] amen because you know many people who
[1:02:49] still claim to be the bride
[1:02:51] and in this message they're still
[1:02:54] looking for a shaking coming up the road
[1:02:56] somewhere up there
[1:02:58] but uh that's not bad but the fact is
[1:03:03] you're doing that because you've been
[1:03:07] trapped by a Pentecostal view of what's
[1:03:13] supposed to happen
[1:03:14] what do I mean the Pentecostal view of
[1:03:18] what they thought was going to be the
[1:03:20] Rapture was was was a lightning or a
[1:03:24] trumpet blown or or on a certain morning
[1:03:28] and all of a sudden Graves crack and as
[1:03:31] the graves crack people are rising up
[1:03:34] with white knight gongs on and slowly
[1:03:37] going drifting up into the heavens we
[1:03:41] come to understand by the opening of the
[1:03:44] World by a prophetic Ministry that's not
[1:03:48] the case
[1:03:50] amen that's not the case absolutely not
[1:03:54] that's not the way it's going to be but
[1:03:56] for many years that's the way we viewed
[1:04:00] it
[1:04:00] even when he came in the message we
[1:04:03] viewed it that way until he preached
[1:04:06] they about the Rapture and the trees
[1:04:10] stages of the Rapture the show The Voice
[1:04:12] the trumpet The Crawling Away by the
[1:04:15] grace of God then we begin to glimmer of
[1:04:18] understanding of what it was
[1:04:21] but while we were in this message we
[1:04:25] still have the Pentecostal point of view
[1:04:28] because that's the only frame of
[1:04:31] reference I'm going to slow down a
[1:04:33] little bit because I want you to get
[1:04:36] what I'm saying
[1:04:38] see we come with that background
[1:04:42] of a Pentecostal environment we're
[1:04:46] looking at things with that Focus
[1:04:49] so when God says this we see it that way
[1:04:53] but that's not the way of the word right
[1:04:57] listen praise the Lord so we understand
[1:05:00] that because praise the Lord so we we
[1:05:04] think that we got to have a shaking in
[1:05:06] the bride with filled with a lot of
[1:05:08] emotions
[1:05:09] and there will be emotions and there
[1:05:12] will be a lot of emotions praise the
[1:05:15] name of the Lord see but you see the end
[1:05:18] time evangelism is shaking the Bride of
[1:05:22] Jesus Christ
[1:05:23] and it's already shaking the bride right
[1:05:26] now
[1:05:28] preaching like this
[1:05:30] is already shaking the brain
[1:05:34] you might not recognize it
[1:05:36] but it's shaking the brain
[1:05:39] the Devils who uh and whips who sit
[1:05:44] around and hang around
[1:05:46] the church building on the church house
[1:05:50] praise God yes sir don't you think you
[1:05:53] alone come to church the devil is in
[1:05:55] church regularly more than you he's
[1:05:59] always there he's ready there to listen
[1:06:02] he's ready there to obstruct to
[1:06:05] undermine he's always there trying to
[1:06:08] undermine the kingdom of God to sort
[1:06:11] doubt fear or whatever it can
[1:06:14] but I want you to know this my friends
[1:06:17] many people are acting and saying that
[1:06:20] way because they don't already recognize
[1:06:24] like brother Branham said to brother
[1:06:26] Madison what has happened and what is
[1:06:30] happening by the grace of God hallelujah
[1:06:34] we're already sitting right here but let
[1:06:36] me tell you Philistines are running left
[1:06:37] and right devils are scattering
[1:06:39] everywhere because of this word they
[1:06:42] don't want to deal with this word of God
[1:06:43] it scatters them left right and Center
[1:06:46] amen and the bride of Christ is the one
[1:06:51] that's receiving that word
[1:06:53] I think there's a song that goes
[1:06:55] something like God's church is the power
[1:06:58] that's shaking this hour is that what it
[1:07:01] says
[1:07:02] but that's not so that's what uh when I
[1:07:06] was studying there brother to me says
[1:07:07] that's not so in a way that's so but
[1:07:11] that's not what it is God's word is the
[1:07:14] power that's checking this hour
[1:07:17] amen that day of redemption is nigh
[1:07:20] God's word is what shakes the Church the
[1:07:25] true elect bride of Christ is shaking by
[1:07:28] the word nothing else influences her
[1:07:31] nothing else causes her to move anyway
[1:07:34] but God's word checks the Bride of Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ
[1:07:39] amen praise the name of the Lord yes sir
[1:07:43] o praise God I tell you right now she's
[1:07:46] being chopped she's being healed out she
[1:07:50] has been shaken by the word of God
[1:07:53] hallelujah amen look over here I want to
[1:07:57] go to this marvelous wonderful book here
[1:08:00] I didn't have to bring it in but um
[1:08:04] you know I was getting frustrated
[1:08:06] searching and searching for the quote on
[1:08:08] the computer so I just shut it down and
[1:08:10] went to find this old book here uh where
[1:08:14] he said
[1:08:15] now when a mother Eagle builds her nest
[1:08:19] she gets Vines and sticks and leaves and
[1:08:24] pieces of wood and even Briars Thorns
[1:08:29] she is very careful she doesn't want her
[1:08:32] babies to be pierced by the Briars or
[1:08:36] have pieces of sticks poking and poking
[1:08:38] at them now remember uh maybe about
[1:08:42] 20 minutes before he had said you know
[1:08:45] God is the is a great the great ego
[1:08:48] do you know God is a great Eagle then he
[1:08:51] moves on and he's now talking about an
[1:08:53] eagle again but he's saying this Eagle
[1:08:55] likes to build her nest and when they
[1:08:58] build a nest they put the young ones in
[1:09:00] the nest but they make sure that the
[1:09:02] nest is nice and comfortable that they
[1:09:05] can fit in there see oh my so what does
[1:09:09] she do she finds a lamb and slays it
[1:09:13] amen he's talking about God and Jesus
[1:09:16] Christ and why Jesus Christ had to die
[1:09:19] but he's telling just the story and if
[1:09:21] you're not listening you won't
[1:09:23] understand what he's talking about you
[1:09:25] think he's talking about an eagle in the
[1:09:26] tree or something but here it is now she
[1:09:30] finds that lamb shreds it takes the skin
[1:09:34] to the nest and works it around until
[1:09:37] she has that Nest real cozy and they
[1:09:41] feel comfortable her babies are now
[1:09:44] comfortable see and that's what God does
[1:09:48] oh my when God sees we are born again he
[1:09:54] watches during the service to see how we
[1:09:59] will act and what we will do during that
[1:10:03] service don't you ever forget that but
[1:10:06] he will prepare a nest for you there in
[1:10:09] his kingdom
[1:10:10] have you been comfortable in this church
[1:10:13] have you been comfortable under the
[1:10:16] ministry of the word of God
[1:10:18] praise the Lord hallelujah now then we
[1:10:23] understand
[1:10:24] after a while she watches her Eagles and
[1:10:28] when they are fully feathered when she
[1:10:31] begins to think now they are starting to
[1:10:35] mature sufficiently then she
[1:10:39] deliberately begins to shake that nest
[1:10:43] and that's what the spirit of God wants
[1:10:47] to do in our hearts and in our lives
[1:10:50] is to shake the nest and by shaking
[1:10:53] unless he shapes the bride he shapes
[1:10:57] those little ones the character their
[1:11:00] strength their confidence their faith
[1:11:02] and their own ability amen praise God
[1:11:06] hallelujah or yes amen so she will shake
[1:11:12] the nest doing what she's shaking loose
[1:11:15] shaking all the loose feathers that are
[1:11:19] on them all your loose ideas
[1:11:22] God wants to shake them loose
[1:11:25] that we must recognize young changing
[1:11:28] word of the Living God Amen why is she
[1:11:32] doing that she's getting them ready for
[1:11:36] a flight
[1:11:37] but it is to be there so low flight
[1:11:43] you see every true servant of God has to
[1:11:47] do the same thing
[1:11:50] he has to shake loose all those around
[1:11:55] him not alienate but shake them loose
[1:11:58] because they have to step out on their
[1:12:00] own praise the Lord hallelujah not run
[1:12:04] back to Mama and ask her should I flap
[1:12:08] my wings no they don't have time for
[1:12:10] that you're falling fast and if you
[1:12:12] don't somehow flap them you're going to
[1:12:14] crash on the rocks or something so so so
[1:12:17] she she deliberately shakes The Nest
[1:12:20] throws them out of the nest shake it say
[1:12:23] you know praise the Lord God Will Make A
[1:12:26] man of God see all kinds of things what
[1:12:28] shake your shake you in the nest cause
[1:12:30] you to run out there and say what is
[1:12:32] that I can't take that no more but it's
[1:12:35] the spirit of God shaking the nest
[1:12:38] so that you will now want to make a soul
[1:12:41] of light
[1:12:43] praise the Lord hallelujah yes oh my
[1:12:47] she's shaking that Nest getting them
[1:12:50] ready for their soul of light and them
[1:12:54] little Eagles somehow they know are
[1:12:58] doing that something is fixing to happen
[1:13:01] because they are also eagles they feel
[1:13:05] the blast of the mighty rushing Winds of
[1:13:08] God and the nest is him for a shaking
[1:13:11] amen I believe this Nest is in for a
[1:13:15] shaking
[1:13:16] it has had a shaking it's having a
[1:13:19] shaking it's in for us shaking by the
[1:13:22] grace of God
[1:13:24] Hallelujah then she gives a certain
[1:13:27] scream and those baby eagles oh my know
[1:13:32] how to place their feet in her wings you
[1:13:36] see brother Branham says you know those
[1:13:40] feathers are a type of the promises of
[1:13:43] God now they're taking the promises for
[1:13:44] themselves
[1:13:46] they're holding to the word for
[1:13:48] themselves
[1:13:49] they are their faith is standing braced
[1:13:53] not their mother's Faith brace them like
[1:13:56] you brace a plant until it comes to full
[1:13:58] strength no the mothers the pastors
[1:14:01] strengthened Faith braced you until you
[1:14:04] get to that point but when you get to
[1:14:07] that point then he wants your eyes on
[1:14:10] Jesus Christ
[1:14:11] so he's got to shake your loose that you
[1:14:15] recognize Jesus Christ amen Look Away to
[1:14:18] Jesus amen blessed be the name of the
[1:14:21] Lord God your mind she shakes them off
[1:14:25] then off they go and when they get up
[1:14:29] high amen when she gets them up there
[1:14:33] realize you would think oh my but she
[1:14:38] then shakes them off
[1:14:40] amen when they're at that height he says
[1:14:44] it again here right when they are in the
[1:14:47] middle of the air at that height then
[1:14:50] she shakes them off amen but she doesn't
[1:14:54] leave them
[1:14:56] he says she's circling and she's
[1:14:58] watching
[1:14:59] she's watching how they're how they
[1:15:02] adjust to the shaking off how they
[1:15:05] adjust to the soul of flight that
[1:15:08] they're now got to make God is shaping
[1:15:10] them by shaking them off and that's what
[1:15:13] I'm talking about here today sometimes
[1:15:15] that's the way sometimes a parent has to
[1:15:18] do with with their children they have to
[1:15:21] say well enough is enough I'm not paying
[1:15:23] you no more attention but even though
[1:15:25] they say that they're still watching
[1:15:27] from the side of their eyes amen praise
[1:15:30] God but God has to shake us off I mean
[1:15:33] we genuinely have to stand on our own
[1:15:37] praise God not looking back over your
[1:15:39] shoulder at the pastor not looking over
[1:15:42] the shoulder over here to see if brother
[1:15:43] so and so not looking over here to see
[1:15:46] if Daddy or Mommy no but now you're
[1:15:50] standing on your own two feet
[1:15:52] while you're coming to maturity
[1:15:55] you're coming to the maturity of the
[1:15:57] word of God
[1:15:59] and that's where the word of God is
[1:16:01] taking us right now into Divine maturity
[1:16:04] amen of character and identifying whose
[1:16:09] character you have in you
[1:16:12] amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:16:14] shopping and shaping and bringing her to
[1:16:18] a right place into the house of God
[1:16:21] hallelujah remember when she shakes them
[1:16:25] off she doesn't just leave them but she
[1:16:28] makes a big circle
[1:16:31] but she is watching
[1:16:33] see she's watching and she leaves them
[1:16:36] that they will come together and get one
[1:16:40] great big old-fashioned Pentecostal
[1:16:43] Jubilee among themselves when they begin
[1:16:46] to recognize I can do what Mama used to
[1:16:49] do I can do what Daddy used to do I can
[1:16:53] do it I can do it
[1:16:55] like you like the all you know the story
[1:16:58] of the old little train so I think I
[1:17:00] could I think I could and then when he
[1:17:03] made it to the top I know I can I know I
[1:17:06] can't I know I can amen you made it over
[1:17:09] the other side by the grace of the
[1:17:12] Living God hallelujah amen oh my praise
[1:17:18] God hallelujah he says remember
[1:17:23] Joseph said to me
[1:17:26] I want to see Chicago shook
[1:17:31] and I also said to him Brother Joseph
[1:17:34] God Don't Lie
[1:17:37] you have already seen Chicago shock
[1:17:42] amen but you see the natural man I
[1:17:44] didn't see any building Shake
[1:17:46] right
[1:17:49] I didn't see I just see people coming
[1:17:52] into meetings and they were shaking and
[1:17:54] this and that and the other but you know
[1:17:57] because people are buildings right so so
[1:18:00] I didn't see building Shake I didn't see
[1:18:02] people shake like that and everything
[1:18:04] else like that but you see oh my but you
[1:18:08] see now
[1:18:10] I want you to know
[1:18:13] Joseph
[1:18:15] I Joseph
[1:18:17] don't you realize that it is shaking
[1:18:21] it's already shaking God is Not shaking
[1:18:25] the rubbish that is out there
[1:18:28] that he's going to destroy
[1:18:30] you know in Israel we passed over the
[1:18:33] valley of gehenna
[1:18:35] that is where in the old days they took
[1:18:38] the rubbish and burnt it
[1:18:40] and that is what in a way he's not
[1:18:42] saying that telling that whole thing but
[1:18:44] that's what he's thinking about all the
[1:18:48] rubbish that's on the earth amen uh it's
[1:18:52] going to be going into gehenna or hell
[1:18:55] where it will be burnt amen my you see
[1:19:00] the rest of that is already being
[1:19:05] destroyed going to be destroyed but the
[1:19:08] bride is checking
[1:19:12] there was only
[1:19:14] 120 out of the millions in an upper room
[1:19:18] when their shaking came
[1:19:21] amen yes sir oh my that's right that's
[1:19:26] what he does the shaking is in the
[1:19:30] people
[1:19:31] that's where the real shaking goes on
[1:19:34] it's in the elect
[1:19:36] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:19:39] where is the shaking going on within the
[1:19:42] hearts of the elect
[1:19:44] I don't know about you but it shook me
[1:19:47] away from all my Pentecostal beliefs not
[1:19:51] only that I got him a message and bit by
[1:19:54] bit he chipped he chipped he checked and
[1:19:57] began to shake me away from my old
[1:20:00] message beliefs that were contrary to
[1:20:03] the word of God
[1:20:05] oh my God checking us and shaping Us by
[1:20:10] the revelation of the word of God God's
[1:20:13] word is the power that shaken this hour
[1:20:16] the day of redemption the Rapture is
[1:20:19] nigh brother sister hallelujah amen so
[1:20:23] the shaking is in the hearts of God's
[1:20:26] people praise God remember down there
[1:20:31] there was a Baptist preacher
[1:20:34] in the Bible whose name was Apollos
[1:20:37] that's not brother Branham is saying
[1:20:39] that here amen whose name was Apollos
[1:20:42] and he
[1:20:44] hadn't received the Holy Ghost
[1:20:47] and wasn't baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:20:49] Christ
[1:20:50] Paul passing through the upper course of
[1:20:53] Ephesus find this church and it was a
[1:20:57] mighty Church the Bible speaks of it
[1:21:00] amen and this he said have you received
[1:21:04] the Holy Ghost
[1:21:06] since you believed
[1:21:07] and therefore he says remember he said
[1:21:11] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:21:13] you believe in the middle of them while
[1:21:15] they were shouting while they were
[1:21:18] praising God while they were having a
[1:21:21] wonderful time and saying oh my and he
[1:21:26] comes saying have you received the Holy
[1:21:30] Ghost
[1:21:30] isn't that so much something like today
[1:21:33] while people shouting and having a great
[1:21:36] time nothing's wrong with that but he
[1:21:38] said with all of that is good but have
[1:21:40] you received the Holy Ghost
[1:21:42] you see because they are thinking the
[1:21:46] Holy Ghost supposed to be like it was on
[1:21:51] the first day of Pentecost
[1:21:53] and they didn't even understand that
[1:21:55] because what the apostles really got
[1:21:58] brother Branham said was the Revelation
[1:22:01] from Heaven struck their hearts and they
[1:22:04] got so excited to try to talk to one
[1:22:08] another they couldn't speak to one
[1:22:09] another it wasn't the tongues that
[1:22:12] showed they were filled with the Holy
[1:22:13] Ghost but the reception of divine
[1:22:16] understanding by Revelation filled them
[1:22:19] with the Holy Ghost then that brought
[1:22:21] the emotions and that brought the
[1:22:24] praising on the shouting of the glory of
[1:22:25] God hallelujah that's why Paul was
[1:22:28] saying he says if your Shout Shout with
[1:22:31] the understanding you're saying sing
[1:22:32] with the understanding if you read pray
[1:22:34] whatever you do do it with the
[1:22:36] Revelation in you why are you doing it
[1:22:39] or else you just shout into the wind
[1:22:41] you're just beating uh keep him a whole
[1:22:44] lot of noise and it's not the real Holy
[1:22:46] Ghost amen praise God Amen yes sir so
[1:22:52] the real revelation is Revival is a
[1:22:56] Revival caused by Revelation within the
[1:23:01] hearts of God's people
[1:23:03] praise the name of the Lord and that's
[1:23:06] why uh you don't have to see me walk up
[1:23:09] here and first perform a miracle
[1:23:11] before you start praising God for his
[1:23:15] word because the word of God as it comes
[1:23:18] forth within itself you recognize
[1:23:22] there's something going on and your
[1:23:25] natural mind can't grasp it and you
[1:23:27] never will grasp it because Paul calls
[1:23:30] that the mystery of preaching amen the
[1:23:33] mystery of preaching is the holy spirit
[1:23:36] working and doing that praise God so the
[1:23:40] bride's Revival is now going on
[1:23:44] what is going on with him praise the
[1:23:47] name of the Lord within the hearts of
[1:23:49] men praise God so because why I don't
[1:23:53] know about you but I have been shaken by
[1:23:56] by your pouring of the word of God upon
[1:24:00] my life upon your hearts what I see God
[1:24:03] doing in your life I received an
[1:24:05] outpouring of that brother sister praise
[1:24:07] the name of the Lord amen praise God
[1:24:10] hallelujah amen so I I praise him
[1:24:14] because he has chapter shaped us healed
[1:24:18] us oh my body are pouring of his word
[1:24:20] that we might be brought into Conformity
[1:24:24] of the image of Jesus Christ
[1:24:27] hallelujah amen this is a kind of an
[1:24:32] image he was showing you parts of his
[1:24:34] personality that that uh of course he
[1:24:38] can't show you all being God God is
[1:24:39] everything but he just showed you the
[1:24:41] main parts of his personality and and
[1:24:44] even if you get that it it will help you
[1:24:47] praise God it will help you to really be
[1:24:51] Christ's light but you don't get that by
[1:24:54] going out on the street and I'm buying
[1:24:56] it or adding it to yourself it's it's
[1:24:59] the gene the seed of God in you which is
[1:25:03] Jesus part of himself within you when
[1:25:07] the Revelation moisture of the word
[1:25:10] strikes that it comes to life and when
[1:25:13] it comes to life every day like every
[1:25:16] plant will do it begins to add a leaf a
[1:25:19] bond a leaf and it begins to add because
[1:25:22] it comes from within itself not from
[1:25:25] outside but from within itself it begins
[1:25:28] to grow and express and manifest and
[1:25:32] then you can see the identification of
[1:25:35] what kind of a plant it really is what
[1:25:37] kind of a seed did it come from
[1:25:39] Hallelujah because the holy spirit is
[1:25:42] doing that praise God when Paul told
[1:25:46] them have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:25:48] they said we were baptized under John
[1:25:52] amen and they said that he said that
[1:25:55] don't work no more
[1:25:57] God you've got to be baptized all over
[1:26:00] again
[1:26:00] praise the Lord oh my I was baptized
[1:26:03] when I came in a message amen that don't
[1:26:07] work no more
[1:26:08] amen now you you got to receive the Holy
[1:26:11] Ghost
[1:26:12] the Holy Ghost praise the Lord praise
[1:26:15] God now just look on that thought
[1:26:17] receiving the Holy Ghost how it was
[1:26:19] looked at by Wesley
[1:26:22] amen he believed you have to express a
[1:26:25] Sanctified life and that proved you that
[1:26:27] the Holy Ghost and come to the lutherans
[1:26:30] the Westlands you come down to
[1:26:34] Pentecostals we receive the Holy Ghost
[1:26:36] you have to speak in tongues amen you
[1:26:39] come down to the message now and the
[1:26:41] prophet says no you have to express a
[1:26:44] christ-like life
[1:26:46] it's not the tongue of the shoe it's the
[1:26:50] whole shoe it's him you know not part
[1:26:53] the peace here and a peace there and a
[1:26:55] peace there instead you create a
[1:26:57] Frankenstein I mean National
[1:26:59] presentation uh no you you have to
[1:27:02] present Christ
[1:27:04] and then you know he'll turn around and
[1:27:06] say but how are you going to present
[1:27:08] Christ it's like a a dirty pot trying to
[1:27:12] produce something pure no you come
[1:27:16] predestinated with that seed of life
[1:27:19] within you
[1:27:21] and what you have to do is to believe
[1:27:23] the Waters of the world let therefore
[1:27:26] present water from the rock drench your
[1:27:29] soul and bring forth the life that is
[1:27:32] already in you
[1:27:34] and when that begins to express itself
[1:27:36] which is Christ in you your hope of
[1:27:39] glory when it begins to express itself
[1:27:41] that is perfection already dwelling deep
[1:27:45] within that Perfection will Express all
[1:27:49] these virtues
[1:27:50] and it says automatically
[1:27:53] automatically it will begin to express
[1:27:56] itself many many places you can see he
[1:27:59] says you don't go to a sheep and says oh
[1:28:01] produce wool or you go over to a dove
[1:28:04] and say produce oil you know no he says
[1:28:09] it just naturally automatically produces
[1:28:12] oil and produces wool as it eats as it
[1:28:15] grows it begins to produce it because
[1:28:18] that's what it is
[1:28:20] you are a son you're a daughter of the
[1:28:22] Living God Hallelujah with the Holy
[1:28:25] Spirit waves and waves of the oceans of
[1:28:29] the Holy Spirit sweeping of your soul
[1:28:31] after a while what does he do it
[1:28:34] produces back what you really are what
[1:28:38] the seed is and where it come from
[1:28:40] Hallelujah and that's how God identifies
[1:28:42] his own
[1:28:44] go back look at the messages think on
[1:28:46] them Christ is identified by
[1:28:49] his own characteristics
[1:28:52] amen so so we'll know God will know
[1:28:56] Christ is in you when he sees you're
[1:28:58] bringing forth
[1:28:59] his characteristics
[1:29:02] praise the Lord
[1:29:05] shaking
[1:29:07] think of it God shaking them God don't
[1:29:12] shake that out there
[1:29:15] health is going to shake light when it
[1:29:20] begins to receive that right oh my just
[1:29:25] think of it Hallelujah the only ones
[1:29:29] that are really shaken today and I don't
[1:29:32] mean have to walk around being a shaker
[1:29:35] as I used to call those people long ago
[1:29:37] they walk in the wrong shaking all the
[1:29:39] time like that to show like they're
[1:29:40] under the power of the Holy Ghost so
[1:29:42] they're shaking shaking shaking no but
[1:29:44] praise God the only ones shaking within
[1:29:48] their heart
[1:29:49] is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:29:53] for you to shake loose from some of the
[1:29:56] things that you held dear
[1:29:58] it only took the the Hebrews 4 12. the
[1:30:04] sharp word of God
[1:30:06] to surgically take that tumor out
[1:30:10] to take out the cancer to take out all
[1:30:14] of those things planted in our hearts

[1:32:48] in the days of Sodom
[1:32:51] so shall it be again when the son of man

[1:33:51] things that going on right now buying

[1:36:11] afraid many message people don't
[1:36:14] understand yet
[1:36:17] maybe they will but yet they don't fully
[1:36:20] understand even me talking now in this
[1:36:24] way to you many hearing me on line many
[1:36:29] hearing me preach the word they have no
[1:36:32] conception of what you're talking about
[1:36:34] and they will even say what is he
[1:36:37] talking about what does that mean what
[1:36:39] is that you see what you are either in
[1:36:42] the veil or you're outside the veil
[1:36:44] you're either in the ark or you're
[1:36:46] outside the ark whatever the case is but
[1:36:49] let's look here we find that there are a
[1:36:52] lot of message people
[1:36:54] amen because you know the deception is
[1:36:57] not out there
[1:36:59] that is open for any real spiritual
[1:37:03] believer to recognize
[1:37:05] the sin the evil is of evident
[1:37:08] the real deception now is right in the
[1:37:12] garden it's right in the message
[1:37:16] the devil walking right up and down
[1:37:20] seeing whom he can devour who he can
[1:37:23] deceive who he can throw off your mind
[1:37:26] in this area that way this way or the
[1:37:29] other way praise God but it's home time
[1:37:32] now let's Rapture time now it's evening
[1:37:36] time and we're all going home by the
[1:37:39] grace of God Amen when they're going
[1:37:42] home they're staggering while they're
[1:37:44] going home under the The Hangover that
[1:37:48] they got from the old Pentecostal wine
[1:37:52] they drank so much of it that they're
[1:37:55] going home all right they're going back
[1:37:57] to the presence of God but they're
[1:37:59] staggering while they're going because
[1:38:01] they're under the influence of the old
[1:38:03] Pentecostal uh hangover that they had
[1:38:07] amen and and they're going around oh
[1:38:09] praise God there's a great Revival
[1:38:12] coming

[1:38:19] man but oh man staggering not on the
[1:38:23] on this going on right now
[1:38:25] but how is it I'm not seeing signs I'm
[1:38:27] not seeing wonders I'm not seeing
[1:38:29] Miracles we got to see that uh you know
[1:38:31] you see oh my brother sister we don't
[1:38:35] have to see anything
[1:38:37] all he wants us to see is him
[1:38:40] the word
[1:38:43] and he took me to Book of Revelation and
[1:38:45] says how did the overcome and they
[1:38:47] overcame him by the word of God and by
[1:38:52] their testimony it's the word of God
[1:38:54] that overcomes the devil oh my praise
[1:38:58] God not the written word but the
[1:39:01] revealed word The Living Word overcomes
[1:39:05] the devil or my praise God forevermore
[1:39:09] yes sir she's getting her shaken now
[1:39:12] praise God oh praise the Lord amen you
[1:39:15] know how many
[1:39:16] ministers and Brethren I meet so oh my
[1:39:20] I'm looking for that great day where the
[1:39:23] Holy Spirit Will demonstrate himself
[1:39:25] when there's going to be signs wonders
[1:39:28] and stuff like that and whether Brandon
[1:39:30] said this over here the heavens will
[1:39:32] open up and speak on harms and legs they
[1:39:37] are don't see the whole picture
[1:39:39] where he says many of the things I said
[1:39:43] and done were deliberately said enough
[1:39:45] to pull your spirit out
[1:39:47] to see what's back there what's hung
[1:39:50] over what's holding on to you amen you
[1:39:54] he wants you to see him only let my eyes
[1:39:58] see Jesus on it amen praise the name of
[1:40:02] the Lord amen praise God you don't
[1:40:05] understand and I I didn't bother with
[1:40:08] all these quotes you can find him
[1:40:09] yourself where brother Branham said they
[1:40:11] do not understand that it's not going to
[1:40:15] happen over here
[1:40:17] it is going to happen under the two
[1:40:20] witnesses Revelation 13 this is going to
[1:40:24] happen under them to reduce
[1:40:27] because they're going to receive what we
[1:40:30] received you know he preached to us the
[1:40:33] word Jesus Christ is the Messiah they're
[1:40:36] gonna go back and preach to them that
[1:40:38] Jesus Christ who was the word is your
[1:40:41] Messiah and you were blind you didn't
[1:40:43] see him amen he says that will be there
[1:40:46] Jubilee Praise God and that's where the
[1:40:50] signs and the Wonders are going to take
[1:40:52] place amen praise God we already had our
[1:40:55] first phone we already had our second
[1:40:58] Pole now it's the word itself amen
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:04] that thing comes to its maturity in the
[1:41:07] fullness of the word and all this word
[1:41:09] is going to do is keep going higher and
[1:41:11] higher
[1:41:12] and when he says higher and higher he
[1:41:14] says remember God always hides in
[1:41:17] simplicity
[1:41:18] you're gonna appear like it's nothing
[1:41:20] but that's when it really is the
[1:41:22] powerful at once even when you go to
[1:41:24] let's go to ammunitions do you know the
[1:41:28] smaller they make something is the more
[1:41:31] powerful it becomes
[1:41:33] when they break down those atoms right
[1:41:35] down to neutrons two runs down onto
[1:41:38] Cobalt down down the smaller they can
[1:41:40] get to the smaller part of it the
[1:41:44] explosion becomes worse and that's where
[1:41:47] God's word comes down in Revelation to
[1:41:50] his people amen praise God hallelujah
[1:41:54] amen so the evening time evangelism is
[1:41:58] what then
[1:41:59] not shaping it's shaping the bride but
[1:42:03] is shaking her by uh
[1:42:08] shaping her by shaking her loose
[1:42:13] loose from our own thoughts
[1:42:16] from her own ideas
[1:42:18] from her own theories do you know you
[1:42:22] say oh you're talking about Panic no
[1:42:24] even you coming to this message you
[1:42:27] study brother Brown's message and you
[1:42:30] start to develop some of your own ideas
[1:42:33] you start developing your own theories
[1:42:36] and you you're certain that it's right
[1:42:38] but the point about that is that even
[1:42:40] that you gotta surrender and let the
[1:42:43] word the Holy Spirit begin to clean
[1:42:47] by the word begin to shape Us by his
[1:42:51] word Lord of God shaken us out of all of
[1:42:55] our conceptions praise God hallelujah
[1:42:58] and all kinds of vines that were wrapped
[1:43:03] you were wrapped up and Tangled Up In
[1:43:06] until he has to say it don't it don't
[1:43:09] pay to get your lines Tangled in these
[1:43:13] kinds of times
[1:43:14] you can't allow to get them tangled up
[1:43:16] oh my so the word comes to do what shape
[1:43:20] Us by shaking us loose amen praise the
[1:43:24] Lord we've been bound too long in all
[1:43:27] kinds of things like that amen see
[1:43:30] others shout when they see signs wonders
[1:43:32] and miracles
[1:43:34] and if they're coming here they're going
[1:43:36] to wonder why you shouting because
[1:43:38] they don't understand they're seeing the
[1:43:41] greatest Miracle take place of the
[1:43:44] unwritten word manifesting itself and in
[1:43:48] and expressing Itself by Revelation they
[1:43:52] can't see that Hallelujah my praise God
[1:43:56] hallelujah amen now uh
[1:44:00] we of course we Shout
[1:44:03] when we see the miraculous unfolding of
[1:44:06] the word
[1:44:07] not the Miracles of science wonders and
[1:44:11] so on
[1:44:12] Matthew 21 1 to 11. let's just look
[1:44:16] quickly at this
[1:44:22] aren't you happy for the word of God
[1:44:32] I'm going to quote brother Branham here
[1:44:35] and you have the scriptures up there
[1:44:37] okay he says now on that great day
[1:44:42] their anticipation was high
[1:44:46] and over the top of Mount olives
[1:44:51] Come A Little White Donkey
[1:44:55] walking down the hill to them
[1:44:59] oh my
[1:45:00] and there it was people when they saw
[1:45:05] that see praise God when those people
[1:45:09] the people fanatically screaming pulling
[1:45:13] off Palm leaves off of the trees
[1:45:15] throwing their clothes on the road and
[1:45:19] screaming Hosanna to the son of David
[1:45:22] that comes in the name of the Lord his
[1:45:26] rider on that little mule that little
[1:45:29] donkey was none other than God's
[1:45:33] anointed
[1:45:34] Messiah of the hour praise the Lord why
[1:45:38] do they Shout
[1:45:40] why did they Shout
[1:45:43] oh not they didn't want to go back under
[1:45:46] the first pole yes they shouted under
[1:45:49] that because he had all kinds of signs
[1:45:52] wonders Miracles and thousands of people
[1:45:55] following him oh my they didn't want to
[1:45:58] go back to the second ball when he had
[1:46:01] discernment he could tell the secrets of
[1:46:03] the heart and he'll make the people's
[1:46:06] flesh quick and oh visible evidence
[1:46:09] you see they didn't want to go back to
[1:46:12] visible evidence of seeing this and
[1:46:14] seeing that and all that to satisfy the
[1:46:16] flesh no what we are aspiring to is to
[1:46:20] make the world live again
[1:46:24] that while Peter yet speak the Holy
[1:46:27] Ghost fell on them that heard the Lord
[1:46:31] caught the revelation
[1:46:33] Holy Spirit fell on them then when he
[1:46:36] falls on them anything the skies will
[1:46:39] anything can happen you don't have to
[1:46:41] worry about the rest of it the Holy
[1:46:43] Spirit takes care of that amen but I
[1:46:46] can't change my focus to signs wonders
[1:46:48] Miracles I'm watching to see this happen
[1:46:51] I'm watching no no no I'm watching to
[1:46:54] see the word made manifest and then all
[1:46:56] them things just spark right off of it
[1:46:58] just comes out like that praise the Lord
[1:47:01] I've told it many times and I still tell
[1:47:03] it again it's happened many other times
[1:47:05] uh speaking one time just like this not
[1:47:08] preaching about healing and all of a
[1:47:10] sudden one man in congregation
[1:47:13] he coughed up the cancer right on the
[1:47:15] floor isn't that me is the word the
[1:47:18] devil is scared of the word as it shines
[1:47:21] the light upon the day and the hour that
[1:47:23] we are living in of that people get up
[1:47:26] and run out the doors and the demons
[1:47:28] talking out to them oh we don't want
[1:47:30] that we and you know it's not the person
[1:47:32] that the voice changed the devil upon
[1:47:34] them praise the Lord some Believers have
[1:47:36] seen it preaching the word of God they
[1:47:38] fall on the ground and they're moving
[1:47:40] like a snake right on the floor by
[1:47:42] because the Holy Spirit but the anointed
[1:47:45] word of the Living God makes the world
[1:47:47] manifest hallelujah oh my goodness
[1:47:50] praise the Lord oh praise God now see
[1:47:54] then God what was God doing what was the
[1:47:58] attraction on the mountain on the hill
[1:48:01] it was God making history let's just
[1:48:04] change that word it's the word
[1:48:08] history
[1:48:10] it's the word making his appearance
[1:48:14] it's the word that is making himself
[1:48:17] manifest hallelujah oh praise God
[1:48:21] hallelujah that was the word that was
[1:48:25] none other than God's anointed Messiah
[1:48:29] of the hour and this is the anointed
[1:48:32] word of the hour
[1:48:35] and making themselves long making
[1:48:37] themselves manifested Hallelujah the
[1:48:41] word unveiling himself to the world Amen
[1:48:45] again God's word is the power that is
[1:48:49] shaking this hour
[1:48:51] amen yes the bride has another Revival
[1:48:56] yet
[1:48:57] oh no
[1:48:59] amen
[1:49:00] there's been no Revival
[1:49:03] there's been no real Stir of God right
[1:49:07] uh the to the bride as yet amen now let
[1:49:13] me tell you we are looking for that we
[1:49:16] are looking for it now
[1:49:18] but it will only take those seven
[1:49:21] centers
[1:49:23] to wake her up again it'll take the
[1:49:27] unwritten word it'll take that it will
[1:49:31] take the revelation of the word to
[1:49:34] really wet the bride up that's what
[1:49:36] brings the right Revival that's what
[1:49:39] brings her Revival within our heart
[1:49:41] that's where the quaking the shaking
[1:49:43] that's where it goes on praise the name
[1:49:46] of the Lord God hallelujah so them seven
[1:49:49] unknown tunders yes and he will send it
[1:49:54] o praise God hallelujah oh my oh praise
[1:49:58] God now he says there are people around
[1:50:02] me around him there
[1:50:05] that are believing that there will be
[1:50:09] some Awakening
[1:50:10] and they are good people see
[1:50:13] but what have they done
[1:50:15] they have not recognized The Awakening
[1:50:20] of the Bride
[1:50:22] they have not recognized The Awakening
[1:50:25] of the Bride amen but by being
[1:50:28] Christians they can sense and feel the
[1:50:33] pull of the hour but they haven't
[1:50:36] recognized or seen clearly what's being
[1:50:40] done
[1:50:41] amen that's what making them feel that
[1:50:45] way because they know there's something
[1:50:47] supposed to happen something is supposed
[1:50:50] to take place but they are really
[1:50:53] looking for it somewhere off in the
[1:50:56] future
[1:50:58] they're looking for it to come in the
[1:51:00] future amen oh my
[1:51:03] let me read the whole sentence they're
[1:51:06] looking for it to come way off in the
[1:51:08] future
[1:51:09] when it's already happening right by you
[1:51:13] now it's happening right by you now but
[1:51:16] they're hungover of how Pentecost used
[1:51:19] to make itself manifest demonstrate
[1:51:22] itself uh we look at that that way we
[1:51:26] have to see it that way and then we
[1:51:28] think that's really it amen praise God
[1:51:32] he says now that's the same thing that
[1:51:36] they're dealing them all this when they
[1:51:39] were believing in the coming of a
[1:51:41] messiah they believed there would be a
[1:51:43] forerunner to come but he was already
[1:51:46] there right amongst them
[1:51:48] and they didn't know it and didn't
[1:51:51] recognize it what's he talking about he
[1:51:54] says look he says when it says behold I
[1:51:58] send my message my for my face I'll make
[1:52:00] the high places law and the Lord places
[1:52:03] high he says you see they believe that
[1:52:06] mean the mountains gonna drop down
[1:52:09] and all the value is going to raise up
[1:52:12] and that's good he says no that wasn't
[1:52:15] it what he was telling you is that when
[1:52:18] the word Jesus comes on the scene all
[1:52:20] these high and mighty rabbis that look
[1:52:22] like they're great and everything else
[1:52:24] is going to bring them low it's going to
[1:52:26] expose them it's going to reveal to the
[1:52:28] people where they really are amen and
[1:52:31] the common people who hurt him gladly
[1:52:33] they are going to be raised up by the
[1:52:36] preaching of the word of the Living God
[1:52:38] hallelujah
[1:52:39] he said the same mistake is being made
[1:52:42] again today
[1:52:44] looking for it far off and having the
[1:52:48] Mosaic influence on them looking with
[1:52:50] the expectation of that kind of a thing
[1:52:53] and not seeing what was taking place
[1:52:55] right then amen when he preaches that in
[1:52:59] the message called recognizing your day
[1:53:01] and its message but when the real
[1:53:05] spiritual bride
[1:53:07] and I'm closing now when she begins to
[1:53:10] have a Revival when she begins to have a
[1:53:13] Revival
[1:53:15] see that's when she begins to come back
[1:53:20] amen
[1:53:22] he comes back then she begins to line
[1:53:26] herself up with the word of God
[1:53:30] hallelujah praise God are we lining
[1:53:33] ourselves up with the word of God
[1:53:35] are we lining up with the message of the
[1:53:38] hour amen watch then watch what happens
[1:53:43] then amen because then that there come a
[1:53:48] message at that time
[1:53:50] that will seep out there catch that
[1:53:53] bride catch that woman elect amen praise
[1:53:57] the Lord oh my you think he was talking
[1:54:00] about his message
[1:54:04] catching the brain no what he's talking
[1:54:08] about there is the messenger from heaven
[1:54:11] praise the Lord
[1:54:13] you've heard some of you have heard that
[1:54:15] message many years ago when the Holy
[1:54:17] Spirit began to break these things on me
[1:54:19] and show him look I have seven
[1:54:21] messengers of Earth and they all came
[1:54:24] seven of them to each Church age
[1:54:27] and then brother Brown said but this one
[1:54:31] that came to me he wasn't a messenger of
[1:54:33] Earth he he was the Lord From Heaven
[1:54:37] amen praise God and then in the church
[1:54:40] in the Statue of a perfect man he says
[1:54:43] I'm waiting I'm watching for them men
[1:54:46] and women that of this of the this this
[1:54:49] beyond the church ages

[1:55:00] seals praise the lord well we know that
[1:55:05] the seals ended or not ended but they
[1:55:08] came forth in the auditions or change
[1:55:12] and the Eighth Day coming to into Force
[1:55:16] and the eighth day he called the Eternal
[1:55:19] Church age
[1:55:21] but he says he says but his church is
[1:55:24] you got to have a messenger
[1:55:26] and these seven were men of earth
[1:55:30] but this one he wasn't a word this one
[1:55:32] come from Heaven this was the Lord
[1:55:34] himself

[1:55:38] from heaven was the Lord himself
[1:55:41] this messenger that's talking to us by
[1:55:43] the word and bringing the message to the
[1:55:46] bride that he was talking about here now
[1:55:49] watch now he is supposed to receive that
[1:55:53] amen at that time there will be that
[1:55:57] message that will sweep out to catch
[1:56:00] that bride catch that woman elect at
[1:56:03] that time amen catch her praise God how
[1:56:07] catch her attention
[1:56:09] that's how the mess is going to catch

[1:56:17] Eternal Church age that we call we all

[1:56:22] that is now going forth is to attract
[1:56:25] the bride's attention of the day
