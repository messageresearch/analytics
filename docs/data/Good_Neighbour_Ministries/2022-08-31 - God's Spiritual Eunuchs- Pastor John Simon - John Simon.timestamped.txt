[27:42] very happy to be here with you and I'm
[27:45] glad to see you here in the house of the
[27:48] Lord praise God God bless you all we're
[27:51] going to go to the word Isaiah 54. we
[27:56] want to just read one verse and that way
[28:00] we'll be able to advance with our Bible
[28:05] study
[28:07] it's on unless the battery is bad
[28:12] it's on
[28:14] yeah okay
[28:18] I'm so happy to be here praise the Lord
[28:21] always to be in the presence of the Lord
[28:23] and to uh bring the word to you because
[28:28] um you know you normally as a human you
[28:31] have an idea of what you want to say but
[28:34] you don't know what God wants to say and
[28:37] how he's going to take that and turn
[28:39] that and use that for his glory and for
[28:42] his honor praise the Lord
[28:46] uh Isaiah 53 I have it in front of me
[28:51] here
[28:52] and let's read that 54 sorry Isaiah 54
[28:56] verse 1.
[29:01] sing O Baron
[29:04] thou that didst not bear
[29:07] Break Forth
[29:09] into singing and cry aloud thou that did
[29:15] not travail with child
[29:18] for more are the children of the
[29:22] desolate than the children
[29:25] of the married wife
[29:27] see it the Lord
[29:29] gracious Heavenly Father
[29:31] we thank thee tonight for this great
[29:34] opportunity as children of the most high
[29:38] god of our great king
[29:41] we ask your blessing upon this the water
[29:46] of the word May the spirit of God travel
[29:51] move upon the water's father and bring
[29:55] the word to life and reality to our
[29:59] hearts that we might enter in the Lord
[30:03] into this divine presence of the Lord as
[30:07] in the temple of Solomon but thank you
[30:11] Lord we have something greater for the
[30:14] greater than Solomon is here and oh God
[30:18] we are pulled into his Dimension we are
[30:22] pulled into his Spirit we are pulled
[30:25] into his atmosphere and we take you Lord
[30:28] that we can come in here so simply but
[30:32] yet knowing within our hearts that we
[30:35] are seated in Heavenly places in Jesus
[30:39] Christ Our Lord take your Lord none may
[30:43] understand none mayor appreciate what
[30:46] you're doing Lord but the wise the
[30:50] simple The Humble your children they
[30:54] recognize and they understand Lord what
[30:57] you are doing father and we praise and
[31:00] honor you and glorify you Lord that we
[31:03] have come to this hour from all the
[31:06] years of time and oh God as the song
[31:10] says through many dangers toils and
[31:13] snares we have already come and it's
[31:16] your grace that has brought us safe here
[31:20] Lord and brothers thus far and it's that
[31:23] Grace we are trusting that will lead us
[31:26] home we give you praise and honor in
[31:29] Jesus name amen
[31:33] God bless you please be seated
[31:41] Hallelujah
[31:43] now uh going to uh Corinthians 2 1 to 8
[31:49] we're not going to read that because uh
[31:53] the verse that's important to us
[31:56] is where Paul was trying to not Paul was
[32:01] telling them that I don't come with the
[32:04] Excellency of man's speech
[32:07] I don't come with the Excellency of
[32:10] man's Wisdom
[32:12] but I come in the power of the Holy
[32:15] Spirit
[32:16] the demonstrations of the holy spirit
[32:19] amen praise God that your faith may not
[32:24] stand
[32:25] in the wisdom of man
[32:28] but that your faith May rest or stand
[32:32] upon the word of God
[32:35] now saying it that for our day and time
[32:40] Paul was literally saying as he himself
[32:44] was a great intellectual and academic
[32:49] Paul was trying to tell them I don't
[32:53] come here to bring you my Seminary
[32:55] knowledge
[32:57] I don't come here to bring you what I
[33:01] was taught by Gamaliel
[33:03] it's useful but that's not what I come
[33:06] here to bring bring to you at all amen
[33:10] praise God because he did not want the
[33:15] people's faith
[33:17] the or the people to have faith in a man
[33:21] because of the man's intellectual Talent
[33:26] our capacity or the left Lover's
[33:30] education
[33:31] people are attracted by such things but
[33:35] that is carnal because God has nothing
[33:38] to do with that you see once you come to
[33:42] the place where you understand that what
[33:45] God is seeking is not a man with great
[33:47] knowledge or whatever he wants somebody
[33:51] regardless of knowledge or no knowledge
[33:53] that could surrender themselves so that
[33:57] he can uh use them or flow through them
[34:03] to bring his wisdom his word and his
[34:06] power to his people
[34:09] so Paul is literally saying
[34:12] if a man comes with all the training the
[34:17] intellectual knowledge and the wisdom
[34:20] and the
[34:22] attainments and accomplishments that he
[34:26] has made from the Seminary the the
[34:30] whatever the the Bible school or
[34:33] whatever
[34:34] then the people's feet will tend to look
[34:39] towards that
[34:41] their faith will want to rest on that uh
[34:45] and if oh he's a great preacher because
[34:48] this this this this you see Hallelujah
[34:51] and then their faith will not rest on
[34:54] the Simplicity of the Gospel
[34:56] amen and uh under demonstrations of the
[35:01] power of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so
[35:05] when God flows through ordinary or
[35:09] simple people or even a one that was
[35:13] educated but come to be humble and
[35:17] simple then uh God is even more
[35:22] glorifying
[35:24] because it's not expected that such a
[35:27] one will be able to speak that way or to
[35:30] be able to deliver the word in that way
[35:33] what God showing that he can pick up
[35:37] anything and use it for his glory and
[35:40] for his honor as long as it's
[35:42] surrendered to him Hallelujah and then
[35:46] the faith of the Believers
[35:48] will not be uh bounded or best or
[35:53] founded on worldly success it will not
[35:57] be bounded on intellectual attainments
[36:01] it will not be bounded or resting on how
[36:05] many degrees the man has or whatsoever
[36:08] like that amen yes sir oh sir but I tell
[36:13] you the people's fate amen what just
[36:17] rest on what they see that God that
[36:22] person has a Divine gift by which God
[36:25] can work through
[36:27] and deliver his word
[36:31] for his glory and for his honor amen
[36:35] praise God forevermore Hallelujah and
[36:38] you know uh Revelation is by grace
[36:42] and therefore it's all by grace
[36:46] that means that when that sort of a man
[36:48] is preaching or speaking he is speaking
[36:51] as we would say by faith
[36:54] because every sentence every other
[36:57] sentence every paragraph every every
[37:00] thought that's got to be by grace
[37:03] doesn't mean that he will have a sense
[37:06] of direction of knowing what in the
[37:09] heart God placed there to be said but
[37:12] every word for it to be inspired it
[37:16] can't be it can't be already in a mold
[37:20] in a form in a shape he's got to come
[37:23] speak him delivering the word
[37:26] ministering by faith
[37:29] by grace
[37:31] by revelation
[37:34] this is how that man comes in the
[37:37] presence of the Living God to deliver
[37:40] the word of God hallelujah amen praise
[37:45] God now let's read again our text I will
[37:49] read it
[37:50] sing all barren
[37:52] thou that didst not bear
[37:56] Break Forth into singing and cry aloud
[37:59] thou that didst not travail with child
[38:04] amen you you didn't travail with child
[38:07] but you got a whole lot of children
[38:09] right that's what the prophet is saying
[38:12] you you you you didn't travail with
[38:14] child you didn't really go through any
[38:17] child birth but yet you have a whole
[38:18] host of children all around you like
[38:21] that for more of the children are the
[38:25] children of the desolate than the
[38:27] children of the married wife said the
[38:31] Lord
[38:32] quoting brother Branham now
[38:36] although the denominational churches
[38:39] will
[38:40] [Music]
[38:44] a thousand to one
[38:47] they will outnumber the bride in number
[38:51] one thousand to one do you believe that
[38:56] then he calls Isaiah 54 1 here amen you
[39:01] see four more are the children
[39:05] of the Harlot church amen you will have
[39:10] greater numbers the Harlot will always
[39:12] have greater numbers
[39:13] then they married wife see oh my Lord
[39:18] hallelujah but though they have more
[39:23] numbers they have no true father
[39:27] amen they have no true father whatsoever
[39:33] oh my why because they are incubator
[39:36] chickens
[39:37] they're incubator chickens they come
[39:42] through a denominational
[39:44] mechanical system
[39:47] and they are born from in this machine
[39:51] so there is no father they don't know no
[39:55] father they just know that they come
[39:58] from that machine and uh you know when
[40:03] they come through that machine the the
[40:07] machine can always put out more
[40:10] uh and more and more and more it's like
[40:15] uh I'm just remembering a quotation
[40:17] where it says that you know all the most
[40:21] of the other words can have a whole lot
[40:22] of eggs and bring forth a whole uh flock
[40:25] of uh of uh children or chickens to
[40:30] follow them but the eagle one year and
[40:33] maybe they'll get one egg
[40:36] and one child following them right and
[40:41] so it's the same thing the the Harlot
[40:44] Church may have a whole ton of them but
[40:46] it takes God
[40:49] an aid sometimes to produce one Abraham
[40:53] or one Noah in a whole age might be one
[40:57] man amen and even in the time that we're
[41:00] living in that's why Jesus said it's
[41:03] going to come down when the pot boils
[41:06] down it's going to simmer right down and
[41:09] it's going to come to a few few there be
[41:14] that find them you hear brother brother
[41:16] who sung it over many start in the race
[41:19] but but the past began to get hot the
[41:22] law the road began to get long the
[41:25] weather the outside is hot the wind is
[41:28] blowing everything else trials trouble
[41:31] this that oh my goodness and what many
[41:35] started in the race but not many can
[41:38] continue in the race
[41:40] not to say that some kid uh drop out
[41:43] together glass of water and drop back in
[41:46] and run again but but my friends this is
[41:50] what we are looking at we are in the
[41:52] middle of that right now that I'm
[41:53] talking about amen by the way my subject
[41:57] is spiritual eunuchs
[41:59] foreign
[42:00] spiritual eunuchs
[42:03] now
[42:05] we just said
[42:06] they are incubated chickens
[42:09] they don't know who their father is
[42:13] and they unconsciously start to worship
[42:16] their Church
[42:18] the church become their Idol right now
[42:22] if I become practical I know this for a
[42:25] fact because we had chickens and stuff
[42:27] like that and you you maybe you know
[42:30] that too that the you put the duck eggs
[42:33] with the with the uh with the ham
[42:36] because there's no the same kind of
[42:38] warmth that that helps to hatch those
[42:41] eggs and uh you place them and the duck
[42:46] gets hatched out amongst the chickens
[42:49] and do you know when that duck hatches
[42:53] out he's following the hen around
[42:55] because they think that him is their
[42:58] mother
[42:59] is that right so they're born in this uh
[43:03] um denominational machine or Machinery
[43:06] right and they come to and when they
[43:10] come to it now they can get the same
[43:12] jumping shouting and warp that you can
[43:15] have in a message Church seeing the real
[43:17] truth but over there they can shout and
[43:19] jump too and they feel another kind of
[43:22] work and because they feel that and they
[43:25] look around see all these programs see
[43:28] the system see everything well formed
[43:31] well shaped everything moving every
[43:34] piston in line like that they just come
[43:38] and they believe that that is their
[43:41] mother
[43:42] and saw their misdirected from the word
[43:46] of God that they don't really know who
[43:50] their father is
[43:52] they're still tied up in the Trinity
[43:54] they don't know who their father is they
[43:57] don't recognize who their God is God
[44:00] Danielle 12 I believe said you are in
[44:03] that day in the last day then shall they
[44:07] the people that do not their God
[44:09] hallelujah will be wise in that hour
[44:12] when they come to know their God
[44:14] hallelujah I believe that there's people
[44:17] here today that come to know who God is
[44:21] and start to get some wisdom from God
[44:24] about who God is and who know their
[44:27] father and they can clearly say I and my
[44:31] father are one
[44:33] because I recognize Hallelujah who he is
[44:37] now once you are born inside or claimed
[44:42] to be born again inside the
[44:43] denominational system you have already
[44:46] entered into this spirit and atmosphere
[44:50] of woman worship
[44:54] and that is why you have these Idols
[44:57] that's why you have the emphasis on
[44:59] Mariola tree and a mother this and
[45:03] mother that and emphasis on that is
[45:06] because this kind of spirit around that
[45:09] that is what it emphasizes right to get
[45:13] that person to a woman worship to
[45:17] worship the woman or to worship the
[45:20] church the denomination that they're in
[45:23] and you know there's one thing when you
[45:25] come to that talk about anything else
[45:27] but if you want to get any real man
[45:30] really mad you go talking about this
[45:32] mother
[45:36] foreign
[45:40] sitting here
[45:43] get to talking about this mother and and
[45:46] his right will go up right yeah the
[45:49] hears on his on his head and his body
[45:52] will just rise up because that you don't
[45:55] touch a man's mother not by word not by
[45:59] deed not by thought nothing whatsoever
[46:02] that's the same spirit that comes on the
[46:06] people when you talk about the church
[46:09] are their Church
[46:12] they don't care if their mother is a
[46:15] harlot
[46:16] you talk against that Harlot it's my
[46:20] mother I don't care see and they're
[46:23] ready they don't realize what is
[46:26] motivating them is not the spirit of
[46:28] Christ they think it's the love for
[46:30] their mother but that is just a filio
[46:33] that is not uh God's love right because
[46:37] that's not Zoe and that moves them in
[46:40] that kind of a way whatsoever now listen
[46:46] see there will outnumber her by many
[46:50] times
[46:51] my but though they have more numbers
[46:55] they have no true father amen why
[47:00] because they had stopped by a machinery
[47:03] the Machinery of a system you know every
[47:06] Factory has their systems and you put
[47:09] the cookie dough just throw the dough in
[47:11] there and when you come to the end they
[47:14] pass through the whole process they come
[47:16] out here's beautiful cookies right it's
[47:19] the same thing happening in the churches
[47:21] they got this systems out there that
[47:26] well teach how to produce how to bring
[47:31] forth members how to do it by assess
[47:35] them that they have studied over years
[47:38] and it does work but there and they
[47:41] produce many many like that but we are
[47:45] not looking for many many though God can
[47:47] give many we are looking for that one
[47:50] that they have the life of God the seed
[47:53] of God within them The Germ of God to
[47:56] recognize the word of God for their day
[47:59] and for their hour hallelujah amen yes
[48:03] sir oh my praise God so Paul said I
[48:07] don't come with the Excellency of man's
[48:10] Wisdom and man's speech
[48:12] but I come in the power of the Holy
[48:15] Spirit and in demonstration amen
[48:18] hallelujah amen praise God so you see uh
[48:24] I'm just going to quote a note here that
[48:27] I wrote here while I was studying this
[48:30] that these intellectual means that they
[48:33] use of conveying the teachings of the
[48:38] Bible
[48:38] often will produce more memberships than
[48:43] a simple gospel preacher or teacher
[48:47] who's taught all dependence
[48:50] is upon God
[48:53] for without him God hallelujah that
[48:58] person knows they know nothing and they
[49:01] have nothing and it's only if God flows
[49:04] through them only if God speaks through
[49:07] them then they have something to offer
[49:09] to the bride because the bride doesn't
[49:12] want to listen to anything else
[49:14] oh my uh not that she won't hear other
[49:17] things but she really doesn't want to
[49:20] listen to anything else but to hear the
[49:23] voice of Our Lord coming true hallelujah
[49:27] oh praise God forevermore they know they
[49:31] have nothing to say it's God has to be
[49:34] able to say it by his word through that
[49:38] servant listen
[49:41] now the denominational kinds
[49:46] is represented here in Jude it
[49:50] right right to 13. and he calls them the
[49:56] secular Church
[49:58] that we have today clouds Without Rain
[50:02] we had a lot of that for this past week
[50:04] their predict rain for almost every dead
[50:08] week it's going to fall rain is going to
[50:12] fall all day the next day there's going
[50:14] to be a storm oh it's going to really be
[50:17] terrible and you know the clouds come up
[50:21] the winds begin to blow the skies get
[50:24] dark and you say to yourself oh my God I
[50:27] better get my stuff inside because it's
[50:29] going to rain oh my the next thing you
[50:33] know another win the doctrine blow and
[50:35] blow the clouds and the clouds gone and
[50:38] what happened the Sun comes out and
[50:40] begin to shine and and there's no rain
[50:44] whatsoever oh my friends that's exactly
[50:47] they're clouds Without Rain
[50:51] in other words they look good
[50:54] they're admirable they're fluffy and
[50:57] nice but they're they got no rain
[51:00] they got nothing to give you
[51:03] oh my listen brother Branham says
[51:08] and they're forming out their own shame
[51:13] see that Pentecostal church is
[51:17] represented out of the whole
[51:20] denominational group
[51:23] God has in second Timothy 3 18
[51:27] that they are the ones having forms of
[51:31] godliness but denying the power thereof
[51:35] they have lots of forms of godliness but
[51:38] denying the power thereof and their seed
[51:44] will produce after its kind
[51:47] see we are produced members like that
[51:51] that will uh you know have a form of
[51:54] godliness but they will not come to the
[51:57] word
[51:59] right here he begins to speak now
[52:02] notice the eunuch
[52:05] we're getting into something deep here
[52:07] now
[52:08] notice the eunuch now let me let me just
[52:12] pause here because he doesn't you know
[52:15] he just mentions it and he goes on so
[52:17] let me say to you what this is really
[52:20] about he's talking about the
[52:22] relationship of the true Sons and
[52:26] Daughters of God and the true Servants
[52:28] of God having this unique position of
[52:33] being spiritual eunuchs to the word of
[52:36] God
[52:38] right this is what now he's talking
[52:41] about now watch you see for for the Sea
[52:46] church the real Church the Sea church
[52:50] the one with the real germ right that's
[52:55] the one notice again he said the eunuch
[52:59] oh Hallelujah he's talking about Philip
[53:04] and the Ethiopian eunuch
[53:07] and the eunuch had gone to all the
[53:11] places there in Jerusalem and none of
[53:14] them could give him answers to his
[53:16] question because there was something in
[53:18] him different to what they had and that
[53:21] Gene in him was thirsting for life
[53:26] and so uh brother Branham doesn't
[53:30] vocalize all of this but here he says he
[53:34] just jumps to the to this point notice
[53:36] the eunuch had been with all them DDS
[53:41] remember
[53:43] but I want you to see this now God never
[53:47] committed his preaching
[53:50] his gospel his word to any angel
[53:56] see oh my
[53:59] Galatians 1 8 if Paul said if any Angel
[54:03] come down from heaven and tell you
[54:06] anything different to what I am saying
[54:09] Paul said a man speaking of an Angel is
[54:14] saying let him be a curse
[54:17] Amen brother Bradham said notice the
[54:21] angel
[54:22] if is wrong if he is different from the
[54:26] word
[54:27] when God came down below
[54:31] if below Angels the level of angels he
[54:35] came down past the level of angels and
[54:39] went and committed this gospel to a man
[54:44] and man which was Sons see but he never
[54:49] committed it to Angels because what men
[54:53] are sons and daughters but angels are
[54:57] servants and Messengers
[55:00] Hallelujah but we are Sons and Daughters
[55:03] of the Living God aren't you glad for
[55:05] that
[55:06] Hallelujah and you know that uh in in
[55:10] certain cultures very important to have
[55:14] your own Sons and Daughters because they
[55:17] carry on after their kind bring forth
[55:19] the family line and and so on it goes on
[55:23] why but if you don't have that then it
[55:26] can't go on Amen so the the mule the
[55:30] denominational uh mechanical systems
[55:34] can't carry that life on the blood does
[55:38] not pass through there amen for the
[55:41] church is the blood of Christ through
[55:43] the holy spirit amen hallelujah oh my so
[55:48] you see men are Sons amen they are not
[55:52] servants praise God hallelujah amen I'm
[55:57] so glad that we are Sons and Daughters
[56:00] of the Living God
[56:02] it's marvelous to to think that one day
[56:07] you you die and when you go up there you
[56:10] find out you're an angel
[56:12] some people think that's great oh when a
[56:16] baby dies that's oh that angel took his
[56:19] flight right but it's not like that
[56:22] you're either an angel or your sons and
[56:26] daughters of God
[56:28] and the angels are Servants of God
[56:32] messengers of God but we are Sons and
[56:36] Daughters of God to do the will plan and
[56:39] purpose of the Living God hallelujah
[56:42] amen praise God Amen so you see now that
[56:48] that is great but Philip had been up to
[56:53] Pentecost
[56:55] and was there for worship
[56:58] and God used him
[57:02] to speak to that eunuch uh I pause here
[57:07] again
[57:08] now you'll find out that God works
[57:11] through spiritual eunuchs
[57:15] and this subject of course
[57:17] somebody can pick it up and expand it
[57:19] and grow it by going into the word but
[57:22] if you go to Esther 2 2 15 we're not
[57:25] going to go reading that now you know
[57:27] the story of Esther and you know how a
[57:30] eunuch is such a man that the Kings the
[57:35] Emperors the sheikhs the caliphs could
[57:39] give their whole harem
[57:41] to end their responsibility
[57:44] and not have to worry
[57:46] whether they have one wife or they got
[57:49] 300 wives they put them in the hands of
[57:52] that eunuch
[57:54] and why would they do that trusting a
[57:57] male a man uh to to
[58:02] have responsibility over all his wives
[58:06] and the reason why is because a eunuch
[58:10] has no seed
[58:12] he has nothing yeah he can't pass on
[58:16] anything and therefore he can be trusted
[58:20] oh my so God works true not natural
[58:25] eunuchs but spiritual eunuchs praise God
[58:29] hallelujah because they have no seed of
[58:33] their own you will find that the eunuch
[58:36] was called The Keeper of the women
[58:39] right the the king's Keeper of the women
[58:43] now back to Philip
[58:46] now notice
[58:48] the eunuch had been with all them DDS
[58:52] llds and everything else
[58:55] but why didn't he get something from
[58:58] them
[59:00] see
[59:01] and here he had to come back studying
[59:04] the prophecy of Isaiah because he got
[59:07] nothing from them oh my praise God he
[59:12] couldn't get anything from them you can
[59:14] see that clear because the sea doesn't
[59:17] go pass through them their life doesn't
[59:20] operate through them I'm talking about
[59:23] the real life not Natural Life everybody
[59:26] that's alive as that amen but the Life
[59:30] of Christ the life of God doesn't work
[59:33] through that amen see it's it doesn't
[59:36] work from Machinery it works through his
[59:39] sons and his daughters to bring him
[59:42] glory and honor and praise hallelujah oh
[59:46] my now watch we see here that this an
[59:53] angel had to direct Philip to him
[59:57] well he's trying to say is not here like
[1:00:01] that but it was not the angel that
[1:00:04] brought the word to the eunuch
[1:00:06] God could have easily sent the angel but
[1:00:10] it's not the angel that brought the word
[1:00:12] to the eulog see the angel directed
[1:00:16] Philip where to go amen and even as you
[1:00:20] know moved him into the desert there uh
[1:00:24] by Supernatural Transportation he was
[1:00:27] moved into the desert Hallelujah but you
[1:00:31] know you must understand
[1:00:33] that the germ of Life had to come
[1:00:38] through Christ's body
[1:00:41] Hallelujah later on he says and Philip
[1:00:44] was a part of that body
[1:00:47] and the life only goes through Christ's
[1:00:51] body
[1:00:52] Hallelujah that's why I can say I'm glad
[1:00:55] to say that I am one of them
[1:00:59] I don't know when he wants to use me for
[1:01:02] something uh else or something this or
[1:01:06] that whatever how simple or humble or
[1:01:09] great I don't know but I want to be
[1:01:12] ready whenever the Holy Spirit wants to
[1:01:15] do something through you through me
[1:01:17] through any one of us that he has
[1:01:19] vessels that he can use for his glory
[1:01:21] and for his honor spiritual eunuchs for
[1:01:24] the glory of God hallelujah amen glory
[1:01:29] to God hallelujah watch amen I tell you
[1:01:33] friends spiritual eunuchs the thoughts
[1:01:36] striking me here now uh uh carriers
[1:01:41] of the word of God
[1:01:44] Amen to be a spiritual carrier of the
[1:01:48] word of God knowing that the word can
[1:01:51] Flash true you are passed through you at
[1:01:54] any time any moment
[1:01:56] well you don't even have to think what
[1:01:58] you're going to say but the holy spirit
[1:02:00] will work through you for his glory and
[1:02:04] for his honor brother or brother we're
[1:02:09] on a line here oh where did that germ
[1:02:14] come from did it come through the angel
[1:02:17] no my goodness the angel showed him
[1:02:21] where to go an angel is a messenger but
[1:02:26] over here this one is a song
[1:02:29] praise God a son versus an angel if you
[1:02:34] were to put a mighty Angel standing here
[1:02:36] before you like that and you put a son
[1:02:40] standing over there or most people which
[1:02:43] one they're going to believe
[1:02:45] most of the time they want to believe
[1:02:47] the angel rather than a simple human
[1:02:51] being like themselves no sir but God
[1:02:55] says no that's not how it is the Angel
[1:02:58] is only a servant he can only come with
[1:03:00] a message telling that servant that son
[1:03:03] what to do and where to go but it's the
[1:03:06] servant that's the son that's going to
[1:03:08] carry the word
[1:03:10] it's the sun that's going to be the
[1:03:12] bearer of the world
[1:03:15] Hallelujah because the word seed can
[1:03:19] only pass through Christ's body
[1:03:22] and we are a part of that body
[1:03:25] so we are in line for the operations of
[1:03:29] the Holy Spirit and demonstrations of
[1:03:32] the Holy Spirit to work through us
[1:03:35] hallelujah that's not even what you
[1:03:37] think about yourself it's gone past that
[1:03:40] now it's not what you think about
[1:03:42] yourself what your heart thinks what
[1:03:45] your heart condemn you whatever but God
[1:03:48] by his Spirit working through his body
[1:03:50] for his honor and for his glory
[1:03:54] amen oh my see so let me repeat here now
[1:04:01] Philip hug the germ
[1:04:04] Hallelujah do you have a gene do I have
[1:04:07] a gene I believe I do I believe you do
[1:04:10] praise God Philip have the germ see he
[1:04:15] had the germ he had the message
[1:04:19] Hallelujah he had the word
[1:04:22] oh what how beautiful but let's not I'm
[1:04:26] just going to go over that quickly he
[1:04:28] had the message he had the word
[1:04:30] you see the flow of it we all got the
[1:04:33] message until you're breaking the
[1:04:35] Revelation then you got the word you
[1:04:38] know the word revealed the word unto you
[1:04:40] so this is what he's talking about here
[1:04:42] he says uh Philip God the message The
[1:04:47] Germ and because he had the germ the
[1:04:50] shout had to come to him and once the
[1:04:53] shout come to him the progression of it
[1:04:54] it ends up in him being able to see the
[1:04:58] word revealed before him amen praise God
[1:05:02] hallelujah oh my now see ah now that's
[1:05:08] the way that's how a child can be born
[1:05:13] Philip laid his hands upon him
[1:05:17] it was Philip that baptized him
[1:05:21] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:24] and their comfort of birth
[1:05:26] there came forth the spirit of God upon
[1:05:28] him what he's saying there is it wasn't
[1:05:31] the angel that go and opened the word to
[1:05:35] the you knock it wasn't the angel that
[1:05:38] laid his hands upon him it wasn't the
[1:05:41] angel that baptized them in water in the
[1:05:44] name of Jesus Christ I wanted you to see
[1:05:47] the the power that the true church has
[1:05:51] I want you to recognize what power is in
[1:05:54] the true church
[1:05:55] but yet not because it's the church
[1:05:58] means the church itself is going to run
[1:06:01] around saying we're going to lay hands
[1:06:03] over here they're going to do that over
[1:06:04] there we're going to raise this dead
[1:06:06] over here but God working through his
[1:06:09] body to perform his will in his time for
[1:06:13] his glory amen
[1:06:15] it's just that that body is there that
[1:06:17] individual that elects sin that person
[1:06:22] with a Divine Purpose that was set here
[1:06:25] on the earth for this age this time so
[1:06:28] that God has some body to work through
[1:06:31] for his glory hallelujah amen praise God
[1:06:35] you're in a time you're in an age you're
[1:06:37] in a place all purpose by God before the
[1:06:41] foundation of the world
[1:06:43] you know you know every person every
[1:06:48] person that you meet God already plan
[1:06:51] and purpose and all of that
[1:06:54] do you know every situation you ever get
[1:06:57] in good or bad God already purpose know
[1:07:00] all about it
[1:07:02] every place that you go every scenery
[1:07:05] that you see all God purpose it
[1:07:09] and God knows all about it we have an
[1:07:12] awesome existent not existence not only
[1:07:16] us Mortals as humans but we are
[1:07:19] recognized in our position as sons and
[1:07:22] dust of God we have a off awesome
[1:07:25] existence here now with with Divine
[1:07:29] recognition upon us and recognizing the
[1:07:32] things that are happening around us for
[1:07:34] God's glory amen hallelujah see Philip
[1:07:39] baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:41] and there came forth the spirit of God
[1:07:44] upon Him of birth Hallelujah so it's
[1:07:48] sons and does of God can bring these
[1:07:50] people or these children to a birth
[1:07:53] remember brother Brandon repeats
[1:07:56] Remember The Germ has to come from the
[1:08:00] body
[1:08:02] what body
[1:08:04] Christ's body
[1:08:06] see and Philip was a member of that body
[1:08:12] Hallelujah
[1:08:14] and might not hear and being a member of
[1:08:18] that body he was subject to being used
[1:08:22] at any time by God
[1:08:25] because he was a part of that body
[1:08:29] Sam for URI don't just look at yourself
[1:08:32] oh I'm just a believer I just come to
[1:08:36] church and I serve God I sing I pray
[1:08:39] everything else like that no you are
[1:08:42] just as subject to the Holy Spirit as I
[1:08:45] am
[1:08:46] God may choose to use me more times
[1:08:50] and different ways then he will use you
[1:08:54] if you read your Bible you will see God
[1:08:57] will only sometimes he'll use one man of
[1:08:59] God one Prophet one servant once
[1:09:02] and you never hear of them again
[1:09:05] and you your job may even be done and
[1:09:08] you don't know it
[1:09:10] because he used you once
[1:09:13] and the rest of it
[1:09:15] you just using up your time until he
[1:09:18] calls
[1:09:20] you can use another one back and forth
[1:09:23] doing all kinds of thousands of this and
[1:09:26] that and the other yes
[1:09:28] but as I always repeat we all come back
[1:09:31] to the same pay
[1:09:34] at the end of the day
[1:09:36] one may have a little more Earthly Glory
[1:09:39] but all that can pass away
[1:09:42] is that right it's not Earthly Glory
[1:09:45] it's what God looks down there
[1:09:47] and he knows that you got like my father
[1:09:50] had when we were boys you have the Sheep
[1:09:53] he has the garden he got the chickens he
[1:09:55] got the Ducks he got the turkeys in this
[1:09:58] one this is the list here today you're
[1:10:00] gonna do this this this this
[1:10:02] is that right oh my the other of course
[1:10:06] you know I won't add that part but at
[1:10:08] the end of the day if you don't finish
[1:10:09] it then you will have a good talk with
[1:10:11] him a little talk with Jesus
[1:10:16] but the fact is that God knows exactly
[1:10:21] what every one of us our purpose here
[1:10:24] and what we have to do when we are here
[1:10:27] in this realm on this Earth for his
[1:10:30] glory and for his honor and he only has
[1:10:34] you and I as his hands his eyes his feet
[1:10:38] his ears his body
[1:10:41] is that right for him to flow true and
[1:10:45] to use for His Glory Hallelujah for The
[1:10:49] Germ has to come from the body
[1:10:52] and what body Christ's body and Philip
[1:10:57] was a member of that body I want you to
[1:11:00] see that this took same thing took place
[1:11:03] in Acts chapter 10 verse 48 you remember
[1:11:08] Peter was on the house stop praying
[1:11:10] amen everything has not changed from law
[1:11:14] yet to Grace because God was going to
[1:11:16] use Paul as the Apostle to change law to
[1:11:19] Grace now Allah over to Grace for them
[1:11:22] to recognize it but here it is he was in
[1:11:24] the house stop praying and uh God
[1:11:28] he saw all these unclean animals that
[1:11:31] according to the Old Testament they're
[1:11:33] not supposed to eat shrimp and rabbits
[1:11:35] and they're not supposed to eat cloven
[1:11:37] hoof goat and all this stuff you know
[1:11:40] they're not supposed to eat all those
[1:11:41] kinds of animals uh whatever and and
[1:11:46] while he was praying all of a sudden
[1:11:48] some men are knocking on his door
[1:11:51] and he's knocking on his door and they
[1:11:56] said well they came from this man called
[1:11:58] Cornelius and when we come here to
[1:12:02] um to for you to go and visit him
[1:12:05] because he wants to know more about this
[1:12:08] Jesus Christ and uh he he turned around
[1:12:12] the spitter that had told God that this
[1:12:15] is unclean Lord because the boy said
[1:12:17] rice Peter kill and eat kill and eat
[1:12:20] this is the very same thing over here
[1:12:23] you told us not to eat it now you're
[1:12:24] telling Michaela need it
[1:12:26] that the Bible contradict
[1:12:29] how can you do that but you see God
[1:12:32] revealed to him whatever I call clean
[1:12:35] it's clean
[1:12:38] whatever I say on in other words you're
[1:12:41] talking to God and if he says today this
[1:12:44] is a chair and tomorrow he said this is
[1:12:46] a throne it's a it's a throne it's
[1:12:49] whatever he says it is right but thank
[1:12:52] God God doesn't change anyway but the
[1:12:54] fact I'm just illustrating something
[1:12:55] there but the fact is God's word does
[1:12:59] not change
[1:13:00] now now notice
[1:13:04] where the Brandon says Oh my he says
[1:13:07] just talking about this I feel pretty
[1:13:09] good I I feel like traveling on oh my
[1:13:13] you see it's an angel come and said
[1:13:17] don't worry don't call nothing clean
[1:13:21] unclean just go on up don't think
[1:13:25] nothing just go right
[1:13:28] and then you see the the angel directed
[1:13:34] him right to Cornelius
[1:13:36] but the scripture says while Peter
[1:13:41] yet speak
[1:13:43] these words you see it was Peter that
[1:13:46] the word had to come true
[1:13:48] it's Peter The Germ had to flow through
[1:13:52] and while Peter yet speak these words
[1:13:55] notice the prophet says not the Angels
[1:13:58] speak in those words
[1:14:00] amen but the man Peter speaking those
[1:14:05] words oh my look look look at this look
[1:14:08] at this thought that maybe he was
[1:14:10] thinking that uh uh uh a angel that
[1:14:15] never sinned an angel that don't know
[1:14:18] about repentance don't no trouble don't
[1:14:21] no trials don't no griefs don't no
[1:14:24] sadness and and here is a man that sin
[1:14:27] that a man that was born in sin and
[1:14:31] shaped iniquity and have to be born
[1:14:34] again and God bypassed the angel and
[1:14:38] come to that man and use the man instead
[1:14:41] of an Angel we blessed brothers and
[1:14:44] sisters
[1:14:45] I said we are blessed Hallelujah
[1:14:48] that God would love a sinner such as I
[1:14:53] amen and change us in our whole lives in
[1:14:58] our whole walk and our sorrow changes as
[1:15:01] the song says into Bliss you see it is
[1:15:04] wild Peter yet spoke these words not the
[1:15:08] angel not no Cardinal not nothing else
[1:15:13] but while Peter was speaking these words
[1:15:17] Hallelujah why was that he was the body
[1:15:21] for that hour
[1:15:24] he was the body for that moment
[1:15:26] he was the body for that situation
[1:15:29] he was the body and under those
[1:15:31] circumstances you may be the body under
[1:15:35] a different circumstance you you may be
[1:15:38] the body that God can use and say lay
[1:15:40] your hands on that sick wall you may be
[1:15:43] the body that God will say pray pray
[1:15:45] pray for them amen you may be the body
[1:15:48] that God will say oh say to this one
[1:15:51] this or ask this person that or it might
[1:15:54] be something you're not even thinking
[1:15:56] about and before you know it you're
[1:15:57] saying this you're saying that or doing
[1:15:59] this because what you are part of that
[1:16:02] body and therefore you are subject to
[1:16:04] being used of God for his glory and for
[1:16:08] his honor amen he was the body
[1:16:12] and he had the word
[1:16:14] and that word took a hold oh brother
[1:16:20] the angel directed him but the life
[1:16:25] came through the body of Christ
[1:16:29] Hallelujah and the life always flows
[1:16:33] through the body of Christ
[1:16:36] amen praise God now notice
[1:16:40] also Paul and then I'm going to wind
[1:16:44] this up
[1:16:45] Paul on his way to Damascus
[1:16:48] a vision directed him
[1:16:51] see but
[1:16:54] ananias had to come
[1:16:58] for ananias had the germ he had the word
[1:17:03] for the word comes to the prophet
[1:17:07] let me say it in the words of a message
[1:17:09] we preached years ago the word always
[1:17:12] comes to the predestinated vessel
[1:17:16] because that's what it predestinator use
[1:17:19] in that age it has to come there oh my
[1:17:22] like Mary a virgin will conceive and
[1:17:25] bear a son God knows that words in the
[1:17:27] moment you know he knows the virtually
[1:17:29] remember you see so so where else is the
[1:17:32] word going to go where else is the Angel
[1:17:34] going to go where else is the holy
[1:17:37] spirit going to go to fulfill his word
[1:17:40] hallelujah it has to go to the body for
[1:17:44] that age to fulfill the word through
[1:17:47] that body
[1:17:48] oh praise God hallelujah and I'm glad to
[1:17:52] say I believe I'm a part of that body oh
[1:17:55] yes
[1:17:57] Paul
[1:17:59] ananias had the word amen and he had a
[1:18:05] vision saying go up and lay your hands
[1:18:07] on him
[1:18:09] and he said brother Saul the Lord
[1:18:11] appeared to you on the road and told him
[1:18:15] what happened amen praise God how did he
[1:18:19] know
[1:18:21] because he had the word
[1:18:24] amen that's how he knew he had the word
[1:18:28] oh my see oh my the word of the Lord
[1:18:33] come to the prophet he come and sent me
[1:18:36] here that I might lay my hands upon you
[1:18:41] that you'd be healed and receive your
[1:18:45] sight Hallelujah and the scales fell off
[1:18:49] his eyes he rose up was baptized in the
[1:18:51] name of Jesus and went to studying
[1:18:54] Angels directed it
[1:18:57] but you see
[1:18:59] then ananias had the germ is that right
[1:19:04] then he wanted to go on to Paul but he
[1:19:08] ended it around that thought somewhere
[1:19:10] around here he said you see Paul had all
[1:19:14] the studying and everything else but now
[1:19:16] Paul had the seed germ
[1:19:21] and you know all them Epistles the rest
[1:19:23] of it you see the effects of him
[1:19:25] recognizing who he was what was in him
[1:19:28] amen and he starts saying all these
[1:19:31] things about the power that worketh
[1:19:33] within us amen you're talking about God
[1:19:36] in us talks about the quickening power
[1:19:39] quickening us from the dead Hallelujah
[1:19:41] we thank God for brother Paul amen you
[1:19:44] see he says because it takes only the
[1:19:48] spirit of God
[1:19:49] moving on the seed to give life eternal
[1:19:53] praise God only the spirit of God moving
[1:19:58] on the seed in a person's heart
[1:20:01] can bring them to recognize
[1:20:05] that they are a part of that eternal
[1:20:07] life that we all call God
[1:20:11] we are a part of him
[1:20:14] Hallelujah revealed here on the Earth
[1:20:17] and God needs spiritual eunuchs do you
[1:20:20] believe that
[1:20:22] may God help each one of us to be
[1:20:26] faithful and true
[1:20:28] to be humble and to be surrendered so
