TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends it's a pleasure to be here with you again here we are praising god together giving him honor and glory in these dark and trying days but in the midst of the darkness there shines a bright and shining light jesus christ risen from the dead and alive forevermore we are happy that we can be with god's people in his house may the lord jesus christ bless you in a marvelous and wonderful way now our study will be in the seven church ages our subject today is recognized sonship recognized sonship our text is found in galatians chapter 4 reading from verses 4 to 7. but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through jesus christ amen praise be to his wonderful marvelous name gracious heavenly father we have just read out of your written word and we pray father you will take blessing honor and glory grant to us wisdom understanding inspiration for the giver the speaker and for the hearers may your word go forth in jesus name now our scripture tells us that when the fullness of time was come the fullness of time god sent forth his son made of a woman under the law praise god to redeem them that were under the law now of course friends we see here that his purpose of coming was for the purpose of redemption as i've said before my subject is recognize sonship now in the world in which we live as it was prophesied as in the days of noah marrying giving in marriage so we find that prevalent in our world today where uh children are being produced there might be no mother around or no father around or they don't know who their father is they don't know who their mother is or there may be a father somewhere but that father does not acknowledge or recognize that child that it is his child and therefore the child is unrecognized unacknowledged and this is what we are basically talking about here how that many today go around saying oh i'm a christian uh i'm a i'm a christian i i'm of this church i'm of the other church i belong to so-and-so churching but you see god hasn't recognized that god hasn't acknowledged that as his sonship for the bible says that god acknowledges for god had set forth the spirit of his son into their hearts now they are under a deception a delusion in which they're saying oh we receive the holy spirit they're trying to say they're claiming sonship but that's you claiming god as your father that's you claiming mr so and so that that is my father because i look like him you you you cultivated yourself to dress like a christian act like a christian walk like a christian talk like a christian uh that doesn't make you a christian and in the same way you don't just come up and say oh that god is my father i claim him because he is powerful because he is he's wealthy because he is so good and he blesses me and he's so loving and he's okay that's wonderful those are his qualities regardless but many are making false claims upon him when it is the opposite way around you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and no man comes to the father except by me and no man's comes to me except the father draws him so you see it is god who has to acknowledge you that you are his child praise god and then you have a valid birth certificate that you can hold on to knowing that you have that token you can hold to it praise god knowing who you are certain of who he is praise god and you can lift up your holy hands without wrath and doubting giving glory to your father's name praise god hallelujah but remember we were all in sin we were all misinformed misdirected going off in different directions some into churchianity some into sin pleasures all manner of different uh distractions that the devil will put but in the middle of it all we needed jesus christ to come on the scene with the power of redemption to redeem us and bring us back to god now the word redeem means to buy back in other words it is as if you were in a pawn shop and we were all in the devil's pawn shop oh and he was making good use of us and uh everything else use of us we were in the pawn shop but thank god our real honor jesus christ came and paid the price hallelujah paid the price for us for the bible says we were redeemed not with silver and gold amen but by the precious blood hallelujah of jesus christ amen so we've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb as the son said i've been redeemed how happy i am oh praise god i'm happy and delirious with the joy of god amen for yes we have been bought back we have been redeemed the price for our redemption was paid if the if the devil wanted to put you in jail god has paid your bond god has paid off any debts and you are set free amen and then when he brought you back then he acknowledges you or owns you or starts to make it known to the public there is my son just as it was with jesus when he was baptized in water the voice from heaven said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in praise god may god say and do the same for you this is my beloved child this is my beloved daughter here is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell in glory be to his name now the coming of the holy spirit to you and to i was not to make us sons and daughters was not to change us from wolves or pigs into sheep but the bible already told us every seed shall bring forth after its kind sheep will bring forth sheep wolves will bring forth wolves pigs will bring forth pigs and so if we our sons and daughters are children of god then we have to come forth from god not from a church a womb the womb of a church oh praise god we come from the very mind of god from before the foundation of the world and we had his life in us you see we already had to be his children i've explained this before you say oh i got saved and now i have eternal life no the word eternal means without the beginning and without an ending and god himself is the only eternal therefore for you or i or anyone to be recognized or acknowledged as a son a daughter of god they had to be eternal in him like you were in your natural father before you even knew and became born we were in god hallelujah before the foundation of the world and here we are now made manifested by god spoken word which is his original seed that he has used to bring you to a worth to bring you on the scene you and i are only now recognizing our eternal quality that was in us all the time but is now being made known to us so that the seed can germinate and we can come into life walk into his life walk into his power walk into him walking and being with us for he said i'll never leave you i'll be with you before i'll be with you to the very end of the age we also know in the scriptures gifts and callings of god are without repentance in other words before you even repented of your sins before you even started to become conscious of god and wanting to know him god was always there with you through your entire life from your birth right true and many of you can look back on your own life and know that except for the hand of god you might not have been here today it's you're here by the grace of almighty god god is the one that brought you all the way like he told jeremiah before you were even in your mother's belly i knew you i called you that's why you're here and that's why many of you are here it's because of the calling of almighty god and the recognition of god to you as his child he acknowledges you as his child by sending forth the spirit of jesus christ to live within your heart amen glory to his name he did not make us sons you we had to be already sons and daughters but now he is placing you positioning you acknowledging you and recognizing you for who you really are not a creature of time but you come from eternity and you're going back to eternity we're just passing through time eternal beings from the very side of god like adam's bride came from his side jesus bride came from his side when the blood flowed out in calvary and now we are showing god's showing that we were actually a part of him but we are now being revealed upon the earth by the holy spirit empowering us placing us positionally of and making known to the world who we are by acts by acts actions of the holy spirit through our lives the world begins to recognize that you are a child of god beloved now are we the sons and daughters of god hallelujah we were not aware of this peop other folk might have told you you were you might have thought you were you might you might have even been saying that you were but now your heavenly father comes places his hands on your head or upon your shoulder and says son daughter you are a child of mine oh i claim you in the name of jesus christ i claim you by the power of the holy spirit and that is what god is doing here today he is marking his own as paul said i am mark i am mark wherever i go wherever you go you're a mock woman wherever you go you're a mock man wherever you go you're a mock young person because the holy spirit is putting his mark or has put his mark upon you and acknowledging you that you are a christian now i'm a simon and i come in my father's name so you know even if my generation goes way back that my great great this name was simon hallelujah and now you come a christian glory to god you can go as far back as you like right back to eternity and you go as being a son or a part of the great jehovah hallelujah i was in my father in a seed form my father is in his father in a seed form in his father in the grandfather great great great way back and you god allowed you to travel through time until you come to this fullness of time when it is needful for you to be expressed and to be made manifested and and born into the world as a natural child is born into the world but now it's yes a spiritual child of god being born into the world and now recognizing who they are glory to his name as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized while you were out there in the world while you were jumping around with all manner of behavior not recognizing not having any idea of who you were just knowing something was strange and different about you but you didn't know what it was maybe even some people hinted towards towards you that you strange you're different you're odd you you you know you're an odd person whatever but something told you that there's something in you that made you different but you could not express it but in the fullness of time god by his spirit send forth the word of god to open your eyes of your understanding that you might recognize him that you might recognize where you come from recognize who yourself and that you might lift up your hand and say abba father or my father my father my father glory to god hallelujah amen for this natural being you have a natural father but for the being on the inside of you you got a spiritual father and that's the one i'm talking about when you lift your holy hands and hearts to god and say my father my father i'm coming home to thee oh i'm coming home coming home never more to rome open wide than arms of love i'm coming home praise god may many of you come home to him tonight may the great holy spirit of almighty god by the word of god speak to your heart to your soul and to your spiritual recognition to know who you are and what you were raised up for amen praise the lord that in you is the original life the life of god now being mad manifest in time or in a time being or in a child of god in a body of time that will pass away but the being on the inside is eternal and will live forever he that liveth and believeth in me though he were dead though he would appear that he died yet shall he also live hallelujah lord of god amen real true believers never die their flesh may die but the seed of god the germ the gene of god the god gene in you never dies it be there forever and ever and ever for all eternity amen we were held captive by the devil in all the habits in all the behaviors in all the captivity of sin amen there are two myriad for me to mention if you dimension them catalog them and write a book about sins of lying and stealing and smoking and drinking and womanizing and can't you'll have a great big black book but we are not here to categorize sins we know our own mistakes as individuals we know our own selves and the holy spirit it's between you and the holy spirit to speak to you and to recognize who you are but we are children of god listen because you are sons you see while we were in sin we couldn't even recognize our own selves that we were children of god hallelujah or the world could not hardly recognize that we were children of god because we were giving a false representation of god our father of who he is hallelujah upon whom did the spirit of god fall unto their pentecost sons they were already called by jesus christ they were already sons and then the spirit of god came upon those sons praise god hallelujah a current upon whom did the spirit of god fall they were already sons children of god and then the spirit of god came upon those children the position place to recognize them to the world of who they really are the bible said the spirit came upon all them that heard the word amen heart doesn't mean hearing with your ears because anyone can hear or praise god but he that hat an ear to hear let him hear in other words he that has been given an heir to hear let him hear the disciples came to jesus they said master how is it we understand clearly what you are saying but the pharisees don't seem to understand he says to them for unto you it is given to know or to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of god but unto them it is not given o praise god blessed is the man the woman the young person to whom god gives an ear the air of the heart praise god blind god gives us the sight insight inside sight of the heart to see to understand and recognize his word god gives us the air not the outer ear but the inner ear praise god that we might hear blessed is he that hear it my words that's what he means he that understands my word he that i permit to understand my word for people may read the bible for 100 years go to church for 40 years and they don't know anything about what they're hearing they can repeat the words they can memorize the words they can tell you what it says they they can make you look silly by by quoting so many scriptures to you uh you know and you can even um quote the name of jehovah and still be in wickedness right i and claim you're some kind of a witness but really your jehovah's wickedness but you can even know the bible back forth like that but that's not the knowing that he is talking about that just makes you a theologian is talking about the inner knowing the inner understanding and revelation from this word of god that is god his own interpreter and he will make it plain praise god hallelujah who is better someone to explain a book that i wrote to you or would you prefer for me to take my own book and then begin to explain to you what i wrote in my book that is what i'm talking about men have raised themselves up with professions and clerical this and clergy that and all men are named calling themselves cannons so and so when they're not a cannon they're a water pistol oh my lord have mercy think about it and here it is they're they're trying to explain to you what god is telling you in his word and god is saying no i will come and anoint my own people and i will let them know who i am for god is his own interpreter he will make it plain you've got to spend time with the author of the book the writer of the book for the book itself to reveal to you that you might know that you are his own amen what is the real baptism of the holy spirit speaking in towns absolutely not i've spoken in tongues but that's not the evidence of the holy spirit because i've seen people speak in tongues jump in the air run the floor scream holler so-called prophesy and everything else and when i discerned by the spirit of god it's nothing but a devil back there you say oh brother simon you're just no i'm not just talking i rebuked them in the name of jesus christ and had those devils speak back to me and answer and said oh you found me out you know who i am oh yes brother oh you yes there is genuine speaking in towns genuine interpretations genuine anointings of god but brother sister that's not the evidence of the holy spirit those are evidences of his presence but not the evidence of the holy ghost amen the evidence of the holy spirit praise god hallelujah my friends is the spirit of god coming and filling you after you have repented after you have heard the word recognize who you are being baptized in water amen in a real uh and having a real conscience towards god your conscience is no more hardened your conscience is no more rough against god but your heart becomes tender towards him and you want to love him and to serve him and to walk in his way with sincerity with genuineness amen that the holy spirit might use you as his child amen friends i want you to understand one thing about the mystery of god the mystery of one god for we believe in one god that god is not three god is not a trinity he is not three persons god has three offices but he is not three gods let me explain to you god the great holy spirit great spirit was there before the foundation of the world he knew of course man was going to sin genesis 3 he tells them he was going to send one who would bruise the serpent's head a promises of redemption are right through the bible then god had to then come in flesh for he was a spirit and his spirit and could not come and die as a spirit for his eternal so he had to take a human body that could die and the world could see that and recognize that and once god created a body in the womb of mary by the spoken word through a messenger or through an angel amen hallelujah then the word was made flesh and the word was god god himself was made flesh and dwelt among us they call this name what emmanuel god with us so emmanuel was here among us and that was god with us now god creating a body for him the great spirit to come and dwell in did not make him two for god the father who had created this body was now living in his son that is why jesus said the father that dwelleth in me he do it the works my father that dwell it in me then he turns around i and my father he never said r2 i and my father are one oh somebody says oh brother simon when you say that he also said when you when you you know he says i my father won that's one in agreement no it was that's not what he was saying when you see me you see the father philip don't you know me don't you recognize who i am because philip didn't understand what i'm telling you now and said lord show us the father and we will worship he says philip i i have been so long with you does thou not know me i and my father are one read your bible again read those scriptures again understand the word of god by revelation and let god speak to your heart and soul to know who he really is for god is not three persons god is one jesus dying on the cross bible says he gave up the ghost why because the spirit in him god's spirit in him was the holy spirit god is a spirit god is the holy spirit no wonder he said john 14. i will not leave your comfort less says i'll be with you to the very end of the age he said i'll send you another comforter doesn't mean another person but he's coming in another form amen and he will teach you and show you things to come hallelujah read that chapter and you'll see he begins saying i i he tells you that he himself is that comfortable praise the lord now i won't go into everything about that right now but i want you to understand that we serve one god not three no trinitarian doctrine which only came into being around 325 a.d and was introduced from paganism of romanism into christianity and adopted by the rest of protestants and then it was proliferated throughout the world but there was never any such a thing in christianity from the time of jesus and paul or way back before that apostles and patriots one god hallelujah so here we are brother sister in this season and time because we are not born by the spirit and then get baptized by the spirit it's one coming of the holy spirit to the you're born and filled you're filled you're born by the holy spirit amen it's one action of the presence of the holy spirit within your heart and life jesus made it clear he and he alone is lord god almighty amen coming into the believer john 14 16 the father will send another comforter verse 17 ah i will dwell in them and be in them verse 18 i will come in you and be with you verse 23 we the father and son will come into him hallelujah what is that we he's not talking about two people he's talking about in his office as father as his office as son as office as holy spirit father son and holy ghost has come into you in one person jesus christ into your heart by faith as you believe him and receive his blessed holy word amen the one person comprising the godhead amen glory to god amen yes brother sister recognize this as i bring this thought into being therefore we are not preaching to you a pre-existence of your soul pre-existence of souls we are not teaching and we do not believe in reincarnation or transmigration of souls because it is not you the person that comes predestinated from god but the germ or seed of god like my father's seed i am a manifestation of his seed god's spoken word is his original seed we are the manifestation of god's spoken word which is his seed and we have come to life by the preaching of that spoken word we have been awakened we have been dramatized by the power of the holy spirit bring you back to yourself to your life to recognize who you are and who your father is and that's why we are here tonight praising god and giving him glory amen way back before your mind could even grasp this this thought we were way back into the eternal god who had eternal thoughts and now those thoughts have become tangible and those thoughts have become you and me now manifest on the earth to carry out the divine will of our father glory be to his blessed name hallelujah lord of god i'm so happy that i am one of them i'm a thought of god now expressed in time amen glory to god what a wonderful thing to know that if we are the true seed of the living god then you will hear the word of god amen and the spirit of god will baptize you into the waters of the word of god the word of god will flood your mind flood your soul flood your spirit drench you drown you baptize you in the spirit of god by the word of god hallelujah amen it will fill your empire you and you will receive the word for your day not the word for some other day uh i'll just pass over this quickly the word for luther's day is dead it's like the man of the churn of israel had in the wilderness yesterday's manner is not good today wesley met to this manner was good yesterday and it's true but it's not good for today amen pentecostal mana was good it was good yesterday you used that you eat that yesterday but you see you're in a new day now and it's new angel food from the presence of god it's gold it's manna from the pot after the altar the golden altar the altar of covenant praise god the altar of it is comes fought from the presence of god hallelujah so here we are you're empowered to receive the word for your day and for your age oh how clear the evidence of the holy spirit is the word of god being revealed to you in your day and then you have a correct interpretation and understanding of the word of god only then you can be a real christian to go out and live it because you are beginning to live what you can see from your heart understand with your heart and then you can go out and live it other than that you are just impersonating you are just presuming and you are acting blindly without really having a clear understanding which can only be given to you by god himself giving to you a clear understanding of who he is who you are and what you were raised up for may the lord richly bless you my brothers and sisters of course i can speak more and more and more but this is just enough for now take the word of god listen to it again go into your bible search the scriptures and them you think you have eternal life ask god as james said if a person lacks wisdom let them ask of god who will give it to them liberally as he wills may god bless you as we introduce this this wonderful subject to you the recognition of sons and daughters of god has god recognize you oh you may recognize him and say oh i claim jesus as my savior oh but he needs to recognize you you see many times it's not just who you know it's who chooses to recognize you you may walk into a government office and say oh i know i know the supervised supervisor i know the manager i know the minister but the minister may pass you and not even look at you because he doesn't want to recognize you or he doesn't recognize you but if he wants to recognize you then god will turn his face to you your minister will turn to you and he will turn to you and said oh uh james john uh janet darcus esta uh pam uh claudia how are you how are you there herman how are you and then he'll call your name and everybody else in the building will turn around and see who's he calling oh it's that guy you see right away you're recognized you're positioned you're placed he's raised you up in the eyes of the public that's what god is doing right now by the opening of the word of god may god richly bless you and may the word of god be applied to your heart and to your life until we meet again on sunday for the word of god again pray for me as i pray for you god bless you friends [Music] you
