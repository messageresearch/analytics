[Applause] hallelujah boy that song is becoming a reality amen yes sir as we look around the world and the conditions of The World God bless you Saints thank you praise God we see that the hour of redemption draweth nigh we know that um the the scripture said very clearly when we start to see these things taking place around us and now we're seeing it on a daily basis we're seeing prophecy being fulfilled we're seeing um you know the the condition of Israel the state of uh Israel and what is happening there and you know I mean we could we could sit here and we could try to interpret everything but God is interpreting it all he's making it very clear you know we had this um this uh terrible attack back on October the 7th you know um I heard you know 107 there it is right there's 10:7 again it's in the scriptures we hear about it Revelations 10:7 we know the hour that we're living in what does it do right on October the 7th Bingo there it is in Israel um you know we're not putting any interpretation on that but all we know is that it's the hour it's the hour of Revelations 10:7 we know that it's the time in the season of The Mighty Angel and he's on the earth and he is dealing with everything but right now especially with you and me personally this is about a personal walk with the Lord and um it's important for us to recognize the hour that we're living in and to see where we fit into this whole prophetic event amen praise God and so this morning um we W to continue along the the theme of seeing yourself in the word um I believe it's something that um is absolutely vital in this hour it's what differentiates us as Christians in this world where everybody is claiming Christianity everybody's got an interpretation on the word of God everybody believes a certain aspect and they'll believe it in a certain way and you've got a trinitarian belief and you've got all kinds of different beliefs and um what's happened is that because they do not actually see themselves in the word they don't see the truth truth is the only thing that identifies you in the word of God and your life will will reflect the word of God and you know to say you're a Christian and have a different interpretation on God's word because of man's Doctrine or teaching it it Alters everything God can never honor man's teachings man's ideas man's interpretations and that's why it's of vital importance that we we allow the word of God to be The Interpreter Amen in this day and in this hour praise God so we're going to go to the first slide we're going to read um the scripture that we've been reading um over the last couple of services today we're going to we're going to just continue along a different uh uh frame it's still under the same series of rapturing Faith right this is the series that we've been um working on for many months now and I believe that there's rapturing Faith that's being re released to the bride and it all encompasses everything in the word of God for this day and this hour and what we're looking at here amen second Corinthians it says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord and changed into the same are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord and we're going to continue with another scripture here and today we're going to be looking at seeing my part in the word and so we'll be looking at it and it's it's just foundational we're still foundational in in all of this this is going to be a series that'll probably go on well into the new year by God's grace but let's just see what the Lord is going to do and Ephesians chapter 2: 20 and 22 it says and are built upon the foundations of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all building fitly framed together groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit amen let's pray father we so appreciate Lord this opportunity to come and fellowship around your word and to uh allow your spirit Lord this is the hour where man must move aside and allow the mighty Angel allow your spirit your anointing your word your your purpose your plan for each and every life to take control and to speak and Lord it is only then that we can truly be built and fitly joined together into this body that you have prepared in this last day Lord we ask your blessing upon the word of God may you anoint hearer and speaker this morning Lord we're we're just going to relax and allow your spirit to take control have your way father we thank you we give you all the glory we thank you for touching our pastor for raising him up Lord remember the brothers uh Pastor Simon brother Desmond brother coffee as they as they are brother coffee now in Africa ministering as they would go there to minister may your spirit your anointing move and go before them and and and and create the path that they must walk walk upon Lord to bring your word in season in the in the present stage of your ministry Lord use them in a supernatural way place an a a a protection made uh your angels encamp about them and go before them in everywhere and every place that they would lay their head to rest father May there be peace May there be safety may your anointing just give Liberty granted father we place them into your hands we commit them into your hands For Your Glory and Honor in Jesus name amen praise God you may be seated Saints Hallelujah glory to God so this morning we want to look at um we want to look at the fivefold ministry we want to look at what is the five-fold ministry we want to lay in some Foundation because I believe that if we have a a clear understanding how it is that God is speaking and communicating and doing what he is doing in this day and in this hour under the message of this hour it's important that we understand the ministry it's important that we understand the ministry that we are a part of how we fit how God has designed the ministry in such a way and when we look at the scripture you can go to the next slide we can look at the scripture in in chap in Ephesians chapter 4 from verses 11 to18 we're going to read this and then we're going to talk about it and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen so we know that we're going to come into the fullness of Christ because that's what this scripture is telling us there's going to be a church that is going to come into the fullness of Jesus Christ amen as as to this earth and how this world and this Earth is interpreting Jesus Christ unless they can recognize this scripture and understand what it is that it's doing then they will never come into the fullness of Christ that we henceforth now pay attention be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man and cunning craftiness whereby they let they lie in weight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love praise God forever more I mean there is just so much right there praise God but let's let's just take a look at a few things here's some notes you know I'm going to lay in a little bit of history about the fivefold ministry and um you know when we talk about the fivefold ministry what is it that we're actually talking about are we talking about today are we talking about what's taken place over the last couple of hundred years because the one that we're talking about is the one that is mentioned here in Ephesians chapter 4 and you know some will identify this chapter and this actual scripture as the Ascension gifts that Paul wrote about in Ephesians because it's said here that you know if you read the actual scripture Jesus ascended because he had descended God ascended because he had descended and while he was here he was displaying all these gifts in his ministry if you look back into his ministry you will see that Jesus was displaying every aspect of this gift and so over time it got kind of lost through the Dark Ages and you know the the church went through all kinds of change and we've come through the church ages but back in 1824 there was a gentleman by the name of Edward iring and he was a presbyterian Pastor in Scotland and he began teaching that the fivefold ministry of the Apostles the prophets the evangelists pastors and teachers had disappeared it's never disappeared but this is this is the world that we're living in now and these are the different kinds of interpretations of the fivefold ministry and how they're interpreting it and how they're seeing this right and so and you got to look and so I'm just bringing you a little bit of a history here so that we can come up to the day that we're in okay so that we can actually see what is the the true fivefold Ministry and why God Has It has never ever stopped it's always been in progress and and it's still going to be in progress and it's going to take us onto the fullness of Christ amen praise God but this this gentleman thought that it disappeared from the church and and it was in need of restoration so according to Irving the restoration of these Ministries would usher in the millennial Kingdom of Christ on the earth and we know that this fivefold ministry is going to usher in the millennial Kingdom but we need to understand what the fivefold ministry is irban and his followers began What's called the Catholic Apostolic church and it was established uh in In 1832 and he established 12 Apostles and he sent these Apostles out and he was figuring that you know God had given them him the Revelation that it was time for you know for for the church to be restored because the millennial kingdom was about to take place in 1896 another congregational Minister named John Alexander Dai founded the Christian Catholic Church in 1901 with 5,000 followers Dai established the city of Zion in Northeast Illinois in 1904 Dai announced that he had been divinely commissioned to be the first Apostle he then told his followers to anticipate the full restoration of the of apostolic Christianity now he was catching some inspiration he was you know obviously God is you know moving God is is his spirit is moving and and individuals are going to pick up just like Luther picked up you know the the the Revelation on justification just like Wesley picked up on sanctification and now we were and now here here they were entering this is look at 1906 this is when it was happening 1901 1904 and then you know in 1906 the community of Believers in the city of Zion began to break down and da he passed away the following year so he died just just in 1907 but here God was was moving in the power of his resurrection and individuals were catching inspiration because the spirit of God is a living present uh uh God that interprets his own word that he's moving and he's going to use man and he's going to inspire man and people are going to pick up on the revelation of what God is doing amen and so following the famed ofua Street Revival which took place in 1906 in Los Angeles California the emphasis of the restoration of the five-fold ministry and a mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit just returned just before the return of Christ reappeared and a new generation of Apostles emerged from that great movement in in isua Street and there was individuals here that are named you know one was an apostle to Italy another one to the to the slovenians another one to Europe another one you know Pentecostal denominations in Wales New Zealand Australia Canada the United States this was the Pentecostal movement this was the gifts coming back to the church it was a mighty move of God all part of the five-fold ministry amen all aspects of the holy spirit because it who gave the gifts who's The Giver of the gifts Jesus you see these individuals were were were inspired and they figured you know the five-fold ministry you know we need to raise up Apostles we need to raise up evangelists we need to raise up prophets God was doing it in their midst and they couldn't recognize the present stage of the ministry the ones that recognized that the spirit of God was re restoring the gifts which was the Pentecostal movement they were starting to see more and more what was going on but God had in 1909 on April the 9th a man by the name of William branam to be born in burksville Kentucky uh in order to to prepare a man that would be the prophet a real Prophet amen because prophets you know in the Bible part of the fivefold ministry there's there's Minor Prophets and there's Major Prophets and God was sending a major prophet to the Earth Amen to restore the word amen praise God hallelujah and so as the years rolled on after this 1906 uh movement things began to fade away again with the five-fold ministry and they didn't realize what was actually going on but God was raising up a prophet God had birthed from the womb you know prophets they are known of God they are ordained of God they are ordained from before the foundations of the world a true Prophet is not somebody that that that just decides okay I'm going to go to the church and I believe I've got a gift of prophecy on me I'm going to get the preachers to pray over me and that the spirit of Prophecy come upon me and that I be a prophet in the land that's not the way it works remember God gave the gifts amen God gives the gift God gives the ministry God is inspiring uh every aspect of the true five-fold Ministry it's always been Christ amen it's not man that that says oh we're going to put this brother as a as a a a a missionary we're going to put this brother as an evangelist we're going to put this brother as a a a pre a pastor we're going to ordain this one here as a as a teacher no that's not the way it works if God has a a gift that he's placed in your life it was there before the foundations of the world because you're an attribute of God you're a part of the word that's going to be a that's going to be part of the makeup of this fullness of Christ this body of Christ that's coming into her fullness right now in Bride form we need to realize the hour that we're living in and what it is that God is doing in this day in this hour and how his word is being released to the people to the Earth and to Christianity across the world period God has his own provided way of releasing and unveiling his word amen and he's always been his own interpreter amen praise God let's look at the next slide Hallelujah he gives gifts to people God gives the gifts not man God Anointed The Apostles back in the old test in the in the New Testament the New Testament Apostles like the scripture that we read in Ephesians chapter 2 upon the foundations of the Apostles and the prophets but Jesus Christ is still the Chief Cornerstone he is the he is the all and all and through all he is the beginning and the end all things exist by him amen praise God the world the worlds were were were framed by the word of God Amen we could never lose this thought and this foundational understanding that it's Jesus Christ he is the backbone of every Ministry of every calling of every individual that's placed in Ministry of every attribute of God God is in there and he's got a portion of himself in you that he needs to come into its rightful position so that you can see your part in the word of God too many people are tossed to and fro about well what do I do in the church what am I supposed to do I don't know your part your part will be interpreted by your life and by the Revelation that you're living by amen thank you your your life is going to interpret to me whether you whe whether you're an attribute of God or not you're going to believe the word you're going to see the word we're going to see eye to eye when it comes to the revelation of the word but God has diversities of gifts right within the ministry and God has different in you know ways of the word being expressed through each and every one of us I'm not going to express it the same way that Tim expresses it or Desmond expresses it or Phillip or Chris or Pastor Simon I'm G to express it the way God designed me to express it amen the way God has given me Faith in Revelation to express it I can only express the Revelation that I have I'm not going to turn around and say I got higher revelation than you I Got What I Got by the grace of God the moment I start saying well I can see things higher than you or I can I can see no no that's arrogance that's what that is because you're only seeing what you're seeing by the grace of God and what God is revealing to you as a part of the body and you're no more important than I am and I am no more important than you are we are all parts of the body of Jesus Christ all these man uh you know man's ways of interpreting the word of God and interpreting the five-fold ministry they've messed it up they make a mess of it and they actually push out the Holy Ghost and they want to they want to implement their own ideas their own interpretation no no he's an apostle oh no no he's not a pastor he should have never been a pastor he should have been a a an evangelist who who are you or who am I or anybody to say what God is going to how God is going to design each and every one of his attributes amen and it's God if you believe in the Supernatural element of that that Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church it's not going to be built upon man it's not going to be built upon man's ideas of how a church should run and how it should operate it's built on the revelation of Jesus Christ and when God wants to anoint an individual to fulfill a certain office he'll do it amen he will anoint you in whatever capacity he has given you Faith to fulfill amen you can never be me I could never be you but we all need one another amen hallelujah praise God and that's what we want to really look into so Apostles if you want to just look at it in in you know in in simple you know understanding Apostles they govern the church prophets they guide the church evangelists gathers the church pastors they guard the church teachers they ground the church and I want you to notice here too in in in Ephesians where he talked about you know pastors and teachers I want you to notice those two kind of come together they're like the yeah there's there's individuals that are really you know uh amazing teachers that can break the word down and you know lay in such history and foundation and everything else and then the pastor you know as as a a Shepherd guiding and guarding and watching over his his flock but you know uh you know you will see both aspects in a pastor you know sometimes God will have to use those those gifts all through one person sometimes you'll use it through one person based on availability within the ministry because it's required within the church it's needed within the church for this this uh anointing in this Revelation because remember God gave the five-fold ministry and the Ministries themselves to us so that we could be perfected am so that we could be edified it's all part of the edification and so God can sometimes put a spirit of of an evangelist on a pastor and and the spirit of a of a a a prophet where he's where he he can he can prophesy where he's got the ability to speak in tongues interpret the prophecy amen we need to see that we don't put you know we don't want to put guidelines on God's way of equipping the church and God's way of an anointing individuals and using individuals we want to allow the Holy Spirit to have his way period so that we can surrender ourselves and recognize the the message of this hour amen you know like you know they talk about you know that oh you just need to play the tapes you only need to play the tapes but wait a minute I do play the tapes I listen to the prophet I love the word of of of of God coming through the prophet I I agree with the prophet there's nothing I disagree with praise God but when you're telling me that all I need is that I'm going to say wait a minute God gave to the church pastors teachers evangelists prophets Apostles hang on a minute God gave those to the church you show me where he took them away yeah where where did it end I can show you where it started it started right there in the day of Pentecost when that anointing started to come down it was the spirit of Jesus Christ he says you go and wait you go and wait I'm going to send you the comforter which is the holy spirit which is me in spirit form and he will come in you and guide you into all truth that has never ever ever changed amen praise God you need the Holy Ghost to lead you and guide you into perfect Faith so that you can be in the Rapture so don't tell me all you got to do is listen to the tapes it's more than that it's Christ in the present stage of his ministry yes much was fulfilled through the ministry of William ROM and much is still being fulfilled through the ministry but don't make it the absolute and total you you no you don't need a pastor you don't need no and I know that that's not what's being said out of voice of God I I I hear Brother Joseph saying I'm part of the five-fold ministry I'm one of those ministers I get out there and Minister and I say Amen brother that's the truth but then you're going to get some that are going to be on the on the on the sidelines that are going to be saying no I don't need to be under a pastor you see they're using it as an excuse I can just send my tithes where I want no your tides are supposed to go where you get fed amen that's where you when you go to a restaurant we've heard our pastor say you go to a restaurant and you eat a nice five course meal you're not going to get up and leave and the the waiters going where you going no I'm going to go pay my bill over there at Kelsey I like that place wait a minute you just ate here what are you going over there for no you see like I'm just using an example there but the holy spirit is not the author of confusion he's going to make it clear where you belong where you are being fed where you where you your heart burns within you when you hear the word of God being preached and you know that that's God speaking to me that's God placing me that's God giving me the faith to actually move move into my position in the church so that I can be an effectual joint in the body of Jesus Christ that's what we're going to be looking at as we move through this whole series I want like my goal and my desire is that the Holy Spirit would just would just come into our midst through this ministry through the preaching and that the spirit of God will speak to you personally I can only give you my thoughts my my the notes that I the research that I put together but it takes takes the spirit of God to speak to you personally in your heart so that you know that hey I understand now what it is to be a Christian it's not just belonging to this church because I like this pastor or belonging to this church because it's more convenient it's closer to my home oh I belong to this church because you know they don't they don't ask for for ties and offerings you see when somebody is using the excuse that you don't need need a five-fold Ministry it's probably because they don't want to come under headship to the word of God Amen it's as simple as that they don't want to pay their tithes they don't want to that's right they feel like no I don't have to give my money to a man because that's no I'm going to give it to the ministry of Jesus Christ and the ministry of Jesus Christ was fulfilled through William brandom and so I don't need to believe anything else I can just I can just all my my offerings all my tithing I'm just going to focus it there and I don't need to belong to a church but yet the scripture says here and I've read it over and over again until we all come into the unity of the faith that means Revelation that means a revelation of the Rapture if that was already fulfilled and we didn't need the five-fold ministry then the Rapture is already gone come on now yes amen let's bring this where it's supposed to be what hour are we living in amen glory to God go to the next slide and so when we look at this we see it as leadership and fathering the apostles you know we see spiritual Insight Clarity of vision listen if we've ever received Clarity of vision through a prophetic Ministry it is through the ministry of William Mariam brandom if you have not looked deeply and read and and researched very closely with an open heart not based on because you see a lot of people you know you tell them about William brandom and they go to the Google right away Google and and it'll say and and they'll be they'll be lying here ly line line cult oh hang on a minute here this is a cult this is a cult oh you following a cult you you you're following a man Danny no did did you read did you sit long enough to search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life did you look deep enough did you prayerfully go there without a critical spirit without the kind of spirit that that's out there today that's that's so skeptical and and you know they got they got a theory for this and they've got a and and oh there's a there's another you know what do they call those theories you know that that they keep coming out with and everything else you know and exactly oh this another conspiracy theory to get your money to get you to follow another man don't you know that they talked about this don't you know that they saw this don't no don't you know that this scripture was fulfilled don't you know that it was it was Vindicated even by the FBI that there was a supernatural light that that that haloed over his head don't you know that it was doctor's affidavit Davids one after the other that said this person was dead and now they live this person had cancer and now it's gone why because God was vindicating his word but people don't want to go all the way guess what they're not designed to but let an attribute of God get a hold of that word and something awaken on the inside of the inside let me tell you they're not going to stop they're not they can't stop because something has awakened inside of them that says that's the truth I don't I don't fully understand it yet I don't understand every aspect but it's the truth something is bearing record within my heart that this man is not just an ordinary man this was not just another evangelist hallelujah amen this was was not just another preacher of healing no sir this was the word being released being manifested being given and being released to an to a to a an elected individual an elected body uh those who were predestinated from the foundations of the world oh now you're making yourself special Danny no I'm not I'd have been just as bad and just as terrible as anybody else out there living a life that's completely totally against God but God awoke the attribute it was placed there from before the foundations of the world there was nothing that I had to do with it I couldn't I couldn't put it on I couldn't try to put it you couldn't do any of it it's it's something that either you have it or you don't amen hallelujah it's as simple as that and when you have it you know it and and you rejoice because the word is is is is just like like fireworks constantly it burns within your heart you know it's the truth you know that you've come into the reality of Christ you know that it's just not another church Gathering you know that every time you come into the house of the Lord It's actually the Fulfillment of Ephesians chapter 4 where you are being edified by the word of God where you are being built up where you are being brought into the unity of the faith until you come into the fullness of your position in Christ Jesus amen praise God hallelujah you know a lot of churches they fall under that teaching of you know an understanding and you know and there's truth behind it it's the 8020 rule 20% of the people do 80% of the work in the church and so they try to give them a position and they try to say okay you know what you can be the Evangelist you can be this you can be that so that you know so that so that it's a title we don't we don't want titles we want the Holy Ghost amen we don't want a title we don't want to be you know exalted we don't want to be uh you know listen Pastor you know Pastor uh evangelist Apostle this and that those are titles and people will take them and and don't you know that I am a bishop don't you know that I am an apostle I am an apostle of this church and I have an authority in this region no what what is that that's man that's arrogance that's Pride that's not humility because every single office and you go back and you look at look at brother bram's Ministry you want to see humility you want to hear humility just listen to that man just watch and see that man's Ministry and and tell me that that was a man of arrogance that was not a man of arrogance that was a man of God Amen who knew that God God was there and and that he was accountable to God he learned some pretty hard lessons when he was just a man and when he was in his own thinking and his own ideas and would listen to other people meanwhile God had a calling upon his life and God has a calling upon your life amen and you have an important part you might think oh but I just clean the church that is just as important let's move on here I don't want to get too far along next slide so here now through these fivefold Ministry gifts therefore for perfecting and when you look at the word perfecting in Scripture it means equipping it means that it's it's it's to equip you it's to give you what you have need of in order to fulfill your part in the ministry you know a lot of people don't see and understand that but listen all you need to do is relax come under a Ministry sit and let the word of God have its effect on you you will start as you submit yourself humble yourself to the will of God God starts placing you you'll be unconscious of it all of a sudden you're behind the soundboard and you're not there just for one week or two weeks and then you're gone you're there you're consistently there you try to come in here on Sunday without anybody behind the soundboard it's going to change the whole thing you come in here and all of a sudden we got no piano player it changes the whole thing for the song leader you see all these aspects are Parts in the body of Christ that we don't realize but it's it's you're being equipped to actually be a part of the ministry so that that you can fulfill your part of the ministry and for the work of the ministry as it says equipping the ministry for the work of the ministry so that when you are equipped for the ministry you edify and bless the ministry amen you see God is giving us attributes God has given us God adds to the church such as should be saved on a regular basis because God is giving to this church and this is how I see it this is how I'm speaking it this is how I'm believing it that this church is going to grow that it's going to it's going to grow in in not just in numbers but in the quality of of the Sons and Daughters of God that are going to take their position and they are going to be blessed in that position let me tell you when you get into your rightful position in Christ you get blessed you get nourished you get the joint supplieth every need to itself you see so when when when when that individual that the piano player is there and she's doing her part and she's playing the the you know in the song service and I'm heing that piano and I'm I'm being blessed I'm being edified I'm being nourished by the office and by the gift that's being placed in there because now we're going to be looking at a lot of different gifts there isn't just these five gifts here these five gifts were given for the perfecting edifying bringing into Unity till we all come into the fullness of Christ but within those gifts are many other gifts that are there's about 20 different gifts in the scriptures and we're going to be looking at them so that somewhere along this series you're going to hear something that's going to strike your soul you're going to know that that's me you're you're going to see your part in the word you're going to recognize that there it is hallelujah that's my name being called now I see you sat long enough you you waited you you stayed in your in your position whatever it is that you're doing now you were being consistent if you're just a consistent Church attender do that amen and do it consistently don't let me see you for a week or two weeks and then you disappear for three be consistent in what you're doing because that's where God is going to feed you and position you and give you the faith that you need in order to be the attribute that you are so that when rapturing faith when that revelation of the Rapture comes into the body and sweeps over the body and and perfect love sweeping over you you're going to be right there in your position and you're going to go boom just like that amen because it's a body move Hallelujah and you're a part of that body thank you Jesus amen so now let's go on so perfecting equipping the ministry for the work of the ministry so that the edify of the body of Christ so that we grow in the unity of the faith which is revelation remember anytime you see faith in the scripture it's Revelation we're coming into a unified Revelation praise God that can never be listen if you're if you're you're fighting with somebody on Revelation somebody's off or both of you are okay because it's it's you don't you don't argue on Revelation somebody comes in and says brother I got a revelation on this that this is going to happen this is how it's going to be and you know if you're if you're if you're just you know a sheep right first of all if you're a sheep you're you're putting everything in its proper perspective and you're you're looking to your Shepherd you're understanding that God has a way of bringing forth his word in season so that you can receive what you have need of and a sheep is not a goat it's a sheep so when when somebody comes to you and starts to you know try to give you something that you know they got a revelation on this or they understand it this way or that way just be still say oh well praise God brother you know I don't quite see it clearly that way yet but man praise the Lord I'm just going to wait on the Lord I'm just going to let the Holy Spirit reveal it to me when it comes and then when it comes I you you know I I believe because I I'm I'm I'm I'm just letting him give me Revelation and you know so far I just I just love the Lord I love serving his people I just you know you know somebody will come to you with a report on somebody be careful be careful of those reports they start out as very innocent reports and before you know it it's gossip and it's a bad report and it's not a good thing to listen in on those things and accept those things because you're actually taking on a spirit you got to be careful of that and so when that say oh brother or sister have you talked to them about it I certainly don't see where I fit in here unless you're a deacon you're a pastor or somebody that that you know of authority that that's been that's been given the anointing and the position to deal with that thing then you leave it alone or you got guide them to their Pastor or their Deacon you see these are little simple things but this is all part of coming into the unity of the faith a lot of people don't don't see those simple things and that's why they'll go from one Church to the other Church to the next church because they don't want to come under subjection to the leadership of that church now I'm not saying every church is correct I'm not saying you know there's a false five-fold Ministry absolutely there's a true one and there's a false one there's dark there's there's light okay so you've got to but you got to know God's got to give you a personal revelation on where God is giving you faith and where God is giving you the understanding amen praise God hallelujah let's look at the next slide brother Brown speaking here in the message of Grace he says now but then there's five offices first is apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors that's ordained offices of God that's not an office that somebody gets elected to by the by by the pastor himself the pastor just doesn't turn around and say oh I'll make you an evangelist no what'll happen is there will be a gift around that individual and you'll notice them being invited to go out to minister to other churches the invitations open and you make yourself available and all of a sudden it starts to interpret itself and it starts to become real and all of a sudden God is showing that that individual has the gift of an evangelist like we want to keep it simple amen God ordains these offices men hold them see they no you can't wish for them you can't pray for them you're sovereignly given your born Hallelujah you're born a prophet is not a prophet if somebody lays hands on him and makes him a prophet a prophet's born from his mother's womb is a prophet see so he's always a prophet see God told Jeremiah said before you were even conceived in your mother's womb said I knowed you and Sanctified you and ordained you a prophet to the Nations that's right see Moses before he was born he was a proper child he was the prophet of the Lord all the rest of them coming forth Christ was the son of God from the Garden of Eden that's right see gifts and callings are without repentance but gifts are given to the body now we recognize that we recognize all these gifts God gives the gifts to the body you see when when like you know i' you know brother brother Danny why you preaching on this because we need to we need to understand the foundation of how you get into your position how it is that God places you into your position how it is that God gifts you you know like a singer for example when somebody has a voice to sing and to sing and then they surrender their life to the Lord you know how many voices are out there there's there's amazing singers out there look at Whitney Houston she started singing in church that's where she started to sing and became recognized for the beautiful voice that she had but then Hollywood got a hold of that voice and before you know it it was breaking records breaking uh you know hitting the top of the charts her her publicity went from zero to a million you know all of a sudden she was known throughout the world and she has a gift she had a gifted voice it was an amazing voice but it was not used for the glory of God amen and it therefore did not edify the true body of Jesus Christ but then there's going to be those gifts that God is just going to bring them in and then all of a sudden they're going to sing a song and while they're singing that song and you know maybe you're reading your Bible or you're thinking on something else and all of a sudden boom something strikes your soul and that song and that gift is blessing you and you're feeling blessed and you're you're you're receiving faith and encouragement and you're and you're you're just you're just rejoicing because every word that's being spoken is speaking to your heart speaking to your life meets a need for you that's a gift within the body of Christ and that gift is not for you it's for me it's for us yes it's it's so that it can be given to to for the glory of God so that the body of Christ can can be edified and built up as a result of it amen hallelujah praise God and so the next slide and then there's five minial offices how many believes that now these are ministerial offices brother braham's talking about this five-fold ministry because it's given to the church in order to to to bring all those aspects together so that we can come into the unity of the faith but God gives it I'm I'm I'm emphasizing that it's God that places the gifts it's God that anoints the individual it's God that gives the ability it's God's character in the individual it's God designing you from from growing up from from when you were a kid God designed you in a certain way so that that gift at the time that he wanted to place it into the body of Christ it could be ready and it could be used and it could be mature and it could have the right kind of character behind it sometimes people got great gifts got gifts of Prophecy Gifts of Revelation Gifts of but they don't have the right character and God still has to move and mold and shape the character so that the gift can be can be ministered in love in in a in in the right way so that the body can receive it you know it's everything works in such a way and God is not the author of confusion and that's why when when when it's truly of God that that he's that he's be behind that gift it will meet a need within the body of Christ it will feed you it will edify you you'll be nourished by the by the by The Joint that that individual is amen praise God so he says your five ministerial gifts how many believes that sure and that's first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelist how many knows that now how can you say there's a pastor or evangelist without saying there's a prophet how can you say there's a prophet when there isn't an apostle see some people like to say oh there's pastors and evangelists and teachers but they don't want to say prophets you see they're they're they're you know a lot of people don't understand listen the apostles doctrines that are written all throughout the New Testament from the Apostle Paul all the way down through Peter James every one of them every the book of Acts all all the doctrine that we need is all there there's no new doctrine so remember that that's why the scripture said in Ephesians chapter 2 there verse 20 to 22 that it's built upon the the apostles and the prophets and Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone here we need to see that that aspect can never change the apostles Doctrine the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ that was a doctrine of the Apostles that was written into the old into the New Testament that can never change that is the foundational teaching and God will not be the author of confusion and tell you it's okay you can be baptized into titles you can you might as well be baptized into into the name of the Rosa Sharon because it also describes Christ the lily of the valley why aren't you being baptized in the lily of the valley I baptize you why why doesn't that work because that's not the way the apostles laid in the doctrines and the foundations and the teachings of the original church that can never change never so when somebody tells you oh yeah oh well yeah we believe in the five-fold ministry oh praise God then but you know God is a trinity and when we baptize we baptized as adults and it doesn't matter how you're baptized as long as you go into the water you can even be sprinkled over your head that is not the word of God it's as simple as that you you can't build anything upon that that's why the foundations of the Apostles and then having God send us a prophet in the 20th century with a word for our day listen God sent uh who's the one Jonah brother Corey preached on Jonah there ministered on Jonah on Friday night prayer meeting and how Jonah was trying to run from his calling but let me tell you something God got him into his position he went to Nineveh he did what he was supposed to do and he converted the whole city okay because God's ways are not our ways but Jonah was the prophet for that day just like Moses was the one that God sent into pharaoh to say set my people free that was the prophet of that day Elijah when he came and he went up and he says not even do is going to fall until I call for it that was that day God sent us into all this confusion of Christianity because over the last 2,000 years the church has got completely into utter total confusion you've got two three four thousand different denominations and teachings on Christianity which one do you believe how do you know which one is the truth well what makes you think yours is the truth I'm not saying that it's the truth I'm just telling you to look and search for yourself so that you can be satisfied with the truth that you have because your salvation relies on that don't put it on me you don't have to listen to me if you're to this church only because oh well you know brother Danny's a good businessman and you know what I think I'll go to his church because you know I know him and you know uh I'll just follow him wrong that's not the way it works you're not following a man you're not following a teaching you're not following somebody's Doctrine you're following Christ the word the present stage of his ministry the Living God a supernatural listen this body edification if we start looking in we're going to be looking into some of the Greek words effectual you look at some of the Greek words that are being used in in these scriptures you're going to see that there's meanings behind them that that that you might not clearly understand but when you go back to the original Greek it means miraculous Miracles Supernatural there's going to be Supernatural elements in a true birth you are not want to be just left to some uh you know teaching of man you might come into the church here and you might get excited about what you're hearing and then you'll research you say oh boy this really did happen listen to this Prophet he's talking to this woman and he's telling her where where where she lived what city she came from man that's incredible that's amazing you know brother brandham would do certain things but that's not enough that's not going to be enough for you to actually be in the Rapture and to identify yourself in the mystical body the supernatural body of Jesus Christ that's going to go into Rapture when the Rapture happens I'll tell you right now 95% of the world out there is going to miss it they're not going to recognize it they're not going to know that it actually happened some of the ones that know you that you were talking about it and it takes place and how come boy Sharon didn't show up to work what's going on you know all all of a sudden you know Jack he he just where's he been for the last two weeks you know what's going on you know that's how small a group this is but that's you know how peculiar we are and we don't want to be peculiar we're not trying to be peculiar but it's what's been revealed to us it's the reality of Christ in our lives amen and it's a supernatural element and that needs to be in your experience you will know that you know Hallelujah now he says oh there's pastors some people say like like to say oh there's pastors and evangelists and teachers but they don't want to say prophets the same God said teachers and evangelists said prophets he keeps his word we don't pan knife it we just preach it that's what it is God's up it's up to God to take care of his own word do you believe that amen praise God forever more Allelujah so we know that these callings it's not of man it's all of God Amen and if God does it you're going to be a supernatural element within the church you're going to do things now don't be getting me wrong here and saying Supernatural what do you mean Dan you know like what's going to no the supernatural happens so often around the Sons and Daughters of God that it starts to become almost natural oh this happened I I was doing things this week and you know like certain things that that that happened like the simplest little things you know when I I went to go do something and I needed something to happen and uh and all of a sudden boom it just happened right there and I thought wow thank you Lord praise God you know I I I you know I was I was really not expecting that to happen but it just it does you see because we're human we're still human so don't don't make yourself anything more than a human but understand that there's an attribute of God in you there's a there's a purpose of God in you that purpose of God must find its place must get into its position it's it's its desire is the word of God it can only feed on the word of God it's going to feed on it into eternity it'll never stop feeding on the revelation of God's word don't you think sometimes like man what are we going to do all day long you know when we when we go into eternity it ain't going to be all day long it's going to be Eternal there ain't going to be a yesterday and a and a and a tomorrow it's just going to be now so right now I want to go and and take a trip through Europe on a nice boat with some of the Brethren and have some fellowship for six months in your mind it's six months because whatever there there's not going to be time or space and you're going to be feeding on the Eternal thoughts of God this all goes back you know this is the this is the Paradox now okay I'm going to hit you with a paradox the Paradox is this we're here on this Earth we've seen history for 6,000 years based on the Bible we know there's history that goes back hundreds of thousands of years maybe millions of years trillion years whatever we're here on this earth right now brother Brian you got to go to work tomorrow morning yeah a lot of us got to go to work tomorrow morning right now we got to bills then we got to deal with family issues this one is is is is causing a Havoc over here and then we got the boss to deal with and then we've got this flesh to deal with and this pain and that pain and all those you know this is all part of your human existence but the Paradox is that you are a son or daughter of God and that you are Eternal and that you are only in this world but you're not of this world amen you're not the person that you look at in the mirror you're the person that you look at in the word you need to see yourself in the word if all you're seeing is that person in the mirror then you're looking at the wrinkles then you're looking at oh my gosh then you're looking at this and you're looking at that and you're saying oh my goodness this and that I got to do this I got to do that but if you look at the Paradox which is that you are a son of God an attribute of God then all that just starts to fade away and here we are in the plan of God and we need to fulfill this part of the plan brother Desmond you're going to Africa next week you got to deal with that plane for so many hours that uncomfortable chair all those aspects that you got to deal with oh boy you're never going to get my wife on a 2our flight but this is the paradox of being a human being and dealing with this world and this life but then you're a Son of God then you that that that that what you shared with us this morning on that that wonderful experience that you had in the Lord and and in and and you you you you heard singing like you never heard before that's the reality that's the reality of who you really are but you've got to play out your part and find your position in the word a lot of people people you know when when you get to talking like this and I'm just talking to you I'm just talking to you like like you know this is life this is how it is you know you you you know this is you know if if you knew that next week the Rapture was going to happen you knew for sure God sends an angel down to meet and says prepare you're going in a week or God shows you that it's your time to go what would you do how would you live how who would you what would you say to people because that's the Paradox Saints in One Moment In One twinkling of an eye one day we're all going to be changed and we're going to be taken out of this Dimension and there's nothing that is going to change that nothing that you can do to change that amen let's wind it down let's go to the next slide God has sent in the church five different gifts Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors those are for the perfecting of the church that is his proof his ministering Spirit to the church to bring the body of Christ together now go to the next slide actually I want to read something before we go to this brother brandham speaking here in questions and answers in uh 1964 so he he gets the question here dearly below about the scripture of Ephesians 4:11 through do we all do we get all the perfecting of the Saints through the tapes or should we be here where the gifts of the Spirit are operating and the different offices of the church to help Pro protect us our hearts have believed all the word of the Lord this was the person's question brother brandham goes on and says so so the question is do we uh uh do we all do we all get all our perfecting of the Saints through the tapes brother Bram says no they want to come here to the church for the perfecting okay they want to come here see that's where we get Fellowship one with another here in the church see he's talking about that Fellowship that is in the Holy Ghost that is in a body that is under subjection to the five-fold ministry to the true five-fold Ministry they're under a real Pastor they're under and and within that church there's missionaries there's evangelists there's there's uh uh prophetic gifts there's teachers right within that Ministry that are operating and they are in there fellowshipping one with the other and it's there and through the simple little gifts of of you know Gifts of of discernment gifts of of uh um uh prophecy Gifts of uh helps within the church you know we've got some some incredible helps within this church we want to thank God for these helps that have that are that are that are just raising up they're not being oh told you got to do this or you got to do listen when you you want to see the definition of real Supernatural placing within the ministry just look and watch closely pay attention around you look at the things that are happening around you notice how certain things are being done how certain things are getting taken care of you're not even aware of it you're not even being told about it that it's not something hey I'm doing this hey I'm doing that that's not that's not a true gift a real gift it moves in a supernatural quiet way and it just edifies it just blesses it just encourages and that's what God is doing that's how he's doing it that's how he's building and how we want this church to be built we want this kind of Revelation coming on the people so that they can move and manifest by Revelation themselves seeing it like if your heart is not burning within you when you're hearing what I'm saying here then you're missing something you're you're you're just oh he wants to just he just wants everybody to work or he just wants everybody to to to to give or he just wants no that's a gift giving is a gift too did you know that I could show you through the scripture it's a gift God has anointed some individuals to be givers to support the body of Christ and that is a gift and that is not a gift that that's in the open it's not one that you see it's not one that's behind the pulpit talking to you every week you know it's because that's the mouth but you try and and remove you know just remove your liver say here go to the hospital say here take my liver you know I don't really see it I don't know what it's doing you know I I don't pay attention to it you know so you might as well have it yeah you won't last an hour you're as good as a dead man and a church that doesn't have all these hidden parts that are working in the background by revelation doing their part helping to to edify and strengthen and build the church without that the church starts to slip away this is not my church this is not your church this is the Church of God this is the body of Jesus Christ until you come into that Revelation that that's where you're going to fit and edify and build and and nourish and be a part of this church and and be blessed as a result of it you will automatically receive receive the blessings that come into this ministry whatever blessings God is going to pour into this ministry if you're a part of it you are just as equally going to receive your portion just like the pastor just like the deacons just like the trustees just like anybody else you will receive your blessing you will be encouraged you will be strengthened you will be encouraged by the word of God and you will not be doing it because you have to do it you'll be doing it because God called called you God gifted you God anointed you there's a big difference amen hallelujah praise God so he says we get Fellowship one with another here at the church but the perfecting comes between us and God hello amen did he say between us and God yes he did he said between us and God you personally the God that's in me is going to edify the god that's in you it's going to need one another because we

directing for us to participate in giving to the mission Services we have been outstanding givers for several years now we are recognized in their brochures and it's because we've got great givers right here in this church amen praise God and so again this year we are doing it and um you'll notice outside in the foyer there will be an area where you can bring the necessary Goods you should have received an email regarding what is being required there should be something on the bulletin board also so you can uh find out exactly how you can give if you don't have time to go out and buy those things and you just want to be able to give monetarily then that's fine also just put an offering in mark on it missions Hamilton whatever amount that you can give and it will go towards it and the sisters will do the shopping and get the goods that are required in order for this to be met amen praise God God everybody try and support that every little bit adds up and it becomes a great blessing amen praise God also we are having our uh annual Christmas dinner in December and um we're we're going to be having it again over here at the Burlington Convention Center everybody is welcome to join and to be a part of that dinner there should be absolutely no excuse if you are a church member that supports this ministry and have been coming to this church and you're just running short right now for example that's fine you put your name in you see your Deacon and you let them know that hey you know what I'm running short for this dinner um but you know what maybe you'll be able to give next year and you can give next year and all you need to do you know when God does bless you financially you just put it on there church Christmas dinner 2023 the the amount that you were supposed to give at that time that you you know it's perfectly fine you can give it then just as the Lord um makes a way for you amen praise God but we want everybody to be there if you're a part of this uh family amen now if you're not a regular member of the church or you've got friends that want to come they're absolutely welcome to come however they will be required to pay for their ticket and they will be paying also at the discounted price we are the actual cost of the tickets is $85 a person and we're charging 60 okay the church and others that that are able to financially support and give towards it are subsidizing it so that we can all be there like like we said God has gifts within the ministry God has Parts in the body that fill in where others and sometimes you know you you you think oh I'm running short there's nothing to be ashamed of that's that that happens it's happened to every single one of us it's life it's called life okay but God knows and if you have the right attitude towards that you can receive just as much the blessing being there having paid or not paid it's irrelevant we're happy to see you and because you've got the right Revelation you're not going to be one of these people that oh I went to the church Christmas dinner I never pay remember this body and edification is between you and God God bless you Saints have a wonderful week from glory to glory oh
