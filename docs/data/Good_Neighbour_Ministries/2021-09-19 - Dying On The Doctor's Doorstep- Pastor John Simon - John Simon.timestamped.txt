[20:35] i believe that our praise has been
[20:37] renewed
[20:39] and we are actually fulfilling the
[20:40] scriptures when we sing with an
[20:42] understanding
[20:44] and our praises come from all that he
[20:46] has given and when i think about all
[20:50] that he has given
[20:51] it causes me to dig
[20:53] deeper
[20:54] to bring something worthy of a god that
[20:57] he is
[20:58] and then when i think about what kind of
[21:00] a praise is that
[21:02] it reminds me of where we were when we
[21:05] sang with the morning stars
[21:07] and that is the atmosphere that you are

[52:12] give you a quotation here
[52:15] if i can find it here amen
[52:19] now
[52:23] the world is made by the word of god you
[52:28] know that
[52:30] it's framed
[52:32] together by the word
[52:34] that's the only thing
[52:37] that will
[52:38] keep it
[52:39] together
[52:41] amen see
[52:42] that's the only thing
[52:44] that will do that
[52:47] praise god
[52:48] hallelujah
[52:50] uh okay
[52:52] praise god
[52:55] amen just a moment here i'm just trying
[52:57] to find something directly
[53:00] where he spoke on that directly said it
[53:03] here
[53:05] now
[53:06] now let me show you the reason
[53:09] that the world is sick
[53:12] and the world has got to do it
[53:16] the the frame of this world
[53:20] with all the iron
[53:22] and all the brass
[53:24] and the materials of this earth has been
[53:29] pulled out of it
[53:33] it's framework it's pulled out
[53:36] for war
[53:39] for industry that's you know
[53:41] money-making business
[53:44] until now
[53:46] she's just about ready to go
[53:50] we've never had an earthquake till the
[53:52] other day
[53:54] over here now
[53:57] you see it's everywhere
[54:00] she's getting so thin that's the earth
[54:03] she's getting sin
[54:05] praise god because all everything is
[54:08] taken off from her frame
[54:11] if she was just a full
[54:13] woman
[54:14] now her body or framework he said she's
[54:18] getting sin
[54:19] right
[54:20] oh my
[54:22] why she's getting so thin
[54:25] because they've pulled everything out of
[54:28] it
[54:30] amen see
[54:33] it's politics so polluted
[54:38] is hardly any honest among them
[54:42] it's its system
[54:44] polluted
[54:46] its morals law
[54:50] and its religion it's just conquered
[54:54] sick
[54:55] yes sir
[54:57] very it's time for that sick seal
[55:00] pretty soon
[55:02] to open up
[55:04] and when she does oh my it ends
[55:08] the bride has gone forth she's done
[55:12] the queen has done went to take her
[55:15] place
[55:16] married to the king while all this is
[55:19] going on hallelujah
[55:22] and now it's time israel's remnant to be
[55:25] sealed and ready to go amen glory to god
[55:30] do you believe that
[55:32] i'm telling you that the very earth that
[55:35] we're standing on building on
[55:39] is sick
[55:41] and we're being told why it's sick
[55:44] that took out all the vitamins all the
[55:48] framework all the minerals all because
[55:51] of what war
[55:53] all because of what commerce in the
[55:56] stream money making
[55:58] amen
[55:59] while they're doing that
[56:02] they
[56:03] are
[56:04] becoming a patient
[56:07] because if you're sick
[56:09] jesus said
[56:11] some people but let me just pause here
[56:13] some people think when they're sick they
[56:14] don't need a doctor
[56:17] is that right
[56:19] i may not go and read all the quotes but
[56:21] i'm just going to talk to you i'm going
[56:23] to just pick them up when i feel like it
[56:26] brother branham said nonsense
[56:29] he says
[56:30] people
[56:31] a fellow saying he needs no doctor
[56:35] nonsense
[56:37] amen you jesus he said himself says
[56:41] this
[56:42] the sick needs a doctor
[56:45] hallelujah it's the whole that doesn't
[56:48] need a doctor but he says jesus himself
[56:51] in the word says if you're sick you need
[56:54] a doctor
[56:56] hallelujah
[56:57] i have quotations here where he says i
[57:00] respect doctors
[57:02] he says and god anoints them with
[57:06] whatever talents they have
[57:08] and uses them
[57:10] for the healing of the sick
[57:13] and any good they can do is for the
[57:15] glory of god
[57:17] we can touch on that we're going to
[57:19] touch on that a little later but
[57:21] nonsense to people talking another place
[57:24] he says
[57:25] they're talking about
[57:27] they're going to believe like the blood
[57:29] and they have faith in god so you have
[57:31] to go to a doctor i'll show you where he
[57:35] said listen
[57:37] matter of fact it's right in front of me
[57:39] i'm saying it and
[57:41] some it's in front of me here
[57:44] he said here
[57:45] now
[57:46] oh my
[57:49] a good honest doctor
[57:52] hallelujah
[57:53] he will do all he can with all the power
[57:57] that god will give him
[58:01] to operate on you
[58:03] and do things that he can to help you
[58:08] amen
[58:09] well
[58:10] i just have to tell you there's more
[58:13] than i this one is more than i can do
[58:17] if you want if he's an honest doctor
[58:19] he'll tell you go see another doctor
[58:23] get another opinion
[58:25] amen
[58:26] then you go to another doctor and you
[58:29] say nothing can be done
[58:31] it's too far advanced
[58:35] see
[58:36] when he says that
[58:39] now
[58:40] that is the time you go to god
[58:45] is that right
[58:46] you used up all the natural resource
[58:49] he placed these things naturally here
[58:51] for you to use
[58:53] you don't even touch that and you want
[58:55] to go direct to him
[58:57] not that he will answer you sometimes
[59:00] but the main thing is
[59:03] what he placed down here for you to use
[59:08] brother branham in this quotation he
[59:10] used that is the time that is the time
[59:13] that is the time that is the time that
[59:15] is the time over and over again to
[59:18] emphasize
[59:19] when he's telling you that is the time
[59:22] when you're really going to go and cry
[59:23] out to god
[59:25] but not from the very beginning the
[59:26] moment you feel something you you just
[59:29] run to god at the first thing that's
[59:32] okay too but he says use the doctors
[59:37] use hallelujah
[59:39] now
[59:40] that is the time
[59:42] that is the time you must begin to call
[59:46] on the sixth sense
[59:48] that is the time
[59:51] for you to go and accept god
[59:54] now i repeat that is the time for you
[59:59] now to rely upon your spirit of faith
[1:00:04] that god has put in you for god to heal
[1:00:07] you amen
[1:00:09] lord of god amen but you go to god
[1:00:12] before you try or you go to all the
[1:00:15] other things he put on the earth for you
[1:00:17] he put herbs he put medicines he put
[1:00:21] scientists he inspired them right
[1:00:24] because
[1:00:25] you know the quotes are here where he
[1:00:28] says god inspired him with an injection
[1:00:31] an inoculation a toxin
[1:00:34] and then you are so stubborn
[1:00:37] you are so stubborn and he uses another
[1:00:41] term he says you
[1:00:42] with your stubbornness you really are
[1:00:45] selfish
[1:00:47] you become selfish you become stubborn
[1:00:51] and you're rejecting the very thing god
[1:00:54] sent to you
[1:00:56] because god he says anoint that
[1:00:59] scientist
[1:01:00] with an inoculation
[1:01:03] another quote he says he says i pray god
[1:01:08] will will inspire uh them scientists
[1:01:12] for an injection that will even wipe out
[1:01:16] cancer
[1:01:17] oh god
[1:01:19] give them an uh an inoculation and
[1:01:22] invent
[1:01:23] an injection
[1:01:24] that will kill tuberculosis
[1:01:28] oh god it's three times he's going like
[1:01:31] that give them spread is the scientist
[1:01:33] he prayed for give them an inoculation
[1:01:37] some toxin
[1:01:39] that will wipe out whatever else is
[1:01:43] going to come
[1:01:44] amen he's praying for them
[1:01:47] he says oh god let it be
[1:01:51] my praise god hallelujah
[1:01:54] oh
[1:01:55] but we get so spiritually minded
[1:01:58] sometimes we know earthly good for our
[1:02:00] own selves
[1:02:02] and we reject the very thing god sends
[1:02:06] for us
[1:02:07] amen of course there's all kinds of
[1:02:10] excuses or they might put this in the
[1:02:12] medicine
[1:02:13] they might put that in the medicine
[1:02:16] maybe they change your rna your dna your
[1:02:19] this your that whatever
[1:02:21] what does a real christian have to think
[1:02:24] and worry about such nonsensical things
[1:02:27] you're starting to think like the world
[1:02:30] your mind going off on the things of the
[1:02:33] world
[1:02:34] when you start to think with all these
[1:02:36] conspiracies and all these ideas use
[1:02:39] chaos in your mind
[1:02:41] the bible tells us in the book of mark
[1:02:44] already if you are in your duty walking
[1:02:49] as a christian and serving god thou
[1:02:52] shalt eat any or drink any deadly thing
[1:02:56] and it shall not hurt you
[1:03:05] that doesn't mean you're gonna
[1:03:07] go i'm gonna prove god that
[1:03:10] i'm gonna put my hand in this barrel of
[1:03:12] snakes and poison us
[1:03:14] and if they bite me i can't die no
[1:03:16] that's you you're provoking god
[1:03:19] you you're just
[1:03:21] being nonsensical
[1:03:23] foolish that way to push your hand in
[1:03:25] like that our prophet said you're going
[1:03:27] to go take a bottle of medicine
[1:03:30] of a poison and go drink it
[1:03:33] you're not going to deliberately drink
[1:03:36] a bottle of poison to go prove god
[1:03:39] no you don't do that but if
[1:03:42] hallelujah you're in the line of service
[1:03:46] you're serving him faithfully you
[1:03:49] believe in his word
[1:03:51] you drink any somebody tries to poison
[1:03:54] you
[1:03:54] even your doctor
[1:03:56] any one of them try to poison you trying
[1:03:59] to kill you he says they shall drink any
[1:04:04] deadly thing and it shall not hurt them
[1:04:09] praise god hallelujah you know i was
[1:04:12] really going to speak on satan's prison
[1:04:15] house
[1:04:16] today
[1:04:17] but then during
[1:04:19] towards
[1:04:20] actually the end of the week somebody
[1:04:23] that was
[1:04:24] sick
[1:04:25] very ill
[1:04:26] called
[1:04:28] for prayer amen oh my
[1:04:31] and prayer was made and what want to
[1:04:34] thank god the person is out of the
[1:04:37] hospital because the doctor says well we
[1:04:41] don't know what happened the spine
[1:04:43] should have been broke they they should
[1:04:45] have been paralyzed or in a
[1:04:48] terrible situation but
[1:04:51] hallelujah
[1:04:52] their home walking with some pain
[1:04:58] but delivered
[1:05:00] by the power of god
[1:05:02] you see when the doctors don't know what
[1:05:05] to do they get to a point where the
[1:05:07] brand said when they go to that point
[1:05:10] that's when you start to pray and talk
[1:05:12] to god
[1:05:14] but once they can handle it naturally
[1:05:17] you don't really have to go to him not
[1:05:20] that you can't but you really shouldn't
[1:05:23] be going to him for all those little
[1:05:25] things but when he says they come to the
[1:05:27] end of their knowledge their wisdom and
[1:05:30] what they know oh my
[1:05:32] then they ought to give you over to a
[1:05:36] specialist
[1:05:38] hallelujah and if the specialists don't
[1:05:41] know what to do then if he's a good man
[1:05:44] he'll hand you over to that great
[1:05:47] physician jesus christ hallelujah
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:54] a great physician now is there a
[1:05:57] sympathizing jesus
[1:06:00] he speaks the drooping heart to chair or
[1:06:03] hear the voice of jesus christ amen
[1:06:06] they make jokes about it they're being
[1:06:09] lit
[1:06:10] but you don't understand
[1:06:12] oh praise god listen he says here one
[1:06:15] place he says you don't understand that
[1:06:19] they make an automobile and you take
[1:06:22] that to get fixed amen and when you are
[1:06:26] sick hallelujah and they can't fix it in
[1:06:31] any way you take it back to him now for
[1:06:35] he is your creator
[1:06:39] hallelujah your creator
[1:06:41] oh praise god i want to tell you today
[1:06:45] jesus can fix it
[1:06:47] maybe you have a situation in your life
[1:06:50] right now jesus can fix it
[1:06:53] maybe you're sick with what the doctors
[1:06:56] say is incurable amen jesus can fix it
[1:07:01] no matter what your situation is you
[1:07:05] must believe the true report you must
[1:07:09] believe the word of god by his stripes
[1:07:13] we are healed
[1:07:15] glory to god hallelujah
[1:07:19] is this what they call a healing service
[1:07:22] is this what they call a miracle service
[1:07:25] anything can happen if you believe the
[1:07:28] word of god the power of the holy spirit
[1:07:32] strike your soul
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:35] put your back on your good foot and let
[1:07:38] you run watch out and praise his holy
[1:07:41] name

[1:08:02] of it

[1:08:33] for men's hearts shall fail them at that
[1:08:37] time for fear
[1:08:39] he predicted a rise in heart failure
[1:08:44] and then we have a prophet of this 20th
[1:08:46] century
[1:08:47] that prophesied
[1:08:49] the rise of mental illness
[1:08:52] for it shall come to pass
[1:08:55] that the entire world will go insane

[1:12:08] minute
[1:12:09] you heard what he said her politics is

[1:12:32] not coming up with the word and not
[1:12:35] trying to do what's right by the word

[1:12:39] also destroy the church
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:46] denominationalism going along with
[1:12:48] nationalism women
[1:12:51] welded together one going down the road
[1:12:54] of politics the other one going the
[1:12:56] other way and what happens both becomes
[1:12:58] destroyed
[1:13:00] amen all these denominations destroyed
[1:13:04] because they reject the word of god
[1:13:07] hallelujah in the form of court i used
[1:13:10] he started out by saying you know the
[1:13:12] world is framed by the word of god
[1:13:16] spiritually then he suddenly switched he
[1:13:18] says but the framework of the earth with
[1:13:21] all the minerals and things he says
[1:13:23] they're pulling that out
[1:13:25] now if you're spiritual just switch back
[1:13:28] your mind
[1:13:29] where he talked about the world frame by
[1:13:32] the word of god well if you start taking
[1:13:34] out the minerals of the word you take
[1:13:37] out the revelation from the word you
[1:13:39] take out the vitamins from the world you
[1:13:42] take out the b12 from the word to give
[1:13:45] you blue stuff energy oh my goodness
[1:13:50] he said everything will what world's
[1:13:53] falling apart
[1:13:56] everything is going to fall apart
[1:13:58] because you don't have the word in it
[1:14:01] anymore and once the word is not in it
[1:14:04] brother glenn it's got to fall apart
[1:14:08] because everything is kept and held
[1:14:10] together by the word
[1:14:13] of the living god
[1:14:15] the church falls apart
[1:14:17] sick amen hallelujah he said what is it
[1:14:22] the world falling apart he said the
[1:14:25] whole thing is beginning to become
[1:14:28] corrupt
[1:14:29] they may the word of god of not affect
[1:14:32] by their traditions
[1:14:34] so the whole world system is falling
[1:14:38] apart
[1:14:39] every nation looking for some

[1:19:50] preacher they don't have to listen to
[1:19:53] the doctor they don't have to listen to
[1:19:55] the scientists they don't have to listen
[1:19:57] to any of the powers that god said i put
[1:20:00] these powers above you
[1:20:03] oh bad
[1:20:04] how you live
[1:20:06] these powers higher powers that i put
[1:20:08] above you render to caesar the things
[1:20:11] that are caesar and the kings that of
[1:20:13] god rendered to god amen they won't even
[1:20:17] do that basic
[1:20:19] they have some disrespect for the
[1:20:21] government and government power
[1:20:24] listening to the people of the world
[1:20:26] getting influenced by the people of the
[1:20:28] world and not listening to the word of
[1:20:30] god amen he said look even if you think
[1:20:35] they're bad i put them there to be a
[1:20:37] terror
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:39] he said to do what it's actually to keep
[1:20:42] those evil ones from destroying you
[1:20:46] because they they're there with that
[1:20:48] kind of power to keep in line those
[1:20:50] wicked evil ones and this earth hair
[1:20:53] from destroying you
[1:20:54] so even that he's using to protect you
[1:20:58] so the government is doing their job
[1:21:00] and we are supposed to understand that
[1:21:03] the government didn't tell you stop
[1:21:05] preaching in the name of jesus christ
[1:21:08] well we know that we ain't going to
[1:21:09] listen to that
[1:21:11] is that right
[1:21:12] they're not telling you nothing like
[1:21:14] that oh don't do this don't baptize in
[1:21:17] that name
[1:21:18] don't pray for they're not telling you
[1:21:20] anything like that
[1:21:22] amen and you're running off healthy
[1:21:24] skeleton listening to all these people
[1:21:26] tell you all kinds of this and that
[1:21:28] watching you too with all kind of videos
[1:21:31] about this did you hear this do you hear
[1:21:33] that do you hear that that's another
[1:21:35] jackass theory you're coming onto
[1:21:41] [Applause]
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:47] oh i hear this i hear that i hear you
[1:21:51] that's all you're full of
[1:21:53] no back to the word
[1:21:55] back to this bible amen
[1:21:58] back to the truth of the gospel of jesus
[1:22:01] christ amen
[1:22:02] let me tell you the government of morsi
[1:22:05] why do you think the government have
[1:22:06] parks
[1:22:09] because they know pressure is going to
[1:22:11] build up in the community
[1:22:13] in the minds of people and they need
[1:22:16] somewhere where they can connect back
[1:22:17] with nature and let off their pressure
[1:22:20] those are the natural means of allowing
[1:22:22] us to let off pressure is that right
[1:22:25] why do you think the government don't
[1:22:27] outlaw parties unless they go out of the
[1:22:32] boundaries of the laws they set they
[1:22:35] don't outlaw it because they know but
[1:22:38] that i don't believe in all that worldly
[1:22:40] dancing and carrying on but i'm
[1:22:43] understanding why the government is
[1:22:45] doing this and allowing this they
[1:22:47] they're not a sunday school they're the
[1:22:48] government
[1:22:49] so they're allowing that it's to let the
[1:22:52] people let off their pressures
[1:22:55] let off their worries
[1:22:57] let off their you know their drink they
[1:23:00] carry on this and that yup it's all
[1:23:02] wrong but the government understands
[1:23:04] they're letting off their pressure
[1:23:07] why do you think the government allowed
[1:23:09] churches to function and be tax-free
[1:23:13] you think the government is stupid it's
[1:23:14] because they want to lose money
[1:23:17] they are saving money because more
[1:23:20] people are keeping their mental health
[1:23:22] by coming in the church and serving god
[1:23:25] then they're going to have to go and pay
[1:23:27] in psychiatric hospitals out there
[1:23:29] and the government knows it
[1:23:33] so ministers regardless of what
[1:23:35] denomination they're from
[1:23:37] they're serving their purpose
[1:23:40] hallelujah listen listen my friends i am
[1:23:43] like
[1:23:44] myself and my brothers uh we wrestle in
[1:23:48] the house and you know we tumble up the
[1:23:51] bed and we fall down everything else
[1:23:54] like that and carry on like that but
[1:23:56] then when i go to the school
[1:24:00] and being as short as i was and some big
[1:24:03] tough guy come and push me around i know
[1:24:06] i can't beat him but when school is over
[1:24:11] and i see my big brother comes out
[1:24:14] i walk up to the guy knowing that my
[1:24:17] brother is looking i said who was that
[1:24:19] you were pushing this morning
[1:24:23] wow lord of god
[1:24:26] well that's what you got to do with the
[1:24:28] devil
[1:24:29] when you know jesus is back of you amen
[1:24:32] then you start to push him around
[1:24:34] because you know god is on your side by
[1:24:37] his traps you're healed you're delivered
[1:24:40] you're set free you're healed
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:46] all god asked believe it
[1:24:50] hallelujah he said oh but i didn't see
[1:24:53] the thing gone
[1:24:55] he didn't ask did you see it did you
[1:24:57] feel it he said do you believe it
[1:25:01] as long as you believe it
[1:25:03] you can receive what you believe
[1:25:07] it may go instantly it may take a period
[1:25:10] of time but it will go
[1:25:13] is that right
[1:25:15] oh my glory to god hallelujah brother
[1:25:19] sister let's look to this word of god
[1:25:21] there's more things in this word that we
[1:25:24] haven't even tapped into us yet
[1:25:27] i thank god for the wonderful man of god
[1:25:30] that god went before us
[1:25:32] i thank god for the storehouse
[1:25:36] this is there before us
[1:25:38] listen
[1:25:39] i said
[1:25:41] it will come to pass
[1:25:43] before the end time comes
[1:25:46] there will be a great woman
[1:25:50] that will stand up
[1:25:52] in the united states
[1:25:55] because she will rise up
[1:25:58] either to be
[1:26:00] president
[1:26:02] or put this into parenthesis
[1:26:06] perhaps maybe
[1:26:08] the woman being beautiful and attractive
[1:26:13] may also be the catholic church
[1:26:17] is that right
[1:26:20] but
[1:26:21] cruel at heart
[1:26:23] and she will lead
[1:26:26] the nation
[1:26:28] which whichever or whoever that woman is
[1:26:32] and i'm not suggesting anybody here i am
[1:26:35] just giving you the quote heir
[1:26:38] he's saying
[1:26:39] that woman which means she will become
[1:26:42] president
[1:26:43] will lead the nation
[1:26:46] to pollution
[1:26:48] and he's using the reference of what
[1:26:50] happened to israel how jezebel polluted
[1:26:53] israel
[1:26:54] and then he's saying this one that will
[1:26:56] come in the end time is going to lead
[1:26:58] the nation to pollution
[1:27:01] right
[1:27:03] and then
[1:27:04] it shall be come to pass at that time
[1:27:08] there will
[1:27:09] have an automobile
[1:27:12] perfected at that time
[1:27:16] into a place i looked and seen a family
[1:27:21] driving in an automobile
[1:27:24] that was glassed up
[1:27:27] and didn't have any steering wheel in it
[1:27:33] i seen the other day
[1:27:35] in popular mechanics
[1:27:37] that
[1:27:38] a machine like that
[1:27:41] has now already invented
[1:27:45] you can take that machine anywhere you
[1:27:49] want to
[1:27:50] and you will go anywhere
[1:27:53] by some sort of uh i don't know what
[1:27:57] some sort of radar control
[1:28:01] just set your post to this
[1:28:04] it goes right just set your post or
[1:28:08] place to this and it will just go right
[1:28:11] on you don't even need to do anything
[1:28:14] and remember it's glass top amen i just
[1:28:18] thought i'd drop that by you to see that
[1:28:20] we're living in that time now
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:24] we're living now in that time
[1:28:27] we are living witnesses of it
[1:28:30] because this was spoken since 1933
[1:28:34] [Music]
[1:28:35] amen
[1:28:36] a prophet speaking thus saith the lord
[1:28:40] well somebody's going to say well you
[1:28:42] know he says it could be in the year uh
[1:28:46] 1977 it could be this yeah but they
[1:28:49] don't uh understand he said it could be
[1:28:51] a hundred years
[1:28:53] it could be a thousand years from now i
[1:28:56] do not know i predict
[1:28:59] i do not prophesy
[1:29:02] i don't know but amen i just in other
[1:29:04] words he's saying i'm just telling you
[1:29:06] what i've seen
[1:29:07] amen exact time and all that kind of
[1:29:10] stuff that you worry about that but i'm
[1:29:11] telling you what i see and i seen this
[1:29:14] car driving like that we already have
[1:29:17] them moving now they're perfecting right
[1:29:20] now amen hallelujah
[1:29:23] oh my another place he said i looked and
[1:29:25] seen a family sitting there the car
[1:29:27] taking them wherever they want to go
[1:29:29] and they're eating and drinking and
[1:29:32] playing cards
[1:29:34] and not even paying attention to the
[1:29:36] road or nothing because the car is
[1:29:37] taking them there
[1:29:39] amen hallelujah brother sister what
[1:29:42] times are we living in
[1:29:44] oh praise god i think it's later than
[1:29:48] many people think
[1:29:51] amen
[1:29:52] yes sir
[1:29:54] oh my
[1:29:56] yes
[1:29:57] think of it brother sister
[1:29:59] so we got a
[1:30:02] the hospitals
[1:30:03] bulging with patients
[1:30:06] from florida to texas
[1:30:09] to california to almost everywhere
[1:30:13] the hospitals are bouncing with patients
[1:30:16] they don't have place to put that
[1:30:18] anymore
[1:30:19] and the the world
[1:30:21] the church
[1:30:23] it's bulging with patients
[1:30:26] right now
[1:30:27] oh my but what's the use you have in
[1:30:30] patients
[1:30:32] and you don't have a doctor
[1:30:34] you turn up to the hospitals just before
[1:30:37] i left home they were saying people were
[1:30:39] driving from one state going all the way
[1:30:43] to california some are heading up to
[1:30:46] washington the moment they hear that let
[1:30:48] the
[1:30:49] the one hospital ease up
[1:30:52] ease up with amount of people in it
[1:30:54] and uh they rush over there in droves in
[1:30:58] their cars by the time they get there it
[1:31:00] filled up again in the hospital we can't
[1:31:03] take you
[1:31:04] but the thing about it the one doctor
[1:31:06] said is it's not because people are
[1:31:10] getting better that the hospital is
[1:31:12] emptying out
[1:31:14] he says because they're dying so fast
[1:31:19] and when they die out and we have a
[1:31:21] space more come rushing in to take that
[1:31:24] space
[1:31:26] oh my god have mercy brother sister you
[1:31:30] there's no lack of patience
[1:31:33] but you know what jesus said
[1:31:36] they that the they that are whole they
[1:31:38] don't need the physician
[1:31:41] and when some of these people are whole
[1:31:43] and they're well and they're hearty and
[1:31:44] healthy they can talk all they want
[1:31:48] uh i i i don't have time to go searching
[1:31:50] for the quote he said sometimes god get
[1:31:52] to let some of those very things come on
[1:31:54] you
[1:31:57] right
[1:31:58] sometimes he will let them come and grab
[1:32:00] a hold of you he said are
[1:32:03] somebody close to you he said then we
[1:32:06] start to pay attention
[1:32:09] then we want to listen
[1:32:11] i've seen you seen it on tv
[1:32:13] oh i'm not going to take no injection
[1:32:15] i'm not going to do this i'm going to do
[1:32:17] that next thing you know when a woman
[1:32:20] sees her husband gone
[1:32:22] he gets it by morning and by night or
[1:32:24] the next day he's gone
[1:32:26] right
[1:32:28] the next thing you know her child got oh
[1:32:31] oh my goodness
[1:32:32] all of a sudden she's telling the
[1:32:34] wrestle children you got to get that you
[1:32:36] got to get it now right now come let me
[1:32:39] take you let's turn around right the
[1:32:42] other way but why you have to wait for
[1:32:44] that to happen
[1:32:46] why didn't you believe
[1:32:49] amen praise god hallelujah god have
[1:32:53] mercy that that does not
[1:32:55] have to happen to us like that amen
[1:32:59] praise god so
[1:33:03] we have the patience
[1:33:05] but with the patience
[1:33:07] and with the
[1:33:08] sickness and illnesses we got a problem
[1:33:12] and the problem is
[1:33:14] that the patients don't want the cure
[1:33:18] the patients don't want to take the
[1:33:20] medicine and the prophet is speaking of
[1:33:23] this in several places he says them
[1:33:26] patients
[1:33:28] wouldn't want to take the medicine
[1:33:31] he says and when that happens it's not
[1:33:34] the doctor's fault
[1:33:36] he said it's not there and he used the
[1:33:38] word scientist's fault
[1:33:40] he said and it wouldn't be the medicine
[1:33:43] fault
[1:33:44] he said with the fault of the patient
[1:33:48] who refused to take the medicine
[1:33:52] that was provided for them
[1:33:54] will be your own fault
[1:33:57] amen
[1:33:58] for not taking
[1:34:00] the medicine
[1:34:01] that was provided for you
[1:34:05] you can't blame the toxin
[1:34:07] because science
[1:34:10] was allowed to find it for the disease
[1:34:16] amen
[1:34:18] that's the way it is
[1:34:20] oh my
[1:34:22] listen
[1:34:23] here we are
[1:34:24] what good can the doctor do
[1:34:27] amen if the doctor comes and the sick
[1:34:31] will not accept him
[1:34:33] amen we need the doctor we need
[1:34:38] them to take
[1:34:39] his medicine
[1:34:41] you need that patient to take this
[1:34:43] medicine
[1:34:44] for we are living in a sick world
[1:34:48] we are living in a sick church
[1:34:51] he says and we are at a sick time
[1:34:56] that we are in
[1:34:57] at this time
[1:34:59] and if that patient dies on the doctor's
[1:35:03] doorstep you can't blame that doctor
[1:35:08] amen oh my just because the patient sits
[1:35:12] on his steps and turns around and says
[1:35:16] i'm going in there
[1:35:18] to take no remedy

[1:35:23] an honest doctor will work his hardest
[1:35:27] with all the power that god will give
[1:35:30] him oh my
[1:35:32] but when he gets so far advanced he
[1:35:35] can't do anything anymore that's the
[1:35:38] time you believe god
[1:35:40] that's the time to call on the sixth
[1:35:42] sense that's the time to accept god
[1:35:46] that's the time to rely upon the spirit
[1:35:49] of faith that god has put in you oh
[1:35:54] blessed be the name of the living god

[1:39:30] the one i have at home
[1:39:32] you got you couldn't travel unless you
[1:39:35] have one of these
[1:39:37] is that right you go
[1:39:40] on a plane and something like that which
[1:39:44] they wouldn't hardly let you on the
[1:39:45] plane but if somehow you slip by and you
[1:39:48] got on the plane you land in the other
[1:39:50] country and you don't have this to show
[1:39:52] you going back on it and go right back
[1:39:54] where you come from
[1:39:58] is that right
[1:40:00] and you got to have yellow fever vaccine
[1:40:04] you got to have the tyria
[1:40:06] you have
[1:40:07] a whole bunch of different things
[1:40:10] typhoid
[1:40:12] malaria
[1:40:14] a bunch of things matter of fact i think
[1:40:17] uh i sent a quotation to a few brothers
[1:40:21] where brother branham said uh
[1:40:23] i have to go uh overseas and now he says
[1:40:28] you know they're using me like a guinea
[1:40:30] pig they got a whole bunch of
[1:40:32] vaccination injections i have to get he
[1:40:36] says but you know that i don't really
[1:40:39] need that
[1:40:41] but they told me to take it
[1:40:46] and i'm taking
[1:40:48] all of them
[1:40:50] hallelujah he's taking them
[1:40:53] he never told anybody oh don't don't
[1:40:56] take that just believe god no no no he
[1:40:59] says no i am taking the vaccines
[1:41:03] is that right and he took them so that
[1:41:06] he could go and do whatever he has to do
[1:41:09] hallelujah my friends i use this and i i
[1:41:13] had to do that every year amen going to
[1:41:17] the sudan
[1:41:18] going among all those sick people going
[1:41:20] in the middle of the war had to have it
[1:41:23] go to the refugee camp in kenya uh amen
[1:41:27] had to have it you go in different parts
[1:41:30] praise god down to whether it's fiji or
[1:41:34] wherever you got to have it you don't
[1:41:37] have it they turn your back
[1:41:39] now the government says oh we have to
[1:41:42] revive that
[1:41:44] we need to have a vaccination passport
[1:41:48] and now people are acting like if it's
[1:41:50] something new
[1:41:53] is that right
[1:41:54] meanwhile they already have it in the
[1:41:56] schools
[1:41:58] that if your child don't have this they
[1:41:59] don't have this
[1:42:01] they can't go to the school
[1:42:03] because you're going to infect the other
[1:42:04] kids
[1:42:06] all right
[1:42:07] oh it's good for your kids but we we
[1:42:09] don't want no vaccine we don't want to
[1:42:12] have no no we don't want to have no
[1:42:13] passport and this and that it's idiotic
[1:42:16] thinking
[1:42:17] it's foolish thinking
[1:42:20] it's the thinking of the world
[1:42:22] and the church is sick because some of
[1:42:26] it is coming into the minds of people
[1:42:29] right in the church
[1:42:31] amen and i rebuke that spirit here today
[1:42:35] in the name of jesus christ of the glory
[1:42:38] of god

[1:42:44] leave the house of god leave the
[1:42:46] children of god leave the people of god

[1:42:52] be delivered from the poisoning of the
[1:42:55] mind
[1:42:56] glory to god hallelujah amen
[1:43:00] think about it like that the doctor you
[1:43:05] got a certain disease the doctor got the
[1:43:08] medicine on the inside but you just say
[1:43:11] i ain't going in there
[1:43:14] why are you not going in there i don't
[1:43:16] like the doctor
[1:43:19] is who gonna die
[1:43:21] the doctor or you
[1:43:25] you're just gonna die because you don't
[1:43:26] like the doctor
[1:43:28] or
[1:43:29] i'm not gonna die but you're taking a
[1:43:31] chance with your life
[1:43:33] not the doctor's life your life you're
[1:43:36] taking a chance with the doctors that's
[1:43:38] in the message called why
[1:43:40] he says i don't like the doctor i'm not
[1:43:42] going to take his medicine right
[1:43:45] you see my
[1:43:47] the doctor is willing he's waiting
[1:43:50] patiently on the patient amen and he's
[1:43:53] got plenty of it
[1:43:54] it's because the patient don't want to
[1:43:58] come and take that toxin
[1:44:01] that's the reason he dies amen and
[1:44:05] there's many people will sit right in
[1:44:08] the church
[1:44:10] and die in their pews
[1:44:14] they'll die in sin
[1:44:16] because they don't want to take
[1:44:18] god's remedy
[1:44:20] they don't want to take god's cure for
[1:44:23] sin
[1:44:24] and god has got a cure for sin
[1:44:27] hallelujah matter of fact he says god
[1:44:30] has a double cure for sin
[1:44:33] jesus is the double cure
[1:44:36] because he is the healer of sin and
[1:44:39] sickness
[1:44:40] glory to god hallelujah
[1:44:46] jesus the double cure don't you want
[1:44:49] this double cure in your life
[1:44:51] i said don't you want the double cure

[1:44:58] he's a healer of broken homes
[1:45:00] he's a healer of broken lives
[1:45:03] he's a healer of a broken world
[1:45:06] he's healer my friends of broken
[1:45:09] churches
[1:45:10] broken situations god is the mighty
[1:45:14] healer oh praise god hallelujah
[1:45:19] amen
[1:45:20] people don't want to take that cure and
[1:45:24] they'll die right there just imagine let
[1:45:27] me change the word you got the you got
[1:45:30] the doctor you wouldn't take his remedy
[1:45:32] god gave you a pastor
[1:45:35] and god
[1:45:36] inspires that pastor take this course of
[1:45:39] action
[1:45:41] you understand what you're doing when
[1:45:43] you say no
[1:45:45] i'm not doing that
[1:45:47] i'm doing what i feel like i'm doing
[1:45:50] right you see that spirit out there in
[1:45:52] the world that tell tell you that that
[1:45:54] you got your individual rights
[1:45:57] that's the odysseus spirit
[1:45:59] that's discerned right there people's
[1:46:02] rights
[1:46:03] is that right
[1:46:05] and then you you just take it casually
[1:46:07] because it's not a command
[1:46:09] right the preaching preacher's gonna
[1:46:11] come up and command just say oh you know
[1:46:14] this if you do this so you could do that
[1:46:16] or you could do that of course it is
[1:46:18] you're right and god doesn't force
[1:46:20] anything on anybody either of course it
[1:46:22] is your right which you got to make the
[1:46:25] choice but if you know what you're doing
[1:46:29] you will just go along with what god is
[1:46:31] saying
[1:46:32] you listen to what god is saying in his
[1:46:36] word and so god gives you
[1:46:38] a pastor but you wouldn't even listen to
[1:46:41] the pastor you you just think you're
[1:46:43] smarter uh he doesn't know he's talking
[1:46:46] about you know what you're talking about
[1:46:48] and what you know how to handle a
[1:46:49] situation well that's it oh my now
[1:46:54] remember this saints
[1:46:57] amen
[1:47:00] i do not take the place of any doctor
[1:47:06] for god has given us doctors
[1:47:11] and we are so thankful for them
[1:47:15] and i even try to work
[1:47:18] with the doctor
[1:47:21] if the doctor is giving you all the
[1:47:24] medicine now that's just as much as
[1:47:26] saying i work with the pastors
[1:47:28] all right god give us pastors god give
[1:47:31] us doctors right if the doctor giving
[1:47:35] you all the medicine that he knows how
[1:47:37] to give you
[1:47:39] and you can't get well
[1:47:41] or he's come to the point past his
[1:47:44] medical knowledge
[1:47:46] at that point
[1:47:48] then i feel
[1:47:51] is the time to go to god and ask god for
[1:47:56] his help
[1:47:57] you see how he again this is a different
[1:48:00] quote from the one he said that is the
[1:48:02] time now he said then
[1:48:05] right you come to this point
[1:48:08] where it's the end of medical knowledge
[1:48:11] then i feel we have the right to go to
[1:48:15] god and ask god to help us
[1:48:19] for he's the great physician
[1:48:23] and he has promised that he will do it
[1:48:26] amen and we must pray and believe
[1:48:30] for prayer changes things
[1:48:33] and the prayer of faith
[1:48:36] shall save the sick and the lord will
[1:48:39] raise them up do you believe it
[1:48:45] i must refer to this
[1:48:48] because
[1:48:50] that may be happening
[1:48:52] and that can happen while i'm still in
[1:48:54] the middle of speaking
[1:48:56] for while peter yet spake the holy ghost
[1:49:00] fell on all them that heard the word of
[1:49:02] god
[1:49:04] and while i was yet speaking i repeated
[1:49:07] over and over again there sat a man with
[1:49:10] a cancer in his throat and all of a
[1:49:12] sudden he felt like
[1:49:14] and before you know it he crossed up the
[1:49:17] cancer on the floor what was it oh my
[1:49:20] that devil knew that was the word was on
[1:49:24] the charge amen the word was on the
[1:49:27] charge amen michael was on the scene he
[1:49:30] had to get out of there in the name of
[1:49:33] jesus christ hallelujah and if thou
[1:49:36] canst believe you can be delivered right
[1:49:38] where you are
[1:49:41] hallelujah
[1:49:43] the prayer of faith will save the sick
[1:49:46] who gonna raise them up the preacher no
[1:49:49] the lord will raise them up may god
[1:49:52] raise you up right where you are right
[1:49:54] now i said my god raise you up right
[1:49:57] where you are right now and set you free
[1:50:01] from your ailment for his glory and for
[1:50:04] his honor amen
[1:50:06] hallelujah
[1:50:07] oh my
[1:50:08] if some critical doctor
[1:50:11] now he's talking about a doctor that
[1:50:12] don't even believe god
[1:50:14] was to tell you that you are not
[1:50:18] healed
[1:50:19] and
[1:50:20] he don't believe in that
[1:50:22] you just go right on and do what god
[1:50:26] told you to do according to his word
[1:50:29] don't listen to none of that from him
[1:50:32] amen
[1:50:34] go to another doctor
[1:50:36] if you want to see another doctor go to
[1:50:39] another one
[1:50:40] that will serve god
[1:50:42] imagine brother branham tell you going
[1:50:44] from doctor to doctor
[1:50:46] before you come to wit's end
[1:50:48] then
[1:50:50] now come to god they can't do anything
[1:50:52] anymore god can do it amen hallelujah
[1:50:56] oh my think of it
[1:50:59] now remember i repeat i am not against
[1:51:03] doctors
[1:51:06] i am not against medical treatments
[1:51:11] i am not against hospitals
[1:51:16] or any of that
[1:51:18] anything that can help anybody
[1:51:21] relieve
[1:51:22] this poor suffering humanity may god
[1:51:27] bless their every effort
[1:51:30] that they put forth
[1:51:32] and i pray
[1:51:34] that god will send some kind of a serum
[1:51:40] somewhere
[1:51:42] to someone of those scientists
[1:51:45] that will go out there and kill
[1:51:49] cancer
[1:51:50] that is in the world
[1:51:53] i hope
[1:51:54] that he will sense something else that
[1:51:57] will kill tb
[1:52:02] something
[1:52:03] that can do
[1:52:05] anything that can be done
[1:52:08] i trust god will do it
[1:52:11] and i now pray that he will do it amen
[1:52:17] that's the prayer that god will send
[1:52:19] some kind of injection or medicine that
[1:52:22] will kill cancer
[1:52:24] that will kill tuberculosis
[1:52:27] kill whatever viruses or diseases come
[1:52:31] and i pray that god will give this to
[1:52:36] the medical
[1:52:38] treatment to the scientists to the
[1:52:40] doctor and let them use it for to
[1:52:42] relieve suffering humanity
[1:52:45] is that right
[1:52:46] another blessing said all healing is of
[1:52:49] god
[1:52:51] all
[1:52:52] praise god i believe that
[1:52:56] amen you must know if you misusing the
[1:53:00] medical
[1:53:01] uh the medical practice
[1:53:05] and i must know for myself
[1:53:07] you know
[1:53:09] i like to share this i'm going to
[1:53:12] soon be winding this up more i can speak
[1:53:15] on this
[1:53:16] but listen
[1:53:18] now remember
[1:53:21] the
[1:53:22] serum is there
[1:53:25] the doctor is there
[1:53:28] and he sits on the doctor's doorstep
[1:53:31] sit right in the church
[1:53:33] sit right on the doctor's doorstep
[1:53:37] because he says why why is he sitting
[1:53:40] there
[1:53:41] because he is too stubborn
[1:53:44] to go in
[1:53:46] and to take the medicine that that
[1:53:49] doctor
[1:53:50] has got for him
[1:53:53] and he'll die on the doctor's doorstep
[1:53:56] sitting there
[1:53:57] the doctor says i've got the remedy for
[1:53:59] your ailment
[1:54:01] he repeats he says
[1:54:04] but he is just too stubborn
[1:54:08] right to go in
[1:54:11] think of it
[1:54:12] that fellow could die
[1:54:15] he won't take the medicine
[1:54:17] and there's plenty of the medicine but
[1:54:20] he is too stubborn to take the medicine
[1:54:25] then when he does that
[1:54:27] you cannot lay it on the doctor
[1:54:30] you cannot lay it on the medicine
[1:54:33] it's the person
[1:54:35] oh my
[1:54:36] and so is it today
[1:54:39] men and women will sit in the church
[1:54:41] and hear the unadulterated gospel in the
[1:54:45] power of the holy ghost
[1:54:47] see the manifestations of the spirit of
[1:54:50] the resurrected christ amen working in
[1:54:54] their midst
[1:54:55] and oh my
[1:54:57] and they reject it not because there is
[1:55:01] no bomb in gilead not because there is
[1:55:04] no physician there it's because them
[1:55:08] people are too stubborn to take the
[1:55:11] medicine amen what they are trying to do
[1:55:15] is trying to find their least way of
[1:55:19] resistance and by doing that they are
[1:55:23] going the way of the rest of the world
[1:55:29] and they are perishing
[1:55:33] in the game saying
[1:55:35] of korra
[1:55:37] you see
[1:55:39] do you know what i mean
[1:55:41] do you know what korra done
[1:55:44] amen some leader that gets the people
[1:55:47] all mixed up
[1:55:49] and they perish
[1:55:51] in that game saying or lies
[1:55:55] of quora
[1:55:57] is that right
[1:55:58] that's happening today and it's even
[1:56:00] infecting the mind of so-called church
[1:56:02] people or people that's supposed to be
[1:56:04] believers or christians amen
[1:56:08] amen see
[1:56:10] that's right let the doctor go as far as
[1:56:13] he could because they are these doctors
[1:56:17] let me tell you they are god's agent
[1:56:22] for some many times people come around
[1:56:26] me and say
[1:56:27] well
[1:56:29] we shouldn't have to go to a doctor
[1:56:33] this is in the message called
[1:56:35] the great warrior david
[1:56:39] they come and
[1:56:40] say
[1:56:42] we don't we shouldn't have to go to a
[1:56:44] doctor
[1:56:46] listen to brother branham
[1:56:48] i
[1:56:49] disagree
[1:56:52] i disagree
[1:56:54] with you
[1:56:55] no sir
[1:56:57] they are
[1:56:58] all god's agents
[1:57:02] see
[1:57:03] just the same as you need your
[1:57:06] automobile
[1:57:08] that is a scientific discovery
[1:57:11] right
[1:57:12] see
[1:57:13] that's right
[1:57:15] you will also get a lot better
[1:57:19] working with your doctor
[1:57:22] but the doctor really you know as a
[1:57:25] believer isn't your healer
[1:57:28] see
[1:57:29] god is your healer
[1:57:31] the doctor he says he'll touch here okay
[1:57:35] the quote says it here god's your healer
[1:57:38] you your doctor is only an assistant
[1:57:43] to god
[1:57:45] amen that's right but when the doctor
[1:57:48] goes as far as he can he comes to his
[1:57:52] limit for you see
[1:57:54] he
[1:57:56] can only work and what he can see and
[1:57:58] what he can feel
[1:58:00] and all that he knows
[1:58:03] but then
[1:58:04] god controls the rest
[1:58:07] is that right
[1:58:09] the doctor can cut the doctor
[1:58:11] so the doctor can give you medicines but
[1:58:14] then he himself have to sit back and
[1:58:16] wait
[1:58:18] for what
[1:58:19] he may send nature
[1:58:22] he's going to wait for nature to heal
[1:58:24] you
[1:58:25] he says nature because he don't believe
[1:58:28] or may not know
[1:58:29] but you are a believer
[1:58:32] all you want to trust is that the doctor
[1:58:34] does the best he can
[1:58:37] and then god does the healing
[1:58:39] for god is the healer amen and when the
[1:58:42] doctor comes to the end of his knowledge
[1:58:45] there
[1:58:46] then the prophet said automatically
[1:58:49] he'll send you to a specialist
[1:58:51] because the specialist knows more than
[1:58:53] he does in a certain area he's about
[1:58:55] what happens when this you come to the
[1:58:57] end the specialist doesn't know anymore
[1:58:59] he says that's when you're go to god
[1:59:02] he is your creator hallelujah he takes
[1:59:05] over from that oh praise god hallelujah
[1:59:09] he takes over
[1:59:11] and he makes you whole
[1:59:13] only belief
