must know who we are and know who he is it's now amen praise God God bless you Saints thank you worship team amen praise God as we move into Heavenly places we go there because we want to meet with the Lord amen and you got to leave everything behind you got to put the weak behind you you got to put all the the burdens behind you I know there's things that are heavy on your hearts but when you come into the house of the Lord on Wednesday night or on Sunday morning you need to you need to know that you're coming into his presence you need to know that you're coming into a an atmosphere where all things are possible where the word can speak to your very needs and your circumstances and the situations that you're dealing with and they and the answers can be received but you need to receive the answer you see that's the difference the Lord will speak to you and he'll give you the direction he'll speak to you through his uh provided way amen praise God a lot of times we have our own interpretation on how God has to speak to us but no we need to understand that that when we come into the house of the Lord and the man that stands behind this this Pulpit here is Anointed of God Amen if you truly believe that he's anointed of God okay and and and know that uh that we're living in a time in a season where there's a lot of false anointings amen but if you know then your faith has to be zeroed in that the voice of God will speak to your need and speak to the situation that you're dealing with if you don't have that kind of faith yet you're not moving under the ministry of this hour Ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints amen so God will anoint those offices and those positions because he can never lie no that's his word amen that's his provided way amen and everybody has a different level of faith that God needs to meet amen you know so you can't you can't come into the service and and be expecting that that God is only going to be speaking the supernatural opening of the word and the Seven Seals and the breaking of the word and and you know all these things when when there's some that are moving at a at a at a level and I I can tell you there's people that have been in this message for years that can't even get along with one another they got situations that where they can't even really love their brother or their sister and yet they've Walking with God for so many years but they still haven't got they haven't come into that Capstone the Capstone is perfect love and it casts out all unbelief when you can't you can't go in there brother Bram says he went beyond the curtain of time he said nothing but perfect love can enter into this place so think about that for a while and then and then ask yourself about the situations that you're dealing with and the circumstances that you're allowing the enemy to to to burden you with distract you with pull you away from you know oh I got to go to this church maybe I'll get it there oh I got to go here no you're running from God that's what you're doing God will meet you where you are and he'll speak through a donkey if he needs to do it amen amen praise God hallelujah I don't know how I got off on all that but praise God we're in the house of the Lord this morning I want to welcome each and every one of you into the house of the Lord amen I want to welcome our guests I want to welcome Emmanuel an with us this morning amen praise God you know um we love our children amen we love them with all of our heart we know that you know many of them are still out there and they're working on their testimonies that's all because God said all that you and your household okay now you can take that and a lot of people oh but they got to be the bride they got to be this listen don't put that kind of interpretation on it listen all I know is I'm going to tell you right now my children are blessed amen they're blessed because we are the sons and daughters of God and my children are blessed because we pray for them because we we we believe for them amen we apply the token whether they like it or not the blood is being applied Oh Glory to God Amen and and at some point if God listen while while we were yet sinners he loved us amen amen I can only go back and look at my own life and I was living life of total sin and unbelief a million miles from God but when God wants to call his own the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against him doing it so don't you worry about nothing just let the Lord do what he's doing you walk with God you make sure your calling and your election is for sure amen praise God I've seen it where kids all of a sudden come in and the parents go out what is it it's based on God's election it's based on Revelation amen praise God so we certainly welcome Emmanuel we we continue to pray for our children while they're out there praise God Amen um I just want to let you know uh that you know this week I don't know I don't believe uh Brother Joseph is Brother Joseph and sister Rachel here today uh I guess they're not here but anyways um you know we know that uh you know they they were going through a tremendous battle I love and appreciate them I want to say that they are a couple of the uh most courageous individuals that I've met amen they they they truly expressed Faith through this entire um event that they went through their little girl yel okay um that they named yahel you know God you know L is female you know she was a beautiful little girl you know um uh it's just in the plan of God that she had to go to heaven now amen praise God even to where their you know Joseph and Rachel had so much wisdom and you know they they taught their their little girl Abigail all about it and you know and Abigail you know is is a beautiful young little lady that uh you know she's only less than 5 years old but she's she was expressing faith and love you know even uh when we saw her um in the afternoon you know praise God they um they they had to let that child go into the hands of the Lord they had enough Faith to release that child and know that they will see her again that's what he said he said brother Danny says we've had to make that decision because you know they they they the doctors and the medical and everything else and they prayed and they believed that God can do anything and we believe that God can do anything and if God wanted to do it he would have done it but God has a purpose in everything that he does and all I could see is you know that that that they expressed Faith through it all now we were there at the funeral home and and they had the baby there and we saw it it was a beautiful little perfect little baby girl you know but God chose that it was her time to go to heaven amen and so we know you know absent from the body present with the Lord and you know I'll tell you I you know as I Was preparing for the funeral the Lord just showed me something you know in in David you know David went through a time where the Lord took one of his children you know he fasted and he prayed and he was asking the Lord to change his mind and everything else but after the baby had had had the Lord had taken the child David got up from his fasting and praying took a shower washed himself realized that that listen the Lord uh this child is not going to be coming back to me but what he said was that I will go to the child Hallelujah he knew that he would see that child again he knew and just like Joseph and Rachel they know they'll be reunited with that child just like brother branam when he went beyond the curtain of time he saw his daughter she says I was your daughter on Earth she was a young lady but she was only a baby of 18 months when she left this Earth amen and so there's faith in the hearts of the True Believers that regardless of what we're going through God will give us the faith to he'll never allow more than what you can handle and I saw you know you know I saw in the afternoon when we got together there was probably 40 or 50 of their family there and my goodness Rachel was sister Rachel was weeping and crying at the funeral home and and just you know just sobbing and mourning for that child like any mother but when she went home in that afternoon I saw the faith she wiped away the tears The Joy came on her she ate with us she fellowshipped with us he fellowshipped with us I saw an expression of faith and I know her family must have wondered because they they said brother Danny we're so glad that you were here and you were a part of this uh event for us it really meant a lot we wanted to we want our family to to recognize what it is that we believe they were they were concerned about their family amen praise God and so they've got a heart to see salvation in their home amen so let's continue to pray for them they're a beautiful addition to this local Ministry they're excited about being a part of the ministry their mother and uh Joseph's mother and father they are believers from from from when they were children amen they were brought up in this message of God in India and they are showing that faith and expressing that faith and it's absolutely wonderful I believe we're all going to be blessed and I believe that we need to pray for them that the Lord will continue to bless them and use them amen praise God so God bless you all let's um I don't want to keep you standing any longer let's go to the word of God Amen we are going to continue um where we left off um a couple of weeks ago the Lord's just led me you know there's there's a lot going on in the world right now with Israel amen and so you know nothing excites me more than to know that Israel is a perfect type of the true church the spiritual church she's the natural we're the spiritual everything is in perfect type and as you read and boy as I've been reading and studying this week you know countless hours of just reading and going through messages and quotes and the Bible and scriptures I am seeing so clearly how God had this tremendous Plan of Redemption and how he was expressing it naturally on the earth and now spiritually in us the true church the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and so let's see what the Lord is going to reveal to us if you've come here this morning with expectation in your hearts God is going to speak to you amen God is going to speak to the situations that you're dealing with through these uh you know through through the ministry this morning I truly believe that amen praise God so let's go to the scripture we're going to read from Daniel 12: 9-10 and and and he says here and he said go thy Way Daniel for thy for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried I believe that's he's talking about us amen many are going to be purified tried amen and made white but the wicked shall do wickedly the church is going to do what she knows needs to be done the enemy is going to try and do his job the best that he can because we know we're not fighting against Flesh and Blood amen but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand they they'll be doing what they're doing without any Revelation they think that they're going to win the battle you know Satan thinks that because you know he can afflict our lives and afflict our homes at times and and put division be between us and and try to you know uh get us to fight up at our at work or whatever it is that that that he's going to win the battle no God is already w won the battle amen why because the wise shall understand amen father we thank you for your word this morning Lord let that wisdom of your anointing come down into the midst of the house and Lord anoint speaker and hearer Lord that we can just rejoice in Heavenly places receiving the portion of the word that you've ordained for us today that's what we're interested in Lord the present truth Grant it we pray father in jesus' name amen God bless you Saints you may be seated amen praise God and so here brother brandham says next slide he says um this is the one most important scripture in the book what does it do it tells the closing of the Jewish Nation the Jewish people this scripture the 70 of weeks it discloses and tells exactly from the time that Daniel started there until the end of the consummation it's one of the greatest time pieces how many has heard me say if you want to know what day of the week it is look at the calendar if you want to know what time we're living in watch the Jews that's right there is God's calendar taken right from right here any Theologian any Bible scholar anyone will tell you that this is the time piece the Jews amen praise God and so you know like we said everything that we read scripturally about Israel you can look and find Jesus Christ speaking to you about yourself about your walk about how he's with you about how he is going to overshadow you he's going to give you your land amen and how that nobody is going to take your land if God gives you something there's nobody no no devil in hell that can take it away from you whatever is ordained to you is yours and nobody else can take it amen praise God and so when we look at Israel it's a prophetic time piece and so when we see Israel in this battle that's going on right now you can know that there's battles going around and around your life as the bride of Christ the True Church of God Amen Israel is fighting to keep their land the enemy is trying to take their land amen Israel is standing listen God gave you the word God gave you his his promises amen the devil's trying to steal your promises he's trying to steal what God has given you but you've got to hold the land you've got to stand upon the word if if you know if Israel is a minority it's because you the true church is a minority amen praise God Israel being rejected because she's God's chosen people well Jesus Christ said my sheep hear my voice and they'll follow me and when we go and turn around and we say hey we've heard the voice of God in our day we've heard that we're God's chosen people and the reason why we know we're God's chosen people is because we've recognized what he's doing now we're seeing what he's doing amongst the churches and we're recognizing that we have a part to to to fulfill in this day as a true Christian church amen praise God so if the chosen people of Israel are being rejected I can guarantee you that the true church she's being rejected amen amen praise God let's go to the next slide now we know that we've just come through these Jewish feasts okay now when I say Jewish feasts I also want you to you know I want to let you know that these are also our feasts now but the difference okay we understand you know we understand rashash Shana okay by Revelation that it was all about God's creation and that God had a plan in his mind mind that he was going to be a redeemer and that he was going to be a a father that he was going to be a Healer amen praise God and that we are we are celebrating that he is Jehovah Elohim the self-existent one the one that created all things and we've come to recognize him in this day that he's still in control of all things amen praise God everything that he did in the Book of Genesis was just a type of what he was going to do in the life of the body of Jesus Christ amen praise God so we understand about the Feast of yam Kapur rashash Shana was on October the 2nd to the 4th Feast of yam kapor October the 11th and 12th and now they're they're in the feast all part of the Feast of Tabernacles let's go to the next slide amen and and and and the Feast of of soot okay which is also a feast um it's you know uh SOC called also known as the Feast of Tabernacles amen or Feast of booths is a Torah uh you know commanded holiday celebr celebrated for seven days and this year it begins on the the 16th and it ends on the 23rd and it's all about the Feast of booths the you know the children of Israel remembering when they were in the wilderness that they had to you know be in these temporary booths amen but we know that all of these feasts here these are all the seven feasts of the lord we don't listen just like Christmas like Christmas it's it's a it's a tradition amen if there's any real feasts it's these feasts because these all type the Plan of Redemption the story of Jesus Christ the plan of God on how he came as a he as a as a cre Creator and how he expressed himself into the form of a family and how he had to come and that's why when we look at these seven feasts we see them it's not that we you know we we do them in in natural form okay it's it's more that we have a revelation of the Passover amen we have a revelation of the unleavened bread we have a revelation of the first fruits we have a revelation of Pentecost amen we have a revelation of the trumpets which is the season that we're currently in amen praise God because the trumpets is all about uh uh uh the Gathering when the trumpet sounded it was because they were gathering the people to a certain Feast they were gathering the people to come unto the Lord so that the Lord could speak to them they would have holy convocations which is what gatherings in the house of the Lord what are we doing this morning we are under the Feast of trumpets amen because the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air there is an in gathering going on right now amen praise God and so we have a revelation of all of these feasts we know that there's going to be the atonement that's going to come to the Jews but guess what we can't be here for that to happen Oh Glory to God Amen that's why when we look at this time piece when we look at these feasts when we see the condition of Israel and what is going on in Israel what what God is is asking us to do while we're still here is recognize the time recognize the hour but also recognize that you are the Gentile church that you are the ones that at some point that dispensation the Gentile dispensation is going to end amen and so there's something that that that we need to recognize so that we in the part that we are to fulfill gives us the faith to know what we are to do with the word we need to know what it is that God has called us the true church in this day and in this hour to do in order for this prophecy of God the Messiah coming to his own Amen in Israel listen God deals with Israel as a nation not as individuals so if God is dealing with them as a nation that's why he had them go back to Israel in 1948 and it's not all Israel that's going to be saved it's the 144,000 the 12 tribes of of Judah the 12 tribes that that that God ordained to be the elected that those are the chosen the election of God Amen praise God God has a book and in that book is written the Lamb's Book of Life it contains the names of every son and every daughter of God and your name has to be called amen praise God and so we need to realize that this time that we're living in is an important time let's move on Amen so Israel will come to recognize that all the Traditions they were at some point when this atonement strikes Israel they're going to realize all these Traditions that they've been doing going to you know the Feast of of of of yam Kapur and and rashash Shana and going to the Tabernacle it was all for for in their minds it's it's it's all tradition because they are doing what God asked them to do but yet they will come to realize that all of those Traditions will be culminated when the Messiah reveals himself to them because they they don't realize that they're doing all these things out of works but when when it's like it's like the churches today everything they're doing it's out of Works they're they're they they join they come together on Sunday they don't care what's being preached over the pulpit they don't realize that there's doctrines of man that's being preached and they believe that that's okay you see they've taken the traditions of man they've taken uh traditions and allowed those things to be their absolute when when God is telling us clearly that there's only one absolute and that is the pure unadulterated word of God Amen praise God and so they are going to come to realize and the Lord um is currently doing this for the church he's bringing us out of tradition he's bringing us out of out of those those oh I'm I'm I'm a church member I belong to this church my father was a Baptist so I'm a Baptist oh my parents were Roman Catholic so I'm Roman Catholic you ask them if they've been baptized or tell you oh yeah I got baptized as a baby that is not a legitimate baptism we don't baptize babies because babies cannot believe we dedicate them unto the Lord amen and the Lord promises that he will be with them watch over them and and overshadow their lives and at their appointed time in season he will awaken them to know who they truly are and have a conscious Revelation and relationship with God Amen praise God and so these these feasts of the lord they're all types they're all wonderful but they're all for Israel to be until the time that they come to their Great Awakening amen praise God so let's move on so today I want to talk a little bit about like the theme of what we're going to be speaking on today is the time of Jubilee because I believe that we're living in a Time listen when Israel does have their atonement there's going to be a tremendous Jubilee amen there's going to be a time where they're going to come to realize who Jesus Christ really was that they actually missed the Messiah but right now this Church the true body of Jesus Christ she is in her time of Jubilee and if they're not in their time of Jubilee they need to come to know the true Jubilee they need to come to understand that we are in the time of Jubilee and you need to be set free from the bondage of your denominational Church uh uh mentality and way of thinking that that that you're that you're actually worshiping God and not realizing that you're not worshiping God but you're actually worshiping the traditions of man the teachings of man and anything that is not of God is of the enemy remember his goal is one thing to deceive to deceive and he's doing a great job of it the Bible says that that in the end time which is where we are right now that the whole world would be in a state of deception imagine the whole world would be deceived except the Bible says except those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life and how do you know your name's written in the book of life because you recognize that when Christ does something in your day you can say Amen to it and you can come out of the tradition you look back at the tradition you say that's a lie that's not in the word of God when when you see baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ every baptism in the book of Acts there was over 8,000 of them every one of them done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you look back at your experience in your church whether it's Baptist whether it's uh Pentecostal Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran whatever it is and they're teaching you about a trinity and that when you're baptized you baptize in the name of the father and of the the son and of the Holy Spirit and you're just sitting there and you're going wait a minute here the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit is Jesus Christ that's why when Jesus stood there and he rose he had just risen from the dead and he he come to his disciples he said go into all nations but listen what he said before that he says all power has been given unto me now if he's got all the power where's the father's power he said all power in heaven and on Earth you're looking at you're looking at the Supreme deity he that created the heavens and the Earth he that there was no one before him no one after him no one beside him the scripture even says not even a savior because I am the savior he says amen he's he was standing there the supreme authority of God and he says all power has been given unto me so now you need to go out into the world baptizing them in the name he didn't say names he said in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit and those disciples were sitting right there and Peter knew exactly what he was saying he says yes Lord that name is Jesus Christ and that's why on the day of Pentecost when they asked Peter what must we do to be saved and a lot of people will ask you when you're out there and you're a living testimony of this word if the ABCs aren't right they're not going to start right they're not going to end right and they turn and they say you how well what what do I need to do I tell them straight up I said you need to repent from your unbelief wh what unbelief the the fact that you believe in the traditions of your church in the teachings of your ministers in the in the tradition s of of men that have lived for hundreds of years and they're teaching these doctrines of the Trinity and everything else you need to repent of all of that and then you need to be baptized properly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your unbelief that's why you get buried and you start a brand new life and that starts you on the right foot amen that gets you started right now God is is obligated according to his word he says you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and what does it say in Acts 238 and you shall receive the token you shall receive your seal which is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will seal you and fill you and now when you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you go back to read that word you're going to see the word and you're going to read the word in a different light Al together it's going to be a brand new Bible to you your whole experience is going to be completely different everything around you will be completely different you will see that Jesus what he meant by the truth shall set you free amen praise God and so we're talking about a Jubilee today we're talking about it's time for the Jubilee and it's time for some people that are still locked into tradition some people that are still locked into their mental attitudes of of how they see the word and how that the word that it's only the way that they see it it's not God is his own interpreter you want to really you you really want to see the word you need to humble yourself you need to allow the Holy Spirit to reveal to you in the Simplicity in his Simplicity what is real truth amen Leviticus 23:27 next slide says says also on the 10th day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement it shall be an holy convocation unto you and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord listen you know what that offering by fire is it's a deep call to the Deep am it's the Holy Ghost in you it's now the Life of Christ in you now you're offering back the Revelation that you are a son or a daughter of God because the fire of God is what's now being offered back to the Lord without faith you can never please the lord it's not about listen to them they had to bring a an offering and and they had to put the blood on the altar they had to they had to Slit the throat of the lamb and the life that was on that lamb they the Innocence they would accept it onto themselves and God would allow that and he's still to you know he's still uh because of Israel's blindness they remain under that that that's why they they they got to set up the temple they got to re they got to do the sacrifice they got to do the rituals to them that is what is going to bring God on the scene amen they they don't realize that that their blindness is going to be lifted and they're going to realize that that's not what's required that their blindness is going to bring bring them to an Awakening that their Messiah was Jesus Christ and then they're going to weep and they're going to whail and they're going to mourn saying oh where did you get those those those those you know Blood Stained hands with the you know with the with the scars on your hands and he says in the house of my friends in in in my own family I I was rejected by my own amen they're not going to realize but that's part of the Great Awakening that's all part of the Fulfillment of Prophecy amen praise God but we we receive the Holy Ghost because the life is not the life of a lamb on the altar it was the life of the Lamb of God who came to take away the sins of the world and went to the cross and when he bled he bled for you and for me amen you were in him when he went to the Cross you were a part of him when you when he went to the cross and everything all the Judgment all your sin everything that you lived as a sinner was nailed to the cross on that day on Calvary and you are now identifying with that and identifying you with the word for this hour because he's doing it now he's doing it again amen praise God and you're identifying with that so you're your offering that's made by fire is the offering of the Holy Ghost in your life when you come into the house of the Lord and you worship him that's the offering that has that has brought us into a revelation and a fellowship and a relationship with Christ himself amen praise God hallelujah next scripture I want you to notice in Leviticus it was the 10th day the 7th month Revelations 107 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets God does absolutely nothing without first revealing it unto his servants the prophets you show me one time where he ever did anything without a prophet when it came to Israel and God had to do it again in the 20th century amen because he made a promise according to his word in Malachi 4:5 behold I send unto you personal Elijah the prophet and he's going to open your understanding he's going to give you a revelation on what you need to do in order to receive the Holy Ghost so that when the Holy Ghost comes on you it's going to turn you back to the word it's going to it's going to awaken you to the true Living God the the the the word of God for your day amen so God had to send us a prophet to reveal the mystery all the mystery listen we can't get into into everything but I I'm just going to tell you this all these feasts everything that we read from Genesis to Revelation it's all about One mystery yes one mystery God himself expressing himself in the story of redemption amen this is the plan for this day and for this hour and we're not to be confused and get distracted by all the teachings that you see on on on the on YouTube about oh the anunaki all the different you know civilizations that existed before you know this civilization 6,000 years people say to you oh you telling me the Bible's only 6,000 years old yeah the Bible is 6,000 years old but God is eternal the Bible in Genesis said in the beginning Elohim the self-existent one period period it didn't say how old he was it didn't say how he started it didn't say anything it said self-existence so listen civilizations sure there was other civilizations there's proof right on the earth that there was other civilizations yes sir but that's got nothing to do with us today see people get distracted they want to they want to say oh no no we we're you're only going back 6,000 years and you're a preacher I can take you back 200 million years and tell you that there was dinosaurs I say okay what good is a dinosaur going to do me now what good is it to know that there was cavemen here a 100 million years ago you tell me what good that is when I see the prophecy that's going on out there according to this Bible and if you take the time to read the Old Testament and read about Israel in the Old Testament you will find things in there that you will your your eyes are going to open but only if God opens your understanding to believe what you're reading cuz a lot of people think it's just stories oh David and Goliath yeah it's a great story it's more than a story to a son or a daughter of God it shows that God was with that that that individual and and it it tells me that when I'm in my weakest moments at times when I'm facing some great Giants in my life when I got to overcome some serious situations whether it's sickness or whether it's heartache or whatever it is that I've got a God that can put faith into my hand and I can take that faith f AI t h 5 stones and I can believe in Jesus j s s who is my savior and I can apply that word into that situation and and that power's got to be broken I can be I can conquer what it is that I'm facing amen and nobody can tell me what's going on in the Middle East is just a story it's a reality what's going on out there all the players all the individuals from from from Israel and their and their families to the to the Iranians to the to the uh uh he all the the the proxies of of of the the Iran government that that that have they up all these proxies Hamas and Hezbollah that are trying and have only one goal and that is to annihilate the nation of Israel well that's that's all in the scripture we're going to see some of that scripture as we go through this little series here that how it is that that it's a reality that's taking place and we are witnessing it and that's why it's important for you and everybody else that that that listens in when we preach preach about Jesus Christ and prophetic events for you to study the word of God it's the story the Bible is the is the playbook for what is going on what has happened and what is going to happen amen and you have a part of it because you're here on Earth you're in a human vessel and as long as you're here in a human vessel you're going to have to deal with these prophecies just like those that are dealing with it in Israel dealing it in Lebanon dealing with it in Gaza those bombs are real bombs they're blowing up real people families are being destroyed families are being murdered families are being listen these things are actually happening Saints and so people they want to get all oh but I listen you know these civilizations that took place before and you know these things that happened before you know uh you know we're not we're we're not going to be affected by what's going on on the earth you're being affected whether you like it or not those plagues that the Bible talks about those wars and rumors of wars those catastrophic natural disasters that we deal with every single year and they get worse and worse they're real they're happening don't tell me they're not happening so you need to search yourself you need to reboot your thinking and get away from all this this other thinking about past civilizations and everything else and try to become an historian and try to make yourself more knowledgeable than the word of God you need to humble yourself to God's word and what he says is going to happen amen and so we know that there's a mystery that's going on in this day and in this hour and that mystery is the story of Jesus Christ the Savior the Redeemer the one that started this plan and is going to end this plan and we're going to go into one thou because the Bible's got a 7,000 year game plan Saints and we are on the verge of the last thousand years of what's going to what the game plan says for this Earth then there's going to be a new heavens and a new Earth and then maybe a new plan whatever it is you got to do something so you might as well recognize that if you're a part of that Eternal plan then your life doesn't end when you die here on this Earth in this flesh you go to realize and recognize that you go beyond this life you're Eternal you'll have no end because you are a son or a daughter of God because a son or a daughter is is a is a part of God it's an expression of God and that if you're an expression of God you have no Beginning No End you have experience here on this Earth in this human vessel but that is only an experience here on Earth you need to find out what the plan is for you to get out of this trap of this Earth because the plan it doesn't it doesn't get better here on Earth it's going to get worse verse first hallelujah praise God and so the next scripture pertains to now we know that Revelations 10 1-7 pertains to William Branham the messenger that would come and restore Malachi 4:5 to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers you need to research and and and find out about the ministry of William Branham and just like when you type Jesus Christ into this into Google you're going to find out that there's Satan worshippers too and they're against Christ they're against everything that he did he didn't die for your sins according to them he he's not the Savior according to them and so you're going to read things when you research about Martin Luther John Wesley Pentecostal experience and William Bram Billy Graham Oral Roberts these these were all men of God that had Ministries over the over the in in the 19th 20th century amen that fulfilled portions of Prophecy according to the word of God and so you need to realize that yes you're going to see you know the first day somebody says oh I looked up William brandham and they call him a cult I can show you a hundred Cults what is that God to do with your ability to search the scriptures yourself what about you searching the scriptures and finding out for yourself because that's where you're going to come to realize who he really is and if you and if and if it's not given unto you to know it guess what you'll never see it Saints we got to realize Jesus said unto you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom but look he says because the disciples asked why are they leaving because unto them it has not been given it's not given to the serpent seed it's not given to the children of Disobedience it's not given to the enemy's children because they're the enemy we need to realize that listen if oh no there isn't a devil there is a devil okay you tell me what's causing those people out there to murder those children and rape those women and do all of those things that's not God that's not God that's that's of the enemy there's a devil that's anointing those people to do those things amen this is the plan of Good and Evil Saints it's all part of the game plan we need to come into the game plan recognize where we fit in what our position is and what it is that God wants us to do amen amen praise God and in Revelations 108-111 it says and The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and we know that it was Christ that stepped out of the throne it's Christ that stepped out in in in in Revelations 10:1 when he put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and said time shall be no more that was Christ coming down in our generation Amen to fulfill scripture praise God but now he held a book and that book contained the names of everyone that would come to the revelation of the true body of Jesus Christ those that were in the body of Christ those that were with him before the foundations of the world this plan goes before the foundations of the world Amen that's what you need to recognize because God is eternal and he's got your name written in that book so that you will come to the realization of who you really are so he tells him now he says now take that book so he says and said unto me give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey oh the word of God is so sweet but when you got to live it that's a different ball game altogether and when you've got to prophesy it and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings who's he talking about there I'm going to tell you that this is the ministry of the church for this hour this is the ministry that we've been given in this hour that that that the word that God has given to us that we've come to realize and recognize by the opening of the scriptures and by you having a true Born Again experience in the Lord you become an instrument of the Holy Ghost you become a voice in this last generation you become one that's a carrier that's going to let the people know remember we have a purpose remember this is the jub this is our time of Jubilee there's a lot of people that are still they're they're they're still locked in under their slave master under their traditional denominational teaching Master they're still under that slave master and yet they remain there because they have not heard the word of truth but we are the carriers of the word of Truth amen we are the ones that are now in this hour the carriers of the prophecy the ones that will speak the word of God and and see lives being transformed by the word of God Amen we're the ones that God has given the the the the responsibility to let the people know how it is that they are going to come in because the Gentile dispensation it's coming to an end it's ending Saints we've got to we've got to do our part we've got to share the word of God we've got to let the people know what the truth is amen praise God listen to The Prophet here in the Feast of trumpets he says the Holy Spirit has been bound in these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but it's to be loosed in the evening time the evening time is the end time Saints this is what D Daniel was talking about when he said that these things were sealed up until the end but now we're in the end the wise shall know what is it that we know pay ATT attention he says the Holy Spirit he says this to be loosed in the evening time by the end time message so you mean there's a there's a message in this day that's going to set so-called Christians free to actually be birthed by the word of God you mean they need to be born again a lot of them say I was born again well what were you born to you need to check what it is that you were birthed to were you born again according to God's word or did you just answer an altar call go there as a as a sinner uh you know crying and and leaving and going right back into sin or did you actually receive the Holy Ghost there's a difference so there's a there's an end time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time how many believes that Christ is here a lot of people are still putting them off oh he's going to come in the clouds and we're going to see him and we're going to go and meet him in the air guess what he's already here 1963 he came down in a cloud on Sunset mountain and and his head was coming to join the body you need to do your research to find that he's already come and you didn't know it he's going to take one out of the bed he's going to leave the other this has been happening since 1963 to call out the the church the portion of the body of Christ that was ordained for this hour amen there's been a church through every age Luther Wesley let's read on here he says here Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it now there was three stages of it as I said the martyr's age for it and then the stage of the reformers we know the Dark Ages was all the martyrs that they died they had to give their lives for the for the gospel you know that was the martyrs age and then come the Reformation which was you know the calling out time reformers and now the calling out when finished at Leo Dean age according to Revelation 10 which we just read the mystery of all the Bible would be known to the bride is that right amen Revelation 10 listen close now uh-huh bride called out by the word not called out by a tradition not oh come and join my church you know we believe that the Lord is coming and then they'll tell you oh you can be baptized in the name of the father father and the son and of the Holy Spirit and we believe in a trinity Jesus Christ is the Son of God and then there's God the father and then there's the Holy Spirit these are all three separate entities but yet they are in one they agree you see they're deceived and they don't know it how can you worship that whom you do not know amen is that right so goes on he says he says the bride called out by the word Christ himself calling out the bride making plain Hebrews 13:8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever does the same is the same he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Luke 22 Luke 17:30 also Malachi 4 you see he's making it plain to the people the hour that they're living in that they need to recognize amen all these scriptures that's promised this is to be between the sixth and the seventh seal and the sixth and the seventh trumpet Pentecostal Feast finishes at the period of the seventh trumpet for the next is the coming of the seventh seal now brother brandham was at that time where he where where he came into the opening of The Seven Seals we've recognized that the seals are now open the trumpets to to Israel is the Seven Seals the seven trumpets to Israel is the seven Trumpets the Seven Seals to the bride the Seven Seals have been opened in this day and in this hour people are going into churches and they read the book of Revelation and they'll go right over the Seven Seals and when you ask them about it they'll say we don't understand it we don't know what it means well then you need to listen to to God's Vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5 the the the the messenger that came into the 20th century that was God's Prophet to come and unveil the word and open the word so that you could understand but it's still going to require for you to come into your own experience with God you're going to have to come God's provided way first listen I tell everybody right from the beginning when I came into this message I did not come in because God showed me William brandham was the prophet of the hour no sir God showed me that I was a Son of God and that he was God that he was my deliverer that he he was my healer that he was a living God that he was an everpresent God that that that I could look and and feel and touch amen because my life had been transformed then my understanding and the revelation brought me to a place where I want to get baptized I want the Holy Ghost I realize I need the holy ghost that experience can never be bypass Saints that's why when you're when you're testifying to somebody you want to share a track you want to tell them about the prophet but before all of that you need to lead them to Christ they need to know him in the power of his resurrection they need to know that he's a reality that can heal them that can that can set them free from the bondage of melt mental illness that can liberate them from from broken relationships that can set them free from the from the anxieties of this world that he's a real true Living God and once they've had that experience they're going to listen they're going to listen they're going to say Oh Glory to God what else and now he starts to unveil all of these mysteries in the word of God to let you know that hey you are my bride you're my wife you're the one that I've chosen you're I've given you the understanding you're one of those sheep that hear my voice and it excites you it allows you to transform your own personal life now in a way like you've never been able to before all of a sudden you're experiencing a peace that that that surpasses all human understanding Hallelujah all of a sudden you're getting every answer from the scripture that that you that that you never you never had any idea that there's so much truth and here you are you're listening to to a man that has only a grade five education by the name of William branam we listen to his tapes we don't worship the man we don't follow the man we don't have an organization that that worships William Branham we are an organization that worships Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry amen we've recognized William brandom as a prophet to the 20th century just like the children of Israel recognize that Moses was their deliverer amen just like they recognize Ezekiel they recognize Isaiah they recognized Jeremiah they recognized all the prophets that when they came and said thus sayeth the Lord this is what the Lord says about my people this is what the Lord wants from my people when when when God does something like that it changes everything but you need to come to realize that that's what makes him the same yesterday today and forever and if you're going to have transformation in your life you're going to need to come to know him not that God just sent a prophet there's a lot of people now they're worshiping William brandom like he's God they'll tell you oh no no no no you don't need to have a pastor you can just listen to the tapes you can just you don't need to be you know paying your tithes unto a unto a man you can you can you know you can pay it to an organization you can you know they won't say it directly but but they're just they they're telling you no no no just just what the prophet said only say what the prophet said well what about the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry that wants to supernaturally deliver and has delivered me he delivered me in 1994 not back in the days of Jesus not when William br was here in 1961 I was born in 1961 I didn't get delivered under that I got delivered by the word of God by the supernatural Revelation that Jesus Christ is a reality in my life and until that happens in your life you're bound by denomination you're bound by teachings of man you're looking to your doctrines you're not looking to the word which is Christ in the power of his resurrection amen now listen here he says now the the the Pentecostal Feast finishes at the period of the seventh trumpet for the next is the coming of the seventh seal for the next is the mystery of the coming of Christ we know that that has happened that's why we're talking about it we're reminding you that he's here he's present he's in the midst of a of a gentile church right now now fulfilling his own word interpreting his own word and he's trying to tell you it's time for Jubilee those that are locked up in those in those task maskers that that got you all bound up under tradition and under the teachings of man guess what there's a trumpet of Jubilee that's going to sound amen praise God hallelujah let's go to the next scripture then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land brother Bill come to the front naturally you're hearing the sound of a chofar which he will now blow eight times but supernaturally the word of God is going out from right here to call Sons and Daughters to the attention of the word for this day and for this hour to reject the word of God is to stay under the Taskmaster it was after 50 years every 50 years the children of Israel would sound the chauffeur and they call it the trumpet of Jubilee where the children of Israel if they were in slavery or if they were sold to a Taskmaster that they had to be released they were free they could be set free to leave those taskmasters and never look back to them again but if they chose to reject and to stay under those task Masters under those denominational thinking under those teachings where you only got to go this way and and you've got to you've you only got to listen to this and you you can you can only go to this church or you no you've got to come to him yourself personal you must receive the word personally you must search the scriptures yourself let the chofar be sounded [Music] [Music] sh [Music] to receive his word is to receive the light of the hour am think of it it's the end time folks Hallelujah the great day of the Lord is at hand gather yourselves together Feast of the Messiah they'll reject him and they'll find out that there is their Messiah the Bible said them striking things like this would take place Amen in Revelations 11 call their ministry will be the ministry of Moses and Elias calling to Israel out of the TR Jewish Traditions just as the seventh Angel's message called The Bride out of the Pentecostal tradition remember Moses and Elijah is to call Israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the Real Living Sacrifice to the word and the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal traditions and World Traditions to the genuine atonement of the word Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us science has proved it by pictures the church knows it the world around we firmly know it for he's never told us one thing in thus sayeth the Lord but what's been the truth did he not say down there on the river as John the Baptist was sent forth uh so this message William branham's message was to forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ amen the second coming of Jesus Christ took place for the church under the opening of The Seven Seals when that seventh seal was released and opened there was no no interpretation given but yet the scripture says in Revelations uh 8 that there was a half hour of Silence in heaven which means that somehow he left the throne he was coming down to meet with his church he was now coming down to call his elected into the body of Jesus Christ amen and we know that this has already happened we are the living testimony of that scripture being fulfilled here in 2024 we have received our opening of the seventh seal and Jesus Christ has come to dwell to possess to anoint a five-fold Ministry to speak to his children to to to so that you will know that greater is he that is in you because the at is Christ it's the holy ghost coming into your life so that you can overcome the the the the challenges that you're dealing with the circumstances that you're overcoming in this life without that true experience you cannot overcome the true Overcomer has come to realize that it's he that is in you he's the Overcomer he's the one that's going to deliver he's the one that's going to open your understanding give you an understanding he's the one that's to translate you if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it's going to Quicken this body it's going to it's going to it's going to give it an interdimensional change in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye that it can only be possible because you have recognized that Christ has come we're not looking for his coming he's already already come he's W in us he's with us what we're waiting for is for that call to go to the meeting in the air but he's already here and he's called The Jubilee and those that have heard the sound of the trumpet sound of the Jubilee have gathered around the carcass where the Eagles gather around the Living Word not some man-made teaching not some oh you got to say 10 hell marries you got to say 20 what good is that going to do you when you're just repeating the scripture says don't come to me with your repetitive prayers but come to me with a sincere heart come to me with your broken heart from your come to me in your weakness when come to me in your humility and allow me to come and possess you and take control of you and love you and and and keep you through the enemy's fight Hallelujah glory to God amen he says now he says those seven sabbaths is the seven Church ages the church we've come through the church ages we realized the church age that that that we came through which was to Leo deia this is the Leo to see an age that we're now in and we can see its condition all around us but not you who have been called into the mystical Body of Christ by the opening of the word to you personal where you have now applied the token in your life you've you've allowed the blood of Christ to come upon your life through obedience to the word of God not not you have to do it no listen when go when you get sincere enough before God God will come to you God will heal you God will will will woo you God will will will love you and and cherish your you and love you and and when when he when when you come into that kind of an experience then then you you want more of him that's why I couldn't get enough I said I need the Holy Ghost I need more I need more not realizing that the Holy Ghost is what led me to get more is because there was representation now this is the other aspect that we need to understand there's people in those denominations in those Traditions that have an attribute of God in them Hall this is what must be recognized you can't come unless he calls you to come but what you can do is surrender to the call some people just they just want to stay stubborn they don't want to allow God to come into their entire life so that they so that he can Purge out all the unbelief we've got to say yes Lord remember he gave us free moral agency he's not going to force himself a man that forces himself onto a woman that woman will immediately reject him immediately reject him but that man that that that shows respect and love and and and and and and honors the individual shows them how important they are shows them that that's not the life that the life that they lived uh I'm making a way for you to to be completely free from that life it's like the story of you know of of uh the princess you know the the one that that gets the slipper you know she's living a life and she's she's the one that's you know been you know in poverty and everything else and then he's you know Prince Charming he comes along and he shows that no you're the chosen one he saw a character he saw humility he saw something there that that that attracted him you want the Holy Ghost more in your life you need to you need to humble yourself you need to you need to let go of all the pride and all the things that you want to hold on to I know this I know that you know nothing let the Holy Spirit show you wisdom let him show you humility let him show you what it is you know to to to love somebody that's that's lost to love somebody that's that's that's Bound by certain you know sin and unbelief show the love of God projecting the love of God into that situation I've always said you know when when when there there's when there's a fight and there's and there's an argument between two people the stronger one will be the Victor if he shows that he's the weakest in his attitude in in his he he he'll be the vi the the stronger one will be the one that says no more doesn't have to have the last word the stronger one will be the one that humbles and allows the Holy Spirit to be the absolute in the situation my my boss fired me I gave him a piece of my mind I told him you this do and gave him a few words and made sure he knew exactly what what what I was thinking that just goes to show that you were the weaker one and God's looking at the character he's not looking at anything else he's looking at the character but how do you know if God you see if you had the right character and and and they let you go and you're and you're you're you're just looking to him you're you're looking to him you're looking to his plan his purpose his will how do you know that he didn't let you go because he's got another job that all of a sudden you're making $10 more an hour because he looks at your character he's still Jehovah Gyra he's going to provide your needs and if he's not providing in your needs it's because there's something in you something in you that is that is not believing God in that area I'm not giving a tenth of my earnings I work hard for that I'm not going to give it to look at the pastor he's driving a fancy car he's got this he's got that he doesn't need my money you got no revelation and you're missing the biggest aspect of your financial blessing with God because of Pride because of your interpretation on the word of God don't put your own interpretation on the word let God be the one who interprets your life and your life will interpret itself you won't need to tell anybody anybody that's going around saying oh look what God did for me God's doing this God's doing that God's doing this God's doing that give it a six months and you're going to see he's not going to be saying anything he's going to be saying oh God what did you do to me because Pride always comes before a fall and that's why when when when we really come to understand this call you didn't you re recognize that Jesus Christ has come in this hour is because God has opened your understanding amen and it doesn't make you any better than anybody else out there no we're God's elected people because he said so not because we chose it no not because we did something to deserve it remember let's go on here let's read on praise God listen brother brandom here 1963 says and we know that no not one turt not one jot shall in no wise ever pass from your word you said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not and you said except a man be born again of water and spirit he will in no wise enter into the kingdom I pray father that you'll speak to the hearts tonight just as this time let men and women think seriously just at this moment knowing that knowing that we're living in the closing hours Israel is in her Homeland the great calendar of God she is returning back looking where is the Messiah we know that when Joseph made himself known to his brothers that he dis dismissed the Gentiles from the courts his wife and children were in the palace there must be a taking away of the Gentile that Israel might be made known then there will come a time of a wailing and screaming and crying where did you get those scars he said in the hands of my friends from my friends I have got these scars in my hand and the house where he where he was really should be accepted where he should have been accepted when he makes himself known to Israel again God while the Gentiles has a chance may they repent quickly and come to you amen we're going to continue next week let the musicians come and we're going to be looking at how we can't be here when the Messiah makes himself known to Israel we are living in the closing moments of time look at Israel look at the battles look at the enemies that are surrounding them look at the Nations that are coming against them look at how this is all happening and it's happening right here and now in our day Saints look at how close we are to where God is going to remove this Gentile bride there's going to be a last sermon preached there's going to be a last sermon preached where anybody is going to have that opportunity to recognize the word and to come into Christ when the Gentile dispensation is going to be finished what hour are we living in how close are we to that moment in time let's examine ourselves the chofar has been blown today the purpose of the blowing of the chofar was also to draw the attention of the people to take a look at their experience to look at the chains that are circumstances around their lives to examine and see if they're under bondage of some traditional denominational teaching of man doctrines of man or are they actually walking with Christ himself the choice has to be made those that rejected the Jubilee they were given an all to bore a hole in their ear and when they said no I will stay with my Taskmaster they could never be set free again this is the time of Jubilee this is the time where we can be set free this is the time where if you are uncertain of God now is your opportunity to be certain of God let us pray father we thank you this morning Lord for speaking to our hearts and giving us just a simple Clarity father of how important it is for us to recognize the hour the time the season the closing of the Gentile dispensation it's Upon Us Lord oh God help us Lord to surrender ourselves to let go of our pride and let go of the things that are that are traditionally holding us sometimes it's because oh my family's going to be upset if I if I leave the church or or or or my family's going to be upset no how do you know if you're not going to be the one that's going to set them free by coming out of the bondage of slavery and saying hey I'm going free I'm coming to Christ Lord won't you speak to the hearts of your people and bring them in Lord
