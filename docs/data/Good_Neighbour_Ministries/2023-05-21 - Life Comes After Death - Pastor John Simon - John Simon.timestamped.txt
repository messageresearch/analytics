[41:51] [Music]
[42:09] you I'm happy to be here this morning
[42:11] thank you all very much praise God
[42:14] forevermore I'm happy to see some of my
[42:17] older Believers coming now with the
[42:21] warmth of the season coming into the
[42:24] house of God and of course I always
[42:26] think about them like I just mentioned
[42:31] to you one of those Believers that was
[42:35] with me originally from the very
[42:38] beginning
[42:40] um left and went to be with the Lord as
[42:44] you know a lot of smaller groups have
[42:46] come off from this church right uh it
[42:50] would have been a huge uh church but
[42:54] always it gets to that point where God
[42:58] takes off a group takes off a group I
[43:01] didn't understand that that person as a
[43:03] pastor you want to know why why are
[43:05] these people just go like that then you
[43:09] realize God is actually multiplying his
[43:12] word
[43:13] and that's what he's doing and he's got
[43:15] to use somebody to do that so using me
[43:18] as a planter grower distributor and all
[43:21] that I just come to understand that as I
[43:24] grew because as you preach you grow also
[43:27] praise the Lord so I thank God for you
[43:31] who are here still holding to God's
[43:33] unchanging hands
[43:35] amen praise the Lord
[43:38] um I will be speaking today and
[43:42] um I normally will just give my topic to
[43:44] brother Corey or whoever is out there
[43:47] and they'll take it to the back and I
[43:48] said I don't know what I'm going to
[43:51] actually call this
[43:53] uh and I don't know why uh why I don't
[43:59] have a like a topic right now but it's
[44:03] this it's the meat or the subject that
[44:06] you will have to pay attention to
[44:08] and I'm praying that somehow God will
[44:12] open his word to us and bless us as we
[44:16] walk together amen praise the Lord and
[44:20] why should I always be
[44:22] like a little ahead of the crowd not
[44:26] sitting back and waiting for somebody to
[44:28] say something to hear it and then go say
[44:30] it but always seem to break on these
[44:34] things for the glory of God anyway the
[44:36] Lord bless you welcome we're happy to
[44:39] have you in the house of the Lord here
[44:40] today God richly bless you everyone
[44:43] that's represented in the house of God
[44:46] or text that will be Matthew chapter 24.
[44:52] reading from verse 45 to 51 of course we
[44:58] could read a lot more but my emphasis is
[45:02] on the message that we have to bring
[45:05] here today and that is why but you can
[45:10] read that when you get home those
[45:12] scriptures uh when you do get home
[45:15] amen
[45:17] now Matthew 24
[45:20] verses 45
[45:23] to 51.
[45:25] praise the Lord
[45:30] who then
[45:32] is a faithful and wise servant
[45:37] whom his Lord had made ruler over his
[45:42] household
[45:43] to give them meat in his Jew season
[45:48] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[45:52] when he cometh shall find so doing
[45:56] verily I say unto you that he shall make
[46:00] him
[46:01] ruler over all his Goods
[46:06] but and if that evil servant shall say
[46:11] in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming
[46:16] and shall begin to Smite his fellow
[46:18] servants and eat and drink with the
[46:20] drunken the Lord of that servant
[46:24] shall come in a day when he look at not
[46:28] for him
[46:29] and in an hour that he is not aware of
[46:34] and shall cut him asunder and appoint
[46:38] him his portion with the Hypocrites
[46:42] there shall be weeping
[46:45] and gnashing of teeth
[46:49] let us have a word of Prayer
[46:53] our righteous and gracious Heavenly
[46:56] Father
[46:57] here we come as helpless human beings
[47:00] Limited in thought word and action but
[47:04] you the great Eternal unlimited one
[47:08] being here with us today we invite your
[47:12] Royal Divine Supernatural presence Among
[47:16] Us
[47:16] we ask you father as we pay uh respects
[47:21] to Thy word that you will draw near and
[47:25] that the great holy spirit of God will
[47:29] make the word live again that you will
[47:32] anoint your servant you will anoint the
[47:35] hearers of the word as well as the
[47:39] speaker of the word father
[47:42] we surrender ourselves for worship and
[47:45] for thy Glory and Honor we ask this in
[47:49] the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord amen
[47:53] and amen God bless you richly please be
[47:55] seated
[48:01] okay
[48:06] really
[48:08] I paused there because really
[48:11] thinking about
[48:13] what this is going to be about is the
[48:17] the time of the message what we call the
[48:22] message of the hour what season are we
[48:26] in what is really going on at this time
[48:31] and I like to start by going and
[48:34] reminding you of Moses you remember
[48:37] Moses had a message from God to bring to
[48:41] the children of Israel
[48:43] now uh to you who are aware of the types
[48:48] and the Shadows you understand that as I
[48:51] was with Moses so will I be with thee
[48:55] now uh we know that the prophet of
[48:58] Malachi 4 5 brother William Marion
[49:02] Branham lightened himself in that
[49:05] position bringing the people of God out
[49:08] of denominational slavery enslavement
[49:12] into uh the Wilderness of the of this
[49:17] world that church world that we are in
[49:19] but leading us right onto the promised
[49:23] land of the fullness amen but there was
[49:28] a gap
[49:29] there was Israel there was a Wilderness
[49:32] Journey then there was a Promised Land
[49:36] the problem was in the wilderness
[49:38] Journey
[49:40] because the people's expectations is
[49:44] that they were going into the promised
[49:49] land shortly
[49:50] after a brief while there would be in
[49:53] the Promised Land
[49:55] however they found themselves
[49:58] encountering trials
[50:01] they found themselves uh encountering
[50:05] Heat
[50:06] they found themselves encountering
[50:09] poisonous snakes
[50:12] they found a problem of the bitter
[50:15] Waters of Mara
[50:17] the heat of the desert of sin
[50:21] all around them they had trials and
[50:25] problems
[50:26] no water in the desert
[50:30] but you see whenever they had a problem
[50:33] God solved it for them
[50:37] when they had no shade he allowed the
[50:41] cloud to come above them A Cloud by day
[50:45] and what was a shadow over them
[50:49] when they were thirsty
[50:51] Moses he said strike that rock out of
[50:55] the rock flown waters for them to drink
[50:59] and when there were sick he says for
[51:04] take a serpent put it on a pole raise it
[51:07] up and if they look there they will look
[51:10] and live
[51:12] oh praise God I want to thank God today
[51:16] we are in that same position spiritually
[51:21] that the great Holy Spirit of the Living
[51:23] God overshadows us with the wings of the
[51:27] almighty Jehovah God
[51:30] amen when we are thirsty he brings water
[51:34] for us spiritually refreshment to
[51:37] refresh our souls when we are hungry he
[51:41] feeds us with the bread of life
[51:44] amen they had Manna coming from above we
[51:49] have spiritual manner or Revelation
[51:52] coming to us
[51:55] but nevertheless in the midst of all
[51:58] this the Bible said the people began to
[52:02] murmur
[52:04] they saw the pillar of Fire
[52:07] they saw the miracle of water coming out
[52:10] of the Rock
[52:12] beginning from they saw pharaoh and all
[52:16] the devils and demons that held them
[52:19] under control before habits they could
[52:23] never get rid of situations they could
[52:26] not defeat they saw it their cigarettes
[52:29] their drugs there uh whatever their side
[52:33] all defeated and drowned in the red
[52:37] sleet see of the blood of Christ
[52:40] there were delivered and they recognized
[52:43] that they were delivered and then Into
[52:46] the Wilderness trials after trial not
[52:51] realizing God was testing and trying to
[52:55] prove who amongst them is his own word
[53:00] testing and trying to know who are his
[53:04] elect
[53:05] that will go over into the Promised Land
[53:10] and so we find out that we're having
[53:14] trials and there were murmuring
[53:17] complaining and crying
[53:19] but they never realized Moses and Joshua
[53:23] uh Joshua and Caleb sorry just one Caleb
[53:28] were having the identical trials
[53:31] but there were not murmuring and
[53:33] complaining
[53:35] they were just looking forward to get to
[53:39] that promised Landing what they were
[53:41] gonna do when they get over there they
[53:44] were just looking ahead of what they
[53:47] could accomplish for the glory of God
[53:51] but they were getting the same trials
[53:53] what is the difference 100 trials one
[53:57] complaint one warmer one cried one one
[54:01] to subvert the kingdom of a troll the
[54:04] leadership whoever else and the other
[54:07] was there supporting the leader and the
[54:10] others was there looking forward to the
[54:13] victory that was supposed to come and
[54:16] shouting Glory Hallelujah
[54:19] oh my one cringing and oh look this
[54:24] desert the heat of this desert oh my so
[54:27] hot I'm perspiring I'm sweating them
[54:29] tired I'm weary the other one was saying
[54:32] oh Shine On Me Lord shine on me let the
[54:37] light of the lighthouse shine on me
[54:39] praise God they wanted the light of God
[54:42] to shine upon them the sunshine light of
[54:46] God shining on the seed word planted
[54:49] within their hearts would then spring to
[54:51] life
[54:53] amen oh my no matter where God's life is
[54:58] hidden whoever it is hidden in
[55:01] the most unlikely places it will be
[55:04] hidden in hidden in a prostitute by the
[55:07] well
[55:08] yet it was hidden in a ruler of Israel
[55:11] named Nicodemus
[55:13] that seed of God germ of God lives in
[55:18] whoever ascends it and he appoints it to
[55:22] whoever wherever he wants it to be from
[55:26] the day before they were born as a
[55:28] matter of fact he said before you were
[55:30] born I already knew you I ordained you
[55:33] to be the Way You Are
[55:35] yeah yeah people may see your strange or
[55:39] different you're you're funny what God
[55:42] made you that way God places life within
[55:46] you that you will you will act like him
[55:48] when you act like him you are strange to
[55:51] the people and they don't recognize that
[55:54] it's not just the man the woman is God
[55:56] working through them amen hallelujah yes
[56:01] sir praise God Amen yes sir so Joshua
[56:05] Caleb could already see themselves
[56:07] across the Jordan and into the promised
[56:09] land while the others can only see
[56:12] themselves they're still in the desert
[56:15] and you are where you are spiritually
[56:18] speaking oh my praise God hallelujah do
[56:23] you know that some people had so much
[56:25] Faith some of that young generation had
[56:27] so much faith that they actually walk
[56:29] with seeds to plant when they get to
[56:32] that Promised Land
[56:33] praise God I hope some of you are
[56:36] walking with your seeds amen I hope you
[56:38] have seeds of life truth Revelation that
[56:41] you can share with others that's in your
[56:44] hearts and in your mouths that you can
[56:46] you can go and hand it to others that
[56:50] they also may live amen so we are to
[56:54] plant seeds of Faith nevertheless
[56:58] the Bible tells us that the coming of
[57:02] the Lord will not take place until there
[57:06] be a falling away first
[57:09] there must be a falling away in in a
[57:13] Paul speaks of it when he said Jesus
[57:16] actually said it he said don't you
[57:19] understand
[57:20] many of your fathers died in the
[57:23] wilderness
[57:24] they never saw the promised land Paul
[57:27] said yet they were baptized under the
[57:31] same cloud
[57:33] there were there passed through the
[57:36] Wilderness that Joshua Caleb and all the
[57:39] others came true they passed through it
[57:42] amen they came right out but yet they
[57:46] died
[57:47] they were Jews they were originals but
[57:51] there were not allowed to cross over
[57:54] because they were not God's germ God's
[57:59] seed his his thought his attribute for
[58:03] that day or for that time
[58:06] and so they were not allowed to cross
[58:09] over my they died right there in the
[58:14] wilderness o praise God I want you to
[58:18] know it's time to cross from this
[58:22] message into the promised land of the
[58:25] unwritten word
[58:27] and that is where the problem comes
[58:30] right there first of all they do not
[58:33] some don't believe there is any
[58:35] Unwritten word Unwritten scripture and
[58:39] nevertheless God says Ah John what you
[58:43] see that part don't write
[58:45] Unwritten scripture it's right there he
[58:48] says what you see here don't write
[58:51] because he didn't want John to say it
[58:54] write it for the devil catch it
[58:57] but he wanted to be able to communicate
[58:59] it directly to his his elected seed by
[59:04] the facility and faculty of Revelation
[59:08] that's why he said to Peter he said
[59:11] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[59:14] unto you but my Father in Heaven has
[59:17] revealed this under you and Upon This
[59:20] Rock of Revelation I'll build my church
[59:24] and the Gates of Hell will try to
[59:27] Prevail against it will fight them and
[59:29] by you know reproach them and Blacken
[59:33] their names and everything else but the
[59:35] Gates of Hell shall not prevail
[59:39] they shall not Prevail they're gonna
[59:41] fight it's going to fight it but it will
[59:43] not Prevail against it because of the
[59:46] rock of Revelation
[59:48] why do you think the prophet said this
[59:51] third Paul
[59:52] cannot be actually copied
[59:56] they can't impersonate it why because he
[1:00:00] actually didn't allow it to write as
[1:00:03] letters that the human mind thought I
[1:00:07] can conceive of and catch it pick it up
[1:00:10] and then the wisdom of Satan and the
[1:00:12] wisdom of man can analyze their bad
[1:00:14] structure and every everything else like
[1:00:17] that but he left it in the form of pure
[1:00:20] revelation
[1:00:22] pure rip Unwritten word
[1:00:25] that only the believer has the faculty
[1:00:30] to be able to pick it up
[1:00:32] the word is broadcasting in a way of
[1:00:35] length that there don't have the heirs
[1:00:40] to able to pick it up
[1:00:42] and that is why look I go back to my old
[1:00:45] dog whistle thing which you all know
[1:00:48] that dogs have such a cute hearing that
[1:00:53] sometimes there is a whistle that the
[1:00:56] the trainers can use and when they use
[1:00:59] it you don't hear anything coming out of
[1:01:01] it
[1:01:02] but the dogs are hearing that whistle at
[1:01:05] the high pitch
[1:01:06] and they can obey it because they're
[1:01:09] hearing it my praise God it's the same
[1:01:12] manner in the same way people are right
[1:01:14] around you all sitting in church hearing
[1:01:17] the same word hearing the same Bible
[1:01:19] being preached but Revelation is coming
[1:01:22] out of that written word and they elect
[1:01:26] our hearing it on a higher wavelength
[1:01:29] Hallelujah they're picking it up they're
[1:01:31] recognizing what God is saying for this
[1:01:35] hour
[1:01:36] not for any other day but for this day
[1:01:40] this hour this time praise God
[1:01:43] hallelujah people try to convince you
[1:01:46] they're hearing but they're hearing
[1:01:47] Luther right up to Pentecost what I am
[1:01:50] trying to tell you is it's not even
[1:01:52] recognizing and hearing Pentecost is to
[1:01:54] recognize your day and the message for
[1:01:57] your day and what God is saying in this
[1:02:00] hour and in this time by the word of the
[1:02:03] holy spirit amen praise God Amen and we
[1:02:07] find our friends
[1:02:09] that Joshua and Caleb enter the promised
[1:02:13] land to overcome the enemies amen
[1:02:16] because when they cross the promised
[1:02:18] land of course they have to overcome
[1:02:21] then they have to occupy
[1:02:23] and then they have to possess
[1:02:26] see you first got to overcome the land
[1:02:30] before you can occupy it take it over
[1:02:33] and then when you take it over you gotta
[1:02:36] plant your steaks I this is my land this
[1:02:41] land is my land Heaven is my home amen
[1:02:46] we're going home aren't we I said we're
[1:02:48] going home
[1:02:50] oh
[1:02:52] going home we are going home we ain't
[1:02:58] got long to stay here for I've got a
[1:03:03] glimpse of that
[1:03:05] Heavenly land praise God I'm going home
[1:03:12] do you believe that
[1:03:13] we're going home
[1:03:15] I said we're going home we caught a
[1:03:19] glimpse of that Heavenly land and we're
[1:03:21] going home trials and troubles are like
[1:03:25] water passing off from a duck's back
[1:03:27] because we're headed to glory amen
[1:03:30] we're headed to Glory
[1:03:32] but while we are talking like this
[1:03:36] I want you to recognize that there are
[1:03:40] many
[1:03:41] at this hour that are falling away
[1:03:45] because the message
[1:03:48] when from when it started to when this
[1:03:51] Rapture is supposed to take place
[1:03:54] it looks so long is there really a
[1:03:56] rapture
[1:03:59] is there really going to be a body
[1:04:01] change
[1:04:04] are these things uh uh you know maybe
[1:04:08] the figment of a a real good man he was
[1:04:12] a good man you know a real good Bible
[1:04:15] teacher a real evangelist you know we
[1:04:19] might even call him a prophet because
[1:04:22] there's many other prophets anyway so so
[1:04:24] so he was good but you know he didn't
[1:04:27] have much Bible schooling
[1:04:30] to Northwestern Bible College
[1:04:33] and so the things that he were saying
[1:04:36] sounded good and maybe they were true
[1:04:38] but uh somewhere along the line he must
[1:04:41] have missed something and and the
[1:04:44] Rapture is not exactly the way that he
[1:04:47] was trying to present it to us you see
[1:04:51] that's the way that a lot of them are
[1:04:53] looking at it and so we find there has
[1:04:56] been and is going on right now of
[1:04:58] Falling Away
[1:05:00] there is a falling away going on people
[1:05:03] are murmuring they're questioning what's
[1:05:06] brother Branham really the prophet is he
[1:05:09] really Malachi 4 uh maybe he he put
[1:05:13] himself in there and he's not the one
[1:05:15] just like they told Moses you must have
[1:05:17] carved that thing yourself and bring it
[1:05:19] down here because you want to control
[1:05:20] all these people you know so oh yeah him
[1:05:25] you have people who followed this
[1:05:27] message
[1:05:29] are now going out and on the internet
[1:05:32] opposing the message
[1:05:34] finding fault with what we call the
[1:05:38] message of course the real message came
[1:05:42] out of the message
[1:05:45] you understand and when I say message
[1:05:47] you differentiate the one message
[1:05:50] between what is called the message and
[1:05:54] what is the message that's revealed to
[1:05:57] the True Believer
[1:05:59] amen there is a difference there amen so
[1:06:03] you must understand that or right there
[1:06:06] now we understand that's happening
[1:06:09] people are murmuring people are
[1:06:10] complaining people are saying things and
[1:06:13] God is allowing that that this this
[1:06:16] waiting period that's going on right now
[1:06:19] to create boredom as it did in Israel
[1:06:24] boredom is creating dissatisfaction it's
[1:06:28] creating in them uh impatience and all
[1:06:33] the hidden up uh virtues seven deadly
[1:06:37] sins that were hidden up within persons
[1:06:42] that Satan tried to kind of cover them
[1:06:45] up with religiosity and even come in the
[1:06:48] message with a former Pentecostal
[1:06:51] Holiness upon them and they're covered
[1:06:56] with the leaves of all kinds of various
[1:06:59] things but the pressure of waiting is
[1:07:03] bringing out for faculties out of these
[1:07:06] people out of people that they you can't
[1:07:10] even realize my goodness I didn't know
[1:07:13] that was there hidden underneath that
[1:07:16] kind of appearance
[1:07:19] what I'm saying is going on right now
[1:07:22] it's happening right now
[1:07:24] but God has a reason our purpose for
[1:07:26] everything
[1:07:28] This is the End of the Age
[1:07:30] of the church ages
[1:07:32] oh my and the angels Messengers uh
[1:07:37] Servants of God are to separate the
[1:07:41] wheat from the chaff the sheep from the
[1:07:45] goats separate them how by the word
[1:07:48] Hebrews 4 12 the word is sharp quick
[1:07:52] it's a discerner of the heart the
[1:07:55] thoughts amen it'll let you know who you
[1:07:58] are by the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:00] praise the Lord God's spirit is doing
[1:08:03] that oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:08:05] let me throw a thought in here quickly
[1:08:07] let me pass over this
[1:08:09] you know
[1:08:11] uh Moses and the people of Israel were
[1:08:14] under the aaronic priesthood is that
[1:08:16] right
[1:08:18] do you know the day Jesus died
[1:08:21] the aaronic priesthood came to an end
[1:08:25] amen
[1:08:26] Jesus the word who was the message of
[1:08:30] that hour
[1:08:31] the moment he Jesus the word that was
[1:08:36] called the message they didn't really
[1:08:38] realize who he was or call the word the
[1:08:42] moment he died the aaronic priesthood
[1:08:45] died
[1:08:46] and another priesthood came into being
[1:08:51] and that's what Paul recognized and was
[1:08:54] saying we are now here as the royal
[1:08:57] priesthood because we are the Royal seed
[1:09:01] with the royal priesthood to bring forth
[1:09:05] the word of God what is that royal
[1:09:06] priesthood the five genuine five-fold
[1:09:10] Ministry everybody is calling themselves
[1:09:12] fivefold Ministry but a real seed will
[1:09:15] recognize immediately the difference
[1:09:17] between the true and the false amen but
[1:09:21] the spirit the Living God God brings for
[1:09:24] a
[1:09:28] nodding to the order of Melchizedek we
[1:09:33] won't even go down that road I'm not
[1:09:36] talking about a large order
[1:09:38] as the one man approached me on the
[1:09:41] street when I was just about 18 years
[1:09:44] old and said as something about you
[1:09:49] which order you from I am from he told
[1:09:51] me I am from the order of so and so I
[1:09:54] said oh you from that order I said well
[1:09:57] I'm just from the order of melchized he
[1:09:59] said order of now that's the highest
[1:10:03] oh my God
[1:10:08] they sent me to tell I said they sent
[1:10:12] you to tell me
[1:10:14] I said no let me tell you what I see
[1:10:19] and I began to tell him and he began to
[1:10:21] run
[1:10:22] you're right he began to run because I
[1:10:25] started telling him by the Holy Spirit
[1:10:26] what I see ahead of him but brother
[1:10:29] sister a different order is now in
[1:10:32] progress
[1:10:34] a different order is now in progress but
[1:10:37] it could only come into progress in its
[1:10:40] full potential if I won't say everything
[1:10:43] I can say but you can take it and think
[1:10:46] now it couldn't come into its fullness
[1:10:48] until after Jesus
[1:10:52] died
[1:10:53] when he died one died and the other one
[1:10:56] comes to life praise the Lord and that
[1:10:59] is why life I think brother coffee you
[1:11:03] were preaching this just preaching not
[1:11:05] this but preaching along these lines
[1:11:08] um you know a week ago about life comes
[1:11:12] out of a death when something dies
[1:11:17] something has to die for you to live
[1:11:19] brother Branham said it we know that but
[1:11:22] praise the Lord what I'm trying to tell
[1:11:24] you from out off and here I say it out
[1:11:28] of the death of this mess message comes
[1:11:32] the life of the Bride
[1:11:35] the bride lives and tries out of the
[1:11:40] message
[1:11:42] because her birth came out of this mess
[1:11:46] and out of the mess that they're calling
[1:11:49] today the message out of that mess comes
[1:11:53] the life of the bride and a
[1:11:55] manifestation of the word and of this
[1:11:58] royal priesthood making itself declared
[1:12:01] for the glory of God there's nothing
[1:12:04] like it because it's the holy spirit
[1:12:07] it's not man made
[1:12:09] or men trying to make themselves
[1:12:11] something or the other no far be it
[1:12:14] matter of fact that if they can hide
[1:12:16] they get away
[1:12:18] they want to be out of sight
[1:12:21] and let her eyes see Jesus only
[1:12:24] see Jesus and Jesus alone amen Just One
[1:12:28] Look upon his face will change your life
[1:12:31] change your heart change your walk even
[1:12:35] if you're a Believer and you're
[1:12:37] recognize amen and you see Jesus my God
[1:12:41] hallelujah it lets you into another
[1:12:43] plane
[1:12:44] oh praise God forevermore and so we find
[1:12:50] out brother Branham has asked as
[1:12:53] questions
[1:12:54] many years ago in this hour
[1:12:58] don't change anything you're doing
[1:13:02] for if Jesus is coming in the morning
[1:13:05] Preach Today like if he's going to be 10
[1:13:08] years from today
[1:13:10] but live it like it's going to be at
[1:13:13] this hour he may appear
[1:13:17] don't you get yourself scrupled up in
[1:13:21] into anything
[1:13:23] but what I'm doing I'm trying to warn
[1:13:26] you
[1:13:27] about see
[1:13:30] what I see
[1:13:32] but don't be odd
[1:13:34] don't make yourself peculiar in other
[1:13:38] words he's trying to tell you just be a
[1:13:41] be yourself
[1:13:42] just be a human being don't try to
[1:13:46] walk around with the biggest Bible to
[1:13:49] prove you are the biggest Christian or
[1:13:51] you put on the holy the most holiest
[1:13:54] face you can find or something just go
[1:13:57] along and relax you are you
[1:14:00] God is the master artist and he never
[1:14:03] made two of anything
[1:14:05] not even twins are identical we say
[1:14:09] identical because of our human sight but
[1:14:12] with God this makes nothing two of

[1:19:27] to be a sin
[1:19:31] solid Christian
[1:19:34] oh my there's so many Christians uh
[1:19:37] losing it they're taking the message
[1:19:39] trying to analyze it debated twist and
[1:19:43] everything else these these uh types and
[1:19:46] shadows and representations and Parables
[1:19:49] and Proverbs in the word until the Mind
[1:19:52] becomes all twisted up amen or twisted
[1:19:56] up like that and going off in every
[1:19:59] possible way but I want to he said to a
[1:20:02] man saying Christians amen
[1:20:05] want you to be sane sensible amen it's
[1:20:09] similar to what I always say uh you know
[1:20:12] you also got to be practical
[1:20:17] is that right
[1:20:20] don't only be so spiritually minded that
[1:20:24] you know Earthly good
[1:20:27] you also have to deal with things here
[1:20:30] after you finish praying and shouting in
[1:20:32] here you still got to go and pay your
[1:20:34] rent tomorrow
[1:20:35] I'm sorry I'm starting to talk like this
[1:20:37] but I look look this is when the cooking
[1:20:41] gets down to gravy and
[1:20:43] grits and the bottom of the pot and I
[1:20:46] used to love that when I was younger and
[1:20:49] they finished I scrape that out I love
[1:20:51] that anyway whatever term you used to
[1:20:54] use we call it bun bun we call it this
[1:20:56] we call it that we dig it out and eat it
[1:20:59] praise because we feel the strength of
[1:21:01] everything settled to the bottom
[1:21:04] so it might not look as good as yours
[1:21:07] but I can tell you there's something in
[1:21:09] there
[1:21:10] there's something in there and I'm
[1:21:13] enjoying it praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:15] glory god so be a sane sensible solid
[1:21:19] Christian
[1:21:21] don't go wrong making yourself like an
[1:21:23] old
[1:21:24] lovely beautiful sisters but they're
[1:21:27] going to make their face up
[1:21:30] nobody should talk to them or approach
[1:21:32] them or anything like that because
[1:21:34] they're so spiritual but you still got
[1:21:36] to live right here
[1:21:38] you still got to live right here is that
[1:21:40] right
[1:21:41] praise the Lord
[1:21:42] you got to take care of all your
[1:21:45] natural things right uh interject here
[1:21:50] brother Tim but it's not proper
[1:21:52] preaching like this but you know some
[1:21:54] people says money is evil it's bad it's
[1:21:59] yeah and you spend all week working for
[1:22:01] it
[1:22:03] you curse it on a Sunday and go work for
[1:22:05] it on a Monday what sense is that it's
[1:22:09] not the money it's evil it's the love of
[1:22:12] money that's
[1:22:13] right that's what's evil it's you the
[1:22:15] evil is in you not in the money money is
[1:22:18] an inanimate object right it's something
[1:22:21] you can burn you can you can throw away
[1:22:23] man you know if you have money to burn
[1:22:25] you can burn it that's what I mean
[1:22:28] but
[1:22:31] praise the Lord hallelujah amen say
[1:22:35] brother Simon Don't Preach like that
[1:22:36] preach us serious messages about the
[1:22:39] half hour Silence of seven thunders in
[1:22:41] the heavens and all that that's good but
[1:22:43] this is part of it but it's not in the
[1:22:45] way you think it should be but this is
[1:22:47] the way it is and the truth is going to
[1:22:49] get true to you more than you can ever
[1:22:51] believe
[1:22:53] now uh he said
[1:22:55] um I'll be I'm I'll be standing right
[1:22:59] here preaching if he's coming tomorrow
[1:23:01] morning
[1:23:02] I'll be saying the same things I'm
[1:23:04] saying now if he's coming
[1:23:07] this is my post of Duty and when he
[1:23:11] comes I'll just move right on from there
[1:23:15] with him wherever he is going I'm gonna
[1:23:17] follow him amen but I'm going to stand
[1:23:20] at my post of Duty praise the name of
[1:23:22] the Lord oh praise God forevermore or if
[1:23:26] you're holding potatoes for those
[1:23:28] potatoes oh don't drop the when he comes
[1:23:32] then you drop the hole and then you take
[1:23:36] off with him but while he's not here yet
[1:23:39] he says keep pouring us potatoes amen
[1:23:42] praise God hallelujah oh my isn't that
[1:23:46] wonderful remember I I'm remembering uh
[1:23:50] again I've I spoke this to U.S Believers
[1:23:53] how that in the Old South
[1:23:57] these slaves were working
[1:24:00] and they were there
[1:24:03] picking the watermelons
[1:24:07] and the boss left and went out
[1:24:10] and they worked and the Sun is hot real
[1:24:13] hot
[1:24:15] and they say he's not here now
[1:24:18] he's not coming back for maybe half an
[1:24:20] hour or so or an hour so let's go and
[1:24:23] take a
[1:24:24] rest in the shade
[1:24:26] and there was a huge fence so the sun
[1:24:29] shining this way the shade there they
[1:24:31] sat behind the fence and they were there
[1:24:34] and while they're there this you know
[1:24:37] one of them or two of them start singing
[1:24:39] the boss thinks I'm working but I ain't
[1:24:44] the boss thinks I'm working but I ain't
[1:24:48] the boss thinks I'm working but I ain't
[1:24:51] then they heard a voice from over the
[1:24:53] other side of the fencing and the rascal
[1:24:56] thinks I'm going to pay him but I ain't
[1:25:03] ah you see it's the same thing
[1:25:08] keep working whether you see the boss or
[1:25:11] not
[1:25:12] and when he comes he will reward you
[1:25:16] he will reward you according to what you
[1:25:20] have done for his glory and for his
[1:25:22] honor
[1:25:23] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:25:26] hallelujah see drop that hole but don't
[1:25:30] drop it until that Jubilee trumpet
[1:25:33] sounds
[1:25:34] amen hallelujah and when you know it
[1:25:37] then you drop it and you run amen until
[1:25:42] that trumpet sounds you just do that for
[1:25:46] the glory of God hallelujah amen and
[1:25:50] praise God so it's time to cross from
[1:25:53] what man calls the message
[1:25:57] Amen brother Brandon I'm just showing
[1:25:59] you because you the devil would play
[1:26:01] play with words and try to mess with
[1:26:03] your mind you see Moses message was to
[1:26:06] the children of Israel
[1:26:09] when Moses died the aaronic priesthood
[1:26:14] continued on but it changed the moment
[1:26:17] the full word Jesus Christ came on the
[1:26:21] scene
[1:26:22] it passed away
[1:26:24] I wanted to know brother Branham over
[1:26:26] and over again typed himself as in the
[1:26:29] position of Moses
[1:26:31] leading the turian Dr Moses many many
[1:26:34] messages uh leading the turn to the
[1:26:36] promised land of what the fullness of
[1:26:39] the word right and we've come to that
[1:26:42] again so when I say leaving the message
[1:26:45] I'm saying leaving what they call the
[1:26:49] message of the Moses of our day leaving
[1:26:53] that outward part of it but the
[1:26:56] revelation of the word can never pass
[1:26:58] away
[1:27:00] it can never pass away for that is
[1:27:03] Eternal Word it cannot pass away and
[1:27:07] it's within the mess the message that is
[1:27:10] called the message am I getting you
[1:27:12] mixed up
[1:27:13] I hope you're understanding it's in the
[1:27:16] message so you got to listen to tape
[1:27:18] still
[1:27:19] you got to hear the prophet
[1:27:22] you got to hear it and out of that
[1:27:26] you will receive what God wants you to
[1:27:29] receive praise the Lord can I preach a
[1:27:33] little more
[1:27:35] now one disciple asked Jesus oh did this
[1:27:41] Z disciples asked him why did the scribe
[1:27:44] say Elias must first come
[1:27:48] Jesus said he's already come
[1:27:51] you didn't recognize it
[1:27:54] amen and they understood then it was
[1:27:58] John the Baptist
[1:28:00] those were elected Apostles and they
[1:28:04] still could not see who he was
[1:28:09] my uh is this telling me that even
[1:28:13] people in a message are going to
[1:28:15] question if this is real if if it's true
[1:28:20] are they going to have doubts or can
[1:28:23] they see the fullness of the word Jesus
[1:28:26] is giving it in type here where the
[1:28:28] Branham is saying it here again listen
[1:28:31] now now think of it the coming of the
[1:28:35] Lord you know
[1:28:36] is going to be a secret coming
[1:28:41] everybody is not going to know about it
[1:28:44] they're going to be saying that the Lord
[1:28:46] is coming or the Lord Has Come and they
[1:28:49] were saying it but actually know it and
[1:28:53] have a revelation that the Lord is here
[1:28:56] he's in our next
[1:28:58] his presence is with us he is in our
[1:29:02] hearts he lives in me amen praise God
[1:29:05] see the coming of the Lord is going to
[1:29:08] be a secret coming for two will be in
[1:29:12] the bed I'll take one and I'll leave one
[1:29:16] amen because election and predestination
[1:29:19] is from what before the foundation of
[1:29:23] the world you don't come now and say oh
[1:29:25] I'm going to get saved yeah but you can
[1:29:28] say that I'm going to get saved but you
[1:29:32] really can't be saved and be in the
[1:29:35] bride because she has already been
[1:29:37] elected from before the foundation of
[1:29:41] the world she has not been selected now
[1:29:44] she's being identified Now by her
[1:29:47] reaction to the word and her behavior
[1:29:51] Amen in relations to the word and so God
[1:29:55] is identifying her by seeing his own
[1:29:57] characteristics in her
[1:30:00] in the Believers that receive the
[1:30:02] fullness of this word
[1:30:05] oh praise God after he has proved his
[1:30:08] word prove this elect prove this people
[1:30:09] prove them in the wilderness of child's
[1:30:12] troubles tribulation trespasses he's
[1:30:14] tried them in every possible way praise
[1:30:16] God hallelujah that he recognizes them
[1:30:19] Hallelujah of who they are amen
[1:30:23] don't you know people are disappearing
[1:30:25] off the face of the Earth
[1:30:27] nobody can account for it amen
[1:30:31] and you say one of these days people may
[1:30:34] say to me you mean the tribulation that
[1:30:38] thing is that thing is on us now the
[1:30:42] tribulation is here I thought the church
[1:30:44] had to go in a Rapture and go through
[1:30:47] the tribulation go through that before
[1:30:51] the tribulation comes amen this isn't
[1:30:55] that the right now that's why I'm
[1:30:57] telling you the state of the message we
[1:30:59] are right in that hour right now where
[1:31:02] people are caught in that vertex where
[1:31:05] they can be sucked in by the devil and
[1:31:08] not recognize what is taking place right
[1:31:11] now
[1:31:12] Jesus may come before morning
[1:31:15] Jesus may come any moment
[1:31:18] he may come I don't know Prophet said it
[1:31:21] could be a hundred years away but that
[1:31:23] don't make no difference to me I'm
[1:31:24] living for him right now like if he's
[1:31:26] gonna come tomorrow morning or the next
[1:31:28] minute amen that's the way we ought to
[1:31:31] live for him and walk with him amen oh
[1:31:34] praise God forevermore amen yes sir my
[1:31:38] goodness think of it the secret you see
[1:31:42] that will be the secret coming of the
[1:31:45] Lord
[1:31:46] and these people being beginning to
[1:31:49] disappear and don't realize and
[1:31:53] understand that the Rapture could take
[1:31:55] place and they would not do it
[1:31:58] and they and there there was no nothing
[1:32:01] about that for that will be the secret
[1:32:05] going away of the church
[1:32:08] you see two things
[1:32:10] we'll meet the Lord in the air
[1:32:12] he is coming
[1:32:14] he said this is his secret coming
[1:32:17] and the Rapture is the secret going
[1:32:21] of the bride and the two meets the Lord
[1:32:25] meet together like Isaac and Rebecca met
[1:32:28] in the field now
[1:32:30] he meets the Lord in the air but it's
[1:32:34] all done so secretly
[1:32:37] because they're looking for a Rapture
[1:32:39] according to man's imagination
[1:32:42] they don't realize you are already being
[1:32:45] translated by the revealed word of God
[1:32:50] you are already undergoing your body
[1:32:54] change by God's power to transform
[1:32:58] you are already changing from Glory unto
[1:33:02] Glory until you step right into the
[1:33:05] glory land
[1:33:06] it's going on right now
[1:33:09] praise God why do you think Paul said we
[1:33:13] are not going to be asleep you see how
[1:33:14] Paul thought it was so eminent that it
[1:33:17] could happen any minute now he said we
[1:33:19] are not going to be asleep because when
[1:33:21] the Rapture comes he says some will be
[1:33:23] alive
[1:33:25] Hallelujah and you who are alive will be
[1:33:27] what changed changed when when you're
[1:33:31] alive you've been changed by the power
[1:33:33] of the Revelation or the word of the
[1:33:35] Living God hallelujah your change is
[1:33:38] going on what change you're changing
[1:33:40] from your mortal into immortality this
[1:33:43] Mortal shall put on Immortal amen praise
[1:33:47] God that's going on right now I'm in the
[1:33:50] process
[1:33:51] I'm in the process I don't know about
[1:33:54] you but I'm in the process
[1:33:56] amen the Rapture is really a process of
[1:34:00] change leading to the the the event
[1:34:03] right and that event is an instant but a
[1:34:07] process leading to an incident where the
[1:34:09] spirit of God takes you out of here by
[1:34:12] the grace of the Living God hallelujah
[1:34:15] look at the danger of it
[1:34:17] now he says the secret going away of the
[1:34:23] church the and you know that that's
[1:34:28] going on but many people will go right
[1:34:31] on preaching
[1:34:33] you got to realize that I can put the
[1:34:36] word in here preaching the message
[1:34:38] because before that he said Apostles and
[1:34:43] yet they could not see this
[1:34:45] they could not see what was happening
[1:34:48] here and they'll sincerely go on
[1:34:51] preaching saying they believe
[1:34:54] and even adding to the church building
[1:34:58] churches and going on like that not
[1:35:00] knowing the Rapture is done past and
[1:35:04] they're left behind you remember my
[1:35:06] message on Left Behind
[1:35:08] where I preach showing that people
[1:35:10] already being left behind
[1:35:13] they don't understand that they're left
[1:35:16] behind because others have caught the
[1:35:19] revelation of the last last prophets

[1:35:48] unfolding revelation of the word of God
[1:35:50] that has caught the hearts of the True

[1:36:21] that amen you better take
[1:36:25] the whole word of God
[1:36:28] the whole word of God
[1:36:32] and hold on to it
[1:36:35] quit your Hollywood acting
[1:36:38] you know what he's talking about
[1:36:41] tetrical Christianity
[1:36:44] where the Christianity is a message Act
[1:36:49] message people usually has this costume
[1:36:53] you know the dress would be this way
[1:36:55] they shirt their pants the way they talk
[1:36:58] and so on they have a certain message
[1:37:01] suit they put on and you recognize them
[1:37:05] by that and uh this is what he's saying
[1:37:08] stop the Hollywood acting be yourself
[1:37:12] live your life
[1:37:14] but according to the word
[1:37:16] Liberty doesn't mean lawlessness
[1:37:19] Freedom doesn't mean folly it's not
[1:37:22] foolishness it's living by the word then
[1:37:27] you are truly free
[1:37:29] you are free praise the name of the Lord
[1:37:32] nobody's here to watch come and listen
[1:37:34] at your whole story if you're turning on
[1:37:36] a TV
[1:37:38] nobody is there to come and get close to
[1:37:41] you and give you a hug to smell your
[1:37:43] suit whether you had a smoke before you
[1:37:46] came in
[1:37:50] I'm not telling you you should have a
[1:37:52] smoke before you come in
[1:37:54] so don't go say brother Simon said he
[1:37:56] never said
[1:37:58] but I'm trying to tell you we don't have
[1:38:02] to put on anything
[1:38:04] because it's all by grace
[1:38:07] as preached the other night it's Grace
[1:38:10] this Grace has brought me safe that far
[1:38:13] far and Grace will lead us home
[1:38:16] is that right so oh but we've got to be
[1:38:19] perfect in the lord I can't make
[1:38:20] mistakes that the other day that guy was
[1:38:22] grinding on my toe but look I stood by
[1:38:25] the word you know
[1:38:31] a real Christian would just bang get off
[1:38:34] my toe so but that can be a Christian
[1:38:36] Paul said be angry and sin not right
[1:38:40] it's not that you can't be angry it's
[1:38:42] not you can't be displeased about
[1:38:43] something but you don't break the word
[1:38:46] and even if you did
[1:38:48] the Bible says there's an advocate but
[1:38:50] the father go back and repent about it
[1:38:53] so live the careless life
[1:38:56] I mean not in the way you think and care
[1:38:59] less but Jesus said not to have any
[1:39:01] cares
[1:39:03] so you're you're free from care and you
[1:39:06] live that life where you know you're
[1:39:08] free from care because even if you're
[1:39:10] you're facing things God is working
[1:39:13] things out
[1:39:15] is that all right I don't care what
[1:39:17] problem you have there's not one tangle
[1:39:20] in life that he can't undo
[1:39:24] there's no not that Satan can put
[1:39:26] together that can tie you up that God
[1:39:29] can't bring you out
[1:39:31] is that right do you believe him you
[1:39:33] trust him
[1:39:35] oh praise God forevermore Hallelujah

[1:45:04] you're going to
[1:45:05] I said I don't know but I feel inspired
[1:45:09] to go
[1:45:10] and we got right into the parking lot
[1:45:13] nothing Supernatural happened nothing
[1:45:16] happened I stepped open the door of the
[1:45:19] car and I stepped out as anybody would
[1:45:22] one foot out first and the moment I
[1:45:25] stepped out the wind blew and a piece of
[1:45:27] paper came
[1:45:28] and my shoe landed on it
[1:45:30] and I just said what is that
[1:45:33] picked it up
[1:45:34] and on it miss the song so so
[1:45:38] there's the name of a gentleman
[1:45:42] said okay there's the name
[1:45:44] that I have to go and see

[1:46:48] look into it let's have a hearing and
[1:46:50] they call for a hearing and we had a
[1:46:52] hearing in the city hall and I was there

[1:46:58] this gentleman was there and other
[1:47:01] people are coming up and saying well we

[1:47:07] hide behind there and do their drugs and
[1:47:10] smoking and all kinds of stuff going on
[1:47:12] there and stuff like that so I said well

[1:47:52] and everything's fine what about you
[1:47:55] electrical everything is all right you
[1:47:57] asked the other one everything is all
[1:47:58] right he said well then I say it's past
[1:47:59] that's it there's no argument there's
[1:48:02] nobody higher than him to argue with
[1:48:03] anyway praise the Lord and it was passed
[1:48:07] but I'm just trying to show you

[1:48:45] here to tell you that like Ruth in the
[1:48:49] Bible we are to watch

[1:49:10] the field gleaning
[1:49:12] you know what gleaning means it means
[1:49:15] she was going through all this shock and
[1:49:19] the straw that was left trying to find
[1:49:21] those last seeds that were under there
[1:49:25] hidden I don't care if I go got to go
[1:49:28] through ten thousand shock to find one
[1:49:31] elect that's the job God put us here to
[1:49:34] do we got to find them wherever they are
[1:49:36] brother sister let's run with the
[1:49:39] message amen praise God in the words of
[1:49:42] precious brother biscoll when he once
[1:49:44] said he says there is no other Church
[1:49:46] age after this one there is nobody else
[1:49:49] to run run let every one of us run with

[1:50:08] told to wait I want you to know that we
[1:50:11] are supposed to wait
[1:50:13] remember that
[1:50:15] the 10 foolish word the 10 virgins
[1:50:18] five were wise and five were foolish
[1:50:22] and the five
[1:50:24] was thinking the same thing the Lord is
[1:50:26] delaying the bread whom the lane is
[1:50:27] coming so we're going to go out
[1:50:30] we're going to go out and we're gonna
[1:50:32] get back before he comes is that right
[1:50:35] don't you take that chance don't you
[1:50:38] even think about going back out there
[1:50:40] and testing the waters in the world
[1:50:43] don't you even think of going back out
[1:50:45] in the church world and test the waters
[1:50:48] out there and thinking you're going to
[1:50:49] get back in time you may never make it
[1:50:52] back in time
[1:50:53] amen but while they were doing that what
[1:50:57] happened with the with the wise virgins
[1:51:00] there were busy trimming their laps
[1:51:04] they were trimming their lamps they were
[1:51:06] doing that let me bring you another
[1:51:08] thought there remember when the boss's
[1:51:10] son told that young woman he says look
[1:51:13] I'm coming back for you next year I want
[1:51:17] you to wait for my coming amen the rest
[1:51:21] of them laughing mocking and everything
[1:51:22] else but what does the story tell us
[1:51:25] during that year she was busy getting
[1:51:28] ready her wedding garments and that is
[1:51:31] what we are supposed to do get ready
[1:51:34] you're ready garments the marriage of
[1:51:36] the land has come and his wife has made
[1:51:40] herself ready oh praise God oh if you're
[1:51:44] not ready get ready

[1:51:48] whether you've ready or not he's coming
[1:51:51] I said whether you're ready or not he's
[1:51:53] still coming so you're better here for
[1:51:55] the glory of God Amen praise the name of
[1:51:58] the Lord hallelujah amen this gospel
[1:52:02] must be preached as a witness
[1:52:04] you say oh what's useless so many people
[1:52:07] out there lost and never mind
[1:52:10] it must be preached as a witness
[1:52:13] and how can you be a witness unless
[1:52:16] you're a true Witness
[1:52:17] in other words only the elect who have
[1:52:21] caught the genuine Revelation can really
[1:52:24] give a genuine witness of the word of
[1:52:27] God
[1:52:29] you got what I'm saying only they can
[1:52:31] give a true Witness
[1:52:33] it's not to get them saved
[1:52:36] but the God has to have something to
[1:52:39] judge them by and he only judges by his
[1:52:42] word
[1:52:43] so he has to have that out there did you
[1:52:46] hear this didn't you hear that did you
[1:52:48] see that man that woman didn't you see
[1:52:51] their attitude didn't you know something
[1:52:52] was different amen see the gospel must
