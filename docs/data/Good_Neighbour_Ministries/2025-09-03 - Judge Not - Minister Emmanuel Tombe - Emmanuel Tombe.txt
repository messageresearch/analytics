Let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer. Precious Lord, it's an honor to be back in your house tonight, oh God. Yes, Lord. We're so thankful, oh Lord Lord, that you've given us strength and the grace to make it in, Lord. Lord, we are here to show whose side we are on. And that is on the side of Jesus. Lord, we pray that you would move in a simple but mighty way, Lord God, and just bless your children who've sacrificed the time, your strength, the efforts, Lord, to be here tonight. Lord, I just yield myself to you that you would take this vessel of clay, Lord, and speak to your children, Lord. None of us, Lord, are worthy, but you alone, Lord Jesus. You are the worthy one. And so, Lord, we look to you. May you just meet every need and bless every heart, Lord, I pray. Bless the word in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Thank you, musicians. May the Lord bless you richly. just have your seats for a minute or so. I just uh would like to unwind myself a little bit. I'm a bit nervous tonight. I was just telling Pastor Danny, you know, it's not easy to fill the shoes after this weekend. Um as you all know, we had a mighty mighty weekend and God moved among us. He blessed us richly and so you know to come behind those powerful preachers is not easy. I just count myself a spare tire but uh we are here to look to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But before we proceed, I just want to take a few moments to pay tribute to our pastor. You know on Sunday hearing him thanking everyone. This is just me. I just felt to my heart just to take a few moments to appreciate our pastor. Before you clap your hands, thank you. Just hold it for a moment. We will do it together. But um you know I got some testimonies that came back of just seeing what they saw him do out there helping out making everybody feel comfortable just being involved. And to me those are qualities of a true shepherd. So Pastor Danny I just want to appreciate you for being an example of a true servant of God. uh by leadership. You know Jesus said that he that is the greatest among you shall be your servant. Is that right? &gt;&gt; If you want to be great, learn to become a servant. Be humble. That's when God will use you. So I want to read this quote uh from brother Brham because some people have problems when you thank a man but we're going to find out what brother Brham thought about those things. So I'm going to read this quote from the message the Pomian church age 1960. It says, "And in this our pastor here, of course, he was referring to brother Neville, but I'm going to direct to pastor Danny. I haven't got a chance to say very much about him, but I want to I want you all try to meet our pastor. He's certainly a real brother in Christ. We are happy to have a brother uh brought up in a Methodist background with holiness." Of course, he's talking about Pastor Neville. And we all know Oman Neville. Everybody around here does. There's nobody puts a finger on his life. He don't like for me to say that, but yet I'd rather give him a little bitty rose bud now than a whole wreath after he's gone. And now this is the time. One night I was going out of the church and someone said, "Oh, brother Brham, I sure appreciated that sermon." And I said, "Thank you." And so somebody standing at the door, a minister said, "Well, bless God. I don't want nobody telling me that. See said I want all the glory to go to God. I said, "Well, it does." See? And I said, "Well, I like it myself." This is brother Brennham now. I said, "I really like it." And I said, "I have to be truthful." And he said, "Well, I don't like for people to say that about me. Bless God." I said, "There's just one difference between me and you. I'm honest about it and you're not." Is that right? So, I just want us together to give a hand to our pastor [Applause] I'm fully aware that the audience is not here. The crowd is gone, but Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is everything. So, Pastor Danny, we appreciate you. We thank you so much for being an example and the lives that you're touching, what people see. I truly want to appreciate you for that. Amen. So with that said, let's stand to our feet. We are going to be quick tonight. Very simple message. And um I just want to speak on a simple thought. Judge not. Judge not. So we're going to read two scriptures. I got my inspiration actually from uh brother Dig's sermon on Saturday night when he preached on it's a season for change. &gt;&gt; So that's where I got my inspiration from. So Matthew chapter 7 verse 1 and 2. Amen. Verse one, it says, "Judge not that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye meet, it shall be measured to you again." Romans chapter 2 verse 1 to4. Romans chapter 2 verse 1 to4. Amen. Therefore, thou art inexcusable, all men, whosoever thou art, that judgest, for wherein thou judgeest another, thou condemnst thyself. For thou that judgest doest this, sorry, for thou that judgest doest the same things. But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. And thinkst thou this, oh men, that judge them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God, or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadth to repentance. May the Lord bless the word. You can have your seats. Amen. How many were blessed on the weekend? &gt;&gt; And I trust that you're still feeding on the anointing just how God came down to encourage us all. And I trust that with what was said, it will give us energy to keep fighting the good fight of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I just want to go into this subject. Judge not. And uh before we get started, I want to uh show the difference between these two words, judging versus judgment. You know, we live in a world where it's very difficult to correct people or even to try and give some advice without people saying, "Well, you're being judgmental." &gt;&gt; You hear that a lot. you know, somebody's doing something wrong and in good faith you try to maybe say something and most times you get the response, oh, you're being judgmental. But um I just want to look at the difference between these two words, judging versus judgment. Amen. So in terms of the biblical definition of judging, it means the forbidden act of hypocritical condemnation and the formation of negative opinions without full knowledge or the necessary act of righteous discernment to evaluate actions as good or evil. Right? So that's the definition of judging. Now when it comes to judgment of again this is in the bib biblical context it means God's righteous assessment of actions, thoughts and intentions which leads to a decision about an individual's destiny. So for example, Jesus said in Matthew 23:23, he said, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye pay tithe of mint and common, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law." And then he goes to list them out. judgments, mercy, and faith. These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. So, righteous judgment according to the way God interprets it or the way he sees it is really based on, you know, the fruit that a tree bears. uh and not necessarily the seed. You know, brother Diggs demonstrated when he showed that seed here and as we all know, well, by now we know that it was a peach seed. I believe that. Right now, if you take that same seed and you are to compare it to, let's say, an apricot, chances are you will not know the difference. Is that right? So a a lot can go wrong when you judge something when it's still in seed form. And there's also a high probability of mistaken identity. You can easily come to the wrong conclusions about something. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I believe that every one of us here seated here tonight or even online at some point in our walk with the Lord, we have been like those seeds or the seed which was we saw here on Saturday. And until that seed is goes through the process of rotting and dying and being planted and eventually bringing forth fruit. you really can't tell what it is. So the basis of my sermon tonight is to avoid judging the seed when it's still in that form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we if we're not careful, we can pass the wrong judgments. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The outside might not look good. We may not like the way it appears. But until that seed has gone through a process, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; And eventually bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then like Jesus said, by their fruits &gt;&gt; you will know them. &gt;&gt; Not the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many of us, I can guarantee the seed never looked good from the beginning. We were corrupt, evil, and had not been for the grace of God, many of us would not be sitting here. So this is the approach that God takes. God has permitted every one of us, like I said a few moments ago, we are allowed to be fruit inspectors, not judge judgmental of the seed, but to judge the fruit. And what do I mean by that? You go to the grocery store, let's say you want an apple or or whatever fruits you go through. You don't just grab any fruit and stuff it in your bag, do you? You take your time. You turn it around and you flip it. You make sure there's there's nothing wrong with it. Is that right? No blemishes because you want the best. And so we go through that in the natural to make sure that what we are, you know, going to buy is something that is pleasant because you're going to eat that fruit. So that's why, like I said, Jesus said, "By their fruits, you shall know them." So how many of us, you know, looked like bad seeds before we came to Christ? We've heard testimonies like our dear pastor at one point he was a drug addict. Maybe fornicators, adulterers, thieves, crooks, mean, rebellious, mean-spirited. I'm sure every one of us can identify that at some point in in in our lives, we were not acceptable. Praise God. But beneath all of that, I thank God that there is representation that God placed in inside that horrible looking seed waiting for the appointed time when the sunlight of the gospel. The word that came &gt;&gt; for the appointed time and called out our names. Amen. and the Holy Spirit being sent to quicken that seed. It has brought us to life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So we are sitting here by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I don't believe in passing judgments to anybody because we are still on a journey. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Some of us are going through sanctification being cleaned up from bad habits. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; We've got to extend grace to one another. sanctification. You're going through that process. Extend grace to to the person. We all make mistakes. We do wrong things. We fall down. Like the Bible says, a righteous man fallth how many times? Not once. But just to give context, seven times. But what happens? He rises up. So God is showing us that there is grace that needs to be extended. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know to you parents uh who have raised kids and maybe potential parents, you will soon realize that once you are in charge of that human being, you've got to have a lot of grace. You know, maybe before you were married, you you had ideas of how you're going to raise your kids, you know, with specific rules and different guidelines. All these are things that we form in our minds, you know, of how we're going to have the perfect family, the perfect kids. Everybody wants the perfect kids. But I've got news for you. You don't decide how those kids come. So as a parent, you realize that as your kids are growing, you've got to adjust. You know, one may be different from this one. And the way you treat or handle this one is different from this one. You know, there are no onesizefits all. And you find that it's the same thing with God. He deals with each and every one of us according to the measure of faith and grace that has been given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so thankful to have a father like that &gt;&gt; that in spite of my mistakes, in spite of our mistakes, there is grace &gt;&gt; to help us along the way. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, Brother Brham, I want to read this quote. Like I said, I won't be long tonight, but just to encourage us along our uh our walk with the Lord. He says in this message, Hebrews chapter 7, preached 19:57. He says, "Esau was twice the gentleman of Jacob." Now, we all know the story of these two boys. Is that right? If we had to judge him today to be a member of our church, you would take Esau a thousand to one. &gt;&gt; Now think of that. Brother Brham is saying that if you and I had to judge between these two boys, Esau and Jacob, &gt;&gt; we would pick Esau. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you didn't know him, but God took Jacob. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What would you do with St. Paul? That's another example. If he want to be a minister, a little old hook nose hooknosed Jew and his mouth setting sideways going along just forcing and he was going to tear out the church. He's going to do everything. You would have thought he committed the unpardonable sin. But God said he is my servant. Amen. &gt;&gt; So do you see how we cannot judge anything by looks, by impression? Amen. God takes men and makes them different. Not men taking God and becoming different. Pay attention to that. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; God takes men and makes them different. But not man taking God and becoming different. It's not what you do, &gt;&gt; what you will, what you think. It's what God does. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; And that's the story. Hallelujah. So Jacob, let's take him as an example. We all know the story of Jacob. He was a crook. a deceiver. But you know, one day he met God. In Genesis chapter 32, Jacob came to a point in his life where he realized he needed to have a conference with God. Amen. And there's an appointed time for everything. Here was Jacob. He was in bad terms with his brother Esau because Esau had been cheated the birthright and he had purposed to kill him. That's according to the scriptures. So Rebecca, Jacob's uh mother told him, Jacob, your life is at stake. Run and go and live with your uncle Laban. And so that's what he did. But you see, no matter how far you run, if you don't deal with certain issues, your past will always catch up with you. I won't go into all the details, but you see now here was Jacob. He has gone through this whole cycle and he has stayed with his uncle Laban. and things went bad in in in that relationship. Now he had to run away. And it was in that process while he was in that process now with this uncle's in bad terms. His brother is in bad terms. Now what does he do? And I thank God that he's such a God that he will bring many of us to a place where we have no choice but to look up to him. And so when Jacob finally met God, there's one thing I want to bring out that is I believe is a highlight. You know the story of how he wrestled with the Lord. But in the moment, in that moment of wrestling with the angel of the Lord, God asked him a question and he said, "What is your name?" Now, honestly, don't you think God knows our names? He knows every one of us. He knows me. He knows every one of us. &gt;&gt; But God asked him, says, "Jacob, what is your name?" And eventually Jacob, he answered. He says, "I am Jacob." What God was looking for was for a confession. Confess who you are. Amen. We cannot come to God and think that God will just overlook things. That's why the Bible says, "Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ." We saw it happening here. at the past. I enjoy the way the process you went through asking specific questions. Do you denounce your past? Do you denounce your sins? You must confess and say, "God, I am a sinner. I am wretched. I am undone." God wants us to confess. And finally, when Jacob confessed who he was, God says, "All right, it's time to change your name." And from that moment, we know that Jacob walked a different walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at from that moment, all the fear that Jacob had of his brother uh Esau, I guess, Esau, it was gone. He finally had the courage to face his past and God in his goodness intervened and you can see the relationship. By the time Jacob came to meet with his brother Esau, it wasn't a time of war but of reconciliation, hugs, restoration of family, forgiveness. God can do things in your life, in my life that we least expect. The the only thing God wants from us is to come his provided way. &gt;&gt; Amen. So to me that was such a beautiful example of uh you know how God can take a man who looks horrible on the outside but inside him there was something special. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So the seed might not look good on the outside but don't worry. Amen. God knows how to find his own. It could be your husband. It could be your wife. Exercise patience and longsuffering. It could be your children. Exercise patience and longsuffering. Continue to display the token. Like the prophet said, always display that token. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because it's the token life that wins the wayward. Praise God. It's not how much we put rules down and try to restrict people with this and that. Those things have their place. But I'll tell you this, when that token is on display. I'm telling you, it has the greatest impact better than any words that I could speak or any man could speak. Let that token life be on display and watch and see what happens. Praise God. So don't feel discouraged when you've done your very best and it looks like nothing is working. Don't be discouraged. Hallelujah. Like we sing that song, take it to the Lord in prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe your husband is not behaving at his best. Just take it to the Lord in prayer. It could be your children. take you to the Lord in prayer because we have a friend who sticks closer than a brother. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So to be like Job who stood in a gap for his family, this is what Job said. I like this. The Bible said, "And he sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offering according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Thus did Job continually. It wasn't a one-time thing. It might look like nothing is happening today. Try tomorrow. It doesn't happen this week, next week, this month, next month, maybe not this year, next year. Continually apply that token. Eventually, it's going to stick. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So remain steadfast because I believe that God is still on the throne and his grace is sufficient for every one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So do you all agree that every one of us we have looked like bad seeds on the outside whether it's the preacher who's preaching the gospel at one point the grace of God had to reach down to him or the one sitting on the pew just because somebody came yesterday it does not mean that we should look down upon them do you know let me say this I'm just getting ahead of myself, but Paul said this. I I just want to read that real quick because it's fitting for what I want to say here. Paul says this, "We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves." So according to the scripture, God purposely allows people in our midst, weak ones, in order for others to bear the infirmities of those who are weak. It's not for us to go and gossip and talk about this one and that one. We are called to be intercessors. You see a brother going through something, don't pick up the phone and say, "Did you see what he did or what she did?" Well, I don't see him. I don't see her. What about going in your closet? Just you and God. And call upon the Lord. Say, "Lord, my brother, my sister seems to be going through a situation. I'm coming to stand in the gap for them." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Our young people, we are living in a terrible age. We should stand in a gap for our young people because some of the things they are facing right now cannot be compared to what we faced &gt;&gt; 15, 20, 30 years ago. &gt;&gt; Hell has been unleashed in this age. &gt;&gt; And so they are fighting battles that some of us have no clue unless you're in their shoes. Amen. So what should we do? Take the role of an intercessor. &gt;&gt; Amen. And pray for them. Intercede for them. Somebody stops coming to church. Go before the Lord and say, "Oh God, remember my brother. Remember my sister." If you can pick the phone. Don't wait for the deacons to do that. Pick the phone. Maybe see you God once pick the phone and call them and find out how are you doing. It's all well because we are a body. Some things you know we tend to leave it just everything to the pastor to the deacons and just well my job is to show up to church come go pay my tithing. No no no no no no. We are called to be each other's keeper. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to go into this story because I believe it's relevant to what we are saying now. And if you can give me St. John chapter 8, we will go through it together. Amen. Praise God. So Jesus went into the Mount of Olives. Yes, excuse me. This is verse one. It says, "Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives." If you study the life of Jesus, I believe that the mountain place was Jesus's prayer closet. Because if you look at Luke 6:12, it says, "And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer." Matthew 14 23. And when he had sent away the multitudes, he went up into a mountain apart to pray. So in this scene to me it looks like Jesus has spent the night in prayer and then going to verse two. And early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them. So I believe that Jesus had now come freshly anointed being in prayer all night. Now he comes to church with the anointing fresh upon him and now he's ready to teach. Now we're going to go through this carefully because there's a lot that's happening in this few verses that we're going to read. So Jesus is in church teaching. Just imagine like a scenery like this. And verse three, and the scribes and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, they said unto him, "Master, this woman was taken in adultery in the very act." Can you imagine? To me, these were the message believers of that day, the scribes and the Pharisees. These guys were very religious yet rude and zero respect for church order. Could you imagine Jesus is preaching &gt;&gt; anointed and suddenly he budge in these fellows and completely interrupt the service &gt;&gt; and they say to him, "Master, this woman was caught in adultery." Verse five. This is what those guys would say today. The same Pharisees. I'm going to demonstrate it so that I can get my point across. Verse five. Now, Brother Brham, brother Brham in the message, let's say in the in the message, the spoken word is the original seed preached in 1962 and said A, B, C, and D. These are the kind of things that you'd hear today. The prophet said da da da da da because they were quick to quote the prophet, right? Verse five. And Moses, now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be what? Stoned. But what sayest thou? Now the question is which law? And where was the man that had committed adultery with this woman? Because as you know, it takes two to tangle. I want to read the scripture that they thought they were referring to in Deuteronomy chapter 22:2. Let's hear what it says. If a man be found lying with a woman, this woman here was not lying alone. If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them, not one, both of them die. both the man that lay with the woman and the woman. So shall thou put evil from Israel. But you know it's amazing that these guys brought the woman but where was the man? That's the question. Where was he? And you see our intentions. The Bible says that the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword, a discern of the thoughts and the intents of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Okay. In verse six, this they said tempting him that they might have sorry that they might have to accuse him. So the motive and the intent was evil. But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. Praise God. We must never use the word for wrong objectives because God sees the hearts. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It will always always backfire. You know, if you have the wrong intention and we want to take the word to prove your point or do whatever, as long as your attitude, your objective is wrong, you will never get anywhere. Praise God. And this is exactly what these guys were doing. Amen. So verse seven, so when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said unto them, he that is without sin among you, let him cast first cast a stone at her. I like that. You notice Jesus did not even quote a single scripture. He said, you know what? Okay. If you have not sinned, go ahead. I give you the green light. Throw the first stone. And he waited. I'm sure he waited. We don't need to argue and get into debates with anybody. I don't believe in arguing and debating to prove anything. Jesus did not do it as we can see. So neither should we as Christians get into debates and arguments. Brother Brham says this in the message. We are going to continue with the eight verse but I want to read this quote. He says, "Oh, how we need in Jeffersonville is thousands of lived voices. The thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness, purity, undefiled lives walking around in the earth without a blemish." Yes, sir. Real Christians, that's a thunder against the enemy. Amen. The devil don't care how loud you can holler. The devil doesn't care how much you can jump and how much you can do this or shout. But what hurts the devil is to see is to is to see that sanctified holy consecrated life &gt;&gt; to God. Amen. Say anything to him. Call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on. Oh my. That throws him away. That's the thunder that shakes the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Jesus stooped down. Thank you. So after he has given them the green light, he stoops down again and begins to write. And they which heard it, verse 9, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last. And Jesus was left alone. and the woman standing in the midst. As we can see, Jesus did not even raise his voice. As we can see, he did not go and look for quotes. As we can see, he really didn't do much speaking. But there's a way God knows how to get to our conscience because He sees our hearts and he did things in such a way that once he was done their conscience bore record against them. Well, they may not have been guilty of adultery, but what about maybe backbiting? They may not have been guilty of adultery, but maybe one had stole the night before. Is that right? You know, there are so many things that we can do as individuals and make the outside look so good, so holy that when people look at us, they say, "Wow, he or she looks like a real nice person, like a real Christian." But do you know that inside of that can be full of like Jesus says they're full of dead men's bones, corrupt, evil thoughts, evil intentions. You know, there are things that we can hide, but the Holy Spirit knows how to get to what's inside of our hearts. Praise God. And this was exactly what happened here. So the word came to strip away everything that looked like, you know, that was hidden. And let me say this, every one of us here today, we have so many accusers against us. I don't necessarily mean physical accusers. Maybe some of us are fighting the accuser of guilt and shame. It could be complexes of the past that constantly keep hounding and pounding at you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It could be the accuser of cancer, depression, oppression, broken relationships. These are some of the accusers many of us deal with. And we are constantly being bombarded with these things because the Bible tells us that Satan, he is what? The accuser of the brethren. &gt;&gt; That spirit does not come from God. And so any Christian should never be found with that kind of a spirit on them. Praise God. Because Satan, that's his job, is to constantly accuse and make the believer feel guilty, worthless. And some of us, we can't seem to get over these things because we allow the devil to play with our minds. But I'm here to remind you today that there is one who can change that circumstance for you. Amen. No matter what you're going through, Jesus is here to set you free. &gt;&gt; And when all is said and done, it's just going to be you and him. And like Jesus said, where are thine accusers? Hallelujah. Where are your accusers? The word we've like on this weekend, we heard powerful messages. Now many of us have to go back and face the reality. &gt;&gt; You know when the anointing is here, you can feel great. But guess what? God has ordained it that we must go back to the battlefield &gt;&gt; and face the enemy. &gt;&gt; And that's where now you need to know where you stand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I want to tell you that like Jesus said, I will never leave you, neither will I forsake you, for I will be with you even in you. &gt;&gt; So when he sends us, he goes in us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. And when Jesus lifted up himself and saw none but the woman, he said unto her,"Woman, where are thine accusers? Where are they? Hath no man condemned thee?" She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. will go and sin no more. &gt;&gt; That is our God. That is our savior. Brother Brham said this. He said at one point he thought that Jesus loved him and God was angry at him. You know, sometimes we walk around with this mentality that God is ready to strike us the moment we do something wrong. But no, it's not the case. Amen. Because the blood is still here to atone for our mistakes. I believe as long as the bride is still present on the earth, that mercy seat is still available. There's mercy. And so, let's now read verse 12. I like this. Then Jesus then spake Jesus again. In other words, now he's going to resume the service. He spake again. In other words, it's like saying, "Where were we?" Let's continue with the service now. And said unto them, saying, "I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." Amen. You know, Brother Brham told this story which I was really blessed with. And this is why I like our prophet because he was honest. He shared things which he wasn't ashamed of. And I believe that God allowed him to go through some things to be an example to us. Amen. And so I want to read this story in closing. I'm going to skim through a lot of it because of time, but this was where brother Brham met this old woman in the restaurant. And while there, he was condemning her in his heart. And this is what he says. He says, "Condemn no one. Love everybody." If you can't love from your heart, then Christ is not with you. Okay. Then he gives the background of the story. He says, "At Toledo, Ohio, I went into a into a restaurant that I had been eating at a little dunker place. Lovely, lovely little place. They were so nice. But that afternoon, they had closed up to go to Sunday school. And when they did, I had to cross to go across the street to a worldly little old place. And I walked in there. Okay. Going to skip. And sitting in a chair, here sat an elderly lady as old as my mother. 55, 58 years old. He gives an estimate. Okay, I'm going to jump. And there she was sitting, her poor flesh, flabby. She had that kind of an orchid looking manicure ever whatever you call it on her lips and a little bitty haircut like a man that fuzzed all up and there she was sitting with manicure all over her face and she was sitting there with two old men. one of them with a big old scarf around his neck and in June sitting there and he got up and was kind of drinking and she was drinking too and looking around. Amen. And I thought, now listen to what the prophet is saying. He's now confessing his thoughts. And I thought, "Oh God, why don't you just wipe away the thing off the map of the earth?" Sorry, off of the map. Why don't you look out here in these parks and these things and what goes on? And I thought, "Oh, God, I'm glad you took Sharon if it was your will." Now he's referring to his daughter who God took took off the scene. How can your holy righteousness stand it? Now you see the prophet's attitude. And I'm I'm sure many of us have been in this situation because you feel safe. You've crossed over. Look like your righteous indignation would fly out there and blow this place up. And then he says this, "And I heard the angel of the Lord said, "Come aside." Praise God. I'm so glad that God knows where to meet us. I walked over and when he got through with me, I felt like a different person. What are you condemning her for? This is the angel now. I said, look at that. the way she is. And then he says, "And I saw a vision, a world like this round, another world, but this world here, it had a rainbow around it. And that was the blood of Christ that protects the God's wrath. He couldn't look upon that. He would destroy it immediately." Then I thought like this. I sin myself although I didn't do that but I was a sinner anyhow and then the blood of Jesus acts to us like a bumper. Amen. So around this world is covered by the blood because remember that Jesus died for the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's why the prophet said that those people in the world can do all their wickedness, have their rock and roll parties, commit adultery, and seems like nothing is going on. You know why? He says because they are being protected by the blood. But there will come a day when that blood is going to be lifted. Praise God. I'm going to skip to wind this down. The prophet said um so he saw his sins how it act like a bumper says then he took his hand dipped it in his side took some blood and wrote across it and said pardoned this is his sins now threw it back in a sea of forgetfulness to remember it no more after I came out of it I walked over and sat down now he's going to the lady and he said how do you do ma'am She said, "Oh, hello." And I said, "If you'll pardon me, I'm Reverend William Brham, a minister." I said, "Lady," I just told her the story. I said, "I was standing there and I was condemning you and thinking, what a horrible thing. Maybe you've got children." She said, "I have." I said, "What caused the way to go wrong?" She begin to unfold a story to me that would ren the heart of anything. Do you see why we can't judge things on the surface? &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brhamy many times in the discernment, he would not just lay hands on people. That's why his ministry was different. He dealt with the root cause of problems. And we cannot just take quick decisions and condemn people. Sometimes people have complexes. That's why they are the way they are. Maybe their behavior is due to something that happened in their childhood. And until we understand these things, we are treading on dangerous grounds. So, brother Brham discovers by hearing her story, he comes to this conclusion that she was in a in in a pitiful condition. And you could see from this attitude of being judgmental, suddenly he realizes that I've made a horrible mistake. And I said, I was asking God, why didn't he just rake such off the earth? Now he's telling the lady this and here you are here with these two drunken men and you are drunk yourself and I said someday the blood of Jesus sorry the blood is holding God's wrath off from you. You are going to die one of these days and then you are a free moral agent now. You can reject or receive it. And I said, "But someday your soul is going beyond there where there's no mercy left. And if you die in your sins, you're already judged." Then he says this. You know what? That woman slipped down out of that seat there in that restaurant. We had a prayer meeting &gt;&gt; like you've never heard in your life and she came to Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So don't judge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Extend mercy. Extend grace because we are still on a journey. And until we make it in, we need the grace of God. Amen. May the Lord bless you. Let's stand to our feets. We'll have our song leader come if you don't mind. I just feel like singing this song as we close off. Nothing but the blood of Jesus. If it was not for his blood, none of us would be here today. And so as we sing this song, let's just remember this one thing. If there's one thing you're going to take tonight with you is that the blood of Jesus is still available tonight atoning for our sins, for our mistakes. And so I trust that no matter what has happened in your life, no matter what you're going through, [Music] just know that the accuser, which is Satan, he has already been defeated.
