you thank you and that'll be psalm 58 and i'll rest read one verse do you indeed speak righteousness or ye congregation do you judge uprightly or you sons of men amen our gracious father we thank you for the reading of the word and we ask your blessing upon this as we consider these things tonight in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you praise the lord i'm so happy to be in the house of the lord here again to give god glory you come to see that praise the lord hallelujah well we are going to begin tonight um studying in the wonderful message called this spoken word is the original seed this spoken word so tonight um we won't be very long because i'm just doing like the introduction a little bit of an introduction to it okay and then we will get into it uh starting more in depth next week god willing praise the lord hallelujah we we will look now to the word i wanted to comment but you know this is going out online so i'll leave that until afterwards brother branham is now praying our heavenly father as you said in your word if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men onto me and that is our purpose praise god see everybody talks about purpose but brother branham is making clear and the word is making clear that our chief purpose in natural life is to lift up the lord jesus christ to bring glory to his name to bring attention to him that people may look to him you remember in the wilderness when the people were sick they were poisoned they were snake bit and everything else uh moses made that uh that bronze carving or whatever of the serpent that was in the wilderness and he told them to look and live look and live you see what the serpent represented is sin dead on the cross when when satan satan actually was deceived in the sense that he was fooled he didn't realize when he was killing jesus he was really like a snake biting its own tail you see because death killed death right because he became sin meaning all the sins in the world past present future whatever he died for all of it so when satan think he's just killing him he killed all sin or brought an end to everything that's why paul kept saying if the princes of this world knew they would have not crucified the lord of glory because they would have realized what was happening amen hallelujah so our purpose in life is to lift him up before a dying generation of people just like moses did lifted up the serpent then tell him look and live look and be healed hallelujah but now we are pointing them back to the lord jesus christ and we are saying look to him and live everything you need is in him praise god and i'm so glad we serve this living god hallelujah praise the lord now we know that jesus christ is still he says this son of god nothing hasn't changed no matter how much time passed he is still the son of god you can't diminish his glory you can't take away from his accomplishments you can't do anything to lessen what what he did hallelujah praise god i'm so happy to know that praise god and now knowing that we know then that after this life is finished there will be another life on the other side hallelujah amen that will be so glorious that these toils of these few hours of life that we are passing through see will seem as nothing hallelujah amen see when you leave this old wretched body that you're living in and we cross over into the new body praise god and i'm so glad because the clarity of understanding that brings to not just me but to all of us uh uh on assurance uh a confidence in god that when we leave here when we come to our expiry date hallelujah as they say kick the can but when that can expires then it's thrown out but when we come to that time we're not worried because the bible tells us you are already before you actually expire or leave this body you already have an assurance by revelation that when we put off this mortal the prophet said by revelation you've already made contact with that theophany amen or you will not be seeing what you're seeing now for he said in that hour only the elect will see only the bride will be able to see and understand what god is doing so we already have made contact i know i made contact you have got to know for yourself whether you make contact with that that theophany out there amen you may not be able to explain it what it's like and all this type of stuff but you know that you have made a definite certain contact and something is speaking back to you something is revealing itself to you praise god hallelujah i won't get into all of that but the but the collectively all of the theophanies is really the holy spirit so you are only a part of that and that little part is your theophany but he the holy spirit is all of it praise god hallelujah so i'm thankful to god that we have blessed assurance we are not just here singing songs just to be heard that's why brother branham said if you're gonna sing or paul said it to sing with your understanding sing from your heart hallelujah don't just you know the singing songs just like it's a a matter of fault no it means something to me it's something in my soul that registers there there that causes me to know that i know i know that i know the devil doesn't come and tell me what i know i know what i know for myself by looking in the word of god something strikes me every time i look into this word hallelujah and i can't help see it seeing jesus christ lifted up before me every time i look into this word of god praise be to god hallelujah that is why it's not hard for me brother sister it's not hard for me whether there is two or there was ten thousand is this if it just brings the same kind of effect on my soul hallelujah because i just want to talk about jesus christ hallelujah i just want to talk about his grace i may talk about him but from various angles different ways approaching him but it's always him it's always about him and we thank god for that amen so we when this life is finished hallelujah and his trials of the road we are now passing through these sheds and shadows of life down here see what he's talking about is that this present state while you're living in this body passing through the earth here with all his troubles and trials it's just as david said yes i walk through the valley of the shadow another place you can find those quotes if you look there look it carefully he says it's just you're passing through the valley and you're having the shadows of death amen and that's what we are doing here because the devil can't really really kill us he can't really destroy us hallelujah he cannot do it whatsoever so the re the shadows of death that we are seeing now he says don't fear that i want fear if i pass through that valley i would have because all that is is a shadow but you know the devil that's a way of making shadows look so real hallelujah i've told it before i was a boy i woke up and i saw a man standing in the bedroom there and i was so scared i could not sleep until the sun came up and when the sun came up i found it was my father's pants hanging on the and his hat on the top of it you see so the devil has a way of using shadows and those shadows can appear so real to you but when the light comes you're able to recognize that you have needless fear for the bible says there there were they uh in fear amen when they need not fare when they fear not they need not to fear whatsoever or where there was no where no fear was there were they in fear where no fear was that's what the bible says so i thank god for that amen see passing through the valley of the shadows of that death because in their the testing ground hallelujah and isn't that right the testing ground is right here and sometimes you get tested right to your breaking point you think you're gonna die but it's just a shadow of death you're not going to die praise god you're just passing through the testing ground and god knows like paul said he knows exactly how much to test you right just exactly to bring you to that point and then he takes back his hand off so you can get some relief but by that time oh you feel so saved right praise god you know have you ever watched a robin uh taking a worm out from the ground god built them that way they know exactly how much tension to pull that worm so it don't break it doesn't escape and they just go like that they do it quick but that's what they're doing they're sensing the tension from that worm so they can pull the whole worm out and it doesn't break whatsoever and the bible is telling us the same thing that he will not tempt you or test you with some temptation you are not able to bear there's so much hidden under there that is telling you that he already knows each one of us he knows our breaking points some more than others and he know exactly how far to take you and every time he takes you there because he doesn't stop you grow a little stronger he pulls you a little more you grow a little stronger whatever but that's what this is all about we're just passing through the valley of the shadows of death praise the lord jesus hallelujah oh my we are now entering into an orbit thank god i'm in orbit i don't know about you but i'm in orbit i'm just moving and waiting praise god for that call to come from above the countdown is here praise the lord glory to god amen for soon there will come a time when god's time is fulfilled not man's time but god's time is fulfilled hallelujah see it is god's time and that great arm has held back the time for so long hallelujah well we know what that was because i we all misunderstood it when the angel raised his hands to heaven and said time shall be no more we thought it meant end of the world but we understand that it didn't mean the end of the world it was speaking about the end of the seven church ages time shall be no more praise god and so we we clearly see that that the time when god's time is fulfilled and he holds the time back for so long but finally he will let it go amen and when he does the church will move off from this earth hallelujah into space out yonder into a land where there is no sickness sorrow or old age or death and that's why we are gathered here today praise god i'm so thankful to god amen brother sister that there is a land we move out of here and we move to another land and it's a total opposite of this you see satan tries to copy cat and he try to get a reflection of the one that's there but that one is the one we're headed to oh praise god hallelujah amen do you know uh as i was uh looking into this i could clearly see how god used the prophets of malachi 4 revelation 10 7 whom we know as william marion branham the 20th century prophet god used him in the operation and manifestation of the gifts hallelujah to prove to us there is a land that you can't see there is a dimension here that you have not yet entered into but by these gifts he was proving to us only believe all things are possible when you leave here you go into that other dimension you go to that other land because look i'm seeing it i'm seeing it this is what's happening in that land i even crossed or was allowed to cross over and can't come back right here there is a land oh praise god i'm so glad there's a land beyond the river that we call a sweet forever amen and we'll only reach that shore by god's decree amen hallelujah and he did decree that you and i will be there because we are his germs we are his seed oh praise god let me not get into that oh praise god but more brothers we are the original amen and we come from god and that's why we are traveling back home to god see a lot of these things is happening right now but because we are in this flesh we're not conscious of it but it's taking place right now and we're in the middle of a great supernatural events are taking place around us amen glory to god hallelujah i'm so glad to know that this is not just bringing us together for something in vain but it has been proven to us to be the greatest reality in the world hallelujah now what i told you about the gifts and how he operated under the gifts and came back and gave us answers and now that's not you're not going to find this here but i'm telling you here and uh i know that that is where he is going and that's what he's saying that is proven to you over and over again that there is a greater reality you think this is reality but this reality so called your eyes and your mind will pass away but there is an unfailing reality of a living god that will not fail praise god cannot die can't pass away but will always be there for every one of us praise be to god hallelujah amen yes the greatest reality has ever been known hallelujah and to begin to know that greatest reality it is this that the son of god is not dead but he's alive praise god amen oh praise god that's the greatest reality for you to become aware of oh when you are aware that you he is not dead but he is alive praise god sometimes you go alone in your prayer room and uh my friends if you you because we're in this flesh sometimes you even get scared you say oh you're scared but you're in the presence of god yeah you your flesh in contact with the power of the holy spirit and the presence of the living god are you praying by your bed and you feel somebody sit down on the bed right now you listening to what you're saying my god i'm letting you know it's real my brothers my doubts are settled and i know the word of god is real not only the word written word but the living word it lives forevermore he's not dead they couldn't crucify him they couldn't burn him they couldn't bend him they couldn't bury him but he's alive here amen and he's with us praise the lord we come together like this to worship and to glorify the name of the lord and when we do that brother branham said whenever you begin to worship sing talk about the word in reality he says jesus draws near just like he did in ms he says you see always talk about him you want him always near you you always want him to be around you so think about him talk about him and when you start thinking about him talking about him he says jesus draws near oh thank god hallelujah amen amen praise god he's alive amen for he made the promises hallelujah and so he is alive among us forevermore amen because he is there to back up his promises to back up his word god's words are not empty words that go in the ear and disappear but god's words live on they live forever the words he said i speak their spirit and their life praise god now you go down that in your mind it's not just the bible is talking about you too their spirit beings and their life because they're part of his life amen praise god they can't fail they can't fall they can't you know they can't disappear and if i send them forth he said the word that i sent forth or speak he says it cannot return to me void first of all he just doesn't think about one of them not returning the word that i speak the words i speak they shall return to me they cannot return to me void hallelujah everyone is going to return he already knows that and he's saying when they come back they're not going to come back void or empty praise god i'm so thankful to god for that hallelujah that we are going to return fulfilling all the various uh purposes that he had in his mind for every one of us so we are trying them knowing this that there is a land praise god that there is another dimension as we spoke of on sunday like the prophet said is passing through the room right here it's just that you can't see it you can't feel it then he talks about a radio he said you have a radio you see he says they're picking that up now because by science they develop a crystal or something where they can tap into that not the places he mentioned like children breaking into god's toolbox and playing around hallelujah you see but there is a land there is another dimension and that's why he said a prophet is different to you you see you have to pray and pray or or dream before your conscience and subconscious can come together and then god can reveal or dream or give you something like a vision or something he says when the prophet is not like that a prophet comes with both already together and he's looking in this dimension and he's still looking in the other one and that's why he can scream out like that and tell you it's real it's right here right now he's in the building why he is seeing it amen he said oh he's going around the building now it's right praise god hallelujah that's what he said do you believe in other words believe him and wait and pray to god until the day he'll open your eyes that you'll be able to see it but you know that day is coming you know it's already in the bible telling you that day is coming when you and i are going to start seeing to that land before we break over on the other side you remember when jesus went and bring them saints out from that were imprisoned there and brought them out of there and put that and they were in jerusalem and what did the bible say they started to see those saints hallelujah they started to see them praise be to god and i'm telling you right now before we break out into the event let's say of the rapture and grace of god some of us are to rub our eyes am i seeing right but how do i know that man is abraham you see just the same way that you know this word of god is right and he is a part of that word so when you see him you don't have to have a description of him before you see him because you know the word and because you know the word the moment you see any one of them you're going to know them praise god it's all by revelation and inspiration brother sister we are in a tremendous time of this message and i want to say god has blessed us to a great extent kind of being almost like a head of the pack and so it makes us having to be careful of what we say and how we say it praise the lord oh praise god forevermore how wonderful to know i am so glad that god gave us a prophet the prophet and that man faithfully patiently with the grace and love of god in his heart constantly waving that wave sheep trying to tell us there's another realm this is not this just this life or when this life is over it's all done and gone no there is another land there's another place we go to oh one has paid the price for you to travel and go there your price is paid you don't have to worry just commit yourself repent of your sins turn from your wicked ways come to jesus christ know him in the power of his resurrection oh my what are an assurance it gives to the soul of the christian oh my friends this great hour is now approaching us we see that time coming before us lord and our hearts born within us why because he's talking with us along the way not physically but he's doing the same thing just as we talking about the word he comes with us and he talks to our hearts and our hearts begin to burn along the way praise god why we are hearts born because we want to make ready hallelujah praise god we want to make ready praise god hallelujah and as we make ready then what happens one by one we go down that lane amen i use the other word that he loves and sings one by one we gain the portal amen praise god hallelujah dare to dwell with the immortals oh praise god hallelujah oh my lord bring our hearts so we understand oh god bring sinners even to repentance bring the sick people and let them be healed bring others so that they may come to the knowledge of god oh hallelujah oh god and then bless them saints and bind their hearts together i believe that's what he's doing right now amen praise god hallelujah oh and may them ministering brethren who maybe once used to misunderstand may they understand now hallelujah he was saying that then but i am repeating his words at the same time i'm saying the same thing right now because i know what it means a lot of people misunderstood because they hadn't come to that place yet and it seems like a a lot of ministers are starting to come to that place and recognize what god is doing hallelujah and what god is manifesting by the opening of the word of god hallelujah amen and may they now these ministering brethren may they who once misunderstood let them understand now lord so that your church might be prepared hallelujah praise the name of the living god amen now my beloved brethren everything that i have said and i have done i have said it from my heart and i want you to know i did it for a purpose you remember i always use a quote when he goes back unveiling of the of out of my unveiling of god i think it's page seven where he says the things i have said and i have done he used the same words but then he went on further i purposely said it and did it and then he gave the reason why that some may go out right you know some may get wandering some maybe left confused other ones might just you know come in and so on he said clearly he said but i did it all for a purpose amen hallelujah and what this is all about is by god's help to explain to you from the bible that purpose and why i have done it amen praise the lord so that is really what we are going to be studying here in the weeks to come praise the lord why god used him in that way now he said you might disagree with me right and uh because you see you have a right to disagree with me as you may see it different amen hallelujah oh my friends that's the place we we have got to come to that people have a right to disagree and they have a right to disagree with you and with me even even though it's the word of god you're quoting to them even though you're telling them the word of god don't get upset don't get mad they have a right to disagree because especially if they're not seeing it yet what are you going to be fighting up and trying to by argumentation by logic by reasoning by man's will trying to convince them it's the holy spirit's job all you need to do is bring the love of god in your heart the understanding the patience the temperance and all these various fortunes with you around them and let the spirit of god use that to create an atmosphere around them that he could drop into and then speak into their hearts praise the lord and bring about it praise the lord hallelujah amen and friends this i will be ending here in a few minutes i want you to know praise the lord let me back up here a bit praise the lord now no matter see i have never had a bad feeling against anyone i can't say that but brother branham could say that at the time we all had to repent and confess and lay those things down i can say at this time i don't have any bad feelings against anyone because i've come to the understanding of the word of god and clean out myself hallelujah not with cenapods but with the savior spots save you you want to put it that way no matter if they disagreed with me as far as the east is from the west i still love them and as long as i have the spirit of god in me i'll always love his people no matter what they do hallelujah praise god in other words you're looking right at them and you know what they're doing is wrong but it says don't matter what they do i still love them the old thing back in all pentecost and even in the early days of the message a brother or sister do something and you distance yourself from them now it's a different matter if they distance themselves from you because the devil is going to play on their mind and tell them that that you want nothing to do with them because he'd done this and she done that and the other one done this and the other one done that but they don't understand the grace of god just like how god looks on things with no impartiality that spirit starts coming on you that you don't have no partiality you don't condone wrong but you don't just uh you know get away from people and as they're all teaching of separate yourself mean to they in the same restaurant and you go on to the opposite side of the wall because you want nothing to do with them oh it's nothing of the kind amen praise god now that would be we now have the opportunity now to embrace we have the opportunity now to exercise and manifest their love of god the 11th commandment is now in force we under the spirit of charity we under the inspiration of the capstone hallelujah now doesn't mean you're compromising when you do that that's just a legalistic spirit praise god you listen paul said even if we got to reach down our hands and pluck them like a brand from the burning you know what he's saying there if you got to reach your hand sometimes almost in the pit of hell to pull them out hallelujah and you may get some burns too when you're trying to pull them out because people looking on wouldn't understand what you're doing and they're going to bring all kinds of accusations against you you know one time a brother was in a bar i'm not telling you to go to a bar but they happened to have a christmas party at the end and he was the administrator of the hospital and the employees said come on you have to come but then he's a preacher they know he doesn't drink he doesn't smoke on this but he said but you must come and so and so and he thought about it and he decided he was going to go and when he went there he asked them for what we call a cream soda uh any of you know what's a cream soda okay well you know that it's clear it looks like vodka and sure enough by the next day the rumor had gone around the first time i've seen this man take a good drink i was they i passed there and i saw with these eyes right through the glass of the of the bar room i saw him put that glass too and he took the whole thing done in one shot like an experienced drinker it's not till later he had to explain to them it wasn't vodka it was just a cream soda but the devil will take anything like that to burn you is that what i mean he going to a bar room because he said now they really want me to be there to give him an opportunity to be able to witness to some of them like that right but while he's in there he pick up some burns so that's what i'm saying that uh sometimes we have to bear the reproach for his name right that way i remember talking to some fisherman and uh their girlfriends were prostitutes of the red light district and all like that but god led me to witness to them they're cursing me swearing while i'm witnessing and and then when the others don't realize it two of them slip away and talking to me quietly in the background you see and as i've said i've left the sea some of them got married raised families and they were even stricter than the regular dad because they knew life they knew what life is all about and so they just stood their ground but some and of course i got all kinds of calls all kinds of names at that particular time because nobody realized what it was you're trying to accomplish amen praise god that's as much as saying the scripture just came to me that he's a friend of sinners he's a friend of simmers and surely of course that's they were speaking the truth and the prophet saying the truth not knowing it he was a friend of sinners and that's what he came to do is to save sinners amen no matter what they do or no matter how they may treat me oh stop right there oh my goodness it's one thing what they're doing and and that some of us may put up with well when it comes to the point of how they treat me hey that's another matter now oh they're attacking your persona you're attacking you personally so you got to defend yourself you got to get your arms up and ready to do battle but no that's not what the prophet said he said no matter how they treat me that won't have not anything to do with it because i still love them what is saying there without saying it is that that person talking to him like that and treating him like that they have to have a reason and we're going to take it from the low end it could be they're having a bad day i've come in cases where it end up with me having to pray with the person because then i find out from talking they had a problem at home before they came to work amen and they won't just go out and tell anybody like that but just god just made them treat me like that so i could be the one to under get that quietly pray about it and it stays right there oh praise god but we serve a living god a wise god he knows what he is doing so we place our lies in his hands and let him lead us and guide us amen you know sometimes he says one time there was a man named moses and then people were constantly as in our southern expression you may say or aggravating him now but he in other words a nice way he's saying even the preachers go through that the preacher is there trying to preach the truth to them and then the very people that he's preaching to turn around and aggravating him why why are they how are they aggravating him every time they're with a murmur or with some complaint or something else hallelujah and when god said separate yourself from them moses i'm going to start a new nation moses threw himself in the path he says no lord take me not the people take me save them that was the spirit of christ in moses that's the spirit of christ that should be in us for the glory of god no matter how much someone would disagree with me if he doesn't feel the way that way then if a believer doesn't feel that way then they are lacking of christ see i was in a chicago meeting with a colored man that was sitting up there and he kept saying i want to see dr branham i want to see dr branham he had a great big hat on he had a great big cross on his chest it was eight to ten inches long and wide and he had robes dressed up very strange had a lot of funny rings and beads and so forth hanging on his chest and so i told brother baxter i said brother braxter bring him in the room i'll see him and he sat down with me and said shall i regard you as father branham reverend branham or elder branham whatever you want me to regard you as that is what i'll call you and i just said to him if you love me call me just call me your brother amen and if we love him let's call him brother as we do brother branham and gave me this title amen and he in respects did so i take a few lines to write on a paper all the titles and the names of that he had but all he had to call me was brother branham he told me that he was interested he was really interested in his church and the things of god and he's left something with me that i shall never forget and i always remember it he said brother branham i'm interested in only one race hallelujah he said the human race and that's all i'm interested in praise the name of the lord he says i got a right there from my chair and said brother let's shake hands together glory to god hallelujah amen the human race to every creed every nation every color every person christ died for them and that should be our interest this morning hallelujah that's our interest praise god this church has always functioned that way because that is our interest we're not concerned with this or that but to look to god's word hallelujah amen in closing he said i want to ask you he's talking about when he's going to start speaking on the subject i want you to bring with you your notebooks hallelujah and i want to do the same now bring your notebooks and then you who have tape recorders now i could say ipads or whatever and get them put them take them and put them in your home sit down with an open heart get relaxed if you are not say lord relax me and just relax now hallelujah i'm going to listen to your word and then when you listen and you catch something turn the recorder off and go find that scripture go to the bible jesus say it says they are they that testify of me hallelujah and then look through the scripture and see if what you heard all that you heard if that was right that's the way and that's the thing we ought to do so in the the days ahead as we go forward in this study i want you to walk with your notebook walk with your ipad wherever you have to take notes and god will strike your heart amen even things that i didn't verbally say it's going to be coming off like that so you just make a note of it because that maybe is for you might not be for me but it might be for you praise the lord and you say oh i'm going to remember it but i know from experience that sometimes when god sends something past my mind if i don't make a note and i'm not talking now that i getting up there in age i'm talking even when you're young the devil want to pick that thing away from you so you once you write it down it's there so even if you forgot it's there so so god gives you an inspiration god gives you a thought
