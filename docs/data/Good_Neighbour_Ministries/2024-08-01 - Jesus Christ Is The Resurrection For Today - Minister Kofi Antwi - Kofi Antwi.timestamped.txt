[16:36] then you become certain of God then you
[16:39] will know what you are talking about may
[16:42] the Lord bless each and every one of you
[16:45] I love you those that will be watching
[16:48] me in line you'll hear the testimony
[16:52] about what God has done for me and I
[16:57] promise the Lord wherever I stand in
[17:00] this world I will testify of it because
[17:05] I can't keep it to
[17:07] myself here is the first place the Lord
[17:11] want me to share because he brought me
[17:15] here to know
[17:18] him and always here will be my

[17:44] we brother Phillip come and lead us in
[17:50] prayer I feel the spirit of God already
[18:22] praise God Heavenly most gracious
[18:25] Eternal God when we live here we going
[18:28] to say not our hasand within us as he
[18:32] spoke to us we thank you and we love you

[18:45] 10 and the second one will be
[18:48] Hebrews
[18:50] 138 the third scripture will be John

[19:03] me and may the Lord bless everyone of
[19:07] you for reading those
[19:10] scriptures and for you being here you
[19:14] are blessed to be here tonight to hear
[19:17] it not just from tape but you hearing it
[19:24] alive because God has done something
[19:28] that
[19:29] even I am

[19:58] the Lord of host is with us the god of
[20:03] Jacob is our refuge
[20:07] Sila let's turn to Hebrews
[20:12] 138 we all know it by our lips Jesus
[20:15] Christ is the same
[20:18] yesterday today and
[20:23] forever
[20:24] okay if you have read that then you tend
[20:28] to
[20:29] this is my main
[20:32] scripture but because while I'll be
[20:35] talking I'll be using those things in
[20:37] those scriptures that's why I let us
[20:39] read that but this is my main
[20:43] scripture then said Mara unto Jesus
[20:48] Lord if thou had been here my brother
[20:54] had not
[20:55] died but I know that even now whatsoever
[21:02] thou will ask of
[21:05] God God will give it thee Jesus said
[21:11] unto her thy brother shall rise again
[21:17] Mar said unto
[21:20] him I know that he shall rise again in
[21:26] the resurrection at the last day he was
[21:31] putting it in
[21:33] future Jesus said unto her I am the
[21:40] resurrection and the life he
[21:46] that he that believe in me though he
[21:52] were dead yet shall he live and what so
[21:58] whoever believeth
[22:01] and and believe in me shall never die
[22:07] believest thou
[22:09] this he said unto him yeah Lord I
[22:14] believe that thou are the Christ the son
[22:20] of the the Son of God which should come
[22:26] into the world
[22:29] please be
[22:35] seated you know and I
[22:40] know and as I
[22:42] said Jesus Christ my topic is Jesus
[22:46] Christ
[22:49] today is the
[22:52] resurrection not until you know
[22:57] him today
[22:59] as a resurrection you know
[23:04] nothing because when it comes to the
[23:07] letter you may know him in the letter
[23:11] you may know
[23:12] him in the form of brother Braham
[23:16] written
[23:19] where
[23:20] but not
[23:22] until he
[23:25] himself has come out
[23:29] from the pages of the
[23:32] book and begin to speak with you talk
[23:35] with you for you to
[23:37] know that he is the resurrection today
[23:41] he is the message today he is the one
[23:44] that you bowing you doing everything to
[23:48] today then you don't know
[23:50] nothing I don't care what you tell me
[23:53] then you don't know
[23:55] nothing brothers and sisters

[24:00] knew I was so
[24:03] sick and the
[24:05] sickness wasn't something joke since I'm
[24:10] born and I came to this world I never
[24:13] faced that
[24:15] challenge it was so
[24:19] serious
[24:20] that I don't even know how to describe
[24:26] it because i f before the last Sunday I

[35:04] hand and punch the
[35:08] beell and I'm seeing the caner because
[35:11] the door is open a little bit and I'm
[35:14] watching them and all I could do is to
[35:17] lay on the
[35:18] bed and inside
[35:21] me the only thing I wanted was other
[35:27] brother Braham
[35:28] message or Christian
[35:30] song or my pastor preaching to
[35:35] me standing there preaching to me but
[35:38] there was none
[35:40] there
[35:42] so all I could do was what I have taken
[35:49] inside for the whole of my time being
[35:52] the house of the Lord I begin to chew it
[35:56] in the inside
[35:58] quiet and I begin to thank the Lord I
[36:02] begin
[36:03] [Music]
[36:04] to pray for even
[36:08] those that they were bringing so many
[36:11] people in
[36:13] Midnight people were coming they were on
[36:16] the uh uh hallway they were laying the
[36:19] people on the bed side by side andwhere
[36:23] so I my heart was even even though I'm
[36:27] going through pain I started to pray for
[36:29] them I wasn't worried about myself no
[36:33] more I said Lord if it is time for me to
[36:37] go so be it but what I was it paying me
[36:43] was I'm going to miss all of
[36:46] you I will not see you Joshua your
[36:49] little
[36:51] daughter I was thinking about her how I
[36:53] used to pray with her h brother Ian son
[36:58] brother Philip son how I used to tease
[37:02] them to help to help me keep the

[37:19] the
[37:20] Pew I really miss

[37:28] but anyway in the beginning why the
[37:32] thing started I told my wife right away

[37:39] know our pastor will know the deacons
[37:41] will know the the board will know and it
[37:45] will pass on to you
[37:47] congregations and the prayer meeting
[37:50] Believers will know and the message will
[37:53] pass out so that you pray for
[37:56] me so so I went through that night so

[1:04:39] heart
[1:04:41] prayers that you can search yourself do
[1:04:44] you really love
[1:04:47] him do you really are you really to give
[1:04:50] all to
[1:04:52] him when you were in pain
[1:04:57] he will be there at that time to see you
[1:05:03] and he will tell
[1:05:05] you
[1:05:07] son I am with
[1:05:09] you even though I know what you are
[1:05:12] going through but I am with you he can
[1:05:16] appear to you in the form of a woman
[1:05:20] being sitting down
[1:05:22] there he can appear to you in many form
[1:05:28] this is not the first time I have seen
[1:05:29] the Lord but this time he came sat down
[1:05:34] in the chair and talking with
[1:05:37] me I have seen
[1:05:40] it God is my
[1:05:44] witness God of brother Abraham is my
[1:05:49] witness then I begin to understand when
[1:05:53] brother brah is preaching
[1:05:56] and he said the angel of the Lord is
[1:06:00] here he's sitting right here the pillow
[1:06:03] fire is moving right here he said I'm
[1:06:06] waiting for the angel of the
[1:06:08] Lord what do you think when when he say
[1:06:12] he's here he is seeing
[1:06:16] him like as Pastor Danny is sitting down
[1:06:19] there but the congregation were not
[1:06:21] seeing
[1:06:23] him brothers and sisters
[1:06:26] let us pour our heart you sinner
[1:06:30] watching me on the
[1:06:32] line Jesus Christ the resurrection today
[1:06:37] do you want
[1:06:39] him then come and
[1:06:41] repent Good Neighbor here there's water
[1:06:46] here we will baptize you in the name of
[1:06:49] the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as Acts
[1:06:52] 2:38
[1:06:53] said and if you
[1:06:56] believe I challenge
[1:06:58] you your life will never be the same
[1:07:02] because the God I'm talking is not just
[1:07:05] God hidden in the book form only but the
[1:07:09] God who is reality if he appear to
[1:07:13] Moses if he appear to William
[1:07:17] Braham you if you believe him and Obey
[1:07:22] him and if you are his son or his
[1:07:25] daughter he can appear to
[1:07:29] you because you may say kof is lying
[1:07:33] Matthew 58 what the does the scripture
[1:07:36] said blessed are the pure in heart for
[1:07:41] they shall see
[1:07:42] who
[1:07:45] God God is real like that but the
[1:07:49] churches has pushed him
[1:07:54] out and they are just most of them are
[1:07:57] worshiping imagination God in their
[1:08:03] mind that won't work you need God on the
[1:08:08] skin
[1:08:11] on may the Lord bless
[1:08:15] you may the Lord you are sitting here
[1:08:20] tonight you that are
[1:08:22] watching may the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] bless
[1:08:27] you if you are a Believer and you are
[1:08:31] backslider you love to stay
[1:08:35] home this is not time to stay home
[1:08:38] brother this is not time to stay home
[1:08:41] sister come to the house of the Lord
[1:08:44] receive the
[1:08:46] word the word that is coming from the
[1:08:49] pulpit is not a man
[1:08:53] speaking every single one of us that is
[1:08:56] speaking here God is hiding on the
[1:09:02] skreen you may
[1:09:04] think is the person
[1:09:08] speaking no we don't have our own mind
[1:09:13] to
[1:09:14] speak we have the mind of Christ and the
[1:09:17] mind of Christ is his word and his word
[1:09:21] is in us so when we stand in the pulpit
[1:09:25] that word begin to come
[1:09:27] out and when that word is coming out is

[1:15:04] living in the days where Jesus Christ is
[1:15:09] still the same yesterday today and

[1:15:15] difference um when you've really truly
[1:15:18] experience the Lord and you come to a
[1:15:21] place where you are um at the point like
[1:15:27] our brother was where he was at the

[1:15:53] know that we know until you come to that
[1:15:58] place where you've got that kind of a
[1:16:01] relationship then you really need to
[1:16:04] search and check
[1:16:06] yourself to find if you're really
[1:16:10] walking with the Lord Jesus or if you're
[1:16:13] just you know a church member somebody
[1:16:17] claiming to be a Christian but this is
[1:16:19] the hour where God is going to show
[1:16:22] himself he's going to vindicate for
[1:16:24] himself self and you are going to know
[1:16:27] like our brother said you'll know that
[1:16:31] he's a
[1:16:32] reality and he will come in the time of
[1:16:38] absolute desperation amen praise
