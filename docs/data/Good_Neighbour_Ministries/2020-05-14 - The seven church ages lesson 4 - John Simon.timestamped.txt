[0:05] [Music]
[0:18] evening dear friends it's good to be
[0:22] here again may the Lord bless you real
[0:27] good let us pray
[0:30] our gracious God our Heavenly Father we
[0:34] ask thy blessing upon this broadcast
[0:38] tonight
[0:39] bless each one that is tuned in and made
[0:45] a great Holy Spirit descend upon the
[0:49] word and give us a clear understanding
[0:53] father we pray this and we believe this
[0:57] and we trust in your your wonderful
[1:01] great presence in Jesus name Amen and
[1:06] amen I'm reading tonight from the book
[1:12] of Revelation chapter 1 verse 4 to 6 and
[1:21] my subject is the salutation or greeting
[1:30] John to the seven churches which are in
[1:33] Asia grace be unto you and peace from
[1:38] him which is which was and which is to
[1:44] come and from the seven spirits which
[1:48] are before his throne and from Jesus
[1:53] Christ who is the faithful witness and
[1:57] the first begotten of the Dead and the
[2:00] Prince of the kings of the earth unto
[2:05] him that loved us and washed us from our
[2:10] sins in his own blood and had made us
[2:14] kings and priests unto God and his
[2:18] father to him be
[2:21] Lori and Dominion forever and ever amen
[2:27] praise God the Sanitation now to the
[2:35] seven churches which are in Asia this
[2:39] does not mean all of Asia but this spoke
[2:45] of Asia Minor
[2:48] it spoke particularly of Asia Minor and
[2:52] actually Asia Minor is it's about the
[2:58] size of the state of Indiana and these
[3:05] seven churches were identified by God
[3:12] because of their individual
[3:16] characteristics every church has its own
[3:20] character its own church life and
[3:24] because of this difference in nature God
[3:30] had chosen these seven churches so as to
[3:36] be a picture of the seven ages that were
[3:43] to come and that the character of each
[3:48] Church describes and gives us a
[3:53] foreshadow of what the character and
[3:57] nature of these seven ages were going to
[4:02] be now the seven spirits John speaks off
[4:09] hair in the Bible they represent seven
[4:15] portions of the Holy Spirit Himself that
[4:20] will rest upon seven men seven
[4:26] messengers each one to a church age and
[4:34] the Spirit of God that portion of the
[4:37] Spirit of God that would be with them
[4:40] and working through them will provide
[4:46] the wisdom power texture and character
[4:51] for their entire ministries suited to
[4:58] the age in which they live now as we
[5:04] read further in this text it says grace
[5:13] beyond to you and peace from him which
[5:19] was him which was amen him which is to
[5:26] come and from the seven spirits of God
[5:30] now listen to these expressions again
[5:35] him which is him which was and he that
[5:42] is to come the faithful witness the
[5:47] firstborn from among the dead Prince of
[5:53] the kings of the earth the Alpha and
[5:59] Omega they are mighty these are all
[6:07] titles and descriptions of one and the
[6:13] same person who is none other than the
[6:18] Lord Jesus Christ himself did he's the
[6:25] one that washed us and cleansed us in
[6:29] his own blood
[6:31] thanks be to God for the washing and
[6:34] cleansing of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[6:38] Christ
[6:39] now the Spirit of God is as setting
[6:43] forth that first in or
[6:47] to point us to the supreme deity of the
[6:54] person of Jesus Christ and to reveal to
[7:01] us the Godhead as being one God now we
[7:08] know today there is a gross error in the
[7:13] land the gross error of the doctrine of
[7:18] the Trinity and their teaching is that
[7:26] there are three gods instead of one but
[7:32] this revelation was given to John by the
[7:38] Lord Jesus Christ himself to establish
[7:44] without any shadow of doubt of who was
[7:49] speaking and also to give us a clear
[7:54] revelation of the Godhead
[7:59] it is Jesus all it is Jesus himself who
[8:04] corrects the error it is not that there
[8:08] are three gods my friends but one God
[8:12] with three offices there is one God with
[8:18] three titles Father Son and Holy Ghost
[8:25] now this mighty revelation is what the
[8:29] early church had and it gave them
[8:33] prevailing power under the jurisdiction
[8:37] the leadership the guidance of the Holy
[8:41] Spirit as he took them into the truth of
[8:45] the word of God and then vindicated that
[8:49] truth thanks be to God this is what he
[8:53] did and so we we
[8:56] a restoration of this mighty revelation
[9:03] that God gave to these apostles that
[9:06] this person this one that they had
[9:10] walked with with all those years was not
[9:14] just on anybody but he was him which was
[9:19] which is which is to come the Lord God
[9:23] Almighty and his name is none other than
[9:27] the Lord Jesus Christ also along with
[9:32] the name of Jesus they we need to have
[9:38] the restoration of the correct formula
[9:43] for the baptism in water or water
[9:47] baptism we need to correct the correct
[9:50] formula the correct means of doing it
[9:54] according to this Bible no I know that
[10:00] modern teachers modern theologians
[10:06] seminarians they will not agree with
[10:09] what I'm saying here certainly not but
[10:15] here is what was written in a certain
[10:17] Christians magazine from which I quote
[10:22] that the teaching on the Trinity is at
[10:27] the very heart and core of the Old
[10:30] Testament it is every width as much at
[10:36] the heart and core of the New Testament
[10:41] the New Testament is just as much
[10:44] opposed as the Old Testament is to the
[10:49] thought that there are more gods than
[10:54] one yet the New Testament with equal
[11:00] clearness teaches us that the father is
[11:03] God this son is God and that the Holy
[11:09] See
[11:09] it is God and the three are not three
[11:18] aspects of the same person but three
[11:23] persons let me repeat that again not
[11:28] three aspects of the same person but
[11:32] three persons standing in truly a truly
[11:39] personal relationship one to another and
[11:44] there we have the great doctrine of the
[11:48] three persons but one god it's worthless
[11:53] States God according to the Bible is not
[11:59] just one person but he is three persons
[12:06] in one God that is the great mystery of
[12:12] the Trinity and may say it surely is how
[12:18] can three persons being one God not only
[12:24] is there no scripture no Bible anywhere
[12:29] for that but it even displays lack of
[12:35] proper and intelligent reasoning three
[12:40] persons though identical in substance
[12:46] almost Swiss of one substance the Greek
[12:54] three persons different from each other
[13:00] yet one God that if that don't make
[13:06] three God's language has lost its
[13:10] meaning entirely in the light of what
[13:15] I've just coated I want you to listen
[13:18] not to my words but
[13:22] so this picture as I go over it again
[13:27] Jesus Christ get this revelation to John
[13:31] and he is speaking this is the Lord
[13:34] Himself speaking to John and telling
[13:38] John who he was I am Alpha and Omega the
[13:48] beginning and the end said the Lord
[13:55] which is which was and which is to come
[14:02] the Almighty this is Jesus speaking this
[14:08] is the mighty God in Christ speaking
[14:12] that he is Alpha Omega the beginning and
[14:16] the end I am the Lord God Almighty this
[14:22] is the voice of God Jesus Christ
[14:24] speaking only believe all things are
[14:28] possible
[14:29] yes sir I tell you this is nothing less
[14:34] than deity speaking this was not Jesus
[14:39] Christ was not just a man Jesus Christ
[14:44] was not just a holy prophet he was God
[14:50] their one God the Almighty God that
[14:54] formed himself or placed himself in
[14:57] flesh but for that day and for all time
[15:01] this is not just that a man that was
[15:04] speaking but it was God that was
[15:07] speaking and declaring himself through
[15:10] the man Christ Jesus it is not of course
[15:16] a revelation of three gods but it is a
[15:22] revelation of one God they Almighty God
[15:26] making himself known now for your
[15:32] inspiration
[15:34] they never believed in three gods in the
[15:39] time of the Vedic beginning of the
[15:42] church we cannot find anywhere in the
[15:48] scripture that form of belief in the
[15:54] Word of God we cannot find that kind of
[15:59] a belief among all the Apostles from
[16:03] Peter to Paul to John to Polycarp and
[16:08] those who just left the scene none of
[16:11] them believed in such a thing whatsoever
[16:17] now it was after their bus stomach age
[16:22] that this theory of the Trinity came
[16:26] into being and became an issue at the
[16:34] council the Nicene Council I believe it
[16:39] was 325 a.d it was this doctrine of the
[16:47] trinity became an issue and created a
[16:53] split in the church at that particular
[16:57] time because the split went to extremes
[17:02] one God or three gods and so there
[17:08] became a split and the side that
[17:12] believed or those that believed in three
[17:15] cards there prevailed and that was
[17:21] handed down as the preeminent doctrine
[17:26] and was propagated propagated and
[17:29] pressed upon people brought in by those
[17:33] dark ages I spoke of some time ago and
[17:36] so that doctrine prevailed even to this
[17:41] very day and it prevailed
[17:45] even amongst the
[17:47] Protestants to this very day but our God
[17:51] the truth church is marching on here o
[17:55] Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord in
[18:00] the book the Old Testament and there God
[18:04] said he was one God and God has never
[18:08] changed his mind about his word about
[18:12] his person his personality of who he is
[18:17] now so this doctrine caused a split
[18:20] first of all it caused a division this
[18:24] doctrine did certainly that in one side
[18:28] the side that believed in three gods
[18:32] went you know they adopted a system of
[18:38] polytheism which means many gods believe
[18:43] in many gods but yet those many gods
[18:48] become one God and they move from
[18:52] believing in many thoughts because we
[18:55] remember we're talking about the time
[18:58] when it was in the days of pagan Rome
[19:02] let me differentiate pagan Rome under
[19:07] all those different emperors right on
[19:10] down to constant time who was the one
[19:14] that brought this Nicean Council
[19:18] together to settle the argument between
[19:22] the these two groups in his Empire and
[19:27] so we know that this cause is split in
[19:32] the early church after that these
[19:36] apostles had left the scene and one side
[19:41] move from their original place when it
[19:47] was pagan rule believing in many gods
[19:52] polytheism and compromise by moving to a
[19:57] position where let me
[20:00] to believe or set they began to believe
[20:03] in three gods the other site maintained
[20:08] the position that there is only one God
[20:13] and those teachings and those things
[20:19] have come right on down until our day
[20:24] and our time that we are living in but
[20:29] the revelation that came through John by
[20:32] the holy spirit to all the churches said
[20:36] I am the Lord Jesus Christ in other
[20:41] words I am all in all i am alpha i am
[20:44] omega there isn't any other god how
[20:47] about the almighty i am the lord i am
[20:50] the first I am the last of the beginning
[20:53] I am the end on him which was in the
[20:56] first time in the middle and I will be
[20:58] there at the end him which was which is
[21:01] and is to come the Lord Almighty he is
[21:06] making his deity known to all and he has
[21:12] put his seal his stamp of approval upon
[21:17] this book of Revelation and upon all
[21:20] genuine holy spirit given revelation no
[21:25] think about this consider this my
[21:28] friends who was the father of Jesus
[21:34] Matthew chapter 1 verse 18 says she was
[21:40] found with child of the Holy Ghost
[21:45] strange for Jesus himself when he was
[21:49] asked the question said my father God is
[21:54] my father God is my father then we are
[22:00] left with the problem who is the father
[22:04] of Jesus Christ if they were truly three
[22:08] distinct persons in one God was the holy
[22:12] ghost his father or was it God the
[22:16] Father that was his father did he have
[22:20] one father or two fathers certainly not
[22:24] because of not understanding the
[22:27] revelation that it is one God amen one
[22:31] God and the name of that God that
[22:34] wonderful God that revealed himself and
[22:39] made himself form the body went into it
[22:43] God in Christ amen yet God was in Christ
[22:47] hallelujah and here it was one God not
[22:51] two not three but one God we'll get to
[22:55] all of these finer things as we go on
[22:59] with this lesson in the future maybe not
[23:02] tonight because there's a lot of meat
[23:05] lots of things to cover and we want to
[23:08] take our time and cover it properly and
[23:12] appropriately so that you might have a
[23:14] clearer understanding if you so desire
[23:17] and if you open up your heart to receive
[23:20] it know we see historically and
[23:23] scripturally people have wondered where
[23:28] these three came from where did this
[23:31] thought this theory of three gods being
[23:35] one came from now we know that that
[23:40] foundational doctrine of what modern
[23:45] Christianity from the time of 325 AD
[23:49] until now because that sort of three
[23:52] gods was never has never been there in
[23:56] the scriptures at all until that time we
[24:01] understand the only nations that help
[24:04] those kinds of beliefs and thoughts were
[24:08] the Babylonian Sumerians various other
[24:12] peoples of the pagan a Dark Ages of the
[24:17] Old Testament but we know that
[24:21] Joe over always declared himself that he
[24:25] is one not three but one no this Trinity
[24:31] of course using the word fringe is
[24:34] absolutely unscriptural it's not
[24:37] anywhere in our Bible but never mind
[24:41] that we understand that it's absolutely
[24:46] unscriptural unbiblical and it's really
[24:50] based upon the the many gods of pagan
[24:56] Rome the Romans at that time had many
[25:01] gods and they prayed to those many gods
[25:09] and they also prayed to their ancestors
[25:16] and used or prayed to their ancestors as
[25:22] mediators who they believed if they pray
[25:26] to their ancestors their ancestor could
[25:29] intercede with God beyond the veil on
[25:34] their behalf you see my friends the thin
[25:39] skin veil that is there then it took
[25:43] them just one step one step to give new
[25:50] names to their own gods and so we have
[25:58] Saints today to make it more biblical
[26:03] they call some of their ancestors Saints
[26:09] thus we find instead of openly
[26:14] worshiping Jupiter or Venus or Mars we
[26:21] have the worship of Peter and Paul and
[26:29] all these various ones the worship of
[26:34] fatty
[26:36] Christopher and many others
[26:40] you see they could not make their pagan
[26:44] religion work or their religious system
[26:48] work with just one not so the closest
[26:54] they could get still maintaining their
[26:57] many God's system was to uh kind of
[27:02] bring it down to three gods and they
[27:08] were then that they done split him this
[27:12] one God that we're talking about this
[27:15] him into three to get their religious
[27:19] system to be able to work and they men
[27:25] intercessors or mediators of the Saints
[27:32] and demand intercessors of their
[27:36] ancestors ever since then the entire
[27:44] spiritual atmosphere was polluted and
[27:49] people fail to realize that the teaching
[27:56] of God is that there is one God era
[28:01] blotted out the knowledge of one God
[28:08] took away completely
[28:10] then it was not three gods but one God
[28:14] manifesting himself in three various
[28:18] offices that's how I'm a father I am a
[28:23] son I'm a human being doesn't make me
[28:27] three people I am one person but I move
[28:32] in three different offices three
[28:36] different roles but one person and so is
[28:42] it God is one God now we also know they
[28:47] tried to make it in
[28:49] some fantastic theory that God is like a
[28:52] bunch of grapes three persons but
[28:59] mysteriously become one sharing their
[29:05] divinity equally by all three of them
[29:11] but plainly says here in the book of
[29:14] Revelation by the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:17] himself him that day which is that which
[29:24] was that which is to come he is the
[29:32] Alpha and Omega not day which means that
[29:37] he not they he is the eighth to Z they
[29:43] all in all this means he is everything
[29:50] he said the Almighty he is the Rose of
[29:57] Sharon he not they he is the lily of the
[30:02] valley he not they he is the bright and
[30:07] morning star he not they the righteous
[30:14] branch he or him the Lord Jesus not they
[30:20] he is
[30:22] the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost he
[30:27] is God Almighty one God operating or
[30:32] manifesting himself in three distinct
[30:36] offices first Timothy chapter 3 verse 16
[30:41] says and without controversy
[30:47] that is to say without argument without
[30:52] the bait with a question without any
[30:56] dispute God was manifest great
[31:02] the mystery of godliness that who God
[31:07] was manifested in the flesh who was
[31:10] manifested in the flesh God was
[31:13] manifested in the flesh justified in the
[31:18] spirit God was justified in the spirit
[31:22] seen of angels who was seen Avengers God
[31:27] was seen of angels preached on to the
[31:33] Gentiles God was preached unto the
[31:37] Gentiles who is this God Jesus Christ
[31:41] amen
[31:42] believed on in the world and was
[31:47] received up into glory who was received
[31:50] up God was received up into glory this
[31:54] is what Timothy is saying that great is
[31:57] the mystery of godliness that God was
[32:01] manifested in the flesh and that God
[32:05] that was manifested in the flesh
[32:07] preached on inter in the world that same
[32:11] God was received back up into glory not
[32:17] another God the Bible says it clearly
[32:20] it says God one God was made manifested
[32:25] in the flesh and that one God that we
[32:28] know I believe is the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:31] I think that ought to settle it right
[32:33] there I just love the words of this
[32:37] beautiful son he's God in the Father
[32:40] he's God in the son he's God in the Holy
[32:45] Ghost he's got the only one I know God
[32:48] he's God and God don't ever change I
[32:52] know God he's God and Jesus is his name
[32:59] all thank God there's only one God and
[33:02] His name is a Lord Jesus Christ they're
[33:06] these apostles knew who he was and they
[33:09] did not try to make him into another guy
[33:12] or a second god or a third god but the
[33:17] only God he was gone very you he was
[33:22] very God he was that only God and it is
[33:26] it is this marvelous revelation that is
[33:29] now being restored
[33:31] to empower the church to come back to
[33:34] the word come back to God and to
[33:36] recognize what was erased by era now
[33:42] being restored by the righteousness and
[33:45] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ back
[33:47] into the church that is the revelation
[33:50] one God and I thank God for that that he
[33:54] is Lord he is Lord he is risen from the
[33:58] dead and he is Lord every knee shall bow
[34:02] and every tongue shall confess that
[34:04] Jesus Christ is Lord may God bless you
