[47:56] gods out there all different idols out
[47:58] there but they're not praying to the
[48:00] person i'm praying to amen and i'm
[48:03] praying to the person not up in the sky
[48:05] i'm praying to the person with inside of
[48:07] me
[48:08] that's who jesus was praying not to
[48:11] another god but to the father that was
[48:13] inside of him
[48:15] amen
[48:16] oh god
[48:18] amen
[48:21] he broke the powers of satan
[48:25] he opened the prison doors
[48:28] of hell
[48:29] to every man that was shut up
[48:31] in this earth
[48:33] in the prisons fearing that when they he
[48:37] died
[48:38] what death would bring to him
[48:41] on calvary he opened those cell doors
[48:44] and let every captive go
[48:46] free
[48:48] you don't have to no longer be torn down
[48:51] by sin
[48:52] now listen
[48:53] you don't have to no longer yield your
[48:56] members your flesh your thoughts your
[48:58] mind
[48:59] to sin to unbelief
[49:01] drinking smoking gambling telling lies
[49:03] being dishonest
[49:05] but you now can walk uprightly
[49:09] amen
[49:10] we can walk uprightly we can walk in
[49:12] victory
[49:14] we can walk in overcoming power
[49:17] because of him so when we pray this is
[49:20] what we're praying amen overcoming power
[49:23] is given to us victory is given to us
[49:27] everything is given to us but if you
[49:30] don't know
[49:31] who you're praying to if you don't know
[49:33] doesn't the bible say
[49:35] for a lack of knowledge a lack of
[49:37] knowing god a lack of knowing the
[49:40] promises my people perish
[49:45] it's no in him it's knowing what god has
[49:48] given us it's knowing what he has done
[49:50] for us
[49:51] it puts you in a different element when
[49:53] you go into prayer
[49:55] you're not praying by emotions you're
[49:57] not praying by feelings amen you're not
[50:00] praying by your own thoughts and we're
[50:02] still moving in that room and praying in
[50:04] those our feelings and our emotions are
[50:07] not part of it it has nothing to do with
[50:10] it when you get down to pray you take
[50:12] that word of god you take what he has
[50:14] done for you you take the cross amen you
[50:17] take the promises and you go forth in
[50:20] every situation and circumstance amen
[50:23] and you speak that word
[50:25] you speak that word that's what it's
[50:27] about
[50:28] it's not about us
[50:30] my brothers and sisters it's not about
[50:32] how much you can cry how much you can
[50:34] get emotional amen is about looking to
[50:37] the word and the promises amen that's
[50:40] what's going to bring it to pass
[50:43] sometimes we think i'm talking about
[50:45] prayer this morning knowing him
[50:47] sometimes we think we can just cry to
[50:50] the lord with our emotions and our
[50:52] feelings let me tell you brothers and
[50:53] sisters the bride is reason to such a
[50:56] level of discernment
[50:58] they she can tell
[51:00] if you're talking to god when brother
[51:02] bradley walked into the room with that
[51:04] little uh woman there that's reminding a
[51:06] woman she started praying he said i know
[51:10] she talks to god
[51:12] oh i know she talks with him every night
[51:15] i know she's at his feet
[51:19] i know she knows him
[51:21] oh my
[51:23] that's what i want to talk to god
[51:25] in that way
[51:27] amen
[51:29] amen glory to god
[51:32] we're set free
[51:34] not under fear of death
[51:36] no
[51:37] no no longer fear of death anymore
[51:40] you know that's another thing we pray
[51:42] under fear
[51:43] amen we go into prayer
[51:46] and we go into prayer to god because we
[51:48] want to we want to release our fears
[51:51] there is no more fear
[51:53] amen he took fear he took the fear
[51:57] even of death
[51:59] not just circumstances in your life all
[52:01] financial problems health problems i
[52:04] know what health problems are my
[52:05] brothers and sisters i've been through
[52:07] them enough in the last six months i'm
[52:09] standing up here by the grace of god
[52:11] amen they want to operate on my back and
[52:14] my in my spine and put uh
[52:16] plates and everything in there amen i'm
[52:19] standing here because i know what it is
[52:21] amen about these situations but that's
[52:25] not that's that's not what god amen
[52:28] wants us to focus on and look at amen he
[52:32] wants me to look at his word look at his
[52:35] promises amen
[52:36] how am i going to receive faith for
[52:38] healing how am i going to receive faith
[52:40] for deliverance when i'm looking at all
[52:42] the circumstances when i'm approaching
[52:44] god in prayer by fear
[52:47] fear of these things
[52:49] i gotta approach him by faith i gotta
[52:51] look to the word look to the promises
[52:54] look what he said look what he's done
[52:56] for me
[53:00] listen calvary means everything to me
[53:03] everything
[53:04] until you get to a place where calvary
[53:07] means everything that calvary is your
[53:09] life
[53:12] and you're never going to meet god
[53:13] you're never going to know him like paul
[53:15] wanted to know him in the power of his
[53:17] resurrection
[53:18] amen
[53:21] hallelujah
[53:22] our relationship or revelation of the
[53:25] person determines how we talk to
[53:27] somebody
[53:30] what you know about somebody determines
[53:31] your conversation
[53:33] true
[53:36] now the same is true with god
[53:38] your understanding of what god really
[53:41] is
[53:42] shapes you
[53:44] shapes everything about you in your life
[53:46] including your prayer life
[53:48] nothing influences your life more than
[53:51] how you view god
[53:54] oh my
[53:55] i mean i i can i can just be
[53:58] uh
[53:59] gullible and think that everybody views
[54:01] god the way i view god
[54:03] but listen if you go through this
[54:05] morning here
[54:07] if god would come down
[54:09] and reveal how each and every one of us
[54:12] view god i bet you there would be
[54:13] different views this morning
[54:16] but your view of god
[54:18] amen determines your relationship with
[54:20] him
[54:20] how you see him
[54:23] too many people are relating this world
[54:26] this flesh your problems your
[54:28] circumstances your heartaches and your
[54:31] pains
[54:32] your viewing those things as god but let
[54:34] me tell you god is good and god is good
[54:38] all the time and god can be nothing but
[54:40] good
[54:44] that's who god is
[54:47] oh my
[54:49] amen
[54:53] now lots of people have misconceptions
[54:55] about god
[54:57] i believe that
[54:58] i believe that because i've been there
[55:00] as i grow in faith and i as i grow to
[55:02] know him i realize a lot of conceptions
[55:05] i had of god amen
[55:07] oh my realizing that wasn't never god
[55:10] speaking to me all these negative
[55:12] thoughts oh you're not saved you're not
[55:15] born again you're not going to make that
[55:17] you're not going to make it into heaven
[55:18] you're not going to make the rapture
[55:20] amen every one of us have to go through
[55:22] those stages
[55:23] i don't know where you are this morning
[55:25] amen but that can view satan can put
[55:28] that in your mind and that can that can
[55:30] that can form a view of god to you that
[55:33] god is speaking all these lies to you
[55:35] amen let me tell you one thing until you
[55:38] get those lies out of your head you
[55:40] cannot enter in you cannot seek god the
[55:43] way he wants and he cannot reveal
[55:46] himself through that you gotta that's
[55:48] why paul says i have to die daily
[55:51] die out to everything die out to your
[55:53] fears die out to your thoughts die out
[55:56] to all the insecurities that you have in
[55:59] your life
[56:00] you gotta die out to all that stuff you
[56:02] got to let it go
[56:04] you know i came to a place you know
[56:06] i came to a place where i used to tell
[56:07] satan when he used to come to me
[56:09] and speak all kinds of unbelief to me i
[56:12] say you know what satan i know i don't
[56:14] deserve heaven
[56:15] i know i deserve hell you know what and
[56:18] i believe there's still too many people
[56:20] think you deserve heaven let me tell you
[56:22] this morning you're going to heaven by
[56:24] the grace of god but you don't deserve
[56:26] it
[56:27] he deserves it he gave it to us amen
[56:32] that's the only way i deserve it the
[56:34] only way i deserve the blessings of god
[56:36] and god to come into my life and keep me
[56:39] every day
[56:40] he just didn't he just didn't save me
[56:42] back there 30 years ago and gave me the
[56:44] new the new birth he keeps me every day
[56:49] every day the battle gets tougher and
[56:51] stronger people are falling away by the
[56:54] minute people are falling away in their
[56:56] minds in their hearts
[56:59] amen they're leaving god by the minute
[57:02] but here i am this morning by the grace
[57:04] of god hear you this morning by the
[57:06] grace of god seeking amen thirsting and
[57:09] hungering for the living god
[57:13] because of his grace
[57:16] amen
[57:17] oh
[57:18] my hallelujah
[57:20] amen let me read
[57:23] some people think god is angry upset at
[57:26] them all the time never can please them
[57:29] you ever think that way you can never
[57:31] please god
[57:32] because you're looking at your failures
[57:33] you're looking at your backsliding
[57:36] he changes his mind continually about
[57:38] you
[57:39] you ever you ever go through that this
[57:41] is just common sense here amen
[57:44] down to earth basics
[57:46] amen that's what brother branham said he
[57:48] said god in simplicity your abc's amen
[57:52] we got the message of the hour we got
[57:53] the highest form of truth and revelation
[57:55] of this hour amen that you can ever
[57:58] break into amen but if you don't get
[58:00] past this you ain't going there
[58:05] hallelujah some people
[58:07] i look at him as a dictator god
[58:09] demanding more and more and more
[58:11] it's never enough
[58:13] oh what condemnation to be under satan
[58:16] puts you under all of these things not
[58:19] god
[58:20] god never put you under any of these any
[58:22] of these demands any of these controls
[58:24] is satan
[58:26] know your enemy
[58:28] know that you're in a battle
[58:30] too many people are crying and and
[58:32] crying and crying not realizing it's the
[58:35] devil and you've got the name of jesus
[58:37] christ you've got faith in your heart to
[58:39] cast them out
[58:41] but it takes prayer
[58:43] it takes time and prayer sometimes the
[58:45] bible says some only come up by fasting
[58:48] and
[58:48] pray those days are not over my brothers
[58:51] and sisters
[58:52] they're still here
[58:54] hallelujah
[58:57] amen
[58:58] and some view god as santa claus
[59:02] he's making a list he's checking it
[59:03] twice he's seeing if you're naughty or
[59:06] nice
[59:09] it's funny
[59:11] but it's true
[59:12] oh yeah i tell you you don't wanna you
[59:14] won't admit it but a lot of yous fall in
[59:16] this category the way you view god the
[59:18] way you think
[59:20] amen
[59:21] you got to change your thinking because
[59:22] that's the devil thinking not god
[59:24] god has nothing to do with that kind of
[59:26] thinking
[59:28] there are many characteristics of god
[59:30] well let us look this morning
[59:33] at the goodness of god
[59:35] because it's his goodness
[59:37] it's the goodness of god
[59:39] that is is the base of all our prayers
[59:42] if god is not good
[59:45] a good god you have zero reason to pray
[59:48] and zero motivation to pray is that the
[59:51] truth
[59:52] amen
[59:53] if you don't go into prayer knowing god
[59:55] is good
[59:57] amen whatever you're gonna ask him
[59:59] you're going to ask him by what emotion
[1:00:02] are by feelings no by faith
[1:00:05] faith in his word that god is good to
[1:00:08] honor his word
[1:00:10] amen god will back up his word when i go
[1:00:13] into prayer i know god is going to back
[1:00:15] up his word when i ask anything
[1:00:17] according to his will
[1:00:19] i don't got selfless mortals
[1:00:21] i don't think of my own life i don't
[1:00:24] think of my own agenda i think of god's
[1:00:26] agenda and when you think of god's
[1:00:28] agenda first and you go into prayer with
[1:00:31] that kind of attitude
[1:00:33] watch what happens
[1:00:35] jesus only prayed to the father he only
[1:00:38] prayed god's will be done father not my
[1:00:40] will but thy will be done
[1:00:43] thy will be done not my will even jesus
[1:00:46] himself prayed that way
[1:00:48] how much more us
[1:00:50] oh dying out my brothers and sisters to
[1:00:53] this flesh
[1:00:55] oh my you got to crucify this flesh amen
[1:00:59] oh my you don't want to die but
[1:01:01] everybody wants to go to heaven
[1:01:03] let me tell you
[1:01:04] you know we're going to die before we
[1:01:06] get to heaven
[1:01:08] we're dying now amen
[1:01:11] hallelujah
[1:01:12] now there's only
[1:01:14] only reason
[1:01:16] there's any good
[1:01:18] in the world
[1:01:20] is because god is good amen that's the
[1:01:22] only reason god and god is the creator
[1:01:26] of all goodness
[1:01:28] in all of this universe
[1:01:30] let me tell you something you can't
[1:01:32] spell
[1:01:33] good
[1:01:34] without god yes sir
[1:01:37] you can't spell good
[1:01:39] without god
[1:01:41] because good
[1:01:42] is god
[1:01:44] oh my
[1:01:46] brother tim why are you hitting this on
[1:01:48] this constantly because you need to know
[1:01:50] that god is good
[1:01:53] all the time every situation
[1:01:56] in your life
[1:01:57] no matter what it looks like
[1:02:00] even to the brink of death
[1:02:02] even on your deathbed god is good
[1:02:09] oh my
[1:02:11] woo
[1:02:12] jesus
[1:02:16] hallelujah if there's no god there is no
[1:02:19] good there is no right there is no wrong
[1:02:22] there is no good there is no bad
[1:02:24] there is nothing without god
[1:02:27] my god stands alone
[1:02:29] amen this word of this hour stands alone
[1:02:33] nothing compares to this word because
[1:02:36] this word is god himself
[1:02:38] this word that i'm believing this word
[1:02:40] that i'm allowed to take over my life
[1:02:43] that i'm surrendering
[1:02:44] to my life to this word is god himself
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:49] oh my
[1:02:51] lord jesus
[1:02:54] now because god is always good
[1:02:56] i want you to understand these because
[1:02:59] when you understand how good god really
[1:03:01] is
[1:03:02] you're going to enjoy
[1:03:03] prayer
[1:03:05] oh my
[1:03:06] how many of us enjoy pray
[1:03:12] enjoy praying
[1:03:14] when it becomes a joy to pray
[1:03:17] oh my
[1:03:18] amen brother desmond brother desmond
[1:03:20] goes into prayer he enjoys it
[1:03:23] when a challenge of sickness comes
[1:03:25] before him it's been manifested you
[1:03:28] can't help god who believes the word
[1:03:31] signs and wonders follow them he goes
[1:03:33] into prayer knowing god
[1:03:35] amen it's not going to fail him because
[1:03:37] he's not going by his own feelings he's
[1:03:39] not going by his own emotions he's not
[1:03:41] going by what he thinks or what power or
[1:03:44] what or he's a healer or anything he's
[1:03:46] god knowing god amen knowing that god
[1:03:50] stands behind his word
[1:03:52] knowing that all his motive intention is
[1:03:55] for god and he knows god is good
[1:03:59] amen when you look at somebody sick you
[1:04:01] can't look at them and look and see
[1:04:03] their sin you can't look at them and see
[1:04:05] their mistakes amen god never looks
[1:04:08] through those eyes he looks and sees
[1:04:10] good amen amen he looks through the
[1:04:13] blood of jesus christ
[1:04:16] who am i who are you
[1:04:18] who are we to condem any one of us
[1:04:21] to look at any one of our faults
[1:04:24] i got faults i got mistakes
[1:04:27] i don't know how much is going to fall
[1:04:28] off before i leave this earth i got them
[1:04:32] but when you look at them look at them
[1:04:34] through the blood
[1:04:36] because if you don't
[1:04:38] and you say brother tim this brother tim
[1:04:40] that
[1:04:41] you're saying to the blood of jesus
[1:04:42] christ
[1:04:44] i say that by faith
[1:04:45] i believe that by faith so when i look
[1:04:47] at you i look it through the blood of
[1:04:49] jesus christ
[1:04:51] amen
[1:04:52] hallelujah
[1:04:55] glory to god
[1:04:56] it's not a duty it's a delight
[1:04:59] anytime prayer becomes a ritual boring
[1:05:02] to you
[1:05:03] it's because you don't understand or
[1:05:05] know how good god is people say well i
[1:05:09] just don't love god enough no that's not
[1:05:12] your problem your problem is you don't

[1:05:27] works
[1:05:29] it's not about you whether your works
[1:05:31] are good or not
[1:05:33] it's his love
[1:05:35] when you look at calvary what do you see
[1:05:37] you see any part of you and calvary and
[1:05:39] what he did
[1:05:41] it's him
[1:05:43] it's how much he loves you he did that
[1:05:46] not how much you love yourself
[1:05:48] people say oh you've got to love
[1:05:49] yourself on the internet you got to love
[1:05:51] yourself you better love yourself let me
[1:05:53] tell you all i need to know is that god

[1:07:51] can't deny himself
[1:07:53] he can't be evil
[1:07:55] god is good so by nature he cannot be
[1:07:58] evil

[1:09:40] live your life and be free my brothers
[1:09:42] and sisters
[1:09:43] amen
[1:09:44] satan binds us so much to live in fear
[1:09:47] down here
[1:09:48] the fear of death was the greatest enemy
[1:09:50] that that jesus came to destroy
[1:09:53] and people are still under that fear of
[1:09:55] death
[1:09:57] when you walk
[1:10:00] free of that fear
[1:10:02] you experience totally different things
[1:10:04] they think they experience things out
[1:10:05] there when they when they meditate and
[1:10:08] or they get set free from certain habits
[1:10:10] or whatever they're on the mountain you
[1:10:11] see them they're expressing they break
[1:10:13] through certain things
[1:10:15] but my god they can't break fear they
[1:10:17] can't break through the fear of death
[1:10:19] the fear of being lost
[1:10:21] but only the bride of jesus christ by
[1:10:23] the word when you break
[1:10:25] free of that
[1:10:27] oh my
[1:10:28] you're living a totally different life
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:34] then shall you call upon me
[1:10:37] and ye shall go and pray listen pray
[1:10:40] unto me and i will hearken unto you
[1:10:44] that's my word again
[1:10:46] and when you call to me
[1:10:49] and you pray
[1:10:50] i will listen
[1:10:53] you see the connection between purpose
[1:10:56] and prayer between god's plan for your
[1:10:59] life and prayer
[1:11:06] if you're if you're catching the letter
[1:11:10] then you're going to get bored very soon
[1:11:12] but if you're in the spirit
[1:11:15] and god you're walking with god every
[1:11:16] day you're walking in the spirit you
[1:11:19] know him
[1:11:20] this is just enriching you
[1:11:23] your relationship with him
[1:11:25] your purpose in life
[1:11:27] is going to encourage you to walk
[1:11:29] outside these doors that's what he meant
[1:11:31] to me he says lord let me walk out of
[1:11:33] these doors differently when i came in
[1:11:35] let me walk out more encouraged
[1:11:38] oh my more knowing who i am and who you
[1:11:40] are and my purpose in life that when i
[1:11:43] pray you'll hear me
[1:11:47] hallelujah
[1:11:50] oh my
[1:11:52] you may
[1:11:53] not know god as well as you think
[1:11:56] for he is far above
[1:11:58] us in the heavens
[1:12:00] far above the earth the bible says his
[1:12:03] greatness is unsearchable psalms 145 3
[1:12:07] his judgments are unsearchable
[1:12:09] romans 11 33 his riches are unsearchable
[1:12:13] ephesians 3 8 nevertheless he is notable
[1:12:17] you could know him according to the
[1:12:20] bible he has revealed aspects of himself
[1:12:23] both in nature and in the word and we
[1:12:26] can know him who is unsearchable
[1:12:30] oh my what an honor and what a privilege
[1:12:32] we have
[1:12:34] to be
[1:12:35] in this position
[1:12:37] we call it the position in christ your
[1:12:39] position in christ but to be in this
[1:12:41] position to know the true and living god
[1:12:45] what is it going to be my brothers and
[1:12:47] sisters people who are sitting under
[1:12:49] this word of this hour i can say under
[1:12:52] this anointed ministry that god has
[1:12:54] given us here a man of god amen what is
[1:12:57] it going to be on that day
[1:13:00] when
[1:13:03] you realize
[1:13:05] you didn't search for him you didn't
[1:13:08] seek for him did he not say seek and you
[1:13:10] shall find knock and it shall be open
[1:13:13] doesn't the bible say you haven't
[1:13:15] strived under blood
[1:13:17] you haven't strived you haven't pressed
[1:13:19] your way in to the kingdom
[1:13:22] my brothers and sisters
[1:13:24] it's not time to get lukewarm lazy in
[1:13:28] lack and allow satan to come into the
[1:13:30] church
[1:13:31] and make it powerless
[1:13:33] formal
[1:13:35] amen it's time to shake ourselves
[1:13:38] it's time to release ourselves from the
[1:13:41] influence of the world and what's going
[1:13:43] on out there
[1:13:44] get our minds off of that and get our
[1:13:47] minds up back on the promise
[1:13:49] no matter how it changes out there my
[1:13:51] brothers and sisters god's word has
[1:13:53] never changed
[1:13:54] god's purpose for the bride of jesus
[1:13:56] christ and what he's doing in her life
[1:13:58] has never changed
[1:14:00] and people are drifting away from that
[1:14:03] not realizing it
[1:14:06] i don't want to stay here i don't know
[1:14:08] about you i don't want to stay here
[1:14:10] this is not my home
[1:14:12] we sing the song this world is not my
[1:14:14] home i'm just passing through
[1:14:17] my treasures are laid up
[1:14:19] somewhere beyond the blue
[1:14:21] the angels are backing me from heaven's
[1:14:24] open door door and i can't feel at home
[1:14:28] i can't feel at home
[1:14:30] i can't feel at home
[1:14:32] in this world
[1:14:34] anymore
[1:14:36] is that where you are
[1:14:38] well let's get praying
[1:14:40] church let's get praying

[1:14:44] let's get dying out
[1:14:46] let's get this thing moving let's get
[1:14:48] this motivation of the word of god going
[1:14:52] oh my
[1:14:55] oh lord jesus
[1:14:58] according to the bible our god is the
[1:15:00] everlasting father the god of hosts the
[1:15:03] lord of heaven and earth the author and
[1:15:05] finisher of our faith he is the
[1:15:07] comforter he is the counselor he is the
[1:15:10] creator he is the great physician
[1:15:13] he is the god of all grace he is the i
[1:15:16] am the alpha and the omega the holy one
[1:15:18] of israel we call him jehovah the most
[1:15:21] high the lord of the living the lord of
[1:15:23] the dead
[1:15:25] he makes
[1:15:26] he is the maker of he's the maker he's
[1:15:28] the mediator he's the man of sorrow he's
[1:15:31] our prophet priest king he's our
[1:15:33] redeemer our refuge our rock he's our
[1:15:36] ruler of heaven and earth he's the
[1:15:38] friend of sinners he is everything to us
[1:15:43] what is left out my brothers and sisters
[1:15:45] in your walk in your life
[1:15:48] what hasn't he done what hasn't he
[1:15:50] provided for you to make him everything
[1:15:52] in your life
[1:15:54] why haven't you made him everything in
[1:15:56] your life
[1:15:57] why haven't you surrendered everything
[1:15:59] to him
[1:16:01] is there any more you can get out there
[1:16:04] is there any more better
[1:16:07] more secure than him than jesus christ
[1:16:10] if not then why haven't we surrendered
[1:16:12] everything to him
[1:16:18] hallelujah
[1:16:21] jesus
[1:16:25] trying to comprehend the person of god
[1:16:27] is like trying to capture all the
[1:16:29] galaxies of the universe in a child's
[1:16:31] mind
[1:16:32] yet the bible encourages us to try
[1:16:35] to seek
[1:16:36] to know the desires to be worshipped and
[1:16:39] worship him
[1:16:40] as he reveals himself in his creation
[1:16:43] and his word psalms 37 3 says trust in
[1:16:46] the lord
[1:16:47] and do good
[1:16:48] dwell in the land and feed on his
[1:16:51] faithfulness
[1:16:53] feed
[1:16:54] on his faithfulness
[1:16:55] oh my
[1:16:57] what does it mean to feed on his

[1:17:12] attributes and qualities it means to
[1:17:15] feed on jesus the bread of life
[1:17:18] feed on him
[1:17:21] we've been given everything that we
[1:17:23] possibly can be given
[1:17:26] to feed on him
[1:17:31] oh my

[1:17:50] and that stuff but say it anyways
[1:17:53] i hear brother danny i hear brother
[1:17:55] desmond they got masks on praise god my
[1:17:57] brothers and sisters
[1:17:59] it's not because of brother tim
[1:18:01] it's not because of who's sitting beside
[1:18:02] you
[1:18:04] you realize the invisible one the
[1:18:05] creators of heaven and earth is here
[1:18:09] do you realize that there's angels in
[1:18:11] camp do you feel something brushed by
[1:18:14] you if you're in the spirit brushing by

[1:18:24] you call upon him when you seek him he
[1:18:26] comes
[1:18:27] amen
[1:18:28] hallelujah it's not just in the days of
[1:18:30] brother branham where they had those
[1:18:32] meetings amen the room got so cloudy
[1:18:35] with faith amen because people are
[1:18:37] seeking god
[1:18:38] amen people were seeking god so much
[1:18:41] back then now you know what they're
[1:18:42] seeking god for not necessarily the
[1:18:44] revelation of the word
[1:18:46] to to become one with him
[1:18:48] to allow that word to manifest in their
[1:18:50] lives and become one with their flesh
[1:18:52] they were seeking god back then and they
[1:18:53] had that kind of faith to move on the
[1:18:55] spirit of god for healing in their body
[1:18:59] how much more
[1:19:02] today
[1:19:04] how much more should we be seeking god
[1:19:07] and wanted his presence to move
[1:19:10] i've been there brothers and sisters
[1:19:13] you might be here this morning in
[1:19:15] sitting in the pew and just bored or
[1:19:18] sitting in the pew saying oh i you know
[1:19:20] i wish this would get over or whatever
[1:19:23] thoughts that you're thinking amen
[1:19:27] not having a desire to know god
[1:19:30] looking at the time when's the service
[1:19:32] going to be over when's he going to stop
[1:19:34] preaching when he's going to stop doing
[1:19:36] this not recognizing that you're missing
[1:19:39] the greatest opportunity that man has
[1:19:41] ever got amen to come into his presence
[1:19:46] and to know him
[1:19:48] and to know him
[1:19:50] and for him to come to you and reveal
[1:19:53] himself to you that's why we come this
[1:19:55] morning
[1:19:56] not because of a building
[1:19:59] we can lose that at any time
[1:20:02] any time in the future we can lose this
[1:20:05] we know it's prophecy and it's going to
[1:20:06] come to pass
[1:20:08] it doesn't matter where i am in a
[1:20:09] basement on the street
[1:20:11] amen his presence is the same no matter
[1:20:14] where i go
[1:20:16] because i seek him
[1:20:20] slide five
[1:20:22] we're there
[1:20:24] now listen my brothers and sisters
[1:20:29] the true church
[1:20:31] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:20:35] but the book of revelation shows that
[1:20:37] the antichrist spirit would come into
[1:20:39] the church
[1:20:41] and defile it
[1:20:42] make it lukewarm formal and
[1:20:45] it's expose satan revealing his works
[1:20:49] attempt destruction
[1:20:51] of god's people
[1:20:53] and the discrediting of god's word but
[1:20:56] let me tell you one thing my brothers
[1:20:57] and sisters the bride of jesus christ he
[1:21:00] ain't going to let that happen
[1:21:03] if you're the bride of jesus christ you
[1:21:05] ain't going to let that happen
[1:21:07] because something which is the holy
[1:21:09] ghost which is christ himself amen is
[1:21:12] going to rise up inside of you
[1:21:14] the bible says and the bible is the word
[1:21:17] and the word is god says amen when the
[1:21:20] enemy will come in as a flood in my life
[1:21:24] my god is going to raise the standard
[1:21:26] why because he's good
[1:21:28] he's going to raise the standard he's
[1:21:30] going to make his word more real to me
[1:21:33] so i can live above that battle that i'm
[1:21:37] going through
[1:21:39] so when i get down in prayer and i'm in
[1:21:41] a battle and satan is trying to make me
[1:21:44] lukewarm and powerless i get down in
[1:21:46] prayer and i said my god you said amen
[1:21:50] that you're going to raise a standard
[1:21:52] that that that word is going to become
[1:21:54] more real to me
[1:21:55] and that's what i'm expecting
[1:21:57] in my life
[1:21:59] whoa hallelujah
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:03] you see
[1:22:05] right down to the time he's cast in a
[1:22:06] lake of fire he fights that he cannot
[1:22:09] stand it
[1:22:10] he knows that if the people
[1:22:12] get a true revelation
[1:22:14] of the true church and what she is and
[1:22:17] what she stands for and what she can do
[1:22:20] the greater works she will be invisible
[1:22:22] and that's what satan's fighting this
[1:22:24] morning he fights you every single time
[1:22:27] some of you have not broken through yet
[1:22:29] some of you have not passed through
[1:22:31] certain barriers
[1:22:33] some of you are living comfortable
[1:22:35] amen
[1:22:36] comfortable lives and you're happy in it
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:41] you haven't broken through
[1:22:43] this yet
[1:22:45] and until you break through this
[1:22:48] until you overcome
[1:22:52] you see
[1:22:54] because
[1:22:57] when you get a true revelation of who
[1:22:58] you are
[1:22:59] what the church is
[1:23:01] who god is in your life personally
[1:23:07] then you're going to defeat
[1:23:09] satan
[1:23:10] and his powers
[1:23:13] she will be an invincible army
[1:23:16] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:23:18] spirits working in the framework of the
[1:23:20] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:23:23] discern withstand the antichrist
[1:23:26] satan will be powerless before her is
[1:23:30] anybody listening to me
[1:23:32] he will be defeated
[1:23:34] today
[1:23:36] today
[1:23:37] today
[1:23:39] as he was when christ stood his ever
[1:23:43] is every effort
[1:23:44] to gain power over him in the desert
[1:23:47] yes satan hates
[1:23:50] revelation but we love it
[1:23:52] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:23:54] gates of hell cannot prevail against it
[1:23:57] but we
[1:23:59] but we will prevail over them
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:04] that's why we go into prayer
[1:24:07] amen prayer is not a tradition
[1:24:09] prayer is not what the church has made
[1:24:11] it to be
[1:24:13] prayer to the bride of jesus christ is
[1:24:15] going and speaking the promises in the
[1:24:17] word
[1:24:18] prayer is her weapon amen in battle it's
[1:24:22] her sword
[1:24:23] the sword of the spirit the word of god
[1:24:26] coming through her mouth
[1:24:29] oh my
[1:24:30] oh my
[1:24:33] ephesians 1 17

[1:24:37] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:24:39] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:24:43] the knowledge of him
[1:24:45] paul's speaking here that's what we need
[1:24:47] my brothers and sisters that's what we
[1:24:49] should be seeking for the spirit of
[1:24:52] wisdom and revelation and of knowledge

[1:24:59] be enlightened that ye may know here's
[1:25:01] that word again know
[1:25:03] what is the hope of his calling and what
[1:25:06] the riches of the glory of his
[1:25:08] inheritance is in the saints
[1:25:10] what is our inheritance
[1:25:13] what is our inheritance

[1:32:50] of us

[1:33:11] life
[1:33:12] it doesn't say all things work together
[1:33:14] it says all work together even
[1:33:18] the bad and even the bitter
[1:33:21] all things work together
[1:33:23] slide number seven
[1:33:26] you know the story of joseph in the
[1:33:28] bible
[1:33:29] hey how many
[1:33:31] know it well
[1:33:34] what what a man on earth
[1:33:36] brother branham did he not say correct
[1:33:38] me if i'm wrong
[1:33:40] the closest man of perfection on earth
[1:33:42] outside of jesus christ
[1:33:46] my look at his life my brothers and
[1:33:48] sisters where his brothers sold him into
[1:33:50] slavery
[1:33:52] my my my my
[1:33:54] lord
[1:33:55] there shouldn't be any any complaining
[1:33:57] in us when we leave here about our lives
[1:34:00] anything
[1:34:02] he ends up being second in command in
[1:34:05] egypt
[1:34:06] and years later he confronts his
[1:34:08] brothers
[1:34:09] and he says in genesis 50 20 your plans
[1:34:13] wants to hurt me
[1:34:16] but god turn your evil plans into a good
[1:34:19] plan to save lives of many
[1:34:24] that is called
[1:34:25] redemptive suffering
[1:34:28] sometimes you may suffer for the benefit
[1:34:31] of other people
[1:34:33] amen
[1:34:35] that happens my brothers and sisters in
[1:34:37] our lives
[1:34:39] it's not just jesus is here now
[1:34:42] he's manifesting his word he's
[1:34:43] fulfilling all righteousness in us
[1:34:46] and sometimes we have to suffer and we
[1:34:48] go through suffering for other people
[1:34:52] but if we're stuck on ourselves and
[1:34:54] we're feeling sorry for ourselves and
[1:34:56] why why oh christian life has always got
[1:34:59] to be good is that your conception of
[1:35:01] what christian life is what this word is
[1:35:04] it always got to be a bed of roses amen
[1:35:06] everything has to be perfect i got to be
[1:35:08] prospering and being blessed and
[1:35:10] and healthy and everything all the time
[1:35:13] you're not reading the same bible i'm
[1:35:14] reading
[1:35:16] it doesn't not say any of that stuff
[1:35:20] and i ain't preaching any of that stuff
[1:35:23] but i'm preaching that god is good
[1:35:25] through and all
[1:35:27] all the time
[1:35:31] amen
[1:35:33] that's what jesus did for you
[1:35:36] when he died on the cross that's
[1:35:38] redemptive suffering
[1:35:40] he wasn't paying for his sins was he
[1:35:43] no
[1:35:45] no
[1:35:47] he didn't have he didn't have any he was
[1:35:50] paid for yours and sometimes like
[1:35:52] joseph's case god takes the bidder
[1:35:54] and makes it a world better
[1:35:57] because of what you went through god
[1:36:00] says it's not all good in your life but
[1:36:02] i can use it for good and fit it into my
[1:36:06] plan even when it hurts
[1:36:08] and sin of the other people even when
[1:36:12] you're innocent you're an innocent
[1:36:14] person and you've been hurt by others
[1:36:17] what that's good no that's not good
[1:36:20] it was not good to be hurt by others but
[1:36:23] god can use that hurt yes because god is
[1:36:27] a good god and he loves to bring good
[1:36:29] out of bad anybody can bring good out of
[1:36:32] good but god brings bad out of good out
[1:36:36] of
[1:36:36] bad amen
[1:36:42] are we seeing something here or do i
[1:36:43] have to break it down a little bit more
[1:36:45] here
[1:36:46] do you see do you see how your your
[1:36:49] motives your intentions your your
[1:36:51] selfishness

[1:37:00] brothers and sisters how many are you in
[1:37:01] that category you gotta suffer for other
[1:37:03] people's sins

[1:37:10] sins
[1:37:11] condemn their sins
[1:37:13] criticize their sins
[1:37:16] but lord you want me to suffer for their
[1:37:18] sins well you know you don't understand
[1:37:22] what that means unless you're walking in
[1:37:24] the spirit
[1:37:25] unless the very life of christ that
[1:37:27] manifests that on earth is living that
[1:37:28] through you now
[1:37:30] it's not our life
[1:37:31] paul said it's not i that live but it's
[1:37:33] christ that lives in me what am i
[1:37:35] talking about this morning
[1:37:37] am i talking about you working yourself
[1:37:39] up am i talking about what you can do
[1:37:42] to bring this to pass in your life
[1:37:45] all you can do is die out and surrender
[1:37:46] to the call of god in your life
[1:37:49] that's all you can do it's his life that
[1:37:51] lives out through you and you're sitting
[1:37:53] there experiencing that
[1:37:54] how how do i know that how can i know
[1:37:57] that scripture what i just read there in
[1:37:59] my life is when god puts me through it
[1:38:03] and i go through it

[1:38:16] jesus got down in the garden of yosemite
[1:38:19] and he bled
[1:38:21] sweats of blood
[1:38:22] because he was taking your sins he was
[1:38:25] wrestling every temptation every devil
[1:38:27] of hell
[1:38:28] that we would go through that we would
[1:38:30] have to go through in our lives that we
[1:38:32] would need victory over and he was

[1:44:54] faith a
[1:44:55] something in my heart
[1:44:56] that when i was born again god gave me
[1:44:58] for the people
[1:44:59] to see them
[1:45:01] grow in faith
[1:45:04] and the knowledge of jesus christ

[1:45:17] i have to judge my heart all the time by
[1:45:19] the word of god
[1:45:21] i judge myself the bible says right we
[1:45:24] will judge and we will be judged here
[1:45:27] right we need to judge this thing
[1:45:29] sometimes to see where we're at

[1:45:47] through the same thing or maybe even
[1:45:49] worse and not be devastated anymore and
[1:45:51] that will see and show that your faith
[1:45:53] is growing in christ
[1:45:55] but if you're walking 10 15 years later
[1:45:58] and you're still getting devastated by
[1:45:59] the same things or over and over you're
[1:46:01] not growing let me tell you my brother
[1:46:03] and sister time is running out

[1:47:24] we're winding it down here
[1:47:26] lord have mercy help us father
[1:47:29] amen
[1:47:32] slide number nine
[1:47:34] god always gives me what i need not what
[1:47:36] i deserve
[1:47:38] oh hallelujah
[1:47:41] hallelujah
[1:47:43] let us shake ourselves for a minute i
[1:47:45] know we've been sitting for a bit
[1:47:46] amen but i want to bring a couple
[1:47:48] thoughts here at the end
[1:47:51] that i think is very important amen to
[1:47:54] to to our our belief in our hearts and
[1:47:57] see
[1:47:58] amen how good god is amen
[1:48:01] psalms 103 10 he had not dealt with us
[1:48:05] after our sins
[1:48:06] nor rewarded us according to our
[1:48:08] iniquities oh thank you jesus
[1:48:10] i don't know about you but i'm just
[1:48:12] feeling the love of god in my heart more
[1:48:14] and more when i read when i read this
[1:48:16] when i read this he just he just comes
[1:48:19] and he just jumps out at me
[1:48:21] he has taken
[1:48:22] our sins my sins you can say my sins he
[1:48:25] has taken my sins away and removed them
[1:48:27] far from the easters to the west i like
[1:48:29] that saying from the east to the west
[1:48:31] because there is no end to the east and
[1:48:33] west there is a north pole and a south
[1:48:35] pole there is an end to those
[1:48:37] but god says he takes my sins and he
[1:48:40] just wipes them out
[1:48:42] oh my
[1:48:43] one verse in the bible says he puts them
[1:48:45] in the in the deep parts of the sea
[1:48:48] and then he puts a sign up no fishing
[1:48:50] sign
[1:48:51] oh my
[1:48:52] oh glory
[1:48:55] glory
[1:48:56] when you realize your sins amen he's
[1:48:59] forgiven them
[1:49:02] oh my when you come into that
[1:49:04] realization
[1:49:06] that your sins are gone
[1:49:08] and you don't have to carry them anymore
[1:49:11] we carry them too much that's what holds
[1:49:15] us and bears us down
[1:49:18] but he's taking them
[1:49:20] and i can walk every day in this flesh
[1:49:22] and this dimension with all my mistakes
[1:49:25] with all my ups and downs with all my
[1:49:27] weaknesses
[1:49:28] and say he's taken my sins
[1:49:44] if god hasn't
[1:49:46] forgiven you you need to
[1:49:48] forgive yourself if god has forgiven you
[1:49:50] you need to forgive yourself
[1:49:53] now god is good
[1:49:55] he gives me what i need
[1:49:57] not what i deserve thank you father
[1:50:00] in the bible king david
[1:50:03] commits adultery
[1:50:04] and then covers it up
[1:50:07] he has his wife's husband murdered oh
[1:50:10] god
[1:50:11] pretty big sins murder and adultery
[1:50:14] right on the top
[1:50:18] but
[1:50:18] did david deserve to be forgiven no
[1:50:22] the david deserved mercy no
[1:50:26] but david knows
[1:50:28] that god is good
[1:50:31] and god is so
[1:50:33] he's asked so he asked him for mercy
[1:50:35] because he knows god is good how many
[1:50:38] times we keep our mistakes and our sins
[1:50:40] to ourselves
[1:50:42] and we don't approach god
[1:50:44] because we don't know he's good
[1:50:46] see david committed adultery david
[1:50:49] committed murder
[1:50:50] but he knew
[1:50:52] he knew
[1:50:54] that his god was good
[1:50:56] so he went to god
[1:50:59] not half-heartedly but brokenheartedly
[1:51:01] when he recognizes sin when the prophet
[1:51:03] told him his sin
[1:51:05] he went to god
[1:51:06] and asked for mercy
[1:51:08] because he knew god was good
[1:51:11] oh my
[1:51:13] oh my
[1:51:15] oh my brother my brothers and sisters
[1:51:18] that atonement is so
[1:51:20] the blood sacrifice is for us right now
[1:51:24] that bleeding lamb the lamb of god is on
[1:51:26] an altar of god making intercession
[1:51:28] night and day for us
[1:51:29] if you don't go to that lamb of god no
[1:51:31] matter what you've done
[1:51:32] what sin you're letting hold you back in
[1:51:34] your mind in your hearts go to the lamb
[1:51:37] of god ask for mercy
[1:51:40] ask for deliverance ask for grace
[1:51:42] this is the day and the hour to do that
[1:51:45] because when that day is over when that
[1:51:47] door is closed and the bride of jesus
[1:51:50] christ is coming all that's left is
[1:51:52] judgment the great white throne judgment
[1:51:56] and whoever god will show mercy on
[1:51:59] people are sitting there well you know
[1:52:00] on that day i believe god will show
[1:52:02] mercy or i'm waiting for the last day
[1:52:03] until i died and i'll say you like the
[1:52:05] rich like the thief on the cross god
[1:52:06] have mercy on me don't wait for that day
[1:52:09] my brothers and sisters
[1:52:11] this is the day of salvation
[1:52:13] this is the day of salvation for you you
[1:52:16] know this morning this is the day of
[1:52:18] salvation
[1:52:25] here's what he prayed psalms 51 1-2
[1:52:29] if you are
[1:52:31] in a big sin right now
[1:52:33] you need to go read this psalm 51
[1:52:36] god in your goodness
[1:52:38] have mercy on me
[1:52:39] not because i deserve it
[1:52:41] because you are a good god
[1:52:43] have mercy on me
[1:52:45] wash away my guilt
[1:52:48] and make me clean again
[1:52:50] all that guilt that guilt spirit it's
[1:52:52] tough eh
[1:52:53] i battled with that many times i've made
[1:52:55] mistakes and that guilt my god has kept
[1:52:58] me down it's kept a wall between me and
[1:53:01] god amen but he says he said i'll break
[1:53:04] that wall of petition amen i'll break
[1:53:07] that wall of petition between me and you
[1:53:10] guilt
[1:53:12] guilt
[1:53:14] satan
[1:53:15] just putting that guilt constantly
[1:53:18] we want to break all the walls down
[1:53:20] amen
[1:53:22] we want to come boldly before his throne
[1:53:26] cleanse me from my sin
[1:53:30] it's all based on who god is
[1:53:33] and who you are
[1:53:35] slide 10
[1:53:38] jesus understands our weakness
[1:53:40] for he faced all the same temptations as
[1:53:42] we do yet
[1:53:44] not given into it
[1:53:47] oh thank you lord
[1:53:50] that means
[1:53:51] that means i have a god
[1:53:54] that when i have sin
[1:53:56] and i have temptation
[1:53:58] i can go to him
[1:54:00] do you know him do you know him that way
[1:54:02] that doesn't matter what you face can
[1:54:04] you say that in your heart right now
[1:54:08] that no matter what you face in your
[1:54:09] life you can go to him and he'll take
[1:54:11] care of it amen
[1:54:14] oh not not not oh okay you can do that
[1:54:17] because you know you're a good christian
[1:54:18] you're a good message believer you do
[1:54:20] all the right things your t's are
[1:54:22] crossed your dot well you know what if
[1:54:25] you uh make a mistake that a message
[1:54:27] believer don't make
[1:54:33] oh you're not supposed to make a mistake
[1:54:35] and when you're a message believer in
[1:54:36] that stuff you know
[1:54:38] i don't know where you're at
[1:54:40] you might have great victory in some
[1:54:42] areas great faith in some areas but you
[1:54:43] have you have a weakness in this area
[1:54:46] you could fall you can make mistakes
[1:54:48] this still can happen it doesn't mean
[1:54:50] that your motive and intention is to
[1:54:52] stay there or do that
[1:54:54] i hope not
[1:54:56] or else you need to get to the altar and
[1:54:57] get an experience but a born-again
[1:54:59] christian
[1:55:00] filled with the holy ghost
[1:55:02] like some of us in here today
[1:55:04] can make mistakes in our weaknesses
[1:55:07] amen
[1:55:08] and we can go through that
[1:55:10] but i know that he
[1:55:12] is a good god
[1:55:14] amen and i can go to him in prayer
[1:55:16] hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is
[1:55:18] quicker and powerful sharper than any
[1:55:20] two-edged sword piercing and divided
[1:55:22] asunder the soul and spirit and joints
[1:55:24] and marrow and the desert of the
[1:55:26] thoughts and tents of the heart neither
[1:55:27] is there any creature that is manifested
[1:55:29] in sight all things are naked and open
[1:55:31] before his eyes in whom we have to do
[1:55:33] with seeing that we have a great high
[1:55:36] priest
[1:55:37] has passed into the heavens jesus the
[1:55:39] son of god let us hold fast our
[1:55:42] profession amen
[1:55:44] he's our profession the word is our
[1:55:46] profession
[1:55:47] for we have not a high priest that
[1:55:49] cannot be touched by the feeling of our
[1:55:50] infirmities but in all points was
[1:55:53] tempted like us yet without sin so let
[1:55:56] us
[1:55:57] let us therefore come boldly before the
[1:56:00] throne of grace
[1:56:02] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[1:56:05] in the help in the time of need
[1:56:10] oh i love
[1:56:11] a a a brother or sister who's walking in
[1:56:14] this kind of faith
[1:56:15] amen
[1:56:17] that that goes to god in prayer whether
[1:56:20] they make mistakes or not
[1:56:22] and know that they can go to god and

[1:56:28] oh my my brothers and sisters that sets
[1:56:32] you free when you know that you've got
[1:56:34] that available to you that you can
[1:56:36] obtain mercy and grace
[1:56:38] hallelujah
[1:56:40] amen let me invite the musicians
[1:56:46] i want to tell a story here
[1:56:48] i think it's a beautiful story
[1:56:50] of the grace of god
[1:56:54] and the goodness of god
[1:56:56] oh my
[1:57:00] brother branham
[1:57:03] speaking here
[1:57:07] in the message of grace look at that the
[1:57:09] message of grace
[1:57:12] and when he went down
[1:57:15] oh we're talking about a king
[1:57:17] you remember the story of the king
[1:57:22] and the man that murdered his son
[1:57:26] oh my listen to it again
[1:57:29] with an open heart
[1:57:31] and he went down
[1:57:33] and looked back in that cage
[1:57:38] like a cage in an animal
[1:57:40] he saw his little skinny body laying
[1:57:42] back there in the corner crying
[1:57:44] his face was sunk in
[1:57:47] his jaw set back
[1:57:49] his eyes way back
[1:57:53] was in his head
[1:57:55] and his mouth
[1:57:56] was white whited over
[1:57:58] no water thirsty laying there back on
[1:58:01] his face crying
[1:58:02] the king said stand up
[1:58:07] and he come up to him and he looked at
[1:58:10] him
[1:58:11] and said
[1:58:12] why did you kill my son
[1:58:16] now i hope you're typing this
[1:58:17] spiritually here
[1:58:20] why did why what did my son do to you
[1:58:25] what did he do to merit such a death as
[1:58:28] you killed him
[1:58:29] stabbing him to death with a spear
[1:58:32] oh what our lord went through
[1:58:35] if you know what he suffered and what he
[1:58:37] went through
[1:58:40] that's why
[1:58:41] i love him so much
[1:58:43] he said nothing my lord
[1:58:46] not one thing
[1:58:48] just my own selfishness
[1:58:51] just my own ways
[1:58:53] i killed him because i was jealous of
[1:58:54] him
[1:58:56] and i got a temper fit and i killed him
[1:59:00] now i'm to die under your justice sir
[1:59:03] i realize that
[1:59:06] and i deserve
[1:59:07] to do it
[1:59:09] and i deserve it
[1:59:12] it's like us my brothers and sisters
[1:59:14] we deserve hell we don't deserve all
[1:59:17] this goodness
[1:59:19] we don't
[1:59:21] until you recognize that and realize
[1:59:22] that you can't have the gratitude in
[1:59:24] your heart and the love of the heart for
[1:59:26] what god has really done for us
[1:59:28] we don't deserve it
[1:59:34] i am
[1:59:36] i am crying for that
[1:59:38] i'm just sorry that i killed a royal man
[1:59:41] like that
[1:59:42] without a cause
[1:59:45] the king turned on his heels and walked
[1:59:47] out
[1:59:48] went down to the desk and said
[1:59:50] destroy
[1:59:52] all the records
[1:59:54] i don't know what made him do that
[1:59:57] what made him do that

[2:00:23] to the prison
[2:00:24] cell oh my

[2:00:39] daughter

[2:00:44] with me
[2:00:45] to the palace
[2:00:47] put the king's robe around his shoulders
[2:00:50] the holy spirit

[2:00:56] because he had pity that's grace
[2:01:00] that was me that was you
[2:01:02] we killed the son of god with our sins
[2:01:05] we're alieated dirty filthy lying in the

[2:01:14] own son cleansed us put the robe of the
[2:01:17] holy spirit around us and now the great
[2:01:20] chariot of god will come back to the

[2:02:03] he is good and all-powerful
[2:02:06] when we by faith get to know him
[2:02:09] in who he really is
[2:02:12] then our prayer life will be about him
[2:02:15] and his kingdom
