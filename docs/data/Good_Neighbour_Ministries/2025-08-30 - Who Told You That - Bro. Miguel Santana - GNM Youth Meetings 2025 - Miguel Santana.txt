Lord Jesus, we wanted to say thank you to you because if there is a New Testament church coming up, if because of your love, if because of your grace, if because of the work of the Holy Ghost inside of us. So we want to give you all the glory, all the praise belong to you, Jesus. Thank you for this moment. Bless your word. Bless the vessel that you're going to use this morning. I yield myself completed to you, Lord. Because those people around here, your children didn't come to hurt a man to come to hear from you, Lord. So put aside the men and let the Holy Ghost work around us. &gt;&gt; Bless us this morning in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. We're going to take Bible and Genesis 3. Genesis 3 from verse 7 to 11. Amen. Genesis 3. Amen. And the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sit live together and made themselves apron. And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden and the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid himself them themselves from the presence of the Lord God amount the tree of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam and say unto Adam, Where thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself. And he said, Who told thee that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof commanded thee that thou should shouldn't not eat? We will ask the Holy Ghost to bless the reading of his word. In the name of Jesus, you can be seated. Amen. Before I start, I wanted to say thank you to brother Danny. You know, from the first moment I meet this man, this man had a kindness that you don't see too often in other men. I wanted to thank Jesus Christ for the kindness the brother that had with me with my you with the people of God. I wanted to say thank you, brother Danny. Thank you for your love. Thank you for your patient. Amen. Thank you. I wanted to thank the whole team of brother Danny because I know this is a hard job to make it happen. So may the Lord richly bless you. Amen. And I wanted to thank Jesus Christ my Lord to give me this opportunity to talk to his family to his children this morning and to share Pope with my bro Kadix. It's a joy for me. Amen. I believe like last week we were together in Canada and Montreal and we were talking about those meeting. We say you know that we feel the Lord that something special is going to happen this weekend and it's already started last night and it's going to continue this morning and it's going to continue the whole weekend. &gt;&gt; So let's be under expectation. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Now we can see that before they fell, Adam Allah and Eve used to live in a perfect relationship with God. And the key to that relationship was to remain on the word. The day you get out of the word, the day you die and brother Brandon say that we are in the same position. Those two tree is in front of us. Every morning we wake up, we have to choose to live by the word of God or to live by the other tree. And we all know what it is. So it was a condition, it was an agreement for the relationship to stay under perfect condition, a perfect harmony. They have to stay on the word of God. &gt;&gt; And my soldier this morning is, who told you that? And you know the prophet of God say that God never changed. He's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And for the family of God to have a perfect harmony with God, they have to stay on the word &gt;&gt; is going to be the same thing for us. Because there's only one place where go where God can meet men &gt;&gt; is in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the word of God is the mechanic of the harmony of relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there was another voice apart from God boys in the garden. And we all know that's the voice of the serpent. And when they identify themselves with the older boys, amen, the fellowship cut off. &gt;&gt; The life changed dra drastically. But you see they have to put aside God word first &gt;&gt; before they accept certain unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have a decision to make to break fellowship to break relationship with God. &gt;&gt; If we stay on the word, if we stay behind God, &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our strength. &gt;&gt; If we remain behind God, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan can do nothing. &gt;&gt; As long we can stay on the word, God's going to fight for us. &gt;&gt; God is going to be the head that keep captain, &gt;&gt; amen, of our life. how long we stand behind the word. &gt;&gt; And by staying behind the word, that's going to make a harmony, a relationship with God. &gt;&gt; And that's what we desire. &gt;&gt; That's what the the the the biggest desire that a Christian has is to be in harmony with God. &gt;&gt; Oh, that make it all for us. &gt;&gt; You know, when we do things that the Holy Ghost didn't like, we feel sad. &gt;&gt; We feel, you know, like condemned. We feel like we we we were about to die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when we fix the the mistake and then we we have the relationship back with God, we are in joy. &gt;&gt; We are happy. &gt;&gt; We dance. &gt;&gt; We say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think going to need your amen this morning. Amen. [Applause] So they used to be imperfection waiting on the Lord depending on the Lord. Amen. They they were bel by the holyness of the Holy Ghost. They couldn't see per perversion. They couldn't sing as long they stay behind the word. They were gods having control over creation. They said it like this. They were living in a kuna matata land. &gt;&gt; Now you all laugh, huh? &gt;&gt; Now you all get it. What? What did that mean? &gt;&gt; It mean no worries. &gt;&gt; No worries. &gt;&gt; For the rest of their day &gt;&gt; as long they stay behind the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the same is the same thing for us. We can live in a hakuna matata land and be in joy as long we stay behind the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will take care of everything. And he's so faithful. When we fail, he is still there &gt;&gt; to help us to come back. &gt;&gt; That's his redeeming love for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love God. &gt;&gt; But when they identify themselves with the other boys, they find themselves naked. religious, &gt;&gt; afraid, &gt;&gt; and condemned. &gt;&gt; And that when God come to the scene and ask them, "Who told you that &gt;&gt; that you were naked?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who told you that you were naked? &gt;&gt; That mean you did something that I told you not to do. &gt;&gt; You open your heart to someone that I told you don't do it. And you know as a young people you heard father parents say don't do that don't do that don't do that and sometime we take it as a how how can I say as a reproach &gt;&gt; but it's not a reproach it to keep you safe young people the same love that God have for his children is the same love that us parent have for you now &gt;&gt; and one day you're going to be in their side &gt;&gt; feeling the same thing that we feel when we tell you not to do things. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's one working &gt;&gt; for you to make mistake, for you to go h against the commandment of God. And we know that exciting. But listen, just by open their heart to the other boys is the only two boys. God boys, Satan boys. Just by open their heart to the other boys that break the relationship. &gt;&gt; I want you to get it. They were in harmony in perfect harmony. But as long they accept it, as long they identify themsel with the other boys, &gt;&gt; that break the harmony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes 10 verse 12 and 13 the word of God say the word of a wise man and we know who is the wise man is God Jesus Christ mount are gratches. Amen. But the leaf of a fool will swallow up himself. The beginning of the word of his mouth is foolishness and the end of his talk is misuous madness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's clear. &gt;&gt; It's clear the voice of God is grace. Grace. &gt;&gt; And what is grace in us? Is love &gt;&gt; and faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Grace is love and faithfulness. From us to God. That's why I always tell my young people before you starting to discard about doctrine and all of those stuff, God get grace before. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; Because if you're starting to to get into doctrine, oh my, you're going to have a full package of law. &gt;&gt; You need grace. You need Jesus. &gt;&gt; You need Jesus. &gt;&gt; You need Jesus. &gt;&gt; I love the message last night that that that that the Holy Ghost want to clean your heart &gt;&gt; to put Jesus in front. &gt;&gt; Cuz my preaching is just the continuation of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God put us in the good position last night so we can move forward this morning. Oh my. Oh my. &gt;&gt; So the voice of God is a voice of grace. &gt;&gt; The only the only uh let let me say it like that. The only way to save this world is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What we have to accept the love and faith and we have to accept the grace and that will transform love and faithfulness and faithfulness for God. Amen. But if you said the other one is a foolishness. I want you to get it young people because sometime Satan come inside of us giving us idea and we think that we are smart &gt;&gt; and that's part of of it making mistake because by those mistake you're going to learn how to serve God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So nobody have to feel condemned now about it because there is grace in this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so we need to be careful to who we open our heart to &gt;&gt; because every word is a seed. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter if it come from God or if it come from Satan. As long you identify yourself with that seed, it will produce in your life whatever is in that seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not that that because you have the Holy Ghost, you you you like like automatically you're going to block Satan. No, no, no, no. If you are set, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; It will materialize in your life. &gt;&gt; So, we need to be careful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will come a reality in our life. It doesn't matter from where it come from. It come from God or if come from Satan. Now I remember when I have when I was 14 years old. I didn't have the Holy Ghost at that time. But I love God. I love to go to church. You know, I had a good connection with God. I just love to go to church to sing to be there to be a part of the church. No, I was only 14 years old. But someone in my family got yellows and then I remember one Saturday morning, it was a reading day. He come to me and told me, "Oh, you think you're special? Oh, you think just because you go to church, you're this, you're that. And he start telling me so many things, bad things to break my relationship with God. &gt;&gt; And I made the mistake to open my heart to those seed. &gt;&gt; And you know what happened? Does seed become a reality in my life? I started to go to church now. I started to be cold, &gt;&gt; warm, starchy, &gt;&gt; not singing anymore. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And when father, you know what happened? I quit church. But I want you to understand I have to accept that to break the harmony that I have with God. &gt;&gt; It's always the same pattern. &gt;&gt; Same pattern, brother. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to go. in the same trial that I went through. &gt;&gt; Because you see, at that time, I was only 13, 14 years old. I didn't have the Holy Ghost. I didn't have someone over me watching me on my spiritual life like you young guys have now. I didn't have all of that. But this morning, the Holy Ghost is right here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he he can ask you, &gt;&gt; "Who told you that?" &gt;&gt; If you feel warm this morning, who told you that? &gt;&gt; That wasn't me. &gt;&gt; If you feel sick this morning, who told you that? [Music] &gt;&gt; What seed did you believe? &gt;&gt; Because there is no sickness in God. No. And God is only healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if this morning you feel sad, who told you that? [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; It because you take you identify yourself &gt;&gt; with the enemy. We're supposed to be enjoying dancing, shouting the Lord. Amen. Right now, because he's here, we are here to manifest God, to glorify God. But if you sitting, you share, you're sad, you're sick, who call you that? &gt;&gt; Cuz that ain't God. &gt;&gt; Sickness doesn't come from God. Sadness doesn't come from God. &gt;&gt; Come church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being warm, &gt;&gt; being cold, not saying amen. Come on, bro. I need that. big a bigger one [Applause] starting to come in church. You know there was a time that we were in joy. Yeah. Let's go to church. Let's sing. Let's do this. &gt;&gt; But suddenly &gt;&gt; you become warm, &gt;&gt; cold, touching. &gt;&gt; Who told you that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because in the presence of God &gt;&gt; staticness &gt;&gt; is not welcome. &gt;&gt; That mean that you have another relationship. [Music] &gt;&gt; That mean that you having harmony with the other one. [Music] Oh my my my my my my my &gt;&gt; people feeling depressed &gt;&gt; and depression of the Lord. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; There is joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is joys in this atmosphere. [Music] &gt;&gt; By that we can discern &gt;&gt; that we having a relationship with Satan. Come on. &gt;&gt; By our fruits. &gt;&gt; Jesus said to discern &gt;&gt; by our fruits. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my myraise. &gt;&gt; People &gt;&gt; feeling separate from God. But let me tell you something. There is power. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. Amen. and the blood of Jesus. [Applause] There is power in the blood of Christ &gt;&gt; to restore our relationship. &gt;&gt; We don't have to stay in that condition. &gt;&gt; No, no. God clean our heart. &gt;&gt; He got a go to by doing that last night. is because he want to restore the relationship that he had before with you guys. [Music] &gt;&gt; So if the is the pillar of fire is a movement. We have to move the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; We cannot stay behind. No, no. When he move, we move. &gt;&gt; So this morning, let's move forward &gt;&gt; to a relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my my my my my God want us you young people to open your heart to the word &gt;&gt; so he can establish himself to make us he living word &gt;&gt; you see the whole problem with God is to manifest himself &gt;&gt; among us &gt;&gt; that's main God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So coming to church, preaching the word, sing song, leading everything that you can do for God and that if that word don't manifest in your life, &gt;&gt; you ain't doing nothing. &gt;&gt; Somebody is telling you so a lie &gt;&gt; because the end the the the the goal of God is to manifest himself &gt;&gt; through us. Amen. In Romans 12, my my verse one the Bible say, "Therefore I urge you brothers and sister and beauty of God mercy to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, &gt;&gt; holy and pleasing to God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. to offer your body as a living sacrifice pleasing totally and pleasing to God. So come into the presence of the Lord with a clean heart and yield yourself without a plan B &gt;&gt; or let me say it like this &gt;&gt; without a condition. Hey, come on. That's right. Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's the and be okay. That's the pleasant team to God. God is going to be pleased. &gt;&gt; Please. And us if we doing that, &gt;&gt; if we come to his present without a condition &gt;&gt; without a a a plan B, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, if it doesn't work today, it's going to work tonight. If it don't, &gt;&gt; no, no. God want us to hear ourself &gt;&gt; completed &gt;&gt; from top to the bottom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything surrender &gt;&gt; to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you know, young people, it is time. I've been watching you for years and years, but it's time to come to the presence of the Lord &gt;&gt; without nothing matter. I don't care who beside me. &gt;&gt; I just come &gt;&gt; to yield myself to the Lord. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter &gt;&gt; what other people say &gt;&gt; because when you when that matter to you, that mean you have a open channel &gt;&gt; to listen what the other guy have to say. &gt;&gt; God want you to close that channel. Come to his presence and y yourself completed to him. We can do that. Young people, you know, just forget about everything. &gt;&gt; You want to shout, you shout, you want to say amen, you say amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. This is a party. This is a party. You don't go to a party and then you you say on the like that. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. When I used to go to the party from the beginning to the end, I was dancing. But not for death, not for the devil. Now that I am for Christ, when I come to his church, I said from the beginning to the end because he become my reality. Now he become my leader. Now he become everything. Nothing else. Only Jesus. Only Jesus. We are here for Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. I don't care how I dress. I don't care how you look. I just come here to praise my God. Amen. Amen. Amen. It is time for us. But nothing else matter on the side of Jesus. He's the one that paid the price. He is the one that give us joy. He is the one that save our soul. All the glory belong to him. Let's close that channel. But here we have the chance to tell you something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we are the word. &gt;&gt; We live by the word. &gt;&gt; You are the spreading word of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; If Jesus was 76 years old sitting in the chair this morning, he will be saying [Applause] &gt;&gt; he was 12 years old and he went to church and every time the priest say something about the word he say &gt;&gt; come on. He wasn't sitting there just looking. &gt;&gt; There was something that Jesus was doing this that got the attraction of those priests. &gt;&gt; So if you want to catch the attraction of the Holy Ghost, let's say &gt;&gt; oh my [Applause] hallelujah. This is your true &gt;&gt; and proper worship. &gt;&gt; See we when we worship normally we sing, we dance, we shout. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; But a real proper worship is a real relationship &gt;&gt; with God. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's make it clear, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; You can shout, you can dance, &gt;&gt; you can say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; But if you don't have that connection with God, &gt;&gt; they say you to make a something I don't know how to say it, but you know your worship is not complete. It have to be complete &gt;&gt; your whole being &gt;&gt; yielded to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A real relationship to the Lord is living in harmony in Christ Jesus. Listen, but remember soon as you identify yourself with Satan boys, it will cut your relationship. &gt;&gt; Why I'm coming back to that? Because we can see today Satan have so many tools &gt;&gt; to grab to to attract you attraction &gt;&gt; and put your focus on the thing of the word &gt;&gt; and evil things &gt;&gt; that is not necessary. &gt;&gt; You can pass three, four, five hour in the cell phone &gt;&gt; or watching something on YouTube. &gt;&gt; You understand that? is Satan calling you e you worship to to the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The real worship. The real worship is a real relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. &gt;&gt; It's more than singing. &gt;&gt; It's more than shouting. &gt;&gt; It's a harmony. &gt;&gt; Everything goes together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Do not conform to the pattern of the word." &gt;&gt; Young people, you will never fix yourself on the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to feel bad. You're going to feel in the bad moment movement. You're going to feel all the all kind of way, but you won't feel good. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there is a seed inside of you. &gt;&gt; Crying aba father &gt;&gt; crying. I want worship. &gt;&gt; I want the real worship. That mean I want the real relationship with God. &gt;&gt; The seed inside of you is a problem. to worship God &gt;&gt; but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. &gt;&gt; He was saying last night reading the prophet that Satan take control of your mind. &gt;&gt; But God take control of your heart. If God can have the fullness of your heart, your mind will become Christ mind. &gt;&gt; So don't try the fight thought by thought. No no no no. Surrender yourself to Christ &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost will fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know there is things like 10 years ago I used to discuss. &gt;&gt; Mhm. Today &gt;&gt; many of those thing I don't cause them &gt;&gt; because they have no sense &gt;&gt; and you know as sons of God we have to be to come to to a place where there are things that we don't have to discuss with the enemy. &gt;&gt; We have just to let that cause he left off. That's why that's why the the the word of God is a how do you say it's a sword &gt;&gt; anytime that come it off cut it off cut it off &gt;&gt; because you have taste &gt;&gt; the better is the better was and the better that will be &gt;&gt; nothing will be better than Jesus Jesus. &gt;&gt; When you taste Jesus, nothing else will never have that taste. &gt;&gt; So why us like as young people want to spend our time with those things? Just cut it off. &gt;&gt; Just cut it off. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost doesn't come to to come to you and ask you, "Who told you that? [Applause] He say then you will be able to test and approve that what God will is his good pleasing and perfect will. So let's say it like this. More of God we have, more discernment we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; More discernment we have, &gt;&gt; more able more we are able to approve what is good, acceptable and perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. And more discernment that we have on the will of God, less chance &gt;&gt; the devil has against us &gt;&gt; to break the relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what do we need young people? We already have Christ. &gt;&gt; What do we need now? is is to surrender ourself y ourself to Christ for him to full of to us of his holy ghost or his word &gt;&gt; because he is the chip captain and our soul to defeat the enemy &gt;&gt; the enemy can't fight you because you you are trying to do it by yourself &gt;&gt; let me ask you a question let make it clear &gt;&gt; do you think Satan fight God. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. &gt;&gt; You know, I heard so many Christian said, "Oh, I'm fighting the devil. I'm &gt;&gt; preaching. &gt;&gt; Good luck. &gt;&gt; You're fighting the devil." &gt;&gt; They don't say, "I'm fighting a bad angel or a evil angel." No, I'm fighting the dead. Good luck. &gt;&gt; There is only one &gt;&gt; that can defeat the enemy like that. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So more of God, more of the message, more of the revelation of the message &gt;&gt; you have on your heart, more you're going to close the door to the enemy. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To don't let him the space to tell you something. Yeah. &gt;&gt; More of God you have, the least space &gt;&gt; the Satan will have &gt;&gt; against you. &gt;&gt; See, it's like, but this just went to my house last week and you know, we were eating. Say, bro, it's hard to have a I have a diet here. Cuz you know we eat, we drink, you know. And what would I want to say? If you hungry and then you eat, you fool. And then 3 minutes ago someone come to tell you you want to eat something, you will say no, &gt;&gt; I'm full. &gt;&gt; I'm satisfied. Come on, &gt;&gt; preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know there is a lot of people on the message they say, "Oh, we need more to go to church. We need more day with." What we need is the relationship. What we need is more revelation of the hour. &gt;&gt; What we need is to come to church with a positive attitude. The prophet of God said the only thing that God need is a positive attitude. &gt;&gt; He will do the rest. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come come to church &gt;&gt; to have church to say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; That's that's what we need people. &gt;&gt; But we have people, you know, sitting on the bed for 20, 30, 40, 50 years. the same people in the same chair &gt;&gt; and they they the same church &gt;&gt; with the same fist filter. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's why brother D was say something so important last night. Us as parent we need to connect &gt;&gt; we are our children's &gt;&gt; we are our young people &gt;&gt; because by connecting by having relationship with them we can help them &gt;&gt; but if we stand behind just criticize &gt;&gt; who told you come on &gt;&gt; I praise the Holy Ghost next time you're going to criticize someone in church. The Holy Ghost come in your mind and tell you who told you. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; That doesn't come from God. &gt;&gt; Anything that you are say that doesn't come to from God, the Holy Ghost will ask you the same question. &gt;&gt; Who told you that? We need to come to church ready to receive. &gt;&gt; Come on, man. &gt;&gt; Come on, man. &gt;&gt; We need to put ourself in that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; We need to do it. Young people, &gt;&gt; you know, every time that God has a revival verdicts, God never call old people. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. people, old people, they they got too used to &gt;&gt; the pattern. &gt;&gt; But every time that God want to bring a revival, he use the young people. &gt;&gt; Come on, young people. &gt;&gt; They have a revival this weekend. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's the old people how we worship, how we say. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] Oh my. Oh my my my my my prophet of God say. God provided approach to divine fellowship. Oh don't you never lost that? If you ever lost that to a place where you get ashamed to go into relationship with Christ. Let him dwell in you. God, a man making himself known to the people by his spirit. &gt;&gt; That's relationship. &gt;&gt; God want relationship. &gt;&gt; God clear your heart last night because he had a goal to have relationship with you today. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God want relationship. God want us to come at church and be you know we say you know I'm on the huh impetation. &gt;&gt; Expectation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're on the impetation. You're sitting in your chair like that. &gt;&gt; Expecting what? Come on. &gt;&gt; When I am under obitation, I'm under how you say those people that you know when they need drugs, they're like that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If I'm on, I'm like that. &gt;&gt; Where is the Holy Ghost? Where is the Holy Ghost? Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh. Let's [Applause] stop relation is not relationship. Religion is not relationship. God doesn't want religion. And we we come to religious. God want relationship. God want a young group to come to church and say amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We become too religious. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on people. &gt;&gt; We are here to party. &gt;&gt; This is a body. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. The amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. God want to feel you. &gt;&gt; You people follow his love. &gt;&gt; Divine love. &gt;&gt; Divine grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What will you accept? It could be or a things that's not eternal when you are eternal. Come on young people. Let's open our heart to God &gt;&gt; to the revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That what God want. &gt;&gt; The only thing God want is you to open your heart to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I say it's a body. So when the Holy Ghost say something, you say, "Amen." It's like, you know, when people use tango, you know, they go in the same movement. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is a savior. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is a healer. &gt;&gt; We are dancing with the spirit. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's about it. There's a bad about having church. &gt;&gt; It's not only to teach you some doctrine. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it's to have fellowship, to have relationship with God, you know. My my the prophet of God said the basis of fellowship and that what was the matter with the church today they got a chain face if you can catch my parable they don't want that relationship with God they rather have some stall former starchy organization say I am preisterian I am mystery I am this I am As long you belong to something, somebody begott you. &gt;&gt; If you belong to something outside of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; you just deceive as Eve was. &gt;&gt; We don't believe to a church. &gt;&gt; We believe we belong to Jesus Christ. And by belonging to Jesus Christ, we are a part of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh man, the message didn't come to make us ashamed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can see young people now they have the Bible on the cell phone. &gt;&gt; I don't have nothing against that. But let me see. Let me ask you a question. When you go to church, when you go to park to play football, do you have your football ball on yourself? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Okay, now let's play. &gt;&gt; Take the ball out of yourself. Who told you those things? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Who told you the switch &gt;&gt; or your Bible? &gt;&gt; Be proud &gt;&gt; of your Bible. &gt;&gt; Be proud of the message. &gt;&gt; You know, they can pass three, four hour reading a romantic book. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; You can ask them, "What was the last time that you read a message book?" &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Who told you to switch it? &gt;&gt; That wasn't the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. This message young people don't come to make us a new organization. &gt;&gt; This message come to bring us back &gt;&gt; to the real joy &gt;&gt; of the word of God &gt;&gt; to the real Pentecost &gt;&gt; where people were tiding you know they were so excited they were they were speaking in another tongue. &gt;&gt; That's right. But we got so used to that we speak in another tongue but not with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You know we come a church and we talk this language. [Music] &gt;&gt; You preaching in another tongue &gt;&gt; but not by the Holy Ghost. This message come to bring us back to reality. &gt;&gt; Not the church prediction. We don't want the church tradition. &gt;&gt; We don't want religion. God want relationship. God want you guys to come and be free to shout, to sing, to glorify his name. Feel free people. You don't have to feel worried. You don't have to feel sad. You don't have to feel depressed. Who told you that? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is telling you who told you that he want you to be in joy, to be jumping, to be amen. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what he want. You imagine Jesus Christ sitting on his throne saying in the to the angel this morning, you know what? I'm going to make a movement. Where you going, Lord? I'm going to Toronto. &gt;&gt; Why? Oh, there is a party downstairs. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And maybe you're saying, "No, that can't happen, Brother Miguel. Who told you that? [Applause] Because angel Gabrielle, Angel Miguel, any angel cannot worship the way I worship my Lord. They never be lost. They never been sick. They never knew what his grace mean to me. So when I watching my love, we all is in me. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's here. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's here. &gt;&gt; Oh man. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember this when we used to be young. You know the there was a party going on, we just by hearing the sound of the music, we can say, "Oh my, this is a good party." Come on. When the the the the when the Holy Ghost his young people say, relationship people. It's time to come back. It's time to get out of that one situation that we have. It's time to say amen to the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. We can go go. By then you got the message. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on man. &gt;&gt; Come on guys. &gt;&gt; We can continue on. But the bottom line is God want relationship. &gt;&gt; Let's let aside our tradition, our world, our sickness. No, &gt;&gt; no, no, no, no. Let's heal our self completed. to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is our Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's do it. &gt;&gt; Let's make this party happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He clean our heart.

Every day that I live, Lord, I love you more. [Music] Amen. Praise God. You may be seated for a moment. You know, I was writing some notes and I thought, you know what? I was going to maybe share this this evening, but I thought we've got some time right now. We're in the presence of the Lord. We've just had a wonderful time. Let's just let's just uh stay and and maybe just, you know, pull a little bit more on the Holy Spirit and see what it is. And you know the thing that uh that's on my heart is last night we heard you know our brother diggs and he brought the scripture from the book of Ezekiel where he said that I will put I will I will give you a new heart. &gt;&gt; I will restore your heart. Amen. And he also said I will put my spirit in you. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice that he said I'll put my spirit in you. Now, you know, um I believe that, you know, there's a bit of confusion these days about, you know, receiving the Holy Ghost because people want to talk about, you know, well, I need to receive the Holy Ghost. But, you know, sometimes there's a a misconception on what the Holy Ghost actually is. And so I believe that, you know, you being here this weekend and as we go into the service this evening, uh, you know, I I'd like to place some thoughts in your heart to just place you under the right expectation. Amen. Because we've all heard uh you know about the process that justification makes way for sanctification and then sanctification makes way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But what you heard brother Miguel talking about here today when he said making Jesus personal to you, he was talking about the process by which the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And I thank God that he sent a prophet to tell us that the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way for the Holy Ghost himself, &gt;&gt; the person of the word. Amen. Because that's what this is really all about. When you hear, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" Like Paul when he came across those disciples, they were praising God. They were worshiping God. They were having church based on what they were told by the Apostle John, by by John the Baptist. They were praising God. But then he said, "But have you received the Holy Ghost?" And they said, "We've not heard [Music] You said what? And immediately he baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus and they all received the Holy Ghost. It's because he made Jesus personal to them. He introduced them to Christ himself. Amen. And so it's not just the spirit on you. We've we've read it in Joel 2:28. I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. That means it's going to go on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; We want to know the personal Jesus &gt;&gt; who changes everything. &gt;&gt; He's the one that tells us who we really are. Amen. Praise God. So this is the age that we receive the very person of Jesus Christ. Not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You can get baptism after baptism. You can come to youth camp after youth camp. You can come into the anointing and you think that that's it. I can leave now and everything's going to be fine and and and my life is going to change from this moment on. Not if you haven't met the person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You need the person. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to know why he's coming to you. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose why he wants to come to you. Young people, you desire, your desire will completely change when you've met him. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, the attraction will be to the word. &gt;&gt; This is the evidence of the Holy Ghost. It's not signs and wonders. It's not sensations. It's not speaking in tongues. It's not getting all excited in those ways, but it's when you are instantly attracted to the word. All of a sudden, you God sent a prophet. Is that right? The opening of the seals, the open book, the seven thunders, all those things now start to attract your attention because it's the word for your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The purpose of God, which is the word for your day, is for him to come into you personally. And now all of a sudden, you're not attracted by those things of the evil one that told you, &gt;&gt; who told you those things? You see, but when the person comes, he takes control. He's now got he's got he's got rulership over your life. All of your all of your motives start to change. All of your goals start to change. All of a sudden, when you're going to school, you've got a different approach to the way that you express yourself with your friends, with your teachers. They start to see a different you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's no longer you. &gt;&gt; It's now him in you. That's what Jesus said when he said on that day ye shall know. Ye shall know. And so the Holy Ghost is the person. We're not interested in baptisms. Yes, you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that it could give you the power to overcome because that's what the Holy Spirit is. When you receive the baptism, it gives you the ability to overcome the things in your life. And that's why you come into these meetings, you get under the anointing and you get you get that conviction in your heart now that you want to overcome because it's now him in you giving you that desire and the ability to overcome. Now you can go out and you can meet the challenges as a young person. &gt;&gt; You have the hardest age when they listen. when we get there and they're going to hear your testimony, you young people, you came out of Le Oysia. &gt;&gt; How could you have possibly come out of Le Oysia? Because greater was he that was in me &gt;&gt; than he that was in the world, the one that was telling me that I couldn't be a a a a a a person that could testify of Jesus Christ at at a young age as a teenager. Why? Who told you that? I'm telling you, the Holy Ghost has a purpose and desire to come in you. And before he can even come in you, he's he's already known you. [Music] &gt;&gt; I knew you from before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be under the right the word for the day and the me and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost comes to you as an individual in order to fulfill his purpose. &gt;&gt; Remember that. So all of a sudden if his purpose comes into you, you're going to you're you're going to have overcoming power in you automatically. Sanctification is automatic. It's going to start to push out the things in your life. That's why you hear testimonies. And I'm one of them. I was a drug addict for 13 years and came into one service where something changed in my heart. I didn't realize. I didn't understand it. &gt;&gt; But the day that I went and when I went to my pastor, I said, "I want the Holy Ghost." He looked at me. He said, "Brother, you got the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; It started to work already &gt;&gt; because it's something that you don't try to do. I never tried. I knew I wanted the deliverance from the from the drug addiction, but I couldn't do it. But in one day, he took me. He baptized me. When I came out of that tank, all I can tell you is that the desire, all the pull of that drug, and it was a cocaine drug addiction that I'm telling you, you you I I've know the power of that addiction. And when that power was broken, that wasn't something that I could do. Oh, Danny, did you go to a rehab? What happened? Did you go to a rehab? I said, "Yeah, the church of the living God, the power of Jesus Christ to do it instantly." Not not something that I had to try and do. Listen, I'm telling you, I know you've got a lot of people come up here last night. You'll come up maybe tonight. You've got something in your heart. I'm telling you, if it's your time, you will be delivered. &gt;&gt; And you will know that you are delivered. You will know that that it's not your power, but it's the power of the resurrected Christ. Amen. Christ, your hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 says, "All things work together." I never understood how powerful that scripture was until I walk with God for 31 years. I'm not just walking for a couple of years. &gt;&gt; I'm walking 31 years. You think that I'm mistake free since the day I came out of that baptismal tank? No sir. I've made a lot of mistakes and I'll probably still make some. &gt;&gt; And you're a liar if you if you tell me you don't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the purpose of God, the attribute of God that's in you that gets called at that time, that purpose will take over and it'll override all of your mistakes, all of your problems, all of your oppression, all the depression that the enemy tries to put on you. It'll just wipe it out. &gt;&gt; That's the expectation that you should be under this weekend. It's different. Amen. Glory to God. And then you'll realize that all things, whatever they are, work for good to them that are called to those that are to receive the Holy Ghost person of Jesus Christ in their day. That's what you become, a carrier of this word, the purpose of God in this day and in this hour. Amen. All that was in the Father, he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, he poured into the church. &gt;&gt; Get ready. &gt;&gt; God is up to something. &gt;&gt; And you're going to be a part of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you. We're going to have a word of prayer and then we're going to dismiss you and I promise you, you're going to have a feast. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only did you get to feast on the word this morning, last night, you're going to get to feast now. And I know that you had a, you know, those that were here last night, we had a wonderful spread by the grace of God. Good food, fellowship. We even got our own ice cream parlor. I said, I come out there, I said, "Is that an ice cream parlor?" Glory to God. Can God spread a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a table in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; This ain't a wilderness, saints. This is this is something greater. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. So, we want to thank God and you're going to be uh uh I'm trusting that you're going to be immensely blessed as the word continues to unveil itself tonight to us. Amen. And so, I'm going to I'm going to uh you know what? I want a young person to commute. Come on, young man. Praise God. You speak English. Hallelujah.
