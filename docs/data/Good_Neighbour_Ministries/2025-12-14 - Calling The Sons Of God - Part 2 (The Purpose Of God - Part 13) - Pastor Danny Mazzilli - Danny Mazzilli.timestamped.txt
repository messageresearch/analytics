[37:19] course brother Christopher and sister
[37:21] Farita, grandma and grandpa. And um and
[37:25] also Rodney Mohan, that's Candace's
[37:27] grandfather. Amen. Uh Rose Fernandez,
[37:31] Calvin's grandmother. Amen. Welcome into
[37:34] the house of the Lord this morning. Um
[37:37] Ann Nia's aunts, uncles, great aunts,
[37:39] great uncles. Wow. Praise God. We've got
[37:42] uh the whole family here to support um
[37:45] the family in the dedication of their
[37:48] beautiful little girl. Amen. Let's read
[37:50] the scripture from Matthew. Let's all
[37:52] stand for a moment.
[37:54] Uh we're going to be um brief, but we
[37:57] want to just, you know, bring some
[37:59] thoughts here as we uh dedicate this
[38:01] child. I believe that um you know the
[38:03] Lord uh is mindful of every uh desire of
[38:08] a mother and father especially uh when
[38:11] they bring their children before God. In
[38:13] Matthew chapter 19 13 to 14 it said then
[38:17] were there brought unto him Jesus
[38:21] little children that he should put his
[38:23] hands on them and pray and the and and
[38:27] notice here the disciples rebuke them.
[38:31] You know uh you know the the people you
[38:33] know it just goes to show you they they
[38:35] they always thinking that that children
[38:37] are going to be trouble. You know oh
[38:39] here they come they want to cause
[38:40] trouble. No, no. The Lord knew his
[38:43] children. Amen. God knows the future of
[38:47] every one of his children. Amen. That's
[38:49] why he was God. But Jesus said, "Suffer
[38:52] the little children and forbid them not
[38:55] to come unto me because he's making it
[38:59] very clear here. For such is the kingdom
[39:02] of heaven." If you can't be simple and
[39:06] and humble and be willing to uh you know
[39:10] make yourself as little children before
[39:12] God, then
[39:15] are you really part of the kingdom of
[39:16] God? Amen. Praise God. And so, um we're
[39:21] very happy today that uh you know,
[39:23] dedication is something that brings new
[39:25] life. God bless you. God bless you,
[39:29] brother. Amen. Welcome, Calvin. Candace.
[39:32] Amen. Mom, mom and dad, sister Anita,
[39:35] brother Brian. Amen. Sister Farita.
[39:39] All right. So, dedication is something
[39:42] that bring You may be seated. Thank you.
[39:45] Everybody just have your seats. We'll
[39:46] just be a few minutes. We want to share
[39:48] some thoughts. It's something that
[39:50] brings new life into the family. Every
[39:52] time there's a child that comes into the
[39:54] house of the Lord, it's new life. Amen.
[39:58] And it's also an opportunity for mom and
[40:00] dad to, you know, examine their own
[40:02] lives and to rededicate their lives
[40:05] because in order to really bring your
[40:07] children before God, you know, mom and
[40:10] dad, you need to have a relationship
[40:12] with God. Amen. And this is of utmost
[40:16] importance. Praise God. In Psalms 127:3,
[40:20] it says, "Lo, children are an heritage
[40:24] of the Lord." In other words, they're
[40:26] part of his heritage. Amen. God wanted a
[40:30] family. God desired to have a family to
[40:34] to have fellowship with his sons and his
[40:36] daughters. Amen. And the fruit of the
[40:40] womb is his reward.
[40:42] So what's the scripture telling us? That
[40:45] a child is a gift from God. The kind of
[40:48] gift you cannot give back to God in the
[40:51] way that people return material gifts.
[40:54] Amen. We're giving we're dedicating the
[40:57] child unto the Lord. You know, there's
[40:59] an illustration. Someone asked a lady
[41:01] one time, "Have you given your children
[41:03] to the Lord?" And she said, "I'd like to
[41:07] give them back, but I thought God had a
[41:09] no return policy on kids."
[41:13] Now, that's not the kind of dedication
[41:14] or the give back that we're talking
[41:16] about here this morning. Amen. We're
[41:19] talking about dedicating them unto the
[41:21] Lord. Amen. And if truth be known, it's
[41:24] not always going to be a child that
[41:26] smiles back at you and is so perfect and
[41:29] so pretty and so beautiful. They start
[41:31] to grow up. They start to get thoughts
[41:33] of their own. They start to express
[41:35] their own ideas. And guess what? It
[41:38] brings challenges to your life. A amen.
[41:41] They grow up. But thank God that we can
[41:44] dedicate them from this time in their
[41:47] lives because there's a promise that
[41:50] comes that if we dedicate our children
[41:52] unto the Lord and train them up in the
[41:55] way of the Lord, he says, "I'll be with
[41:57] them. I'll watch over them." Amen.
[42:00] Praise God. And so, uh, I'd like to just
[42:04] emphasize three points here as we go to
[42:07] this dedication
[42:09] of Anna. First,
[42:12] it's a co it's a confirmation of your
[42:14] love for God. Candace Calvin, you
[42:19] bringing Annayiah here today is a
[42:22] confirmation that you trust the Lord and
[42:25] that you love the Lord. Amen. And the
[42:27] first thing you're saying is when you
[42:29] give your child back to the Lord, it's
[42:32] simply this, that you love God even more
[42:35] than you love that child.
[42:37] because you're placing that child into
[42:40] God's hands.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; So, you better love him and trust him
[42:44] with all of your heart. Amen. Praise
[42:47] God. And your child is the most prized
[42:50] possession, but don't allow them to take
[42:55] place over God. That's why the the word
[42:58] says first the kingdom of God. Amen. We
[43:02] need to place him first and everything
[43:04] else follows. Jesus said in Matthew
[43:07] 10:37-38,
[43:09] "He that loveth father or mother more
[43:12] than me is not worthy of me. And he that
[43:17] loveth son or daughter more than me is
[43:20] not worthy of me.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And he that taketh not his cross and
[43:25] followeth after me is not worthy of me."
[43:30] &gt;&gt; So this is the first thing that we want
[43:33] to understand. Dedicating your child to
[43:35] God is a way of confirming that God is
[43:38] the first in your affections.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Dad and mom, the most important
[43:43] thing you can do for your child is to be
[43:46] an example of parents that love the
[43:49] Lord. Amen. As your highest priority in
[43:53] your life, you will always place the
[43:55] Lord. Amen. Glory to God. And second,
[44:01] we're giving our children to God. When
[44:04] we give our children to God, it's a
[44:05] clarification of ownership. We're giving
[44:08] them back to God because we're we're
[44:11] saying, "Lord, this is your child."
[44:14] &gt;&gt; He's the giver of all life. And we're
[44:17] acknowledging that this is your child.
[44:20] And so we are saying, Lord, thank you
[44:22] for this reward, but we are offering her
[44:26] life back to you as a as something that
[44:29] you can use for your glory. Amen. Praise
[44:33] God. When you give your child to God,
[44:34] you're openly declaring that your child
[44:37] is a gift from God.
[44:40] That your child does not really belong
[44:42] to you. That he or she belongs to God
[44:45] first.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you are given the
[44:50] responsibility to handle God's children.
[44:54] Amen. Glory to God. Psalms 127:3 puts it
[44:58] in this way. Children are a heritage and
[45:01] a gift. They are the fruit of the womb
[45:04] and it's his reward. Imagine this
[45:08] beautiful Anniah is a gift from God.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a miracle every time that God
[45:15] gives us. Now, if our children belong to
[45:18] God, then we're merely stewards of them.
[45:21] Amen. We'd better be careful how we
[45:24] treat them and care for God's property.
[45:27] When parents abuse their children
[45:29] physically or verbally, they're abusing
[45:32] what belongs to God, and God will judge
[45:35] them for that. That's one of the
[45:37] problems in this world today. Too many
[45:39] people don't understand the reward of a
[45:42] child coming into their lives and they
[45:44] don't properly care for their children.
[45:48] Children are God's heritage, not ours.
[45:50] So we have great responsibilities to
[45:53] love them, care for them, nurture them,
[45:55] teach them the way of the Lord. Protect
[45:58] them, discipline them, and tell them
[46:02] about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. and prepare them for
[46:08] a life of service for God and for
[46:10] others. And finally,
[46:13] third, it is a commitment to raise them
[46:16] up God's way. When we're dedicating our
[46:20] children, we're also saying we will
[46:22] raise them according to your word, Lord.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The underlying concept of nurture
[46:28] is structuring. This would mean
[46:30] discipline when it's needed. When uh it
[46:34] also covers the whole training
[46:36] experience whereby a parent structures a
[46:39] child's life instead of simply letting
[46:42] them do whatever they want, they place a
[46:45] level of discipline around their lives
[46:47] because we know that that provides
[46:49] protection for them.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So basically Paul says to bring
[46:54] your children up with structure and
[46:57] discipline on one hand and plenty of
[47:00] verbal exhortation, positive affirmation
[47:04] and uh you know uh instruction on the
[47:07] other. Amen. Counseling them as they
[47:10] grow up.
[47:12] So if we train up a child in the way of
[47:14] the Lord, Proverbs 22:6 says that uh in
[47:18] the way that he should go and when he is
[47:20] old, he will not depart from it. You
[47:24] train him up according to the word of
[47:26] God. Show him the path of the Lord, that
[47:28] child will eventually find their way
[47:31] back if they should stray. Amen. That's
[47:34] a promise of the Lord. Amen. So, at this
[47:37] time, I'd like to have you come to the
[47:40] front.
[47:43] I don't know if she's going to let me
[47:45] hold her,
[47:48] &gt;&gt; but I love holding little children.
[47:50] Hello.
[47:53] Hello, beautiful girl. Hello, Annayia.
[47:56] Praise God.
[47:59] You're beautiful. You're absolutely
[48:02] beautiful. Praise God. Let us pray.
[48:06] Amen. Father,
[48:08] what a privilege this morning, Lord,
[48:10] that we can stand before this audience,
[48:14] Lord, as witnesses of the desire of our
[48:18] precious brother Calvin and Sister
[48:20] Candace, Lord, to bring Anniah before
[48:23] you and to dedicate her unto you, oh
[48:26] God. Lord, it takes a village to raise a
[48:30] child. And Lord, we vow to stand as
[48:34] support
[48:35] and to be there whenever they would need
[48:38] us, Lord. Whether it be in prayer or in
[48:41] any way, Father, we stand as witnesses
[48:44] and we stand as uh Lord, security for
[48:48] our dear brother and sister and for this
[48:50] beautiful child. And Lord, as we lay
[48:53] hands upon them, oh God, we as Jesus
[48:56] laid his hands upon the children, Lord,
[48:59] we bless them and we ask your
[49:01] protection, your guidance, your wisdom,
[49:03] your direction. Lord, may angels encamp
[49:06] this little angel Anniah. Oh God, may
[49:09] you protect her every step of the way,
[49:12] Lord, as she begins to walk, as she
[49:14] begins to talk. Lord, may your anointing
[49:16] and may your spirit so protect and guide
[49:19] mom and dad. Watch over them, Lord. keep
[49:22] this family safe and Lord healthy and
[49:25] wealthy and Lord may your anointing just
[49:27] continue with them and may the spirit of
[49:30] revelation continue to direct and guide
[49:33] the father of the home to lead that home
[49:35] and to be a protector and a guide.
[49:37] Father, oh God, may the gentleness of a
[49:40] mother's love, Lord, so be expressed
[49:43] upon this child that she will she will
[49:45] display love
[49:47] &gt;&gt; in all of her ways and in the and even
[49:50] in her smiles, Father. Lord, we we just
[49:53] appreciate what you're doing for this
[49:55] family, Lord. Bless them, all of their
[49:57] family, Lord. Their mothers, their
[49:59] fathers, their grandmas, their aunts and
[50:01] uncles. Father, may you just pour out a
[50:03] blessing upon each one. Father, grant
[50:06] that we pray in the name of Jesus
[50:08] Christ. I dedicate Anniah unto you right
[50:11] now for your glory in Jesus name. Amen.
[50:15] And amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[50:20] Congratulations.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Congratulations.
[50:25] Let's give them a round of applause.
[50:34] Amen. Praise God.
[50:37] All right. Well, let's sing that song.
[50:40] Bring them in. We've brought them in.
[50:42] Let's sing that song now as they go and
[50:44] sit down. Let's sing it. Amen. Give me a
[50:47] key.
[50:49] Bring them in. Oh, bring them in.
[50:55] Bring them in from the fields of sin.

[51:36] Amen. Praise God. How many are looking
[51:39] forward to the dinner after the service
[51:41] today? Amen. We're going to have a our
[51:43] Christmas our family Christmas get
[51:45] together and dinner. Amen. And so we're
[51:48] looking forward to that. It starts uh
[51:50] the doors will be opening over there
[51:51] just after 3:00. Dinner will be served
[51:54] sometime around 4. Amen. And so we're
[51:57] looking forward to that. God bless you
[51:59] musicians. Thank you very much.
[52:02] Glory to God. And so, um, you know,
[52:06] we've got lots of time today. Uh, is
[52:08] anybody in a rush?
[52:11] Good. Good. Amen. Because we we'd like
[52:13] to just, you know, um bring what the
[52:16] Lord has laid upon our hearts. And I
[52:18] trust that somehow you will receive
[52:20] something that will uh allow you to
[52:22] leave here just a little stronger than
[52:24] when you came in. Uh maybe recognizing a
[52:27] little more that uh who you are and and
[52:30] Oh, praise God. Sister Sheila, God bless
[52:32] you. And and your sister's here with
[52:34] you. God bless you, sister. Welcome.
[52:37] Amen.
[52:40] Amen. Praise God. Welcome. Welcome.
[52:43] Praise God. And so, let's um let's let's
[52:45] change the order of the service. Let's
[52:47] just have a word of prayer. How many's
[52:48] got a need this morning? Say, "Lord,
[52:50] remember
[52:51] this that's on my heart. I know there's
[52:54] many. Let's Let's remember brother John
[52:57] Simon and Sister Desire. Uh they've got
[52:59] a bit of a flu. They're getting better.
[53:02] I was talking to him yesterday. He is
[53:04] feeling better, but not quite enough
[53:07] that that they could be with us today.
[53:09] So, we certainly want to remember them
[53:10] in prayer. We want to uh continue to
[53:12] remember our sister Deborah Beers in
[53:14] prayer as the Lord uh finalizes a
[53:17] complete and total healing and
[53:19] deliverance and completion to this uh
[53:22] situation that she's been dealing with.
[53:24] We trust God. We believe God. Amen. We
[53:27] want to continue to pray for our sister
[53:29] Sheila. She's a wonderful testimony of
[53:31] what God is doing. Um we're so grateful
[53:34] for what God is doing. Amen. Let's pray.
[53:36] Father,
[53:38] how blessed that we can raise our hands
[53:40] unto a living God that knows every
[53:44] desire, every heart. Lord, sometimes
[53:47] these requests are just hard to speak,
[53:49] Father. They're just in the inner depths
[53:51] of our heart, Lord, because we've been
[53:53] dealing with them so long. But Lord, we
[53:55] know that uh you have a purpose in
[53:58] everything. And your ways are so much
[54:01] higher than our ways and beyond uh Lord,
[54:04] how we would think, Father. So Lord, you
[54:06] see every uplifted hand, you see every
[54:09] heart, Lord. May you just meet every
[54:11] need, Lord. And do it according to your
[54:14] time, your season when you can make it
[54:17] beautiful where we can look back and
[54:19] say, "Thank you, Lord. I knew that you
[54:21] had to wait until now." That's why, you
[54:24] know, Lord, you just have a way of doing
[54:26] things that just makes you uh so
[54:28] marvelous in our sight. So Lord, take
[54:31] control of each and every heart. Lord,
[54:34] as we go to this uh part of the service
[54:37] now, Lord, I'm just a man. Lord, I'm
[54:40] asking for your divine help. I I know
[54:42] that I've studied and and uh many things
[54:45] that you've placed in my heart, Lord.
[54:48] Help me to deliver it, Father. And help
[54:49] the people to receive it, Father. Lord,
[54:52] this is our desire, Lord. This is this
[54:54] is why we come into the house of the
[54:56] Lord, Father. This is why we come into
[54:57] your presence because we want to we want
[55:00] to lay it all at the altar. We want to
[55:02] say, Lord,
[55:04] have your way and speak to every one of
[55:07] our needs, Lord, from speaker to hear.
[55:10] Father, may you grant it now in the name
[55:13] of Jesus Christ. And Lord, remember
[55:16] those that are sick amongst us. Raise
[55:18] them up in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[55:21] And amen. Praise God. Glory to God.
[55:24] Let's um let's go to the word. Um we've
[55:28] been on an adoption series for quite a
[55:30] while. for the last uh three months or
[55:32] so. Um I believe that it'll probably end
[55:35] this year. You know, this year's only
[55:38] got a couple weeks left. So, um I'm just
[55:41] going to just keep going as the Lord
[55:43] just keeps inspiring and, you know,
[55:45] keeping the atmosphere around this word.
[55:48] Um I believe that uh you know, he has he
[55:52] has a word for each age and uh he has a
[55:55] word for you. That's a word in season.
[55:58] Right where you are today, right now,
[56:00] right, uh today, I believe that if you
[56:03] if you can enter into that element, um
[56:06] recognizing that Jesus Christ is he's
[56:09] present. He's a present God. Amen. Then
[56:12] that will change the way that you you
[56:14] receive the word. Amen. Praise God. And
[56:17] so uh God's desire has always been you
[56:20] know from the very beginning to to uh
[56:23] you know to be with sons and daughters
[56:26] to have a family to be expressed in a
[56:29] family to have fellowship with his
[56:30] children. Amen. That's what true
[56:32] Christianity is really all about. Amen.
[56:35] So let's uh let's go to our scripture.
[56:36] We're going to continue on our title of
[56:39] calling the sons of God. I believe that
[56:41] we're in an hour where the word is
[56:44] calling. The word is calling. We we we
[56:48] don't call, but the word calls. Amen.
[56:51] The faith cometh by hearing. And when
[56:53] you hear your name being called, it's
[56:56] because you're a son or a daughter of
[56:58] God. Amen. And so, let's go to
[57:00] scripture. Job chapter 38. Um, we read
[57:04] this last week, but we're going to read
[57:05] it again. We're going to just continue
[57:06] from where we were. Uh, so he goes on to
[57:09] say, he says, he's speaking to Job. He
[57:11] says, "Where was ye? Where was thou when
[57:14] I laid the foundations of the earth?
[57:16] Declare, if thou has understanding,
[57:21] who hath laid the measures thereof? If
[57:24] thou knowest. He's asking Job what. So,
[57:26] you know, because Job was in a real real
[57:28] pickle, you know, he was in a real
[57:30] situation and he was kind of getting
[57:32] into a situation where he was, you know,
[57:34] uh, fighting up a little bit and, you
[57:36] know, he was being he was being attacked
[57:39] by by those, you know, by his friends.
[57:42] you know, they were they were medical
[57:44] doctors and whatever, you know, and and
[57:47] you know, and they they were telling
[57:48] Job, "Oh, why don't you just curse God?"
[57:50] And Job in in his, you know, responses,
[57:53] he got a little bit, you know, lifted up
[57:55] in in his ways and kind of was
[57:58] questioning, you know, even God,
[57:59] questioning God, but he never doubted
[58:01] God. But but but hey, you you get
[58:04] yourself into a situation sometime.
[58:06] Amen. You get down into a hard situation
[58:09] sometime and and any one of us and every
[58:13] one of us has said, "Lord, why? Why,
[58:15] Lord?"
[58:16] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Where were you when I laid
[58:19] the foundations? Who hath laid the
[58:21] measures thereof? If thou if thou
[58:22] knowest or who hath stretched the line
[58:25] upon it? Whereupon are the foundations
[58:28] thereof fastened? How is the earth and
[58:31] everything, you know, everything is in
[58:33] in perfect uh, you know, balance and
[58:35] harmony, you know, with the universe? I
[58:38] did all of that. Or who laid the
[58:39] cornerstone thereof when the morning
[58:42] stars sang together and all the sons of
[58:46] God shouted for joy. Amen. Praise God.
[58:51] You know, we can we can question a lot
[58:55] of things while we're here on this
[58:58] earth, but I want you to know that God
[59:01] has an answer for every single question
[59:03] that's in your heart.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. God knows every one of you where
[59:09] you're at right now, the situations that
[59:12] you're dealing with. He says, "I laid
[59:14] the foundations of the world. I had
[59:17] everything." And then he goes on and he
[59:19] says, "And and and and where were you
[59:21] when the when the morning stars sang
[59:24] together and the sons of God shouted for
[59:28] joy?"
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Because you know like you know let's
[59:31] let's read the quote here from brother
[59:32] Brandham. We read this last week but in
[59:35] uh in um the hand of the Lord upon him
[59:38] came upon him. He says why I said
[59:42] about God spoke to Job one day and he
[59:45] said Job where was you when I laid the
[59:48] foundations of the world tell me what
[59:51] they're they're fashioned unto said when
[59:53] the morning stars sang together and the
[59:55] sons of God shouted for joy now listen
[59:58] he says a hundred million years before
[1:00:01] the world was ever formed they had
[1:00:05] shouting religion in other words God
[1:00:08] took Joel right back into the into the
[1:00:10] back part of his mind before he was even
[1:00:13] God.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And was and was laying the whole
[1:00:17] earth and the whole foundation and the
[1:00:19] whole plan that he had in the back part
[1:00:21] of his mind. Amen. And and he says that
[1:00:25] this that God had a shouting religion.
[1:00:27] Then talk about something new. He says
[1:00:30] why it's the oldest there is and the
[1:00:33] only kind there really is. Yeah. It's
[1:00:36] oldfashioned, heartfelt, sky blue,
[1:00:39] sinkilling religion,
[1:00:42] brother. It don't whitewash you. It
[1:00:45] washes you white from the inside out.
[1:00:48] Amen. Yes. It make you do things you
[1:00:51] didn't you you didn't think you ever
[1:00:53] would do. Amen. Praise God. This is
[1:00:57] Listen, this word of God is not
[1:00:59] something that's new. It might be new to
[1:01:02] you in the revelation, in the season, in
[1:01:04] the time that God is bringing a word to
[1:01:07] you, but it's not something new to him.
[1:01:10] He had you in the back part of his mind
[1:01:13] that that that he would know that when
[1:01:15] his word would come forth in this
[1:01:17] dispensation, in this particular age
[1:01:20] that you're in, regardless of the
[1:01:23] condition that you were in,
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; regard look, Job was having a tough
[1:01:27] time. Amen. You know that he was he'd
[1:01:30] lost absolutely everything.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; So don't try to you want to compare to
[1:01:35] something compare to Job. Are you in
[1:01:36] that kind of condition this morning
[1:01:38] where you're full of boils and you've
[1:01:40] got you know pain everywhere. Yeah we
[1:01:43] wake up in the morning we got aches. We
[1:01:44] got pains but not like that. You could
[1:01:47] still be in the house of the Lord this
[1:01:49] morning. Amen. So regardless of your
[1:01:51] circumstance, regardless of your
[1:01:53] condition, regardless of where you are,
[1:01:56] God knows what you need.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. He knows exactly the
[1:02:02] word that he needed to send you in the
[1:02:05] age that you were in. Amen. Praise God.
[1:02:08] So they were shouting. Now, now we
[1:02:11] talked about it last week where we said,
[1:02:13] you know, the the the morning stars, we
[1:02:15] made it clear that the morning stars
[1:02:17] were the angels. Amen. Those were the
[1:02:19] angels that God had created
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; in the very beginning because God
[1:02:24] created the angels first.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you know sons of God were
[1:02:30] expressed you know when you go back to
[1:02:32] you know Genesis 1:26 where God created
[1:02:35] Adam in his image. That was the first
[1:02:38] son of God that was actually being
[1:02:41] expressed in the image of God in the
[1:02:44] likeness of God. He was spirit man. He
[1:02:47] was eternal. He was not in a fallen
[1:02:50] condition as yet. Amen. Praise God. So,
[1:02:54] we you know, we don't want to get too
[1:02:56] far ahead here, but but we need to
[1:02:59] recognize that um that, you know, that
[1:03:02] there's that this faith that God has
[1:03:04] given us in this hour is the faith that
[1:03:08] is going to deliver us. He knew what we
[1:03:11] would need in the age that we were in so
[1:03:14] that we could overcome the age that we
[1:03:16] were in. Amen. So God knows that, you
[1:03:20] know, like listen, there's, you know,
[1:03:22] I'm just going to tell it straight as it
[1:03:24] is, okay? 99% of the churches out there
[1:03:28] are preaching an historical Jesus,
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; they're always praising him for what
[1:03:33] he's done in the past. They're praising
[1:03:35] him for what he's going to do in the
[1:03:36] future, but they fail to recognize the
[1:03:39] light of the day,
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; the light of the hour, what God is doing
[1:03:43] right now, what he's trying to
[1:03:45] accomplish. It's always been that way.
[1:03:47] Look at when Jesus himself came to the
[1:03:49] earth. How many actually recognize him?
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what Listen what
[1:03:54] what God is looking at. He's not looking
[1:03:56] at your your your background, your
[1:03:59] upbringing. You could have been Buddha.
[1:04:02] You could have been Muslim. You could
[1:04:04] have been uh Jehovah Witness. You could
[1:04:06] have been a Baptist. You could have
[1:04:07] Listen, we're not talking about uh um uh
[1:04:11] titles here. We're not talking about
[1:04:13] denomin denominational teachings of man
[1:04:16] and doctrines of man. God is looking at
[1:04:20] the attribute of himself in you.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; The the the thought that he had of you
[1:04:27] before he ca before you came here.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's important for us to recognize
[1:04:33] that the Jesus that we preach from this
[1:04:36] gospel is the living Jesus. The one who
[1:04:39] who knows you today, knows where you're
[1:04:42] at right now,
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; regardless of your condition,
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; he's he's sending a word in season for
[1:04:49] you. Amen. And that word in season is is
[1:04:52] available today.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Glory to God. Listen,
[1:04:58] to recognize him, we listen, we we don't
[1:05:00] want a historical Jesus. We want the one
[1:05:02] that's now. Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; You know, when Jesus was walking on the
[1:05:06] earth, there was a woman one day that
[1:05:08] had a blood issue
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; and that woman touched the hem of his
[1:05:12] garment.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And Jesus turned around and says, "Who
[1:05:16] touched me?" Now, how many women or how
[1:05:19] many people had to touch him? He was in
[1:05:21] a crowd
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; and people were touching him left,
[1:05:24] right, and center. But yet when she
[1:05:27] touched him, he turned around and he
[1:05:30] looked at the girl and he said,
[1:05:32] "Daughter,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; daughter,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; okay, thy faith has made thee whole."
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Something in her recognized
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus in the present stage of his
[1:05:49] ministry that it was not just Jesus. It
[1:05:52] was actually Messiah.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the element that we
[1:05:57] have to recognize. Amen. That when Jesus
[1:06:01] looked at her and said, "Daughter, thy
[1:06:03] faith has made thee whole." What was he
[1:06:06] saying? I knew you from before the
[1:06:08] foundations of the world and you
[1:06:10] recognized me in the present stage
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; of of my word, my ministry, that you you
[1:06:16] you had heard that Messiah was coming.
[1:06:19] And now you've recognized that Messiah
[1:06:21] is here.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; And you've touched me and and and I want
[1:06:25] you to know that you're MY DAUGHTER.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE MY SON.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; When you can recognize the light in your
[1:06:31] day, that's because you are a son or a
[1:06:33] daughter of God. Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; That's what he says, your faith. Faith
[1:06:38] is a revelation.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; What is a revelation? A revelation is
[1:06:41] something that God reveals to you. when
[1:06:44] when he when he knew that he had been
[1:06:46] touched by the faith of a daughter, by
[1:06:48] the discernment, he recognized, "Oh,
[1:06:51] here's an attribute."
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And he turned.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Your faith, your
[1:06:56] revelation, your understanding, your
[1:06:58] recognition of me
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; has made you whole."
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what condition you're
[1:07:03] in today. YOU MIGHT BE SICK. YOU MIGHT
[1:07:07] BE DOWN and out. You might be depressed.
[1:07:10] But listen, if you can RECOGNIZE JESUS
[1:07:12] IN THE PRESENT stage of his ministry,
[1:07:15] you can be changed RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHY
[1:07:17] he came.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; That's what we have. We are carriers of
[1:07:22] the word. THAT'S WHY HE SAID TO TO the
[1:07:25] disciples, "Whatever you bind on earth,
[1:07:27] you're going to bind in heaven. Whatever
[1:07:29] you loose on what do you mean by that?"
[1:07:31] He said, "Greater things you will do
[1:07:33] than than even what I do
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; because I'm going back to the father."
[1:07:37] reason because when I go back, I'm
[1:07:38] coming on you
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; and then you are going to be my
[1:07:41] mouthpiece. You're going to be my voice.
[1:07:43] YOU'RE GOING TO be the mercy seat.
[1:07:45] You're going to be the one with the word
[1:07:46] in your day.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Let's read our
[1:07:50] scripture just to just to strengthen
[1:07:52] this thought here
[1:07:54] in uh 1 John verse 1 uh 1:es 5-7. He
[1:07:58] says, "Now listen carefully. John's
[1:08:01] speaking here.
[1:08:03] This then is the message which we have
[1:08:06] heard of him
[1:08:09] and declare unto you that God is light.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; What is light?
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Light. When when when light comes open,
[1:08:19] you can see things.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; You can recognize that there's something
[1:08:22] there.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And God is light. And in him is no
[1:08:27] darkness at all. Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Now, if we say that we have fellowship
[1:08:32] with him,
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; oh, there's a listen, a lot of churches.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're praising Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] Glory to God. They're saying, but but
[1:08:41] listen, if we say that we have
[1:08:43] fellowship with him and walk in
[1:08:44] darkness,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; we lie. That's right.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; It's you you you don't you don't know
[1:08:50] it. You you may not be aware of it, but
[1:08:52] you're actually lying. And do not the
[1:08:54] truth. Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; But if we walk in the light, now pay
[1:08:59] attention. If we walk in the light as he
[1:09:02] is in the light,
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; in other words, if you're walking in the
[1:09:05] in the in the present truth where he is,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; as he is in the light, not just, you
[1:09:12] know, man-made light, oh, praise God.
[1:09:14] Come into the church. You, you know,
[1:09:16] just put your name on the membership and
[1:09:18] you can be a member of God's economy.
[1:09:20] You might be a member of some economy,
[1:09:22] but you're not a part of the body of
[1:09:24] Christ if you deny his word. Amen.
[1:09:28] Praise God. And there's a there's many.
[1:09:30] But listen, he says, "We have fellowship
[1:09:33] one with another.
[1:09:35] And the blood now, he is he is in the
[1:09:38] light. We have fellowship one with
[1:09:40] another. And the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:09:43] his son, cleanses us from all sin."
[1:09:46] Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Now, just think about what I said about
[1:09:48] the woman that touched the hem of his
[1:09:50] garment. There's fellowship.
[1:09:53] True fellowship comes when we walk in
[1:09:57] the light as he is in the light.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; In the word for your day,
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; recognizing what Christ is doing now.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as a result of all that,
[1:10:11] you can be washed of your sin. Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; You can be healed of your sickness.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; You, you know, people wonder why this
[1:10:20] thing just, you know, this sickness in
[1:10:22] my life. Listen, there's some sort of an
[1:10:25] unbelief.
[1:10:26] It could be just a an understanding,
[1:10:28] just a thought process that that we hold
[1:10:31] on to, some sort of a tradition that we
[1:10:34] hang on to. We're not willing to let go
[1:10:36] of that of that tradition that we were,
[1:10:38] you know, maybe brought up under, you
[1:10:40] know, well, my father was this and, you
[1:10:42] know, my father WAS A CATHOLIC, MY
[1:10:44] MOTHER WAS A CATHOLIC, MY GRANDFATHER
[1:10:46] was a Catholic, I'm I was born into the
[1:10:48] Catholic church, I'm a Catholic.
[1:10:52] What about if God comes and opens your
[1:10:54] understanding
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden this window of light
[1:11:00] opens up and you start to see the word?
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; You say, "Wait a minute here.
[1:11:06] Why Why am I understanding and seeing
[1:11:08] this as clear as a bell?" Why? What? All
[1:11:11] of a sudden now, you know, the trinity
[1:11:13] doesn't make sense anymore.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Because all of a sudden now you realize
[1:11:17] when God Jesus said, "I and the father
[1:11:20] are one.
[1:11:22] The word was made flesh. In the
[1:11:25] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:11:26] with God. The word what
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; was God.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Wasn't a second part of God. Wasn't the
[1:11:33] was God. And the word was made flesh
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. He came to his own
[1:11:39] and his own received him not. They
[1:11:42] couldn't recognize. They were blinded.
[1:11:44] Amen. But God has a people in the land
[1:11:48] in the last days who will not be
[1:11:50] deceived by a teaching of man, by a
[1:11:53] doctrine of man. They will go back to
[1:11:56] the word. They will let the Holy Ghost
[1:11:59] who Jesus himself said, "I will send you
[1:12:03] the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost."
[1:12:06] He's telling them straight, which is me.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come in you
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to lead you into all
[1:12:12] truth. Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And you're going to see and walk in the
[1:12:15] light. And now all of a sudden, we got
[1:12:17] fellowship.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we only have fellowship
[1:12:21] in this hour.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; True fellowship
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; is in the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Because he is the word.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; And so to deny and say, "Oh, I got
[1:12:32] baptized when I was a baby." That ain't
[1:12:35] that don't mean nothing.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Show me anywhere in the Bible where
[1:12:38] anybody was ever baptized as a baby.
[1:12:41] Jesus. We just showed what Jesus did. He
[1:12:44] says
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; he laid hands on them and he blessed
[1:12:47] them.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; That's what he did.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; But he also said, "He that believeth and
[1:12:52] is baptized shall be saved."
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; And so, you got to believe and know that
[1:12:56] God is God before you can even be
[1:12:58] baptized.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Because baptism is an outward expression
[1:13:02] of something that's taken place on the
[1:13:04] inside. a revelation that oh my God,
[1:13:08] I got to be baptized in the name of the
[1:13:10] Lord Jesus Christ where there's 8,000
[1:13:13] baptisms in the New Testament.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Somebody can show me anywhere where
[1:13:17] anybody was ever baptized in the titles
[1:13:20] titles
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; I'll believe you. It ain't in the
[1:13:25] scriptures.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Nowhere.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus was right there. He had risen
[1:13:30] right there in in Matthew. I know
[1:13:32] they'll use that that that that
[1:13:33] scripture Matthew 28:19 where Jesus
[1:13:35] says, "Go ye into all the world." But
[1:13:38] listen, read it.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; He said just before he said that, he
[1:13:42] said, "All power has been given unto me
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; in heaven and on earth."
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Is there any other power?
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Is No. No. Is there any? He said all
[1:13:55] power. Didn't he say that?
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; In heaven and on earth.
[1:14:00] Now go ye into all the world, baptizing
[1:14:03] them in the name.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't say names. He saidn name of
[1:14:08] the father and of the son and of the
[1:14:09] holy ghost. And Peter was right there
[1:14:11] when he when he told the disciples that.
[1:14:14] And on the day of Pentecost, what Peter
[1:14:16] just walks out and plainly decides to be
[1:14:18] rebellious and say, "Repent and be
[1:14:21] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:23] Christ." Why didn't he say the name of
[1:14:24] the father and of the son and of the
[1:14:26] holy ghost? because he had a revelation
[1:14:28] that Jesus Christ was God
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; and that his name is Jesus and that
[1:14:34] there's no other name whereby man must
[1:14:36] be saved.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Isaiah says it. He says there's no other
[1:14:40] there's no other savior
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; beside me
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; before me, after me. I am the Lord God.
[1:14:46] I am one.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; He wanted to make it clear so that the
[1:14:50] people could know.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; That's walking in the light.
[1:14:55] our fellowship in Christ as he walks in
[1:14:58] the light. Amen. That's how we have
[1:15:00] fellowship. True real fellowship in the
[1:15:03] word of God. Amen. Listen, I can have
[1:15:06] fellowship with you when you know we go
[1:15:07] out and we have dinner together and we
[1:15:10] can talk and you know, but but but
[1:15:12] fellowship is around the revealed word
[1:15:15] for your day.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; It's where Jesus Christ is in the midst
[1:15:19] of your fellowship. He's the focus of
[1:15:22] your fellowship. He's he's he's all of
[1:15:26] your fellowship because you've
[1:15:28] recognized the word for your day. Amen.
[1:15:31] And so we need to understand that sons
[1:15:34] of God are from God.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're genes of God.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; They will understand each other. Listen,
[1:15:42] when listen, a deep call to the deep, if
[1:15:45] you've got Listen, if God brings forth
[1:15:47] children, they got to be gods.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a son of God is actually a God
[1:15:53] is a part of God is part of the the the
[1:15:56] the reality of God has the mind of God
[1:15:59] the spirit of God and they have the
[1:16:01] unity
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; that comes with knowing one another as
[1:16:05] God.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; That's why he says on that day you shall
[1:16:08] know that I am in the father ye in me
[1:16:11] and I in you.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. One. Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:16:17] read our quote here from Satan's Eden.
[1:16:20] He says here now that's the way God was
[1:16:22] in the beginning. Every son of God and
[1:16:26] every daughter of God was in God at the
[1:16:29] beginning. You don't remember it now,
[1:16:32] but you were there. He know it
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; and he wanted you to become. He wanted
[1:16:38] you to manifest. That's what he's saying
[1:16:40] there. He wanted you to manifest so that
[1:16:43] so that he could contact you.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; How's he going to contact you? By the
[1:16:49] word. Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; How you going to know that it's him? By
[1:16:52] the word.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; You're not going to listen to a
[1:16:54] tradition of man. You're going to listen
[1:16:56] to the word
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; because he is the word. That's the only
[1:16:59] way he contacts children of God.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And look, he goes on to speak with
[1:17:05] you, to love you, and to shake your
[1:17:08] hands. You know that when we have true
[1:17:10] fellowship in the Holy Ghost and we've
[1:17:13] welcomed him into the midst of our
[1:17:15] fellowship that you as a son of God, me
[1:17:18] as a son of God, you as a daughter of
[1:17:20] God,
[1:17:22] we shake hands.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; We're shaking hands with God.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Listen, you're going to have to come to
[1:17:28] that understanding one way or the other
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; because that's his desire. His desire
[1:17:34] was not to come here and say, "I'm going
[1:17:36] to take you to heaven and you're all
[1:17:39] going to go there and you're all going
[1:17:40] to have a a nice wonderful time." No,
[1:17:42] no, no, no. That's not what the plan
[1:17:44] was. The plan from the very beginning
[1:17:47] was that he wanted to have a family of
[1:17:51] God men and women on earth.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; This is why we're going to the
[1:17:57] millennium. Yes.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; That's why the 7,000th year is all about
[1:18:01] ruling here on earth for another
[1:18:04] thousand years with Christ.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; The saints shall rule and reign with
[1:18:11] Christ here on earth as God men and God
[1:18:16] women.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; That was his true desire. Not to take
[1:18:20] you into a a paradise or a heaven
[1:18:22] somewhere where everything is is is all
[1:18:25] rosy and everything is fun. No,
[1:18:28] read the scriptures. Look to see what
[1:18:30] he's actually saying. What what what is
[1:18:33] is uh uh you know been been given to us
[1:18:36] by the word for our day. This whole
[1:18:38] series on adoption is about God calling
[1:18:42] and placing sons and daughters of God
[1:18:45] positionally
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; into the age that they're in
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; so that they can produce the word that
[1:18:52] was ordained for this age. We're not
[1:18:55] looking to to reproduce Luther's age.
[1:18:58] We're not looking to produce Wesley's
[1:19:00] age. We're not looking to produce
[1:19:02] Pentecost.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; We're not look we're not interested in
[1:19:05] speaking in tongues. Does it happen?
[1:19:06] Sure, it happens. But when it does
[1:19:09] happen, it happens in the proper order.
[1:19:11] It happens where somebody speaks and and
[1:19:14] it's not some language that you can't
[1:19:16] understand. You may not understand it,
[1:19:18] but somebody understands that language
[1:19:21] because then it gets perfectly ined.
[1:19:23] Yes,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; that's proper speaking in tongues and
[1:19:26] interpretation.
[1:19:28] So, we're not interested in in in, you
[1:19:30] know, in the emotions. We're interested
[1:19:32] in the word for our day.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; What the word is supposed to produce in
[1:19:37] our day. Amen. Go to the next quote. He
[1:19:40] says, "Now, now to be a true Christian,"
[1:19:44] Amen. He says, "You have to be the
[1:19:47] same." In other words, he's saying if
[1:19:49] you got a Christian is Christlike. Yes,
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; that's what the word Christian means.
[1:19:53] So, you got to be like Christ.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to be a son in his image.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't want to forget that all
[1:20:01] that he was, I'm identified with him.
[1:20:04] I'm identified with him. He says, notice
[1:20:07] he is in me and I in him. Notice then
[1:20:12] every Christian that's a real genuine
[1:20:15] Christian was with him when the morning
[1:20:20] stars sang together and the sons of God
[1:20:22] shouted for joy before there was a
[1:20:25] foundation of the world. We were
[1:20:27] identified in the immortal realms of God
[1:20:32] with God.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Look 10 million years before the world
[1:20:36] was ever formed. This is Christianity.
[1:20:41] This is the gospel.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You go and tell somebody that listen,
[1:20:46] you you're NOT YOU WERE IN AN ACCIDENT.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Your life might have been a problem. You
[1:20:50] might have been born under the wrong
[1:20:52] parents. You could have had all kinds of
[1:20:54] situations. You could have BEEN A DRUG
[1:20:56] ADDICT. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN WHATEVER.
[1:20:58] YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A PROSTITUTE. OH,
[1:21:00] GLORY TO GOD. LISTEN, GOD, when Jesus
[1:21:02] was here on earth, he says, "I'm not
[1:21:04] going to th those that are righteous."
[1:21:06] those that were righteous, they were
[1:21:08] standing right in front of him and
[1:21:09] saying, "We are the sons of Abraham. We
[1:21:11] are the children of Abraham." Jesus
[1:21:13] looked at them and says, "You're the
[1:21:14] you're the children of the devil."
[1:21:17] Rebuke them.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; He told them straight, "By your
[1:21:22] traditions,
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; your teachings,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; your ways of teaching the people and and
[1:21:28] interpreting my word, you've made it of
[1:21:30] none effect to the people." Amen.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; You go to somebody these days and you
[1:21:34] say, "Hey, have you received the Holy
[1:21:36] Ghost since you believed?"
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; They don't even understand what what do
[1:21:40] you mean Holy Ghost? Just like Paul when
[1:21:42] he came to those disciples, they were
[1:21:44] they were all praising Jesus. They were
[1:21:45] in church.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Wait a minute here. I know
[1:21:48] you guys are praising the Lord." He
[1:21:50] says, "But I see something uh you know,
[1:21:51] have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; since you believed?
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; You mean you could be a believer? You
[1:21:57] could you could claim Christianity. You
[1:21:58] could be, but you ain't got the Holy
[1:22:00] Ghost.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; They said, "Yeah, we were baptized, you
[1:22:03] know, according to John, you know, no,
[1:22:05] no, John baptized unto repentance
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; to receive him
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; that would come after, which is Christ
[1:22:12] who will baptize you with the fire of
[1:22:14] the Holy Ghost."
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And right there and
[1:22:19] then, they recognize, my God, I haven't
[1:22:21] even been properly baptized. And they
[1:22:24] were baptized in the Read it. Acts 19.
[1:22:26] In the name of the Lord Jesus, and the
[1:22:29] Holy Ghost came upon them.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; God honors his word, doesn't he?
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. It doesn't matter what
[1:22:38] your condition was. When he comes, he
[1:22:41] comes to his seed.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "My sheep hear my voice."
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. No other will they follow. They'll
[1:22:48] recognize the word for their day.
[1:22:51] They'll realize that I'm here now.
[1:22:53] They're looking for the coming of the
[1:22:54] Lord. Oh, he's coming. He's coming.
[1:22:56] Guess what?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; He's present.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; He's under the five-fold ministry
[1:23:02] preaching the word of God to the sons
[1:23:04] and daughters of God, placing them
[1:23:06] positionally in the place where they're
[1:23:09] supposed to rightfully be placed.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; You could be in the wrong CHURCH THIS
[1:23:14] MORNING. YOU COULD BE IN THE WRONG uh
[1:23:16] family this morning. You you THOUGHT,
[1:23:18] "OH, I I'M A SON OF OF OH, I can't I
[1:23:20] can't cause a disturbance in my home.
[1:23:22] Oh, boy. If I come home, listen, I
[1:23:24] remember the disturbance that I caused
[1:23:26] when when the Holy Ghost came into my
[1:23:28] life. There was wildfire ALL AROUND ME.
[1:23:30] MY FAMILY THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, BUT I COULDN'T
[1:23:35] HELP IT. SOMETHING HAD COME INTO MY
[1:23:38] HEART.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A REALITY of the word. There
[1:23:42] was nobody that could tell me that what
[1:23:44] I was READING WAS RIGHT THERE, CLEAR." I
[1:23:46] said, "No, but can't you see this?"
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; But look,
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Unto you it has been given to know the
[1:23:56] mystery."
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; The mysteries,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; the mystery of him.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; That's the great mystery.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; The great mystery is is like, you know,
[1:24:07] we we could talk about Paul. We we
[1:24:10] preached it here in the last few
[1:24:11] services where Paul says that you might
[1:24:14] know what is the fellowship of the
[1:24:16] mystery
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; that is in Christ where unto you were
[1:24:20] predestinated unto this
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; from before the foundation. See God
[1:24:25] could see down the road that when this
[1:24:28] word would come in its dispensation in
[1:24:31] its season and it would come to you
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; would take it and you would say amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I re I receive that and I reject
[1:24:40] THE TRADITION. I REJECT the teachings of
[1:24:42] man. I am going to make God's word my
[1:24:45] absolute from this day on.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; You try that one time and you see if God
[1:24:50] doesn't honor and back his word.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; God will always heaven and earth will
[1:24:54] pass away. But my word, you take it, you
[1:24:56] can stand on it. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:24:59] Listen, he goes on here. He says, he
[1:25:01] says, 10 million years before the world
[1:25:04] was ever formed, I was back there with
[1:25:06] him. And if I got eternal life, I was
[1:25:09] there with him. I was identified with
[1:25:12] him. When the morning stars sang
[1:25:14] together and the sons shouted for joy,
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I was there because you take eternal.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; No beginning, no end.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; For you to have eternal life means that
[1:25:26] you always had it.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; No beginning, no end.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; That's what eternal is.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; We need to understand that. And that
[1:25:36] revelation, once you catch that
[1:25:38] revelation, you realize, whoa, wait a
[1:25:41] minute here. You mean I was already
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; justified
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; in my age,
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; but I just needed to hear the word.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; I just needed to hear what the word said
[1:25:54] about me
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; in my time and in my age.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's all it was. Amen. Glory to
[1:26:01] God. And when you come to a place like
[1:26:03] that where you have recognized you, you
[1:26:07] know you because faith is not something
[1:26:09] you can put your finger on.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Faith is something that's revealed to
[1:26:14] you.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; It's looking to the unseen. You you know
[1:26:18] faith is a substance. But yet when it
[1:26:21] comes into your heart the gate Jesus
[1:26:23] said look at just look at what he said
[1:26:25] to to to to Peter when he came down. He
[1:26:29] was on earth. Jesus just finished
[1:26:31] praying, comes amongst his disciples.
[1:26:33] Just the same question that he would ask
[1:26:36] today.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Who do the churches and the people and
[1:26:39] all these different uh denominations say
[1:26:42] that I am?
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, some of them said that you're, you
[1:26:47] know, John the Baptist. Some say you're
[1:26:48] Jeremiah. Some say you're you're a
[1:26:50] you're a prophet. Some say, and he looks
[1:26:52] to Peter. He says, "Peter, who do you
[1:26:55] say that I am?"
[1:26:57] He says, "Thou art the Christ. Thou art
[1:27:00] the anointed word.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; that's what Christ means.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Christ means anointed word. The word
[1:27:07] that was supposed to come in our day and
[1:27:10] we've recognized it.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; You're that one. You're that Messiah.
[1:27:15] You you you're you're you're the you you
[1:27:17] know, you're the you're the Messiah.
[1:27:18] Look what Jesus turned around and says,
[1:27:20] "Flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:27:23] to you.
[1:27:25] No teacher, no seminary, NO CHURCH, NO
[1:27:28] PASTOR, no priest until you come into a
[1:27:31] personal revelation of Jesus Christ, who
[1:27:34] he is, you and him.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; That's what he's talking about. And look
[1:27:38] what he says. He says, "But my father,
[1:27:41] my spirit,
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; my anointing, my the Holy Ghost."
[1:27:48] Whenever he says father, he's talking
[1:27:50] about that other office
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; that he is because his whole mystery was
[1:27:56] to condescend from God down into man to
[1:27:59] where he could have fellowship with his
[1:28:02] own attributes.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; He says that's who revealed it to you.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; And watch what he says. And I'm going to
[1:28:10] build my church that way.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; That's how this church is built.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; This church is built upon the spiritual
[1:28:16] revelation of God. revealing his
[1:28:18] thoughts directly to the individual.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Not the whole church.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; In every church, there's three kinds of
[1:28:27] believers.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Everyone.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; You got the the makeel believer, you got
[1:28:31] the unbeliever, and you got the true
[1:28:33] believer.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; The true believer, she's walking by
[1:28:37] revelation on the word of God because
[1:28:39] it's been revealed.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll build my church. And look
[1:28:43] what he says. And the gates of hell will
[1:28:46] not prevail against that revelation when
[1:28:49] I give it to you. No devil in hell is
[1:28:51] going to pull it out of you.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; No way. He says it's all yours. It's
[1:28:56] because you've looked to the unseen and
[1:28:58] you've recognized. Now here, let's look
[1:29:01] at this next quote here. Looking to the
[1:29:03] unseen. He says here, "How much can you
[1:29:06] walk around?" Listen. He says here,
[1:29:07] sorry. He says, "Look at Joshua.
[1:29:11] Look at Joshua." Now, how many believes
[1:29:13] we're in the Joshua commission?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Joshua was a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:17] taking the children into the promised
[1:29:19] land.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; That's the hour that we're in. Joshua,
[1:29:21] under the five-fold ministry, Joshua is
[1:29:23] all about placing. Go back and read it.
[1:29:26] The whole book of Joshua, it's all about
[1:29:28] placing the sons and daughters of God
[1:29:30] into their portions of land. Amen. He
[1:29:32] says, "Now watch. Before one rock ever
[1:29:35] come out of the building of the walls of
[1:29:37] Jericho, Joshua walked around the walls
[1:29:41] shouting the victory. Oh, glory to God.
[1:29:44] Amen. He he he could shout the victory
[1:29:46] just like the sons of God when they were
[1:29:48] shouting. He says, "FOR BY FAITH HE SAW
[1:29:51] THE VICTORY."
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; He knowed the walls was coming down.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; I don't care what's around your life
[1:29:58] right now. I don't care what situation
[1:29:59] you might have to face
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; after you leave this place. Listen, the
[1:30:03] word of God has been laid into your
[1:30:05] heart and faith takes an anchor. You're
[1:30:08] going to know victory is yours. He
[1:30:10] knowed the walls was coming down and he
[1:30:12] armed his men and walked around and
[1:30:15] around and around Jericho for seven days
[1:30:18] in full armor. Hallelujah. Aren't you
[1:30:21] glad? We've come through seven church
[1:30:22] ages
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; and now we've got the full armor of God
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; to recognize what the fullness of the
[1:30:28] word is to produce in this day and in
[1:30:30] this hour. Amen. He says, "What doing?"
[1:30:33] Because he was looking at the unseen, it
[1:30:36] was a promise God made to him.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; He knew that whatever situation
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; and you can rest upon that. You can take
[1:30:44] the word of God this morning. You can
[1:30:46] place it in front of the enemy and say,
[1:30:49] "You you tell me what this says."
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; And if you can tell me that this is
[1:30:55] wrong, I'll believe you.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; But the gates of hell will never prevail
[1:30:59] against God's word. Amen.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Being revealed in your heart. Amen.
[1:31:04] Look, he goes on here. Next slide. He
[1:31:05] says, "How much can you walk around a
[1:31:07] wheelchair?" Now, he's talking about
[1:31:09] situations in your life.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Just type it, saints. How much can you
[1:31:13] walk around cancer?
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He says, "How much can
[1:31:17] you walk around sin?" SHOUTING THE
[1:31:20] VICTORY THAT GOD GIVE THE PROMISE. AMEN.
[1:31:24] When you can see how who is invisible
[1:31:29] when that pulsation comes into your
[1:31:31] heart and begins to pulsate I'm it says
[1:31:35] I'm the Lord who heals all thy diseases.
[1:31:38] Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; He says when you can see that everything
[1:31:42] else weakens away.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Joshua looked at the unseen and he
[1:31:47] walked around the walls believing that
[1:31:50] it would happen. All it depends on is
[1:31:53] what you're looking at, brother, sister.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; What are you looking at this morning?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; If you're looking at the word, you're
[1:32:01] going to see your name in the in the
[1:32:03] scriptures.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; If you're looking at a tradition or a
[1:32:07] teaching of man, you're going to be in
[1:32:09] confusion.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to look to Jesus.
[1:32:13] You need to look to the unseen. You need
[1:32:15] to have that same shout in you that
[1:32:18] Joshua had in him. the same shout. You
[1:32:21] where do YOU THINK THAT SHOUT came in
[1:32:23] Joshua when they listen when God told
[1:32:25] them to go around the wall seven times?
[1:32:28] He says on the seventh day, he says
[1:32:31] everybody shout.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the walls are coming
[1:32:35] down.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; The victory is yours. We are going to
[1:32:38] receive the promise of the body change.
[1:32:40] Amen. We are going to receive our body
[1:32:43] change. We're going to receive our our
[1:32:45] paradise. We're going to receive our
[1:32:47] promised word
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; which is the promised land. Amen. Glory
[1:32:51] to God. Amen. Next slide. He says here,
[1:32:54] "Dear God, the great and mighty God, who
[1:32:57] formed all things by the power of his
[1:32:59] spirit and has brought Jesus Christ, his
[1:33:02] only begotten son, who freely died for
[1:33:05] we sinners, the just for the unjust, to
[1:33:09] reconcile us back into this marvelous
[1:33:12] fellowship that we have again with God."
[1:33:16] Amen. That's what the word has
[1:33:18] reconciled us back to, saints, back to
[1:33:20] God himself. Amen. as we are taught in
[1:33:24] the blessed word that we had fellowship
[1:33:26] with him before the foundations of the
[1:33:28] world when the morning stars sang
[1:33:31] together. Amen. Glory to God. And the
[1:33:35] sons of God shouted for joy way back
[1:33:37] before the foundations of the world. How
[1:33:40] do we know that that wasn't at the same
[1:33:43] time? Now pay attention that the lamb
[1:33:46] was slain.
[1:33:48] Think about that. Now when I seen that,
[1:33:51] I said, "Hallelujah."
[1:33:53] THAT WHEN GOD in his great thinking seen
[1:33:56] us shouting and rejoicing in our
[1:33:59] salvation through Jesus, how do we know
[1:34:02] that that wasn't when the lamb was
[1:34:04] slain? When was the lamb slain?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Before the foundations of the world.
[1:34:10] When were the sons of God shouting?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Before the foundations of the world.
[1:34:15] What do you think they were shouting
[1:34:17] about? Any idea maybe what they were
[1:34:20] shouting about?
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Was it because they saw the plan of
[1:34:24] redemption?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Because this is what this is all about,
[1:34:28] saints.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; This is not about anybody can just be
[1:34:32] saved. Yes, those who receive Jesus
[1:34:35] Christ as their savior shall be saved.
[1:34:39] God promises it according to his word.
[1:34:42] But not all are going to have are going
[1:34:45] to be the ones whose names were written
[1:34:47] in the lamb's book.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Now remember,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; the lamb that was slain.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; They were rejoicing before the
[1:34:58] foundation of the world because the lamb
[1:35:00] that was slain had a book.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; John was was was was overwhelmed one
[1:35:08] day. You can go back and read it in
[1:35:09] chapter 4. In chapter 5 of Revelation,
[1:35:12] he said there was no man on earth,
[1:35:16] below the earth, on the earth, above the
[1:35:18] earth, no man.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Man. That's why Jesus had to come and
[1:35:24] become man. The word was made flesh.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that there could be a reverse
[1:35:31] to bring back the sons and daughters of
[1:35:34] God.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; This is about the plan of redemption.
[1:35:38] The lamb had a book in his hand and in
[1:35:41] that book there was names written in
[1:35:44] that lamb's book. Listen, go back and
[1:35:46] study the scriptures. The Bible talks
[1:35:48] about the book of life.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible talks about a part in
[1:35:52] the book of life which is the lamb's
[1:35:54] book of life. Those are the attributes
[1:35:57] sons and daughters of God that were
[1:36:00] ordained before the foundations of the
[1:36:02] world to receive this word to bring it
[1:36:05] to this dispensation. Every age had a
[1:36:09] portion of word all through the seist
[1:36:11] listen when Christ when Christ died when
[1:36:13] he came and became man he took on human
[1:36:16] flesh because man had to there had to be
[1:36:19] a man die. Yes.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; So what he did was when he went to
[1:36:24] Gethsemane because remember he was not
[1:36:26] born the same way you and I were born.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That's why you must be born again.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; You must have the same experience as
[1:36:32] Mary.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And so when he was
[1:36:40] born, he was born God man.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; He was God man.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus. That's why he could do the things
[1:36:48] that he did. That's why the winds WOULD
[1:36:50] OBEY HIM. THAT'S why he could speak to
[1:36:52] the to the dead and they would rise up.
[1:36:54] What was that when he went to the tomb
[1:36:57] of Lazarus after four days dead in the
[1:36:59] tomb?
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; It'd already been rotten in there. He
[1:37:03] called his name Lazarus.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't care what condition
[1:37:07] you're in.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; When God calls your name, I don't care
[1:37:10] how long you think you're you're you
[1:37:11] you've been far you've been you've been,
[1:37:13] you know, you're so far away from God.
[1:37:15] You're not far enough away from God that
[1:37:17] he can't call you back.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you hear your name, he'll
[1:37:22] bring you in. Amen. Glory to God. It's
[1:37:24] because your name was in the lamb's
[1:37:27] book.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; So, I believe there was a shout because
[1:37:32] they saw something that had been
[1:37:35] revealed that the lamb could take the
[1:37:38] book. Oh, glory to God. We're going to
[1:37:40] be looking at that more next week. We're
[1:37:41] going to we're going to dig deeper into
[1:37:43] this ministry that God has given us in
[1:37:46] this day and in this hour. Amen. Glory
[1:37:48] to God. So here now, we need to
[1:37:50] recognize that God in his thinking, his
[1:37:53] great thinking, seen us shouting and
[1:37:55] rejoicing in our salvation through
[1:37:58] Jesus.
[1:38:00] And I believe it was because we saw the
[1:38:03] plan.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; But now we've got to fulfill the plan.
[1:38:08] Now, we've got to take our position in
[1:38:10] the plan.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; We've got to allow the word for our day
[1:38:15] to place us.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And that's why now
[1:38:20] we want to look at why God had to send a
[1:38:25] prophet.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Why the word could only come to a
[1:38:31] prophet. That's right.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; And if you go back and you study the
[1:38:35] seven church ages, you will see clearly
[1:38:38] that God sent a messenger to each of
[1:38:41] those seven church ages. Paul was the
[1:38:44] first messenger.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; All the way down to where William
[1:38:48] Branham in 1933,
[1:38:51] he's he's on the earth. He's he's
[1:38:54] baptizing people at the Ohio River. And
[1:38:58] out of nowhere, this pillar of fire
[1:39:00] comes in and a voice speaks out and
[1:39:03] says, "As John the Baptist was the first
[1:39:06] runner of Jesus Christ for his first
[1:39:08] coming, your ministry, your message,
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; your ministry will be the front runner
[1:39:15] for the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:18] Christ."
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; There was witnesses. There's there's
[1:39:21] newspaper articles on this. I'm not
[1:39:23] talking about something, you know, you
[1:39:25] know, fanatical here. You can go back
[1:39:27] and do the research yourself. Yeah,
[1:39:29] you'll go back there and you'll see how
[1:39:31] the enemy has tried to mar God's
[1:39:34] prophet, but you show me where where
[1:39:36] they didn't mar John the Baptist.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; They got so upset with him, they took
[1:39:40] his head off.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; So don't try to tell me, oh, you know,
[1:39:45] he's a false prophet, this and that. No,
[1:39:46] no, no. You search the scriptures for
[1:39:49] yourself
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; and you see if Malachi 4:5 doesn't tell
[1:39:53] you that I'll send you Elijah the
[1:39:55] prophet before that great and dreadful
[1:39:58] day of the Lord to turn us back to the
[1:40:01] word.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of Malachi 4:5. And
[1:40:05] then and then Revelations 10 1-7 where
[1:40:09] the word where the mystery of God was
[1:40:12] going to be unveiled
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; to where this message today this is this
[1:40:18] is our message by the way.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; We're not listen we're a Christian
[1:40:22] church because we're like Christ. But we
[1:40:25] are in a new dispensation.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; We are not in the Leodysian church age
[1:40:31] any longer.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Not this church. not the body of Christ.
[1:40:36] She's now in what's called the bride
[1:40:38] age.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; The age where Christ and the church
[1:40:42] become one.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Remember there was
[1:40:45] there was 10 virgins, right? And the
[1:40:48] bridegroom's call said, "Hey, the the
[1:40:50] bridegroom cometh." But there was five
[1:40:53] virgin. Listen, they were all virgins.
[1:40:54] In other words, they were all, you know,
[1:40:56] clean living. They were all praising
[1:40:58] God. They were all believing Jesus
[1:41:00] Christ. But five of them had no oil.
[1:41:03] What is oily ghost?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. They didn't have the
[1:41:06] Holy Ghost for their day.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Maybe they were under another
[1:41:09] dispensation. Maybe they were somewhere
[1:41:11] else. But they didn't recognize the word
[1:41:14] for their day. Because the ones that had
[1:41:17] the Holy Ghost, they had the oil. They
[1:41:19] recognized, "Hey, I got to get to church
[1:41:21] on Sunday because there's oil pouring
[1:41:23] down. Hallelujah. I'm going TO FILL UP.
[1:41:26] FILL my cup, Lord.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; I want the word for my day." That's the
[1:41:30] oil. That's the revelation of the hour.
[1:41:32] What is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost
[1:41:35] is the spirit of God in you fulfilling
[1:41:38] his purpose in your life.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost just doesn't cause you to
[1:41:45] speak in tongues. No, it takes your
[1:41:47] life.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; It looks at your old life. It says,
[1:41:52] "Anything that's in there that's no good
[1:41:54] to me, I'm going to drop it off."
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; You're going to have a hard time. Every
[1:41:59] birth is a mess.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Okay? There's no way around it. But when
[1:42:04] the Holy Ghost comes, now his purpose
[1:42:06] starts to take over. Listen. Romans 8
[1:42:11] 28.
[1:42:13] All things work together for good to
[1:42:16] them that are called according to his
[1:42:20] purpose.
[1:42:23] So if you're wondering why certain
[1:42:25] things are not working out in your life,
[1:42:28] you need to look to see if they are
[1:42:30] lining up with his purpose.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; You can't be going off and saying, "Oh,
[1:42:36] young people, I'm going to be a movie
[1:42:37] star.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to Hollywood and I'm
[1:42:42] going to be a movie star." How does that
[1:42:43] line up with the purpose of God in this
[1:42:45] day or this hour? or I'm going to be a
[1:42:47] fashion designer for for uh Pierre
[1:42:50] Laurentin or whatever their names are,
[1:42:52] Pierre Cardan or whatever. You know, how
[1:42:54] does that line up with with God's
[1:42:56] purpose in your life?
[1:42:58] If you are sincere and you want the Holy
[1:43:01] Ghost, when you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:43:03] it'll change your desire for the things
[1:43:05] of the world.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; It'll change your purpose for this life.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Your purpose will become the word.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; You'll want to fellowship on the word.
[1:43:14] You'll want to read the prophet's
[1:43:15] messages. You'll want to hear what he
[1:43:17] said because God sent a prophet for that
[1:43:20] very purpose. Now, let's go on here.
[1:43:23] Now, uh let's let's move on here. He
[1:43:26] says, "Now,
[1:43:28] in um Srian church age,
[1:43:34] allelujah, listen carefully." Now, now
[1:43:38] it's not up here, okay? He says, 'Now
[1:43:41] according to the word, this is from the
[1:43:42] Samriian church age, the bride will be
[1:43:44] chosen before the foundations of the
[1:43:47] world.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; This choosing of the bride was purposed
[1:43:51] in himself.
[1:43:54] God chooses his own church. You listen,
[1:43:56] you don't choose God.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I went to the altar and I gave my
[1:43:59] heart to the Lord Jesus. No, no. He was
[1:44:01] searching you out.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; You finally surrendered
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; and you came to the present truth
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; of the word of God. It's God choosing
[1:44:10] you because he knew you would receive
[1:44:12] the word because you were the word for
[1:44:15] this day.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; That's why word meets word.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so he says in Ephesians 1:9
[1:44:23] and in Romans 9:11 it says that the
[1:44:26] purpose of God according to election
[1:44:28] might stand. He says you can't read it
[1:44:32] any other way. the heart, the purpose,
[1:44:35] the eternal purpose of God was to take a
[1:44:37] bride of his own choosing and that
[1:44:40] purpose was in himself and being eternal
[1:44:44] was decreed before the foundation of the
[1:44:47] world. Watch carefully. He says now and
[1:44:50] see this before there was even a speck
[1:44:52] of stardust before God was God. Imagine
[1:44:58] before God was even God which God is an
[1:45:00] object of worship and adoration and no
[1:45:03] one uh and and no one was there to
[1:45:06] worship him. So he was at that time only
[1:45:10] potentially God.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Think about it in the beginning. Amen.
[1:45:16] And he known only as eternal spirit but
[1:45:20] the bride was already in his mind. You
[1:45:23] were already in his thoughts
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; because he wanted to express this
[1:45:28] thought of being a family, being a
[1:45:30] father. How do you how do you become a
[1:45:32] father? You need a son. I didn't become
[1:45:35] a father until my first child was born.
[1:45:38] Amen. And God didn't become father until
[1:45:40] Adam was expressed.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here now he says uh um he says
[1:45:47] yes.
[1:45:48] And the bride was already in his mind.
[1:45:50] Yes, she was. She was existing in his
[1:45:53] thoughts. And what about those thoughts
[1:45:55] of God? They are eternal. Are they not
[1:45:58] the eternal thoughts of God? Let me ask
[1:46:01] you, are the thoughts of God eternal?
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, they are. If you can see this, you
[1:46:07] can see many things. Yes,
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; you'll see you if you can just get your
[1:46:12] mind out of out of uh you know having a
[1:46:15] beginning and an end and that you know
[1:46:17] this sickness that there's no end to it,
[1:46:19] you know, because you you look at things
[1:46:21] from beginning to end. That's the human
[1:46:23] mind, the way it works.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Put your mind into the thoughts of the
[1:46:27] eternal God, you'll see a lot more.
[1:46:29] You'll see so much more. God is
[1:46:31] unchangeable in both essence and
[1:46:33] behavior. We have studied that and
[1:46:35] proven that already. God is infinite in
[1:46:38] his abilities. So therefore, he as God
[1:46:41] must be omniscient.
[1:46:44] And if he's omniscient, then he he is
[1:46:47] not now learning, nor is he taking
[1:46:49] counsel even within himself, nor is he
[1:46:53] at any time adding to his knowledge. Do
[1:46:56] we have an understanding of God here?
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have new thoughts.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; God doesn't decide, I'm going to save
[1:47:02] you today and lose you tomorrow.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; No. God doesn't run his business that
[1:47:07] way. Amen. Praise God. He's omniscient.
[1:47:10] He doesn't have a new thought about
[1:47:13] anything because all his thoughts he has
[1:47:16] always had and always will have and
[1:47:19] knows the end from the beginning. The
[1:47:22] because he is God. Thus the thoughts of
[1:47:25] God are eternal. They are real. They are
[1:47:28] not simply like a man with a blueprint
[1:47:31] he has drawn up and which one day will
[1:47:34] be translated into substance and form
[1:47:37] but they are already real and eternal
[1:47:40] and a part of God.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And that's what you are as an attribute
[1:47:46] son or daughter of God.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's bring it into we want to
[1:47:53] we want to get to to to where we we need
[1:47:55] to recognize the prophet. Amen. Now,
[1:47:58] this is what the prophet did for us.
[1:48:00] That's why all these quotes that I'm
[1:48:02] reading, they they come from from
[1:48:04] William Branham because as a prophet, he
[1:48:08] was able to go into the back part of
[1:48:10] God's mind to know exactly who we are,
[1:48:15] where we come from, where we are, and
[1:48:18] where we're going.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; This is why, you know, the people that
[1:48:22] don't understand that God said, "Look at
[1:48:25] John. Look, look at Luther, okay? Martin
[1:48:28] Luther. There's Lutheran churches all
[1:48:30] over the world. Why? Because God sent a
[1:48:34] Martin Luther to receive revelation on
[1:48:37] the just shall live by faith. And it
[1:48:40] produced a movement. And today, you got
[1:48:42] thousands of churches all over the
[1:48:44] world, but they're not calling him a
[1:48:46] cult
[1:48:47] because he's all part of the
[1:48:48] reformation. You see, but when the word
[1:48:51] any time that the word came in the
[1:48:54] present stage of its ministry, go back
[1:48:56] and check it yourself. The people, the
[1:48:59] majority always rejected it.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Go back.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you something that isn't
[1:49:06] true. They always rejected the truth for
[1:49:09] their day, the majority of the people.
[1:49:12] But it wasn't meant for the majority. It
[1:49:14] was meant for the sons and daughters of
[1:49:16] God
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; that were in that particular age or
[1:49:19] dispensation.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; They would receive the word for their
[1:49:22] day. They would manifest the word for
[1:49:24] their day. They received an anointing to
[1:49:26] manifest the word for their day. And God
[1:49:29] God moved on. That's why in the dark
[1:49:33] ages, all those heretics they called
[1:49:35] Christian heretics, they fed them to the
[1:49:38] lions. They put them into the
[1:49:39] gladiators. They chopped them into
[1:49:41] pieces. They had an anointing on them to
[1:49:44] fulfill the portion of the word that
[1:49:47] they were for that day. And they went in
[1:49:49] there praising God
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; because they had a revelation of God for
[1:49:54] their day.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; You understand? You see the importance
[1:49:57] of recognizing your messenger, the
[1:50:00] messenger that God sends to to your age
[1:50:02] in particular because he and especially
[1:50:05] in this age where now the fullness of
[1:50:08] the word was going to be made known
[1:50:11] where God was now going to you know that
[1:50:13] you know the lamb that was slain from
[1:50:15] before the foundations of the world. He
[1:50:17] took a book out of the one that sat in
[1:50:19] the throne. He took that book. What was
[1:50:22] that book? It was the book that Adam
[1:50:24] lost back in the Garden of Eden, which
[1:50:27] was the book of inheritance. That's why
[1:50:30] we're adopted sons of God. We're being
[1:50:33] positionally placed because our names
[1:50:36] were in the book.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; And the reason why you come out of
[1:50:39] denominational churches and you come out
[1:50:41] of man-made teaching, you come out of
[1:50:43] new age movement is because God is
[1:50:46] calling you.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about. son,
[1:50:49] the calling of the sons of God, wherever
[1:50:52] they are, they got to come out
[1:50:55] of that denominational
[1:50:57] church organized religion because Jesus
[1:51:01] was never ever in it. Never.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; He rebuked it.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; He told them, "Because of your
[1:51:08] traditions, you've made my word no
[1:51:10] effect to the people."
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; But he went on, "My sheep hear my
[1:51:14] voice."
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; He's still He's still speaking to us
[1:51:17] today. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:51:20] And so now he goes on here. He says,
[1:51:24] "Now then here we are coming to a
[1:51:27] conclusion. As the eternal logos, God
[1:51:30] was manifest in the Son and Jesus dwelt
[1:51:35] all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
[1:51:39] Now what does the scripture say? All
[1:51:40] that was in God, God poured into Christ.
[1:51:44] and all that was in Christ, God is
[1:51:47] pouring into the church. It's all God.
[1:51:52] That's why Jesus could say, "You'll know
[1:51:54] on that day that the father is in me, I
[1:51:57] in him, you in me, and I in you."
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Because we're going to become one.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; The whole plan of the family coming
[1:52:06] together.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; This is what we're This is the message
[1:52:09] of the hour, saints. Amen. And so here
[1:52:12] now he goes on he says and that eternal
[1:52:14] one was the father manifest in flesh and
[1:52:18] there thereby gained the title of son.
[1:52:22] So in other words when the spirit of god
[1:52:26] was in Adam
[1:52:29] in the beginning he was in the image of
[1:52:31] god he was god man in spirit form but he
[1:52:36] didn't have a body yet. That's why he he
[1:52:40] took of the dust of the earth so that
[1:52:42] Adam could till the soil. In other
[1:52:44] words, so that he could have five five
[1:52:46] senses and then he created the the the
[1:52:50] flesh man. Adam, okay? But he was flesh
[1:52:55] and bone. That's why Jesus said flesh
[1:52:58] and bone when he was here on earth and
[1:53:00] he had been resurrected. He didn't say
[1:53:02] flesh and blood because the blood is the
[1:53:04] Holy Ghost. The the blood is the life.
[1:53:07] It's eternal. It's It doesn't have an
[1:53:10] ending or a beginning. The bodies that
[1:53:12] we're going to have here on earth are
[1:53:14] going to be theophony bodies combined
[1:53:17] with glorified bodies so that we can
[1:53:19] dwell on this earth. Theophony bodies is
[1:53:22] what Jesus was in the beginning when he
[1:53:26] was expressed let us. Who was us when
[1:53:30] when God was speaking and said let us?
[1:53:32] It was him in in the word him in the
[1:53:35] logos. him and his thoughts. People
[1:53:39] people don't understand that because he
[1:53:41] was the self-existent one.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; And so when he said, "Let us make man in
[1:53:47] our image." He wanted to make man to
[1:53:50] express it on the earth. Because he had
[1:53:52] created the earth for a purpose.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; So that his family could dwell on it.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; This is the plan of redemption. This is
[1:53:59] the mystery of God. This is what has
[1:54:02] baffled the people all the way up until
[1:54:04] this day.
[1:54:06] If you tell the people this is
[1:54:08] Christianity and they've got some
[1:54:11] representation in them and they have
[1:54:13] that awareness, they're going to say,
[1:54:15] "What
[1:54:16] you mean I've been caught up into all of
[1:54:19] this Christian culture and religious?"
[1:54:22] We are not even religious.
[1:54:26] People say, "Oh, you're so religious." I
[1:54:28] said, "I'm not religious.
[1:54:30] I I might be spiritual in that I've
[1:54:33] recognized almighty God,
[1:54:36] okay? And I understand the plan of
[1:54:39] redemption. I understand that I was I I
[1:54:41] was with him before this whole thing
[1:54:43] here.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; And now I'm being redeemed back to who I
[1:54:48] originally was,
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; a son of God. I'm being called back to
[1:54:52] my original position,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; what God had in his thoughts before. And
[1:54:57] so here he goes eternal in his thoughts
[1:55:00] in our turn. Now he goes now even so we
[1:55:06] okay let me start back. Let me go. And
[1:55:08] that eternal one was the father manifest
[1:55:11] in flesh and there thereby
[1:55:15] gained the title of son.
[1:55:18] Even so we eternal in his thoughts in
[1:55:22] our turn became the many membered spoken
[1:55:26] word seed manifest in flesh and those
[1:55:32] eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh
[1:55:36] are sons of God.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Even as we are socalled
[1:55:44] that's why we're calling sons of God.
[1:55:46] We're coming to our We're coming out of
[1:55:49] our amnesia
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; to who we really are in this day and in
[1:55:53] this hour. Amen. So, let's move on here.
[1:55:57] You're going to give me some time,
[1:55:58] right?
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We got time between
[1:56:01] now and the and the dinner. So, let let
[1:56:04] me finish what I've got here. Amen.
[1:56:06] Let's go to the next scripture
[1:56:09] in Thessalonians. Now, we kind of got
[1:56:11] into this last week, right? And we and
[1:56:14] this is where we're now continuing from.
[1:56:16] But the Lord added, you know, some some
[1:56:19] inspiration there, you know, for for
[1:56:21] this morning. So here now he says, "For
[1:56:23] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:56:26] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[1:56:28] the archangel, and with the trump of
[1:56:30] God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:56:32] first. Then we which are alive and
[1:56:34] remain shall re shall be shall be caught
[1:56:36] up together with them in the clouds to
[1:56:40] meet the Lord in the air. and so shall
[1:56:43] we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore
[1:56:46] comfort one another with these words.
[1:56:49] Now, this is the scripture that that
[1:56:52] describes the the rapture of the church,
[1:56:56] okay? That we which are alive and
[1:56:58] remain, okay, there's going to be a
[1:57:00] shout. Now, that shout, I'm going to say
[1:57:03] it straight out. That shout started for
[1:57:07] this age in 1963 when the mighty angel
[1:57:12] met William Branham on Mount Sunset
[1:57:17] in 1963.
[1:57:20] This is the message of the hour. This is
[1:57:23] what's bringing us the faith for this
[1:57:26] fulfillment here because he comes down
[1:57:29] with the voice of the archangel. Now, if
[1:57:31] you go back and read Revelations 10,
[1:57:33] that that in the days of the voice,
[1:57:36] well, first it starts out and it talks
[1:57:38] about that there was a there was one
[1:57:40] that stood on the on the land and on the
[1:57:41] sea and it was the mighty angel. Okay?
[1:57:44] And he had a cloud, a rainbow over his
[1:57:46] head. Amen. And he had a book in his
[1:57:49] hand and the book was open. Amen. And he
[1:57:52] said, "Time shall be no more." And and
[1:57:54] then it goes on and it said that when
[1:57:56] you go down to to chap to verse 10, it
[1:57:58] says, "And in the days verse seven, in
[1:58:00] the days of the voice of the the the
[1:58:05] angel, okay, the mystery of God would be
[1:58:10] finished." So now we need to understand
[1:58:12] that the mighty angel that came down in
[1:58:15] 1963 with the book, remember who had the
[1:58:19] book? The lamb. Who was worthy to open
[1:58:22] the book? the lamb. And so now here
[1:58:25] comes the mighty angel himself, which is
[1:58:28] Christ.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; That was the second coming of Christ.
[1:58:31] That's why you see us wear these cloud
[1:58:32] pins because that cloud showed itself in
[1:58:36] 1963 over Sunset Mountain. And to this
[1:58:39] day, science cannot explain it. But it
[1:58:42] was the mighty God himself in the form
[1:58:46] of seven angels come down to open the
[1:58:50] seven seals of of the book that had been
[1:58:53] sealed.
[1:58:55] Now the mighty angel was God himself
[1:58:58] come down to meet an earthly angel.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; William Brham was in a prophetic
[1:59:05] ministry. He was the prophet of Malachi
[1:59:08] 4:5. And the word of the Lord always
[1:59:11] comes to the prophet.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; And so the son of man, which was Christ,
[1:59:17] was coming to a son of man, which was
[1:59:20] the prophet on the earth. Because the
[1:59:24] the mighty angel was now the the lamb
[1:59:26] was now going to open those seven seals
[1:59:30] that were containing the mystery of God,
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; which had been hidden from the
[1:59:35] foundations of the world, which was
[1:59:37] God's plan to have a family here on
[1:59:39] earth with all the names of those that
[1:59:42] were in that book.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Right? But there had to be a prophet
[1:59:46] because the word of the Lord always
[1:59:48] comes to the prophets.
[1:59:51] And he received now the opening over the
[1:59:56] next week in in March. Okay. After this
[1:59:59] visitation in March, he set up to have
[2:00:02] these meetings to open the seven seals.
[2:00:05] Okay? And during each of those nights,
[2:00:09] an angel would meet with William Brham
[2:00:12] in his office. Yeah, you're hearing it
[2:00:14] right.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; An angel.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Because he didn't know what was written
[2:00:19] under those seven seals.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; He had an idea. But he said, "Boy, thank
[2:00:24] God that the mighty angel came down and
[2:00:26] sent those seven angels to come and open
[2:00:30] each one of those seals to me
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; so that I could understand what was
[2:00:34] written under those seals." If you want
[2:00:35] to know and you want to look into it
[2:00:37] deeper, go back and read the revelation
[2:00:40] of the seven seals. You will be able to
[2:00:43] see what was all the mysteries that were
[2:00:45] written within there.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; But the mystery that we are feasting on
[2:00:49] now is the mystery of Christ which was
[2:00:51] under the seventh seal.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Okay, that is something that that it
[2:00:56] needs to be revealed personal to each
[2:00:59] and every one of us. I don't mean to be
[2:01:02] confusing, but there's only so much that
[2:01:04] I can say. All right. You're going to
[2:01:06] because the the the opening even even
[2:01:08] what I'm saying right now and everything
[2:01:10] that I'm speaking on, if it's not by
[2:01:13] revelation revealed to you, it's it's
[2:01:16] going to be confusing to you.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. But remember,
[2:01:21] Jesus promised that he would that he
[2:01:23] would build his church on divine
[2:01:25] revelation. He would reveal it to you
[2:01:28] personal.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; So when that when you read the word,
[2:01:31] it'll make sense to you. It'll it'll
[2:01:33] it'll speak right back to you. Just
[2:01:35] understand what I you know I can only
[2:01:36] speak to you what I'm what what I'm
[2:01:38] experiencing. And those that are sons
[2:01:40] and daughters of God, they know what I'm
[2:01:42] talking about.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; The word speaks right clearly back into
[2:01:46] your heart. The revelation of the word
[2:01:48] becomes a reality. Amen. And so in that
[2:01:52] 7-day period, God un God revealed all
[2:01:55] the mysteries from from serpent seed to
[2:01:59] Godhead to all kinds of mysteries that
[2:02:02] that were that were kind of known but
[2:02:04] the people were confused on. Okay. But
[2:02:08] in that seventh seal contained, because
[2:02:10] if you go back to Revelations 10, you'll
[2:02:13] hear that there was seven thunders that
[2:02:16] uttered their voices when the mighty
[2:02:18] angel came down. And John was told not
[2:02:22] to write what was under those thunders
[2:02:25] because it was not yet time
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; for it to be revealed, but it is now.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to understand what was in
[2:02:33] those written what was what was under
[2:02:36] those se what was under that seventh
[2:02:38] seal and what was uttered in those
[2:02:41] thunders
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; because the voice of God thunders.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's and and there's
[2:02:47] there's a there's a revelation behind it
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; and it's something that has to be
[2:02:52] revealed personally. It's not something
[2:02:54] that you can just give to somebody.
[2:02:56] Amen. And so let's go to the next quote
[2:03:00] here.
[2:03:01] So, three things happen. A voice, a
[2:03:03] shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen
[2:03:06] before Jesus appears. We're talking
[2:03:09] about the rapture.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Now, a shout, Jesus does all three of
[2:03:14] them when he's descending.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; He descended in 1963.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; The shout is still now the shout. Listen
[2:03:23] what he says is the shout. He says
[2:03:25] Jesus, now he's descending a shout. What
[2:03:27] is a shout? It is the message going
[2:03:30] forth.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; This is the shout that we're talking
[2:03:34] about right here, right now.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; You hear me shouting. Maybe last week
[2:03:38] you heard brother Mike shouting. You
[2:03:40] heard him, you know, get all excited
[2:03:41] because there was a shout inside of him
[2:03:43] that needed to be released because
[2:03:45] something was revealed in his heart that
[2:03:48] caused him to shout.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what's happening to
[2:03:51] the sons and daughters of God. They've
[2:03:54] received a word for their day that
[2:03:56] causes them to shout. And the shout is
[2:03:58] this message.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; This is the this is the the the the
[2:04:02] shout that's in us. Amen. I can only
[2:04:04] express it to the best of my ability.
[2:04:06] Amen. It's the message going forth
[2:04:09] first. The living bread of life bringing
[2:04:12] forth the bride. Did you hear what that
[2:04:14] said?
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; So this shout is actually a shout to the
[2:04:18] sons of God to bring them into their
[2:04:20] positions. Amen.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; It's to bring forth the bride,
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; those that will recognize the word for
[2:04:27] their day. This is the only thing that
[2:04:28] excites true Christians in this hour.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; There is no message outside of this
[2:04:34] message
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; because this is the message that
[2:04:36] produces rapturing faith.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; This is the only message that's going to
[2:04:40] give you a body change. You can talk
[2:04:42] about the rapture all day long, but if
[2:04:45] you don't have a revelation on the
[2:04:46] rapture and how God is going to quicken
[2:04:48] you that by the same listen Jesus said
[2:04:50] if Paul said if the same spirit that
[2:04:53] raised Christ from the dead dwell in
[2:04:56] you, it will speed up your molecules.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; It'll speed up your molecules to a point
[2:05:02] where you will have a dimensional change
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; in the moment. In the twinkling of an
[2:05:07] eye, you're going to put on immortality.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to understand this
[2:05:12] is a reality.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; They go to church, they talk about the
[2:05:16] rapture, but they have NO IDEA
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET THAT WOULD
[2:05:21] INTRODUCE THE MIGHTY ANGEL HIMSELF,
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF God himself so that it
[2:05:27] could be transposed down unto the bride,
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; so that the word could be given to the
[2:05:32] bride. Amen. He was just the wave
[2:05:34] sheath. William Brandham was the first
[2:05:37] son to come into manifestation.
[2:05:41] My God, we can sit here and talk about
[2:05:43] the supernatural that happened around
[2:05:45] his life.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Let's let's go on here. I'm going to
[2:05:49] keep you another 15 20 minutes. Okay,
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; that's it. Amen. He says, "Now God has a
[2:05:55] way of doing things and he's never
[2:05:57] changed his policy.
[2:06:00] He never changes. He's the unchanging
[2:06:03] God." You believe that? Amen.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; That's why you can trust him.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We had a son of man ministry. The
[2:06:11] cloud showing the presence of God which
[2:06:14] started the shel ministry in 1963. Amen.
[2:06:18] The descending of the mighty angel was
[2:06:20] Christ coming into William Brham, a son
[2:06:25] of man,
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; a prophet to reveal the seven seals.
[2:06:29] Amen.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; So when William Brham got behind that
[2:06:33] pulpit and preaching on those seals,
[2:06:36] there was a supernatural element that
[2:06:38] was in William Brandham that was
[2:06:40] preaching the word.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; It was the five-fold ministry. Amen. It
[2:06:44] was the starting of the shout of the
[2:06:46] message of the hour which would awaken
[2:06:48] the bride.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; You were not born yet. That's why,
[2:06:52] listen, when when when John saw those th
[2:06:55] those those uh thunders, he he was ready
[2:06:58] to write.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; He saw. He heard because he was a
[2:07:02] prophet. God showed him everything
[2:07:03] because he had written everything else.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; That's what the book of Revelation is
[2:07:07] all about.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; And he told John to write everything.
[2:07:09] But when that part came up, he said,
[2:07:11] "Don't write that."
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; He says, you know why? Because you
[2:07:14] weren't here yet.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; You had to be born. the rest of the
[2:07:19] body, the the earth is groaning for the
[2:07:21] manifestation of the sons of God.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; There's there's sons of God that need to
[2:07:27] come. All that the father hath given me
[2:07:29] will come.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Every last one of them, wherever they
[2:07:32] are, the last minute workers, they're
[2:07:34] going to come in. They're going to hear
[2:07:36] the word. They're going to come in. You
[2:07:38] had to be born. So that's why this faith
[2:07:41] that's being released now in this day is
[2:07:44] what's calling the sons of God.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's what's bringing them out of
[2:07:48] their their their their their
[2:07:50] traditions. It's it's pulling them away
[2:07:52] from their their their their thinking,
[2:07:54] all their amnesia. Hallelujah. Glory to
[2:07:57] God. Remember the book that John was
[2:07:59] talking about? He said, "No man was
[2:08:01] found worthy to open that book. The lamb
[2:08:04] took the book and loose the seals
[2:08:06] thereof." So Christ descended into the
[2:08:09] prophet and then from there he must
[2:08:11] descend into the bride.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; That's it. He must come into you and me
[2:08:18] now.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's the plan of
[2:08:21] redemption.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; That's the work of redemption.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; That was his plan from the beginning.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; That was the mystery of God that was
[2:08:28] hidden from the very beginning.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Now the thunders are uttering their
[2:08:32] voice in you.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you become the voice of
[2:08:36] God.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. Listen. He told John
[2:08:40] not to write, BUT GUESS WHAT HE told
[2:08:41] William Brandham? He said, "Pick up the
[2:08:43] pen." He says, "Right."
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, this is what I've been
[2:08:47] trying to tell you from the very
[2:08:48] beginning. Every seed will bring forth
[2:08:51] of its own kind."
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God, you must come
[2:08:57] forth
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; because you were in him before you came
[2:09:00] here.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; You go back and read that. You read
[2:09:03] about what what he wrote there and pick
[2:09:05] up your pen and write. You're going to
[2:09:06] see that it was the very mystery of God
[2:09:09] being revealed in you and me. He says
[2:09:12] you become the final voice.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; You become that voice in the Oh, glory
[2:09:16] to God. Hallelujah. That's why the sons
[2:09:18] of God have to manifest.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. They have the shout in them. And
[2:09:24] when you recognize the importance of the
[2:09:27] opening of those seals and in particular
[2:09:29] the seventh seal which was the opening
[2:09:33] of the book,
[2:09:36] the mysteries unleashing the thoughts of
[2:09:40] God of who we actually were.
[2:09:44] That seventh seal, that's why when
[2:09:46] William Brandham went to preach those
[2:09:47] seals,
[2:09:49] he says, "I got to stop right here."
[2:09:51] Amen.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm not I can't I'm not going
[2:09:54] to be the one to interpret this."
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Do you know that William Brandham never
[2:09:58] went beyond Revelations 10:7?
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; He never read Revelations 10 8-11.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; You'll know.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; We'll look at that a little closer next
[2:10:10] week.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to recognize the
[2:10:13] importance of the seventh seal being
[2:10:15] revealed. It's because it reveals who
[2:10:18] you really are.
[2:10:20] You are bound by circumstances of
[2:10:23] denominational teachings.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; You're bound by the traditions of man.
[2:10:28] But then God sends his word
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; to speak through the five-fold ministry.
[2:10:34] What is Ephesians chapter 4? For the
[2:10:36] perfecting of the church, for the
[2:10:40] perfecting of the saints. to bring them
[2:10:43] out of their delusion, out of their
[2:10:45] amnesia, to bring them into the present
[2:10:48] stage of the word for their day.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Traditions of Catholic
[2:10:54] teachings. You were trapped in drugs.
[2:10:57] You were trapped in addictions. You were
[2:10:59] you were one of the sons of God that
[2:11:01] Christ was going to to to descend into,
[2:11:04] but you didn't know it until you heard
[2:11:06] this message, Brother Phillip.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to understand the
[2:11:11] seventh seal and what it truly means to
[2:11:13] you as a son of God.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; I can't teach you that.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; I can only tell you what what what God
[2:11:21] has revealed in my heart, WHAT WHAT'S
[2:11:23] WHAT'S become reality in my heart.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. But once you experience it for
[2:11:28] yourself, you'll know exactly. And guess
[2:11:30] what? We'll both walk in the light
[2:11:32] together and we will have fellowship
[2:11:34] together.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Because that's where the true fellowship
[2:11:37] is.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. the message.
[2:11:40] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's
[2:11:43] read the next quote here. He says in the
[2:11:45] rapture, Amos 3:7, he said he would do
[2:11:48] nothing on earth until first he revealed
[2:11:52] it it to his servants, the prophets.
[2:11:55] Amen. And just as certain as he promised
[2:11:58] it, he'll do it. Amen.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Now, we've come through the church ages,
[2:12:03] but we're promised in the last days,
[2:12:05] according to Malachi 4, that there would
[2:12:08] be a return again, a prophet in the
[2:12:11] land. That's right. Notice his nature,
[2:12:14] what he would be like. Amen. Listen,
[2:12:17] William Brandham didn't go around
[2:12:18] bragging, I'm the prophet of Malachi 4.
[2:12:20] You'll never see him do that. Amen.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; You know that the only time that Jesus
[2:12:28] revealed himself
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; and said, "I am he," was to the woman at
[2:12:34] the well.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; You ever wonder about that? Oh, glory to
[2:12:42] God. I don't want to get ahead of
[2:12:43] myself. Hallelujah. But here now we are
[2:12:47] told that he's not going to do anything
[2:12:51] unless he reveals it through his
[2:12:54] servants, the prophets. He's the same
[2:12:56] yesterday, today, and forever. Next
[2:12:57] quote, he goes here in the token. He
[2:12:59] says, "God in every age, as I spoke last
[2:13:02] evening, he told the end from the
[2:13:05] beginning. He told what would be in each
[2:13:09] generation also God in the beginning. He
[2:13:13] told he says he says in sundried times
[2:13:16] he sent forth the prophets. When each
[2:13:19] time come for those things to happen for
[2:13:22] that age he sent forth prophets. And the
[2:13:25] word of the Lord always comes to his
[2:13:28] prophets. Amen. The prophet for that
[2:13:31] age. And each time the only thing that
[2:13:34] prophet did was to manifest exactly the
[2:13:38] promise for that age. Amen.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; So if you want to know what is to take
[2:13:43] place in the age, then you have to see
[2:13:46] what the prophet said.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's as simple as that.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now watch. He goes on here
[2:13:54] and identified Christ of all ages. Every
[2:13:57] one of the prophets displayed God's
[2:14:00] characteristics
[2:14:01] because it picked up the word for that
[2:14:04] age and identified it. God interpreted
[2:14:08] his word of that age through the man.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; So whatever God wants to reveal, he's
[2:14:16] going to reveal it through a prophet
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; in that particular age.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's it's he was the son of
[2:14:25] he was a son of man ministry. Praise
[2:14:28] God. Now go on next quote. Notice
[2:14:32] through the ages, the same way by his
[2:14:34] prophets, he has revealed himself.
[2:14:38] Them wasn't exactly prophets. They were
[2:14:41] gods.
[2:14:43] They were gods. He said so. For what
[2:14:45] they spoke was God's word.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; When a prophet said, "Thus sayaeth the
[2:14:49] Lord," that wasn't a man speaking.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; That was God speaking through a man.
[2:14:56] William Brandham anytime he said thus
[2:14:58] sayeth the Lord you go back you do your
[2:15:00] own research you check back doctor's
[2:15:03] affidavits dead brought back to life
[2:15:05] again truckloads of crutches and
[2:15:09] stretchers taken out of meetings because
[2:15:12] people came in in stretchers that were
[2:15:14] crippled from birth walking out of those
[2:15:17] meetings
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; more supernatural took place under that
[2:15:21] ministry than than any other ministry on
[2:15:24] earth up until that time.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Go back and and and check the history.
[2:15:31] Amen. So he says here that wasn't
[2:15:33] exactly prophets. They were gods. He
[2:15:35] said so. For what they spoke was God's
[2:15:38] word. They were the flesh that God was
[2:15:40] veiled in.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; They were gods. Jesus said himself. Say,
[2:15:44] "How can you condemn me when I say I am
[2:15:47] the son of God?" and you owe and you and
[2:15:50] your own law says that them who the word
[2:15:53] of of the Lord came to was God's.
[2:15:56] But yet they condemned and they
[2:15:58] crucified Christ because because they
[2:16:02] knew that when he said, you know, this
[2:16:05] day this scripture is fulfilled, he was
[2:16:08] indirectly telling them that he was God.
[2:16:12] And Jesus said, why do you condemn me?
[2:16:14] He said be and they said we we we don't
[2:16:17] condemn you for the miracles that you're
[2:16:18] doing but we're condemning you for you
[2:16:20] are saying that you are God.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; You see they couldn't take that
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; and that's what happens in every age
[2:16:27] when God comes in the form of his word
[2:16:29] they reject him.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; They can't receive him.
[2:16:34] And so next quote
[2:16:38] he says now so it was God formed in a
[2:16:42] man called a prophet. See and the word
[2:16:46] of the Lord came to this man. So it
[2:16:49] wasn't the prophet the prophet was the
[2:16:52] veil but the word was God.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; The man's word won't act like that. See
[2:16:58] what I mean? It cannot act in that
[2:17:01] manner. But potentially it was God. See,
[2:17:04] he was the word of God in the form of a
[2:17:06] man called a man.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice he never changed his
[2:17:11] nature. Only his form. God has never
[2:17:15] changed his nature. That's how we know
[2:17:18] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:17:20] forever. He honors his word. Amen. He's
[2:17:23] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:17:25] So now the reason why I laid in all
[2:17:28] these quotes about God sending a
[2:17:30] prophet, now we want to just look
[2:17:32] closely here and see how it was that God
[2:17:36] vindicated this man.
[2:17:39] We need to see what God was trying to
[2:17:41] display through William Branham.
[2:17:44] Amen. So here now when you start to
[2:17:47] think look at go back I can't bring all
[2:17:50] the quotes but I can tell you he was one
[2:17:54] day squirrel hunting
[2:17:57] now God is God is showing us here what
[2:18:02] was produced in William Branham was now
[2:18:05] going to produce itself in us.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; We need to see that. Okay. And so
[2:18:11] William Branham had one day going
[2:18:14] squirrel hunting and the Holy Spirit
[2:18:16] comes that voice the angel that had met
[2:18:18] him so many times tells him where do you
[2:18:20] want the squirrels?
[2:18:22] He says speak them.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; And he was a man.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; But yet he was displaying something in
[2:18:31] the form of a God man.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; He was a man when he was there preaching
[2:18:36] the gospel. But when he spoke and said,
[2:18:38] "The squirrel is going to come up out of
[2:18:39] that tree and it's going to sit on that
[2:18:42] on that uh on that limb there." And and
[2:18:44] and he shot it. And there it came. Boom.
[2:18:47] Came right up. He shot it. Went and took
[2:18:50] it. It was actual squirrel.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Spoken word into existence.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; That was God in a man.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; That was God vindicating his word.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was God when when when God
[2:19:05] showed him they'd gone fishing and a
[2:19:08] fish had died and the intrs of the fish,
[2:19:10] the hook had pulled out the intros of
[2:19:12] that fish and he was with a Jehovah
[2:19:15] Witness friend of his. And God showed
[2:19:17] him that he was going to that something
[2:19:20] was going to come back to life again.
[2:19:22] And he didn't quite understand what it
[2:19:23] was. And then the Holy Spirit came into
[2:19:25] the boat and said, "Speak to that fish
[2:19:29] and give that fish back its life."
[2:19:32] And he said that same voice he in his
[2:19:34] mind that same voice that had spoken to
[2:19:37] him and told him to speak to squirrels
[2:19:38] that was the same voice. So he looked at
[2:19:40] he says little fishy I GIVE YOU BACK
[2:19:42] your life in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:45] That fish jumped, turned and dove right
[2:19:47] into the water
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; dead for an hour.
[2:19:52] Why am I saying this? I'm not saying
[2:19:53] this to,
[2:19:56] you know, play supernatural and and and
[2:19:59] witchcraft and everything else. No, I'm
[2:20:01] I'm showing you through the word of God
[2:20:04] that God sent a prophet
[2:20:07] whom the word of the Lord came to to
[2:20:09] vindicate in this 20th century what he
[2:20:13] was going to do in this race of people.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. in this dispensation,
[2:20:21] in the people that would receive the
[2:20:23] word for their day
[2:20:25] when he was on that Colorado mountain
[2:20:27] and they were stuck up there hunting for
[2:20:29] 4 days and a storm decides to come in
[2:20:33] and that storm came in with with a
[2:20:35] vengeance. It covered them within
[2:20:37] minutes and brother Brandham was stuck
[2:20:39] there in the storm and the brothers were
[2:20:42] all back at the camp. And then the Holy
[2:20:44] Spirit, that same God, the angel of the
[2:20:46] Lord came and said to him, he says,
[2:20:50] "What would you want? You you the way
[2:20:53] you say it, you speak to that storm, the
[2:20:56] way you say it, that's the way it's
[2:20:58] going to be." And he said, "Clouds go
[2:21:00] back. I rebuke you." He said, "Son, come
[2:21:03] forth and shine for the next four days
[2:21:06] because we are hunting here." And within
[2:21:08] minutes, everything just the clouds just
[2:21:11] took within seconds. Everything just
[2:21:13] moved. Boom. The sun came up. When
[2:21:15] brother Brandham went back to the camp,
[2:21:17] those brothers said, "You were out
[2:21:18] there, weren't you?"
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; We seen something happen over there that
[2:21:22] we can't explain.
[2:21:24] But that was God showing that there was
[2:21:27] a son of God on the earth
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; that would be displaying the attribute
[2:21:32] of God
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; that would show that God was desiring to
[2:21:36] to show that there would be sons of God
[2:21:39] that would live on the earth
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; with God and manifest the word like God.
[2:21:44] Amen.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; That's what that was said for.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when we look at the
[2:21:50] prophet, we we see the supernatural. We
[2:21:54] But we're looking at the God that was in
[2:21:56] the prophet.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; That's what we're that's what we're we
[2:22:00] hear. That's the revelation that we're
[2:22:02] receiving
[2:22:04] as the church in this hour. We're not
[2:22:06] here just to play the tapes.
[2:22:09] Are you going to hear this playing the
[2:22:10] tapes where you we're we're where we
[2:22:13] bring it to our day to the hour that
[2:22:15] we're living in to where you're in a
[2:22:17] situation you need supernatural
[2:22:20] deliverance. You need God to move in
[2:22:22] your life. You need things to change in
[2:22:24] your heart. You need God to become a
[2:22:26] reality in your life. You're just living
[2:22:28] like anybody else. You're just a
[2:22:30] another, you know, just another uh oh,
[2:22:32] I'm a Christian. I'm a Christian. Well,
[2:22:33] what does it mean to be a Christian?
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; There should be a supernatural element
[2:22:38] around your life at all times. Amen.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; A recognition of God.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, what was God showing?
[2:22:48] What he was going to do in us? And look,
[2:22:52] next quote here. And we're winding down
[2:22:54] here. Just a couple more quotes. And I
[2:22:56] know this is a little chopped up, but
[2:22:58] God help us to just catch the the
[2:23:02] essence of what God is trying to tell us
[2:23:04] here. Amen. He says in the rising of a
[2:23:06] sun, he says in the rising of the sun,
[2:23:08] as Christ was the first one to raise
[2:23:11] from all the prophets and so forth,
[2:23:13] although typed in many places, he was
[2:23:15] the first fruits of those that slept in
[2:23:19] the bride, coming of Christ, coming out
[2:23:22] of the church. There'll have to be a
[2:23:25] sheath waved again in the last days. Oh
[2:23:28] my. Waving of the sheath. What was the
[2:23:31] sheath? The first one that come to
[2:23:33] maturity. the first one that proved that
[2:23:35] it was a wheat that proved that it was a
[2:23:38] sheath. Hallelujah. I'm sure you see
[2:23:40] what I'm talking about. It was waved
[2:23:42] over the people. That's what William
[2:23:44] Brham was. He was he was a wave sheath
[2:23:47] of a son of God that would manifest and
[2:23:50] receive the the the power of God in his
[2:23:53] life
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; to show us that that is what we will
[2:23:57] become.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; When they would take the wave sheath of
[2:24:00] the first mature, they would wave it
[2:24:02] before the people. Amen.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; And a prophet has been waved to this
[2:24:06] 20th gen 20th century. A prophet is
[2:24:09] being waved before the people. And now
[2:24:11] God is waving his bride before the
[2:24:14] people so that they can recognize that
[2:24:16] he's alive. He's the same yesterday,
[2:24:19] today, and forever. And that he's going
[2:24:21] to BRING SONS OF GOD into maturity, into
[2:24:24] the manifestation of sons.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Next quote. He says,
[2:24:30] "And the first time there will come
[2:24:31] forth for the bride age, for a
[2:24:35] resurrection, out of dark
[2:24:37] denominationalism."
[2:24:39] Hear it now. What was the cry of the
[2:24:41] prophet? Come out of her, my people.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; God is not in denomination. You will not
[2:24:48] find him there. You will never find him
[2:24:50] there. Anytime they denominated the word
[2:24:53] of God, he just moved on out.
[2:24:58] They know not what they worship. They
[2:25:00] have a form of godliness.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; But they deny the power of God.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "But for a resurrection out of
[2:25:09] dark denominationalism will be a
[2:25:11] message." This message that the full
[2:25:15] maturity of the word has turned back
[2:25:17] again in its full power. There was never
[2:25:21] a time where this message that we're
[2:25:24] preaching right now, this revelation
[2:25:26] that we are feasting on,
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; it was never available until now.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; For you, it's now.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; That's why for a lot of people, the
[2:25:34] coming of the Lord, yeah, I tell you, he
[2:25:36] came down with the shout in 1963, but it
[2:25:39] wasn't until 1991 that that shout had an
[2:25:42] effect on that attribute that was in me
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; or 1994, sorry. It was then that the
[2:25:49] attribute woke up and something started
[2:25:52] to take place. What was it? It was the
[2:25:55] coming of the Lord to me.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; And when the coming of the Lord is to
[2:25:59] you, it'll be because the word unveils
[2:26:02] itself to you.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden now you see that the
[2:26:05] full maturity of the word has turned
[2:26:07] back again in its full power and being
[2:26:10] waved over the people by the same signs
[2:26:13] and wonders that he did back there.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Nobody can tell me
[2:26:18] that there was more signs and wonders
[2:26:20] than what was in that prophet's
[2:26:21] ministry.
[2:26:23] And today, the bride is displaying the
[2:26:28] same revelation
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; that was in the prophet.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; The bride will come into a change.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; She's now being positioned by the word
[2:26:39] of God.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; And she has a ministry.
[2:26:43] The ministry did not end with William
[2:26:45] Branham.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; We listen to the tapes. WE FEED ON THE
[2:26:49] TAPES. We recognize I just finished. WE
[2:26:52] DON'T HAVE a message without William
[2:26:53] Brandon. We don't have a message.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; But the message is now in you.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; It's now your turn.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; It's now your part.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU'VE GOT THUS SAYETH the Lord IN
[2:27:05] YOU. NOT JUST TO COME OUT AND SPEAK IT
[2:27:08] WHEN YOU WANT.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; No sir. It'll be when GOD WANTS TO SHOUT
[2:27:12] THE WORD OF GOD to bring forth sons and
[2:27:15] daughters of God.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE'S THE FINAL VOICE in this
[2:27:19] age.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He says, "Now listen,
[2:27:23] when the prophet was sent, it was God
[2:27:25] sending his word, not a man. It was
[2:27:28] God."
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; The word always comes to the prophets.
[2:27:31] And a son of man displaying the son of
[2:27:34] man. Amen. To die. Today it's the son of
[2:27:39] man in bride form
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; because there's an invisible union
[2:27:44] that's taking place
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; there's a marriage that's taking place.
[2:27:48] Remember in the beginning, Adam when he
[2:27:52] was when he was made in the image of
[2:27:54] God, male and female created he them and
[2:27:59] called their name called their name.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Called their name Adam,
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; not Eve,
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Adam.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't until he took Eve from his
[2:28:14] side that there that that actually
[2:28:16] brought forth the fall. Yes, sir.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; THE DECEPTION.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY the church is in deception.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; But not THE BRIDE.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE HAS COME OUT OF THE CHURCH.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE DOES. IT CALLS
[2:28:31] THE BRIDE OUT OF THE CHURCH.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; If you're in a church and you're in a
[2:28:35] denomination and you're under a teaching
[2:28:37] of man, you need to come out of that
[2:28:39] church to be in the mystical body of
[2:28:42] Jesus Christ.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; That's the body that's going to be
[2:28:45] raptured. Amen.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, so in conclusion here,
[2:28:51] like we could just go on, saints, but I
[2:28:53] want to be done here by 1:30. Let the
[2:28:55] musicians come.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; The final quote here,
[2:29:05] because I live,
[2:29:08] ye live also.
[2:29:12] This message is alive
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; in the bride.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; It's because he lives in you that you
[2:29:21] can live.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Speaking to his wife, because I
[2:29:25] live, ye live also. What a resurrection
[2:29:28] that was. And what a resurrection this
[2:29:32] is. Amen.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; To be quickened from the dead, to be
[2:29:36] made alive in Jesus Christ by God's
[2:29:40] quickening power. He was he was waved to
[2:29:43] them. The word which he was was waved
[2:29:47] back to them on the day of Pentecost.
[2:29:50] The word made manifest. Now, as I say,
[2:29:54] it's to be waved again in the last days.
[2:29:58] Amen. And until the prophet's message
[2:30:02] which which he brought forth said that
[2:30:05] this that there would be a bride that
[2:30:07] would be raptured that that that there
[2:30:09] would be a change that would come over
[2:30:11] the people until that word is fulfilled
[2:30:14] until uh Thessalonians
[2:30:17] until Corinthians that says that this
[2:30:20] body shall put on immortality. Until
[2:30:23] that is fulfilled, we will have a
[2:30:26] ministry here on the earth. And we will
[2:30:28] be the voice of God here on the earth in
[2:30:32] the last days. If it's going to be a
[2:30:34] voice, it's not going to be just the
[2:30:36] prophet's voice, but we are going to say
[2:30:39] what the prophet said. Amen. And we're
[2:30:42] going to recognize how it pertains to us
[2:30:44] and how we are the word in our day.
[2:30:48] Amen. Praise God forever more.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; What a shout.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that song. Shout to the Lord.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; I think there's a shout in the bride. I
[2:31:00] believe there's a shout in our hearts.
[2:31:02] It's this very message that we're
[2:31:04] feasting on in this day and in this
[2:31:05] hour. It's a shout that that we we can't
[2:31:08] contain it. We've got to speak it. We've
[2:31:10] got to tell the people. The people need
[2:31:13] to know what true Christianity is all
[2:31:15] about. They need to recognize what God
[2:31:17] is doing in our day. It's important for
[2:31:20] us to take this message and allow the
[2:31:23] voice of God to be in us to speak the
[2:31:27] word and to let the people know what the
[2:31:29] word is for this day to let them know
[2:31:31] what God has done in this day.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:36] Shout
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; the Lord all the earth. Let us sing.
[2:31:48] Power and majesty,
[2:31:51] praise to the king
[2:31:59] will roar at the sound
[2:32:03] of the voice
[2:32:14] forever. I love you forever. I stand.
[2:32:21] Nothing compares to the proise
[2:32:26] in you.
[2:32:34] My Jesus,
[2:32:37] my savior.
[2:32:39] Father, there is none like you.
[2:32:44] All of my names
[2:32:48] I want to praise
[2:32:50] for wonders of your mighty
[2:32:56] love.
[2:33:00] My comfort,
[2:33:03] my shu
[2:33:08] strength.
[2:33:10] Let every breath
[2:33:13] all I have
[2:33:16] never cease to worship
[2:33:21] you.
[2:33:24] Shout to the Lord on the earth. Let us
[2:33:28] sing.
[2:33:30] Power and majest
[2:33:34] to the king
[2:33:37] bow down and the seas will rule at the
[2:33:43] sound of your name.
[2:33:49] I sing for joy what new works of your
[2:33:53] hand.
[2:33:55] Forever I love you. Forever I stand.
[2:34:02] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[2:34:07] in you.
[2:34:10] Nothing compares.
[2:34:14] Oh, nothing compares to the promise.
[2:34:19] Nothing compares nothing compares to the
[2:34:23] pro.
[2:34:26] Oh, nothing compares
[2:34:29] to the promise
[2:34:33] in you.
[2:34:36] Hallelujah.
[2:34:38] Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:34:42] He's here.
[2:34:44] Elijah, God is with us today.

[2:36:04] dwelling place. Prepared by God's one
[2:36:08] power and amazing grace. She's here.
