[0:17] see the blood when i
[0:23] see the blood when i
[0:28] see the blood hallelujah
[0:31] i will pass i will pass
[0:35] over you good wednesday friends
[0:39] may the lord bless you real good
[0:43] as we come together in the house of the
[0:46] lord
[0:47] may the great holy spirit apply the
[0:51] word of god to our hearts and lives
[0:55] and to our understanding that we may
[0:58] grow
[0:59] in grace as we mature
[1:02] in jesus christ the lord bless you
[1:06] as we read from exodus chapter 12
[1:11] reading verse 13
[1:15] and the blood shall be
[1:18] to you for a token
[1:22] upon the houses where you are
[1:26] and when i see the blood
[1:30] i will pass over you
[1:33] and the plague shall not
[1:37] be upon you to destroy you
[1:40] when i smite the land
[1:44] of egypt praise be to god
[1:49] my friends it's roundup time
[1:53] it's going home time now you know in the
[1:57] old west or in the pampas
[2:00] of brazil uh uh or
[2:04] any of those great south american
[2:08] nations there's a time
[2:11] when all the ranchers
[2:15] all the cattle ranchers move
[2:18] their herds to one place
[2:21] for ship shipping uh to
[2:24] government locations and places
[2:28] where there is the need and market for
[2:31] beef
[2:33] and therefore the government will send
[2:36] their
[2:37] their their inspectors and rangers
[2:41] to uh inspect the cattle
[2:45] that have been rounded up
[2:49] now of course because the cattle are
[2:52] owned by many many ranchers
[2:57] they will all have different differing
[3:00] brands various brands
[3:04] just as in like the churches of today
[3:08] and like the hour and time that we are
[3:11] in the great governor above
[3:16] is now gathering in
[3:19] and so all the churches
[3:23] all the people that name the name of
[3:25] christ
[3:27] and claim him as their lord and savior
[3:32] are gathering their people in
[3:36] each one carrying their church brand
[3:40] or the name of their various
[3:43] churches upon them
[3:47] but even though they have the brands
[3:51] the government inspectors
[3:55] the angels the the
[3:59] men anointed of god
[4:02] by the great holy spirit
[4:05] are not there on the scene
[4:09] to check the brands so much
[4:13] of those cows or of the
[4:16] animals or if you want to say the angels
[4:20] checking
[4:21] the individual believer not
[4:24] as to their membership god is not
[4:28] interested
[4:29] in what church you're a member of or
[4:33] i belong to this or i'm a baptist or i'm
[4:36] a methodist or i'm a
[4:37] uh anglican or a presbyterian
[4:39] congregational
[4:41] jehovah witness whatever name you would
[4:43] like to stamp
[4:45] brand on your self your forehead your
[4:47] neck
[4:48] whatever that is your concern
[4:51] between you and your maker but
[4:56] what they are checking for
[4:59] not your church name
[5:03] not your brand name
[5:06] but god sifting out the wheat
[5:09] from the tears separating
[5:14] the chaff from the grain
[5:19] separating the genuine from the make
[5:22] believe
[5:24] he sends them to check out those
[5:28] animals with the blood test
[5:33] and i want to say the day naturally
[5:36] speaking
[5:38] all of us we need a blood test
[5:43] and more importantly we need a spiritual
[5:46] blood test
[5:48] because unknowingly uh
[5:51] we may look well we may
[5:55] act well or behave uh well
[5:59] a person may even behead like a
[6:01] christian and that could be
[6:04] evil in disguise
[6:07] so you must have the blood test
[6:11] you must be tested by the spirit of god
[6:16] as to the condition of your blood
[6:20] because you may be having bad blood
[6:24] uh you may be having mad blood
[6:27] you may be oh lord have mercy
[6:31] god help me i tell you friends you may
[6:34] be
[6:34] having some kind of mixed up
[6:37] blood flowing within your
[6:41] veins and it will take a
[6:45] real doctor of the scriptures like dr
[6:48] simon peter
[6:49] act acts chapter 2 3 and 4
[6:53] you'll find dr simon peter there
[6:56] checking the people and finally coming
[6:59] to the conclusion
[7:01] that they have some bad traditional
[7:04] blood in them and
[7:05] they need to cleanse their blood
[7:09] and the only cleansing they can have
[7:12] is by the cleansing of the blood of
[7:14] jesus christ the name of jesus christ
[7:17] repent and be baptized
[7:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[7:24] you
[7:24] shall receive the gift of the holy
[7:27] spirit
[7:28] amen may god help us today
[7:31] as we look into the word of god
[7:35] and see we need to have
[7:38] god's blood test for it's he
[7:43] is the one the great governor
[7:46] the government of heaven government of
[7:49] the kingdom
[7:51] testing his children trying them
[7:54] proofing them
[7:56] so that he uh or they
[7:59] will know who they really are
[8:03] who their real father is
[8:07] where they come from and where
[8:11] they are going so
[8:15] we are not here to look at brands
[8:18] uh we are not here to look at church
[8:20] names
[8:22] we are looking for the blood for the
[8:25] scripture
[8:27] says when i see the blood
[8:32] i will pass over you but i believe in
[8:35] our modern age lots of people are making
[8:37] the mistake
[8:40] or misreading misunderstanding this
[8:43] scripture
[8:44] for it does not say when i see your
[8:47] brand
[8:48] when i see your church name
[8:52] i will pass over you no god
[8:55] is not interested in that
[8:59] he is only interested in the blood
[9:04] and he wants to test us to see what
[9:08] blood we have in us
[9:11] as i before said you may have bad blood
[9:14] you may have
[9:15] mad blood uh you may god is not arrested
[9:19] in your race
[9:22] god is not interested in your religion
[9:27] god is not interested in your
[9:30] affiliations
[9:33] god is not interested in your
[9:35] educational
[9:37] level god is
[9:40] not interested in your financial
[9:44] matter for nothing matters to him except
[9:50] that you need that blood test
[9:54] your blood must be tested
[9:57] and if you delay you don't want to get
[10:01] it tested
[10:02] then you may find that you
[10:06] uh you suddenly grow sick
[10:10] or you're suddenly ill or you could even
[10:13] die
[10:15] just yesterday afternoon
[10:19] i was speaking with an individual
[10:22] who was letting me know how
[10:25] that their mom who is
[10:29] up in years now went to the eye doctor
[10:34] for uh an eye test
[10:37] and in testing the eye the doctor
[10:41] said from the way the blood is moving in
[10:45] your
[10:46] eye you have
[10:49] a problem with the blood
[10:52] flow in your heart
[10:55] and you'd better rush now
[10:58] and have yourself tested
[11:02] for you can you you're now open
[11:06] to getting a sudden stroke
[11:09] or you can die
[11:13] so this is an emergency
[11:16] you need to have a blood test and
[11:19] thank god that dear
[11:23] woman went to have her blood test
[11:27] and uh when she was tested
[11:30] the doctor says no you cannot even go
[11:33] home
[11:34] you have to stay right now they took her
[11:38] in operated she had a problem with her
[11:41] heart
[11:42] and if she had delayed her heart
[11:45] would blockage what would have gone on
[11:48] and she would have expired and gone to
[11:51] the great beyond
[11:53] however as of today the woman is fine
[11:57] and she is strong she is in a state of
[12:01] recovery
[12:02] and rejoicing because
[12:06] her life was saved praise
[12:09] god hallelujah oh praise god my friends
[12:13] uh i may not be a natural eye doctor
[12:17] but the holy spirit allows me to see
[12:21] things in the word amen
[12:24] and may the holy spirit by the holy
[12:27] spirit
[12:28] i want to advise you that you
[12:32] should have this blood test
[12:35] have your blood tested your cholesterol
[12:39] your different levels have it tested
[12:43] see what kind of a blood you may need
[12:46] some bitter experiences come into your
[12:50] life
[12:51] to cleanse your blood to purge
[12:55] your blood and to make it the way
[12:58] god allow it to be the way god wants it
[13:01] to be
[13:02] oh praise his marvelous wonderful
[13:06] name amen hallelujah god
[13:09] looking down says the soul
[13:12] that's in it it shall die
[13:17] because that soul is separated from him
[13:21] and it cannot approach him whatsoever
[13:25] for all have sinned and have come
[13:29] short of the glory of god
[13:32] amen but thank god
[13:36] as we look into the old testament
[13:39] when the entire human race
[13:43] was caught in the trolling of sin
[13:48] god took tell the priest
[13:51] to take an animal and
[13:55] took its life and there
[13:59] the life of the animal was taken
[14:02] instead or in substitute for
[14:07] the life of the sinner
[14:10] and so without the shedding of blood
[14:15] there is no remission of sins
[14:18] and so that sinner would have to bring a
[14:22] lamb
[14:23] up to the temple and the high priest
[14:29] would let the sinner lay his hand
[14:33] on the head of that lamb
[14:38] and there the high priest would then cut
[14:41] the trout
[14:42] of the lamb the blood will be
[14:46] spraying and sprinkling everywhere
[14:49] blood will be on the on the person that
[14:52] brought the lamb
[14:54] as their substitute amen
[14:58] and so the sinner would feel the
[15:00] bleeding and the bleed hair the bleeding
[15:03] of that lamb he will feel the body
[15:08] quivering body of that lamb before him
[15:12] as it stiffened in death before him
[15:17] and then it would be placed on the fire
[15:20] he will see the smoke of the sacrifice
[15:24] ascending up to heaven unto god
[15:28] and then my friends with joy in his
[15:32] heart
[15:33] he knew the lamb had died in his stead
[15:38] he knew the lamb had taken
[15:41] his place he knew
[15:45] that that innocent lamb
[15:48] that did nothing had forfeited
[15:52] his life instead
[15:55] of the sinner forfeiting his
[15:58] own life but and he knew
[16:02] that the lamb had forfeited his life
[16:05] so that the innocent life
[16:09] of that dying lamb could
[16:12] come back and rest upon that
[16:17] person that was a sinner as a
[16:20] covering to hide their sins from the
[16:25] holy eyes of god
[16:29] and so the blood of an animal
[16:33] not being equal or the life of animal
[16:37] not being equal to the life of a human
[16:41] could only cover sin but it could not
[16:45] take away sin therefore
[16:49] back in the old testament we find
[16:52] that they would go out with the same
[16:55] desire
[16:56] with which they came in though they were
[17:00] protected
[17:00] though they were covered they will go
[17:03] out
[17:04] with the same desire to commit sin
[17:08] as when they came in
[17:12] and thus you will find in the old
[17:15] testament scripture
[17:17] that they had to come back year
[17:20] after year to make
[17:24] sacrifices and offering
[17:27] for their sin all my friends but thank
[17:32] god
[17:34] the scene changes
[17:37] glory to his marvelous name
[17:40] for in this new testament we find
[17:46] this dying lamb
[17:49] the son of god jesus christ
[17:53] hallelujah the bible says he
[17:56] gave his life as a ransom not for one
[18:01] sinner
[18:02] but a ransom for all for many
[18:07] and by faith we walk up
[18:11] to him and we lay our hands
[18:16] upon the head of our dying lamb
[18:20] as in the words of the song dear
[18:24] dying land thy precious blood has
[18:27] never lost its power and there may i
[18:31] o praise god we lay our hands upon our
[18:34] dying lamb
[18:35] and that dying lamb being jesus christ
[18:39] hallelujah we believe that by
[18:43] holding on to him by faith amen
[18:46] amen and seeing his bloody wounds
[18:51] seeing the blood flowing from his head
[18:54] his hands and his
[18:56] feet his lacerated back with the
[19:00] roman whips upon him we feel the pain
[19:04] we hear him cry eli elia
[19:08] lama sabach and i amen my god
[19:11] my god why hast thou forsaken me
[19:16] and what happened the bible said
[19:19] he gave up the ghost
[19:22] he gave up the ghost hallelujah what
[19:25] ghost
[19:26] the holy ghost was in him
[19:29] and he gave up the ghost and so
[19:33] the life that was in him or the holy
[19:36] ghost was in him was now
[19:38] released the life that was in him
[19:42] was now free it was once in
[19:45] one man named jesus christ
[19:49] our representative but when our
[19:52] dear dying lamb laid his
[19:56] head down and gave up the holy
[20:00] ghost the holy spirit is
[20:03] now made available it's
[20:06] in the atmosphere in the world today
[20:09] available for everyone
[20:12] that will sincerely believe that
[20:16] with all their heart that the reality
[20:20] of the power of the holy spirit and the
[20:23] presence of the holy spirit
[20:25] to fill you to anoint you to take your
[20:28] life and
[20:30] make it over again and to express
[20:33] himself through you
[20:34] and use you for the glory of his
[20:37] marvelous name thank god
[20:39] the holy spirit
[20:43] who is the life
[20:46] that was in the blood
[20:50] has now come back and is here to come
[20:54] upon
[20:54] every one of us repentant sinners
[20:59] oh precious is the flow
[21:02] that makes me whiter snow no other
[21:05] fountain i know
[21:07] nothing but the blood of jesus
[21:09] hallelujah
[21:10] the life of him came back upon us
[21:15] you see as i said god has to give us the
[21:18] blood test
[21:20] amen because you need a blood test
[21:23] for the purposes of your natural health
[21:27] and of your spiritual health you need a
[21:31] blood test
[21:33] to show what is your origin
[21:37] who really is your father we're living
[21:41] in a day
[21:42] in the hour when the bible says that i
[21:44] will come
[21:45] when they're gonna take women they're
[21:48] not just gonna
[21:49] marry women they're just gonna take them
[21:52] live with them making a whole lot of
[21:54] children
[21:54] but not taking responsibility for them
[21:58] instead of marrying them and protecting
[22:01] them
[22:02] and preserving them and watching over
[22:04] them but no
[22:05] the bible says they're going to marry in
[22:07] giving
[22:08] they're going to just take women and
[22:11] carry on
[22:12] like that and so the children are born
[22:16] and one woman may have children from so
[22:18] many different fathers
[22:20] that they don't know which one is their
[22:22] father
[22:24] so many people joined so many churches
[22:26] going to this church that church
[22:29] there are baptismal methodists they're
[22:30] listed after a while their head is
[22:33] spinning their
[22:34] denominational mental chaos and don't
[22:37] know where they come from
[22:38] don't know where they're going uh
[22:41] they're more interested are
[22:43] am i going to be buried in the in the
[22:46] catholic they're real ground
[22:47] am i going to be buried in the anglican
[22:49] burial ground
[22:50] i'm not going to be buried in the
[22:52] methodist battleground
[22:54] that's not important to the real child
[22:56] of god
[22:57] because my friends when you get the real
[23:01] blood test it'll tell you that your
[23:04] father is not mr baptist mr methodist mr
[23:07] catholic mr anglican
[23:09] mr whatever he calls his name but your
[23:13] father is jehovah
[23:16] jesus god in heaven
[23:19] and you look up to him oh my father i
[23:22] repent i'm coming home lord
[23:25] i rest my navy soul in thee
[23:28] oh i give thee back the life i owe
[23:32] that in thy crimson flow it might be
[23:35] richer and
[23:36] fuller be oh praise god forevermore
[23:39] yes brother and sister that is why we
[23:42] come to him
[23:44] by for this wonderful blood test amen
[23:47] so that we might know who our father is
[23:51] many times people have a genealogy test
[23:57] and when their blood is checked they say
[24:00] oh
[24:01] that person whom you think is your
[24:03] father is not really a father
[24:06] this blood test shows that this
[24:09] person over here is your father
[24:13] oh my friend we got to have the real
[24:16] blood test
[24:18] i'm talking in the natural but i'm
[24:20] trying to point you
[24:22] to the fact that we don't go by
[24:25] church names affiliations who brought
[24:28] you
[24:29] up how many years you spent in this
[24:31] church i was too
[24:32] you know my entire life and childhood

[24:37] nothing to do with it when god checks
[24:40] you you'll
[24:41] find out oh lord my father my mother
[24:45] is not this one that one or the other
[24:47] one but i
[24:49] recognize lord jesus you are my real
[24:52] spiritual father

[24:57] from my past i turn away from the
[25:01] mistakes that i have done lord

[25:08] dead pass bury its dead god with
[25:11] heart within and god overhead forgetting
[25:15] the kings which are behind
[25:17] i now press to the mark which is in
[25:19] christ jesus
[25:21] my lord and my savior to whom i commit
[25:25] my life now seriously sincerely
[25:29] oh god reverently i repent
[25:33] i ask for your forgiveness and i ask for
[25:37] the
[25:37] cleansing of the blood of jesus christ
[25:41] to flow through my veins all
[25:44] the blood from emmanuel's veins
[25:48] may the blood from his body flow
[25:51] through my body and made the blood from
[25:54] him

[26:02] in my life and make me a true
[26:05] uh uh a new creature a new
[26:09] person in jesus christ
[26:12] to have a new beginning

[26:28] hallelujah forevermore all glory to his
[26:33] marvelous and wonderful
[26:36] name amen
[26:39] praise god with the cleansing of this
[26:42] blood
[26:44] all the bad blood all the mad blood all
[26:47] the
[26:48] evil wants to pass out from you
[26:52] and you go back without
[26:56] this desire to go around
[26:59] sinning around
[27:02] and now you possess a hatred for
[27:06] the works of the flesh
[27:09] and the lusting of the flesh and desires
[27:13] of the world
[27:16] you're still in the flesh body and the
[27:19] devil will tempt
[27:20] you but you have no desire
[27:23] to respond to his evil tests
[27:26] trials temptations tribulations
[27:30] whatever he may bring your way you
[27:34] trust that the blood of jesus christ
[27:37] cleanses you from all sins and
[27:40] make you a child of god what is our life
[27:44] it's like a vapor like a smoke
[27:48] what is your natural life where did it
[27:50] come from
[27:52] your natural life was passed down
[27:57] by your daddy your father for the life
[28:01] is in the blood and the blood comes from
[28:04] the male
[28:06] the female provides the egg
[28:10] and together with that uniting time
[28:14] the blood cell and the egg
[28:18] produces that child who comes forth
[28:24] and that is why the blood from the male
[28:28] egg from the female praise god
[28:33] that is why the woman takes on
[28:37] the man's name and the children
[28:41] that are born for him
[28:45] by her take on
[28:48] not the woman's name but the man's
[28:52] name hallelujah he has a
[28:55] place that he put his name
[28:59] and he put it on his children
[29:02] he put it on his wife it's like a claim
[29:07] i claim this woman
[29:10] as my own i claim these children
[29:14] as my own i am now responsible for her
[29:19] i'm now responsible for them i now
[29:21] protect her
[29:23] uh i now protect these children i now
[29:26] provide for her
[29:28] i now provide for these children for i
[29:31] am their father all glory
[29:35] be to god hallelujah or friends
[29:38] that is what happened at redemption
[29:43] remember the bible tells us
[29:47] that the holy ghost came upon mary
[29:52] overshadowed her
[29:55] and she bore a son
[29:58] and they called his name that's the
[30:00] earthly name of
[30:02] god is jesus christ amen
[30:06] let me repeat god's earthly
[30:09] name is jesus christ
[30:12] all the others before were only titles
[30:16] father is a title son is a title holy
[30:19] ghost is a title
[30:21] jehovah a title these were all
[30:24] titles but now
[30:28] this name is jesus
[30:31] just like you and i were born and then
[30:33] when you were born
[30:34] you were given a name
[30:38] here on the earth that they call you by
[30:43] and so god being the eternal spirit
[30:46] elohim when he came to the
[30:50] earth in a flesh body they had to give
[30:53] it a name
[30:55] and the name it was given was jehovah
[30:59] our savior and that is what jesus means
[31:03] jehovah has become
[31:06] our savior and so
[31:10] we see that the blood cell
[31:14] came to mary through the spoken word of
[31:16] the angel gabriel
[31:18] thou shalt bear a son
[31:22] and his name shall be called jesus
[31:26] and he will be the savior he will save
[31:30] your people from their sins hallelujah
[31:34] praise god and so friends
[31:38] down from his glory to become
[31:42] our savior our god and
[31:45] savior came and jesus was his name
[31:50] and he came from galilee
[31:56] to gethsemane
[32:00] golgotha to become
[32:04] our sacrifice
[32:07] the hebrew word will be our goel
[32:11] he came to be our kinsmen redeemer
[32:16] to take our place as the old song says
[32:20] he
[32:20] took my place at calvary
[32:24] oh glory to god hallelujah
[32:27] and that is what he did
[32:30] shed his blood and
[32:33] gave up the ghost now as you know
[32:38] when i was in pentecost many other
[32:41] people are still
[32:42] caught in those various uh traps or
[32:45] those various denominational names
[32:49] i was taught to believe
[32:53] that the blood of jesus was just the
[32:56] red chemical
[32:59] that we could imagine and believe flowed
[33:02] out of his body
[33:04] but they forgot one thing
[33:08] the bible already told us
[33:11] the life is in the blood
[33:16] the life is in the blood
[33:20] so when jesus died and the blood flowed
[33:24] out
[33:26] it wasn't so much the red corpuscles
[33:30] of the chemicals but that life
[33:33] he gave up the ghost went back to heaven
[33:37] and under their pentecost the bible says
[33:39] he came
[33:40] back down upon the believers in the form
[33:43] of the holy
[33:44] spirit the holy ghost that came out of
[33:48] him
[33:49] came back down for their life
[33:53] was released from in that blood
[33:56] and came to us hallelujah
[33:59] and that same spirit of life to dwell
[34:04] within our hearts within our lives
[34:08] and to set us free amen and so we don't
[34:12] have to come back year after year
[34:15] amen like jesus told peter
[34:18] uh you don't need to be for me to wash
[34:21] you again
[34:23] right it's just your hands and your feet
[34:27] that's why you need to have the washing
[34:32] of the saints feet which is to say your
[34:36] daily walk
[34:38] you can repent of that every night every
[34:41] day ask god to cleanse that part of you
[34:43] but as far as your soul is concerned
[34:46] once you're truly genuinely washed
[34:48] you're washed forever and cleansed by
[34:51] the blood of jesus christ
[34:53] and by one sacrifice he has set us all
[34:57] free if we are willing
[34:59] to accept the change and
[35:03] allow him to turn our lives around
[35:07] repent to turn back turn around
[35:11] go in the opposite direction from which
[35:13] you might be living now
[35:16] and let god have his way and have the
[35:19] victory of dominion over sin
[35:23] by receiving the life of christ in you
[35:26] and then he reigns as lord of
[35:30] lords having victory over
[35:33] the world of flesh and the devil
[35:38] god promised by the great prophet isaiah
[35:42] i'll give you a sign and the great sign
[35:45] that i will give you is that a virgin
[35:47] will conceive and bear a son
[35:50] that will be your saying oh praise
[35:54] god that will be an everlasting sign and
[35:57] his
[35:57] he shall be called emmanuel which is
[36:00] meaning what
[36:01] god with us glory to god hallelujah
[36:05] and thank god he has come down
[36:08] amen once more to dwell not in jesus
[36:12] back there but in you and me here today
[36:15] praise god and making you
[36:20] another manifestation
[36:23] of emmanuel god
[36:27] walking up and down amongst the people
[36:29] in you and me
[36:30] the unrecognized presence of the living
[36:35] god
[36:35] living and moving in the life of the
[36:38] true believer
[36:39] walking here upon the earth oh glory to
[36:41] his wonderful name
[36:43] amen thank god the blood cell
[36:47] for mary came to her not
[36:51] by her going with a man
[36:54] but the blood cell came to her through
[36:57] the spoken word of god
[37:00] and that brought life amen
[37:03] to fulfill genesis chapter 3 verse 15
[37:07] how that you will bruise the serpent's
[37:10] head
[37:11] amen and he will bruise his heel
[37:15] praise god and there in
[37:18] the body of mary in the church
[37:22] in the body of mary was created
[37:25] a body for god to dwell in type of the
[37:28] true
[37:29] believer of course amen praise
[37:32] god and so we know how he was born
[37:36] how he grew and how he was sacrificed he
[37:39] was
[37:40] washed by john the baptist as a
[37:42] sacrifice and the holy spirit came upon
[37:45] him
[37:46] like a dove amen praise
[37:49] god hallelujah oh this
[37:52] is my beloved son hallelujah
[37:56] in whom i am pleased to dwell
[38:00] in that's the life that came back upon
[38:03] the sinner
[38:04] and that is why when that life is in you
[38:09] he says because i live you
[38:12] shall live also amen
[38:15] thank god born again free from sin
[38:20] i'm happy night and day
[38:23] oh hallelujah aren't you happy today
[38:26] or if you're not fully happy if you're
[38:29] not
[38:30] certain then while i'm yet speaking
[38:34] or after i'm finished may that brother
[38:38] that
[38:38] minister that person lead you to christ
[38:42] where you can repent of all your past

[39:04] us
[39:04] all over again that he might live in us
[39:09] that we might not produce an imitation
[39:13] of christ
[39:14] but we will produce the reality of the
[39:18] very life of christ living in
[39:21] us and through us for his glory
[39:25] for real christianity is not you trying
[39:28] to be like jesus
[39:31] but real christianity is
[39:35] the real christ living in you
[39:39] and living out his own life and you
[39:42] cease from your own works your own
[39:45] trying
[39:46] your own striving and allow
[39:49] him to live through you christ in you
[39:53] your hope of glory blessed be the name
[39:56] of the lord

[40:39] hearts
[40:40] of the true believer think of it

[40:51] form of a baby crying in a manger
[40:55] the form of his holy spirit crying in me
[40:59] and you
[41:00] crying out the gospel sound of the word
[41:04] of god
[41:05] and to them it seems foolishness
[41:10] the doors that know not the wisdom of
[41:13] god
[41:14] it seems rough crude and foolish
[41:17] not systematic intellectual uh
[41:20] presentational and all that sort of
[41:22] thing which that is good
[41:24] but to hear the voice of god speaking
