[31:27] praying and I know that the spirit of
[31:29] God is here in our midst. Amen.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am excited this morning
[31:36] because, you know, it's one of those
[31:38] messages where God changed it again.
[31:41] Amen. And uh he always, you know, when
[31:45] he does that, it's always something
[31:46] special for somebody. I hope more than
[31:50] some one person. Amen. That's what a a
[31:53] minister always hopes that it's more
[31:54] than one person. Hallelujah. But if
[31:58] we're walking with him, you you you just
[32:01] can't come into a a building, a church,
[32:04] and you know, we got to walk with him
[32:07] every day.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's every day. It's a life.
[32:12] Amen. That he wants. And that's what the

[32:40] I'm ministering the word of God. Amen.
[32:42] Because I know there's faith.
[32:43] Hallelujah. And that's what we want. We
[32:45] want faith this morning.

[32:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that we can not only get
[32:51] the minister out of the way, but get you
[32:53] out of the way so the Holy Spirit can
[32:54] speak to you. Our pastor Danny, sister
[32:56] Jennifer, we were with them this week.
[32:58] They send their greeting and their love
[33:00] and they'll be back next week. Amen.
[33:02] Continue to remember brother Chris and
[33:05] sister Freda. They're heading out for a
[33:06] few months to do what God wants them to
[33:09] do in Trinidad. So, let us continue to
[33:12] remember. Let us pray one for another.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible has uh commanded us. And
[33:20] I believe the spirit of God moves us to
[33:23] pray one for another, even more as you
[33:26] see that day approaching. Hallelujah.
[33:28] The day is getting more evil and evil.
[33:30] Let's pray for one another. Amen.
[33:33] Hallelujah. God bless you. Let us turn
[33:35] to the word.
[33:37] Amen. I want to title this this morning.
[33:41] Hallelujah. The seventh seal revealed
[33:45] sets us free indeed. Hallelujah. Free
[33:49] has been on my mind and free has been in
[33:52] my fellowships with the brethren and and
[33:54] and and and just being set free.
[33:57] Hallelujah. I don't know which way it's
[33:59] going to go this morning. Hallelujah.
[34:02] But we trust the Holy Spirit. He knows.
[34:05] Hallelujah. So, let us turn to the
[34:07] scriptures. Romans 6:4. Let us have a
[34:11] good time in the Lord.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Set me at liberty up here.
[34:17] Amen.
[34:18] Set me at liberty.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:22] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[34:25] Romans 6:4.
[34:27] Therefore, we are buried with him by
[34:30] baptism into death,
[34:34] that like as Christ was raised up from
[34:37] the dead by the glory of the Father,
[34:40] even so we also should walk in newness
[34:44] of life.
[34:46] For if we have been planted together in
[34:49] the likeness of his death,
[34:53] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[34:55] resurrection.
[34:57] Amen.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Knowing this, that our old man is
[35:02] crucified this morning
[35:05] &gt;&gt; with him, that the body of sin
[35:09] might be destroyed,
[35:12] that henceforth we should not serve sin.
[35:19] For he that is dead is freed from sin.
[35:24] Now if we be dead with Christ, we
[35:27] believe that we shall also live with
[35:30] him.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; That's now. Hallelujah.
[35:35] Knowing that Christ being raised from
[35:37] the dead dieth no more. Hallelujah. He's
[35:42] alive and well.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Death had no dominion over him.
[35:48] For in that he died, he died unto sin
[35:52] once. is paid already, my brothers and
[35:56] sisters.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:58] It's It's about coming to recognize that
[36:01] we are free.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Sin is paid for.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; When the sons and daughters of God are
[36:09] set at that liberty by faith.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. The word of God is
[36:15] bringing her to that. Amen. But in that
[36:19] he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise
[36:22] reckon ye yourself
[36:26] to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive
[36:29] unto God,
[36:31] &gt;&gt; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not
[36:34] sin therefore reign in your mortal
[36:37] bodies.
[36:38] That ye should obey it in the lust.
[36:42] Hallelujah. Don't let it rain. You got
[36:45] the power. You got the birth. You got
[36:47] the Holy Ghost. You got everything that
[36:50] God has given you. Amen. To not let it
[36:53] rain.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:57] Therefore, neither yield your members as
[37:01] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,
[37:04] but yield yourself unto God, as those
[37:07] that are alive from the dead. Oh, I know
[37:10] I'm alive from the dead. Amen. I know I
[37:13] was dead. That's all I know. I know I
[37:16] was dead in sin. Amen. But I know I'm
[37:19] alive this morning.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; I'm alive in him. Amen.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Thank you, Lord. Amen. I'm just
[37:28] going to have a good time. Amen. And
[37:30] your members as instruments of
[37:32] righteousness unto God. For sin shall
[37:35] not have dominion over you. I'm
[37:38] declaring that this morning. Sin shall
[37:41] not have dominion over you. For ye are
[37:45] not under the law, but under grace.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; What then? Shall we sin? Because we are
[37:51] not under the law, but under grace. God
[37:53] forbid. Know ye not that to whom you
[37:56] yield your servants, yourselves servants
[37:59] to obey, his servants, ye are to whom
[38:02] you obey, whether sin unto death or
[38:06] obedience unto righteousness.
[38:09] Hallelujah. Let us turn to John 8:31. I
[38:12] know these are long scriptures, but
[38:14] there's so much in here. Hallelujah. The
[38:16] word says it better than any man could
[38:18] ever say it. Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:22] Amen. John 8:31.
[38:26] Oh, glory to God. Then said Jesus to
[38:30] those Jews which believed on him, if you
[38:33] continue in my word, then you are my
[38:36] disciples indeed, and you shall know the
[38:39] truth, and the truth shall make you
[38:42] free." They answered him, "We be
[38:46] Abraham's seed,
[38:48] and we are never in bondage to any man.
[38:53] How sayest thou, ye shall be made free?
[38:58] Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say
[39:00] unto you, whosoever committh sin is the
[39:04] servant of sin." They didn't understand.
[39:08] We're going to get into it, but they
[39:09] didn't understand
[39:11] what sin was. And the servant abideth
[39:15] not in the house forever, but the son
[39:17] abideth forever. If the Son therefore
[39:20] shall make you free, you shall be free
[39:24] indeed
[39:25] &gt;&gt; in all things. Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know that ye are Abraham's
[39:31] seed, but you seek to kill me. What? The
[39:34] revealed word.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; They seek to kill the revealed word, and
[39:40] they still do it that same spirit today.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because my word had no place
[39:47] in you. I speak that which I have seen
[39:51] of my father and ye do that which you
[39:53] have seen of your father. They answered
[39:56] and said unto him, Abraham is our
[39:59] father. Oh,
[40:02] listen closely. Put on your spiritual
[40:05] thinking caps. Amen. I love it when
[40:08] somebody comes to me afterwards said,
[40:09] "Brother, when you made that statement,
[40:11] this this open up that open up that open
[40:13] up. That shows that you're in the
[40:15] spirit. Hallelujah. Oh God. Jesus said
[40:19] unto them, "If you were Abraham's
[40:21] children, you would do the works of
[40:24] Abraham. But now you seek to kill me, a
[40:28] man that had told you the truth which I
[40:32] heard of God. This did not Abraham. Yay,
[40:36] do the deeds of your father." Then said
[40:39] they to him, "We be not born of
[40:42] fornication.
[40:44] We have one father, even God."
[40:48] Oh my. Jesus said unto them, "If God
[40:52] were your father, ye would love me. For
[40:55] I proceed forth and came from God.
[40:59] Neither came I of myself, but he but he
[41:04] sent me."
[41:06] Oh my,
[41:07] so much in there. Let us pray. Father,
[41:11] we thank you, Lord,
[41:14] that we can stand here this morning,
[41:16] Father,
[41:19] washed in the precious blood.
[41:22] Lord, we are on a journey, Father.
[41:26] A journey of perfect faith. A journey
[41:28] that you started,
[41:31] the plan of redemption coming to an end,
[41:34] Lord. And here we are this morning,
[41:37] Father,
[41:38] Lord, asking
[41:41] for you to come and speak to your
[41:44] children,
[41:45] and do what you need to do, Father. For
[41:47] you said, "My word has gone forth not
[41:50] only this morning, but it has gone forth
[41:52] through a prophet, and it will
[41:54] accomplish what it's set forth to do. It
[41:57] will not return to you void, Father. And
[42:00] you have spoken a bride without spot or
[42:03] wrinkle. You spoken a bride with perfect
[42:07] faith, total deliverance.
[42:10] Lord, you spoken free indeed. Father, we
[42:15] are free this morning, Lord.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let us see the light.
[42:21] Let us see the light, Lord, that we may
[42:24] recognize our freedom this morning. Even
[42:26] if it's just one area of bondage, Lord,
[42:30] &gt;&gt; one area where we're we're we're chained
[42:32] up. Father,
[42:34] &gt;&gt; open those prison doors this morning.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Your prophet cried out to a brother and
[42:39] said, "Brother,
[42:41] God is setting his people free.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; He's opening the prison doors and he's
[42:46] setting the captives free. You're the
[42:48] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[42:50] Lord, come Holy Spirit and set your
[42:54] people free. Father.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, grant it, Lord.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; We lift you up on high, Father.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Bless each one, heal each one, deliver
[43:04] each one. May we enter into that tent,
[43:07] Lord, which I believe we are in that
[43:09] tent now. And Lord, may we believe when
[43:13] we walk out of these doors, something
[43:16] has changed.
[43:18] Amen. God bless you, saints, as you're
[43:20] seated.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:25] What is sin in the visible union of the
[43:28] bride of Christ? I'm going to read a few
[43:29] quotes here. What is sin?
[43:33] Sin is unbelief.
[43:35] Amen. That changes everything. That
[43:39] changes the perspective of our minds in
[43:42] this hour. Hallelujah. When we interpret
[43:46] the word of God, when we look into the
[43:48] word and read the word. Amen.
[43:52] So many people say and so many times the
[43:55] devil condemns people on their on their
[43:57] actions or or on their behaviors.
[44:01] Smoking, drinking, lying, all these
[44:04] things. Amen. But that's not sin, my
[44:07] brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. We got
[44:10] to come a little bit higher and see what
[44:12] sin really is.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Sin is unbelief in what? The word of
[44:17] God.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is greater than
[44:21] anything. You can hide behind religion.
[44:23] You can you religion is a a covering.
[44:26] You can hide behind the message. You can
[44:28] be hide behind all your quotes that you
[44:31] quote in your scriptures. Amen. But sin
[44:34] is unbelief in the revealed word of this
[44:37] hour.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Disbelieving what God has spoken about
[44:43] you. Amen.
[44:46] Disbelieving that God has promised
[44:48] things in this hour. You know, let me
[44:50] say it, my brothers and sisters, not
[44:52] outwardly because nobody would say it
[44:54] outwardly. Amen. But God exposes
[44:58] everything. There are people today and
[45:01] the scripture says, "Where is his
[45:03] coming? Why is he delaying his coming?"
[45:06] Hallelujah. There are people, amen, that
[45:09] are disbelieving in the rapture today.
[45:13] Disbelieving that God is able to change
[45:17] these bodies. Amen. Hallelujah. If
[45:20] that's what sin and unbelief is. Amen.
[45:24] You got to get to a place with him by
[45:28] revelation that you recognize the
[45:31] difference between your flesh
[45:34] &gt;&gt; and your soul. If you do not get there,
[45:38] amen, this flesh will have you in
[45:41] unbelief. Amen. Hallelujah. That seed of
[45:44] God inside of you has got to be
[45:47] awakened. And when it's awakened, that's
[45:50] what we call the new birth. Hallelujah.
[45:54] That's your life. That's your salvation.
[45:58] That's what saves you is the new birth.
[46:01] Amen. Not because you came to an altar.
[46:04] Not because you confessed something with
[46:06] your mouth or testified. Amen. Not
[46:09] because signs and wonders worked through
[46:11] your life. Amen. You can have all those
[46:13] things. Brother Brandham says you can be
[46:15] anointed with the baptism of the Holy
[46:17] Ghost every day of your life and still
[46:19] go to hell.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; It's the word that brings forth the life
[46:25] inside of us, the new birth.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:29] Amen.
[46:32] The word unbelief in God which is the
[46:35] word. Brother Brand is speaking here 10
[46:39] virgins
[46:40] and 144,000 Jews. See the trumpet
[46:44] sounded
[46:46] and he can go free.
[46:48] It's God's grace.
[46:51] It's the year of Jubilee
[46:53] that completion.
[46:55] Hallelujah. The day now listen. The day
[47:00] of sin is over, brother.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. It's over.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:09] Oh, God. What's going to bring this
[47:11] rapture on? What's going to bring this
[47:13] perfect faith on? Oh my. Glory to God. I
[47:18] tell every one of you serving sin on the
[47:20] tapes or visible audience, everyone that
[47:24] is serving sin, the day of sin is over.
[47:28] Jesus died. You don't have to serve sin
[47:31] anymore. Hallelujah. What is sin? Amen.
[47:36] You don't have to bow down to the creeds
[47:40] or denominations or the dogmas or the
[47:44] traditions. You don't have to bow down
[47:46] in fact to anything anymore that this
[47:49] world that this flesh has to offer you.
[47:53] Amen. Hallelujah.
[47:56] He who the son of man has made free is
[48:01] free indeed. If you want to go free and
[48:05] be free in the sun, cut loose from all
[48:09] things and serve him.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:15] It's called surrender. It's called
[48:18] cutting loose. Amen. You know, the Holy
[48:21] Spirit, the preacher can preach words,
[48:23] but the Holy Spirit speaks to his sons
[48:26] and daughters. Hallelujah. He speaks all
[48:29] this that still small voice into your
[48:31] heart. Amen. And I'm telling you, each
[48:34] and every one of us that are walking
[48:35] with him, you hear that voice saying,
[48:38] "Cut loose." Hallelujah. He's revealing
[48:42] things to you. How can I overcome? How
[48:44] can you overcome? Amen. By the one who's
[48:47] already overcome. Amen. He's the one
[48:49] inside of me. He's the one inside of you
[48:51] that is overcoming this morning.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's setting you free this
[48:55] morning. Amen. When he reveals his word
[48:58] to you, when he speaks into your heart,
[49:01] amen, when he shows you things to come
[49:04] into your life and he exposes sin, he
[49:08] exposes darkness. Like, like David said,
[49:11] Lord, if there be any evil inside of me,
[49:14] take it out of me. God will expose
[49:16] everything in our lives. What? To set
[49:19] you free. Amen. And sometimes we stay
[49:23] right in our sin. Sometimes we stay
[49:26] right in our unbelief because it is
[49:27] unbelief. Because when the word of God
[49:30] reveals to you, Amen. And you don't step
[49:32] out by faith and obey and believe that
[49:36] word of God, it becomes sin to you.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; And sin has a penalty, a punishment
[49:42] behind it. Now, if you're a son and
[49:44] daughter of God, hallelujah, you're
[49:46] going to learn a lesson. And you're
[49:48] going to learn it real good. But you're
[49:50] going to learn it. Amen.
[49:54] Hallelujah. Because the seed inside of
[49:56] you cannot sin.
[49:59] But if you don't want to,
[50:02] then your organization, your master,
[50:05] what is your organization?
[50:09] See, we we read this and we think is
[50:12] that
[50:14] is is the churches out there
[50:17] is your master. Whoever you serving will
[50:22] put a mark on your ear and you won't be
[50:25] able to hear it anymore. If God ever
[50:28] speaks to your heart, come.
[50:33] Let me repeat that. If God ever speaks
[50:35] to your heart, come.
[50:39] This is the time.
[50:42] And for you to refuse it, then you
[50:45] receive his mark hardening from the
[50:49] truth, the revealed truth, the present
[50:52] truth of this hour. You know, you look
[50:55] at that and you you think of them out
[50:56] there not receiving the message, my
[50:58] brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. But
[51:00] there's a revealed word in the message.
[51:03] There's there's a written word in the
[51:04] message. There's an unwritten word in
[51:06] the message. Amen. Hallelujah. And God
[51:08] is speaking to the people in the
[51:10] message. Amen. Hallelujah. And revealing
[51:13] truth to them. This very scripture is
[51:16] taking place right today in the message.
[51:21] Remember, it has to be that way in order
[51:23] for the scriptures to be fulfilled.
[51:25] Amen. It has to come to pass, my
[51:28] brothers and sisters. It came to pass,
[51:30] like I always said, in Jesus's life. It
[51:32] came to pass in brother Brandham's life.
[51:34] It has to come to pass in the bride.
[51:38] Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:42] What does the mark of the beast do? Puts
[51:44] you right back into Romanism,
[51:46] denominationalism
[51:48] in your mind. And you'll never come to
[51:52] in and be free. You will serve that
[51:55] forever.
[51:56] That's the mark of the beast. That's
[51:58] hard, friends.
[52:00] That's cutting.
[52:02] But that's what I'm I'm not responsible
[52:05] for just what the Bible says, what the
[52:09] truth says. Amen. Hallelujah.
[52:12] You see, my brothers and sisters, when
[52:14] the Pharisees responded to Jesus and
[52:18] said, "We're not in bondage.
[52:22] We are Abraham's seed."
[52:24] They didn't understand that Jesus came
[52:28] to set them free from unbelief,
[52:32] sin. They were bound by the law,
[52:36] by the flesh, by the carnal nature which
[52:39] is at emity against God. The flesh and
[52:44] the carnal mind is an enemy of the
[52:46] spirit of God. Jesus come by the new
[52:49] birth through the cross to set us free
[52:52] from that unbelief. You see, they didn't
[52:54] understand. They were looking back at
[52:57] the law of who? Moses. Moses is who? the
[53:02] prophet
[53:04] following that law, creating traditions,
[53:07] creating their own interpretations
[53:10] of what? That law, what? Moses's
[53:13] message.
[53:14] And here come Jesus. Amen. Saying,
[53:18] hallelujah, you need to be set free from
[53:21] your sin. And here they are saying,
[53:23] we're not in bondage.
[53:25] We're Abraham's seed
[53:28] because the law says so. We follow the
[53:31] prophet Moses.
[53:34] We believe the message. We say what he
[53:36] says.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; That's repeating the law.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; That's what they were doing. They were
[53:43] saying what the prophet said, saying
[53:46] what the tapes say
[53:50] and believing that they were in sin,
[53:55] not recognizing that same blindness is
[53:58] here today, my brothers and sisters.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; And God wants to deliver his true
[54:03] children.
[54:05] Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; This word got to be preached in such a
[54:08] way that you can see the false anointed,
[54:11] the false ones at the end time
[54:14] &gt;&gt; so you can receive the true word of God.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:20] Amen.
[54:22] Oh my brothers,
[54:25] sisters,
[54:28] this stirs on my heart because this is
[54:31] what I see. This is what God's opened my
[54:34] eyes to see.
[54:36] Hallelujah.
[54:37] This is the greatest gospel, the
[54:39] greatest message, the greatest freedom
[54:41] that you could ever have. Hallelujah.
[54:44] Amen.
[54:46] The greatest unbelief.
[54:49] Hallelujah. Our flesh, this carnal mind.
[54:52] And the because the Pharisees did not
[54:54] see that they they all can see was the
[54:59] law. All they can see was the law. That
[55:01] they were obeying the law. They could
[55:04] not be set free and born again.
[55:09] You know, that's the way it is today.
[55:12] The devil has deceived and lied to
[55:15] people in this message
[55:18] because you believe God sent a prophet
[55:20] because your intellectual education
[55:23] could understand the Bible or understand
[55:25] the prophet. Amen.
[55:28] Hallelujah. The devil works in all
[55:29] different kind of ways of deception and
[55:32] tells people when they're truly born
[55:34] again that you're not born again. And
[55:36] tell people that are not born again that
[55:37] you're born again.
[55:40] Oh yes.
[55:42] Hallelujah.
[55:45] Oh yes. By experience. I've got
[55:48] experiences with the Lord. You can have
[55:51] experience after experience. Amen. You
[55:54] can have the gifts manifested in your
[55:56] life and operating in your life. You can
[55:58] have all these things and still not be
[56:01] born again.
[56:05] Brother Van preached the message. Be
[56:07] certain of God. Hallelujah. I'm not here
[56:11] to tickle your ears. I'm not here to pat
[56:14] you on the back and say that you got the
[56:17] Holy Ghost and that you're born again.
[56:19] I'm here to tell you the truth. It's for
[56:21] you and God to know for yourself. Amen.
[56:24] for you to be certain of God and who you
[56:27] are that you're born again
[56:30] &gt;&gt; because this is a leosian church age.
[56:33] It's lukewarm. It's lazy. Amen. Satan is
[56:36] cooling down the church in the messages
[56:39] today. Cooling down the people from
[56:42] driving, from being persevering, from
[56:44] being desperate. Amen.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; This is a desperate time. This is
[56:50] between life and death. My brothers and
[56:52] sisters, oh, I love to preach a a good
[56:55] uplifting message to you all. Oh, to
[56:57] encourage you and strengthen you and pat
[56:59] you on the back. Hallelujah. But life
[57:03] and death stands before us.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And I can't stand before God. Amen. And
[57:09] stand here if I don't preach the truth
[57:11] &gt;&gt; that this is taking place. If he's
[57:14] opened my eyes, he opened a minister of
[57:16] the eyes. I'm not going to stand there.
[57:18] Amen. Hallelujah. and say, "You're okay.
[57:21] I'm going to preach against sin." Amen.
[57:23] If I'm the last one standing, which I
[57:25] don't believe I will be, I'll preach
[57:27] against sin.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; He has set us free.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; He has set us free.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Who the son of man has set free
[57:39] is free indeed.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:43] Amen. Those who see, those who
[57:46] understand this morning, those who
[57:48] recognize, oh God, will rejoice,
[57:52] &gt;&gt; will rejoice.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Because there's something inside of
[57:58] them. They know they've been set free.
[58:00] Hallelujah. They know they're forgiven.
[58:03] They know they're washed and cleansed.
[58:05] They know God, the attribute of God
[58:07] lives inside of them.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; What's going to move this church in the
[58:15] power of the resurrection? Amen. In the
[58:18] quickening power, what's going to take
[58:20] the dynamics? Amen. Hallelujah. The
[58:22] mechanics and put the dynamics on it,
[58:24] man. Hallelujah.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, when she recognizes,
[58:29] when she recognizes who she is,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; she recognizes who he is and what he's
[58:34] done. Amen. That's what he's done. Amen.
[58:38] He has risen me from the dead. He has
[58:40] risen you from the dead.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're born again.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; You got the resurrected power of God
[58:47] inside of you.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth has come.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; It's him that's been guiding you. It's
[58:55] him that's been speaking to you. It's
[58:57] him inside of you.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; When that consciousness becomes a
[59:03] reality in your life, amen. and it
[59:07] possesses you. It It takes over your
[59:09] life. Hallelujah. Then you become
[59:12] anointed one. Hallelujah. Amen. Not a
[59:16] false anointed, but the anointed of God
[59:19] in these last days.
[59:21] Oh my.
[59:24] Amen. today because believers are blind
[59:27] to the fact that they need to be set
[59:29] free from this carnal nature and the
[59:32] flesh because they follow the letter of
[59:35] the message of the Bible and may even
[59:38] have a lot of experiences and the devil
[59:41] can produce every experience that the
[59:44] spirit of God can give you but he cannot
[59:47] produce the new birth. He can he can
[59:50] impersonate everything. Amen.
[59:53] everything, my brothers and sisters.
[59:55] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham has seen
[59:56] that woman walking. Amen. Justified,
[1:00:00] sanctified,
[1:00:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost, the gifts
[1:00:04] manifested through her life, seeing her
[1:00:06] walking right down the line, and then
[1:00:08] boom, fell right into the pits of hell.
[1:00:11] Hallelujah. Why? Because she rejected
[1:00:14] the word for her day.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. She rejected it in her life. Where
[1:00:19] do you reject it? You might say,
[1:00:20] "Brother, I believe it." Oh, I believe
[1:00:23] it. I believe God sent a prophet. I
[1:00:26] believe what you're saying. Amen.
[1:00:29] Hallelujah. Then go out. Brother Brandon
[1:00:31] said, "It's not good enough just to
[1:00:33] agree with the message. It's not just
[1:00:35] good enough to fellowship around the
[1:00:36] message." Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; But become the message.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; There's a different story when you
[1:00:42] become the message. When you have to die
[1:00:45] to yourself,
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; you have to surrender your life to Jesus
[1:00:48] Christ.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; But not in part. You got to open every
[1:00:52] door of your heart. You got to open your
[1:00:54] spirit. You got to open your mind.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; You got to open yourself to the word
[1:00:58] that the word can come in and do the
[1:01:01] work that it needs to do.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; It needs to cast out devils.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. I say that cuz I know God has
[1:01:09] cast out devils out of me. And I'm
[1:01:12] telling you this morning, God needs to
[1:01:14] cast out devils. He needs to cast out
[1:01:17] unbelief. He needs to cast out
[1:01:19] traditions. He needs to cast out your
[1:01:21] culture, your way you think, the way you
[1:01:24] do things, the way you act. He wants to
[1:01:26] change you completely.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] Hallelujah.
[1:01:33] Sometimes he's got to shake you to the
[1:01:35] core.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, he got to shake you to the core.
[1:01:39] Amen. If you walk out here wondering if
[1:01:41] you're born again or not, that's good.
[1:01:44] That's good. Hallelujah. Because that's
[1:01:47] going to get you on your knees. that's
[1:01:49] going to say, "Lord God, Lord, take my
[1:01:52] life." Amen. What is this message? What
[1:01:57] is this word of God? What are we doing?
[1:02:00] What is this this morning? Why are we
[1:02:03] here? Are we coming because of a
[1:02:06] building that that is a tradition of
[1:02:08] church? We're coming to hear the word of
[1:02:11] God. Amen. To make you feel religious
[1:02:13] and good and walk out of these doors.
[1:02:15] Why are we here? We're here to put on
[1:02:18] Christ.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; We're here for this word that's been
[1:02:21] spoken in these last days to become a
[1:02:23] manifestation in our lives.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; We're here to die. We're here to get
[1:02:28] judged.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. He's my judge this morning.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to be judged there
[1:02:34] because he's my judge here.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; He's judging me right now.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Judge me, Lord.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Search me, Lord.
[1:02:45] See if there be anything in me. Take it
[1:02:47] out of me.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; I want to be free, Father.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; I'm in your presence. I want to be free.
[1:02:53] I don't want this morning to go by, oh
[1:02:56] God, without you touching me and setting
[1:02:59] me free.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; I know I'm not walking the way I should
[1:03:05] be walking. I know there's boundaries
[1:03:08] over my head. I know there's something
[1:03:10] holding me back. Hallelujah. I know
[1:03:13] something is binding me. Don't stay in
[1:03:15] that condition. Cry out to God. The word
[1:03:19] is here to set you free.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; in your doubt. Just believe in who you
[1:03:25] are. Satan has told you for many years
[1:03:29] that you're not a son and daughter of
[1:03:30] God. And today you're still believing
[1:03:33] that. You got to be set free from that.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; You got to be loose from that bondage,
[1:03:38] that demon.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; That's a devil.
[1:03:42] Any lie of the devil is from him. He's
[1:03:45] the father of lies.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:49] Hallelujah.
[1:03:51] Don't worry, my brothers and sisters. If
[1:03:53] you're conscious of what's being spoken,
[1:03:57] that's a good sign because the false
[1:04:00] anointed ones, the Pharisees and
[1:04:02] Sadducees of this message, they never
[1:04:04] recognize who they are. Jesus never knew
[1:04:07] uh Judas never knew who he was.
[1:04:09] Pharisees and Sadducees thought they
[1:04:11] were servants of Moses
[1:04:14] of the most high God. We are Abraham's
[1:04:16] seed.
[1:04:18] Even here was the living word telling
[1:04:20] them that they're in sin, that they need
[1:04:23] to repent, that they need to be born
[1:04:25] again. The living word, the living God
[1:04:28] that they're claiming to serve. Think
[1:04:29] about it. It blows my mind. Standing
[1:04:32] right in front of them and here they are
[1:04:34] standing like that because they couldn't
[1:04:36] recognize. They're blinded to it.
[1:04:38] Hallelujah.
[1:04:40] Amen.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; My my my.
[1:04:43] They're here today, my brothers and
[1:04:44] sisters. They're here today. Amen.
[1:04:48] They'll come and they'll preach. Maybe
[1:04:50] they'll preach over this pulpit. They're
[1:04:51] preaching all over a lot of different
[1:04:54] pulpit. Amen. But it's for you to
[1:04:56] recognize. Amen. Hallelujah. It's for
[1:04:59] you to recognize. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:05:04] Only Jesus Christ can do that.
[1:05:07] goes back to what Jesus said. Unless a
[1:05:09] man is born again, he cannot see or
[1:05:13] enter into the kingdom of God. My
[1:05:14] brothers and sisters, you know, I can't
[1:05:16] get away from this. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:05:20] sorry, but you know, if you don't start
[1:05:22] right, you don't end right. And that's a
[1:05:24] that's a problem with a lot of people.
[1:05:26] Amen. That come into the gospel. They
[1:05:29] don't start right. Hallelujah. So,
[1:05:31] they're never going to end right. And we
[1:05:33] have to start the way Jesus told us to
[1:05:35] start. Amen. It's it's a death, a
[1:05:38] burial, and a resurrection. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:40] You need to be born again. Hallelujah.
[1:05:43] You need to know that you're born again.
[1:05:46] How how you going to know? I I don't
[1:05:48] know. I can't explain that to you. But
[1:05:50] all I know is that, you know, God was
[1:05:53] moving in my life. God was dealing with
[1:05:56] my life. God called me supernaturally
[1:06:00] and and revealed this word. I was a
[1:06:02] Catholic. Amen. I'm just going to share
[1:06:04] this with you. I just feel led. I was a
[1:06:06] Catholic and and and and and I was about
[1:06:08] to commit suicide. I was in a bad
[1:06:11] condition, a mental condition. And and I
[1:06:13] went to the Catholic church and I told I
[1:06:15] said, "God, uh this is all I know who
[1:06:18] you are in the Catholic church. If you
[1:06:20] don't come and deliver me cuz I was in
[1:06:23] bondage like you wouldn't believe. You
[1:06:26] don't come and deliver me, I'm that's
[1:06:28] it. I'm finishing my life. I can't put
[1:06:30] up with this torment anymore." And I was
[1:06:33] in bad torment.
[1:06:35] And I I I went into the the the
[1:06:38] confession box and the priest I poured
[1:06:40] out my heart.
[1:06:42] I poured my heart to a man
[1:06:45] and he said, "Oh, go say some Hail Marys
[1:06:47] and some our fathers and all that
[1:06:49] stuff." And I I felt
[1:06:52] I'm just going to say it plain. I felt
[1:06:55] raped.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; I felt raped,
[1:07:00] defiled.
[1:07:02] I walked out of that because I knew I
[1:07:04] was going to end my life. Wasn't a joke.
[1:07:08] I walked out of there starting to cry. I
[1:07:10] went to the altar and I knelt down
[1:07:13] and I couldn't even say anything.
[1:07:18] And I heard a voice,
[1:07:21] you won't find me here.
[1:07:25] When that voice spoke to me, hallelujah.
[1:07:29] I got up.
[1:07:31] I walked out of those doors. I walked
[1:07:34] home crying and weeping on the streets.
[1:07:36] People looking at me say, "This is a
[1:07:38] crazy man. Call the cops." I'm crying
[1:07:42] and weeping on the streets. I'm saying,
[1:07:43] "Oh, God, if you're not there, where are
[1:07:46] you?
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Where are you?"
[1:07:53] And a couple weeks later, I'm sitting on
[1:07:55] the couch. I couldn't move. I was so
[1:07:57] depressed and so out of it.
[1:08:00] But that voice kept me from taking my
[1:08:02] life that day. And then my brother comes
[1:08:05] home. Amen. He got a job at Campbell
[1:08:08] Soup and he said, "All these brothers
[1:08:09] are talking about." He said, he had me a
[1:08:12] paper with the cloud and all that on.
[1:08:13] I'm going, "What is all this? I don't
[1:08:16] want this stuff. What is all this cloud
[1:08:19] stuff?" You know, my mind was all messed
[1:08:22] up.
[1:08:25] But then he said, you know, they were
[1:08:26] telling me about Acts 2:38 and you say
[1:08:30] that there's no power in Acts 2:38 and
[1:08:33] doing what God tell us to do. He says,
[1:08:36] you know, they're telling me in Acts
[1:08:38] 2:38 that you got to repent and be
[1:08:41] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:08:43] the remission of your sin. And my my
[1:08:46] brothers and sisters,
[1:08:49] I'm telling you,
[1:08:52] a light came on inside of me and I said,
[1:08:53] "What did you say?" My brother's like,
[1:08:56] "You know, those who know Paul, what do
[1:08:58] you mean? What do you mean?" I said,
[1:08:59] "What did you just say?" What? I don't
[1:09:02] know what I said. What did I say?
[1:09:05] So, what did you just say?
[1:09:08] Repent. Right there, I recognize, my
[1:09:11] brothers and sisters. For the first
[1:09:13] time, I recognized I was a sinner.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; I didn't know I was a sinner.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; I didn't know I was in sin.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; What blindness.
[1:09:23] And a light came on and I said, "Oh,
[1:09:24] God, give me those people. Get them down
[1:09:27] here." Amen. Brother Vishnu and brother
[1:09:30] Gee and all that came down and started
[1:09:32] talking. And I'm just sitting there and
[1:09:34] I'm listening. I don't understand a word
[1:09:36] they're saying. And I come to a
[1:09:38] Wednesday night service. Amen. And I
[1:09:41] walk in there and I'm I'm shaking.
[1:09:45] I'm telling you, demons were shaking me
[1:09:48] like you wouldn't believe. But something
[1:09:49] was pulling me. Even my brother, he
[1:09:51] started hearing the singing. He's going
[1:09:53] up the stairs. He stopped and I grabbed
[1:09:55] him. Something inside of me grabbed him
[1:09:56] and pushed him up the stairs. I said,
[1:09:58] "Get up there." Unconsciously, "Get up
[1:10:01] there. I don't know. I don't know what's
[1:10:03] going on."
[1:10:05] I said, "I'm already gone. I've already
[1:10:07] lost my mind anyways. Get up there.
[1:10:11] And I walk in there and I see these
[1:10:13] people. I
[1:10:16] don't know what I'm doing here. And I
[1:10:18] walk be past the kitchen there. The the
[1:10:20] the oven is open with the heat coming
[1:10:22] out. I see a little black man there
[1:10:25] writing some notes down. I'm looking
[1:10:26] over. I said, "Okay,
[1:10:30] I'm not going to lean. I didn't say it,
[1:10:31] but I'm not going to lean to my own
[1:10:32] understanding right now." I sat down,
[1:10:35] brother, and this man of God got up
[1:10:37] there. Amen. start preaching the word. I
[1:10:40] didn't understand word saying, but my
[1:10:41] head was blowing up was pounding a world
[1:10:44] when it was going around me and around
[1:10:46] me. Hallelujah. As he was preaching the
[1:10:49] word of God. Amen. And and then I seen a
[1:10:52] I seen a light start coming around my
[1:10:55] life. I seen that light that night and
[1:10:58] and and I I said to my brother, "We're
[1:11:00] going home." I said, "You see the
[1:11:01] light?" I said, "You see the light?" He
[1:11:03] goes, "What light?" I said, "Do you see
[1:11:05] the light?" "I see the light." Because
[1:11:07] you got to remember, I think I'm I'm
[1:11:09] still in I'm in that condition still. I
[1:11:11] think I'm going crazy now. I'm really
[1:11:13] lost it. I see a light.
[1:11:16] I see a light glowing around me. I'm
[1:11:19] driving in the car with him and I'm
[1:11:20] sitting in the pastor's seat because I
[1:11:22] couldn't drive at that time. I wasn't
[1:11:23] mentally stable to drive. And I and I I
[1:11:26] I I seen a light and it was I go, "Hey,
[1:11:30] I seen a light, man. It's it's on the
[1:11:32] buildings. It's following us."
[1:11:36] My brother's going, "Oh, God. What did I
[1:11:39] do tonight?
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; What did I do tonight?" I said, "No, no,
[1:11:44] no. It's following us. I'm like this.
[1:11:46] It's following us. Think what he's
[1:11:48] thinking." Amen. I get down. I get
[1:11:51] downstairs and I knock on my door. My
[1:11:54] wife's there. She lived with me for
[1:11:56] three and a half years. You want to ask
[1:11:57] her how I was like? This This This is
[1:12:00] Brother Tim that is raised from the
[1:12:02] dead. Go ask her what I was like before.
[1:12:05] Oh my I knock I knocked on that door.
[1:12:08] She opened the door and she stood back
[1:12:10] like this. Hey, she's right here. She
[1:12:13] goes, "What happened to you?" And I'm
[1:12:15] going, "Oh my god, here we go again."
[1:12:18] That's what I'm telling you the truth.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; And I said, "What do you mean what
[1:12:22] happened to me?" She goes, "There's a
[1:12:24] light around you."
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; And then when she said that, that
[1:12:28] presence of that light came upon me.
[1:12:33] and she knew from that day I was never
[1:12:35] the same man. I was a violent man. I I
[1:12:38] was a violent man.
[1:12:42] I can't tell you if you're born again,
[1:12:45] but I know God is real.
[1:12:48] When I was getting baptized, when I was
[1:12:51] getting baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:12:53] Christ, hallelujah, brother Simon is
[1:12:55] sitting there baptizing me, he put me
[1:12:57] down and when my my head cleared the
[1:13:00] water. Hallelujah. I didn't know the
[1:13:02] Bible. Hallelujah. I seen a coffin close
[1:13:06] and I went into like a trance and all I
[1:13:08] remember is
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:13] and I was floating like this. And all I
[1:13:16] remember is
[1:13:19] brother Simon picking me up out of the
[1:13:22] water and I'm going, "Oh, God.
[1:13:25] I I I I can't explain it. I can't
[1:13:29] explain it this morning." But I knew my
[1:13:31] life was never going to be the same. I
[1:13:34] knew something happened inside of me
[1:13:37] that I was never going to be the same.
[1:13:40] 33 years later. Oh, ups and downs and
[1:13:44] battles. Amen. But I'm pressing on the
[1:13:47] upward way by the grace of God.
[1:13:50] Hallelujah.
[1:13:52] I know he's real. Glory to God.
[1:13:56] Hallelujah.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:59] Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; That's all I know.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can't explain it, but I
[1:14:06] experience the living God.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He started the work inside of me.
[1:14:13] Amen. He's going to finish it.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; No matter what the devil tries to do.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is going to finish it.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm going up.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going up.
[1:14:27] I'm going up not because of me, because
[1:14:30] of him. He called me.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; He resurrected me.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. He did this in my life.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; I was dead.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; I was dead.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; I was dead in sin.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Now I'm alive.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I'm alive.
[1:14:54] You see, I don't look at this flesh. Go
[1:14:56] ahead and look at this flesh.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll be the first one to tell you
[1:15:01] it's not perfect, but I'm alive
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; and I know him in the power of his
[1:15:06] resurrection.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Every day I've known him in the power of
[1:15:10] his resurrection. Cuz that power will
[1:15:12] never the blood will never cease. Amen.
[1:15:15] To lose its power until the church of
[1:15:18] God be saved out of this world to sin no
[1:15:21] more. Praise God.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. Thank you Lord.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Ah hallelujah.
[1:15:31] Oh my.
[1:15:33] Let us be very clear. When you are born
[1:15:35] again that gives you the power to be
[1:15:37] free indeed. There is no power to set
[1:15:40] you free like like being a reli being
[1:15:44] religious or following the law or being
[1:15:46] legalistic or believing that God sent a
[1:15:48] prophet or believing you say this
[1:15:51] because you're in the message and you
[1:15:53] listen to the tapes. That's all good.
[1:15:57] If the spirit of God hasn't given you
[1:15:58] the new birth inside of you,
[1:16:02] it's all good. But if the spirit of God
[1:16:04] hasn't given you the new birth,
[1:16:06] hallelujah, you will definitely take
[1:16:09] this word, the prophet's message, the
[1:16:12] law, like Moses's, like the Pharisees
[1:16:14] and Sadducees. You'll take it and you'll
[1:16:16] produce the same thing.
[1:16:18] Amen. Must be born again. Freedom only
[1:16:22] comes when there comes an awakening to
[1:16:26] you out of your sleep and slumber of the
[1:16:28] flesh. Romans 6 4 it says we are buried
[1:16:33] with him in Christ and now we walk in
[1:16:35] newness of life in the likeness of his
[1:16:37] resurrection.
[1:16:39] Hallelujah. And our body of sin
[1:16:43] body of sin in is done away with with we
[1:16:48] are no longer slaves to sin.
[1:16:51] That's the power of the token life that
[1:16:55] sets us free indeed.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not. Listen, my brothers
[1:17:01] and sisters, it may sound like a
[1:17:03] paradox. Amen. Until it becomes real to
[1:17:06] you, but I ain't a slave to sin.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not in bondage to sin anymore.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of me.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Because I said so.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Because I did something.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; I just explained to you. And I can go on
[1:17:22] and on with experiences. Hallelujah. But
[1:17:25] he did it.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; He did something.
[1:17:29] Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; I I rest my faith in him in the finished
[1:17:33] work, what he did in my life. If I stand
[1:17:36] before the devil and all his attacks
[1:17:39] with this God, amen, that raised me from
[1:17:42] the dead that is doing these things.
[1:17:44] Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; The gates of hell
[1:17:49] will not prevail.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; I said the gates of hell will not
[1:17:54] prevail against a born again believer.
[1:17:58] It has no power over you,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; oh God. But by faith.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Through faith, by faith, we take
[1:18:09] the word that has been given to us.
[1:18:11] Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; And take the sword.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I remember that message brother
[1:18:18] Simon preached many years ago. Classic
[1:18:21] messages. Take the sword off the wall.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Take take it out of your holster.
[1:18:28] Amen. Get it out. Get the word out and
[1:18:32] start using it, my brothers and sisters.
[1:18:34] Stop letting the devil bind you, control
[1:18:37] you.
[1:18:40] Amen.
[1:18:45] Oh my.
[1:18:48] Thank you, Lord. Where the spirit of the
[1:18:51] Lord is, there is liberty.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, liberty.
[1:18:57] The spirit of the Lord is in our lives.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We say we look at it. It's in the
[1:19:03] building. Here it is in the building. I
[1:19:05] know he's here. Hallelujah. But where
[1:19:08] the spirit of the Lord is, there's
[1:19:09] liberty. Listen, the spirit of the Lord
[1:19:11] is here. He's there. There's liberty.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Freedom.
[1:19:18] Amen. Freedom. Hallelujah. I believe
[1:19:21] every word of God and I believe in the
[1:19:24] true freedom. Amen. I believe in total
[1:19:27] deliverance. Amen.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; I believe in the healing power. I
[1:19:31] believe in everything. Hallelujah. And
[1:19:34] my faith is going to take me to every
[1:19:36] one of those promises that God has
[1:19:38] ordained for me. You You hear what I'm
[1:19:40] saying? My faith is going to take me to
[1:19:42] every one of those promises and they are
[1:19:44] going to manifest in my life.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; That's what the song says. If you don't
[1:19:48] want to go, don't hinder me. Hallelujah.
[1:19:51] I'm going in that direction with the
[1:19:53] word of God in my life. Amen.
[1:19:55] Hallelujah. You want to follow the
[1:19:57] world. You want to follow your flesh.
[1:20:00] Amen. You want to follow your pleasures.
[1:20:02] You want to follow your cultures. You
[1:20:03] want to follow your traditions. Go
[1:20:05] ahead. Don't hinder me. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:20:09] following the revealed word that's
[1:20:11] becoming alive inside of me. Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; All I see in my life, Amen. I have
[1:20:16] desires. I'm a passion like passion man
[1:20:19] just like any one of you. I have desires
[1:20:21] and all that, but all I want to see in
[1:20:24] my life is God and the word made flesh
[1:20:27] in my life ever since day one that he
[1:20:30] called me. Amen. That's all that's in my
[1:20:33] heart. Amen.
[1:20:36] Because he is alive in there, not
[1:20:38] because of me. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:20:43] Oh, hallelujah. I thought I was get
[1:20:46] getting near the close here. Lord is
[1:20:48] slowing down the time for me. Amen.
[1:20:51] Hallelujah.
[1:20:55] Glory to God. Hallelujah. The Bible
[1:20:58] passage speaks about not drawn back from
[1:21:02] the liberty given to believers. In
[1:21:05] Galatians 5:1, it says, "Stand
[1:21:07] steadfast, therefore, in the liberty by
[1:21:10] which Christ has made us free, and do
[1:21:13] not entangle
[1:21:15] again with the yoke of bondage."
[1:21:19] Oh God, help us, Lord. Galatians 5:1 is
[1:21:24] part of Paul's letter to the Galatians
[1:21:26] where he's addressing the issue of
[1:21:28] legalism and the importance of faith in
[1:21:31] Christ for salvation.
[1:21:33] Oh, it says and warns us in the
[1:21:36] scriptures. Amen. And we all tempted in
[1:21:39] this area. All of us. Even myself, I've
[1:21:42] gone through it where in your mind,
[1:21:45] Satan will try to bring you back. When
[1:21:48] God is setting you free by grace, by the
[1:21:50] revealed word, I know what I'm saying
[1:21:52] here. Satan will try to bring you back
[1:21:55] into bondage to the law, to works.
[1:22:00] Oh yeah. In your heart. I'm not saying
[1:22:03] that works, we need to do works. We need
[1:22:05] to do things, but in your heart.
[1:22:09] Amen. And when you do that in your
[1:22:11] heart, then you start believing by your
[1:22:14] works and by the law that you're saved,
[1:22:18] that you're okay, that you're accepted
[1:22:20] in God. And that's a lie of the devil.
[1:22:24] Because you're taking away the the the
[1:22:26] his death. You're taking away the cross,
[1:22:28] the power of the cross, the
[1:22:30] resurrection. You're taking away
[1:22:31] everything. Hallelujah. Amen. And you're
[1:22:34] putting it on yourself. Hallelujah.
[1:22:38] Glory to God. The liberty mentions
[1:22:40] refers to the freedom from bondage of
[1:22:42] sin and the law that believers receive
[1:22:45] through faith in Jesus Christ. The yoke
[1:22:47] of bondage refers to the system and
[1:22:49] rules and rituals that we part of the
[1:22:53] old testament law which could not save
[1:22:56] people from their sin. It will not save
[1:23:00] you today from your sins. all your
[1:23:04] works, a legalism spirit, all these
[1:23:08] things will not save you today.
[1:23:11] Hallelujah. Paul urges believers to
[1:23:13] stand fast in the liberty. Meaning they
[1:23:16] should remain steadfast in their faith,
[1:23:20] in their revelation,
[1:23:22] and not swave by those who promote to
[1:23:27] you to return to legalistic practices.
[1:23:33] It's here.
[1:23:35] It's being preached in this message.
[1:23:38] God has set his people free.
[1:23:42] Amen. Just like Paul said, he said,
[1:23:45] "Certain ones creeped in amongst you to
[1:23:48] spy out your what?" Liberty in Christ,
[1:23:51] your freedom in Christ, your revelation
[1:23:54] in Christ to bring you back where? Into
[1:23:58] bondage to the law.
[1:24:02] He said, "Watch out for that.
[1:24:05] For Christ has set us free and set us at
[1:24:08] liberty, my brothers and sisters, to
[1:24:11] walk by faith."
[1:24:14] Hallelujah. To walk by faith in what he
[1:24:17] has done. We are free.
[1:24:20] Hallelujah.
[1:24:22] Amen.
[1:24:25] Hallelujah. This freedom is not a
[1:24:27] license to sin, but rather a call to
[1:24:30] serve one another in love described in
[1:24:32] Galatians 5:13. For you, brethren, have
[1:24:35] been called to liberty.
[1:24:37] Only do not use your liberty for an
[1:24:40] occasion to the flesh, but through love
[1:24:42] serve one another. Hallelujah. And
[1:24:45] that's for believers. Amen. The Bible
[1:24:49] stating, "My soul will have no pleasure
[1:24:51] in those who draw back," is found in
[1:24:54] Hebrews 10:38. Now the just shall live
[1:24:56] by faith. If any man draw back, soul
[1:25:00] shall have no pleasure. You see, there's
[1:25:02] no drawing back. God don't return. God
[1:25:05] don't go back. God don't retreat. Amen.
[1:25:08] And Amen. His believers, his sons and
[1:25:11] daughters of God, don't draw back. They
[1:25:13] keep going forward. Amen. I'm going
[1:25:16] forward this morning.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going forward this
[1:25:19] morning.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. You want to go
[1:25:22] forward. Amen.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; In what? Deliverance. Hallelujah. Do I
[1:25:26] need more still more deliverance? Yes.
[1:25:28] Do you? Yes. That's why we come and hear
[1:25:31] the word. Not to draw back into our
[1:25:34] pleasures and into our mind and and
[1:25:37] drawn back that we're okay. We're not
[1:25:39] okay. Amen. I'm not okay. I never say
[1:25:43] I'm okay. Amen. I say by the grace of
[1:25:46] God.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. By the grace of God, today I will
[1:25:49] go forward in his name.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] Hallelujah.
[1:25:58] Amen.
[1:26:00] Hallelujah.
[1:26:02] If Jesus would have only repeated
[1:26:04] Moses's
[1:26:07] law, think about it. In his day
[1:26:14] have been the same law,
[1:26:17] but he was li he was but he was the
[1:26:20] living word. If mo if Jesus would only
[1:26:22] repeat Moses's law for his day,
[1:26:27] he couldn't
[1:26:29] because he was the living word.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; They they said we we we when we listen
[1:26:35] to you, Jesus,
[1:26:38] the law comes alive in our hearts.
[1:26:41] You see, he was the that token.
[1:26:45] Amen. He was the seventh seal.
[1:26:49] When he spoke the word, it came alive in
[1:26:52] their hearts.
[1:26:56] The living word of the day. It's not the
[1:26:58] prophet's day anymore. It's the bride's
[1:27:01] day and the bridegroom
[1:27:04] today.
[1:27:07] And we know the prophet was part of the
[1:27:09] bride.
[1:27:14] the bridegroom today bringing the word
[1:27:16] to pass again in flesh. When a true
[1:27:19] ministry speaks today, the message comes
[1:27:22] alive
[1:27:24] and the manifestation takes place today
[1:27:27] in the life of believers.
[1:27:30] That's God riding the trail again.
[1:27:35] When they rec they recognized who the
[1:27:37] Messiah was because when he spoke the
[1:27:40] law, he spoke the written word, it came
[1:27:44] alive in their hearts. Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. God came alive in their hearts.
[1:27:51] Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; They experienced freedom.
[1:27:56] The freedom that God gives, the freedom
[1:27:59] from sin.
[1:28:02] something you can't explain, but you
[1:28:04] experience when God speaks to you. Amen.
[1:28:09] But when the law speaks to you and
[1:28:13] you're just repeating the law, Amen.
[1:28:15] It's death.
[1:28:17] It's death today to repeat the law.
[1:28:20] Hallelujah.
[1:28:22] The law, the word, Amen, has come alive.
[1:28:26] It's a living ornament. Amen. And we are
[1:28:30] living epistles today.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; It's the seventh seal. Amen. Today,
[1:28:36] that's why brother Brandon couldn't
[1:28:38] preach it.
[1:28:40] There is no words to preach the seven
[1:28:42] seal.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; How can you preach Jesus?
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; You experience him.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gets inside of you and he
[1:28:51] reveals himself to you. He lives inside
[1:28:54] of you. He manifests inside of you.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; How am I set free? How do you explain
[1:29:00] that you're set free? But you know
[1:29:02] you've been set free. You know you were
[1:29:05] in bondage to certain sins in your life.
[1:29:08] But he came and set you free. He changed
[1:29:12] your life. He changed your thinking. He
[1:29:16] changed your ways. Hallelujah. He
[1:29:19] changed your desires.
[1:29:21] Everything is changed inside of you.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; How can you truly preach that?
[1:29:28] You can't preach that.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is no words for the
[1:29:33] seventh seal.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; There's no words for the seventh seal.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm my own interpreter. I will
[1:29:41] make it plain."
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; I don't need nobody to interpret me.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is that day that we're
[1:29:48] living in now.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not the day of man
[1:29:51] anymore. Hallelujah. It's the day of
[1:29:54] God. It's the day of Jesus Christ today.
[1:29:56] Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Is where he's coming to take control.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is he's the head of the
[1:30:01] church.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; He's the head of the body.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. I believe he's real.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe he can lead and guide
[1:30:12] people today.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; I believe when I pray and I speak
[1:30:16] certain things, it'll come to pass if
[1:30:18] it's in God's will
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; and he reveals his will in your heart.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, God. Some of us don't even
[1:30:25] pray for two minutes, five minutes. How
[1:30:27] do you get in the spirit to know his
[1:30:29] will? How do you get in the spirit to
[1:30:31] know his mind? Hallelujah.
[1:30:35] Oh God.
[1:30:37] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:44] Our prophet told us that this revealed
[1:30:47] world word will bring rapture and faith.
[1:30:51] It will bring us to perfect faith.
[1:30:54] It will bring us to total deliverance.
[1:30:57] That means total freedom.
[1:30:59] We are total freedom. We are not of our
[1:31:03] flesh.
[1:31:05] We are the soul that's been born again.
[1:31:08] The seed of God in us that lives inside
[1:31:10] this flesh. And all the channels of this
[1:31:14] flesh, hallelujah, the five channels of
[1:31:17] the flesh, the five channels of the
[1:31:19] spirit, all are under subjection to the
[1:31:22] word of God.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I believe it with all my heart.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; No disbelief in the word.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What God has spoken in these last
[1:31:34] days will come to pass.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Amen. There will be
[1:31:40] a bride.
[1:31:42] Oh my, he was looking at everything.
[1:31:45] People relied on religion, people
[1:31:47] relying on traditions, people relied on
[1:31:50] churches, people believing that they're
[1:31:52] saved. All these kind of things in his
[1:31:54] day. But he said, "There will be a bride
[1:31:57] that will take this word." Amen. And
[1:32:01] become this word, become the very
[1:32:03] manifestation of this word. Oh God,
[1:32:06] that's the battle. That's the battle of
[1:32:08] sin today. That's the battle of unbelief
[1:32:11] today. That Satan's battling us.
[1:32:15] Everything he's thrown in Satan's Eden,
[1:32:18] thrown at you.
[1:32:20] Everything, distractions, all these
[1:32:22] things. Oh my.
[1:32:25] You think Brother Brandham seen in his
[1:32:26] day all the distraction, all the sin,
[1:32:29] all the worldliness, all the pleasure,
[1:32:31] all the things that drawn the people
[1:32:33] away. What about today?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; What about today?
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But a word's been spoken.
[1:32:41] Amen. The literal word of God has been
[1:32:43] spoken out of a mouth of a prophet. The
[1:32:46] voice of God has spoken out and said,
[1:32:47] "There will be a bride. There will be a
[1:32:49] real bride that will follow that word,
[1:32:52] that will live that word, that will
[1:32:53] become that word in this day. She will
[1:32:57] know. She will know who she is in this
[1:33:00] day. She'll know the father that lives
[1:33:03] inside of her.
[1:33:05] Oh God,
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; she will know her God and she will do
[1:33:09] great exports. Amen. She will do great
[1:33:12] things in these last days.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my brothers, don't worry about
[1:33:16] tribulation. Don't worry about the
[1:33:17] market of beasts. Don't worry about the
[1:33:19] government's trying to shut us down and
[1:33:21] take everything. We can't buy, we can't
[1:33:24] sell. Oh my. I know God in that day, my
[1:33:28] brothers and sisters, is going to raise
[1:33:30] the standard. Amen. You're going to see
[1:33:33] by the word of God, by thus sayeth the
[1:33:35] Lord has been spoken. Amen. The spoken
[1:33:38] word will come into manifestation.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; The creative power of God once again is
[1:33:45] going to speak through the bride of
[1:33:46] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing. That's why we're
[1:33:52] here today.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; That's why we die daily as Paul says.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; That's why we surrender our life.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:01] to believe this word.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe this word in its
[1:34:06] fullness, my brothers, you're going to
[1:34:08] be left behind.
[1:34:10] Tribulation, I'm going to tell you the
[1:34:13] truth. Tribulation is going to purge
[1:34:15] you.
[1:34:17] Hallelujah. The rapture is on right now.
[1:34:20] Amen. For you here, for you online,
[1:34:22] forever where you are. Hallelujah.
[1:34:26] The time is now.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Hear the voice of God and come now.
[1:34:30] Hallelujah.
[1:34:32] Who says you got tomorrow?
[1:34:35] You tell me in your phone, in your
[1:34:38] calendar, that you got tomorrow.
[1:34:42] You You tell me you got next week. You
[1:34:45] got next month. I'm doing this. I'm
[1:34:47] doing that.
[1:34:49] Are you? Who said you are?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Come.
[1:34:57] Come now. Amen.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, brother, I'll come next week.
[1:35:04] Come now
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; in your heart.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In your surrender.
[1:35:14] Hallelujah.
[1:35:17] Jesus said, "You and your traditions
[1:35:19] made the word of God in unffect."
[1:35:22] The Bible says, "Lay aside
[1:35:25] every sin
[1:35:27] and that easily besets you." Think about
[1:35:30] that this morning. What's besetting you?
[1:35:33] What hinders you? What gets in your way
[1:35:36] this morning? Or are you that blind that
[1:35:39] you can't even see that?
[1:35:41] That's between you and God.
[1:35:44] Hallelujah.
[1:35:46] Our
[1:35:48] culture traditions, religious
[1:35:49] traditions, human traditions, our
[1:35:52] intellectual traditions, our education
[1:35:54] traditions, all have an effect on making
[1:35:58] the word of God of none effect. Think
[1:35:59] about how powerful that was. Think about
[1:36:01] traditions. That's why I I've been
[1:36:03] preaching on it. Jesus said
[1:36:07] it's so powerful, my brothers and
[1:36:08] sisters, in our life. And we all brought
[1:36:11] up into this world in this body of flesh
[1:36:14] with traditions. There's traditions all
[1:36:16] around us. It's like habits. We break
[1:36:18] one habit and another habit comes back.
[1:36:20] That's the human nature. Traditions are
[1:36:22] all around us. Our culture is all around
[1:36:24] us. But Jesus himself said
[1:36:29] because of those things in your life and
[1:36:31] you accept them and I see it. I see it
[1:36:35] manifesting
[1:36:40] in people's lives.
[1:36:45] You're making the word of God of none
[1:36:46] effect. The real word, the living word.
[1:36:50] And what happens? You become religious.
[1:36:54] You become dead.
[1:36:57] The word of God has no effect in your
[1:36:59] life. Oh my brothers and sisters.
[1:37:03] Hallelujah.
[1:37:05] It's the rising of the sun.
[1:37:08] He is the one who opened those seals.
[1:37:12] He is those seals.
[1:37:14] The whole word of God is Christ and
[1:37:17] Christ is the seals that was opened.
[1:37:22] What is the opening of the seals then?
[1:37:25] Revealing Christ.
[1:37:29] Hallelujah.
[1:37:31] Revealing Christ in your life. That's
[1:37:34] what we're talking about.
[1:37:37] And the very seventh angel which
[1:37:40] represents the seven churches all
[1:37:43] complete
[1:37:45] and we couldn't even see it. They took
[1:37:48] the picture not us and there he's
[1:37:52] standing there supreme judge showing
[1:37:55] that he's the alpha and no omega the
[1:37:58] beginning and the end.
[1:38:00] What identification?
[1:38:03] Quickening power did that to us.
[1:38:06] Quickening power let us see his coming.
[1:38:09] Quickening power snatched us from death
[1:38:12] to life. Quickening power gives us
[1:38:14] discernment to know what's right and
[1:38:16] what's wrong, what to do and what not to
[1:38:18] do. It's quickening power. It's
[1:38:21] quickening power in your life this
[1:38:23] morning that you're here. It's
[1:38:25] quickening power that you're overcoming.
[1:38:28] Hallelujah. that you're receiving the
[1:38:30] word. Amen. It's quickening power, my
[1:38:33] brothers and sisters. You couldn't do
[1:38:35] this on your own. I couldn't do it on my
[1:38:38] own.
[1:38:39] How can I have a testimony? How can you
[1:38:42] have a testimony like you have without
[1:38:44] the quickening power
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; of God in your life? Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:52] Amen.
[1:38:54] Hallelujah. Quickening power did all
[1:38:56] these things in our lives.
[1:39:00] with all that evidence collected with us
[1:39:03] now this morning. Oh, I think of that
[1:39:06] song on that resurrection morning when
[1:39:10] death's horrors will be broken. We shall
[1:39:13] rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; We shall rise. Do you believe that?
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; In him, we become a part of him. That
[1:39:23] Easter that revealed the secret of God
[1:39:26] like it was then. life after death. We
[1:39:30] now are alive who were once dead in sin
[1:39:33] and trespasses. That true Easter seal
[1:39:36] has broken death. Amen. I believe that
[1:39:40] Easter seal has broken over my life.
[1:39:43] Hallelujah. I believe it's broken death
[1:39:45] over my life. Amen.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Hallelujah. You talk about
[1:39:51] rejoicing.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; I can't die.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; I've already died to myself. I'm already
[1:39:57] dead in Christ. Amen.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; I'm hidden in him.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; I know I'm in him. Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Is this
[1:40:07] real?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Is this word real? Is it alive inside of
[1:40:12] you?
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; That God, is he real and alive inside of
[1:40:16] you?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; These are not words anymore.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:40:22] Amen. I know I'm going to get to a place
[1:40:24] I'm not even going to preach with notes
[1:40:26] anymore. Hallelujah. Amen. He's becoming
[1:40:29] so real. He's a living Amen. Glory to
[1:40:32] God.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:38] Oh my. And now God by his Holy Spirit
[1:40:42] has broken a seal from around our lives.
[1:40:46] And Christ has revealed that he lives in
[1:40:49] us.
[1:40:50] He has revealed that he lives in us and
[1:40:54] now we are quickened
[1:40:58] with him.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Where he is, I am. Where he is, you are
[1:41:03] this morning.
[1:41:05] Oh God, not only Jesus
[1:41:10] in his own body, but Jesus in bride form
[1:41:14] now can say,
[1:41:16] "Me who you see standing here this
[1:41:18] morning is also in heaven."
[1:41:21] Oh yes.
[1:41:23] What are you talking about, Tim?
[1:41:27] Hallelujah. Just like when Jesus said to
[1:41:29] Nicodemus, "You must be born again."
[1:41:31] What are you talking about, Jesus?
[1:41:34] go in my mother's belly again at this
[1:41:36] age. What are you talking about? What
[1:41:39] are you talking about, Tim? You're
[1:41:40] standing here. I can see you.
[1:41:44] And you're in heaven, too.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm in heaven.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; How can I Oh, brother.
[1:41:56] How can this be happening to me? My God,
[1:42:01] my life, my the the life that has
[1:42:04] changed me,
[1:42:06] me preaching up here. Oh my god.
[1:42:13] I I would die if anybody asked me to to
[1:42:16] come and speak anything at a wedding or
[1:42:17] anything. I would die. I'd be in a
[1:42:20] corner going,
[1:42:23] I'm having a heart attack.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; God. what he's done for me in my life.
[1:42:30] Things that I see, things that come out
[1:42:31] of my mouth. I fellowship with my wife
[1:42:33] and some of you brethren, things that
[1:42:35] come out of my mouth sometimes after I
[1:42:36] go, "Holy cow,
[1:42:40] didn't even finish grade 10.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Never passed the spelling test."
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to put myself down.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Good. Let me put myself down so Christ
[1:42:56] could be put up.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Never passed a spelling test, a history
[1:43:02] test. None of those tests.
[1:43:05] I was a tough guy. I was a bodybuilder,
[1:43:07] good-looking guy in school. I just made
[1:43:09] my way through as a jigalo through
[1:43:11] school.
[1:43:13] That's all I was. That's all I could be.
[1:43:17] I'm just telling you the truth.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because he can't read it at
[1:43:23] all.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
[1:43:27] And I'm not like, brother Brad, I'm not
[1:43:29] supporting that.
[1:43:31] I'm just saying the life of Jesus
[1:43:34] Christ, the living word of God and what
[1:43:37] he's done. He's raised us from the dead.
[1:43:39] If this is not raised from the death, I
[1:43:41] dead, I don't know what is. Who can do
[1:43:44] greater to me in my life? Who can do
[1:43:49] greater to you in your life
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; than what Jesus done?
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; You tell me.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; You tell me who compares to this. You
[1:44:00] tell me what compares to you in your
[1:44:02] life.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; If God be God, then serve him.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; If God be real to you, then serve him
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; with all your heart.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Stop being lukewarm, lazy, lack. Stop
[1:44:16] being half devoted to this kingdom of
[1:44:18] God here
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; and serve him.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; If you find something greater than go,
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; I say go.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; But I have I I'm staying right here
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Not in this building. In Christ.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me try to wind this
[1:44:38] down. Amen.
[1:44:41] Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:44] the token.
[1:44:47] Apply it,
[1:44:49] church. Apply it.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Don't fail.
[1:44:57] Will you not?
[1:45:02] Don't let the sun set.
[1:45:05] I'm reading what the prophet is saying
[1:45:07] here. Don't rest day or night.
[1:45:11] Don't take a chance.
[1:45:15] It won't work, children.
[1:45:18] What won't work? All you're playing
[1:45:20] around, all you're hiding behind
[1:45:23] religion,
[1:45:25] it won't work. You must have the token.
[1:45:29] You must be born again.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "I believe." Yes, I
[1:45:35] believe. I go. Yes, I go. I believe the
[1:45:40] message
[1:45:42] that is all right. Are you hearing me?
[1:45:47] That is good.
[1:45:49] Not saying it's not good. It's not all
[1:45:51] right.
[1:45:53] But you must have the token.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; There's something different there.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; You see something different?
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Do you hear brother Brandham tabernacle?
[1:46:08] Do you hear Good Neighbors Ministries
[1:46:10] this morning?
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; You must have the token displayed.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Without it, all your believing, think
[1:46:23] about it, is in vain.
[1:46:28] You live a good life.
[1:46:31] You listen to what the word says.
[1:46:34] See, that's the problem. That's the
[1:46:36] unbelief. We don't listen to what the
[1:46:39] word says for us to do.
[1:46:47] The word says you go to church, you try
[1:46:50] to live right.
[1:46:52] That's fine.
[1:46:54] But that's not it.
[1:46:58] When I see the blood, that's the token.
[1:47:02] And the token is here.
[1:47:06] Just to come this far. Think about it.
[1:47:09] Just to come this far
[1:47:13] in the message for so many years
[1:47:15] following,
[1:47:16] believing with zeal
[1:47:20] and then you start falling away.
[1:47:24] falling away.
[1:47:27] Your experience, your desire for God
[1:47:31] being everything in your life starts
[1:47:33] falling away. The world starts creeping
[1:47:37] in. The water starts coming into the
[1:47:38] boat.
[1:47:40] Oh God,
[1:47:46] when I see the blood, that's the token.
[1:47:48] And the token is here. Hallelujah. I
[1:47:51] believe the message. You obey the
[1:47:54] message.
[1:47:56] Come into Christ.
[1:47:58] So obeying the message means
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; not just quoting it, not saying I
[1:48:03] believe it, but it means come into
[1:48:07] Christ.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Come into Christ.
[1:48:13] That's the key there.
[1:48:17] You say, "I believe every word you said,
[1:48:19] brother Brandham."
[1:48:22] Isn't that Is it not where I just I just
[1:48:25] get thrilled when the Holy Spirit I
[1:48:28] believe every word you say, Brother
[1:48:29] Brandon. Isn't that the same spirit? I
[1:48:32] say what the prophet says.
[1:48:35] Say everything the prophet says and say
[1:48:38] it the way he says it.
[1:48:44] You say every word you said, brother
[1:48:46] Brandham. That's good.
[1:48:49] He says that's good. Here's a prophet's
[1:48:51] own mouth. But that's not it.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; That's not it.
[1:48:58] Saying what the tapes say, saying what
[1:49:00] the prophet says, that's not it.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in the Holy Ghost is
[1:49:07] alive today? You believe he still speaks
[1:49:11] today? You still believe he has man of
[1:49:13] God that he can reveal his secrets
[1:49:15] today?
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Well, that's not it.
[1:49:20] That's a lie from the pits of hell.
[1:49:23] Brother Bradom said, the lady said to
[1:49:26] them, "Did God allow you to say things
[1:49:28] that make people go this way and that
[1:49:30] way?" He said, "Yes, God deliberately
[1:49:34] made me say things that are in the
[1:49:37] message that make people go this way,
[1:49:40] off that way, off." But he knew the Holy
[1:49:44] Ghost, Christ, this the the mighty
[1:49:46] angels come down to get this bride
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; would lead her into all truth,
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; would guide her and lead her into all
[1:49:54] truth. Because when the spirit of truth
[1:49:56] comes in her, amen, she'll be able to
[1:49:59] divide the word of God
[1:50:02] right down the middle.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:50:08] Take your religion,
[1:50:11] take your religious culture and your
[1:50:12] religious duties. I want Christ.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Now, get what I'm saying here? take your
[1:50:20] message, take all your books and take
[1:50:22] all the tapes,
[1:50:24] but give me Christ.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; When I look when I listen to the tapes
[1:50:30] and I seen a man of God, a prophet of
[1:50:33] God, which I believe with all my heart,
[1:50:35] I seen Christ.
[1:50:37] Amen. I seen Jesus Christ in my
[1:50:41] experiences
[1:50:43] that I I I I spoke today and many many
[1:50:46] more. I had all those before I even knew
[1:50:50] God sent a prophet
[1:50:54] because I was experiencing Christ.
[1:50:58] It's been Christ from the beginning is
[1:51:01] going to be Christ right to the end.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:05] I see men of God today and no other men
[1:51:09] than I believe that the prophet of God
[1:51:11] that has given us. We have nothing to
[1:51:13] preach. We'd have nothing to manifest.
[1:51:15] Amen. If the prophets of the Old
[1:51:18] Testament didn't speak and prophesy
[1:51:20] Jesus coming, Jesus wouldn't have came.
[1:51:26] You understand?
[1:51:27] So I believe the prophet. I believe the
[1:51:30] spoken word. Amen.
[1:51:34] But I see Christ.
[1:51:36] I don't see a man. Hallelujah. He never
[1:51:40] pointed He never once pointed you to
[1:51:44] him.
[1:51:46] Hallelujah.
[1:51:49] I'll be finished here in a minute.
[1:51:52] The very life that was in Christ be in
[1:51:55] you. When I see that, I'll pass over
[1:51:59] you. You see why we preach the way we
[1:52:02] preach.
[1:52:06] That you know that you know that you
[1:52:07] know.
[1:52:09] If you don't know, don't leave here
[1:52:11] today
[1:52:13] without crying out to God. Don't. You
[1:52:16] don't know if you have tomorrow.
[1:52:19] Hallelujah.
[1:52:21] There's been churches, churches, brides,
[1:52:23] brides.
[1:52:25] But there has to come one. Hallelujah.
[1:52:28] There has to come a real bride. There
[1:52:30] must come one. Not only with the
[1:52:31] mechanics, but the dynamics of it that
[1:52:35] makes that church live. as I invite the
[1:52:38] musicians up and move in the power of
[1:52:40] his resurrection
[1:52:42] until we come to that place. And that's
[1:52:44] the place where we're coming to. That's
[1:52:46] the place that the Holy Ghost is leading
[1:52:48] us to to that place. What place?
[1:52:52] The dynamics on the mechanics making the
[1:52:56] church live and move in the power of his
[1:52:58] resurrection.
[1:53:00] And as he
[1:53:03] being the bride, being the groom, the
[1:53:05] bride has to come forth because it's
[1:53:08] part of him.
[1:53:10] These are prophecies here. This is me
[1:53:12] and you if you believe you're the bride
[1:53:15] of Jesus Christ. And it can only be the
[1:53:19] manifestation of the fullness of all the
[1:53:23] revelations.
[1:53:25] any other that's spoken of the bride,
[1:53:30] it can only manifest.
[1:53:33] If it does something different from the
[1:53:36] groom,
[1:53:38] it isn't the bride
[1:53:41] because she is flesh of his flesh and
[1:53:44] bone of his bone, life of his life,
[1:53:48] power of his power. She
[1:53:52] is him.
[1:53:57] She is him.
[1:54:01] Hallelujah.
[1:54:04] As a man and a woman are one and a woman
[1:54:07] taken from his side, she has taken a
[1:54:11] spirit of a feminist spirit from him.
[1:54:14] The flesh of his side made both
[1:54:16] mechanics and dynamics. the wife, the
[1:54:19] spirit of him and the and the flesh of
[1:54:22] him and put it together
[1:54:26] and made mechanics and dynamics.
[1:54:30] That's what sets us free
[1:54:33] indeed
[1:54:35] today. Surrendering your life to who?
[1:54:39] Christ, the seventh seal. He is the
[1:54:42] token. He is the very life of God in us
[1:54:47] manifesting
[1:54:48] the word of God today.
[1:54:51] Hallelujah.
[1:54:53] Glory to God.
[1:54:55] Amen.
[1:54:59] Thank God.
[1:55:01] I am free.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Free. Free.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; From this flesh of sin, from this world
[1:55:10] of sin. Amen.
[1:55:13] I've been washed in the blood.
[1:55:16] I've been born again.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:20] I'm saved. I'm saved by his wonderful
[1:55:24] grace.
[1:55:26] I'm so glad
[1:55:28] that I found out that he can pull me out
[1:55:33] and show me the way.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:38] Oh God,
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; thank God. I am free. Amen.
[1:55:44] I am free this morning. You're a son and
[1:55:48] daughter of God. Hallelujah. You are
[1:55:50] free.
[1:55:52] Oh, you might not believe it so much.
[1:55:56] You might be still bound.
[1:55:59] Hallelujah. But you're free this
[1:56:00] morning.
[1:56:02] Who the son of man sets free.
[1:56:05] All the fathers give me my hand will
[1:56:08] come. I won't lose one.
[1:56:10] Oh, the son of man is set free is free
[1:56:14] indeed.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; My brothers and sisters, all I expect
[1:56:18] out of my life, Amen, is freedom.
[1:56:22] To be set free more and more,
[1:56:26] hallelujah. It doesn't matter how much
[1:56:28] Satan fights. He can't stop this inside
[1:56:33] of me. this work that God has started
[1:56:36] inside of me. Nobody can stop it. Amen.
[1:56:40] Why? It's the seventh seal. It's Christ
[1:56:43] himself.
[1:56:45] Oh, God.
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:48] God is going to interpret his word. He
[1:56:51] is interpreting his word in this day and
[1:56:53] age.
[1:56:55] You know, Christ can stand right in
[1:56:57] flesh, right in front of people today
[1:57:00] and as and every other day they wouldn't
[1:57:02] recognize him.
[1:57:04] I said to the brothers in the back room
[1:57:06] there, I said, "We look back, I sit
[1:57:10] there and I think about this sometimes.
[1:57:13] We look back at all the prophets. We
[1:57:17] look back at Jesus. We look back at the
[1:57:20] apostles. We look back at brother
[1:57:23] Brandham
[1:57:25] and we look at ourselves as nothing.
[1:57:29] We're always looking back
[1:57:31] [Music]
[1:57:33] and looking at that.
[1:57:37] And God said to me,
[1:57:39] "Who are you?
[1:57:43] Who are you?" Remember, I didn't say to
[1:57:45] myself. God said to me, "Who are you?
[1:57:49] Who are you that I would bring you here
[1:57:53] in the last days? Who are you that I
[1:57:56] would trust you with the fullness of the
[1:57:59] word of God? Who are you that I would
[1:58:02] live inside of you like in no other
[1:58:04] time? I will possess a vessel like at no
[1:58:07] other time. Who are you that will stand
[1:58:10] on the last days and preach my word
[1:58:13] right to the end, right to the rapture?
[1:58:17] Oh hallelujah.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; You see, we never recognize
[1:58:24] what God is doing and what God is in
[1:58:27] flesh today.
[1:58:30] Who are you sons and daughters of God?
[1:58:34] You're not a housewife.
[1:58:36] You're not just working at this a
[1:58:38] carpenter. You're sons and daughters of
[1:58:41] the living God.
[1:58:43] You've been predestinated to stand on
[1:58:45] the earth in this day and bring forth
[1:58:49] Jesus Christ again. The fullness of the
[1:58:52] word, not in part,
[1:58:55] but in fullness.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; God is going to live in a people.
[1:59:03] There's going to be a bride. Amen.
[1:59:06] That's going to be fully possessed
[1:59:08] by his life. Amen.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; I come to claim my own. I come to wrap
[1:59:14] everything up. And there will be a move
[1:59:17] of God that the world will never see
[1:59:19] again in the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:59:22] Amen.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; And I believe today that God's doing a
[1:59:25] work in me. And I believe that work he's
[1:59:27] doing in me is going to manifest that.
[1:59:30] Do you believe that?
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz if you don't believe
[1:59:37] that, that's unbelief. That's sin. I
[1:59:40] believe that.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; I believe everything that he has spoken
[1:59:46] and I don't need to interpret it. I
[1:59:48] don't need to understand it. I don't
[1:59:50] need to know how he's going to do it. I
[1:59:52] believe by faith he's going to do it.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; I know what he's done in my life.
[1:59:58] I know what he's done this far.
[2:00:01] He's going to do the rest.
[2:00:04] Don't doubt.
[2:00:06] That's why that angel of love only
[2:00:09] believe my brothers and sisters, we are
[2:00:12] believing more than what they believe in
[2:00:13] back there. We got the fullness of the
[2:00:15] word. Only believe
[2:00:18] the fullness of the word on this day.
[2:00:20] Amen. Let us stand. Let us sing that
[2:00:22] song, brother Mike. Hallelujah. Are you
[2:00:26] free? Are you free?
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's worship then. Amen.
[2:00:33] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. But I am
[2:00:36] free. Free. Hallelujah.
[2:00:41] I'm free.

[2:04:06] Break the law of gravity.
[2:04:09] Lift your hands to the Lord.
[2:04:13] You're not listening to brother Tim.
[2:04:16] Brother Tim cannot do nothing for you
[2:04:18] but believe with you.
[2:04:21] If you know there's freedom that you
[2:04:24] need in your life,
[2:04:27] lift your hands to him.
[2:04:31] Father,

[2:04:52] You're here this morning,
[2:04:55] not only in the atmospheres, Father.
[2:04:57] Your spirit,

[2:05:02] us.
[2:05:04] Father,
[2:05:06] you have declared it. You have spoken
[2:05:08] it. Father,
[2:05:10] through the cross of Calvary, Father,
[2:05:14] you went down into hell,
[2:05:18] you took the keys of death, hell, and
[2:05:20] the grave.
[2:05:22] Hallelujah. You stuck it right off of
[2:05:24] Satan.
[2:05:27] No more you'll have power over my
[2:05:29] children.
[2:05:31] No more you'll control them.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; But I died and I rose again. Hallelujah.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; I am resurrected this morning.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan,
[2:05:46] that's God's property
[2:05:49] that you're holding on to. And you know
[2:05:52] you have no authority to hold on to it
[2:05:54] this morning.
[2:05:56] As the people surrender their hearts, as
[2:06:00] the people repent and confess that very
[2:06:04] sin in their hearts right now,
[2:06:07] the blood of Jesus we apply to them.
[2:06:12] Loose them right now
[2:06:16] be gone from them
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.

[2:06:32] Never go back
[2:06:35] and entertain
[2:06:37] that sin anymore.
[2:06:39] The Lord Jesus Christ has just set you
[2:06:41] free.

[2:07:02] I just commit each and everyone in your
[2:07:04] hands and myself, Father, and the word
[2:07:06] that was spoken, you promised it won't
[2:07:08] return void, but it will accomplish.
[2:07:11] I know it's going to accomplish, Father.
[2:07:14] In Jesus precious name we pray.
[2:07:17] Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
