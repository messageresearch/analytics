[32:23] thank you for that Lord bless those that
[32:25] are listening in today Lord let there be
[32:27] a PO portion of your word for them Lord
[32:30] may it bring life and Liberty and we'll
[32:34] give you praise glory and honor for it
[32:37] all Lord in Jesus name amen praise God
[32:41] God bless you Saints we're going to read
[32:42] our
[32:44] scripture um we're going to
[32:46] continue um we've been looking at our
[32:49] ident our identity in Christ and uh
[32:52] specifically your identity in the
[32:55] prophecy of this day because prophecy is
[32:59] happening all around us amen it's one
[33:02] thing to be able to see it happening but
[33:04] it's another thing to see where you fit
[33:07] and how it's happening around you and
[33:10] how it's going to affect your life and
[33:12] your present and your future amen 1
[33:16] Corinthians chapter 13 verses 9 and 10
[33:19] and 10 says for we know in part and we
[33:22] prophesy in part but when that which is
[33:26] perfect is come then that which is in
[33:29] part shall be done away God bless you
[33:33] may be
[33:34] seated amen last week we were looking at
[33:37] Mary and we we looked at how the Holy
[33:39] Spirit uh brought it out for us how how
[33:43] only it was it could only the word could
[33:46] only have come to Mary at that appointed
[33:48] time because the prophecy had been given
[33:51] God knew exactly what would be required
[33:54] this was now God coming to redeem coming
[33:58] to fulfill the Plan of Redemption Mary
[34:01] was the only one that that he could come
[34:03] to amen because Mary would be the one
[34:06] that would be the carrier of the
[34:09] antidote to reverse the curse of death
[34:12] amen she did not have the seed she was a
[34:17] carrier of the seed amen the angel of
[34:20] the Lord said the Holy Ghost shall come
[34:23] over thee and thou shalt bring forth a
[34:26] son and his name Shall be Called
[34:29] Emmanuel God With Us because now Jesus
[34:34] Christ was in the stage now where he
[34:37] himself would have to come pay the price
[34:40] for the sin and the unbelief and take
[34:42] the sin to Calvary so that he could
[34:45] bring and allow the Holy Ghost which is
[34:48] the antidote in this day and in this
[34:50] hour amen praise God that's the only
[34:53] thing that's going to take you out of
[34:55] this great mess that the world is going
[34:57] into to right now glory to God Amen and
[35:01] so Mary was a type of the
[35:03] Bride she was a virgin she could not
[35:08] have been touched by
[35:10] anybody just like the church for this
[35:12] day and this hour Christ is going to
[35:15] restore Adam back to the original like
[35:20] it was in the beginning and in Adam was
[35:23] Eve their name was Adam they were one
[35:28] amen they were of the same material they
[35:30] were God made flesh God In His Image
[35:35] amen praise God and God now is restoring
[35:39] that back again where Jesus Christ the
[35:43] the the the the male aspect of Adam
[35:46] coming down by the Holy Ghost after
[35:49] going to Calvary like we heard let us
[35:52] never forget the importance and the
[35:54] value and the the the the the the
[35:56] Supreme
[35:58] uh uh purpose of his uh going to Calvary
[36:01] so that he could give us his life amen
[36:05] praise God and so we are ordained the
[36:08] bride the church the the wise virgin the
[36:12] one that's that she can't be touched by
[36:14] man's in by by man's Doctrine she cannot
[36:17] be a part of a of a denominational
[36:20] church can you see how how the Virgin
[36:23] Mary she had no connection
[36:26] whatsoever amen God had to come to a
[36:29] pure unadulterated virgin and he's
[36:32] looking for a bride in this day without
[36:34] spot or wrinkle glory to God Amen she
[36:38] was only the carrier praise God and so
[36:41] now when Christ went to Calvary he
[36:43] overcame sin so that the Holy Ghost
[36:46] could come back on an elected lady
[36:49] reverse the curse of the Beast the
[36:52] beastly nature that was injected back in
[36:55] the Garden of Eden when the serp went
[36:58] and injected Satan injected his seed
[37:01] into into Eve's womb which would bring
[37:05] forth a beastly nature uh born in sin we
[37:10] heard the scripture that brother uh
[37:12] philli read that in in iniquity was I
[37:15] formed in my mother's womb he had a
[37:18] revelation of this curse that was upon
[37:21] man kind and the only way that it could
[37:23] be reversed was Christ himself come down
[37:27] by the the Holy Ghost calling
[37:29] individuals coming to individuals just
[37:32] like he went to Mary he had to go to a
[37:35] predestinated son and daughter of God in
[37:38] these last days in the end time so that
[37:41] he could so that he could place his
[37:43] Spirit his seed and awaken the the the
[37:47] attribute that was already in you from
[37:51] before the foundations of the world
[37:53] that's why you can't you can't be a part
[37:55] of denomination you can't take the name
[37:58] of Baptist Presbyterian uh uh Jehovah
[38:03] Witness uh whatever name you can't take
[38:06] that name because there's no other name
[38:08] whereby man must be saved but by the
[38:11] name of Jesus Christ and only his seed
[38:15] can you receive and only his attribute
[38:19] can you bring forth amen praise God what
[38:21] an hour Saints and so today we want to
[38:26] continue praise God we want to continue
[38:29] and we want to move on and we want to
[38:32] read our next scripture here in Acts
[38:35] chapter 2 vers 17 and 18 and it says and
[38:40] it shall come to pass in the last days
[38:42] how many believe we're in the last days
[38:43] amen sayith God I will pour out my
[38:47] spirit upon All Flesh so now we need to
[38:50] see right in there that it that it's
[38:53] going on All
[38:54] Flesh but not all flesh
[38:58] contains attributes of God Amen I will
[39:02] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[39:04] your sons and your daughters shall
[39:06] prophesy and your young men shall see
[39:09] visions and your old men shall dream
[39:12] dreams and on my servants and on my
[39:15] handmaidens I will pour out in those
[39:18] days of my spirit and they shall
[39:22] prophesy amen praise God Saints this is
[39:26] the power where where the the the true
[39:29] church that has received the Holy Ghost
[39:33] has the spirit of Prophecy upon her she
[39:37] will prophesy she will not only prophesy
[39:40] but she will recognize the prophecy that
[39:43] is taking place around her amen praise
[39:46] God glory to God let's go to the next
[39:50] slide and it continues and it says and I
[39:53] will show wonders in Heaven above and
[39:56] signs in the Earth Earth beneath blood
[39:59] and fire and vapor and smoke the sun
[40:02] shall be turned into darkness and the
[40:05] moon into blood before that great and
[40:08] notable day of the Lord so we now
[40:13] recognize by this scripture that there
[40:16] are going to be signs that are going to
[40:18] take place there are going to be things
[40:20] that are going to happen around us
[40:22] before the great and notable day of the
[40:26] Lord what is the Great and notable day
[40:28] of the Lord praise God we're going to
[40:31] see here and it shall come to pass that
[40:34] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[40:37] Lord shall be saved listen I don't know
[40:40] about you I know that we've heard this
[40:42] you know he that believeth in the Lord
[40:45] Jesus Christ shall be saved but they
[40:48] need to recognize that we're in the end
[40:50] times and that there are things that are
[40:53] happening and prophecy that is being
[40:55] fulfilled around our lives and if you're
[40:58] not awake then you don't see your part
[41:01] in the prophecy you end up becoming one
[41:04] of those that are lost in in the
[41:07] unbelief thinking they have a form of
[41:10] godliness but actually denying the power
[41:13] of God denying his word but those that
[41:16] recognize the signs those that recognize
[41:20] the prophecy that's taking place they've
[41:22] been awakened and they know that they've
[41:25] come into contact with with the word
[41:29] with the spirit of God that they've
[41:31] received the Holy Ghost that they've
[41:33] been awakened that they've been born
[41:36] again their life is no longer the same
[41:39] life that they had they know that they
[41:42] know that this is a true experience and
[41:44] a reality to them amen praise God so
[41:48] when we look at some of the events and
[41:50] the timing of these events we can see
[41:52] how close we are to to major world
[41:56] events that can Usher in the Great
[41:59] Tribulation the great Wars that the
[42:02] Bible talks about and even more
[42:04] important the great and notable day of
[42:07] the Lord amen praise God we have the war
[42:11] between Israel and
[42:14] Hamas this this war is not just a a
[42:17] petty
[42:18] War it's the worst that it's ever been
[42:24] since World War II
[42:27] it's the worst that it's ever been since
[42:29] World War II this war is escalating it's
[42:33] not getting any better I know they're in
[42:35] the midst of a ceasefire but we know
[42:38] according to prophecy what is going to
[42:42] come what is going to happen how this is
[42:45] all going to unfold how that that the
[42:48] holy spirit is now finishing up with the
[42:51] Gentile Church how the holy spirit is is
[42:54] is uh uh speaking to us here in these
[42:58] last days quickening and and and just
[43:01] gleaning picking out the last one here
[43:03] calling the last one because Jesus said
[43:06] all that the father hath given me will
[43:09] come not one can be lost and so the the
[43:13] message of Christ in this hour is come
[43:15] out of her my people come out of the
[43:18] denominational teachings the doctrines
[43:20] of man you are a virgin spotless bride
[43:24] that's been ordained by Christ himself
[43:27] self to come out and be filled with his
[43:30] spirit so that you can fulfill the
[43:32] notable day of the Lord which is the
[43:35] rapture amen the coming of the lord we
[43:38] have tensions right now between the US
[43:41] and China and Russia because China and
[43:44] Russia do not agree with the stand that
[43:46] the US is taking with
[43:49] Israel because you know that that that
[43:52] that the Hamas and the houthis and all
[43:54] of these uh you know uh
[43:58] identities these are these are backed by
[44:02] Iran this all goes right back to the
[44:05] very beginning right back to the
[44:07] amalekites amen right back to the Garden
[44:09] of Eden where Satan where Cain and Abel
[44:12] Cain killing his brother it's the same
[44:15] two spirits that have been fighting all
[44:17] the way through amen praise God and so
[44:20] the US is making threats to Iran because
[44:23] of their nuclear Ambitions and so forth
[44:26] and we know that World War III is going
[44:29] to be
[44:30] nuclear amen praise God you know I mean
[44:34] it's nothing you know to be excited and
[44:37] to be happy about but we can't stop
[44:39] prophecy and we need to recognize where
[44:42] we fit into the prophecy amen glory to
[44:46] God so you know this um I don't know if
[44:49] you noticed but this Thursday and Friday
[44:51] was the Jewish Festival of purum Amen
[44:55] people know that glor glory to God you
[44:58] know
[44:59] um 39 years ago yesterday I married uh
[45:04] my Queen Esther you know purum purum was
[45:07] um was uh a festival that uh that now
[45:12] you know uh correlates and is um uh you
[45:16] know a Jewish Festival that they do
[45:18] every year in in com commemoration of
[45:22] the the Jewish people being set free
[45:25] right back you can read all about it in
[45:27] the Book of Esther you know where hmon
[45:30] who was a wicked you know descendant of
[45:33] the amalekites looking to destroy all of
[45:35] the Jewish people and Esther coming on
[45:38] the scene and you know Finding favor
[45:40] with the King and made The Plea and the
[45:43] decree was reversed and so forth and so
[45:45] today the Jewish people celebrate it as
[45:47] the season and the time of purum it it
[45:50] happens right around the uh you know
[45:52] they call it the 15th of Adar which is
[45:56] sometime in between February and March
[45:58] it's usually but this week it landed on
[46:00] the 13th and the 14th of March amen and
[46:04] so it's the it's the season of purum and
[46:07] you know I was just thinking I telling
[46:08] my wife you know as we were celebrating
[46:10] our anniversary yesterday I said you
[46:12] know that we got married right in purum
[46:14] right around that time you know like
[46:16] there's all all these little types that
[46:18] you know you can't help it you're just
[46:20] looking and you you can't help but see
[46:22] the how the spirit of God was in our
[46:24] lives we didn't know it we didn't recog
[46:27] recognize amen and that's why even
[46:29] Esther she had no
[46:31] idea you know she was a Jewish girl had
[46:34] no idea that she was going to become the
[46:37] queen amen my wife had no idea that she
[46:40] was going to marry
[46:42] me I thank God that it's the character
[46:45] of Esther and not that of
[46:48] vashi Glory to God I'm so thankful to
[46:51] the Lord for a wonderful wife and 39
[46:54] years of marriage amen
[47:00] and so the true church Esther on the
[47:02] other hand displays the true church the
[47:04] bride of Christ in her humil her
[47:07] humility submission to the king Christ
[47:09] his word purum commemorates the saving
[47:13] of the Jewish people and uh and the
[47:15] decree and so um you know let's look at
[47:18] the next slide so this week was the
[47:21] Feast of purum and there was a blood
[47:23] moon on March the 14th and um if you
[47:27] actually you know I've been kind of
[47:29] taking a deep dive into Esther and and
[47:32] the Book of of Esther and and the whole
[47:34] story and everything behind purum and um
[47:38] it's pretty fascinating amen and today
[47:41] we're just kind of laying in a little
[47:42] bit of a foundation for what's going to
[47:44] be coming because I believe that the
[47:46] Lord is just leading me into uh you know
[47:49] uh we're going to continue to move on
[47:51] with the same thought of of your
[47:53] identity in Prophecy and your identity
[47:56] in Christ
[47:57] and recognizing how you fit in the whole
[48:00] prophecy and you know that the whole
[48:01] book of Esther is basically the whole
[48:04] Prophecy of the bride and of the Jewish
[48:06] people and right from start to finish
[48:09] it's wonderful we're going to be looking
[48:10] at it and and uh we're going to draw
[48:12] some wonderful nuggets but at the same
[48:14] time I want you to realize that these
[48:17] signs that we see you know uh these
[48:20] blood moons and and so forth these are
[48:22] signs in the heaven we know that God's
[48:25] first Bible is in the heavens amen and
[48:28] God declares everything first in the
[48:30] heavens and then he declares it on the
[48:32] earth now the bride of Christ we're not
[48:35] looking at these signs to uh to to um
[48:39] you know significantly do something for
[48:42] us because we've already recognized our
[48:45] day we already know what we are to
[48:48] produce but these signs and wonders are
[48:50] for the world these signs will be looked
[48:53] back upon because before the Great
[48:56] notable day of the Lord these signs
[48:59] shall be shown and they shall be and
[49:01] they shall be remembered and they shall
[49:03] be uh a testimony of the prophecies and
[49:06] the things that God said that he would
[49:08] do according to his word amen praise God
[49:12] you know that there was a that these
[49:14] Blood Moons if you you can actually go
[49:16] back into nasau and you can go back into
[49:19] their records and they've got records
[49:21] that go back thousands of years you know
[49:25] right back to the time of Esther which
[49:28] was uh basically between
[49:31] 483 and
[49:33] 473 BC right which is about 2500 years
[49:37] ago all right that that that this and
[49:40] there were eclipses there were Blood
[49:43] Moons on the exact same times there was
[49:46] a blood moon at the time of the first
[49:49] purum and now we've had we had one last
[49:52] year we've got another one this year and
[49:54] there's another one uh scheduled for
[49:57] next year Blood Moons they represent and
[50:00] have a purpose I'm not going to get into
[50:02] all of the indepth of of uh you know
[50:05] what's behind all of that but just so
[50:07] that you know you know last week we had
[50:09] a a a seven planetary alignment this
[50:13] week the lunar eclipse that's what this
[50:15] is this is a these are eclipses these
[50:17] are eclipses of the moon when the moon
[50:19] covers the Sun or when the sun covers
[50:21] the moon amen and so even last year we
[50:24] were looking at you know signs the
[50:26] heavens and we were seeing how you know
[50:29] how the the the there was two lunar
[50:31] eclipses from 2017 and 2024 we looked at
[50:35] the significance of those dates the
[50:38] timing on it it wasn't just
[50:41] coincidence that these were these these
[50:43] were eclipses that were that went that
[50:46] were seen and went right across the USA
[50:48] one way and then right across the USA
[50:51] another way creating a cross creating
[50:55] the Alpha and the Omega
[50:57] you know with the lines that went
[50:58] through it it was all God showing uh and
[51:02] giving signs of things that are
[51:04] happening in America look what's
[51:07] happened from last year to this year
[51:09] look at the changes that are taking
[51:11] place around us recognize that these are
[51:14] signs in the heavens that are declaring
[51:17] God's prophetic word and the things that
[51:20] he is doing and for the Sons and
[51:22] Daughters of God to recognize that we
[51:24] are getting closer that the Rapture is
[51:27] at hand the notable day of the Lord at
[51:30] hand amen praise God Celestial signs
[51:33] let's look at our next
[51:36] scripture in 1 Thessalonians chap 5: 1
[51:39] to4 but of the times and the seasons
[51:42] Brethren ye have no need that I write
[51:45] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[51:49] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[51:52] thief in the night amen here we are
[51:55] we're seeing how it here it is again the
[51:57] day of the Lord now if you look at uh
[52:00] you know Thessalonians um if you look at
[52:03] Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16 which
[52:06] is the the the chapter just before this
[52:09] we know Paul is speaking about the
[52:12] Rapture he's talking about in 4:16 for
[52:15] the Lord himself shall descend from
[52:17] heaven with the Shout with the voice of
[52:20] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[52:23] and the dead in Christ shall rise from
[52:26] first so this this day of the Lord this
[52:30] notable day of the Lord is the rapture
[52:34] it's the coming of the lord it's where
[52:37] God comes to snatch his sons and his
[52:40] daughters like a thief in the night a
[52:43] lot of people are placing this scripture
[52:46] into the future not realizing that it's
[52:49] already in
[52:51] progress you see if you've recognized
[52:53] your part in the prophecy you see where
[52:56] you fit in the prophecy amen for when
[52:59] they shall say peace and safety then
[53:02] sudden destruction these are things that
[53:04] are happening right now right here right
[53:07] in the 21st century you're witnessing
[53:10] them you're reading them uh uh every
[53:13] single day you're reading about
[53:14] different events and things that are
[53:16] going on Amen praise God and it says
[53:19] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[53:22] as travail upon a woman with child and
[53:25] they shall not Escape but ye Brethren
[53:28] are not in the
[53:31] darkness you see when when when when the
[53:34] when the solar
[53:36] eclipse comes out and the blood moon
[53:39] comes out to us we look at that and we
[53:41] recognize that it's the blood of Christ
[53:43] that's covered us that's given us an
[53:47] escape that that's our identity that
[53:50] Jesus Christ the blood of Christ the
[53:52] word of God is our safe place amen am we
[53:57] are not in the darkness anymore people
[53:59] are in denomination there there you ask
[54:02] them how are you baptized they I got
[54:04] baptized as a baby I don't know how I
[54:06] was baptized I think it was in the name
[54:08] of the father and the in the titles they
[54:11] don't they don't really know they're in
[54:14] darkness and they don't know
[54:16] it but thy light has come amen blessed
[54:20] be the name of the Lord your light has
[54:23] come and that light is is here now it's
[54:26] taken you that you should not be in
[54:28] darkness that that day should not
[54:31] overtake you as a thief but the Holy
[54:35] Ghost has snatched you away like a thief
[54:37] in the night amen praise God he's he's
[54:40] taken you and he's hidden you and he's
[54:42] placed you where in the body of Christ
[54:46] glory to God that you have recognized
[54:49] the day and the hour and recognized your
[54:52] day and the message for your day
[54:55] Hallelujah

[59:19] in a cloud with power and great
[59:23] Glory well when you look at this
[59:26] scripture and that particular statement
[59:29] you know it struck me when I was reading
[59:31] that yesterday and studying I was
[59:33] thinking
[59:34] Lord we've seen
[59:36] that we've recognized that in
[59:40] 1963 the great we we saw the son of man
[59:44] coming in a cloud with power and great
[59:47] Glory that was the second coming of the
[59:50] Lord but yet this here all these things
[59:54] that are happening around us and I was
[59:56] thinking about I said oh and the and the
[59:58] Holy Spirit showed me and said yes and
[1:00:01] when the time comes that that that
[1:00:05] everything will be exposed and the word
[1:00:08] will be made plain and the bride goes in
[1:00:12] the
[1:00:13] Rapture then people will be able to look
[1:00:16] back those that are left behind and
[1:00:18] they're going to see the cloud they're
[1:00:20] going to see the the the magazine
[1:00:23] article they're going to go back and
[1:00:24] maybe listen to a message that Pastor
[1:00:26] Danny spoke on on the cloud in
[1:00:29] 1963 and they're going to realize then
[1:00:33] and actually see it then but it's going
[1:00:34] to be too late my goodness praise God
[1:00:39] because by you re listen this cloud and
[1:00:42] what it represented is what we are now
[1:00:46] feeding on and being changed in a moment
[1:00:49] in the twinkling of it we're we're being
[1:00:51] changed line upon line precept upon

[1:07:03] Supper when we look at what has taken
[1:07:06] place in our day in Revelations chap 10:
[1:07:11] 1 to 7 we need to be aware of what's
[1:07:16] happened how it's
[1:07:19] changed the whole
[1:07:21] Christian Church
[1:07:23] world how recog recognizing that is of
[1:07:26] of vital importance Saints I know I've
[1:07:29] repeated this over and over again but I
[1:07:31] want to read it again amen Revelations
[1:07:34] 10 1-7 and I saw another Mighty Angel
[1:07:37] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:07:40] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:07:43] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[1:07:46] his feet as pillars of fire that is none
[1:07:49] other than the Lord himself amen and he
[1:07:53] had in his hand a little book open and
[1:07:56] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[1:07:59] his left foot upon the Earth and he
[1:08:01] cried with a loud voice and when a lion
[1:08:04] as when a lion Roth and when he had
[1:08:06] cried seven Thunders uttered their
[1:08:09] voices and when the seven Thunders
[1:08:12] uttered their voices I was about to
[1:08:14] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:08:16] saying unto me seal up those things
[1:08:19] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[1:08:21] write them not those listen what was in
[1:08:25] what was in those Thunders was the was
[1:08:28] the revelation of the mystery of Jesus
[1:08:31] Christ it could not be written and it'll
[1:08:35] never be
[1:08:37] written because it can only be
[1:08:40] revealed it's not something that you
[1:08:42] will be able to read it'll be something
[1:08:45] that is revealed to you by the opening
[1:08:48] of the word and here he says he says
[1:08:50] write them not and the angel which I saw
[1:08:52] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:08:54] lifted up up his hand to heaven and
[1:08:57] swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:08:59] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:09:02] that are therein are and the earth and
[1:09:05] the things that are therein are and the
[1:09:07] Sea and the things which are therein
[1:09:10] that there should be time no longer
[1:09:14] Saints we have crossed into another
[1:09:18] church
[1:09:19] age the prophecy of this hour and the
[1:09:22] Fulfillment of this very scripture back
[1:09:25] in
[1:09:27] 1963 would introduce the mighty Angel
[1:09:30] himself whereby he would
[1:09:33] translate and move the church from time
[1:09:38] to
[1:09:39] Eternity from a time of from from a from
[1:09:42] a a church age where where where where
[1:09:44] the doctrines and the teachings of man
[1:09:47] would be completely uh set aside and it
[1:09:51] would be the mighty Angel himself Christ
[1:09:53] himself that would come into that that
[1:09:55] very
[1:09:57] church and reveal
[1:09:59] himself and identify
[1:10:02] himself identify his word identify the
[1:10:07] prophecy of his word in the day that we
[1:10:10] are living so that this world could know
[1:10:13] that that his whole Plan of Redemption
[1:10:16] was not just about doctrines of man and
[1:10:19] about a history of somebody that went to
[1:10:22] the cross and somebody that died 2,000
[1:10:24] years ago ago but that he was a living
[1:10:28] present God that was going to vindicate
[1:10:31] his word to this generation and to this
[1:10:34] people and to this to to this world in
[1:10:37] this day and in this hour amen praise
[1:10:40] God time should be no more amen no
[1:10:43] longer but in the days of the voice of
[1:10:47] the seventh angel it wasn't William
[1:10:49] brandham who was who was the the the the
[1:10:52] the mighty
[1:10:53] Angel William Bram was not the mighty
[1:10:56] Angel but his voice amen was used to
[1:11:00] bring forth the the opening of the word
[1:11:03] his voice was used to speak those
[1:11:06] Thunders amen something that you would
[1:11:09] not be able to interpret that's why when
[1:11:12] those seals were open you could not if
[1:11:15] if man was going to try to interpret
[1:11:17] those seals he would have made a mess of
[1:11:19] them even William brandom would have
[1:11:22] made a mess of them if not for the angel
[1:11:24] of the Lord coming in and opening the
[1:11:26] word and making it real to him what
[1:11:29] actually took place by Vision he could
[1:11:32] actually see everything that was taking
[1:11:34] place at that time but in the days of
[1:11:36] his voice that's why it's called the
[1:11:38] voice of God
[1:11:40] Recordings it's not the voice of William
[1:11:43] brandham recordings it's the voice of
[1:11:45] God
[1:11:46] Recordings amen glory to God and that's

[1:17:16] justification in sanctification in the
[1:17:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the spirit
[1:17:22] in the gifts of the Holy Ghost he
[1:17:24] doesn't change but his word is moving on
[1:17:28] and it's a Rapture message it's one of
[1:17:31] perfect faith and Revelation that can
[1:17:33] only take you over amen so the
[1:17:36] Pentecostal age is over and now you go
[1:17:38] into what eternity no more sevens no

[1:18:23] you got one on the right and and they're
[1:18:25] both way
[1:18:27] out and none of them are
[1:18:30] right that's why we don't get involved
[1:18:33] with
[1:18:35] politics we know who the father of
[1:18:38] politics
[1:18:39] is he stood there before Jesus when he
[1:18:42] temped him in the 40 days and he offered
[1:18:45] him all the kingdoms of the world he
[1:18:46] says they're all mine who was that Satan
[1:18:50] am I'll give them to you if you bow to
[1:18:52] me we do not bow to
[1:18:55] politics we do not get caught up oh

[1:19:01] Trump oh I'm gonna vote for Kamala I'm
[1:19:04] gonna vote for Trudeau I'm gonna vote
[1:19:06] for this guy I'm gon it's all political
[1:19:10] noise it's all the perplexity of Nations
[1:19:14] they're going into the pro into the
[1:19:16] prophecy that they're supposed to come
[1:19:18] into they can't help it they're going to
[1:19:20] fall into the prophecy whether they like
[1:19:22] it or not and the world is in a Sodom
[1:19:25] Condition it's in a it's in a condition
[1:19:28] where it does not uh uh respect the
[1:19:31] authority of God's
[1:19:32] word amen praise God New Age teachings
[1:19:36] and everything else Jesus said in Luke
[1:19:39] 17:30 as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:19:43] shall it be when he comes and reveals
[1:19:45] himself amen and he's come and done it
[1:19:48] let's read the last uh uh quote and then
[1:19:51] we're and we'll be done 1964 proving his
[1:19:55] word and Jesus said as it was in the
[1:19:57] days of Sodom now watch close in the
[1:20:00] days of Sodom so will it be at the
[1:20:02] coming of the son of man when the son of
[1:20:05] man is being revealed he's been revealed
[1:20:07] have you recognized him have you do you
[1:20:10] know that he's already come that he's
[1:20:11] here he's now speaking by the by the
[1:20:14] preaching the foolishness of the
[1:20:16] preaching of his word just like when he
[1:20:18] was on the earth he'd go into the
[1:20:19] synagogues and he opened the scripture
[1:20:21] and he was standing there the word
[1:20:23] imagine the word open opening the word
[1:20:25] and turned to them and said this day
[1:20:27] this scripture is be is fulfilled before
[1:20:30] your very eyes they couldn't take it
[1:20:33] they couldn't accept it they couldn't
[1:20:35] there's no way and that's why when when
[1:20:37] you tell somebody that you've received
[1:20:39] the word and that you are now actually
[1:20:41] the manifestation of that word because
[1:20:43] you're that church you're you're Mary
[1:20:46] you're you're you're the carrier of the
[1:20:48] word now in this day and in this hour
[1:20:50] because the curse has been reversed on
[1:20:52] your life you don't you're no longer
[1:20:55] headed for death Jesus said he that
[1:20:56] believeth my word shall pass from Death
[1:21:00] unto life amen praise God and Jesus he
[1:21:04] goes on and he says so in the days of
[1:21:06] Sodom so will it be in the coming of the
[1:21:08] son of man when the son of man is being
[1:21:09] revealed not no more as a church see not
[1:21:15] no more the bride is called see so it's
[1:21:19] not no longer the the church it's now
[1:21:22] the bride it's now God God because he
[1:21:25] knows that that all the churches out
[1:21:27] there they've taken other men's
[1:21:29] teachings God came to them and they were
[1:21:32] already impregnated with with another
[1:21:33] man's seed he's looking for a for a
[1:21:36] virgin bride it's all typ form Saints
[1:21:39] now don't think you can be a virgin in
[1:21:42] your life and perfect in your living I'm
[1:21:45] not talking about that as long as you're
[1:21:47] in this flesh you're going to make
[1:21:49] mistakes and that's why we come to the
[1:21:51] Lord's Supper so that we can remember
[1:21:53] Hallelujah praise God so that we can
[1:21:56] know what God has done for us amen and
[1:21:58] what what he's delivered us from in that
[1:22:00] day the son of man will be revealed what
[1:22:03] to join the church to the Head unite the
[1:22:07] marriage of the Bride the bridegroom
[1:22:10] call will come right through all of this
[1:22:12] when the son of man will come down and
[1:22:16] come in human flesh how's he coming in
[1:22:19] human flesh in this hour in you and me
[1:22:23] they don't want to accept accept that
[1:22:25] they they listen when Jesus walked in
[1:22:27] human flesh back 2,000 years ago they
[1:22:29] called him be elab they're going to do
[1:22:32] and and the priests of that day so
[1:22:34] that's why I tell everybody check the
[1:22:38] scriptures search the scriptures for you
[1:22:41] think you have eternal life but are you
[1:22:43] sure that you're not calling Jesus be
[1:22:47] elub because to do it in this hour is
[1:22:50] eternal damnation you better be careful
[1:22:53] what you're reading what you're
[1:22:54] believing and what you're practicing
[1:22:57] when it comes to the word of God Amen
[1:22:59] because God's word is now Jesus said you
[1:23:02] can blaspheme uh me right now but when
[1:23:05] the Holy Ghost comes when he comes to
[1:23:07] call the last ones there'll be
[1:23:12] no it'll be done once the the Rapture is
[1:23:16] gone and the bride is called and she's
[1:23:18] in nobody else can come in it's sealed
[1:23:22] until the day of our Redemption
[1:23:24] hallelujah hallelujah and so the
[1:23:26] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:23:28] all of this chaos that I'm just adding
[1:23:31] over here when the son of man will come
[1:23:33] down in human flesh to to unite the two
[1:23:36] together the church has to be the word
[1:23:39] you see why I say listen if you're
[1:23:42] baptized how are you baptized I'm just
[1:23:44] using that as an example because it's
[1:23:46] the easiest example and if somebody
[1:23:48] can't go back and say acts
[1:23:50] 238 baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:23:54] Jesus Christ buried in the water my old
[1:23:57] life got buried in that water and I came
[1:24:00] up a brand new individual now you could
[1:24:03] go in a a dry Sinner and come out a wet
[1:24:05] sinner if you don't have a
[1:24:07] revelation of what he meant in that
[1:24:11] death you got to die out to your old
[1:24:14] thinking your old ways and you've got to
[1:24:16] allow that that attribute to take
[1:24:18] control of your life and possess you
[1:24:22] amen the spirit of God to unite the
[1:24:24] together the church has to be the word
[1:24:26] he is the word and the two unites
[1:24:29] together to do that it'll take the
[1:24:31] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:24:34] son of man not a clergyman I don't know
[1:24:37] do do you see what I mean see it's it's
[1:24:40] the son of man it's Jesus Christ will
[1:24:42] come down in human flesh Among Us and
[1:24:47] will make his word so real that it'll
[1:24:49] unite the church and him as one the
[1:24:52] bride and then she'll go home to the
[1:24:55] wedding supper amen she's already United
[1:24:58] she's already married we're not going to
[1:25:00] get
[1:25:01] married the invisible Union of the Bride
[1:25:05] of Jesus Christ was you receiving this
[1:25:09] message this word and accepting Christ
[1:25:12] and at that point you became Mrs
[1:25:15] Jesus you took his name for there's no
[1:25:18] other name whereby you must be saved but
[1:25:22] by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:25:24] do you see the importance of it it's all
[1:25:28] Earthly it's all part of this Plan of
[1:25:31] Redemption but it's the only thing if we
[1:25:33] don't come by the word then we're going
[1:25:35] to come by some teaching of man and it's
[1:25:38] going to lead you into tribulation it's
[1:25:39] not going to lead you into the
[1:25:41] Rapture glory to God Amen she's already
[1:25:44] United see we go to the wedding supper
[1:25:47] not to the
[1:25:50] marriage let the brothers come as we go
[1:25:53] into the the Lord's
[1:25:56] supper now I don't know if you've
[1:25:58] recognized but this is the Lord's Supper
[1:26:01] than you Jesus this word that we're
[1:26:03] feeding on is the bread of life am the
[1:26:07] stimulation that you feel when you hear
[1:26:09] the word and it and it stirs your heart
[1:26:11] and it makes you rejoice and say amen
[1:26:14] glory to God that's the stimulation that
[1:26:16] comes by the
[1:26:18] wine and the wine represents what the
[1:26:21] blood and the blood represents what the
[1:26:23] Holy Ghost
[1:26:25] and so when we go into the Lord's Supper
[1:26:27] it's because we are feeding on the
[1:26:29] present fresh Mana of God's word and we
[1:26:33] can recognize by looking back that when
[1:26:35] he says do this in remembrance of me
[1:26:38] when we read the scripture here in in uh
[1:26:42] Corinthians 1 Corinthians chap 11 he
[1:26:45] says for I have received of the Lord
[1:26:48] that which I which also I delivered unto
[1:26:52] you that the Lord Jesus Jus the same
[1:26:54] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:26:58] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:27:01] break it and said take eat this is my
[1:27:05] body which is broken for you this do and
[1:27:09] and in remembrance of me he was talking
[1:27:13] about his word he was talking about
[1:27:15] everything that he had spoken and he was
[1:27:18] talking about how he was going to give
[1:27:20] his body as a as a sacrifice for our
[1:27:26] Redemption so that our sin could be
[1:27:29] wiped away so that so that he he he
[1:27:32] became sin so that we could
[1:27:34] become
[1:27:36] eternal glory to God
[1:27:39] Amen and after this
[1:27:42] manner and the same manner also he took
[1:27:44] the cup well first let's let's do he
[1:27:48] break it and said take eat this is my
[1:27:50] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:27:53] remembrance
[1:27:54] of me brother would you pray and give
[1:27:57] thanks for the
[1:27:58] bread remember this is not the literal
[1:28:00] Body of Christ this represents his word

[1:28:08] presence his present truth amen go ahead

[1:29:22] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[1:29:26] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:29:30] ye eat this bread and drink this cup you
[1:29:34] do show the Lord's death till he come

[1:29:54] thank
[1:29:56] you appreciate

[1:30:36] God verse 27 says wherefor whosoever
[1:30:41] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:30:44] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:30:47] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:30:52] let a man examine him
[1:30:54] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:30:58] and drink of that cup for he that eateth
[1:31:01] and drinketh unworthily eateth and
[1:31:03] drinketh Damnation to himself not
[1:31:06] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:31:09] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:31:12] and many sleep for for if we would judge
[1:31:16] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:31:19] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:31:22] the Lord that we should should not be
[1:31:24] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:31:27] brethren when ye come together to eat
[1:31:30] Terry one for
[1:31:35] another this
[1:31:37] time I'd
[1:31:39] like the deacons and some ushers to come
[1:31:45] and assist and to hand out the
[1:31:48] emblems
[1:31:51] quickly everybody hold the
[1:31:54] bread and hold the wine and we will
[1:31:57] partake
[1:31:58] together once we've received it if we
[1:32:01] could just have some
[1:32:09] music glory to
[1:32:14] God what a glorious Victory when we feed
[1:32:17] on the word of God when we when we know
[1:32:20] that the bread of life is Christ himself
[1:32:23] his word his
[1:32:26] promises there's nothing like fresh
[1:32:29] bread you know when you you go to a
[1:32:30] bakery and it smells fresh and there's
[1:32:33] you know it just it's so desirable well
[1:32:36] it's the same thing in the word of God
[1:32:39] when you are actually feeding on the the
[1:32:42] revealed word the fresh word of God not
[1:32:46] teachings of man or something that comes
[1:32:48] out of a catechism and you just do it
[1:32:50] out of repeat you know every week
[1:32:53] repeating the same thing and over and
[1:32:56] over again and and not living that life
[1:32:59] not having that that that sincerity of
[1:33:03] the word of God where you know that
[1:33:05] you're living for him sure you make
[1:33:08] mistakes we're all human we're going to
[1:33:10] make mistakes but that's why the blood
[1:33:12] is there that's why he he he he's he's
[1:33:15] constantly making intercession in you
[1:33:19] now the intercession takes place within
[1:33:21] you so the moment that that the enemy
[1:33:24] you know deceives you in your flesh and
[1:33:26] you you say something that you didn't
[1:33:28] want to say or you do something that you
[1:33:29] didn't want to do right away that
[1:33:31] attribute raises up the spirit of God in
[1:33:33] you and says you know that's not right
[1:33:36] that's why we need to examine ourselves
[1:33:38] we need to examine our thoughts our
[1:33:40] motives and our ideas and our our ways
[1:33:44] we need to examine so that we can lay it
[1:33:46] at the altar and say Lord you know my
[1:33:50] weakness you know where I need your help
[1:33:52] Father I'm surrendering I'm yielding my
[1:33:55] spirit unto you oh God and allowing you
[1:33:58] to take preeminence and have
[1:34:01] control and then he he he gives you a
[1:34:04] fresh
[1:34:05] start you see he listen if you're a son
[1:34:09] or a daughter of God there's no way you
[1:34:11] can be
[1:34:12] lost because Eternal means having no
[1:34:15] beginning and no
[1:34:17] end we need to get that understanding
[1:34:20] when we really surrender unto the Lord
[1:34:22] and we come to that place place where
[1:34:24] where we believe it's Christ we believe
[1:34:27] that his word that he went to Calvary he
[1:34:30] took my place he took the he took the
[1:34:32] the most brutal death that man could
[1:34:35] possibly face in the way that he faced
[1:34:38] it he didn't want to leave any excuse he
[1:34:42] he listen he showed that there was no
[1:34:45] sin that was too bad or too wrong or or
[1:34:50] or that that that could what can
[1:34:52] separate us from the love of
[1:34:54] God he showed it in every example Paul
[1:34:58] imagine Paul he was killing Christians
[1:35:01] he was killing our brothers and
[1:35:03] sisters but yet when the time was was
[1:35:07] come for God to knock him off his high
[1:35:09] horse and bring him to a realization of
[1:35:11] who he really was he wiped away all his
[1:35:15] sin though Paul had to struggle with his
[1:35:17] unbelief like you and me we we we can't
[1:35:20] help it our memories play games with us
[1:35:22] it's constantly playing you know Havoc
[1:35:25] with our minds and trying to bring us
[1:35:27] under condemnation but if you are in
[1:35:29] Christ today you've surrendered there is
[1:35:32] therefore no condemnation to them that
[1:35:34] are in Christ
[1:35:36] Jesus and so you can walk
[1:35:38] free you can be free you can start brand

[1:40:02] Christ in St John 13th chapter veres 3
[1:40:11] to8 Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:40:14] given him all things into his hands and
[1:40:16] that he was come from God and went to
[1:40:20] God see he knew exactly
[1:40:23] why he came he knew exactly who he was
[1:40:28] he knew that he was God but yet he also
[1:40:31] knew that he was going to
[1:40:33] Calvary he knew what he came to do what
[1:40:36] the purpose was but yet he could humble
[1:40:38] himself and then it says and he rised
[1:40:41] from the supper and laid aside his
[1:40:43] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:40:46] himself after that he poured water into
[1:40:49] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:40:51] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[1:40:54] wherewith he was
[1:40:55] GED then cometh he to Simon Peter then
[1:41:01] cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith
[1:41:04] unto him Lord doth thou wash my feet and
[1:41:08] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:41:10] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[1:41:13] know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Lord

[1:41:43] was the king of glory he could humble
[1:41:47] himself to wash his disciples feet and
