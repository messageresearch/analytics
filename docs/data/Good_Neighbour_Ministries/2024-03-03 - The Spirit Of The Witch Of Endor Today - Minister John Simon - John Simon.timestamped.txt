[38:17] scripture to our
[38:21] scripture first
[38:24] Samuel uh 28
[38:30] and we'll
[38:32] read just from the 3D verse to the
[38:38] 7th just to give a background but in
[38:43] your own time you can read the entire
[38:46] chapter which will give you a better
[38:49] idea oh praise God let us pray our
[38:53] gracious and eternal Heavenly Father
[38:57] not just that I'm standing here but
[39:02] father uh for the people to have
[39:05] confidence and faith that you an unseen
[39:10] being envelops us into your divine
[39:15] presence and that you by the
[39:18] instrumentality of the word of God can
[39:22] speak not to our flesh but to speak to
[39:25] our hearts
[39:27] and that with the opening of the eyes of
[39:30] the heart we may recognize you we may
[39:34] give you praise and honor and Glory
[39:37] father for you have not changed but the
[39:41] devil has blinded the eyes of man and
[39:44] took them away in darkness so they can't
[39:47] recognize you because you being
[39:50] invisible but we recognize you we know
[39:55] you by the word
[39:57] we pray that once again you'll speak to
[39:59] us by the word that we might be in the
[40:02] correct time and
[40:05] season and the application of the word
[40:09] will be for the day and the moment that
[40:11] we're living in we give you glory and
[40:14] praise with all thanks in Jesus name
[40:19] amen God bless you and our scripture
[40:24] reads now
[40:28] Samuel was
[40:31] dead and all Israel had mourned for him
[40:36] and buried him in his own town of
[40:43] Rama Saul expelled the mediums and
[40:48] spiritist uh had expelled the mediums
[40:53] and spiritists from the land
[40:57] the Philistines assembled and came and
[41:00] set up a camp at shim while Saul
[41:04] gathered all the Israelites and set up a
[41:07] camp at
[41:09] gilboa when Saul saw the Philistine Army
[41:14] he was
[41:15] afraid Terror filled his heart he
[41:18] inquired of the Lord but the Lord did
[41:21] not answer him by dreams or ur ur
[41:27] or
[41:28] prophets Saul then said to his
[41:32] attendants find me a woman who is a
[41:37] medium that I may go and inquire of
[41:43] her
[41:45] and there is one in
[41:49] Endor they said amen praise the Lord God
[41:53] bless you all please be seated
[42:04] if I seem
[42:06] to um weave bob and weave and move
[42:09] around it's because I'm I just uh uh
[42:15] printed some of the quotes from brother
[42:17] brandham and the rest is just the
[42:19] scribbles in my own handwriting cuz I
[42:22] had a sermon to bring but around close
[42:26] to midnight all of a sudden that went
[42:28] away and then I just had to uh hand
[42:31] write everything here scribble right I
[42:33] should say um I'll be ashamed to show
[42:39] you uh anyway we're glad to be here in
[42:42] the house of God are you happy to be
[42:44] here amen I am too what I want to talk
[42:48] about is something that I didn't think
[42:51] about but I'd like to talk about the
[42:54] spirit of the witch of En or
[42:58] today now uh we
[43:02] realize that everywhere around the world
[43:05] there is a rise in in
[43:09] spiritism how many of us does don't know
[43:11] about
[43:12] psychics I uh on television they were
[43:16] advertising to hire people that will go
[43:20] and work for a certain company as
[43:23] psychics we know that King
[43:27] presidents are seeking psychics and
[43:32] witches um they're searching to know
[43:37] what is happening in the
[43:40] Unseen
[43:42] everywhere there is this
[43:45] stigma that it's okay to be a witch or a
[43:48] wizard but oh my God over in India and
[43:52] China they got Witch
[43:53] Doctors it's no different
[43:56] amen no different they're all the same
[44:00] they all going into that same realm
[44:03] mediums everywhere they're everywhere in
[44:08] the
[44:09] land they're everywhere in the
[44:13] society now why I'm saying that is
[44:15] because when uh the spirit of God caught
[44:19] a hold of me as a child I would say
[44:22] before I come to a full consciousness of
[44:26] what it was at about 14 years old
[44:29] then uh the spirit of God began to move
[44:34] in such an awesome way which we didn't
[44:38] know because we believe that's the way a
[44:40] real Christian ought to be and that's
[44:43] how it was in the Bible and I'm trying
[44:46] to make this as short as possible but
[44:50] with that uh with that uh inner sense
[44:54] and that childlike fa faith in the word
[44:57] of God a Revival broke out in the
[45:00] city and it broke out in so much that
[45:04] they were filling buses and bringing
[45:06] people from other cities and uh I've
[45:10] told you before there's a church there
[45:12] with over 3,000 people now that's it's
[45:15] in Pentecost because I was on the
[45:17] Pentecost at that time and it's still
[45:20] there now the the see what was happening
[45:24] is that we get on a bus and and and
[45:29] Devils will start screaming out uh
[45:32] people will start speaking in tongues
[45:36] getting the Holy Ghost and uh the sick
[45:40] would be healed blind deaf dumb crippled
[45:43] all kinds it was happening because it
[45:47] was the spirit of God and a work of God
[45:51] going for his glory and honor
[45:53] amen and we would be approached by these
[45:57] Wizards and
[45:58] witches several
[46:00] times and we would have to let them know
[46:04] there's a difference between us we want
[46:06] nothing to do with you but they're
[46:08] always like a moth attracted to Flame
[46:12] like insects attracted to light they
[46:15] always were attracted to light all right
[46:18] and they're coming and saying different
[46:21] things and that's the way it was but and
[46:26] then would shake some of their hands and
[46:28] just say Hi how are you oops up in the
[46:31] air down on the ground devil screaming
[46:34] coming out and um in the presence of
[46:37] some of the missionaries from America
[46:40] they were there they saw some of those
[46:42] things and so uh the idea is that devils
[46:47] and demons and witches and wizards are
[46:51] only people that look wearing feathers
[46:56] wearing bones wearing certain colors and
[47:00] they look weird then that's a real witch
[47:05] that's a real wizard no no no not at all
[47:11] I I've seen real principals of
[47:15] universities come in the meeting and the
[47:18] next thing you know we're casting out
[47:19] the devil yeah I was just a young
[47:24] man
[47:29] oh thank you
[47:34] brother that's all
[47:36] right
[47:38] uh you see this uh I'm trying to show
[47:43] you that the devil has gone on the
[47:47] cover right from those days when he was
[47:50] wide open and making himself uh
[47:54] manifested where you could see uh the
[47:57] demons come on a man and he he'd rush
[48:00] over to a a big massive tree and go bang
[48:04] bang bang and a tree would Shake no
[48:08] blood nothing happened then he come to
[48:12] himself and he's just normal now the
[48:16] devil's smart he's cunning he he he
[48:20] moved away from that and mov it into
[48:24] gentility he moved moved it into
[48:26] refinement and into society he moved me
[48:30] to a place of
[48:32] acceptability where we can look and say
[48:34] oh that can't be a devil why you see uh
[48:39] now here comes a great opera singer from
[48:42] England to sing in South America and my
[48:46] thousands of people turn out singing and
[48:49] everything else like that and well he
[48:51] had heard about those meetings and those
[48:53] things so he came and saw myself and
[48:56] brother Patterson uh privately and we
[48:59] talking to him
[49:02] Devils
[49:04] manifest we wouldn't go out and tell the
[49:07] rest of people to embarrass the guy and
[49:10] also to break whatever he's doing
[49:13] because God didn't tell us to do that he
[49:15] just wanted us to know these things hide
[49:19] anywhere and you don't look at a queen a
[49:22] king you don't look at a prime minister
[49:24] a president and just say oh oh no it
[49:26] can't no the devil can work anywhere
[49:31] amen and so uh brother sister I'm
[49:35] letting you know that that you would be
[49:37] aware of it I spoke that some weeks ago
[49:41] how I was just going into a a dollar
[49:44] store and right at the door the guy was
[49:46] there sitting to you know get some coins
[49:50] and next thing you know his eyes start
[49:51] turning over his head he fall to the
[49:53] ground oh my I I I just have to move
[49:56] away quickly right now is it me no but
[50:02] God is doing something and the same like
[50:05] he did when the shadow of those Apostles
[50:08] and the presence of those prophets not
[50:10] saying I'm one of them but the Holy
[50:13] Spirit he is the one that's doing these
[50:16] things and letting us know that he is
[50:20] coming again thank you Jesus he's coming
[50:24] again and this coming that I'm talking
[50:28] about precedes his physical personal
[50:32] coming on the sins but he doesn't just
[50:34] appear it starts coming
[50:37] in the spirit the anointing the presence
[50:41] of the Living God starts coming in and
[50:43] back to the
[50:44] church I believe the spirit of God is
[50:48] coming back to the church in a mighty
[50:51] way I believe that God once again is
[50:56] causing his word to live again which was
[51:00] buried in the ement of the seven Church
[51:02] ages and now by the rising of the Sun by
[51:06] the word of God through God's Prophet
[51:09] the spirit of God is bringing the word
[51:11] of God once again into
[51:14] prominence amen I believe it praise God
[51:19] so uh demons have not become
[51:23] extinct they have not
[51:26] disappeared and if you start to wake
[51:29] yourself up and receive and recognize
[51:32] every believer has a certain element of
[51:35] discernment every believer now you may
[51:38] not have at certain levels it might be
[51:40] just on a lower level but God will give
[51:44] you a certain sense of discernment
[51:46] you're talking with somebody they're
[51:48] fighting with you and then all of a
[51:50] sudden the Holy Spirit say what why are
[51:52] they fighting I haven't said anything I
[51:53] haven't done anything what's that see
[51:56] you'll start to recognize it's Devils
[51:59] recognizing the word in you and the life
[52:03] that is in you and they start fighting
[52:06] against that it's not a personal thing
[52:08] you as the human individual that they're
[52:12] really fighting against but it's the
[52:14] same as the prophet said the greatest
[52:16] battle Lev fought the longest running
[52:19] War it's the same battle going on all
[52:23] the time and we are like no man's land
[52:26] caught in the middle of it amen because
[52:30] you know the devil is trying to get
[52:32] control God has control he's trying to
[52:35] take that away amen but here we
[52:38] understand that battle is going on and
[52:41] we're caught in the middle of it amen
[52:45] yes sir so hidden under the veneer of
[52:49] human
[52:51] society the these demonic powers are
[52:55] still still at work yes oh they're
[52:58] working
[53:00] today and they're wearing beautiful
[53:04] suits lovely
[53:07] dresses magnificent
[53:10] appearance now we won't be going off on
[53:14] these side tangents but you understand
[53:16] the devil was the most beautiful
[53:19] creature that God made at that time the
[53:23] Bible says so he was
[53:26] beautiful uh absolutely Splendid and the
[53:30] and Prophet said it the devil Works
[53:33] through
[53:34] Beauty but God works through faith and
[53:38] his word he works through character it
[53:41] doesn't work by that that has its place
[53:45] but it doesn't work by like that but so
[53:48] so that's how the demon work demons work
[53:50] and they're under this veneer of society
[53:53] they're even try to D dominate you by by
[53:57] by their
[53:58] imposing uh manners and culture and uh
[54:02] ways that they have they'll try to
[54:04] dominate the spirit that is in you and
[54:08] uh they work through bringing the spirit
[54:11] of fear upon people upon Believers if
[54:16] they can get you to become fearful and
[54:19] Afraid then they are going to start
[54:21] having the upper hand not that we are to
[54:24] be a aggressive not that we are be just
[54:27] in humility and in Simplicity know who
[54:31] we are we are certain of God Amen we are
[54:36] conscious of his divine presence and
[54:39] when we walk we walk with him and in Him
[54:43] Praise the Lord and they recognize you
[54:46] and they recognize what is in you praise
[54:49] God and they don't want to deal with
[54:52] that amen they're underneath all this
[54:54] modern f
[54:56] fashion modern fashion is just Satan
[54:59] stripping the
[55:01] people like he did even in the garden
[55:04] they're making the dresses uh you can't
[55:07] even find a good dress in the
[55:09] store you you can't find it anymore
[55:12] because uh he's just leaving it up to
[55:15] the point where the Prophet said they're
[55:17] going to walk the streets in
[55:19] bikinis right he saw in the vision just
[55:22] having a leaf in front of them and
[55:25] that's not he's talking about the women
[55:27] but it's the whole society he's telling
[55:29] you the degression of the entire Society
[55:33] it's going to go down and that's what is
[55:35] we are engaged in right now I'm talking
[55:38] about what's happening right now with
[55:40] the message right praise God hallelujah
[55:43] now so they're operating still in this
[55:46] Mortal realm go read or listen to the
[55:49] message uh seducing Spirits operating in
[55:54] the religion
[55:55] realm and that mainly is what I want to
[55:59] touch on here to show that that same
[56:03] spirit that was on the witch of Ender
[56:08] has now come into the religious realm
[56:13] and it's now working in this
[56:17] message it's working in this message at
[56:21] this particular time like that it's
[56:24] invaded the entire church world and it's
[56:28] right in the message that has backslid
[56:32] like Saul was from the message of the
[56:36] Prophet right now if you will look at
[56:41] the scripture we just read and it came
[56:44] to pass that Samuel was
[56:49] dead the prophet was
[56:51] theread and while the prophet was a li
[56:55] the Bible says that Saul put to death
[56:58] wishes Wizards spirs he put them to
[57:02] death and even passed a law that they
[57:05] should not be allowed to live but after
[57:09] Samuel died the Bible tells us he went
[57:13] to seek the
[57:15] Lord and when he went to seek the Lord
[57:19] he tried to get the Lord to give him a
[57:22] dream and he couldn't get dreams
[57:26] now he went and uh went before various
[57:32] prophets that were there remember
[57:34] there's always a major prophet but
[57:37] beneath there the names never mentioned
[57:40] by a certain man of God a certain
[57:42] Prophet a certain and their names never
[57:44] mentioned Bible but there was a lot of
[57:46] them under that level of that Prophet
[57:50] main Prophet that was there and he went
[57:54] to seek the those other ones and when he
[57:57] talked to them the Bible says God would
[57:59] not speak to him through those prophets
[58:01] neither he would't speak to him no he
[58:04] would't do it yes so why would he do it
[58:07] he wouldn't do it at all and then he
[58:10] said he went to the priest the high
[58:12] priest and trying to get him to get the
[58:17] U and Tom him to reflect the lights of
[58:20] God flashing on it will tell you what to
[58:23] do but the
[58:25] to him would not work no voice was heard
[58:29] no lights came on God didn't reveal
[58:31] himself he forgot he had killed the
[58:34] priest and then now he comes back and
[58:37] he's seeking uh to get the connection
[58:40] through the urum by a priest he forgot
[58:43] about that right so all this was going
[58:46] on so Saul was
[58:49] backslid he was still a Jew he was still
[58:53] in the message he was still a Christian
[58:55] but he was
[58:56] backslid backslid from off of the real
[59:00] true word of God and didn't know really
[59:05] what uh it was and what was really
[59:09] happening at this particular
[59:12] time praise God now let me go to our
[59:18] Prophet
[59:20] speaking when the witch of Endor called
[59:24] called up the spirit of
[59:27] Samuel and Saul looked at
[59:30] him he recognized him to be
[59:35] Samuel and Samuel also recognized Saul
[59:40] for he said why did you call me out of
[59:43] my rest seeing that you become an enemy
[59:45] of God see he's backslid he he wasn't
[59:49] lost but he was backslid he became an
[59:52] enemy of God he was was fighting the
[59:55] will of God he was a rebellious child he
[59:58] would not let the spirit have
[1:00:00] preeminence in his entire life amen now
[1:00:04] when the witch seen him the witch saw
[1:00:09] him and you'll see why I put emphasis on
[1:00:12] that and uh she fell on the ground now
[1:00:17] well Saul said I want to know how is the
[1:00:21] battle going to go Samuel said to him
[1:00:25] tomorrow you'll die in the
[1:00:27] battle you and your sons and by this
[1:00:31] time tomorrow night you are going to be
[1:00:34] here with
[1:00:37] me now I'm saying that because you might
[1:00:40] read some theologians and different
[1:00:43] teachers saying that Saul committed
[1:00:46] suicide and died from suicide we know
[1:00:49] Saul did not commit suicide because it's
[1:00:53] right in the Bible where it says Samuel
[1:00:54] told him you're going to die in the
[1:00:57] battle and you're going to be here with
[1:00:59] me which means to say that even though
[1:01:03] he get killed in the battle even though
[1:01:04] he was backsliding they're going to be
[1:01:06] in Paradise
[1:01:08] together he say you're going to be here
[1:01:10] with me
[1:01:12] tomorrow not next week not after the
[1:01:15] priest prayed for you not after you had
[1:01:18] uh uh all your various prayers and
[1:01:21] candles burning then you're going to be
[1:01:23] with me no when you die you and your

[1:02:50] Born Again experience but we're not
[1:02:53] talking about that we're talking about
[1:02:56] when a true son a true daughter
[1:02:59] recognizes who they really
[1:03:02] are that you wonder through this world
[1:03:05] like another person trying to live like
[1:03:07] a ordinary person like that ordinary
[1:03:10] human being and have the same taste the
[1:03:13] same fashion live the same way enjoy the
[1:03:16] same things but then you recognize

[1:03:35] you are a creature of Eternity you come
[1:03:39] from the presence of almighty God you've
[1:03:42] been confined or imprisoned now in a
[1:03:47] human body but the spirit of God by the
[1:03:50] blood of Christ Hallelujah has come to

[1:03:56] back where you come
[1:03:59] from amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:04:04] amen now we know there are
[1:04:09] dimensions there are secrets he says
[1:04:12] there between me and God but let me tell
[1:04:15] you a little
[1:04:18] bit you Jesus said you are a light that
[1:04:21] sets on a hill amen
[1:04:25] see that's
[1:04:27] Christians they lights you believe that
[1:04:31] amen why you think the Bible calls you
[1:04:33] the morning
[1:04:34] Stars your lights you can't see it I've
[1:04:39] had them come up to me and so what is it
[1:04:41] about you I I see I look at you I see a
[1:04:44] light I'm not saying that to compare
[1:04:47] self with brother brandham I'm trying to
[1:04:48] tell you the truth right exactly I've
[1:04:51] seen a light not over me but I see a
[1:04:54] light in you right and uh and of course
[1:04:58] he goes on and said they sent me to you
[1:05:00] to say I said no you don't tell me what
[1:05:03] they sent you for let me tell you your
[1:05:06] future I have the part to tell you your
[1:05:09] future of course when I start telling
[1:05:10] him he
[1:05:11] runs runs like if uh you know fire is
[1:05:15] after him
[1:05:17] anyway he says Christians in this
[1:05:21] conglomeration of this dimension of
[1:05:25] Mortals oh well going this way you'll go
[1:05:31] downwards the next Dimension is The
[1:05:35] Souls of the unjust who have died not
[1:05:39] knowing god below that is the dimension
[1:05:44] of
[1:05:45] demons and then we find out uh unjust
[1:05:51] Souls demons hell you see there's a
[1:05:55] trinity
[1:05:57] there see oh my think about it mortal
[1:06:02] then are influenced from down there or
[1:06:08] they influenced from up there see there
[1:06:12] it is now what happened with that Witch
[1:06:15] of Endor she BR into the into this
[1:06:21] Dimension see and called up the spirit
[1:06:25] of Samuel in other words her spirit
[1:06:28] broke into that
[1:06:30] Dimension amen where demons the unjust
[1:06:33] dead and stuff like that are and was
[1:06:37] able to call up the spirit of Samuel
[1:06:40] later on I'll explain to you when he
[1:06:42] says Samuel was not yet into the
[1:06:46] heavenlies because all the prophets
[1:06:49] Patriarchs and all them were believing
[1:06:52] unto the coming of the
[1:06:54] Messiah and they were only covered by
[1:06:58] the blood of bulls and goats which was
[1:07:01] not capable of redeeming them and
[1:07:04] bringing them back to God Amen so so
[1:07:08] they they were still there so she could
[1:07:11] break into that realm and call
[1:07:15] Samuel right and she called the spirit
[1:07:19] of Samuel amen praise God it
[1:07:24] some it wasn't somebody impersonating
[1:07:27] Samuel it was Samuel amen praise God now
[1:07:32] Saul went to the prophet he asked and
[1:07:36] and when he went to the prophets he
[1:07:38] didn't see no they didn't see no Visions
[1:07:41] for
[1:07:42] him he went and asked the Lord for a
[1:07:47] dream and the lord gave him no dream you
[1:07:51] see when you in backsliding you in a
[1:07:53] real problem problem say God and
[1:07:55] answered my prayers God this happened
[1:07:58] you know I pray for this and this
[1:07:59] happened and well you don't want to keep
[1:08:02] your relationship with him good you
[1:08:05] don't want to keep in fellowship with
[1:08:07] him right uh you don't want to walk with
[1:08:10] him but yet you're looking for these
[1:08:12] things it doesn't work that way Amen Let
[1:08:16] Me continue see now the prophet he went
[1:08:21] there then to speak to the you uran tum
[1:08:25] him and he killed the priest so the uran
[1:08:30] tum W flash for him it wouldn't flash so
[1:08:35] all he was left
[1:08:37] with brother Brandman said he disguised
[1:08:41] himself themselves and crawled up to go
[1:08:44] see a witch of Endor and saying call me
[1:08:48] the spirit of
[1:08:51] Samuel now think about this man that was
[1:08:55] left over the kingdom he passed the law
[1:08:58] to kill all witches and wizard when the
[1:09:01] prophet was
[1:09:02] alive now the prophet is dead he is
[1:09:06] going on
[1:09:07] Consulting with these same witches and
[1:09:11] wizards a to them to ask wisdom instead
[1:09:16] of getting to go to God so he the spirit
[1:09:19] of can on him now you w't listen to me
[1:09:22] you w't talk to me and
[1:09:24] no I'm going to go and talk to these
[1:09:26] witches and some I'm going to get an
[1:09:28] answer whether you talk to me or not is
[1:09:30] in Rebellion against God he's fighting
[1:09:34] the spirit of the Living God Amen yes
[1:09:38] sir praise God now see that's the way it
[1:09:42] is Saul was not lost for a grain of
[1:09:45] wheat cannot produce nothing else but a
[1:09:47] weat no matter how it behaves amen see
[1:09:51] the man was only backslid did but he was
[1:09:55] not lost right he had only become an
[1:09:58] enemy of God fighting against God but he
[1:10:02] was not lost so can
[1:10:05] you so can
[1:10:07] anybody you fight against God and then
[1:10:10] you get the recompense of it and there
[1:10:13] season in your life when you kind of
[1:10:15] drift away from God and then everything
[1:10:17] seems to be going wrong and this and and
[1:10:20] if you're a Believer you recognize it
[1:10:22] and you kind of back pedal as we
[1:10:25] say you know as if you were always there
[1:10:28] with with him and take your position is
[1:10:32] that right Amen Let the Holy Spirit have
[1:10:35] his way praise God hallelujah you see we
[1:10:40] understand uh to and I'm putting this in
[1:10:42] so you might have this knowledge Saul
[1:10:45] never committed suicide like some of
[1:10:47] them teachers say a Philistine Killed
[1:10:50] him and you know it's in the Bible how
[1:10:52] David killed the Philistine for killing
[1:10:56] the Lord's
[1:10:57] anointed is that right so he did not
[1:11:00] commit suicide but this man was killed
[1:11:04] by David for taking the life of God's
[1:11:08] anointed from him praise God now we were
[1:11:11] just talking about the witch of
[1:11:14] Endor we're talking about how the church
[1:11:17] started to concert with
[1:11:19] her we talking about how some of these
[1:11:23] preachers in type uh starting to seek
[1:11:26] her out and uh uh uh wanting to get
[1:11:30] answers from her because the real
[1:11:34] prophet of the hour is now
[1:11:37] dead they're not seeing all the big
[1:11:41] signs and wonders and miracles and
[1:11:44] they're not hearing the dust say the
[1:11:47] Lord
[1:11:49] anymore they're not seeing all the
[1:11:52] crowds of tens of thousands of
[1:11:56] people and they're not getting all the
[1:11:59] victories like they used to
[1:12:03] have and uh they they tried every
[1:12:07] possible thing and still
[1:12:09] trying they'll try to do it by music
[1:12:13] they'll try to do it by singing they'll
[1:12:15] try to do it by uh camp meetings
[1:12:18] conventions they'll try to do it by this
[1:12:20] or that whatever oh my it doesn't work
[1:12:25] that way the prophet Samuel was dead and
[1:12:30] Samuel and Saul was at a loss to know
[1:12:34] what to do see if he had broke into that
[1:12:37] same spirit that Samuel was in he would
[1:12:40] have known what to do but the spirit of
[1:12:43] God would have let him many of them
[1:12:46] don't realize that when that is the
[1:12:48] spirit that Joshua broke in when Moses
[1:12:51] was here what what happened before Moses
[1:12:54] died the spirit that was on him went and
[1:12:57] uh went there on 70 other men they're
[1:13:00] not even mentioned in the bible but it's
[1:13:02] there the spirit went on 70 other men
[1:13:05] partially not the same way but in little
[1:13:07] pieces pieces like on the day of
[1:13:09] Pentecost the spirit of Christ came down
[1:13:11] on the apostles just little tongues
[1:13:13] little tongues here tongues there praise
[1:13:15] God begin to anoint them now we see my
[1:13:19] friends this is where we're at where now
[1:13:25] uh you can find these quotes I don't
[1:13:27] need to give you that brother brenus
[1:13:29] often time called the Catholic Church a
[1:13:32] witch he says the Catholic church is a
[1:13:36] witch the spirit of this Witch of Endor
[1:13:42] is not just on the Catholic church but
[1:13:46] it's all in the Protestant churches
[1:13:49] right now amen and it's gone even deeper
[1:13:52] the message came and the devil leap over
[1:13:55] there to copycat everything that was
[1:13:59] done by the prophet and that Spirit of
[1:14:02] the witch of Endor is in this message
[1:14:05] here today as I'm standing here and it's
[1:14:09] working amongst the people now notice
[1:14:13] see that Catholic
[1:14:15] Church believes in into communion of
[1:14:20] Saints or in other words tacting dead
[1:14:25] people Same Spirit now am I speak saying
[1:14:29] what is the word Same Spirit contacting
[1:14:33] dead people just like the witch of Endor
[1:14:37] all right and a people who have gone on
[1:14:41] and let me tell you in the name of the
[1:14:44] Lord It's purely
[1:14:48] spiritualism and you say oh the
[1:14:51] Protestant Church don't do that oh right
[1:14:55] they got their own homemade Apostles
[1:14:58] Creed passed down to them from their
[1:15:01] mother believing in the Holy Catholic
[1:15:05] Church believing in the father son Holy
[1:15:08] Ghost right believing in the communion
[1:15:13] of
[1:15:14] saints they they they they repeated they
[1:15:17] say the same thing we believe in the
[1:15:18] communion of saints right like that it's
[1:15:21] all in there
[1:15:23] Apostles Creeds see so right there from
[1:15:28] the Catholic Church they believe in that
[1:15:31] same communion of saints and it brings
[1:15:34] them Protestants right into spiritualism
[1:15:38] like their
[1:15:39] mother it brings them into spiritualism
[1:15:43] like their mother then when they see the
[1:15:45] spirit of God moving in a person they
[1:15:49] want to claim that person to be a devil
[1:15:53] and to put them down see that's what
[1:15:56] they're trying to do amen oh praise God
[1:16:00] forever more let me tell you friends if
[1:16:03] you are interceding with any kind of a
[1:16:07] spirit that's gone on a spirit of
[1:16:10] someone gone on outside of God now and
[1:16:15] he mentioned here I wouldn't give you
[1:16:16] the whole quote but he said he said some
[1:16:18] people sometimes see the spirit of their
[1:16:21] mother or or they'll see their old Daddy
[1:16:24] come
[1:16:25] back or they'll see an uncle or a friend
[1:16:28] or somebody telling them something and a
[1:16:31] few times that devil will speak and the
[1:16:33] thing seems to be
[1:16:35] right and so now they start expecting to
[1:16:38] see their daddy you're expecting and
[1:16:40] that devil now has the control to be
[1:16:42] able to lead them up with
[1:16:45] lies okay see and deceive them now so we
[1:16:51] see if you are ince proing with any kind
[1:16:55] of a spirit like that from someone that
[1:16:58] is gone on outside of God Christ is the
[1:17:03] only mediator between God and
[1:17:07] man then you will find yourself that you
[1:17:12] are in
[1:17:14] spiritualism in
[1:17:17] religion right he says it right here in
[1:17:21] religion spiritualism in
[1:17:23] religion oh God have mercy brother
[1:17:27] sister this is it what's going on now
[1:17:32] now we know the Holy Spirit can fall in
[1:17:34] a group of people they'll speak in
[1:17:36] tongues they'll make it exactly
[1:17:38] everything like that but and see and you
[1:17:41] can then they can
[1:17:44] prophesy and then you can go to a witch
[1:17:47] or a medium or something like the witch
[1:17:51] of Endor see
[1:17:53] and many times they will say things that
[1:17:56] will be exactly
[1:18:00] true do you know
[1:18:02] that he says they can say things that
[1:18:05] will be exactly true right we won't go
[1:18:09] to tell you the times like the woman
[1:18:10] came and say you you're not ordinary you
[1:18:14] you got a gift you come God you're sent
[1:18:16] from God you and she was telling him
[1:18:18] exactly the truth he says but he didn't
[1:18:20] listen to her cuz somewhere the line
[1:18:23] that thing is going to swerve and gone
[1:18:25] into a lie so you didn't want to listen
[1:18:27] in the first place and put it away right
[1:18:30] now so you see then that the Witch and
[1:18:34] that Spirit of that Witch of Endor it
[1:18:37] could be exactly true but still it isn't
[1:18:41] there are witches speaking in tongues
[1:18:44] I've seen Devils speak in tongues youve
[1:18:47] heard me tell you about that right or my
[1:18:50] own uh schoolmate we praying for what
[1:18:53] praying and praying for him and next
[1:18:55] thing you know he's speaking in fluent
[1:18:57] towns and he became a diplomat and a
[1:19:00] linguist for the foreign Ministry and
[1:19:02] all that brilliant but it was
[1:19:05] Devils right gave him that ability to do
[1:19:08] that right so there it goes that don't
[1:19:12] mean anything but the real thing is the
[1:19:15] word of God you must take everything
[1:19:18] back to the word amen amen you can do
[1:19:23] some of these things without the word
[1:19:26] but when you get to the word it doesn't
[1:19:31] and it begins doing it then watch it
[1:19:34] exactly come to pass exactly the right
[1:19:37] way and the right thing see see but God
[1:19:41] himself chooses people and uses them as
[1:19:46] he has appointed them for his own Divine
[1:19:51] wisdom you believe that
[1:19:53] am do you know in another quotation you
[1:19:56] can search it where he says do you know
[1:19:59] the gift that them witches and wizards
[1:20:01] have is almost like the same thing that
[1:20:04] I have but they have surrendered that
[1:20:08] over to the
[1:20:09] devil they hand it and they put it to
[1:20:12] the devil but this life is surrendered
[1:20:16] over to God and God uses it for his for
[1:20:19] his glory and for his honor now you can
[1:20:23] go off and start to see why he tells you
[1:20:25] in Pentecost not that speaking in
[1:20:28] tongues is
[1:20:29] unscriptural but don't accept that as
[1:20:32] the infallible evidence of the Holy
[1:20:36] Ghost because the devil is in a state of
[1:20:39] infiltration subversion and he is
[1:20:43] working he is working in that way yes
[1:20:46] sir and they can speak in fluent
[1:20:48] wonderful tongues and everything else
[1:20:51] and the next thing you know when they're
[1:20:52] on covered which I've seen it they
[1:20:54] switch from Tong to
[1:20:57] cursing wow they switch from Tong to
[1:21:00] lying right my goodness my friends some
[1:21:05] of you are old enough that has been with
[1:21:07] me for many years you have seen it a
[1:21:08] devil fall on the ground and the person
[1:21:11] is moving like a
[1:21:13] snake in the middle of the church like
[1:21:15] that there is not imagination it happens
[1:21:18] now this is the day that we're living in
[1:21:22] amen it's not about me no no not Big
[1:21:27] Miracle Mira no no no you want to hide
[1:21:29] you want to live a hidden life let the
[1:21:31] spirit of God receive the glory let him
[1:21:34] manifest let him show forth his presence
[1:21:36] and his power by this word because it's
[1:21:39] the word that does it all amen the devil
[1:21:42] don't want to tangle with the word amen
[1:21:44] but you start thinking of yourself as
[1:21:46] something that don't mean nothing to him
[1:21:49] yes sir amen now he says
[1:21:53] there you know there was this great
[1:21:56] woman medium in the readers's digest see
[1:22:01] they gave they took her over to Egypt
[1:22:06] there and brought some French men down
[1:22:11] and he asked her to call for a certain
[1:22:15] person and she actually pulled up that
[1:22:19] dead
[1:22:21] person and the tone of her voice
[1:22:25] changed she began to talk with the same
[1:22:29] voice like that dead person had right
[1:22:35] and everything like the dead person did
[1:22:40] how they acted and went on and but you
[1:22:44] see that was that and so brother Bram is
[1:22:49] saying there are some of these people
[1:22:51] are still out there that can do do these
[1:22:53] things and it's real what they're doing
[1:22:55] it is not of God but it's real you can't
[1:22:58] deny it it's out there okay he says but
[1:23:01] do you know even in their realm there is
[1:23:05] a lot of
[1:23:07] bogus lot of make belief
[1:23:10] mediums spiritualists and psychics make
[1:23:14] believe why he said and look what it is
[1:23:18] the Bible teaches such someone said to
[1:23:21] me brother Bram do you believe that yes
[1:23:23] I
[1:23:24] do yes sir the Bible teaches that there
[1:23:28] is such things like the witch of Endor
[1:23:32] it is a devil let me tell you it is a
[1:23:35] devil you believe that it is a devil but
[1:23:39] she's got to have a lot of
[1:23:44] impersonators oh my think of it they the
[1:23:48] police caught some of them the other day
[1:23:51] where's a great
[1:23:53] judge supposedly gone to the Seance and
[1:23:56] felt the touch of his ghostly mother's
[1:24:01] hands upon him and the next morning when
[1:24:06] the police investigated they found it
[1:24:09] was a fake piece of cheese
[1:24:13] cloth used to brush against his hand
[1:24:17] causing to believe it was the soft and
[1:24:19] tender hands of his loving dead
[1:24:24] mother you see he didn't touch her hand

[1:25:10] it I'm just telling you so you know what
[1:25:13] to avoid and walk away from right oh
[1:25:17] praise God yes sir so there it is it's
[1:25:21] moneymaking schemes trying to
[1:25:23] impersonate the real
[1:25:27] spiritualists that are out there so they
[1:25:30] have that but over here we have on this
[1:25:34] side they are now trying to impersonate
[1:25:39] a real
[1:25:40] Christian amen by becoming make
[1:25:44] Believers and not real Believers trying
[1:25:48] to impersonate the spirit of the Living
[1:25:51] God hallelujah amen do you believe this
[1:25:55] thank you Jesus amen I know the regular
[1:25:59] preacher doesn't preach on these things
[1:26:01] and talk along these lines but let me
[1:26:04] tell you even even if I'm not around
[1:26:07] later on it's going to come up just the
[1:26:09] same way when I first preached many
[1:26:12] years ago that you know when it says
[1:26:15] there in page seven of of uh the uh
[1:26:18] stature of a perfect man that man the
[1:26:21] seal he says come to a close and now
[1:26:25] that man that woman that will be in the
[1:26:27] Eternal Church age that will begin after
[1:26:30] the seals oh you were crazy you're mad
[1:26:34] you're this you're that but now they're
[1:26:36] all preaching it they're all preaching
[1:26:39] it they're all jumping at it anyway uh
[1:26:42] praise God now you see that's the devil
[1:26:46] and I want you to know that uh even
[1:26:50] preachers have called me a spiritual
[1:26:53] and I've read a few books where they
[1:26:54] call him that call him an occultist and
[1:26:57] everything else like that he said but
[1:26:59] that's what always happens when Jesus
[1:27:01] himself was here they called him be
[1:27:03] elub see because he told Nathaniel on
[1:27:07] the three under that before you were
[1:27:10] under that Victory I saw you right they
[1:27:13] call him a a spiritualist and everything
[1:27:15] else because you see there's a lot of
[1:27:19] devil Powers working against
[1:27:22] what he was doing just that which of
[1:27:25] Endor Spirit see there wasn't spiritual
[1:27:29] and some of these preaches are not
[1:27:31] spiritual enough to discern between
[1:27:33] right and wrong the spirit of God and
[1:27:35] the spirit of the devil and that is the
[1:27:39] way it is
[1:27:42] today and that is why it said the spirit
[1:27:44] of the witch of Endor
[1:27:47] today right oh my now Jesus said says
[1:27:52] it's not only that way but he you call
[1:27:56] me Master of the House of beab how much
[1:27:59] more are they going to call you you see
[1:28:03] now he's talking about the end of the
[1:28:07] world he's talking about this time now
[1:28:10] where after he's gone towards the end
[1:28:13] that they're going to start calling you
[1:28:14] the same thing because when the spirit
[1:28:17] of God start making itself manifest
[1:28:19] through you amen I'm not talking about
[1:28:22] me I'm saying the least of you sitting
[1:28:25] down here today if you keep faithful to
[1:28:28] God the same music that was back there
[1:28:31] acts to acts working and sounding
[1:28:35] through the lives of the Apostles can't
[1:28:38] you hear it that same music he heard
[1:28:42] when he saw them churches marching once
[1:28:45] again that music is coming
[1:28:48] again the great Symphony the great
[1:28:51] director directing that music the music
[1:28:54] is coming again I can hear it amen I
[1:28:59] don't know about you but I'm hearing it
[1:29:01] praise the lord it's coming again
[1:29:03] brother sister and we're not walking to
[1:29:06] the edge of a cliff to go down we are
[1:29:08] going up with the first resurrection
[1:29:11] we're going up under this inspiration of
[1:29:14] this message of this day praise God
[1:29:16] hallelujah amen praise God glory to God
[1:29:20] now let me bring to you what I am trying
[1:29:24] to tell you here this application praise
[1:29:28] God hallelujah amen the application I'm
[1:29:32] bringing to you is that same Catholic
[1:29:34] church with that same Spirit of a witch
[1:29:37] right burning of incense burning of all
[1:29:40] kinds of smells you go into uh some of
[1:29:44] these Cathedrals and you almost
[1:29:47] drunk I've gone we gone to Israel and
[1:29:50] some of the sisters come out there there
[1:29:52] and they can't hardly walk because the
[1:29:54] incense got them staggering they they
[1:29:58] their head just filled with the smoke
[1:30:00] and the smells of the incense and uh
[1:30:03] they
[1:30:04] craftily uh they
[1:30:07] craftily uh uh F fashion the entire um
[1:30:14] Services if I will call it that right
[1:30:18] with the sounds of
[1:30:20] bells
[1:30:23] it's the five senses that's another
[1:30:25] service but they're appealing to the
[1:30:28] five senses heightened five senses
[1:30:31] because that's what the incense does is
[1:30:33] heightens your your your your senses and
[1:30:37] deadens other senses and then the The
[1:30:41] Sounds catches your auditory uh
[1:30:46] abilities and then the colors they
[1:30:50] they're really into various colors that
[1:30:53] are out there like Jacob with the colors
[1:30:57] there how it changed the shape they're
[1:30:59] using the same kinds of strategies
[1:31:01] that's why they always have all kinds of
[1:31:03] colored things on their walls and glass
[1:31:05] windows and whatnot like that now we see
[1:31:08] that this is in effect right now and
[1:31:11] people are unaware they're absolutely
[1:31:14] blind to it oh it's beautiful oh it's
[1:31:17] lovely you think you had a service
[1:31:19] that's not a service you think that's a
[1:31:21] church that's a Barn what we have here
[1:31:23] is a cathedral it's it's beautiful look
[1:31:26] at the artistic structure look at this
[1:31:28] and that it's and it's wonderful I love
[1:31:30] to go visit them see them I love to go
[1:31:32] to those things and tour them and
[1:31:34] everything else like that but friends we
[1:31:37] find out that the message has now come
[1:31:40] to a state where brother brandham is
[1:31:43] dead how many knows that he's dead you
[1:31:46] said well why would you ask that because
[1:31:47] there are some people that believe he's
[1:31:49] still not
[1:31:50] dead
[1:31:53] and the spirit of the witch of Endor is
[1:31:57] now on some people that are going and
[1:32:00] calling for the prophet to come back
[1:32:02] from the
[1:32:04] dead they're calling for him to come up
[1:32:09] so they can ask him some of their
[1:32:11] questions and
[1:32:14] answers once again they want to see
[1:32:18] these Mighty miracles of how they can
[1:32:20] have victory in in certain
[1:32:24] meetings and uh claiming making all
[1:32:28] manner of claims absolutely in that way
[1:32:32] yes sir praise God let me tell you
[1:32:35] friends it's simple without this
[1:32:38] revelation of the word any church any
[1:32:44] group any preacher that doesn't have an
[1:32:48] inkling of the revelation of the word
[1:32:52] amen yes sir is absolutely caught in
[1:32:57] witchcraft they're under the Dominion of
[1:33:00] this Same Spirit you know there are
[1:33:03] principalities Powers dominions that
[1:33:06] control cities control neighborhoods
[1:33:09] control men control a home control
[1:33:12] Nations why the prophet said we are not
[1:33:17] Americans if you realize where you're
[1:33:19] born from where you're really born from
[1:33:21] where you come from my flesh come from
[1:33:24] South America but me the person that
[1:33:27] here I come from God and I'm going back
[1:33:29] to God Amen I'm set free by the spirit
[1:33:33] of almighty God recognize who you are
[1:33:36] and who God is amen yes sir praise God
[1:33:40] he says my I am not just the child of
[1:33:43] Charles and Ella branam oh my father
[1:33:47] Jehovah God hallelujah I come from you
[1:33:50] praise God that that's what all of us
[1:33:52] have got to
[1:33:53] recognize amen that we are we are the
[1:33:58] real
[1:34:02] EES and we didn't come from some alien
[1:34:05] planet in outer space but uh we are
[1:34:09] already as Paul said we are strangers
[1:34:12] pilgrims and Aliens it's in your Bible
[1:34:15] you you don't notice those things but
[1:34:18] it's right there Paul said we are aliens
[1:34:20] to them they
[1:34:22] you right they won't call you a martian
[1:34:24] but they'll they'll just look at you and
[1:34:26] say
[1:34:28] mhm yeah I see just like the lawyer told
[1:34:32] me when he says well how did that happen
[1:34:35] I said well it's God he says yes
[1:34:38] God see see that's how they look at it
[1:34:42] you you you just use God as an excuse to
[1:34:44] get out of a certain situation amen so
[1:34:48] right
[1:34:50] now you you must know there are
[1:34:53] believers that go and they pray at
[1:34:57] brother bram's grave in jonville
[1:35:01] Indiana do you know
[1:35:04] that and when they go praying by the
[1:35:08] grave of brother Braham some of them
[1:35:11] lights or sometimes and next when take a
[1:35:14] picture and there's like a white
[1:35:16] dove and there you know all these things
[1:35:19] and it looks upon a spiritual is it
[1:35:22] makes it no difference than them going
[1:35:24] to Lords and seeing a vision of
[1:35:28] Mary they're starting to set up shrines
[1:35:31] to the prophet they don't call it a
[1:35:33] shrine you understand but that's what it
[1:35:36] is they expect if they go back to
[1:35:40] Arizona on Sunset Mountain to that big
[1:35:42] rock where uh the prophet was and the
[1:35:45] angel came down there they might see
[1:35:49] something they believe if they find find
[1:35:51] the cave and I know preachers that that
[1:35:54] that that that spent thousands and
[1:35:57] thousands of dollars to find the
[1:36:00] cave that brother Bram used to go
[1:36:02] praying
[1:36:03] secretly and all these things and then
[1:36:06] they make that place like a holy
[1:36:09] place it's a sacred place because the
[1:36:12] prophet prayed here or did this or did
[1:36:14] that oh my brother sister amen do you
[1:36:19] know they've gone so far
[1:36:23] that uh go back to when Prophet saw the
[1:36:26] vision of that
[1:36:28] Serpent and when he should have cut off
[1:36:30] the head of it completely he didn't and
[1:36:33] he realized that now this this belief
[1:36:36] that he could be maybe the Messiah or
[1:36:40] that he was Christ and then he said no
[1:36:43] no no you're making me an antichrist by
[1:36:45] calling me that or by thinking of me
[1:36:48] like that amen and that same Spirit
[1:36:52] after he died that same Spirit has been
[1:36:55] coming on people right down to this time
[1:36:59] is that right
[1:37:01] until you know that there are some
[1:37:04] others that are praying in his
[1:37:08] name how many of you know that there are
[1:37:12] few people that have are well aware of
[1:37:14] it it's not just me saying it here
[1:37:17] people are using Brother bram's name to
[1:37:19] pray instead of of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:24] Christ just stop to think about it and
[1:37:27] then we find out some of them are not
[1:37:31] only uh uh praying in his name they're
[1:37:35] baptizing in his
[1:37:37] name they're baptizing in his
[1:37:40] name because he is the present tense
[1:37:44] Jesus Christ back there when the spirit
[1:37:46] of God was back there was in a man named
[1:37:49] Jesus that's why they baptized in his
[1:37:51] name now it is in a man name Branham so
[1:37:54] we baptize in his name right that's how
[1:37:57] they look at it now you've got to know
[1:38:00] and hear these things so that you are
[1:38:03] fortified thank youus because people are
[1:38:05] going to come up and throw some of the
[1:38:07] stuff in your face but you already been
[1:38:09] forewarned you been fortified by the
[1:38:12] word and you were able to meet the devil
[1:38:14] and pull the sword and be able to chop
[1:38:16] his head off is that
[1:38:18] right is that right I said chop his head
[1:38:22] off praise God hallelujah amen praise
[1:38:26] God yes sir they're praying in his name
[1:38:29] they're baptizing in his name and they
[1:38:33] are waiting to him to come back from the
[1:38:37] dead they're just waiting for his
[1:38:39] appearance like this Witch of Endor
[1:38:41] they're waiting for his appearance for
[1:38:43] him to come back from the dead they
[1:38:45] wanted Samuel to come back from the dead
[1:38:47] now they're waiting for this Prophet to
[1:38:49] come back from the dead de and then
[1:38:52] they're going to use
[1:38:53] quotations to prove that he's going to
[1:38:56] come back from the dead I prove to you
[1:38:59] from the word of
[1:39:01] God I prove from you the quotes that he
[1:39:04] coming back from the dead they say
[1:39:07] remember when the prophet
[1:39:09] spoke about the 10th
[1:39:12] vision and he spoke about preaching in
[1:39:15] the tent and in the and when he said
[1:39:19] other words like I'll ride the Trail
[1:39:21] once
[1:39:22] more and he tell them I'm just resting
[1:39:26] but if you wait then I'll be you see
[1:39:29] they did not understand that the tent
[1:39:31] was only a symbol of the entire
[1:39:35] message right that's what he was
[1:39:38] speaking to in those days was a lot of
[1:39:41] people but it's not a lot of those
[1:39:44] thousands even got a revelation of what
[1:39:46] he was talking about but he could
[1:39:48] foresee that the tent
[1:39:52] of the message will be so
[1:39:55] wide and if we were to speak one day on
[1:39:58] the T Vision you'll see he said so when
[1:40:01] he continue preaching and preaching as
[1:40:03] his preaching went on went on he says
[1:40:07] most of them that were following and
[1:40:09] listening to him he said they went away
[1:40:12] searching for
[1:40:15] biscuits looking for biscuits and
[1:40:19] crackers and the others stayed right
[1:40:22] there while it's bringing the word of
[1:40:24] God I believe you amongst that
[1:40:27] family
[1:40:30] Hallelujah many that start running
[1:40:34] together with us in this race
[1:40:37] many but where are they
[1:40:40] now where are they now but you see we
[1:40:43] don't contr we don't control where God
[1:40:45] plants a seed where God doesn't plant a
[1:40:48] seed where a person is backslid where
[1:40:50] they're not really saved that's not for
[1:40:52] us we don't have nothing to do with that
[1:40:55] all we know is that they wandered away
[1:40:58] from the word of God Amen and this is
[1:41:02] where we're at now they're waiting for
[1:41:04] him to come back from the dead and to
[1:41:06] come back and preach in the tent but
[1:41:10] he's preaching in the tent but they
[1:41:12] don't understand that he's preaching in
[1:41:15] the tent it's not brother William
[1:41:18] brandham preaching in the tent it's the
[1:41:20] holy ghost preaching through William
[1:41:22] brandham that is preaching in the tent
[1:41:25] it's the voice of the sign amen it's the
[1:41:29] great voice of the Living God hallelujah
[1:41:32] that voice has now become
[1:41:35] voices and those voices are the
[1:41:38] Thundering Waters amen which The Sinner
[1:41:42] which the unbeliever can't recognize
[1:41:45] it's the voice of God in these last days
[1:41:48] and it's working through the Believers
[1:41:50] through the individuals God hiding again
[1:41:53] in Simplicity is that right I'm just
[1:41:55] getting emotional praise the Lord but
[1:41:58] God's hid in Simplicity really for the
[1:42:01] spirit of God to work it doesn't matter
[1:42:03] if the man shouts whether he speaks loud
[1:42:05] uh you don't judge the person by their
[1:42:08] way of of how they express the spirit of
[1:42:12] God through them because God works in
[1:42:14] his own way sometimes he deliberately
[1:42:16] does things to drive your
[1:42:19] away God sometimes God i' I've seen it
[1:42:23] happen in my own life I'm preaching I'm
[1:42:25] preaching and in the middle of preaching
[1:42:26] I turn around and said they know the
[1:42:27] Lord and I say something and I'm
[1:42:30] pointing to the person and they leave in
[1:42:33] a huff because I knew something and I go
[1:42:35] and tell them in front of all the
[1:42:42] people get up from there pews there and
[1:42:48] my here with this kind of thing going on
[1:42:51] I said brother you you say you want the
[1:42:54] spirit of God and when the spirit of God
[1:42:56] really begins to move you say it's not
[1:42:58] the spirit of God you know oh my one
[1:43:02] preacher came by he says
[1:43:04] brother you better pray to God that you
[1:43:09] all have the spirit of God come in this
[1:43:11] church you need the spirit of God
[1:43:14] working in the people all in the
[1:43:17] spirit came comes back another time he
[1:43:20] says oh my God he says the spirit of God
[1:43:24] is so much in this church but brother I
[1:43:26] got to tell you you don't have the real
[1:43:29] deep teaching of the
[1:43:33] word now I said brother make up your
[1:43:36] mind we just have the Deep we have the
[1:43:38] teaching of the word or do we have the
[1:43:41] spirit of God Amen he doesn't know what
[1:43:44] to do with himself because that's the
[1:43:46] way God works the wind blows where list
[1:43:49] today it's just a soft Breeze tomorrow
[1:43:52] it's a storm the next day it's something
[1:43:54] else no there's no one way God has his
[1:43:57] own choosing in his own way
[1:44:00] work amen I can't be brother Tim brother
[1:44:04] Tim can't be me I can't be brother Danny
[1:44:07] I can't be brother Desmond and who can
[1:44:10] be like brother
[1:44:12] coffee oh my God I'm Ministry of its own
[1:44:16] praise the Lord hallelujah praise God
[1:44:19] what I'm saying you every every one is
[1:44:21] original everyone is what God made them
[1:44:24] and how God choose to use them for his
[1:44:26] glory and honor amen praise the Lord so
[1:44:29] I want you to see anyway I'm placing the
[1:44:32] spirit of Endor and letting you know
[1:44:34] it's right here in the message I'm going
[1:44:35] to be winding this up now praise God
[1:44:38] because made the point amen now they
[1:44:41] come back and in the spirit we find out
[1:44:45] they want brother Bram to raise up from
[1:44:47] the
[1:44:48] dead and to come back
[1:44:51] like that you know that's a
[1:44:53] deception do you remember brother bradam
[1:44:56] he says watch it remember when Martin
[1:45:00] was
[1:45:02] here and uh Martin was in
[1:45:06] prayer and suddenly right before him
[1:45:10] stands the Lord Jesus
[1:45:13] Christ he says do you know how many
[1:45:15] people would be deceived by
[1:45:18] that in this hour
[1:45:21] he says but Martin thoughts on the word
[1:45:25] and being a part of the word he look at
[1:45:27] this person standing before him he
[1:45:29] notice he doesn't have any
[1:45:31] Crown he notice the way he's talking and
[1:45:34] he says you claim to be Jesus Christ and
[1:45:38] ask me to Bow Down and Worship You why
[1:45:40] should I do that the scripture says we
[1:45:43] will worship we will crown him at the
[1:45:46] end of these ages and you already have a
[1:45:49] crown on your head
[1:45:51] all of a
[1:45:52] sudden it's gone
[1:45:55] disappeared why it was the devil with an
[1:45:58] impersonation all right so so now we see
[1:46:02] that same Spirit of the devil is coming
[1:46:04] to that place where they're you're going
[1:46:07] to hear them start talking about it
[1:46:08] they're starting to see this and they're
[1:46:10] starting to see that because they've
[1:46:13] entered
[1:46:14] into
[1:46:17] wishcraft what they're going to get what
[1:46:20] they're wishing for right so now uh they
[1:46:26] wish to see the Prophet come back you
[1:46:28] wish to see it oh the devil can provide
[1:46:30] you with that kind of a thing too if you
[1:46:32] want to see that amen my goodness you
[1:46:35] might even see him walking in some of
[1:46:37] their
[1:46:38] meetings my that would be a real
[1:46:41] sensation even a prophet endorsing me oh
[1:46:44] my they seen the prophet in that
[1:46:47] brother's meeting absolutely yeah but
[1:46:51] you watch carefully and let the Holy
[1:46:53] Spirit give you some discernment by the
[1:46:55] word of God amen amen yes sir and there
[1:47:00] are many that are encouraging people to
[1:47:02] go this
[1:47:04] way right they're encouraging people to
[1:47:07] actually get into that stuff where they
[1:47:10] worship the prophet where they baptizing
[1:47:13] his name where they pray in his name and
[1:47:16] and they hold brother brandham almost
[1:47:20] not almost in many cases higher than
[1:47:22] they hold the Lord Jesus that's true
[1:47:25] absolutely many of them do that right
[1:47:29] praise God devil says devil will turn to
[1:47:32] your mind now and says see you in a
[1:47:35] cult this messages because that's what
[1:47:37] he's trying to do he wants to mess up
[1:47:39] the message the real message but the
[1:47:43] real believer that's why the prophet
[1:47:44] said when you get the real Revelation no
[1:47:47] matter what the devil throws what muck
[1:47:49] what mud what unbelief whatever you are
[1:47:52] going right down the center with that
[1:47:55] back sight lined up with the front sight
[1:47:58] amen and you're hit the target every
[1:48:01] time for the glory of God Old Testament
[1:48:04] New Testament the words of sermon as a
[1:48:06] prophet and Bible backs it up praise God
[1:48:10] you're right on target with the word of
[1:48:12] God hallelujah amen yes sir praise God
[1:48:16] hallelujah so let's let let's pray for
[1:48:19] these kind of people right when you meet
[1:48:23] them don't let that discourage you but
[1:48:26] recognize the word already identified
[1:48:28] that they're going to be here all kinds
[1:48:30] of people's going to be inside of it
[1:48:32] you're going to meet all kinds of things
[1:48:34] you're going to hear all kinds of things
[1:48:36] but is you see most people don't
[1:48:39] understand that God is not watching so
[1:48:42] much what the other person did to you
[1:48:46] what the other person said or how they
[1:48:49] said it God is sitting back and watching
[1:48:52] your reaction amen Prophet said action
[1:48:55] for reaction is that right he said
[1:48:58] they're going to pay Prophet said
[1:49:00] they're going to pay for what they did
[1:49:02] but you better watch right watch how you
[1:49:06] act what you say Amen praise God so
[1:49:09] let's pray for them right amen that's
[1:49:11] always the answer is best to pray don't
[1:49:13] say
[1:49:15] pray right praise God now if you notice
[1:49:18] I'm ending this now if you not notice
[1:49:20] that woman was not punished because Saul
[1:49:24] had had a law saying any witch she
[1:49:28] should be
[1:49:29] killed right but in this case the woman
[1:49:33] was not killed we don't know her story
[1:49:37] we don't know if later on she now come
[1:49:40] to believe yes there is a real prophet
[1:49:45] and uh this is different than what is
[1:49:48] happened with me and now this is a real
[1:49:50] prophet and commit her life to God we
[1:49:53] don't know but clearly praise the Lord
[1:49:56] Jesus
[1:49:58] amen amen
[1:50:01] hallelujah
[1:50:07] my and let me let me just quote
[1:50:10] here this woman was not punished for
[1:50:13] being doing the work of a witch because
[1:50:15] she was deceived by the preacher Saul
[1:50:22] right she was deceived by the preacher
[1:50:25] Saul who told her like the serpent told
[1:50:29] Eve you shall not surely die that same
[1:50:34] Spirit of Deceit came down and work with
[1:50:37] her now you say why did you preach this
[1:50:39] sermon uh here today uh brother Simon
[1:50:43] why did you speak on this amen I I spoke
[1:50:47] on it to show how that Spirit has now
[1:50:50] invaded the
[1:50:52] message we know it's invaded the church
[1:50:54] world and everything else but I'm
[1:50:56] particularly focused it's invaded this
[1:50:59] message and you are supposed to watch
[1:51:01] for it right amen recognize it whether
[1:51:04] it's in sermons you see on the internet
[1:51:07] or your voices you hear uh coming from
[1:51:11] great uh leaders in the in the message
[1:51:14] soal you just always test everything by
[1:51:18] the word don't just say oh this brother
[1:51:21] has a big reputation in the message and
[1:51:23] you just swallow every message that he
[1:51:24] preached no doesn't work that way
[1:51:27] individually you got to taste and see
[1:51:30] right for yourself in every way God
[1:51:32] bless them all in the great work they're
[1:51:35] doing and everything else that spirit is
[1:51:37] now in the message and most of the times
[1:51:41] you find that a lot of the preachers are
[1:51:43] scrambling now to manufacture something
[1:51:46] because the prophet isn't here now to
[1:51:48] give them revelation
[1:51:50] he's not to give them musicians you can
[1:51:52] come
[1:51:54] along he's not here to give them
[1:51:57] inspiration and we all got inspiration
[1:51:59] off of his message and still are getting
[1:52:01] inspiration off of his messages but once
[1:52:04] you start getting a direct communication
[1:52:08] between you and God something goes on
[1:52:11] that's totally different it it it comes
[1:52:14] with direct communication that brings
[1:52:16] you back and show you this is what he
[1:52:18] was thinking about when he was preaching
[1:52:20] this message this is what he he was
[1:52:22] going to say you sometimes you know it
[1:52:25] before you even read it right because
[1:52:28] the holy spirit is now here revealing
[1:52:30] his word to his own people praise the
[1:52:32] name of the Lord hallelujah it's
[1:52:35] wonderful isn't it thank you it's always
[1:52:37] nice to come and talk with you because
[1:52:39] you are willing to hear this I don't
[1:52:41] want to be beaten
[1:52:43] up yeah because there places I've been
[1:52:46] where people even the preacher gets so
[1:52:48] mad just crawling across the pews
[1:52:50] running down the aisle
[1:52:52] to bring down the hammer and everything
[1:52:55] else like that and the spirit of God has
[1:52:58] to step in so God is God and it's not
[1:53:02] easy especially when sometimes God uses
[1:53:05] you to say things that have not been
[1:53:08] said have not yet been said and they
[1:53:13] don't want to see it or believe it and
[1:53:15] then when they do believe it they s
[1:53:17] burst in asham they wouldn't come back
[1:53:18] and say brother you were right
[1:53:20] they just go out and they preach it and
[1:53:22] like as if they always had that none of
[1:53:25] us have anything anyway cuz I don't have
[1:53:28] no particular Revelation It All Belongs
[1:53:30] to him am it's only when you come to
[1:53:33] Mortal realm people want to patent this
[1:53:35] and patent that put their name on it and
[1:53:38] they didn't make
[1:53:39] anything because I mean they just sit
[1:53:42] there and all of a sudden they get an
[1:53:43] idea they don't even ask where it come
[1:53:45] from and then they draw and put it out
[1:53:48] there oh I I invented this this yeah
[1:53:50] right see so pray praise God I'm going
[1:53:53] to stop now because now um if I continue
[1:53:58] talking like that I go off into all
[1:53:59] kinds of things that's no more in the
[1:54:01] message praise God then you're going to
[1:54:03] say oh yeah I see he's getting old now
[1:54:05] so he's drifting off God bless you all
