[1:08] Hey.
[1:13] [Music]
[1:19] There's a
[1:21] ligh on the hill
[1:24] side that
[1:27] overlooks life
[1:29] se when I'm
[1:32] tossed it s of
[1:36] love that I might
[1:40] see and the light that shines in the
[1:44] dark this night will safely ly lead
[1:51] boy. If it wasn't for
[1:56] life, the ship will sing the
[2:03] world and I'll take
[2:06] all the light up.
[2:11] I owe my life to
[2:15] you. For Jesus is the light
[2:20] of And from the front of
[2:25] sea. He has shown his light all around
[2:30] me. Around
[2:33] us says this
[2:38] light. The big ships don't sail this way
[2:43] anymore. There's no use of it. Standing
[2:47] around and my mind goes back to that

[3:31] sin. He has shown a light all around
[3:36] me that I can clearly see.
[3:42] If it
[3:43] wasn't for the
[3:47] lighthouse, tell me where would
[3:50] this be? And if it
[3:55] wasn't for the
[3:59] lighthouse, tell me where would they
[4:06] share? Hallelujah. How many thankful for
[4:09] the lighthouse?

[22:23] you. So, we're going to start verse
[22:26] four.
[22:30] whereby whereby I give whereby
[22:34] I
[22:37] whereby I given unto you unto whereby I
[22:41] given unto us exceedingly great and
[22:43] precious
[22:45] promises that by this ye might be
[22:48] partakers of the divine nature having
[22:51] escaped the
[22:54] corruption that is in the world through
[22:58] last. But beside
[23:02] this, by beside this, giving all
[23:06] diligence, add to your faith
[23:11] virtue, and
[23:13] to virtue,
[23:16] nourish, and to nourish temperance. And
[23:20] to temperance, patience, and to
[23:23] patience,
[23:25] godliness, and to godliness, brotherly
[23:28] kindness, and to brother kindness
[23:34] charity. For if these things be in you
[23:38] and
[23:39] abound, they make you that ye shall
[23:42] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[23:46] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[23:49] But he that lackth these things is blind
[23:54] and cannot see a far off and had
[23:58] forgotten that he was perished from his
[24:01] old sins.
[24:04] Wherefore the wherefore the rather
[24:09] brethren giving diligence to make your
[24:11] calling an election
[24:14] sure for if ye do these things ye shall
[24:18] never
[24:20] fall. Let's jump to 16 to 21.
[24:27] For we have not
[24:30] followed
[24:32] kindly devised fables when we made known
[24:36] unto you the power
[24:38] and and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[24:43] But were I by were eyewitness of his
[24:48] majesty. For he received for he received
[24:52] from God the Father honor and glory.
[24:56] When there when there came such a voice
[25:00] to him from the excellent
[25:03] glory, this is my beloved son in whom I
[25:07] am pleased where I whom in whom I am
[25:11] well
[25:13] pleased. And this and this voice which
[25:16] came from
[25:19] heaven we heard. And this voice which
[25:22] came from heaven we heard.
[25:26] when we were with him in the holy
[25:29] mount. We have also we have also a more
[25:34] sure word of prophecy where unto ye do
[25:39] well that ye take take heed as unto a
[25:43] light that shineth in the dark place
[25:46] until the day dawn and the day star
[25:50] arise in your hearts.
[25:53] Knowing this
[25:55] first that no prophecy of the scripture
[25:58] is of any private
[26:02] interpretation. For the prophecy came
[26:05] not
[26:06] in old time by the will of man but holy
[26:11] men of God spake as they were moved by
[26:15] the Holy Ghost. Amen. You may be seated.
[26:20] Hallelujah. This is Peter.
[26:24] They were
[26:26] eyewitness. They saw the Lord Jesus
[26:28] Christ.
[26:31] Hallelujah. Right now, I'm telling you,
[26:33] God is working his with his wife. My
[26:39] my topic today, the power of God is
[26:44] within
[26:45] you. The power of God is within you. If
[26:51] the power of God is within
[26:54] you, who are we? Is within us. Who are
[26:59] we? We are many gods.
[27:04] You can create environment to live in.
[27:09] You can speak the word and something
[27:11] will happen. Hallelujah. You see, I I am
[27:15] really excited because I feel the
[27:18] reality of God that I worship, the God
[27:23] that is within me. The power of God that
[27:27] is within me that move me to be a
[27:30] Christian.
[27:32] Hallelujah. To be a Christian, you have
[27:35] to experience the God that you serve.
[27:38] Amen. Without experience the God that
[27:41] you serve, how can you be a Christian?
[27:45] Because he said, "I will give you all
[27:48] all other I have I give it to you."
[27:50] Amen. Glory to God. See, when Paul and
[27:54] and Peter were talking, they knew what
[27:58] they were talking. He said he was
[28:01] eyewitness. He saw something
[28:03] supernatural. It's not something that
[28:05] somebody have told him. He was with him.
[28:09] Glory to God. So if you are with God
[28:12] right now, my goodness. Hallelujah. Let
[28:16] the God of Peter and Paul open our
[28:18] understanding. And for the God that they
[28:21] serve is the same God that we serve
[28:23] today. He never changed because that's
[28:26] his promise. Jesus came as
[28:30] God. Hallelujah. He spoke and it
[28:34] happened. He called and they
[28:37] came. Hallelujah. He healed. He raised
[28:42] the dead. He healed the lepros. Lepros
[28:46] was a curse. So when
[28:48] God healed the lepros, the curse that
[28:52] was upon them, he reversed that cur
[28:57] curse. So our curse that was upon us, he
[29:00] call us. He reverse everything.
[29:03] Hallelujah. It is is more than the sick
[29:06] that was healed. Hallelujah. The
[29:09] salvation is more than the sick is that
[29:13] we always get healed from. Hallelujah.
[29:16] That's the best God can ever give it to
[29:19] mankind. Hallelujah. Because we are not
[29:23] from here. We are going back where we
[29:25] came from. Hallelujah. And we believe we
[29:28] are on our way home. Glory to God.
[29:32] Hallelujah. We are already married. We
[29:35] are the wife of God. Hallelujah. All
[29:38] what God has, he gave it to us. We gave
[29:42] everything to our wife. Our children
[29:45] when we die, we take everything. Your
[29:48] children inherit everything. Even this
[29:50] common earth here. Oh, glory to God.
[29:54] Hallelujah. You gave it to your
[29:56] wife.
[29:58] Mine. God gave everything to us. I am
[30:02] really
[30:03] excited today, tonight. I going to talk
[30:07] a little bit. You see, I can I I get so
[30:12] excited. But we have a man who can
[30:16] express it more than what we can express
[30:20] it.
[30:22] Hallelujah. He called
[30:24] us himself. Jesus himself called us. No
[30:29] man called us to be here. This Jesus
[30:32] himself called us because we are a part
[30:36] of
[30:37] him.
[30:39] Hallelujah. Thank you
[30:41] Lord. You see we got to express the
[30:46] eternal life that he gave you to us
[30:50] right now. We are in
[30:53] it. Not is there that we are in it. We
[30:57] are in eternal life now because it
[31:00] started from here. We never die.
[31:03] Glory to God. If you are eternal over
[31:06] there, you are eternal here passing
[31:08] through from this fresh year. Oh, glory.
[31:12] Hallelujah. Because you are eternal. God
[31:15] came down and reverse this body here.
[31:19] Hallelujah. And he revealed to us that
[31:21] we are eternal people. Amen. So this
[31:24] word here, we are strangers here. Glory
[31:27] to God. Hallelujah. You can speak and
[31:30] things happen. Oh my. I see. I see. I
[31:34] see. Hallelujah. I see God
[31:38] moving. Hallelujah. How can you see God
[31:41] moving when you speak or you pray for
[31:44] somebody, you speak to somebody and it
[31:46] happen? You know you have no power to do
[31:49] that. It's the same God that is in you
[31:52] doing through you. Hallelujah. You are
[31:54] eternal being sitting in the in the pew
[31:57] here. You are not just a human being
[32:00] that the people look to you.
[32:02] Hallelujah.
[32:04] Amen. One day you think when Paul said
[32:09] this body will change, you think he was
[32:12] just talking this body will fall down.
[32:15] It's like when you put a seed on the
[32:18] ground, that seed has to be rotten and
[32:20] the life has to spring forth.
[32:24] Hallelujah. My thank you Lord. The seed
[32:27] of God is in us.
[32:29] [Music]
[32:31] Hallelujah. Amen. He started from who?
[32:34] He started from
[32:36] Abraham. Those ages there.
[32:40] Why? You see, we are speaking the word
[32:43] of God right now to the people right
[32:46] here on the face of the earth. When God
[32:50] came to
[32:51] Abraham, he sat down with
[32:54] Abraham. That was God
[32:57] himself. There were three
[33:00] people. Two went to Sodom. Do you think
[33:03] Sodom Sodorite do you think they they if
[33:07] they knew that those
[33:10] angels were God messenger you think they
[33:13] will behave like why they
[33:14] behave the same thing is happening now
[33:17] we are God messengers
[33:20] they they can't recognize us because why
[33:24] they are blinds of this
[33:26] world oh thank you Jesus hallelujah
[33:31] my
[33:35] Why? Why Abraham? God sat with
[33:39] Abraham because the love that God has
[33:43] for Abraham, he cannot help it. He has
[33:47] to sat down with with him and have
[33:50] fellowship with
[33:52] him. You see,
[33:54] Lot was not Abraham. God give his
[33:57] promise to Abraham. So Lord type the
[34:01] denomination here who where God is. God
[34:05] is with us here right now speaking to
[34:08] Abraham children because we receive him
[34:13] because when God sent his prophet and
[34:15] you receive him you you receive a
[34:17] prophet reward.
[34:19] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. God came
[34:22] down and sat down with Abraham and Abra
[34:25] Abraham received him. So he was pleased
[34:28] to sit down and reveal every secret that
[34:31] is going to do to Abraham. He told him,
[34:34] I'm going to destroy
[34:35] Sodom. And now we are in sodomite right
[34:39] now. Everybody see nobody that have to
[34:42] tell you you're going to reach a time
[34:44] you cannot walk on the
[34:47] street by you going to walk in the
[34:49] street by only spoken
[34:52] word. My thank you Jesus. H. Sorry about
[34:56] my scream. I'm excited. I'm excited with
[34:59] the what God has given to us and I have
[35:02] to enjoy it before even this body goes
[35:06] to the grave. I'm starting from here to
[35:09] heaven because heaven what you going to
[35:12] do? You're going to be
[35:14] enjoy joy. Joy joy joy in your heart.
[35:20] Could you
[35:21] imagine? You never see Abraham, but you
[35:24] heard him. And you sat down with
[35:27] Abraham. Hallelujah. And Abraham said,
[35:30] I'm pleased to see you. I was wanted to
[35:32] see you. Two, today they want to see us.
[35:38] Because the things that we are facing
[35:40] right now is not what they face that
[35:42] day. We are facing the sinners of
[35:46] sin. This world is full of so many
[35:49] corruption.
[35:51] Hallelujah. From the government to the
[35:55] church. But thank God, God has given us
[35:59] a
[36:00] prophet who has revealed himself to us.
[36:04] And now we accepted
[36:07] him. Now he make you his bride. His
[36:10] wife. The bride is over. You are his
[36:15] wife. God marry you. Go. You know me and
[36:18] Bri Gabriel, we make furniture. You get
[36:21] a fabric, big fabric. You roll it on the
[36:24] on the on the table and you cut, you put
[36:26] a pattern and you cut a
[36:28] pattern. All the fabric is good. It's
[36:32] the same price, but you cut you put a
[36:36] pattern on it. The one that you you take
[36:40] their breast that somebody's going to
[36:44] use them and the rest ask him we put in
[36:47] the
[36:48] garbage. You cannot use all the fabric.
[36:51] No matter what you do, you cannot use
[36:53] all the fabric. Some will go to the
[36:55] garbage. You cannot help it. God cannot
[36:58] help it. Thank God we are in the
[37:00] pattern. God's pattern. Hallelujah.
[37:04] God's pattern. We are in it.
[37:07] It's not by your, it's by the grace and
[37:11] mercy of God that we get it in. So don't
[37:15] play with your salvation.
[37:18] It's enjoy it. Please, this is
[37:22] wonderful. Wonderful.
[37:24] Children, young people, don't let
[37:27] nothing disturb you. Whatever God have
[37:30] for you, you're going to receive it.
[37:32] Hallelujah. There is nothing that can
[37:35] pass by you. God has in store everything
[37:38] for you. Hallelujah. Things that he
[37:41] don't even imagine is already waiting
[37:43] for you. You young people, I'm telling
[37:45] you. Don't be discouraged. Enjoy the
[37:49] salvation. Never mind what anybody tells
[37:52] you. This is real.
[37:54] Hallelujah. This is
[37:56] real. Children of God, let us stand up.
[38:01] God has given you something
[38:03] tremendous that nobody has it. Only you
[38:06] has it.
[38:08] Take it, enjoy it, use it. The power of
[38:13] God is within
[38:15] you. Hallelujah. We are You are not just
[38:18] a normal churchgoers. No, you are not a
[38:21] normal churchgoers. You are
[38:24] superior and
[38:26] conquerors.
[38:28] Hallelujah. Amen.
[38:32] Thank you
[38:34] Lord. Oh thank you
[38:37] Jesus. The denomination the people
[38:40] rejected him and he turn right now.
[38:45] Thank God we Gentiles we didn't know
[38:47] him. It's by the grace of God. me and
[38:51] you can sit down and enjoying the
[38:55] goodness of God, the riches of his his
[38:59] his mercy and grace, the riches of his
[39:02] word he has given unto us. Don't say you
[39:06] don't understand. You really
[39:09] understand because you cannot understand
[39:11] by your own kind of mind. When the time
[39:14] comes that you want to know God who
[39:15] tells you. Hallelujah. Do not
[39:18] underestimate yourself.
[39:22] God going to reveal to you. God going to
[39:24] tell you what to do. And when you speak
[39:27] or when you do it is perfect because God
[39:30] has spoken through you. Hallelujah. It's
[39:32] not only
[39:36] you. Thank you. God is calling his
[39:40] children around the whole world. This
[39:43] evening I'm going to play a
[39:46] cassette.
[39:48] Babraham. I just give you this little I
[39:51] have all my notes here. But when I was
[39:54] coming this before I was
[39:57] coming, I want you to
[39:59] hear the word of God from the
[40:03] prophet about he that is in
[40:08] you. Greater is he that is you than
[40:13] he that is in the world. I want you to
[40:16] hear by yourself. So, we're going to
[40:18] listen to the message for a little
[40:21] while. Are you okay with that? God
[40:24] changed my
[40:26] plan. Hallelujah. God bless you. Let us
[40:30] put it on and then play the cassette.
[40:48] Let's
[40:50] stop so much
[40:54] nonsense. Be reverent,
[40:58] sincere. I notice those confessions
[41:01] sometimes when they on television when
[41:04] they had that Billy Graham's meeting.
[41:07] Not nothing against Billy Graham, but
[41:08] out there in California, the man
[41:10] preached a wonderful message that last
[41:12] night.
[41:14] preached the very same thing that I
[41:16] preached here not long ago on Daniel the
[41:18] art weight in the balance and
[41:20] pounding. How many saw it? Many of you,
[41:23] I guess. Look, did you notice those
[41:26] people coming from the aisles chewing
[41:28] chewing gum, laughing, punching one
[41:31] another? That's not walking up between
[41:34] death and life. That's not sorry for sin
[41:37] and
[41:38] repentance. It's just what Billy said,
[41:41] making a decision.
[41:43] And a cold, dryeyed consi decision is
[41:46] nothing. Amen. Not a thing. You've got
[41:49] to be sorry for sin and turn from it.
[41:53] And Billy himself said proves that out
[41:56] of 30,000, you can't find 30 in a year.
[41:59] He said the day, "What's the matter with
[42:01] New York? I had that great meeting there
[42:04] and what happened? Sin's worse than it
[42:06] ever was. And it will continue to get
[42:11] worse. There will be no re national
[42:14] repentance. The nation is gone. Amen.
[42:17] Amen. Just you individuals, right? And
[42:20] soon that'll be over if it isn't
[42:22] already. Amen.
[42:24] Now, you just mark that down. You young
[42:26] children see how far brother Brandon
[42:29] date brother Brandon that what I've said
[42:31] is right or wrong. Sin will get worse
[42:35] and worse until one day the skies will
[42:38] catch on fire. She'll fall to the earth
[42:40] and the earth will burn with fervent
[42:42] heat. But the redeemed won't be here
[42:44] then. They'll be gone.
[42:47] Now in the book of St. Mark the 11th
[42:51] chapter 1 John 4:4 and in Matthew 28:20
[42:57] I wish to read. I first I wish to read
[43:00] from St. Mark the 11th chapter and the
[43:03] 12th verse to the 24th. Listen real
[43:06] close now as we read. And now this is
[43:09] going to back up for a little testimony
[43:11] and a few words of exhortation and then
[43:13] we'll see what the Lord will have us to
[43:16] do. And everybody just remain seated and
[43:19] be prayerful now as we
[43:21] read Mark
[43:23] 11:12. And
[43:25] on the
[43:27] marorrow when they came from Bethany, he
[43:31] was hungry. And seeing a fig tree far
[43:34] off having leaves, he came if happily he
[43:38] might find anything
[43:40] thereon. And when he come to it, he
[43:43] found nothing but leaves, for the time
[43:46] of figs was not yet.
[43:49] And Jesus answered and said unto it, "No
[43:53] man eat fruit of thee from henceforth
[43:57] forever." And his disciples heard
[44:01] it. And they came to Jerusalem. And
[44:04] Jesus went into the temple and began to
[44:06] cast out them that sold and bought in
[44:09] the temple, and overthrew the tables of
[44:12] the money changers, and the seats of
[44:15] them that sold
[44:17] doves, and would not suffer that any man
[44:21] should carry any vessel through the
[44:23] temple. And he taught, saying unto them,
[44:27] It is written, My Father's house shall
[44:31] be called the of all nations, the house
[44:35] of prayer, but you have made it a den of
[44:38] thieves. And the scribes and the chief
[44:40] priests heard it, and sought how they
[44:43] might destroy him, for
[44:45] they for they feared him, because all
[44:49] the people was astonished at his
[44:52] doctrine. And when evening was come, he
[44:55] went out of the city. And in the
[44:58] morning, that's another day, as they
[45:02] passed by, they saw the fig tree dried
[45:05] up from the roots. Within 24 hours, the
[45:09] miracle had taken place after he said to
[45:11] it, "No man, nothing looked like
[45:13] happened then. But by the next day, it
[45:16] was dried up. And Peter calling to
[45:19] remembrance said unto him, "Master,
[45:22] behold, the fig tree which thou been
[45:24] cursed is withered away." Jesus
[45:27] answering him, said unto them, have
[45:30] faith in God.
[45:33] For verily I say unto you, that
[45:35] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[45:38] Be thou removed, and be thou cast into
[45:41] the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[45:44] heart, but shall believe, that those
[45:47] things which he said shall come to pass,
[45:50] he shall have whatsoever he saith.
[45:54] Therefore, I say to you, what things
[45:57] soever you desire when you pray, believe
[46:01] that you receive them, and you shall
[46:04] have them. And when you stand praying,
[46:07] forgive. If you have ought against any,
[46:10] that your father also which is in heaven
[46:13] may forgive you your trespasses. But if
[46:16] you do not forgive, neither will your
[46:20] father which is in heaven forgive your
[46:24] trespasses. It's on
[46:26] conditions. Now I would like to read
[46:29] first John
[46:33] 4:4. Ye are of God, little children, and
[46:38] have overcome them because listen close.
[46:43] Greater is he that is in you than he
[46:47] that is in the world. May I read it
[46:50] again
[46:52] now? Ye are of God, little children, and
[46:55] have overcome them. Talking of the
[46:59] antichrist, because greater is he that's
[47:02] in you than he that is in the world. Two
[47:07] pronoun he personal he that is in the
[47:10] world and he that's in you. He that's in
[47:13] you is greater than he that's in the
[47:14] world. Now and the the 28th chapter of
[47:19] St. Matthew and the 20th verse teaching
[47:23] them to observe all things whatsoever I
[47:25] have commanded you. Lo I am with you
[47:28] always even to the end of the
[47:32] world. Now a text from that tonight I
[47:35] would like to use this as a text. Ye
[47:40] that is in you and on this I wish to
[47:44] build faith of course for a prayer
[47:48] service and J just as quick now it is as
[47:52] I've told you I like to post you on
[47:57] events that has taken place and I
[47:59] usually wait until I come to the the
[48:04] church here to say the events and then
[48:08] if others likes to hear it. They can
[48:10] pick it up through the tapes, but I'll
[48:11] wait till I'm here. And there is at
[48:14] least this event that I'm going to tell
[48:16] you about just now. There's several men
[48:19] here that's witness of these Christian
[48:22] brothers. One that was present was
[48:25] Brother Banks Woods. Another that was
[48:28] present was Brother David Woods. Another
[48:31] that's present here was Brother Evans
[48:33] and his son Ronald. Another was present
[48:37] is our notable deacon brother Wheeler.
[48:42] And another present was brother man
[48:45] uh is brother man here from New Albia, a
[48:47] Methodist preacher that I baptized in
[48:50] the name of Jesus Christ just recently.
[48:52] He was there also when this happened.
[48:57] It's been for some time for a few years
[49:00] that I have had a deep burden on my
[49:06] chest that I in my heart it felt to me
[49:09] as if I had done something wrong and I
[49:13] searched my life over and over and over
[49:15] to see what was wrong. Lord, if if I've
[49:18] done anything wrong, then you just
[49:20] reveal it to me what's wrong and I'll go
[49:23] and make it right. But nothing would be
[49:26] revealed to me. I'd say, "Did I hurt
[49:28] somebody? Did I leave something undone?
[49:31] Have I do I read enough? Do I pray
[49:34] enough?" And I'd read and pray and and
[49:36] I' I'd say, "Reveal it to me. Did I harm
[49:39] somebody somewhere? If I did, I'll make
[49:41] it right. Just show me. I don't want
[49:43] this burden." And for the last five
[49:45] years since I come off the field,
[49:47] there's been a burden hanging in my
[49:49] heart. I've went to the mountains. I
[49:52] went to the seaside. I went everywhere
[49:54] and prayed and prayed and prayed and it
[49:56] just wouldn't let up. And I thought of
[49:59] everything if I had done anything but it
[50:02] still it wouldn't let up. I was just in
[50:04] bondage like and it's very strange that
[50:06] this would be lifted just at the time
[50:08] this message come forth of this morning.
[50:12] Now was it God holding back for this? I
[50:15] don't know. See these things is all in
[50:17] my mind. You can imagine what's in a
[50:19] man's heart when you put up with that.
[50:23] See, to think of what is taking place
[50:27] and know to tell the people knowing that
[50:29] some will get the wrong slant and some
[50:31] will go this way and that way and you
[50:33] know how it is and some will believe and
[50:34] some won't and but that's what you have
[50:36] to put up with. How can you say it
[50:38] without hurting? How can you say it that
[50:40] it'll take effect? How can you say it to
[50:42] show the people that you're not not
[50:44] picking on man but you love them? How
[50:45] can you be strict and firm and yet be
[50:48] loving and how are you going to present
[50:49] it and then have war to me if I don't
[50:51] present it? See, and there you are. See
[50:54] it? No wonder it keeps you nervous and
[50:58] to come down from from come up from
[51:02] Arizona to meet a bunch of brethren here
[51:04] that goes hunting with me up in Colorado
[51:06] each year. Now, some people has wondered
[51:10] why do you go hunt? What makes you see
[51:14] here? You are filling up. I'm emptying
[51:17] out there. I'm filling up so I can't
[51:19] empty out. You see now I don't go just
[51:23] to shoot game while people anyone here
[51:26] that goes with me knows that I passed by
[51:29] hundreds of head of game and never even
[51:31] touch them. I don't I hear not long ago
[51:34] I begin to shoot game for the Christian
[51:36] businessmen. When he go up say, "Billy,
[51:38] get me a bull. Get me a cow. Get me a
[51:40] elk. Get me this or that." The other.
[51:41] I'd go out and just shoot game from
[51:44] right and left. The Lord helped me so I
[51:47] could see, you know, fine game and
[51:50] pretty fair shooting and hit him and and
[51:53] uh they just sit around and talk about
[51:55] their business. Then the Lord told me
[51:57] not to do that no more and I I felt bad
[51:59] about it. So I promised him I wouldn't
[52:01] do it no more. You know, I said if it's
[52:04] emergency and somebody needs it, I'll do
[52:06] it. But if they don't need it, I won't
[52:07] do it. You saying, man, they got plenty
[52:09] of money to buy beef and stuff. go. Why
[52:11] should I do that? Let the animal live if
[52:13] you're not going to use it. So, um I
[52:16] just go to be alone. And any man that
[52:18] ever goes hunting with me? No, I don't
[52:19] hunt with anybody. I go out to myself to
[52:23] get alone. I go with him to have
[52:24] fellowship at night, stand around and
[52:26] pray and so forth. But there was many
[52:28] other ministers there. There was up in
[52:30] the mountains this year was our brother
[52:32] Palmer. I believe I saw him somewhere a
[52:34] while. Here he is sitting here. Brother
[52:35] Palmer and brother Bob Lambert. He was
[52:38] sure this morning. I heard him shouting
[52:39] somewhere. I guess he's still here. And
[52:41] then there was brother the two Martin
[52:44] boys. I I guess they're here. Are they
[52:45] Martin boys? Brother the brother Martin,
[52:48] you called me the other day. That was
[52:50] good. That boy uh was healed. That
[52:52] brother minister, are you here? The one
[52:53] I prayed for on the phone the other day.
[52:55] Uh forget his name from down in Arkansas
[52:58] there. His wife called me. Man is all
[53:00] swelled up in the side and high fever
[53:01] dying. The same man that was called out
[53:04] down at the the Little Rock or the Hot
[53:06] Springs meeting. sitting in the meeting
[53:08] and it's a fine looking fellow. He's
[53:10] here. I guess he won't raise up now at
[53:12] all, but uh I forget his name. I can't
[53:14] think of his name. Blair. Brother Blair.
[53:16] Somebody. Well, now sitting in the
[53:18] meeting at Little Rock. How many was
[53:19] that? I mean, at the Hot Springs, how
[53:21] many is at the meeting? And the Holy
[53:23] Spirit called that young fella and told
[53:25] him that the devil was trying to get him
[53:28] to renounce me to say I was a false
[53:30] prophet. And the man witnessed it was
[53:32] the truth. You see what the devil is
[53:35] doing? The man don't go to doctors. He
[53:37] don't believe in going to doctors. But
[53:39] the Satan knew this disease was going to
[53:41] strike him and he could kill him right
[53:43] there. See, so he's trying to get him to
[53:46] renounce me. And the Holy Spirit and
[53:48] grace called him out and told him not to
[53:51] do that. The man being a stranger called
[53:53] him not to do that. And the other night
[53:55] his wife called me and said, "Brother
[53:56] Brandon, I believe he's dying." Said
[53:59] he's is all swelled out. His fever is
[54:01] out of his head nearly. And so the last
[54:03] thing he said, "Call brother Brandon." I
[54:06] said, "Have you got anything? Your purse
[54:07] with a handkerchief?" No, I was in
[54:09] Tucson. She was in Arkansas. And I said,
[54:12] "You got?" She said, "I believe her
[54:14] scar." I said, "Now put your hand on the
[54:15] scarf and hold receive the other hand."
[54:18] And I prayed and asked God to be
[54:21] merciful and to renounce that enemy. And
[54:24] she went and laid the scarf on the man.
[54:26] And the next morning, he called me.
[54:31] In about 24 hours or less than that, our
[54:34] precious brother, I haven't seen him
[54:36] tonight yet, Brother Roy
[54:38] Roersonson. And at once, you know,
[54:40] Brother
[54:40] Roy, kind of a military man. If he's
[54:44] here, I I hope he understands because
[54:47] I'm not condemning that. But
[54:49] everything's stuck. He's a sergeant in
[54:51] the army, you know, and you have to kind
[54:52] of get used to handling man like they do
[54:54] in the army. Well, these spiritual
[54:56] things were somebody else, not Henum.
[54:58] But the Lord spared him. He would have
[55:00] been dead. They laid him out for dead
[55:01] for a long time. The Lord healed him.
[55:04] He's followed it ever since. But all
[55:06] this spiritual stuff he didn't know
[55:08] about in visions. And here not long ago.
[55:10] Many know the vision that was given to
[55:11] brother Roy even before I went out there
[55:13] about him seeing me standing up on the
[55:15] mountain there in that light and a voice
[55:16] coming from him. That took all doubt
[55:18] from brother Roy. And the other night he
[55:20] was stricken in such a place until he
[55:23] was so sick and got so high and fever
[55:25] and stuff and the doctor had given him
[55:27] medicine everything and then it didn't
[55:29] do no good and he even become to a place
[55:32] to he couldn't even move himself
[55:33] anymore. his legs and things is like
[55:35] paralyzed and a poor little brother has
[55:37] been shot to pieces with shrapnel from a
[55:40] 88 Germany 88 and it was just every I
[55:44] think all his whole crew was killed but
[55:45] he and there he was blowed to pieces and
[55:49] you know what happened I told his noble
[55:52] wife sister Roersonson she said she got
[55:55] anything there she said I got a
[55:56] handkerchief if you want to pray or I'll
[55:58] go get it now I was in Tucson and laid
[56:01] her hand up on that and prayed had a
[56:03] rebuke and said, "Sister Overson, it's
[56:06] going to be gone." Something told me
[56:09] there it's going to be gone. Say it. And
[56:12] within a half hour, the beaver is gone.
[56:15] He's in the kitchen hunting something
[56:16] deep.
[56:19] Great is our God. What I'm trying to
[56:20] say, don't never lose your confidence.
[56:23] Don't let Satan tell you evil about me
[56:25] cuz he's much. But you keep that
[56:27] confidence cuz if you don't, it won't
[56:29] happen. Don't look to me as a man. I'm a
[56:31] man. I'm full of mistakes. But look to
[56:33] what I'm saying about him. It's him.
[56:36] He's the lamb. As we were in
[56:39] Colorado, as we were up there, we went
[56:42] back and been real dry. Game was scarce.
[56:46] Brother Wheeler, the Lord blessed him
[56:48] and gave him a a fine trophy. And we
[56:50] were so happy about that. First time
[56:52] he's ever woods hunting. And the Lord
[56:53] blessed him. And then I had
[56:56] shot a big trophy that I had looked for
[57:00] for 20 years. been watching Brother
[57:02] Banks and I been after him for a long
[57:04] time. And when I did shooting my rifle
[57:08] in down in a hot country, bringing up
[57:09] into a cold, it swell the stock on glass
[57:12] bed and it shot it several inches off
[57:15] and hit the animal standing between
[57:16] trees where it ought to hit him lower
[57:19] than that, which would have humanely
[57:21] killed the animal in a second, but it
[57:22] hit him so high it he jumped like he
[57:25] fell like that and Billy was with me and
[57:27] he said, "I got him." I thought it too,
[57:29] but when we went over there, it wasn't.
[57:30] And so he said, "You hit a tree." I
[57:31] looked up and now there's no mark on the
[57:33] tree. And then I went to searching for
[57:35] it. And then there come a warning sign.
[57:39] There was practically a hundred men just
[57:41] above us. And brother Palmer and them as
[57:42] a witness of that. And brother Evans.
[57:46] That's right. He was there. Brother
[57:47] Welsh Evans and his boy Ronnie. I'll be
[57:49] called him a while ago. And great loads
[57:52] of man went up above us. What call the
[57:54] cow camp up there where the cowboy stays
[57:56] and rides keeps the cows separated. I
[57:59] used to stay in that camp myself and
[58:01] herd those cattle and keep them apart.
[58:03] And then um so in there there's about a
[58:06] hundred men, but anyone knows in that
[58:08] country when a blizzard is forecast, you
[58:10] better get away right now. That's why
[58:12] brother Palmer and them left early
[58:14] because he only had a 3-speed
[58:16] transmission in their car and they had
[58:18] to get out of there cuz weather you're
[58:20] there and you might stay for weeks. So
[58:22] they said there is a blizzard coming.
[58:24] the forecast, the papers,
[58:27] radio, load after load, practically
[58:29] everything from up around in there left
[58:31] out. They're gone right now cuz they
[58:34] know to get out of there. But my
[58:36] brethren had two deer license and they
[58:38] they didn't want to go. So, um I said,
[58:42] "Well, we'll stay." But I had a meeting
[58:44] coming up in about 6 days and I had to
[58:46] go back to Tucson. So my little wife I
[58:51] we've been married 22 years and 20 years
[58:54] on our anniversary I've been up there
[58:56] every time just happened to hit me. So I
[58:59] I got a little place I always walk out
[59:01] and pray and it looked like a place
[59:02] where I tuck her you know I made kind of
[59:05] a little thing you know I didn't have
[59:07] enough money to take a hunting trip and
[59:09] my honeymoon so I I kind of tucked my
[59:13] wife on a hunting trip for the
[59:14] honeymoon. So we was in New York and I
[59:17] remember helping her up over logs and
[59:18] things and get into a place and I got a
[59:20] little place out there I always think of
[59:22] her when I go there on our anniversary
[59:24] October 23rd is when the season's open
[59:26] there and 20 years I haven't been home
[59:29] always up there. So that day was our
[59:32] anniversary and brother man I said now
[59:35] if you brethren I said to the fire that
[59:37] morning now if that night rather if you
[59:39] all want to stay now remember we may be
[59:41] in here for a month cuz I've seen 20
[59:44] foot of snowfall just in a little
[59:45] overnight just you go out there and you
[59:48] just as dry and nice the next morning
[59:49] snows just need over maybe over top of
[59:52] your tent. So then I said and then you
[59:54] stay there till that melts all so you're
[59:56] about 15 to 20 miles back in the
[59:58] wilderness. And so then I said, "And if
[1:00:00] it gets emergency, of course they send
[1:00:01] in helicopters and get you out, but
[1:00:03] usually they just nobody perishing. They
[1:00:05] just have to wait there." So everybody
[1:00:07] scats this as soon as they hear that
[1:00:09] broadcast rather. So we were back there
[1:00:12] and I said, "Now you make up your mind.
[1:00:14] If you want to stay, I'm here to hunt
[1:00:15] with you and I'll call my wife and tell
[1:00:18] her happy anniversary." But I said,
[1:00:21] "Then in that I will also I we will
[1:00:24] we'll get some groceries cuz we might
[1:00:26] have to stay in here without bread
[1:00:27] then." And I don't want to see any more
[1:00:30] flat jacks for a long time and pancakes.
[1:00:33] So then I'd been eating them in Canada
[1:00:35] for about 21 days and I sure had a fill
[1:00:38] of them things. And so then I want to
[1:00:41] get some bread. So they said they wanted
[1:00:44] to stay. So there was nothing for you to
[1:00:45] stay. But brother man and I went out and
[1:00:48] we went down there and I got the
[1:00:49] groceries and I called the wife and the
[1:00:52] phone wouldn't answer. No one answered.
[1:00:54] So, I waited about an hour till we got
[1:00:56] the grocery shop, went back, called, she
[1:00:58] didn't answer. I had to call Sister
[1:01:00] Evans. I believe Sister Evans is here.
[1:01:02] And I told, "Yeah, Brother Evans. Sister
[1:01:04] Evans is here." So, I called Sister
[1:01:06] Evans for Brother Evans and told him.
[1:01:08] She said, "I'll call Sister Brandon and
[1:01:10] tell her a happy anniversary." Of
[1:01:13] course, you know. So, but she'd gone
[1:01:15] shopping to get some groceries for the
[1:01:17] children. And then we come back and the
[1:01:20] next morning, what was in the skies but
[1:01:22] clouds. It hadn't rained up there all
[1:01:24] fall and it was really dry and it to
[1:01:26] prolong the hunting season a few days
[1:01:28] extra on counter drying. Well, I said to
[1:01:31] the brethren that morning, now the first
[1:01:33] drop of rain starts to fall, the first
[1:01:36] snow, the first sleep, anything. Take
[1:01:38] for the camp just as hard as you can cuz
[1:01:40] within 15 minutes, you can't see your
[1:01:41] hand before you and it'll just twist and
[1:01:43] blow. And I don't care how well you know
[1:01:45] the country, you you're going to stay
[1:01:47] right there and you'll perish cuz
[1:01:48] sometimes you can't even breathe. The
[1:01:50] sleep blowing so that you die right
[1:01:52] there. And I said, as soon as it starts
[1:01:54] with that sleep, you take for the camp
[1:01:56] just as hard as you can. I don't care
[1:01:57] where you are. Well, I said, "Go up here
[1:02:00] and set these gulches and I'll climb way
[1:02:02] high and roll rocks over the hill and so
[1:02:04] forth. Scare the deers off the top and
[1:02:05] run them down. You pick out what you
[1:02:06] want." So, I started climbing high and
[1:02:09] by the time I got up to where we call
[1:02:11] the saddle, a little place there, and I
[1:02:13] always cross over to go to a place
[1:02:15] called Quaker Knob, right on the
[1:02:17] continental divide there, way high. And
[1:02:19] when I got to almost this little saddle,
[1:02:22] it's the clouds are getting blacker and
[1:02:24] blacker. Wasn't a car left, just us up
[1:02:26] there. as far and a cowboy on the camp.
[1:02:28] So, it got it got worse and worse. So,
[1:02:30] in a few minutes, it started raining.
[1:02:33] Well, I took my gun and put it under my
[1:02:35] coat, keep the scope from smoking up and
[1:02:37] and uh stopped getting wet, whether it
[1:02:39] run into a bear or something coming
[1:02:41] back. So, I I held my scope like that
[1:02:43] and sat down under a tree a little bit.
[1:02:45] I sat there and praying. I said, "Lord
[1:02:47] God, you're the great Jehovah and I love
[1:02:49] you." How many experiences have I had?
[1:02:51] And I pointed out to the brethren,
[1:02:52] brother Palmer and them the places where
[1:02:54] the eagle, you know, I seen him rise up
[1:02:56] that day, you know, and how that the
[1:02:57] places were all taking place in there.
[1:02:59] It's a temperamental thing to me in
[1:03:01] there. I've had so many great
[1:03:02] experiences with my Lord up in that
[1:03:04] mountain. So, you just can't go there
[1:03:06] without seeing. He's just everywhere.
[1:03:09] So, then as I'm I sat there, then the
[1:03:12] sleep started in the wind twisting like
[1:03:14] that. And I said, "Well, I know the way
[1:03:16] down, but I better get off of here right
[1:03:17] now." So I said it looked down and I
[1:03:20] couldn't even see the bottoms no more
[1:03:21] than clouds just whirling and twisting
[1:03:23] and sle blowing and there it was the
[1:03:26] blizzard forecast for several days. A
[1:03:28] big blizzard
[1:03:29] coming. Brother Tom is your brother Tom
[1:03:32] Simpson coming down from Canada heard
[1:03:34] the forecast and he was advised not to
[1:03:36] go through that part of the country
[1:03:37] because his forecast said there'll be
[1:03:39] blizzard. Where are you brother Tom? I
[1:03:41] think that yeah right here. And um he
[1:03:43] the blizzard was coming. Everybody done
[1:03:45] set in for it. Well, I popped my gun
[1:03:48] back under my shirt, I guess, my red
[1:03:50] shirt. Started walking down the mountain
[1:03:53] and as I started, I got about a half a
[1:03:54] mile from the saddle and oh my big drops
[1:03:57] of snow like that and the wind twisting
[1:03:59] up on that mountain and blowing. I
[1:04:00] couldn't see the bottom no more. I could
[1:04:02] see about 20 ft in front of me and 30. I
[1:04:04] know to come right down this little what
[1:04:05] we call a little hog back, little ridge
[1:04:07] and come off to the creek. Then I know
[1:04:08] to follow the creek and where to go to
[1:04:10] if it got real bad. And u so then I
[1:04:12] started down and got about halfway down
[1:04:14] there and something said to me just as
[1:04:16] plain as you hear me stop and go
[1:04:19] back. I thought what was I thinking
[1:04:22] about maybe just my mind and I just
[1:04:24] couldn't make another step forward.
[1:04:27] David had fixed me a sandwich that
[1:04:29] morning. I think he tried to get Eve
[1:04:31] with me for fixing his daddy one one
[1:04:33] time of onion and honey. That's all we
[1:04:36] had. So he fixed me a baloney and oh I
[1:04:39] don't know what all it was wrapped in
[1:04:41] there. I had it in my shirt and it's
[1:04:42] done got wet through my shirt. I thought
[1:04:44] I'll just stop and eat this and maybe
[1:04:46] I'll you'll be all right then. So I
[1:04:47] pulled out the sandwich about 10:00 and
[1:04:50] I started eating the sandwich and as I
[1:04:52] eat the sandwich I thought now I'll be
[1:04:54] all right. And I started to move on but
[1:04:57] something said go back where you come
[1:04:59] from.
[1:05:01] go back through that
[1:05:03] storm a half a mile or more back up the
[1:05:06] mountain into that dark timber where you
[1:05:08] can then hardly see as far as that
[1:05:11] bargain but I'm getting to be an old man
[1:05:15] and I've been a Christian now for 33
[1:05:18] years and I know no matter what how
[1:05:21] ridiculous it seems mind the Lord hear
[1:05:24] what the Lord said and I turned and went
[1:05:26] back to the saddle feeling my way back
[1:05:30] all asleep getting harder and harder,
[1:05:32] getting darker and darker. And I sit
[1:05:35] down there and just put my coat up like
[1:05:38] this or my shirt over the scope against
[1:05:40] sat down. I thought, "What am I doing
[1:05:42] here? Why would I come back up here and
[1:05:46] I just waited a few minutes and I
[1:05:48] started to get up again and just as
[1:05:51] plain as I'd ever want to
[1:05:54] hear, a voice said, "I am the creator of
[1:05:58] heavens and earth.
[1:06:00] Hallelujah. I make the winds and the
[1:06:02] rain.
[1:06:06] I took off my hat.
[1:06:09] I said, "Great Jehovah, is that
[1:06:14] you?" He said, "I was the one who made
[1:06:17] the winds to cease upon the sea. I was
[1:06:20] the one who made the waves to go down. I
[1:06:23] created heavens and earth. Was not I not
[1:06:27] the one that told you to speak to those
[1:06:30] for squirrels and they come into
[1:06:31] existence. I am God.
[1:06:35] Now when a voice speaks to you, watch
[1:06:38] the scripture. If it's not scriptural,
[1:06:41] you leave it alone. I don't care how
[1:06:43] plain it is. You stay away from
[1:06:46] it. I said, "Yes, Lord."
[1:06:50] He said, "Speak to those winds and that
[1:06:54] storm and it'll go away." Now this Bible
[1:06:58] lays before me which my life is in
[1:07:02] that. I raise up I said I do not doubt
[1:07:05] your voice Lord. I said
[1:07:08] clouds, snow, rain, sleep, I resent your
[1:07:12] coming in the name of Jesus Christ, go
[1:07:15] to your places. I say that the sun must
[1:07:18] come out immediately and shine for four
[1:07:21] days till our hunting trip is over and I
[1:07:22] leave with my
[1:07:25] brethren. It just gushing just like like
[1:07:29] that and it started going going I
[1:07:32] went
[1:07:34] stop. I stood real
[1:07:37] still. My brother up there wondering
[1:07:40] what was
[1:07:41] happening and the sleep rain stopped.
[1:07:46] There came a wind whirling down through
[1:07:48] the mountains, lifted up the
[1:07:51] clouds, and one went this way, east,
[1:07:53] north, west, and south. And within a few
[1:07:56] minutes, the sun was shining nice and
[1:08:00] warm. That's truth.
[1:08:03] God knows that's true. I just stood
[1:08:06] there just looking around with my hat
[1:08:08] off
[1:08:09] looking. God, I You say I got numb all
[1:08:13] over.
[1:08:15] I thought the very God of creation, it's
[1:08:19] all in his hands.
[1:08:22] What's he telling me? And I picked up my
[1:08:24] gun, wiped off the scope, started to
[1:08:27] walk back, go down the hill, and
[1:08:28] something said to me, "Why don't you
[1:08:30] stroll with me through this wilderness?
[1:08:34] Walk with me." I said, "Yes,
[1:08:36] Lord, with all my heart. That would be
[1:08:40] one of the greatest things I could do
[1:08:41] was walk with you." Amen. So I put my
[1:08:44] gun over my shoulder and I started
[1:08:46] walking down through that never axelate
[1:08:49] in a verge of timber. walking through
[1:08:52] there. And as I did walked along down
[1:08:55] along these game
[1:08:57] trails, I felt like I believe I will go
[1:09:00] up to the place where yesterday was our
[1:09:02] anniversary. And I will stand there just
[1:09:04] a few minutes just as a little salute to
[1:09:06] meeting at where it's a little bunch of
[1:09:09] quaking ass up on a little knob. And I
[1:09:12] said, I believe I'll walk up there just
[1:09:14] as a salute to our anniversary. Then
[1:09:16] I'll go back down on this other side in
[1:09:18] these dark timbers and walk around and
[1:09:20] go around over by towards corral peaks
[1:09:22] and come back down that way just walking
[1:09:24] and rejoicing. I saying, "Father, I know
[1:09:27] you are walking with me." And what a
[1:09:29] privilege. There's nobody greater I
[1:09:31] could be walking with. The very God in
[1:09:33] that warm sunshine even to when I come
[1:09:36] out of the mountains, I stopped at
[1:09:39] filling stations and I said, "Beautiful
[1:09:40] day." Three days later, it never rained
[1:09:43] in that part of the country until the
[1:09:45] four days was over. The sun shined every
[1:09:47] day. Is that right, brother?
[1:09:51] And not a cloud in the sky. And I come
[1:09:53] out to filling station. I said, "Um,
[1:09:56] sure. Beautiful day." "Yes, it is." I
[1:09:58] said, "Been off." Said, "It's a strange
[1:10:00] thing." This attendant said, said, "You
[1:10:02] know, they told us we was going to get a
[1:10:03] big blizzard, but all of a sudden it
[1:10:07] stopped. I come on down on the New
[1:10:09] Mexico line. Billy and I, my son, we
[1:10:12] went into a little place there to get
[1:10:13] some uh the morning we left and I said,
[1:10:16] "Sure, pretty day." "Yes, it is." I
[1:10:18] said, "Look been pretty dry." "Yes, it
[1:10:20] has been." I said, "Are you from there?"
[1:10:21] I said, "No, I'm from Wisconsin or
[1:10:24] somewhere." Said, "I've been out here
[1:10:25] about 20 years." Said, "I guess you
[1:10:26] could call it home." I said, "You're a
[1:10:28] navy then, I guess." So, I said, "Yes,
[1:10:31] sir." I said, "Looks like it's been
[1:10:32] awful dusty." He said, "You know, the
[1:10:33] strangest thing happened." Said, "We had
[1:10:35] a forecast it was going to get a
[1:10:36] blizzard and a lot of snow and it
[1:10:38] actually started and then quit." And I
[1:10:40] said, "You don't say
[1:10:42] so." And I come home and brother Tom
[1:10:45] said that he was told not to go that
[1:10:48] way. A blizzard soon. He come through
[1:10:49] the country without any sprinkle of rain
[1:10:51] or anything. Have still God. Just as
[1:10:55] much as he ever was. See, walking up
[1:10:58] there, I was going along. Now, this part
[1:11:02] I hope my wife don't get this tape, but
[1:11:05] I'm going to tell you something. You
[1:11:06] know I It's okay. Praise the Lord. You
[1:11:10] enjoy the tape.
[1:11:12] This is real. This is what we are
[1:11:15] feeding on right now.
[1:11:19] See, as I talk, I feel goosebumps all
[1:11:22] over my body. But I feel it because it's
[1:11:25] part of me. It's part of every one of
[1:11:29] us. He's in
[1:11:32] us. He is a prophet. People may laugh at
[1:11:37] you oldfashioned something like that.
[1:11:40] But let me tell you, greater is he that
[1:11:44] is in me than he that is in the world.
[1:11:48] You have something special. This message
[1:11:52] just get it, play it again and
[1:12:01] exch God has given us something special.
[1:12:06] The same thing that we read, we read
[1:12:08] every day
[1:12:10] from our the day that God called Abraham
[1:12:14] to this day is the same God. And we are
[1:12:19] blessed that God has given us a prophet,
[1:12:24] such a prophet, and they rejected him.
[1:12:28] The world rejected him. But we
[1:12:33] who that we are nothing. The world count
[1:12:37] us nothing. No
[1:12:39] education. No nothing to look
[1:12:43] to. God has called us
[1:12:47] brethren. This is what we are and this
[1:12:50] is what God have given to us. Let it
[1:12:54] hold on tight and one day you will
[1:12:59] see by yourself face to face and you
[1:13:03] know the work that you're doing is not
[1:13:06] in vain. Keep on working. God never
[1:13:10] finished hasn't finished with you yet.
[1:13:12] He's building you. See the scripture
[1:13:15] that we read is the same virtue. Faith,
[1:13:19] virtue, knowledge, temperance. You want
[1:13:22] me to read again to you for this to see
[1:13:25] everything is in you. He build you
[1:13:30] up. The same thing the scripture that we
[1:13:34] read.

[1:13:48] diligently added to your faith virtue is
[1:13:52] over there and virtue to nourish and to

[1:14:00] and to patient godliness and the and to
[1:14:04] godliness brotherly kindness and the
[1:14:07] brother kindness is charity. That's the
[1:14:10] up
[1:14:11] there. See the study study of a

[1:14:26] This is what I have for you tonight. I
[1:14:29] hope you'll be blessed. Keep on working.
[1:14:32] God hasn't finished with you yet.
[1:14:37] I had my message but before I came God
[1:14:41] changed my my
[1:14:42] message for me to share this with you
