[40:10] am not poor
[40:12] and i am not as naturally speaking rich
[40:16] but i eat i wear i live and i'm taken
[40:20] care of because of the grace of god
[40:23] through the church
[40:25] i have not accumulated wealth of any
[40:28] kind
[40:30] amen
[40:31] and i'm saying that publicly you might
[40:33] know it
[40:34] or i am just here as a servant of god
[40:38] with no other motives no other hidden
[40:42] objectives
[40:43] no aims
[40:45] nothing of the kind with one
[40:49] unchanging purpose
[40:51] to serve god throughout my entire life
[40:56] [Applause]
[41:01] if i leave a legacy i want every one of
[41:04] you sisters
[41:06] and brothers to have that same kind of
[41:10] dedication
[41:12] and purpose to the villain plan of god
[41:15] this is not just talk
[41:18] because a lot of preachers will say the
[41:20] same things
[41:21] but this is not talk
[41:23] this is a life invested
[41:26] completely into the kingdom
[41:30] [Applause]
[41:34] and by that i am not saying
[41:37] that i represent
[41:39] uh uh roman catholic
[41:42] um ideas of sainthood
[41:45] of of of earthly physical
[41:48] uh perfections
[41:50] uh because the devil will make you look
[41:53] at me and see and hear all kinds of
[41:56] things that god would allow deliberately
[41:59] to throw you this way that way that way
[42:01] you know and you just can't figure it
[42:04] out
[42:05] just let the lord jesus christ have his
[42:08] way
[42:09] we all built differently for a purpose
[42:13] and for the glory of god amen
[42:17] so let's get i want to give him all the
[42:18] praise the honor and glory that he's
[42:21] brought me this far
[42:23] and i have much more of the race to run
[42:29] amen
[42:34] oh greetings to you from sister marl
[42:37] gilchrist
[42:38] uh sister julie's mom
[42:41] who wrote me this past week
[42:44] thanking god for the times that she has
[42:48] come and been with us fellowshipping
[42:51] with the word of god
[42:53] and i was surprised that she's
[42:55] i never realized it every year
[42:58] or so she was here over
[43:01] 19 or 20 times
[43:04] flying all the way from
[43:06] new zealand to be here among us
[43:10] herself
[43:11] and her precious sister
[43:13] together they sang from off of this
[43:16] pulpit glorious wonderful dedicated
[43:20] voices
[43:21] and now she's
[43:23] her sister has gone on our sister has
[43:26] gone on
[43:27] that
[43:29] sister
[43:30] vanessa's mom
[43:32] has gone on to be with the lord
[43:35] and now this
[43:37] sister moral is kind of lonely now
[43:39] because from
[43:41] school coming up right through all to
[43:43] the church and everything else the two
[43:45] of them always hung out together and now
[43:48] that she's like 88 or 89 i mean
[43:52] that's a lot of years for two people to
[43:55] have a friendship
[43:57] natural and then to have a spiritual
[44:00] fellowship together in jesus christ
[44:04] so
[44:05] those are real real soldiers of the
[44:08] gospel and we want to thank god for them
[44:11] and give god the glory for her
[44:14] [Applause]
[44:19] she said to
[44:20] ask me to bring my greetings to the
[44:22] saints because she will not uh be able
[44:26] to physically come back because of the
[44:28] frailty of age
[44:30] right
[44:31] and um if we never meet again here on
[44:35] earth
[44:36] then she trusts that we will meet
[44:38] together up in glory praise god
[44:45] and thank god but we have with us our
[44:48] precious sister julie here praise the
[44:50] lord
[44:51] and uh we want you all of you
[44:54] pray for one another love one another
[44:57] call one another we live in a time now
[45:00] when we can't literally maybe go visit
[45:03] and stop in and stuff like that because
[45:06] it's changed
[45:08] but we can at least get on the telephone
[45:10] and call one another and keep in touch
[45:14] so that we don't feel that we are
[45:17] locked away alone in our homes
[45:20] amen
[45:22] and that goes not just for sister julie
[45:24] for all of us every one of us praise the
[45:27] lord we have older ones that are usually
[45:30] housebound and stuff like that except
[45:33] for the ones that might be able to run
[45:35] out to the grocery or not but let us
[45:37] open our hearts and reach out one to the
[45:41] other amen god bless you well how many
[45:44] of you uh watch the olympics
[45:48] i don't know about you but i i watch the
[45:50] olympics
[45:52] it's very very exciting uh for me to
[45:55] watch the olympics and see our various
[45:59] runners and jumpers and swimmers and uh
[46:03] you know volleyball or whatever else
[46:06] they part anticipated on i think a young
[46:09] man from london won some kind of a
[46:12] trophy and
[46:14] so on it's marvelous and wonderful to
[46:17] watch them
[46:19] but you know i was really struck
[46:23] when the races were on and the runners
[46:27] were going i forgot there's one young
[46:29] man from saint catharines here um
[46:33] ahmed muhammad i think he ran the
[46:37] five or ten thousand
[46:40] meters and became the gold medal
[46:42] medalist anyway praise god um
[46:46] the thing about that is they would run
[46:49] and run and every day you know they're
[46:51] running and they're running looks normal
[46:53] and ordinary and everything else like
[46:56] that but then it gets to a certain point
[46:59] when it's the last lap
[47:03] oh my when it gets to that last lap then
[47:07] all of a sudden you hear the bell goes
[47:09] off
[47:10] it starts ringing and the moment you see
[47:13] that bell hits the last lap everybody
[47:17] picks up the pace
[47:19] amen they pick up the pace it's not
[47:22] ordinary more why because they're headed
[47:25] for the home stretch glory god they
[47:28] headed for the tape now
[47:30] they headed for the victor's crown
[47:33] they headed for the for the gold medal
[47:35] amen and to stand on that podium that
[47:39] the world might see her uh see them
[47:43] publicly displayed before them to
[47:46] recognize what what what they actually
[47:49] accomplished hallelujah and you know
[47:53] that struck me
[47:55] and took me to as you will now stand as
[47:59] we read from first corinthians
[48:03] chapter
[48:04] 15. verses 51
[48:08] and 52
[48:12] and
[48:13] our topic of course will arise from out
[48:17] of this
[48:19] let us
[48:20] first
[48:22] pray
[48:24] and read the word
[48:26] gracious father we thank you for this
[48:28] glorious opportunity
[48:31] we pray that once again you'll break the
[48:34] bread of life
[48:36] and lord open it up to us
[48:40] that we might live and walk therein
[48:44] we ask your blessing in jesus name amen
[48:50] behold
[48:52] i show you a mystery
[48:56] we shall not
[48:58] all sleep
[49:00] but we shall all be changed
[49:04] in a moment
[49:06] in the twinkling
[49:08] of an eye
[49:11] my subject
[49:12] at the last trump
[49:16] for the trumpet shall sound
[49:19] and the dead shall be raised
[49:21] incorruptible
[49:24] and we shall be changed
[49:26] may the spirit of god bless us together
[49:30] god bless you
[49:31] please be seated
[49:36] now
[49:39] in the early days of modern warfare
[49:46] early days
[49:48] modern warfare
[49:49] the soldiers did not even have a watch
[49:53] like every kid
[49:55] today has a watch
[49:57] they did not have
[49:59] a watch so they couldn't tell the time
[50:02] of the day they didn't know what was
[50:04] happening and so
[50:06] they had to find a way to be able to
[50:10] regulate uh the soldiers actions
[50:15] uh and positions during the day
[50:19] and so
[50:21] the typical soldier's day
[50:24] began with a bugle call
[50:27] it was a bugle call
[50:30] early in the morning
[50:33] and the significance of that
[50:36] was
[50:38] to awaken
[50:40] wake up
[50:42] get up
[50:44] rise up
[50:45] hallelujah
[50:46] and
[50:47] assemble
[50:49] they were supposed to assemble
[50:52] after they got woke up by the trumpet
[50:55] they had to get up
[50:57] and put on their battle dress
[51:00] and then they had to get out to the
[51:03] parade ground
[51:05] and assemble for formation praise god
[51:09] that was called
[51:11] revelly
[51:12] and there the sound of that trumpet
[51:16] would wake up those soldiers
[51:18] and they'll get up in haste put on their
[51:22] uh their clothing and their armament and
[51:25] they will get out there of course we
[51:28] know that that was a type of the apostle
[51:31] paul's ministry amen when god used him
[51:36] to sound the first trumpet to be the
[51:39] first messenger with the word of god for
[51:43] this day
[51:44] because remember the word of god and the
[51:48] voice of god is a trumpet call
[51:51] and paul was used as that first trumpet
[51:56] which he himself said in ephesians 5 14
[52:00] the scripture says arise down that
[52:03] sleepest and come to the light amen it's
[52:07] morning wake up get up move out and
[52:11] let's get about the masters business
[52:14] hallelujah amen so this first trumpet
[52:18] call
[52:19] was to arise
[52:21] to awaken
[52:23] and to assemble
[52:25] together and get into body or formation
[52:30] that you might find your position
[52:32] in the formation that was taking place
[52:36] at that particular time when the
[52:39] lieutenant surgeons and whatever would
[52:42] then gather the man and then will
[52:45] apportion them to each part that they
[52:48] had to fulfill
[52:50] before they would go out to carry out
[52:53] their various assignments
[52:56] now at the end of the day
[52:59] and in particular
[53:01] when it came to night
[53:04] before
[53:05] leaving going to their rest
[53:09] the soldiers rest
[53:11] uh and doing that there was a bugle call
[53:17] that went out
[53:18] to make them aware
[53:20] prepare yourself
[53:23] because now
[53:24] stop whatever you're doing
[53:27] whatever you're engaged with stop it now
[53:31] and prepare yourself because it's rest
[53:35] time coming now
[53:36] it's time for you to go
[53:39] into your barracks turned to you to find
[53:42] your place
[53:43] and time for you to rest enter into the
[53:47] rest amen
[53:49] hallelujah and so
[53:51] that bugle call would go out
[53:54] and that was known
[53:57] as the last post
[54:00] i don't know if there are any soldiers
[54:02] in here
[54:03] or former soldiers but you would know
[54:06] that they call that the last post or the
[54:11] last trumpet the last trump
[54:14] for the day
[54:15] was that last post the call
[54:19] see because the taps
[54:22] the signal
[54:23] that it was time for inspection
[54:27] time for inspection
[54:29] when that bugle call went out
[54:33] they know they had to present themselves
[54:37] to start getting inspected
[54:40] and the officer
[54:42] will then
[54:44] walk down the line
[54:46] inspecting
[54:47] every
[54:48] single one
[54:50] it was also
[54:53] a time for the last roll call
[54:56] the last roll crawl was now taking place
[55:01] and they had to be in line
[55:04] because if their name was called and
[55:06] they're not there then that's it you
[55:09] know you're out and after that is
[55:11] punishment right oh my so you've got to
[55:15] answer that last roll call when that
[55:18] bugle sounded you must answer to the
[55:22] last roll call
[55:24] when it was sounded amen
[55:27] then each soldier
[55:29] had to run in the line
[55:31] or stand there quickly to
[55:35] account for himself by calling out his
[55:38] name
[55:39] amen and saying present
[55:42] or here or or whatever his name was he
[55:45] had to call it out so they could
[55:48] recognize that he was present and that
[55:51] he was there and accounted for
[55:55] and you see
[55:57] this served the purpose
[56:00] of letting all the soldiers whether they
[56:03] are 10
[56:04] or they are 10 000
[56:06] when they heard that bugle call
[56:09] they knew that all is well
[56:13] all is well
[56:15] now you can relax
[56:17] and you can go
[56:19] and rest
[56:21] because the entire camp
[56:24] has now been inspected
[56:26] and the entire camp
[56:28] is also secure
[56:31] and with the security around that camp
[56:34] the soldiers can now begin to go
[56:38] and sleep
[56:39] and rest because the camp was secure
[56:45] there was there were many other trumpet
[56:48] signals during the day which we will not
[56:51] talk about you can go and read or find
[56:54] out about those other calls you know
[56:56] there's other calls uh retreat advance
[57:00] so on uh mealtimes this that there's
[57:02] other calls that the trumpets will sound
[57:06] but we are not we're not going to
[57:08] discuss that we just talk about the
[57:10] first trumpet
[57:11] and now there is the last trumpets given
[57:15] in the day but these two were the most
[57:19] important
[57:21] sounding
[57:22] of those bugle calls
[57:24] to the heart of a soldier
[57:27] the last
[57:29] the first
[57:31] first and the last i think jesus said he
[57:34] was the first
[57:35] and he was the last
[57:38] he was
[57:39] the revelate
[57:41] and he
[57:42] is our last post
[57:44] amen praise god he is the first trump
[57:48] and he is the last trump
[57:51] he is our everything
[57:53] and we put our trust in him praise god
[57:57] hallelujah
[57:59] amen one pause
[58:01] is everything all right
[58:04] here
[58:06] okay
[58:10] now
[58:11] nobody really knows unless you were a
[58:15] soldier a former soldier
[58:18] nobody knows the power
[58:21] and the purpose
[58:22] uh on the promise
[58:24] of that last trump when it sounds to the
[58:29] heirs of a soldier even if he is a
[58:33] former soldier we have a navy man right
[58:35] there i just remember uh
[58:38] yeah yeah here we have a military person
[58:40] sitting right here in the front as if he
[58:42] knew i was going to preach a message
[58:44] like this
[58:45] today where we thank god for him amen
[58:49] but truly there might be others in here
[58:51] i don't know but the fact is
[58:55] long after they have left the army
[58:58] inside of them
[59:00] they have the memory
[59:02] of the sounding of that last trumpet
[59:06] when it strikes their soul they
[59:09] recognize something amen praise god
[59:13] because they're built that way whether
[59:16] they're in the services
[59:18] or they're out of the services
[59:21] the memories still call to a soldier's
[59:25] heart saying and these are the real true
[59:28] words of the last post sounded by the
[59:31] trumpet but that trumpet sound is really
[59:35] these words
[59:36] day is done
[59:38] and gone the sun
[59:41] from the lakes
[59:43] from the hills
[59:45] and from the sky
[59:47] all is well
[59:49] all is well
[59:51] safely rest
[59:53] for god is nigh
[59:54] that is the last post and that is the
[59:58] voice of that last trumpet
[1:00:01] and if that last post
[1:00:04] that last trumpet for a natural soldier
[1:00:07] can create such a pulsation within their
[1:00:11] hearts my friends
[1:00:13] what about us when we read in our bible
[1:00:18] these scriptures that we just read
[1:00:23] behold
[1:00:25] i show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:00:30] sleep
[1:00:32] but we shall all be changed
[1:00:35] in a moment
[1:00:36] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:00:39] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:00:43] sound
[1:00:44] and the dead
[1:00:46] shall be raised
[1:00:48] incorruptible
[1:00:49] and we shall
[1:00:51] be changed amen
[1:00:54] oh my what will that do to the hearts
[1:00:58] of christian soldiers
[1:01:01] soldiers of the lord jesus christ
[1:01:04] that knows him in the power of his
[1:01:06] resurrection
[1:01:08] that's been trained for his purpose
[1:01:11] raised up for spiritual warfare
[1:01:15] raised up to be used by the hand of god
[1:01:18] amen because every true soldier of jesus
[1:01:22] christ
[1:01:23] every true believer is a real soldier of
[1:01:28] the living god hallelujah because they
[1:01:31] are supernatural soldiers
[1:01:35] amen
[1:01:36] because they got to fight against
[1:01:38] supernatural devils
[1:01:41] so they have to be supernatural soldiers
[1:01:45] spiritual soldiers the fight against
[1:01:48] satan amen and all of his unseen hosts
[1:01:53] for the bible tells us we are here not
[1:01:56] to fight against flesh and blood but
[1:01:58] against principalities and powers and
[1:02:01] spiritual wickedness in high places so
[1:02:05] we are fighting an unseen war hallelujah
[1:02:10] amen and here we are brothers
[1:02:13] gleaning

[1:02:25] the field that this prophets of god has
[1:02:28] grown and brought to a maturity in this

[1:02:36] been in the field the prophet has left
[1:02:38] the scene hallelujah and they have been
[1:02:41] in the field and now the last part of
[1:02:44] the field is left and we are gleaning
[1:02:47] now

[1:02:56] our last trumpet has sounded
[1:02:59] and the bible tells us at the last trump

[1:03:20] is still in the air
[1:03:23] it's still in the atmosphere right now

[1:03:29] but i can hear it in my soul
[1:03:32] i can hear the reverberations
[1:03:35] of it in my soul amen and that trumpet
[1:03:39] is going to keep sounding
[1:03:42] it will keep on sounding what's it

[1:03:48] is waiting for the last one to come in
[1:03:52] and get into their position hallelujah

[1:05:14] then fall asleep
[1:05:15] what will happen
[1:05:17] that last trumpet has to blast forth
[1:05:21] and what it does
[1:05:23] the same time is when the last angel
[1:05:27] is giving his message
[1:05:30] and the last seal opens at that time
[1:05:34] when does the last trump sound when the
[1:05:36] last seal is open when the last angel is
[1:05:40] sending his message amen and the last
[1:05:43] trumpet will sound hallelujah and then
[1:05:47] the redeemer himself comes forth and
[1:05:50] starts to take his redeemed possessions
[1:05:55] lord of god i believe he's here right
[1:05:57] now
[1:05:58] i said i believe he's here amen
[1:06:01] i believe the redeemer is here to claim

[1:06:09] has redeemed with his own blood lord of
[1:06:11] god amen that's what's going on now
[1:06:16] we're not conditioned where he's calling

[1:06:24] his own word

[1:06:31] the whole creation
[1:06:33] now lays in his hands
[1:06:36] amen the whole plan of redemption

[1:06:43] those mysterious seals of revelation
[1:06:46] it's now open
[1:06:48] amen and he alone can reveal it to whom
[1:06:53] so ever he
[1:06:55] wants to reveal it to
[1:07:00] a lot of people think because they have
[1:07:02] the prophet's message that's the
[1:07:04] revelation
[1:07:06] that's just the outside of the
[1:07:08] outside of the revelation amen oh my
[1:07:11] that's the outside of it amen but thank
[1:07:14] god now it's come down to its salvation
[1:07:18] is an individual affair
[1:07:21] now it comes down to him revealing to
[1:07:24] the individual
[1:07:26] the revelation
[1:07:28] of the inside of this message
[1:07:31] by the holy spirit amen and no one else
[1:07:36] can receive it but those who have been
[1:07:39] elected by him amen yes sir and let me
[1:07:44] tell you
[1:07:46] it's sealed by seven seals of mystery
[1:07:50] because it is the book of redemption

[1:07:55] in that book is the names of all the
[1:07:57] elect
[1:07:58] hallelujah oh my do you know if god
[1:08:03] didn't reveal who you are to you before
[1:08:06] the time you might even destroy your own
[1:08:09] self or the devil would destroy you
[1:08:13] completely because he knew that you are
[1:08:16] one of them
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:19] that last trumpet blowing
[1:08:23] amen
[1:08:24] oh
[1:08:25] and when it blows
[1:08:27] we'll all
[1:08:29] be caught up
[1:08:30] to meet him
[1:08:32] in the air there's a lot of
[1:08:33] misconceptions and misunderstanding of
[1:08:36] people when they read the bible and the
[1:08:38] word of god what god is really saying
[1:08:41] they start taking all these pentecostal
[1:08:45] uh ideas and imaginations that all at
[1:08:47] once you're gonna start rising and going
[1:08:50] up in the air wearing a nice white gown
[1:08:53] or something of the other but the bible
[1:08:56] is telling us something
[1:08:58] different to that that's right here in
[1:09:02] the word of god amen think of it you are
[1:09:06] going to meet the lord in the air

[1:09:23] praise god think about it brother when
[1:09:26] that last trumpet sounds what he's
[1:09:28] saying there

[1:09:32] that you're gonna enter into a next
[1:09:34] dimension and they can't see in that
[1:09:37] dimension it's not that you're gone
[1:09:40] you're still you're going back in other

[1:09:44] originally were you go back to be that
[1:09:47] spirit person you were originally were
[1:09:50] and they can't see you anymore in that
[1:09:54] position

[1:09:57] days like them saints back in the new
[1:09:59] testament you're going to be around amen

[1:16:52] ghost
[1:16:54] and how the church should move up
[1:16:57] amen
[1:16:59] but
[1:17:00] those who were moving
[1:17:02] refused to walk in the light they

[1:17:12] that sixth trumpet opened
[1:17:14] and the holy spirit baptism fell
[1:17:18] and they're supposed to move up away
[1:17:20] from that
[1:17:22] and into this message and they refuse
[1:17:26] to move away from it and went back
[1:17:30] and then
[1:17:32] a plague
[1:17:33] was opened
[1:17:35] a plague

[1:20:19] or what we would be like
[1:20:22] we are here today in this manner amen
[1:20:26] but much more after we're gone
[1:20:29] our bodies may blow to the four winds
[1:20:33] of the earth
[1:20:35] hallelujah but the holy spirit who has
[1:20:39] now embraced us lord of god he's claimed
[1:20:42] you to be his own
[1:20:44] because you believe this lord you
[1:20:47] receive his revelation and now the one
[1:20:50] that was brooding over the earth now
[1:20:52] embraces his own praise the lord god
[1:20:55] hallelujah amen and though your bodies
[1:20:59] blow with the winds to the far winds of
[1:21:01] the earth
[1:21:02] you see the word brooding he pauses here
[1:21:06] it means he is now
[1:21:09] making love to his church
[1:21:12] amen and when the holy spirit
[1:21:15] came down the first
[1:21:17] to the natural
[1:21:19] he made love to the calcium
[1:21:22] and the potash
[1:21:24] and the petroleums
[1:21:25] of the earth
[1:21:27] so that he can form it
[1:21:31] hallelujah you understand
[1:21:33] creation the spirit man and then he had
[1:21:36] to make the second man
[1:21:38] the by formation

[1:21:43] he's telling us how that creation took
[1:21:46] place
[1:21:48] and forming it amen together so he could
[1:21:52] make a human being
[1:21:55] out of it hallelujah and then the spirit
[1:21:59] man hallelujah could go into that human
[1:22:03] that body that god had formed by his
[1:22:07] grace amen and then
[1:22:10] it in return
[1:22:12] as a human
[1:22:14] that human being in return turns back
[1:22:17] around
[1:22:18] and begins to recognize him
[1:22:22] we begin to recognize him
[1:22:25] and what he has done for you
[1:22:28] and his love towards you
[1:22:31] and we make love back to him

[1:22:57] of a faith all fear is taken away from

[1:23:03] but i got no more fears
[1:23:06] i got no more fears

[1:23:11] going to hell and all this kind of thing
[1:23:14] backsliding and all that stuff all my
[1:23:17] fears are taken away amen

[1:23:37] believer amen praise god hallelujah all
[1:23:41] your fears are taken away
[1:23:43] amen they could even bury you in the sea
[1:23:48] but that trumpet will wake you up amen

[1:23:54] or what takes place you are going to
[1:23:57] come forth from the dust amen hallelujah
[1:24:00] we're not talking only he's not talking
[1:24:02] only about that dust down there if
[1:24:04] they'll get buried he's talking about
[1:24:06] right now all the dust you're here among
[1:24:09] millions and millions of every human
[1:24:11] being and no matter how far you might
[1:24:13] have wander away from the way your
[1:24:16] father's way like a prodigal daughter or
[1:24:18] son when that trumpet sounds it calls
[1:24:21] you back to yourself and wakes you up to
[1:24:24] who you already are and you recognize
[1:24:26] him that he is the same yesterday today
[1:24:29] and forever
[1:24:30] oh my the trumpet is sounding oh praise
[1:24:34] god that comes from the hebrews chapter
[1:24:36] 1 amen 1957 but it says here in uh why
[1:24:42] the message why
[1:24:44] someday
[1:24:46] this trumpet
[1:24:48] that sounded
[1:24:50] hallelujah
[1:24:52] will sound for the last time
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:57] then the bible
[1:24:58] will all be closed
[1:25:01] and lay on the altar
[1:25:03] all them mimics
[1:25:06] amen you know all them who trying to
[1:25:07] mimic this
[1:25:09] amen you can put on all the message
[1:25:11] clothes you can dress
[1:25:13] right which is good we should do that
[1:25:15] but there are a lot of mimics
[1:25:18] amen god doesn't have a cookie cut to
[1:25:22] christianity
[1:25:24] amen hallelujah oh this brother this
[1:25:27] that sister that this other one that now
[1:25:30] we are not here amen for that purpose
[1:25:35] because god is a master potter
[1:25:39] god is the great greatest of all artists
[1:25:43] he never made one thing twice
[1:25:47] every single thing is unique
[1:25:50] that's why paul is false and his
[1:25:52] foolishness for anyone of you to compare
[1:25:55] yourself with another person
[1:26:01] even though they look like twins
[1:26:04] they are not in the eyes of god they are
[1:26:06] individuals
[1:26:08] and they're made different hallelujah
[1:26:11] to think god saw great brother branham
[1:26:13] said every single blade of grass
[1:26:16] different
[1:26:17] every single
[1:26:19] snowflake different even the scientists
[1:26:22] know that that the snowflakes everyone
[1:26:25] different
[1:26:26] oh my think of a being that knows that
[1:26:30] from every single part of the entire
[1:26:33] creation from biology to zoology to
[1:26:36] exist to that anthropology whatever
[1:26:38] everyone different because he is the
[1:26:42] great master of it all hallelujah
[1:26:46] oh my think of it
[1:26:48] the sun will be setting in the west
[1:26:52] all
[1:26:53] the armaments will be stacked
[1:26:56] and then
[1:26:57] as the song i love to sing
[1:27:00] what then
[1:27:03] what then
[1:27:05] oh praise god
[1:27:08] think of it
[1:27:10] john was in the spirit when
[1:27:12] in the last day
[1:27:14] praise god i hope john gets in the
[1:27:17] spirit again in this last day
[1:27:20] john types the bride amen us she gets in
[1:27:24] the spirit praise god hallelujah oh
[1:27:28] think of it and when he
[1:27:30] was there
[1:27:32] in the spirit
[1:27:34] he was transferred
[1:27:37] by the holy spirit
[1:27:39] into the lord's day
[1:27:41] amen oh my
[1:27:43] over into the lord's day and soon as he
[1:27:47] got over there
[1:27:49] once he got there
[1:27:50] he could hear
[1:27:52] a trumpet
[1:27:55] what is that
[1:27:56] why did that trumpet sound
[1:27:59] see that trumpet sounded because some
[1:28:03] great one is approaching
[1:28:07] some great person he said is coming on
[1:28:11] the scene
[1:28:13] somebody
[1:28:14] is coming
[1:28:16] and
[1:28:17] he heard the voice
[1:28:20] but the trumpet had a voice
[1:28:22] hallelujah saying
[1:28:25] i am alpha
[1:28:27] and omega first and the last hallelujah
[1:28:31] i am not first second party third party
[1:28:34] fourth party i am alpha and omega
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:40] before i tell you anything else brother
[1:28:43] i'm speaking here show you anything i
[1:28:45] want to let you know first of all you
[1:28:48] must know who i am
[1:28:51] you see that principle right there
[1:28:52] you'll understand it clearer when he
[1:28:54] himself says it here
[1:28:56] think of it
[1:28:59] the greatest of all revelations
[1:29:03] we will ever have
[1:29:05] is the revelation
[1:29:07] of the deity the supreme deity
[1:29:12] of our lord jesus christ
[1:29:15] some of us sitting in here thinks that's
[1:29:16] the simplest
[1:29:18] you see that's how god always works
[1:29:21] he makes you think the thing you think
[1:29:24] is foolishness the stupidness is the
[1:29:27] simplest thing oh anybody can get that
[1:29:30] that he says that is the greatest
[1:29:33] revelation you will ever have in your
[1:29:37] entire life
[1:29:40] the supreme deity
[1:29:42] of jesus christ
[1:29:45] our lord hallelujah
[1:29:48] because
[1:29:50] you can't even get to first base
[1:29:55] if you can't receive that
[1:29:59] you can't even get the in other words
[1:30:01] the rest of the veil is not going to
[1:30:02] open up to you
[1:30:04] nothing else is going to open up to you
[1:30:06] nothing else is going to be revealed to
[1:30:08] you if you can't even get past the
[1:30:11] supreme deity of jesus christ
[1:30:14] i've heard preachers say
[1:30:16] brother simon why why you um you sound
[1:30:20] so simple when you preach
[1:30:23] and
[1:30:24] well some of you may say it's deep but a
[1:30:26] lot of people think it's simple
[1:30:28] because they just get the outward part
[1:30:30] of it and they think oh you're just
[1:30:32] talking about the deity of jesus christ
[1:30:34] oh you just talk about brother branham
[1:30:36] you just mentioned about the prophet why
[1:30:37] you have to talk about that so often
[1:30:40] they don't understand they have not
[1:30:43] caught that original ingredient of the
[1:30:46] revelation that it all starts from there
[1:30:50] and if you don't go in there and get
[1:30:53] that you will not be able to break out
[1:30:56] into all that god has in store for you
[1:30:58] amen
[1:31:00] the first thing you have to know
[1:31:04] is the deity
[1:31:05] of jesus christ amen
[1:31:08] i am a to z
[1:31:10] there's no more and nothing else but me
[1:31:13] see i was at the beginning
[1:31:17] i will be there at the end
[1:31:19] i am he that this is brother branham
[1:31:22] speaking amen you might have been
[1:31:24] hearing his voice but you ought to know
[1:31:26] by now who is speaking through him
[1:31:28] and saying
[1:31:29] i
[1:31:30] am alpha i am omega i there's no nothing
[1:31:35] else but me
[1:31:36] i was at the beginning i will be at the
[1:31:40] end i am he that was which is and shall
[1:31:44] come
[1:31:45] i am the almighty
[1:31:47] think of it that is what the trumpet
[1:31:51] said
[1:31:52] amen oh be careful john
[1:31:55] be careful bride
[1:31:57] be careful
[1:31:58] you're entering into the spirit now

[1:32:03] revealed to you when you're in that
[1:32:06] spirit
[1:32:07] a trumpet shall sound
[1:32:10] amen amen
[1:32:12] all the great revelations
[1:32:15] made known
[1:32:17] oh
[1:32:18] i am alpha but i am also omega
[1:32:22] amen that's the first thing
[1:32:25] and the last thing

[1:32:58] approaching and has approached us by the
[1:33:01] opening of this word and the opening of

[1:44:50] speed of light he said and there there
[1:44:53] were he said but the funny thing the one

[1:44:58] like a bomber oh my goodness oh god he
[1:45:02] says that was not a man from earth that
[1:45:05] was the lord from heaven

[1:46:03] the church of leodisia he said to the
[1:46:06] angel of the church of ephesus these
[1:46:08] were all messengers of the earth see
[1:46:13] they are men they are messengers they
[1:46:16] may be prophets and so forth they were
[1:46:19] sent to the church but this one doesn't
[1:46:23] come from the earth amen see he doesn't

[1:46:37] and when he opens his mouth when he says
[1:46:40] time shall be no more and he speaks out
[1:46:44] the seven thunders throughout their
[1:46:46] voices

[1:49:18] hallelujah praise god amen i don't
[1:49:22] intend to leave any more of this over to
[1:49:24] next week so just leave me alone and let
[1:49:26] me preach the word of god is that all
[1:49:28] right
[1:49:31] hallelujah
[1:49:33] amen
[1:49:34] oh listen what he says
[1:49:36] now a trumpet you know
[1:49:38] always denotes
[1:49:41] a war beginning
[1:49:43] oh my
[1:49:44] or else it may speak of a political
[1:49:48] disturbance
[1:49:50] the trumpet sounds and it causes a war
[1:49:55] amen oh my
[1:49:57] now if someone was to get to messing
[1:50:01] around with politics
[1:50:04] then they are going to mess everything
[1:50:08] up all around them
[1:50:10] like we got it now
[1:50:13] everything messed up in politics around
[1:50:16] us
[1:50:17] and when you see that happening
[1:50:20] watch out
[1:50:22] there is a war at hand
[1:50:25] natural
[1:50:26] and spiritual
[1:50:29] there is a war at hand
[1:50:31] because you see
[1:50:33] this kingdom this earthly kingdom still
[1:50:37] belongs to satan how many knows he's the
[1:50:40] god of this evil age
[1:50:43] right
[1:50:44] oh my he still got a part of it in his
[1:50:48] hand
[1:50:49] because
[1:50:50] we were redeemed by christ out of it
[1:50:54] but he has the rest of it
[1:50:56] under his control
[1:50:59] for he is the god of this earth amen see
[1:51:03] my he is now he is
[1:51:07] the lord is the kinsman redeemer and he
[1:51:09] is taking his subjects and the last one
[1:51:14] the last name
[1:51:16] that was put on the book hallelujah
[1:51:21] that name
[1:51:22] is being called out by the last trumpet
[1:51:25] amen so that's why you got to have the
[1:51:27] last trumpet got the sound
[1:51:30] blast
[1:51:31] and then the sound goes on and goes on
[1:51:35] and on until it dies out
[1:51:38] right it's going on right now
[1:51:41] until it dies out but before it dies
[1:52:50] it was even kept a secret from the
[1:52:54] angels oh
[1:52:56] think of this i want you to listen close
[1:52:59] why
[1:53:01] why was that
[1:53:03] if satan could have gotten a hold of
[1:53:06] that
[1:53:07] he might be able to do great damage to
[1:53:12] the kingdom
[1:53:14] amen
[1:53:15] but that is one thing he don't know
[1:53:19] he can't
[1:53:20] interpret it
[1:53:23] thank god for that aren't you happy for
[1:53:24] that what you have received by
[1:53:28] revelation he can't
[1:53:31] interpret it
[1:53:33] and i'm going to now say some other
[1:53:35] things where he said other places where
[1:53:38] he says you he
[1:53:40] misinterpret this
[1:53:43] dislocate
[1:53:44] this
[1:53:45] he can't do it at all he can't misplace
[1:53:50] the word and shift it around like he did
[1:53:52] with eve to deceive the true believer
[1:53:57] he cannot do it whatsoever praise god oh
[1:54:01] my think of it he don't know it he can't
[1:54:04] interpret interpret it and not only that
[1:54:08] this one
[1:54:11] he cannot
[1:54:13] impersonate it
[1:54:15] amen he can't impersonate it
[1:54:18] look all the christian trappings
[1:54:21] all the dress
[1:54:23] all the doing everything perfectly the
[1:54:26] devil can do all of that that's right
[1:54:28] amen he could show patience he could
[1:54:31] show love he can show all them fruits of
[1:54:33] the spirit and he might be able to show
[1:54:34] them better than you
[1:54:36] he said that he said those christian
[1:54:38] science and a lot of those groups he
[1:54:40] said they can display some of those
[1:54:42] virtues better than you
[1:54:45] amen so you got to realize that it's not
[1:54:49] going to take you to produce no virtues
[1:54:52] and produce no fruits it's not it's
[1:54:54] going to take you to be doing that but
[1:54:57] the lord himself
[1:54:59] has to be in you
[1:55:01] and he himself is going to begin to live
[1:55:03] his life through you
[1:55:05] and that will produce perfection of
[1:55:07] perfection
[1:55:09] hallelujah you are perfect
[1:55:12] in christ
[1:55:13] [Applause]
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:16] you're not perfect in your flesh
[1:55:18] but you're perfect in christ
[1:55:21] christ in you is your hope for glory
[1:55:26] [Applause]
[1:55:28] any kind of a gift you know we had like
[1:55:30] that we had
[1:55:31] one person pass through here with a kind
[1:55:33] of gift that could say oh uh similar
[1:55:36] where you can say oh when when we walk
[1:55:38] the road up that side on such and such
[1:55:41] there's a street up there and he's never
[1:55:43] been in the area name so and so there's
[1:55:46] going to be a clock there and the time
[1:55:48] is going to be
[1:55:50] and the brothers would go and there
[1:55:52] would be the thing
[1:55:54] and he had those kinds of gifts
[1:55:57] but then he come to preach
[1:55:59] and while he's preaching suddenly the
[1:56:00] holy spirit said
[1:56:03] he's a homosexual
[1:56:07] he didn't tell the truth
[1:56:10] he's exposed
[1:56:13] amen
[1:56:15] i know what i'm saying when i'm saying
[1:56:16] it and it's going on on the table
[1:56:19] because it's the truth
[1:56:22] amen
[1:56:24] and
[1:56:25] of course i called him to it and it was
[1:56:26] proven so uh and uh
[1:56:30] of course
[1:56:31] two weeks later the rcmpr is there to
[1:56:34] see me they got him and took him into
[1:56:35] jail
[1:56:36] and he denied and that's the reason why
[1:56:38] i told him nope you stop preaching and
[1:56:41] you don't you don't come back
[1:56:43] and uh they sent him to jail
[1:56:46] and then i was called years later and
[1:56:49] said hey you know that guy that we
[1:56:51] caught and this and that he's done the
[1:56:54] same thing again and we put him back in
[1:56:55] jail again and this time he's gone for
[1:56:57] good
[1:56:59] so i want you to know the devil could
[1:57:02] impersonate
[1:57:03] these gifts
[1:57:05] a lot of this stuff a lot of people
[1:57:07] think oh brother branham had all these
[1:57:08] gifts and he was used of god and he did
[1:57:10] that the only thing about the prophet
[1:57:12] they can't impersonate is the revealing
[1:57:15] and opening of this world
[1:57:19] maybe you won't see one yet that
[1:57:22] can in person can impersonate the things
[1:57:25] that you see in the prophet's life but
[1:57:27] those gifts and those things
[1:57:30] there's people out there there's there's
[1:57:32] men in africa right now with such kinds
[1:57:36] of gifts that
[1:57:37] 25 000 people going to their churches
[1:57:40] and they they're going around with
[1:57:42] people carrying them on trolls
[1:57:45] raising the dead and all kinds of stuff
[1:57:48] and the prime minister and this and that
[1:57:50] the presidents and governments are going
[1:57:53] in there because they are literally
[1:57:55] actually seeing the miracles
[1:57:58] they're seeing it so if those things are
[1:58:00] going to deceive you that that's what
[1:58:03] it's all about you're going to be
[1:58:04] carried away but this is not about that
[1:58:07] god we're gonna have that yes we're
[1:58:09] gonna have those things but our prime
[1:58:12] purpose and our eyes are looking away to
[1:58:15] jesus and jesus alone
[1:58:20] hallelujah amen think of it
[1:58:24] if satan couldn't get a hold of that
[1:58:26] praise god amen now i hope you are
[1:58:31] learning something here
[1:58:33] the devil don't know this
[1:58:37] this it's not even written in the world
[1:58:40] it is a total secret
[1:58:44] what
[1:58:44] it's a spiritual revelation that's why
[1:58:47] it's a total secret
[1:58:49] amen other word it's now you know how
[1:58:53] revelation comes
[1:58:55] it comes like out of nowhere
[1:58:57] all of a sudden there's nothing there
[1:58:59] all sun is there
[1:59:00] in you praise the lord and that battles
[1:59:03] the devil
[1:59:04] it befuddles him
[1:59:07] it messes up with his mind he doesn't
[1:59:09] know what to do about it amen think of
[1:59:13] it all the angels shut up everything
[1:59:16] stopped
[1:59:17] seven is god's perfect number
[1:59:19] amen seven thunders
[1:59:22] voice of the trumpet amen
[1:59:25] and god was saying something
[1:59:29] jesus never spoke it
[1:59:31] john couldn't write it
[1:59:32] the devil the angels did not
[1:59:35] what is it
[1:59:37] amen
[1:59:38] only those whom god
[1:59:42] would know it amen
[1:59:44] on whomsoever
[1:59:46] he would
[1:59:48] reveal it to praise god hear that
[1:59:51] whomsoever he would reveal it to praise
[1:59:54] the lord
[1:59:58] amen
[1:59:59] praise god hallelujah oh my well there's
[2:00:03] the evidence praise god you see it right
[2:00:05] there hallelujah he's doing everything
[2:00:07] that he can to shut this down if he can
[2:00:10] my think about it brother sister praise
[2:00:14] god trying to get some stuff washed and
[2:00:17] ready and everything else while i'm
[2:00:19] preparing uh and getting this ready and
[2:00:22] all of a sudden my dryer breaks down
[2:00:25] i have to leave that and run to try to
[2:00:27] see what you see that's what the devil's
[2:00:29] job but i'm here to do this for the
[2:00:32] glory of god
[2:00:33] [Applause]
[2:00:36] hallelujah
[2:00:37] praise god satan will try to impersonate
[2:00:42] everything
[2:00:44] the church will do
[2:00:48] he will also
[2:00:51] try to do it
[2:00:53] everything
[2:00:54] outwardly everything
[2:00:56] praise god
[2:00:58] so you can't even look with your eyes
[2:01:00] now a lot of people say they got
[2:01:02] discernment a lot of people say they
[2:01:04] have this and all it is is human
[2:01:06] knowledge
[2:01:07] of observation
[2:01:09] and they're using that and calling that
[2:01:11] discernment they don't know what real
[2:01:13] discernment is
[2:01:14] they don't understand is that you don't
[2:01:16] know nothing and then all of a sudden
[2:01:18] whatever however deals with you i don't
[2:01:21] know but with me i'll her hear that
[2:01:23] speak and say no that is so-and-so
[2:01:26] that is this
[2:01:28] oh my and then if you have confidence
[2:01:31] enough and years enough obeying that
[2:01:34] then you'll act upon the word of god
[2:01:37] so you see the devil don't know nothing
[2:01:38] about that when that's made known to you
[2:01:41] until after you act on it and it's over
[2:01:43] it's done there's nothing he can do
[2:01:45] about it amen praise god so he'll try to
[2:01:49] impersonate it
[2:01:50] but they cannot imp he cannot
[2:01:53] impersonate this
[2:01:55] and there will be no mimics to this
[2:01:58] because he don't know it
[2:02:01] and there is no way for him to know it
[2:02:05] for it is the sword pull
[2:02:10] do you hear what the third pull is
[2:02:13] all the stuff about speaking on arms and
[2:02:15] and calling down stuff like that yes we
[2:02:19] will be able to do that as god directs
[2:02:22] us but that's not the real
[2:02:25] central core of it
[2:02:28] that's not the real central core of the
[2:02:30] matter
[2:02:31] he knows
[2:02:32] nothing about that
[2:02:34] he doesn't even understand it
[2:02:38] of what it really is
[2:02:40] for the secret lays beneath that
[2:02:44] amen i can't even think the rest of my
[2:02:48] life i can't see
[2:02:50] what i've seen
[2:02:52] i don't know what
[2:02:54] and i don't even know how to interpret
[2:02:58] what i see for he said stop
[2:03:03] go no further
[2:03:05] than right there where you are
[2:03:08] i am not prone to be a fanatic
[2:03:11] but i am just telling you the truth this
[2:03:14] is what brother branham said in the
[2:03:16] message called the seventh seal
[2:03:20] 1963. why this thing was now to be
[2:03:24] revealed now by the angel himself to the
[2:03:26] individual
[2:03:29] and between the angel to the individual
[2:03:32] it is a total secret
[2:03:36] and the thief is stealing away his bride
[2:03:40] in the middle of the night
[2:03:42] by the opening of his word
[2:03:45] making them prisoners
[2:03:47] to himself
[2:03:49] amen praise the lord i got a little bit
[2:03:52] more
[2:03:53] it's just one o'clock now
[2:03:56] give me a break let me preach the word
[2:03:59] here praise the lord hallelujah
[2:04:02] how perfect is this land
[2:04:05] the seventh trumpet
[2:04:07] the seventh seal
[2:04:09] it will also bring on the persecution of
[2:04:14] the jews
[2:04:16] brothers is this hard for any one of us
[2:04:18] here to go and prophesy
[2:04:21] the prophet already said it there
[2:04:24] when that last when that seven trumpet
[2:04:27] sounds
[2:04:29] and when that seventh seal breaks
[2:04:31] then it will be followed up now by the
[2:04:34] persecution of the jews is coming
[2:04:36] shortly after that
[2:04:38] amen praise god well because we could
[2:04:41] say a lot more stuff there but watch i
[2:04:44] want to go him revelation 9
[2:04:47] 13 he says here that sixth trumpet at
[2:04:50] the sixth trumpet two hundred thousand
[2:04:53] horsemen
[2:04:55] that were bound in the river euphrates
[2:04:58] amen
[2:04:59] were turned loose
[2:05:00] [Music]
[2:05:02] but there's not two hundred thousand
[2:05:04] horsemen
[2:05:06] anywhere in the world armies in the
[2:05:09] present modern armies you ain't got no
[2:05:11] 200 000
[2:05:13] horsemen um anywhere see
[2:05:16] because there wasn't natural horses
[2:05:21] they breeded fire
[2:05:23] their blessed plates were jasper they
[2:05:25] had tails like a scorpion like a serpent
[2:05:29] their tails had the shape of a snake's
[2:05:31] head
[2:05:33] and it was stinging
[2:05:35] there were spiritual horses
[2:05:38] spiritual devils chargers that were
[2:05:41] bound at the river euphrates
[2:05:44] what was it
[2:05:46] not only the persecution of the jews but
[2:05:50] the old pagan roman empire
[2:05:54] now being revived
[2:05:57] the whoa my think of it what we're in
[2:05:59] the midst of here you know how many
[2:06:01] things are going on rapture going in
[2:06:03] progress the old roman empire now coming
[2:06:06] back and beginning to revive itself
[2:06:09] coming back mr babylon about to make
[2:06:11] itself manifest and when it does it will
[2:06:14] begin to do the same thing it did back
[2:06:16] there it threw the jews out of the city
[2:06:20] of rome and excluded them and persecuted
[2:06:23] them out and then it started on the
[2:06:25] christians and that is what he's talking
[2:06:28] about it'll do the very same thing all
[2:06:31] over again
[2:06:33] amen praise god hallelujah oh praise god
[2:06:38] see
[2:06:39] them
[2:06:40] horsemen
[2:06:42] at the river them devils were bound
[2:06:45] there
[2:06:46] because they could not cross
[2:06:51] from
[2:06:52] from where they are
[2:06:54] amen they couldn't cross from where they
[2:06:56] are to the other side that they may
[2:06:59] know the promise
[2:07:02] and they can't cross over
[2:07:04] from just this message
[2:07:07] of just the bible
[2:07:09] and of
[2:07:11] the written word
[2:07:12] they can't cross over from there
[2:07:16] into the fullness
[2:07:17] of the revelation
[2:07:20] and that's why they're literally bound
[2:07:24] he says brother branham said in the next
[2:07:26] place when i speak about bound when i
[2:07:29] say satan is bound
[2:07:31] i'm saying he is bound by chains of
[2:07:35] circumstances
[2:07:37] he's bound by the conditions he's under
[2:07:39] he can't do nothing about it he's got to
[2:07:42] stay on that side of the river he can't
[2:07:44] enter in the promised land of the
[2:07:46] opening of the fullness of the revealed
[2:07:50] word and if you want to read the rest of
[2:07:53] this you'll find it in the feast of the
[2:07:55] trumpets
[2:07:56] 1964
[2:07:58] where he says them devils that were
[2:08:00] bound for 2000 years started riding and
[2:08:04] started riding through stalin and using
[2:08:06] hitler and them to kill and murder
[2:08:10] millions oh my you said brother branham
[2:08:12] that isn't roman that isn't roman oh he
[2:08:16] said but it's the same spirit
[2:08:20] see
[2:08:20] that done the same things back there to
[2:08:24] the jews and christians in all pagan
[2:08:27] roman days
[2:08:28] amen now watch what will happen to
[2:08:32] natural israel
[2:08:33] and what will happen to the spiritual
[2:08:36] church of today
[2:08:38] as we separate it
[2:08:40] amen they're being turned loose again
[2:08:44] upon the jews remember
[2:08:47] those six seals with the martyrs and
[2:08:49] everything else they receive
[2:08:52] ropes
[2:08:53] by grace
[2:08:55] because they were blinded so that we
[2:08:58] could see it amen they cannot see this
[2:09:01] gospel now
[2:09:03] but god did that so he might call out
[2:09:06] the people from among the gentiles the
[2:09:08] bride call out the bride from the
[2:09:11] gentiles and so
[2:09:13] because of that they were given robes
[2:09:17] amen
[2:09:18] and tear under that trumpet the jews who
[2:09:22] we know are absolutely against christ
[2:09:25] and absolutely against everything but
[2:09:27] the reason why they are is because the
[2:09:31] bible says
[2:09:32] that he allowed them to be blinded
[2:09:35] and they were blinded
[2:09:37] for our sake
[2:09:39] and god knows that they
[2:09:42] that that they would
[2:09:44] would have received it but he made them
[2:09:48] blind
[2:09:49] for our sake
[2:09:51] oh thank god that the trumpet the last
[2:09:54] trump has sound sounded
[2:09:57] and we are being given understanding of
[2:10:00] this call to the resurrection
[2:10:03] the call to this great rapture that is
[2:10:06] now
[2:10:07] in progress amen hallelujah we are
[2:10:11] having the last wrong call now
[2:10:13] praise god i'm winding this up now at
[2:10:15] this point and the redeemed are
[2:10:18] gathering in
[2:10:20] coming from the east and from the west
[2:10:22] in the natural world many people are
[2:10:25] fighting and resisting the changes that
[2:10:28] have taken places in society because the
[2:10:30] whole world is becoming mixed up and all
[2:10:34] the nations and races are all being
[2:10:36] mixed in and the people they don't
[2:10:38] understand what's happening and they're
[2:10:40] fighting and fighting and everything
[2:10:42] else not realizing that
[2:10:45] god allowing this to happen it's
[2:10:47] happening also in the spiritual realm
[2:10:49] that this has taken place but god is
[2:10:52] gathering his elect
[2:10:54] east west north south they're gathering
[2:10:56] in
[2:10:57] washed like the snow and free from all
[2:10:59] sin hallelujah amen the trumpet is
[2:11:03] sounding
[2:11:04] musicians come and they they the troops
[2:11:08] are being mustered and called to
[2:11:10] formation praise god
[2:11:14] and i want you to bear this in mind
[2:11:16] inspection
[2:11:18] is now going on
[2:11:21] the holy spirit
[2:11:23] is the officer
[2:11:25] and he is going down all the troops
[2:11:28] everyone
[2:11:30] and is checking us
[2:11:32] one by one
[2:11:35] searching us

[2:11:41] the final google call is in the air
[2:11:46] the last post
[2:11:48] amen
[2:11:49] is sounding in heaven
[2:11:51] brother branham said this is god's last
[2:11:54] altar call
[2:11:55] he said the spirit of god is crying out
[2:11:58] he said the cry goes out but how long
[2:12:02] will the spirit cry

[2:12:13] christ completely to him praise the lord
[2:12:16] hallelujah amen

[2:12:21] when that last trumpet sounds in the
[2:12:24] army
[2:12:25] and the soldiers are told to return to
[2:12:28] their barracks
[2:12:30] then
[2:12:31] it sums out to let them know all
[2:12:35] unauthorized

[2:12:42] any other body that claims they have
[2:12:44] revelation they have light they have
[2:12:45] this light they have that knowledge they
[2:12:47] have that
[2:12:48] god is going to start putting all those
[2:12:51] lights out
[2:12:53] because this is the last post
[2:12:56] amen
[2:12:57] and all unauthorized lights
[2:13:00] have to be put out completely
[2:13:02] so that the true light
[2:13:05] will now shine
[2:13:06] and the bride

[2:16:35] [Music]
[2:16:47] praise god god bless you you may be
[2:16:49] seated for a couple minutes
[2:16:51] danny's got a few announcements he'd
[2:16:52] like to bring
[2:16:57] [Music]
[2:17:06] god bless you saints
[2:17:08] so um just a few announcements it's been
[2:17:11] a while since we've been able to come up
[2:17:13] and give a few announcements i think as
[2:17:15] things are now
[2:17:17] slowly
[2:17:18] trying to get back to normal
[2:17:20] we will do the same by the grace of god
[2:17:23] but just a few reminders on the on the
[2:17:25] sunday services you still require
[2:17:28] registration okay it's required that we
[2:17:30] keep
[2:17:31] a record of every name of every
[2:17:34] individual that attends the services
[2:17:37] we still have all of the protocols in
[2:17:39] place
[2:17:40] with respect to social distancing
[2:17:43] the fact that you need to wear a mask
[2:17:47] that you know
[2:17:48] there's no hugging
[2:17:50] there's no
[2:17:51] you know getting too close you can do
[2:17:54] the bumps you can do the handshakes
[2:17:57] you know when you go outside of the
[2:17:59] church if you want to remove your mask
[2:18:01] that's fine okay but again no hugging
[2:18:05] no you know just going up to somebody
[2:18:07] you know because oh we're all vaccinated
[2:18:09] no we're not maybe some are maybe some
[2:18:12] aren't and that's another note
[2:18:14] you know maybe you aren't vaccinated
[2:18:17] and uh you think that
[2:18:20] i don't need to be vaccinated this is
[2:18:23] you know god is protecting me and i'm
[2:18:26] this and that we're not interested in
[2:18:28] your opinion
[2:18:30] this is not a place where you come
[2:18:33] to uh you know uh try and uh bring
[2:18:35] division because that's a spirited
[2:18:37] division that's what that is
[2:18:39] i'm not saying you got to be vaccinated
[2:18:41] i'm not saying you don't
[2:18:43] have to be vaccinated okay
[2:18:46] but
[2:18:46] it's according to your own faith
[2:18:49] until the government says and sets
[2:18:52] certain legislation that if they say in
[2:18:55] order for you to attend a service you
[2:18:56] must be vaccinated you better be
[2:18:58] vaccinated if you want to come in here
[2:19:01] it's that simple okay
[2:19:04] but if you're not vaccinated
[2:19:06] and you want to come to church that's
[2:19:08] perfectly fine
[2:19:10] but you need to follow all the protocol
[2:19:12] exactly the way it's been set out
[2:19:15] you're not to hug you're not to whether
[2:19:17] you are whether you're not you're not to
[2:19:18] hug and get too close
[2:19:20] and and and push
[2:19:22] you know in any way shape or form this
[2:19:25] is the house of the lord we're not
[2:19:26] looking for any spirits to come in you
[2:19:29] know there's spirits that are moving
[2:19:30] across this message if you're not
[2:19:32] vaccinated you and or if you get the
[2:19:34] kovid you ain't got the holy ghost
[2:19:37] [Laughter]
[2:19:40] that's a lie from the pits of hell
[2:19:43] okay if you don't get the vaccination
[2:19:45] you're gonna die
[2:19:47] people tell me that
[2:19:48] i'm gonna die is that right
[2:19:50] if i don't get it or i'm gonna die if i
[2:19:53] do get it
[2:19:56] what a devil
[2:19:58] it's all lies
[2:19:59] the lord giveth the lord taketh
[2:20:02] he can't take your life unless god says
[2:20:04] you're coming home
[2:20:06] oh this person died from covet because
[2:20:08] they didn't get the vaccination they
[2:20:09] were going to die anyway
[2:20:12] to each
[2:20:14] to everything there is a time and a
[2:20:17] season
[2:20:18] now at the same time we don't want
[2:20:20] people walking in these front doors if
[2:20:22] they got a fever or they're not feeling
[2:20:24] well
[2:20:25] you don't

[2:20:28] if you've got a fever if you've traveled
[2:20:30] outside of the country in the last two
[2:20:32] weeks you can't come
[2:20:35] it's that simple we're following the
[2:20:37] rules
[2:20:38] of the land
[2:20:40] okay but we're not interested in getting
[2:20:42] into controversy
[2:20:45] if you've got faith as a son or a
[2:20:48] daughter of god you know where you stand

[2:22:24] you as individuals to give and to pay
[2:22:27] your tithes as god has given you faith
[2:22:31] as a son or a daughter of god to turn
[2:22:33] around say i don't have to pay tithes

[2:22:40] okay i don't have to give offerings
[2:22:43] yeah you don't technically
[2:22:46] but as a son or a daughter of god
[2:22:49] knowing that it's god that gives to you
[2:22:51] and
[2:22:52] uses you and and works through you
