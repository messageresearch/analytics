[39:11] Thanksgiving and you know uh you can
[39:13] draw from that many different contexts
[39:16] are you being faithful and being
[39:18] thankful and are you a faithful uh
[39:22] revelated son or daughter of God having
[39:24] a true understanding of the Thanksgiving
[39:27] and the gratitude that we have for what
[39:30] God has given us in this day and in this
[39:32] hour amen praise God we should be praise
[39:36] God let us pray before we go to the word

[39:47] hearts this morning we come with one
[39:50] desire Lord and that is to just have
[39:53] that time of fellowship with you Lord
[39:55] where you will will take control Lord
[39:59] that um Lord the the mystery of
[40:01] preaching is uh something that never
[40:04] ceases to amaze us Lord but we we
[40:07] realize that it's it's your gift it's
[40:09] your gifts to this world Lord where you
[40:13] have the opportunity to speak to the
[40:16] needs of your people and Lord the if the
[40:19] people recognize that the gift is
[40:22] something that they operate it makes it
[40:24] even uh greater Lord because now you can
[40:27] answer so many needs all at one time
[40:30] Lord that's what makes you so great so
[40:33] this morning as we assemble Lord we ask
[40:35] your anointing upon the word of God upon
[40:37] the speaker and upon the hearers oh God
[40:40] let your anointing your spirit just take
[40:43] absolute control May the spirit of

[40:50] you put your spirit into that word it
[40:53] becomes life Grant it we pray father

[43:44] understanding and revelation of who you
[43:46] are in the body of Christ amen praise
[43:49] God it's very important for us to have
[43:53] lips of Thanksgiving constantly giving
[43:56] thanks unto the Lord for all of his
[43:59] goodness amen amen praise God I remember
[44:02] you know I I remember when this message
[44:04] came to
[44:05] me I could not believe that God had
[44:09] actually allowed me to recognize his
[44:12] word in in in this day the living word
[44:16] for our day for this hour I could not
[44:19] express the Gratitude I was so grateful
[44:23] every time that we would assemble and

[44:27] couldn't wait to see that man get behind
[44:30] the pulpit you know uh just just full of
[44:33] the the anointing of the Holy Spirit and
[44:36] hear God speak lip to ear to me because
[44:39] I believe that the Holy Spirit was
[44:41] speaking lip to ear I was re I it I knew
[44:45] it was the Holy Spirit speaking lip to
[44:46] ear because he was Discerning my life he
[44:49] was telling me where I came from he was
[44:51] telling me why this was the appointed
[44:54] time and season for you to receive re

[47:48] little better and you know we start to
[47:50] see each other's strengths and each
[47:51] other's weaknesses you know and all of a
[47:54] sudden maybe you know know we're not so
[47:56] thankful for one another sometimes but
[47:59] that that God wants to God wants to blow
[48:02] that out of the water this morning God
[48:05] wants to bring us back into a an
[48:07] attitude of gratitude where we can

[48:12] each other's gifts and each other's
[48:14] blessings and and strengths and and and
[48:17] not look at the
[48:19] weaknesses understand that those
[48:21] weaknesses is what makes God strong amen
[48:24] amen you know what the the opposite of
[48:26] gratitude is
[48:29] pride
[48:31] pride when you're not thankful and
[48:34] you're you don't have a spirit of
[48:35] gratitude you start thinking that the
[48:37] things that are happening in your life
[48:39] is because you did it because you make
[48:42] it happen that's not that's not the
[48:45] spirit of God hallelujah the spirit of
[48:49] God is complete opposite he's he he

[49:07] of Christ amen praise God in everything
[49:11] give thanks for this is the will of God
[49:14] in Christ Jesus concerning you you know
[49:20] that a thankful heart is a powerful
[49:24] weapon when we have a revelation on the
[49:28] attitude of
[49:30] gratitude being grateful for the things
[49:33] that are disrupting and bringing stress
[49:37] and Chaos into our lives when when when
[49:41] we take the power of the oppressor and
[49:44] we take that power of the enemy that
[49:46] oppression and we place it into the
[49:49] hands of God because you're thankful for
[49:52] all things working together for good you
[49:54] know what it does it puts the power of
[49:56] the oppressor into the hands of the
[49:59] Living God and now the power of Christ
[50:03] through a gratitude through a thankful
[50:05] heart starts to take over the situation

[50:49] at everything in our lives and we need
[50:51] to have an attitude of gratitude we need

[53:06] Happiness amen gratitude next slide
[53:09] helps you sleep better yes sir it's true
[53:13] these are these are actual facts you
[53:15] know if you go and see a psychologist he
[53:17] he's going to tell you listen you know
[53:19] what all you've been doing here you've
[53:21] been sitting here for half an hour and
[53:22] all you've been telling me about is all
[53:23] the negative things in your life
[53:25] boy you must not sleep too well you must
[53:28] stay up all night thinking about all the
[53:31] negative things that are happening in
[53:33] your life because you can't possibly
[53:35] sleep well when all you're thinking
[53:38] about is the negative consequences the
[53:40] negative circumstances oh I'm getting
[53:43] old oh I'm feeling pain oh I'm I'm this
[53:46] oh I got to make the bill payment next

[54:00] it makes you
[54:03] grumpy it's
[54:05] true it's the truth that's why it's
[54:08] important to have a thankful attitude
[54:12] Amen to be grateful for all things
[54:15] regardless of what it is amen if you're
[54:19] grateful for the trial it takes the
[54:21] trial out of Satan's hand and puts it
[54:23] into God's hand amen Hallelujah and then
[54:26] all of a sudden you can overcome that
[54:28] thing because you know that God brought
[54:30] it into your life because it's going to
[54:32] work for
[54:34] good next slide gratitude is the anti
[54:39] antidote to toxic emotions you got to
[54:42] watch those emotions you got to watch
[54:44] when the enemy you know the greatest
[54:45] battle ever fought is still going on and
[54:48] it is the enemy attacking your mind and
[54:51] putting thoughts negative thought
[54:54] negative energy
[54:55] oh they looked at me this way they
[54:57] didn't greet me that way they did this
[54:59] they did that oh the boss never looked
[55:01] at me and said good morning to me this
[55:03] morning but he said it good morning to
[55:05] the other one there and all of a sudden
[55:06] you start to get miserable and your
[55:08] co-workers are looking at you and
[55:09] wondering what the heck's wrong with you
[55:12] today it's because you don't have a
[55:14] spirit of gratitude for the job that God
[55:18] gave you amen your boss God can deal
[55:21] with your boss don't worry about your
[55:23] boss God knows to deal with bosses amen
[55:27] praise God but God's working on your
[55:29] attitude God's working because your
[55:31] attitude in in a workpl and I learned
[55:34] this from a young age brother Chris I
[55:36] tell my wife all the time I brag on one
[55:39] boss that I started with back in in in
[55:42] early uh 1979 1980 this man he was a
[55:48] walking
[55:50] positive
[55:52] Revelation he would just speak positive
[55:56] about everything but he would still
[55:58] correct me hard and I couldn't quite
[56:01] understand it but but but all I wanted
[56:04] to do was model his ways of
[56:07] communicating with people and exalting
[56:09] and and praising them and lifting them
[56:11] up when they did right and it was
[56:14] genuine it was real and because of that
[56:17] positive atmosphere it changed my
[56:21] outlook it put me into a positive uh
[56:25] understanding of you know that you know
[56:27] that you can speak positive and what you
[56:30] speak and what you think about all day
[56:32] long is what you'll usually become and
[56:35] it's still true the thoughts that you
[56:37] dwell on and that you allow the enemy to
[56:39] to to put into your heart and cause you
[56:42] to be negative that will never produce a
[56:45] thankful heart that will never produce a
[56:49] right attitude and so I learned from a
[56:51] young age that my attitude would have an
[56:54] effect on my altitude yes in that job
[56:58] yes and from his influence on my life
[57:02] and the grace of God within three years
[57:05] of working in that company I had been
[57:08] promoted to sit at the right hand of the
[57:12] president of the company ordering raw
[57:15] materials for the company at an age of
[57:17] 22 or 21 years old making lots of money
[57:23] my father would say how
[57:26] much it was almost double what he was
[57:29] making and then he thought I was
[57:32] absolutely cuckoo when I left the job
[57:34] two years later to go on my own and lose
[57:37] my
[57:39] shirt that's why she stood beside me all
[57:43] those years she saw that that that
[57:46] entrepreneurial Spirit but she says but
[57:49] you just don't never give up no because
[57:52] I believe that that there is something
[57:55] that if we can hold to it if we can
[57:57] believe because I got into you know
[57:59] positive mental attitude and I I you
[58:01] know I started going to seminars and I
[58:04] said no I'm going to create a life I'm
[58:06] going to be rich I'm going to be a
[58:08] multi-millionaire I had all these
[58:10] Desires in my heart I said I don't care
[58:12] there's a power out there that can
[58:14] create and and you know all those things
[58:16] and it's all true but I didn't have a
[58:18] revelation of who he was I had no
[58:21] Revelation that he had a different plan
[58:22] for my life you had no revelation that
[58:25] God had a plan for your life to be right
[58:27] here fulfilling his word in
[58:31] 2023 amen but God had a plan amen and so
[58:36] your attitude will also have an effect
[58:39] on your altitude your attitude will
[58:42] affect how how how well you do in your
[58:45] business and how you your relationships
[58:48] with your friends and and the people
[58:50] that you are surrounded
[58:52] by gratitude improves relationships
[58:56] there you go it improves relationships

[1:05:31] you out of the chaos do you see what's
[1:05:33] going on out there listen this is not a

[1:05:39] attacked right here 50 years later after
[1:05:42] the young Kapur War back in
[1:05:45] 1973 these are these are things God said

[1:05:51] Israel is God's time piece look at the
[1:05:54] things that are happening look at the

[1:06:13] to be changed in a moment in the

[1:06:20] you're going to be translated out of
[1:06:21] this Dimension by the grace of God not
[1:06:25] because of something you did not because
[1:06:27] of anything that you deserve it's God's
[1:06:29] grace it's God's plan it's God's Plan of
[1:06:32] Redemption amen praise God we Rejoice
[1:06:36] next next Psalm says 118 he says oh give
[1:06:40] thanks unto the Lord for he is good
[1:06:42] because his mercy endureth
[1:06:45] forever you know that was David you know
[1:06:48] you know David you know like you know
[1:06:50] like look you can look back and you can
[1:06:52] look at at you know levels of gratitude

[1:06:59] he would tell the people of Israel he
[1:07:01] would say listen God will provide all of

[1:07:06] that and if you do this then God will

[1:07:39] lot of
[1:07:40] mistakes and I'm so thankful that Lord

[1:10:40] Works to the children of men aren't you
[1:10:46] grateful next
[1:10:48] slide let's move on here how the
[1:10:50] sacrifice of
[1:10:52] Thanksgiving leads leads to
[1:10:55] gratitude develop an
[1:10:58] attitude of
[1:10:59] gratitude next
[1:11:01] slide these are simple
[1:11:04] things these are really simple things
[1:11:06] you know I picked them up you know uh
[1:11:09] Rick Warren um couple of other ministers
[1:11:13] out there you know some really
[1:11:15] interesting thoughts and ways of
[1:11:16] approaching the word of God I appreciate
[1:11:19] them I filter them by the revelation of
[1:11:21] this hour and it becomes a blessing so
[1:11:26] don't be afraid don't be oh I only
[1:11:29] listen to the
[1:11:31] tapes you only listen to the tapes if
[1:11:33] you don't listen to the tapes there you
[1:11:36] know Saints what an hour what an hour
[1:11:40] where the people out there are so
[1:11:43] deceived they God did I I hear
[1:11:45] statements God didn't put a five-fold it
[1:11:48] was the prophet and God there's no
[1:11:51] Prophet than five-fold Ministry and then
[1:11:54] God no it's just the prophet and God
[1:11:56] everything that the prophet said that's
[1:11:58] all you need that's you don't need
[1:12:00] anything else do you know what they're
[1:12:02] saying they're saying that Jesus Christ
[1:12:05] is not the same yesterday today and
[1:12:08] forever in the midst of the people that
[1:12:10] the mighty Angel did not come down in
[1:12:13] 1963 so that the prophet could go off
[1:12:15] the scene we know the prophet and his
[1:12:18] message and every word that he said
[1:12:21] lined up with the word of God
[1:12:24] we're not afraid to say that we've got a
[1:12:26] revelation that it it's it perfectly
[1:12:28] lines up but if you're taking Christ and
[1:12:31] the five-fold ministry which is Christ
[1:12:34] in the five-fold ministry perfecting you
[1:12:37] and me in this day and in this hour if
[1:12:39] you take that out of the equation you're
[1:12:41] saying that Jesus Christ Ministry has
[1:12:43] finished and is only operating in the
[1:12:50] tapes I I can't see it
[1:12:55] it just doesn't even fit in any way
[1:12:58] shape or form do I believe the prophet
[1:13:01] absolutely I could not have come to this
[1:13:03] Revelation without it hallelujah it's
[1:13:07] progressive revelation it's what turned
[1:13:09] the hearts of the fathers back to the
[1:13:11] children the hearts of the children back
[1:13:13] to the faith of the fathers Revelations
[1:13:15] 10:7 the mighty Angel the introduction
[1:13:18] of the mighty Angel brother Brenham was
[1:13:21] the Earthly Angel he's not the Mighty
[1:13:24] Angel Hallelujah he was the one who God
[1:13:27] used his voice that's why they're called
[1:13:29] voice of God Amen Hallelujah glory to
[1:13:32] God we're not we're not saying we don't
[1:13:35] believe the prophet or we don't we don't
[1:13:37] listen we listen I listen to those tapes
[1:13:39] every day amen every single day and I
[1:13:43] get blessed and it it vindicates and it
[1:13:45] confirms the word and God speaks through
[1:13:47] it absolutely but don't tell me that
[1:13:50] there isn't a five-fold Ministry that
[1:13:52] can discern the thoughts and the intents
[1:13:54] of your heart because that's what called
[1:13:57] me it wasn't God's Prophet that called
[1:14:00] me it was Christ himself speaking under
[1:14:04] the inspiration of my pastor calling me
[1:14:08] re revela me by the word of God giving
[1:14:11] me the inspiration but but but it was
[1:14:13] the spirit of God writing the word it's
[1:14:16] always God it's always been Christ amen
[1:14:18] it's never not been Christ it's always
[1:14:20] been Christ so how can you put him in
[1:14:23] into into just lock them up into tapes
[1:14:25] you can't do
[1:14:27] it you can't do

[1:17:46] with
[1:17:47] $1,00 or

[1:17:52] ,000
[1:17:54] it's a bit of a
[1:17:56] sacrifice but not if you've got
[1:17:59] Revelation not if you know that hey wait
[1:18:01] a minute he give me 10 he can give me a
[1:18:06] hundred he could give me a
[1:18:09] million it's not the money it's not the
[1:18:14] amount it's a sacrifice to
[1:18:17] give when somebody only has $2 and they
[1:18:20] put a dollar into that that was what
[1:18:22] Jesus was saying she gave more than
[1:18:25] all because she did it out of a
[1:18:27] sacrifice and a
[1:18:29] revelation of who she was she was
[1:18:32] worshiping who she was giving thanks to

[1:19:31] God is going to bless your sheep God is
[1:19:32] going to bless your flocks he was
[1:19:35] telling them clearly God is going to
[1:19:37] bless you with all these things but he
[1:19:39] said You shall give unto the Lord thy
[1:19:42] God according as the Lord thy God hath
[1:19:45] blessed thee and thou shal Rejoice

[1:20:13] member of the body of Christ who are you
[1:20:16] a part of the household of the body of

[1:20:22] house does it have a place of worship
[1:20:25] does it have expenses yes it does all
[1:20:28] those things are part of the body of
[1:20:30] Christ and we need to have an
[1:20:32] understanding and a revelation of giving
[1:20:35] back to God what he has given to
[1:20:38] us it's a part of our Thanksgiving
[1:20:42] praise unto the Lord Psalms 116 177 says

[1:25:00] for you God wants to use you God wants
[1:25:03] to bless you God wants to use you to

[1:26:59] to come to church they just want to
[1:27:01] maybe sometime just pay their tithes and
[1:27:02] their offerings but they don't want to
[1:27:04] fellowship with the Lord they don't want
[1:27:07] that personal walk with God you know
[1:27:09] Communion next slide it says in 1
[1:27:11] Corinthians 10:16 it says the cup of
[1:27:14] blessing which we bless is it not the
[1:27:17] communion of the blood of Christ now
[1:27:19] we're not talking about the literal
[1:27:20] blood here we're talking about communion
[1:27:22] in his Spirit communing in his anointed
[1:27:26] Spirit under the revelation of this hour
[1:27:29] feeding on the word of God and allowing
[1:27:31] the spirit of God to revelate you into
[1:27:34] your position as a son or a daughter of
[1:27:36] God Amen the bread which we break is it
[1:27:40] not the communion of the body which is
[1:27:43] the word of God Fellowship around the
[1:27:46] word getting into the word feeding on
[1:27:50] the word getting into into the house of
[1:27:52] the Lord every Wednesday night getting
[1:27:54] into those prayer meetings getting into
[1:27:56] the services on Sundays fellowshipping
[1:27:59] and feasting and pulling on God you know
[1:28:01] that that that that that it's it's it's
[1:28:03] a supernatural act when you come into
[1:28:06] the house of God when you truly have an
[1:28:09] understanding let's move on the next
[1:28:11] slide it says now my title was
[1:28:14] faithful
[1:28:16] Thanksgiving that's the title the lord
[1:28:18] gave me and and I I was saying Lord okay
[1:28:20] but what he was telling me was that you
[1:28:23] need to be full of Faith you need to
[1:28:26] have a revelation of
[1:28:28] Thanksgiving you need to you need to
[1:28:30] move into my thoughts and my mind and my
[1:28:34] my spirit because the spirit gives life
[1:28:37] to the word of God and when you come
[1:28:39] under this kind of revelation of true
[1:28:41] Thanksgiving of true gratitude it's
[1:28:44] Faith it's something that God gives you
[1:28:46] listen go to the next slide here he says
[1:28:48] Hebrews 11:6 says but without faith it
[1:28:51] is is impossible to please
[1:28:54] him so we could do all the things that
[1:28:57] we've been saying here we can get into a
[1:28:59] habit of having a a positive attitude
[1:29:01] and and and developing an attitude of
[1:29:04] gratitude and being thankful and and
[1:29:06] saying oh brother I appreciate you I
[1:29:08] thank you and this and that but without
[1:29:10] faith without knowing this message
[1:29:14] without knowing why God called you why
[1:29:17] God called you into this church into
[1:29:20] this message of the hour why are we
[1:29:23] different from the other churches why
[1:29:25] are we different and we are non-
[1:29:28] denominational what is it it's because
[1:29:31] God is a living God all those other
[1:29:34] churches out there we're not saying the
[1:29:36] people it's the systems they've taken
[1:29:39] the word of God and they've they've
[1:29:41] they've organized it they've put their
[1:29:43] own interpretations on the word of God
[1:29:46] when you do that you are pushing God out
[1:29:49] of the church when man starts to say no
[1:29:52] this is how it's got to be this is how
[1:29:54] we worship we believe in a trinity the
[1:29:57] father up there the son over here the
[1:29:59] Holy Ghost over there all three persons
[1:30:01] in one you don't have a revelation of
[1:30:04] who you're giving thanks to now you
[1:30:07] think you're giving thanks to the Living
[1:30:08] God but you're you're deceived you're
[1:30:11] under you know that the scripture says
[1:30:13] that all would be deceived that's right
[1:30:16] all in the last days all would be
[1:30:19] deceived except those whose name were
[1:30:22] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:30:24] before the foundations of the world that
[1:30:27] the whole world would go into a total
[1:30:29] deception you know that that's the
[1:30:30] that's the hour we are in right
[1:30:33] now right now this world is in total
[1:30:37] deception having the mark of the beast
[1:30:39] and not even knowing it because theyve
[1:30:41] they've made God a trinity 95 or 98% of
[1:30:45] the Christian churches out there believe
[1:30:47] in the Trinity where God says I am the
[1:30:51] Lord
[1:30:52] I am one there's none beside me there's
[1:30:56] none behind me there's none before me
[1:30:58] there's none after me I am the Lord thy
[1:31:01] God I am
[1:31:04] one when Jesus was on Earth he the word
[1:31:07] had to become flesh he was made flesh
[1:31:10] and Phillip looked at him and said Lord
[1:31:12] show us the Father and Jesus looked at
[1:31:14] him he said come on Phillip have I not
[1:31:17] been with you so long if you see me
[1:31:19] you're looking at the father amen
[1:31:21] remember remember the scripture the word
[1:31:23] was made flesh in the beginning was the
[1:31:26] word by the way you're the
[1:31:29] word and the Word was with God which
[1:31:33] means that you were with
[1:31:35] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:31:38] dwelt Among Us and you are now being
[1:31:40] made flesh through the manifested word
[1:31:43] of Jesus Christ operating and moving
[1:31:45] through your
[1:31:47] life and manifesting this messag amen
[1:31:50] that's why this message message will
[1:31:52] stand as the testimony this message and
[1:31:56] those that are in the body of Jesus
[1:31:58] Christ are the ones that are going to be
[1:31:59] translated in the Rapture and the rest
[1:32:02] of the world is going to see that that
[1:32:04] was the the Vindication and the
[1:32:07] identification of what God was talking
[1:32:09] about when he was speaking through you
[1:32:12] to your friends to your family to your
[1:32:14] loved ones because you didn't do
[1:32:16] anything to deserve it but if the spirit
[1:32:18] of God dwells in you it's going to
[1:32:21] Quicken you yes it's going to translate
[1:32:23] you you didn't do something to deserve
[1:32:25] it God came to you listen to this let's
[1:32:28] go here he for he cometh for he he that
[1:32:32] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:32:34] God not some Trinity not some teaching
[1:32:38] of man not the Mighty God the almighty
[1:32:40] God and this teaching and that teaching
[1:32:42] no Buddha and Muhammad and no no you got
[1:32:45] to know that he's God and you got to
[1:32:47] know who God
[1:32:48] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:32:52] that diligently seek him that you you
[1:32:55] when when God Gave You revelation of who
[1:32:57] he was and who you were you couldn't
[1:32:59] wait to feed on the word you can't wait
[1:33:01] to receive more because it's telling you
[1:33:03] who you are where you came from where
[1:33:06] you're going why you were called why
[1:33:08] you're placed here why this is happening
[1:33:10] in your life why this is only a
[1:33:12] circumstance God is going to deliver you
[1:33:14] from that look at the next scripture
[1:33:16] Ephesians chapter 2:8 it says here for
[1:33:19] by grace are you saved through faith and
[1:33:23] that not of yourselves it is
[1:33:26] what what you mean faith is a gift that
[1:33:31] God gives
[1:33:37] you next slide brother brandham speaking
[1:33:40] here proving his word he says you can
[1:33:42] only have faith as God gives you Faith
[1:33:46] amen Oh Glory
[1:33:48] Hallelujah praise God that's why Saints
[1:33:51] you don't have to try and prove anything
[1:33:54] you you don't need to prove what what
[1:33:56] you believe because what you believe was
[1:33:58] given to you to believe amen you didn't
[1:34:01] work it up you didn't oh I attended a
[1:34:03] 100 seminars I went to this church 50
[1:34:05] times that's why I believe it no you've
[1:34:07] been
[1:34:08] brainwashed God gives you Faith it's the
[1:34:11] gift of God God gives you the gift of
[1:34:13] faith he says faith is a gift of God
[1:34:18] even out don't ever how religious you
[1:34:20] may be yet it must take you must have a
[1:34:25] revelation and your Revelation can only
[1:34:28] rest if you're a Christian upon the
[1:34:31] proven word of God in other words prove
[1:34:33] this message prove if God didn't send a
[1:34:36] prophet in this hour you do your own
[1:34:39] research and find out if God didn't send
[1:34:41] us a 20th century Prophet you prove
[1:34:44] yourself you you search the scriptures
[1:34:46] for in them you think you got eternal
[1:34:48] life but you need to check for yourself
[1:34:51] and make make sure that what you believe
[1:34:53] is what's right and what God wants you
[1:34:55] to
[1:34:57] believe listen next he says I'm going to
[1:35:00] say something look faith is unconscious
[1:35:04] I can't tell you what happened to me
[1:35:06] back in 1994 when I went into that
[1:35:09] little white church and I'm sitting
[1:35:11] there next to brother Gabriel and I was
[1:35:14] thinking what in the world am I doing
[1:35:16] here and this man comes out and he's
[1:35:18] preaching on the woman at the well and
[1:35:20] he's talking about her life and her her
[1:35:23] life of adultery and her life of
[1:35:25] prostitution and and I'm sitting there
[1:35:27] and everything just shut out and all of
[1:35:29] a sudden something is speaking to me
[1:35:31] like I've never heard it before and
[1:35:33] something just bang bang banging in my
[1:35:36] heart I couldn't quite figure it out I I
[1:35:38] I was not conscious I did not understand
[1:35:41] you can look back at your own experience
[1:35:43] you know what God revealed to you you
[1:35:45] know if this is a reality or not it's an
[1:35:48] unconscious Faith it's something that
[1:35:50] you got and you don't even God you don't
[1:35:52] even you're not even conscious of it
[1:35:54] sometimes because it just happens in
[1:35:56] your life you know that healing
[1:35:58] sometimes just takes place I've
[1:35:59] experienced it when I came to the Lord
[1:36:01] for for a good 10 years playing that
[1:36:03] bass guitar I had pain in this left hip
[1:36:08] for 10 years straight the pain was so
[1:36:11] bad sometimes but I would just keep
[1:36:13] going and I every time that the pastor
[1:36:15] would speak claim your healing right now
[1:36:18] you can receive it I claimed it I
[1:36:20] believed it I said Lord maybe not this
[1:36:22] week but it's got to come it's got to
[1:36:25] come lord it's got to come it's got to
[1:36:28] come and let me tell you I didn't even
[1:36:30] know when it left it was gone all of a
[1:36:33] sudden I said I said to my wife I said
[1:36:34] my God I don't even remember when it
[1:36:36] left I feel good I got look at me I I'm
[1:36:39] able to walk I'm able to do I went
[1:36:42] listen I went to see a chiropractor and
[1:36:44] he put me into an x-ray and he looked at
