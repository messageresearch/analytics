[11:47] Hallelujah
[11:49] I was reading this Psalm today and
[11:51] there's some commentary about how David
[11:53] had wrote this um they said he
[11:57] he had just been anointed king
[12:01] and uh
[12:02] [Music]
[12:04] it started off by talking about he's
[12:07] looking
[12:09] up to God then he says the heaven
[12:12] declare the glory of God Psalm 1-6
[12:16] and then he taught they talked about how
[12:18] we look at
[12:19] where he was looking putting on the
[12:22] [Music]
[12:24] law of the Lord is perfect convert into
[12:27] Soul this is looking at the law of God
[12:29] but the part I want to concentrate is is
[12:32] where he looked at within himself he
[12:35] said looking up looking at and looking
[12:37] in he says who could understand his
[12:40] errors cleanse me
[12:42] from my secret faults
[12:44] keep back thy servant from presumptuous
[12:47] sins let them not have dominion over me
[12:51] then shall I be upright and shall be
[12:54] innocent from great transgression let
[12:56] the words of my mouth and the meditation
[12:58] of my heart be acceptable unto you oh
[13:01] God we all got all these sins that we
[13:04] don't even know about so we ask God
[13:07] tonight as we sing this song we sing
[13:08] with a different understanding
[13:11] do you have the words of the song

[22:56] Christ
[22:57] though we started back on June the 4th
[23:01] and tonight we're going to just dig a
[23:03] little deeper into it
[23:05] by God's grace
[23:10] so we're going to turn to our first
[23:13] scripture this evening
[23:16] is John Chapter 13 Verse 34 and 35
[23:20] before we do that let's just bow our
[23:23] heads in prayer

[23:27] that
[23:28] every Wednesday night you're here before
[23:31] we even get here

[23:36] your soul just willing to bless and and
[23:41] anoint the atmosphere so that we can
[23:44] enter into Heavenly places with you
[23:46] and receive everything that you would
[23:49] have for us this evening Lord
[23:51] many
[23:53] thoughts are pondering Upon Our Hearts
[23:57] every day we think of
[24:00] the dealings of this life and all that
[24:02] concerns our future
[24:05] and Lord there's this wonderful
[24:08] Revelation that burns within our hearts
[24:11] that says that our future is clear
[24:13] because you have made a way for us
[24:16] and so tonight we ask your anointing to
[24:19] come and just take control and just
[24:21] bless us this evening Lord walk with us
[24:24] tonight speak with us tonight Lord and
[24:26] do something that Lord we can leave just
[24:30] a little better than we came in Lord a
[24:32] little more of you in our lives granted

[24:35] in Jesus name amen praise God
[24:39] John

[24:43] says a new commandment I give unto you
[24:45] that ye love one another
[24:48] as I have loved you
[24:51] and ye also love one another
[24:54] by this shall all men know that ye are
[24:58] my disciples if ye have love one to
[25:03] another
[25:04] God bless you Saints you may be seated
[25:11] brother Branham speaking here in uniting
[25:14] time and sign
[25:17] 1963
[25:19] we read this quote back on June the 4th
[25:22] and I just want to open up with it again
[25:24] here tonight just to kind of bring us
[25:27] back into the thought God is uniting his
[25:31] bride
[25:32] she is coming together from the East and
[25:36] the west and the North and South there
[25:39] is a uniting time and that's on right
[25:43] now
[25:45] what is she uniting for the Rapture amen
[25:50] God getting her ready yes sir uniting
[25:53] what is she uniting with with the word
[25:56] for all heavens and earth will pass away
[25:59] but my words shall never pass away she's
[26:04] uniting herself with thus saith the Lord
[26:08] regardless of what any denomination or
[26:12] anybody else says
[26:16] she's uniting herself
[26:19] she's getting ready why she's the bride
[26:22] that's right and she's uniting herself
[26:25] with her bridegroom see and the
[26:28] bridegroom is the word in the beginning
[26:31] was the word the word was with God and
[26:34] the Word was God and the Word was made
[26:37] flesh and dwelt Among Us and the church
[26:40] and the bride and the word is becoming
[26:43] so one until the very word itself is
[26:48] working out the works of the bridegroom
[26:51] amen you see it are uniting
[26:56] not no more join the church
[27:00] not more of this but flee from
[27:03] everything and tied to Jesus Christ see
[27:06] it's the uniting time God uniting his
[27:10] bride together bringing it back just
[27:13] exactly uniting the words of his promise
[27:17] second Thessalonians
[27:19] second chapter it says rather fifth
[27:22] chapter says the saints that are asleep
[27:25] in the dust of the earth will awaken
[27:29] and then we will Unite with them the
[27:33] living ones with the ones that's being
[27:35] dead
[27:36] will unite before we even get up there
[27:41] because the bride now listen here the
[27:44] bride because the bride will be complete
[27:48] when she gets there
[27:51] the ones that's living that's uniting
[27:54] themselves with the word and those that
[27:57] are gone already did that
[27:59] and it all comes together makes one
[28:03] great Union of the uniting before going
[28:06] up there amen
[28:10] amazing praise God forevermore
[28:13] Hallelujah
[28:14] next slide
[28:16] Matthew chapter 5
[28:18] verses 38 to 45.
[28:22] you know we're talking about this bride
[28:25] coming together brother Branham made it
[28:27] very clear that when he went to the
[28:29] other side and he went beyond the
[28:31] curtain of time he made it very clear
[28:33] that nothing but perfect love could
[28:35] enter into that place
[28:37] he was in the he was in the presence of
[28:39] perfect love
[28:40] and so we look at the
[28:44] um you know at the at the Capstone and
[28:47] the pyramid and we see the ages that
[28:49] we've come through and we know now
[28:51] exactly where we are we know the age
[28:54] that we're living in and we know that
[28:56] we've crossed that Chasm we know that
[28:59] we've gone from church age to Eternal
[29:02] Church age we've gone you know that's
[29:04] why there's that Gap there between the
[29:07] the Capstone and and the actual Church
[29:10] ages themselves it's because the Holy
[29:12] Spirit himself is the only one that can
[29:15] take you into that place into that
[29:17] Capstone into that perfect place where
[29:21] there's a perfect Unity where there is
[29:24] no division there's no separation
[29:27] there's only separation in this flesh
[29:30] the only thing that that causes division
[29:33] amongst us and amongst human beings is
[29:37] because we see things with the flesh we
[29:41] see things with the carnal mind we
[29:44] interpret things with our carnal mind
[29:47] and because we're human we get weak and
[29:50] all of a sudden the enemy knows that
[29:53] we're weak in our conscious carnal State
[29:57] because he can inject negative thoughts
[29:59] into us he can turn us one against the
[30:02] other he turns people against one
[30:05] another and and look at the world and
[30:07] look at the condition of the world it's
[30:10] total chaos there's Division and and
[30:13] every area he's Satan is just trying to
[30:16] divide the people
[30:18] but not this bride
[30:22] she's being united with him
[30:26] our
[30:27] uh if we have anything in common
[30:31] it's the one thing that we have in
[30:33] common is that we are attributes of God
[30:36] other than that you were born in this
[30:39] country born under this nationality born
[30:42] under this uh you know family under this
[30:45] certain environment and you've got all
[30:48] kinds of things that go against you in
[30:50] this Dimension and because of that we
[30:53] carry all these scars and we carry all
[30:55] these weaknesses and and we can't help
[30:57] it we get we we get into these battles
[31:00] most of the time the greatest battles
[31:02] are right here right in our own minds
[31:05] because we believe certain thoughts that
[31:08] the devil will try and and put between
[31:11] us because listen this is the time that
[31:14] we unite there's a perfect Unity that's
[31:18] coming together in the bride this is
[31:20] what we're working towards here right
[31:24] now as the Bride of Jesus Christ so
[31:26] let's let's read here Matthew 5 38-45
[31:29] you've heard that it hath being said and
[31:32] I for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but
[31:35] I say unto you that you resists that
[31:38] that ye resist not evil but whosoever
[31:42] shall smite thee on the right cheek turn
[31:45] to him the other also and if any man
[31:48] will will will sue thee at the law and
[31:51] take away thy coat let him have thy
[31:54] cloak also and whosoever shall compel
[31:58] thee to go a mile go with him two miles
[32:01] next slide
[32:04] uh verse 43 you have heard that it hath
[32:08] been said that ye shall love thy
[32:11] neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say
[32:14] unto you love your enemies bless them
[32:17] that curse you do good to them that hate
[32:19] you and pray for them which despitefully
[32:22] use you and persecute you that ye may be
[32:26] the children of your father which is in
[32:29] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[32:33] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[32:36] forth Reign on the just and on the
[32:39] unjust
[32:41] praise God forevermore aren't you glad
[32:44] to know that God has given you a
[32:46] revelation of of what all this world
[32:51] condition division separation War the
[32:55] the the purpose behind it all the evil
[32:57] that's behind it but yet God is telling
[33:00] you no you're not a part of that
[33:02] you're not to unite with that you're not
[33:05] to to to get you know a lot of people
[33:07] they want to watch the news and they
[33:09] want to feed on the news and they want
[33:10] to feed on all the garbage that's
[33:12] constantly being you know sent over the
[33:15] Airways into the media so that they can
[33:18] get the people talking negative and
[33:21] getting them into the into Satan's
[33:24] program which is a program of division
[33:27] he's come to divide he's come to to
[33:30] separate he's come to destroy that's his
[33:33] that's his whole purpose but Jesus given
[33:36] us a revelation saying no don't allow
[33:38] what he's saying in this scripture is is
[33:40] don't allow that same Spirit to come
[33:43] upon you
[33:45] that's why you know I explained to
[33:47] people sometimes about you know the
[33:49] understanding of turning the other cheek
[33:52] when somebody you know comes in and and
[33:55] says something against you and you turn
[33:57] the other cheek it's he's saying don't
[34:00] allow that same Spirit of Revenge don't
[34:04] allow that same Spirit of of you know
[34:07] spite to come upon you so that you would
[34:10] react in the same way because that
[34:11] spirit's looking for a way to jump on
[34:14] you
[34:15] and to get you into a defeated condition
[34:19] praise God brother Brown speaking he
[34:22] says
[34:23] love one another above everything
[34:27] love one another don't no matter what
[34:30] the devil tries to say now you're all
[34:34] one great big sweet group right now but
[34:37] remember my warning see Satan won't let
[34:40] that stay that way no sir he'll shoot
[34:44] everything he has to bring somebody in
[34:48] to make his Target he'll bring some
[34:51] critic or unbeliever in set him down and
[34:54] cause him to fellowship with you under
[34:55] the quietness and things then he will
[34:58] shoot that guy with some kind of a
[35:00] poison stuff and he'll start through the
[35:03] church with it
[35:05] amen don't you take sides with it
[35:09] you know we're talking about perfect
[35:12] unity in Christ and you know the things
[35:14] we're going to look at this evening it's
[35:16] Bible study right we're going to look at
[35:18] certain things and you know these things
[35:20] are are how the enemy tries to
[35:23] infiltrate the church
[35:25] how the enemy tries to divide the people
[35:28] here we are at a time where God is doing
[35:31] a great work in our midst that we're in
[35:33] a transition time we're we're in a time
[35:35] where we're between uh Earth and Heaven
[35:39] we're being transitioned into Heavenly
[35:42] places we're being transitioned into our
[35:45] Eternal bodies
[35:46] this is the time this is the focus this
[35:48] is what we should be focused on we're
[35:51] we're in the rapture
[35:53] but remember the enemy is going to try
[35:55] and attack in so many ways he'll attack
[35:58] right in your own home you'll attack you
[36:01] at work he'll attack you in so many
[36:04] different ways and so we want to just
[36:06] you know refresh ourselves and fortify
[36:09] ourselves with with the with the word of
[36:11] God that's been given to us

[36:16] don't you have nothing to do with it
[36:17] anything else you stay right loving and
[36:21] sweet and kind to one another

[36:55] way for us amen
[36:56] God has placed Us in this church here
[36:59] under this ministry for protection a lot
[37:03] of people don't understand that
[37:07] people don't realize that when you when
[37:10] you find your your position in the
[37:12] church where God has placed you
[37:14] do you realize that you are placing
[37:17] yourself and your family
[37:19] under the protection of the Lord
[37:22] as a member of that church
[37:26] do you realize the power of God through
[37:29] the authorities that God has placed
[37:32] that's why you know they don't want a
[37:34] lot of people say oh you don't need the
[37:35] five-fold ministry in that five-fold
[37:38] Ministry are pastors
[37:42] and God placed them there for a reason
[37:46] God has anointed them to Shepherd you as
[37:49] his sheep and and for that very purpose
[37:53] God has placed an anointing and a
[37:56] protection around his sheep
[37:59] and people want to rebel against the
[38:02] pastor
[38:03] they want to talk and they want to
[38:04] murmur about the pastor in the
[38:06] background they don't realize what
[38:08] they're doing
[38:09] they don't realize that they're actually
[38:11] breaking down their own protection
[38:15] God has a provided way within the
[38:17] ministry God has Deacons
[38:19] God has placed them there for a purpose

[38:45] reason and a purpose for it it's so that
[38:48] this ministry can prosper and so that
[38:51] you can prosper
[38:53] not talking about financial prosperity
[38:55] here we're talking about uniting the
[38:58] bride for the rapture
[39:00] we're talking about bringing the people
[39:02] together in one Faith one Unity One
[39:06] baptism one God you know having an
[39:10] understanding that we are a part of the
[39:12] mystical body of Jesus Christ and that
[39:15] we nourish and edify one another when we
[39:18] are positionally placed and know our
[39:21] position
[39:22] it gives strength to the whole Ministry
[39:25] this strength this this ministry can can
[39:28] be completely fortified because of you
[39:32] being in your position and everyone
[39:34] recognizing that allows the Holy Spirit
[39:37] to move through every office nourish you
[39:41] edify you correct you when you need it

[39:47] through through your deacons and and
[39:49] through the ministry of the word when
[39:51] you come every Wednesday every Sunday to
[39:54] assemble yourself there's a supernatural
[39:57] protection that comes with being a part
[40:01] of the body of Jesus Christ and not just
[40:05] being apart but being under subjection
[40:07] to it
[40:10] Hallelujah
[40:11] now do you remember now you remember
[40:13] that the enemy will come and when he
[40:16] does just cling that much closer
[40:19] together
[40:19] and the one that the devil is using for
[40:22] an enemy will either get out
[40:25] or come in
[40:27] and be one of you that's all don't never
[40:29] Clan among one another talk make
[40:33] yourself clannish We Are One
[40:36] I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you
[40:39] I'm going to take you away because
[40:41] you're not a right hand he's my left
[40:44] hand I want him to stay there even the
[40:48] little tip of my finger I want it to
[40:50] stay right there every little part of my
[40:53] body stay right there and God wants us
[40:57] as a body of Believers to stay right
[40:59] exactly with one another right
[41:03] it with one another
[41:07] Hallelujah glory to God Amen God wants
[41:11] us to recognize that we need one another
[41:16] I need you
[41:19] and you need me
[41:22] it's as simple as that
[41:24] when we understand
[41:26] how
[41:27] powerful it is to be a part of the body
[41:30] of Jesus Christ and that God is now
[41:33] bringing us together for the Rapture and
[41:36] only perfect love can be in that place
[41:40] we need to understand one another
[41:43] we need to see one another
[41:46] as human and understand that we have
[41:48] weaknesses
[41:50] every one of us
[41:52] there's nobody in this church here
[41:55] tonight or out there that's listening in
[41:57] that's perfect
[41:59] as long as you're in this human flesh
[42:01] you you have weakness in you
[42:05] you're actually in a body that's against
[42:08] God
[42:10] your your mind your carnal mind is that
[42:13] enmity with God
[42:14] that's scriptural
[42:16] the things that you should be doing at
[42:18] times you're not doing it you entertain
[42:21] the thoughts of the enemy
[42:23] but we're not
[42:24] we're
[42:25] we're moving on
[42:27] we're we're moving on brother halleluia
[42:31] sister we're going in the rapture
[42:33] that's why we join this church I
[42:35] remember when I first came into this
[42:37] ministry and I caught a revelation of
[42:39] the Rapture I never knew about any kind
[42:41] of a Rapture I thought I thought what
[42:44] you mean we're going to actually be
[42:46] translated our bodies are going to be
[42:48] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[42:50] an eye we're going to escape all the
[42:52] chaos of this world
[42:54] we're gonna we're gonna be able to leave
[42:56] this place and and and we're going to go
[42:58] for for an absolute reunion that that
[43:02] eyes have not seen years have not heard
[43:04] nor has it even entered into the heart
[43:06] of man what God has in store for are you
[43:09] kidding me
[43:10] I remember when that was breaking on my
[43:12] heart and I thought wow you mean this is
[43:15] this is not everything because at that
[43:19] time I got I had a lot of problems
[43:22] we we all we we all had a lot of pro and
[43:25] some of us even still got problems but
[43:27] I'm telling you something you're gonna
[43:29] be going in a rapture
[43:30] you're going to be translated from this
[43:32] place amen praise God we're not going to
[43:35] be staying here hallelujah glory to God
[43:38] but we need perfect love go to the next
[43:40] slide
[43:42] First Corinthians 13 though I speak with
[43:45] the tongues of men and of angels and
[43:48] have not charity I am become as a
[43:52] sounding brass or a tingling symbol
[43:55] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[43:57] and understand all Mysteries and all
[44:01] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[44:04] that I could remove mountains and have
[44:06] not love charity loved there's a
[44:10] supernatural Revelation behind that word
[44:13] love
[44:14] it's called God's love it's called it's
[44:17] called God's revelation of love God's
[44:20] interpretation of Love towards you it's
[44:23] a love that that supersedes human
[44:26] understanding that's why Gifts of
[44:28] Prophecy Gifts of knowledge knowing the
[44:31] mysteries of the word we could know all
[44:33] the Mysteries you know we could we could
[44:35] preach on every mystery in the opening
[44:37] of the word and the so and the the half
[44:40] hour of silence and everything else and
[44:42] yet we could be as miserable as
[44:44] miserable can be because the enemy is
[44:47] constantly bombarding our minds and
[44:50] trying to divide us and separate us
[44:53] no more
[44:56] no more and though I bestow all my goods
[44:59] to feed the poor and though I give my
[45:01] body to be burned and have not love it
[45:05] prophetth mean nothing
[45:06] and now abideth faith hope charity these
[45:10] three but the greatest of these
[45:13] is love amen next slide
[45:17] and that's why it's so important now to
[45:19] understand the function of the five-fold
[45:22] ministry and why it's so important for
[45:25] us to understand that being a part of
[45:29] the body of Christ supernaturally is one
[45:33] thing
[45:34] and then being a part of a local
[45:36] Ministry is just as important
[45:40] because that's where it all comes
[45:43] together
[45:44] that's where we all unite that's where
[45:47] we get corrected that's where we get
[45:49] delivered we come into the house of the
[45:52] Lord so that because judgment starts in
[45:54] the house of the Lord
[45:56] fail not to assemble yourselves even
[46:00] more so as that day which day
[46:03] the Rapture Day
[46:05] the day that we depart from here
[46:08] Hallelujah we need to assemble ourselves
[46:11] and we need to understand that Ephesians
[46:14] 4 verses 11 to 13.
[46:17] is is a very vital aspect of this body
[46:21] of Christ coming together uniting
[46:24] together
[46:25] edifying one another and building up for
[46:29] the perfection
[46:30] of the church
[46:32] and he gave some Apostles and some
[46:34] prophets and some evangelists and some
[46:37] pastors and teachers what for for the
[46:40] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[46:44] the ministry
[46:45] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[46:48] we are a part of the body of Christ we
[46:51] are being united for the rapture
[46:55] perfect Unity is is something that we
[46:58] will achieve as the members of the body
[47:02] of Jesus Christ we need to enter into
[47:05] that by revelation God is going to give
[47:07] us this revelation of perfect Unity as
[47:11] we feed on the word of God because it's
[47:14] required for us to be changed
[47:17] amen praise God till we all what come
[47:20] together until we all come in the unity
[47:24] of the revelation
[47:26] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[47:29] unto a perfect man
[47:32] a perfect revelation of who God is unto
[47:36] the measure of the stature of the
[47:39] fullness of Jesus Christ
[47:41] this word just you know it just never
[47:43] stops unveiling itself
[47:46] I mean you've probably read this a
[47:48] hundred times well I just got I just got
[47:50] more faith out of reading that last
[47:53] little line there that says unto the
[47:56] measure of the stature of the fullness
[47:58] of Christ
[48:00] we need the fullness of his love
[48:03] we need the fullness of his of his uh
[48:06] understanding of who we are in the body
[48:09] of Christ his understanding of who we
[48:12] are our understanding of who we are we
[48:15] get confused because we listen to the
[48:17] carnal mind too much we listen to the
[48:20] lies of the enemy that tells oh but
[48:22] you're you're such a weak Christian
[48:24] no no let me tell you something when
[48:26] you're at your weakest Point that's when
[48:27] you're the strongest
[48:29] because you allow the fullness of God to
[48:32] take control over your life over the
[48:35] circumstances over the situations you
[48:37] see you can turn it around and send it
[48:39] right back to the enemy when he tells
[48:41] you you're weak you tell them good when
[48:44] I'm weak you're defeated because now you
[48:47] can't you you can fight me and you can
[48:49] try and defeat me but you can't defeat
[48:51] the one that's in me that's greater
[48:54] than me and greater than you
[48:57] because there's a fullness of Jesus
[49:00] Christ that we are entering into praise
[49:03] God forevermore go to the next slide
[49:05] we've read we've seen this we've we've
[49:07] we've we look at it but you know what
[49:11] there's all these aspects that are in
[49:13] there they're all aspects of Christ
[49:18] it's not you trying to put on perfect
[49:21] faith not you trying to put on virtue oh
[49:24] I got virtue
[49:26] oh brother when I you know when I when I
[49:29] go into a room you know the people they
[49:32] they get blessed because I'm in the room
[49:34] and they feed off of me because I'm full
[49:37] of God I've got so much Revelation and
[49:41] are you kidding
[49:44] it's Christ in you your hope of glory
[49:47] it's not oh I've studied so much that I
[49:51] can I can quote every quote and I know
[49:53] the Bible from from Genesis to
[49:55] Revelation good for you
[49:57] the letter killeth
[50:00] you need the spirit of God to give you a
[50:03] revelation of who you are and your part
[50:06] in the word of God Amen you need the
[50:08] knowledge of who you are not the
[50:10] knowledge of God the knowledge of who
[50:12] you are because once you come to realize
[50:14] that you'll realize that you're a part
[50:16] of God
[50:17] Hallelujah Temperance patience oh I got
[50:20] to be patient I got to be more patient
[50:23] yeah these are things that that that
[50:25] that take place and when you know when
[50:29] you get tested and the enemy comes in
[50:31] and tests you and he's pushing you and
[50:35] he's getting you to try and blow your
[50:37] fuse
[50:38] it's at those times that you that you
[50:41] dig deeper into Christ
[50:44] that's where the scripture says be still
[50:47] and know that I am God
[50:49] be still and know that I am still your
[50:52] Defender I'm your keeper I'm the one
[50:55] that's going to stand there and deal
[50:56] with this situation that you're that you
[50:59] that you think it's going to take you
[51:00] you think you're done you think you're
[51:02] finished you're not finished
[51:04] you're not you've only just begun
[51:07] I'm doing this work I have spoken it I
[51:10] will perform it it's godliness is not
[51:13] something that we put on oh I'm going to
[51:16] be Godly I'm going to be holy you you
[51:18] you you want to please the Lord by your
[51:23] attitude
[51:24] your attitude should be to please the
[51:27] Lord not to please others
[51:30] when you please the Lord
[51:32] and your uh your attitude towards one
[51:36] another
[51:37] is is with the right motive and and you
[51:40] you you're looking at him and you're
[51:43] saying Lord help me to be more
[51:46] compassionate towards this situation
[51:48] more sincere towards these situations
[51:51] you're seeking the inner aspect and the
[51:55] depths of God that's that that that
[51:57] that's what's perfect Hallelujah glory
[52:01] to God for if these things be in you and
[52:04] abound they make you that ye shall
[52:07] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[52:10] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[52:12] really it's if you got the Holy Ghost
[52:16] if you've got the spirit of God in you
[52:18] then you've got a chance
[52:21] I want to um just bring out uh
[52:24] seven effective ways
[52:27] on how to preserve unity in the church
[52:31] these are practical things but these are
[52:33] things that we need to be reminded of
[52:36] and there's there's ways that we can you
[52:39] know
[52:40] um preserve the unity Focus number one
[52:43] focus on what we have in common
[52:46] not on our differences
[52:50] that's the thing that's why I said at
[52:53] the beginning
[52:54] the thing that we have most in common is
[52:56] the attribute of God
[52:58] is the fact that Jesus Christ lives in
[53:00] us that's that's what gives us
[53:02] Fellowship
[53:04] I wouldn't have never known you brother
[53:06] Philip I would have never known any of
[53:08] any of you
[53:10] and probably would not be you know
[53:13] um I'd probably be you know like living
[53:15] in the world like most of us with our
[53:18] own people nationalities you know birds
[53:22] of a feather they usually flock together
[53:23] right but here we are and what you just
[53:27] look around you and you see a
[53:29] multi-colored uh
[53:31] bouquet of God
[53:34] you know faith in different aspects
[53:37] being reflected in different ways
[53:39] different gifts being reflected for the
[53:42] body of Jesus Christ gifts being offered
[53:45] for the purpose of of edifying and
[53:48] building the purpose and the plan of God
[53:51] of Jesus Christ so that we can bring the
[53:54] rapture
[53:55] bring bring the faith of the Rapture
[53:58] into the hearts of the people amen no
[54:01] two heads are the same no two thumb
[54:04] marks are the same understand and accept
[54:07] that we all have different personalities
[54:13] but we have the mind of Christ
[54:16] isn't that amazing
[54:18] that you know that that there's one
[54:20] thing that you'll never argue
[54:25] when it comes to the revelation of God's
[54:27] word when you've got the mind of Christ
[54:32] you may have your own opinion
[54:34] and some people like to really Express
[54:38] their opinion
[54:39] and they want their opinion to be heard
[54:42] and their opinion if you don't if you
[54:45] don't accept their opinion then they
[54:48] don't accept you
[54:49] that's a spirit
[54:51] that's a spirit of pride
[54:53] that's what that is
[54:55] but not in the body of Christ
[54:57] we need to understand that there are
[54:59] different personalities different
[55:01] aspects and we need to see the good
[55:05] in one another
[55:07] God has a way of correcting the bad
[55:11] God has a way of dealing with the
[55:14] situations that need to be dealt with
[55:15] within the body of Christ he's made a
[55:18] way amen but there's different
[55:20] personalities different backgrounds
[55:22] different races nationalities tastes and
[55:25] preferences God is a god of variety
[55:30] we have one Lord
[55:32] One Faith one baptism working for the
[55:37] same goal or purpose
[55:41] amen
[55:43] focus on what we have in common not on
[55:47] our differences conflict is the
[55:51] destroyer of unity
[55:54] we need to be conscious we need to be
[55:58] aware you know sometimes our attitude
[56:01] and our opinion because we want to
[56:05] express it and we want to be heard
[56:08] when we come together whether it's in a
[56:11] meeting or whether it's in fellowship or
[56:13] whatever it is
[56:16] our attitude
[56:18] and our
[56:20] approach to situations will bring
[56:23] conflict
[56:24] in the way that we communicate things
[56:28] I mean I'm learning that more than ever
[56:30] with my kids
[56:33] and
[56:35] the people of this I you know I have a
[56:37] lot of employees that I that I deal with
[56:39] and nowadays you've got to be careful
[56:41] how you talk to people because you know
[56:44] you you ask them to do something you're
[56:47] expecting them to do something and if
[56:49] you tell them in a way that it's a
[56:50] little bit too sharp right away it's
[56:53] like
[56:54] you get the attitude are you verbally
[56:57] abusing me
[57:00] I mean everybody's looking for a way to
[57:02] sue somebody somehow some way
[57:05] you know but this is the situation that
[57:08] this is the kind of atmospheres that
[57:11] we're living in now
[57:13] and if we're not careful and if we're
[57:15] not sensitive to it we can get caught up
[57:18] into it ourselves
[57:20] and all of a sudden our attitudes and
[57:22] our ways of communicating start to bring
[57:25] uh conflict which destroys Unity
[57:28] conflict is a sign that your focus has
[57:31] shifted from Christ to other carnal
[57:34] issues
[57:35] we need to keep the focus
[57:37] what is the reason the purpose of the
[57:40] discussion or the situation or the
[57:43] circumstance
[57:44] the Bible admonishes us to look unto
[57:47] Jesus the author and the finisher of our
[57:50] faith
[57:52] number two personal criticism must be
[57:56] avoided
[57:59] there's a way to to uh Nobody's Perfect
[58:04] and so we don't need to look you know
[58:07] because we're all Sinners and we're all
[58:09] saved by the grace of God
[58:13] it's kind of preaching's a little
[58:14] different right
[58:15] but it's down to earth it's down it's
[58:17] you know it's where the metal hits the
[58:19] the roads where the rubber hits the road
[58:21] kind of situations right because you're
[58:24] out there working every day I'm out
[58:25] there working every day we're rubbing
[58:27] shoulders with the world and the
[58:29] situations that we deal with every
[58:30] single day
[58:31] you know I had somebody just the other
[58:34] day had full-blown road rage on me
[58:38] completely lost it and it was absolutely
[58:43] totally unnecessary there was so much
[58:46] you know I just came in got into the
[58:48] lane and the person was behind me and
[58:51] you know because I came into the lane
[58:53] that person just
[58:55] didn't like it that I that I pulled out
[58:57] in front of him you know tons of room no
[59:01] potential for an accident no nothing he
[59:03] completely lost it followed me all the
[59:06] way home
[59:08] all the way home
[59:09] and I thought hmm because I pulled in
[59:12] and I purposely didn't go in where I
[59:14] normally go in I said this guy has lost
[59:17] his mind
[59:19] because people they they they they they
[59:21] they just they lose it out there because
[59:23] they're under a lot of pressure
[59:25] and he was there with his wife too
[59:28] and you know you just and you know so I
[59:30] thought oh man
[59:31] you know so I just went in and I parked
[59:33] my truck and I got out of my truck and I
[59:37] just stood there and I knew he was
[59:38] coming
[59:39] I said he's come
[59:41] yeah so I just stood there and I waited
[59:43] and I and and he came around the corner
[59:46] and he looked at me and I guess maybe he
[59:47] saw something that he didn't like
[59:49] you know six foot and I can give a look
[59:54] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna just let
[59:56] somebody just you know come in and just
[59:58] you know come in and take a shot or
[1:00:00] whatever
[1:00:01] I would do what I have to do you should
[1:00:03] do whatever you have to do you know what
[1:00:05] I'm saying
[1:00:07] to protect yourself we turn the cheek
[1:00:11] that's that's that's something that that
[1:00:13] we that we apply but if somebody's gonna
[1:00:15] come up and take a shot
[1:00:18] and try to take a swing at you you need
[1:00:20] to duck
[1:00:24] anyway he pulled up and he
[1:00:27] put down his window and he just unloaded
[1:00:30] himself on me and I just stood there and
[1:00:32] I watched him
[1:00:33] and he completely
[1:00:35] carried on and left
[1:00:37] the parking lot
[1:00:38] okay now
[1:00:41] you know
[1:00:43] I could have gotten just as Road rages
[1:00:45] but I had a smile I had because I'm not
[1:00:49] going to buy into that I'm not going to
[1:00:51] allow that Spirit to take control
[1:00:56] when you
[1:00:58] allow the spirit of God to take control
[1:01:02] in your heart in your mind that you know
[1:01:05] that you're you're a Son of God you're a
[1:01:07] daughter of God if you know where you
[1:01:09] stand you have nothing to fear
[1:01:12] you have nothing to fear
[1:01:14] you don't have to uh
[1:01:17] step out and and be the aggressor or or
[1:01:20] or you know give your opinion on the
[1:01:23] whole situation avoid so nobody is
[1:01:27] perfect we're all Sinners God came to
[1:01:29] save us all other believers might
[1:01:31] disappoint you but they are still your
[1:01:34] brothers and sisters never be an
[1:01:36] idealist avoid too high expectation for
[1:01:40] others
[1:01:41] understand that everybody has weaknesses
[1:01:44] and strengths
[1:01:45] amen praise God
[1:01:49] number three choose to encourage rather
[1:01:52] than to criticize
[1:01:54] in other words you know like and so like
[1:01:57] you know I'm learning those things you
[1:02:00] know you you read these things and you
[1:02:02] you start to apply them in in your life
[1:02:04] right you know so when you see you know
[1:02:06] something like if for example if I see
[1:02:09] an employee and he's doing five things
[1:02:11] right and he's doing 13 things wrong I'm
[1:02:15] gonna first emphasize on the five things
[1:02:17] that he's doing right
[1:02:19] so that I can encourage him and then
[1:02:22] show him how he can improve and this is
[1:02:25] how you can improve this
[1:02:28] instead of doing it like instead of
[1:02:29] telling them you're doing this all wrong
[1:02:32] you did this wrong that wrong dot wrong
[1:02:34] well this here okay you did okay
[1:02:37] now how is that going to encourage that
[1:02:39] person
[1:02:40] you've started right away with a
[1:02:43] discouraging thought and you've you've
[1:02:46] you've criticized them right off the bat
[1:02:48] and they're not going to feel encouraged
[1:02:49] and they're not going to be motivated to
[1:02:50] work for me anymore or to work for you
[1:02:52] or to work together with you
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:57] let us not compare with nor judge others
[1:03:00] Romans 14 4 who art thou that just
[1:03:04] judges another man's servant to his own
[1:03:07] Master he standeth or falleth yea he
[1:03:11] shall be holding up for God is able to
[1:03:13] make him stand
[1:03:15] Romans 14 13 let us not therefore judge
[1:03:19] one another anymore but judge this
[1:03:21] rather that no man put a stumbling block
[1:03:25] or an occasion to fall in his brother's
[1:03:29] way in other words don't criticize him
[1:03:32] don't give him something that he's going
[1:03:34] to stumble over
[1:03:36] give him something that
[1:03:38] he can step up
[1:03:41] and over
[1:03:43] and say you can you can leave that
[1:03:45] behind you can that that thing that was
[1:03:48] that was tormenting you in the past and
[1:03:50] had control over you and your life in
[1:03:53] the past God has given you faith that
[1:03:55] you can overcome this thing
[1:03:57] you don't have to stay that way you
[1:04:00] don't have to continue that way that's
[1:04:02] not who you are
[1:04:03] encourage
[1:04:05] and do not criticize number four refuse
[1:04:09] to listen to gossip
[1:04:14] oh yeah
[1:04:16] it starts out as oh brother sister you
[1:04:19] know did you hear this did you hear that
[1:04:20] did you see this did you see that it's
[1:04:23] gossip gossip is the passing of
[1:04:25] information when you are neither part of
[1:04:29] it
[1:04:30] you're neither part of the problem nor
[1:04:32] the solution so why should you know
[1:04:34] about it
[1:04:35] God has his provided ways of dealing
[1:04:38] with those things that's why you have an
[1:04:39] issue go to your deacon now you're going
[1:04:42] to somebody that holds the solution
[1:04:46] amen or if you're you're strong enough
[1:04:49] you can go directly to the brother and
[1:04:52] say or the sister and say hey let's sit
[1:04:54] and reason let's talk about this
[1:04:57] let's communicate and let's let's let's
[1:04:59] get this devil that's trying to separate
[1:05:02] us
[1:05:03] amen
[1:05:04] and put in put him where he belongs and
[1:05:07] let's get to where we belong which is in
[1:05:09] the body of Christ United together for
[1:05:12] the Rapture of the church
[1:05:14] Hallelujah
[1:05:16] that's what we're called to do that's
[1:05:18] what that's why God called us you've
[1:05:21] been called to this ministry because
[1:05:22] you've been called to the Rapture of the
[1:05:25] church
[1:05:27] that's why you've been called
[1:05:29] into the body of Jesus Christ of course
[1:05:32] you have a position the Bible says Thou
[1:05:35] shalt not bear false witness against thy
[1:05:38] neighbor
[1:05:39] people who gossip to you will also
[1:05:41] gossip about you
[1:05:46] they can't be trusted
[1:05:49] all of a sudden you know if you listen
[1:05:51] you know if they're saying that about
[1:05:53] them and I see them the way they oh hi
[1:05:56] God bless you this and that and then the
[1:05:58] next minute they're talking how can you
[1:06:00] trust that
[1:06:02] it doesn't work that way that's not
[1:06:05] Christ that's not perfect Unity
[1:06:08] that's not the way to refuse to listen
[1:06:10] to gossip James 3 5-6 says even so the
[1:06:15] tongue is a little member and boasteth
[1:06:18] great things behold how great a matter a
[1:06:22] little fire kindleth
[1:06:25] and the tongue is a fire
[1:06:28] that it defileth the whole body and is
[1:06:31] setteth on fire the course of Nature and
[1:06:34] it is set on fire of hell
[1:06:38] First John 3 15 whosoever hateth his
[1:06:42] brother is a murderer and ye know that
[1:06:46] no murderer hath eternal life abiding in
[1:06:48] him the prophet said if you can't say
[1:06:51] anything good about a brother or a
[1:06:53] sister don't speak at all
[1:06:57] hallelujah praise God number five
[1:07:00] resolve conflict according to the Bible
[1:07:02] Way
[1:07:04] let the word of God if you place the
[1:07:06] word of God into your conflict and you
[1:07:08] allow the word to be the the the the the
[1:07:10] the the
[1:07:11] mender and you know Matthew 18 15 to 18
[1:07:15] says moreover If thy brother shall
[1:07:17] trespass against thee go and tell him
[1:07:20] his fault between thee and him
[1:07:24] privately
[1:07:26] in the love of God
[1:07:28] with a desire and a revelation to
[1:07:31] deliver him and you
[1:07:35] because the enemy is is against him and
[1:07:38] you
[1:07:39] and he's going to try and put you
[1:07:41] against him him against you
[1:07:44] and so when you do it if if ye shall he
[1:07:47] if he shall hear thee thou has gained
[1:07:50] thy brother
[1:07:51] Hallelujah
[1:07:53] but if he will not hear thee then take
[1:07:56] with thee one or two more that in the
[1:07:59] mouth of two or three Witnesses every
[1:08:01] word may be established and you would do
[1:08:03] that through the Avenue of the deacons
[1:08:06] of the church
[1:08:08] that's where you would rely on the
[1:08:11] spirit of God and when you have this
[1:08:14] kind of desire and understanding to
[1:08:17] submit yourself to the word of God
[1:08:20] all things are possible
[1:08:22] I don't care how difficult it might look
[1:08:25] or how it might feel God can take those
[1:08:29] feelings out
[1:08:31] God can supernaturally remove those
[1:08:34] things once your heart has become pure
[1:08:37] towards the whole situation God will
[1:08:39] completely deliver you you'll be set
[1:08:42] free and it'll never torment you no more
[1:08:46] Hallelujah
[1:08:48] glory to God if he shall neglect to hear
[1:08:51] them tell it unto the church but if he
[1:08:54] neglect to hear the church let him be
[1:08:56] unto thee as a heathen man and a
[1:08:58] publican
[1:09:00] these are things of the word
[1:09:03] number six support your leaders
[1:09:07] first Thessalonians 5 12 and 13 and we
[1:09:11] beseech you Brethren to know them which
[1:09:14] labor among you and are over you in the
[1:09:17] Lord and admonish you
[1:09:20] and to esteem them very highly in love
[1:09:24] for their Works sake
[1:09:27] amen praise God
[1:09:30] everybody that labors in the house of
[1:09:33] the Lord needs to be respected
[1:09:35] those that are the leaders that direct
[1:09:38] and guide and God has given to anoint
[1:09:40] them to to protect and and watch over
[1:09:43] you they need to be recognized and
[1:09:46] highly respected and loved
[1:09:49] amen praise God Hebrews 13 17 obey them
[1:09:53] that have the rule over you and submit
[1:09:56] yourselves for they watch for your souls
[1:10:00] as they that must give account to they
[1:10:04] that they may do it with joy and not
[1:10:07] with grief for that is unprofitable
[1:10:11] for you
[1:10:12] the Bible says it's unprofitable for you
[1:10:15] that if you are not supporting your
[1:10:18] leadership you're not getting behind
[1:10:21] that position fully supporting it
[1:10:24] whether it be through your tithes
[1:10:26] through your offerings and through your
[1:10:28] cooperation
[1:10:30] making yourself available
[1:10:32] giving yourself of time
[1:10:34] if the pastor or you know the the
[1:10:37] cleaning committee or the the women's
[1:10:40] fellowship or the men's fellowship every
[1:10:43] time they have an event nobody shows up
[1:10:45] how does that encourage the leaders
[1:10:49] it discourages them
[1:10:52] we should be doing all that we can to
[1:10:55] admonish and encourage one another amen
[1:10:58] support our leaders
[1:11:00] and finally number seven
[1:11:03] seek the good of others not merely your
[1:11:06] own good
[1:11:08] look to see
[1:11:10] how this is going to work for good
[1:11:14] to the whole body of Christ for the
[1:11:16] whole in the First Corinthians 10 24 let
[1:11:19] no man seek his own but every man
[1:11:23] another's wealth
[1:11:25] look for ways to bless and to prosper
[1:11:29] amen glory to God now here's five major
[1:11:33] hindrances to Unity
[1:11:36] hypocrisy
[1:11:38] legalism
[1:11:41] bitterness
[1:11:43] taking advantage of others
[1:11:47] and false
[1:11:49] Doctrine
[1:11:52] there's a lot of things that are that
[1:11:54] are that are moving right now in the
[1:11:56] Realms and the ranks of the message that
[1:11:59] I can say is false Doctrine
[1:12:02] man's own interpretations man's uh you
[1:12:06] know absolutely trying to make it you
[1:12:09] know that that's the word of God no God
[1:12:12] is his own interpreter
[1:12:14] amen praise God legalism people say no
[1:12:18] this is how it has to be this is the
[1:12:20] only way that it has to be Jesus Christ
[1:12:22] is his own interpreter he is the one
[1:12:25] that's making it plain in this day and
[1:12:27] in this hour we must allow the Holy
[1:12:29] Spirit to have his way amen praise God
[1:12:34] glory to God Amen we're going to wind
[1:12:36] this down here
[1:12:38] let's go to the next slide 2nd
[1:12:41] Thessalonians 3 10.
[1:12:49] keep going
[1:12:56] there we go
[1:12:59] on work and responsibility
[1:13:02] being responsible second Thessalonians
[1:13:04] for even when we were with you this we
[1:13:07] commanded you that if any work not would
[1:13:12] not work neither should he eat
[1:13:15] for we hear that there are some which
[1:13:17] walk among you disorderly working not at
[1:13:21] all but our busy bodies
[1:13:25] First Timothy 5 8 but if any provide not
[1:13:29] for his own and especially for those of
[1:13:32] his own house he hath denied the faith
[1:13:35] and is worse than an infidel
[1:13:38] you know sometimes we got to be careful
[1:13:40] that that we take full responsibility on
[1:13:44] ourselves
[1:13:46] to work and to do whatever it is
[1:13:49] whatever position we have in the body of
[1:13:52] Christ
[1:13:53] this is what we're talking about here
[1:13:55] but it but it but it but it starts you
[1:13:58] know in our own personal lives that we
[1:14:00] we must have a desire
[1:14:03] to do what we must do as individuals to
[1:14:06] work and to and to uh provide for our
[1:14:09] homes and our families and not be
[1:14:12] relying upon you know relying on the
[1:14:14] ministry relying that you know oh well
[1:14:16] you know I can go and ask for you know
[1:14:19] no that doesn't strengthen the church
[1:14:22] it's important for us to understand that
[1:14:26] we all have a part and that we all must
[1:14:28] take responsibility for the work that
[1:14:31] God has given us whether it is you know
[1:14:34] being you know a secretary in a
[1:14:37] committee or being part of the youth
[1:14:39] ministry the position that you know that
[1:14:42] God has placed on your heart you know
[1:14:45] the things that God has given you do it
[1:14:47] work take responsibility don't don't
[1:14:52] shun it don't look for the easy way out
[1:14:54] amen praise God hallelujah
[1:14:59] next slide
[1:15:01] debt
[1:15:03] oh no man anything you're thinking like
[1:15:05] what are we talking about these things
[1:15:07] for uh you know like these things are
[1:15:10] practical things in our lives I'm not
[1:15:13] talking about where it's wrong to have a
[1:15:15] mortgage or where it's wrong to you know
[1:15:17] to to have a loan for a vehicle or or or
[1:15:20] whatever
[1:15:22] because you're working and you're
[1:15:24] responsibly paying for those things I'm
[1:15:27] talking about where we we allow certain
[1:15:30] though you go borrow money from a
[1:15:32] brother or a sister and you just
[1:15:34] nonchalantly you don't think you you
[1:15:35] that you that you need to they may not
[1:15:37] say anything
[1:15:38] they may not come to you and ask you for
[1:15:41] it but if they gave it to you in the way
[1:15:44] that when you came to them and they
[1:15:46] asked for it and you did it to assist
[1:15:47] them then you borrowed that money
[1:15:52] and you should be responsible enough to
[1:15:55] think that at some point in time it
[1:15:57] should be paid or somebody comes and
[1:15:59] does work for you and they do a certain
[1:16:02] work for you and they're supposed to get
[1:16:04] paid for that work and you allow that
[1:16:06] debt to linger
[1:16:08] no sir those things are gonna still hang
[1:16:11] around your life and you're going to
[1:16:13] wonder why certain aspects and certain
[1:16:15] things you can't move forward in certain
[1:16:17] areas in your life you just find
[1:16:19] yourself stumbling when it comes to you
[1:16:22] know getting ahead in certain ways is
[1:16:24] because you're allowing certain things
[1:16:26] to linger and to hang on you oh no man
[1:16:30] nothing
[1:16:31] that's the lingering debts that you
[1:16:34] could pay pay them you don't that's
[1:16:36] owing no man nothing it doesn't mean my
[1:16:39] we owe our rent our telephone bill we
[1:16:43] and what more we we owe those things and
[1:16:45] we pay them but an old lingering debt
[1:16:48] that you could be paying on pay it
[1:16:51] pay on it if you can't pay it all pay on
[1:16:54] it continue to work on it so that
[1:16:57] eventually it's out of the way and you
[1:16:59] and you will see that you'll actually be
[1:17:01] set free
[1:17:03] to be who you are supposed to be in the
[1:17:06] body of Jesus Christ
[1:17:08] pay it off see now don't go with
[1:17:11] anything hanging on you like that
[1:17:15] glory to God
[1:17:17] and so let's just go to the final slide
[1:17:20] here and we're going to end it right
[1:17:21] here Romans 12
[1:17:25] be kindly affectionate one to another
[1:17:28] with Brotherly Love in honor preferring
[1:17:32] one another
[1:17:34] not slothful in business

[1:17:44] continuing instant in prayer
[1:17:48] Distributing to the necessity of saints
[1:17:50] given to hospitality
[1:17:54] don't be afraid to bless the body of
[1:17:56] Christ
[1:17:58] do it in the right spirit
[1:18:00] do it unto the Lord
[1:18:03] and let the Holy Spirit bless and
[1:18:05] prosper

[1:18:20] towards another
[1:18:22] my not the high things but condescend to
[1:18:26] Men of law estate be not wise in your
[1:18:30] own
[1:18:31] conceits
[1:18:35] Jesus never lived for himself
[1:18:38] his life was spent for others
[1:18:41] that's perfectly eternal life
[1:18:43] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:18:47] good things that's fine but when you
[1:18:50] live your life to yourself you haven't
[1:18:53] eternal life
[1:18:55] eternal life is living for others
[1:18:59] it proved that when he came in the Lamb
[1:19:02] of God he lived and had eternal life
[1:19:05] because he did not live for himself he
[1:19:08] lived for others and you receive eternal
[1:19:11] life by receiving that day and you don't
[1:19:15] live for yourself no more you live for
[1:19:20] of others brother Branham that day on
[1:19:23] Calvary let the musicians come

[1:20:01] organized Luther they've organized
[1:20:03] Wesley they've organized all the rest of
[1:20:05] the churches and doing that they had to
[1:20:07] adopt a Creed and then when God sent
[1:20:10] something else they could not receive it
[1:20:13] therefore it was not possible until now
[1:20:17] aren't you glad God sent us a prophet to
[1:20:20] restore and God promised in the last
[1:20:22] days that the faith of the fathers would
[1:20:24] be restored back to the bride again
[1:20:27] that it would be this way and it
[1:20:29] couldn't be no other time but this time

[1:21:23] did they ever see the things that we are
[1:21:26] seeing today and this was only made
[1:21:28] possible when God sent the Seven Seals
[1:21:32] and give us a Sign by it
[1:21:36] and sent seven angels down out of heaven
[1:21:39] and come to bring back that scattered
[1:21:41] word in them denominations you know that
