[0:14] praise be to god
[0:16] good evening friends it's good to be in
[0:19] god's house
[0:21] praise his marvelous and wonderful name
[0:25] we're indeed delighted and
[0:28] happy to be here to
[0:31] teach the word of god
[0:34] on the seven church ages
[0:38] now our topic for tonight will be
[0:42] the victorious christ thanks be to
[0:46] god that when they placed him
[0:49] in the tomb thinking that he
[0:52] was defeated and conquered
[0:56] he was unconquerable
[0:59] amen he rose up i
[1:03] am the resurrection and the life
[1:06] amen thanks be to god hallelujah
[1:10] that we serve the mighty conqueror
[1:13] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:17] and forever
[1:19] the ever-living one hallelujah
[1:22] the victorious one amen let us pray
[1:27] our gracious heavenly father we
[1:30] thank you for this marvelous and
[1:32] glorious
[1:33] opportunity of being in your house
[1:38] around your word united with your
[1:42] people may the great holy spirit father
[1:47] take glory and honor in everything we do
[1:50] and say
[1:52] and may you my father in heaven may you
[1:56] delight and joy in the going forth of
[2:00] thy truth
[2:01] we ask it in jesus name amen
[2:05] and amen out of the scriptures
[2:08] revelation chapter 1
[2:12] verses 17
[2:15] and 18 and
[2:18] when i saw him i
[2:22] fell at his feet
[2:25] as dead and he laid his
[2:29] right hand upon me saying unto me
[2:33] fear not i am the first
[2:36] and the last i am he
[2:39] that liveth and was dead
[2:43] and behold i am a life
[2:47] forevermore amen
[2:50] and have the keys of death
[2:54] of hell and of death
[2:58] amen glory to god hallelujah
[3:02] think of it john caught up
[3:06] into this vision of the victorious
[3:10] christ my friends if you have really
[3:14] had a genuine god set
[3:18] holy ghost vision especially a vision
[3:22] of jesus christ then you will
[3:26] understand this supernatural
[3:29] effects of a great
[3:32] anointed holy spirit vision
[3:35] upon an individual's body
[3:39] the natural coming in contact
[3:42] with this supernatural so john
[3:46] is speaking here in the word or
[3:49] recording in the word the effects
[3:53] of this vision of the
[3:57] resurrected and victorious christ
[4:00] that he beheld that he was blessed
[4:04] to see this risen one
[4:08] hallelujah amen so he said
[4:11] and i fell at his
[4:14] feet as dead or
[4:17] as one that is dead
[4:21] or one that appears dead
[4:24] oh so the first effect of the vision
[4:28] was that he fell at the feet of jesus
[4:33] as one dead spiritually speaking
[4:36] it's speaking to us
[4:40] how the john a type of the bride of
[4:43] christ
[4:44] a type of the church falls at the
[4:48] feet of the revealed word
[4:52] as one that has died out to himself
[4:57] and every one of us when we
[5:00] come to a place of a revelation
[5:03] or behold the transfigured word of
[5:07] god before us in sight
[5:10] our inside sight our spiritual
[5:14] sight the eyes of the heart it
[5:17] creates the atmosphere where you
[5:20] desire and surrender yourself
[5:24] to die out to yourself and the
[5:27] works of the flesh and the sincerity and
[5:30] the sobriety
[5:32] of the holy spirit takes a hold
[5:36] of the individual that this is not a
[5:39] fiction fantasy or something
[5:42] made up by man but it is a
[5:46] work of god god working
[5:49] on the human heart and through the human
[5:52] being and making himself known so
[5:55] the vision took away john's
[5:59] natural strength real prophet of god
[6:02] making the word of god manifest and
[6:05] after
[6:06] finishing his physical body would be
[6:09] weak
[6:10] we can go through the bible and see
[6:13] danielle and others after they've had
[6:17] a vision of of the almighty a vision of
[6:20] the lord
[6:21] that they are weak they are as one
[6:25] that uh is dead a tight
[6:28] hair we can see it that we need to
[6:31] die out to ourselves and become weak
[6:35] with our flesh in other words perfect
[6:38] strength
[6:38] god's perfect strength is made
[6:41] manifest in our human weakness
[6:45] as paul the apostle said so
[6:48] he gave away or surrendered
[6:52] his natural strength a man
[6:56] of the flesh that he might gain the
[6:59] strength of god
[7:01] he may gain the anointing of the holy
[7:04] spirit upon his life that he might be
[7:08] a fully sacrificial and
[7:11] dedicated servant of the lord
[7:14] that's what we need in our day that we
[7:17] might
[7:18] come to him surrendering our lives
[7:21] uh that he might flow through us and
[7:24] himself to the world amen
[7:28] hallelujah so john died out
[7:31] to himself he died to himself
[7:34] and there it is that the bible tells us
[7:38] and our right hand is the right hand
[7:42] touched him glory to god the right hand
[7:46] the hand of the lord jesus touched him
[7:49] and here he was brother sister that he
[7:53] could be
[7:53] raised up and stand upon his feet
[7:57] because he had fallen at the feet of the
[8:01] of the word in worship in wonder
[8:04] oh and ready to do the work of god
[8:08] and to give god all the glory and all
[8:11] the praise glory to god so the right
[8:14] hand
[8:15] touched them tenderly with love and as
[8:18] the hand that
[8:19] raised thee lame man and says stand
[8:23] take up your bed and walk that same
[8:27] hand reaches out and touches
[8:30] john and raises him up my friends
[8:34] have you ever had a touch from jesus
[8:37] oh have you ever heard that song
[8:40] he somebody touched me somebody
[8:44] touched me while i was praying
[8:47] praying to jesus somebody
[8:50] touch my soul oh have you ever
[8:54] had a healing touch to your body
[8:57] have you ever had a supernatural touch
[9:00] of the lord
[9:01] upon your soul have you had a comforting
[9:05] touch upon your heart oh may we
[9:08] not just us touching the hem of his
[9:11] garment
[9:12] but may he turn and touch us
[9:15] and change our lives forever that we may
[9:19] bring glory to his marvelous name
[9:22] also i must say
[9:26] the very sound of his voice was a
[9:29] blessing to john
[9:31] the sound of god's voice to a true
[9:34] believer
[9:35] can never be underestimated
[9:38] just to hear the tones a crying baby
[9:43] hearing its mother's voice oh what a
[9:46] comfort to take away all her stress
[9:49] of his stress all the frustration
[9:52] all the murmurings the complainings
[9:55] the hunger the first is taken away
[9:59] once that baby hears its mother's voice
[10:03] oh what a comforting voice when
[10:06] a a a young boy or
[10:09] young woman is being attacked
[10:12] in some way or they allah and their
[10:15] father steps up on the scene and they
[10:19] hear his voice saying
[10:20] fear not for i am here i am with you
[10:25] oh what a blessed thing to hear the
[10:28] voice of god
[10:30] and john heard the voice of god
[10:33] that was comforting that same voice that
[10:36] says
[10:36] fear not don't you be afraid
[10:40] i am the first and the last
[10:44] i am he that liveth and
[10:47] was dead but behold i am alive forever
[10:52] more oh praise god what is there to fear
[10:57] oh my what is there for us to fear
[11:01] i believe that fear is one of the
[11:04] worst spirits that has been attacking
[11:08] the body of jesus christ christians
[11:12] living their lives in fear fear of
[11:14] sickness
[11:15] fear of financial hardship fear of
[11:18] death all manner of pains and aches and
[11:21] troubles and trials and
[11:23] tribulations oh living
[11:26] constantly in some form of
[11:30] fear but what is there to fear
[11:33] what is there to dread when we are
[11:36] leading on the everlasting arms
[11:39] of our blessed lord jesus like john
[11:43] did when he was alive let us lean upon
[11:46] the word amen
[11:47] let's lean on this good friend the word
[11:50] of
[11:51] god for a friend that stick it closer
[11:54] than a brother you can trust him you can
[11:58] believe him
[11:59] for his word and his promises surely
[12:02] come to pass oh thank god we don't have
[12:06] to fear
[12:07] judgment anymore because my brothers
[12:10] they that live and believe on him have
[12:13] passed from
[12:14] death onto life we are
[12:18] living or having eternal life
[12:20] spiritually
[12:22] already a never-ending
[12:25] life resides within you made that
[12:29] anchor your soul your experience
[12:32] and your heart to the word of god
[12:35] knowing that heaven not hell not death
[12:38] not
[12:39] grave nothing can shake you or separate
[12:43] you
[12:43] from the love of god that is in
[12:47] the lord jesus christ for you are
[12:50] one of his own and his eyes are
[12:54] on the sparrow and he's watching
[12:57] over you never mind all
[13:00] that you may be going through now the
[13:03] judgment
[13:04] that was supposed to come upon us fell
[13:06] upon him
[13:07] at the cross and he took it upon
[13:11] himself he became our bumper
[13:15] he became our shock observer
[13:19] because he took the shock of sin he took
[13:22] the
[13:22] bops of the devil upon him for the bible
[13:26] said that he
[13:27] was afflicted but he opened not his
[13:31] mouth how there god struck him
[13:34] at calvary but he was the bumper he was
[13:37] the
[13:38] man standing in the gap oh my
[13:42] he was our redeemer our savior that
[13:45] stood the
[13:46] test of time oh glory to god
[13:49] here he is we thank you my my lord my
[13:53] savior i thank you well thank you for
[13:55] your wonderful
[13:56] works to the children of man as i was
[13:59] just saying
[14:01] he was her bumper or shock observer
[14:04] he was our substitute everything took
[14:07] upon himself
[14:09] my friends and because of that
[14:12] there is therefore no condemnation
[14:16] to them that are in christ jesus
[14:19] because he took it he took the
[14:22] condemnation
[14:23] he became sin for us he who
[14:26] knew no sin the peerless pure
[14:30] clear crystal clear
[14:34] word of god became my friends
[14:37] the one who took upon himself
[14:40] our sins and our sufferings and
[14:43] sicknesses
[14:44] and therefore there is no condemnation
[14:48] for he was not only our lawyer or
[14:51] our advocate but remember he is
[14:55] also the judge and the
[14:58] judge says pardoned
[15:02] the judge says you are not guilty
[15:06] the judge says case closed
[15:10] the judge says you are justified
[15:14] you are set free as if you
[15:17] never did anything wrong your
[15:21] record he has struck off
[15:24] every record every writing
[15:27] and every curse that was against you he
[15:29] struck it off
[15:30] by the blood of jesus christ that bleach
[15:34] blood of christ in which anything falls
[15:37] it makes it clears and takes away every
[15:40] guiltless stain
[15:42] and makes you free and makes your
[15:45] white ass snow my friends if you trust
[15:49] in him
[15:49] the word of god jesus christ hallelujah
[15:53] he has promised in his word on the on
[15:56] the
[15:57] path of confession on your past my
[16:00] friends
[16:00] of acting and demonstrating a committed
[16:04] consecrated and repentant life
[16:08] that he would forgive you of your sins
[16:11] and take you as his own if you do
[16:15] this now the lord jesus christ
[16:18] will come into your life and never
[16:22] ever leave you evermore
[16:25] lord of god so therefore my friends
[16:28] with our case settled with us being
[16:32] not guilty with us being in a set
[16:35] with us being a justice if nothing has
[16:38] ever happened before
[16:40] with us being in a state where every
[16:44] writing every charge that every
[16:46] accusation of the devil
[16:48] has been struck off by the word of god
[16:52] by the cleansing blood of jesus christ
[16:55] and now therefore there is
[16:59] no condemnation
[17:02] to you and i if we
[17:06] are in our lord jesus
[17:09] christ hallelujah so why should the
[17:12] church fear
[17:14] no promise he has made has ever failed
[17:18] and everywhere we should never
[17:22] live our christian life anymore
[17:25] in the fear of punishment we
[17:28] should not live our christian life in
[17:31] any fair of going to hell because the
[17:35] word of god
[17:36] tells us categorically
[17:39] we have already passed
[17:43] from death into
[17:46] life i want you to be
[17:49] conscious and clearly aware
[17:53] the genuine christian
[17:56] does not have any hell
[18:00] in their future we have
[18:03] gone into the fires of trials
[18:07] tribulation
[18:08] tests proving god proving his word
[18:12] that is his part of him and he has tried
[18:16] the word prove the word
[18:18] and we have come out like the three
[18:21] boys out of the fiery furnace and we
[18:24] have
[18:25] no fire and brimstone
[18:28] smell of hell upon our lives
[18:31] no worldliness upon our lives
[18:34] no smell of smoke upon our lives
[18:38] for we have been set free by the power
[18:42] and presence of god within our lives oh
[18:45] thank god i'm free i'm free free from
[18:48] this world of sin
[18:50] i've been washed in the blood i've been
[18:53] born again oh
[18:54] hallelujah i'm saved i'm saved by his
[18:57] wonderful grace
[18:59] oh thank god we are free to
[19:02] tonight and we give him all the praise
[19:05] the honor i
[19:06] give glory for this victorious christ
[19:08] for without his
[19:10] victory where would we be without jesus
[19:13] oh we would still be prisoners of satan
[19:17] but we are set free by the hand of the
[19:20] mighty
[19:21] lion of the tribe of judah who
[19:24] has broken our every
[19:27] chain and now we can shake off our
[19:31] shackles
[19:32] we can walk out of our prison doors
[19:35] we can walk into the glorious liberty
[19:38] of the sons of god the children of god
[19:42] the people of god and walk in the light
[19:46] of his presence the light
[19:49] of the word of the hour oh glory to god
[19:53] oh thank god that he is the mighty
[19:57] conqueror
[19:58] he is the one who wrapped the veil
[20:02] into yes he is the one
[20:05] who ripped it from the top to the bottom
[20:08] and opened the way the more excellent
[20:12] way into the presence of god so that we
[20:16] may come boldly before the throne of
[20:19] grace
[20:20] of god hallelujah mighty conqueror
[20:24] here he is the one who conquered
[20:28] the world of the scene and of the unseen
[20:31] demonstrated an authority over devils
[20:35] over every disease and even death
[20:38] demonstrating that he is the living one
[20:42] the one who conquers all why should we
[20:46] fear he is greater than alexander
[20:49] the so-called great who lived his life
[20:53] as a conqueror upon the earth and
[20:56] after a while at the age of 33
[21:01] when there was nowhere else to turn
[21:04] nothing
[21:04] else to do after living a life
[21:08] and becoming a victim of sin
[21:11] a victim of his riotous living
[21:14] a victim of his own success may god help
[21:18] you
[21:18] that you do not become a victim of your
[21:20] so-called success
[21:22] that you do not become a victim of your
[21:25] ambitions
[21:26] but that you my friends surrender your
[21:29] life to the
[21:30] victorious christ that he might reign
[21:33] and rule within your heart and there was
[21:36] alexander
[21:37] after all his conquests died as a
[21:41] victim to his own wicked living
[21:44] and he also this victorious christ
[21:48] was not like napoleon bonaparte
[21:52] who conquered all europe
[21:55] and finally had to meet his
[21:58] defeat at waterloo and
[22:01] later as you know was banished to the to
[22:04] elba
[22:05] there he was at that time
[22:09] finding himself he who was a conqueror
[22:12] found himself conquered but this man
[22:16] after he had conquered he sat down
[22:19] hallelujah
[22:20] the case is settled he sat down it's
[22:23] over
[22:24] it is finished there is nothing now to
[22:27] fear
[22:28] nothing now to dread we lean upon his
[22:32] everlasting right arm of his
[22:36] power glory to god there was nothing
[22:38] that could conquer
[22:40] our lord jesus satan made so many
[22:43] stabs and at him the
[22:47] not this sword piercing not the spear
[22:50] piercing
[22:51] not the nails in his hands not the
[22:54] temptations on the mountain
[22:56] not any disease that ever came in his
[22:59] presence that could defeat him no
[23:02] trouble no trial
[23:03] not even death he rose up from the grave
[23:07] up from the
[23:08] graveyard rose with a mighty triumph
[23:11] oh hallelujah thank god for this
[23:14] victorious
[23:16] ever conquering christ the same one
[23:19] we bless his holy name lord of god
[23:22] and so he is greater than alexander the
[23:26] great
[23:26] and has ascended up into heaven
[23:30] to manifest what he has said her hair
[23:33] upon the earth
[23:34] and as the scripture says he has been
[23:37] given
[23:39] a name that is above every name
[23:42] that at the name of jesus because he has
[23:45] conquered
[23:46] all things at the name of jesus
[23:50] every knee shall bow why
[23:54] the king is coming and when the king is
[23:56] coming the heralds blew the trumpet
[23:59] and everything falls down at his feet
[24:02] every knee shall bow every tongue shall
[24:06] confess
[24:07] that jesus christ is indeed
[24:10] our lord and master conquering
[24:14] death hell and the grave and he has the
[24:17] keys thereof
[24:19] no one else has the keys of death hell
[24:22] and the grave
[24:23] oh my friends all these men
[24:26] made doctrines and teachings of men
[24:30] and symbolisms of man used to bring
[24:33] about paganistic trolldom
[24:36] upon the hearts minds and lives of men
[24:38] and women
[24:39] and keep them in the spiritual darkness
[24:42] of the word of god
[24:43] but rise shine your light is come
[24:47] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[24:50] you
[24:50] come to him now and repent confess
[24:54] surrender if you are a christian walk
[24:58] deeper in his love walk deeper in his
[25:00] grace
[25:01] walk with confidence knowing that when
[25:04] you have come to the
[25:05] end of the way the last mile of the way
[25:09] oh friend you will walk out into
[25:12] life eternal you will not go down to the
[25:15] cliff
[25:16] of death or hell but you'll rise to live
[25:19] eternal
[25:20] in the presence of almighty god amen

[31:56] for his glory if we know how if we allow
[32:00] the holy spirit
[32:01] to teach us how all his power is
[32:04] for us to use first of all of course the
[32:08] first principle will be
[32:09] to know when and how under his direction
[32:13] to speak the word for the entire
[32:16] creation
[32:16] entire world everything that has ever
[32:18] been formed or done
[32:20] was done by the spoken word of god
[32:23] but it's not just speaking the bible of
[32:25] reading a verse
[32:27] neither is it it's just standing there
[32:29] and saying let this be here and let that
[32:32] be there
[32:32] it's not simple as that it's us it's
[32:35] just
[32:36] humbling yourself to god so that he can
[32:39] use you
[32:39] when he chooses to use you for his glory
[32:42] now
[32:43] that is part of the turtle of his divine
[32:47] presence and whatever god anoints you in
[32:50] an hour like that under his direction to
[32:53] perform or to share do
[32:55] it shall come to pass because he is the
[32:58] living one
[32:59] that lives in us and has made a grace
[33:02] covenant
[33:03] with us thank god now in this very
[33:06] chapter of revelation 1
[33:10] moving on to verse 20 and the mystery of
[33:14] the seven stars
[33:15] which down source in my right hand
[33:19] and the seven golden candlesticks the
[33:22] seven
[33:22] stars are the angels or messengers
[33:27] of the seven churches and the seven
[33:30] candlesticks
[33:31] which those sources are the seven
[33:34] churches hallelujah here right in the
[33:36] scriptures we have the interpretation
[33:38] we already have the truth we don't have
[33:41] to take what any man says
[33:43] or any person or school says but we can
[33:46] take what the lord himself
[33:48] says that these seven stars represent
[33:52] oh glory to god seven
[33:55] angels seven messengers at john's time
[33:59] that were to come amen hallelujah
[34:03] of course we realized that this was to

[34:07] and also make clear that these
[34:11] seven candlesticks are speaking
[34:14] of the seven churches hallelujah
[34:17] oh my with god's help we'll look at
[34:20] these things within the word of god
[34:22] that we might grow and develop a clearer
[34:26] understanding of what god wants us
