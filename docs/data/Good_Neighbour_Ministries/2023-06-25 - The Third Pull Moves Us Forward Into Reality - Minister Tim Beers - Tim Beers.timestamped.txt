[45:47] is just to allow him to live through us
[45:51] allow him to be expressed to this Dying
[45:53] World because they need to see something
[45:55] different they need to see life they
[45:58] need to see hope
[46:00] they need to find peace and that's only
[46:01] in Christ so I don't want to take any
[46:04] more time because I'm a man of few words
[46:07] but it's wonderful to see it keep
[46:09] pressing on just relax
[46:13] just relax and let the word live
[46:16] right A lot of times women cannot get
[46:19] pregnant because they're so nervous and
[46:21] worried about it
[46:23] you know and they end up relaxing and
[46:25] forget about it and they bring forth a
[46:27] child
[46:29] they're able to conceive right so stress
[46:32] in all these things we fret about just
[46:34] hinders the word from moving through us
[46:37] just let the word of God have his way in
[46:40] your life God bless your Saints it's a
[46:41] blessing to see you and thank you for

[52:27] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[52:30] have already obtained either were
[52:34] already already perfect but I follow

[52:42] for which I also am apprehended of Jesus
[52:46] Christ
[52:47] of Christ Jesus Brethren I count it not
[52:51] myself to have apprehended but this one
[52:54] thing I do forgetting those things which
[52:58] are behind

[54:45] Hallelujah but this one thing Paul says
[54:49] forget in those things are which are
[54:51] behind and reaching for those things
[54:54] which are ahead we got a lot to reach
[54:57] for my brothers and sisters
[54:59] oh my God just given us a word in this
[55:03] hour such a mighty word in this hour
[55:06] hallelujah it's just full amen their
[55:10] Storehouse is just full of food there's

[55:23] waiting to unveil it to you open those
[55:26] seals to you open those mysteries of who
[55:28] you are to you in this hour and in this
[55:31] day amen we are new creatures in Christ
[55:35] all things have become all things have
[55:39] become new with us amen and we don't
[55:42] look to the old things Paul's saying
[55:45] here that uh when he's talking about
[55:48] apprehended he's saying listen just like
[55:50] he says I'm not what I used to be but
[55:52] amen but I'm not what I want to be but
[55:55] I'm not what I used to be he's talking
[55:58] about a walk a progression of faith in
[56:00] his walk in his maturity amen he's
[56:03] saying listen I'm not there yet
[56:06] hallelujah we're not there yet Saints
[56:08] but I'm moving towards that place amen
[56:11] I'm looking to Christ Jesus the word I'm
[56:14] looking to the faith that has been
[56:16] delivered to the Saints in this hour by
[56:18] a spoken word prophet and I'm looking to
[56:21] that and and I'm moving towards that
[56:25] amen
[56:26] Oh Glory to God hallelujah thank you
[56:29] Lord Jesus amen
[56:31] thank you Lord hallelujah now another uh
[56:36] thing here I don't want to get ahead of
[56:38] myself you know you know me I just try
[56:41] to get ahead of myself sometimes
[56:43] and here in Philippians in The New
[56:45] International Version it says all this I
[56:48] have already arrived at my goal but I
[56:52] pressed on to take hold of that which
[56:55] which Christ Jesus Took a hold for me
[56:58] brothers and sisters I do not consider
[57:01] myself yet a taken hold of it yet but
[57:04] one thing I do forgetting those things
[57:07] amen what is behind me and I'm straining
[57:10] towards what's ahead of me I press
[57:13] towards the goal amen the mark the goal
[57:16] the word in this hour amen hallelujah to
[57:21] win the prize for God has called me this
[57:26] walk he has called me in this direction
[57:28] amen glory to God hallelujah thank you
[57:33] Lord amen perseverance it means to be
[57:37] persistent to make a goal to be
[57:40] persistent you have you have got your
[57:43] mind rain set on something and you're
[57:47] persistent about it and because of it
[57:49] you believe it the thing that you want
[57:52] you are believing that you are going to
[57:55] get it and that's what Jesus meant when
[57:57] he says when you say to this mountain be
[58:00] removed amen and don't doubt in your
[58:03] heart that means you already know you're
[58:06] going to get it you already see it in
[58:10] your future you already seen it come to
[58:13] the manifestation in your life
[58:15] and that's what you're moving towards
[58:18] listen without a vision the people
[58:20] perish Hallelujah without a vision of
[58:23] this word a revelation of this word
[58:25] where are you going
[58:27] you're coming to a message Church you
[58:30] you're brought up in the message you
[58:32] stay under the message church but where
[58:34] are you going there's got to be a vision
[58:36] there's got to be a purpose there's got
[58:38] to be a revelation revealed to you
[58:41] there's a life a manifested life a token
[58:45] that is here that God wants to put on
[58:48] display
[58:49] and that's what we're moving forward to
[58:51] we're not looking to the world
[58:54] it's gross Darkness out there
[58:57] you talk about being totally blacked out
[59:01] oh my
[59:02] there's no hope out there
[59:05] there's no future out there
[59:08] Hallelujah not to the Bride of Jesus
[59:10] Christ she's not holding on to anything
[59:13] that's out there
[59:15] then why are we slacking why are we lazy
[59:20] why ain't we pressing in
[59:23] why ain't we determined and straining
[59:25] for this Revelation to become one with
[59:28] us
[59:31] why ain't we moving forward
[59:34] don't look at brother Tim beers
[59:37] God put something on The Minister's
[59:39] heart he knows what he's saying
[59:42] my mind my heart is always blank by the
[59:45] grace of God
[59:46] amen I come up here just to speak what
[59:49] he wants me to speak
[59:51] Hallelujah
[59:54] yes
[59:59] then be persevered when you are
[1:00:02] perseverant
[1:00:04] when you get that word hold on to it
[1:00:09] hold on to the promise
[1:00:11] because that promise is yours
[1:00:16] Hallelujah
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:20] just like Jacob
[1:00:22] Jacob knew amen he wanted that
[1:00:25] Birthright
[1:00:27] and Jesus said you must be born again to
[1:00:30] enter into the kingdom of God
[1:00:32] Jacob wanted that Birthright so much
[1:00:35] that he wrestled with the angel and he
[1:00:38] said I'm not letting you go
[1:00:40] until I know that I'm blessed amen till
[1:00:45] I know amen that I know that I know amen
[1:00:49] that I got what you promised to me and
[1:00:52] that's the way we should be in this hour
[1:00:55] Hallelujah
[1:00:56] not question am I Born Again
[1:01:00] no you should be questioned whether
[1:01:02] you're born you should know that you're
[1:01:05] born again you should know that you're
[1:01:07] in the kingdom of God
[1:01:09] and this hour is too late in this hour
[1:01:11] and if you don't know it's time Amen to
[1:01:15] get on your knees and start praying
[1:01:19] in this hour
[1:01:21] Hallelujah
[1:01:23] moving forward with God means walking in
[1:01:26] faith and not fear
[1:01:29] when God calls us to move forward or
[1:01:32] asks us to make some changes fear will
[1:01:36] cause us to stay where we're at and not
[1:01:39] move forward with God
[1:01:41] sometimes we fear what people think or
[1:01:45] perhaps we fear whether we heard God
[1:01:47] correctly or not
[1:01:49] that is the greatest thing that holds
[1:01:52] people back fear from stepping out and
[1:01:56] moving forward when especially when God
[1:01:59] speaks to you
[1:02:02] we look at all the circumstances around
[1:02:04] it
[1:02:05] we look at our lives
[1:02:08] we look at whether whether uh we're
[1:02:10] worthy or we're we have the ability we
[1:02:13] look at all kinds of reasoning all kinds
[1:02:16] of excuses not to move forward not to
[1:02:19] press on
[1:02:20] and one of them is fear
[1:02:23] false evidence appear in real
[1:02:26] safe in this tool but it's a powerless
[1:02:29] tool and that's what we need to
[1:02:31] recognize it has no power in it
[1:02:37] glory to God moving forward also
[1:02:40] requires us of letting go
[1:02:43] let him go and letting God have his way
[1:02:47] that just sounds like a word amen but
[1:02:50] letting go of our our lives and letting
[1:02:54] go of our thoughts and letting go of
[1:02:56] everything around us that God has caused
[1:02:59] it's not easy sometimes
[1:03:01] it's not easy to press forward and let
[1:03:04] go of things
[1:03:06] but we gotta press in my brothers
[1:03:09] God has given us the tools he's given us
[1:03:12] the anointing to break the yoke
[1:03:17] oh my
[1:03:22] many different things letting go places
[1:03:25] people fears letting go of the ways we
[1:03:28] do things the way we think acts speak
[1:03:31] all kinds of things
[1:03:33] it's not easy my brothers and sisters to
[1:03:35] die
[1:03:37] Paul says I Die daily but it's not easy
[1:03:39] to die
[1:03:40] I don't care if anybody says here oh I
[1:03:42] came to the Lord it was so easy let go
[1:03:44] of everything to die out to everything
[1:03:47] I question that person
[1:03:49] amen I'd watch what that person is
[1:03:51] saying because it's not easy
[1:03:54] we got the glory of God Amen in the seed
[1:03:58] of God who does not sin we got the
[1:04:00] attribute of God but we're walking
[1:04:02] through a dimension to bring that
[1:04:04] attribute into manifestation but there's
[1:04:07] a flesh amen there's a there's a
[1:04:10] dimension here that we have to fight
[1:04:12] that are filled with demons demon powers
[1:04:14] amen that we got to press through and we
[1:04:17] gotta fight and we gotta move forward
[1:04:20] in this hour
[1:04:22] glory to God
[1:04:24] amen every time you want to overcome
[1:04:26] something every time you want God
[1:04:29] reveals something to your heart amen you
[1:04:31] know you got to let it go remember
[1:04:33] behind that unbelief there's a demon
[1:04:35] there and that demon will fight you
[1:04:37] right to the end
[1:04:39] but you've got to have faith and take
[1:04:41] the word that God spoke into your heart
[1:04:43] and move forward
[1:04:46] you keep saying boo to that devil he'll
[1:04:49] get smaller he'll get smaller just don't
[1:04:52] stop keep going
[1:04:56] Hallelujah
[1:04:58] amen
[1:05:00] moving forward with God means walking
[1:05:03] towards our Divine Purpose
[1:05:05] the closer we get to our breakthrough
[1:05:08] to our Divine Purpose the more the enemy
[1:05:11] will try to distract us
[1:05:14] he will attempt to send naysayers
[1:05:17] negative people to convince that we
[1:05:20] should turn back
[1:05:23] but we must hold on to the fact that God
[1:05:27] has our future planned
[1:05:29] and if we let go of the past
[1:05:32] you see the past is a place we can learn
[1:05:36] from but we should never live in the
[1:05:39] past
[1:05:40] we've got to live in the present in the
[1:05:44] moment
[1:05:45] I'm not the same person I was last week
[1:05:47] that I am today
[1:05:50] and either are you the manner you had
[1:05:52] last week is no good today you need
[1:05:55] something by the spirit of God in your
[1:05:58] soul today
[1:06:00] because this is a progression of Faith a
[1:06:02] progression of Revelation that God is
[1:06:05] doing
[1:06:06] God's truth is marching on
[1:06:09] amen it's marching on the Rapture is on
[1:06:13] the event is coming Hallelujah
[1:06:18] Satan the enemy's trying to like the
[1:06:21] scripture says lukewarm laziness locked
[1:06:24] where where right here right here is
[1:06:29] where he's at the closest to the word
[1:06:31] the closest to the truth that's where
[1:06:34] he's always been right from the Garden
[1:06:36] of Eden
[1:06:37] it is not going to go out there
[1:06:39] you think he's going to focus his time
[1:06:41] and his energy on making them lukewarm
[1:06:45] powerless lazy no right here
[1:06:48] because there's a power here that can
[1:06:51] overcome him
[1:06:52] there's a life here
[1:06:54] that if that life gets in the flesh
[1:06:57] that life gets awakened in us all his
[1:07:00] kingdom will be shaken and Shook and
[1:07:03] defeated
[1:07:05] glory to God hallelujah
[1:07:08] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:07:13] I preach you Paul and you pray
[1:07:15] amen
[1:07:18] glory to God
[1:07:20] brother Brown is speaking here in the
[1:07:21] seventh seal
[1:07:22] remember Satan will try to impersonate
[1:07:25] he'll try to impersonate everything that
[1:07:27] the church will do
[1:07:29] and we noticed it through down through
[1:07:31] the Antichrist
[1:07:32] but this one thing he cannot impersonate
[1:07:35] there's no mimics to this see because he
[1:07:38] don't know it
[1:07:40] there's no way for him to know it are we
[1:07:42] listening
[1:07:44] I know I read this I'm going to keep
[1:07:45] reading it until you get it
[1:07:47] it's the third pull he just knows
[1:07:51] nothing about it you see he doesn't
[1:07:53] understand it
[1:07:58] nobody can explain it it can't be
[1:08:01] touched with man's hands
[1:08:03] nobody can interfere with it in your
[1:08:06] life your personal walk
[1:08:09] Satan has no clue of what's going on
[1:08:12] inside of you
[1:08:14] unless we open our mouths and then all
[1:08:17] he can do he still doesn't understand it
[1:08:19] but all he can do is try to bring
[1:08:21] distractions because he sees you moving
[1:08:23] your mouth moving in a certain direction
[1:08:26] and he wants to go and put distractions
[1:08:28] hindrance
[1:08:30] in your way
[1:08:31] that's why the Apostle Were Meant a few
[1:08:33] words they only spoke when they needed
[1:08:36] to speak
[1:08:37] Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord
[1:08:41] Satan is working hard to distract us
[1:08:44] deceive us and hinder us from seeing the
[1:08:46] truth that's why he fights us
[1:08:49] so we must not let Satan interpret the
[1:08:52] word to us personally to our walks and
[1:08:55] our lives because he knows nothing about
[1:08:58] this Revelation like we said before
[1:09:01] he's a liar
[1:09:03] you wouldn't listen to a liar and
[1:09:06] everything that comes out of his mouth
[1:09:07] is lies
[1:09:09] so why let him speak to you when he
[1:09:10] knows nothing about this
[1:09:13] I'm not going to go to somebody for uh
[1:09:16] for an issue or for a topic that knows
[1:09:18] nothing about this and this person knows
[1:09:20] everything about it I'm going to go to
[1:09:22] this person and I'm going to ask him not
[1:09:24] to I'm not going to listen to this
[1:09:25] person
[1:09:27] I see this resume
[1:09:29] it's defeated
[1:09:31] he lost
[1:09:33] he knows nothing about it he's a liar
[1:09:36] he's a cheat he's a destroyer but I'm
[1:09:39] going to go to where life is
[1:09:41] somebody who understands
[1:09:44] somebody who understands me inside only
[1:09:47] he can understand me that deep calling
[1:09:50] to the Deep
[1:09:52] God understands God
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:58] thank you Lord
[1:10:00] the devil the devil is nothing but a
[1:10:03] snake
[1:10:07] he has no arms
[1:10:09] and he has no feet
[1:10:12] so what is the interpretation of that
[1:10:17] he's been disarmed
[1:10:20] and defeated
[1:10:24] [Applause]
[1:10:26] rejoice
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:29] Hallelujah
[1:10:31] yes that's right that's who that's you
[1:10:35] know that's why Brother Brad said when
[1:10:36] you get there you're going to realize
[1:10:38] that little guy
[1:10:40] cause all this trouble
[1:10:42] in my life
[1:10:44] but you see the progression of faith the
[1:10:47] progression of moving on with the word
[1:10:50] that the progression of maturity in The
[1:10:52] Bride of Jesus Christ is coming to a
[1:10:54] place where she knows who she is she
[1:10:56] knows what she stands for there's a
[1:10:58] confidence a certainty about her amen
[1:11:02] that she knows all these things
[1:11:06] she recognizes her greatest enemies
[1:11:08] herself
[1:11:11] oh
[1:11:15] my
[1:11:18] so my brothers and sisters
[1:11:22] stop worrying
[1:11:26] trust in the Lord
[1:11:31] stop worrying
[1:11:35] oh don't act like nobody worries in here
[1:11:41] on speaking to a people that maybe I'm
[1:11:43] speaking Angels here nobody worries
[1:11:45] right
[1:11:46] yeah
[1:11:48] Hallelujah
[1:11:53] Jesus said don't worry about tomorrow
[1:11:56] oh how many times do we miss the moment
[1:12:00] how many times do we miss what God is
[1:12:02] doing now
[1:12:04] maybe even some of you thinking about
[1:12:05] tomorrow thinking about later on later
[1:12:08] on don't exist
[1:12:10] you might not make it outside these
[1:12:12] doors
[1:12:14] that don't exist
[1:12:16] what exists right now
[1:12:18] right now exists
[1:12:20] we shouldn't be worried about anything
[1:12:21] else
[1:12:22] but now and when we when we where we
[1:12:26] live in the now then God speaks to us
[1:12:28] now
[1:12:30] we want God now we want God now but we
[1:12:33] live in the future we live tomorrow next
[1:12:37] week
[1:12:38] no
[1:12:40] no
[1:12:42] that's not the way we walk as Sons and
[1:12:44] Daughters of God they're led by the
[1:12:46] spirit of the Living God Amen every
[1:12:49] moment
[1:12:51] thank you Lord
[1:12:53] stop being led by your feelings
[1:12:59] well what an age of feelings
[1:13:01] I feel this I feel I'm this I'm feeling
[1:13:04] that you hurt my feelings you offended
[1:13:07] me
[1:13:08] oh my God
[1:13:12] you know what truth don't care about
[1:13:14] your feelings
[1:13:18] yes yes feelings are great indicators
[1:13:21] they're great motivators
[1:13:22] but they are bad leaders
[1:13:25] oh my
[1:13:27] I guess that's why the Lord
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:31] hope there's no feminists in here this
[1:13:33] morning or that Spirit but I guess
[1:13:35] that's why the Lord
[1:13:37] said right back in the Book of Genesis
[1:13:39] amen
[1:13:40] that the woman keeps silent
[1:13:43] because why the man did not fall
[1:13:47] the women fell
[1:13:49] and that's why today women are not
[1:13:51] leaders
[1:13:52] Hallelujah
[1:13:54] and men are not dominators either
[1:13:57] okay
[1:13:58] it goes both ways men love their their
[1:14:02] women like Christ loved the church and
[1:14:04] gave his life but women don't dominate
[1:14:07] over the man and lead the men because
[1:14:09] they're emotional creatures
[1:14:12] no man of God is led by a woman I'll
[1:14:16] tell you that right now we can get
[1:14:18] inspired right but not LED there's a
[1:14:21] different story
[1:14:24] glory to God
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:29] moving forward with God means walking
[1:14:32] into our Divine Purpose which God
[1:14:34] determined even before the foundation of
[1:14:37] the world before we even born Jeremiah 1
[1:14:39] 5 as we progressed the enemy will
[1:14:42] attempt to pursue us and change
[1:14:46] that us that change is impossible
[1:14:50] the enemy wants to convince us that our
[1:14:53] best days are gone
[1:14:55] but God has a track record of giving new
[1:14:59] life even when it seems to be too late
[1:15:02] just as he did with Abraham
[1:15:05] you're never too old amen
[1:15:09] God can speak and change that from The
[1:15:13] Young to the old
[1:15:15] so we should never ever think in our
[1:15:18] lives well we're getting up in age
[1:15:22] you know I'm I'm up in age you know and
[1:15:25] you know what
[1:15:27] for men
[1:15:29] Auntie Paws I guess they call it and
[1:15:31] they're for women menopause they call it
[1:15:33] all kinds of excuses come in
[1:15:36] in that period of time yes there's a
[1:15:38] chemical change in your body yes there's
[1:15:41] things going on but let me tell you one
[1:15:44] thing if I can't get it right now I'm
[1:15:47] reaching for that change for that word
[1:15:50] for that Faith Amen to overcome
[1:15:53] whatever's needed so I don't make
[1:15:55] excuses for the devil
[1:15:57] and this flesh
[1:16:03] yeah I know what's going through your
[1:16:04] mind
[1:16:06] yeah but that's that's fine
[1:16:12] listen
[1:16:15] either we believe God's word
[1:16:18] or nothing
[1:16:19] you don't have to agree with me you
[1:16:21] don't have to even like my style of
[1:16:23] preaching amen but the word of God
[1:16:26] it's the truth
[1:16:28] especially if the spirit of God is
[1:16:29] speaking to you
[1:16:31] you want to walk out these doors
[1:16:33] different you want to walk out of the
[1:16:35] tent of the Holy Ghost this morning
[1:16:36] different change
[1:16:39] then believe God's word believe for the
[1:16:41] impossible like Abraham and Sarah did
[1:16:45] passage looked impossible but they
[1:16:49] believed God's word
[1:16:51] and he said my promise he said Abraham
[1:16:54] said God your promises are true if all
[1:16:57] things fail your promises can't fail and
[1:17:00] that's the way we got to be with the
[1:17:02] word of God today
[1:17:05] oh my
[1:17:10] God hallelujah
[1:17:12] it means that you are willing to
[1:17:14] continue even during difficult times
[1:17:21] it also implies that you are fighting
[1:17:24] until obstacles no matter how huge they
[1:17:27] are are overcome
[1:17:30] but moving forward also means that you
[1:17:33] do not allow external circumstances to
[1:17:37] stop you from pursuing the mark pursuing
[1:17:41] that that Faith from manifesting in your
[1:17:43] life
[1:17:45] no matter what my brothers and sisters
[1:17:47] what God has spoken
[1:17:50] what God has revealed it shall come to
[1:17:54] pass in your life
[1:17:57] he will perform it
[1:18:01] in your life
[1:18:04] we didn't get a promise from Men
[1:18:07] the word comes to a prophet
[1:18:09] the prophet speaks it
[1:18:11] amen but what what do we hear
[1:18:15] that still a small voice was not the
[1:18:16] prophet's voice
[1:18:18] it was the Lord Jesus Christ's voice
[1:18:21] he's the one that's building faith in us
[1:18:24] the book of Hebrews 12 1 wherefore
[1:18:27] seeing we are also compass with a about
[1:18:30] with such a great cloud of witnesses
[1:18:33] oh my
[1:18:36] I was thinking about that the great
[1:18:38] cloud of witnesses that are here
[1:18:41] just think of what he said in the
[1:18:42] scriptures here we are Compass we are uh
[1:18:47] entertained
[1:18:49] we are accompanied accompanied with with
[1:18:52] with such a great cloud of witnesses
[1:18:55] that have gone before us and then he
[1:18:57] says lay aside every weight

[1:19:46] not walk run with patient the race that
[1:19:49] sets before us looking unto Jesus not
[1:19:52] looking to anything else now look into
[1:19:55] our circumstances our flesh the devil
[1:19:57] the world looking unto Jesus the author
[1:20:01] and finisher the beginner the Ender of
[1:20:04] our faith
[1:20:08] oh my
[1:20:10] glory to God
[1:20:14] I was thinking about that
[1:20:16] and how many times I've had experiences
[1:20:19] don't don't don't don't ask me to I just
[1:20:23] don't understand
[1:20:24] but I was texting with sister Marsha
[1:20:28] and we were texting back and forth
[1:20:30] and she mentioned Daniel in the text
[1:20:33] and when she when I read that text
[1:20:36] I can't explain it but he was there
[1:20:39] in my heart
[1:20:41] I almost started weeping
[1:20:43] amen and I said sister when you said
[1:20:46] that and she goes yes brother because
[1:20:48] it's the bond of love the Eternal Bond
[1:20:51] of love
[1:20:52] and I thought about that and I said and
[1:20:54] I got to that scripture there's a cloud
[1:20:56] of witnesses oh my they're closer than
[1:20:59] you think
[1:21:00] this is closer than you think we're
[1:21:03] nearer than the end and you think my
[1:21:05] brothers and sisters

[1:21:08] urging us to press on
[1:21:11] Glory
[1:21:13] almost home
[1:21:15] amen almost home brother Simon
[1:21:18] amen Hebrews 4 says there's a rest for
[1:21:21] the Saints the rest is knowing who you
[1:21:24] are
[1:21:25] the greatest battle that Satan fights us
[1:21:27] is knowing who we are because when we
[1:21:30] recognize who we are the rest comes
[1:21:35] that's where the perfect rest is that's
[1:21:38] the rest for the believer when you know
[1:21:41] that you know who you are
[1:21:44] Satan can't play around with you if he
[1:21:47] does you take that word of God and you
[1:21:49] chop your way through every enemy that
[1:21:52] comes in your way get out of my way
[1:21:54] Satan
[1:21:56] glory to God
[1:21:58] oh Hallelujah
[1:22:00] yes we thirst for that profession
[1:22:03] and we may never get it in this flesh
[1:22:05] but in our souls there's a rest because
[1:22:09] we know who we are the people of this
[1:22:11] world is in chaos confusion and
[1:22:14] perversion is everywhere in the flesh
[1:22:17] because they don't know who they are
[1:22:21] and Satan has got them to go insane
[1:22:25] which means in sin unbelief in their
[1:22:28] minds nobody knows who they are in this
[1:22:32] day and age except the people that have
[1:22:35] been chosen predestinated by the word of
[1:22:37] God to know who they are they are the
[1:22:40] ones that are moving forward into the
[1:22:42] Rapture they are the ones that are
[1:22:44] moving forward in perfect Faith they are
[1:22:46] their Overcomers in this age no other
[1:22:49] Overcomers my brothers and sisters
[1:22:53] you know they can get some victory out
[1:22:55] there
[1:22:56] let me make something clear they can get
[1:22:59] some victory out there faith is Faith
[1:23:00] right amen
[1:23:02] but they ain't getting this faith
[1:23:05] this victory
[1:23:06] they ain't going in a Rapture my
[1:23:08] brothers sisters why because brother Tim
[1:23:10] said so I'm being critical no how can
[1:23:13] they go into a Rapture when the Rapture
[1:23:15] faith is here and they don't got it
[1:23:19] how can you be healed if the doctor
[1:23:22] gives you the medicine and you don't
[1:23:23] take it
[1:23:28] you need to take it
[1:23:30] so stop feeding off of that out there
[1:23:33] God has given you a word
[1:23:36] this is the bride's food
[1:23:38] this is your food that will nourish you
[1:23:42] strengthen you
[1:23:43] what you need to overcome in your life
[1:23:46] every one of us are different every
[1:23:48] circumstance is different every flesh is
[1:23:50] different but God has given us all the
[1:23:52] tools he knew everything
[1:23:55] that we would have need of and he put it
[1:23:57] right here
[1:23:58] Hallelujah people say oh you know the
[1:24:02] message is not finished so they can
[1:24:04] complete this everything is completed
[1:24:07] you know why I don't look to the written
[1:24:09] word I look to the unwritten word
[1:24:12] I look at that written word it takes me
[1:24:15] places
[1:24:16] that's not written down there it takes
[1:24:18] me into areas shows me things to come
[1:24:21] shows me all kinds of things about my
[1:24:23] life
[1:24:27] and then I sit there and I go just like
[1:24:29] even preparing a preacher preparing for
[1:24:31] a message
[1:24:32] when you're prepared sometimes God shows
[1:24:34] you so many things I'm going in my head
[1:24:36] I'm going how how how am I going to
[1:24:39] bring this
[1:24:41] he goes you can't bring it I have to
[1:24:43] bring it
[1:24:45] oh my that's why I'm excited
[1:24:49] amen you might not be getting excited
[1:24:50] what you if you're like if you're being
[1:24:52] want to be tickled by by just good
[1:24:55] preaching or good public speaker amen
[1:24:57] that you might not see nothing
[1:25:00] but if you see the excitement that I
[1:25:02] have inside with the word and what he's
[1:25:05] doing and what he's speaking if you
[1:25:07] catch the same spirit and get behind the
[1:25:10] Same Spirit then you start opening it up
[1:25:12] to the Revelation the thought of God
[1:25:15] behind this
[1:25:17] that's what you start breaking into amen
[1:25:21] sometimes when we stop and think about
[1:25:23] what we have experienced the trials in
[1:25:26] our lives and and how we
[1:25:29] we cannot get stuck or we can get stuck
[1:25:33] in disappointments
[1:25:34] unforgiveness bitterness offense fear
[1:25:37] guilt anxiety insecurities indifference
[1:25:39] or lack of Interest or concern or
[1:25:43] Comfort or complacency
[1:25:45] we can get stuck
[1:25:48] stuck in our walk
[1:25:54] and yet moving forward we must find ways
[1:25:57] to move through these things
[1:26:00] the same exact places and more that we
[1:26:03] go through we must move through loss
[1:26:07] grief trials hardships sufferings
[1:26:10] feelings of disappointments mistakes and
[1:26:15] sure headaches
[1:26:16] we must learn
[1:26:19] and move through these because we all
[1:26:22] got them they all happened to us my
[1:26:25] brothers and sisters they all come in
[1:26:28] our lives
[1:26:30] we were all experience these things
[1:26:33] but God's word is encouraged in US amen
[1:26:37] that we can press through these things
[1:26:39] we can keep moving forward
[1:26:42] we can keep moving with God no matter
[1:26:45] what we experience it's not the end
[1:26:49] it's only a Bend
[1:26:50] amen God God said I'll make all things
[1:26:54] work together for your good he didn't
[1:26:56] say some things all things that means
[1:26:58] loss death comes our way he'll make all
[1:27:03] things work together for good
[1:27:06] oh my
[1:27:11] still I imagine we we all find it easy
[1:27:13] to stay stuck
[1:27:15] then risk moving forward
[1:27:18] and that we might come with it
[1:27:22] like stepping out into unfamiliar train
[1:27:26] and feeling even more uncomfortable
[1:27:30] like experience more hurt
[1:27:33] more disappointment more suffering more
[1:27:35] betrayal
[1:27:37] is a little wonder the writer of Hebrews
[1:27:40] said that we must focus our eyes on
[1:27:43] Jesus
[1:27:44] fixing our eyes on Jesus the pioneer and
[1:27:48] Perfecter of our faith for the joy that
[1:27:51] set before him he endured the cross
[1:27:54] taken the shame
[1:27:56] and sat down at the right hand of God
[1:27:59] Amen that's who we're following this
[1:28:02] morning
[1:28:04] there ain't nobody that suffered like
[1:28:06] him there's nobody that went through
[1:28:08] what he went through
[1:28:11] he can be we can be touched by the
[1:28:13] feeling he can be touched by the feeling
[1:28:15] of our infirmities because he knows
[1:28:18] everything in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:28:20] he experienced every demon from hell
[1:28:24] he took it all he didn't leave nothing
[1:28:27] undone my brothers and sisters he gave
[1:28:30] you their complete package he gave you
[1:28:32] the complete warranty of your guaranteed
[1:28:35] amen that you're going to make it
[1:28:37] through you're going to overcome you're
[1:28:40] going to defeat everything that comes
[1:28:41] your way you're going to be able to move
[1:28:43] on and press on
[1:28:46] all power in Heaven and Earth is given
[1:28:49] to him
[1:28:51] and he's given you power to tread on
[1:28:53] serpents and all over all the power of
[1:28:56] the enemy
[1:28:57] what's standing in your way
[1:28:59] yourself
[1:29:01] get yourself out of the way believe the
[1:29:04] word of God take the word apply the word
[1:29:07] in your life in that area of your life
[1:29:10] and move forward
[1:29:14] get out of that stuck
[1:29:16] state
[1:29:17] the stuck condition that you're in
[1:29:21] speaker here speaking
[1:29:23] when the global pandemic hit in 2020
[1:29:27] and then continue to unto 2021
[1:29:30] like most everyone I was tempted to look
[1:29:33] back
[1:29:34] I wanted to go back
[1:29:36] to 2019.
[1:29:38] or the years of Our Lives before 2020.
[1:29:42] to go back to normal
[1:29:44] whatever normal was
[1:29:47] to forget all the new normal that we
[1:29:50] were all desperately trying to create
[1:29:53] yet no matter how much I long to go back
[1:29:56] to normal
[1:29:58] there was no going back
[1:30:00] listen I knew when that when that
[1:30:02] pandemic hit there was a shift in the
[1:30:06] spirit
[1:30:07] I set a rate from the beginning to my
[1:30:09] wife
[1:30:09] I said things will never go back to
[1:30:12] normal
[1:30:13] there's been a shift right listen God's
[1:30:16] truth is marching on but let me tell you
[1:30:19] Satan's agenda is marching on too
[1:30:21] and that was a big move amen a big shift
[1:30:26] in his agenda to move this new world's
[1:30:28] order amen the mark of the beasts amen
[1:30:31] the World Council of churches amen into
[1:30:34] its into gear and if that is happening
[1:30:37] what is God doing amen what is God doing
[1:30:41] in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:30:44] he only impersonates what God is doing
[1:30:49] you talk about a shift in The Bride of
[1:30:51] Jesus Christ
[1:30:53] Hallelujah
[1:30:56] that
[1:30:58] much I long to go back to normal there
[1:31:00] was no going back that world as we knew
[1:31:03] it was finished
[1:31:04] and God was beckoning me along with
[1:31:07] everybody else to move forward and lay
[1:31:09] hold upon the purposes and Promises of
[1:31:12] the future of the word of God
[1:31:14] hallelujah amen
[1:31:17] glory to God
[1:31:19] now we see in the Bible here
[1:31:22] Hallelujah I still got time
[1:31:27] I still got time and I'm going to preach
[1:31:30] Hallelujah I'm the one up here sweating
[1:31:33] and not so you're just you just be
[1:31:35] patient with me
[1:31:38] oh I got hooked here
[1:31:41] Simon can you
[1:31:44] know when
[1:31:46] it's good
[1:31:47] got it
[1:31:49] hey man
[1:31:51] thank you brother
[1:31:53] Gabriel the Angel is always there to
[1:31:55] help
[1:32:02] amen
[1:32:05] now let us take a look
[1:32:09] at Lot's wife
[1:32:13] we look at Lot's wife in the Bible
[1:32:15] I never thought about this until I
[1:32:17] started reading in about it Lord's wife
[1:32:20] gets a small part in the Old Testament
[1:32:22] and a little small part in the New
[1:32:24] Testament that's it
[1:32:26] that's all the scripture records
[1:32:29] why would Jesus tell us to remember a
[1:32:33] woman who appears on the pages of the
[1:32:36] scriptures long enough to disappear
[1:32:39] a woman who has the shortest vital ever
[1:32:43] a woman who
[1:32:46] we don't even know her name
[1:32:49] think about it we don't even know her
[1:32:51] name it just says Lot's wife
[1:32:54] Hallelujah
[1:32:57] what is it about her
[1:33:00] that we are supposed to remember
[1:33:04] this woman was told one thing
[1:33:07] just like Eve was told don't eat of that
[1:33:10] tree
[1:33:11] if you do you'll die
[1:33:15] don't look back
[1:33:20] and the one thing she was told not to do
[1:33:23] is the one thing she did
[1:33:27] but lost wife from behind him foolishly
[1:33:31] longingly look back towards Sodom in an
[1:33:35] act of Disobedience and became a pillar
[1:33:37] assault
[1:33:39] think about it
[1:33:42] listen this message if it's telling us
[1:33:44] one thing
[1:33:46] don't look back
[1:33:49] don't look back
[1:33:53] move forward
[1:33:55] just like the scripture says
[1:33:57] amen when seven demons were cast out get
[1:34:01] that place filled
[1:34:03] with the word of God
[1:34:05] or else they'll come back with greater
[1:34:08] spirits
[1:34:09] Don't Look Back keep pressing forward
[1:34:12] amen
[1:34:14] she looked back longingly in an act of
[1:34:17] Disobedience we all make mistakes we all
[1:34:20] disobey at times and think she looked
[1:34:23] back longingly here she was living her
[1:34:26] life
[1:34:27] as usual and suddenly she was told to
[1:34:31] pack up and run for her life
[1:34:34] all the while the angel was holding her
[1:34:37] hand and guiding her
[1:34:40] listen think about it
[1:34:43] the angel was holding her hand and
[1:34:46] guiding them out of there out into
[1:34:48] safety
[1:34:49] listen haven't we had our angel
[1:34:52] don't we still got our angels
[1:34:55] holding our hand to faith in this hour
[1:34:59] guiding us out of here out of this out
[1:35:02] of this dimension
[1:35:05] and the angel holding her hand
[1:35:08] she long and she looked back and longing
[1:35:12] for those things behind there
[1:35:15] just think about it and became a pillar
[1:35:18] of salt
[1:35:21] dead
[1:35:23] paralyzed
[1:35:25] crippled
[1:35:28] by Looking Back
[1:35:33] what makes wife especially significant
[1:35:36] is that Jesus said for us to remember
[1:35:39] her in the middle of him preaching about
[1:35:42] death judgment and the final destination
[1:35:44] of the soul and human and humankind he
[1:35:48] disclosed in a New Testament and he
[1:35:50] dropped these three words
[1:35:53] remember Lot's wife
[1:35:57] think about it
[1:35:59] that Jesus stopped in the middle of his
[1:36:02] preaching
[1:36:04] Discerning the times Discerning the
[1:36:07] people's hearts because the word of God
[1:36:09] is quicker and sharper than any
[1:36:11] two-edged swords Discerning the very
[1:36:13] hearts of the people
[1:36:15] that he stopped and he says remember
[1:36:18] Lot's wife
[1:36:22] a warning
[1:36:24] Hebrews 10 38
[1:36:26] now the just shall live by faith
[1:36:29] but if any man draw back
[1:36:32] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:36:35] but we are not of them who draw back
[1:36:37] unto perdition
[1:36:39] but of them that believe to the saving
[1:36:43] of the Soul
[1:36:44] amen that's who we are
[1:36:49] no way
[1:36:51] I'm determined more than ever to keep
[1:36:55] pressing on to keep moving on with this
[1:36:57] word
[1:36:58] no matter how hard it gets how deceiving
[1:37:01] it gets in my own walk in my own life I
[1:37:05] got to keep pressing on I I passed the
[1:37:08] point of no return there's nowhere to go
[1:37:11] back for me
[1:37:12] there's no place in this world for me
[1:37:16] oh my when you still think you got a
[1:37:19] place in this world when you still think
[1:37:21] you can get comfort and security in this
[1:37:23] world let me tell you this world is
[1:37:26] going to be taken from out of your feet

[1:37:54] and He will draw near to you cleanse
[1:37:57] your hands you Sinners and purify your
[1:37:59] hearts ye double minded
[1:38:02] that's a person who looks back
[1:38:05] a double-minded person
[1:38:07] when they're given the truth
[1:38:09] what more do you need
[1:38:12] what more do we need in this hour than
[1:38:15] the word of God
[1:38:16] it's the truth
[1:38:18] listen there the the that new uh AI
[1:38:22] intelligent agency uh system is creating
[1:38:26] a new Bible
[1:38:27] for the World Council of churches as we
[1:38:30] speak
[1:38:31] and going to say to this word of God
[1:38:33] Amen that we read from King James is
[1:38:36] going to be no good anymore let me tell
[1:38:38] you we are written Epistles read of all
[1:38:42] man they can take the written word away
[1:38:45] from me all they want
[1:38:46] because I am the word I am the living
[1:38:51] manifestation of the word

[1:39:34] in the future but if they close down the
[1:39:36] churches whatever they try to scatter us

[1:39:43] the more they try to scatter us the more
[1:39:46] God's spirit will grow
[1:39:48] and manifest
[1:39:50] that's the short quick work he's going
[1:39:52] to do
[1:39:53] he's going to push us out there he's
[1:39:55] going to push you out there whether you

[1:40:09] word of God glory to God hallelujah
[1:40:17] when Lot's wife longered and lingered
[1:40:21] then she became hardened
[1:40:24] and stuck and Frozen in Time paralyzed
[1:40:27] in it for eternity as a pill or salt

[1:41:05] sometimes where we get hardened by the
[1:41:07] circumstances that happen in our lives
[1:41:10] Hallelujah

[1:46:13] often difficulties move on move into our
[1:46:16] lives we have experience of deep trauma
[1:46:18] pain suffering and feel of hopelessness
[1:46:20] helplessness moving on in this some
[1:46:25] something we know we should do what we
[1:46:28] often want to do and at times we
[1:46:31] actually refuse to do it is my prayer
[1:46:34] that you will be able to identify those
[1:46:37] places where you are prone to get stuck
[1:46:40] or maybe are stuck in right now and that
[1:46:44] you will refuse
[1:46:46] amen with the strength of the Holy
[1:46:49] Spirit and the word of God and take the
[1:46:52] next step by faith and get unstuck
[1:46:56] if we are stuck get take the word
[1:46:59] believe the word that's what he said
[1:47:01] only believe all things are possible get
[1:47:05] unstuck if your life is not on fire your
[1:47:08] prayer life is not on fire the word is
[1:47:11] not revealed get unstuck
[1:47:13] my brothers and sisters there should be
[1:47:16] a flow of the Holy Spirit God wants
[1:47:18] nothing more than reveal and speak to
[1:47:20] you and talk to you every day of your
[1:47:22] life he wants you to feel his presence
[1:47:24] all the time he wants to show you things
[1:47:27] to come be with you he wants to touch
[1:47:30] you heal you deliver you
[1:47:33] that's all he wants for you there's no
[1:47:35] bad in God there's only good in God
[1:47:37] loving God
[1:47:39] power overcoming power in God
[1:47:42] it's us we get stuck
[1:47:44] with this greatest enemy in our flesh
[1:47:47] things in our lives
[1:47:49] when you know you're you're under a
[1:47:51] spiritual talk
[1:47:53] loss of spiritual desire to stay on fire
[1:47:56] Galatians 5 14 First Corinthians 14.
[1:48:00] and you get unusual physical fatigue
[1:48:05] Isaiah 40 39 Philippians 4 13. if you
[1:48:10] are experienced constant sexual dreams
[1:48:12] you're under attack of the devil
[1:48:16] these are all realities my brothers and
[1:48:18] sisters these all will come
[1:48:22] and we meet we need to recognize these
[1:48:25] things and and by recognizing we take
[1:48:28] the word and we apply the word amen we
[1:48:31] applied what God has given us in prayer
[1:48:33] the power of prayer the power of the
[1:48:36] spoken word and we take it and we smash
[1:48:39] Satan's kingdom
[1:48:41] amen now listen to brother Brown here
[1:48:44] overcome means to recognize the devil in
[1:48:47] every one of his tricks that's what I'm
[1:48:49] saying
[1:48:50] don't you believe that
[1:48:53] there's no devil real devil
[1:48:56] he's just as real as any one of you else
[1:48:59] is here standing he's a devil he's a
[1:49:02] real devil and you must recognize him as
[1:49:04] real
[1:49:05] then at the same time you must recognize
[1:49:07] him and know that he's a devil and he's
[1:49:10] against you
[1:49:11] then to overcome you must recognize that
[1:49:16] the god that is in you is greater and
[1:49:18] mightier than he that is in the world
[1:49:23] and the one that is in you has already
[1:49:26] overcome him
[1:49:29] and by his grace you are more than a
[1:49:32] match for him
[1:49:34] There's real overcoming when you
[1:49:37] recognize
[1:49:40] that's what we preach the whole series
[1:49:42] on that recognizing the Great Awakening
[1:49:45] that has taken place
[1:49:47] there's power in that
[1:49:49] there's power in that word there's so
[1:49:51] much in that word
[1:49:53] in this hour
[1:49:54] nobody like we said earlier recognizes
[1:49:57] who they are but God is bringing a
[1:49:59] people to recognize who they are even a
[1:50:02] devil don't know who he is
[1:50:04] he knows what he is he's a liar Chief a
[1:50:06] thief and all that stuff
[1:50:08] amen but he doesn't recognize where he's
[1:50:10] going
[1:50:11] amen
[1:50:13] he thinks he's going to be saved
[1:50:15] people saying he's going to be saved
[1:50:17] God's going to have mercy on him a good
[1:50:20] loving God
[1:50:23] laughs
[1:50:24] oh my
[1:50:27] I'm here to tell you Satan no in the
[1:50:29] Book of Revelations it says the Lake of
[1:50:31] Fire
[1:50:32] that's where my God's going to send you
[1:50:36] I came to understand that acknowledging
[1:50:39] such endings and Beginnings is necessary
[1:50:41] to step forward and moving forward and I
[1:50:44] liken to it like Joshua experience after
[1:50:48] the death of Moses through the final
[1:50:50] chapter of Deuteronomy shows us that
[1:50:52] when Moses died God buried him and then
[1:50:57] God declared a time of mourning for
[1:51:00] Joshua and the children of Israel on the
[1:51:03] next very page of the Bible in the first
[1:51:07] two verses of the Book of Joshua God
[1:51:10] says to Joshua
[1:51:12] my servant Moses my servant is dead
[1:51:20] now
[1:51:21] you and all the people
[1:51:23] prepared to cross over Jordan to the
[1:51:27] land I am given the Israelites
[1:51:30] I can ask
[1:51:31] can I ask help
[1:51:33] but us
[1:51:35] why did God State the obvious to Joshua
[1:51:38] question mark
[1:51:40] doesn't Joshua know Moses is dead
[1:51:44] especially since God declared a season
[1:51:46] of mourning for Moses
[1:51:52] and yet God tells Joshua that Moses is
[1:51:55] dead and prepare to cross over signaling
[1:51:59] that one season had ended and a new
[1:52:02] season had started
[1:52:04] listen
[1:52:06] there's a there's there's a a message in
[1:52:09] there
[1:52:10] that's why he had to repeat it
[1:52:12] Joshua knew that Moses was dead there
[1:52:15] was a morning going on but then God had
[1:52:18] to come back again and say Moses is dead
[1:52:22] crossover move forward
[1:52:26] don't stay back in Moses Ministry cross
[1:52:29] over in Joshua's Ministry the Holy Ghost
[1:52:34] we know our our Moses is brother Branham
[1:52:38] brother Branham is dead now Joshua and
[1:52:42] calebs are here amen they're here this
[1:52:45] morning
[1:52:48] cross over keep moving forward
[1:52:53] glory to God
[1:52:55] amen
[1:52:57] just like Caleb brother Simon I was
[1:52:58] thinking about you amen Caleb in his old
[1:53:01] age he says old age give me that
[1:53:04] mountain
[1:53:06] give me that mountain I'll take that
[1:53:08] mountain Hallelujah
[1:53:11] oh my you talk about the word of God
[1:53:14] being so real in Joshua and Caleb amen
[1:53:17] age don't mean nothing when the word is
[1:53:19] on fire this this don't have an age
[1:53:22] inside it's eternally young amen this
[1:53:26] that's burning inside of me Revelation
[1:53:29] don't have the age on it it's just as
[1:53:31] new to me as it was when God opened my
[1:53:33] eyes 32 years ago
[1:53:35] or even more so you know I'm still on
[1:53:38] fire with it glory to God hallelujah
[1:53:42] amen
[1:53:48] no doubt in all our lives
[1:53:50] they're filled with transitions
[1:53:53] some we anticipate
[1:53:55] and some that Catches Us by surprise
[1:53:59] but in all of them there are
[1:54:01] opportunities
[1:54:03] for us to look back and get stuck or
[1:54:06] look ahead and keep moving on
[1:54:10] that's what it's all about my brothers
[1:54:11] and sisters that's why all these things
[1:54:13] come that's why Peter said Rejoice
[1:54:15] through your trials and troubles
[1:54:17] they're here to perfect you establish
[1:54:19] you strengthen you make you settle
[1:54:23] oh man build that those characters of
[1:54:25] Christ inside of you bring out those
[1:54:27] virtues out of you amen
[1:54:29] Hallelujah that's why when when Peter
[1:54:33] came and he recognized he recognized
[1:54:35] that through all that he went through
[1:54:37] amen he recognized that he says rejoice
[1:54:41] amen God deals with you God chastens you
[1:54:45] because God loves you
[1:54:47] because you've got a purpose in him
[1:54:50] amen hallelujah glory to God thank you
[1:54:54] Lord amen not every transition is hard
[1:54:57] of course but many of them are easier to
[1:55:00] move through than others perhaps because
[1:55:02] they are things that we prayed for or or
[1:55:04] dreamed about or worked hard for there
[1:55:07] are big wins in lives but for those
[1:55:09] transitions that we prayed not for and
[1:55:12] hope not for and desired not for if they
[1:55:16] ever happen there is a need to be a
[1:55:20] season of mourning first
[1:55:22] what more it's important to keep in mind
[1:55:25] that morning is for when anything dies
[1:55:31] a dream
[1:55:33] a hope a plan a goal a relationship
[1:55:39] all these things
[1:55:41] haven't we had them
[1:55:43] I know I've had them
[1:55:45] there's a time of warning
[1:55:48] these are simple things in our lives
[1:55:50] that we go through we experience
[1:55:53] but these these simple things that we go
[1:55:55] through and that are part of our life
[1:55:57] can affect our walk if we don't have the
[1:55:59] right positive mental attitude towards
[1:56:03] the word of God in these things
[1:56:05] that's what the spirit of God is saying
[1:56:07] we we can have a time of mourning you've
[1:56:10] been disappointed your dreams your hopes
[1:56:14] things you thought God was going to do
[1:56:16] in your life
[1:56:18] things you've you believed God was going
[1:56:21] to do
[1:56:22] and you've been disappointed
[1:56:25] but God Knows Best
[1:56:27] and that's who we trust in above all
[1:56:29] these things above above all our hopes
[1:56:32] and our dreams and what we think and
[1:56:34] what we interpret we trust him that he
[1:56:37] knows best what's best for our lives
[1:56:42] not trusting in the Lord keeps growing
[1:56:44] and growing more and more
[1:56:47] Hallelujah
[1:56:51] Now quickly I'm going to start winding
[1:56:52] this down
[1:56:54] there are eight ways to move forward
[1:56:58] stop letting the opinions of other
[1:57:00] control your life
[1:57:03] give up feeling shamed about your past
[1:57:06] failures
[1:57:08] be more decisive about what you want be
[1:57:11] certain of what you want
[1:57:13] stop procrastinating on goals
[1:57:16] quit choosing to do nothing
[1:57:19] that's a big one
[1:57:21] quit choosing to do nothing do something
[1:57:25] take a step of faith
[1:57:27] believe for something
[1:57:29] if you don't believe what are you going
[1:57:31] to believe
[1:57:32] nothing
[1:57:34] that nothing out of nothing gets you
[1:57:36] nothing
[1:57:37] you want more of God and take a step of
[1:57:40] faith and give them more of yourself
[1:57:42] Hallelujah
[1:57:46] you don't always need to be right
[1:57:50] stop running from your problems
[1:57:52] that you should be fixing
[1:57:56] don't make excuse
[1:57:58] excuses instead of decisions
[1:58:03] change in your mind and changing your
[1:58:05] plans then the Lord said to Moses why
[1:58:08] are you crying to me
[1:58:09] tell the Israelites to move on
[1:58:12] raise your stuff
[1:58:14] stretch out your hand over the sea and
[1:58:16] divide the waters so that the Israelites
[1:58:18] can go through on dry ground
[1:58:20] Moses stretched out his hands Over the
[1:58:23] Sea and over the and all that night the
[1:58:27] Lord drove the sea back with a strong
[1:58:30] East Wind and turned it into dry land
[1:58:33] the waters were divided let me tell you
[1:58:35] when you're praying amen just wait
[1:58:38] be patient with God because when you
[1:58:41] start praying for something God is
[1:58:44] driving back the waters he's driving
[1:58:46] back the enemies all night he was
[1:58:49] driving back those Waters amen
[1:58:52] he's working on your situation he's
[1:58:55] working in your life
[1:58:57] he's driving it back
[1:58:59] just believe never stop believing
[1:59:01] remember brother Brown says amen faith
[1:59:04] will bring it to you and it's coming it
[1:59:07] takes time but doubt will push it away
