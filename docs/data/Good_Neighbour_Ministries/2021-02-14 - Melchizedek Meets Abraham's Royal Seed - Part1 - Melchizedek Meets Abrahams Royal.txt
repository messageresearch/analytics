TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord a good sunday morning to you to all of you my dear and precious friends wherever you are and around the world god bless you in a marvelous and in a wonderful way as you have come into god's house on god's day with god's people to receive god's word may he break the bread of life and give you the waters of life to quench your thirst and your hunger for him may the lord bless us all together as we come together as a family of god once more to worship him and to glorify his great and mighty name hallelujah may the lord bless us all on this wonderful day around the world wherever we may be in your bibles shall we turn to luke chapter 17 reading from verses 18 28 sorry to 30. and it reads us likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it and the same day that the lord went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed praise god for the wonderful reading of his word the lord jesus christ speaking and telling us prophesying forewarning us that when we look to the world events or we look around us and see the conditions in the world social political educational in every form when we see the conditions similar to what was in sodom when those conditions are around us he says look for then the son of man will be revealed praise god i'm so happy to know that he is being revealed in our day and in our time by the opening of the word of god and making the the word of god plain to us for every one of us to understand for every one of us to humble ourselves to the word of god and to obey the word of god and walk in the light of your day and of your hour now what jesus was speaking of here was in the time of lot as it was in the days of lot well then we need to go back to the book of genesis around chapter 14 and uh verses 18 to 20 and we will find the story of abraham we will read how that abraham got word that his nephew lot who lived in sodom that he was captured by five kings and carried away into slavery and the bible tells us abraham called for his the 300 servants that he had with him and they girded themselves and got on their camels their horses and charged down after those five kings glory to god hallelujah amen those five kings of course my friends king touch king feel king here king c o praise god the five senses of the body as much as that was it was a symbol or a type of how the true believer would have to overcome or will be the overcomers over the five senses of the flesh and so abraham came down on with his servants oh praise god charged down upon them the bible said he defeated the five kings and every believer that believes god no matter what habits no matter what trouble no matter what trial no matter what sickness no matter what tribulation temptation comes your way i want to tell you definitively that god will grant you the power as he did to abraham to overcome every one of these five kings that tries to take you captive and to rule over your mind and over your body and over your life oh only believe all things are possible the them that will believe the word of god hallelujah thank you lord and so abraham became an overcomer defeating these five kings oh and on his return back the bible tells us one came out also to meet him and the name of the one that met abraham the bible says his name was melchizedek king of salem which means king of peace well you know the type the symbol jesus is the prince of peace but back then he was melchizedek king of salem praise god hallelujah you'll find the bible tells us this man melchizedek he was mysterious the other kings didn't know where he came from the bible tells us he had no mother no father no beginning no ending they simply did not know who he was well i'm here to tell you today who he was and who he is and who he will continue to be for abraham melchizedek and abraham met in the beginning of the bible now we know that god promised to abraham that what i do for you i will also do for your seed i will do it for your children i will give them the promises i gave to you those promises will also be theirs the covenant that i make with you that same covenant will also be theirs there will be the inheritors of whatever promises whatever blessings whatever covenants that i make with you abraham and so we are abraham's children by faith abraham's faith seed or abraham's royal seed we are kings and priests to god and we are of the spiritual lineage of abraham that is the reason why we have abrahamic faith abrahamic faith what do i mean abraham heard a voice speaking to him telling him come out of your country come and follow me and believe me the one true god and the bible says abraham believed god and came out of his sins came out of his idolatry came out of his background of on culture of which he was his father was a wealthy man down there in that nation but he came out of all of that praise god to hear the voice of god to believe the word of god and to follow the promise of god for his day and for his time and so he met melchizedek and the promises god made to abraham were also made to abraham's seed that would come down through the ages i believe we are now in the last days i believe the great holy spirit is here with us and among us and working and moving with a mighty hand bringing his children out of all of satan's prison houses where they were kept bound up tied up tangled up god has brought them out and is bringing them out with a mighty hand to the glory of his name just as he did to the children of israel brought them out of egypt just as it did to the children of israel that were under nebuchadnezzar he brought them out of babylon by a mighty hand and now he brings us out of worldliness he brings us out of filth and the mess of the world the stench of the world and the degradation of denomination he brings us out of all of that i i i just call denominations demon nations demon nations for it seems as if the devil works in that amongst them in the mighty way i'm not speaking about the individual people in those denominations but organizations are of the devil like that religious organizations they're not of god god never founded one of them you'll never find that anywhere from the book of acts right through to revelation never founded them god's people are an organism a living body of christ hallelujah walking in the light of god's word and obedience to the word of god hallelujah so now since abraham met melchizedek in type it is also what jesus is referring to listen to the parallel as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the coming of the son of man i will not go into all of this right now but just enough to point to you that he is speaking that the children the royal seed of abraham the faint seed of abraham will also have a meeting or will have to meet melchizedek just like abraham met him back there in that day you are going to know it that the children of abraham the royal seat of abraham are supposed to meet melchizedek again by the promise of god he gives us the time he gives us the conditions of the time and he tells us what people will be doing now if you just look around you and you know it's happening eating drinking partying uh enjoying themselves and all that going on marrying giving in marriage taking on wives and wives women taking on several men and all that sort of thing it's going on right now and jesus said when you see these things then will the son of man be revealed i believe he is being revealed right now i believe the word of god is making itself known to you right now now you'll say to me well brother simon i've heard about melchizedek but who is this melchizedek now this melchizedek in short i told you and will tell you again as we know god is the eternal spirit living alone before the foundation of the world before he created anything god dwelt alone and there this the great almighty spirit dwelling alone later on he wanted to have children around him he wanted to be a healer a savior a father a deliverer he wanted to be a friend he wanted to be all in all and so this great mighty god realizing that he had a plan in his mind a a plan of redemption a great marvelous plan genesis 3 18 tells you that in there the seed of the woman will bruise the serpent's head god knew man would fall into sin and that man will need a savior and since there was no one else the bible said he swore by himself but there was no one else no bishop no pope no prince no king no commoner no none there was no one else that could save the world save the people his children but he himself and so he decided that he would come down oh what condition bringing us redemption and so god began to form himself from spirit to come down into flesh well part of the way of that transformation in greek words or in theological words which you don't need i'm using it so you can understand god made himself into a theophoney a teopany which is a a spirit body a word body this word formed it into a body that had the shape of a man who was called melchizedek king of peace king of righteousness glory to god hallelujah and so melchizedek us paul will tell you later i believe in the book of hebrews that melchizedek was really christ he wasn't jesus christ as yet but it was christ amen without mother without father without beginning without ending first and the last oh glory to god it was jesus christ god bringing himself down to redeem his own but now he is in this body representing himself in a theophanic body to the people of the world they couldn't understand him they couldn't explain him they could not interpret who he was where he come from where he was going yet they knew he was a king and he was he had no trace ability that they could not trace him they just had to trust him and had confidence in him later on that theophonic word body began to again change itself i'll use another word god began to end morphe himself e-n-m-o-r-p-h-e greek term changing himself he begins to end morphe forming himself into the shape of what we know as jesus christ for he was already christ there in melchizedek but now he was going to have a physical human body the body will be named jesus and melchizedek christ would be living in that body who is the smell cassidy the same god that was there in the eternities be come down to dwell in human flesh to walk amongst his creation that he had created in your bible john chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god did you hear what the bible says the word was god and furthermore it says and the word became flesh so in between melchizedek and jesus christ their merchandise was being on morphe becoming flesh and the word became flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah take god he's god in the father he's god in the son he's god in the holy ghost he's the god the only one i know god is god and god don't ever change i know god he's god and jesus is his name he's god when the lightning flashing he's god when the thunder rules he's god in the amen corner he's goddamn in my soul i know god he's god and god don't ever change i know god he's god and jesus is his name hallelujah oh praise god forevermore and so god the word form became flesh the word became flesh and dwelt among us oh praise his wonderful name you know the rest of the story and the angel gabriel came to a a virgin and said you shall bear a son and his name shall be called jesus every child born every person born has to be given an earthly name they must receive a earthly name by which they will be recognized and called by so when he came into flesh they had to give him an earthly name and that name was jesus how significant do you know the meaning of the name jesus the name jesus is saying he is jehovah has now become our savior jesus means jehovah our savior the same jehovah of the old testament that lived in eternity came down and morphed himself into human flesh that he might become our savior to deliver us from the bondage of sin hell the grave and from hell glory to god hallelujah and so friends here was god being raised in a human body but yet being god the bible said he humbled himself he took more reputation as you find the book of philippians and there it is he he ran around like a like a child moved around like an ordinary human but he was still god and so one day joseph and mary they went up to the great feast and there the bible says he got they drifted away from him god help you don't you drift away from the word of god don't lose the word of god don't let the attractions and the things of this life and of this world draw you away from the things of god but hold to god's unchanging hand prophet not this world's vain riches that so rapidly decay oh praise god but whole to god's unchanging hand now one forevermore and so when they realize that they lost him they started to search around trying to find him friends if somewhere in your life you fell away backslid lost the word lost your position it oh my come back to the word of god come back to this word and know him in the power of his resurrection and in the fellowship of his suffering all glory to god and now friends just search for him and when they found him mary rushed to him and turned and said your father and i search for you it was god in the body of a 12 year old boy and she knew it for then he turned and he looked into her eyes and said woman woman do you know to whom you're speaking and she was quiet the bible is not written not another word came out of her the bible said she just took him and went back on their journey wherever they had to go and it was never mentioned again in the bible but right there god spoke out of that little boy's body that child's body amen and brought her to her senses to recognize who it was that dwelt in that flesh body the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen well i'm saying to say this many say that mary was the mother of jesus christ obviously you know that's unscriptural that's error that is completely wrong for he was before her he said before abraham was i am and there is mary decoy the mother of god she could not be the mother of god god has no beginning no ending god eternal amen what's the devil trying to do with that kind of a doctrine trying to tell you that she was eternal before he was eternal there's only one eternal and that one eternal is god and all of his children it's still god but a part of him that's now being revealed and manifested upon the face of the earth mary is supposed to be the mother of jesus christ but that's completely wrong that's the reason why he called her woman he didn't call her he didn't say mother no when she turned him and said your father and i of course she already because she also rejected the supernatural birth by saying that she was now claiming like like joseph was his father and of course she was rebuked by the holy spirit speaking through the child amen woman oh my see he didn't say oh mother no no no she was not his mother she was not the mother of god not the mother of jesus christ she was look he did not come from mary he was just passing through mary praise the lord i hope you can understand and see that i said he did not originate from or come from mary but he only used her as a vessel to pass true mary to make himself manifested in the world below that we know of amen jesus christ was really melchizedek made flesh hallelujah he was the father he was the everlasting father he was the prince of peace he was the three in one if you want to call him that hallelujah he is all in all father son and holy ghost i am the alpha omega beginning in the end the first and the last amen wonderful counsel almighty god oh praise his name the governor he is the lily of the valley the bright and morning star shining light glory to god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen he had no earthly father for he was the father amen praise god one great poet wrote this poem i am that spoke to moses in a burning bush of fire i am the god of abraham the bright and morning star i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i am the whole creation and jesus is my name oh who do you say that i am and whence do you say that i came do you know my father or can you tell his name oh hallelujah praise god forevermore my friends how beautiful the revelation of the godhead how beautiful the revelation to know that god said to israel hear o israel the lord thy god is one lord amen and god has never changed his mind about his word the word of god never changes and he himself said i am one lord one god jesus is brought father son and holy ghost for he jesus is what lord and christ thank god forevermore hallelujah amen praise the lord my friends how beautiful this is when god reveals this to you and you recognize the oneness of god and that he lives in me he lives in you praise god forevermore amen no wonder he said i come in my father's name i've said this last week my father's name is simon and i come in my father's name therefore i'm also with the last name simon amen and jesus said he come in his father's name praise god so what is his father's name christ jesus christ he is the one the mighty god and the everlasting father hallelujah amen you see the word father means one who begets one that can get a son a daughter a child and so he came from the great father's spirit created a body for himself and then came and lived in the body now because this great spirit of god created the body the body was called the son not another person but a body for their father's spirit to come in to dwell in god was in christ the father dwelt in the sun god living working and moving in his people amen hallelujah thank god that he is the mighty god the everlasting father thank the lord back then jesus being created and the father dwelling in him but thank god we're living in the day where we can say i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man i've been born again how happy i am why i am the new creation of this hour you are of the new creation of this hour spiritually god has changed you god has transformed your life and now he lives in you and you are the new creation of god the continuation of that creation back there amen no that is why we talk about christian do you want to be a real christian do you want to know that it is really not christianity it's not you trying to live like live jesus life or live god's life no it's god come down and dwell in you and he begins to live out of you and through you his own life helping you empowering you to overcome the world of flesh the devil your sins your habits all the everything that tried to control you the great king of glory the governor has come to overcome satan and all his works and to identify you before the world that you are one of his lambs one of his children one of his beloved ones one of his elect that you are one of his own and he says all those are in the palm of my hand and i will not lose not one of them hallelujah praise god he will not lose not one of us let's put our trust in our faith in him and live for him give him the glory the honor and the praise amen praise god hallelujah my friends let me make a statement here the true daughter of god and sons of god are not sinners saved by grace let me repeat that that will sound kind of controversial the true sons and daughters of god are not sinners saved by grace for we are children of the most high and you were in him and you are part of him and you are a continuation of him here on the face of the earth now this flesh in which you were born this thing here might have done all kinds of stuff but that man as paul calls him the hidden man of the heart that man never did anything wrong to begin with that's jo first john for the seed of god cannot commit sin it cannot do it for it is god himself in the individual working out there if they make us humans we'll look and see them do this or maybe they made that it's this outer man here doing all kinds of tricks upon them but you hold on to god's hand and god will deliver you in every possible way amen thank god we are the very attributes or the thoughts the attributes of god himself a man and his thoughts are one man and his attributes are one god and his children are one jesus said i and my father are one and we can say that here today i and my father are one say it i and my father are one say it again i and my father are one one more time i and my father are one praise be to god almighty that god so merciful loving and kind forgive us of our sins and come to dwell within our hearts and to give us a new life a new start a new beginning and to living us walk in us and to have his will and plan made known to us amen oh praise god the mystery of god from eternity back to eternity jesus said i come from god and i'm going to back to god what is he saying i come from being god up there i come down here i'm doing this work of redemption and when it's over i'm going back to being god in the heavens glory to god hallelujah amen in the other sense we come from the very mind and thoughts of god from before the foundations of the world this world is not our home we are just a passing through and our treasures are lit up oh way beyond the blue oh praise god we come from god we're passing through the this world of time and sin and and suffering and we're going back to god from once we came oh blessed be his holy name that's why he ha we have the rapture time the rapture is here to take god's children out and take them back where they really came from to give glory and honor to his blessed and wonderful name praise god amen amen hallelujah aren't you happy today that you can be in god's house along with the other thoughts of god the other children of god the other people of god holy holy hearts and holding hands and raising up holy hands without rats and without doubting giving praise and honor and glory to his wonderful and marvelous name my friend this subject is so vast and so deep we will continue speaking this next week to get a little more into melchizedek not to give you more than you are able to bear but to just to give you enough that you can go into your bible during the coming weeks and begin to read for any true believer reads their bible and prays every day so let us pray one for another let us read the word of god let us look into it and search out these things whether they be true but they are true for they are in the word of god and jesus has made it plain amen hallelujah oh god bless you my friends that you clearly see the revelation of the godhead you'll clearly see the revelation of god's spirit coming into a word form body in melchizedek and then that word form body the word become flesh in jesus christ and in jesus christ was the fullness of all the thoughts of god the fullness of the godhead bodily then he went to the cross died there out of him poured out the blood poured out the water and blood from his side which is a symbol as eve was taken out of adam so were the chur the true bride of christ you and i believing sons we didn't know anything about it just like you did not know when you were in your natural daddy you have no consciousness of that you have no consciousness of it we have no consciousness of when we were in god but the hours come on the power of god when the holy spirit wants to make his children born again manifested sons and daughters to reveal himself and his character his characteristics oh praise god may the holy spirit save you cleanse you wash you straighten you if you're a believer baptized in the name of jesus christ if you're not you need to be baptized as soon as possible my friends then live like a child of god live like a daughter of god live like a son of god and we'll come together again and wednesday night when we will have the teaching on the seven church ages then back next sunday again for another part of this melchizedek the royal seed of abraham
