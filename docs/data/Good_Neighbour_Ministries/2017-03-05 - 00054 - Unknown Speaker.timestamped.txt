[7:12] thank the Lord for that and I know what
[7:14] the feeling is and also the
[7:17] responsibility that comes with it and to
[7:19] realize that there are awesome
[7:22] gift you're an awesome gift that comes
[7:26] from God that you should see your
[7:28] children
[7:30] oh how wonderful and especially the man
[7:34] here when you can see your children's
[7:35] children what a blessing praise God
[7:39] forever more and my uh wife's mom had
[7:43] her 95th birthday this week and she is
[7:46] seeing her children's children children
[7:49] prise God
[7:55] hallelujah of course we know the first
[7:57] responsibility of parents is the love
[8:00] the Lord thy God Amen uh uh you know we
[8:04] dedicate children regardless of whether
[8:06] their parents are Christians or not
[8:10] because we have a chance in the child's
[8:12] life to get them started right and for
[8:15] the influence of the Holy Spirit to be
[8:18] upon their lives whether or not the
[8:20] parents are Christian amen but when the
[8:23] parents are Christian what a blessing a
[8:26] double blessing that is amen that child
[8:30] in every possible way amen yes sir and
[8:34] uh they have their responsibilities
[8:37] through that to be examples for this
[8:41] child or for any child of any parent
[8:44] that they will have you need to be a
[8:48] responsibility need to have the
[8:50] responsibility you need to have the
[8:51] example and not only on Sunday
[8:55] morning but we have too many Sunday
[8:57] morning Christians
[8:59] but they don't live the life for the
[9:02] rest of the week right but God said when
[9:04] you're sitting down when you're when
[9:06] you're rising up even when you on your
[9:08] bed your thought should be on the Lord
[9:10] you should be talking about the Lord
[9:11] talk to the child about the Lord I know
[9:14] my mother with older uh you know the
[9:17] smaller children in our arms you know
[9:19] praise God and she'll be singing hyms or
[9:22] she'll be singing some song something
[9:24] that will make them relax and go to
[9:26] sleep and feel comfortable with in their
[9:29] mother's arms praise God hallelujah now
[9:34] our
[9:35] responsibilities is not just to be only
[9:37] examples but
[9:40] trainers we need to train them not to be
[9:44] the kind of prayers that would just
[9:46] loose them like wild animals and let
[9:49] them run all over the place or do
[9:51] whatever they wish to do but in the
[9:54] first stage you have to have a firm grip
[9:57] because you're shaping level you're
[10:00] shaping the character you you're
[10:02] bringing them to understand discipline
[10:05] to understand order and these kinds of
[10:09] things and when they have understood
[10:11] that then you take your hands off slowly
[10:14] not just take it off but slowly you
[10:16] start to take it off and allow God to
[10:19] move in their lives and then you'll see
[10:21] the effects of the word SE that you were
[10:24] you had planted within their hearts and
[10:27] within their lives so this passage is
[10:30] telling us train them when we are
[10:33] sitting down okay you have a visual
[10:36] already the mother or the father sitting
[10:39] down and the child is on their knee or
[10:41] the child is in their arm and they and
[10:44] they're they're talking about the Lord
[10:48] maybe maybe to the child or even when
[10:51] they're not talking to the child we do
[10:53] believe it the child is still listening
[10:55] amen you say oh they can't understand
[10:57] that's what you think right they can't
[11:00] express themselves but the spirit inside
[11:02] is older than that body right and then
[11:06] what happens is that they're holding the
[11:08] child and if the mother and the father
[11:10] is smoking even though the child is a
[11:12] baby they even influencing the child if
[11:15] they're cursing it's going in the
[11:17] subconscious of that child if they
[11:19] arguing fighting fting threat it's going
[11:22] into the subconscious of that child so
[11:25] even when you're sitting down and just
[11:28] the m the dad is talking back and forth
[11:31] there's still an influence going forth
[11:34] praise God hallelujah so we to train
[11:37] them even when we are sitting
[11:39] down and when we are walking as soon as
[11:44] you know we're walking with them in our
[11:45] arms and go for a walk we're talking
[11:47] they're still there with you or later on
[11:50] when they can toddle along you hold them
[11:53] and what do you do any parent knows this
[11:55] any Pastor Any teacher you slow down
[11:58] right to the level of how you
[12:00] congregation can walk because they can't
[12:03] walk faster they you know they're not
[12:05] seeing as far as you so you got to slow
[12:08] down praise God and it's the same thing
[12:11] you you slow down and you hold your
[12:13] hands so you're training them to walk
[12:16] but you know what happens after you
[12:18] train them to walk after whether they
[12:21] can walk properly the next thing you
[12:22] know they want to run is that right and
[12:25] you say no no no don't run too far slow
[12:28] down you know because they still have to
[12:30] keep an eye on you praise the Lord so
[12:33] God says train them when you lying down
[12:37] you know praise God it's nice that we
[12:39] have all these Nursery things and we put
[12:42] them in their own little thing and we
[12:43] teaching them to be in dependent from
[12:45] the day they born put them inside you
[12:47] know but the old days which I think is
[12:50] still real and even now if we have that
[12:53] nothing is wrong with having that but
[12:54] sometimes you need to have your child
[12:56] right behind you right beside you when
[12:59] you're taking a little dose amen praise
[13:03] God oh some of you scared I'm going to
[13:05] roll over and kill the child no you w
[13:08] roll over and kill the child I'll tell
[13:09] you one thing a real mother even though
[13:13] if her child is sleeping beside her
[13:14] she's sleeping but she ain't sleeping
[13:17] she's always conscious that
[13:20] child what's wrong but right away she is
[13:24] right there because that's how God built
[13:27] you sisters in that kind wait the man he
[13:30] got out the jail gone to gone to sleep
[13:33] to the world and something happened wait
[13:36] you didn't know how come I was I'm fast
[13:39] asleep right because man are made look
[13:42] different but God has built you sisters
[13:46] in a wonderful way that any sound from
[13:49] that child and they're right away right
[13:51] away like that so praise God so train
[13:54] them even when you're laying down train
[13:57] them with the word of God God within
[13:59] your hand in other words training is a
[14:02] conscious
[14:04] effort you don't just say oh they're
[14:06] going to learn and you just leave them
[14:07] no you got to train them and to train
[14:10] them it'll take you doing your part
[14:13] it'll take the church the Sunday School
[14:15] doing its part it'll
[14:17] take the school doing their part how
[14:20] much they can do I don't know but the
[14:22] fact is it will take uh training to
[14:25] train the child and train them with the
[14:28] word of God
[14:29] that you might want to have pictures on
[14:32] your wall you know you might want to
[14:35] have a Christian symbols around so that
[14:38] when they come conscious say Mommy what
[14:40] is that you say oh that that's Jesus
[14:43] what picture is that that's Jesus what's
[14:46] that oh that's a cross what do you mean
[14:48] cross and then there you go you have to
[14:50] start to you're training that right so
[14:54] this is important that we do this praise
[14:57] the Lord hallelujah amen oh praise God
[15:01] so we know that there are many many
[15:03] tools of course that we can use to train
[15:05] the child and we need uh to uh plan that
[15:09] and work with that and train them in the
[15:12] Lord praise God because without the plan
[15:14] uh you're doomed to fail uh I think I
[15:17] had an old principle that says if you
[15:19] fail to prepare then prepare to fail so
[15:23] you've got to prepare to do that praise
[15:25] the Lord hallelujah now that's our to
[15:29] train them and it's our right
[15:30] responsibility to to keep the Lord
[15:33] before our children's face and eyes you
[15:36] know when a baby is born what's the
[15:38] first thing the mothers do they hand up
[15:40] something with
[15:42] little uh eye catching colored stuff to
[15:45] catch their eyes and and to catch their
[15:48] attention well that is actually what the
[15:50] word is telling you to do that to keep
[15:52] the word in front of their eyes at all
[15:55] times and and and let them be seen it uh
[15:58] let them be hearing it and then it goes
[16:01] down into their soul praise the Lord
[16:04] amen CU a day doesn't go by when we
[16:07] don't learn things from God that we can
[16:10] pass on praise God hallelujah do it now
[16:14] and save yourself from the
[16:16] sorrow later is that right do it now and
[16:21] save yourself from the problems and the
[16:23] sorrow later on Hallelujah and when they
[16:26] get old enough do all your best that you
[16:29] can to point them to the Lord listen to
[16:32] some questions that you might want to
[16:34] think
[16:35] about do you love the Lord with all your
[16:38] heart and your soul and your
[16:41] might do you have the desire to train
[16:44] your child to love the
[16:46] Lord do you have yet a plan to train
[16:50] them do you set a good example for your
[16:54] child to
[16:56] follow do you have any knowledge of the
[16:58] doctrines of the
[17:00] Bible the disciplines of the scripture
[17:04] the books of the
[17:06] Bible do you have a time when you pray
[17:10] so that even your child may see you
[17:12] praying so that they understand the
[17:15] importance of
[17:18] prayer and let me ask will this church

[24:17] that you believe overall is suited to
[24:21] your Constitution
[24:24] amen and um when you are in a certain
[24:28] home like I said that home has rules now
[24:32] if the home doesn't have rules what kind
[24:34] of a home is
[24:35] that where the mother leads the child to
[24:39] run up the front door with a dirty nappy
[24:42] running down the
[24:44] street uh you know this it literally
[24:47] happens so let me let me feel free to
[24:49] talk to you praise the Lord run out in
[24:52] the yard and play with the dog and all
[24:55] money up and everything else like that
[24:58] and uh you know the all leave the
[25:01] children to jump up on the on the uh the
[25:04] not just the bed CU I used to do that as
[25:07] a boy think I can fly like Superman but
[25:09] I'm talking about about loose the
[25:12] children leave them wild and they jump
[25:14] on the Chester Field or on the your
[25:17] chairs and they're jumping up and
[25:19] they're swinging from the chandelier
[25:21] from the light and you know and jumping
[25:24] off of a table with their father
[25:26] umbrella trying to fly something and uh
[25:29] smashing and breaking things and pushing
[25:32] things aside and oh they're only
[25:37] children is that right oh they're only
[25:40] children let them have their freedom
[25:43] while they young later on you know when
[25:45] they can understand then we going to
[25:48] start to no you have to start right now
[25:51] when they young right that's it and then
[25:56] you have your natural house and and
[25:58] you're in your home and your children
[26:00] come on from school and they're chewing
[26:02] gum and they throw the ground gum on
[26:05] your carpet and they grind the car the
[26:09] come into the carpets and you you're
[26:11] saying oh Johnny don't do that
[26:21] and oh it's sometimes you can almost see
[26:25] a devilish ble coming out to the eyes of
[26:29] some of these children not the child but
[26:32] the devil just comes on them and does
[26:35] some qu things and you don't understand
[26:38] what is actually going on they grind in
[26:40] the thing there or you go to get them
[26:42] some juice they knock it out on your
[26:44] hand knock it up the ground this you
[26:48] know the the coloration from it just
[26:50] stain up your your tablecloths T up your
[26:53] carpet maybe it fly in the air and hit
[26:55] the drapes or something and you still
[26:58] tolerating that kind of behavior and and
[27:00] running a house like that and everybody
[27:03] in the house eat paper you know eat the
[27:05] candy drop the the paper on the ground
[27:08] or something like that or if they were
[27:11] uh reading a book they leave the book
[27:13] right there and you know nobody going to
[27:15] move it bre it there they drink juice
[27:18] drop the cup go back and have you know
[27:22] go over there have a glass of milk drop
[27:24] the cup leave it there and then the Cup
[27:26] start to build up and you know C here
[27:29] and played over there and come there I
[27:33] don't want to ask if you know what I'm
[27:34] talking about for anybody to get
[27:36] themselves
[27:37] away but uh these kinds of things are
[27:41] happening and it happen so
[27:44] bad that
[27:47] um I went to a certain home I don't
[27:50] remember the
[27:51] church but I went to a certain many
[27:54] years ago around 25 years ago and when
[27:58] the door was open I was hit with the
[28:02] with a blast of the smell of cat pieces
[28:07] mixed in with whatever else pieces I
[28:09] don't know it's almost like you want to
[28:12] pass
[28:14] out and the person is living comfortable
[28:17] in that
[28:18] home they are climatized and they just
[28:22] so much to the smell and to the
[28:26] disorder that they don't even know that
[28:29] it's disorder and that it's a mess and
[28:33] everything else they're so comfortable
[28:35] and say oh brother Simon come in what
[28:38] have you like that and me said I don't
[28:41] even want to open my mouth for the
[28:44] inner to get in my
[28:48] lungs I know it sounds funny but this
[28:51] really really happened and to put insult
[28:54] to injury say come in come in come have
[28:56] a cup of tea
[28:57] [Music]
[29:01] see I I I haven't even touched the cup
[29:05] or touch anything I don't want to touch
[29:07] the the door to open the door push it or
[29:11] anything like that you know and I feel
[29:14] nauseous and I haven't drank one spot of
[29:17] tea or anything yet you might think I'm
[29:20] exaggerating but literally I was under
[29:22] that condition and had to really uh be
[29:25] quick of mind and Nimble of to be able
[29:28] to get myself out of a situation there
[29:31] because there's no way I was going to
[29:33] drink a a tea
[29:37] there or touch anything for that matter
[29:41] but anyway the Lord brought me out of
[29:43] that situation but what I'm saying
[29:46] there's a lot of people that live like
[29:48] that people believe it they live like
[29:51] that we carry all like that um I'm not
[29:55] talking about somebody being poor and
[29:57] they have um just uh cheap clothing or
[30:02] regular clothing or used furniture or or
[30:05] whatever or you go to a home where you
[30:08] know there's kids and they leave mag I'm
[30:10] not talking about the normal
[30:13] everyday house mess you understand what
[30:16] I'm talking about that's a normal thing
[30:18] because you're using the house I still I
[30:21] don't believe in these picture houses
[30:23] too much where every hair is in place
[30:28] everything is like a picture book it's
[30:32] nice when you have it that way but
[30:34] during the years when you're having
[30:36] children they do make a mess when
[30:40] they're gone then you can set them to
[30:42] place like that and that's why one of my
[30:44] grandchildren they said to me when they
[30:46] were trying to run in the um room there
[30:51] the room where we
[30:53] entertain and I said oh come out of
[30:55] there why you running around like a okay
[30:57] Grandad we're going to come up your
[31:03] Museum watch this K
[31:07] [Music]
[31:10] today it's so sharp it's
[31:13] on
[31:15] that you know you left with your mouth
[31:18] open and your say oh my goodness what
[31:21] what you answer that
[31:24] child so so that that that's it so I'm
[31:28] not going to either
[31:30] extreme but I'm saying there's a general
[31:33] thing but I'm talking about when the
[31:36] house is really a awful mess and some
[31:40] people live in the atmosphere until they
[31:43] become climatized or normalized to that
[31:46] atmosphere
[31:48] [Music]
[31:49] well God May save your
[31:52] soul but if you never learn that you
[31:54] have to brush your teeth
[31:57] saving your soul it don't have too much
[32:00] with you brushing your teeth when you
[32:02] going to work or coming to church so
[32:04] what kind of preaching is this because
[32:06] it's
[32:07] practical it's right where you live it's
[32:10] right where the rubber hits the road
[32:12] we're not just telling you all come to
[32:14] Jesus we all going to heaven before you
[32:17] get to heaven you got to live right here
[32:19] is that right you got to live right
[32:21] there before you get to heaven so here
[32:23] we go now are you listening to this or
[32:25] you want this to ever as quickly as
[32:28] possible I'll make the pain you know as
[32:33] quickly as possible but anyway the fact
[32:36] is I'm saying that people get saved but
[32:40] after they're saved what happens is that
[32:42] your habits don't change
[32:45] overnight your natural habits it just
[32:48] doesn't change overnight you have got to
[32:50] allow the Holy Spirit to work on your
[32:53] life and to begin to change you you from
[32:57] the inside out through God's power to
[33:02] transform and therefore it happens that
[33:05] some not sometimes the church then could
[33:08] be a
[33:10] meure just a mingling of a
[33:15] group of a disparate group of people
[33:18] different kinds of
[33:20] people uh with different habits and
[33:24] different
[33:25] cultures and if it's just a cultural
[33:29] thing that's one
[33:31] thing but cleanliness order that has
[33:35] nothing to do with just culture that
[33:38] goes across the board for every race
[33:42] Nation nationality and
[33:45] religion maybe accept um rest
[33:50] far right who don't wash their hair at
[33:53] all once they and leave it to grow uh as
[33:57] long as it goes but I'm just saying to
[33:59] you that um it cuts across the lines and
[34:02] this is just practical stuff so
[34:06] then when people get born again saved or
[34:09] come to the message they come in the
[34:10] house of God we all show praise the Lord
[34:12] hallelujah glory to God everything else
[34:15] like that that's
[34:16] wonderful but then the next thing you
[34:19] know because of B habits at all they
[34:23] start ring it in the
[34:25] church
[34:29] and then it
[34:31] starts making the
[34:33] church if the church like our church was
[34:36] built brand new and everything plac in
[34:39] it brand new they start acting in the
[34:44] church just the way they acted at
[34:48] home they start um behaving with their
[34:51] children and loose
[34:54] them and leave them alone
[34:57] to stick their hand here go over there
[34:59] run there do this do that and and then
[35:03] have the
[35:04] go to tell the pastor nobody speaks tell
[35:08] my child anything this is my child and
[35:11] I'm the only one to be able to tell them
[35:14] anything well you make a big
[35:16] mistake cuz I was reading where brother
[35:19] brand says he said one place he says
[35:21] brother Neville is placed there as a
[35:24] pastor and but as a pastor
[35:27] he said he's kind of different he has a
[35:30] nice patient and a very gentle nature
[35:36] and so much he says that as a pastor he
[35:39] hesitates to tell somebody that's
[35:42] misbehaving sit down or go over there or
[35:47] move here he said but I'm
[35:51] different I'm not like her never God
[35:55] built me with the strength to be able to
[35:56] say sit
[35:58] up or do this or do that stop doing this
[36:03] right now amen just the way God built
[36:06] men right but the fact is some people
[36:10] don't even want to be
[36:12] told Amen brother Simon why don't you
[36:16] just preach the
[36:18] revelations build us up in the
[36:21] revelation of the message and the
[36:23] prophet so we can know the word yeah but
[36:25] then you're not going to know how
[36:28] and the Holy Spirit has got to take
[36:31] these things out of us or else it's
[36:33] going to be sitting there forever until
[36:37] you leave here it won't hinder your
[36:41] salvation it will hinder your
[36:44] salvation but it will hinder your
[36:48] associations your
[36:50] relationships uh right here on the
[36:53] earth amen if you don't change the most
[36:56] natural things within your life that may
[36:59] be hindering you amen and when it
[37:02] hinders you and you come in the church
[37:04] and you bring all that baggage along
[37:07] with you then it starts to be baggage in
[37:09] the church right we here the preacher
[37:12] has to
[37:13] preach this kind of a
[37:16] message listen to the prophet of God he
[37:20] said that God has given us a wonderful
[37:22] beautiful building to Worship in can you
[37:24] say amen amen
[37:27] and it's our duty to make the inside
[37:29] right by the grace of God uh that it
[37:32] would be a beautiful building that we
[37:35] come
[37:36] to and that everyone most of all will
[37:39] see the beautiful
[37:42] characteristics of Jesus Christ in every
[37:46] person that's in here so the building
[37:50] can be beautiful we can have all the
[37:52] stained glass windows beautiful mural
[37:54] things on the wall and let's go there's
[37:56] nothing wrong with that some Churches
[37:59] just like the church to be completely
[38:00] plain other ones love to have all kinds
[38:03] of things there not nothing wrong with
[38:04] it it's just difference of how uh people
[38:08] decorate their home so to speak right
[38:10] but uh because that's not what's so
[38:12] interesed in God it's the beauty of
[38:15] Holiness of the character of the people
[38:18] that are in that
[38:20] building but the beauty of the building
[38:23] God uses that naturally as an attraction
[38:26] to to uh to Natural man who loves to be
[38:30] in that kind of a surroundings so God
[38:32] created that atmosphere naturally for
[38:35] them look he says we ought to be a this
[38:39] ought to be a consecrated place for the
[38:42] Lord if you agree say
[38:44] amen and the people that worship here
[38:46] ought to be a consecrated people to the
[38:50] Lord no matter how beautiful your church
[38:53] structure is and we that certainly will
[38:57] be appreciated but the real beauty of
[39:00] the church is the character of its
[39:04] people I trust that we will always keep
[39:08] this as a house of God a house of great
[39:14] Beauties amen praise the Lord so I he
[39:17] said I want to see this place correctly
[39:21] in order for God to Worship in with his
[39:27] people God is going to wash it in hair
[39:30] with his people like he used to
[39:31] fellowship with Adam and
[39:33] Eve that he can come down and have
[39:35] fellowship with us praise the Lord see
[39:39] and that we can only do that worship
[39:42] with him not by just having a pretty
[39:44] building but a consecrated life is the
[39:48] way that we can do that I agree
[39:51] completely with the prophet of God now I
[39:54] think we ought to have this this now we
[39:57] should keep it that way and one of the
[40:00] first things he said we should do listen
[40:03] Church listen deacons listen
[40:05] trustees we should never buy or
[40:09] sell anything in the
[40:13] sanctuary in the building praise the
[40:15] Lord now what he saying the building you
[40:18] know if you be theab they original if
[40:22] they hav changed it it was just before
[40:25] walls right the back
[40:27] wall and that's it and I remember coming
[40:31] in a side door from the back and sitting
[40:33] in the chair where brother BR sits
[40:35] behind that cross that he has up there
[40:38] cuz you know I came in with brother per
[40:41] GRE so sat us up there but that was it
[40:43] four walls they didn't have anything
[40:45] else there was no outside so he's
[40:48] talking when he said you should never
[40:50] he's talking about the sanctuary like we
[40:52] have this area dedicated set apart where
[40:56] we wash it right praise the Lord not
[40:59] talking about if you have a basement or
[41:02] if you have somewhere else that area
[41:04] overall it would be the best um the best
[41:09] action not to sell anything at all
[41:13] especially on
[41:16] [Music]
[41:18] Sunday
[41:20] amen so here he says we should never do
[41:25] any business
[41:27] in the auditorium here it should never
[41:31] be done in here right he stressing in
[41:35] the sanctuary in the Tabernacle it
[41:37] should not be done in here praise the
[41:39] Lord nobody should be buying or selling
[41:42] anything within this area that we
[41:44] separate and dedicate for the glory of
[41:48] God does everybody agree with that
[41:50] praise the name of the Lord uh does does
[41:53] everybody agree that we can sell from
[41:55] the pulpit and you know you know s
[41:58] between these four walls do you think
[42:00] that that's something that's all right
[42:02] after I've just told you that no we
[42:04] don't want to do that now we're bringing
[42:06] things back the way the prophet had it
[42:08] and the way God taught him and the way
[42:10] he taught us is that right praise the
[42:12] Lord and it's going to call from some
[42:15] strict adherence to the word not being
[42:18] too legalistic but to strict adherence
[42:22] to the
[42:23] word now we should not for
[42:27] ministers to come in stand here and sell
[42:31] books and everything
[42:33] else no matter what it
[42:36] is there is other places for them to do
[42:41] that amen amen not from the pulit here
[42:43] not within this area where we worshiping
[42:46] praise the Lord but maybe we permit them
[42:50] they can do that in the foer or they can
[42:51] do that in the basement where we where
[42:54] we we're going to finish up the library
[42:56] there where will be able to um materials
[42:59] can be displayed praise the Lord but not
[43:03] in the house of the Lord no matter what
[43:06] it is it should be a place of worship
[43:11] only holy consecrated for that purpose
[43:15] right amen he has given us this nice
[43:19] place let us dedicate to him and let us
[43:23] also dedicate ourselves to him by doing
[43:27] this praise the Lord Hallelujah by
[43:29] obeying the word we dedicate ourselves
[43:31] to him obeying him the word praise God
[43:35] remember not only selling a books but
[43:40] it's also pay
[43:42] attention here in the it's not a place
[43:46] for you to visit with one
[43:50] another it's a place for us to worship
[43:55] God
[43:57] now he's talking about our approach to
[44:00] washer over our front door as we come in
[44:04] we have the text of our
[44:06] scripture but the Lord is in his holy
[44:10] Temple let all the Earth keep
[44:14] silence before him
[44:19] listen it's not a place to visit for you
[44:22] to visit it's a place of worship we sh
[44:26] should never even
[44:27] murm one word inside of here when we
[44:32] come in outside of worship to the
[44:37] Lord to one another we should not murm
[44:41] to one another unless it is
[44:45] absolutely necessary right praise the
[44:50] lord we should never come in and rally
[44:54] around
[44:57] rally doesn't mean just run around but
[44:59] standing in groups talking inside of the
[45:02] sanctuary
[45:03] here is this coming through
[45:05] [Music]
[45:08] clear we should never run through the
[45:13] building ourselves or let our children
[45:16] go run through this building can I hear
[45:19] AOW
[45:21] amen praise God hallelujah amen we
[45:27] constructed this so that we could all
[45:30] take care of it can you say amen amen
[45:33] praise it's not the pastor constructed

[45:38] constructed so they're responsible for
[45:40] it you also you are just as
[45:43] responsible praise God you put your
[45:47] heart on ties and your offerings into
[45:51] the house of
[45:52] God and then you're going to not want to
[45:56] go messing it up tearing it up uh you

[47:15] the cop is standing on the
[47:18] corner right and then they're going to
