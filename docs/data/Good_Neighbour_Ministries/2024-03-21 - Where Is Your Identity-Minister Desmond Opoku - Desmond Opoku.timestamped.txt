[19:50] right they fear for their
[19:54] life they fear for the the living at
[19:58] this moment of time they fear for living
[20:01] in their own houses they fear for
[20:05] driving
[20:06] outside you know now how Satan has come
[20:10] so much
[20:12] down and when people even
[20:16] driving they can stop
[20:19] them and demand their car from their

[21:47] on we are about to go
[21:50] home where is your identity are you
[21:54] identified with Christ amen or who are

[23:44] Christians and people has called them
[23:46] themselves
[23:47] prophets
[23:49] prophetes everywhere and meanwhile the
[23:52] crown cannot

[1:01:40] here paragraph
[1:01:44] 118 I say I said the same thing tonight
[1:01:48] the old ter is gone but the word the
[1:01:53] word is still the T that identifies the
[1:01:57] characteristic of God the promise of the
[1:02:01] hour that we are
[1:02:04] living there is God's characters
[1:02:07] characteristic identified by the promise
[1:02:09] of the hour that we are living amen that
[1:02:14] makes God the same as he was in s times
[1:02:18] look in diverse maners he spoke to the
[1:02:22] fathers by the prophet and the law the
[1:02:26] and the law and Prophet were un until
[1:02:30] John since then the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:02:33] noticed but in this last day speaking
[1:02:36] the same
[1:02:38] thing he did then through his son Jesus
[1:02:44] Christ God in s time diverse maners
[1:02:47] spake to the fathers through the
[1:02:49] prophets in this last day doing the same
[1:02:52] thing speaking to the people the fathers
[1:02:55] through his son Christ Jesus he raised
[1:02:58] him up from the dead he lives within us
[1:03:03] identify himself and for telling us
[1:03:06] things that he is a designer of the
[1:03:09] thoughts and intents of the heart Jesus
[1:03:13] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:03:15] forever God in Cal times and divers
[1:03:19] maners spake to the fathers through the
[1:03:21] prophet but in in last days through
[1:03:24] Jesus Christ his son
[1:03:26] the scripture cannot be tempered with it
[1:03:29] is
[1:03:31] exactly as I have said before God don't
[1:03:34] need anybody to interpret his word the
[1:03:37] inter he interpret his own word when he
[1:03:41] say anything it happens that's the
[1:03:44] interpretation see amen he don't need
[1:03:46] anyone to
[1:03:48] say well I believe it means this God
[1:03:53] identifies it by his own
[1:03:58] interpretation Hallelujah
[1:04:01] prise is is if the promise is far is for
[1:04:07] the day we can live in the light of of a
[1:04:11] Luther and can and can and can live in
[1:04:14] the light of Wesley we can't live in the
[1:04:17] light of any those we got to live in the
[1:04:21] light that is Promised for this day amen
[1:04:25] Hallelujah glory to God what if Moses
[1:04:29] would have went down in Egypt and said
[1:04:32] well we are going to build a big Ark we
[1:04:36] are going to float out on the country
[1:04:39] the Nas is going to come up
[1:04:43] they they do they do look back in the
[1:04:49] scroll there is no promise of
[1:04:52] that that's right but you see he
[1:04:56] identified himself
[1:04:58] as as God's Prophet for what he said
[1:05:02] comes to pass then they knew he had the
[1:05:06] word of the
[1:05:08] Lord Pharaoh had Spears but Moses had
[1:05:12] the word you had the word yes sir
[1:05:15] Hallelujah the word is the one that
[1:05:18] ruling this hour
[1:05:22] amen oh Hallelujah so when they got to
[1:05:26] the Sea the spirits all went at went
[1:05:29] under the sea then Moses took Israel
[1:05:32] across the sea on dry
[1:05:34] line because he had the
[1:05:38] word and he was the word of the that
[1:05:41] hour Moses was the word made fresh for
[1:05:45] that hour who is the word that this
[1:05:49] hour we are the word this hour

[1:07:35] it and and he said here
[1:07:38] 25 Jesus said in the 7 17th chapter of
[1:07:42] St Luke as it was in the days of Sodom
