thank you very much we will um today we want to come to the ending of the spoken word it's the Original Seed the series that is what we we were dealing with laughs and this will be the last uh lesson on that and which we will entitle this the last Harvest the last Harvest okay and for scripture let's read revelation 18. I'll be as brief as possible eighteen one and two verses 1 and 2 then we'll go to verses 9. and 10. shall we read and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon has fallen the greatest Fallen it's fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird verses 9 and 10. and the kings of the earth who had committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewild her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning standing up far off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great City Babylon that Mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment come our gracious Heavenly Father we thank thee for this the reading of the word we pray that the great holy spirit will bless us together give us your insight into your word and divine understanding that we may know how to live and how to walk and what to know in this time in which we live we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you all please be seated we know that the age or the ages it's wrapping up very very swiftly and we are seeing the signs everywhere uh that things are coming are quickly to an end I'm talking about for the Gentile dispensation that is quickly coming to its end uh and the transition over to unfocus on Israel God's timepiece so let's keep our eyes now on Israel we now are waiting and watching uh for the rapture moment we are in the process where we are waiting for that last Spark before everything goes up but for tonight we want to talk about the last Harvest now uh we know that each Church age has its Harvest because the messenger for whatever Church age that it is uh calls out the elect for that age and there are there are best Harvest of that particular age but they have to wait for the rest of all the ages to come to their harvests and then we have this last Great Harvest where everything together is caught up in the presence of God that's why the Bible tells us they have to sleep they have to wait a day without us cannot be made perfect is that right uh they can't be made perfect that way so each Edge has its individual Harvest uh and we come to our age on our age has to have its individual Harvest and all those seven harvests the Rapture now will be the Gathering of all those seven harvests into one last Great Harvest that we can call it from the bride's point of view we call that the Rapture is that right because we are caught up out of this entire thing but that will be the this will be the Harvest of all the ages this is what and we are in the middle of what I'm talking about now all of what we're talking about is actually taking place it's happening around us okay now calling the prophet we know that we are now at the end time and I can say Amen he says the seeds are sowed they're already sowed amen praise God how were they sold they were sowed by the prophets Ministry they were sowed by his message and let out in the world I praise God the soul went forth to sow and he saw seeds the message has already gone forward but then we find that as we spoke on before God already had the prepared ground right prepared ground that is not just dirt but this prepared ground dirt like the other dirt but yet it's different because it's ground that he prepared before the foundation of the world now we find out that that this repair ground it's actually the genes that were placed in his children so that when the word or the water of the word comes that it the work comes it would be able to receive that water on that word that dropped on the good ground and the good ground would be an absorbent to receive it all praise God don't get mixed up with how I said all of that but I'm thinking different things while I'm talking but the you know if you have caught this message doesn't matter how jungled I sound you are going to know what I'm really saying right so the seeds have already been sold praise God we thank god well what we are now we hear the talk we're waiting on that last one to come in we don't know where that individual that person or persons are and that's why we keep preaching the word because we don't know where the last one is and so the word uh continue has to go forth so that it can attract the The Thirst or hunger that's in that Gene in that person wherever they are and call them to attention of the word of God okay praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God he says here the seeds are sown and the latter rain is falling hallelujah praise God Amen the latter rain is falling why why why are you he's talking about the lot of rain which we know of course that his ministry was the the latter rain amen and we are receiving both former and latter rain right now by the grace of God the teaching Reign and the Harvest rain we are receiving it all right now praise the name of the Lord we thank God for that now he says the light rain is falling and I'm saying this now but it's falling so it can bring these seeds to fullness that is why that last rain comes even with natural harvest the rain comes to bring the fruits to their fullness if they just get sunlight sunlight sunlight all the time they'll be sweet yeah but they'll be kind of shriveled up and and they not have the body to them that they need they got to have balance of sun and rain and so the rain he said is now falling praise God and that rain is falling the reason for it falling which is what I'm telling you now is to bring both seeds to their fullness because we're talking now not just the seed of God but remember that there come an evil one that he sought seeds too and uh they both fell uh and now the rain is falling and it's falling on the Justin on the unjust and all those seeds are coming up maturing and coming to their fullness at this time uh to so that they can be gathered up together praise God now one seed one group of seeds will be gathered together into a great Federation of churches it'll be gathered into a great Federation of churches and the other group which I believe we are a part of that group uh is being gathered into into a a what we would call the bride she's being gathered together uh as the bride Hallelujah she of course is the Original Seed praise the Lord because the sower sown he says and then an enemy came but the Original Seed is what I'm talking about there all right that Original Seed of the Living God that they the first group is trying to go to put her out of operations absolutely listen to The Prophet here he says they will first bring themselves into a Federation of churches and then this great this kind of church like this is talking about the Tabernacle where he was speaking he says will be put out of operations see my but at that time Jesus will appear and he will then begin to show which is the bride and which is not the bride I believe he's talking about the quick short work right there and the bride being put on display for a short while for a short period of time she'll be put on display and uh and the world will have an opportunity at least to know what and who is the true bride and who is not the true bride that we know according to the word of God hallelujah amen now all scripture has got to be fulfilled we know that every scripture has got to be fulfilled in its day and in its time praise God hallelujah now remember before scripture must be fulfilled he says but this boycott I'm telling you about has to come that is part of the scriptures that must be fulfilled amen praise God no but before this boycott comes on her right there has to be a seed already sown for God to take a church out of that amen it's going to repeat themselves but he's telling you the fact a seed has got to be sowed and it's already sold that God already has now the opportunity to take his elect out of that praise God hallelujah amen do you understand now do you understand the seed and he repeats again this seed has already been sown the seed has been sown oh my yes yes now think of it first the denominational seed now this is my connotation uh the first the denominational seed has been sold you believe that amen who do you think saw that I mean sowing down Through the Ages but in our age why you think he mentioned Billy Graham or Roberts what do you think you mentioned those they were actually blinding and whatever else the people and they were actually suing the other seed and while he is sowing uh you know an enemy has done it at the other side is sowing also and uh and those that have no Revelation all calls it the word all is calling it The Seed it's the same thing to them they think it's the same thing it's not the same thing right because one was sowing towards the denominational seeds on the Earth and the other was sowing towards the elect of God the original seed that would come out of the Earth's Harvest okay praise God hallelujah now he says that denominational seed for is making a form forming itself into an image of the Beast they're forming in other words the religious uh uh configuration of churches or system it's changing all the time right some are being swallowed up by others others you may say oh that church closed down they disappeared no they went over into another group right so all these groups are consolidating they might not even know they're consolidating or consciously consolidating but they are consolidating together by the God's will purpose it's happening because the word must be fulfilled okay praise God so that denominational seed making and forming itself to an image of the Beast amen then he puts here now the Church of Rome right the Church of Rome but remember Hallelujah the other seed that's for being formed is the true bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen God what is happening now is the finishing of the mystery The Mystery of the ages is actually the true church right the true church in each age was the mystery of that age but now we are the end of it so just the angel cried and tried to tell us that in Revelation 10 the finishing the mystery you'll finish the mystery amen the mystery of God hallelujah amen in this form praise God so the mystery and formation of uh the completion let me say it this way of the body of Jesus Christ uh that was being formed down Through the Ages the new creation not the old creation which is physical natural but Jesus and my father work and now I work the father worked on a natural creation which came on the scene as we see it and know it now but he says now I work and his work was what this new creation a nuclear that's New Creation praise the Lord and that new creation was a formation of his body just like God formed the Natural Body of Adam and it laid on the Earth until God was ready to breathe in it the breath of life now we find out in the same way but we've quoted the courts and you've heard them before when he said in each age God formed like the feet and then he came up to the ties and then he came right up to the to the uh tongue uh of the Pentecostals and the CNAs and the of the Prophet amen and then the intelligence amen no more moving Parts but even then the body Adam laid on the ground perfect but until God breathed the Breath of Life in him Hallelujah that's the same thing now now we find out the body of the bride was formed down up Through the Ages until the thing the thing has come up now to its Perfection of the formation of the body of Christ Hallelujah and just waiting for that fullness of the breath of life to strike her amen watch we are here worshiping serving every day but this thing is going to begin to stand on its own feet walk move speak and do all things for the glory of God that will be just for a short while that they can know what's real and what's not real but I'm glad that I'm a part of it I'm glad that God has me look I can't answer every question I don't know how that's going to happen this is going to happen but the Bible says it's going to happen the Bible says all scripture must be fulfilled amen praise God hallelujah amen praise God I'm so glad for this prophet of God because his ministry sowed these seeds up today I I mean every day you do that the same thing you pick up a book maybe you don't read the whole team and read a couple of pages or something but every page every tape every sermon you'll find seeds seeds seeds seeds seeds seeds they're everywhere planted in there oh my and you see them and it's time for you to see them praise the Lord and you're quickened by them you're germinated by them it brings you to a place where we realize there praise God that this prophecies saw the message and Ministry sought the seeds and also brought down the dung pour of this lack of rain upon us that we might know who God is and what he's doing in this last time amen hallelujah now you understand that Adam's branded that's Eve was rejected to bring life to bring life amen she was at that time eternal life she would have been an instrument to bring forth eternal life but he says she was rejected to bring life and instead she brought forth death by her product that she produced then he says here our bodies amen is her product amen and uh and that we know that we all will die amen look at us you can see it that we all die because that's her product amen she didn't bring forth God's product uh what God wanted her to bring forth but she bring forth what she wants to bring forth the church is doing the same they're not bringing for what God wants them to bring forth they'll bring him forth whatever Doctrine they feel is right and what they feel what they think are what they see arise or whatever they they put together by their knowledge of languages and everything else mystifying the people that they know something when they know nothing they don't have anything whatsoever now we know that Adam's right rejected it and brought death Jehovah's brine is talking about Israel now you see now he died and God took a people out of the Gentiles for his name is not right I said his name Hallelujah not just titles his name his name just like a woman takes a man's name right the same way the bride see that's it my goodness now we know that uh he's going back what I've already said but he's saying here every Revival in each age uh that preacher or that Minister that God placed in that particular age it brings forth a true preacher and that preacher stays on the word and that creates a Revival that gathers all them elect out of that generation amen so that's what I was telling you down Through the Ages a harvest was gathered but by each uh messenger that was in that particular age our harvests were gathered but we are now at the end of all things for the church ages and we are at the last Harvest of all the ages to go out of here see oh my but now we find out that uh when they gathered them seeds right one set went into seed meaning it went rotten right oh and God could never use that again talking about denominationalism entering into the True Church of the Living God and once they denominated God could not use them again see and she died right then when she denominated died right then think of the al-muti god used them men but look at the and he named an organization he says they are dead at midnight look at their methodists look at them Pentecostals look at the Presbyterians look at the lutherans look at the nazarenes look at the pilgrim Holiness Godly men great man well you know Whitfield Robinson and many of the others they preached that gospel that generation received this seed and was that was sown for their part of the body that was to be formed for that age Hallelujah they received that part of the word to enable them to form that part of the body That was supposed to be formed for that particular age amen just not the way it is just like corn you know goes from the bud the stock and so on Leaf right up to the tassel and each age has to produce their particular uh part that they're supposed to produce right yeah the the corn is not going to just come up out of the ground it's got to start be informed first in one stage next stage next stage and we're at the last part where the full air we're all now all the husk and shock are curling away they're getting away from the real true seed of the Living God we don't have to as we used to think we don't have to separate ourselves from anybody God is a let the separation take place they naturally separate themselves they don't want to be around the true seed but they will want to turn on and said you put them out you separated yourself from them but you did no such thing amen you just stood on the word and you didn't change your faith you didn't change whatever you're doing but they just can't stand being around you with you or hear what you're talking and they can't take it anymore and then naturally just separate see it just curled away from the entire thing right oh praise God hallelujah also whatever it is that Minister brought the word for that particular day and then it called them people from the Four Winds of the Earth and took out the elect of that generation and from the elect ones he built that part of the House of the Living God amen praise God hallelujah amen oh praise God and then he says but now this ministry here has has to hone everything into place amen oh so when he comes when that headstone comes it will just catch right into it amen praise God hallelujah see oh my there will be a Rapture right then see because that headstone will come catch right into it and they'll be a Rapture and they'll all be taken Hallelujah and the rest of the body that was there will also have to come with it he's saying when we are caught up they without us couldn't be made perfect but once the Lord begins to move and we are being caught up amen they without us can't the body cannot be a perfect body until all the parts are there and so they all have to be raised they all have to be brought up praise God and the whole thing brought up together what Paul said then shall we be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air Hallelujah we'll all be together in the presence of the Living God hallelujah amen praise God now praise God and so she'll be then you must understand she'll be gone into heaven then do you believe that praise the Lord shall be gone into heaven now friends when I say she'll be gone into heaven not a denomination he made sure that he made it plain that you understand him clearly I'm not talking about denomination he said and continues I'm talking about the Church of the word of God she has gone into heaven and not a denomination he says do you believe it amen I believe it friends and I believe we're caught up in the middle of it right now and I'm winding this down here now by the grace of God remember I repeat again the word has been sold amen and now is the coming forth of the spirit amen use the word rain that's what he's saying he knows he sold the word and he's leaving so he says now what is happening is the coming forth of the spirit the rain the spirit rain is now to come upon the genes of God that's here upon the Earth Hallelujah because remember Billy Graham and them he let them preach everywhere or the Roberts and them Godly men though they be let them preach everywhere Hallelujah but thank God the Lord has sent me to sow seeds somewhere else that he might have a church amen and I believe the seed he repeats has been sown I believe she is now ready for the Harvest hallelujah praise God Amen now I put my uh a little note here calling this prophecy nothing it doesn't say that here but I put that beside here because that's how I see it and when that Spirit Falls and begins to move amongst them people that will cause them denominations to begin to swing together just as certain as I'm standing here in this pulpit see and then we know that the church at that time will be ousted I believe we are right near to that right now because the revelation of the world is building to such a point that literally as we have said before is when you try to talk to people even in the message and still don't have a real revelation of what the prophet taught and you sound as if you are one that's speaking in tongues uh you know um and that took to people they will not understand you people in the message might not get a full revelation of what you're saying but it will infuriate the denominational people because of what you are teaching what you are preaching is total opposition and and and the devil knows where it's headed the people naturally may not be consciously aware of where it's headed but the devil knows where this thing is headed and as the prophet said he's going to try to close you up but he said he's not going to be closed up she's going up praise God and we'll thank God for that hallelujah amen praise God they'll you see and the True Church of God will be ousted amen because them denominationals will swing together a certainness I'm standing here in this pulpit and the church will be ousted then there will start such a racket and in other words they're going to be against her the church and living God to discover there are people teaching there's one God when all of us all of us are teaching the Trinity you're telling us we are we are liars we are lying we're bringing false doctrine that we are this and you're not educated and we have all these doctors with divinity you can understand what he's saying there yeah such a racket that they'll swing together and Confederate it see and by confedering in it they'll put a boycott on anybody that does not belong to them amen that will not belong to them he's talking about that Confederation of churches right they will put a boycott on you amen praise the Lord hallelujah and then Rome will rule the world and then Rome will rule the world amen remember but shall only rule for one hour according to the scriptures we read it in the scripture there Babylon the greatest Fallen but in one hour all her glory and everything is taken away from her hallelujah amen remember she remember this she'll rule yes but only for a little piece of time only for a little piece of time right oh my she'll remember again he said not communism keep your eyes on romanism not on the Iron Curtain not on the Chinese bamboo curtain but on the Roman Purple curtain that's where we're to keep our eyes for romanism will rule this world and she'll rule it with the cooperation of the Protestants in a denominational formation of churches right oh my which God has already rejected he rejected it in type in Eve and he has rejected it consistently down Through the Ages the moment they denominated that's it that was the end of the whole thing that now friends that's as close as I know as I can tell you from the word of God amen before I close this let me show this to you here uh that in the same way when Jesus was brought to be tried and crucified because that's what it reminded me so much of that this do you know the Sadducees and the Pharisees who are bitter enemies because the Sadducees they were like modernism modern Christians they don't believe in angels and and spirits and all these kinds of things the Pharisees believed in angels and demons and supernatural beings the Sadducees wanted nothing to do with them because they they don't believe that right see and then you had um Herod well Herod was a worldly man Wine Woman song and great big parties and everything else and both Pharisees and Sadducees want nothing to do with him because the at least were people who spend their time in the Torah and so on and they want nothing to do with him and his worldliness uh that he had out there and then there was a pilot and Rome and they did not want to do much with them they gave them their orders they tell them what they had to do but there was not too much of Association but what I'm showing you here when we go back to the scripture Herod says Babylon has fallen in one hour but I and this formation of churches takes place just with a racket and then all of a sudden they come together but now in one night the Pharisees and the Sadducees the Romans Herod they all come into agreement this man has got to be crucified we got to get these people out of the land we've got to stop them from whatever they're doing the same thing they did back there you see that spirit is gone that spirit is still here fixing itself and getting ready to do the same thing again amen one night better enemies your night confederated that they might come against the Lord Jesus Christ and they're coming against him again in his great form brother I'm going back as I wind it close now he says remember this is as close as I know the word of God and remember all I have told you is the truth now take it home study it real closely and wisely pray and see what the Lord will reveal to you he's literally telling you not just because I'm say it you just believe it but I want you to take this go back seek the Lord for yourself pray pray over it ask him to show you reveal to you wisely and God will make it known do you love him do you love him he's asking that and I'm asking that do you love him will you serve him praise the name of the Lord God bless you all as we come to the end the last Harvest praise God God bless you tonight our gracious Heavenly Father we trust that you give forth wisdom and understanding to your people in the Simplicity uh or what appears to just be the Simplicity of the word of God for this day and for this hour I pray father that we all will allow ourselves to be as little children willing to learn willing to receive your word feed upon your word and grow in your grace as we walk with you every day in Jesus name amen and amen praise God the Lord bless you everyone here tonight and thank you for being here in the house of the Lord amen God bless you [Applause] just any day now the Lord is coming he'll be returned for you and me oh I'll be watching and I'll be waiting just any day his face I'll see just any day now Lord is coming you'll be returned for you and me oh I'll be watching [Music] foreign [Music]
