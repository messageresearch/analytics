[0:49] somehow she made a decision glory to God
[0:53] so I just thank God for her she's not
[0:55] feeling well today so I excuse her but
[0:58] she'll be out she's not a bed but she's
[1:01] not feeling she's feeling other sours so
[1:04] um I I give her a day off I take the
[1:08] responsibility praise the Lord
[1:10] hallelujah may the Lord richly bless
[1:12] every one of you here today in the house
[1:16] of the Lord I came and I heard the
[1:19] singing the tone picking up the the
[1:22] spirit of God already waiting in the
[1:26] congregation and uh hearing brother
[1:29] Danny
[1:30] the singing the remarks from brother
[1:32] Mike uh it just takes me uh back and it
[1:36] takes me
[1:38] forward cu the spirit of Christ is in
[1:41] the air Spirit of Revival is in the air
[1:45] Hallelujah power and the presence of God
[1:48] is in the very atmosphere and we want to
[1:51] thank God for his presence amen because
[1:54] without him we can do nothing we can
[1:57] have all the all the you know Pro
[1:59] progams we can have all the music we can
[2:02] have all the quotes and all the
[2:03] scriptures and everything to be right
[2:06] but without the power the presence of
[2:09] almighty God we don't have anything
[2:12] Prophet said you're just a nice
[2:14] wonderful religious group amen operating
[2:18] on the what the good amen the what what
[2:22] were the three Wills of God there just
[2:24] try to remember the good will of God
[2:27] perfect will of God per
[2:32] permissive permissive will of God right
[2:35] in other words God allow it God allow it
[2:39] doing the
[2:40] service without doing his will and even
[2:43] though we can sing We shout we can
[2:45] praise him but if that missing
[2:48] ingredient in the cake is there the top
[2:52] of the cake is going to fall is that
[2:54] right praise the Lord hallelujah it's
[2:57] not going to be worth anything so why
[2:59] one thing when before we even come here
[3:02] you pray that the spirit of God will be
[3:05] in this building waiting us before we
[3:08] get here amen is that right amen the
[3:11] spirit of the Living God is here because
[3:14] Jesus keeps all of his appointment amen
[3:16] amen you know I'm using that to from
[3:20] where brother Bron said do you know that
[3:23] if the Holy Spirit notices that you pray
[3:26] at a certain place every day at a
[3:29] certain time he said he'll be there
[3:33] every time before you get there waiting
[3:35] on him amen is that right praise the
[3:38] Lord you can look it up somewhere but
[3:40] the fact is it's the same thing with us
[3:42] coming to church he knows that you're
[3:45] going to be faithful you're coming
[3:46] you're going to be in the house of God
[3:48] and you come seriously soberly and
[3:50] sincerely to worship Him and lift up his
[3:53] name the spirit of God is going to fill
[3:56] this building before we even
[3:58] got this is not you're singing going to
[4:00] bring him down but he's going to be
[4:02] already in him amen and then he'll dance
[4:05] on the Rock while you're singing that's
[4:07] the angel will dance on the Rock the
[4:10] word praise the Lord while you're
[4:12] praising him because he knows you're
[4:13] praising him with
[4:16] understanding said if you sing sing with
[4:18] your understanding sing with Revelation
[4:21] praise the Lord whatever you do sing
[4:23] with the Revelation do it with the
[4:24] Revelation serve god with the Revelation
[4:26] praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen
[4:29] let's go back to our original
[4:31] textt and I'll try to finish
[4:35] the service we had over there in
[4:40] petroleum and that will be 2 Corinthians
[4:53] 46 Hallelujah
[5:00] 2
[5:01] Corinthians 4 verse
[5:06] 6 shall We Stand now let's read together
[5:11] with one
[5:12] voice for God who commanded the light to
[5:18] shine in the darkness has shine in our
[5:21] hearts to give the life of the knowledge
[5:25] of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[5:29] Christ father we ask your blessing on
[5:31] the word in Jesus name amen please be
[5:36] seated the same
[5:39] God um let me go back to it is the
[5:43] rising of the sun we brother gr said
[5:46] just as much as the Earth was covered
[5:48] with Darkness without form and without
[5:51] void he's actually describing the state
[5:55] of our
[5:57] souls of how it was covered with fa and
[6:02] darkness of denominational teachings
[6:05] Concepts
[6:07] ideas uh you were just fed over and your
[6:10] soul was just locked out but then God
[6:13] commanded the light to shine out of the
[6:16] darkness and the prophet said the
[6:18] darkness had to flee away so this is
[6:23] what Paul is actually referring to
[6:26] here when he's saying for God who
[6:28] commanded the light shined with f of
[6:31] Darkness had shined into our hearts amen
[6:34] not just let the sun come up in the
[6:36] natural world but it's the same God that
[6:40] allowed the S so to rise in your heart
[6:45] and shine his light or his Revelation in
[6:49] your heart to bring us out of the
[6:52] darkness that we were
[6:54] in and that is the light that we're
[6:56] walking in that's the light the prophet
[6:59] talks about or sings about when he sings
[7:03] they'll walk in the light such a
[7:06] beautiful light walk where the duw drops
[7:11] of mercies are bright shine all around
[7:15] us by day and by night it is Jesus he's
[7:21] the light of the world Amen we walk in
[7:26] the light such a beautiful light
[7:30] we're saying we'll walk in the
[7:32] Revelation the faith once delivered unto
[7:35] us as the saints of God and you can't
[7:39] just come like that God has to decide to
[7:42] shine his light into your hearts amen
[7:47] praise the Lord and then you receive the
[7:50] light of the knowledge or the
[7:53] understanding of the knowledge of God
[7:55] that's revealed in the face or the word
[7:57] revealed in the face of Jesus Christ
[7:59] Christ which is the word the word is
[8:01] just his face he hides behind him in his
[8:04] word so we're happy for that praise the
[8:06] Lord our last talk when we were just
[8:10] talking with you we talked about uh
[8:12] brother brand saying sometime in the
[8:14] evening my wife and I we just go into
[8:17] the room and there the kids are sleeping
[8:19] and while they're sleeping we look at
[8:21] them and he says she I look at her and
[8:24] says to her uh M do you know he's got
[8:26] your big eyes just like yours amen and
[8:29] she'll say uh and he's got your lips his
[8:32] lips are just like yours sees the
[8:35] features of both of us represented in
[8:39] that child Hallelujah of God wants to
[8:43] see the reflection of himself in his
[8:47] church his church reflecting the power
[8:51] and glory to the world Amen praise the
[8:55] Lord God wants to see or identify his
[8:59] characteristics in your
[9:01] life he wants to identify the Bible says
[9:06] by faith Abel offered a better sacrifice
[9:11] God testifying of his gifts in other
[9:14] words it wasn't Abel or you or I that
[9:16] has to go out and say I'm a Christian
[9:18] I'm a Christian I'm a Believer I really
[9:20] believe this message but the Bible tells
[9:23] us when you caught the genuine
[9:25] revelation God will testify of your
[9:28] gifts
[9:29] God will testify of who you are and what
[9:33] is in you praise the Lord for he is
[9:35] identified by his own characteristics
[9:39] glory to God hallelujah we furthermore
[9:41] talked about uh that boy that saw
[9:45] himself in the mirror and and when he
[9:48] saw himself in the mirror he said Mama
[9:51] that's me that's me praise the lord well
[9:55] don't you understand when God looks down
[9:57] adoption time and he sees his children
[10:01] coming into spiritual maturity coming to
[10:04] the place where they start to act look
[10:07] and talk like him he looks back and say
[10:10] wait a minute that's me that's just how
[10:12] I would have done it that's just what I
[10:14] would have said if I was still on Earth
[10:17] that's how I going to reacted that's
[10:19] they're exactly right hallelujah praise
[10:22] the lord they're doing just like I
[10:25] wanted Oh Glory to God that's the kind
[10:28] of children that God is looking for amen
[10:32] the man in the mirror is
[10:35] Christ and he sees himself in US amen
[10:39] when we clean up the smoke from off of
[10:42] the mirror then he can see clearly who
[10:46] he is in us and we can see who we are in
[10:51] him and be able to say now by Revelation
[10:55] I can say I and my father are one amen
[11:00] glory to God I and my father are one
[11:03] just like the river is one with the
[11:06] ocean the ocean flows into the river and
[11:08] the river flows back in the ocean H you
[11:11] just call one a river but it's the same
[11:13] thing flowing back and forth glory to
[11:15] God and that's our relationship with the
[11:19] Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen Oh

[17:54] Nazareth but God in you there he Christ
[17:59] in you amen maybe not all of him like
[18:03] the great Diamond but they'll see facets
[18:05] of him they'll see little glimpses of
[18:08] him a little something come out of your
[18:10] life and they see Jesus and recognize
[18:13] that that couldn't be you but him amen
[18:16] praise the Lord you see what it is when
[18:19] the Holy Spirit is trying to do that to
[18:23] the church trying to beat it and turn it
[18:27] over and speak it again until that
[18:31] church Christ reflects in that church to
[18:35] the people and by that proving his
[18:39] resurrection that he's alive forever
[18:41] more do you believe that
[18:44] hallelujah oh he wants the world to know
[18:47] he's not dead but he's alive and he
[18:50] lives in me and he lives in the king of
[18:54] all Heaven and Earth lives in US glory
[18:57] to God and he wants all world to GL he's
[19:00] trying to get his people get the people
[19:04] to beat the world out of
[19:07] themselves Hallelujah let's check
[19:09] ourselves and see where we stand and how
[19:13] we can clean up the worldliness that is
[19:15] in our lives we hardly recognize
[19:18] something how it sometimes how it creeps
[19:20] upon on us because we are in the world
[19:24] and we can't help it the thing creeps
[19:26] upon us but ever so often we have to
[19:29] give ourselves a selfcheck amen amen
[19:32] let's do a self-examination amen amen
[19:35] there's nobody better to examine you but
[19:40] yourself and God is that right you let a
[19:44] man or a woman examine themselves and
[19:47] let them see if they be in the F glory
[19:50] to God hallelujah but most of the Modern
[19:53] Man Church wastes time examining one
[19:57] another examining other people instead
[20:00] of examining our
[20:02] ownselves Paul said you better take heed
[20:05] amen that you stand that you're standing
[20:08] forless you fall amen don't rejoice in
[20:12] anybody else's
[20:14] mistakes everybody else is failure we
[20:17] saying the West is today for you
[20:19] tomorrow for me m is that right am that
[20:23] right got the British have a statement
[20:25] every dog has his day my so don't
[20:29] Rejoice too much that's why the Bible
[20:31] say genuine love rejoice it not in
[20:34] iniquity don't Rejoice on something bad
[20:36] happen to somebody else oh no rejoice in
[20:40] the
[20:41] truth Rejoice that the word can be
[20:44] revealed to the people that's what we
[20:46] got to
[20:47] Rejoice glory to God and love that's
[20:50] what doesn't it doesn't deliberately go
[20:53] out there to expose people and shame and
[20:56] embar people but love covers the
[20:58] multitude
[21:00] I didn't say love compromise no but I
[21:03] said love covers and when I say love
[21:06] covers love covers in the sense that it
[21:10] gives you an opportunity to change your
[21:13] way is that right it's not going to
[21:16] cover up if you're living in adultery
[21:17] just cover it up like that but it will
[21:20] go and but Jesus said and talk to your
[21:23] brother directly before you go make it
[21:26] broadcast talk to him directly or
[21:28] directly so they can correct the thing
[21:31] then if they don't correct it bring a
[21:32] witness with you and if they still want
[21:34] live with this now you got the right to
[21:37] tell the whole church tell the whole
[21:39] church let the whole church know about
[21:40] it but not the moment you hear something
[21:43] you got into this hybrid religion spirit
[21:47] I hear this and I hear that with a big
[21:49] too long here hearing that did you hear
[21:52] you know you know my God sometimes it it
[21:55] sickens you that you meet Brethren and
[21:57] the first thing they going to say praise
[21:59] the Lord Brother God bless you by the
[22:01] way did you
[22:02] hear what happened with brother did you
[22:05] hear what happened with sister
[22:07] this well no I didn't hear and I don't
[22:10] really want to hear unless God wants me
[22:12] to
[22:13] hear understand I don't want my mind
[22:16] contaminated so that I have sped views
[22:18] about
[22:19] anybody I want my mind clean and clear
[22:23] so that when the Holy Spirit wants to
[22:24] show me something it's there not
[22:26] tampered with or colored with or or or
[22:29] touch with any kind of prejudice
[22:31] prejudicial ideas or thoughts but
[22:35] clean amen praise the name of the Lord a
[22:38] clean mind and a clean heart to do the
[22:41] service of God and so that you can have
[22:44] confidence when I say something because
[22:47] if I say something and you know it's by
[22:50] some trick or some some news or some
[22:52] color how you going to have confidence
[22:54] in that kind of a Ministry or that kind
[22:56] of a voice you have to have conf that's
[22:58] when the the Holy
[23:00] Ghost

[23:05] it's it's the sayth the Lord blessed be
[23:07] the name of the Living God hallelujah
[23:10] see DAV it is he's trying to get the
[23:14] people to beat the worldliness out of
[23:17] them you see the devil is trying to pour
[23:19] it in you bet the devil is trying to
[23:22] pour it in on you he tried to pour in
[23:24] everything he can upon you praise the
[23:26] Lord amen and that's what he's doing
[23:29] Brothers uh excuse me brother in the
[23:33] back come
[23:35] inside close the doors and let the air
[23:39] conditioning build up in here when we
[23:41] leave these doors open it goes down the
[23:44] stairs and then it feels like we don't
[23:47] have any air conditioning in there but
[23:49] we do so the doors need to be closed GL

[27:41] crabby is that right my God the worst
[27:44] thing you can see in the message men and

[28:16] their my God we look there's an age
[28:20] where because of the dangers in society
[28:23] because of the the abuses of society you
[28:26] find out some women and men try to make
[28:31] their face as Fierce as they can because
[28:34] that fierceness of their face they think

[29:00] everything like that I repeat again and
[29:02] I want to forget what the holy spirit
[29:04] said it shall come to that's speaking to
[29:06] me the past the women are going to start
[29:09] developing big bushy Bears and the men's
[29:13] faces are going to become
[29:14] smooth like how the women's faces used
[29:17] to be and you hardly going be able to
[29:20] distinguish much difference there amen
[29:24] but God wants to meet your life I'm
[29:26] ready for a holy ghost meeting

[30:05] now when the Holy Spirit beats your life
[30:09] chips away we may be different one from
[30:15] another see we are a body but part the
[30:19] great Diamond when it's Chip it's
[30:23] magnificent and God has so arranged his
[30:26] Affairs on the Earth till he would be
[30:29] able to be like this big diamond the
[30:32] light of the diamond reflecting the Rays
[30:36] of light and some of those Rays may be
[30:40] blue and some may be
[30:44] green others may be of other colors see
[30:48] each light will be ar R in a different
[30:52] color may be but whatever color it is
[30:56] it's reflecting from the same great
[31:00] Diamond hallelujah amen glory to God
[31:03] look at us right there red and yellow
[31:05] black and white they are precious in His
[31:08] sight Jesus loves the little children
[31:11] everywhere amen regardless of what color
[31:15] we are reflecting we reflecting from the
[31:18] same Revelation same God same message
[31:21] the same
[31:24] life for the glory of God hallelujah
[31:28] praise the name of the Living God all
[31:31] called out to do that for his glory and
[31:34] honor amen and when you do that you're
[31:37] reflecting where you come
[31:39] from listen what the prophet of God says
[31:43] here he says now we are either
[31:46] influenced from this way or that way you
[31:52] cannot be here a spiritual being whether
[31:56] you be sinner or saint
[31:58] you are either influenced from here from
[32:02] above or from below the other world Amen
[32:08] either from the other world or from
[32:11] above see that's the way it is now your
[32:16] your influence from Heaven because your
[32:20] Celestial body is already waiting you up
[32:24] there amen praise God now if you are
[32:28] Wicked and you are hypocritical and
[32:31] indifferent your Celestial body is down
[32:35] there regardless of how religious you
[32:38] are and what you think that it's up
[32:40] there it's really down there amen
[32:44] because the
[32:46] fruit that you bear before the people
[32:51] proves where you are from amen
[32:54] hallelujah what the life is manifesting
[32:58] is proving your Origins it's proving
[33:02] where you come from and also where you
[33:06] are going you are
[33:09] here what you are somewhere else glory
[33:13] to God see glory to God you realize what
[33:17] he's telling you we are in the negative
[33:20] but your positive is there amen we are
[33:25] really a reflection in time that's why
[33:28] we only time beings the real you that
[33:32] real Celestial body is somewhere else
[33:35] and it's reflecting back here on the
[33:37] earth
[33:39] so that's why another place he says if I
[33:43] put five fingers like this and the light
[33:45] strikes five fingers he says then you're
[33:48] supposed to see five fingers here but if
[33:51] you see some monstrosity or something
[33:52] else change then it's got to be that
[33:55] there's some kind of monster back here
[33:57] reflecting the here that's the way it is
[33:59] so you are the reflection of that
[34:03] Celestial body that you have above or
[34:09] below and here praise the Lord I want
[34:12] you to hear what he says here the fruits
[34:15] you bear before the world proves where
[34:18] you come from and proves what your
[34:22] inheritance is going to be I want to P
[34:25] out of the message called the Seal of
[34:27] the Antichrist he said now uh on the man
[34:32] on this side of him the thief on this
[34:34] side of
[34:35] him preached to him through the cross
[34:38] saying why are you condemning him for he
[34:42] has done nothing wrong but see we are
[34:46] condemned both of us we getting exactly
[34:50] what we need coming to us we deserve it
[34:53] but this man the word has done nothing
[34:57] then he turned and said
[34:59] Lord Lord remember me when thou comest
[35:05] into thy kingdom and Jesus speaking back
[35:08] said
[35:09] today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise
[35:12] here you are he says notice and I'm
[35:15] going take this in Judas
[35:18] Iscariot hanged himself and died on a
[35:21] sycamore
[35:23] tree and shortly after
[35:29] Jesus was hang on a tree it's two trees
[35:34] cut made the cross but he was also hang
[35:38] on the
[35:39] tree he says here Judas the son of
[35:45] prici died on that
[35:47] tree and taking with him that
[35:51] unrepentant
[35:53] sinner Jesus died on the tree and he
[35:57] there he was going back to Heaven taking
[36:00] with him the repentant sinner oh think
[36:05] about it coming down from heaven
[36:07] returning back to Heaven taking with him
[36:10] the believer and Judas the son of
[36:12] predition coming from Hell going back to
[36:15] hell and taking with him the unrepentant
[36:18] sinner you are representing something
[36:22] here down here that you really are
[36:25] somewhere else
[36:27] that is why I always tell you that if
[36:30] you if you are if you your your
[36:33] celestial bodies in heaven praising God
[36:36] giving glory and honor to God then you
[36:38] would want to praise God come here I
[36:41] mean I've been saying that for years you
[36:43] can't stop you can't help it amen
[36:46] because the Deep will call to the deep
[36:47] and the Deep must
[36:49] respond GL to God hallelujah and one day
[36:53] it will all be together again amen he
[36:56] says do you know when you CAU the first
[36:59] revelation you C the Revelation you have
[37:02] just heard or made contact with youry
[37:05] amen amen
[37:07] hallelujah with
[37:10] superal Revelation amen and it begins to
[37:14] reveal to you who you are where you come
[37:17] from what your purpose is what you here
[37:20] on Earth glory to God Hallelujah Lord
[37:23] God forever more he says you are
[37:25] influenced either this way or that way
[37:28] and the fruit you bear before the world
[37:31] Bru to the people where you come from
[37:34] and whatever inheritance is think about
[37:37] it right now you are glorified in the
[37:41] presence of God Romans 828 to 30 Born
[37:45] Again Believers for if this Earthly
[37:48] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[37:50] waiting in glory not just somewhere else
[37:54] but right Yonder waiting right now
[37:58] hallelujah it's there and these Earthly
[38:01] bodies are groing to be covered with
[38:04] that immortality of Romans 8:22 to 23
[38:09] praise the Lord is that right sickness a
[38:13] pains disappointments haraches all all
[38:17] of it will be gone amen and this old
[38:20] best house will be shut down amen is
[38:23] that right we close down this old pest
[38:26] house we don't have to worry about this
[38:28] anymore because this is in time but the
[38:31] celestial body is eternal is that right
[38:34] so there's no sickness there's no pain
[38:36] there is no aging there is there is no
[38:38] time there praise the Lord so there
[38:40] there's nothing to worry about praise
[38:42] the Lord hallelujah oh praise God I
[38:45] wrote a note on the side here you can
[38:47] live like a religious
[38:50] devil you can't live like a religious
[38:53] devil and still expect to go to heaven
[38:56] is that right
[38:58] religious you know that the devil wash
[39:01] [Music]
[39:03] God do you know that he sign also with
[39:06] all them Angels
[39:08] Wash and he was a leader in doing that
[39:12] and yet there was no place found for him
[39:15] his name was not in the Lamb's Book of
[39:17] Life amen is that right his name wasn't
[39:19] in the Lamb's Book of Life so we know
[39:21] Satan is not going to be saved right let
[39:25] me throw this up so you understand
[39:27] because these Devils bu some really
[39:28] coton arguments some of them argue that
[39:31] Satan will be saved because if you're a
[39:33] true servant of God you will be save and
[39:36] then they go on to say God uses Satan to
[39:39] tempt the Believers God us Satan to tell
[39:42] Li God perit Satan to go and temp J God
[39:45] per him so the devil is actually serving
[39:47] God when he doing the evil so therefore
[39:49] you will be
[39:51] saved right that's that's the argument
[39:54] I'll if anybody who raise that to you
[39:56] it's nonsense
[39:57] right but that's what they say but we
[39:59] know without the shedding of blood there
[40:01] is no remission of and that means he has
[40:03] the command of the blood and he the
[40:05] blood he hates the name of Jesus he
[40:07] doesn't want anything to do with it so
[40:09] there is no salvation in no other but in
[40:11] the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so we
[40:15] are supposed to be the reflection of the
[40:17] real you you and I are to be the
[40:19] reflection of the real you that is
[40:22] somewhere else and you're reflecting
[40:25] them here where you what you are
[40:27] somewhere else glory to God hallelujah
[40:30] God of course knew who you are amen and
[40:34] where you are going he knows your
[40:36] destination when you leave here and that
[40:38] is what you know predestination or he
[40:41] pre where you will be going before you
[40:44] even got here God already pre you glory
[40:47] to God hallelujah glory to his wonderful
[40:50] precious name now taking that thought
[40:54] brother BR continues he says now what
[40:57] you are what your Celestial or your
[41:00] terestrial body is of
[41:03] Y what it is somewhere else is what you
[41:07] are reflecting back here from the spirit
[41:12] L amen you're reflecting something from
[41:16] the spirit land what you
[41:19] are is what you are here what you are
[41:23] there is what you are here if you are
[41:27] still vulgar
[41:30] minded and so for some vulg spirit in
[41:34] the spirit lines then you will be binded
[41:39] here can you say
[41:40] Amen praise the Lord if you have got
[41:44] malice if you have got strife and envy
[41:49] back there in the spirit god with that
[41:54] it will then reflect back down here in
[41:59] you down here see you're in the spirit
[42:03] land with that and reflect back here but
[42:07] if your entire innermost being has
[42:10] become cleansed or being cleansed and
[42:12] first it shows you have got a a body I
[42:17] say a supernatural body out yonder
[42:20] already W in you that's been cleansed
[42:23] and forged by the blood and now it's
[42:26] seeking to react into your flesh is that
[42:30] right do you believe that oh praise God
[42:34] hallelujah somebody would say brother
[42:36] where you getting this stuff from right
[42:37] in
[42:38] the amen he says that what is back in
[42:41] the spirit land is seeking to manifest
[42:44] uh true your flesh here today praise the
[42:47] Lord hallelujah so you are not just
[42:50] sitting here you're also seeking in
[42:52] Heavenly places in
[42:54] Christ Hallelujah not your physical body
[42:58] but your
[43:00] representation is seated in Heavenly
[43:02] places in the Lord and Savior Jesus
[43:06] Christ amen if this Earthly Tabernacle
[43:09] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[43:13] praise God forever more amen yes sir
[43:17] think about it Moses wasn't him Joshua
[43:20] wasn't him and you are in him now praise
[43:24] the Lord all the other messengers of
[43:26] course were in him before the
[43:28] foundations of the world and we
[43:31] understand that God uh if I had a if I
[43:34] could draw a diagram I'll do that
[43:36] another time and just show you uh I draw
[43:38] God like a big circle let me just
[43:40] describe it and it's right on the bottom
[43:42] line notes here right now I got at
[43:45] bottom my notes Here God like a big
[43:47] circle and in that circle is a whole
[43:50] millions of billions of Dots Dots Dots
[43:52] we were in him before the foundations
[43:55] yes sir amen
[43:57] right but then what happens then God
[44:01] made Adam and Adam and Eve and you know
[44:04] they were in flesh and again we were in
[44:06] him we were in Adam so I drew a little
[44:09] man and around the LA area I took my pen
[44:12] and put a whole lot of gods because we
[44:14] were in him brother said you were in
[44:16] your great great great great grandfather
[44:18] just like Levi was in Abraham and he was
[44:20] paying TI in Abraham that's why Abraham
[44:23] had the desire to pay ties because it
[44:25] was the attribute of God in him reacting
[44:28] through him praise God so we were in him
[44:32] in Adam in Adam because he s we all di
[44:36] amen but we now arew in Christ We Are
[44:39] Made Alive so I drew another little man
[44:42] and put Christ there and draw a little
[44:43] little dots in there so we are in here
[44:46] praise the Lord and then you understand
[44:48] when I'm saying in him in him in him I'm
[44:50] also refering that we were in him as the
[44:52] bride and the rib that was in Adam and
[44:55] we were in Christ again as the bride in
[44:57] there praise the Lord until God decided
[45:00] that he would take us out in this age
[45:02] and make us manifested one with him
[45:05] praise the name of the Lord glory to God
[45:08] so realize this friends he says now we
[45:12] are reflecting the message of this age
[45:15] to the world that is the light of the
[45:18] world what is the light of the world
[45:21] Jesus what's the light of the world the
[45:23] word for the hour is the light for this
[45:26] world today to shine them through the
[45:28] darkness but you see you you are the
[45:32] light of the world but if that is light
[45:35] is hid by some denominational Buell
[45:39] basket covering over you and covering
[45:42] over your mind how are you going to be
[45:45] able to see it by your Traditions you
[45:48] make the light of no effect by your
[45:51] denominational they are trying to keep
[45:53] the light away from the church they
[45:55] won't go in will they let you come in
[45:59] Praise the Lord hallelujah but oh
[46:02] brother sister you remember there was a
[46:05] man by the name of BL
[46:07] martinus he sat beside the highway
[46:10] begging for scraps we were all like that
[46:13] one day we didn't know the truth and we
[46:16] just any scrap we get any little truth
[46:18] we got we Rejoice over a little scrap
[46:21] that somebody thrw at us whether message
[46:23] person or denominational person we just
[46:26] Rejoice because we got another little
[46:27] scrap and and we sat by the highway
[46:30] there uh begging but we could not see
[46:33] whatsoever but Prophet said but
[46:36] remember we were wearing dirty rags
[46:40] dirty rags all the time but those RS
[46:44] serve their
[46:45] purpose covering you as floing but now
[46:51] those RS are just now become Pap no what
[46:55] he's talking about how the the
[46:56] denominational justification of the
[46:58] Luther they use those things they cover
[47:01] themselves and it covered them for a
[47:02] while but now it's just written on the
[47:04] word it's nothing but papay for the age
[47:06] has passed and we're in totally in a
[47:08] different age for justification has
[47:11] served its
[47:13] time now sanctification through Wesley
[47:17] served its
[47:18] time and now comes to the baptism of the
[47:21] Holy
[47:22] Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:25] are served in
[47:28] until now the holy
