[33:19] before we turn the service over to
[33:20] Pastor Simon that in the back we have a
[33:24] visitor it's a coyote
[33:27] it's got pups and we're asking that no
[33:31] children especially but nobody go back
[33:34] there or even hang around in the parking
[33:36] lot tonight and because it does get
[33:38] aggressive if it thinks that it's you
[33:41] know it's been using his motherly
[33:42] instincts so that's not especially
[33:45] children nobody out by themselves and uh
[33:47] into the car and go home tonight all
[33:50] right and we're gonna have to watch it
[33:52] in the next few Services as well give it
[33:54] its time it'll go away all right
[33:57] praise God
[33:59] amen
[34:00] is that Death Michelle all right we're
[34:03] going to invite our pastor to come but

[35:10] foreign
[35:13] [Music]
[35:21] [Music]
[35:29] [Music]
[35:40] praise be the god it's good to be here
[35:44] this evening
[35:45] the Lord bless you in a great and
[35:48] wonderful way as our brother has said
[35:53] we've come here with one purpose and
[35:56] that is to memorialize
[35:59] and to celebrate amen this sacrifice
[36:04] that Jesus has made for us
[36:07] so let us not after the service uh hang
[36:11] around you know but just leave and go
[36:15] home especially now that we hear we have
[36:19] this uh beautiful animal in the back but
[36:22] not to be played with
[36:25] um for right now the instincts to
[36:28] protect its own is in it so we have to
[36:31] avoid it for a little while okay so
[36:34] that's important I want you to know also
[36:37] that every one of you who have come to
[36:40] Christ
[36:41] by the grace of almighty God I consider
[36:45] you as my children in Christ
[36:50] uh I consider you as Those whom God has
[36:55] honored me through the years to bring
[36:59] um to your attention
[37:02] his divine presence
[37:05] we know we cannot see him in our eyes
[37:08] but the one whom we feel a bit in our
[37:12] hearts
[37:13] is making himself clearer and clearer
[37:16] every day
[37:17] and I pray that somehow the holy spirit
[37:20] will visit you and let you know the
[37:24] things that I'm saying to you they are
[37:26] true
[37:27] not because I say so because he
[37:31] witnesses to what I'm saying
[37:34] speaking on his behalf for his glory and
[37:37] for his honor so let's look away to
[37:40] Jesus
[37:41] praise the lord we are going to enter
[37:44] into the service
[37:46] uh where the musicians just better stay
[37:51] stand by in other words you can go to
[37:53] your seat but just stand by as I feel
[37:56] moved I'll just call you right uh Our
[38:00] Sister on the musical instrument can
[38:03] stay right there
[38:04] and together let's worship and glorify
[38:08] God okay God bless you we welcome all
[38:11] our visitors we welcome those of you who
[38:15] are with us in our midst I don't know if
[38:18] I'm seeing right is that is that Brandon
[38:22] Michael
[38:25] okay all right
[38:28] I just thought I saw brother Michael
[38:30] lasari but I guess that's age right
[38:33] catching up with you but
[38:35] God is good isn't he
[38:38] let us read our scripture which I'll now
[38:40] give to our brother which would be
[38:42] Matthew chapter 26 reading from verses
[38:45] 26 to 30.
[39:02] yours will be up on the screen and I'll
[39:05] read from the word
[39:08] and as they were eating Jesus Took bread
[39:13] and blessed it and break it and gave it
[39:18] to the disciples and said take eat this
[39:24] is my body
[39:26] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[39:30] gave it to them saying drinky all of it
[39:35] for this is my blood of the new
[39:38] testament which is shed for many for the
[39:43] remission of sins
[39:45] but I see unto you I will not drink and
[39:50] sport of this fruit of the vine until
[39:53] the day when I drink it new with you in
[39:58] my father's Kingdom
[40:01] praise the Lord our dear loving gracious
[40:05] Heavenly Father we thank you for the
[40:09] written word which we have read and we
[40:11] pray that Lord Jesus because we all
[40:15] stand together here without your
[40:18] presence here in our midst this will be
[40:22] just a large group or a gathering of
[40:25] people but father the difference is when
[40:29] you come and be with us on the scene and
[40:34] we can sense and know your presence
[40:37] father and while I bring the word of God
[40:40] uh Lord we invite the Holy Spirit to
[40:45] draw near to us and comfort Us in this
[40:48] hour May the power in the presence of
[40:51] this God's holy spirit minister to us
[40:55] through the word of God and the vessels
[40:58] you have set aside for this hour may you
[41:01] receive glory honor and praise those who
[41:04] have come father with their troubles
[41:07] their trials their suffering their
[41:09] sicknesses May the Holy Spirit minister
[41:13] to them Father they don't need for me to
[41:16] touch them because you are the great
[41:20] physician you are walking up and down
[41:24] these aisles you are moving amongst the
[41:27] candlesticks once more you are here with
[41:31] your people and we ask now father that
[41:35] you will bring everything alive that you
[41:39] may be glorified in Jesus Christ's name
[41:42] amen and amen God bless every one of you
[41:46] please be seated at this particular time
[41:56] as I've said we are here today to
[42:00] observe the Lord's Supper
[42:04] and as we observe the Lord's supper
[42:09] together it's a wonderful opportunity to
[42:13] reflect on the foundations of our faith
[42:17] the foundation of our faith amen praise
[42:21] God we also must think about the depths
[42:25] of our sins
[42:27] because it doesn't matter who we are we
[42:31] reflect and think where we were and
[42:35] where we are where he brought us from
[42:37] and where we are by the grace of God
[42:40] today
[42:42] we ought to reflect also on the
[42:47] sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ in
[42:50] paying the Redemption price for our sins
[42:54] let us think so much how that we were
[42:58] all in the devil's pawn shop
[43:01] uh let me turn it another way we were
[43:04] like Pawns in the devil's hands and he
[43:07] just played us as we would use the term
[43:10] in modern terms he just played us around
[43:13] like puppets in the hand of a puppet
[43:16] master uh but thank God while we were in
[43:20] that old antique pawn shop Jesus Christ
[43:26] came and paid the price for us
[43:30] remember the word Redemption means uh
[43:33] the price to buy back something
[43:36] redeem something that you pawned or was
[43:40] lodged with the pawn broker which means
[43:45] that before you you receive that
[43:48] Redemption somebody owned you
[43:52] you are owned already if you're lost you
[43:57] were lost from somewhere where were you
[44:00] where were you when the morning Stars
[44:03] sank together and the sons and dust of
[44:05] God shouted for Joy you see we must
[44:09] understand that we are not just
[44:11] creatures of time
[44:13] we are creatures of Eternity we are Sons
[44:17] and Daughters of the Living God now born
[44:21] by the spirit that we might come to a
[44:25] supernatural awareness of who we really
[44:30] are
[44:31] we are not just Mortals on the Earth but
[44:35] we are the embodiment and of parts of of
[44:39] the Living God
[44:41] we are pieces of the Almighty Christ
[44:44] within our hearts makes us himself alive
[44:48] once more through us for his grace and
[44:51] for his honor amen so the law this
[44:55] Lord's Supper is really uh unifying
[44:59] event
[45:00] that the Lord himself has instituted for
[45:04] us that from time to time when we
[45:08] worship and we seem to drift away from
[45:12] each other in relationship in thoughts
[45:16] and everything else God uses this event
[45:20] to bring a unifying influence upon us
[45:24] that we can bring it together and say we
[45:29] are together again
[45:31] we are here praising the Lord
[45:34] we're giving glory to his name
[45:37] we are all conscious of what he has done
[45:39] for us and we look forward for what he
[45:43] is going to do for us amen thank God not
[45:47] only is this a unifying event but coming
[45:51] together like this is a a living
[45:53] testimony
[45:55] to his Saving Grace
[45:57] that others might know that we are
[46:01] changed we are not what we used to be
[46:05] every one of us can think of ourselves
[46:08] of what we were no matter if you think
[46:11] you were a good boy a good man a good
[46:13] woman somehow when the grace of God
[46:17] comes into your life you are changed you
[46:21] are different your outlook your
[46:23] worldview your your view of the word of
[46:26] God is completely transformed because
[46:29] God changes it by his great power to
[46:33] transform amen so let us celebrate this
[46:37] communion amen are you going to join me
[46:41] are we going to celebrate this together
[46:44] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[46:48] so let's take these moments and focus
[46:52] our attention some and Minds upon our
[46:57] lovely Lord Jesus Christ as the song
[47:00] says Look Away to Jesus look away from
[47:04] the things of the world if the disciples
[47:07] had looked away from the storm when they
[47:10] were crossing the Sea of Galilee from
[47:14] one side to the other and he said let's
[47:18] go over to the other side they took the
[47:21] ship the storm came the mass that broken
[47:25] the sails were torn lightning flashing
[47:29] thunder rolling the ship was rocking on
[47:32] every hand amen and then the Bible says
[47:36] their growth soar afraid amen and they
[47:40] went to wake Jesus that should have told
[47:43] them something
[47:44] he just took a pillow and went to sleep
[47:48] while all the storm was going on because
[47:51] he had already told them let's go over
[47:55] he did not say let's go under but he
[47:59] said let's go over on the other side if
[48:03] they had believed him there would not
[48:05] have worried with the with the up the
[48:09] things they are seeing that's why faith
[48:12] is the evidence of Things Not Seen
[48:15] don't look never mind the circumstances
[48:19] the trails the troubles the tribulations
[48:21] the problems that surround you keep your
[48:25] eyes your naturalized the eyes of your
[48:28] mind or your heart keep them keep your
[48:31] thoughts away from that and look to the
[48:34] word of God Look Away to Jesus see Jesus
[48:39] only
[48:40] for this too shall pass
[48:44] you read in the Bible and it came to
[48:46] pass and it came to pass and it came to
[48:48] pass the only thing that stays is Jesus
[48:52] Christ the only thing that is eternal is
[48:55] God himself everything else comes to
[48:58] pass so friends no matter what you may
[49:01] be going through it has come you can't
[49:04] say it's not there but it too must pass
[49:07] away because that's the grace of God
[49:10] that's the word of God to you that God
[49:13] has sent to our hearts amen yes sir
[49:16] praise His Wonderful Name glory to God
[49:19] Amen so as we come like this
[49:23] let us spend some time in prayer
[49:26] because Jesus before he went to Calvary
[49:32] what did he do in the Garden of
[49:34] Gethsemane
[49:36] the Bible tells us that he prayed and he
[49:40] prayed so much that he sweat drops of
[49:44] blood and if he prayed at a time like
[49:47] this immemorial to him when we come
[49:51] together to observe the Lord's supper
[49:54] and we remember that he prayed we should
[49:58] pray also we should pray immemorial to
[50:02] that which he did for us will you take a
[50:05] few moments just bow your head right
[50:08] where you are and whatever prayer you
[50:10] may have in your heart talk to God May
[50:14] the holy spirit of God take his word and
[50:18] bear witness to us that even while this
[50:22] service is in progress
[50:24] Devils that hold you
[50:28] in your mind
[50:30] taking you off your mental balance
[50:35] sickness within your body
[50:38] trouble within your soul
[50:41] will begin to leave you in the midst of
[50:44] the service
[50:45] so that after you leave before you leave
[50:49] and after you leave
[50:51] the spirit of almighty God working
[50:53] within your spirit your body and your
[50:56] soul will completely cleanse you and
[51:00] make you whole
[51:03] as with your hands bowed
[51:06] let us acknowledge
[51:08] his grace
[51:10] and love within our lives
[51:14] let us acknowledge
[51:16] his grace mercy
[51:20] and his long-suffering with this wicked
[51:24] World in which we are living in
[51:29] let us raise our hands and give praise
[51:32] and let us give thanks
[51:34] oh Hallelujah let's give him thanks for
[51:38] who he is

[51:56] Peace the Alpha and the Amiga or praise

[52:04] let's give him thanks let's give him
[52:06] glory for who he is to us and who we are
[52:11] to him amen praise be to God hallelujah
[52:15] let us pray for this community and your
[52:20] community wherever you are from
[52:24] neighborhoods Neighbors
[52:27] those around us let us pray for them
[52:30] they may never know that you are praying
[52:34] for them but let your influence
[52:38] of your prayers go out
[52:40] this evening in this Lord's Supper to
[52:45] reach them and touch them until you
[52:47] yourself begin to recognize
[52:50] something has happened within their
[52:53] lives
[52:58] help them Lord
[53:01] may they come to know you
[53:03] and to know your grace
[53:07] and furthermore
[53:09] let us live lives
[53:12] that are worthy of the Gospel
[53:15] before them
[53:17] that they might know
[53:19] that you are real
[53:23] may God help us let us pray that we
[53:28] never take our salvation for granted
[53:33] that we never take it
[53:35] to a place
[53:37] where we belittle the sacrifice of our
[53:43] Lord Jesus Christ
[53:46] so let's come confessing our sins
[53:49] we use a modern term our mistakes
[53:53] let's come confessing our faults
[53:56] not to men like yourself not to me not
[54:00] to any man
[54:01] but to confess it to the Lord Jesus
[54:04] Christ he says when you pray go into
[54:07] your closet close the doors
[54:10] and speak to your heavenly father
[54:12] in secret
[54:14] and your father who hears in secret will
[54:18] reward you
[54:19] openly
[54:21] and as believers
[54:23] we know
[54:24] that we are a part of Elohim the Eternal
[54:28] one you may look up
[54:31] you realize that we are a part of Elohim
[54:35] the Eternal one
[54:37] he is eternal that makes the being that
[54:40] lives in this body named John Simon the
[54:43] person that's speaking to you whom you
[54:45] cannot see but you can see my body but
[54:48] you can't see me that person who speaks
[54:51] to you is a part of the Eternal
[54:56] it's not the Eternal but a part of him
[55:00] I believe I'm a chip off the old block
[55:03] uh or the old rock
[55:06] I believe certainly that I'm a part of
[55:09] that Pillar of Fire that was broken into
[55:11] small pieces and came upon the apostles
[55:14] signifying that God had broken himself
[55:16] up and placed himself within his
[55:18] children
[55:19] amen so we don't have to struggle strain
[55:23] fight to be like him amen because we are
[55:27] like him because he is in us living his
[55:30] own life through us that the world might
[55:33] see who he is by the way he works
[55:37] through the lives of his children amen
[55:40] thanks be to God aren't you happy
[55:44] I'm glad that I'm a part of him
[55:47] and we are here knowing that we are a
[55:51] part of redemption story
[55:54] for this entire Bible from beginning to
[55:58] when it winds up in glory once again
[56:02] that we are a part of the romance of
[56:06] redemption
[56:08] how the Heavenly bridegroom sought his
[56:12] bride
[56:13] amen how she fell to the Earth how sin
[56:18] came how she got lost from him and he
[56:22] never gave up on her but sent prophets
[56:25] sent Apostles sent holy men all
[56:29] five-fold Ministries to search for her
[56:32] wherever she was and to find her and
[56:37] bring her back onto himself I'm so
[56:40] thankful of God that I heard his word
[56:43] and answered the call amen may God help
[56:47] you to hear his word humble yourself
[56:50] answer the call and let the Holy Spirit
[56:53] speak to your soul to recognize the true
[56:57] from the false amen hallelujah yes sir
[57:00] we thank God that we serve a God who
[57:05] didn't just stay in the heavens
[57:07] but what
[57:10] condescension
[57:11] bringing us
[57:13] Redemption
[57:15] that in
[57:17] dead of night
[57:19] not one
[57:21] Faith Hope inside
[57:24] God gracious tender
[57:28] he laid aside his splendor
[57:33] stupid
[57:35] to win and save
[57:39] my soul let's sing it together
[57:43] oh how I love him
[57:49] how I
[57:51] adore him
[57:54] my breath my sunshine
[58:00] my all and all
[58:04] listen the great creator
[58:12] became my savior
[58:17] and all God's fullness
[58:23] well it
[58:25] in him
[58:27] down from his glory
[58:30] condescending condescending to us
[58:34] coming down from Genesis to Revelation
[58:37] coming down in the form of Melchizedek
[58:40] which was God making himself manifest
[58:43] not yet flesh but in a tiophonic state
[58:46] amen coming down appearing and
[58:50] manifesting true and in the prophets and
[58:54] then finally the fullness of his
[58:55] manifest
[58:57] manifestation in Jesus Christ
[59:00] amen and then he turns around and tells
[59:04] us that you see the Father the great
[59:08] eternal spirit is in me
[59:10] amen he is in me Hallelujah and the Dare
[59:15] will come
[59:16] just as how I and him we are the same
[59:20] person because it's just him and me it's
[59:23] him I am the Flesh on the outside the
[59:27] father manifesting himself through his
[59:29] son
[59:30] one day I'll be in you and you and me
[59:34] and I'll be doing the same thing making
[59:36] my myself manifest to the entire world
[59:41] hallelujah praise God so true this
[59:45] Lord's Supper
[59:46] we are coming into an invisible Union
[59:51] with our Lord Jesus Christ
[59:54] through this memorial service that we
[59:58] are having here today
[1:00:00] we are entering in to all what I
[1:00:04] describe as true communion of saints
[1:00:08] because as you know
[1:00:10] you don't have to be a saint to be dead
[1:00:12] I mean you don't have to be dead to be a
[1:00:15] saint
[1:00:16] because Paul wrote his letters to whom
[1:00:19] to the Saints and Ephesus to the Saints
[1:00:21] in Philippi to the Saints and wherever
[1:00:23] there were living people born again by
[1:00:27] the grace of God they were God's saints
[1:00:30] that were changed by his presence and
[1:00:33] his power and so they were so where we
[1:00:36] are here together because communion is
[1:00:39] people communing talking fellowshipping
[1:00:43] eating together and spirit with spirit
[1:00:48] will meet and there is a Confluence of
[1:00:51] thinking thoughts and ideas and the
[1:00:54] presence of almighty God just comes and
[1:00:57] and melts the whole things together
[1:00:59] making us one in him
[1:01:02] praise God so we are entering in and
[1:01:06] that's what we are in right now actually
[1:01:08] into a real communion of saints
[1:01:12] hallelujah praise God and when I say
[1:01:15] that not only you Saints who are here
[1:01:18] presence present but a communion which
[1:01:21] embodies all the Believers who have gone
[1:01:25] before us
[1:01:27] all those around the world that are
[1:01:31] having the same Lord's Supper maybe at
[1:01:34] this time or sometime during the day as
[1:01:37] we know the world's uh longitudes and
[1:01:40] latitudes causes that to happen that
[1:01:43] there may be night here and there
[1:01:45] somewhere else but we are sharing in
[1:01:48] that Union by this Supernatural and
[1:01:51] beautiful time we spend together by the
[1:01:54] grace of God hallelujah thanks be to God
[1:01:57] we also are uniting ourselves with the
[1:02:02] Believers that are to come they're not
[1:02:05] here yet but we are putting ourselves in
[1:02:08] that position by seeing the word in the
[1:02:12] same way that every True Believer will
[1:02:15] see the word we'll see Jesus Christ will
[1:02:18] acknowledge Jesus Christ will move and
[1:02:22] accept him as Lord not only a savior but
[1:02:25] as their Lord amen he saved your soul
[1:02:29] but have you surrendered for him to be
[1:02:33] your lord does he have preeminence
[1:02:36] within your life or are you just
[1:02:39] rejoicing in the fact I'm saved I'm
[1:02:42] saved I'm saved but you allow him in the
[1:02:46] living room where you allow your
[1:02:49] visitors but you won't allow him in the
[1:02:51] kitchen
[1:02:52] in the bedroom you want to allow him in
[1:02:55] all the private parts of your home but
[1:02:57] what I'm saying is we must be open to
[1:03:00] the grace of God and let the Lord Jesus
[1:03:03] Come into our lives every part of our
[1:03:07] Lives not a part of our thoughts our
[1:03:10] actions activities should be hidden from
[1:03:12] him
[1:03:13] because he's not going to tell somebody
[1:03:15] else he just go talk to him quietly
[1:03:19] believe you me you'll be surprised at
[1:03:22] what our God can do blessed be the name
[1:03:25] of the Lord hallelujah amen so let's
[1:03:29] join with the sense who have gone the
[1:03:31] Saints who are here and the Saints who
[1:03:34] are to come and say father make us one
[1:03:38] just like you are one in Jesus amen and
[1:03:43] Jesus himself said in that day
[1:03:46] you shall know that I'm in the Father
[1:03:49] the father and me and I in you praise
[1:03:52] God what day is that this day you will
[1:03:55] know thank God and for those of us who
[1:03:59] know confidently and by the spiritual
[1:04:02] recognition what God has done amen then
[1:04:06] we can say it's beautiful and wonderful
[1:04:09] this is a beautiful moment
[1:04:12] this is a wonderful time
[1:04:14] when we come and sit like this in the
[1:04:17] presence of the Living God other people
[1:04:19] may look on it as oh they just come to
[1:04:22] church but we just don't come to church
[1:04:25] to meet each other only we come to meet
[1:04:29] with an unseen being
[1:04:32] we come to meet with the person of Jesus
[1:04:35] Christ
[1:04:36] and wherever he is that is where we want
[1:04:41] to be because we are his children and
[1:04:45] not only that we love to be around our
[1:04:47] father we love to be in that influence
[1:04:50] of the Holy Spirit or the Living God
[1:04:53] that who saturates our soul amen praise
[1:04:57] God what a wonderful moment when he
[1:05:01] reunites himself with the bride of Jesus
[1:05:04] Christ when him and his bride can sit
[1:05:07] there talk and commune and communicate
[1:05:10] as a husband what with his wife talking
[1:05:13] back and forth and and uh relishing and
[1:05:17] enjoying each other's presence isn't
[1:05:19] that wonderful
[1:05:20] enjoying that wonderful presence after
[1:05:23] all people I said well they said you
[1:05:26] know uh I said look I've had one
[1:05:28] girlfriend all my life he said who is
[1:05:31] that I said well my wife she's always
[1:05:33] been my girlfriend until this hour she's
[1:05:36] still my girlfriend praise God Amen and
[1:05:39] sometimes I try to treat her that when
[1:05:41] she thinks it's a little much now come
[1:05:43] on so I just gotta watch that praise God
[1:05:47] but the fact is that is the case amen
[1:05:51] praise God and the Lord Jesus Christ has
[1:05:54] only one bride
[1:05:56] only one bride and she is universal
[1:06:00] amen and she doesn't belong to this
[1:06:03] church and that church over there in the
[1:06:05] other church over there and the others
[1:06:07] no she is everywhere
[1:06:10] but the main thing is she must know who
[1:06:13] her husband is
[1:06:15] that he is not an institution he's not a
[1:06:17] person he's not a office of a bishopric
[1:06:20] or a this or a pastor or a
[1:06:23] superintendent those are wonderful
[1:06:25] offices but the person whom we are here
[1:06:28] to love and serve with all our heart is
[1:06:32] the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah God

[1:07:31] our minds and put our faith in him for
[1:07:35] he is the one that died for our sins
[1:07:37] rose again for our justification coming
[1:07:41] again in a Rapture to take us away from

[1:07:55] times I've been into Israel but uh there

[1:08:07] of this congregation was there with me
[1:08:10] uh also while we were there praise God
[1:08:14] and we found friends that uh it was a
[1:08:19] wonderful time to have a communion
[1:08:21] service
[1:08:22] because everything was there before you
[1:08:25] the garden was there you know the garden
[1:08:27] was there the empty tomb was there with
[1:08:30] the stone rolled back from it was there
[1:08:33] and uh they have a little facilities uh
[1:08:38] that are there where one can go and have
[1:08:41] a simple communion service just to
[1:08:44] commemorate what happened up there on
[1:08:47] golgotha's Hill oh praise God so we had
[1:08:52] a very short communion service there uh

[1:09:23] brought that cook back with me just a
[1:09:26] little cup in which they placed the wine
[1:09:29] and
[1:09:30] we just began to sing and praise God
[1:09:34] as we sang and praise God a very simple
[1:09:38] uh
[1:09:39] sacred and memorable moment settled down

[1:10:02] out of olive wood from there in
[1:10:06] Israel what a sacred time
[1:10:09] what a memorable times we had moments
[1:10:13] together with the prayer in the presence
[1:10:15] of the Living God it was beautiful
[1:10:18] beautiful to me and uh I tell you but
[1:10:21] it's not the place really that made it
[1:10:24] uh beautiful to me
[1:10:27] not where all of this was happening that
[1:10:32] made it really uh beautiful to me
[1:10:36] but regardless of what Satan has done
[1:10:40] through the years Through the Ages on
[1:10:42] the Church of the Living a living God
[1:10:45] since the Lord Jesus instituted this
[1:10:49] observance in remembrance he said do
[1:10:53] this in remembrance of me this is not a
[1:10:56] request this is a sacred mandate from
[1:11:00] the presence of almighty God that we are
[1:11:03] to do this in remembrance of him and
[1:11:07] since that time Satan has not been able
[1:11:09] to stop it
[1:11:10] he's not been able to stop people from
[1:11:13] having the Lord's Supper
[1:11:15] he has not been able to obstruct people
[1:11:18] from participating in this great
[1:11:21] wonderful institution amen because
[1:11:25] friends the Lord's Supper has continued
[1:11:28] to be practiced and to take place in
[1:11:33] every Church age since the time of the
[1:11:36] Lord Jesus Christ amen and it's also
[1:11:40] took place on the different
[1:11:41] circumstances
[1:11:43] we are here today we left our homes we
[1:11:47] drove them cars we came here and now we
[1:11:50] sit we are here in the word of God it
[1:11:53] was never like that all the time
[1:11:55] now when we say we're Christian it
[1:11:59] brings a certain amount of pride to some
[1:12:01] people that I am a Christian uh like
[1:12:05] that but if you understand the word
[1:12:07] Christian those cross-backed ones uh you
[1:12:12] know thinking of Jesus carrying the
[1:12:15] cross and uh when you were called a
[1:12:18] Christian they were Christians were on
[1:12:21] The Wanted list of the synagogues the
[1:12:26] rabbis the Pharisees the Sadducees the
[1:12:29] epicureans the stoics and the various
[1:12:32] groups that were there at that time they
[1:12:36] were on the lookout for them because
[1:12:39] they were following this man who claims
[1:12:42] to be the Messiah fire and there in Rome
[1:12:46] I went into the catacombs they had told
[1:12:50] as the scripture itself says in Hebrews
[1:12:52] 11. they they had to hide in dance their
[1:12:57] hidden caves they hid in all broken
[1:13:01] homes
[1:13:02] they're worshiped on the trees they did
[1:13:05] not have beautiful uh Cathedrals
[1:13:09] churches uh lovely buildings uh and
[1:13:13] stuff of that nature some of them
[1:13:15] worshiped in the woods wherever they
[1:13:17] could find it but no matter the
[1:13:20] persecution no matter their debts in the
[1:13:24] Roman Coliseum no matter what happened
[1:13:27] the devil could not stamp out this
[1:13:30] institution and we are here as a
[1:13:34] testimony of the grace of almighty God
[1:13:36] that he received us with open arms and
[1:13:40] Grant to us that he died for our sins oh
[1:13:44] praise God forevermore amen yes sir and
[1:13:48] it has been going on Amen amongst
[1:13:51] various peoples
[1:13:53] there's not a race on Earth you can put
[1:13:57] claim Jesus died for us he didn't die
[1:14:00] for you he didn't die for this person
[1:14:03] die die for the other person because
[1:14:05] they're Chinese they're black they're
[1:14:07] white they're Japanese they're whatever
[1:14:09] God doesn't care about that amen amen
[1:14:13] his blood was shed For All Mankind amen
[1:14:16] and we are thankful to God we are one in
[1:14:19] that by the grace of God
[1:14:22] hallelujah amen we are the sons and
[1:14:26] daughters of God Amen and I'm glad for
[1:14:29] the skin that he put me in I don't know
[1:14:31] about you but I give him praise and
[1:14:33] honor and Glory he knows his reason and
[1:14:37] his purpose of why he did that amen and
[1:14:41] from the time Jesus instituted this it
[1:14:44] has been in practice until this time for
[1:14:48] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:14:51] against the Church of the Living God
[1:14:53] he's not being able to stop him it's
[1:14:56] still going on and he'll still go on
[1:14:58] after we are gone from here he'll still
[1:15:01] be going on Amen yes sir there is much
[1:15:05] Beauty in thinking of how Jesus suffered
[1:15:09] and died for our sins amen and there is
[1:15:13] still power and Beauty in our testimony
[1:15:17] when we overcome Satan and we tell him
[1:15:20] what he's done for us and overcome him
[1:15:23] by the word of God and by the blood of
[1:15:27] Jesus Christ amen our testimony and the
[1:15:30] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:15:33] praise God now be no communion is at the
[1:15:36] heart
[1:15:37] of what it means to be a True Believer
[1:15:42] if you're a True Believer you will want
[1:15:44] to take the Lord's Supper
[1:15:47] and there is no reason for any of us not
[1:15:51] to take the Lord's Supper because the
[1:15:53] Bible says even if you think you sin let
[1:15:57] a man or woman a person examine
[1:16:00] themselves
[1:16:01] do an accounting in your own life
[1:16:04] you're comfortable for yourself nobody
[1:16:07] else is accountable for you in other
[1:16:09] words I can't stand here and say oh you
[1:16:12] are saved and you are I can't do that I
[1:16:14] don't know who God knows that so we
[1:16:17] can't point fingers at anybody we that's
[1:16:20] why Paul said make your calling and your
[1:16:24] election sure make sure that that your
[1:16:28] salvation amen is what God wants it to
[1:16:32] be amen praise the name of the Lord so
[1:16:35] in the heart of every believer we have
[1:16:39] this confidence and faith in God
[1:16:42] of what it means to us amen praise God
[1:16:46] and in the life of this church as in any
[1:16:49] church it is a beautiful and sacred
[1:16:53] moment
[1:16:55] that we all should partake of and
[1:16:58] partake in because we can confess our
[1:17:02] faults
[1:17:03] amen we can cleanse ourselves from sin
[1:17:08] and we can let God have his way within
[1:17:11] our hearts and life so there's no excuse
[1:17:14] not to partake in of the Lord's Supper
[1:17:18] that he has given to us amen I don't
[1:17:22] know but it's hard to find a more
[1:17:24] powerful
[1:17:26] sacred moment
[1:17:28] than having a real lord supper and the
[1:17:33] memories thoughts that goes with it when
[1:17:36] I begin to think that on a hill far away
[1:17:39] there stood an Old Rugged Cross when I
[1:17:43] begin to think that there is still Power
[1:17:46] in the Blood when I begin to think on
[1:17:49] these things and what he has done for me
[1:17:52] I give him praise listen since I was a
[1:17:55] child I know the grace of God I stood on
[1:17:58] the corner of a street corner there was
[1:18:01] a turn standing there as on an Easter
[1:18:04] day like it might be today but as small
[1:18:09] as a man as I am now just imagine when I
[1:18:11] was 10 years old and I'm carrying a big
[1:18:14] kite
[1:18:16] and the wind just comes and blows the
[1:18:19] kite and I'm holding on to it for dear
[1:18:21] life you're not thinking that it's
[1:18:23] better to lose the kite and keep your
[1:18:24] life you you want to save your kite Soul
[1:18:27] Wind Blows the kite and when it blows
[1:18:30] the kite all of a sudden it blew me over
[1:18:34] and I was already on an incline and
[1:18:38] there right there was a moving car I'm
[1:18:42] seeing that in the instant oh my
[1:18:46] um while that was going on and I'm
[1:18:48] falling I felt a gust of wind go like
[1:18:50] that and I'm back on my feet holding the
[1:18:54] kite
[1:18:55] and I wondered what was that oh you
[1:18:59] can't just get back when you're already
[1:19:02] falling like that what was that another
[1:19:05] time this was another Easter I uh some
[1:19:08] relatives of mine had a great a big
[1:19:11] mechanic shop not mechanic machine shop
[1:19:14] where they were turning parts and stuff
[1:19:16] like that and uh my kite and the tail
[1:19:20] went around one of the power wires that
[1:19:23] went to serve service their shop send
[1:19:26] the current you can guess that was a
[1:19:28] high powered line
[1:19:30] but little boys you know
[1:19:32] you just climb up on the roof where they
[1:19:35] can't see you when you're doing it and
[1:19:37] get up there and you know place my hand
[1:19:41] to pull that line of the tail of the
[1:19:44] kite off in the moment I put my hand
[1:19:47] like that
[1:19:49] my and right then
[1:19:53] I felt another arm
[1:19:58] take my hand off
[1:20:00] I'm still what is that hey man well now
[1:20:05] I know but what was that but that's what
[1:20:09] I'm telling you when you look back on
[1:20:11] your own life some of you sitting there
[1:20:13] should have been already dead
[1:20:16] but you're here by the grace of God
[1:20:23] so many things could have happened but
[1:20:26] God brought us through what was he doing
[1:20:28] he was protecting his own because he
[1:20:32] knows his children there are billions of
[1:20:34] people in this world but he chose us out
[1:20:36] like one in a million and brought us to
[1:20:39] himself that we might know him
[1:20:42] not only as the written word but to know
[1:20:46] him in the power of his resurrection
[1:20:49] amen you've seen the Lord when he is
[1:20:52] alive and walking like that but have you
[1:20:54] seen him since he's risen
[1:20:57] only a few were allowed to see him since
[1:21:00] he has risen done to experience his
[1:21:03] presence within their hearts and lives
[1:21:06] amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:08] hallelujah yes sir oh my friends the
[1:21:12] Lord shared with us the Lord's supper
[1:21:15] and you know when he did it
[1:21:18] he did it exactly at the Passover time
[1:21:23] it was a time of Passover as it is right
[1:21:26] now we say Passover for the Jews we say
[1:21:29] Easter for the Christians and and then I
[1:21:32] think it's Ramadan or something like
[1:21:34] that for the for the Muslims like that
[1:21:37] when he did it he did it right at the
[1:21:40] Passover time you see he was letting
[1:21:44] them know that he is now bringing
[1:21:47] fulfillment
[1:21:49] and that all the types all the Shadows
[1:21:54] all the substitutes that were there
[1:21:57] substitute the Lambs the Bullocks the
[1:22:00] goats the pigeons the dogs that were
[1:22:03] being sacrificed were all symbols and
[1:22:07] types that were pointing to the day when
[1:22:11] the true lamb not the symbol you see
[1:22:15] there's a difference between the shadow
[1:22:17] on the wall and the hand that's caught
[1:22:21] making the shadow now the real thing has
[1:22:25] arrived
[1:22:26] and the real thing you know ought to put
[1:22:29] away your substitute put away your your
[1:22:32] lambs and stuff of that nature because
[1:22:35] here comes the true lamb Behold the Lamb
[1:22:38] of God that taketh away the sins of the
[1:22:41] world not the sins of just the
[1:22:43] individual but the sins of the entire
[1:22:46] world is taken away by the true lamb of
[1:22:49] the Living God and brings us into the
[1:22:52] reality of the Fulfillment of what is
[1:22:55] the Jewish Passover of course that has
[1:23:00] been practiced
[1:23:02] and observed by the Jewish people uh
[1:23:07] down through hundreds and hundreds of
[1:23:09] years they have been keeping the
[1:23:12] Passover because the Passover was to let
[1:23:18] them remember
[1:23:19] that they were brought out of slavery
[1:23:23] they were brought out from Egypt with
[1:23:26] the gods Mighty hand of True Blood and
[1:23:31] power with pills of fire and a pillar of
[1:23:34] smoke bringing them out by his mighty
[1:23:37] hand and so God wanted them to relive
[1:23:41] that and to remember that Jesus is using
[1:23:46] the same thing and saying just like that
[1:23:49] remember me
[1:23:52] till I come again
[1:23:54] yes sir I go to Calvary die as the
[1:23:59] genuine Lamb of God Amen but don't you
[1:24:03] forget remember what happened here
[1:24:07] remember what I did for you the blood of
[1:24:11] lambs could not take away the sins of
[1:24:14] the worshipers at that time for as the
[1:24:17] Bible says they have to go back every
[1:24:19] year to Jerusalem to go and confess and
[1:24:23] be washed in the cleansing oh praise God
[1:24:26] but once you come to this blood of Jesus
[1:24:30] Christ this faith of Jesus Christ once
[1:24:33] washed you are washed forever you are
[1:24:36] washed for all time you are Washed by
[1:24:38] the grace of God Amen praise this
[1:24:41] wonderful name amen hallelujah amen yes
[1:24:45] sir I tell you it's wonderful to know
[1:24:48] this Hallelujah and so God always said
[1:24:53] I am the Lord who brought you out of
[1:24:56] Egypt amen always reminding them I am
[1:25:00] the one who brought you out of slavery
[1:25:02] out of bondage would be the word you
[1:25:05] will read in the Bible I brought you out
[1:25:07] of bondage and I now brought you into
[1:25:10] freedom and liberty I'm the one who
[1:25:13] brought you out yes sir praise God
[1:25:16] hallelujah so Jesus was telling them I
[1:25:20] am the one who brings you out into not
[1:25:24] from natural slavery but spiritual
[1:25:27] slavery I brought you out from all the
[1:25:30] things that you were wrapped up in
[1:25:32] praise God brought you into safety and
[1:25:35] reality and a recognition of who you
[1:25:39] really are amen hallelujah now we know
[1:25:43] the Passover
[1:25:46] and look at the word Passover
[1:25:49] he says
[1:25:51] Moses tell them take the blood
[1:25:54] painted on the door
[1:25:57] and when
[1:25:58] I see the blood
[1:26:00] I will pass over you
[1:26:03] everyone else that doesn't have that
[1:26:05] blood on their door he says I'll let the
[1:26:08] dead Angel wipe every one of the
[1:26:11] firstborn of Egypt out amen well now
[1:26:15] it's not a door like that where you can
[1:26:18] go paint some blood on it but it's the
[1:26:21] door of your heart
[1:26:22] is all right and when I see the blood
[1:26:25] not somebody else tells you it's there
[1:26:28] or somebody else tells you you're okay
[1:26:31] no when God sees the blood
[1:26:35] amen you know the song praise God I
[1:26:39] think I'm going to sing again when I
[1:26:43] see the blood
[1:26:46] when I
[1:26:48] see the blood let's sing
[1:26:51] when I
[1:26:54] see the blood
[1:26:57] I will pass
[1:26:59] pass over you
[1:27:04] a redeemer died on the cross
[1:27:09] died for The Sinner paid all his Jews
[1:27:15] pray call your soul blood of the Lamb
[1:27:21] and I will pass I will pass over you
[1:27:27] oh where I when I
[1:27:31] see the blood
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:34] when I
[1:27:37] see the blood
[1:27:42] Singapore Hallelujah
[1:27:44] [Music]
[1:27:50] amen hallelujah praise God you are saved
[1:27:55] today because the dead Angel the angel
[1:27:58] of death spiritual death has passed over
[1:28:02] you God overlooked you he passed over
[1:28:06] all your sins and that is why several
[1:28:09] years ago I preached the message that
[1:28:10] the Passover and mentioned that not only
[1:28:13] did God pass over us he expects us to
[1:28:17] look at others
[1:28:18] see their mistakes you actually know
[1:28:22] they're in the wrong and yet you're
[1:28:25] called upon
[1:28:26] to pass over
[1:28:29] give that person a chance as we would
[1:28:32] say to pull their socks up
[1:28:34] and go on with the lies don't be too
[1:28:39] anxious I see this I see that I see you
[1:28:42] you know you'll see all kinds of things
[1:28:44] but what reaction does God want you to
[1:28:46] have God wants you to be christ-like
[1:28:50] he is seeing all the evil in the world
[1:28:52] but he's not sent a fire and burned the
[1:28:54] whole thing out the time will come when
[1:28:56] that will happen after every person has
[1:28:59] had their opportunity and didn't take it
[1:29:01] then he'll be able to say every one of
[1:29:04] you had an opportunity you never took it
[1:29:07] and so you literally force me now that I
[1:29:11] have to do this okay but the point of it
[1:29:14] is we have got to learn how to overlook
[1:29:16] one another's faults and failures
[1:29:19] sometimes it's very aggravating I know
[1:29:22] you're not going to say Amen
[1:29:26] you're not going to say it because they
[1:29:28] identify yourself that maybe something
[1:29:30] or whatever but the fact is sometimes
[1:29:33] it's so aggravating you don't know how
[1:29:36] you can take it you know you got the
[1:29:39] slap on One Cheek you don't know if you
[1:29:41] got the the temperance the godliness the
[1:29:44] broadly kindness to turn the other I
[1:29:46] don't mean literally you're going to be
[1:29:47] doing that every time like that but it's
[1:29:50] mainly telling you learn how and when to
[1:29:54] overlook the false failures and mistakes
[1:29:57] of others
[1:29:58] and don't be very quick to point fingers
[1:30:02] or As we judge
[1:30:04] but then he says but if you judge then
[1:30:07] you know the word of God in you with the
[1:30:10] grace of God Paul said even if you do he
[1:30:13] said speak the truth to people but don't
[1:30:16] speak it with the uh intent to to hurt
[1:30:21] speak the truth in love
[1:30:24] speak the truth with the grace of God
[1:30:26] Amen you want to hear any more of this
[1:30:29] you know I don't want you to uh you know
[1:30:33] go off and I'm talking but it's still
[1:30:36] not mean anything much to you here
[1:30:38] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:30:40] amen praise His wonderful name
[1:30:44] so we find out that only the Lord Jesus
[1:30:48] Christ
[1:30:49] could truly pass over us
[1:30:52] and bring us the way we are and I love
[1:30:55] the fact and I can testify to it he
[1:30:58] brought me out of the myri clay
[1:31:01] and place my feet on a rock to stay amen
[1:31:05] I give him praise today and I thank him
[1:31:07] for it but he brought me out to the
[1:31:09] marriage place
[1:31:13] amen so we have this command of God that
[1:31:17] we should keep these this great
[1:31:20] institution not only uh the Lord's
[1:31:22] Supper but you know water baptism is
[1:31:26] also another institution that God has
[1:31:29] given to us that we should keep right
[1:31:32] it's actually a command he didn't ask
[1:31:34] you to do it he's telling you if you're
[1:31:36] a real believer you ought to do it so
[1:31:39] praise God if you're not baptized you
[1:31:40] need to be baptized amen baptized in
[1:31:43] water in the name of the Lord and Savior
[1:31:46] Jesus Christ hallelujah amen just praise
[1:31:50] God forevermore now let's begin to
[1:31:53] prepare hearts for the Lord's Supper
[1:31:56] and the Bible tells us that when we come
[1:32:01] to do the Lord's Supper First
[1:32:03] Corinthians 11 tells us clearly on the
[1:32:06] night the Lord that was betrayed
[1:32:10] amen Paul said he spoke reveal himself
[1:32:13] to me and he said on that night and he
[1:32:17] repeats to him what he told the
[1:32:19] disciples in that room in the scripture
[1:32:23] if you'll put it back up Matthew 26
[1:32:27] 26-30 amen and as they were eating Jesus
[1:32:32] Took bread blessed it break it and gave
[1:32:36] it to the disciples take eat this is my
[1:32:40] body
[1:32:41] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[1:32:45] gave it to them saying drink ye all of
[1:32:48] it praise the name of the Lord I want
[1:32:50] for us I would love for us to just bar
[1:32:54] heads where we are while the musicians
[1:32:57] play
[1:32:58] quietly
[1:33:00] in the background
[1:33:03] songs like search me oh God
[1:33:07] songs like I surrender all
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:15] search me o God
[1:33:20] and no
[1:33:22] my heart
[1:33:24] today
[1:33:27] trying
[1:33:29] me
[1:33:31] oh

[1:49:41] verse 5 but he was wounded for our
[1:49:45] transgressions
[1:49:47] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:49:51] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:49:54] him
[1:49:55] and with his stripes
[1:49:57] we are healed
[1:50:00] did you hear that
[1:50:02] with his stripes we are healed

[1:50:21] our sins
[1:50:22] amen the chastisement of our peace was
[1:50:27] upon him

[1:51:28] as Wilma Cooper the songwriter says
[1:51:32] while they were walking my Lord up
[1:51:35] calvary's hill
[1:51:36] as they walked him up the hill they were
[1:51:39] whipping him
[1:51:41] bruising him and the blood flowed freely
[1:51:45] down from him amen yes sir oh we
[1:51:51] remember also by taking this bread his
[1:51:54] crucifixion
[1:51:56] the sudden of the Hammer as they drove
[1:51:59] the nails in his hands in his feet and
[1:52:05] the spear within his side they nailed
[1:52:09] him to the Cross Hallelujah we remember
[1:52:11] his death and how he died and on Sunday
[1:52:15] we will speak about him when he rose
[1:52:17] again is that right

[1:52:25] justification and he's coming again to
[1:52:28] take us out of here by his Divine Mercy

[1:53:15] whatever I might have done or said

[1:53:31] within your heart and life amen praise
[1:53:36] God

[1:53:51] our own sins
[1:53:52] our own crimes we are supposed to be
[1:53:55] judged for the things we have done
[1:53:59] but he says no father I'll take their
[1:54:02] place
[1:54:03] and he took my place at Calvary that's
[1:54:06] what it is all about he took my place
[1:54:09] your place at Calvary you're the one
[1:54:13] that should be wounded you're the one
[1:54:15] that should have been whipped you're the

[1:59:36] cleansing part you say brother Simon we
[1:59:38] are supposed to have a a wonderful
[1:59:41] healing service whether it's been going
[1:59:43] on all the time and if you were
[1:59:45] believing God God would have been
[1:59:47] delivering you all the time and
[1:59:49] cleansing you however we will have a a
[1:59:52] closing Prayer of Healing For You by the
[1:59:55] grace of God
[1:59:57] do you want that
[1:59:59] amen we certainly have that here by the
[2:00:03] grace of God thank you Lord hallelujah
[2:00:05] amen so let us drink the cup
[2:00:13] I almost got you believing I forgot
[2:00:19] I don't want to drink all of it
[2:00:22] I want you to drink it
[2:00:25] uh I I think I told the brothers this is
[2:00:28] just funny a young Minister was telling
[2:00:30] me that his daddy they had the Lord's
[2:00:33] supper and they left over a lot of wine
[2:00:35] in a cup
[2:00:40] and his daddy decided to drink it
[2:00:43] and five minutes later he's up on the
[2:00:45] platform like I am now
[2:00:48] and suddenly he said you asked me why
[2:00:50] I'm happy
[2:00:53] I'll tell you the reason why
[2:00:56] my sins are gone
[2:00:59] and of course they had to take him off
[2:01:01] of there and carrying home because he
[2:01:04] just drank too much of the communion
[2:01:06] wine well we don't want to do that here
[2:01:08] tonight but I don't mind having more of
[2:01:11] the Holy Spirit
[2:01:12] upon my heart and life thank God as I
[2:01:16] close that without him we have no
[2:01:19] peace
[2:01:21] without him we have no hope
[2:01:24] and without him we have no future
[2:01:28] for there is no future for us as
[2:01:31] Believers but the coming of the Lord
[2:01:33] Jesus Christ
[2:01:35] he is the one that brings us out of
[2:01:38] everything else and places where we we
[2:01:42] should be amen thank God and now here we
[2:01:46] are we are on our way to heaven and
[2:01:49] we're Shelton victory
[2:01:52] amen amen I don't know about you but I'm
[2:01:55] shouting victory
[2:01:56] my sins are gone
[2:01:59] so my sins are gone
[2:02:01] my sins are gone
[2:02:03] praise the Lord my sins are gone and I
[2:02:07] thank God that my sins are gone now I
[2:02:10] don't want to get into teaching because
[2:02:12] my sins are gone I praise the Lord
[2:02:15] doesn't mean you're not going to make
[2:02:16] mistakes
[2:02:17] right we're still in this human body and
[2:02:21] the sticky nature that goes with this
[2:02:23] body you're still going to make mistakes
[2:02:25] but if you sin the Apostle says if you
[2:02:30] sin so he knew that we would still make
[2:02:33] mistakes even after we are born again
[2:02:35] right you have Jesus Christ who is an
[2:02:39] advocate he's our mediator and his blood
[2:02:43] cleanses us from all sin not some sins
[2:02:47] but from all sins oh but mine's too big
[2:02:51] no he said all oh I said oh mine I never
[2:02:55] heard of a situation like my situation
[2:02:57] no he said all his blood is able to
[2:03:01] cleanse us from all sin praise the Lord
[2:03:06] he was wounded
[2:03:09] for our transgression
