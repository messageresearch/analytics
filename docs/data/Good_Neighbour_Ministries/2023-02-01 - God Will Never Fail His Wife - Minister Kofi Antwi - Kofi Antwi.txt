gonna go to Ephesians chapter one verse one one two seven an Ephesians chapter 2 four to five and the title will be on the board so every one of you will know the title brother name please can you lead us in prayer as we go straight to the word yes Lord amen chapter 1 Ephesians 1 to 7 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the sins which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and our father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that he should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the place Praises of the glory of his grace wherein he had made as accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood dead forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace chapter 2. verse 4 and 5. but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where where he loves even when we were dead in sin had quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved may the Lord add his Blessing every one of you please be seated if I didn't pronounce the sentence to God please forgive me I am not a big reader even my reading is coming by God's grace he is protecting me and leading me I don't know why even I'm standing here but it's all in is for His glory and honor Paul was a man that we all knew he prosecuted the Church of God but God's grace came to him and one Grace came to Paul believe me Paul did a lot of God work Grace was upon Paul even though the man taught one point God came to him and says my grace is sufficient for thee the bride are this hour I'm hearing some wrinkle on the uh the thing there are some small things so please help me to lower it up the bride for this hour God come fail us because there's one thing sorry I forgot about the song but when I'm finishing you're gonna put it God's grace is giving to us that no matter how we think or no matter Where We Are his grace is always upon us his grace is gonna carry us through it's not law anybody preaching law is up the mark it's all about Grace at this hour God is telling his bride you even while you were yet sinner God Spirit was upon you because he chose you before the foundations of God before the foundations of the world and the children of God has not sin because of the seed of God when the serpent thought he has seduced if so he has captured all God's seed now I finish all of them that are on the head but what he didn't know was it was God's plan it was gonna show Grace it was bringing Grace to You and I and bringing Grace to All God's Children because Abraham if you look Abraham lied Moses killed Egyptian David commit adultery Mary Magdalene commit adultery I have five men and even the one he was living wasn't his husband he was committing what adultery but what the devil failed to recognize many attacks even when we came to the message when God brought us from the world we look like who is sitting here most of us we used to look like grasshoppers we were like nobody but what the devil didn't know most of all the time God there was no Beauty when he came to the world to desire of him so God hide himself through his children and sometimes when they come everybody can push them around this way that way this way that way why they may doing why they are doing that what they are doing is there's no Beauty to desire of him God hiding himself in Simplicity reveal himself in Simplicity and today you and I God has taken our heart the seed that was in us and show us all that was in God eternity things God has poured into us at this hour through the faithful Ministry through Pastor Simon he has pour all the eternity things that the world before the foundations of this world pays that God hid to himself at this hour he has let all those things come down to his wife and it is you and I that God has done that too his grace has come upon you God cannot fail you he is real let me tell you how God is real no matter what you think you are let me tell you you are God Apple I you are the beauty of God Apple I because he loved you so much never mind your flesh the mistakes don't mean nothing because you know what that's what the devil does look at the woman of the world when you Jesus met her at the evening the reason why he met her at the evening that woman couldn't go there early in the morning or early in the afternoon because the people will laugh at her she was a prostitute so they would speak against her look at the prostitute woman you are prostitute you look so ugly you sleeping with every man very mothering the same thing right but the seed of God was lying down in her heart the devil has poured mud upon her so that everybody will push her around push her around but deep down in her heart was the seed of God and so is you one time you were living in the world in the mud the seed of God was laying down in you that people don't recognize that you that was working you are the seed of God hidden in flesh but now by the grace of God God has pulled that seed out every month that the seed was hidden is now pushed has pushed out for you to know yourself that you are not just a woman being coming here die and go and just finish but you are the seed of God you are the bride of Christ you are born of his born flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit you are Eternal as God is his Turner he created you as his spirit is you came from him you are flesh of his flesh born of his bone now you know who you are walk with not sadness walk would high up that you know who you are no matter what come against you God is able to take you through he says my grace is sufficient for me my grace is sufficient for thee who is he that gonna condemn you who can condemn God's seed When God says you are pure you are pure When God Says You Are Holy You Are Holy When God says I love you I love you more than what you think never mind what you see yourself I am the one that has brought you here I am the one that is speaking to you I am the one that led the children of Israel when I chose my servant Moses to lead the children of Israel anybody that speak against him I won't I deal with him I chose Joshua Caleb to go into the promised land because they have the spirit of God in them the seed of God and so is this hour anybody that I chose nobody Point her finger nobody talk against them because my sheep know my voice my sheep is my children my sheep I share my blood for my sheep and my own they will come to me I will discipline them I will show them the way I will direct them let me tell you God never failed his grace look at the Bible Moses a murderer and yet he went to pharaoh let my people go who do you think was that poor killed allowed them to kill Steven and yet Paul come the whole of mostly all the New Testament Paul wrote it Paul wrote it why the grace of God the grace abundance to Paul abundance to bosses Peter Electric couldn't read and write John and yet the grace of God goes to them what do you think it was it was the seed of God in that it's not how educated you are may God choose your uneducated may God choose you is God perfect will by his own election he elected you and place you in him now he has put you in flesh you are the one that fulfilling the scripture the scripture is you what do you think is Irish is somebody coming no the Bible says the spirit of Jesus Christ the spirit of the Bride are one and it's you if you don't know yourself I am seeing the pill of fire sitting sitting here in the bodies what do you think it is it's God in the beginning was what the word and the Word was what with God and the word made what flesh when the word made flesh who do you think this is your hour this is your time don't estimate yourself because what has happened is people has used legalistic to bind even in the message bind the people legalistics bind the people all the prophet was preaching for the bride was Grace great great grace that message was three class of people make unbeliever make believer and Believer by the True Believer and the wife of Christ so your passion is what Grace Grace you recognize Who You Are and you walk in the word and the Lord will lead you every step you take there is Grace for you that's why God says while you were yet sinner you read the scripture let me read it again for you to see Ephesians 1. he says according as he has chosen Us in him in him before the foundations of the world that we should we should be holy and without blemish before him in love having predestinated us unto adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto himself so God has predestinated you it's not your father did it is not even good never did it is Jesus Christ that did it that's why you you can't give this salvation to your children a lot of them think this message is a Muslim Muhammad the father put his head Allah then the child come Allah Allah this is genuine Christian and God says I will have mercy upon whom I will have it whom I don't want it I'm hitting it to be in the back I'll take one I will leave one we can't give it to our children we'll pray for them we'll bring them to church if there is elect and the seed of God once the word hit it I don't care what more the devil has done for putting on their flesh once the word hit it you will see every mod have to move out of the way that seed is Gonna Shine when Jesus spoke to Mary madarian says go home and see no more do you find the scripture where Mary mothering was committing adultery again do you find the scripture where the Samaritan woman have five men after meeting Jesus and going and and committing that act again no because as soon as the word come and spoken to them that seed open when that seed open let me tell you God's children are ego I was watching some eagle he was way up and he saw snake cobra and the eagle fly sometimes I love that nature he fly he didn't just come and kill the snake he just used one of his leg hit the snake bottom the the tail like the tail and that snake just rise up like that and the eagle was watching now in other words he's telling that snake shut up I'm gonna destroy you all right and the snake rise up like that and Eagle just use the another leg on his neck like this and he started to eat him in flesh that's how God's children are we are not made as chickens we are made as Eagles and eagles eat what flesh that's why the scripture says where the characters we got it the flesh word of God is what the eagles eat God sent us a prophet William Brown since this 20th century there's never been a prophet that has come on this earth like William Brown let me tell you the man spoke when you listen to the his messages his the wave he present the way let me tell you if this is not Christ in a man I don't know a prophet I don't know no prophet I don't know no prophet he was the man that's why the world hate him the word of the religious world doesn't like him but even all those that accuse him whether they like it or not they're going to see the prophecy come to pass everything he speaks that Los Angeles will go under the sea once he says does fear the lord is coming that's how you're going to be because spoken word is the Original Seed now the spoken word is in God's wife we are what William Brown was preaching we are here if you don't know who you are for me I know who I am I am one that William Abraham was speaking I'm here now tomorrow I will come not future I'll come here you are here so take authority over the world the word that God has given to you hold it Don't Put It Down because God is able to do what he says he will do his grace cover you his grace protects you it was grace that brought them out of Egypt to the Israel where they are now and his grace that will take us home it's not by law it's not by legalistic it's not by religious entertainment is not by how much you know how much you don't know or this all you need to do is Lord I don't know whatever you want me to do I am willing to do whether he says sleep here you sleep wake up you wake up walk you walk don't talk you don't talk speak then you speak that is the way God is asking his bride be who you are what you are not let me tell you the truth if he doesn't open my mind to speak me you will see the biggest dummy person you'll ever find but I don't trust myself I trust him if he can do it I can't that's why I don't know why you're gonna get me some coffee I'm bringing you down here you think I miss perfect I see Pastor Simon I see the way preachers go through even to stand in the prophet sometimes you stand here you're going tries brother Danny will tell you the wife will know it's not something Pastor Simon has gone through a lot a lot of things preachers who speak against you when you become a preacher let's pray for our pastor let's pray for his children all the time pray for the deacons it's not dark to be a leader they criticize you I know you said brother coffee how do you know I know I know how leaders sometimes they are crying behind the scene but God when he chose he chose you you can't do nothing you can't run away you can't do whatever they you want you have to say Lord not my will that I will be done Jesus even while he was in the flesh says father if this cup if it have to pass let it pass but not my will but I will because he wants the father's will so let us as believers as Brothers and Sisters in Christ let us therefore surrender ourselves to him that not our will because we women beings have Earthly will your mother wants you to become like this your father want you to become like this yeah they expect you the expectation on the the natural things are too high but sometimes that's not the way God wants you listen even me I was telling about him why I was a kid okay I heard the voice and the voice spoke to me I saw a plane it says when you grow you're going to be sitting playing and going and coming I think I hope as a sermon before so I thought okay I figure it out I'm gonna be a pilot since I was a kid in Africa I figure me I'm gonna be Apollo that voice that's Apollo so all in my heart was to become a pilot and I love sitting in the plane and you know it was not so okay it was not so even living with the families my uncle whom I live with very educated never open book can show me one day my brother as soon as I start school he went to the big high school brother Philip will tell you prepare College nobody my father cannot reach so he can teach me my mother can teach me I get stuck in school so living with my uncle but at the age of let's say 15 I'm sitting in the class I'm seeing myself going out of the Ghana country the body is sitting in Ghana but I'm seeing myself outside of Ghana so at the age of 17 I got a desire to go out regardless food riches day you tell me anything no I'm going out I am just going what my heart is leading me and I came to Nigeria struggle upon struggles did that so to carry shop when I reach Canada here 1985 I says now I'm free I'm gonna go to school me that pilot I'm gonna become and once I'm in advanced country I'm gonna I'm gonna do everything to go get it I used to go to school Jane and Shepard the Catholic School up there midnight wake in the morning in the evening go to classes but when they teach me everything they teach me as soon as I get out everything gone from my head what is this I was blaming my uncle blame me blame me blame me one day I was standing in jail and Finch all of a sudden a voice the same voice spoke to me and the child spoke again so you I will never let you be educated that thing almost killed me kill me in my heart was like somebody has to use a knife and stuck on my heart my desire is gone so that means I'm going to be laboring the rest of my life I know how education can make your life change Natural Life but not knowing god have a plan one thing I know when that voice spoke to me he'd been speaking to me since I'm child leading me from Nigeria went to Libya put me in jail that voice got me out brought me to Ghana take me to Germany I get in the flame prostitute why the prostitute the Lord says go and talk to her I didn't know it was the Lord I go the girl helped me with his pink guy they put me into a good place in Germany I had no problem everywhere I go Jesus is with me he never let me alone help me now I know that the grace of God not my will but his will not my will but his will whatever he wants me at this point I'm ready I am not gonna do my own way whatever whether it's on the floor whether it's on gato whether it's up whether it's down I am willing because without him I am nothing so forget of yourself God have his way in your life God should have his way in my life because without him we are what nothing without God I am nothing but I'm so thankful to the Lord for his word that's why when I came to church here I says to myself I can't read and write in my heart as soon as they called me to cream it doesn't bother me because once is the Lord Kingdom whether sheep in the floor whether cleaning the washroom whether anything I'm gonna do for this to support the kingdom God move that's what I want to do and that's what a True Believer must do you do it with all your height with all your might with all your soul with all everything that is in you you do it so that God will get the glory not doing for pastors to see you or meet a deacon to see you or trust you or whoever to see you properly no we don't do things like that and you come to church don't just squeeze your child praise God one-time job was a man and has so many tries and job what thinking how amazing he is cares everything holy God he didn't curse and one day God by his grace came to job took the mind of job from Air to Eternity to show him said job when I lay the foundations of the world where were you job was seeing himself praising God some of you need that shaken up when that God showed to you who you really are you sitting in eternity praising God when he was laying the foundations of the world you were with him you saw yourself there you think sorrow's gonna fill your heart like Pastor someone was saying Sunday if you praise God up there down here you're gonna praise God if you shout out there down here you're gonna Shout so job saw himself praising God of death job saw his name written before the foundations of the world with God that John all the boys that was on job job didn't care no more job get into the spirit of God and job saw himself giving all the glory and praises to God job once he began to give praises to God even show him if the conquer worms and the caterpillars and what it is flesh yet in his flesh he will see God that should be our desire that should be our worship of God you think when job saw that and he come and let's say in our day job is here Pastor someone has got into the pulpit preaching he won't Shout you think you're gonna be like a like a just like a dead wood sitting down there with his mouth can open and Shout job gonna praise God job gonna Rejoice because you have seen himself what the Lord has done for him that there's no more dead can hold him absent from this body gonna be present with the Lord that thing should be reality now to you as a Believer not future all what you are hearing is the word of God made flesh to you now present stage of the Lord Ministry he's revealing all that was in him to you it's for you it's not for somebody yes sir some preachers as preachers oh they think when a woman oh don't paint your lips don't paint your knees don't paint this don't do this don't legalistics let me tell when the true word is preached you don't need to go tell a woman should wear long skirt you don't need to tell a woman to take her lipsticks you don't need to tell a man not to wear shorts you don't need to tell the man don't commit adultery or the woman don't commit adultery as soon as the power of God fell upon that seed that seed will will begin to push herself away from the acquaintance the unclean things that seed will begin to come alive and made manifest because why the seed of God is Christ himself hidden there you have a seed of God in you recognize that it is you the Lord came and share his blood for you if you make mistake red paint 10 around the blood is there the spirit of God is there to forgive you so that you will be white as snow and walk with Christ the grace is there the grace is not for the serpents children the grace is for you he says my grace I give it unto you not as the world give the peace you give it to who you the world can give us peace there's no peace in the world they want to give us depression oppression God has created this world for us full abundance and yet they come and tell you oh you see the stock market now we go into recession we're going to walk who created anything tell me who what he has got lost in the world since God created have you seen God taking anything no everything is here it's just a serpent hiding in his children putting tries problems upon God's children that's why God by his grace as the signs increase God increases Spirit come out reveal himself more and more to us and tell us children have faith in me have confidence in me I am he the one that created this universe I have the knowledge that the world don't have I have all Treasures of the world that the world don't have if you obey me I will make a way when there's no way I'll make a way for you wonder small way because I'm taking you out from this world you don't belong to this world the world is in Sodom the church world is in Sodom but you are not in southern I can't hide what I wanted to do to the sodomize for my sin typing Abraham and Abraham see the Royal seed and it's you today the Royal Sea that God was talking is you you are here recognize Who You Are God bless you God ritual bless you tonight his grace is sufficient and Grace will lead you home let us love one another let us come to the service once the church is open if you are not sick don't sleep home come a lot of people they are just wanna pick here pick the pick here pick the pick here how you wanna grow if you do like that you can never grow you have to be in the presence of God because where the word is preaching flesh that's where you eat you grow even naturally tells you your mother when you cook flesh you know Canadian kids I don't know about my kids when their mother cooked today and they eat tomorrow they say oh my mother we don't want left over they want to eat flesh they don't like leftover leftover food no they want flesh and a true Eagle One flesh let me tell you whoever knows brother coffee unless something serious happen about few weeks ago Sunday I was so sick I have a fellowship with someone that God moves so much the next day even on my bed I was just crawling I couldn't wake up my back here my back which has never happened to me but you know what I did during that time I says Satan whether you like it or not Sunday morning you can get me to sleep I'm going to service I'm going you can do whatever you want I'm getting up I'm going to service my wife lays hands on me pray for me and he says okay sleep a little bit this is a little bit die a little bit I said honey let me tell you I know it's the devil I don't care I'm going to service once it's not cold or dark I'm going that pain have to get away I'm going to service and I came here and let me tell you I was telling brother Mike Daddy we talk we Rejoice I come here that's I saw the spirit of God even sometimes you don't know I'm shouting I'm praising God you don't know is the spirit of God because I fight my way to get into the presence of God and that's the way a True Believer you must be fight your way to get into the presence of God look at Russia and Ukraine Ukraine can't stand Russia but no matter what they're gonna let them fail the fight some of them are going even from Canada or us while they are Ukraine they're going they're going to fight they won't let him get it easy you understand a True Believer of Christ in here Satan won't leave you alone Satan not gonna let us go easy he gonna fight but we have to fight so if you fear fight you cannot go in anybody that is lukewarm can go in okay when you are lukewarm you can never go in but when you have the soul of the Lord like Caleb like Joshua yes sir then you are ready to charge the enemy know that you know that you are not going to give up what like David would Goliath five Stones he gonna kill Goliath no matter how strong Goliath is that God in David gonna kill Goliath and this hour that God in the wife of Christ will destroy Satan because it's prophesy already in the scriptures the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent head and he will bruise his hair Christ Brews his head the bride was in where Christ once he brought the serpent head we bruise his head so it is your take rise up as soldiers of the Lord and charge as Caleb and Joshua and defeat the enemy overcome you you are more than that blessed be the name of the Lord our pastor never gave up Pastor Simon I see him going to Ghana with him see how the places we went the cow was going passing even in the day she still going to preach and I'm sitting down there that was very encouraging to me that's the time even I saw the spirit of God moved Pastor was able to interpret my language people were shocked how he was interpreting my language they asked me does he speak my language I says no and they saw it they saw God coming up if you're not paying the price you're not going to see those things but when you pay that price God is obligated to flow God is obligated to show you signs and wonders a lot of people think silence and wonders come by easy way it doesn't God word is doesn't come by easy way he can buy a hard way because God and Satan is fighting but God is in you so think if God is in you you are a soldier fighting Satan whose side did used to before the foundations of the world when up there the fight broke Lucifer and Michael did you stood for Michael or did you stood for Satan Lucifer we are down here I stood for Christ I'm going to fight dead or no dead until this mouth closed until this body go in the grave I'll
