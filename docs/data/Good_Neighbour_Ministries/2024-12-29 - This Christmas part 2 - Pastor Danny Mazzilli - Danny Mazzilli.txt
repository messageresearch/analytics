continue into that we're just going to go deeper um as the Lord would direct and guide us and as he would uh lead and meet the needs in in the midst I trust you've come prayed up amen if you haven't pray now say Lord speak to me speak to my needs I have needs and I believe that you are uh Mindful and you're you you can do just like you did when you walked up to the woman at the well you could tell her all about her life and there was no doubt in her mind that she had come into contact with the Living God Amen and it changed her life so I trust that you are under expectation this morning and that God will speak to you so what is God up to this Christmas um we looked at it last week uh let's read our scripture and then um we will move along amen praise God it's uh from uh the book of Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder notice he goes from a a child being born to the one that's going to have his that that's going to be the governor the king the government shall be upon his shoulder amen amen and his name Shall be Called wonderful the counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace amen he's not only just a baby that was born 2,000 years ago he's the Mighty God in our midst this morning he's the great counselor and he's the Prince of Peace for your life you may be seated amen praise God last week we um we looked at uh three aspects of what God is up to here um at Christmas time you know many of us think of uh Christmas you know and everybody recites the you know the play of the baby being born in the manger and children can recite it nowadays and everybody you know can talk about you know Mary and Joseph and their experience but let me tell you um though it is is now a story for the people back then when it was actually happen happening it was a reality it was something that they could not understand from a from a a a a normal human standpoint of view how a woman could conceive a child without being with a man amen and these were these were things that you know that the people were questioning at the time and wow what's got up to here because a lot of them didn't realize what the prophecy had said and they they failed to to believe believe that everything that God said he would do everything there's nothing that God will not do that he promised according to his word and it applies to every single one of us because in our day here now we are we are experiencing these things we know that God is up to something amen what is God up to this Christmas well you're G to hear about it you heard about it last Sunday you're going to continue to hear about it every Sunday right from this Pulpit amen that God is up to something big and we can be glad that we're a part of it amen and so you know you can ask yourself what's God up to in my life in my church in my neighborhood on my street or my place of uh where I work amen what's he up to and so it's a great question but if you if you want to know the answers then you need to look back into the scriptures you need to read about the Lord Jesus and what he did what he said and what he manifested when he was here on Earth just over 2,000 years ago amen praise God and so a quick review uh we go to uh slide our next slide we looked at it will be in ways that we weren't expecting God will do things in ways that you will not expect him to do it'll be in ways that are that are surprising even startling okay amen and uh don't expect God to work only in ways that you're already familiar with okay you know because you were brought up under the traditions of of going to church and you know you thought that you know just going to church and being present in a place and and and repeating things after the priest or or or you just singing some hymns and and so forth that that was worshiping God that's just a small aspect of worshiping the lord it's a life of worship amen praise God so Jesus often comes to us in unexpected ways you you know you would think oh if I go to church that's where he can come to me that's not where he came to me I don't know about you but we can look back into the scriptures and and see that that you know most of the Miracles and the things that the Lord Jesus did was not in church okay it was in the streets in the Bible in the highways at people's homes amen and he was doing miraculous things and he was doing it amongst strange people people that they wouldn't think would be the normal and so as such people of God didn't recognize him at that time when he was here on Earth and they turned around and they said he's beab he's a heretic he's causing trouble he's you know he's dividing the people they didn't recognize that he was doing something in ways that they weren't expecting but if they had a looked to the scripture they would have seen it clearly problem today is a lot of people don't read the word amen he came in ways that it made it easy for them to actually reject him look at John 20 when Mary went to the supper just a quick review she went to the supper she was looking for the body she had walked with Jesus she was with him when he was doing all the great Miracles and then she went to the supper because she wanted to anoint his body and and she's going there and she goes to the to the cave to the and and and she asks somebody that's standing there uh have you seen Jesus she looked inside and and the body was missing and the person she was asking was actually the Lord himself but she didn't recognize him because he had gone into another form of the word he had transcended from being a physical human Son of God to A theophany Jesus in his word body now in order to fulfill the next aspect of the word which was to reveal himself now personally that's why if you read the scripture in in John 2016 and 17 Jesus saith unto her Mary she turned herself and she said unto him Rabbi Master when he spoke her name when he deliberately opened her understanding she recognized who he was and it's the way that he's doing it in this hour you might think it's strange you know all these churches and all these people going to church and they're under all of this tradition but they fail to recognize that when Jesus calls personally people change and they're never going to be the same they'll never be the same amen praise God but it's a personal now Jesus was moving on and you'll notice he went to meet with the disciples on the road to emus and here he was it was Christ it was the Messiah talking to his disciples and they didn't recognize that it was him but their hearts were burning within them but then he went into the room with them he went in to have supper with them he went in to have some fellowship with them and he broke the bread and the scripture says and their eyes were open Hallelujah he's doing it still now I trust that the word of God this morning as the word comes forth and the word gets broken and the bread of life gets gets delivered and and and pieces are delivered into your into your hearts and into your lives that your understanding will open and you'll say my heart was burning within me while I heard the word of God this morning amen praise God that's why we're here he called her personally by name and he's calling you by name amen praise God he's come back Hallelujah listen uh what what does our Lord do after we fail to receive him when he comes in an unexpected way what does he do he just moves on he moves on you you have the the ability to say Amen or you can have the ability to say nah that's too religious for me making it too personal I don't want him in my personal life I got things in my personal life that I don't want to be exposed you know that's the problem I talk to people about the Lord and they say you know Danny I'm GNA come to church sometime but I got to clean up my life I said you got it wrong it's backwards I said you need to come and let the word clean up your life you can't do it you've been trying to do it for for the last 30 years 40 years whatever it is you can't do it you got to let him do it amen praise God he says I can do it I can lift things off your life that you had no idea I he can do more than you could possibly even imagine I let him in amen you need to be like uh what what it says you need to recognize what it says in Isaiah 43:18 forget the former things do not dwell on the past don't look at the way things used to be move on and allow the Holy Spirit he says behold I'm doing a new thing I want to change your life I want to transform you I want to move you on to Perfection according to the word I want the world to see that this whole thing about Christianity and going to church is a lot more it's it's it's much bigger than the people expected amen next slide we looked at that he says second it'll be in places and among people that we weren't expecting we just said that you'll go to a certain church and you'll look at you know you come into this church here a lot of people will come in and man they'll say wow you got the United Nations in here that's right because God is calling from every Walk of Life it's not about color it's not about upbringing it's not about language it's about the word and the fact that if the word is in you from before the foundations of the world Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come not one will be lost and this is so important to recognize that when when my sheep hear my voice no other will they follow this aspect of the word is in progress always has been in progress progress he'll never change because he's the same Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever amen praise God and so he'll do it in in in in ways uh and in places and amongst people that we would least expect amen praise God glory to God Amen God can show up in most ungodly places he can show up anywhere he wants if he wants to call one of his children he'll go go to a party he'll go to Matthew's house Matthew was a tax collector he was he had a lot of money and he would throw parties and in those parties would be all kinds of different people includ including prostitutes but even the prostitutes when they heard the word and there was some representation in them they responded to the word amen We're Not Looking for clean fish we're looking for children of God they're bound up they're they're they're messed up they're in these these these vessels of clay that are all messed up because of upbringing and and and and environment people that have been born into families that are broken molested all kinds of problems and situations but listen that is not what that doesn't scare the Lord he's looking for he says I didn't come for those that needed no physician he says I come for those that need a physician that need to be set free that need to be healed just go back and and read about the woman at the well when when when she finally woke up to realize that this is the Messiah he just told me all about myself my whole life you think it mattered anymore that she had been with five husbands and the one that she was with wasn't even hers it didn't matter she went back into Samaria and the Bible says that she converted that City by her test testimony amen people were converted people people knew that she had been with Jesus and if you've had that true experience people will know that you've been with Jesus amen praise God he's usually outside of the camp he'll go to places like like he went to Zak's house when when Jesus was walking along and zakas said hey you know zakus was a man with money and he thought man this guy's doing some Miracles maybe he can multiply my M I'm going to invite him into my house but no zakas when he started to hear the word and and the word started to strike his heart he was looking for ways to give it away he was saying wait a minute here oh boy I got to give back the money I stole from this person I got to give back this one I got to take care he he come to realize this is The Real McCoy this is Jehovah God and then and then in the midst of that little gathering here comes the a prostitute with some ointment and she comes and she washes the the Lord's feet with her tears and wipes it with her hair and Jesus said sin no more your sins are forgiven you they were shocked how can this man po how could he say your sins are forgiven he's still saying it today he's saying you're Justified if you receive this word you're Justified your sin has no more power over you from this day from this moment your life can be transformed and you can walk free Justified means you never done it in the first place God doesn't just forget your sin he wipes it and places it into the sea of his forgetfulness that he himself will not even remember amen you'll remember because the devil his job is to come and tell you all about what you did and remind you so he can keep you into a condition of condemnation but the scripture says there is therefore no more condemnation to them that are in Christ hallelujah amen and then we looked at the third thing and this is where we're going to continue on it will be bigger than we were expecting when he comes and when he does something whether it's in your own personal life or here on Earth it is going to be bigger and greater than anything that has ever happened in the past on this Earth this is greater than any other Christmas why it's that much closer to fulfillment of his next stage of the word of God where this world enters into 1,000 years of Peace where this world is going to be uh uh uh set free from the power of of Satan's uh oppression don't tell me you don't see it listen I'm not talking Hocus Pocus here okay we're talking we're talking reality there's people out there that are under mental oppression they don't know what to do they're thinking suicide all day long there's Nations that are falling apart there's cities and and and and countries that are in complete and total turmoil this morning amen this is not just just talk this is a reality the world is entering into a time of Great Tribulation like has never been seen before who would have ever thought that we would experience the kind of things that we did just in the last five years the whole world was shut down by one plague the whole world was globally was shut down people couldn't fly they couldn't do anything they couldn't go out they had to be they had to be locked up in their homes who would have ever thought that that could have happened but it did and these are only the birth Pains of things that are beginning to take place upon the Earth and there's only one safe place and that place is in Christ amen and so it'll be bigger and greater amen There's a Great Awakening right now that's taking place in the true church I know you hear that statement but there has to be a true church and a false church because the Bible says there was light and there was Darkness without the light you couldn't know that there was darkness and without the darkness you couldn't know that there was light amen and so this is going to be big praise God but I want you to know that the the world is is in a is in a state of conf Fusion because of all the different religions you've got all kinds of teachings but there was only one person that walked on this Earth that said I am the way the truth and the life he was the only one that history tells us was crucified and rose from the dead there was a purpose in all of that people will will will tell you about all their theories of how the world in the universe and how God is operating and how this world is is is moving into higher forms of Consciousness and understanding about God yes they are but the moment that they leave out the way the truth and the life they miss everything am because Jesus was the only one that said I am the way the truth and the life we cannot leave him out of the formula in any way shape or form if we do and we do not make him almighty God we miss it all cuz he's our Escape he's the body if you want to if you want to look at it as like a like a spaceship that you need to get into that ship you need to be in fellowship with the Lord Jesus and the Lord is his word this is the thing we're not trying to be religious Jesus wasn't even religious come on come on that's a strong statement people say oh man you're so religious you're too you're too zealous about Jesus Jesus was not even religious show me in the scriptures where he went to all the priests where he didn't rebuke them where he challenged them where he said fools they looked at him one day and said when he was talking to the Pharisees and and and a group of them and and they were they looked at Jesus they said we are the children of Abraham Jesus looked at them and said what you're the children of Abra Abraham if you were the children of Abraham you would know me and you would love me but you hate me I can tell by the way you're talking by the way you're you're you're you're you're you're talking about me amongst the people you want to kill me you go back and read it in St John chapter 8 I'll even read it for you St John chapter 8 Jesus turned around and said ye verse 44 ye are of your father the devil this is why they're having that conversation he says and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning who was the first murderer in the Bible Cain that's why Cain was not a son of Adam he was a son of the serpent we're not going to get into all that you you know you can go back and and and look it wasn't an apple that Eve sinned by it was an adultery and two children were brought for Cain and Abel he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it who was the one that went to Eve and said hath God said that the day you eat thereof you shall surely die that was the serpent talking wasn't a snake it was an upright being it was a man and he was talking to her like the way you and I are talking right now and he was telling her you know has God said that he quoted the word he knew the word but he deceived her into believing that she could be like God that's why you know a lot of people today they want to talk about you know coming into their into their consciousness of of God that they that they because a lot of people listen this is the time Daniel talked about where information and knowledge would increase and the revelation of the word is coming to places in our lives where we're recognizing this is more than just church this is more than just gathering together and and and and reading the Bible this is more than just you know some people coming together I'm a Christian no no this is about you becoming one with the word you becoming an expression of the word because the spirit comes in you and you manifest it this is so much greater so much greater but but but but the people they want to make it like it's just church and they've got an explanation on how the universe works and how how everything evolved and how you know no listen if somebody comes to you and gives you an understanding on the universe and how everything was created and how you are a part of that creation and they tell you that and you say to them but you know what because this is what they're saying about Christians and about churches and about religion they're saying it's a way to keep them distracted into thinking that that's going to be the way to make it out of here that that it's not about joining a church and believing in the Lord Jesus and that he died for them on the cross they will not talk about the crucifixion they will not talk about him coming as he started as God come into human human flesh to become God so that he could redeem his own cuz Redemption the whole Plan of Redemption is to bring back that which was already his only those that are his are going back but when they tell you oh but you don't need to list oh Jesus yeah Jesus was he he was a great Master he reached very high levels of consciousness and understanding and we can do the same you know what that's the same serpent that that said you can be like God but he doesn't realize that inside of you is a portion of God and you can't deny the word because you are a part of that word and when the word comes forth like it's coming forth now in in our day and it's bringing truth because remember Jesus hasn't changed he says I am the way the truth and the life he said to the woman at the well the day will come that I'm going to be worshiped in spirit and in truth you can't just have all spirit and partial truth you need the whole truth about who Jesus Christ is that's why he said on that day ye shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you that's the greater thing that we're building on that we're growing into that we're going to manifest that will bring forth the body change and the Rapture of the church and so that's the same old Spirit when they tell you oh Jesus he was you know he he he was just you know crucifixion well I asked that question to somebody and they came back to me and said well you know what I agree with everything that you're saying about you know about um becoming one with with with God and everything else I'm just not sure about this crucifixion thing you see they fail to recognize the antidote that without him becoming man and going to the Cross to to fulfill his own word because he cannot heavens and earth will pass away if a man sins a man must die there had to be a sacrifice oh you're putting it into a metaphor it's only just signs and it's all yeah it's all those things but without that sacrifice and without Christ when he said at the cross it is finished there'd be no spirit of God Holy Ghost to come back upon the church the True Believers so that they could read and understand the word of God they' they'd fall for the lies of the devil all the teachings of the enemy because Jesus said I will send you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he he will guide you into all truth remove the Holy Ghost and just make it science and teaching and you are not going to be able to discern truth it's only the spirit of God in you that can actually read that's why the Bible says the letter kills but the spirit gives life and it opens the understanding of the word of God amen amen praise God and so here let's move along here let's read our next scripture because you know um just just this morning the Lord led me to make some changes you know and and here so in Joshua chap 1: 8 to9 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night amen that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have I not commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest amen praise God you know um when I was reading this it brought me right back to you know Joshua and Caleb in the days when God God delivered the children of Israel now you know God had given Joshua God had given Moses a commission and said that that he was going to take the people out of Egypt and he did it exactly the way God said he was going to do it all the odds were against Moses so that's why he'll do things in ways that you don't expect him to do it but recognize what took place there and and there's a there's a point here I want I want to uh elaborate on as we we move through this because we're going to read some scriptures but recognize that Moses all the odds were against him but when he stood before Pharaoh he didn't say set my people free I am Mo god listen Pharaoh knew who Moses was he knew who he was what are you doing here Moses are you crazy you're coming against my armies but he had thus sayith the Lord he had the word the message for that day Moses was the message for that moment that hour that was going to liberate and set the people free regardless of the circumstances God was with him and then God when Moses went off the scene and they went into the Wilderness they were 40 years in the wilderness and I want you to notice something and I want you to I want you to see a correlation here because we've been Christians for many many many years there's all kinds of tribes out there and just like the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt there was all kinds of tribes all kinds of different churches and they they all got together differently at night but they had believed what Moses had told them they knew that the pillar of fire that the word was with them they saw it but it wasn't a reality to them oh my goodness but Joshua was given the commission now to take them into the promised land and Joshua was and and and and and God said as I was with Moses and Joshua remembered everything that God did with Moses just like we can remember all that God did with William brandham in the 20th century when he brought the word of God and and and the churches were all stirred up he was the Moses of our day amen and there's a Joshua commission that is in operation in this day amen and we need to recognize that as God was with Moses he told Joshua I will be with you you just need to be strong and courageous you need to be willing to to to come under headship to the Joshua commission which is now the fivefold ministry Christ in the five-fold ministry ministering his word calling and placing because Joshua was placing the children of God Amen but I want you to notice here we're going to read here now from from Hebrews uh chapter 3: 1-19 you go to the next slide and we'll just we'll just look at each aspect of it wherefore now pay attention here because this jumped out at me this morning and I had to add it all in to the whole message wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and the high priest of our profession Christ what am I preaching about here this morning about him okay so he's always reminding us go back to the word go back to Christ get your foundation right who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house you see he's he's holding that that that correlation here because it was the word it was God that was with Moses it was God that was in Christ for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses this was this is Jes this is God himself when Moses went up before pharaoh and said thus sayeth the Lord that was God's voice speaking out of Moses it wasn't Moses's voice it was God's voice set my people free it was God when when Moses took the staff and called for fleas called for the frogs called for the plagues and finally called for the death angel it wasn't Moses yes sir it was God it's always been God and he says in as much as he hath builded the house hath more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god so let's get it all straight here we're not looking for anybody else to build the church we're not looking for anybody else to to to to to uh bring the body of Christ and each position into their rightful positions it's all going to be God himself let's move on next slide and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after Moses when he was converted and he had that burning bush experience let me tell you he went with confidence he met with God he had a conference with God until you come to that place in your life where you meet with God where you come face to face with the word of God you're not going to have the same kind of confidence but Christ as a son over his own house whose house are we did you read that Christ has his own house it's the body am the body of Christ is the house of God amen amen and if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith now pay attention here as the Holy Ghost saith today not yesterday today if thou will hear his voice this has been the aspect that has been missed all along and that's why to put Jesus Christ on the outside of the camp and not recognize him in the very element that he is almighty God but now in the form of a church in a in a mystical body to reject that voice is to miss everything because Caleb and Joshua they had heard exactly what was delivered to to from Moses yes and they believed it they didn't care listen they listen all the children of Israel when those spies went in to spy out the land and they saw all the Giants and and how Jericho was surrounded and the walls and everything else and the armies they said are we are you kidding me we're like ants to these to these soldiers and there's no way we could take the land it's the same thing today you've got nine you've got 98% of the churches that are preaching Jesus Christ believing that that but but yet you come to them and you you give them the Simplicity of of of the the fact that God is one and that baptism do you know that 98% of the churches out there baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost which is an absolute wrong baptism because they're accepting a trinitarian Doctrine believing that God is three in one nonsense there's only one baptism it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ fully immersed into the water but yet in niasia 3:25 they changed the baptism and they adopted baptism into the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and to this day they hold on to those doctrines not recognizing that it's actually an aspect of the mark of the beast because it's it's they've they've consciously accepted a wrong doctrine of who God actually is and by believing the LIE they'll perish let's read on but it says here now watch he says hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in provocation in other words provocation is like you know an action or speak speech that makes somebody uh you know annoyed or get angry because when you hear this word you know people people get get you know excited and and angry sometimes they say oh you think you know Danny no I don't think I know anything but I can show you scripturally that there was 8,000 baptisms in the book of Acts alone and every one of them was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I say you show me one place in the scripture amen because God left his word as evidence and he said my word let every man's word be a lie but my word be the truth God is not going to judge based on what you think or what this church thinks or what that church believes he's going to judge according to his word and how does your life look when it when when you put it in the mirror of God's word is your experience like that or not it's simple if it isn't get with it he still he says but don't harden yourself in the day of Temptation in the wilderness because a lot of people are are still in the wilderness oh there's all kinds of people going to church but you sit down and try to have a real conversation about God about salvation about their lives and and how salvation and how important it is and and really really you know sit and and get serious about the word and they can only go so far and then they'll say nah you're going too personal you're getting too close to to me it's not me you got to let him in he's the one don't Harden your heart that's the that's the whole aspect of you know this what's going on at Christmas right now but there's a lot of people in the wilderness with hardened Hearts let's read on here he goes on here and he says when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I grieved with that generation and said they always ear in their heart and they have not known my ways here he was constantly Moses was constantly going before the people constantly bringing them the word of God constantly revealing truth to them but they got caught up into the worldliness they got caught up into into the teachings of the world if listen the majority is always wrong that's that's a strong statement but guess what there the majority now I'm not saying in everything especially when it comes to politics cuz they're both corrupt both sides you can't find a you know it's it's corruption at the highest levels when when you're looking at into government but there's but it's also there for a purpose and we need to submit okay as as the word of God says you know to submit to our higher authorities according to the word of God and so we need to realize that that these people that were in the wilderness they they saw the pillar of fire they saw what God was doing they saw the Miracles but notice what happened after 40 years he said so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God the word for our day am be careful he was telling them that you know that that that listen it wasn't a matter of how sincere they were there's churches they're sincere they're sincerely serving God to the best of their ability but when truth comes to them in in its in its absolute if there's representation of Christ in them just like like they will love the truth they will love the truth they will not hate the truth if the truth is revealed they will love it amen and and the truth is the Living Word in the Living God in this day and in this hour but he says now watch he goes on to say here but exhort one another daily that's what we're doing that's why we come together to Fellowship around the word to exhort the people on the word of God while it is called today because this is a new day this is the message for today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and he says lest any of you be hardened through deceitfulness of sin sin is unbelief sin is when somebody says listen drinking smoking all those lying cheating all those things that's not sin those are the attributes of sin the reason people do those things is because they don't believe the word if they believe the word they would do it according to the word amen it would not be it would that's where people get confused and they think that sin is is all the all the attributes no you need to get to the root cause of why sin is in your life it's because of unbelief unbelief any form of unbelief listen MOS listen Joshua and Caleb they heard the report of those other 10 spies they saw those Giants and they saw the armies that they would have to go up against but they believed the word they believed their Prophet they believed believe the message for their day which said I'm giving you that Promised Land but because the people didn't believe wow what look it he goes on to say he says for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast under the end if that if that experience with Christ is a reality in your life you're going to hold it right to the end you're not going to be thwarted or convinced you know to come to this church no don't go to that church you need to go to this church you don't go to church to listen to the man you go to church to have the word speak to your heart that's what Jesus meant when he said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail when he said who do you say that I am people say that God is there's all kinds of different definitions of Jesus Christ out there Trinity Oneness this that all these other but Jesus he knew he looked he says Peter who do you say that I am he said Thou Art the Christ the the son of the Living God you are the Messiah you are God the word made flesh and Jesus looked and said Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed this to you you didn't learn it in church you didn't learn it from your parents you didn't learn he says but my father the spirit when Jesus says my father he's talking about himself that's why when philli said Lord show us the father Jesus looks he says Phillip have I been with you so long if you see me you seen the father it's so clear but you see you got to open your understanding to believe the word people I got to see it to believe it no you need to believe it if you really want to see it that's how God works you need to believe it first and then God will vindicate and confirm his word to you whether it's Truth Or Not amen praise God and so the whole aspect is that we need to hold fast while it is said today if you will hear his voice see how he he he brings it in again Paul brings it clearly here to the Hebrews while it is said today this message if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses let's read the last few verses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness those that disbelieved and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not wasn't how sincere they were it's not how sincere the churches are it's not how sincere they get together and they they they give to the poor and and yes those are all all good things and we should do all of those things but when it comes down to when the when the Great Reckoning takes place and the and the word of God comes to its fulfillment here on this Earth and and the Rapture of the church takes place it's going to be a few and the the rest of the churches will probably not even miss you because you're such a little flock Jesus says Little Flock it's not a big flock just go back and look through the scriptures you'll see it over and over and over again the minority was the ones that God was with when Jesus himself walked on Earth there was a dozen people that were following him think about it Saints he doesn't change but look what he says here it was those that believe not so we can see that they could not enter in because of unbelief this has always been a fight between faith and unbelief go back to the Garden of Eden Abel by faith because he was a Son of God a son of Abel a son of Adam he knew that it would require a lamb to bring to the altar because he knew that it was sin and there would have to be a lamb that would be the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world World Cain goes and gets flowers goes and gets the fruit of the field goes and gets all the beauty because Satan is in all the beauty of this world all the beauty that comes out of Hollywood all the Fashions you see women now the way they dress and they they you know they go to parties the new fashion today is basically naked just a sheer piece of clothing that shows everything else and this is today's fashion you see back in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve had no clothes they were shielded by the Holy Ghost before the fall that's why you'll notice in Genesis that after they had sinned God goes looking for them and they had to hide themselves and God says why are you hiding yourselves he says because we're naked well who the heck told them they were naked why did their eyes open to be naked all of a sudden because it was a sex act in the Garden of Eden and they knew what they had done and they were trying to cover it they covered themselves with fig leaves it's so clear scripturally the condition of the world and why unbelief and and and and the level of understanding on the word of God that it's always been a battle between faith and unbelief but Jesus said here as we carry on I will not next scripture I will not leave you comfortless I I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me you will know because I live you shall live also and at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you this is the greater thing that he is doing now but if there's Hardness of Heart if there's doctrines of man and teachings of man and well my church does it this way I ask a person are you a Christian well I'm a Baptist I said no are you a Christian well I go to a Baptist Church they're Christians I said but are you a Christian or are you a Baptist this is a Christian Church the reason why we're Christian churches in this message is because we follow Christ the word we don't follow man's teaching you go to the Catholic Church you go see the priest they tell you you need to go and confess your sin which is a nonsense you show me in the Bible where that is okay it's nowhere to be found where you got to go to a priest to confess your sins Jesus is the high priest he took all your sin right to the cross and he nailed it to the cross and he said it's finished so don't let anybody bring up your your your past once you've come to Christ and you've accepted him as the priest and the high priest and the Lord over your life you're forgiven you're washed you never done it in the first place you get a brand new life that's why they say you're born again I know they want to put all kinds of nonsense oh you're so religious you guys are you know what is it har Krishna or something no we believe the word we're not religious we're spiritual because of the Holy Ghost that's opened our understanding to the word of God in simplicity there's nothing complicated in what I've been saying here this morning it's simple word you got to go back to the word and see what the word says and the word can never ever lie amen praise God but it's only by the Holy Spirit and so people don't realize that that this element of God in you this is this is the element that that we want to take home today it's about God in you now that's what makes you a Christian that's what identifies you in the body of Christ I go to church but the real church is the body of Christ when when listen in every Church you're going to get three kinds of Believers make believer unbeliever cuz people are going to leave and they're never going to come back they're going to say that's a bunch of nonsense I heard over there today it's going to happen in churches all over the world they go to church at Christmas because oh I should go at Christmas at least once I used to do that too maybe every other year but that's not what it's all about it's about coming into that relationship with him and realizing that he can change your circumstances from this day but you got to come in spirit and in truth how can a lie potentially or possibly help you it is only a Band-Aid I'll go to church and that will at least I can tell people that I've been going to church and my life will be better no it's between faith and unbelief this battle is between faith and unbelief you know that even as Adam lost his inheritance when he fell into that sin with Eve he fell out of God's program right at that moment and all that God has been doing all the way from that moment when Adam and Eve fell and this whole world stepped and fell into time all God has been doing is condescending down bringing himself back going to make the sacrifice so that he could bring his children back because Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden they were God remember read it in Genesis 2 when God created Adam In His Image called their name Adam Adam and Eve was still Eve wasn't even talked about in Genesis 2 but yet he called their name Adam because God is male and female aspect in his pure form but then when Adam fell everything fell the whole world fell into time he said that day you shall surely die well how do we know death because of time you know that without time there is no death death and time go hand in hand and that's why we are being restored back to our Eternal bodies in the Millennium our bodies will not be time bodies they will be Eternal theophany bodies the Bible talks about it shall put on immortality amen praise God and so people will say to you yeah so so God is in you yes God is in me amen so when you pray who are you praying to you either believe this or you don't it gets a little bit you know touchy when when when when you talk about God in you but you know what the problem is the problem is that when people people take God in you and they mix it with their pride or arrogance it brings out a different kind of a character it produces the wrong character doesn't line up with the word of God doesn't show the love of God it shows arrogance and that's why people that are that are that are coming into levels of consciousness high levels of understanding in this time because knowledge would increase and there are people that are coming into the understanding of how the Universe works and how that everything is energy but that energy is God it's his word it's his thought when God speaks it it manifests and people are benefiting from God's laws God's energy of the universe that the you know love of Attraction all of those things but but what they've done is that they've been perverted by that lie that Satan said you can be like God and that's why you'll see the lives that they live and the kind of things that they do and the kind of manifestation that comes out of their lives they'll they'll swear and use the FW while they're talking about God in the universe and everything else and that is the holy ghost that is God that's not God that's that old serpent back in the beginning you see they don't have the character they don't have the the their their arrogance and their pride that's why the scripture said Lucifer Satan he was lifted up in Pride while he was in heaven and he caused one-third of the angels to fall and follow him because he wanted to be worshiped we're not looking to get worship when we say that we are the word when be it's the reason why we say we are the word is because we are manifesting what God Said would happen in the end time that there would be a church without spot or wrinkle there would be a Rapture of a church there would be a people that would be receiving faith for a Rapture perfect Faith because you don't got enough Faith you need a supernatural element to be spoken into you by the word of God as you walk with God that's why Enoch he walked with God long enough that the Bible says that he walked with God and then he wasn't cuz he went in a Rapture God moved him from one dimension to the other and God's going to move the church out of this dimension for three and a half years of Great Tribulation that's going to strike this earth like it or not it's coming so God has a plan and so when we pray we pray to the god that's in US amen that's the kind of confidence that we Jesus said it I believe it they don't understand it in that way listen to Brother Brad says calling Jesus on the scene he says now you say how could he be God and be man see there is the mystery see in body he was man he's talking about the Lord Jesus in spirit he was God see someone asked me said then how did then who did he pray to In The Garden of Gethsemane I said I'll answer you that when you answer this do you believe you have the Holy Ghost a lot of people say oh I got the Holy Ghost brother let me tell you and then F this F that bing bing boom I've talked to people like that and oh yeah I got the I'm on the street man I'm I'm I'm bringing people to Jesus you should see what's going on F this F that bang and I'm thinking holy smokes if that's the Jesus that's not the Jesus I know he said that which comes out defiles the man not what goes in then he says do you believe you got the Holy Ghost he said I said then he said yes I said then who do you pray to where is he at when you are praying to him when you claim you got you you have him and yet you're praying to him see people just they just get some little idea and run wild with it you see that's that's the way it goes in other words they don't really believe they don't really believe the word and when you really truly honestly you've made it your absolute your you that's it I'm not talking that you got to be perfect let's get this all straight here people think you mean I got to live by every word that that that's in the Bible I got to read those Ten Commandments man I I I'll fail every single day I fail all the time and you fail every single day but Jesus knew that you'd be locked up in this sinful flesh he says that's why I got to bring an antidote for you that when you receive it and you truly believe it it's not the flesh that's going to make it into the kingdom of God flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of God your old crabby nature is going to fall away from you when you enter into that other dimension and your body's going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you're going to have a brand new body that's going to be just like it was when you were 21 years old and you will be brand new and you will have the spirit of Christ you will have the mind of Christ you will Express the love of God you will be in Fellowship brother brandham went into that other dimension and when he went there he said nothing but perfect love will enter into into that place he said I was hugging sisters and brothers and even while I was hugging the sisters that I saw in that other dimension there was no sensation there was no sexual sensation or anything because we are being restored back to Adam the first Adam failed the B the scripture says but the second Adam it can never fail is going to resurrect us if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal body means it'll translate your atoms it'll Quicken your atoms by the word and you will just translate into that other dimension he says you see so we are praying to the Lord in US you believe that when you take food and you know people want to make it such a big deal listen when I go and I eat and I'm in a crowd of people I say thank you I bless this in the name of Jesus Christ I believe it that which you bless shall be blessed and that which you curse shall be cursed so you got to be careful you got to be careful how you use the word of God that's why God wants character he doesn't want arrogance he doesn't want Pride he's not going to let you harness the word of God and use and and and and and and and and and and take the sword of God if you haven't got the character God will mold you shape you that's why you got to come into the house of the Lord that's why we need the word of God to mold and shape us cut off certain things and most of the stuff that's being cut off is our human Pride arrogance all the things that Satan put on this flesh to exalt himself because remember he exalts and feeds off the people that's what he does does but God God's people feed off of him we feed on the word amen praise God our problem is that we get so distracted by religion by religious practices by traditions we need to break out of those things break out of those Traditions amen and know that he abides in US glory to God the Lord wants us to know that you are his victory in this hour when you allow the word to manifest through your life you become his victory that's why he wants you to recognize the word for your day those that walked with Jesus he loved those disciples he loved them they were his victory they were they were manifesting him his word my sheep hear my voice he realized those were his sheep and we are his sheep in this day and in this hour when we recognize the word and we allow it to direct and guide Our Lives listen here in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says justified in his sight talking about us why are we Justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living amongst the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him among the the uh shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave and neither can they keep us in the graves of denominational teachings when the word comes it's going to resurrect the Sons and Daughters of God Amen because we've raised from the dead amen that's right he says unbelief already potentially arised because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word when you when you step out and you say I believe God's word do you know that you're showing the resurrection of Christ in you you're showing that he's in you praise God he says unbelief in his word from denominational Creeds he says to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is him hisself he says working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and then the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife they are flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life Spirit of his Spirit see amen how do you know it Bears the same record the same fruit the same word see manifesting Christ the same life the same God the same Spirit things that I do you also oh Hallelujah he says notice he Vindicated the word in his body is his very Victory and the reason of his death was so that he could live in US amen let's go to the next slide in Matthew 21 he says Jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if you have faith and you doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive notice how many times he said ye at the top there ye shall ye have ye shall ye shall ye shall he's talking to you amen glory to God that's who he's talking to praise God in look he says in Luke go to the next slide in Luke chapter 17 we're winding down now and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh with not with observation it's not going to be in this oh Jesus is going to come Jesus came in 1963 his second coming was in 1963 on Sunset Mountain go back and and look it up study it and and study the life of William Branham and the opening of The Seven Seals this is what we're preaching here amen people are looking for the second coming of Christ they've missed it already he's already come and now he's living in the body he's come he says that day you shall know that I am in in the father ye and me and I in you that day has to come this is that day there had to be a time where we would come to this realization but look what he says here he says the kingdom cometh he says not with observation neither shall they say loow here or low there for behold the kingdom of God is where amen in you you see there's going to be a people that are going to believe this they're not going to just read it on Sunday and and they're going to just oh the kingdom of God is within you oh he's in the church he's in the he's in this place on you either Believe it or you don't believe it it's as simple as that it's within you he says listen what he says here he says in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you and the Bible Jesus the kingdom he says we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life did you hear what I just read the kingdom of God is spirit and life made flesh in our own life amen bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word of God was one and the word and God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring now pay attention to bring the message in the last day oh glory to God to bring the message in the last day praise God forever more and be taken up from dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again now remember what I was saying about Adam and Eve to restore as Adam and Eve in the beginning In the Garden of Eden the three-fold mystery of God in his body that's why the Old Testament is God above us Jesus comes to the Earth in the New Testament God With Us and now Jesus goes gives up the Holy Ghost so that it can come back down into the church and it's what God in us hallelujah praise God forever more let's read let's read this uh uh next scripture here in St John or in 1 John 414 he says beloved believe not every Spirit that's now this is where we you know we we're constantly learning from the the scriptures and that's why we're in an hour now where there's so many spirits so many interpretations on the word of God let God be his own interpreter in your life amen don't try to put on anything just be yourself he says don't believe every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world and hereby know ye the spirit of God pay attention every spirit that can confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God so don't think because I say that he is now in us that I'm giving you some false Doctrine the scripture tells you clearly I'm telling you he's now in us manifesting and bringing the body together for the Rapture of the church and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God just telling you what the word says and this is the spirit of antichrist it tells you right away Antichrist means anything that is against the word I don't care how sincere they sound how lovely they are they need the truth the truth will set them free if they have representation in God from before the foundations of the World when they hear the truth they will love it they say this is this makes absolute sense I love it I can't I don't even fully understand it but I'm in love with him I'm in love with the word it's a reality it's changing me it's it's lifting all the darkness from my life I can't explain why all this mental oppression that was on my life and all these fears of death and all these worries of of of what's going to happen when I die or what's going to happen to my children or what's you know all this fear that that because people are are are Liv literally bulleted with fear but Jesus lifts all of that when you come into that personal understanding of who he is he just moves it all aside he says that is the spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you see here it is again he's saying I'm in you greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world praise God aren't you glad listen as I close here in the message he that is in you 1963 if we could let the musicians come if we could only receive this truth now just a moment if we only could realize what the scripture means when he say said that he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world we can't understand that yet we say we believe it and we know it's the truth but we really don't understand it but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world what is in you that's greater it's Christ the Anointed God that was in Christ is in you now greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world then if he is in you it's not you anymore living it's him living in you see it's not your thinking what you would think about this it's what he said about this see then if he is in you he absolutely would not deny what he said he couldn't do it but he would keep what he said and he is trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through oh boy he's looking for somebody to vindicate his word he's looking for a people now that doesn't mean he has to do it to everybody in the time that Moses led the children of Israel there was one that that was Moses the rest of them just followed the message see some of them tried to raise up to impersonate it and God said separate yourselves and just swallowed them up see now but he he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world God in you like he was in Jesus Christ because what all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church and you see that's God in you that's he's that in you glory to God oh what a Time Saints am this is going to be greater than anything we've ever possibly imagined this word is going to do things in our lives I you know I Ponder on these things and because listen we're we're human you're going to go home today and you're going to remember certain things that were said here today about God in Me God is God wants to work in my life God wants to do things in my life and you know sometimes I Ponder on those things and and my mind just starts to go off into an imagination and I start to see certain things and I wonder Lord what is going going to take place around our lives as this really starts to culminate you don't realize you're you're you're you're putting line upon line precept upon precept every time you come into church and you feed on the word of God and you hear these things these are these are profound words that are coming from the scripture but let me tell you things are going to start to happen around your life supernaturally if they're not already happening you will see Things Fall away all of a sudden son you'll wake up one morning and that oppression that mental oppression is gone you can't even explain it I I I felt so depressed I I I you know I I had no hope I didn't feel like anybody wanted to be around me you see your your your attitude in your own your own atmosphere that you create around your life is what you will attract because this is the law of God but feeding on the word of God and feeding on this Revelation and recog iing not only is he in in the church he's in you he wants to be a part of your life your everyday life when when you pray it just it just gives you more strength things are going to start to happen around our lives and we are going to see things like we've never seen before God has to do it he's going to do it Saints otherwise we will fall right back into the world from where we came but it's been 30 years now that I've been serving the lord and all I can tell you is that this word has never been more real to me than it is right now because he's doing this work he's doing this thing he's the one that's bringing the body together he's the one that adds to the church I'm not afraid of who comes into the church God brings them God adds God takes away it's as simple as that let the Lord Bring It's the Lord that adds to the body it's the Lord Lord that feeds his own my sheep hear my voice I don't expect them to hear Danny's Voice I want him to hear his voice speaking to their hearts so that their lives can be changed amen praise God forever more God bless you Saints let's pray father Lord this Revelation on you being in us it's beyond us sometimes Lord we can't even put words to it and sometimes all we can do is just be quiet and just wait because things around our lives and circumstances and and and heartaches and broken relationships and financial pressure and all those things Lord sickness and all these things that batter us constantly Lord they they they try to overtake our lives but Lord there's a there's there's a reality in our hearts Lord that greater you're greater than all of those things and we believe it Lord not because we think we believe or because oh I'd rather believe that than believe no it's a reality it's something that that has changed us and it continues to live and manifest and cause us to search deeper to search the scriptures to search your word and to and to pray and to believe that Lord all these things that our burdens in our lives can be lifted you promised you said come unto me he that he that's heavy laden I'll give you rest Lord we're looking for rest father there's many maybe on on the on YouTube listening in father that need rest lord they're they're battered they're they're hurting Lord their family is is in crisis Lord there Lord won't you go to all these situations won't you meet the financial needs of the people Lord that need jobs Lord there's people that are that are in desperate need of work Lord because they believe your word they will hold and wait upon you father oh God won't you just come on the scene Lord and do and go beyond every possibility that's within our weak minds and do more abundantly than what we could even possibly imagine Grant it Lord we commit our lives and our souls and each of our families as we
