Amen. Praise God. Amen. Glory to God. I bring greetings from brother Christopher and sister Farida. They were in touch with us this week. They're in Trinidad uh on an extended um uh vacation with family, with friends. Um they're dealing with a couple of uh funerals. Sister uh um Shirley, Brother Christopher's previous wife who passed.

Just keep him before the Lord. um pastor of a church there in Trinidad. We know him. He's a wonderful brother. Um having some issues in the hospital right now. So, we'll continue to remember him in prayer that the Lord will touch him and restore him. Amen. Praise God. I just want to thank everybody again um that uh stood at their post of duty last weekend to make the the meetings uh the wonderful success that they were. Amen. How many enjoyed those meetings this you just you just can't you just can't um say enough of what the Lord did did for our young people. Amen. And um I believe that uh uh everybody anybody that was that was present last weekend in any of the services they know uh they received it was an atmosphere where all things were possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If if you come into that atmosphere with expectation you could have received a tremendous blessing. Amen. Praise God. So thank you everybody for stepping into your positions. You made me very proud as the pastor of this church to see how you treated the people, how you served the people, showed respect under the people, and um put them first. And I believe that anytime that we host guests in the house of the Lord here, we should do that. Amen. And um I'm very grateful for that. And uh God bless you each and everyone. you've just really uh placed a a great blessing upon yourself for just being here and supporting and doing everything that you did. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. So, uh, Brother Diggs, you know, um, and I've heard from other people, too, you know, just how wonderful the services were. People just rejoicing still. Um, you know, uh, Brother Diggs said that this one is going to go down in history. He says, "Brother," he says, 'You know, uh, for for for the that kind of an atmosphere to be in the meetings, it takes the faith of the people &gt;&gt; to bring God into the house. Amen. To pull that word and that that anointing down and to meet the needs of the people. Amen. Praise God. So, he he really enjoyed it. He says, you know, God bless all of you that um were so kind and so good to him. He really appreciated that. Amen. And um you know I trust that everybody received their portion. Praise God. But you know um last week we were in preparation for these meetings well for many weeks. And last week, you know, we we canceled the Wednesday night service and we had a prayer meeting and, you know, the Lord just led me to, you know, to to pull out some scriptures and uh, you know, just to to dig deep um with the Lord to pour out for these young people and for us on the weekend that he would just show himself and declare himself. And I'm telling you, God vindicated his word in a dramatic and wonderful way. You can just put up the next slide. This was um the scripture that that we used when we were praying for brother Diggs and we used different scriptures but this one was the one that that the Lord led me to. It said also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us? Then said I here I am send me. And so the thought that I brought in the prayer meeting was, you know, brother Diggs is the chosen vessel that God is going to use. And he's he's yielded himself. He's surrendered himself to come and to minister his uh you know, his ministry and the word of God into the hearts of the people. And my God, you know, on Sunday, this was the scripture that he took. And he says, "If not me, then who?" Right? and showing that, you know, that God was was showing that that that he's got a people that he's raising up in these last days, uh, especially amongst our young people to receive a word and to go out and live that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. If not me, then who? Praise God. And so, if you'll remember, you can go to the next slide. You know, we prayed for for the young people and one of the things we were praying for was, you know, that that they're going to receive the word of the Lord on that weekend. And they're going to need courage. They're going to need to have the confidence to go back out there and and deal with the enemy and and uh and overcome because, you know, you come into that atmosphere and, you know, you surrender and you rejoice. And a lot of young people were just, you know, coming up and saying, "Oh, brother, you know, some came to me and says, "Can we c can you host meetings like this like every 3 months, brother?" You know, like a group of young people. And I said, "Well, you know, you know, you're going to have to fast and pray and really, you know, uh, go to the Lord and if he if he wants something like that, well, let's see what he'll do." But I don't know about that. But anyways, you know, uh but but the whole thing was that, you know, the Lord would strengthen them when they get back out there, &gt;&gt; you know, and and have to deal with the situations that God would expose because that's what God does. He brings you into the house of the Lord. He exposes what needs to be delivered from your life. And so the scripture was, "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage." Joshua was a young man that was taking the word of the Lord at in his day. Amen. be be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee, whethersoever thou goest. And we prayed for our young people and we took about maybe five, six scriptures, but then I put up this slide in the prayer meeting, the next one, and it's David holding the head of Goliath. And if you remember on Sunday, Brother Diggs was walking like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was he was showing that, you know, you need to be courageous. You need to be able to take the head of the enemy off whatever situation, whether it's some drug, you know, controlling your life or some some pornography or or or some kind of a of a of a of a stronghold in your life, you need to go back out there and remove the head off of that enemy. Amen. And so I believe that the Lord really poured out and I believe our young people can take this and and and let it be a stepping stone in the direction of where he wants them to go um so that he can use our young people in a mighty way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so we certainly um had a tremendous time and we certainly appreciate the Lord doing what he did for us, giving us um two baptisms, Sister Sarah uh Hope and uh Brother Jesse Mitchell. Amen. That the Lord continue to move on their lives. You, you know, as a village, we need to pray for them. We need to we need to support them. Uh we know that um it's not easy especially in this generation to stand for the word of God. Amen. So we want to thank God for that and we want to thank God for the fruits that he provided for us. Amen. Praise God. Let's go to the word of God. Let's all stand. How many has a request this morning that they want to bring before the Lord and and uh say Lord remember me. Remember this. Remember this person. Remember uh Lord my finance. remember everything. Father, we're so grateful, Lord, that um we can truly know that you're present with us, Lord, and that you're mindful of our needs. And Lord, that you want to speak to us. You you want to inspire our hearts to to have the courage to face the life that we are living here in these human vessels. Father, as long as we're here, we're going to need to overcome. And Lord, we are uh this is why we come here. This is why Lord, we we assemble ourselves because we've come into a love affair with you because you have been mindful of us. You are constantly making a way for us. Your your uh your love goes beyond human understanding. And Lord, how is it that you speak to us? Through your word. You you raise a standard. you. Faith cometh by hearing. And Lord, uh, all I can do, Father, is surrender this vessel to you this morning that you would just come and and have your way and and speak and inspire the hearts of the people, Lord. Open their hearts, open their minds. You know where each and every one of us are at right now, this morning, right here at this time in our lives, Lord. Lord, last weekend was wonderful. We rejoiced in your presence, but this is a new week. This is a new day. This is a new challenge. This is the hour where we have to still stand and and and take what you have given us in the word of God for this hour and and be the living manifestation of that word in a generation that's in in absolute turmoil and that's falling apart. Lord, give us what we need, Father, that we can only do and come back and say one thing. All the glory is yours, Father. &gt;&gt; And we will never fail but to give you praise and honor in all that you are doing. Bless, strengthen, heal, encourage, correct, edify, do everything in our midst this morning, Lord. We so appreciate it in Jesus name. Amen and amen. God bless you. Let's go to our scripture. Um today we're going to continue on the purpose of God. This is part two. We're going to be looking at manifesting your purpose. You know, um it's it's it's very um uh clear that God has a plan and that God has uh had a plan right from the beginning before the foundations of the world. And that plan has to do with man. Has to do with you and me here in on this earth in this dimension. Amen. And we want to know how we fit into that plan and how it is that we are going to manifest our purpose. Amen. Praise God. And so, uh, let's go to the next slide. Our scripture reading comes from Isaiah chapter 60, um, and verse 1. Amen. Praise God. Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people. Gross dark, meaning that it it's it's covering the entire earth. It's it's covering all the people. It's so dark. But the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee, &gt;&gt; and the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and the kings and kings to the brightness of thy rising. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessings to the word of God. You may be seated. Amen. Praise God. Let's play that. Um, I I uploaded a video. I'm I'm not sure. Did you uh managed to get that video uploaded on Shine Your Light. Amen. Turn off the lights here on the platform. You can leave the front ones, but all the lights on the platform, turn them all off. You need some volume. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Amen. Amen. Praise God. And so from the video there, we see that that that a light has come to you and now you are a reflection of that light. We will come to realize, you know, after this service here that God has placed within you an attribute that at an appointed time and season will come to life. And there's only one way that that attribute will come to life. And that will be by the word of God, the light of God's word shining upon you here in this dimension. And that light awakening and piercing the darkness around your life in order to bring that light that you are into manifestation in these last days. Amen. Where gross darkness is over the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the amplified version here from the scripture that we just read. It says here, "Arise from the depression and prostration in which circumstances have kept you." you're under certain conditions and you're living a life and you've been brought up under a certain atmosphere and maybe under, you know, some generational influences upon your life and and and they are restrictions that have been placed upon your life. But but when Jesus comes and the word for this day, the light for this hour comes and it crosss your path, it starts to break all that darkness away from your life. &gt;&gt; Everything that that now stands in front or hinders the word of God in your life has to be broken and and and moved aside. Amen. But it's kept you. But it's saying rise to a new life. Amen. You could be living on this earth for 10, 15, 40, 50, 60 years and you've been living a life where you're just miserable. You know that your only hope is is that you know maybe there's something beyond this life because this life has just been a life of heartache, a a life a life of of trial and temptation and heartbreak and all kinds of situations. Amen. But but when Jesus crosses your path, when the word of God, the light of this hour crosses your path, whatever condition you're in, it's going to bring life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that light is life. Amen. Glory to God. He says, "Shine. Be radiant with the glory of the Lord for your light has come." &gt;&gt; It's his light coming to you. And now you become the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's your light. It's his life on you. Amen. For your light has come. Amen. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth and dense darkness. All people, but the Lord shall arise on you. &gt;&gt; Now, we know he's talking to Jerusalem here, but we know that Israel always types the bride. So, so I'm speaking to the bride this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know we know the condition that Israel is in. And if you look closely at at at the circumstances around us and where Israel is right now and the and the condition of Israel and the and the armies and the wars and the and the great battles that they're fighting right now, taking out some of the some some of the heads of Hamas and taking out some of these these evil leaders that that are that are trying to destroy the nation of Israel. Amen. I want you to know that those same powers spiritually are against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Trying to take your life, trying to keep darkness in your life, trying to hold you down, keep you in a in a mental state, in a mental condition where you are absolutely uh uh useless in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want to we want to break out of that darkness. Amen. Praise God. Behold, he says, "But the Lord shall rise upon you, and his glory shall be seen on you." &gt;&gt; Listen, if you're a Christian in this hour and you've come in contact with this light, &gt;&gt; it's got to show in your life. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that that that that that you've received the word of this hour and and you're miserable more than you're happy. You're not the kind of person that people want to be around because something is missing in your life. Amen. It says here, you know, um uh uh the glory shall be seen on you and nations shall come to your light. You should be the kind of person that people want to come to. You should be the kind of person that that attracts people into your life, &gt;&gt; not push people away, &gt;&gt; not have a starchy attitude, not have a a, you know, a fire in hell attitude. We're way down the road, saints. &gt;&gt; This is not the hour to have that kind of an atmosphere around our lives. Amen. Praise God. Listen here. He says, "And and and the kings to to the brightness of your rising, you're going to rise up and and there are going to be people that are going to recognize that you're different. There's going to be people in your in your workplace. There's going to be people of influence out there that are going to see certain aspects and a character on you that is going to reflect prosperity. It's going to reflect the joy and the strength of the Lord in your life. Amen. He says, "Lift up your eyes round about you and see. They all gather themselves together. They come to you. Your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried and nursed in the arms. Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill and tremble with joy. I I just want to stop there for one second. Many many of us have lost our joy. &gt;&gt; But you know what the scripture says? The scripture says that the joy of the Lord is our strength. &gt;&gt; What does it mean by that? It means that the joy of your relationship with the Lord should be expressed in your life. like like you know like we've been saying you should be testifying to the people about how wonderful it is to serve God. People are missing joy in their lives because something has has has come and and and and infiltrated your life in a way that it's taken your attention off the word and placed it on these situations, these these maybe a broken relationship, maybe you know something that happened in your past while you were, you know, growing up. you young people, you know, you got to let go of certain circumstances because the joy of the Lord is something that you that that you need in order to have strength to overcome in this day and in this hour. &gt;&gt; You can't be a Christian that's that's miserable, has no joy. Guess what? If you got no joy in the Lord, you got no strength. And how you going to overcome situations without his strength? &gt;&gt; Remember, the Holy Ghost is the ability to overcome anything that the enemy tries to bring your way. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost once it's made contact with you, it brings a joy unspeakable. Amen. But the joy of the Lord is our strength. Something has sabotaged your joy. Amen. a hurt, a persistent sin, you know, something that you just it's there, you know, it's there, you just keep letting it stay there. &gt;&gt; You you figure, oh, well, you know, I you you try to justify this, justify that. You need to take its head off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then you will notice all of a sudden the joy of the Lord starts to come back into your life. &gt;&gt; And when you've got joy, you've got confidence. When you've got confidence, you've got an atmosphere around you that attracts people to the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Maybe some guilt, maybe other people's opinions. We're not interested. You need to kick those things out and get back to your relationship with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Make the word your absolute. &gt;&gt; Back to your first love. Amen. Glory to God. And it continues to say, "At a glorious uh deliverance and be enlarged because the abundant wealth," and he uses in here the Dead Sea. And you know, I looked into that a little bit. And did you know that there's, you know, it was called the Dead Sea and it, you know, you couldn't swim in it, you couldn't drink it, you couldn't do anything with it until they discovered that there's more minerals and and and uh and wealth in the Dead Sea that they're comparing it that they could draw so much wealth out of the Dead Sea that it would compare to three times the US economic financial power. &gt;&gt; We're talking trillions here. Amen. Why? Because God is showing us that that that when we come when when when our time comes, we are going to shine with prosperity. &gt;&gt; We are going to shine with abundance. &gt;&gt; We are not going to be a a people that's that's been defeated. We're a people that have overcome, that have received what God has in in in store for those that recognize the word and the light for their day. Amen. Praise God. It goes on to say that you know that um that unto you shall the nations come with treasures. A multitude of camels from the eastern tribes shall cover you. Jerusalem, the young camels of Midian, of Epha, all the men from Sheba once who once came to trade shall shall come bringing gold, frankincense. But notice it didn't it didn't mention myrr. Why? Because this is not about death. This is about resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is going to bring forth a rapture. &gt;&gt; This light that we're that we're accepting and we're receiving now is going to is going to change you. It's going to transform you. It's going to take you from this dimension into heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Amen. Praise God. That that part we're not interested in. Amen. Glory to God. And so here, let's let's um let's go to the next scripture here. Um Ephesians chapter 1 verse 3-5 says, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." Now my purpose in taking this scripture is because I want to emphasize hath. Now listen, God is going to manifest his purpose in your life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Everybody agree with that? Because you can't stop the heaven and earth will pass away, but my word shall not pass. &gt;&gt; It will accomplish that which it has been sent forth to accomplish. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want you to notice he said hath blessed. Amen. Hath chosen us in him before the foundations of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. having that means past having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Christ Jesus to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. I want you to notice here that your manifestation and when your manifestation is going to come and be and and fulfill God's purpose. I want you to know that God already prepared that attribute &gt;&gt; everything that that that God desires for you to express in this age because you are the expression of the word when you receive the light. &gt;&gt; You become the light. &gt;&gt; Right? We saw the video shine. Let your light shine. Amen. So, so here now I want you to know that this is not something that that that is going to be, you know, happen now and well, let's see what we can do. Let's see if I can overcome these situations in my life. I want you to know that he hath already predestinated your purpose, your manifestation, your time, your season to come into the light of God's word. This is not something that's going to be by accident. This is not because you answered an altar call. This is not because you decided to join this church. This is because unto you it has been given to know the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery of God uniting with man. God's desire to take and possess you and reflect himself through you. Amen. Everything that will ever be already was in the mind of God. When he saw you in his mind before the foundation of the world, he saw you right here, right now in this meeting tonight. Today. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw me delivering this message in season because he has a purpose in his word being being delivered in a certain time and season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody's got Listen, everybody's got a ministry. The five-fold ministry is made up in in in five different folds. Amen. My ministry is a little bit different. I'm I'm not I'm not like like I can't be brother Diggs. I can't be brother Tim. I can't be Pastor John Simon, our previous former pastor. I can't be brother Phillip. I can't be brother Emmanuel. Because there's aspects of the word that God wants to bring out in a time and in a season that is going to meet your particular need. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's going to use the fivefold ministry to feed and to deal with all those areas of our lives. I really enjoyed the service on Wednesday night with brother Emmanuel. Amen. Praise God. Glory to God. Don't you judge. You let the Holy Spirit bring out what it is that's in that that attribute &gt;&gt; because every attribute is not going to be clones. &gt;&gt; We're not clones. We are individuals, sons and daughters of God. All you got to do is look out there at the variety of plants and flowers and colors and the things that God has created in his glory that that that all things were created by him and they exist by him. &gt;&gt; And then you think that you're going to be like anybody else? &gt;&gt; No. I look at every one of you and I see a difference &gt;&gt; in every single attribute of God &gt;&gt; and God has a way of speaking and and delivering his word to those attributes at the right time in the right season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So in due season his his predestinated will comes into manifestation. This is the hour for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God in bride form. &gt;&gt; She is going to be an exact an exact uh uh presentation of Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection. She will have his abilities. She will have his love. She will have his patience. She will have his peace because she is reflecting him. Amen. Praise God. So, our predestinated purpose is to be the body of Christ, the body in this end time age. And that's why it's called the bride age. We're no longer in the Leodysian age &gt;&gt; in the church. &gt;&gt; We've we've moved on. God is now calling a bride out of the church age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Actually, he's calling a bride out of the message church. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how that's how honed in this is this is getting, saints. &gt;&gt; This is not going to this is not going to stop. And and God is not going to be bottled up. God is not going to be placed in into a a certain uh doctrine because that's the thing about man that man always wants to denominate and and take control of the word and say if it's not this way then it's then it's you're lost. &gt;&gt; No sir, that's not Jesus Christ. It's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He does not operate that way. Amen. Praise God. We need to rise and shine because it's our time now. And Paul has told us that God hath he hath he hath already blessed us. You're already blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're already called. &gt;&gt; You're already predestinated. You're already uh you know uh prepared in the eyes of God. Everything that you need is in you. It just needs to be manifest. &gt;&gt; That's what God's purpose is in giving you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Let's go to the next slide. In John 8:12, it says, "Then Jesus spake again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life. &gt;&gt; So what do we understand here? That when you receive the word for your day, it brings life. &gt;&gt; It brings a life. &gt;&gt; It brings a change of a new life. You cannot remain the same way. There's absolutely no way that you're going to remain the same. just go back and look at your experience. And if you haven't had that lifech changing experience with Christ, then you're still on the journey. If if if the things of the world and the cares of this life h are are are still covering over and and your life and the the purpose of your life doesn't include first Jesus Christ. And you young people, whether it's whether it's a a career, something that you're looking to, you know, down the road, if the if the purpose of God has come into you, which is the Holy Ghost, by the way, that's God's purpose. That's why he gives it to you, so that you can live his will, his purpose. And so, if you've received that, then your plans got to line up with his purpose. &gt;&gt; It can't take you away from the message of the hour. No, &gt;&gt; it's got to bring you closer to the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; It's got to it's got to cause you to dig into the word, listening to the prophet, listening and reading the messages. Uh uh uh you know, getting into the um seals and and and the seven church ages and having an understanding of why God sent a prophet in these last days, the purpose of it all. That's what the Holy Ghost will do. It will bring you back to the word of God. It will take you out of the darkness and it will reflect the light of life &gt;&gt; which is the life of Christ. Amen. Let's read our quote here from brother Brandham from the message shalom. He says that son which is the light is the word of God. In the beginning God said let there be light. When God said, "Let there be light," life came into existence. &gt;&gt; Without light, there's no life. And when the manifested word of God, when the word of God was manifested, there was light. God spoke it, what if he didn't manifest? Then it wasn't light yet. And so, if you're not manifesting the word, then you haven't had the light turned on. You haven't met the man that can turn on the light yet. Amen. But when he spoke it and then it was manifested, vindicated, his word was vindicated, light come into existence. Amen. And that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is vindicated, God's written word vindicated, then it shows life, &gt;&gt; light. &gt;&gt; It brings forth a life. under the revealed word of this hour. Now you are reflection in this generation of what God is doing today. &gt;&gt; That's why we always, you know, we always say, have you recognized your word for the day that you're living in? Right. &gt;&gt; Everybody's praising Jesus for what he's done in the past, what he's going to do, but they're failing to recognize what he's doing right now &gt;&gt; in your life, in your circumstances, in your family, in your home, in your health, in your wealth. You need to come into that personal relationship so that you can know that there's light that can that can shine in your life and and blow the darkness out of your life. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We find it in the church ages. He says here the uh uh God's written word vindicated then it shows light. It's a portion is lit or put out for each age. You see there's a portion of light that God is going to put out in each age. How do you think he puts that portion out? By sending you. by having you who he hath blessed who he hath predestinated uh to be to be adopted sons and daughters of God. Amen. To receive the adoption to receive the light for our day. Amen. The portion in each age, you're that portion. We find it in the church ages. We find it in the Old Testament ages. Each time that there come a time for a certain manifestation of the journey, there was a prophet that came to the earth and the word came to the prophet and he made that word live. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And when that word was identified, it reflected God. &gt;&gt; And there was the age and there was the light. And that's the way light comes today. Amen. God sent a prophet. God vindicated that prophet. &gt;&gt; He went around the world seven times. William Brandham vindicated that ministry. Turn the hearts of the children back to the light, &gt;&gt; back to the original word so that we could know what was truth. Amen. Every age had a portion. We can't take Moses's message. That was God's message for the Israelites back in the days when he was bringing them out of Egypt. We can't take Moses's message uh or we can't take and we can't take Noah's message because that was the portion of light that God gave Noah. &gt;&gt; But God has a portion of light that that he gave to a prophet in the 20th century by the name of William Branham. And that light reflected every son and daughter back to the original word &gt;&gt; because there was absolute confusion on the earth. &gt;&gt; Nobody knew what to believe. There was revival. They were they were they were ramping up all over the earth. But there was confusion because one said the evidence of the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues. Another one was that you've got to have the the the word of prophecy, that you've got to have, you know, uh a healing ministry. He's all of those things. And he'll always be those things. But we need to receive what light he has for us today so that we can get under that anointing, under that light, so that we can receive what we have need of to overcome in this age. &gt;&gt; You need to overcome in this age. I see a lot of people living miserable. &gt;&gt; They've lost the joy of their strength. They've lost the joy of the Lord. They've lost the joy of their salvation. You don't lose your salvation if God gives it to you. You can never lose it. But you can live miserable. &gt;&gt; You could be in confusion. &gt;&gt; You could be in a in a message church wondering, "Oh, this is just all law. We got to do this. We got to do that. It's all this, do this, do that." That's all you're hearing. But when you come to the light of this message in this hour, Jesus Christ is saying, "Heim whom the son of man sets free." And then he gives us the keys. &gt;&gt; And he says, "You now have the keys. &gt;&gt; You you go out and and and whatever you loose shall be loosed. &gt;&gt; Whatever you bind shall be bound." &gt;&gt; Because he wants to give you that light now to be the reflection in this age and in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of Malachi 4 came for one purpose. To shine the light on the word and to introduce the mighty angel to the church of this age, the bride. Amen. Praise God. And that's why it's so important to understand the opening of those seals, the opening of the word, the mighty angel that has come down that is now in control of this church. &gt;&gt; He's the one that leads the church. It's not led by Voice of God International. &gt;&gt; It's not led by some, you know, great preacher who's got a great big following who has thousands of people following him online and and millions of people whatever YouTube hits and oh, look at this. this person. Listen, I can tell you right now, message churches and message ministers, even if they get 50,000 hits on YouTube, there's people out there with a million hits. The hits don't mean nothing. &gt;&gt; It comes back to the word. &gt;&gt; It comes back to the reality of what God is doing in this day. &gt;&gt; And it's never been a big crowd. It'll never be a big crowd. &gt;&gt; It'll never be a huge church. &gt;&gt; It's not going to God never did it that way. He's never done it that way. Amen. Praise God. He just sends a little portion of his word to reflect his light for that particular age. And they start to now reflect that word. Glory to God. And that's the way light comes. Amen. Praise God. Let's read our next scripture. Amen. We're just um we're going to read here from the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Chapter 13. Because I want I want you to see here how how the word comes in its day. Like you know, they all went to the upper room. They all received the Holy Ghost. And now their ministries went forth. Amen. And here we are today. And you know when people ask me, brother Danny, you know, or Danny, you know, like, uh, what do you believe? I said, well, you know what? The best way to kind of describe it is, um, if you if you get some time, you read the book of Acts and you you see what the Holy Spirit is doing because it's not the acts of the people, it's the acts of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; in the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we are kind of a continuation of that same church. So what you see in there is what you're going to get from me, &gt;&gt; you know. So if you really want to know more, then you know, then I'll get into baptism with them. I'll get into, you know, have you received the Holy Ghost and and so forth. But here now, let's look at, you know, how how this all evolves here. Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you. Now, they're talking to the Jews here, okay? They're boldly speaking out to the Jews and because they've received the Holy Ghost. They've received the message of the hour. And but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we're going to turn to the Gentiles. And so, this message that you and I are now uh you know, bearing light to is for the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; It is for the Gentile church. It's for it's for your friends, your families that are Gentiles. You know, now you don't know where attributes are going to have ended up. They could have ended up in a Muslim home. They could have ended up in a Buddhist home. They could have ended up in all kinds of different religions and teachings. And that's why we don't we don't differentiate people when we're testifying to them about the word and the light of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just let it reflect. We we we we we give our testimony. We let the light we we we tell them that how joyful we are in serving the Lord Jesus Christ and that he's our savior. Amen. And so for so for so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, "I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles." You're a light. &gt;&gt; We are lights. &gt;&gt; We are reflecting the word for our day. Amen. Glory to God. thou and and that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. And now listen. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad. But pay attention. And glorified Paul and Barnabas. No, they glorified the word. &gt;&gt; You see, it's recognizing the word. People are people are bringing this message in such a way that all they're doing is they're they're they're putting message tracks into the people's faces say William Brandham William Brandham William Brandom William Brandham there's a lot of people that recognize William Brham but now they've gone off into another sphere and all they want to hear is William Brandham all they want to hear is the tapes. All they want to read are the tracks. They don't need anything else. They don't need present light. They don't realize that the light is moving on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. They don't realize what God is doing in this hour. Let's read on here. He says in Galatians 1 11-13, he says, "But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached unto me is not after man." &gt;&gt; We're not interested in man's teachings here. He says here, "For I neither received it of man, &gt;&gt; neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; What what happened to Revelation? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. You you just listen to the tapes. &gt;&gt; You just you just you just you know, you say it the way he said it. &gt;&gt; Like, listen, I'm not coming against anybody here. I want you to understand the Holy Spirit is going to exp Listen, we're walking in light. &gt;&gt; And if we're walking in light, then the darkness is going to flee around us. &gt;&gt; And we're not going to be bound by by by by darkness. Amen. Praise God. Listen, I'm reading quotes from William Branham. &gt;&gt; So don't think that I don't believe &gt;&gt; what he said. I believe everything he said. I also believe that he was a man under an anointing of a prophetic ministry and that he was also a man of like passion and that he was also a man that had to grow in revelation just like you and me. &gt;&gt; Cuz when he came to the seals, he he says, "This is a new book." &gt;&gt; He says, "I would have messed this whole thing up. &gt;&gt; I would have I would have preached something completely different if I hadn't received this intervention in my life. It's just like you and me right now. We're right in the same place. We've come to a place where this is a new Bible to us &gt;&gt; when the Holy Ghost comes upon you. This word comes alive. &gt;&gt; It's not it's not voice of God comes alive. It's not it's not all these these message churches that come alive. It's Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry &gt;&gt; by the revealing of his word because it's not given by man. &gt;&gt; You're never going to receive this by man. And if somebody gives you a tape and says you got to hear this tape and by listening to this tape you're going to be converted. I'm not saying you're not going to get converted. I got converted. I heard the first message that I heard was Hebrews series. Brother William Branam preaching on the Hebrews series. It didn't attract me to him. Something was pounding on the inside of my heart &gt;&gt; that I didn't understand. But then it was when I come into this church and I come under the ministry of John Simon who had the anointed light in his day was preaching the word for the hour. &gt;&gt; Was pointing us always back to the word. &gt;&gt; I fell in love with the word. &gt;&gt; The word became a reality to me. &gt;&gt; Everything was the word. I would be fellowshipping on the word. I would be fellowshipping on on the anointing, on the spirit, on the the ability of what God could do in my life because he delivered me. &gt;&gt; He set me free. &gt;&gt; Until you come to that place, you can't even see the prophet. &gt;&gt; You won't even recognize what he's really done in this hour. &gt;&gt; You'll just become another parrot &gt;&gt; that'll just quote what he says. Oh, no, brother. Just say it the way it says. Oh, you don't really need a pastor. You don't really need, you know, you No, no, no. The five-fold ministry is good, but you know what? Put the tapes first. Oh, Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you are not walking under that kind of a of an anointing in your life? &gt;&gt; Because you know what that you know what that kind of thing brings? It brings legalism. &gt;&gt; It puts law upon your life. All of a sudden, you're not the joyful person that you're supposed to be in the Lord. You don't have the strength to overcome the things because you're relying on some, you know, some teaching, some some, you know, uh uh boundary that that you come under. And now, as long as you stay into that boundary, you're safe. You got to come out of that. You got to come and go beyond the camp. Amen. Praise God. He says, "For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it." But he goes on here and he says, next slide, he goes, "And profited in the Jews religion above many my equal in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers." What he's saying there is that he became like a like a a a smart theologian, smarter than most of the other theologians. And there's people that can outquote you, me, and everybody else on this message and out quote the prophet and bring up quotes just like that. Oh, no. The prophet said this. Nope. The prophet said that. No, brother, you're off. The prophet said this. No, he became so much like that. But he's saying that that now he says, "But it pleased God." Now watch. Now watch here. This I love this. When I came to this, I was rejoicing. &gt;&gt; He says, "But when it pleased God, &gt;&gt; oh my goodness." Listen, you might be sitting in a certain condition here this morning. I don't know whatever it is, but listen. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, &gt;&gt; he separated you from your from your your your human understanding, your human experience, &gt;&gt; your your human birth. He's talking about your human birth here. He says he says separating me from and called me by his grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. To reveal his son to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; In &gt;&gt; me. &gt;&gt; You mean in you? &gt;&gt; There's something in you that needs to be revealed to you. He didn't say Paul Paul didn't turn around and say that, you know, until he revealed his son to me. No, in me that I might preach him among the heathen. Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood. [Music] All of a sudden now, I don't care what anybody says. &gt;&gt; I'm coming under the headship of the word. &gt;&gt; I'm coming under the leadership of the word. &gt;&gt; I want to know what God is doing in my day. Now, I'm not interested in in man's teachings. I'm not interested in the denominational teachings. I'm not interested in all these different teachings of of new age and understand. No, no, no, no, no. He revealed himself in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't take that out of me. &gt;&gt; You cannot remove that from me. &gt;&gt; It's something that that I know that I know. And you got to get to a place where you know that you know. &gt;&gt; It's no longer you. It's that's why the scripture says Christ in you. Your hope of glory. &gt;&gt; No hope outside of that. It's got to be Christ in you. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But here, listen next. He says, brother Bram says, "Our heavenly father, we now bring to you every hand that's up everywhere and let the Holy Ghost of God bring to them the rhythm of the word and its truth. You want the rhythm of God's word, you want the Holy Ghost, you need to you need to listen to you young people. If there's one thing that you want and you you forget about everything else, if you're not satisfied yet, if you haven't come to a place, and I'm young people, I'm talking everybody. Because there a lot of people in this place, they don't got joy. They need it to be restored. That's why David, when David cried out and said, "Lord, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation." He wasn't talking about my salvation. Restore unto me my salvation. No, the joy of my salvation. You're already saved, but you're missing out on certain things. Amen. Praise God. The Holy Ghost has all those things to bring you back into the rhythm and its truth. And they are to be molded now into sons and daughters of God. And they are to be the reflecting of the light of God upon the earth. &gt;&gt; They are to be manifested word. manifested word that men and women are to live the way Jesus lived and to believe every word of God and live by it like he did. And so a lot of people, you know, when they say, you know, uh um you know, live like like Jesus lived, how do you live like Jesus lived? You know, you know, be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect. All of a sudden, you know, you're gonna take that. You might look at that and say, "Oh my god, I gotta be perfect." That's not what he meant. No, sir. Be perfect like Jesus was per Listen, when Jesus came to the earth, he says, "I do nothing lest the father reveals it to me." &gt;&gt; He says, "For this purpose have I come to manifest the light in a time of darkness. For that very purpose have I come." He didn't say that you had to be perfect. You'll never be perfect, but you can come under his headship and you can come under his purpose. And the moment that you come under that leadership, that purpose, that anointing, it changes everything. Jesus came to fulfill the purpose of the father. And if you receive the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost has a purpose to manifest in your life. &gt;&gt; And this is what has to surface in you. This is what is going to surface in your life. Don't worry about the mistakes because the purpose that's in you will override the mistakes. &gt;&gt; It'll take away the desire for those things. That's why you young people, if there's one thing you want, you want the Holy Ghost. You say, "Lord, give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost." If that's how you got to start, then let it be that way. Lord, let the that's that's what you were experiencing here on the weekend. There was a lot of young people that were experiencing the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Because when his presence comes, that's his presence. That's his spirit. That's a baptism of his presence. That's why you're It's like if you go into this tank over here and it's full of nice warm water and you get into that water, you're exper Oh, this feels good. Feels so nice. It feels good on my bones. I feel healing coming through my body. Hallelujah. You come out of the tank. You go back into the world and you're cussing and swearing. You can't even overcome your own mouth. &gt;&gt; But you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it is the ability of God &gt;&gt; in you to overcome the things that you need to overcome and get out of the way so that your life can get sanctified so that so that you know things that need to come out of your life. You know, you young people, you need these things because the baptism of the Holy Ghost, remember, made way for what? The Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; When that happens, everything changes. You're never the same. You can never go back to the way that you were. You might make mistakes, but you'll be right back. &gt;&gt; You leave the house of the Lord, you get upset with the deacon, next weekend, you're right back &gt;&gt; because you know that God is God. You know what you've experienced. You know what's inside of you. If they go out from us and they stay out, it's because they were not of us. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; We're not here to try and, you know, bring in as many as we possibly can. We're looking for the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Those that can receive the light in this hour. Amen. Praise God. And so, um, here he says, "And they are to to be reflecting the light of God upon the earth. They are to be the manifested word that men and women are to live the way Jesus lived and to believe every word of God and live by it like he did. Amen. Glory to God. Thank you Lord. The next slide he says here now we find that in each age when God said a certain thing thing would happen. Here come that man along and manifested that. That's what we've experienced and we're still experiencing it. We're still under that same uh you know way provided way on how God does and and and reveals himself and opens and manifests the word. And here come the man along and manifested that. Here come their people along and lived that. That was God himself living in the people because it was an answering of his word. God has a word for this day in this hour that I'm going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; She is going to reflect the perfect light of God's word. Not because she's perfect, but because he's perfect. &gt;&gt; When you receive a prophet and you receive his message, you're receiving the light of the age. Amen. And then you start to reflect that light. And now you are the reflectors of that light. And that's why if you can get somebody to believe you listen, if you've really received that light and you know where you stand, you know that he's a healer, you know that he's a savior, you know that that that he's peace, you know that you you you can stand on it and you go and you testify to somebody, I'll tell you that person knows whether you really believe it or not. And if that person looks into your eyes and they say, "This person really believes it. I can see it. I believe him." If you can get them to believe you, you can lay hands on the sick and they'll recover. &gt;&gt; Not because you have the ability to heal. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You're not testifying of what you can do. You're testifying of what you've got. &gt;&gt; You're testifying of his power. It's not I that doeth the works, but the Father, the anointing, the Holy Ghost that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. And so this process continues to unveil itself, people catching the light, reflecting the light, manifesting the light, other people recognize the light, and they come to the light. And all of a sudden, if there's a if, listen, if there's an attribute of God in there, if there's representation in there, just the same way that he got a hold of you, maybe he had to dig through a lot of dirt. You know, some people, you know, they had, you know, I I remember brother Mike, you know, few days, I don't know, maybe last week, he says, "Oh, Lord really worked took a long time with me." He had to get down underneath all of the all of the the the rocky places in our lives. Amen. Praise God. But once once that light shines on that attribute, life comes forth. It cannot it can never remain the same. It'll come into its manifestation. It'll start to reflect the purpose of God for the age. You will become the the the the the reflection of the word in your age. You can't help it. People are going to know that you're different. And if they spend enough time talking to you and listening to what it is that you've got, they'll realize, wait a minute here, this makes perfect sense. The problem with the people, you know, that that that get hard against you is because they're still fighting within themselves. &gt;&gt; They're dealing with their pride. They're dealing with all the things that they need to overcome. Amen. Listen, go to the next slide. John 3:19. He says, "And this is the com the the the the condemnation that light has come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light." Just like I was saying, you're you're you're you're reflecting light. You're bringing light to your family. You're bringing it to your friends. You're bringing it to your loved ones. And they love the darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. People listen, light always exposes darkness. Remember that. And people, they don't want to hear about, you know, oh well, you got to live that kind of way. Oh, you gota uh you you got to pay tithes. How much? Really? Wow. You know, like like I I I'm an executive, man. I make $300,000. You want me to give you 30? No. No. No. No. No. No. You know they no they haven't seen the light &gt;&gt; because the light is Christ in you. Your hope of glory. He ch he is your prosperity. He is your future. He is everything. Amen. He says for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light. Neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved. So what am I saying here? What's the word saying? You're not going to convert everybody. You're not going to you're not people are most people are not going to receive the light because it's a light for this age &gt;&gt; and it's not an easy light to accept and to receive. You've got to be you've got to be uh prepared ground for this kind of light. &gt;&gt; You got to be prepared to receive this kind of faith to cause your life to go into complete uh turmoil. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. So here now let's go to our next slide. We're winding this down now. We want to see here, you know that this darkness that is in the world, it's darkness that you have been given the ability to expose. Your testimony, your walk with God, your experience with the word is light. And wherever you go, whatever you do, you will expose darkness. Wherever you go, &gt;&gt; you're a shining light. But here, I want you to see here back in Genesis 3 where where God has has given us a clear understanding of what is going to happen in the last days. And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou has done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. And I will put amnity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. No matter what, the enemy is going to oppose us. Understand that. What do you think's going on in Israel right now? They are under constant bombardment because the world is actually going to turn against her. And the whole world is going to turn against the word. It It's already rejecting the word for their day. There's only a few that can receive the message of this hour, to receive this word, and to allow it to reflect in their lives and to be able to have the courage to stand in a world like this where where homosexualism and and gender identities are are commonplace. You can't speak out against it here, especially in Canada. all these rights of the people, a place where where where you know where the word where the word it condemns all those things. It doesn't line up with the word of God. And because you are a reflection of that light and its truth, you cannot expect to be so easily ex accepted. You know, you you got to be careful of of how you handle yourself as a Christian, as a son or daughter of God. to be respectful in the way that you communicate and and and bring this word of God. Amen. But it doesn't change the word. The enemy w was there at the beginning. He's going to be here at the end, but God has given us the light to expose all of that darkness. No matter where it comes and shows up in our lives, &gt;&gt; we're not to live in fear. &gt;&gt; Fear is another thing that steals your joy. Did you know that? Fear can steal your joy away when you're fearing this. Oh, I'm I'm I'm worried about this. I'm I'm so worried about my kids all the time. I Why don't you pray and place it into the hands of God? &gt;&gt; Why don't you trust God for all those things in your life instead allowing fear to control your life and and and and and take away your your ability to be effective in the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; with a confidence to stand and to shine this light in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; The enemy is going to try. He's going to do everything in his power to to but but there would listen the emnity is there between the two seeds. It was there back in the garden of Eden. Why do you think Cain killed his brother? Because Cain had the light of the hour. He had a revelation of what God required. It was a lamb. It wasn't fruit because he had received light on the coming of the Lord Jesus who would come many years down thousands of years down the road. God gave him the ability to recognize and so he was able to to to to please the Lord because he had faith. &gt;&gt; But Cain, the enemy, the one who will fight you, does not have the ability to receive revelation. Revelation is what has given you your confidence, &gt;&gt; your courage, your ability, &gt;&gt; the revelation of God in you, &gt;&gt; Christ in you. This is the hour that we're living in. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. And the Lord. And so here now, let's go to our next scripture. I want you to see here now in Romans chapter 16 verse 20. Notice what he says. And God and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under whose feet? Your feet. Your feet. You. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. God is telling us that he has given us the ability to put that darkness under our feet. &gt;&gt; The enemy shall not have control over our lives. You listen. If you've received the light of the hour and you're reflecting the light of the hour, that light is God himself. It's Christ in you. And everything you need to overcome is already prepared. It's already there. You just need to receive the light, reflect the light, and allow that light to be what he wants you to be. Listen, go to the next slide. John chapter 15:26-27. He says, "But when the comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the father, even the spirit of truth which proceedth from the father, he shall testify of me. You don't have to worry. When the comforter comes into your life, you it's just going to come to you. Whatever you have need of will come to you. and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning. Listen, like we said, he hath already predestinated you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When God was planning this whole plan of redemption, you were in his mind back then. That's what he's telling you here. You have been with me from the beginning. Jesus wasn't just talking to his disciples that were there. He was talking to the sons and daughters of God &gt;&gt; who were in the mind of God who were going to be reflecting light in this age &gt;&gt; that would be that would be a reflection of him that you were always there. He was going to send you the power the ability which is himself &gt;&gt; to come and take control so that you can manifest him and be the manifestation of this hour. the purpose of God for this day and this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Let's read our quote here. There's a man here that can turn on the lights. So life is only by the word of God made manifest. So you receiving this message is not just to tickle your ears. It's for you to receive it so that it can live. so that it can manifest. The word of God made manifest is life. It's going to produce a life in you. You're either going to have a life that's going to go right back out there into the world and live according to the world and you're going to be drawn to the things of the world and your all your all your your temporary joy is going to be in the things of the world without a word birth. That's what happens. Life comes only by the word of God made manifest. As long as it's just in the book like this, it still can be questioned. But when it's made manifest, then you see then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested. Then that is light on the word on you. Now you become a reflection of Jesus Christ in the present day that you're living in. Amen. See, that's what brings the word said so. And then when it comes to pass, that is life in light. Light bringing life. Light brings life. &gt;&gt; So if you've received this word, you receive the message of the hour, you got to produce a life. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a life in you. There's got to be a desire for the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That's what he does to you when you receive this light. And listen, he goes on here. Uh there's there's a man here that can turn on the light. He goes on, he says, "There's no two or three different lights. Let's get let's get rid of all the confusion, saints. We're not looking for two, three different interpretations on the word of God. No four or five different organizations. There was one light. There is not Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian. Christ is the light &gt;&gt; and the light is the life and the word manifested is the light of the hour. Amen. When you manifest God sent a prophet, when you manifest Malachi 4:5, when you manifest Revelations 10 1:7, when you start to manifest Revelations 8 uh Revelations 10 8-11, when you start to receive this word, which is what you've been commissioned to do, is to take this word and not only take it, but speak it, manifest it into the people's hearts. speak the word of God for this day and for this hour. Let them know that God sent a prophet. Let them know that the seals are open. Let them know these things because the Holy Ghost will guide them to the truth. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost coming into your life will only bring you back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. saints, you know, like I know my ministry is constantly trying to reach and to to testify of what of what God is doing in this day and in this hour. We need to be present truth Christians. &gt;&gt; Those that have a revelation of what God is doing right now. And we need to stand on one truth. There's not one, two, three different lights. We need to let the people know that the word of God is the truth. &gt;&gt; That there's a word to be manifest in this day and in this hour. Amen. Glory to God. Listen, go on here. Next slide. He's continuing here in things that are to be. He says, "The gene of life, the gene of your life, spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before it was even a molecule." See, you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God. And now you are expressed after his word has come in you. Hallelujah. Because you are a son or a daughter of God. Therefore, you get what I mean? Amen. See, you are in, you are now made, you are sitting in this church tonight, he says, but I'm telling you, you're sitting in this church today &gt;&gt; because your duty is to express God to this nation, to this people, and to this neighborhood where we associate. &gt;&gt; This is the message of the hour. This is the light of our day. &gt;&gt; This light has to manifest the purpose of God in you. &gt;&gt; You can't remain the same way that you are. You can't stay in the same condition that you are. You have to be under constant progress. &gt;&gt; You got to be on under constant e, you know, evolution. If you want to call it evolution, ev evolving into into a a manifested son of God that reflects Jesus Christ in the form of the bride, in the form of the church that that reflects the light of God's word, not some man-made teaching or oh, we are good neighbor ministries. Yes, we are good neighbor ministries here in Burlington, but we are a reflector of the word of God. We are reflecting the present truth for this day and for this hour. Amen. Glory to God. There is nothing more that we need than to receive the Holy Ghost for our day. And this is where we're going to continue uh next week. Amen. We're going to continue to uh look and to and to see what is the Holy Ghost because people are people are manifesting things thinking that it's the Holy Ghost, but they don't really realize what the Holy Ghost was sent for. And if you get a chance this week, go back and listen to the message. What is the Holy Ghost? Brother Brandham 1959. go back and listen to that message because there's a lot in there that Brother Brandham explains on what the Holy Ghost actually is and in this day and in this hour. And I'm telling you, there's people in this message, the majority of them are not recognizing what it is. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. Yeah. Well, let's see. Let's see what the Holy Spirit's going to reveal to us. Let the musicians come. Amen. Praise God. We want to know what what what the word is going to manifest in this day and in this hour. And when you come into the light of this day, it's going to manifest him. &gt;&gt; You can't you can't be reflecting you anymore. &gt;&gt; You will be seen on the outside, but there'll be something living inside of you that's that's that's uh moving everything else aside. All your priorities are are are changing. Listen, we're getting too close to that time, saints. God is God is perfecting this bride. How's he going to perfect it? By the five-fold ministry. God is going to God is going to draw things out of our lives that need to be rooted out of our lives. God's going to expose things in our lives that need to be exposed &gt;&gt; because this is the time where the light takes control and re and and starts to to to to uh scour out all the darkness in our lives. &gt;&gt; And if you have a true desire for the word of God, then you want darkness to leave you. &gt;&gt; You don't want to carry that that that burden anymore. You want the joy of the Lord. Don't you want the joy of the Lord back in your life? Don't you want to be living a a a victorious life for Christ? Something that where you know that that uh you've got it. You're not you're not guessing. You're not you're not just getting to church, you know, every Wednesday and every Sunday just getting there because you need to you need to get huffed up again or or or pumped up again or you know, you need you need to hear some. I'm not here to to pump you up. I'm here to to fill you with the word of God. Amen. Praise God. So that you can re so you can receive what God has for you. Amen. Let's I want to sing that song. I saw the light. What key is that in? Amen. Glory to God. I saw the light. I saw the light. No more in darkness. No more night. Now I am happy. Oh, praise the Lord. I saw the light.

I think it's a Sunday school chorus, but it applies to us. This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. Oh, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. Oh, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. I won't let Satan blow it out. I'm going to let it shine. Don't let Satan blow it up. I'm going to let it shine. Don't let Satan blow it up. I'm going to let it shine. Hide it under a bushel. No, we won't hide it under a bushel. No, I'm going to let it shine. Oh, hide it under a bushel. Oh, I'm going to let it shine. Hiding under a bush on the shine. Let it shine. This little light of mine. This little light of my mind. [Music] I'm going to let it shine. [Music] I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated for just a moment. Uh it's testimony time. We have a testimony. Is this Is this Natasha? Sister Natasha. Okay. Come. Come. And uh she'd like to give a testimony. So, praise the Lord. I can give a testimony this morning that God spoke to me. God not only spoke to me but further uh identified who I am. That's my testimony this morning. God bless you. God bless you saints. I just want to give God thanks for bringing me here today because I'm going to go back a little bit. When I had my first son 27 years ago, um I came home from the hospital and all was well. I was happy. Few days later, I found myself back in the hospital unable to walk for a week, paralyzed from the waist down. And from then, it's been like a real battle with my back. Been to the hospital several times. They did so many different things. They came to a conclusion there was nothing they could do. So I just kept kept on um trusting God, believing that in his time he will do it for me. Then it started with my knees. About two years ago, the doctor told me that um I'm going to need double knee replacement. So I say, you know what, Lord, I'm going to trust you and I'm going to wait on you. I'm not going to rush into the surgery. They wanted to set up a schedule for me to get a knee surgery and everything. But I trusted God and he say I'm just going to wait. And it's been a battle. Even when we have like the um washing of the saints feet, I have to use a chair because I cannot go down on my knees. Even this morning when I got up, I had to go stand under the hot water to run on my back just so I'll be able to walk to come here. But I didn't give up. Couple weeks ago, I went to the doctor and I had some X-rays done on my knees. I'll just leave that there for now. Coming up towards the meetings, I've been praying about the meetings and praying about different situations. And I said to the Lord, "No matter what, Lord, I will stand for you. No matter what, I would not give up. I will stand for you." And the devil heard that. and did the ever come in like a flood within the space of one and a half week. I had eight losses in my family. Eight people died at a certain time. I was afraid to pick up the phone in one day. My mom called me in the morning. My uncle daughter passed away. That really cut me deep because we did everything together. We grew up together. We did everything together. So that really hit home. Later around the evening, the phone rang again. And my phone don't usually ring like that in the day. Sometimes I have to pick it up to see if it's working. And I got a call again and it was my sister. My uncle's um um son passed away. So in one day, two of them. And within a space the space of one and a half week, nine people they just dropped down. I don't know what happened. But I kept on trusting God. I said, you know what, father? I said, no matter what, I would trust you. I said, "The Lord give and the Lord take. Blessed be the name of the Lord." He came up to the meetings and we had a wonderful time. Rejoice. We left here on my way home. I met some people below a tree fellowshipping and having fun and praising God. I turned my car around, went and parked it up and I joined them. We sang, we danced, we praised the Lord together. I went home. I got home and I was looking for my little cats everywhere. I couldn't find her. She fell to her death. The trials just kept on coming and coming. But I say, "Father, I would trust you." I cried because I was very attached to her. I cried. I went, I buried her. I came back. I said, "Father, you know why? The Lord give and the Lord take. Blessed be the name of the Lord." So the devil felt like that wasn't enough. He started attacking my back, attacking my knees, attacking everything. Then I remembered when I went to the doctor um couple weeks ago, the doctor said to me, I don't know why they said that you needed double knee replacements because I'm looking at this new X-rays and it's not showing that. So I give the Lord thanks for that. And I say, you know what, there is one thing I'm going to change. And I remember one of the brothers said couple weeks ago, the most dangerous Christian you can get is one on the knees. And that's why the devil came after me because before I was lying on my back and praying saying that I cannot go on my knees but I found a way. I put a bench in front of my um bed and I started kneeling on that bench and from there the attack started within within the as I said within a week and a half nine people because I changed the way I prayed. I went on my knees and I started praying and the battle kept on raging. But in all of that I found a way to go on my knees and to praise God. And I'm just want to encourage you, no matter what, get on your knees because a a Christian underneath is a dangerous Christian to the devil. So I want to give God thanks this morning. Even on my way here, I was dragging to get here. When I got in the basement, I had to start talking out and reminding the devil who I am. &gt;&gt; And I started talking out loud. And my daughter was looking at me like, you know, but I had to talk out loud and remind him and started claiming my healing. And before you know it, I was able to sit down. I'm able to walk properly. I'm able to come here and I'm just want to give the Lord thanks for great things that he has done. [Music] Amen. Well, I went to the enemy's camp and I took back what he stole from me. I took back what he stole from me. I took back what he stole from me. I went to the enemy's hand and I took back what he stole from me. He's under my feet. He's under my feet. He's under my feet. He's under my feet. Satan is under my feet. Again, one more time. Oh, yes. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] What stole from me? What sto under our feet? He's under my feet. Satan is under my feet. Amen. We're we're going to have the vision statement now. Is that okay? We're going to have uh Sister Peace and Sister uh Sarah Hope come up. And the last time these two were up on this stage, what a wonderful special they gave last Do you remember? Was that a wonderful special? Wow. Last Sunday. But God bless them as they come and do this for us. Our [Music] vision is to be a life-changing ministry transforming the world one person at a time. Our purpose is to bring people to Jesus for membership in his family, growing them into maturity, equipping them for ministry, to fulfill their life's purpose of glorifying God. &gt;&gt; We are changing lives forever. [Applause] Well, praise the Lord. So, what's your plan? How how have you got it all figured out? How you're going to go out tomorrow and be a light? Have you got got everything figured out? This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to do this. Is that Nah, forget it. That's not what we're about, right? But let's let the Holy Spirit interpret his word now. Right? Say, Lord, have your way with me. Amen. You interpret what was spoken today about me. You go and you interpret it and you will have incredible success. Well, there's a country far beyond the starry sky. Oh, there's a city where there never comes a night. And if we're faithful, we shall go there by and by. In that city where the lamb is the light. Oh, in that city where the lamb is the light. Oh, in that city where there come is no. I have a mansion over there and it's free from Oh, here we have our days of sunshine.
