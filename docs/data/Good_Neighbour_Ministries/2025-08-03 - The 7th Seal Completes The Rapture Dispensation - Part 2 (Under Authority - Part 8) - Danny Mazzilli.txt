Bless every officer, the deacons, the tris, the Sundays, the teachers, every aspect of the service. Oh God, we commit it into thy hand. Your word clearly says that you should bring offering and thighs to thy house. And Lord, this is the only thing that you gave us to test you with if you not open the windows of heaven to bless. Oh God, as the people are giving the offering and the thanks from the depth of their heart, may you bless everyone that giving Lord and those that you have the desire to give, bless their heart desire so that Lord, they will be blessed abundantly so that next time they can also give because we have that assurance that you said that you bless even more exceedingly and abundantly more than what the people can even think or imagine that's a God that we are serving, a God of abundance and we are so grateful that you can be associated with this mighty God. Thank you. Bless every aspect of the service, our pastor celebration. May everything go on perfectly well in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

You know, a church service is not a church service unless he's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unless Elijah's God is here with us. Amen. Praise God. And so, first of all, I want to welcome our visitors. I see we've got uh several visitors this morning. God bless you. Welcome into the house of the Lord. Amen. Um and I see another couple here. God bless you, my brother. And sister, I'm not sure uh your names, but um we certainly appreciate you being here with us. Amen. I see we have sister Saron's parents here with us from Germany. &gt;&gt; Welcome uh brother Joshua and sister Angelica. Amen. And I see brother Daniel's parents here. Is that brother Ian and sister &gt;&gt; Sherry? Praise God. Welcome. Welcome into the house of the Lord. And um we also have a special family that has arrived all the way from Africa. Praise God. Where's our brother Tongana and his family? Come, come forward. We want to welcome his precious wife, Sister Ruth, their children, um daughter, sister Bernice, their sons, brother Banayiah and brother Adil. Amen. He has been patiently waiting to have his beautiful family at his side. And wow, what a beautiful family. Amen. Praise God. Welcome, young man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Welcome. Welcome. You're Banaya. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Very nice to meet you, Sister Ruth. God bless you, my sister. Welcome. God bless you. And welcome, Bernice. So today we want to officially um you know brother Tong and I said brother my family has arrived and uh they are uh I'm handing them over to the ministry and to you as their shepherd and I was just happy to to receive that news and um at this time I want to pray with them and I want us to all pray together to welcome them into the family of God into the household of faith right here at the local body of Good Neighbor Ministries here in Burlington. And so, let us all bow our heads in prayer. We're dedicating them and also uniting them to this local body. Father, &gt;&gt; we are so grateful this morning, Lord, for the word that says that you add to the church. Man can try and add to the church. Man can do all that he possibly can to pull the people and draw them in, Lord. But when you bring them in, Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, it changes everything. It's a true genuine relationship. And Father, this morning we dedicate this family, uh, these children, Brother Tong and I and his precious wife, Sister Ruth. Lord, oh God, we dedicate them to your service right here at Good Neighbor Ministries. We unite them with this body of Christ. And Lord, we ask you to place them, uh, use them, position them, bless them, teach them, grow them, prosper them, Lord, in all that they all their financial requirements, all their needs here. Lord, may you do a great work in this family, Lord, as we dedicate them to your service and for your glory and for your honor in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; How wonderful to uh see the Lord um making a way for his children. And I know it's not easy, you know, when they come from other countries and they want to bring their families and it takes time and patience and money. And so we're grateful that the Lord made a way for our brother and um we look forward to um seeing how they grow within the ministry. He's really truly a wonderful brother and full of the spirit and we appreciate him very much. Amen. Praise God. I'm not Oh, brother John Simon. There he is. Praise God. And sister Desiree trying to hide from us, eh? Praise God. Welcome, brother John and sister Desire, our former pastor and uh still a very important element of this ministry. um the founder of this ministry um you know under the leadership of the Holy Spirit has truly um you know uh built a legacy for himself and I'm proud to be a part of that legacy. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we should all be proud to be a part of what God has done in in uh this part of the world right here in Burlington and uh Ontario. Praise God. So God bless you. If I've missed anybody, I see other visitors. Sister Louise, sister there. God bless you. Welcome into the house of the Lord. I see some others. Um, welcome. Praise God. It's good for you to be here. And, uh, you know, we had a a very nice time yesterday. Um, we went to, uh, uh, the family camp there that Brother Dale Langstaff set up. We went on Friday night. We had a service there on Friday night. uh the brother uh Junior um I believe his name uh uh brother Henry Jax Jr. from Jamaica. He ministered the word of God and uh took uh you know took the scripture um on uh God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love. Amen. And of a sound mind. and he ministered on how the bride, you know, should not be walking in fear but boldly walking with him. Amen. Praise God. And then we had a great time yesterday. Uh brother John Garrett from uh he's a minister under uh brother Paul Fontaine. He ministered a wonderful message um from the book of Jeremiah regarding my people will return unto me with their whole heart. Amen. uh dedicating ourselves back, allowing the Holy Spirit to take out those little things in our lives, you know, that that hinder our heart, you know, it was really a a wonderful blessing. And uh we were really blessed to be there. I thank God for brother um Jack. Amen. And brother Eugene, they were there as uh supporters. Amen. And uh it really was a blessing. Brother Dale, God bless him for what he does. He has a heart for the people. He desires to bless people, to uh to give and to do um what he can for the body of Jesus Christ. And I'll tell you, we were very well fed. I couldn't believe it when I was driving into his property. There was a hundred cows. And he says, "And brother, they bring forth a hundred cows every year. Those are all females." I said, "Praise God. I seen the baby calfs there." I said, "Wow, what an operation." You know, talk about a farmer for the for the glory of God. And so, may God bless him and prosper his uh his ministry and continue to use him uh for for his glory and for his honor. Amen. We want to continue to remember Sister Sheila as she's uh in in recovery mode after having the brain surgery. And I'm trusting um that she is going to be up here giving testimony of how God supernaturally did a a tremendous um uh operation on her and she's going to she's I talked to her this week. She's talking beautifully. She's talking like normal. She says, "Brother, you know, God truly has done miracles." Amen. And we believe in a miracle working God. So, let's continue to pray for our dear sister and um it's time for us to go to the word of God. How many's excited about the word? I trust that you came with an expectation. Sure, we're going to have some fellowship after. We're going to get together. We're going to have lunch. But right now, we're going to feast on the word of God. And I trust that if you've got a pull in your heart to receive from the Lord, he'll give you something. Amen. I believe that with all of my heart because this is not a a a a man ministry. This is this is a Christ in the present stage of his ministry. Amen. And so we just want to be vessels yielded unto him. And I trust that you will receive your blessing. Let's all stand as we go to the word of God. Amen. Let's pray. Father, as we change the order of the service now, Lord, we're asking that your spirit would come. Lord, as a man, I have studied, I have uh read and gone into the depths of your word to the best of my ability. And Lord, I know that my ability, I I I I feel uh unworthy most of the time, Lord. But I I can only trust in the in the gift and in the call and the the desire of the people and the needs of the people and that you will come and take control. Lord, anoint this vessel to speak words that will inspire the hearts of your children. Lord, we commit this service and all that are present. Lord, those that are listening in online, may they receive, may they be blessed, Lord. We give you praise and we give you all the glory in Jesus name. Amen. Praise God. And so um we'll read our scripture. It's from the book of Revelation. It's the same scripture we read last week, chapter 8 verse one. It says, "And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." Amen. You may be seated. and go to the next slide. So, um we've been talking on uh a series of being under authority that when we recognize the authority of God's word in our day and recognize what it is that God is doing in our day, then we come under that by by uh submitting ourselves to the word for our day just like every other age. It's this this is nothing new. every age. Just like when the reformation started back in the 1500s and John West or uh um uh Martin &gt;&gt; Luther, I'm sorry, uh Martin Luther caught the revelation that the just shall live by faith and he came under that to the point where he made it his supreme authority. It it it pulled him away from the Catholic Church. Amen. And today we've got Lutheran churches all over the world. Amen. Because he recognized his day and the message. But the word didn't stop there. It continued to progress. And so here we are here now in 2025. Um we've come through uh the reformation. John Wesley caught his part on on justification on sanctification. Amen. that uh you know that you got to just you can't just claim Christ and not have a a sanctified life. You know, I mean, we don't we don't claim our own righteousness. We claim his righteousness, but we come subject to his word where we allow the word to take control and have preeminence in our lives. Amen. And so, um, he recognized his day and then the Pentecostal movement was the was the was the spirit of God now coming down on the church to restore the gifts to the church. And and on Isuza Street there was a great outpouring of his spirit and it brought forth another revival which was the continuation of the reformation of the word of God. And then God sends a messenger to each one of those ages like he did with Martin Luther, like he did with John Wesley. And who does he send to the Pentecostals? William Branham. Amen. A messenger under a prophetic ministry to restore the the the word that had been scattered because there was there was uh so many different teachings on the word of God. But God says, "I will restore." Amen. and he restored the word back to the original faith of the fathers. Amen. Praise God. And that's what we're feeding on to this day. We are feeding on the original word of God. People ask us, "Well, what is Good Neighbor Ministries all about?" Well, we're a non-denominational church that is basically the continuation of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; And it's not the acts of the disciples. &gt;&gt; No, sir. It's not the acts of the people, but it's the acts of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; in the people that when Jesus said, "I will send you the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, and he will guide you into what? &gt;&gt; All truth." &gt;&gt; All truth. Amen. Not some of the truth, but all of the truth. &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. And so, this is what we are feasting on in this day and in this hour. the living mystical uh body of Jesus Christ. And so we were looking at this and we were looking at you know understanding our existence because what we've come to and I hope you've come to realize this through this series that we are we are living in realms of existence &gt;&gt; and that uh this is what has been uh going on right from the very beginning of time. Amen. Right from the very beginning, before there was time, God was was operating and and and producing realms of existence where we could actually understand who we were in that particular time and season. And when we were in God, we were his attributes. We were thoughts in his mind because he was the self-existent one right from the very beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he condescended this great plan of redemption which produced these realms of existence that we have been moving through, operating in and being influenced by. &gt;&gt; Amen. So these realms that are around us, you know, light, matter, time, the ether, the fifth dimension, which is the dimension of of death and hell. It's where it's it's a dimension where there's an there's a dark influence that's coming upon the people. And that influence is very strong in the land right now. And then we know of the sixth dimension which is the dimension of the redeemed. Those that receive Jesus Christ in their day under their dispensation and they die. Christians, they don't go to the fifth dimension which is death and hell. Amen. And I'm not talking about a burning hell. Our prophet made it very clear that that it wasn't a burning hell or an eternal hell. It was like in it was like in comparison because he actually was allowed to see it. &gt;&gt; He was able to break dimensions. Amen. That's what a prophet has the ability to do. That's why he could talk to somebody and tell them what the doctor said, tell them where they lived. He could see in another realm, in another dimension where there was no time or space, and he could look into yesterday and look into tomorrow. Amen. That's what a prophet has the ability to do. Praise God. And so, um, we see here that this this realm that we're living in right now is being affected by all these other realms. And then there's the seventh dimension. And this is the final, you know, part of this series that we're going to be, you know, finishing up on here. We're going to be looking at how the seventh dimension which you know if you go to the next slide it says it's it's it's the existence of God. It's where God exists. It's it's the place where it says here it says the seventh dimension is where God is. Amen. God dwells in the seventh dimension and it's just another realm. It's heaven is not a place that's a million miles away. Everybody, you know, they they look at heaven as being somewhere up there or they look at hell as being somewhere down there. I'm telling you that we are living in a dimension that experiences both heaven and hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of people, unfortunately, are living in a hellish existence. &gt;&gt; And when I say that, I don't mean it like in a in a in a you know, where there's all these monsters and everything else, but they're living underprivileged lives. They're being affected by this dimension of the fifth dimension where the enemy is constantly bombarding our minds, telling us that we're not sons and daughters of God, telling us that we're that God didn't save us, telling us that God can't heal us, telling us that we're to live in poverty, telling us all the things that that that try to keep us in a in a in a condition where we're miserable. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But God wants you to come up higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come up and live in the dimension that he's created for you in the word of God that gives you the ability by the Holy Ghost to recognize your inheritance. What he has for you, what you can experience as a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You should be the happiest people on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I like it when I hear John Simon, you know, he's telling me when we talk on a regular, he says, "Brother, I'm just rejoicing to know that the Lord, you know, that that he's allowed me to see this word and to live in this great liberty of the Holy Spirit." Amen. Praise God. I believe that we can all experience that &gt;&gt; if we accept what God has done for us in our day and we come under the leadership of the word for our day and for our hour. Amen. Praise God. And so one day his kingdom will come down on earth. And this is the this is the process. You know, it says one day, but I'm telling you that it's this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that we are already being changed. We're already being caught up. When you hear them say that we were in heavenly places, I trust this morning you'll move into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; You'll have the ability to move into the word where all things are possible. You can you can you can take your circumstances and say, "Lord, I'm placing them into your hands this morning &gt;&gt; where you can take it, Lord, and and and dissolve these situations. Dissolve this sickness. Dissolve this oppression. Dissolve this depression that the enemy constantly bombarding our minds with. You can you can experience it this morning. &gt;&gt; That's why we come into the house of the Lord. We're not coming here to just play church and sit down and listen to a good sermon. We want to experience God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to experience his presence and his ability to to lift the oppression of the enemy to lift and to place us where we are rightfully called as sons and daughters of the living God. Amen. Praise God. And his kingdom, heaven and earth will embrace together. Everything will get back to eternity. All those with eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In them will enjoy their existence in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; So this this is the existence that we're now moving towards. This is the existence that that little by little we're being changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so let's read our scripture here as we continue. Our next slide is from the book of Revelation. We're going to be looking at Revelations 10 1-7. And um you know our our title for the last couple weeks is that the seventh seal completes the rapture dispensation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's look at let's look at how this, you know, unfolds, you know. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire, and he had in his hand a little book. A lot of people don't talk about this book, but this is a very important little book. And and and so let's let's just see. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, John now speaking because this is John at the in the aisle of Patmos in a vision. And we need to see that God is revealing to him these things. So he's speaking what he is seeing. Amen. So don't put a chronological order on things. Don't place things. You know, that's why people have so much trouble understanding the book of Revelation. But it is exactly that. It is a book of revelation. &gt;&gt; And revelation means it's got to be revealed. &gt;&gt; It's a book that it's the book of the revelation. If you read right from Revelations, it's the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And so, seven thunders had uttered their voices. I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not." Next slide. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and swear by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which there there are therein, that there should be time no longer. Imagine this angel which I'm telling you and saying to you that this is God himself, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He was the one that had the white wig back in the book of Revelations chapter 1. He's the one that's clothed with the white wig. He's the judge. He's Elohim. He's the self-existent one. He's the seventh dimension coming down &gt;&gt; to join with the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Time shall be no more." Now, you know that time only came as a result of the fall &gt;&gt; back in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because time is a direct correlation to death. If there was no death, there'd be no time. &gt;&gt; He says, "Time shall be no more." So something is is is taking place where we are actually because the rapture takes us from this time dimension into an eternal dimension into eternal bodies. &gt;&gt; This is the transition. We've all heard about the rapture. We talk about the rapture. People post pictures of the rapture. But then there's a reality to the rapture. &gt;&gt; And that is that we are going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye from this dimension of light, matter, and time into the sixth and to join with the seventh dimension in order to experience what we were supposed to experience in the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to look at that. And so he says here, "Time shall be no longer, but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God, the mystery of God should be finished, &gt;&gt; as he hath declared to his servants, the prophets." Amen. And so I want to emphasize the mystery of God. God had a desire from before the foundations of the world that he would express himself here on the earth and that he would have sons and daughters of God that he would uh join with. He's always had that desire from before the foundations of the world. Right when he was right when we were attributes in his mind that was his desire. Amen. Let's read the next slide. This is a quote from brother Brandham. He says, "God's great mystery of how it's a secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody knowed nothing about it. Even the angels didn't understand it." See, he didn't reveal it. That's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence. We read the scripture that on the opening of that seventh seal there was silence in heaven. Before that there was rejoicing there was singing. There was praising. Why? Because he was in heaven. &gt;&gt; He was seated on the throne. But on the opening of that seventh, there was silence because he had to go deal with Revelations 10 1-7. &gt;&gt; He had to leave his throne in order to fulfill this very scripture so that the church in this age would recognize it, that it would be his coming. Many are looking for his coming. thinking that he's still to come, but he's already come. &gt;&gt; And look what he says. He says there was silence. Jesus when he was on earth, they wanted to know when he would come. Now you got to understand Jesus was the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was under the word plan of redemption where he needed to create a body for himself. That's why the scripture says Emmanuel &gt;&gt; Jesus the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Who was that? It was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So when he was on earth, they wanted to know when he would come. And he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen because he was now in a time body and he was he was subject and under the the scripture says that in Hebrews that he became obedient to the word. He became obedient to what the word said he was to do. And he was to go to Calvary as a man and die for our sins. That's why this whole process of us being restored back to our to our rightful position as sons and daughters of God requires him to come and to prove that he could he could be uh uh living in light matter took on a body that was created not by sex. He couldn't he couldn't come because he had to be a sinless sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And the original sin back in the Garden of Eden, we don't got time to go into all the depths of it, but the original sin was an adultery. &gt;&gt; Eve wanted to bring forth sons and daughters of God under the perverted word that was given to her by the serpent that said, "Ye shall be like God in order to create." And so she went and made love with the serpent. Two children were born, Cain and Abel. Where does Cain get the the the the character to be a murderer? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Jesus even him says you are of your father the devil. When he was telling all those that were were saying that we are children of Abraham, your father the devil who was a liar and a murderer from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. That serpent seed brought forth a race of people here on the earth that broke the continuity and the program of God's original plan which brought death until Eve committed that sin. They were eternal. Their name was called Adam. They had dominion over the earth. They could replenish the earth. How? by the spoken word. That's why the Gab Gabriel, the angel Gabriel comes to the Virgin Mary and says, "Thou shalt bring forth a son." &gt;&gt; Because God required a sinless body. But yet, it had to come into time &gt;&gt; and it had to grow. It had to age. It had to go to Calvary as a man. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Forever more. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And so so he he could he he would not he did not even know the plan that was coming forth. He was in the garden of Gethsemane and even got to the point as a man. He says, "Father, if you can lift this, lift it from me." But then he turned, he says, "But no, thy will be done, not my will." And you see, as long as you're in this body of flesh and you're not born again by the spirit of God, you're subject to the world, to the to the sin, to the corruption, to the to the uh um influence of of all that's taking place here on earth. You you you'll get thrown into gender identity confusion. You'll get thrown into all kinds of different things. But when you receive the Holy Ghost, It leads you and guides you into all truth. Amen. Praise God. And so it's a secret. And that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour. And the seven thunders uttered their voices. And John was not even he was he was even forbidden to write it. See it was the coming of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what was happening in 1963 was that the mighty angel himself, God himself was now descending to come down and take on the body of the bride of Jesus Christ to unite with his body. Amen. So go to the next slide and you'll see here that this cloud like you see us wearing this cloud pin here. We don't wear it because we're we're we're part of some society. We wear it because it represents a very significant event that took back place back in 1963. And it was I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. And brother Brandham said that that cloud was the angels that were in the sixth dimension that were actually bringing him into a manifestation here on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the coming of the Lord. We can talk about this that happened back in 1963 all day long. But let me tell you, I just came to realize that this date and the coming of the Lord in 1963, it only means something to you if he's come to you today. &gt;&gt; That's why you can show this to people. You can tell them, go and read it. It's in the just do a Google search, supernatural cloud. There's all kinds of articles that were written, not religious articles, actual scientific articles that prove that this cloud should not have been there. They don't understand it. It was written into Life magazine back in 1963. This is something that that that happened and you could you could get all the research on it and you could you could get all you know the the information on it but it it'll mean absolutely nothing to you because the significance is that Christ is personally coming down to unite with his individual sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what makes this a significant event to those that that recognize what God has done in the opening of this seventh seal and the fulfillment of Revelations 10 1-7. Now, William Brham was a prophet. He had a son of man ministry here on earth that was vindicated by God to fulfill scripture. And at the time of this event, William Brham was on Sunset Mountain. So happened to be where the sun was coming to set. And it was the son of man, Jesus Christ, coming to unite with a son of man for the purpose of the opening of the seven seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he opened those seals in 1963 over a period of 7 days in March of 1963. And yet under that seventh seal, when they opened that seventh seal, there was silence. So there was something written under that seventh seal that's of importance. It's very important for us to recognize why God the angels when they spoke when the angels spoke to John and said write it not there was an element that was under that seventh seal mystery under those seven thunders that were meant only for you and me in this day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's the element of the unwritten part of the word of God that you and I receive &gt;&gt; and we can't we can't put an interpretation on it. &gt;&gt; We can't explain it. &gt;&gt; That's why you were in a certain church, you know, like I just go back myself 31 years ago, I was not even in church. I I was a Catholic. I go to church once a year, maybe twice a year, and a wedding every now and then or a baby baptism. That was my experience. But yet when I heard this word, this message coming forth from that man back there, John Simon, who was a minister anointed to bring the word in his day and in this hour, there was an element of that word that I could not quite put my finger on. But all I knew was that it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. &gt;&gt; It rings with something within me. Amen. And there's something in you that was placed there from before the foundations of the world. It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; You were placed inside of you was placed a portion of God's word. &gt;&gt; And when the time of your word, like it talks in the book of Psalms where Joseph, he was chained in prison. But the Bible says, "But then the time for his word came." There was a time when the word had to be awakened within Joseph to recognize the hour that he was living in and and to realize that God was not a silent God, &gt;&gt; but God was working personal. God was going to use Joseph to deliver the whole nation of Israel from a time of death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. And so we need to realize when the coming of the Lord comes to you personal, this makes total sense. &gt;&gt; The word unveils itself. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you you you start reading the word and you start to see things in the word of God. And you'll talk to somebody that you know that might be a Christian and you'll show them certain parts of the word like I'm showing you here, the the the seven thunders. They were they were not written. They But yet the thunders is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; We know that the thunder represents the voice of God, but yet it was sealed up. So there's something within there that needs to be unveiled. What is it that's being unveiled? The simplicity of you receiving the word for your day and it and it coming into your life and transforming you out of the situation and the condition that you were in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God. That's what the word does. &gt;&gt; Don't be looking. Listen, I'm not preaching some mysterious element here. The half hour of silence. I'm telling you that the unwritten part of the word of God is what you are now feeding on. It's the literal mind of God. It's the revelation of God. It's the thoughts of God. What he meant that that that that's why the Bible says the letter kills. But get the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and it becomes alive. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden when I talk to you and I say baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, immediately you go to the Bible, you read the book of Acts, you see that there's over three or I think 8,000 baptisms in the book of Acts. Every one of them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And you look at it, he says, "Of course it makes perfect sense because the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord of the Old Testament, Jesus of the New, and Christ the anointed spirit of God now in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Christ represents, the anointing of the spirit of God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, let's go to to our next slide here. Now in the in the message the seventh seal, William Brandham says we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things. When I read that just recently, I thought all things. So this seventh seal, it's unveiling. It hasn't stopped. It's going to end all things. That's right. He says, "The things written in the sevensealed book sealed up of the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world, it every bit ends." I thought, "Wow." You know, you could you could look at the seventh seal and you could look at it as just the seal that basically calls you into the age that you're in. calls you out of the age that you're in. Calls you to the to the to the recognition of the word for your day in the age that you're in. That's why the thought came to me, the seventh seal completes the rapture dispensation because all things includes the rapture &gt;&gt; and it includes the element of our day. Amen. &gt;&gt; The part that we are to be connected with, the part that concerns you and me, &gt;&gt; brother. I don't want to be in confusion. &gt;&gt; I want to understand the element of the word and what it is that it's going to produce in me, how it's going to change this church, how it's going to change the body that's right here that's coming and feeding on the word every Sunday, every Wednesday, coming in to receive God's word. and and and we could hear all kinds of of teachings on the word of God, but we want to zone in. We want to hone in. We want to realize that, hey, the rapture is the portion of the word that we fulfill. &gt;&gt; And this is now in progress. This is the next thing that needs to happen. Every other prophecy has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. A lot of people get confused when they look back at, you know, the prophets, you know, seven visions and and the vision of the, you know, like uh like I heard it yesterday and I I was blessed from it, you know, where a lot of people are looking and and they've been waiting for a for a, you know, because the prophet had a vision and he said it could be a a female president that would be in the United States that would rise up. But then he also said that it's, you know, it could that that that that it's the it's the Catholic Church. It's it because female represents the church and and that church has dominion and control. You know, they've got hierarchies and and they've placed themselves in such a position on the earth and there's things that are taking place right now. That scripture that that prophecy has already been fulfilled if you actually look at it. &gt;&gt; You look at you know that he said that there'd be self-driving cars. This is 70 years ago. Well, guess what? Yesterday on my way back from Sarnia, my truck has autopilot. &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, I need to feast and study and be prepared for tomorrow." You know what I did when I got on the 403? I threw it into autopilot. And I'm telling you, it works. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've used it. I was driving for a solid hour in autopilot. The only thing I had to do because there's a camera on my truck that watches my eyes. And if if if you go into autopilot and you start talking to your passenger and you're talking away, it's still driving. It was catching every I was going, man, I was surprised. I was going through construction areas on the 401 as I'm coming to the 403 and it was it was going it was following the lines. It was like I'm watching. I said, "Man, are you kidding me? This thing is that it's it it works." I'm telling you, I was I was saying, "Wow, it's fulfilled." &gt;&gt; We're experiencing it. These things have been fulfilled. The only thing that's left is the perfecting of the bride. that last one that that whose name was written in the lamb's book. You know that little book that he's got open in his hand that he comes to bring to the to the to John that he tells it because if you read on he tells John to take the book &gt;&gt; take the book and eat the book &gt;&gt; because in that book contains the revelation of every son and every daughter of God that needs to hear this word. &gt;&gt; Read it in Revelations 10:8-11. After you eat the book, you need to prophesy. What's prophesy? Minister, preach. Give a testimony. Tell the people what God has done for you. Tell the people about Malachi 4:5. Tell the people about Revelations 10:1-7. What God has done in our day because they need to hear this word. There's a last son or daughter of God out there. And they don't have to catch every revelation. Oh, they got to catch the revelation of the opening of the word. Let me tell you, if you catch this revelation genuinely, the word's been open to you. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's one revelation. That's all you need because the rapture is a revelation &gt;&gt; and it places you into the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for that last one. We're excited about what how God is going. Because look, don't tell me you don't look at the conditions of the world and you don't see a world that's going into tribulation. &gt;&gt; It's a mess out there. I'm not saying there's going to be nuclear bombs that are going to drop next week or or you know that that we're going to go into a complete and total World War II right away. No, I'm telling you that the corruption and the falling apart of the world is right from the political to the right from the political grounds to the highest levels of churchianity and religion. &gt;&gt; It's all corrupted. &gt;&gt; They're all trying to figure out God. &gt;&gt; That's why God had to send a prophet in the 20th century. That's why God had People say, "You following a man? Are you following a man? Why you you follow what? Is this some kind of a cult? Well, just ask the Lutheran. Are you following some sort of a man? Go to the Catholics and they'll tell you the Pope. They got 500,000 young people right now today &gt;&gt; that are gathered in Italy &gt;&gt; in a place &gt;&gt; to worship the pope &gt;&gt; and to and to celebrate young people in the pope. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is something saints that that that we need to realize the the the level of deception that is in place right now. Remember the scripture said it would be so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elected of God &gt;&gt; if it were possible. It's not possible. That's why don't worry &gt;&gt; when you hear the true word of God &gt;&gt; that representation inside of you will say amen to the word &gt;&gt; I ask a person I say you got the Holy Ghost they go of course I said how are you baptized I was baptized as a baby I said I can show you in the scripture that that baby baptism doesn't even exist Jesus himself said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved &gt;&gt; now Do you think that the Holy Ghost who wrote the word, the scriptures written by men that were moved by the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses could never have written what took place back in the Garden of Eden unless the spirit of God went into him, &gt;&gt; took and started to write. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. And the scripture says it. All inspiration is given by the Holy Ghost. And if an angel comes down from heaven, Paul said, and says anything different than what's written here, &gt;&gt; let him be cursed. &gt;&gt; And I turn around and say, "So you were baptized as a baby." Okay. Well, can you show me scripturally where God will recognize that by the word? Now, I'm not saying baptism saves you. It all depends where you and what you receive in the day that you're receiving the word. If you're an attribute son or daughter of God, you could never be lost &gt;&gt; because you were always a son of God. &gt;&gt; Anything that comes from God is eternal. Cannot have death. &gt;&gt; They will go back to who they were before the foundations. And Job even said it. Where were you when the sons of God rejoiced around the throne? &gt;&gt; Because we were in his mind before we were expressed here into an earthly body on earth. Amen. And so if the Holy Ghost is in somebody, they're going to say amen to the word of God. It's as simple as that. There's no excuse. And I'm not going to say that you're lost if you don't agree with it. No, it may not be your time for the word to open up to you &gt;&gt; because many were trying to convert me and and and and convince me that I needed to receive Jesus Christ. That I needed for years. I had employees that would come to me and tell me, "Danny, you need to come to my church. You need to accept Jesus Christ. You need to you need to be born again." I I I heard it all. And I and at one point, I had to tell one guy, I said, "Just that's enough. Quiet. I don't want to hear it no more." I said, this is what I said to him. I said, "If God wants me, he'll come to me, not you." Boy, did I open my mouth. I imagine one of those, you know, you know, you you've got like ministering angels around you. I got one now. I'm going to talk to the Lord's angels right now. He wants God to slap him right in the head. And let me tell you, when God came, it was an awakening, saints. It was a reality. Nobody could tell me that God was not real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And until you come to a place where his word becomes a reality to you, then then then then you're just a church member. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So here he goes and he and and he says it every bit ends. It is the end. It is the end of the struggling world. It is the end of struggling nature. It's the end of everything in there is the end of the trumpets. It's the end of the vials. It's the end of the earth. It's the end of time. And when you read that, you think, "Holy smokes, wait a minute here. This ends everything." Yeah. Well, go read Revelations 21. And there was a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Come, let me show you the lamb's bride because there's going to be there's still 1,000 years left on the earth, saints. The Bible talks about a 7,000year plan, then the new heaven, then the new earth." So, yes, the seventh seal. And what is the seventh seal? I just told you it's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. It was now God coming down to the earth in order to unite with the earth. His his plan and his mystery from the very beginning has always been to unite with man. &gt;&gt; Next slide. I don't want to get ahead of myself. And the angel said, "Time will be no more." When that in the days of this great thing to happen, everything runs out in this time, the end of at the end of the seventh seal. Notice it's the end of the church age. We recognize that years ago when brother John Simon would be ministering that we are no longer in the Leodysian church age. We have transitioned into the eternal church age. Because after seven comes 8, which is new beginning, &gt;&gt; the holy convocation. There's so many types throughout the Bible. And so we have we we we are now already beyond the seventh church age. We're we're actually experiencing the bride age. This is the age for the for for Eve to be restored. Amen. Adam came the the the second Adam came 2,000 years ago. He had to take on a body of flesh to prove that he could live in this dimension. To prove that he could restore his church, he could restore his body. He could restore Adam back to the way that he was from the beginning. But he had to come first and pay the penalty &gt;&gt; because he could never go against his own word that said, "If a man sin, a man must die." God can't change his word. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And so, it's the end of the trumpets. It's the end of the vials at the end of the ushering in of the millennium. Look at that. And that's where it just broke open even more to me. And I said, "Yes, exactly." It brings everything to an end. But for us, our end temporarily is the body change, which takes us for a three and a half year honeymoon in that sixth dimension with the redeemed. William Brham was able to go to that dimension. God took him there. He met those that were redeemed, that had received Jesus Christ in their day under their dispensation. every church age had an opportunity to receive the word for their day. And when they received it, they died and they immediately went to the sixth dimension where the redeemed were to reject and to and to and to say we don't want it. We don't accept Jesus Christ. Their change at death takes them right into the fifth dimension, which is the place of death. Is the place where it's not a fun place. But they're stuck there until the time of the white throne judgment when everybody will be risen up to be judged according to the works of the flesh. You see, you that's received the word for your day by receiving Christ into your life, your old life gets washed. &gt;&gt; It gets completely wiped out &gt;&gt; as though you never did it in the first place. It's such a wonderful revelation of deliverance to be set free from and and sin. People think sin is smoking, drinking, cheating, lying, stealing. Those are the attributes of sin. &gt;&gt; Those are the things that happen when you disbelieve the word of God. &gt;&gt; Just by the fact that you dis just by the fact that you go to somebody say you believe in a trinity because there's no such thing as a trinity. The word trinity is not even in the Bible. There's one God. &gt;&gt; Hear ye, oh Israel, the Lord thy God is one, &gt;&gt; not two. One. The Lord of the Old Testament. If Jesus Christ, Jehovah of the New Testament and now the Holy Ghost is in you, Jesus Christ in bride form in the bride age manifesting Jesus Christ in the simplicity of the word. Amen. Praise God. So here it ends and it ushers in the millennium because he is the word. The seventh seal is the word and the word is progressing and taking us line upon line, precept upon precept unto the fulfillment of every scripture according to the plan of redemption. It puts out five stars. One of those stars explodes and blows out five stars from it. And then one of them stars explodes, blows out five stars from it. It fades on out. Then the seventh seal, it just ends the time for the world. It ends the time for this. It ends the time for that. It ends the time for this. It ends the time. Everything just ended up on that seventh seal. Praise God. And the part of what we're looking to to be completed now is the rapture. &gt;&gt; That portion of the seventh seal. So here now, let's read on next slide. That one thing he hasn't revealed yet on how he will come and when he will come. It's a good thing that he doesn't. It's a good thing that he doesn't. No, he has shown or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible. Do you know that the mystery of God which was for him to unite with man was revealed in every type right from Genesis all the way to the book of Revelation. No, he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible. Therefore, the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ. And when we talk about Christ, I want you to understand the word Christ. Christ means anointed. It doesn't necessarily mean Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago was the anointed word in a human body made flesh. That's why when he goes to Peter after coming down from praying on the mountain, Matthew chapter 16, you'll read it there. He says, "Who do the people say that I am?" Some people were saying, "Oh, you are Jeremiah, one of the prophets risen up. You could be one of these prophets." He looks and turns to Peter and he says, "Who do you say that I am, Peter?" He turns around and says, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." In other words, you are the anointed word, the Messiah for our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the word made flesh in our day. &gt;&gt; He was now. And then look what look what Jesus turns around and says to him. He says, "Peter, flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. You didn't get taught this from your pastor, from your Sunday school teacher, from your mama or your anything. Flesh and blood hath not revealed this, but my father," and people take that, they say, "See, Jesus said he had a father." No, the father was the self-existent one. Jesus was interdimensional. God came down and took on a human vessel. The word in the beginning, the Bible says, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. &gt;&gt; And so that's why he says to Philip, Philip says, Lord, show us the father. He says, Philillip, if I've been with you so long, if you see me, you see the father. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not I that doeth the works, but the Father that dwelleth &gt;&gt; in me. He doeth the works. &gt;&gt; On that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, the Father in me, and I in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, you see this is all about God. The mystery of God is to unite with man. &gt;&gt; And he says here, therefore, the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ. Huh? The entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had, one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible. And all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been a type and expressing what God's great goal is. And now in this last day, &gt;&gt; he has revealed it and shows it. &gt;&gt; And God's help, well, you'll see it right here. s this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it. Now, William Branham, this is back in 1963. This message Christ the mystery of God revealed it. It basically breaks down the whole plan of redemption that God was above us. God was in with us with Jesus Christ and now God is in us in this day and in this hour. &gt;&gt; If the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, it will quicken this mortal body, it'll move it your molecules. It'll change the molecules of your body and it'll translate you into another realm or dimension. Amen. It's the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit that we want. That's the word that we want to receive. So, here now he says uh uh next slide in God's provided place of worship. We read this last week, but we're winding down now. And I want to bring a couple of types here. I want us to see how God was expressing himself right from the book of Genesis. Right from before, right, right from the very beginning. Listen, listen. When God created Adam and he said, "Let us make man in our image and he expressed Adam." Adam was in the image of God and he was God expressed in an image. That's all he did. He took attribute from himself. He took that attribute and he expressed it. And when he expressed it, he said male and female and called their name Adam. So he was actually God. Then he takes Adam, puts him into a sleep because now he's changing his realm of existence. Now he's going from totally God to God in a matter body because what does he do? He takes matter, the dust of the earth, and he breathes within that dust the breath of life, which is what? Himself. And now he's in a light matter body. that he can actually now he's he's condescending into his plan. This is all part of his plan. &gt;&gt; And then he says it's not good for Adam to be alone. He knew that in Adam was Eve. &gt;&gt; He knew that because God is male and female. They're perverting it in the world &gt;&gt; and they're coming up with all this gender identity crisises and everything else because Satan is perverting the original word. Remember his job is to pervert the word &gt;&gt; to take what is truth and just pervert it slightly becomes poison. &gt;&gt; God is male and female. So he puts Adam now into asleep and he takes from his side a rib from the womb of the man. I know you've heard this before, but I'm I I want you to just be fresh in your mind as we close here. And he takes this rib from the womb of the man and creates the woman and then Adam calls her name Eve. Do you know that right there and then when he called her Eve, which if you look up the word Eve, it means mother of all living, he knew that she was going to fall. that there would be mothers, fathers, children that would come as a result of her now because she was now expressed in the image of Adam. They were male and female. God tells them, "This is good." That's why you go to Genesis chapter 2, we read it last week. He says, "This is good." And God went and rested. He went and rested on the seventh day. The Bible says that he rested because he saw that everything that was that that he did, he looked at Adam. He looked at Eve. He says, "It's very good." He says, "Go and take authority, have dominion, multiply, replenish the earth." Do you know that all Adam had to do was look at Eve and say, "Bring forth Desmond." &gt;&gt; Attributes of God. We were with him before. But he wanted to he want remember he wanted this expression. God in Adam he he wanted to express this this this level of existence. He had he had experienced Adam in the form of that of that of that uh uh eternal existence. But now he wanted to express it not only in in an eternal existence but he wanted to have fellowship. He wanted to see. He wanted to express. He wanted his family now to be the sons and daughters of God, having dominion over the earth. That whatever they would speak, they would it would it would just be. And that's why when Adam would name the animal, it's because he was God. &gt;&gt; He could speak the animal's name because he was God. But then the fall comes and now Adam and Eve are no longer time, matter, and eternal in a theophony body because that's what they were in. &gt;&gt; That body that God created for them was the theophony body because it was created by God. It was an eternal body. And so now all of a sudden time comes into the whole picture. And now all of a sudden there's got to be another dimension that God has to create because death came in. It came in because of the sin of the serpent right from the beginning. God has to create a realm of existence now for the fallen angels. And by the way, those first angels that God created, they were living in some sort of a realm of existence. We can't explain everything. But they had to have been under free moral agency in that realm of existence. They could not be they were created. Remember, anything that's created has a beginning, will have an end. Sons and daughters of God. They come from God. &gt;&gt; They're they are God. &gt;&gt; We are messiahes. &gt;&gt; Okay? In in true expression. But those angels, they had free moral agency. Otherwise, they could not have fallen. And that's why God had to create a realm for the fallen angels. But God also had a realm for the angels that were under the obedience of the word of God that had not fallen, that had not been taken down by Lucifer. It's all I know this is, you know, there's a lot here, but I want you to see something. Amen. He says, listen here, in God's provided place of worship, but he promised just before the coming of the end time, the world would get like it was in Sodom when a man came down in human form, three of them, two angels and God himself. Genesis 18, that was God. The Bible says it was. Now he came down and he manifested himself there by turning his back to the tent where Sarah was. Go back and read Genesis 18 and told Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the tent. That's right. Congregation says, "Amen." Now Jesus himself said, "At that day, at the day when the son of man is being revealed," in other words, the son of man, the ministry of Jesus Christ himself, this was going to repeat itself. Listen. When Melzdc in Genesis 18, having no mother, no father, no beginning, no end, you know who that was, right? &gt;&gt; It was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; A lot of people say, "Well, wait a minute. He was Jesus in the Old Testament." No, he you got to understand it's him, the self-existent one. when Paul was on the road to to to to Damascus and the angel knocked him off his high horse and Paul and this is after the death of Christ. Remember, &gt;&gt; he had already given up the ghost. The resurrection had already taken place, but Paul gets knocked off his horse and he says, "Lord, who art thou?" &gt;&gt; Go read it. &gt;&gt; It's in every single Bible in in the world right now. It said, &gt;&gt; "It is I, Jesus." Amen. &gt;&gt; He had gone back to who he was before he came down. &gt;&gt; He's the self-existent one. He is the one and only God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's proving to you that God was was moving. And here in type form in Genesis 18, that was God come down in human &gt;&gt; in a theophony body. He broke bread. He ate meat. He drank milk with Abraham. Praise God. We're going to have some good times in our new bodies. Let me tell you, &gt;&gt; we're going to have a feast, brother. Let me tell you. Glory to God. We are going to get stimulation like we've never had before. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. He He came down and look, that was like his first coming to Abraham. &gt;&gt; It was like when Jesus came the first time. It was a public show. He comes there with three men. Two of them he sends into Sodom. Brother Brandham said those two men that that because brother Brandham says a greater than Solomon is here. Who do you say this is? Go back and study the life of William Brandham. You'll see the supernatural that took place around his life. It'll prove to you that Jesus Christ, the son of man, came down to a son of man &gt;&gt; to to to reindicate the word to show the things that he would do that he promised that he would do. And then look, he comes to Abraham. He tells Abraham, "You're going to have a son." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that son is going to come through your wife Sarah. &gt;&gt; And Sarah was 90 years old. Glory to God. I don't know, 80 years old, whatever it was. But then you go to Genesis 21 and you'll notice that that that Jehovah, God, Elohim, the Lord, he goes now, he doesn't go to visit Abraham. &gt;&gt; He goes to visit Sarah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It didn't say what he told her. It didn't tell everything that that that he had to say to her. But it says in Hebrews 11 that Sarah received faith &gt;&gt; to bring forth the promise of God. Amen. And God has a people in this hour. &gt;&gt; In this day that that's going to receive faith through the open word of God, through the mighty angel that has come down in human form. Amen. that has come down to take possession of human vessels once again to fulfill his word. And he promised that we will bring forth the son of God, Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; in bride form. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sarah was a type. She received the faith to bring forth the promise of the word. &gt;&gt; We are Listen, whenever you talk about a woman in the Bible, it's the church. &gt;&gt; And Sarah was a type of the church. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And he says now Jesus himself said at that day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ let's go to the next slide he says the church will come through justification Luther through Luther we talked about that through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man. &gt;&gt; And look what he says that when husband and wife will be the son, the same self persons, he's talking about Jesus Christ and his church. &gt;&gt; God will be so manifested in his bride, &gt;&gt; his church, &gt;&gt; till they will both be the same. They are one. Now you see where we're at. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now do you see where we're going? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say to you, go back and listen to who is this Melzdc. &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish here today by reading a quote from that message that should clarify to us what it is and how it is that that that we are now being changed. We are now in in translation. We are now line upon line as you receive this message as the word comes forth and you you you listen, you read, you study, you go back, you see that yes, it's the truth. Yes, I see the type in in in in Sarah. Yes, you can go back and read about Rebecca. I had notes on Rebecca here. When when God, you know, when when God goes to Abraham in Genesis 24, he goes to Abraham. God, that's another thing alto together. Praise God. But you know that brother Bram said that that was a type of the rapture &gt;&gt; when Eleazar was sent forth to get a bride &gt;&gt; for Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. She was listen Rebecca. She was under she was under the anointing of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; She was under the anointing of the of the unwritten word. because you know uh he gets all excited and he says oh god he says what if he says to Abraham he says Abraham what if what if she doesn't want to come what if what if you know she doesn't he says don't worry he says the God the angel of the Lord that led me &gt;&gt; and made every one of those promises he's going to go before you oh glory to God amen sent forth his angel &gt;&gt; he has sent forth the mighty angel himself you don't have to worry you can't fail. &gt;&gt; You got to receive the word. &gt;&gt; There's a part in you like Rebecca. Listen. &gt;&gt; Eleazar says, "Lord, let it be that when I go to the well that when I ask her to to to to give me a drink, that she's going to she's going to say, not only am I going to give you a drink, I'm going to give your your camels a drink." &gt;&gt; This is what he said. And he says, "Oh Lord, please let and let that be the one." Oh, glory to God. Let me tell you, God's got a people right now &gt;&gt; that have recognized the word. We don't have to. She she knew because the the scripture says that the angel of the Lord, not the scripture, but brother Brandham said that the angel of the Lord got there and I think there is a scripture for it that met Rebecca a half an hour before &gt;&gt; he actually arrived there. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right in that half hour of silence, she was receiving word. &gt;&gt; She was receiving the inspiration of the unwritten part of the word to know what to do with the word to recognize that who she was that she was actually the bride of Isaac. She didn't realize that she was the bride of Isaac, but in her was a revelation of who she was. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the angel of God had revealed it by revelation. You're not going to get this by reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're only going to get it by receiving the Holy Ghost and reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to end it on this quote here. Go to the next slide. We are called of God and high priest after the order of Melzdc. There's an order to our restoration that we are going to be restored back. And here now he says here I'm just going to read it. I didn't put it up on on on the slide but I'm going to read it to you. He says now in this is from who is this Melzdc? Let the musicians come. He says, 'Now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body, but a theophony. This body is subject to the word and earnest waiting for the earnest, the change of the body. Now the difference between him and you as a son. See he was at the beginning the word and morphe body he came in and lived in that body in the person of Melzdc. Then later we never heard no more of Melzdc because he became Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, he was moving interdimensional. And that's why Jesus when he came to the earth, he was there there was no sin in him. He was not affected by sin. He had dominion over sin. That's why when he would walk, the devils would rise up and say, "Lord, are you here before our time?" &gt;&gt; They recognized who he was. The people that were calling him Beelzebub didn't recognize who he was. Imagine the people that were supposed to recognize him called him a devil and the devils themselves said, "Lord, are you here before your our time? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus." &gt;&gt; You see, he was Jesus Christ. And and and uh he goes on here. He says, "Then later, we never heard no more. He became Jesus Christ. Melzdc was the priest, but he became Jesus Christ. Now you bypassed that because that form he knowed all in that form he knowed all things but you never been able to know. &gt;&gt; You bypassed your word body when you came to this earth. &gt;&gt; You didn't get to the part where you could actually live in the realm &gt;&gt; of God in a theophonic body. You bypassed that. You bypassed the word. You came into a human body. &gt;&gt; You had to be born as a baby. &gt;&gt; You had to go through spiritual amnesia not knowing who you were. &gt;&gt; And then and then and then at a certain time the word was going to come to you, &gt;&gt; the seed that was in you. It was the time for your word. the time that your part in the word because remember we read that that that that that uh the the mystery of God was being acted out in all of the believers in that particular time. &gt;&gt; And there's a portion of the word in you that must come into manifestation. The earth is groaning for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture says. And so you bypass that. And he goes on, you come like Adam, like me. You became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted. But when this life is finished here, if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting in that other dimension. &gt;&gt; That's where we go. That is the word. Then we can look back and see what we done. We now we don't understand it. We never we have never become the word. We have never become Now we are becoming the word made flesh in bride form. The son of man being revealed in bride form. the female. Remember, Adam, Eve, the Garden of Eden, everything had to be restored. But look, when this body receives the spirit of God, the immortal life inside of you, it throws the body in subjection to God. Hallelujah. He that's born of God doth not sin. He cannot sin. The attribute that's in you can't sin. It can't disbelieve the word. That's why you got to go back to the word because you are the word. &gt;&gt; You receive this message. It identifies you that you are the word in your day. Amen. He that's born of God doth not commit sin. Romans 8:1 there. There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. They walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. There you are. See, that throws your body subject. And what is it? It's the earnest of the resurrection. What is the earnest of the resurrection? The Holy Ghost. Grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you are sealed. &gt;&gt; Sealed, brother, sister. &gt;&gt; Until the day of your redemption. Amen. It's the earnest of the resurrection. This body will be raised up again because it's already started. It was once subject to sin and mire and corruption, but now it's got the earnest. Oh, glory to God. It's got the Holy Ghost. It's quickening. It's the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead that dwells in you. It's turned heavenly. Now, that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture. It's the earnest. Then, when man is born again from heaven, he becomes a spirit babe in Christ. And then when this robe of flesh is dropped, there is a natural body, theophony body, a body not made with hands, neither born of a woman that we go to. Then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For what? The glorified body is a theophony body that can be expressed right here on earth for another thousand years because they shall rule and reign with him &gt;&gt; in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for the next &gt;&gt; stage? Are you ready for the completion &gt;&gt; of the rapture? &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to a rest, saints. I don't know about you. But I'm looking forward to that three and a half year rest. And then the two witnesses come on the scene. Then Moses and Elijah go to Israel. Then the awakening of the 144,000. Then there's going to be great tribulation. Then there's going to be a thousand years of peace. Glory to God. Amen. Praise God. Are you glad that God has given us this? We should be the happiest people on earth, saints. Praise God forever more. Glory to God. Amen. Let's sing that song. If the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, it'll quicken you, I'll tell you. Amen. Give me a key, sister.
