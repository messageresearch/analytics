[11:27] Like that one lady said, she said, "I'm
[11:30] not what I want to be, but I'm certainly
[11:32] not what I used to be." How many can
[11:34] testify of that this morning? Is there

[11:41] Amen. Praise God. Praise God. I remember
[11:45] uh just this week, I was telling
[11:46] somebody
[11:49] that I used to when I was in the world,
[11:51] I uh probably nobody could curse like I
[11:54] could curse.
[11:57] And uh I came in contact with the
[11:59] message and I realized I said, "Oh boy,
[12:02] I got to clean myself up." How many say
[12:05] wrong?
[12:07] That's what I thought though. And uh I
[12:10] said the first thing I'm going to do is
[12:11] I'm going to try to get rid of cursing.
[12:14] And I and I tried and I tried and I
[12:17] tried and I tried. I was actually
[12:18] successful to a point because I actually
[12:20] got down to five times a day. That was
[12:23] the best I could possibly do.
[12:27] And uh that was it. I I couldn't do any
[12:30] better than that. and and uh but when I
[12:32] finally surrendered and went to the
[12:35] baptismal pool
[12:38] 37
[12:40] years ago, when I came out of that pool,
[12:44] that was gone.
[12:45] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[12:47] To this day,
[12:49] glory, glory,
[12:50] now it's praise the Lord. Praise the
[12:52] Lord. Bang my head. It's ouch. And uh
[12:55] and and that is the truth, friends. We
[12:57] God is a miraculous God. He's a great
[13:00] God. He knows exactly how to bring us
[13:03] along, right? He's the worldly one this
[13:05] morning. Anybody have a request they
[13:07] want to bring before him? We're going to
[13:08] go to prayer.

[13:13] for us, bro?

[13:19] going to invite guess who? Brother
[13:22] Coffee. He's going to come and pray for
[13:24] us. And he's also going to give us a

[33:09] Amen. Praise God. It looks really good.
[33:13] You guys are looking very comfortable.
[33:15] Um you're looking very modern this
[33:17] morning.
[33:19] you know, I I believe that uh the pews
[33:23] um leaving and the chairs coming in is
[33:26] just a just another aspect of the
[33:30] transformation that's taking place in
[33:33] the body of Christ. Amen. Praise God.
[33:36] And so I'm very grateful for um all that
[33:40] the Lord is doing in giving us uh this
[33:43] transformation to his house. Amen. And
[33:47] I'm very grateful for every single one
[33:50] of you that are participating and that
[33:53] have uh given of your time, your
[33:55] efforts, your finance to support this
[33:57] change. Um this is something that uh I
[34:01] believe is a part of our growth. It it's
[34:05] going to it's all a part of what God is
[34:08] doing in us personally. And when you
[34:10] recognize your placing in the body and
[34:12] your part and you get behind the work of
[34:15] the Lord and the vision that God is is
[34:18] imparting upon us as the leadership of
[34:22] this church and you stand behind it and
[34:24] you support it, it shows that you're
[34:27] you're in
[34:28] the body move. You're in what God is
[34:31] doing in this day and in this hour. It
[34:33] shows that you've recognized that that
[34:35] the Lord can do anything and that he can
[34:38] do a wonderful thing when we just allow
[34:40] him to do it. Amen. Praise God. I want
[34:42] to welcome our precious brother Coffee
[34:44] back. Um we just got a little glimpse of
[34:48] his testimony, but uh be on alert that
[34:51] he will be giving a full testimony and
[34:53] it'll be coming soon. And uh I believe
[34:57] it's something that uh people need to
[34:59] hear because he just keeps raising him
[35:03] right back up again. Brings him right
[35:05] back from that dimension. He's crossed
[35:07] over a couple times and the Lord, you
[35:10] know, is just not finished yet. So he's
[35:12] got a testimony that comes out of it
[35:14] all. Amen. And we know he's still the
[35:17] resurrection and the life. And we know
[35:19] that that is the the the message of the
[35:21] hour. Amen. If if God can raise uh
[35:24] brother Coffee from the dead two, three
[35:27] times, how easy is it for him to change
[35:29] our bodies
[35:31] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye?
[35:33] Amen. Because that's just a glimpse of
[35:35] what the Lord can do.
[35:37] Praise God. And so, thank you everybody.
[35:41] Brother Mike's already thanked everybody
[35:42] for their part in being here, and I
[35:45] support that. And I thank you all, and I
[35:48] appreciate everything that was done. the
[35:50] the the uh carpets being professionally
[35:54] cleaned. You can't even see where the
[35:55] pews used to be. It was a you know,
[35:58] wonderful job. The the gentleman gave us
[36:00] a wonderful price and did a great job.
[36:03] Um you know, we just thank God for what
[36:06] the Lord is doing. There's even one
[36:08] little stain that, you know, he had a
[36:09] little bit of trouble dealing with and
[36:11] he's going to be dealing with it. He
[36:14] says, "You know, when um in about a
[36:16] week's time when I'm uh you know, when
[36:18] I'm back, I'm going to be away just for
[36:19] a few days during the week, but I'll be
[36:22] back by Thursday morning, myself and
[36:24] Sister Jennifer. Just a quick little
[36:26] getaway by the grace of God." And so, um
[36:29] but we'll be back here next Sunday.
[36:31] Amen. To minister the word of God. So,
[36:34] um we just thank God for everything that
[36:37] was done.
[36:37] Amen.
[36:38] Amen. Praise God. I want to encourage
[36:40] the young people about the upcoming
[36:44] meetings next Sunday, Saturday, uh, and
[36:48] Sunday at Grace Tabernacle. I'm
[36:51] reminding you because I'm encouraging
[36:53] you to go. I'll be there on Saturday
[36:56] night and I'll be looking for you.
[37:00] Praise God. So, um, I'm looking forward
[37:04] to it. I believe it's going to be a real
[37:05] blessing. We want to support it the best
[37:07] that we can. I know some are away and so
[37:10] forth, but that's okay. God is uh still
[37:13] going to pour out and bless and meet
[37:16] every need in the midst of our young
[37:18] people. Amen. Praise God. Talking about
[37:20] young people, our sister Stephanie uh
[37:23] NMA
[37:25] uh was just re is she here? Where are
[37:27] you, sister? Raise your hand unto the
[37:29] Lord. Praise God. There she is. Amen.
[37:34] She was just recently uh engaged over
[37:38] the last couple weeks to a a brother uh
[37:41] brother John uh Cassamba in the Congo.
[37:46] Congratulations to our precious sister.
[37:49] Amen.
[37:54] Lord has somebody for our young people.
[37:57] wherever they are, the Lord knows and
[38:00] the Lord will bring them together in his
[38:02] time and in his season. And that's what
[38:05] makes it beautiful
[38:07] is when the Lord does it. Amen. And so
[38:10] we just want to thank God for that and
[38:12] congratulate them on that. Uh I heard
[38:15] from brother Desmond yesterday. He
[38:17] brings greetings to everybody. He
[38:18] ministered this morning. I heard that
[38:20] the services went very well in uh Kumasi
[38:24] where he ministered for um for a church
[38:27] there, a message church. And uh so he
[38:31] sends his greetings. He's there working
[38:34] on our church building program that
[38:37] we're doing uh near Acra. Amen. And so
[38:41] yes, in Ghana. And so uh continue to
[38:44] keep that in prayer, continue to support
[38:47] it. and um let's see what the Lord will
[38:49] will do. Amen. Praise God. As we go to
[38:53] prayer, we want to remember this um
[38:55] brother Stephen Doell in Alberta who
[38:58] recently just over the last day or so
[39:00] had a motorcycle accident is in the
[39:03] hospital with a broken neck and um we're
[39:06] going to ask the Lord to remember him
[39:08] and his family at this time as we go to
[39:11] prayer and then we go to the word. Let's
[39:12] pray. Does anybody else have a need this
[39:15] morning that they want to say, "Lord,
[39:17] remember me." Amen. Father,
[39:20] you see every uplifted hand this
[39:22] morning. Lord, we come to you because we
[39:25] know that you are the source of every
[39:28] healing, of every hurt, of every
[39:32] heartache.
[39:33] Lord, you are still God that provided.
[39:36] You're still the Lord shalom that brings
[39:40] peace. where there's uh Lord turmoil in
[39:44] the lives of people and this morning
[39:47] Lord we bringing brother um Stephen
[39:51] Durell
[39:53] um in Alberta Doell in Alberta that uh

[40:02] young man Lord raise him up father Lord
[40:05] he needs a miracle touch but there's
[40:08] nothing too hard for you Lord we were
[40:10] just testifying find that you raised
[40:12] from the dead. Lord, there's nothing too
[40:14] hard for you, Father. We ask that your
[40:16] spirit will go and minister to our
[40:18] brother even right now. And Lord, that
[40:21] your angels will encamp about him,
[40:23] Father. And that your spirit will touch
[40:25] his body. Remember his family, his loved
[40:28] ones, Lord, all that are concerned,
[40:30] Father. May your spirit just go and
[40:32] comfort them at this time and give them
[40:34] the confidence and the courage to trust
[40:36] you, Father, in the midst of the storm.
[40:40] Lord, bless every uplifted hand, meet
[40:43] every need this morning, Lord, as we
[40:45] minister your word, Father. We're
[40:48] completely reliant and depending upon
[40:50] you, Lord, to come and and take control
[40:53] and bring life to the word of God and
[40:55] and interpret it to the hearts of your
[40:57] people. Lord, you know the hour that
[41:00] we're living in. You know what's being
[41:02] revealed and what you want to reveal to
[41:04] each and every one of us. Lord, take the
[41:07] preeminence this morning and have glory,
[41:10] praise, and honor through the word of
[41:11] God that is ministered now. Lord, we we
[41:14] love you. We appreciate you. And we will
[41:16] always give you the glory for all that
[41:19] you do. Grant it, we pray in Jesus name.
[41:23] Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[41:25] While we're still standing, let's go to
[41:27] the scripture this morning. Um, from
[41:31] Ephesians 1:es 8-10.
[41:35] Wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[41:39] all wisdom and prudence,
[41:41] having made known unto us
[41:45] the mystery of his will, according to
[41:48] his good pleasure, which he ha which he
[41:51] hath purposed in himself.
[41:54] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[41:56] of times, he might gather together in
[42:00] one all things in Christ, both which are
[42:04] in heaven and which are on earth,
[42:09] even in him.
[42:11] Hallelujah.
[42:12] Amen. The Lord add his blessings to the
[42:13] word. You may be seated.
[42:16] Praise God.
[42:18] God bless you, brother, sister.
[42:22] Welcome into the house of the Lord. I
[42:24] recognize you.
[42:26] Are you from uh Sarnia, Petroleia? Sarna
[42:29] area. Yes. Amen. Welcome. Welcome into
[42:32] the house of the Lord this morning. Any
[42:34] visitors? If I've missed you, welcome.
[42:36] Praise God. I trust that you will
[42:39] receive the word this morning and and
[42:42] receive a blessing. Amen. We are uh go
[42:44] to the next slide. We're we're under um
[42:47] uh a series uh called uh under
[42:50] authority. We've recognized that um to
[42:53] really have authority in this time and
[42:56] in this hour that we're living in, we
[42:58] need to be submissive to the Holy Spirit
[43:01] and be under his authority.
[43:03] It's that that gives you authority when
[43:05] you're under authority. Amen. And so
[43:08] we've been um uh looking at dimensions.
[43:11] We've been looking at understanding your
[43:14] existence because truly for you to
[43:17] understand your existence here as a
[43:20] Christian, many are saying, "Oh, I'm a
[43:22] Christian. I'm a churchgoer. I believe
[43:24] in the Lord Jesus Christ." There's many
[43:26] people that are claiming those things.
[43:28] But do you really understand your
[43:31] existence as a Christian and what it is
[43:34] that you're actually producing in this
[43:37] hour? What it is that you're actually
[43:39] looking for in this hour? what it is
[43:41] that the word is going to produce
[43:44] in this hour. And truly um to have a
[43:48] clear understanding of your existence,
[43:52] then you need to understand the the
[43:55] dimensions that we live in. And
[43:58] especially in this dimension here,
[44:01] because we're being affected by seven
[44:04] dimensions around us simultaneously,
[44:09] right? And for us to, you know, to to
[44:12] really understand because people talk
[44:13] about, you know, until the prophet of
[44:16] Malachi 4:5, until William Branham's
[44:20] ministry went worldwide and around the
[44:24] world seven times from 1933 all the way
[44:28] to 1965
[44:30] until that ministry brought forth
[44:33] understanding
[44:35] by the revelation of Christ coming down
[44:38] and and and uh fulfilling scripture. God
[44:43] always operates through the fulfillment
[44:45] of his word. Amen. And William Brham was
[44:49] scripture. He was Malachi 45 to6. He was
[44:53] re he was the fulfillment of Revelations
[44:56] 10 1-7. The mighty angel coming down to
[45:00] an angel, the son of man coming to a son
[45:04] of man ministry, William Brham on the
[45:07] earth in 1963.
[45:09] And so many people have missed this. And
[45:13] to miss that is the same as missing
[45:17] Moses in his day when he came. People
[45:21] were talking about a great deliverance
[45:23] taking place in Egypt. But had they not
[45:26] recognized that it was God in Moses that
[45:30] was coming to deliver the people, they
[45:31] would have missed it.
[45:33] And in the same way, when Jesus Christ,
[45:36] his first coming came, they were talking
[45:38] about his coming. He's coming. The word,
[45:41] the whole Old Testament was prophesying
[45:44] on the coming of the Lord. Everything
[45:46] was based on God coming down to be with
[45:50] man. And when he finally came the first
[45:54] time, what happened? He came to his own
[45:56] and his own received him not.
[45:59] Why? Because they did not recognize the
[46:03] word that had been spoken through all of
[46:06] the prophets, all of the scripture in
[46:09] the Old Testament, every book in the Old
[46:12] Testament was talking about the coming
[46:14] of the Messiah, the coming of the Lord,
[46:18] when the word was going to be fulfilled.
[46:20] when Isaiah got inspired and said, "A
[46:22] virgin shall conceive." Well, in the day
[46:25] of Isaiah, but it wasn't until 400 years
[46:27] later,
[46:29] that a virgin actually conceived. They
[46:32] might have been looking at the time, but
[46:34] they needed to recognize when the word
[46:37] was going to be in season.
[46:39] And in the same way when when God sent
[46:42] us a prophet, they failed to recognize
[46:45] that God could actually send a 20th
[46:48] century prophet, but he did it.
[46:51] And not only did he do it, but he
[46:53] vindicated it. And what happened was
[46:56] those that were those that were um that
[46:59] that had a an understanding of the word
[47:03] and received the Holy Ghost
[47:06] in that dispensation
[47:08] were given the ability to recognize
[47:11] William Brham as the prophet and the
[47:14] fulfillment of Malachi 4:5
[47:17] the fulfillment of Revelations 10 1-7.
[47:20] Amen.
[47:22] all the word of God coming into season
[47:27] and this season that we're in now we
[47:31] need to understand and I've you know
[47:33] I've uh today we're looking at part four
[47:35] we're going to continue in dimensions
[47:37] but at the same time I want you to
[47:39] understand that we're in a dispensation
[47:42] of the rapture
[47:44] the scripture that we just read said
[47:46] that in the fullness of times
[47:49] and so we're going to be looking at how
[47:51] time, you know, is is is
[47:56] coming to a a a completion
[47:59] in the word for this hour
[48:02] which pertains to you.
[48:05] Because time will not exist when the
[48:08] rapture takes place for you.
[48:13] We need to realize that the dispensation
[48:17] of the rapture is not for the whole
[48:19] world. Amen.
[48:22] It's not for the whole world. It's for a
[48:24] portion of the scripture.
[48:27] For those that are that recognize where
[48:30] where it says that we who are alive and
[48:33] remain,
[48:34] we we shall be changed
[48:37] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
[48:40] This scripture has to be a reality to
[48:43] you personal.
[48:45] Unless it's unless it's a reality to you
[48:48] personal, then you're going to miss what
[48:51] God is doing right now
[48:53] under this dispensation to bring you to
[48:56] that.
[48:57] Exactly.
[48:58] There has to be a um a process by which
[49:02] the Holy Spirit is changing us uh moving
[49:07] us through this dimension that we are in
[49:10] now. Because what the prophet did for
[49:13] us, thank God, was he gave us a clarity
[49:17] and understanding on dimensions.
[49:21] He told us that that uh you know that
[49:24] we're living in in uh uh seven
[49:27] dimensions that that there's seven
[49:29] dimensions that are affecting us right
[49:31] now. We're living in in light,
[49:34] spa, uh, matter, time, and we're being
[49:38] affected by the fifth dimension, which
[49:42] is the dimension of the of the of of the
[49:45] dead.
[49:47] Hell,
[49:49] you know, not not a burning hell like
[49:51] like known, but brother Brandham
[49:53] described it as a a place where people
[49:56] go without the Holy Ghost.
[49:59] If you haven't received Christ, then you
[50:02] can't go into the sixth dimension, which
[50:04] is the dimension of the redeemed.
[50:07] And so, he gave us this whole outline.
[50:11] And so, as we start now and and uh and
[50:15] we move through this today, okay? And
[50:18] there's going to be a couple of more
[50:19] services. I don't want to rush this. I
[50:22] want to draw from it everything that the
[50:24] Lord wants to give us. Amen. I want to
[50:27] draw every inspiration and thought
[50:30] because our understanding of this
[50:34] dimensional
[50:36] existence that we're in brings clarity
[50:39] to the rapture.
[50:41] Everything that I've been studying here,
[50:43] it just makes the rapture more clear to
[50:45] me that how it's going to take place and
[50:48] how simple it is to the Lord. to us. We
[50:52] can make it complicated, but we want to
[50:54] break it down in such a simple way so
[50:57] that if you've got a clear understanding
[50:59] of of these dimensions that you're being
[51:02] affected by and how you're actually
[51:04] moving through dimensions,
[51:06] okay, that you will you will clearly be
[51:10] able to see how the Lord is going to
[51:12] take us out of here.
[51:15] It's it's it's a process. Amen. And so,
[51:18] here we are.
[51:20] we understand. And this morning, you
[51:22] know, um, Brother Tim, you know, he
[51:25] sends out uh, scriptures and this
[51:28] morning he sent um, you know, the one
[51:31] that that I received and I and I
[51:32] thought, man, I I I read that and I just
[51:35] got so many nuggets out of there. I was
[51:37] so blessed by it. I said, you know what?
[51:38] I'm going to read that this morning
[51:40] because in there there's just so much
[51:43] that we can draw from. But all that I've
[51:46] been ministering on and preaching on, I
[51:49] want you to know that if you go back,
[51:51] you get a chance, go back and listen to
[51:54] influence 1963, present stage of my
[51:57] ministry 1962. I was listening to that
[52:00] this morning. There's so much in there
[52:03] on understanding dimensions,
[52:04] understanding, you know, um how
[52:09] we see and and and how our our our
[52:12] thinking, how our bodies are designed
[52:17] and pressurized only for this dimension
[52:19] right now. You you can't you can't go to
[52:22] that other dimension. You can't go to
[52:24] the sixth dimension without a
[52:26] translation. There's got to be a change.
[52:28] And your bo there's a body waiting.
[52:30] That's why the scripture says if this
[52:32] earthly tabernacle be dissolved, you've
[52:35] got another one waiting.
[52:37] Amen. And that's and that's why it's so
[52:39] important for you to understand
[52:41] dimensions. Understand how you're going
[52:43] to move from this one to that one
[52:46] and then how you're going to be coming
[52:48] back to pick up a glorified body
[52:52] in order to exist in this dimension
[52:54] again. Because remember this whole plan
[52:58] of redemption
[53:00] brings us back to the earth again for a
[53:03] thousand years
[53:05] to reign with Christ.
[53:08] So it's not over after the rapture.
[53:11] That's just going to be a 3 and 1/2 year
[53:13] honeymoon while the earth goes into a
[53:16] great tribulation and then we come back
[53:18] after 3 and 1/2 years and we come back
[53:21] eternal bodies, glorified bodies. We're
[53:26] going to look at some of those things
[53:28] and you're going to realize and see that
[53:30] that that we're not going to a million
[53:33] miles into the heavens or and the people
[53:36] are not going a million miles into the
[53:38] depths of hell. there the all those
[53:41] dimensions are right here right now.
[53:44] The seventh dimension is the mighty
[53:47] angel. It's Christ himself.
[53:49] And we're in heavenly places right now.
[53:53] You need to recognize that that you're
[53:55] in his presence in that dimension. And
[53:58] it's available to you this morning by
[54:01] being aware.
[54:03] Wake up.
[54:04] Hallelujah.
[54:04] Understand. Hey, we're being encamped
[54:07] about by a cloud of witnesses.
[54:09] Where are those witnesses? They're in
[54:11] that sixth dimension. And they without
[54:14] us, not us without them.
[54:18] No, no, no. They without us because
[54:20] there's a there's a change. There's a
[54:23] dimensional change that's in progress
[54:25] that could not happen in the seven
[54:28] church ages.
[54:29] They have to happen now.
[54:31] They got to happen now. This is the time
[54:34] and the season for they're waiting on us
[54:37] to catch this
[54:39] so that we can move into that dimension
[54:42] and be changed in a moment in the
[54:43] twinkling of an eye. But if you're if
[54:45] you're sleeping, if you're coming to
[54:47] church by tradition, if you're just a
[54:49] churchgoer, you you haven't you you
[54:52] haven't recognized that God sent a
[54:54] prophet. You haven't recognized the
[54:55] opening of the seven seals. You haven't
[54:58] recognized that the mighty angel came
[55:01] down, showed himself, he took on the
[55:04] sixth dimensional angels, and he he he
[55:07] went into that cloud. Hallelujah. He
[55:11] used the angels from the sixth dimension
[55:13] to come into that cloud and show himself
[55:16] as the head because he was declaring,
[55:19] "I'm coming to the earth. I'm coming to
[55:22] declare. I'm coming to redeem. I'm
[55:25] coming to call those that are awake."
[55:30] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. So,
[55:33] I was really blessed by that um
[55:38] uh uh scripture that Tim sent me this
[55:40] morning, and I'm going to read it
[55:42] because it's it's it it really is the
[55:46] start of everything
[55:50] that we're talking about. It was on
[55:52] light. And Genesis
[55:56] 1:3 says, it reads, "And God said, let
[55:59] there be light." and there was light.
[56:02] And this signifies God's creative power
[56:06] and authority through the spoken word.
[56:10] Remember, he was a self-existent one. He
[56:12] wanted to express himself. He wanted to
[56:15] unite with man. He knew that the only
[56:18] way that he could unite with man was to
[56:20] get rid of all the chaos and the
[56:22] darkness. And so, he had to bring light.
[56:25] Amen. It marks, listen, it's I'm just
[56:27] going to read it. It marks the beginning
[56:29] of creation. Now, we're talking about
[56:31] this earth and we're talking about this
[56:34] plan and we could go and talk about so
[56:38] many previous, you know, civilizations
[56:41] and everything else, but we don't know
[56:43] anything about that. We know what
[56:45] science can tell us. We know what
[56:47] they've come up with, but we're not
[56:50] that's not the focus.
[56:52] God didn't send us a prophet to tell us
[56:54] about dinosaurs.
[56:57] He didn't take us back into the mind of
[56:58] God to tell us about dinosaurs. He took
[57:00] us back into the mind of God to talk
[57:02] about us.
[57:03] Amen.
[57:04] Where we fit in and how we are a part of
[57:07] that great self-existent one.
[57:09] Right.
[57:10] That takes us right back to the
[57:12] beginning of all beginnings.
[57:13] Amen.
[57:14] There is no further back beginning and
[57:17] because he had no beginning.
[57:19] Hallelujah. So, we're interested in
[57:21] that. Look, even God said to Adam,
[57:23] "Replenish
[57:25] the earth." Which means that there was
[57:27] something there at some time.
[57:29] But he doesn't get into telling us what
[57:31] it is. And you know what? I'm not
[57:33] interested.
[57:34] Amen.
[57:36] Because I'm interested in getting back
[57:38] to what what what my my rightful
[57:40] position as a son of God.
[57:42] Amen. Praise God. And so here now he
[57:45] goes, it marks the beginning of
[57:47] creation, specifically the introduction
[57:49] of light, symbolizing the establishment
[57:52] of order
[57:54] and the dispelling of darkness.
[57:58] Hallelujah.
[57:58] Light is the word of God. And what you
[58:02] received in the opening of this word to
[58:06] bring you into this ministry of Christ,
[58:10] we're not following a man. We're not
[58:12] under the ministry of William Branham.
[58:15] We're not Branommites. We are sons and
[58:18] daughters of God in the mystical body of
[58:21] Jesus Christ. I want that to go on
[58:23] record. Amen. We are the body of Christ.
[58:27] We have We have received the Holy Ghost.
[58:31] Amen. Jesus said, "I'll send you the
[58:33] comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, and
[58:36] he will guide you into all truth. And
[58:39] the truth is what sets us free.
[58:42] Amen. Not belonging to a denomination.
[58:44] Not belonging to a man's teachings. Not
[58:47] no the truth. The truth. Amen. So it
[58:51] symbolizes the dispelling of darkness.
[58:55] This verse highlights God's ability to
[58:57] bring something new and significant into
[59:00] existence with just a command.
[59:04] And you know, we looked at it. God. When
[59:07] God created Adam in his image, Adam was
[59:12] in a 21-year-old body.
[59:15] Adam was a perfect
[59:18] man. Amen. But he had no time on his
[59:22] body because he was in the image of God.
[59:25] So God can create by his word. He can
[59:29] create anything he wants. That's right.
[59:32] So if he says he's going to change this
[59:34] mortal into immortality,
[59:37] I believe it.
[59:39] I believe it.
[59:40] If he says that by his stripes I am
[59:44] healed, I believe it.
[59:46] It's as simple as that. What What's the
[59:48] difference? If he says that, you know,
[59:50] that that that I am the Lord God that
[59:52] provideth all of your needs,
[59:55] then I believe it.
[59:57] All my needs are going to be met.
[59:59] Amen. And so he can do anything. This
[1:00:02] verse highlights God's ability to bring
[1:00:04] something new and significant into
[1:00:07] existence. And what we're talking about
[1:00:10] is our existence, our purpose,
[1:00:13] understanding it. God's spoken word.
[1:00:16] This verse emphasizes that God creates
[1:00:19] through his word. This highlights the
[1:00:21] power and the authority of God's spoken
[1:00:24] word. A reoccurring theme throughout the
[1:00:27] Bible. Everything's based on the spoken
[1:00:30] word. You've recognized the spoken word
[1:00:33] for your day.
[1:00:35] That's the difference. People are going
[1:00:38] to church under tradition over and over
[1:00:41] and over again, but they haven't
[1:00:44] recognized the spoken word. Just like
[1:00:46] when Jesus walked into the midst of the
[1:00:48] people, he was the word made flesh.
[1:00:51] He was in he was in in in a a a light
[1:00:55] body matter in time because he had to
[1:01:00] take on the form of a baby. He was born
[1:01:03] as a baby. But one thing that he was not
[1:01:06] affected by was the fifth dimension,
[1:01:09] hell.
[1:01:11] He was he was Lord over the hell.
[1:01:15] He was Lord over death. He said, "I am
[1:01:19] the resurrection and the life." He made
[1:01:22] it clear when he told when when
[1:01:24] Lazarus's sister came and says, "But
[1:01:26] he's dead. He stinkketh." He says, "I'll
[1:01:28] raise him up again.
[1:01:30] I'll just raise him up again."
[1:01:32] He had the ability to go and raise the
[1:01:36] dead by the spoken word because he was
[1:01:39] God
[1:01:40] in a human body, in time, in matter, in
[1:01:46] light. But yet he had control over the
[1:01:49] dimensions. Amen.
[1:01:51] He was showing that he would have
[1:01:52] control and that at some point his wife
[1:01:56] would have the same kind of control.
[1:01:57] Amen.
[1:01:58] Praise God. She would know. She would
[1:02:00] recognize. She would realize that the
[1:02:03] hour is coming. Amen. Praise God. He was
[1:02:06] the first Adam or the second Adam. But
[1:02:10] now we're looking for the second Eve,
[1:02:13] the one that's been fully restored.
[1:02:15] Amen. Praise God. And so the first act
[1:02:18] of creation, let there be light, is the
[1:02:21] first instance of God speaking something
[1:02:24] into existence. This signifies the
[1:02:26] beginning of the creation process and
[1:02:29] the establishment of order where there
[1:02:32] was once chaos.
[1:02:34] So what's the symbolism of light? Light
[1:02:36] is often associated with goodness.
[1:02:40] It's associated with revelation
[1:02:42] and the presence of God. Amen.
[1:02:46] Amen. In Genesis 1:3, light symbolizes
[1:02:49] the removal of darkness and the
[1:02:51] introduction of God's creative presence.
[1:02:55] It's a contrast with darkness. The verse
[1:02:58] contrasts light with darkness, which is
[1:03:00] associated with the chaotic state before
[1:03:04] creation.
[1:03:05] This highlights God's power to overcome
[1:03:08] darkness and bring forth life and order.
[1:03:12] Significance of the verse Genesis 1:3 is
[1:03:14] a foundational verse in the Bible
[1:03:18] establishing God as the creator of light
[1:03:22] and the source of all life.
[1:03:25] Amen. Glory. It sets the stage for the
[1:03:29] rest of creation's account and the
[1:03:32] unfolding of God's plan.
[1:03:36] Hallelujah. light was the first
[1:03:39] dimension that he spoke into existence,
[1:03:42] but it was only the start of the plan
[1:03:46] that he had in the back of his mind. And
[1:03:49] so here now, let's read
[1:03:53] go to the next slide here. I'm going to
[1:03:54] read a a quote here from brother
[1:03:56] Brandon. He says, "And they're going to
[1:03:58] find out someday that they're not seeing
[1:04:01] 150 million years of light space either.
[1:04:05] They're going right around in a circle.
[1:04:07] That's exactly. You're going to find out
[1:04:10] one of these days that when you go to
[1:04:12] heaven, you don't fly off somewhere
[1:04:14] else. You're still right here.
[1:04:17] Amen.
[1:04:18] Two, just in another dimension faster
[1:04:21] than this. Right through this room is
[1:04:25] coming. Color. Every color, shirt,
[1:04:28] dress, whatever you got on is eternal,
[1:04:32] laying right on records, going around
[1:04:35] and around the world. Every time you bat
[1:04:38] your eyes, it's right on record. Watch
[1:04:41] television will prove that. Amen. Praise
[1:04:46] God. And so, let's go to the next slide.
[1:04:49] A little just a quick review, okay? As
[1:04:52] we're moving through this third, you
[1:04:54] know, because the understanding of the
[1:04:56] third dimension being time, this is so
[1:04:59] important to us because, you know, as we
[1:05:02] get through this and as we we we come to
[1:05:05] the end of this and we move into the
[1:05:07] seventh dimension, we're going to be
[1:05:09] looking at at the scripture where
[1:05:12] Revelations 10:6 says, "Time shall be no
[1:05:15] more."
[1:05:16] And so that pertains to something that
[1:05:18] that is going on right now in the midst
[1:05:21] of God's people.
[1:05:23] They've recognized this scripture.
[1:05:24] They're they're they're moving in it.
[1:05:27] They're they're fulfilling it. They're
[1:05:30] they're conscious of the mighty angel
[1:05:32] that came down to open those seals and
[1:05:35] what it is that he's going to produce.
[1:05:37] They're conscious of it. But in the
[1:05:39] meantime, time began and was issued in
[1:05:42] the economy of mankind when man fell
[1:05:45] from grace. Listen, when Adam was made
[1:05:48] in the image of God, he was eternal. He
[1:05:52] was in God's image. It wasn't until God
[1:05:55] took of the matter of the dust of the
[1:05:58] earth. Time still wasn't in existence at
[1:06:01] this point. He takes matter and he
[1:06:03] creates a body so that Adam could live
[1:06:07] in this dimension
[1:06:10] on the earth
[1:06:12] in light matter
[1:06:15] and in a theophony form because he was
[1:06:19] in the image of God. He had an eternal
[1:06:22] body.
[1:06:23] He was theophony and he called his name
[1:06:26] Adam. Male and female called their name
[1:06:30] Adam. So in Adam in that theophony was
[1:06:34] also Eve. She was she was there with him
[1:06:38] because he uh God expressed one of his
[1:06:42] attributes from himself when he said let
[1:06:44] us make man in our image. And when he
[1:06:48] did that he was showing that he himself
[1:06:51] is male and female
[1:06:53] within God is male and female. Today
[1:06:57] they've perverted it. They're they're
[1:06:59] abusing it. You know, they're using
[1:07:01] gender identity and they're and they're
[1:07:03] reversing everything. They're saying,
[1:07:04] "Oh, well, I'm a male, but but I'm but I
[1:07:07] I I I I want to be a female. I'm a
[1:07:11] female in a male body." See, it's all
[1:07:14] the perversion. They Satan is what he's
[1:07:17] going to do. He's going to pervert what
[1:07:19] is actually the truth. And the truth is
[1:07:22] is that we are going back to the one to
[1:07:25] to one God to to the to the fullness of
[1:07:28] Adam back in the in the Garden of Eden
[1:07:31] where God was expressing himself as male
[1:07:35] and female.
[1:07:37] But it wasn't until Eve because he took
[1:07:40] he says, "Okay, I'm going to make a
[1:07:41] helpmate now for Adam." And he takes
[1:07:44] right from himself, right from Adam. He
[1:07:47] takes a rib and he produces this human
[1:07:50] uh matter body
[1:07:53] who was still eternal. Eve was eternal
[1:07:58] like Adam. She was one with Adam. She
[1:08:00] was actually one in theophony in Adam.
[1:08:04] Amen.
[1:08:06] But she got deceived when the devil
[1:08:08] comes. Remember God's desire was to to
[1:08:12] multiply himself
[1:08:15] and to bring forth by the spoken words
[1:08:17] sons and daughters of God. Satan saw
[1:08:21] heard says I want to do that. I want to
[1:08:26] bring forth children. That's why the
[1:08:28] original sin is not eating an apple. It
[1:08:32] was an adultery. It was a sex act
[1:08:35] because the serpent who was an upright
[1:08:38] being was Satan himself incarnate able
[1:08:42] to talk able to communicate with her.
[1:08:45] Says hath God said that you know the day
[1:08:47] that you eat of this tree meaning
[1:08:50] himself the tree of knowledge. He knew
[1:08:52] both good and evil. He knew that that
[1:08:54] God had created you know bring forth
[1:08:57] after its own kind. He saw that every
[1:08:59] seed would bring forth of his own kind.
[1:09:01] So he goes to Eve and he says, "Hey,
[1:09:03] hey, hey, hey, hey, I can make you like
[1:09:06] God and create
[1:09:09] sons and daughters
[1:09:12] and you can be like God." And she
[1:09:15] actually at that moment fell into sin.
[1:09:20] And it was at that very moment time came
[1:09:24] into existence because time is death.
[1:09:28] Time is the separation between life and
[1:09:31] death. Time is the separation between
[1:09:35] you and God. As long as we are in a time
[1:09:38] body, we are separated from God.
[1:09:42] That's why this earthly tabernacle has
[1:09:45] to be dissolved. You you got to be
[1:09:47] changed. You can't stay in this
[1:09:49] tabernacle and see God. Amen. Even when
[1:09:53] brother Brandham was taken over to that
[1:09:54] other dimension, this tabernacle was
[1:09:57] left in the bed.
[1:09:59] Hallelujah.
[1:10:00] Because this tabernacle is for this
[1:10:02] dimension.
[1:10:04] Amen. Praise God. So, we need to see
[1:10:06] here that that death and hell came as a
[1:10:12] result of Eve going and committing
[1:10:15] adultery with Satan himself, the
[1:10:19] serpent, and brought forth
[1:10:23] the serpent seed. Brought forth Cain,
[1:10:27] who was a murderer.
[1:10:30] Why was he a murder? Where did murder
[1:10:32] come from? Why all of a sudden? because
[1:10:35] he his father was a liar.
[1:10:38] Amen.
[1:10:39] Okay. The Bible even says, I can show
[1:10:41] you scripture. People don't want to
[1:10:42] believe in the serpent seed. They don't
[1:10:44] want to believe that that that Eve
[1:10:45] committed adultery. It's in the
[1:10:47] scriptures. It's clear in the script.
[1:10:49] I'm not going to get into all of it now,
[1:10:51] but you can go and search it yourself
[1:10:54] and look it up and then you'll see all
[1:10:56] the scriptures that pertain that, you
[1:10:58] know, when Jesus himself stood before
[1:11:01] the Pharisees and all the high priests
[1:11:03] and everything else, they were claiming
[1:11:05] to be the sons of Abraham.
[1:11:08] Jesus stood there and says, "You're of
[1:11:11] your father, the devil,
[1:11:14] who was a liar from the beginning." Who
[1:11:16] was the first liar in the beginning?
[1:11:19] It's a serpent. Who was the serpent? The
[1:11:22] devil.
[1:11:24] We got to see this in order. Listen, if
[1:11:26] you're going to understand dimensions,
[1:11:28] then you're going to have to understand
[1:11:30] that that fifth dimension is death and
[1:11:33] hell. And it's the dimension that mixes
[1:11:36] with this one here. That's why there's
[1:11:38] so much effects and so much war and so
[1:11:42] much uh destruction and and and adultery
[1:11:46] and broken families and sickness and and
[1:11:49] a world that's completely falling apart.
[1:11:51] Why? Because the fifth dimension is
[1:11:54] influencing the people and and and
[1:11:58] taking a hold of the people because they
[1:12:02] don't have the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:12:04] Do you know that when you receive the
[1:12:07] gift of the Holy Ghost, it's your
[1:12:09] ability to withstand that fifth
[1:12:12] dimension's influence in your life?
[1:12:15] It's what sets up the barrier between
[1:12:17] you and the influence of that fifth
[1:12:20] dimension that doesn't take you and and
[1:12:22] and suck you in and destroy your life
[1:12:26] if it wasn't for the grace of God. But
[1:12:28] that fifth dimension, people think that
[1:12:30] it's all monsters and and and wicked
[1:12:33] evil spirits that are that are
[1:12:36] manifesting on the people. Let me tell
[1:12:38] you that fifth dimension and those
[1:12:40] spirits that operate out of that
[1:12:42] dimension are operating right in our
[1:12:45] schools, right in our politicians, right
[1:12:48] in the in the in the in the world
[1:12:50] systems of today, right in the right in
[1:12:53] Hollywood. They're operating there to
[1:12:56] bring an influence upon the people.
[1:12:58] They're operating from the pulpits.
[1:13:01] Those spirits are moving right from the
[1:13:03] pulpit and speaking. God is a trinity.
[1:13:07] There's the father, there's the son,
[1:13:08] there's the holy ghost. All three
[1:13:10] separate individuals, but they're one.
[1:13:13] And that is the that is the mark of the
[1:13:16] beast.
[1:13:17] That is the lie of the enemy to get the
[1:13:20] people. That's why the scripture said
[1:13:22] all would be deceived. All a ll
[1:13:28] would be deceived by this religious
[1:13:30] system that that Satan has designed. He
[1:13:34] was religious, remember? He knew the
[1:13:35] word.
[1:13:36] He went to Eve and says, "Hath God
[1:13:38] said?" He knew exactly what God said.
[1:13:42] He's very religious. And he's going to
[1:13:44] take the word of God and he's just going
[1:13:46] to twist it just enough to make you feel
[1:13:48] comfortable in your church.
[1:13:51] and you're believing a lie and you don't
[1:13:53] know it.
[1:13:55] And what did we say?
[1:13:58] A partial truth will set you free.
[1:14:01] No, no. The truth, the truth will set
[1:14:06] you free.
[1:14:08] And this is the element that deception
[1:14:11] has now gotten to the highest level
[1:14:14] where all would be deceived except those
[1:14:17] whose names were written in the Lamb's
[1:14:21] book of life.
[1:14:24] And in 1963,
[1:14:26] the mighty angel comes down with a book
[1:14:29] open.
[1:14:32] Oh, we're going to be looking at that
[1:14:33] more and more. And we're going to see
[1:14:35] things in there that we never thought we
[1:14:37] would see. But it's because your
[1:14:40] identity is in that book.
[1:14:42] And that's why you're able to see the
[1:14:44] things that you're able to see. That's
[1:14:46] why you're able to withstand this
[1:14:48] dimension. Oh, the battles are hard.
[1:14:50] Don't listen. I fought battles this
[1:14:54] week, saints. I'm not going to sit here
[1:14:57] and throw a pity party. I I don't want
[1:15:00] to hear I listen. I I know. Listen, we
[1:15:02] all go through battles. But you know
[1:15:04] what? When I when I get together with my
[1:15:06] brothers and sisters, I want to
[1:15:08] fellowship on the victory over the
[1:15:11] battle.
[1:15:12] I want to know about the victory of what
[1:15:14] God did to get me through the battle.
[1:15:16] Amen. And this is what I'm talking about
[1:15:19] here. It was the Holy Ghost that gave
[1:15:22] victory this week to get through the
[1:15:24] battle. Because without the word in you,
[1:15:27] you will not stand.
[1:15:29] You will fall. You will fall into
[1:15:30] deception. You'll get into a laxy nice
[1:15:33] and comfortable condition thinking
[1:15:36] everything is fine, but yet you've
[1:15:38] missed it a million miles the rapture
[1:15:41] will have taken place. And the and you
[1:15:44] know what? There's there's so few in the
[1:15:46] rapture that when it happens, they're
[1:15:48] not even going to miss us.
[1:15:50] Actually, maybe a lot of people are
[1:15:52] going to say, "I'm glad the guy's gone,
[1:15:53] man. He never stops talking about the
[1:15:54] Lord.
[1:15:56] He's always talking about Jesus."
[1:15:58] Hallelujah. You better talk about Jesus
[1:16:00] in this hour because he's the only way
[1:16:02] out. He says, "I am the way, the truth,
[1:16:05] and the life. No man comes to the
[1:16:07] father, which is back to eternity, back
[1:16:10] to his self-existence,
[1:16:13] but by me, which was the the the
[1:16:16] sacrifice of him coming to the earth to
[1:16:19] claim
[1:16:20] his own."
[1:16:22] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. And so
[1:16:25] here we know now that um that this third
[1:16:29] dimension it it it has everything to do
[1:16:33] with you know the garden of Eden. But
[1:16:36] due to the fall when Eve was deceived by
[1:16:38] the serpent into eating and partaking
[1:16:41] with the forbidden fruit and dragged her
[1:16:44] into her husband dragged her husband
[1:16:47] Adam into it. Death entered human life.
[1:16:50] Don't think Adam didn't know what was
[1:16:52] going on. Adam was fully aware just like
[1:16:56] Jesus. While we were yet sinners, he
[1:17:00] loved us.
[1:17:01] Glory to God. Amen. Aren't you glad that
[1:17:04] your that your old life, no matter how
[1:17:06] wicked, how ugly it was, he still loved
[1:17:10] you in the midst of it all. And he says,
[1:17:12] "Forgiven,
[1:17:14] forgotten
[1:17:16] in the sea of my for forgetfulness,
[1:17:18] never to be remembered no more." That's
[1:17:20] what I call a fresh start, saints.
[1:17:23] That's available to every single one
[1:17:25] that can receive this. Amen. Praise God.
[1:17:29] But of the fruit that of the tree in the
[1:17:31] midst of the garden, thou shalt not eat
[1:17:32] of it. The moment that you eat thereof,
[1:17:34] you will die. And Genesis 3 tells us,
[1:17:36] man began to age and to weaken after the
[1:17:40] fall. Man that is born of a woman is of
[1:17:44] a few days. Job said, Amen. In 14:1,
[1:17:48] time will cease. one day after
[1:17:51] everything has been restored by God back
[1:17:54] to its original condition.
[1:17:58] Amen.
[1:17:59] Hallelujah. Praise God forever more. So
[1:18:04] let's move on the fourth dimension. We
[1:18:08] understand that you know that man is
[1:18:12] living in light, matter, time. But the
[1:18:16] fourth dimension, just a quick review,
[1:18:18] we know that without the fourth
[1:18:20] dimension, you would not even hear me
[1:18:22] speaking right now. This fourth
[1:18:25] dimension is the is the dimension of
[1:18:27] communication. It's where God can can
[1:18:30] communicate and bring forth his word and
[1:18:34] bring forth his teachings, inspire his
[1:18:37] ministers, get you into fellowship
[1:18:39] around the word of God, get you reading
[1:18:42] the word, get you talking about the
[1:18:44] word, get you inspired, get you changed
[1:18:48] little by little. But Satan also uses
[1:18:51] that fourth dimension to influence you
[1:18:53] in exactly the opposite way. He'll get
[1:18:56] you to listen to YouTube about how God
[1:19:00] is just
[1:19:03] the universe
[1:19:04] and Jesus was just somebody that reached
[1:19:08] a very high level of consciousness
[1:19:12] right there and then
[1:19:15] gets you thinking like the rest of the
[1:19:16] like because the masses the majority of
[1:19:19] people I don't care what religion they
[1:19:21] are
[1:19:23] the majority of
[1:19:25] will agree with that.
[1:19:29] They'll they'll agree when when somebody
[1:19:31] comes up and says Allah is God.
[1:19:35] Yes,
[1:19:37] you can call God Allah,
[1:19:40] but the God that you call Allah
[1:19:44] is Jesus Christ
[1:19:46] in this dimension.
[1:19:49] And you need to recognize that he died
[1:19:52] for your sin.
[1:19:54] And without recognizing that Allah is
[1:19:56] Jesus Christ and denying that Jesus
[1:19:59] Christ is Allah, you'll die in your sin.
[1:20:03] You'll perish in your sin. You can't.
[1:20:05] The Holy Ghost is not going to go
[1:20:09] against his own word.
[1:20:12] Jesus says, "I'll send you the
[1:20:15] comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,
[1:20:18] and he will guide you into all truth."
[1:20:22] So the Holy Ghost will never contradict
[1:20:25] himself.
[1:20:26] And this is how you will know what is
[1:20:29] truth and what is not truth. But this is
[1:20:31] how they use the teachings they use, you
[1:20:35] know, uh, television, movies,
[1:20:38] social media, you know, all via the
[1:20:42] fourth dimension, all via man's
[1:20:44] scientific achievements.
[1:20:47] Man is looking like he's achieving the
[1:20:49] greatest things. Putting satellites in
[1:20:51] the heavens so that speed of of of
[1:20:55] communication so that words and music
[1:20:57] and and sound and pictures can move at
[1:21:00] light speed. It's wonderful.
[1:21:03] It's great. But if it's not leading you
[1:21:07] closer to Christ, the word, then it's
[1:21:10] taking you away from him.
[1:21:12] It's as simple as that. And so we know
[1:21:14] that the fourth dimension it operates
[1:21:17] and runs through the other four
[1:21:20] dimensions which is light, space,
[1:21:24] matter, time
[1:21:27] and the fifth dimension which is hell
[1:21:31] and death. Death and hell, not a burning
[1:21:35] hell. Not a get this this thing. I know
[1:21:38] a lot of people had this concept, but
[1:21:39] God sent us a prophet that was able. And
[1:21:42] he says, "By the grace of God, I've seen
[1:21:44] both places."
[1:21:46] And he says, "And if anybody tells you
[1:21:49] that it's a burning hell, it's not. Or
[1:21:52] that it's an eternal hell, it's not." He
[1:21:55] described that fifth dimension and what
[1:21:57] it was. And it's as simple as this. You
[1:21:59] ever had a nightmare?
[1:22:02] That's what he described it as, a
[1:22:04] nightmare. That it's somewhere that
[1:22:07] you're stuck. You're you're not awake
[1:22:09] and you're not fully asleep, but you're
[1:22:12] stuck in this fifth dimension between
[1:22:16] this life and that life. Okay? And when
[1:22:19] somebody dies without the Holy Ghost,
[1:22:24] okay? It's without the Holy Ghost, which
[1:22:27] is the word for your day. Remember
[1:22:31] the Holy Ghost was given through all the
[1:22:34] seven church ages.
[1:22:36] And and when it came through all those
[1:22:38] seven church ages, there was an
[1:22:40] anointing that came with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:42] because the Holy Ghost is the anointing
[1:22:45] of God.
[1:22:46] It's the seventh dimension anointing on
[1:22:49] you as an individual. That's why it's a
[1:22:52] gift to receive the Holy Ghost. And you
[1:22:56] young people, when you receive the Holy
[1:22:57] Ghost, or you older people, when you
[1:22:59] receive the Holy Ghost, you're receiving
[1:23:02] the ability to recognize the word.
[1:23:05] That's what the Holy Ghost does to you.
[1:23:08] It gives you the ability to recognize
[1:23:10] what God is doing in your day.
[1:23:12] And it also places an anointing on you
[1:23:15] to overcome the age that you're in.
[1:23:19] Because you look back at the seven
[1:23:22] church ages, how could those individuals
[1:23:25] that that that had to face lions and and
[1:23:28] be cut into pieces and and be thrown
[1:23:31] into rings uh gladiator rings and be uh
[1:23:34] chopped up and everything go in there
[1:23:36] praising God.
[1:23:37] Hallelujah. Walking it. Why? Because
[1:23:40] they had the Holy Ghost on them.
[1:23:42] Through the dark ages, they they they
[1:23:44] killed 68 million Christians.
[1:23:47] How did they kill those? They burn them
[1:23:49] at the stake. They would go to the stake
[1:23:51] praising God. Why? Because they weren't
[1:23:53] feeling the burning of the fire. They
[1:23:55] had the fire of God burning through
[1:23:57] them. Amen. That was cooling them,
[1:23:59] making them feel the anointing of God's
[1:24:01] love and and and his protection on their
[1:24:04] lives. Amen. Praise God. They could face
[1:24:08] whatever challenge that the enemy would
[1:24:11] bring to them because they had the Holy
[1:24:13] Ghost anointing
[1:24:15] for that particular age. And there's an
[1:24:18] Holy Ghost anointing in this age, which
[1:24:22] is Christ himself. Amen. This anointing
[1:24:25] that we're talking about that we're
[1:24:27] going to that we're going to go deeper
[1:24:29] into, it's the one that changes us.
[1:24:32] It's the one that changes this mortal
[1:24:34] body in a moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:24:36] eye. But you're going to need to receive
[1:24:37] the revelation of this anointing and
[1:24:40] what it's supposed to produce. It's not
[1:24:43] going to produce another denomination.
[1:24:48] It's not going to produce another church
[1:24:50] age. The church ages are over.
[1:24:54] Amen. This is going to produce Christ
[1:24:58] back on the earth again with his bride,
[1:25:01] with his wife having dominion. Amen. And
[1:25:04] then it goes into a new heaven and a new
[1:25:05] earth after the millennium. And I don't
[1:25:07] even want to go there right now. But all
[1:25:10] I can tell you is that if you look at
[1:25:12] the scripture, it says that in the New
[1:25:15] Jerusalem in that place, the lamb is the
[1:25:18] light in that place. They're not even
[1:25:20] going to need light.
[1:25:21] Hallelujah.
[1:25:22] Because the lamb is going to be the
[1:25:23] light.
[1:25:24] There's going to be no death, no sorrow,
[1:25:26] all those things. But that's the new
[1:25:28] heaven and the new earth. That's going
[1:25:30] to be that's going to be down the road.
[1:25:33] We don't want to go there. we want to
[1:25:35] deal with right now so we can get there.
[1:25:37] Amen.
[1:25:37] Praise God. That's where we want to stay
[1:25:40] right there. So understanding this
[1:25:43] fourth dimension is is is important
[1:25:45] because it's where you get attacked.
[1:25:48] It's where you're constantly bombarded.
[1:25:50] You young people be careful. You're
[1:25:52] constantly on your phones. You've
[1:25:54] constantly got them in your face and
[1:25:56] you're constantly being bombarded by the
[1:25:58] lies of the enemy. Unless you're feeding
[1:26:01] on the right things, your mind is being
[1:26:04] you, you know, your subconscious mind is
[1:26:06] an important part of your being. And and
[1:26:09] what you feed your subconscious mind is
[1:26:11] what you is what you become and what you
[1:26:14] start to manifest on the outward part.
[1:26:18] And if there's not a pull for the word,
[1:26:21] for the word of God, to to hear the
[1:26:24] messages, to hear the prophet's voice,
[1:26:27] to hear what God is is is revealing
[1:26:30] through the through the the the the
[1:26:32] tapes. I love the tapes. I listen to
[1:26:35] them every single day. Praise God. But
[1:26:38] I'm listening for the voice of God.
[1:26:41] I'm listening for the mighty angel. I'm
[1:26:44] listening for his voice. And now his
[1:26:47] voice is in a five-fold ministry in this
[1:26:50] day and in this hour, too.
[1:26:52] As a matter of fact, his voice is in
[1:26:54] you. It's in you. It's in you. It's in
[1:26:56] you. It's in you. It's in every one of
[1:26:58] us. Amen. Praise God. Because he's
[1:27:01] coming to possess and to speak his word
[1:27:05] to this generation.
[1:27:09] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. So the
[1:27:13] influence of the fourth dimension, we
[1:27:15] know what it does. It's both good and
[1:27:18] evil. But you need to understand it. You
[1:27:22] need to be aware of it so that you can
[1:27:23] handle yourself properly in how you deal
[1:27:28] with this dimension because it's getting
[1:27:30] more and more deceptive. You think AI is
[1:27:35] incredible? Oh my gosh, it's amazing,
[1:27:38] man. I go to my phone now. My text
[1:27:41] messages, they're all summarized. Tells
[1:27:43] me just get to the point. Tells me
[1:27:45] everything that I need to know from this
[1:27:47] person. They might send me a paragraph
[1:27:48] this long. My AI in my phone is going to
[1:27:52] tell me the points of what's what's the
[1:27:54] gist of it here. I need to know, you
[1:27:56] know, and this is what pe I didn't I
[1:27:59] didn't set it up.
[1:28:01] I didn't set it up. It's just happening.
[1:28:03] Yeah,
[1:28:04] you do updates on your phones and this
[1:28:05] and that and all this technology gets in
[1:28:08] there and AI which is artificial
[1:28:10] intelligence
[1:28:12] artificial.
[1:28:13] It's got exactly what it is.
[1:28:16] It's not official.
[1:28:17] It's not God's word.
[1:28:20] It's artificial.
[1:28:22] It is knowledge being taken in in a way
[1:28:26] where you can pull it all. You can take
[1:28:29] every thing about the history of of the
[1:28:32] world and the history of a country and
[1:28:34] the history of a man or the history of a
[1:28:36] of a a a civilization and you can go in
[1:28:40] there and you can go to J chat GBT and
[1:28:42] you can ask it to just give you a
[1:28:44] summary of this and it'll draw from all
[1:28:47] of these databases all over the world
[1:28:50] and give you a clean, clear, precise
[1:28:54] thesis on exactly what you need to know.
[1:28:57] makes you think, "My gosh, I am so
[1:29:00] smart.
[1:29:01] I can get all of this information just
[1:29:03] like that."
[1:29:05] And and you know, and it'll teach you
[1:29:08] things about God that are so contrary to
[1:29:11] the word of God,
[1:29:13] but it'll sound so good and you'll
[1:29:16] think, "Man, this AI is amazing. I can
[1:29:19] start creating sermons with AI."
[1:29:22] They've got it.
[1:29:24] They've got it. I seen it. it came up.
[1:29:26] They're sending it to me. Just send us,
[1:29:29] you know, what your thoughts and, you
[1:29:31] know, some thoughts and this and that
[1:29:33] and we'll put it together for you in a
[1:29:34] way that you can present it to the
[1:29:36] people just like a professional. They're
[1:29:38] going to think that you are amazing.
[1:29:43] Imagine that
[1:29:45] in this age, in the bride age,
[1:29:50] that doesn't work.
[1:29:52] The bride only feeds on one thing,
[1:29:55] faith.
[1:29:56] The bride can't feed on knowledge. We
[1:29:58] got all the knowledge we need. Anybody
[1:30:00] can read the Bible.
[1:30:02] The Bible's being the same Bible that
[1:30:04] I'm preaching from and the scriptures
[1:30:05] that I'm preaching from here this
[1:30:07] morning. They're preaching from the
[1:30:08] exact same ones in all the different
[1:30:10] churches out there, all the different
[1:30:12] Christian churches, taking the same
[1:30:14] scriptures, everything else, but without
[1:30:16] the Holy Ghost
[1:30:18] anointing on that minister and on the
[1:30:24] people
[1:30:25] that are receiving that word that's
[1:30:27] being spoken without the Holy Ghost on
[1:30:31] that scripture,
[1:30:33] it kills.
[1:30:35] You want the scripture for it?
[1:30:36] Yes, sir. The letter kleth,
[1:30:38] but the spirit gives it life.
[1:30:41] That's the scripture for it.
[1:30:43] This is the thing that, you know, a lot
[1:30:44] of people you we'll read these
[1:30:46] scriptures. We'll see them. I I'll
[1:30:48] testify of them. I'll I'll sit and talk
[1:30:51] about scripture, but if they ain't got
[1:30:53] the Holy Ghost, it's like you're talking
[1:30:56] to a an AI.
[1:30:59] It's like, you know, it just goes in and
[1:31:01] out. Their eyes, you can see that stare.
[1:31:05] They're not receiving
[1:31:08] because
[1:31:10] to receive this word, you got to be the
[1:31:13] word.
[1:31:14] Hallelujah.
[1:31:16] You got to be the word.
[1:31:19] The ones back in the dark ages that
[1:31:21] receive the word to overcome
[1:31:25] the the the the dark ages of of where
[1:31:28] they were killing Christians one after
[1:31:30] the other. They were slaughtering them.
[1:31:34] They received
[1:31:37] light on themselves
[1:31:40] because they were the word in that day.
[1:31:44] Amen.
[1:31:45] That was going to say amen
[1:31:47] to the word. I'm trying to keep I'm
[1:31:49] trying to make this real simple. when
[1:31:51] they heard
[1:31:53] the word being ministered through the
[1:31:58] messenger, whether it was Paul
[1:32:01] or whether it was Luther or whether it
[1:32:04] was
[1:32:06] Aranius and all the other uh messengers
[1:32:09] to that to those particular ages.
[1:32:12] The reason why they heard the word was
[1:32:15] because they were the word waiting
[1:32:18] for the light. Hallelujah.
[1:32:21] You know when you know you know you know
[1:32:22] when you you know when you say I seen
[1:32:24] the light. No. What happened was the
[1:32:27] light of God's word came on you and it
[1:32:30] awoke you out of your sleep out of your
[1:32:32] amnesia.
[1:32:34] And at that point you realize that you
[1:32:36] were a Christian.
[1:32:38] I can only go back on my own experience.
[1:32:41] Many people were trying to lead me to
[1:32:42] Christ. But it wasn't until I heard this
[1:32:46] message and I heard the revelation that
[1:32:48] was coming out of John Simon, our former
[1:32:51] pastor, and the word that was coming out
[1:32:54] of him week after week. That word was
[1:32:57] feeding my soul in a way that nothing
[1:33:00] else could do it.
[1:33:02] Amen.
[1:33:03] There was just nothing else that could
[1:33:05] satisfy my soul to make me understand
[1:33:08] the word of God for my day. Why was it
[1:33:11] that why why could I see it? because I
[1:33:13] was the word.
[1:33:14] I was waiting to be awakened
[1:33:18] to the day. It's like the scripture says
[1:33:20] David or or or Joseph, was it Joseph
[1:33:23] that that had to wait for the day that
[1:33:26] his word came? It's in the it's in the
[1:33:29] the Psalms. It wasn't when his word
[1:33:32] came, it brought him into a recognition
[1:33:36] of who he was and he ended up being the
[1:33:39] savior of Egypt
[1:33:41] because it was his time. You see, the
[1:33:44] word has to come to you personal
[1:33:47] personal. This is not a family thing.
[1:33:50] This is not, oh well, if it comes to me,
[1:33:52] it's got to come to my children. No,
[1:33:54] it's got to come to you and it's got to
[1:33:55] come to the to your children.
[1:33:57] Amen.
[1:33:59] It's something personal and they woke up
[1:34:02] under the anointing of the word. It
[1:34:05] brought them into manifestation and all
[1:34:08] of a sudden they were speaking the word.
[1:34:11] That's why you can't help it. When you
[1:34:14] start to testify to somebody, you
[1:34:16] automatically are going to testify of
[1:34:19] the opening of the word, the the the the
[1:34:22] fulfillment of Malachi 4, the
[1:34:25] fulfillment of Revelations 10:7, the
[1:34:27] opening of the seven seals.
[1:34:30] You can't help it.
[1:34:31] The mighty angel come down, the open
[1:34:34] book. This is the revelation of the
[1:34:37] hour. And if you are a portion of that
[1:34:39] word, that's why that's why when the
[1:34:42] mighty angel came down with the open
[1:34:43] book, he said, "Take the book and eat
[1:34:47] the book." Because the book is the word.
[1:34:50] The the word is what awakens you to your
[1:34:52] calling and your position in your
[1:34:55] placing in the body of Christ. and you
[1:34:58] can't help but but identify with this
[1:35:01] message and identify with this church,
[1:35:04] this ministry because God placed you in
[1:35:07] the in the in the in the boundary of
[1:35:10] this ministry in this church and that's
[1:35:11] why you're here.
[1:35:14] We don't convince people to come here.
[1:35:17] We're not trying to The Bible says the
[1:35:20] Lord adds to the church.
[1:35:22] The Lord adds to the church.
[1:35:25] So that's what we're looking for. And
[1:35:27] who is the Lord? The word.
[1:35:29] And when we speak the word and we
[1:35:31] testify the word. That's why the
[1:35:33] greatest thing that you can do is just
[1:35:36] give the people your testimony.
[1:35:38] Tell them what happened. Tell them how
[1:35:40] the word became alive in you. Amen.
[1:35:42] Praise God. Let's move on here. I'm just
[1:35:45] going to go another 10 minutes and we're
[1:35:47] going to we're going to uh move into
[1:35:49] next week. Let's look at the fifth
[1:35:50] dimension now which um go to the next
[1:35:54] slide.
[1:35:57] Okay. And it is where the wicked and the
[1:35:59] unbeliever go after they die. We talked
[1:36:02] about this. Brother Brandham described
[1:36:03] this place so well in his sermon, Souls
[1:36:06] in Prison, November 10th, 1963.
[1:36:10] Hell is a dimension and is different
[1:36:13] from Hades, physical grave, or from the
[1:36:17] lake of fire. It's a dimension. The
[1:36:20] fifth dimension is just that, another
[1:36:22] dimension. And look, he goes on. He
[1:36:25] says, 'Now Jesus, after he had finished
[1:36:28] his ministry, preached to those souls
[1:36:31] that were unsavable,
[1:36:34] that could not ever be saved.
[1:36:37] Now, the Bible tells us that he went and
[1:36:40] preached to the souls that were in
[1:36:42] prison that repented not.
[1:36:46] When mercy was given to them, they
[1:36:49] spurned mercy. And now they're waiting
[1:36:52] for judgment.
[1:36:54] So in other words, when the Holy Spirit
[1:36:57] comes with the word, Jesus, he came, he
[1:37:01] was, he spoke the word. He says, "I do
[1:37:03] nothing lest the father reveals it unto
[1:37:06] me." He was coming to fulfill the plan
[1:37:09] of redemption. Everything that he was
[1:37:12] doing was according to the word. And he
[1:37:14] was he was speaking the word. And while
[1:37:16] he was preaching amongst the people,
[1:37:20] a handful, a dozen recognized who he
[1:37:23] was. Why? Because he called them. Go
[1:37:26] back into the Gospels. It wasn't that
[1:37:29] they ran to him.
[1:37:33] No,
[1:37:35] he says one day he's walking through
[1:37:39] one of the cities there. He looks over
[1:37:40] and he sees Matthew. He says, "Matthew,
[1:37:43] come follow me.
[1:37:46] The moment that Jesus spoke Matthew's
[1:37:49] name, something woke up
[1:37:52] inside of Matthew because he was a
[1:37:55] portion of the word in that day.
[1:37:58] And he could not do anything but follow
[1:38:01] the word
[1:38:03] because the word had called him.
[1:38:04] Yes. But at the same time, while Jesus
[1:38:08] was was was was speaking and talking to
[1:38:11] the people, he was also speaking to
[1:38:14] those that were that could never receive
[1:38:16] the word.
[1:38:18] Let's let's read the scripture.
[1:38:22] Let's let's move along here.
[1:38:26] Praise God forever more. Let's go to the
[1:38:28] next slide.
[1:38:32] 1 Peter 3:18-20.
[1:38:36] This is going somewhere, okay? So, just
[1:38:38] stay with me. Just just just continue to
[1:38:41] feed and and allow the Holy Spirit to to
[1:38:43] just show us what's going on and what
[1:38:46] we're producing in this hour. We want to
[1:38:48] understand our existence. For Christ
[1:38:50] also hath once suffered for sins, the
[1:38:53] just for the unjust, that he might bring
[1:38:56] us to God, being put to death in the
[1:39:00] flesh, but quickened by the spirit.
[1:39:03] He was actually coming
[1:39:06] from his Jesus came from his seventh
[1:39:10] dimension, came down and took on a a a
[1:39:14] light matter and time existence.
[1:39:18] but yet had had connection with the
[1:39:23] seventh all at the same time.
[1:39:25] Amen. He was he was God in the flesh.
[1:39:29] Remember that Emmanuel the Lord the the
[1:39:33] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:39:36] So he was here in the flesh. So hell did
[1:39:39] not have any control over him. But
[1:39:42] remember when he went to Gethsemane the
[1:39:45] eternal God had to leave him. so that
[1:39:48] that flesh could go to to Calvary.
[1:39:52] Amen.
[1:39:53] Praise God. You got to see that he was
[1:39:55] in the midst of a dimensional battle and
[1:39:58] change and and transition because he was
[1:40:01] he was redeeming. He had a plan here.
[1:40:04] These dimensions, all that we're talking
[1:40:06] about, it it all comes together and it
[1:40:09] all fits together so that this is all
[1:40:11] going to make sense by the time we're
[1:40:13] through it. Amen. At least to some of
[1:40:15] us. Praise God. which he says so he goes
[1:40:19] on here he says and so he the the flesh
[1:40:23] had to be put to death because he had to
[1:40:26] fulfill his word. We need to see
[1:40:28] redemption here. If a man sin a man had
[1:40:32] to die. So he had to put on matter and
[1:40:36] he had to become subject to time.
[1:40:39] Without time in his body
[1:40:42] he could not have died.
[1:40:44] He could not have gone to the cross.
[1:40:46] Amen.
[1:40:46] Do you see why he had to take on time?
[1:40:49] Because he had to conquer time.
[1:40:51] Amen. He had to conquer time because he
[1:40:54] was going to do it again.
[1:40:57] Hallelujah. And so which sometimes were
[1:40:59] disobedient. Now watch. By which also he
[1:41:02] went and preached unto the spirits in
[1:41:05] prison, which sometimes were
[1:41:07] disobedient. When once the long
[1:41:10] suffering of God waited in the days of
[1:41:12] Noah while the ark was preparing wherein
[1:41:15] few that is eight souls were saved by
[1:41:19] water. What's he saying here? When Jesus
[1:41:22] died
[1:41:24] and gave up the the the the the the
[1:41:27] ghost, okay,
[1:41:30] his body went into
[1:41:35] take the sixth dimensional body, his his
[1:41:40] theophony body.
[1:41:43] Okay? So that he could go because
[1:41:45] remember he could move through
[1:41:47] dimensions. He needed to go and deal
[1:41:51] with the fifth dimension because prior
[1:41:54] to his coming, there was no sixth
[1:41:56] dimension.
[1:41:59] There was no sixth dimension prior to
[1:42:01] his first coming.
[1:42:03] They were all in, look at back in the
[1:42:05] Old Testament, it showed that they were
[1:42:07] sleep. They were in paradise.
[1:42:09] They were in a place. It was death and
[1:42:12] hell. There was those that were that
[1:42:14] died in in God under the Old Testament,
[1:42:18] the ones that believed in God, but they
[1:42:20] were they were in prison
[1:42:22] in in in and they were like souls that
[1:42:25] were in prison that were waiting for the
[1:42:29] for the for the uh for the uh
[1:42:32] the manifestation of of the seventh
[1:42:35] angel, the the the mighty uh Lord God
[1:42:40] Elohim, the seventh dimensional God that
[1:42:43] was the light in the beginning of all
[1:42:45] things for him to come down that could
[1:42:47] move through all those dimensions to go
[1:42:50] down into that fifth dimension take the
[1:42:53] keys from Satan
[1:42:56] and that's why you can go back and read
[1:42:58] that the saints of old were seen in
[1:43:01] Jerusalem because they came up in that
[1:43:04] first resurrection
[1:43:07] this was a type of something that he's
[1:43:10] going to do again
[1:43:12] That's what we're in the midst of right
[1:43:15] now.
[1:43:16] And that's why it's important for us to
[1:43:18] understand why Jesus had to come in the
[1:43:21] first resurrection so that he could
[1:43:24] prove that he could do it again. Amen.
[1:43:27] For the saints that were going to be
[1:43:28] down the road, 2,000 years down the
[1:43:31] road, those that were going to fulfill
[1:43:34] the seven church ages to bring Christ
[1:43:37] back again in the fullness of his word.
[1:43:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:43:41] And so here now he goes down into that
[1:43:43] fifth dimension. He brings up those that
[1:43:46] died in him under the old and he creates
[1:43:50] the sixth dimension for them.
[1:43:53] Now there's a sixth dimension where the
[1:43:55] redeemed are waiting.
[1:44:00] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:44:04] Let's go to the next scripture.
[1:44:08] He says the like figure.
[1:44:11] Now pay attention where unto even
[1:44:14] baptism
[1:44:15] doth also now save us.
[1:44:19] Now here Peter is talking about this
[1:44:21] this this redemption,
[1:44:24] this plan of salvation, this move of
[1:44:27] Jesus through these dimensions who had
[1:44:29] to go and preach to those souls that
[1:44:31] were in prison. This whole process
[1:44:35] brings us into the picture. the like
[1:44:38] figure where unto that's why we we say
[1:44:41] to somebody, have you received the Holy
[1:44:43] Ghost since you believed?
[1:44:46] What do you mean? I got baptized as a
[1:44:49] baby. No babies baptism, you can't find
[1:44:54] it in the scripture. How does a baby
[1:44:56] believe and get saved? He that believeth
[1:44:59] and is baptized shall be saved. That's
[1:45:02] why you Why do you bring up baptism?
[1:45:04] Well, there it is right there. Not that
[1:45:07] it saves you, not the putting away of
[1:45:10] filth of the flesh. You need the blood
[1:45:13] to do that. Amen. Glory to God. But the
[1:45:16] answer of a good conscience towards God
[1:45:19] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In
[1:45:22] other words, you've recognized that the
[1:45:25] that the mighty God himself has come to
[1:45:29] you personal.
[1:45:30] Amen.
[1:45:31] Amen. And and when that happens, you
[1:45:34] can't wait to get to that water because
[1:45:36] now you are expressing something on the
[1:45:39] outside of something that's taken place
[1:45:42] on the inside. Because when Jesus comes
[1:45:45] and says your sins are forgiven, that's
[1:45:48] a part of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:50] That's a part of your salvation. That's
[1:45:53] something that you receive. That's a
[1:45:55] gift that he gives to you.
[1:45:58] But it doesn't it doesn't mean that
[1:46:00] you're saved because you're getting
[1:46:02] baptized. It means that you've you've
[1:46:05] accepted the the the the sacrifice of
[1:46:08] him coming to the earth. You've accepted
[1:46:11] the fact that he's he's going to take
[1:46:13] you out of this dimension now because
[1:46:16] this is all about dimensional change
[1:46:18] that we're we're in the dispensation of
[1:46:19] the rapture. So we're looking for
[1:46:22] change. We're looking for the change and
[1:46:24] the change can only come as a result of
[1:46:27] receiving the Holy Ghost. And he says
[1:46:30] here, he says, "By the resurrection of
[1:46:32] Jesus Christ, who is gone into heaven
[1:46:36] and on the right hand of God, angels,
[1:46:39] authorities, and powers be made subject
[1:46:42] unto him."
[1:46:45] This is where we are headed.
[1:46:49] That's why understanding authorities
[1:46:53] that when you come under the authority
[1:46:55] of the word of God, everything that
[1:46:57] we've been saying here is when we say
[1:47:00] repent and be baptized, have you
[1:47:02] received the Holy Ghost? If there's a
[1:47:05] representation in you for God's word,
[1:47:08] you're going to you're going to say,
[1:47:09] "Amen, brother." where just like the
[1:47:11] unic when Philip was explaining to him
[1:47:14] as they were walking around as soon as
[1:47:15] they came to a pool of water the unic
[1:47:17] says hey there's a pool of water
[1:47:19] so what was it that Philip was telling
[1:47:21] him why was this so important that they
[1:47:24] that because he received the birth he
[1:47:27] received the awakening and it was now an
[1:47:29] outward expression and he showed that he
[1:47:32] had received Christ in his day and his
[1:47:35] hour
[1:47:38] changes everything Amen.
[1:47:40] Let the musicians come.
[1:47:44] This is the hour that we are living in,
[1:47:46] saints.
[1:47:48] This is why it's so important to
[1:47:51] understand
[1:47:52] that we're not just here in this light,
[1:47:59] matter, time body that's influenced by
[1:48:02] the fourth and the fifth dimension.
[1:48:06] With the Holy Ghost, you have power over
[1:48:10] the fifth dimension.
[1:48:13] Jesus says, "I give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:17] I give you power."
[1:48:19] He says, he says, "Rejoice
[1:48:23] not that you can cast out devils, but
[1:48:25] rejoice to know that your name is
[1:48:26] written in heaven."
[1:48:29] How do you know your name's written in
[1:48:31] heaven? Because you're you're you're
[1:48:32] hearing this message and you're saying,
[1:48:34] "Amen, brother. I hear what you're
[1:48:36] saying. I understand now it's not just,
[1:48:39] you know, an existence here where where,
[1:48:42] you know, that's why a lot of Christians
[1:48:43] are living in miserable existences. They
[1:48:46] don't understand the influence of these
[1:48:49] dimensions on their lives and they don't
[1:48:51] understand them. And so they're in this
[1:48:53] thought process in their minds, even
[1:48:55] Christians to this day, that if I don't
[1:48:57] live right, I'm going to hell. I'm just
[1:49:00] going to go to hell if I don't live
[1:49:01] right. If you are a son or a daughter of
[1:49:04] God, you can never go to hell.
[1:49:08] Because you have the life of God in you
[1:49:10] which is eternal.
[1:49:13] You were never ever destined for hell.
[1:49:18] How do you know that? Because you can
[1:49:19] recognize the word in your day.
[1:49:23] It takes you out of the rest of the
[1:49:26] general public
[1:49:28] in the understanding of of Christianity.
[1:49:32] Amen. Praise God.
[1:49:33] Amen.
[1:49:34] This is who we are.
[1:49:35] We're not governed by this fifth
[1:49:38] dimension. We're not controlled by it.
[1:49:40] And we have no place with it.
[1:49:42] Amen.
[1:49:44] It it it comes under our feet. It
[1:49:47] places, listen, and it places it on the
[1:49:50] right hand of God, angels and
[1:49:52] authorities and powers being made
[1:49:55] subject unto him. And if he's with you,
[1:49:58] then
[1:50:02] this world is under our feet.
[1:50:06] Now, I'm not being arrogant in saying
[1:50:08] that. I'm talking about a revelation and
[1:50:11] an understanding. Don't let the enemy
[1:50:14] tell you that you are not
[1:50:17] who the scripture says that you are.
[1:50:19] Amen.
[1:50:21] Let us believe what God is revealing to
[1:50:25] us through these teachings and through
[1:50:27] these uh times of refreshing from the
[1:50:31] word of God. He's led us into this. And
[1:50:35] all I can say is I've been I've been
[1:50:37] having wonderful times with the Lord as
[1:50:40] I'm studying all of this, but I can't
[1:50:42] convey to you what I'm seeing. You know,
[1:50:45] like I see things and and and I can't
[1:50:47] put it into words. It's hard for me to
[1:50:49] put it into words, but when I'm hearing
[1:50:51] and when I'm feeding and when I'm
[1:50:53] reading, it's like, oh, glory to God.
[1:50:56] These dimensions are so important for us
[1:50:58] to understand. Otherwise, we get we get
[1:51:01] caught and and we we start living
[1:51:03] miserable. We start being moved any way
[1:51:05] we want. Satan wants to come and ruin
[1:51:07] your day. He just anoints one of your
[1:51:09] children. He anoints a a a certain boss
[1:51:12] at work or a or a co-orker or he you
[1:51:16] know he and you got to realize you do
[1:51:18] not fight against uh you you're not
[1:51:20] fighting against flesh and blood. You're
[1:51:22] fighting against powers, principalities
[1:51:24] and dominions. And more so now than ever
[1:51:27] before, saints,
[1:51:30] praise God forever more.
[1:51:32] We will stop right there and next week
[1:51:36] we're going to be looking
[1:51:39] at the sixth dimension a little closer
[1:51:42] so that we can understand
[1:51:45] why it's so important
[1:51:47] to understand and to see and recognize
[1:51:52] the change that's now taking place in
[1:51:55] this rapture dispensation. Let us pray.
[1:52:00] our gracious heavenly father. We are so
[1:52:02] grateful.
[1:52:04] Lord, I know a lot was said here today,
[1:52:08] Father. And I I pray, oh God, that uh it
[1:52:12] will it will go into the hearts of the
[1:52:14] people somehow they'll be able to draw
[1:52:16] from it, Lord. And it'll just give them
[1:52:19] courage, confidence, and strength to
[1:52:21] keep pressing, Lord, overcoming the the
[1:52:24] snares and the influences of the fourth
[1:52:28] and the fifth dimension that just seems
[1:52:30] to be uh oh God, just pounding pounding
[1:52:34] us, Lord. The more we expose it, it
[1:52:37] seems the more it wants to try to pound
[1:52:38] us. But Lord, we're not relying upon our
[1:52:41] own ability. We're relying on the
[1:52:43] anointing of the Holy Spirit that you've
[1:52:46] placed upon our lives. And I pray, oh
[1:52:49] God, in the name of Jesus Christ that
[1:52:51] your spirit will move through the hearts
[1:52:54] of the people and give them victory this
[1:52:56] week as they meet the challenges which
[1:52:58] they will meet. But you be there,
[1:53:01] Father, to give them, bring back a
[1:53:03] thought, bring back a scripture, bring
[1:53:05] back a quote, something that will
[1:53:08] strengthen them and encourage them to
[1:53:09] press on and to overcome.
[1:53:13] Lord, we thank you so much for what
[1:53:15] you're doing. Father, we bless you. We
[1:53:17] praise you. We give you all the glory in
[1:53:21] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:53:23] Amen. Praise God.
[1:53:28] You got a song?
[1:53:32] Amen.
[1:53:34] Hallelujah.

[1:53:38] know, I I'll be honest with you. I've
[1:53:40] had over the years a little bit of
[1:53:45] trouble singing this song sometimes, but
[1:53:48] um I understand it a lot better right
