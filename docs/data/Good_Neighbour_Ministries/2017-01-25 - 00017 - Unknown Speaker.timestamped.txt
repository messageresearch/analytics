[4:09] Jesus answered and said what will that I
[4:13] should
[4:16] do what do you want and that's the same
[4:19] question I'm asking today what do you

[15:33] thirst of H and and we try in many ways
[15:37] to fulfill
[15:39] that we are all need people who don't
[15:44] [Music]
[15:52] have mhm by by just
[15:57] breathing the next next gas of bread to
[16:01] take that's a need because you need to
[16:03] live stop reading and see
[16:05] [Music]
[16:07] what's Simple Thing as
[16:10] that you need
[16:12] food don't eat as you want to die that's
[16:17] a need you need
[16:19] clothing if it's- 40° outside just
[16:26] go you to freeze mhm that's need CL all
[16:32] these things are necessary for this
[16:35] Natural Life what
[16:42] about
[16:45] hallelujah thank you Lord you see while
[16:48] Jesus was here in human flesh his
[16:51] purpose was to set to do the will of the
[16:54] father and that's what he
[16:57] did God said
[17:01] to
[17:01] eat to live to enjoy all the the the
[17:07] physical blessings you think that's all
[17:10] the need that we
[17:12] have the purpose that we will here on
[17:15] this enjoy everything that said before
[17:18] us there is more than just these
[17:22] physical
[17:24] things amen
[17:27] hallelujah
[17:29] thank you
[17:30] Lord and Jesus accomplished that work
[17:34] but we got one motive that is to set our
[17:37] face to do the will of the father and
[17:40] stay with
[17:42] it as they say as they said be like a
[17:46] postage stand you're stuck on it to do
[17:49] the
[17:51] job till you reach your final
[17:54] destination stick with it the purpose
[17:57] God has called you here for
[17:59] amen and fulfill it amen hallelujah
[18:03] praise be to
[18:06] God

[18:13] want and that's up to them see when you
[18:17] decide to serve the Lord Jesus Christ
[18:19] you know the whole world sometimes the
[18:22] think
[18:24] like when you separate yourself from the
[18:28] world and you made a decision to serve
[18:30] the Lord
[18:33] amen you are going against this
[18:37] tree going against the flood of the
[18:39] world system you have lot of
[18:42] opposition amen don't you have B in your
[18:46] life as a
[18:49] Christian if you don't something it's
[18:51] not
[18:53] right because when people recognize you
[18:56] when Satan and all his F recognize you
[19:00] that you are one of God's children they
[19:04] come against you in
[19:05] every every area at work even when
[19:09] you're driving on the street they don't
[19:12] know you but something that they
[19:15] recognize in you that they got to oppose
[19:18] you in all different ways because you
[19:20] know why whatever is inside of them
[19:23] recognize that you are son and
[19:26] daughter Hallelujah
[19:29] you see when the trials and Faith come
[19:31] just to
[19:32] perfect and that's another area of our
[19:35] life we can de with that's a big one
[19:38] testing and trying you know and we've
[19:41] been through that and we in that every
[19:44] single
[19:46] moment that a Son of God needs to be
[19:49] tested and tried and improved hallelujah
[19:52] thank you
[19:55] Lord we are waiting to find out where
[19:58] God God wants us and then go do you want
[20:03] to find out from God what is your
[20:05] purpose
