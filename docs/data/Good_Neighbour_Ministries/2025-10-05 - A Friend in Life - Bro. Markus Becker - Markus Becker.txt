But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear, which means respect, will I worship towards thy holy temple. Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of my enemies. Make thy way straight before my face, for there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their inward parts is very wickedness. Their throat is an open sepure. They flattered with their tongue. Destroy thou them, oh God. Let them fall by their own counsel. cast them out in the multitude of their transgression, for they have rebelled against thee. But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice. Amen.

But we're going to ask uh brother We have brother Tom and sister Sharon with us this morning from from down in uh Connecticut, Florida. But uh Brother Tom used to be a deacon here uh years ago.

Brother, you got the spoken word and I'm going to believe it. &gt;&gt; And we had fellowship with uh brother Mike and sister. It's like, you know, time never passed away because it's the kindred spirits. And that's what we have to look in one another to see that kindred spirit, that spirit of Christ, right? Because that's what edifies and strengthens. God bless you, saints. It's a pleasure. I I saw in the videos this wall. It's such a blessing. And I know I I believe uh it's brother Danny's influence and I just appreciate him as a as a brother and uh I see his leadership taking control and the gifts that God has placed him as a businessman and and the passion and the vision that he has, you know, and that's what this assembly needs is a vision. Pastor Simon brought us so far with the vision that he had. And it takes a lot to lead a flock. takes a lot to me.

It's been revealed to her what's in the book. She's she's looking at all those promises. She had no idea that they could be this great. Amen. That she had no idea that he was going to save the best till last. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Praise God. Amen. Welcome into the house of the Lord this morning. I welcome everybody, all of our guests.

You've got a purpose of God laying within you by the Holy Ghost. Amen. And this so you can't you can't wait for those doors to open. Amen. Praise God. I was excited when I when I was told, you know, Sister Saron and Brother Daniel and uh telling me that Brother Marcus was going to be coming through. I didn't really know Brother Marcus, but I thought, "Okay, I I've heard good things, though." And so I said, "I'm going to I'm just going to peek in on him a little bit." And I peaked in on him a little bit. Amen. And I listened to, you know, a couple of services. I fell in love with him. I said, "Glory to God." I said, "It's the same Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That burns within the hearts of the bride. You know, this is how you know that that you're you're in the body. Amen. This is the thunders. This is the unwritten part of the word that you can't explain it, but you just love them. You just you just know there's a unity. There's a faith. Amen. That that that burns within our hearts is because we love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a love for him and automatically you feel his love towards you. Amen. Praise God.

I believe that with all of my heart. We had such a wonderful time here. A men's fellowship. We came here just expecting him to just, you know, share a few words. Well, the Lord Jesus showed up. Amen. And he he just he just laid it all on into our hearts and he just vindicated exactly where we are the day that we're living in. And it's exciting, saints. Amen. So, at this time, I'd like to invite our precious brother Marcus. God bless you, my brother. Have the liberty of the Holy Spirit on your heart. Amen. We certainly love and appreciate you. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Father, may you just speak to them. Thank you, brother. And Lord, may you give me the right words to express and may you give the right hearts to understand what I want to say. Father, bless the church back home in Beaslesburg. Bless the bride here in Canada. Father, wherever they gather this morning and please, Father, may you bless Israel because those who bless Israel, they are blessed. Father, &gt;&gt; so we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother, for the So, let's while we're standing, let's open the word of the Lord in the first book of Kings. And in my Bible, it's page 481, but it doesn't tell you much, but it's first Kings chapter 20 verse one. First Kings 20 verse one. And Benhadat the king of Syria gathered all the hosts together. And there were 30 and two kings with him, horses and chariots, and went and besieged Samaria and wared against it. And he sent messengers to Ahab, king of Israel, into the city, and said unto him, thus sayest Benhad, "Thy silver, and thy gold is mine, and thy wives also, and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine." And the king of Israel answered and said, "My Lord, O king, according to thy saying, I'm thine, and all that I have." And the messengers came again and said, "Thus speakest Ben Hadat, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children." Amen. And we read from verse 28, same chapter. And there came a man of God and spake unto the king of Israel and said, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, because the Syrians have said, 'The Lord is the God of the hills, but he is not the God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord." &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessing to the reading office where we may be seated. and I greet you all very warmly and I really thank Pastor Danny for the nice invitation, for the real welcoming spirits and the nice words. It's a great honor for me to be here and I heard many good things about this church, its former pastor. We met uh at the at the at the uh marriage of of of Tina and and um Daniel and uh we had a very good impression and now the same very good impression when we met you brother. It's a great honor to be here and I thank you very much for that for that time. Um I remember years ago when brother Tim Humes when he was in the message I was preaching there and when I was there for the first time he was a little bit taking too much time and he thought I was nervous so he said please church you must understand brother Marcus is one of those Hitler boys and I was sitting in the did did I hear anything wrong so we are not Hitler boys okay we are we are family of God okay we are friends Okay. And uh I really really love that place the way you made up the church. I heard that some precious sisters had their good input into it and and it looks very nice and the character of the people. So it's a great joy and friends are predestinated. Anyhow, so definitely so when when when Sarin and when when Tina left, I mean they they are I don't say it just by politeness but they are very very precious sister you know both of them really and they have a clear vision where to go they have an understanding of of spiritual things and uh we found out that both Danny's are very wonderful gentlemen you know real brothers and we are very confident that they will make their way with the lord so we're really we are really at peace, you know, and um uh we're very happy for this a fine church. Brother Garrett, the pastor sends his greeting. Andreas Ringan, another pastor sends his greeting. the whole church in Beaslesburg send a greeting and it's for us it was honestly it was a loss because uh I mean Sarin because of the music and because of of her taste or her feeling for design and uh being a really a loyal sister and Tina uh really one of the helpers in the youth meetings okay really an organizer and so we we we we didn't have a brain drain in Germany but we had a heart drain in in Germany and so we are praying that God will will will restore us some good people and so you are fortunate to have good uh people coming from from Germany over here to &gt;&gt; to to just be a part of the of the of the whole dream team let me say like this the dream team so this morning I thank again uh I know as you don't know me and there must be some questions in your heart who's brother Marcus beside that uh he comes from Germany what does the belief. So, so I thank you again for the confidence and I would like if that is fine for me that I will just share things from my heart. Huh? And and I have no notes but I have I always work with some pictures and it gives me always a red line to that I don't miss my subject. And uh there's even a little video and we are not normally in in Christian churches we don't have videos but I have uh just two minutes. It's nothing ugly. Okay, it's fit for a church. Okay, don't fear. Okay, fear not. But it's not believers. Okay, but I will explain you later. So, please don't uh don't be offended by this. It's just let's let's say I felt on my heart. Let's make a a little youth meeting this morning. Okay. A little youth meeting. Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's what I want to say. The youth up to 80. Okay. And and if you're older than 80, you are you you can leave but only with permission of the parents. Okay. [Music] [Laughter] And and I would like I would like I would like to not to preach at you but to share things even from life experience. And I would like to entitled that sermon a friend in life. A friend in life. Now we realized that the message of the hour that we believe does not come from America. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan was just a voice. It's not an American message. It's not a Brandon message. It's not a Jeffersonville message. &gt;&gt; It comes from the presence of Almighty. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is not a cult. &gt;&gt; Why should I become cultish? &gt;&gt; We have too much churches in the message. What they play is cold war. &gt;&gt; But cold war pertains to Europe. Okay. This message that we believe is not a sect. &gt;&gt; Why should I become sectarian? &gt;&gt; Amen. The message that we believe is not a denomination. Why should I become denominational? &gt;&gt; Why should I play the game of the devil? &gt;&gt; And when I'm traveling around, I said, "Look, you have to understand not everybody in the message is mature." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not everybody is spiritual. You never uncchristianize people. You never you never put them out of the plan of God because God said to brother Bram, "Mom, always love you. All that you love will be there." But there's still time to grow, &gt;&gt; to take childish things away. &gt;&gt; God will not the marriage, the the the rapture will not God will not marry a baby, &gt;&gt; not a teenager. &gt;&gt; God will marry a woman. She knows where she comes from. She knows where she's standing. You have do not have to baby her around. And so we understand the message of the hour is is it is the voice of our father. &gt;&gt; Amen. And by that I remember when I was younger and my age uh we in Germany when we had German courses we had to make interpretations of the book. We have great writers in Germany like Gert like Schiller I think for America is like like William Faulner is that correct? Shakespeare &gt;&gt; Shakespeare for example. Okay. And at a certain but he was not American. So don't please okay your doctrine is no no taxation without representation. Huh? We we message believe we think about the theophony in the rep representation but the the first father's day. But let me talk about Shakespeare. You're completely right brother. And I remember when we were when I was 17 18 years old that we were reading these books and I want to be honest with you I had no idea uh what what is the intention of the writer and I thought what is the intention of the writer ask him why do you ask me okay what is the intention of the writer so after all these years my daughter she she was in school and uh what happened is that she was reading the same books that I was in school for interpretation that I was reading when I was a young person. So one night I couldn't sleep. So I took one of those Schiller books, those Gerta books and I was reading and everything became clear. Everything was clear. I mean there's little little just little mentions and I understood what is going around. Okay. I I could I could read between the lines. But what does it mean? The book was the same &gt;&gt; but God changed the reader of that book. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must understand when brother Brmond said the Bible became a new book, God didn't change the Bible, but God came in this generation with the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; So we can read the Bible different. &gt;&gt; So it takes all the radicalism away &gt;&gt; because the Bible says in the in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery, not mysteries. &gt;&gt; Scoffield had mysteries. Some of them were correct, some were not correct. But the mystery means God reveals who he is, &gt;&gt; how he thinks. &gt;&gt; And therefore, we can be transformed in the image of God because now we understand our father. &gt;&gt; We tried Pentecostalism, it never worked. &gt;&gt; We tried reformation, it never worked. We tried we tried free love, it never worked. I mean, we tried denominationism, it never worked. But what worked is the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. placed in our hearts. &gt;&gt; So, so, so let's take that uh that uh little story here that we have a king of Israel and we have an an opponent by the name of Benhadat. And Benhadat, he he comes to be a uh how do you call a challenger. He challenges Israel. And brother Brandon says he says Elvis Presley came to challenge the church as he learned these maneuvers in the Pentecostal church at that time. We come out of Pentecost. So therefore we understand very well. So we must understand there's a lot of things today. I see the cell phones. I see the internet. I see many many things which are challenges and we have to find an answer for this. Legalism will never make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Legalism is fit to frustrate the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it takes revelation. &gt;&gt; It takes substance. &gt;&gt; Okay. So in all these years, we didn't become more worldly. We have the same standard as we has in the beginning. But we we were leaving that kind of legalistic foolishness that we were under. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we were younger, we want to be more spiritual than brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; But every legalist is a person who is insecure in his heart. &gt;&gt; That's his problem. He needs the rules. And more rules, the more happy he is. But our rule is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I said we will not keep the church clean by more pressure. What the church keeps clean is the Holy Ghost in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we understand that God sent a man and says to the king at Ahab at that time. So, be be of good cheer because I will protect you. If you have your own children, brother, when I was young, we were legalists, but I got children, at least one daughter. When you have children, you turn from a legalist to a realist. &gt;&gt; And you find out in your life that you can do nothing without God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's not God's time, you will not change anything. &gt;&gt; And God, the Holy Ghost is there first to change things. But until God changes them, we need uh patience &gt;&gt; to just care, just lay everything into God's hands. So God gave them the great victory and they came back. And the problem for the uh Syrians, they didn't know Jehovah Gyra. They thought he is the God of the mountains. And so God sent a messenger and said, "Look, I will show them. I'm the God who cares for you &gt;&gt; in the valleys and on the mountains." &gt;&gt; I'm not the God of Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; I'm not a God of a convention. &gt;&gt; Brother, this message is not a doctrine. This message is a relationship &gt;&gt; between our father and us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And my father is my bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And my father is my king. And my father is my savior. And my father is my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So before we enter in some of the things of life circumstances for young people, let's go a little bit into the spiritual part. And if the technicians will help me. When I'm preaching to the young people, I will always have a part uh for the adults. Let me call them adults. something really spiritual meat. When I'm preaching to the adult, I have always included a part for the young people so that everybody leaves the church without having with with having anything. So I don't know if that if that wording is correct because I was just translating it this morning by Google translator. But when you deal with people, you must make a difference. when when is a person unable to do something or when he doesn't want to change something. Okay, there's a big difference. We should never throw the baby with the bath. You must find out does the person not can that isn't he able to do it or doesn't he want to do it? a person comes and and to make myself clear we want to help this morning people who are not able let me say who are not st who are standing in their own way who want to be different but they cannot change unless god changes them but I want to make that thing clear as you don't know me as a person if somebody says look I want to I want to live in in free love I want to have three three girlfriends I want to drink I want to smoke but at the same time I want to sing here in the choir Now I would say you can live as much as you want but not here &gt;&gt; because this is the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Okay? If you choose to live your own life, live your own life but not here. &gt;&gt; But there is people who are always trespassing and they don't want to do it. And these people we have to give a helping hand. &gt;&gt; Okay? Because we are not helping people by just dis by just uh uh disrespecting them. This world needs a needs a a helping hand for those who want. &gt;&gt; Okay, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Did I make myself clear? Okay, we are not we are not inviting every spirit into our churches. &gt;&gt; We're not inviting them. If you want to live your life, live your life. Okay. But you're inviting people who wants to receive the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and those who want to be right with God. &gt;&gt; But sometime it takes a long time until they come into a victorious life and then it takes that church who has a feeling for the human part of people. &gt;&gt; Okay, that is the the balance in all things. Okay, if you help me with the next thing. So first we have to understand one thing brother Blame said. So he first was God Jehovah and out of him let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it. Let's see coming out of space where there was nothing. Let's make it a little white light like a mystic light like a halo. And that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning. That was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father. That was what was in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. In the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos. A part of God that went out of God. &gt;&gt; Look there is a difference and brother Bra said the first thing and if I walk around again that's good for you. Okay. Yeah. Uh you therefore you understand I'm not a German. Huh? The only thing the only thing that I know I'm a German because I always have a white shirt. A German when you pray have a white shirt and long sleeves. You know &gt;&gt; it's not in the message. It's not in the Bible. It's pure culture. &gt;&gt; So, so we when we were younger, we were fighting for cultures. Now we understood I mean cultures are cultures. Opinions are like noses. Everyone has one. Okay. Okay. So, so brother says the first thing that God created were the angels. Here he says the first thing that came out of God was logos. That was I will not have time but that was the beginning or that was the reason for Constantine inviting the people for the council of Nika because they wanted to find out if Jesus was divine or not. Is he part of the godhead or not? Okay. Is he just a special man? You see and we find out some people said if you see the father you see me and the other group said yes but Jesus said my god my god why does thou have forsaken me. So there were different quotes. Okay. So if I take my life I build it up many many things. I created a house. I built many many things but I only burst one daughter. Amen. &gt;&gt; The difference between my creation and my birth was part of me is in my daughter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My DNA is in my daughter. &gt;&gt; So there is a difference between creations and part of God. &gt;&gt; All the angels were created &gt;&gt; but the family of God is part of him. &gt;&gt; There's a big difference. &gt;&gt; That is your worth. That's your dignity. &gt;&gt; Please understand when we preach, we are not preaching to colors. &gt;&gt; We preach to theophanes. &gt;&gt; So please don't come to me with inferior complex because of races or superior complexes because of races. I we are what we are by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's let let's forget these childy things of trying to play the victim. You must understand the history. I'm not interested in the history. I'm interested in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so you must understand that brother Brandham says the as Eve was in Adam. Amen. The bride was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember when God called Adam, he says, "Adam, where are you?" Two people came &gt;&gt; because Eve had no name. She got her name when she fell. &gt;&gt; Eve was part of Adam. God called Adam, where are you? Two people came. &gt;&gt; So when when when when when the logos came out of God, it was not another person. So I feel sorry for those who believe there is two God, two persons in the Godhead because brother Brmond said go never said God created the son. God became son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The human part of of Jesus Christ. That's another thing. But it's a big doctrine in itself. &gt;&gt; Okay. But there's only one God. &gt;&gt; Amen. One person. No two. No two persons. &gt;&gt; No. No. So if the logos was part of God, okay, that logos became a theophony. &gt;&gt; Melchazedc. I mean that Melzdc became Jesus Christ. Okay. When the bride was in Jesus Christ in what form ever? Okay. Um just quote the prophet. When the bride was in Christ, then the bride was in Melkazedc. &gt;&gt; And then the bride was in the pillar of fire in the beginning. &gt;&gt; And then the bride was in God in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Brother, brother brother, brother brother. If you're part of God, Amen. Nobody can preach you into the bride &gt;&gt; and nobody can preach you out of the bride. &gt;&gt; But beside the bride, there is people who will be saved. That is so important to keep a balance on the on the mercy seat on the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Ah, it's not only the bride. There's people who will become &gt;&gt; who will get eternal life even at the white throne judgment. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we understand. Please make the next one. So we understand that brother says the eternal thoughts of God. Let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal? If you can see this you will see many things. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a gate. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you don't see this, you just see God send a prophet. &gt;&gt; But you never find yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you see this, you will see many things. God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior. He is omniscience. He has never had a new thought about anything because all these thoughts he always had and always will have. And because uh he knows the end from the beginning because he's God. Thus the thoughts of God are eternal. They are real. They are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real eternal and part of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you must understand there is people on this earth that God was thinking about. &gt;&gt; Okay. You you know that joke with with the German coast guard. Amen. He's he's he's not he's learning English because he has a new uh job in Canada. Okay. And he's the first day and he hears mayday mayday mayday. We are thinking and he says h what are you thinking about? That's a that's for the Germans try to speak English. Okay. What are you thinking about? There's people and if I make these little jokes not to be joke but I feel free therefore they understand. Okay. &gt;&gt; There's people that God thought about. God knew the end from the beginning. &gt;&gt; But there is people on this earth. They are the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; Quote brother Brandon. God in the beginning was alone with his thoughts. &gt;&gt; In in other words, he wasn't alone. &gt;&gt; In other words, he wasn't alone because his thoughts are part of God. They are eternal. They are already substance. &gt;&gt; And God took our lives and and and and and throwed us in seven church ages over seven continents. And God put part of himself into us because David said in the Psalms, God makes everything perfect in his time. He even places eternity into our hearts. &gt;&gt; And there's only one who's eternal. That's God himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, brother Brandham said, "God made a picture of us before the foundation of the world." &gt;&gt; Quote, "Brother Brandham, and here we were." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Therefore, a message believer has no reason to become arrogant. &gt;&gt; We have no reason to become arrogant because but we are proud of our father. &gt;&gt; So God throwed us in seven church ages over seven continents in all kind of races. And God knows one thing. When the time will be over, the family of God is complete. &gt;&gt; No, nobody is missing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was the first messenger who said, "God is not anymore complete without you." &gt;&gt; Who could say this? &gt;&gt; This Bible became a new book. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Therefore, we are privileged people. &gt;&gt; Nobody can preach. Therefore, we cannot preach fear because nobody can preach you into the bride. Nobody can preach you out of the bright. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Please make the next one. Therefore, brother Brand says just like the little dew drop. I know it's too much chemistry, but but there's a congelling of humidity. Understand our atmosphere. And when the nights get cold and c dark, it fell from heaven and drops upon the ground. It fell from somewhere. But the next morning before the sun come up, it's laying there. The little fellow shivering. But just let the sun come up and watch it go shining. It's happy. Why? The son is going to call it right back where it come from. &gt;&gt; And that's the way with a Christian. Hallelujah. We know when we walk in the presence of God, something in us tell us that we come from somewhere and we are going back again by the power that is pulling us. &gt;&gt; You don't have to push the bride. &gt;&gt; God is pulling. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have the third pull. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Somebody something in you tells you that you come from somewhere. &gt;&gt; That is your dignity. &gt;&gt; Nobody can preach you out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So when the sun comes up, God calls for the humility. Blessed be the name of the Lord that we are not in Laia anymore. We are not in darkness. But what time do we live in? It's there's a man who can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; It's the rising of the sun. A brother came to me and said, "Brother Marcus, we are all in Laudis here." I said, "Maybe you, but not me &gt;&gt; and not me. We live in Laia because Angela Merkel is not the president in the millennium." I understand that. &gt;&gt; Okay. Outside the world is still in LA here, but the bride is not in La is here because the bride is not poor. &gt;&gt; The bride is not blind. The bride is not wretched. &gt;&gt; Amen. This day, this scripture is fulfilled. Brother Brandham says three years ago it was a prophecy. Now it's history. Revelation 10. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And we can say brother Brand left the scene but a greater than Solomon left is here. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I want the color people say preach it man. Don't teach it but I'm I many time preach in Africa say brother Marcus is a black man in a white skin. That is there is and I feel really at home there God. So God bless you all. Please make the next one. So what happens now? Put on the spiritual jacket. But in my in my work I'm I'm working as a as a social worker. Okay. I help in the integration of the refugees of people coming from Syria from Afghanistan. Everything that you read in the news. Brother, you must understand even if a person is not a believer, he has a soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in respecting people. &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in having a a heart for a dying world, brother. &gt;&gt; Brother, that is what the prophet teach taught us. &gt;&gt; If we if if we miss the empathy, this message is just a doctrine. &gt;&gt; It's it just gives us a superior complex. &gt;&gt; Amen. But people even, you know, uh and and I have to respect them because they never came to Germany to become Christians. They are Muslims. Okay. But Thank you very much. Is that fine? All is well. I I use this. That's that's very perfect. So So these young people, they said to me, "Mr. Becca, one day we will make a good Muslim out of you." He said, "No, I don't I don't think so. I don't think that will work. But I respect you." Okay. But but but you must understand that that here comes brother Brandon speaks about amnesia. People forgot who they are. Okay? And he you can call it psychology. It's not it's the message. &gt;&gt; It's the message because God understands life. &gt;&gt; Okay? Now this amnesia we are told it's caused because it had to h it's to be by a place where you cannot identify yourself. Now it's an unusual thing. I don't have it don't happen too often but it causes from a shock. Okay. Brother explains World War I these people saw all these grenades and bomb and they got a shock and that soldiers did not know anymore who they are. Okay. Worry will cause it. Therefore, gospel is always good news. &gt;&gt; Always good news. Worry will cause it. And another thing said, brother Brandon, if uh it causes it among the people is getting between two opinions. Therefore, today you have to protect the pulpit. You cannot let everybody brings his doctrine because if you give too much rooms for nonsense even in the message, people will come into an amnesia because they are too long between two opinions. Okay? So you must understand that when Adam and Eve came upon this earth, they were not babies. They came as adults. They didn't come as a baby. &gt;&gt; Okay? They came as adults. We came the natural way. Okay? I want to say this. I was there at the birth of my daughter. Okay. Yeah. My my wife needed one helper. I needed two. That that was honestly that was too much for me. Okay. A birth is Okay. So, we got only one. I'm thank God for this. Okay. So, what happens is this that a birth according to brother Brandham is a mess. Okay. We're changing. That's fine. A birth is a mess. Okay. So when we came on this earth, we didn't come as adults, as babies. And we came, let me say, in a complete disaster. &gt;&gt; You understand? Amen. It was it was a shock. A birth is a shock for the mother and for the child. Okay? So you remember the first thing when you came on earth that you got was a spanky. And the midwife said, "You will get more in life." And brother Blamy said, "Amnesia comes by a shock." And therefore, we came on the earth and we did not know who we were. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; We had complete spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; You see, but the great thing is this. We did not know who we were, but our father knew who we were. &gt;&gt; You understand that? I told the brothers yesterday, brother, we we we came out from from we were uncchristians. We didn't believe anything. I had two great stars in my life. There was Arnold Schwatzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Definitely. So, because we were and I like the films and I saw one time I saw Arnold Schwatzenegger in in in a film making his breast mus. So, I started bodybuilding. Okay. I tell the brothers everything that you see here was here. It's just a change of dispensation. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So, I want to tell the the brother don't invest too much in the body. &gt;&gt; Keep a balance. Okay. If if you if you say, "Well, the whole day I'm just reading the Bible and then then I fear you have a religious spirit." Okay? &gt;&gt; So, keep a keep a balance in all things. Okay? But if you invest in your body, it's fine. But don't forget your soul, man. to invest in your soul. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, what I find out when I wanted to have muscles, I'm if you want to have muscles, you cannot eat McDonald's. &gt;&gt; You need spiritual food in due season. Okay? You need a steak. And if you want to have spiritual muscle, you cannot eat Facebook. &gt;&gt; Don't don't think that you are spiritual because you are posting some nonsense that the denomination do. Jesus loves you, Jesus. And that's fine. That's social. But if you want to have muscles, you must eat &gt;&gt; eagle's food. &gt;&gt; The rest is just entertainment. &gt;&gt; You are not spiritual by sending little videos. That's not spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you must eat spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not even conventions will not fill that gap. You can go from convention to convention and it will never change you. But you must find the person of the word. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So please make the next one. So we understand. So we fell in life situations that we were not choosing. So when you came on this earth, nobody asked you. You wanted to you wanted to come directly into your theophony. Okay. But you landed in Toronto. Nobody asked you do you want to be male or female. &gt;&gt; Nobody asked you. &gt;&gt; Do you want to be rich or do you want to be poor? If God would have asked, we have all said I want to be son of Mr. uh how do you call it? Uh Rochild. &gt;&gt; A raw child. Okay. Nobody asked you how do you want to look? You came into a body that you don't like. &gt;&gt; That's very true. That's true. When when I wake up in the morning, okay, and I look in the mirror, I said, "I don't know you, but I wash you anyhow." Okay, brother. I mean, that part is funny, but some of us came into dysfunctional families, brother. &gt;&gt; Brother, I come from a broken home. I mean, when I was 14, 15 years, not to not to be emotional right now, but they told me that I have cancer, there was nothing in me that was that was afraid to die, but I was just afraid to live. I mean at that time if you don't have a father you were just an outcast in society. You see I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus Christ at the age of 20 21 and one of the first thing that God was showing to me that he was my father. &gt;&gt; Brother brother maybe our earthly parents made a lot of trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we have an heavenly father who is our true father. &gt;&gt; And we must understand that we don't own our own children. Our children are our brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you have a little child and you have a car accident on the other side, you have the same size of the &gt;&gt; theophony. &gt;&gt; Therefore, the daughter of brother Brandon said on earth I was your little Sharon Rose. &gt;&gt; So life can be life can become very hard and the way with the Lord is a lot is a way with a lot of tears and it makes you to understand. Amen. Because we were way too judgmental when we were young. Okay. Again, I speak about the group who wants to be right, not those who don't care. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Okay. Make that keep that balance. &gt;&gt; Here's here's brother Biscuit. And he tells that that that that wonderful that wonderful uh testimony. They were in Canada and it's on tape. Their brother Brandon cries out, "Young soldier, don't take your life. It's just the devil lying at you." And brother Biscuit said, "We were just driving in the car and we were waiting at a restaurant and here comes a a sergeant with a tall American soldier said, "Brother Brandham, you said young soldier, don't take your life." That is the young man. He different time wanted to take his life. And brother Bisc said, brother Brandham said, "Look, God is not in a hurry. We for first we will eat, then we will chase out those demons because God does not come too late." I will tell you as young people every decision that you do under pressure will be wrong. &gt;&gt; Every decision that you do under pressure is a wrong decision already. &gt;&gt; Okay. So what happens is that brother Biscuit said when they came out of the restaurant and there was a tall American soldier and little brother Brandon that they went into that area and they went alone and at some time brother Brandon just lifted up his head and they were just praying and the boy turned around he said I'm free I'm free I'm free and they were just shaking hands and brother Brandon asked brother Biscuit do you know the boy he said no he said then I will explain you he's a Christian. He has a family. He has children. But when he was in the army, he fell in homosexual acts. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he was so embarrassed. And when I lift up my hand, the Lord Jesus came down and revealed where the problem is. &gt;&gt; You see, here is a person who wants to be right, but he was trapped in life. &gt;&gt; And God has a way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Please understand that this Bible needs an upgrade. You cannot just say homosexuality is because Romans 1 says they they worship the creation instead of the creator when brother Brandham says today we live in a time where homosexuality comes from hybrid food that never existed in Paul's time. Therefore, the angel of the church age catches the mystery for his church age. Amen. So for the Bible is not enough to bring us into the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Please understand as we were seeing yesterday, the Bible is a book which is progressive. &gt;&gt; In the time of Paul, I'm a dead part of the Bible was not written. God later put it into it. You know, and things were revealed in this time which gives an upgrade for the time in that we live. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A brother said it's because of the hormones that is in the chicken. &gt;&gt; Amen. That you get homosexuality. Therefore, it matters to pray before you eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who who could say this? Who could preach this? But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery of God be revealed. Remember that that dream of Junior Jackson, brother Bren confirmed. He said, he said, "And that pyramid, and here's the white stone, light never shone upon it since the foundation of the world." In other words, Jesus never mentioned it. Paul never mentioned it. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery of God will be revealed. &gt;&gt; And it's nothing outside the Bible, but it's fulfilling the missing part that God left for the end time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so we're not propagating homosexuality here, but what I want to say, whatever comes your way, don't give up. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has the last answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Marcus, what is your doctrine? God will have a way &gt;&gt; where there seems to be no. &gt;&gt; Brother, how much? And I want to ask the older one among us. How much did we want to give up &gt;&gt; as ministers, as parents, as people? We just want to give up. But there was something in us that couldn't give up. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we help these youngsters who say, "Hey, there's things in your life that will that will come your path, but don't give up." &gt;&gt; Why? Because we have a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. My strength is not because I have a prophet. &gt;&gt; I have a father. &gt;&gt; We are not &gt;&gt; We are not here because of William Brandon. &gt;&gt; William Brandon became because of us. &gt;&gt; Behold, I will send you. &gt;&gt; God saw us. And then as he had to send William Brandham, &gt;&gt; we are not here because of William Brandham. &gt;&gt; We are here because of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The great person. Therefore, we are not Branamites &gt;&gt; and we are outside of all that cultish things that is in the myth for us. It's just teenage teenage. &gt;&gt; It's good people but childish understanding. Um the great person in this time is not William Brandham. is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Have have you ever thought about that man that how how how God does not forget here is the rich young ruler or not or the the prodigal son. I mean that was his mistake. He goes in the things of the world and and he lives in all kind of red light districts and the money is away and parties and whatever and then he has no money and then the Bible says and he came to himself. That is the miracle part. &gt;&gt; It was not him. It was God's bringing back his memory. &gt;&gt; Who he is. People say, "Brother Marcus, where are the signs and the miracle in the message?" Look, we are the signs. &gt;&gt; We are the miracles. &gt;&gt; That's what Isaiah says. Behold Israel, you are the miracle. You are the sign. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? How God transformed us. That's the greatest miracle that there is &gt;&gt; from egocentric persons standing in their own way to people who have a helping hand for a dying world. Only God can do this. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we understand and the second thing what was the sec the first revelation that the boy had? He came to himself. What did he say? I have a father. &gt;&gt; He never said I have a church. I have a brother Brandham. I have I have a father. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And my father is a great man. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this. Our father is a great man. &gt;&gt; Hey. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Revelation and love goes hand in hand. &gt;&gt; Revelation will never puff you up. Revelation gives a feeling. &gt;&gt; I told the brother I said when when life becomes thick and life becomes hard, okay? and you're just you're just seeing what power is. Okay, the children are disobedient. The church doesn't like you. The neighbors are difficult. And I said, brother Bra said, love is the greatest power that there is. You will win when you have love. &gt;&gt; Sooner or later, you must win because love is the greatest power. &gt;&gt; Love is greater than hatred. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please make the next one. I mean, here's brother Bren. I mean, sorry for this. Here's brother Brennan. Rebecca said when we were on our way to going to to from Jeffersonville to Tusome, our father went back into the house and got that picture of of the angel, okay, and brought it into the card. It seemed for him to be so important, okay? But what does he want to tell his children? What do we want to say our children? Brother, we are over 60. When the Lord carries, we just have 20 years to live. Then our time is up. Okay, maybe 10 years according to the Bible. 70 with power 80. Okay, our time, we are already on our departure tour. Hey, do you know one thing? When you were born and when I was born, the date of expire was already on our front. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram said on one hand side, a Christian never dies because of his sickness. Never. A Christian dies when God calls him. &gt;&gt; Okay? No matter what the doctor says. But on the other hand side, you can you can you can eat healthy. I'm you can live healthy. I'm only only biological food. Okay? No meat, no nothing. All is fine. You can eat healthy, but when your time is up, you die healthy. &gt;&gt; So, I encourage you to go to McDonald's. &gt;&gt; When your time is up, your time is up. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; So, hey, young man, young boy, Amen. If you want to do something for God, do it today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't know if you have tomorrow. If you want to serve the Lord, if you want to make things right with God, make it today. &gt;&gt; If you want to if you want to tell your parents how much you care, if you want to tell your children how much you love them, tell them today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you don't know if there is a tomorrow. &gt;&gt; So God shows to his children, look, maybe one day daddy will not be with you anymore, but never forget you have an angel. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, that is our own theophony. Quote brother Brandham. Brother Brandon, please explain the angels who are always beholding the face of the father. That's Mark 10 or Matthew 10. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Bra said, "These angels are the bodies in which you will go after you will die." &gt;&gt; In other words, your own theophony. &gt;&gt; God cannot forget you because part of you is beholding God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the heavenly parts, the spiritual parts. &gt;&gt; God cannot forget his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandon, please explain about each and every personal angel. And brother Brand said for two for two for two pages blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. And at the end, yeah, that is your own theophony. &gt;&gt; That is the answer to the question. Our only children of God have a theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody can preach you into it. You will not earn it. It's not because when you die, God will not see 5 minutes before your death. Okay. Was he always in church? Did he pay his tithings? Was he always nice to Marcus Becker? &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know, not we hope, we know when this earthly tabernacle &gt;&gt; will be dissolved. We have already waiting for us. We know we have less obedience. Does it make us now? Okay. Now I can drink. I can smoke. I can live because I have a theophony. No. Because you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will not allow these things. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you die, it will be like Elijah. It was not Elijah trying to find the chariot but it was the chariot finding Elijah &gt;&gt; when we die. Amen. Brother Blame said that is our own theophony will find us. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So nobody but brother sister. Amen. Our our our our hands as parents we can do our best. &gt;&gt; We can we can bring them up in the fear of the Lord. We can do and we did our best becoming friends to our children but we will find out it takes a supernatural element only God can call them. &gt;&gt; If your children don't serve the Lord don't be discouraged because salvation it pertains to God &gt;&gt; not to the parents. &gt;&gt; We do our best but God has to call him whenever it comes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Please make the next one. So we understand. Amen. here. Uh, and I want you to put on the spiritual jacket. Now, we have, and I know Sarin and Christina knows it already, but but just now we have two personalities. Okay? As we realize that the Canadians, they cannot play football. So, I will give you some some lessons. Okay? But you are good in hockey. That's what we honest. So, we peace. Peace. Now, you need the lamb's nature. Okay? But here is France Beckenbower and he was they call it the okay the emperor whatever and this is Bertie folks the two men both had the same success in football they were both world champions both became uh coaches very very successful okay but their n their mentality was completely different okay now France Beckenbau when he lost the battle he said look where is the problem okay Next match we will win. Okay. H. So so what to the to the journalist. Okay. Bertie folks he was always explaining himself. Yeah. Please uh understand you must know the defenders they were not right in their own tactic and here is the midfield players and but next match we will try to change this and we try and they try to find out where is the difference between both and they found the answer in their youth. France Beckenbau comes from a prominent family. The father was a great man. The uncle was already player in Bayern Munich. I mean Bertie Folks never had a father nor a m mother. I mean he was raised up in a in as a step with a stepfather. And they found out that the relationship of the children to the parents, the the care, the warmness builds up a personality in which that person will live for the rest of its life. Okay. Amen. The Jesuits say, "Give me a child for three years. I will form it for the rest of its life." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. is exactly so and that's that's truth. Okay, brother. I'm I'm taking care of the young people in the church. I took already care when Christina and Saron were in Sunday school. So, I can see how trades go to families. I see it because the children have the same problems like the parents had when they were young. It's incredible. You see what happens is this. These things are you see for example sicknesses. If somebody you go to the doctor and he says doctor I have heart blood pressure or I have uh uh problems with my with my with my let me say I have cancer problem or I have u for example stroke problem you know what the doctor says did somebody in your family had already that problem because a doctor knows sicknesses go through families and the natural types the spiritual so they found out that when a a a family is unhealthy, no care, okay, that the children of that family will never build up a true relationship. I mean, I thought by myself, if this works for human relationship of fathers of daughters, how much is it important that we have a relationship to our father in heaven? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, I was asked by a person who is working. He's a colleague. She's not a believer. She said, "Brother Marcus, what how can Christianity help in the integration of people?" I said, "Look, it it it depends on the picture of the father that this religion draws. If you present God always as a father who is never satisfied, whatever you do, it's always wrong and you did your best and he's never happy with you anyhow. He is happy when you miss the rapture. If you play that picture, then that religion becomes toxic for your own life. But if you play a picture, paint a picture of a father who cares, who does everything to encourage you, who is happy when you make it, &gt;&gt; then you can sing the song, what a friend we have in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It depends on the picture that we have of the heavenly father. And I don't talk about people who don't care. I speak about people who need a father. who need a help &gt;&gt; who see I I who say I need somebody who takes me out of that miry clay &gt;&gt; and not only for my salvation but for my for my whole life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, we were we were young in the message and we were full of zeal and we were full of fire and we were full of naivity. We said here we were the eagle tie. &gt;&gt; Okay. The eagle belt. &gt;&gt; Nothing against that but the eagle must be here. Come on. &gt;&gt; Okay. Hey. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. And here we were. And we really saw this. Whole Germany comes to the message by Marcus Becker. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Brother. And then God says, "Marcus, you're a fine boy, but we have to mold the character a little bit." Okay? And then you get and then and in all these years we become and today we pray different. We say, "Lord, keep me on the way." &gt;&gt; Keep keep my heart loyal to you, Father. &gt;&gt; We see people even in the message, they go this side and this. Lord, keep me humble. &gt;&gt; Keep keep my heart pure before you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you older people, do you know what? Do you know one thing? Time means nothing for God. &gt;&gt; Time means nothing for God. God remembered Abraham even three generations later. &gt;&gt; In other words, the prayers that you were praying as a young person, God remembers them. &gt;&gt; God did not forget. We forgot our own prayers. &gt;&gt; But God did not forget what we say. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So we see we call it in in the world we call it bonding. The bonding between the parents and the children is so important to give that young girl or young boy a personality a b if not he will be always insecure &gt;&gt; all his life. Amen. So you understand and here we have in the middle and you can think whatever you want but that is Joyce Meyer. Joyce Meer is a preacher in the denominations uh prosperity gospel. We had sometimes some fans of her. So I looked her up and that's not a great thing. We know what God says about the woman preacher. But she has a tremendous testimony. Joyce Meer, she was she was she was uh abused by her own father over and over and over and over in her life and she throwed her whole all whole life away. Okay? Lived on the street, you know, had no value in life anymore until she said that the Lord Jesus found her and she became a preacher in a denomination. I thought by myself, if the Lord Jesus can do this for a denomination, &gt;&gt; what can he do in the message of the hour? Hey, and she said it was the Lord Jesus. And then she said a sentence that I never forgot. And it helps you to understand people who leave the message and who leave the church. Never throw something behind them. I'm keep a a loving heart to them. Amen. Because he said people who got hurt do silly things. People who got hurt do silly things. Amen. That's the time when we when we leave the message, brother. Therefore, you under we leave the church. Therefore, we are not a sect. You know how a sect functions in a sect. Oh brother, we come here together in this church and before the foundation of the world, you know, we were already in him and then we were this and then yeah, I feel it when I saw you the first time. Ah, that was such a that was such a we were long enough in the world that I fell in love at least 10 times in my life and everything was before I I I think I knew you since many many years. So that person leaves the church he doesn't go because he leaves the doctrine but with hurt maybe in his feelings. Okay. So a person leaves the church. So you know what people say? Yeah, you must understand they left us because they were never part of us just to justify themsself. Okay, so that person after some years repents. Okay, finds out it was wrong. Comes back to the church. You know what the church says? Oh, before the foundation of the world, we were always eagle brother. If somebody is part of the family of God, he will stay part of the family of God. &gt;&gt; If everything went wrong, then you need a father. &gt;&gt; Then you need a friend. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The great man Arur Rubenstein was asked the question, Mr. Rubenstein, is it difficult to play piano? He said, no, it's very simple. You just have to press down the right buttons at the right time. And to be led by the Holy Spirit to correct that person is very simple. You must be the right person at the right time in the right place saying the right things in the right spirit. And the other one must be the right in the right spirit to receive the right thing what you said in the right spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother, if a person goes to difficulty sometime no word is the best word. &gt;&gt; Instead of trying now to put our feet in things that we don't understand. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you must understand if God can do these great things, &gt;&gt; what can you do in the message? This message is healing power &gt;&gt; for our body, for our spirit, for our souls. &gt;&gt; And we talk about people who were hurt in their feelings. We say, "Okay, don't be so emotional. You're too uh uh you you are too, how do you say it? You are too sensible. You're too sensitive." That's not the question. I need a help, man. &gt;&gt; Amen. I need someone who helps me. Okay. So here this please understand and we talk about the people who don't want. So we will uh who who who cannot this know also that in these last days perious time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves. Covetous boasters brought blasphemous disobedient to their parents unthankful unholy without natural affections. Brother, when I was young, I thought these people are monsters. But you must understand the people in the world today are victims because we live in a sick society. &gt;&gt; And a sick society produces sicker children. &gt;&gt; Amen. A a a father comes to me and says, "Brother Marcus, uh the reason that my daughter is is this and this because of the cell phone." He said, "It's not the cell phone. It's because you should invest time in her. have a relationship of a friendship together then she can have 10 cell phones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One is this is just a symptom &gt;&gt; of a situation. Amen. So you must understand that every generation gets wiser. &gt;&gt; You say it's not so you give your cell phone to your children. They are 10 times faster than you. Give it to the little baby. They get a cell. You understand that? I mean they they become smarter but weaker all the time. &gt;&gt; We live we live in a sick society. Don't be blended by Hollywood that people that people make a good appearance. They are sick in their mind. And the and the remedy against the sick society is healthy families. &gt;&gt; These youngsters in the street, they need a father man. They need a mother. They need someone who who who who stands in the gap for them who says look whatever comes whatever goes I love you. &gt;&gt; The the the young people many times they are a little bit ashamed of the parents and and what happens is you know uh when they are little little ones they are proud of the parents but when they come to school okay you start to bring them to school and they're very proud that daddy brings them to school but at a certain time they become a little bit more cool. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So they said 100 yards before the school um &gt;&gt; you can stop here. &gt;&gt; The older they get the distance become bigger &gt;&gt; because it's not cool you know and then you want to get and then &gt;&gt; I remember my own daughter you see she was in kindergarten and the all the children they were stand sitting on there. Okay. And I came to pick her up and I was at the fence and she saw me and before all the children she stood up and she said, "Hello, daddy." And I thought by myself, my daughter was not ashamed of me. I will never be ashamed of her. &gt;&gt; Never ever. I told my daughter, I said, "Look, I want to tell you one thing. You know, we believe the message of the hour." Okay? I cannot force you to become a believer. &gt;&gt; Okay? That's God calling in his time. Okay? I will not. You have the right for your own life. Okay, if you become a Muslim, okay, that is up to you. I respect this. I will not agreeing with your life, but I respect this. &gt;&gt; But I want to make you sure and let you know that God put us together as a family. And daddy will always be your friend. Whatever comes in life, if you're in prison, if you're not in prison, whatever, we are always friends in life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to this? Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that our heavenly father, he's not always optioning if we are chosen or not chosen? He finds a way. He's not always agreeing with our ways, but that he calls us back on the way. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, please understand that we live in a sick society. These people don't need a message book. They need reality. &gt;&gt; They don't need a doctrine. They don't need a picture of Brother Brandham at the war. We can have we can we can plaster our wall with brother Brandon but it takes more than this. &gt;&gt; Peter said I can only give what you what I have. &gt;&gt; How can you give love to your children if you don't have that love? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe here's a group that has the love. But you understand we have to transmit a vision a love that the children say look I don't know the doctrine of papa mama but I want I want to say my father is a great man you say what happened with those children they don't serve the lord and they die yeah we see them at the white throat judgment we see them if god was allowed &gt;&gt; that his his dog and his horse was there &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; amen My mother, she was never interested in in in religion. Was never, she was not against it. She was not, she was just not interested. What can I do? Okay. But my mother is my mother. What I am is because of her. &gt;&gt; If God allows and I would be in the white throne judgment, I will have my veto. &gt;&gt; I said, I know that she never went to church, but that was my mother on earth. She did everything for me. Now I want to give everything for her. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that sometimes you are the only one in the family serving the Lord? Everybody is is is is in the world. You are not helping the people by giving up. &gt;&gt; You go your way. &gt;&gt; And you are sure we will meet them again &gt;&gt; at the white throne judgment. &gt;&gt; And then you will become like Esther. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Blessed be them. Please make the next one. So we understand. Amen. Here's Mike Tyson. Mike Tyson said, "Amen. I put on all these muscles to to protect my soul. Okay. Now, Mike Tyson, he in that interview, he said, "When I'm boxing, I'm trying to put the nose of my opponent in his brain." We would say, "What a what a monster." But he revealed in that same interview, I was reading it when I was an unbeliever, that he was a how do you call it? I think it's sensitive. If if if a person is very easily hurt in his field, is that sensitive? It's not sens sensitive. He said in that interview, I was a sensitive boy and I loved and I loved I loved animals. Okay. But I lived in New York and Catsville and so these boys came and killed all my animals. So he said, "So I built up all these muscles so I could beat down everyone who's who's hurting my feelings." And the interview the journalist says, "Mr. Tyson, will you ever overcome the frustration of your use? He said, I will never do that. I can never do that. And you must understand that Mike Tyson became a Christian. He became a Baptist and he became a Muslim. But that's what I want to tell the people. You can change your religion three times a month, but it will not change the person. &gt;&gt; You can change the doctrine in the message three times a month. But what we need is healing on the inside. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it comes by the presence of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; I can only make my children happy if I'm happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If not, if I have grudges in my heart, in my soul, I will only transmit grudges. It's so important for me as a minister. You know there is a German German prime minister uh Katchman and he is a teacher and he was asked a question what is the qualification for a good teacher? He said this the first thing is you must love children. &gt;&gt; Hey &gt;&gt; hey must love children &gt;&gt; and as if you want to be a good minister you must love people. They must feel that you want to help them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You must love the word. You must love God. But you must love the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can feel if a minister have his his his if if if he is hurt in his feeling, but because it's transmitted little complexes, little things. Therefore, the Bible says that that our leaders that we that they should do the things in great thankfulness. Amen. I have an older pastor, 84. I mean, sure. I mean, if you're 84, you're not preaching like 60. You forget things and you repeat things and you find don't find your text and and it's normal. Where's a one day we will be that the same way. Okay. But he has very still a very good inspiration. So, what I'm doing if there is a sermon, I always send a little text message. Hey, pastor, good job. Thank you very much. And I just always picked up some some sentence that was that was outstanding so that he realizes just to feed a little bit the emotional moto of a man. &gt;&gt; And brother, you do these things and God remembers and will bless you for that &gt;&gt; because we're family. &gt;&gt; We are there to encourage one another. Okay. Behind these muscles, brother, when we were young in all our our complexes, everything that we did was put up Every boy, every boy who wants to be cool. Hi chicks. How are you doing? Never forget there's a weak part in his soul. And that's what the lead job Jesus wants to wants to fill and wants to deal with. Can you say amen? Please make the next one. I'm hurrying through now. Here is here is here is Marilyn Monroe. How can God be interested in a person who doesn't come into a message church? Because you must understand life is precious in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; For God God told to brother Brandham, you call these Rickys and Ricettas and they are not sawdust. You shouldn't do that. Many of my children are still among them. You're never wrong. You see, for example, a vagabond on the street. Okay, for us it's just a bump. is just a vagabond. But the same man is the daughter of a mama &gt;&gt; is the son of a mama. For mama that's his son. And maybe the same man is the father of a little girl and for that little girl it's her father. &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in respecting people. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here he is. She is one of the beauties girl the left one in blonde. Okay. So what happens is that brother Brandham says uh the angel of the Lord tells brother Brandham the minute when she dies when God knew the minute of the death of Mary Monroe. God knows the minute of our death. &gt;&gt; Okay. So and he knows that we go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he can call us bright. Therefore, brother Blame said, "I saw you on the other side quickening power. Let me see behind the curtain of time and I saw you there. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must have seen my theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says now a young blonde woman and that is what I want to preach this morning. A God who understands life &gt;&gt; that not a doctrinal not a judgmental a God of the word but who understands circumstances. why people are in that conditions that they are in. &gt;&gt; So when you talk with God, he knows exactly where you come from. &gt;&gt; Okay. A young blonde woman, Marin Monrose, she she died. It was not a suicide. I felt sorry for the lady. She was a she was a very sad type of a woman. Always she needed something. I wished I would have could have talked to the girl. She needed Christ. She went maybe into a cold formal church, but she needed a true case of salvation. Something in her heart that gives her security. She has never seen her father. Her mother was in the insane institution. All that was on the mind of that girl. Blessed be the name of the Lord that we have a message who understands people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, I tell you one thing in the white throne judgment, God is love and God is just. &gt;&gt; God will understand people who could not come out of their seat. &gt;&gt; I mean, God understands life. I mean, it was not okay. All these atomic. No, no, no. Okay. Now, you understand she was the the woman with the perfect body, the nicest girl. Now if she was if she was unhappy and said though she was the nicest woman, you sisters don't invest too much in lipsticks and jewelries and and all these if if if that didn't make her nice, it will make it will not make us nice and happy. We need a case of salvation. That woman, her man, how old is she? When we are at the youth camp, we will ask. I tell you right there, she's 16 years old. 16 years old and she's made up like this. Brother Brandham explains life. He says, "Every woman wants to be beautiful." Okay? There's nothing wrong. There's a difference between beautiful and sexy. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not more spiritual because you dress like a scarecrow. That's what we thought in the beginning. No, no. Make yourself pretty. If you're if you if if you're a handsome boy, you're a handsome boy. Okay. You can Okay. Amen. But there's a difference between between between being pretty and being sexy. Every boy said brother Bren wants to be successful that lays in him. It's nothing wrong but put it in the right kind of channel. Okay. So what happens is here that she was 16 at that age and she got compliments from the film industry and you must understand that every human being needs some good words. &gt;&gt; Please understand that &gt;&gt; as much as we have the Holy Spirit we are still human beings. If you miss this, you are miss life reality. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. It fills up a certain tank of where of of of being respected of being uh of of of of a self-esteem. Every woman wants to be pretty. Every man wants to wants to be successful. Now, I want to say this, us as fathers, hey, we have our youngsters, our girls, they do their best. They have long hair and they have long dress. Who tells them that they are pretty? They need it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We should go to our girls. He said, "Hey, honey, I want to tell you one thing. You're looking good, man. You're looking good." Amen. We shouldn't take those things for granted because they need it. And if they don't get it from the right person, they search it at the wrong person. Therefore, we shall tell our our our I mean I I I tell you one thing this happens only in Germany. Can you say amen so far &gt;&gt; that that that I'm you say that's the human part but it's so important to keep a balance. &gt;&gt; I here's our wives and I mean I mean they do everything to wash the clothes to to to to to cook every every day. Okay. Now here's brother Marcus. Okay. He never says a word. We take these things for granted. Okay. So Marcus and Martina, my wife, we're now invited at another family. Okay, here's Marcus and he's eating. And Marcus, it's me. We're eating. And I tell that sister, sister. The sauce. What What do you What do you put in the sauce? And And tremendous. Tremendous. And the And and and and the potatoes. I never ate potatoes like this. and my and my wife brother we must be wise &gt;&gt; by wise &gt;&gt; brother brother brother brother sometime even as a church you must be wise I don't talk to children I talk to really adult people understand we will reign one day and we must understand dynamics okay I mean I mean as as a minister I mean you do your best you do your best I'm a visiting min minister a visiting minister is always the man of the hour or of the minute. Yeah. I mean because people like that but if you listen to me every week okay but but sometime in the church and I think sometime that's so unwise. Okay. So so you do your best. Okay. And people come and say thank you or they do do not say anything. But here comes a guest minister. He says the same thing. The same. Now, we have a little custom in Germany that we at the at the door and we shake the hands of the people. Okay? And I as a translator, I stand beside the guest minister and here come people, brother, that was so tremendous. We never heard it that way. Please come back soon. And and here you are thinking, thank you. It's it's it's just a question of not realization. The other one has feelings. Every human being needs some nice words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And how much more God has nice words for the B for for his bride. &gt;&gt; Do we understand those things? We as fathers, we must tell our children how much we care for them. You see, you have a boy and your own father. Brother, we come from a generation where we did not show emotions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our fathers never hugged us. &gt;&gt; Never hugged us. &gt;&gt; I hope I can say that way. I'm missing some words. You my father was showing so few emotion that I wonder myself how I came into existence. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It must have been a spoken word. &gt;&gt; Okay. But I mean, but that was that was that was the generation of World War II. &gt;&gt; Everything was a boy must be strong and a boy must be this and a and But what these boys need is a father taking them into hey buddy I love you &gt;&gt; buddy I love you okay and we're friends okay and I want to tell you one thing I remember myself I mean what what how can I help I mean I was I was a small boy and my father said when I was in your age I had muscles I had this I had that after some years I was taller than him and more muscles like him you see but then it was yes but you didn't make that kind of university whatever I did was wrong. &gt;&gt; Whatever I did was wrong &gt;&gt; until I found out with my heavenly father, whatever I do is right. &gt;&gt; Hey, say brother Marcus, what is your doctrine? I have a father. He calls me his own. Long before even time began, my life was in his hand. Brother, if we don't show love, &gt;&gt; Amen. to the children, who wants to show love? If we receive the capstone, it's more like a doctrine. It's a substance. &gt;&gt; If we can show empathy to a dying world, a respect, a feeling, a warmth, who wants to give it? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Make make the next one, please. Amen. It fits into it. Beautiful. Beautiful. Amen. The dying world needs a father. a friend in life, somebody who stands with you, somebody let me say if you if that that doesn't pick up his or take his generation but the the gen of the religion but the religion gets a hold of him. I mean that man is not grandfather, it's a father but he has cancer. He will die soon. He's an unbelieving man. Okay. and and they made a big story. I think it comes from Holland. That's his daughter. Nothing immoral. It's his daughter. But look what it is. He found out I have to live just a couple of weeks. Pancreas cancer. It goes very very fast. So he understands my daughter will never be able that her father brings her to the altar when she will marry. So what they did, they said they were playing marriage with all the guests up to the point where the father leaves her at the altar and they stopped there and when she when she will marry one day she will continue exactly at that point so that she can say my father brought me to the altar. &gt;&gt; I thought by myself if an unbeliever have that understanding of a father what about a message believer? Brother, sister, we must understand our children need us. &gt;&gt; They need us as friends as as as partners in life. So, so to take all our life experience to help them on their way. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We cannot run away from this because a family is a team. &gt;&gt; Even a church is a team. &gt;&gt; They come together. They stand together. Brother, a church is a place where so much warmness that even the sinner feels welcomed. &gt;&gt; Not the sin, but the person who fell that he comes back. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Have you ever seen that thing? Can you say amen so far? I'm just &gt;&gt; just some practical things. Okay. Amen. Have you ever heard that voice when when some when something when something really went bad in your life? Really bad. And it can be just feelings. I mean, you're sick. Okay. Then you hear a voice inside. Don't go to church today. You're not a blessing like this. And and you you better stay home. And then uh with that kind of cough. Oh, no. No. You you would start a pandemia in the church. Don't be. Have you ever heard Have you ever ever had heard that that voice that thought? Can you say amen so far? &gt;&gt; In other words, that voice speaks English and German because I hear that voice in German. You hear it in English. Amen. And if you come from Africa, you hear it in okay, whatever. But I tell you one thing, when everything goes wrong, don't stay home. &gt;&gt; Because you don't become more religious or more spiritual by staying home. That is the point where you come into the house of your father. &gt;&gt; He says, "Heavenly Father, I have sinned against you. Everything went wrong, but here I am. I need you." &gt;&gt; That is the moment where you should not stay at home. When your feelings are hurt, when everything is wrong, then you come in the presence of your father and says, "Heavenly Father, I just need you. I cannot make it with you." Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen so far? &gt;&gt; So next time when Satan comes to you and says, "You better stay home." You say to Satan, "No, you stay home." &gt;&gt; Amen. You stay home. Okay? I want to come in the presence of my father because because I need help. Everything went wrong. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And the church needs that. Again, we live in a sick society. And even when I'm traveling, I see sick message. Churches, &gt;&gt; the doctrine is good, but it takes more than a good doctrine. It takes a life. It takes a warmness. It takes an understanding. It takes a empathy. It takes a real mutual respect that everybody feels that's my house. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Therefore, these these doctrines are are so destructive. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. Therefore, Amen. Amen. People who come out of legalism, please understand, they have their scars. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because because legalism is then to just discipline unbelievers. But I don't need legalism. I need a father. &gt;&gt; Please make the next one. I'm going through. Amen. Make the next one. Amen. Amen. Amen. Here we go. Okay. Amen. This is a little video. Okay. And it just shows we have no we have no sound. We have video. It's only two minutes. It's not bad things. It's not believers. But I want to tell you again, please don't understand. If God understands a dying world, okay? Amen. the heart of God. The Bible says God so much loved the world. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said God wants that everybody could be saved. &gt;&gt; That's his heart. That's his feeling. And if we are sons of a father, we have a feeling for a dying world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is a man by the name of of of um Jonah. And Jonah was happy for the judgment because he was an Israelite. He had no feeling for for for for some Gentiles. So he brought his message, set himself upon upon upon the rock and he said, "Okay, let the fire fall &gt;&gt; with him." And then God speaks to him said, "Jonah, here's a city of 100,000 people. They don't know left from right." In other words, they don't have a message. Amen. I mean, and you just ask for the fire and you're not happy about the forgiveness of God. I mean, you understand God has a feeling even for a dying world. &gt;&gt; How much more he has a feeling for people who fall back or who who who people who cannot follow anymore. God is not wiping them off. God always has a helping hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's his nature. Amen. He is a father. If we can good give good things to our children, how much more our heavenly father can give to us. And if you help us in this, [Music] I close my eyes and in the dark I try to see his face from memories in my heart. It's been some time, some months or more, since my father went to fight the foreign war. And I know he'll be home sooner than we thought. And I know he'll hold me tighter than before. Oh, but I'm not sad. You know I'm proud. You'll be home soon to hold me tight and hold my hands turn into years. still be waiting for my father to return. And I know he'll be home sooner than before. And I know we have to fight the forest. And I know you hold me tighter than [Music] And I know you hold me tighter [Music] than before. [Music] [Music] I know you'll be home sooner than we do. And I know he has to fight for it. [Music] And I know he'll hold me tighter than before. And I know he'll hold me tighter than his back. He'll hold me tighter than before. [Music] buddy. &gt;&gt; I missed you. &gt;&gt; I missed you too. &gt;&gt; I missed you. Amen. Brother, never forget people have souls. Amen. Brother Brandon taught us a lesson. He said, "Life is precious in the eyes of God." Amen. How much more of his right. Amen. Nobody replaces the father in the family. Nobody replaces the mother. Amen. Our kids they need us and they need that they need that warmness. Sometime we have to correct them. That's true. But they need more than just correction. They need a a hug. They need a real I stand with you. That's the way how they feel. Amen. Please make the last one. Amen. Can you say amen so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says if you can give good things to your children, how much the heavenly father? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. and gives unto us a man. Here's brother Brandham. Brother Brandham, a man full of the Holy Ghost two times want to take his life with the Holy Ghost. The seals are open and he just wants to give up. Amen. So God calls him and Brother Brham preaches about it in the message standing in the gap. Brother Brham said I built up a complex against the people. There is two ways to destroy a minister. Too much applause is not helping and too much criticism is not helping him. Amen. Keep a balance in all these things. So what happens is that brother Brandon built up that complex and God led him and he was he he stopped the car and God says to brother Brandon, you have lost the feeling for my people. Brother, it could be that we can lose the feeling for ourselves. Can be that we lose the feeling for our brothers, can lose the that we lose the feeling for our own children because they are so much frustrating us. Then it takes a dose of divine love. It's not the question who is right. It's not a question because God is right all the time. is a question who wins that situation because he has substance of taking that situation under his control. Legalism will never make it. &gt;&gt; God is not breaking the prophet but God is molding him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not breaking us but he molds us to understands. Amen. To help people who cannot help themsel. &gt;&gt; So here he is. Amen. So so so whatever. Now, brother Brandham was a man of complexes. Quote, Brother Brandham, until the message on the wings of a snow white dove, he said, "All my life I was a neurotic." Quote, Brother Brandham, how can a man with the Holy Ghost be a neurotic? Because one is the Holy Ghost, the other one is the human part. When we receive the Holy Ghost, we still have our human minds, the white dog and the black dog. And he says, "All my life I was a melancholic." Okay? Many musicians are melancholic type of persons. Okay? It's not a sin, but it's just our our upbringing. Okay? So, what happens is that when you look to the left, I mean, God says, "This is your life." I asked you the question. He said, "Your name is written all about it. It speaks of three pulls. This is your life." In the message, stand in the gap. Now, my question to you is when did these mountains come out of the earth? 1963 when God created the earth, he knew the seventh angel is a neurotic type of a person, is a melancholic type of a person. So he prepared these things and he calls it an eternal and everlasting sign for you. And God remembered that he he had problems in his psyche in his mind in his he said if you ever come back into that conditions come back here and remember come back brother when we when when when we when when we make a when we make a a victory in our life. Amen. We should feast our victories. But too often we are feasting our our defeats. &gt;&gt; You see, so what happens is is this is your life. And I tell you one thing, this is our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is not nervous because he understands life. Because he's the alpha and the omega. and he called and he knew all the time when we would backslid. He's not nervous. He said that was included in the price everything when we when you remember and and and the young people know that I said it many times to understand our father. Brother, sister, we are the only people on the earth who doesn't have a religion. We have a father. &gt;&gt; Don't make that message a religion. We have a person that loves us. My father is my redeemer. &gt;&gt; And when everything went wrong, I can speak to him. Heavenly Father, you know, I didn't want to do it, but I was overthrown in that situation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here, quote, brother Brandham. Now, this is a little story here is and I'm hurrying through knowing that I used too much time, but give give me just just to say uh to say goodbye. But here here comes that boy and he want to buy these dogs. And the owner of the dogs, he comes down the staircase and the boy says, "I want to have that dog." And the owner of the dog says, "Uh, look, why do you want to have that dog? He's handicapped. He doesn't have the value like the rest. He cannot run like like the rest. He has no value." And the boy put off his trousers and from his knee down, he had an artificial leg. &gt;&gt; And the boy said, "I want to get this dog because when we go out, he understands me and I understand him. [Applause] quote brother Brandham, God became man to understand man. &gt;&gt; Quote brother Brandham, God became teenager to understand the teenagers. &gt;&gt; That's what he says that when you pray, God knows what you talk about. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A person says, "Brother Marcus, my life is a dead end." No, no, no. I'm God. He is the way. where it seems there is no he Jesus is the way. If you have Jesus you have a way. &gt;&gt; I don't know when. I don't know how but he is the way. Never give up. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's our life. Everything is included. The good days and the bad days. In the good days. Praise his name. Are there bad days in the message? In the bad days do the same. &gt;&gt; Say amen. I mean so so so that is our life with so if you are on the mountaintop don't become arrogant &gt;&gt; yeah that family with their children only believe only believe yeah if man god says you don't understand them then no problem we will I will make you to understand if you are on the mountaintop don't become arrogant because the next valley is waiting for us. But brother, if we are in the valley, don't give up, man. Don't give up, sister. Don't give up, brother. Because the next mountain is waiting for you, brother. And that is the story because our God is not the God of the mountains. He's the God of the mountains and of the valleys. &gt;&gt; He says, "I will be with you in the good times, but when everything went wrong, I'm your father." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I stand with you when everybody forsakes you and you forsake yourself. I will never forsake you because I'm your father. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Here's the young man. Amen. And that is that is our motivation, brother. The time is over. We're not in kindergarten anymore of these ah you are so blessed in the service and blah blah blah. Hey, we are men. We became men and women. We know what's what's what what what what we talk about. He's the boy and therefore we are so much in in in in tune with God all of us. The boy was a good musician and he just played and and and and and and and uh the concert was over and the old people, the audience, they were so enthused and everybody was was shouting and clapping and applauding and the boy just looked up because over there was his teacher &gt;&gt; and he wanted to see if the teacher was happy &gt;&gt; of his performance. And definitely we like when people give us little compliments, but that's not our it's not our fuel for our motor. We want to have the grace of God. We want our father to say, "Look, I'm proud of you, boy. I'm proud how you manage the family. I'm proud about your prayer life. I'm proud of how you deal with situation. I gave you difficult people around you, but I see how you take everything under your control by the grace and the honor of God." &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; This is really this this a bright &gt;&gt; famine. But you can only grow if you have that bonding &gt;&gt; brother. We were we were we were under false teaching. We were 20 years in the message and didn't know if we were born again or not. &gt;&gt; Hey, every altar call we were there because we said I need the Holy Ghost until we found the right teaching to understand we have a new birth. But now God is giving giving giving building up. He's now giving maturity. It goes from step to step. It goes from it's a ladder that we're going up and we will have our human problems. &gt;&gt; But the more we grow in Christ, the more the human parts goes away. &gt;&gt; But it's not one convention. It's a pro. It's a process. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And the music come, the musicians would come and and do you love the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Was this is a good good youth meeting? If we were used, we might make an altar call right now, but we don't make it here. Okay? Because we are all believers right now. But brother, never forget this message brought us a father. &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery of God will be revealed. Amen. It's a true story and it helps us brother as minister. If if the musicians would come and you can play softly as a minister, as a father, as a brother in the church, you have to you have you have to take situations under your control. &gt;&gt; And God is just bringing situations just to understand to make us to understand how mature we are now. Amen. And maybe a little song like I have a father. If you play softly, is that fine? You know have that song? Okay. Amen. Have you ever thought in just two thoughts and I'm finishing I put everything away. Do you love the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that makes us together. Brother Brham said this. He speaks about he he speaks about Job and legalistically Job was was a tremendous man. Okay. But God just wanted to prove him. Brother Blam said God didn't want to chastise Job. But God wanted to prove what laid in Job. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and I mean if we are psychologically strong healthy people we can try to manage things but I talk today to many many people they have their weak parts in their life. They they said if God doesn't change it I cannot change it by my own mental capacity. And when everything was lost, God just comes on the throne. First God comes through a man. Four men come to Job. The first is a nice Lutheran. He said Job only believe. Only believe only. That's nice, brother. We don't need if if everything comes difficult in our life, I don't need Bible slogans. Honestly, I don't need quotes of brother Brandham. I need reality. Okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need just a No, no, no. Okay. The second was a nice uh Methodist. Job, you need uh that the shivering over your back. We all like that shivering, but it's not the answer to our questions. The third one, Job, you need some gifts. We I have a gift, but a gift will never replace the giver. &gt;&gt; But the fourth one was God himself. He said Job look man you have only some years on this earth like a 70 80 years and life can become very difficult but remember one thing you will become young again that's what Elihoo Elh who brother said that was God El Shai El Elohim Elihoo God says look this life is not everything boy okay okay so you will become young again because you have somebody who paid a price for you. And Job said, I know that my redeemer lives. And then God speaks from heaven at the same time. He said, Job, I want to ask you a question. Where were you? And the sons of God was shouting for joy. Brother God, God can give you a life where you are happy, healthy, and wealthy. And God can give you a life in a wheelchair. That's up to him. It's the same God. It's your life. Amen. Your life will be your own trophy. Maybe you brought nobody to the message to the Lord, but you brought yourself. And he said, "Lord, I am that trophy. Through all life, I held a hold." Amen. And God says, "You are that trophy. You are the proof that this message is not a doctrine. is a reality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are the proof for that. &gt;&gt; Character is not is not a nice gift. Character is is a vision. And to bring it into practice, um as for me and my house, there's no question. It's not as for me and my house, we have to because I want to be saved. I want No, no, no. We are so much in love with Jehovah God. As for me and my house, we want to serve the Lord. For us, the message is not obligation. It is a love letter from my father. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And really finishing with with with with the last thought. It's a true story, brother. It it and sister and it helped me a lot because God bring a lot of conflicts among brothers, among families just to see where we are standing. It's in my life, it's in your life. Definitely. You see there were one day in Germany there were there were two very famous uh composers and musicians Johan Strauss and Yuan Strauss father they make all these walts you know what they call the waltz king very very famous in 1980s something like this both became very very famous very phenomenal but one day the father was envious of the because he was more popular than the father. A lot of operas come from from that area. Strauss Johan Strauss and Yuan Strauss father. You don't say Yuan's son because he was more popular than the father. So they separated. One time in Vienna they made a concert but separated. And the father hope I'm not crying but okay. And the father was playing on one side and the boy was playing on the other side and and as the son was much more popular than the father all the people came to the son and the boy watched his father you know and then the boy used such a wisdom that I said man that must that boy must have had the holy ghost if not you cannot do that thing he saw that nobody was now watching to the father he made a little pause he said I will now play a piece from a person that I respect a lot. That's my own father. And he played that piece from his father. And when the father heard that the boy was playing his piece, the father came to his son. Amen. And he waited up and he he he gave his son a hug of saying, "Hey boy, you're my boy." Amen. And I thought by myself, what a wisdom to deescalate that situation between the father. That's what the mind of Christ is given for that nothing ever will will separate us from the love of God. &gt;&gt; This message is more than a doctrine because the mind of God came down to take every situation under the control of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a time that we live in. And I thank the pastor for giving me that time. Um, we have a wonderful father. Amen. A wonderful Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have the song I have a father. Would you sing it with me? I have a father. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] No matter where I [Music] Heat. Heat.

God finds them one day. Amen. Amen. Because God was not ashamed when we were in the world. We were still part of God. Amen. A great shalom. Thank you for the liberty.
