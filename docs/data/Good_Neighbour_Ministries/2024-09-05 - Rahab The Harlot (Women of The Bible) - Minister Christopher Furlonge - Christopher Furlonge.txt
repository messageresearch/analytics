even Jericho and they went and came into the harlot's house name Rahab and Lodge there and it was told the king of Jericho saying behold there came men in hither tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country and the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they become to search out all the country and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but I was not where they were amen so she lied she hid them and she lie amen but and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whether the men went I would not pursue after them quickly for he shall overtake them so she's telling them to go pursue these men so she sent them and I might say a wild goose cheese amen trick them right but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with a star of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof amen and the men pursued after them the way to Jordan onto the fourth and as soon as they which pursued them were gone out they shut the gate and before they were lay down she came up unto them upon the roof and she said unto the man I know that the Lord imagine that she knew that the Lord man had given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you praise God you all may be seated tonight Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah thank you Lord so we taken for our little bible study tonight reab the Harlot you want to know what is you know a story like that going to speak to you tonight amen but listen closely there is something here there's in every character every word in the Bible there's a lesson for you and I you amen every word there's a lesson for you and I tonight see let us picture here this evening for a few minutes now as a young lady she was bad to begin with amen with a and rotten to the core as we may call say it now right amen a beautiful young woman who's by some misfortune in life had been forced into being and following the life that she was living she was a pagan to begin with a Canaanite amen and was forced into the lifestyle she was in amen and many of times people of no fault of their own fall into a life amen that is not pleasing to the Lord amen hallelujah she was a hidden to start with amen and she was a prostitute on the street but she heard that there was a God not an idol on the wall or a declaration of some church Creed or something like that or some kind of imagination and a lot of people serving gods of imagination amen you imagine a god with 10 hands with a horse head with this snake and that or the other amen and you say that is the God that you are worshiping you have been you have been formed in the image of God Amen Hallelujah praise God so God has hands God has feet amen hallelujah amen you are a spirit being here being formed by God being sent from God Amen and placed into human bodies amen hallelujah so how could you imagine this God that you say that your serving is some kind of a a vapor or some kind of form of some kind of imagination with all kind of weirdness amen that to just show you how twisted man's mind has been become yes amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God she had heard that there was a God and that God was not some dumb Idol amen but a living God who lived amongst his people amen and not just living amongst his people but kinds Miracles and wonders were following them amen hallelujah hallelujah and she heard about it amen have you any one of you have ever been to brother BR any his meeting it was way before our time but you believe when you hear the testimonies and the Miracles and all the happenings that were happening under his ministry you believe it and you know it's true yes sir amen man and we still have a few of the Believers and the ones that who were delivered under his ministry alive still some of them today that could testify that it is real yes sir man we just had the brother Brady who has gone on to be with the Lord stand right here in this pulpit and testify what God had done for him amen hallelujah so she heard of the reports and she believed the reports and she believed there were true reports yes sir amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus so you see one day two Representatives came to Jericho from the tribe of Israel you see they were surrounding Jericho then hallelujah beyond the Jordan amen and they were just waiting as Maxwell was preaching and you know surrounding the enemy surrounding the enemy and I believe God had used that you know in a way to deal with some of our own situations amen just how the enemy to surround us and try to to to to to weaken us we could do the same thing man now amen reverse technology reverse tactics amen if you you shut off all the lines or all the communications that the enemy has been feeding you to weaken you amen just think what is going to happen to your other side your spiritual life shut off all them shut off all them things that so easily beset you you w tell you that man get rid of all them things that is so easily beset you cut off all those lines of communication of all those things that trying to get at your life spiritual life to suck the life is out of you amen hallelujah just try it amen and you see how your energy amen you see Satan is a parasite amen he have no life as his own know amen is you have to give him your life that he can come what's a Cancer and a caner suck the life out you to live so if you cut that thing off you going to live kill that caner kill that demon cut the life that that germ or whatever it is that is trying to take your life amen amen hallelujah so we see that these two Representatives amen came to Jericho from to Jericho and of all people they landed up in a prostitute or a harlot's Home amen hallelujah I believe man now we can look back at the story and believe that was a predestinated seed God knew that she would receive them because she already has some faith and Revelation that is been building up inside of her amen just so when you heard the message for the first time amen there was something inside of you telling you it is the truth amen that was attracted you yes amen and it's only the jeans seed of God inside of you that could respond to thaten to know that it's truth hallelujah so here we see amen they at a home praise the Lord and she hid them and I like her attitude amen hallelujah she never said I believe when I see the great anointed Joshua or Moses to do some kind of Miracle before my eyes Amen to believe no amen a lot of people say seeing is believing amen is the reverse you going to believe and then you're going to see amen hallelujah amen you're going to see the mighty hand of God when you be leave hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah as this young woman after she had got her first hearing of Israel and if a God who was a God that answers prayer she knew that amen because I believe in the Jericho News man if they had television then or whatever they had them that they communicated by amen they were you know um getting the news all the surrounding news you [Music] see they knew that the children of Israel were a mighty people man because all the kings around them were destroyed around Jericho and they were getting the news that these people are coming after us and they were trembling in fear amen as the word of God said to us she beli and she trembled too because you know the devil believed to and he trembling too because when the mighty Army of God rising up as this Mighty Army of is being R rising up the devil is going to fear and tremble amen cancer ain't going to be no problem any situation around the prophet said cancer could just be just like a toot that you have just rebuke and it is gone just pull it and you're gone amen hallelujah man the you see the doctors make it sound so terrible when they tell you you have this that it's like a death sentence they pass in on you and they put fear on you and then you be start believing and you start to get weak amen that's how they work that's how the enemy operates brings fear upon you amen oh this is a terrible thing this is the end of your day you only got two weeks to live you only got three months to live or whatever amen but that's just Scare Tactics the enemy has we have personal testimonies right here sitting with us how God delivers cancer amen amen hallelujah Glory thank you Lord Praise His wonderful name thank you she believed that of a God that hears prayers and not only a God to pray to but a God that answers back right man is not a one way street pray pray pray pray pray God answers you back yes he does there is no prayer that is not answered every prayer that you make is answered amen hallelujah and we thank the Lord for that but when she heard that there was a god of Miracles who could perform Miracles he's a miracle working Goden you maybe can't explain how it is or how it's done all you know it's a miracle yes sir amen your salvation is a miracle it is to be born again is a miracle man you could have changed your life your own life some of the way where some of the the the things where we doing we were doing and the way we were going amen it's a miracle that God stopped us brought us to This Light to this where we are right now Hallelujah is if it wasn't for the grace of God in your life where would you be where would you be my my my she heard about how God dried up a sea and the people walk through it and drown a whole Army imagine that so that must be bringing Terror on them people they thought that they were well fortified I believe I heard I think the the the walls of Jericho were like I think were 20 or 30 ft wide that chariots could have ride around and the walls were so high that nobody could just actually climb them or attack them just like that without they being destroyed they believed that they were well fortified amen and well protected by all the walls that they have amen but they fail to recognize and realize that there is a a a a a a a nation a people whose God is on their side and nothing is impossible with them Hallelujah nothing is impossible hallelujah praise God thank you Lord and when she got the message this first message from two preachers that went over she quickly accepted it with all her heart she said I've heard no listen I have to accept this that I'm hearing you see the message that this spies brought but listen there is an uncoming storm destruction is on the way amen listen this world is in for a big surprise it has been destined for destruction man serious destruction man hallelujah praise God the preacher has been preaching for how many years oh we hear that so long I always say Noah preaches preached for 120 years did anyone got converted just think about it Noah preached for 120 years was only him and his family did he had any new converts no just think about it in his time you might say one in the time of Israel they say one in a million in his time was Zero man he preached as a witness to them amen hallelujah and this this world is being preached this gospel is being preached as a witness to them and the word said then shall the End come you're going to have no excuse Hallelujah no excuse whatsoever so she believed what the spies was saying because her home was on top the wall she had a penthouse amen and she was doing good business amen so when those two men came you know men were coming back and forth from a house amen that was a business man she was a prostitute a harlot so she was like you know a common person she wasn't someone that people look up to they look down on her amen hallelujah and when the two spies came you know other other people were spying on her how did they know that two men came into her house you know people like Busy Body amen and I believe it's the woman of the area now they say I hope my husband I going up there they were checking out to see who going and who coming so as soon as they saw two strange men come in and she took them they had them uh how you call them tattle Tage they run quick quick quick to the FBI the CIA Jericho police or whoever there was there and said listen there are strange men in in in in in rehab's place know and I believe they come to spy out so the king sent the FBI or the CIA knocking at her door I he I had two men came in here and these two strange men here I know they're not from yeah they come to spy out the land they come to see what's happening around here where are they where are these men men you see but Rahab had an understanding in her heart she got a revelation man and I don't want to jump ahead too fast to unfold this story you see it looks like a just another most people say Nancy n Nancy story or just a a Sunday school story now you know um there was this lady she helped you know two spies and and the spies tell her to do this and that and that and she was saved it's more than that know if you go right in the depth of what happened here it runs from Genesis to Revelation amen praise God so when she she said Faith she heard she said faith we say faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of the Lord amen so she heard and she believed she just didn't hear it she believed what she heard and she took it to her heart and she believed I believe that these men are speaking the truth amen that what they're saying is the truth amen hallelujah I heard that the god of Heaven who is the real God and our whole country is trembling because of it fear were upon the whole of Jericho yes amen and you know what she said I'm asking for Mercy hallelujah praise God and I just want to pause here did you know that she typed the Gentile church amen and she was a type of the Gentile church when they when they heard the message and put ourselves into that we were all in spiritual prostitution amen hallelujah committing spiritual fornication against the god of Heaven in all kinds of stuff all kinds of denomination and religion where did you come fromen Hallelujah and recognize that listen amen what we what we were doing was terrible amen hallelujah our hearts weren't WR with the true and living God and there had to come A Change we had to be born again amen this lifestyle that we following is going to lead us to destruction amen and something pricked in your heart and say listen you got to turn around amen you got to turn around change your lifestyle change it amen and the only one who can do that is the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God and when we heard that there was a real God that still lived and could perform Miracles we quickly receive the message when this message struck your heart amen what did it do for you amen hallelujah something inside of you tell you listen this is real this is truth amen hallelujah thank you Lord she learned of the oncoming Storm from the two spies that judgment was about to fall on Jericho and tonight you may ask yourself that same question what what can I do to escape amen a lot of us have already taken that decision mean and the last time we ministered here preparing for the oncoming storm hallelujah hallelujah and there is that storm on that day was just a little foreshadow amen as soon as we left and went out in the park and lot there to leave out of nowhere out of a blue sky out of nowhere a storm just came and just swept through here and we are a lot of us here were Witnesses of that I was driving on just up the street here there were pylons on the side of the street were just flying across the road like that like nothing branches were falling people were kind of D from the trees the wind was so strong man broke their branches and people were kind of dodging your vehicles you know and I saying Lord what's happening here take us through this the rain was like this sideways man Hallelujah and that was just showing you just as a warning listen that just smoke the real thing coming later but we ain't going to be here we got to be prepared to get out of here hallelujah so here we see Rahab you know she wanted to know what to do amen what can I do to escape just as they did on the day of Pentecost amen when 3,000 Hearts were convinced and convicted that there is only one true and living God Amen Hallelujah and his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah now we like to continue to verse 12 amen here we see now therefore I pray swear unto me by the Lord since I have shown you kindness now here she wants to cut a deal with these two guys you know she want to cut a deal with them now I show you kindness I do you a favor amen I want you to do me a favor in modern terms you know we say you know you're cutting a deal but she was making a covenant with them you see God made a with Abraham but that was an unconditional Covenant amen hallelujah Abraham didn't have to do anything to to to to receive that amen hallelujah but you and I here is amen excuse me you got to believe believe which is an action word you got to do something faith comes by hearing and by hearing of the word of the Lord you got to do something you can't just shut off your ears shut off your mind to the word you got to believe and act upon what you believe you got to confess it amen hallelujah praise the Lord so here we we see she's making a cutting a deal with the two men amen hallelujah praise God that that you will show kindness unto my father's house amen and give me a true token not some lie not some makeup something not some kind of false something she wants a true token amen hallelujah praise God and now she's not only asking for herself or no she's asking for my father verse 13 and that you will save alive my father my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from Death my praise God

men of the in the Hall of Faith men we see Enoch we see Sarah we see Abraham we see Moses and the list goes on and on but when we go down to verse 31 we see rehab and it's not just just just rehab they say rehab the harot man Hallelujah and we read by faith the harot Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace she was counted with all the great and left as a legacy that we can look back and know it's it's no matter what your condition is right now now no matter what condition you are in right now God is more than able to deliver you God is more than able to save you God is more than able to heal you God is more than able to transform you amen hallelujah amen you see after Rahab she was spared she got all of her people in everything that was under that red scarlet cord amen amen hallelujah you see how they all was saved amen now remember all the walls of Jericho fell except her who you we talk about America every stone as the brother said over the weekend here every stone wrong fell and if you go to Jericho and a trip to Israel anytime you're going to see it man flattened they're still there the ruins are still there they never built it back man hallelujah praise God and she had to live somewhere else amen because if we go to I believe in Joshua chapter 7 22 oh 6 sorry 622 man Hallelujah but Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the hot's house and bring out then the woman and all that she had as ye swear unto her man now just before that Joshua sent in his army and utterly destroyed man woman and beasts everything destroyed everything amen except her amen hallelujah and we goes to verse 23 and the young men that were spies went and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her Brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her Kindred and left them without the camp of Israel so here we see she went to Israel to live with the Israelites amen hallelujah but you know the story still end there man the stories still did not end there man now as we said all the the walls of Jericho fell and she needed somewhere to go live right and we see her when she was taken in as one of the Israelites she encountered a man from Israel and fell in love with this man my my my who was a captain of the prince of Judah he was the captain of the Israelite armies and his name was Salomon very similar in pronunciation to Solomon and when the estate was settled up for the Israelites she and her beloved husband lived in Bethlehem now we see a connection now here is where the Gentiles were introduced into Israel and by you know who by a harlot a prostitute my Hallelujah we all were Harlot and prostitute to the word of the Lord and thank God that he grafted Us in and brought us in thank you Lord hallelujah amen praise God and now when we go to Matthew 1:5 which a lot of us like to skip and read over that quick the generations you know as this one beg got this one beg got beg got beg beg got amen we like to pass that fast but when we go to verse five Amen in Matthew chapter 1 again we see her name is mentioned here amen and here is the generations leading up to Jesus they had a son boas but now remember this woman was a prostitute and she wore with many many men and there is no record that she had a child before so what we saying here God had to be protecting that seed that lineage my what a God we ser my my and here She is again they had a son Boaz which brought another Gentile inen Hallelujah and then Boaz became become Jesse and Jesse was born to David and David right on here as the same little bethleem was anointed by the prophet of God and through that Lan AG you mean the Lord Jesus Christ had to come through that just showing you how God my is rich in Mercy had to use amen a harot amen through the generations to come by amen hallelujah what else just think about it just think about that sh we shouldn't be no proud of nothing the great almighty God creator of Heaven and Earth came down through that lineage to show us listen listen no matter where you at there is hope for you there's Mercy for you there's grace extended towards you hallelujah amen praise God now and again it doesn't end there you we see again appearing in James chapter 2 verse4 I believe amen 14 um verse 25 likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot and you know something every time we mention you see her name you you see the word Harlot attached to it there's a reason for that there is a reason for that God placed that in the scripture there that there is nobody is counted out no one no one is counted out so no matter if you sin be as Scarlet amen red dirty whatever they shall be white as snow thank you Lord man imagine that hallelujah what l Len men for before I go there we see likewise also was not rhab dahala justified by works when she had received the messenges and had sent them out another way you see you cannot do something for a son or daughter of God without being rewarded you say if you give a him a cup of water to one of these one you have a reward to get amen and here was a predestinated seed of God Amen doing a favor amen doing something good for those two men what she get what did she get not only life here she was the Legacy a living Memorial throughout man that her name could be recorded from the Old Testament right onto the New Testament as a legacy to us that no matter what you are God can do anything Amen to deliver you amen hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah what lessons can we learn from this tonight Hallelujah now we we watch how beautiful this is first the red heer the color red means something red to us means danger it is a sign to say stop danger is ahead but in the Bible it is representing Redemption it's a covering it's an atonement red means safe safety here we see rhab let the spies down on the red string to safety always safety on the red the blood is red and there is safety under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ man no safe place to be under his wings to be under him for his shed blood to cover us and his blood is not just literal blood which is his holy spirit amen to overshadow us to infill usen Hallelujah and you know if you though your sins be a Scarlet man you say red you see red true red gives you white amen hallelujah no matter what you've done my friend brother my sister those that are listening in when God looks sees you confessed your sins as being wrong and God looks through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ he see you clean he sees you white he doesn't see your sin no more they're gone man he said when you confess them they're in the sea of God's forgetfulness hallelujah thank you Lord and in closing man all of rahab's family was saved under the token and that only remember God's destroying Angels honor that token when the churches went down the mayor fell the city went down the Kings went down the governor the educated the pretty wom the handsome men the all important people the all in sufficient everything went down that was not under that token amen amen so it will be in the coming of the Son of God his
