[19:49] God let's go to our
[19:56] scripture 1 Peter chapter 1
[20:00] um same scripture that we started with
[20:02] blessed be the God and father of our
[20:04] Lord Jesus Christ which according to His
[20:07] abundant Mercy hath begotten us again
[20:11] unto a lively Hope by the resurrection
[20:14] of Jesus Christ from the dead everything
[20:17] surrounds Christ we need to keep this in
[20:21] the center focal point of our minds this
[20:24] is an age now where they are removing
[20:27] Christ
[20:29] from his rightful place and position in
[20:32] the word of God when you do that you
[20:35] throw everything out and I don't care
[20:38] how smart or how intellectual or how
[20:43] much you can uh you know understand the
[20:47] universe and the way things work and
[20:49] your understanding without Christ there
[20:52] is no salvation there is no uh
[20:56] continuing City there is no ET Eternal
[20:59] Body amen praise God you then identify
[21:03] yourselves as having a beginning and an
[21:05] end anything that has a beginning must
[21:08] have an End Amen so to an inheritance
[21:12] Incorruptible this is not anything that
[21:14] can this is absolutely Incorruptible
[21:18] undefiled and that fadeth not away it's
[21:21] reserved in heaven for you amen and for
[21:25] me who are kept by the power of God
[21:28] through
[21:29] Revelation Faith people say faith oh I
[21:32] got faith I got faith faith is when God
[21:35] reveals to you who you
[21:38] are and who he is am without
[21:43] any confusion amen through faith unto
[21:47] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[21:51] last
[21:52] time in the last days the Lord add His
[21:56] blessings to the word of God Amen praise
[21:58] God
[21:59] God so um you know uh let's read that
[22:03] that quote again um next slide here
[22:05] brother Braham speaking and he says and
[22:07] these things that we're talking about
[22:09] was to be revealed when at the last days
[22:13] amen just before the last trumpet at the
[22:17] end of the message of the last Church
[22:20] age how many knows we've already we've
[22:23] already uh transitioned from leoda the
[22:27] bride has already trans IED amen
[22:30] everything under the seven Church Ages
[22:32] was led by man the the uh uh the
[22:36] eighth day okay the holy convocation if
[22:40] you go back into the into the feasts of
[22:42] of Israel there was an eighth day and it
[22:45] was the Holy convocation and that was
[22:48] back to the beginning again that was
[22:51] another day it was an eternal day the
[22:53] beginning was eternal the end will be
[22:56] Eternal amen praise God and so we need
[22:59] to understand that the church age uh you
[23:02] know the leod deian church age though we
[23:04] are physically still in it the bride is
[23:09] operating in a realm above it it's
[23:12] called this the the the Eternal Church
[23:15] age it's where there is an eternal
[23:17] messenger where Christ has already come
[23:20] amen praise God that's right and if you
[23:23] want to read that now you can turn to I
[23:26] just referred to you last night three
[23:28] times
[23:29] Revelations 10 1-7 see and in the days
[23:32] of the sounding of the seventh Angel's
[23:34] message the mystery of God would be
[23:38] revealed and finished and so we know
[23:41] that that through the the ministry of
[23:44] William Maryam Branham certain scripture
[23:48] was fulfilled and one of them was
[23:50] Revelations 10 1 through 7 amen where
[23:54] the seventh angel because there was
[23:56] seven Church age men Messengers amen
[24:00] remember while brother brandham was was
[24:03] preaching this he was the seventh angel
[24:07] to the seventh Church age we were still
[24:10] under the dispensation of time we were
[24:13] still under the dispensation of man amen
[24:16] but as we know that there was different
[24:18] anointings the man anointing through
[24:21] Luther and and and so forth until we
[24:23] came to the eagle anointing which was
[24:26] Eagle is prophetic and that was William
[24:29] bram's Ministry the seventh Church age
[24:31] and he was the messenger to the
[24:33] Pentecostal Church
[24:35] age understanding that we were still
[24:38] under man under time at that time but
[24:42] when the seventh when the seventh angel
[24:45] was what brother Brandon was told to go
[24:48] back to Jeffersonville to preach the
[24:51] opening of The Seven Seals that was a
[24:54] supernatural event that that took us
[24:57] from
[24:59] time to
[25:01] Eternity from an Earthly Messenger to a
[25:05] Heavenly messenger which was Christ The
[25:08] Mighty Angel amen praise God and so it's
[25:11] important to understand these things
[25:13] when when it comes to um you know
[25:16] placing where we are now a lot of people
[25:19] are still stuck under William brandham
[25:21] under a man Ministry though he was a
[25:24] prophetic Ministry they're still stuck
[25:26] on oh you just got to listen to the
[25:28] tapes you got to you got to only say
[25:30] what the tapes say and they're not
[25:32] recognizing the transition from the
[25:35] mighty angel coming down
[25:37] himself it was Christ himself coming to
[25:41] meet and Unite with the body and people
[25:45] want to stay with the with the sign post
[25:49] the one that was pointing just like John
[25:51] the Baptist Behold the Lamb of God who
[25:54] takes away the sins of the world okay
[25:58] they had to leave John and follow Christ
[26:01] and when brother brandham said uh you
[26:03] know that he had even he even said
[26:05] himself he's gonna have to go off the
[26:07] scene in order for him to come on the
[26:10] scene and take his rightful
[26:12] position and that's the message that we
[26:14] Preach Today that's what separates us
[26:19] and transitions us from denominational
[26:23] Church to the Eternal Church where
[26:26] Christ is now operating in a people yes
[26:30] through a five-fold Ministry speaking to
[26:33] you
[26:34] individually remember when Mary listen
[26:37] when when when Jesus was on the earth he
[26:40] had a public
[26:41] Ministry he was publicly going to
[26:44] different places uh you know he would
[26:46] debate with the Pharisees they would
[26:48] challenge him and everything else but
[26:51] after the
[26:52] Resurrection Mary goes to the to the
[26:55] tomb to go and and see uh you know you
[26:58] know where they had laid him and she
[27:01] goes there and she didn't actually
[27:04] recognize when she went to the tomb
[27:06] there was somebody standing there and
[27:08] she asked him if he had seen where Jesus
[27:12] was she couldn't actually recognize that
[27:15] it was him until he spoke her name until
[27:20] he said Mary and then her understanding
[27:23] was opened what was that that was now
[27:27] him going to
[27:30] individuals no longer going to the
[27:32] people they had rejected the word they
[27:35] had crucified the word it was no longer
[27:38] going to be to a mass amount of people
[27:41] it was going to be to individuals Christ
[27:45] speaking directly look the the brothers
[27:48] the disciples on the road to EMAs he
[27:50] walked right up to them remember they
[27:52] were with him but their eyes were held
[27:56] that's why Christ can be here and so
[27:59] many people will not recognize him
[28:01] because he has to open your eyes he has
[28:05] to open your understanding so that you
[28:07] can recognize that it's him that he's
[28:10] here now unveiling himself personally he
[28:14] it wasn't until he broke the bread with
[28:17] the disciples that their eyes were
[28:19] opened what is what is breaking the
[28:21] bread breaking the word opening the word
[28:24] of God so that you could recognize what
[28:27] was actually going on and from that
[28:31] point on Christ was making himself known
[28:35] personally to individuals and that's
[28:38] what he's doing now he's in that
[28:40] Ministry now it's not about John the
[28:43] Baptist it's not about William Branham
[28:46] though you could never remove William
[28:48] Branham from the portion of the word
[28:51] that he fulfilled and the ministry that
[28:53] he fulfilled but he went off the scene
[28:57] he's no longer here and and we need to
[29:00] get our Focus On Christ the word he's
[29:04] telling you listen it's me but he opens
[29:08] the eyes and the understanding of whom
[29:10] he chooses we don't open people's eyes
[29:14] we can invite them to come into the
[29:16] house of the Lord we can invite yeah
[29:17] come to Good Neighbor Ministries
[29:19] everybody is welcome but people will
[29:22] come and they will go people will come
[29:26] and they will stay
[29:28] because they will say you alone have the
[29:31] words of eternal life not Pastor Danny
[29:34] or whoever's ministering behind here
[29:37] Christ himself unveiling himself
[29:40] personal by Revelation breaking the
[29:43] bread of the word opening the word to
[29:45] you individually so that you can
[29:47] recognize he's alive he's a reality he's
[29:51] not a denominational
[29:53] Christ but he's the Living God in the
[29:57] power of his resurrection amen praise
[30:00] God so when this took place um you know
[30:05] uh let's read let's read the uh the
[30:07] quote and these
[30:08] things um yeah the second seal and these
[30:11] things that we're talking about was to
[30:13] be revealed in the last days just before
[30:15] the last trumpet at the end of the
[30:17] message of the last Church age that's
[30:19] right if you want to read that now you
[30:22] can turn to it I just referred to it
[30:24] last night three times Revelations 10:
[30:26] 1-7 and in the day days of the sounding
[30:28] of the seventh Angel's message the
[30:31] mystery of God would be revealed and
[30:33] finished so you need to understand that
[30:36] the opening of The Seven Seals was what
[30:39] brought Christ to the Earth it wasn't
[30:42] William branam that open those seals
[30:46] remember the mighty angel in Revelations
[30:48] 10:7 is standing there with one foot on
[30:51] the land one foot on the
[30:53] sea okay and he's got a book in his hand
[30:57] and it's open
[30:58] so the book had already been open
[31:00] remember so now and there's only one
[31:03] thing left when this seventh sealed book
[31:06] is open than the entire mystery of God
[31:10] why we've probed at it through the years
[31:13] and according to the scripture then
[31:15] there was no way to understand it until
[31:18] this day brother bram's talking about
[31:21] his day amen okay that's where God had
[31:26] unveiled those seven seals brother B
[31:28] says my God if the angel had not come
[31:31] into the room every night to correct me
[31:35] on what my interpretation was on these
[31:39] seals I would have made a mess of
[31:43] it because Christ had to open those
[31:46] seals no man was worthy to loose the
[31:49] seals thereof so don't don't go be
[31:52] looking back and say oh William brandham
[31:54] opened the seals no he didn't open the
[31:56] seals he was the messenger that was sent
[32:01] to speak and preach and be the voice of
[32:05] God in that age in order
[32:10] to speak the mind of the mighty Angel
[32:14] himself who had come down amen there was
[32:17] no way to understand it until this day
[32:21] because it's been hid we've seen the
[32:24] symbol that it was symbolized by but it
[32:27] could not be correctly revealed until
[32:30] the last day see now then we must be
[32:34] there at at the end time and so this
[32:40] now is what is in progress right now
[32:44] this this aspect of the word being
[32:48] fulfilled through the opening of those
[32:51] seals it's in progress a lot of people
[32:53] thought that um you know even in the
[32:55] message even now people are thinking
[32:57] that that when the Seven Seals were
[32:59] opened it was revealing things that were
[33:00] to
[33:02] come but we know that the first six
[33:05] seals were almost all
[33:07] fulfilled
[33:09] amen but but it had to be properly
[33:12] placed the events the the the the
[33:15] characters people did not understand
[33:18] that the seals that the first six seals
[33:20] had all been opened under the seven
[33:22] Church ages it all started happening
[33:24] right from from Pentecost all the way
[33:27] down
[33:28] down up until now and that pale horse
[33:32] rider the fourth Rider he's still riding
[33:36] and you know where he's riding
[33:37] now in the
[33:39] message where he could be so deceiving
[33:42] that he would deceive even the very
[33:44] elect if it were possible but it's not
[33:47] possible am it's impossible because you
[33:50] can't deceive Christ and it's Christ
[33:53] back in his church again amen praise God
[33:57] Halle
[33:58] so so uh when brother brandham
[34:01] ministered on those seals it it was it
[34:04] allowed the spirit of Christ to unveil
[34:06] what was under each of those seals the
[34:10] Mysteries that were locked up under
[34:13] those seals of who the the horse riders
[34:15] were that you know a lot of people even
[34:17] now there's some that are still
[34:18] preaching that the white horse rider is
[34:22] Christ but BR God's Prophet caught the
[34:25] Revelation and and the Lord revealed to
[34:27] him him no that's
[34:29] Satan it's just him changing his his his
[34:34] placing and his levels of deception
[34:36] through the church ages all the way down
[34:39] through you can you can look from the
[34:41] first horse rider all the way down and
[34:44] you you'll see through the first second
[34:45] third fourth Church age how they all
[34:48] correlate how they run parallel how
[34:50] those characters operated how the same
[34:53] Spirits were operating throughout the
[34:55] Dark Ages with the red horse rider the
[34:58] black horse rider the black horse riders
[35:01] War right we went through World War I
[35:05] World War I and there is a World War II
[35:09] all of these things were opened up under
[35:11] the six
[35:14] seal and it's history now but World War
[35:17] II is still to come amen and so Satan
[35:21] just he was just changing his disguise
[35:23] from one to the other so the six seals
[35:26] was was being un veiled through the
[35:28] seven Church ages without the opening of
[35:32] the of the Seven Seals the book would
[35:35] still be
[35:37] closed that's why the book needed to be
[35:41] open everything would have still been
[35:43] sealed the mystery of
[35:45] Christ finished when William
[35:49] brandham
[35:51] spoke those Seven Seals and when he got
[35:55] to the seventh seal
[35:57] Christ had fully
[36:01] come and took his position now to go and
[36:05] meet with the church and to call
[36:08] individuals into the body of Christ amen
[36:11] praise God but the book had to be open
[36:15] and now the book has to be
[36:19] transferred in typ form okay into the
[36:24] hands of the Bride let's continue on and
[36:26] you'll understand that even more okay so
[36:31] the mighty angel in Revelation 10 now
[36:33] standing saying time shall be no more
[36:36] because the book was
[36:38] open when that book opened it was to
[36:43] unveil an eternal church it was it was
[36:48] yet when the book was open seven
[36:50] Thunders uttered their voices but then
[36:52] John was told you can't write that why
[36:55] was that not written
[36:58] that was a portion of the word that was
[37:01] to remain sealed in those seals though
[37:05] the seals were open but yet the Thunders
[37:08] were not
[37:10] revealed so you know you wonder well why
[37:14] what was going on there well let's move
[37:19] along so the opening of The Seven seal
[37:22] uh took place through the ministry of
[37:24] William
[37:25] Branham it brought Jesus Jesus Christ in
[37:28] his second coming we need to understand
[37:30] what those seals what the seventh seal
[37:33] actually did it brought Christ cuz
[37:36] remember 1 to six was all history but
[37:40] the seventh brings Christ on the scene
[37:44] it's what brought Jesus Christ in his
[37:47] second coming a lot of people out there
[37:49] a lot of churches
[37:51] 99% of Christian churches are still
[37:54] waiting on the second coming of Jesus
[37:56] Christ
[37:58] he's here he's already come and they're
[38:02] and they're waiting for him to show up
[38:04] in the clouds he's already showed up in
[38:06] the
[38:07] cloud oh my what an hour we're living in
[38:10] amen and he's here he's now operating in
[38:14] the bride to fulfill right now the
[38:19] Rapture of the church remember the next
[38:23] major event is the rapture
[38:27] it's in a moment in the twinkling of an
[38:29] eye we're going to be changed praise God
[38:32] hallelujah let's go to the next
[38:35] scripture so there's review here and
[38:38] then there's whatever the Lord added
[38:40] here in my notes so and when he had
[38:41] taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and
[38:45] 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[38:48] having every one of them Harps and
[38:50] golden vials full of oders which are the
[38:53] prayers of the Saints and they sung a
[38:55] new song
[38:57] now it was a totally different song
[38:59] because now somebody had taken the lamb
[39:02] had taken the book and had loosed the
[39:05] seals and they sung a new song Thou Art
[39:07] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[39:10] seals thereof for thou was slain has
[39:14] redeemed us to God by the blood of out
[39:17] of every Kindred and tongue and people
[39:20] and nation and has made us unto our God
[39:24] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[39:28] Earth notice there and behold and I
[39:31] heard the voice of many angels round
[39:34] about the throne and the beasts and the
[39:37] and the elders and the number of them
[39:39] was 10,000s times 10 thousands and
[39:42] thousands of thousands amen praise God
[39:46] there's going to be a a a a Hallelujah
[39:49] re reuniting up there let me tell you
[39:52] because this is what uh this is telling
[39:56] us they were singing a brand new song
[39:59] they had entered into a a a a revelation
[40:02] that they were going to be restored back
[40:05] to their rightful position because
[40:07] remember in the other scriptures in in
[40:10] in uh Revelations 5 John wept John was
[40:14] panicking because there was nobody that
[40:16] could actually take the book so there
[40:18] was something that was that was that
[40:21] that that was being held back and John
[40:23] was was panicking like all of all of
[40:26] everything would be be lost the whole
[40:28] earth everybody would be lost nothing
[40:30] would be would would be complete the
[40:33] whole Plan of Redemption would have gone
[40:34] down the
[40:35] drain in
[40:37] John's
[40:40] eyes if somebody had not been able to
[40:42] take that book and to
[40:45] loose now remember it's not a literal
[40:48] book get that out of your head we're
[40:51] talking about a
[40:53] book we're thinking and I know our minds
[40:55] operate you know when we say a word we
[40:58] immediately associate with a
[41:00] book but you need to see beyond the book
[41:04] the book is God it's Christ it's not
[41:08] even
[41:09] god listen before there could be a god
[41:12] there had to be something to worship
[41:17] God so God was God is just a word that
[41:22] that that describes an object of
[41:25] worship amen he was the self-existent
[41:29] one the Eternal one amen praise God and
[41:32] so there was there was Great Tribulation
[41:36] in the heavens because nobody could be
[41:38] found to open this book amen glory to
[41:41] God let's read now let me see
[41:45] here
[41:47] so in Revelations 10: 1-7 the head comes
[41:51] to meet with the body showing that the
[41:53] spirit man Adam was coming
[41:58] to hand the book to the spirit man
[42:03] bride okay this is an event that's
[42:06] taking place you got to you got to
[42:09] understand what what this whole Plan of
[42:11] Redemption engulfs it's God redeeming
[42:15] his own amen put the heat down just a
[42:17] little bit please God redeeming his own
[42:21] God coming back to restore Adam and Eve
[42:25] amen okay glory to God anything or
[42:28] person that had a beginning must have an
[42:31] end but there's an invisible Union that
[42:35] had to take place it was the spirit God
[42:39] Adam restored coming to meet with the
[42:43] with the spirit part female aspect of
[42:48] himself
[42:51] amen so because we are not any longer
[42:56] identif ified As Time beings though we
[42:59] operate in
[43:01] time our true identities as Sons and
[43:05] Daughters of God are
[43:07] Eternal and we need to understand that
[43:10] we are matched with an eternal mate Adam
[43:15] and Eve back in the very beginning when
[43:18] God created Adam In His Image made that
[43:22] made him male and female called their
[43:25] name Adam
[43:27] I know you've heard this but you got to
[43:29] you got to bring the the the clarity of
[43:31] the revelation of what I'm saying here
[43:34] because it's so important to understand
[43:37] who you are and what it is that God is
[43:40] doing in the true church in this hour
[43:43] it's not about church going it's not
[43:45] about joining a
[43:47] church that's all that's all traditions
[43:51] of
[43:52] man that's all traditions of man we need
[43:55] to get we need to live our our our our
[43:59] our thinking our our senses our in our
[44:02] intuition to to a level of faith into
[44:05] Heavenly places where we can see our
[44:08] rightful positions as Sons and Daughters
[44:11] of God we are not creatures of
[44:14] time we are creatures of
[44:17] Eternity the only ones that can go back
[44:20] to Eternity are those that came from
[44:22] eternity amen we are not identified with
[44:26] time anymore more even though we're in
[44:28] it but we are the final voice to the
[44:32] Gentile dispensation that operates in
[44:36] time because that's their position their
[44:39] their position is not in the body of
[44:42] Christ remember all that was in God he
[44:46] poured into Christ all that was in
[44:49] Christ he poured into the church so
[44:53] actually what's happening is God is
[44:56] calling ACH church out of the
[44:59] churches and that's why we've been
[45:01] called
[45:02] out people think we're strange
[45:05] where what is this that you believe we
[45:09] believe the word you see that's that's
[45:11] what came and called you you're not oh I
[45:15] believe a prophet God sent a prophet
[45:17] yeah you believe God sent a prophet
[45:18] because you believe the
[45:21] word you wouldn't you wouldn't be able
[45:23] to
[45:24] believe sorry I was going to sneeze
[45:26] there you wouldn't be able to
[45:28] believe that God sent a prophet unless
[45:32] you believed the word that says behold I
[45:35] send unto you Elijah the
[45:39] prophet you wouldn't be able to believe
[45:41] that you wouldn't be able to identify
[45:43] with that unless you could believe the
[45:44] word and that's why when when you say to
[45:47] somebody well how are you baptized and
[45:50] and they don't even know they oh I got
[45:51] baptized as a baby they never look to
[45:53] see if their experience lined up up with
[45:57] the word because God is not going to
[46:00] judge you based on your priest's
[46:02] interpretation or your Church's
[46:04] interpretation he's going to judge you
[46:07] according to his word hallelujah so we
[46:11] are the last and final voice to the
[46:15] Gentile Christian Church age amen
[46:20] hallelujah so now we understand that the
[46:22] mighty angel came to open the book which
[46:26] was sealed by Seven Seals and thus the
[46:29] requirement of William branham's
[46:31] prophetic ministry as a prophet to
[46:34] preach the Seven Seals to spiritually
[46:38] open the book loose the seals the word
[46:42] thundered out so when the when the
[46:44] Thunders took place he was told not to
[46:47] write that and that was right in
[46:49] Revelations 10
[46:51] 1-7 and and to this day there's no
[46:54] interpretation on the Thunders
[46:58] why because it's being
[47:03] manifest in you and
[47:06] me so John was not permitted to write it
[47:10] because it could only be revealed in the
[47:13] last time God had placed himself a
[47:18] portion of the
[47:19] word identified in each and every one of
[47:22] you as individuals in this time in 2024
[47:27] I don't know when this is all going to
[47:28] end but until it does come to the
[47:31] Fulfillment of the Rapture there's going
[47:33] to be attributes Sons and Daughters of
[47:36] God that are going to hear this message
[47:39] and they're going to be able to respond
[47:40] to the message because it's God calling
[47:43] their name remember when Jesus said Mary
[47:48] he called her name and immediately her
[47:51] eyes were
[47:53] open it takes Christ to call the
[47:56] individual amen praise God and that's
[47:59] all in the
[48:01] Thunders and the Thunders was all in the
[48:05] book it was all sealed in the book
[48:08] remember when the seals were open seven
[48:10] Thunders uttered their
[48:13] voices these Thunders have voices yes
[48:17] they
[48:18] do so the seals are open but the
[48:21] Thunders are not revealed they're
[48:24] Unwritten
[48:26] listen to brother brandham here and then
[48:29] there is coming forth seven mysterious
[48:31] Thunders that's not even written at all
[48:36] that's right and I believe that those
[48:39] that through those seven Thunders will
[48:42] be revealed in the last days in order to
[48:45] get the bride together for rapturing
[48:50] Faith did you hear
[48:52] that I'll read it one more time and I
[48:56] believe that through those seven
[48:59] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[49:03] days in order to get the bride together
[49:06] for rapturing Faith because what we got
[49:10] right now we wouldn't be able to do it
[49:14] see brother brandham realized right and
[49:17] here he was in the midst of so much
[49:20] Supernatural in his ministry people
[49:22] would walk up into his prayer lines and
[49:25] he would look at them and the angel of
[49:27] the Lord would would show him a vision
[49:28] would break right in front of him and
[49:30] he'd look at the woman he would he would
[49:31] tell them what their name was where they
[49:34] lived where they were yesterday they
[49:36] were with a doctor and he had a dark he
[49:38] had dark hair on his name was Dr so and
[49:40] so and he told you that that that you
[49:43] know that your test results had produced
[49:45] this and that you had cancer and that
[49:47] you had this much time to live and the
[49:48] person would just go into shock and say
[49:51] how could this be how can this man here
[49:54] William brandham was experiencing so
[49:56] much Supernatural somebody died right in
[49:59] his M right in his meetings and he said
[50:02] hold on just wait let's see what the
[50:04] Lord is going to do went there prayed
[50:07] over the individual right back to life
[50:09] back to the service
[50:11] again a dead a woman brings a dead child
[50:15] from early in the morning she had held
[50:17] that dead child in that meeting in
[50:19] Mexico for hours and hours and it wasn't
[50:23] until that night that the holy spirit
[50:25] said call up the
[50:28] woman to bring the
[50:31] child because God had showed him that
[50:34] that child was going to
[50:35] live and the child was brought to him
[50:38] dead affidavit signed by doctors proven
[50:43] 100% God was doing so much Supernatural
[50:47] in his ministry but yet here he
[50:50] says that we we wouldn't be able to
[50:54] produce the rapture
[50:56] there is something we've got to step
[50:59] farther he knew there would be a
[51:01] progression to the word of God and here
[51:04] we are 60 years
[51:08] later things are
[51:11] progressing the word is progressing the
[51:14] word is unveiling itself he's the same
[51:18] God but yet he's got something within
[51:20] those Thunders that's now in you and
[51:23] me and operating in our lives to fulfill
[51:27] this word and to bring something that's
[51:29] going to give us rapturing faith in our
[51:32] lives listen the Rapture is already in
[51:35] progress It's already started in your
[51:37] life your friends and your family
[51:40] they've been missing you for years they
[51:41] know you're not the same person that you
[51:43] used to
[51:44] be because now you are being led by the
[51:48] spirit of God you're no longer led by
[51:50] man you're no longer led by man's
[51:53] intellectual teaching it only goes so
[51:55] far you can sit talk with scientists and
[51:58] and theologians and you can talk with
[52:00] very smart intellectual people but yet
[52:03] they don't even come even
[52:07] one% of what God has revealed to you
[52:10] personally imagine that and it's not
[52:13] because you did
[52:14] anything it's because your name was
[52:16] written in the Lamb's Book of Life it's
[52:19] because you were ordained as an
[52:22] attribute to be awakened to who you are
[52:26] in this
[52:27] day
[52:30] simple Hallelujah he says we've got to
[52:33] step farther we can't have enough faith
[52:36] for Divine Healing
[52:38] hardly we've got to have enough Faith to
[52:41] be changed in a moment and be swept up
[52:44] out of this Earth and we'll find that
[52:47] after a while the Lord willing find
[52:50] where it's
[52:53] written God is revealing that it's
[52:55] written somewhere
[52:58] but it's not written in a
[53:00] book cuz it's not even a
[53:03] book it's written in Epistles read of
[53:07] all men it's written in the volume of
[53:09] the book it's written in the body of
[53:12] Jesus Christ it's written in you and me
[53:15] fulfilling the word for our day
[53:18] identifying ourselves as the body of
[53:20] Christ in this day and in this hour
[53:23] Hallelujah the whole mystery that was
[53:26] revealed in the opening of that seventh
[53:29] seal was around the manifestation of God
[53:33] throughout the entire book
[53:36] remember from Genesis to Revelation you
[53:39] should be able to see Christ in type
[53:42] form it was always
[53:44] God fulfilling his Plan of Redemption
[53:48] manifesting type in type form through
[53:51] Abraham his first appearing was
[53:54] MDC it was Christ Christ the one who had
[53:58] no beginning and no end appears to
[54:01] Abraham the second time he comes what
[54:03] does he do he appears to Sarah and tells
[54:07] her about a promise that she's going to
[54:09] bring forth first he comes to the man
[54:11] then he comes to who the bride
[54:14] Hallelujah glory to God God comes to
[54:17] Sarah to unveil unto her that she's
[54:19] going to bring forth a son a
[54:21] supernatural son it's going to require
[54:24] her to be changed her bodies need to her
[54:27] her body needs to go from old to young
[54:29] again hallelujah we're being changed
[54:32] line upon line precept upon precept
[54:35] because we are going to bring forth a
[54:37] body
[54:39] change you can see him
[54:41] everywhere he's in every type in Joseph
[54:44] he's every it's Christ the same
[54:46] yesterday today and
[54:51] forever if we are the bride then we are
[54:54] not confused by the godhead
[54:57] as a matter of fact we have recognized
[54:59] that all that was in Christ has now been
[55:01] poured into us the church amen you got
[55:07] to come to a place where you recognize
[55:09] that you got to stop playing
[55:11] Church you got to stop playing
[55:15] religion we're not
[55:18] religious we are a million miles from
[55:20] being
[55:21] religious we are the sons and daughters
[55:25] of God amen and God brings forth
[55:32] Gods I know it's a little hard you know
[55:35] but you know what you're going to have
[55:36] to come to a place where your mind
[55:38] breaks into the mind of God this is not
[55:41] about exalting
[55:44] man it's never been about exalting man
[55:47] remember there was no man in heaven or
[55:50] on the earth that would be found
[55:53] worthy so there's no man or any woman
[55:56] there's none of you or no big minister
[56:00] no big Pope there's absolutely no one
[56:04] that can open and take the book it had
[56:08] to be Christ Adam the Lord Elohim the
[56:13] self-existent one the spirit man the
[56:18] almighty he's the only one that could
[56:20] take the book and unveil his plan and
[56:23] he's the only one that can say you are
[56:25] in and you are out
[56:28] he's the only one that could say my
[56:29] sheep hear my voice he's the only one
[56:32] that could say all that the Father the
[56:35] spirit the spirit God the Elohim the
[56:38] self-existent one all that he had
[56:40] thought and planned in his mind will
[56:45] come if you're an attribute you must
[56:48] come and it was all written in that book
[56:52] but there was going to be a time when
[56:53] the seals were going to be ripped off
[56:55] the book
[56:56] there was going to be a time like all of
[56:58] a sudden like we said when we ministered
[57:01] there a couple weeks ago there's no real
[57:04] talk about a book in the whole Old
[57:07] Testament not in any way shape or form
[57:10] the way that the book is being unveiled
[57:13] now and we know that the book is the
[57:15] Bible but yet the Bible is sealed unless
[57:19] God opens it to
[57:22] you that was the whole thing that's why
[57:24] the scripture says in Corinthians
[57:26] that the spirit gives the word life the
[57:30] letter kills the same Bible that
[57:33] scriptures that we read there's people
[57:36] reading it and they're reading it with
[57:38] no revelation of who God is and
[57:41] therefore there's no
[57:43] life because life only comes from God
[57:46] himself Hallelujah glory to
[57:49] God so no man could take the book no one
[57:53] could be found but notice that the book
[57:56] was at one time with Adam and
[57:59] Eve because brother brandom said we read
[58:02] the quote where Adam lost the book
[58:05] because the book was the book of life it
[58:07] was it was the book of that that that
[58:10] contained everything that was in the
[58:13] mind of God every single uh portion of
[58:19] himself that would be manifest
[58:24] Eternal everyone that that was was was
[58:28] in that book and Adam was was had the
[58:31] book when he was expressed in the image
[58:34] of God now remember don't physically
[58:38] think it's a
[58:39] book understand that he's the
[58:42] book but you have to be in the right
[58:45] position in order to unveil the pure
[58:50] unadulterated word of God without any
[58:56] any interpretation of
[58:58] man that's why Satan so so so when when
[59:01] Adam lost the book remember
[59:05] Eve was in Adam when he was in the
[59:09] spirit man form when God created let us
[59:13] make man in our image you were there the
[59:16] US was you and me we were there we were
[59:19] in the mind of God we were we were his
[59:22] female you know we're just using the
[59:24] word female aspect but it's God God
[59:28] expressed himself as male and female
[59:30] that's why he called their name Adam
[59:32] male and female but it wasn't until God
[59:35] created that
[59:37] body and Adam looked at her and called
[59:41] her name
[59:42] Eve it was then that she was identified
[59:46] with a different name before that she
[59:50] was
[59:51] Adam before we were in this dimension we
[59:56] were God we were with
[1:00:00] God
[1:00:02] Amen but he looks he calls her name Eve
[1:00:05] because he knew Adam knew he was the
[1:00:09] book he knew because the whole Paradox
[1:00:13] is that he's got a Plan of Redemption in
[1:00:15] the back of his mind and that's a that's
[1:00:17] something a lot of people forget to to
[1:00:19] identify and and bring to the surface
[1:00:22] that God has a
[1:00:24] plan Glory
[1:00:26] he has a plan he wanted to redeem he
[1:00:29] wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a
[1:00:33] Healer so he called her Eve because he
[1:00:37] knew that she would be the beding ground
[1:00:39] for serpent
[1:00:43] seed he knew that there was going to be
[1:00:47] a deceiver that was going to come and
[1:00:49] plant his own seed into Eve so that he
[1:00:53] could create for himself
[1:00:56] Satan wanted to be a Creator like God
[1:00:59] why so he could have people worship him
[1:01:02] and that's why he's got all these people
[1:01:03] worshiping him all over the Earth 98% of
[1:01:07] the people are deceived into worshiping
[1:01:10] Satan through all the political and
[1:01:12] World Systems that we are in
[1:01:16] today I was reading just yesterday about
[1:01:19] or this morning about about the
[1:01:21] religions of the world my wife and I
[1:01:23] were fellowshipping we're talking about
[1:01:25] yeah the the the the number one religion
[1:01:27] in the world is
[1:01:29] Christianity with 2 something
[1:01:33] billion people that identify with
[1:01:36] Christianity second
[1:01:39] is Islam and they're at like 1.7 or six
[1:01:44] billion I can't remember the exact
[1:01:46] number but do you know that the Jewish
[1:01:50] religion is
[1:01:53] 0.2 of 1%
[1:01:56] not even
[1:01:57] 1% I said to Sister Jen I said do you
[1:02:00] see do you see how how how because
[1:02:03] Israel always types the
[1:02:06] bride and you see now why our faith and
[1:02:10] our belief in the word of God is less
[1:02:14] than 1% of the whole
[1:02:17] population yeah there's 2. something
[1:02:20] bill yeah we call ourselves Christians
[1:02:22] because we are Christlike
[1:02:26] but we identify with the word and just
[1:02:28] like when Jesus was on the earth and he
[1:02:30] walked amongst the
[1:02:32] people he was being followed by a dozen
[1:02:37] people there was
[1:02:40] millions and only a dozen people were
[1:02:43] following the
[1:02:45] word you need to see something there
[1:02:48] Saints you are a
[1:02:50] minority don't think people are going to
[1:02:53] you think but how can they not see this
[1:02:55] how can they not see that God sent a
[1:02:57] prophet how can they not see the the the
[1:02:59] restoration of the seven churches it's
[1:03:01] all history it's all in the it's on
[1:03:03] Google you can look it all up you can
[1:03:06] they'll look up John Wesley they'll look
[1:03:08] up Martin Luther they'll look up Martin
[1:03:11] they'll look up Paul the first Messenger
[1:03:13] to the Ephesian Church age they'll see
[1:03:15] all of that they'll see that it's all
[1:03:17] history and when they come to William
[1:03:19] Bram the seventh Church age messenger
[1:03:22] who was the one that would that would
[1:03:24] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:03:26] the original
[1:03:28] faith in other words to bring us back to
[1:03:30] the word because Satan had infiltrated
[1:03:34] all the church ages and gone off with
[1:03:36] trinitarian Doctrine with uh you know
[1:03:39] praying to to to the Virgin Mary you
[1:03:42] know whatever wherever he could get you
[1:03:44] off the word it would be enough to get
[1:03:46] you away from Christ right up until
[1:03:49] today where they got the New Age
[1:03:50] movement and where they'll talk about
[1:03:52] everything and they'll even say that
[1:03:54] Christ was a master
[1:03:56] oh yes he reached the highest level of
[1:03:59] Consciousness not recognizing he's the
[1:04:02] absolute
[1:04:04] key he says no man comes to the father
[1:04:07] but by me no one goes back to Eternity
[1:04:11] but through me that's the
[1:04:13] plan you I you you you you remove him
[1:04:17] from the plan you can never go back it
[1:04:21] identifies that you never even came from
[1:04:23] there because only Eternal thoughts of
[1:04:27] God which is God himself and God can't
[1:04:29] make mistakes God's omniscient he's
[1:04:32] omnipresent he knows the beginning from
[1:04:34] the end he knows he he knows how many
[1:04:37] times a fly bats his eye because he's
[1:04:41] infinite and you want to go and tell the
[1:04:44] infinite God how the plan is going to
[1:04:47] work you want it to work no no it's
[1:04:48] going to work the way I say never mind
[1:04:50] this Jesus
[1:04:52] guy we're going to do it my way I'm a
[1:04:56] scientist don't you know I've got 17
[1:04:59] degrees on
[1:05:01] my business card l l d d p h g a b c d e
[1:05:08] f
[1:05:11] g f for
[1:05:14] fool it's as simple as that because God
[1:05:17] is infinite God reveals himself to whom
[1:05:19] he will he says the scripture says in
[1:05:22] Hebrews uh 12 that without faith Hebrews
[1:05:26] 11 without faith it's impossible to
[1:05:29] please
[1:05:31] God and you want to tell him the way
[1:05:33] that it is without God revealing himself
[1:05:36] you you know
[1:05:39] nothing Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:05:42] praise God Amen so here now let's go to
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:47] next slide um the six seal
[1:05:52] here he says and she sorry
[1:05:57] it says that's the reason John wept
[1:05:59] because if no one could get the book all
[1:06:02] creation everything was gone she would
[1:06:05] just simply turn back to atoms and
[1:06:08] molecules and so forth in Cosmic light
[1:06:10] and not even be creation person nothing
[1:06:13] else cuz Adam lost the rights to that
[1:06:16] book there it is he forfeited it when he
[1:06:19] listened to his wife and she listened to
[1:06:21] Satan's reasoning instead of the word of
[1:06:24] God and that's what the world that's
[1:06:25] what the world is listening to they're
[1:06:27] listening to Satan's reasoning
[1:06:30] on
[1:06:31] Consciousness the
[1:06:33] universe Source levels of understanding
[1:06:37] and they want to leave out Jesus that's
[1:06:39] all Satan's teachings I'm going to tell
[1:06:42] it the way it is the truth is what sets
[1:06:44] you free you reject the truth you reject
[1:06:49] salvation it's as simple as
[1:06:52] that Adam lost the rights to the book he
[1:06:55] forfeited it when he listened to his
[1:06:57] wife and she listened to Satan's
[1:06:58] reasoning instead of the word of God see
[1:07:00] it was forfeited then it couldn't go
[1:07:03] back into the dirty hands of Satan who
[1:07:05] tempted her out of the way so therefore
[1:07:08] it went back to its original owner like
[1:07:11] any abstract deed would do see goes
[1:07:14] right back to its original owner and
[1:07:17] that was God the Creator
[1:07:21] Elohim Source the absolute
[1:07:26] it had to go back to him because he's
[1:07:28] the one who planned it
[1:07:30] all he's the Creator he made it and he
[1:07:34] holds it and there's a price and that's
[1:07:37] Redemption because part of the plan was
[1:07:40] that there would need to be a redeemer
[1:07:42] for
[1:07:44] sin and that's why Christ is the
[1:07:48] key there is some price for Redemption
[1:07:51] and there was nobody could do it so he
[1:07:54] said made his laws his own laws of
[1:07:57] kinsman redeemer that's why Adam is the
[1:08:01] only one that could redeem
[1:08:03] Eve and Adam was
[1:08:08] God no doctrine of man no teaching of
[1:08:11] man no other Buddhist or Hinduism or
[1:08:25] own
[1:08:27] attributes if you're redeeming something
[1:08:30] it means you owned it at one time God is
[1:08:33] redeeming himself back to himself this
[1:08:36] there's a scripture where Christ is
[1:08:38] reconciling the church back to
[1:08:45] himself and so there's some price for
[1:08:48] Redemption he said made his laws his own
[1:08:51] laws of kinsman redeemer then they could
[1:08:54] could find
[1:08:56] nobody everybody was born of sex that
[1:08:59] was the original
[1:09:01] sin anything that was born of sex could
[1:09:05] not open the book could not be in the
[1:09:09] book could not listen when you open a
[1:09:12] book you're revealing
[1:09:14] something right something is in that's
[1:09:17] being
[1:09:18] revealed well if you were not in the
[1:09:20] book how are you going to be
[1:09:23] revealed you could only be in in the
[1:09:25] book if you were always a part of the
[1:09:28] book and remember we're not talking
[1:09:30] about a book get that book out of your
[1:09:35] head every man was born of sex born of
[1:09:39] after sexual desire he was in the
[1:09:41] original sin Satan and
[1:09:44] Eve there's the original sin Satan and
[1:09:47] Eve so he could not do it there is
[1:09:51] nothing in him no holy Pope PRI priest
[1:09:56] doctor of divinity whoever he might be
[1:09:59] he would he would nobody worthy and he
[1:10:03] couldn't be an angel because it had to
[1:10:05] be a Kinsman it couldn't even be an
[1:10:09] angel if God is going to redeem God then
[1:10:13] it's got to be God as the kinsman
[1:10:17] redeemer you're making yourself God no
[1:10:21] we
[1:10:22] are
[1:10:24] Eve that was was in
[1:10:26] Adam that God created in his own image
[1:10:29] in the beginning am if that's a little
[1:10:32] easier for you to Pal it then receive it
[1:10:34] that
[1:10:36] way because people will turn around and
[1:10:38] say oh this church you know the these
[1:10:41] people are thinking they're
[1:10:43] God they're going to find out that God
[1:10:45] lives in his word and God lives in the
[1:10:50] body Hallelujah then God himself become
[1:10:53] a Kinsman by taking on human flesh
[1:10:56] that's why Jesus had to come by a
[1:11:00] supernatural birth not by
[1:11:04] sex that's just common understanding and
[1:11:07] knowledge all the churches know that
[1:11:09] they're all worshiping
[1:11:11] Mary at this time of the year because
[1:11:13] she apparently is the mother of
[1:11:17] God like God can now have a mother the
[1:11:21] self-existent one no she had to be a
[1:11:26] virgin God had to show through the
[1:11:28] Spoken Word by sending an angel that
[1:11:31] that's how originally it would be done
[1:11:33] in the beginning all that Adam would
[1:11:35] have had to do when he expressed Eve was
[1:11:39] call Sons and Daughters of God out of
[1:11:42] that Dimension into this
[1:11:44] one he could just speak
[1:11:48] it and that's what he did when he sent
[1:11:51] the angel to Mary and Mary said be it
[1:11:53] unto me according to Thy
[1:11:58] word because the word said Mary you're
[1:12:00] going to bring forth a son and you're
[1:12:03] going to call his name Jesus and he is
[1:12:07] going to be the savior of all
[1:12:09] mankind and that's why John the Baptist
[1:12:12] when he saw his cousin he said Behold
[1:12:15] the Lamb of God and who took the
[1:12:19] book a
[1:12:20] lamb was able to take the
[1:12:23] book and that lamb was not another
[1:12:27] individual that could go up and take the
[1:12:29] book out of the hand of God that was
[1:12:31] sitting in the throne it was the lamb
[1:12:35] changing his disguise he was going from
[1:12:39] lamb he was going from God to the lamb
[1:12:42] coming to the Earth Emmanuel the word
[1:12:45] was made flesh and dwelt among us so
[1:12:48] that he could be a
[1:12:50] sacrifice hallelujah praise God through
[1:12:52] the Virgin birth taking on flesh through
[1:12:56] the Virgin birth it had to be a virgin
[1:12:58] birth glory and he shed his blood that
[1:13:02] wasn't the blood of a Jew it wasn't the
[1:13:04] blood of a gentile it was the blood of
[1:13:06] God see the Bible said we're saved
[1:13:09] through the blood of God which was Jesus
[1:13:12] Christ and you want to leave him out
[1:13:15] good
[1:13:16] luck good luck
[1:13:19] hallelujah praise God
[1:13:22] Amen so let's just move along here here
[1:13:25] we're going to wind this right down
[1:13:26] another 5 minutes we're done amen we
[1:13:29] could you know you could just go on all

[1:13:35] Heavenly places I'm rejoicing I could

[1:14:39] Saints all the political systems are
[1:14:41] fall even our political system right
[1:14:43] here in Canada is completely falling
[1:14:47] apart and there're supposed to be the
[1:14:49] ones ruling the
[1:14:51] world but the scripture said very
[1:14:54] clearly that they would all fall
[1:14:58] apart there will be no successful
[1:15:01] government until Jesus Christ sets up
[1:15:03] the millennial Reign right here on this
[1:15:06] Earth for 10,000 years of peace and he's
[1:15:09] going to have some real
[1:15:12] Governors glory to God hallelujah so
[1:15:15] here let's go to the next slide I just
[1:15:18] want you to notice these are things that
[1:15:19] I I picked up I was reading I thought oh
[1:15:21] look at this comparison on Revelations 5
[1:15:24] 1 11 and Revelations 10 1-11 notice that
[1:15:29] here in Revelations 5: 1-7 they are
[1:15:32] crying for someone to take the book and
[1:15:35] in Revelations 10
[1:15:38] 1-7 the mighty Angel has the book and
[1:15:41] it's now open then in Revelations
[1:15:44] 58-11 the lamb takes the book and in
[1:15:47] Revelations 108 to1 John a type of the
[1:15:51] Bride is now asked to take the book
[1:15:55] so here it is in in in Revelations 5 and
[1:15:58] in Revelations 10 you've got a parallel
[1:16:01] running again God showing he's the same
[1:16:04] yesterday today and
[1:16:06] forever and there's one that's got to
[1:16:08] take the book
[1:16:10] now Revelations
[1:16:12] 108-111 he's telling John a type of the
[1:16:14] Bride which is you and me to take the
[1:16:18] book in other words to take and believe
[1:16:23] the word that's been revealed to you
[1:16:27] that's been given to you to unveil this
[1:16:30] great mystery of God which is God it's
[1:16:34] the the great mystery listen Christ The
[1:16:36] Mystery of God it's always been
[1:16:39] God unveiling
[1:16:41] himself in his identification with
[1:16:45] man the whole Bible all the way from
[1:16:49] Genesis right up until the end of the
[1:16:51] book of Revelation where he says and the
[1:16:53] spirit and the bre died say come you see
[1:16:57] it's always been God in relation to man
[1:17:03] God in relation to be in man to be to be
[1:17:09] possessing man God look God the the Old
[1:17:12] Testament was the Lord above us then
[1:17:16] Christ comes and he's God with
[1:17:20] us as Brethren but today it's God in us
[1:17:26] it's God being restored back everything
[1:17:28] that that that he did in the beginning
[1:17:30] had to be reversed that's why the first
[1:17:33] Adam fell but the second Adam which is
[1:17:37] Christ doesn't fall amen it's the it's
[1:17:41] it's the
[1:17:42] restoration of the true church bringing
[1:17:44] her back into her rightful position and
[1:17:48] so here
[1:17:49] now this book that the bride is now
[1:17:53] taking she's told to take the book eat
[1:17:56] it so that she can
[1:17:59] prophesy because Faith cometh by hearing
[1:18:02] the word and if you're a carrier of the
[1:18:05] word everything you do everything you
[1:18:07] say your life is an expression of God's
[1:18:12] word yeah there's human mixed up with it
[1:18:15] that's why you know your carnal mind is
[1:18:18] at emnity that's why you'll struggle
[1:18:20] even to get to church because your your
[1:18:22] your your your carnality will will will
[1:18:25] put all kinds of obstacles in your way
[1:18:28] and if you're still living too much in
[1:18:29] the flesh you get you get pulled by
[1:18:32] those things that are in the
[1:18:33] flesh that's just nature it's human
[1:18:36] nature they call it but that's why your
[1:18:39] greatest enemy is this thing right here
[1:18:42] you got to overcome it you got to eat
[1:18:45] the book you got to you got to you got
[1:18:47] to allow the word to be uh uh completely
[1:18:51] ingested into your entire life that's
[1:18:54] why David he would put up sayings all
[1:18:56] around him the Lord the Lord is a lamp
[1:18:59] unto my feet blessed is the man whom the
[1:19:02] Lord does not impute iniquity because I
[1:19:04] make mistakes all the time but here the
[1:19:06] Lord tells me I'm Justified I'm I'm as
[1:19:09] though I never done it in the first
[1:19:10] you've got to live in the word while
[1:19:14] you're living in this life you're not
[1:19:17] going to I'm not talking about being
[1:19:19] super religious where you're anytime you
[1:19:21] go out and you see people praise God I
[1:19:23] am a son of God Hallelujah glory to God
[1:19:26] you need to receive the word of God
[1:19:28] you're going to hell if you don't that's
[1:19:30] not what it's
[1:19:32] about that's not what Jesus did he lived
[1:19:35] the word he allowed the word to live
[1:19:37] through him it's an unconscious living
[1:19:40] amen glory to God and so when the word
[1:19:44] was was was uh when the when the seals
[1:19:47] were open those
[1:19:48] Thunders they were re they they they
[1:19:51] were re they revealed something but John
[1:19:54] wasn't allow to write it because it's
[1:19:56] now being placed in the book in The
[1:20:00] Bride in order for it to be revealed
[1:20:04] now those Thunders are thundering right
[1:20:08] now right here this evening those
[1:20:11] Thunders are being
[1:20:13] unveiled because we are the book we hold
[1:20:15] the book we've taken the book we've
[1:20:18] allowed the word of God to to to fully
[1:20:20] immerse our lives and our lives are
[1:20:22] starting to manifest the word and and
[1:20:25] and and supernaturally things will
[1:20:27] happen around your life you're not going
[1:20:29] to need to try to put anything on this
[1:20:31] is not about oh I got to read the Bible
[1:20:34] I got to read from morning till night I
[1:20:36] can't go to work I got to read the word
[1:20:37] no no you got to go to
[1:20:39] work it's it's a
[1:20:42] revelation you've come to recognize who
[1:20:44] you are and now because of that all of a
[1:20:47] sudden we read those quotes where you
[1:20:50] know and I and I and I've got the quotes
[1:20:51] here but I I I don't want to go over
[1:20:53] them again but you know I'll just go to
[1:20:56] you know maybe let's just finish up with
[1:20:58] this quote okay I read it last time but
[1:21:00] this will become a little more real to
[1:21:02] you to see that you're not putting
[1:21:04] something on he's doing it he's in you
[1:21:08] he's he's going to do these things don't
[1:21:10] don't worry about the next bill yes it's
[1:21:14] going to come but trust him do what you
[1:21:18] know you're supposed to do pay your
[1:21:20] tithes give your offerings the Lord will
[1:21:23] do the rest amen he will supernaturally
[1:21:26] work into all of those situations if you
[1:21:29] really do
[1:21:30] believe a lot of people say they believe
[1:21:33] but they don't I can tell by their
[1:21:36] testimony negative negative
[1:21:39] negative because they're they don't
[1:21:42] really believe that God can do it and so
[1:21:45] they want to put their interpretation on
[1:21:47] it and it's negative and every time you
[1:21:50] speak something against the word of God
[1:21:52] you're pushing it away from you instead
[1:21:54] of allowing it to pour into your
[1:21:58] life
[1:22:00] Hallelujah let's read it here next
[1:22:03] slide as she is part of the groom true
[1:22:06] to him in every Point waiting the

[1:24:00] in another denomination with 10,000
[1:24:03] members in that church but if God wants
[1:24:05] to reveal himself to that one she'll
[1:24:07] come
[1:24:08] out that's why the scripture says come

[1:27:36] were part of that Spirit man Adam in the
[1:27:41] beginning only then are you truly
[1:27:43] Justified and you will not allow sin and
