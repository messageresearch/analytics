[0:53] uh we are here to seriously
[0:57] uh enter into our study of the word of
[1:00] god

[1:45] revelation chapter 3
[1:49] reading a part of verse 1.
[1:53] revelation 3
[1:55] and unto the angel of the church in
[2:00] sardis
[2:01] right
[2:03] this thing saith he
[2:05] that hat the seven spirits of god
[2:10] and the seven stars
[2:13] next
[2:14] we shall read from
[2:16] the gospel of mark
[2:20] chapter 4
[2:23] verses 26
[2:27] to 29
[2:31] and he said
[2:34] so is the kingdom of god
[2:37] as if a man
[2:39] should cast seed
[2:42] into the ground
[2:44] and should sleep
[2:46] and rise night and day
[2:50] and the seed would spring up
[2:54] and spring and grow up
[2:56] he knew it not how
[3:00] for the earth bringeth forth fruit of
[3:03] herself
[3:04] first
[3:05] the blade
[3:08] then
[3:09] the air
[3:12] after that
[3:13] the full corn
[3:16] is in the air
[3:19] but when the fruit is brought forth
[3:23] immediately
[3:25] he put it in the sickle
[3:28] because the harvest is come
[3:32] god bless us together gracious heavenly
[3:34] father
[3:36] the reading of thy word bringeth light
[3:41] their reading of your word gives us life
[3:45] and we give to you the glory and the
[3:48] honor
[3:49] and the praise
[3:51] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[3:56] amen
[3:59] here we are this evening
[4:02] studying the fifth church age
[4:06] the church age of sardis
[4:10] of whom
[4:12] martin luther
[4:16] is the messenger to this age
[4:20] of sardis
[4:23] now this fifth church age lasted from 15
[4:27] 1520
[4:28] to 1750
[4:30] which is to say
[4:32] approximately
[4:34] 230
[4:37] years
[4:39] i repeat
[4:40] and it is called
[4:43] the age
[4:44] of reformation
[4:48] now martin luther
[4:50] is one of the
[4:53] uh easier to recognize
[4:56] uh messengers of the church ages
[5:01] he is so well known and so easily
[5:04] recognized
[5:08] martin
[5:09] luther
[5:11] was
[5:12] a brilliant scholar
[5:15] of great
[5:16] disposition
[5:19] his father hence
[5:21] uh was
[5:23] able to
[5:24] send him to school
[5:27] and to which was not easy in those days
[5:31] and
[5:33] martin luther wanted to be a lawyer
[5:38] and as a lawyer as a student
[5:42] he
[5:42] was of a
[5:44] quiet
[5:46] and gentle disposition
[5:50] and studying as he was
[5:54] we found out that his
[5:57] entire attitude and outlook changed
[6:02] for he had a very close friend
[6:05] available
[6:20] in itself
[6:23] caused martin luther
[6:25] to begin to get serious
[6:28] about spiritual things
[6:32] and
[6:32] particularly
[6:34] about the spiritual condition of his own
[6:39] life
[6:42] may i pause here to say
[6:46] that
[6:46] sometimes that is what it takes
[6:51] god
[6:52] will allow
[6:53] fiery trials
[6:56] and tests
[6:58] to come into our lives
[7:00] a pain grief
[7:03] and loss
[7:06] so that we can go from the
[7:09] realm of drifting along
[7:12] and fancy full imaginations
[7:16] to break into the
[7:18] area
[7:20] of reality
[7:23] we live the realm of fantasy and just
[7:26] imagination
[7:28] and we come to the reality of the moment
[7:32] and of the hour
[7:34] and many times god will allow us
[7:37] to suffer pain
[7:40] and tragedy
[7:42] the loss of a friend
[7:44] the loss of a loved one
[7:47] and so
[7:48] we
[7:49] wake up
[7:50] from
[7:52] our situation of malays
[7:55] and to begin to you see because that's
[7:59] god's intention
[8:01] he wants us to come us to come back to
[8:04] him
[8:05] he wants us to be able to seek him
[8:09] he wants us to be able to search our
[8:12] hearts
[8:13] he wants us to become sincere and
[8:17] serious with him so that he may bless us
[8:21] deal with us lead us and guide us
[8:24] into his perfect will
[8:27] for his namesake
[8:30] now
[8:32] martin luther entered the
[8:35] augustinian
[8:36] convent
[8:39] at erfurt in 1505
[8:43] and there he studied philosophy
[8:47] and along with philosophy
[8:50] he studied the word of god
[8:54] and there
[8:56] as he delved into the word of god
[8:58] we understand during this period of his
[9:01] life
[9:03] he lived a life of severe
[9:07] penance
[9:10] all the outward works
[9:14] that martin luther did
[9:16] all the penances
[9:19] could not
[9:21] give him
[9:22] peace within his heart
[9:25] none could satisfy
[9:28] his hunger
[9:29] and his thirst for the true and the
[9:32] living god
[9:36] he himself said
[9:38] i tormented myself
[9:41] unto death
[9:44] to make peace with god
[9:47] but i i i was in darkness
[9:51] and i found it not
[9:54] now the viker general of his order
[9:58] helped him to gain
[10:01] the insight
[10:02] that his salvation
[10:05] did not lay in the confines of the works
[10:10] of which
[10:12] he
[10:13] did or was
[10:15] doing
[10:17] but
[10:19] he would have salvation would have to be
[10:22] an inward work of god
[10:25] rather than by
[10:27] a ritual
[10:30] with this encouragement of course
[10:33] from his great uh mentor of that time
[10:38] martin luther began to further
[10:41] seek god
[10:42] with all
[10:44] of his heart
[10:47] and he became a priest
[10:51] and
[10:52] as yet of course he was not saved he was
[10:55] still seeking
[10:57] but he became
[10:58] a priest
[11:01] an avid
[11:03] deep student
[11:05] of the word of god
[11:08] and of the
[11:10] he also studied the great theological
[11:13] works and writings
[11:16] of many who had gone
[11:18] before
[11:21] after a while
[11:24] he built such
[11:26] a reputation of knowledge
[11:29] and of wisdom
[11:32] that he was sought out
[11:34] as a teacher
[11:37] and as a preacher
[11:39] because of this depth
[11:42] of knowledge
[11:44] and sincerity
[11:46] that he had
[11:48] with god and in the word of god
[11:53] to fulfill
[11:55] a vow that he had made
[12:00] luther went to rome
[12:04] and there
[12:06] in rome
[12:08] he saw the moral mess
[12:12] he saw the futility
[12:16] of the
[12:17] church's imposition
[12:20] of works
[12:22] and penance
[12:26] and
[12:27] they could not
[12:30] bring to him salvation
[12:33] and so the word of god struck home to
[12:36] his heart
[12:38] luther himself
[12:41] described the
[12:43] church
[12:44] as a harlot
[12:46] to the word of god
[12:49] the
[12:51] live by faith
[12:54] god
[12:55] revealed this to him
[12:57] this was the great
[13:00] foundational
[13:02] revelation
[13:05] upon which luther
[13:07] would rest the
[13:10] rest of the building of his life
[13:13] under this legacy
[13:15] upon this rock-solid foundation
[13:18] that the just
[13:20] shall live
[13:22] by faith
[13:24] faith of course we
[13:26] recognize
[13:28] as revealed to us by god's servant a
[13:31] prophet
[13:33] that faith
[13:34] in actual fact is not just believing
[13:38] for you must
[13:40] know
[13:41] what you are believing
[13:43] true faith
[13:45] is a revelation
[13:48] and when something is revealed to you
[13:51] you see it in the word
[13:53] then
[13:55] you can with positivity
[13:58] rest your face
[14:00] on that foundation of revelation
[14:04] which of course
[14:05] is by grace
[14:08] for his grace
[14:10] is greater than our faith
[14:13] may we understand this
[14:15] and may the holy spirit
[14:18] make his word distilled
[14:21] to us
[14:23] until
[14:24] we can clearly see
[14:26] from the word of god
[14:29] faith true faith
[14:31] is a revelation
[14:33] so when luther
[14:36] said that just
[14:38] shall live
[14:40] by faith
[14:42] he was
[14:43] saying that just shall live
[14:46] by
[14:47] revelation
[14:49] not by dead letters
[14:52] but by the living
[14:54] revealing revealed word of god
[14:58] amen
[15:01] and so
[15:03] on his return
[15:05] back to his home
[15:09] scriptures begin to flood his mind
[15:14] the word of god began to
[15:16] wash through
[15:18] his soul
[15:21] and
[15:22] luther
[15:23] was set free from his
[15:27] load of sin
[15:30] all the driftwood
[15:32] all the
[15:34] rotten branches of sin
[15:38] were swept away
[15:40] by the crimson tide of the blood of
[15:42] christ
[15:44] and he
[15:45] was washed
[15:47] by the
[15:48] saving blood word of god
[15:52] and brought into a living
[15:55] personal
[15:57] private relationship
[15:59] with the living god
[16:02] born again
[16:04] born into
[16:05] not the church but born into the kingdom
[16:09] of god
[16:10] soon after this
[16:14] he was elevated
[16:16] to the position
[16:18] of doctor of divinity
[16:22] and he was commissioned
[16:25] to devote his whole life
[16:29] to study
[16:30] and to faithfully
[16:33] expound
[16:34] and defend
[16:37] the scriptures the word of god
[16:40] hallelujah
[16:42] and this of course he did
[16:46] and he did it with great effect
[16:49] on his heart
[16:51] on the hearts of those that were around
[16:54] him
[16:55] were greatly moved
[16:59] by their revelation of truth
[17:02] that was flowing through his life
[17:05] and the sincerity
[17:07] that exuded from him
[17:12] and so
[17:14] with his preaching and teaching
[17:18] of this revealed word of god
[17:21] this word brought him
[17:24] into conflict with the church
[17:28] of that time
[17:31] it brought him specifically
[17:34] in confrontation
[17:36] with the abuses
[17:40] of
[17:41] of the church
[17:44] the abuses of the creeds
[17:48] and of the doctr uh
[17:50] of the doctrines
[17:53] of the bulls
[17:56] it brought him into
[17:59] conflict with these things
[18:03] then of course
[18:07] pope leo the tenth
[18:12] became pope
[18:14] and one john tetzel
[18:18] another priest
[18:20] theologian
[18:21] and preacher
[18:25] was commissioned by the pope at that
[18:28] time
[18:30] to sell indulgences
[18:33] of course in passing may i say
[18:36] the bible tells us clearly
[18:39] the gospel
[18:41] is without money and without price
[18:46] not only the catholics
[18:48] but her daughters
[18:51] has this
[18:52] same
[18:53] spirit of harlotry
[18:56] hunger and thirst
[18:58] for money
[18:59] and for wealth
[19:02] until
[19:04] it's gone right through protestantism
[19:08] until it's literally become acceptable
[19:12] for them to be
[19:14] begging and milking
[19:16] the
[19:17] people
[19:19] in their care for monies
[19:22] or they're selling some books or selling
[19:25] some tapes or selling some form of
[19:28] knowledge
[19:30] selling miracle wallets
[19:33] giving they'll even tell you oh we're
[19:35] going to give you holy water
[19:39] and of course you can give an
[19:41] offering
[19:43] they'll even try to make it some
[19:45] spiritual
[19:47] that you can saw a seed
[19:50] and you will become wealthy if you saw a
[19:54] seed and this seed sowing doctrine
[19:59] contrary to god's word
[20:02] by which
[20:04] this harlot spirit
[20:06] that has penetrated all the way
[20:09] from rome
[20:10] right into its remnant
[20:13] of
[20:14] protestant daughters and denominations
[20:18] where money has become their principal
[20:22] goal
[20:25] and of course
[20:26] tetzel
[20:28] was selling these
[20:31] uh indulgences
[20:34] which is to say
[20:35] that pope has the power to absolve you
[20:39] from sin
[20:41] uh and to free you and to forgive you of
[20:44] your sins so you may bypass hell
[20:49] my friends
[20:51] i uh heard john tetzel
[20:55] some time ago on a tape saying
[20:58] as soon as you place
[21:01] the money
[21:03] into the
[21:04] this offering bag
[21:07] as soon as you put the money in
[21:11] your mother's soul
[21:13] which you just paid for will fly up from
[21:16] hell into heaven in the presence of god
[21:19] these worthy lies
[21:23] these were the teachings
[21:25] that were propounded
[21:28] at that time
[21:30] until this day in our modern times
[21:34] of people claiming to be intelligent
[21:38] and yet accepting the teachings of
[21:41] indulgences
[21:43] which is absolutely contrary to the word
[21:46] of god and in fact in opposition
[21:50] and in disobedience to the word of our
[21:55] god
[21:56] of course luther had no choice
[22:00] but to rise up against these
[22:03] unscriptural
[22:05] doctrines and teachings
[22:08] and so with the
[22:10] power of the holy spirit behind him
[22:14] luther began to sunder
[22:16] from the pulpit
[22:18] the fullness
[22:20] of the word of god amen
[22:23] and not only did he send that from the
[22:25] pulpit the preaching
[22:27] he
[22:28] wrought his 95 cc's his 95 thoughts
[22:34] amen of why that was contrary
[22:39] and he even
[22:42] said why
[22:44] doesn't the pope who has untold wealth
[22:48] why doesn't he build his basilica with
[22:51] his own money
[22:52] rather than uh
[22:54] taking the money from the poor
[22:57] who needs it more than that
[23:00] and so
[23:01] he nailed
[23:04] his 95 thesis
[23:07] on the
[23:10] church door
[23:11] of the castle church
[23:14] october the 31st
[23:18] 1517.
[23:21] my friends
[23:23] in a short while
[23:25] germany was ablaze
[23:28] with the
[23:29] spirit of this
[23:31] reformation
[23:33] this revelation
[23:36] that was flowing out
[23:38] of the
[23:39] spirit of martin luther
[23:42] who was given this revelation from god
[23:47] the rev reformation
[23:51] was now on
[23:54] the revival
[23:56] of god's move
[23:58] of the church
[24:00] was now on
[24:02] their resurrection
[24:05] of the true church
[24:08] which was entombed
[24:11] during
[24:12] the
[24:13] time
[24:14] of the ages
[24:17] was now
[24:18] to experience
[24:20] a resurrection
[24:24] of course mark chapter 4
[24:27] verses 26 to 29
[24:30] jesus
[24:32] literally
[24:33] spoke of this ahead of time
[24:36] when he spoke
[24:38] of a man planting a seed
[24:41] type of the word of god
[24:44] and then what comes up
[24:46] first comes up the sprout or the blade
[24:51] and then comes the air
[24:53] and then comes the full corn
[24:56] amen
[24:58] he was giving
[25:00] a a flow
[25:02] of what was going to happen
[25:05] to the church of god
[25:06] down through the ages
[25:09] a quick
[25:11] overview is loader came forth as the
[25:16] blade
[25:18] here comes my friend
[25:21] wesley
[25:22] as the ear
[25:25] the
[25:26] pentecostals came on the scene
[25:30] and here was the
[25:31] corn
[25:33] with the shock around it
[25:35] and now a message has come
[25:39] and with the heat of the son
[25:43] it has brought about
[25:46] a spiritual separation
[25:49] when the
[25:51] believers of the message of malachi 4
[25:54] 5 were expelled expunged
[25:59] excommunicated or put out
[26:03] of the confines of denomination
[26:07] for the seed shall not be air with the
[26:10] shock
[26:12] and so god
[26:14] begins to gather his own
[26:17] in what we call the message of this hour
[26:21] calling to his
[26:22] own the great
[26:26] one has said
[26:28] it's harvest time
[26:31] it's harvest time
[26:34] the savior is crawling and the grain is
[26:36] falling oh do not wait my friends
[26:40] it'll be too late
[26:42] it's already later than you think
[26:47] come now
[26:48] while there is yet time to
[26:50] come and receive christ within your
[26:53] hearts
[26:56] here we find
[26:59] luther began to protest against
[27:02] the
[27:03] catholic church
[27:06] of course he was not the only one
[27:09] before him
[27:10] there was uh john huss
[27:16] and luther himself inspired others
[27:20] there was zwingli
[27:23] and others
[27:24] that came forth
[27:27] at that particular time of course calvin
[27:30] john calvin followed up
[27:33] and was an offshoot of that and from
[27:36] there
[27:37] came forth
[27:38] myriads of these denominations
[27:42] baptist anabaptists
[27:45] reformed church so on so they began to
[27:48] go forth in that way
[27:53] and in any case
[27:56] god's time was ripe for a move
[28:00] god's time was ripe
[28:03] for a resurrection
[28:06] of the church
[28:08] amen
[28:10] and so
[28:12] this was the beginning
[28:14] of the restoration
[28:17] of the church
[28:19] until the church will be moved
[28:22] stage by stage
[28:24] until it comes to the hour of the
[28:27] outpouring of the holy spirit the
[28:30] refreshing reigns
[28:32] of the spirit of god
[28:34] to come upon the church
[28:36] at a much later date
[28:40] now martin luther's character
[28:43] was one of such
[28:45] that we know that he was a sensitive
[28:49] spirit-filled christian
[28:52] he was identified
[28:55] as a man
[28:56] of the word of god
[28:59] for that hour
[29:01] and he had a profound
[29:03] passion
[29:04] and desire
[29:06] to study the word
[29:09] constantly
[29:10] and to also he wanted not to study and
[29:14] keep it to himself but he wanted to make
[29:16] it available to all
[29:19] of his fellow men that they may live by
[29:23] it also
[29:26] he took upon himself the work of
[29:28] translating
[29:31] the new testament
[29:33] now i will not get into the fact that at
[29:35] that time the church would not permit
[29:39] the translation
[29:42] uh for the people the common people to
[29:45] read the scriptures
[29:47] or to know what the bible says
[29:50] for them the people will be able to
[29:52] recognize
[29:54] that their teachings doctrines
[29:57] and uh things that they professed
[30:00] were contrary
[30:02] to the very word of god
[30:05] but luther what wanted this to be known
[30:09] and so he began
[30:11] a translation
[30:13] of the new testament
[30:16] at the same time
[30:19] the
[30:20] words of printing
[30:23] england germany tyndale
[30:26] it came until they started my friends to
[30:30] distribute the word of god
[30:34] at that time
[30:37] it was hard work it was laborious work
[30:42] and he did it himself
[30:44] it is said he corrected some passages
[30:47] 20 times
[30:50] amen
[30:52] and he gathered around him
[30:55] a group of hebrew scholars
[30:58] some of them were jews
[31:01] that he might give a consistent
[31:04] translation
[31:06] of
[31:07] the scriptures
[31:09] of course this monumental work of looter
[31:14] is still
[31:16] the work
[31:18] that has touched the heart
[31:21] of the german people
[31:23] to this very day
[31:26] they look to one of their
[31:29] greatest
[31:30] heroes martin
[31:33] luther
[31:34] the messenger
[31:36] to the reformation
[31:40] he was a mighty preacher
[31:43] he was a great teacher of the word of
[31:47] god
[31:50] and he constantly insisted
[31:53] that the only criteria and standard we
[31:57] need
[31:59] is the word of god you know of his great
[32:03] statement
[32:04] amen
[32:05] i cannot help it my conscience
[32:09] is a prisoner to the word of god here i
[32:13] stand so help me god may every one of us
[32:18] be
[32:18] become prisoners to the word of god
[32:22] that we will not swerve to the left hand
[32:24] nor to the right
[32:26] but keep our eyes on jesus the word
[32:29] and walk in obedience
[32:32] and in surrender
[32:33] to the word of god
[32:38] luther was absolutely
[32:40] against works
[32:42] being the means of our salvation
[32:47] and so
[32:50] he
[32:54] was against
[32:55] their teaching
[32:57] that baptism
[33:01] was the means of regeneration
[33:04] we are not saved
[33:07] by being baptized
[33:09] you're baptized
[33:12] because
[33:13] you previously repented
[33:16] and was saved
[33:19] and this is now just a public show
[33:24] to the inward act of god
[33:28] that took place in your life
[33:30] that you want it to be known
[33:33] and so you are baptized but we are not
[33:36] saved by baptism
[33:39] and so luther stood against that kind of
[33:43] teaching
[33:44] he also taught
[33:47] that jesus christ is the one and only
[33:51] mediator
[33:53] and does not need the assistance
[33:56] of any man
[33:59] regardless of how important he thinks of
[34:01] himself
[34:05] jesus christ is the only mediator
[34:09] between god and man
[34:14] hallelujah
[34:16] it is said he was a man given to much
[34:18] prayer
[34:22] and you know he learned something we all
[34:24] should learn
[34:26] the more work we have to do
[34:29] the more tests
[34:31] and trials we have to face
[34:34] the more time and prayer we ought to
[34:37] spend with god
[34:39] all my friends said the servant of god
[34:43] prayer prayer will bring god's blessings
[34:46] down
[34:47] then if we know prayer will bring god's
[34:50] blessing down then why don't we just
[34:53] pray pray pray pray
[34:57] may god's blessing come upon us
[35:00] as we pray and seek his face
[35:04] as never before
[35:06] glory be to god hallelujah
[35:10] now
[35:11] luther also knew
[35:14] what it was the battle against the devil
[35:17] he was such a man of prayer that
[35:19] sometimes
[35:20] the devil would appear to him
[35:23] visibly
[35:25] at one time luther got so mad at the
[35:28] devil in his study that he grabbed the
[35:31] inkwell and flung it
[35:34] at the devil
[35:36] and told him get the hands get out of
[35:39] this room and chase him away in the name
[35:43] of the living god hallelujah
[35:47] another time
[35:50] the devil comes again
[35:52] in a visible form
[35:54] but he came as two fanatics
[35:58] that claim they were following
[36:01] luther's message
[36:03] but yet
[36:05] there were actually
[36:07] driving people away from that message
[36:11] while there were outwardly claiming to
[36:14] be with it
[36:16] many are doing the same today in this
[36:18] message of this ministry of this prophet
[36:22] of this age and hour
[36:25] while claiming to be with the message
[36:27] are actually committing acts doing
[36:30] things saying things carrying out things
[36:33] that are contrary to the word of god
[36:36] and driving folks away
[36:38] from the message of this hour
[36:42] oh my friends
[36:44] they tried to induce him to banish
[36:46] priests and to banish bibles
[36:49] see they tied the two things together
[36:51] banishing the priests and banishing the
[36:53] bible and luther of course discerned
[36:56] their spirit rebuked them and chased
[36:59] them away from him
[37:01] it was said that luther was a prophet
[37:04] but we know he was not really a prophet
[37:07] because he did not have the gifts of a
[37:10] prophet
[37:12] but listen what dr sir says
[37:16] in his history
[37:18] vol 3
[37:20] luther was
[37:22] an evangelist
[37:25] a speaker
[37:26] in tongues
[37:29] interpreter
[37:32] in one person
[37:34] he was endowed with all nine gifts of
[37:38] the spirit
[37:41] now
[37:42] how are the mighty fallen
[37:45] the mighty
[37:46] lutheran church
[37:48] that was once filled
[37:51] with the message
[37:53] and the power of the holy spirit
[37:55] of this messenger of this fifth church
[37:59] age
[38:00] how how are the mighty fallen
[38:04] until now
[38:06] there would not
[38:08] they want nothing to do
[38:10] with the power of the holy spirit
[38:13] they want nothing to do with speaking in
[38:15] towns
[38:17] want nothing to do with the nine
[38:20] supernatural
[38:22] operations
[38:24] and diversity
[38:25] of the gifts of the holy ghost
[38:28] which is supposed to be in a genuine new
[38:32] testament church
[38:34] may oh may if martin luther what were to
[38:39] be here and see what has happened to the
[38:42] church that's bearing his name he would
[38:44] groan in his spirit oh my friends i
[38:48] believe he'll take an inkwell and
[38:51] fling it again at lots of the leaders
[38:54] for they have
[38:56] moved off of their foundations they have
[38:59] slipped off of the word of god back to
[39:02] the word your litterans back to the word
[39:05] you're genuine christians and believers
[39:09] back to your original faith that the
[39:11] holy spirit may lead you and guide you
[39:14] that you may walk into all truth for the
[39:17] glory and praise
[39:19] of his name
[39:22] i want you to know my friends
[39:26] that god that stirred in his heart
[39:30] the holy ghost
[39:32] and the green shoots of reformation
[39:36] was springing up
[39:37] under his leadership
[39:40] amen and
[39:42] the truth of god
[39:45] began to be restored back into the
[39:48] church of god as it was known
[39:52] on the death pentecost
[39:54] the doctrine of justification
[39:58] salvation by grace alone hallelujah
[40:02] apart from works
[40:05] amen
[40:06] amen hallelujah
[40:10] i tell you this man
[40:13] this messenger
[40:15] this servant of the living god
[40:18] will always be recognized and known
[40:21] as the instrument in the hand of god
[40:26] who god used to revive
[40:29] the truth of his word
[40:31] in that age
[40:33] of course he was the fifth messenger
[40:37] and his message was
[40:39] they just
[40:41] shall live by faith
[40:44] amen hallelujah
[40:47] well
[40:48] we
[40:49] are not only just to be born again and
[40:51] sit there
[40:52] but to move from faith to faith to faith
[40:56] just as much as the lutherans took the
[40:59] just shall live by faith and they are
[41:01] sacked there and they're still sitting
[41:04] there
[41:05] but the church of god is marching on for
[41:09] it move from just shall live by faith to
[41:13] wesley saying look we don't only need
[41:15] faith we got to have holiness we got to
[41:17] live holy and so holiness came and then
[41:21] they are sacked by holiness
[41:23] sanctification pentecostals came along
[41:26] we don't only have to be saved and to
[41:28] live a holy life we must be filled with
[41:31] the holy spirit and so my friends god's
[41:35] truth
[41:36] is marching on and it has marched on to
[41:40] this day
[41:42] of the last star
[41:44] the seventh star messenger that god sent
[41:48] upon the earth for his glory
[41:52] amen
[41:54] the spirit of the reformation
[41:57] martin luther used
[42:00] as the reform well
[42:04] and we take god for him
[42:07] amen
[42:10] he was gentle
[42:12] he was fearless
[42:14] he was patient
[42:16] and constantly waiting on god
[42:19] to work out any problems that he had
[42:22] we ought to do the same
[42:25] be patient
[42:26] fearless
[42:28] trusting in god that god will work out
[42:32] all of your problems
[42:35] but then
[42:36] he himself began to be seduced
[42:40] for as his movement grew
[42:42] and that's the numbers
[42:45] exponentially
[42:47] uh multiplied
[42:51] multitudes came under his banner
[42:55] and then
[42:56] we find out
[42:58] that his mind became seduced
[43:01] by
[43:02] this
[43:04] power
[43:05] of numbers that followed him and so are
[43:07] many today seduced by numbers
[43:11] seduced by the followers they have
[43:15] amen
[43:17] and it caused them to drift away
[43:20] from the word of god
[43:22] right within the confines of the message
[43:25] of malachi 4 5
[43:28] i will restore saith the lord
[43:31] many
[43:32] of these
[43:34] worms
[43:37] that are
[43:39] destroying
[43:41] the foundation
[43:43] of this great tree of truth
[43:48] and they're being seduced
[43:50] by numbers
[43:52] thinking that numbers gives them
[43:53] credibility
[43:56] numbers gives them believability
[44:00] they believe
[44:02] numbers
[44:03] brings them fame
[44:07] not only that some
[44:11] have got their eyes
[44:13] on using this message
[44:16] for the means
[44:17] of profit or profiting by it and from it
[44:22] while they are following it
[44:26] amen
[44:28] many
[44:29] walking in the message
[44:32] with their aim
[44:33] on personal
[44:35] recognition
[44:37] the desire to
[44:38] flex their muscles puff their feathers
[44:42] fluff their feathers like a pheasant or
[44:45] or a peacock
[44:47] wanting personal
[44:49] recognition
[44:51] oh my friends
[44:54] others
[44:55] in this message
[44:57] are even being persuaded
[45:01] to political motivations
[45:04] may god help us everyone
[45:08] my friends
[45:11] luther was
[45:13] in such an inspiration
[45:16] that he wanted to break the yoke
[45:19] of the pope
[45:21] break it
[45:23] and so
[45:25] many of them used luther for their own
[45:28] hands
[45:29] because they did not want to send monies
[45:32] to rome
[45:34] and so a lot of fanatics
[45:37] and a lot of followers rose up
[45:40] many times messengers have more trouble
[45:42] with their so-called followers than they
[45:46] do with those that are on the outside
[45:50] amen
[45:52] and soon
[45:53] luto was dragged
[45:56] into politics
[45:59] and political affairs and political
[46:02] decisions
[46:03] that actually laid outside of the realm
[46:09] of his teaching
[46:12] we find out
[46:15] spiritual
[46:17] scarecrows
[46:19] a lot of these fanatics it's the devil
[46:22] raised up fanatics back then with luther
[46:26] and now in this message
[46:28] a spiritual scarecrows
[46:31] to scare away
[46:33] the people from this true message of
[46:36] this day and this hour
[46:38] oh i want nothing to do with that
[46:40] because i heard this this this this oh i
[46:43] don't want to mess with them with that
[46:45] message because you know everything
[46:47] isn't perfect
[46:49] they're not organized they're not
[46:51] systematic they're not educated they're
[46:54] not money they're not culture they're
[46:56] not this oh you listen if you are
[46:59] looking for faults you can find a
[47:02] million things that will drive you away
[47:05] completely from this word of god
[47:09] and so we find friends
[47:13] that luther
[47:15] got out of his
[47:16] spiritual position
[47:20] when you get yourself out of your
[47:22] spiritual position
[47:24] then you find you start making worldly
[47:26] decisions
[47:28] you start making political decisions
[47:31] you started making money decisions you
[47:34] started making decisions that are normal
[47:37] in the natural world but contrary to the
[47:41] word of god
[47:42] my friends here it is he got out of his
[47:45] position find himself mediating between
[47:48] the lords and the
[47:50] peasants
[47:51] and
[47:52] made a lot of wrong decisions
[47:55] when it came to that uprising between
[47:58] lords and peasants and literally he
[48:01] caused thousands upon thousands to be
[48:04] killed in a popular uprising at that
[48:07] particular time
[48:09] but because he was entangled in a church
[48:13] and state
[48:15] gospel
[48:16] and so he rip the whirlwind amen
[48:21] but for all that
[48:24] luther martin luther
[48:27] was the fifth messenger
[48:29] of the fifth church age
[48:32] the age
[48:33] of sardis
[48:35] better known
[48:37] as the age
[48:39] of reformation
[48:41] now his intentions
[48:44] were wrong
[48:47] but let us say this
[48:50] not that his intentions were wrong but
[48:52] his judgment failed him at that time
[48:56] because he was out of his
[48:58] position
[49:00] now truly my friends
[49:03] if the present-day lutherans
[49:06] could ever get back
[49:08] back to the word
[49:11] back to truly the just shall
[49:14] live by faith not by the lighting of
[49:18] candles
[49:19] not by
[49:21] all these uh man-made teachings in the
[49:25] book but by the word of god and by the
[49:29] revelation of the holy spirit that just
[49:32] shall live
[49:33] by
[49:34] revelation
[49:35] if lutherans would remember
[49:39] from whence they had fallen
[49:43] and return to their first love
[49:46] their original faith
[49:49] and serve god like that wonderful
[49:52] brother served god may the grace of god
[49:55] be upon them
[49:57] may god speak to some of their leaders
[50:00] wherever they are
[50:02] maybe individually
[50:04] speak to them
[50:07] and then my friends
[50:09] there will become again a people that
[50:12] will be to the credit the glory and the
[50:15] praise of our great god and savior
[50:19] our blessed
[50:20] lord
[50:21] jesus christ
[50:23] may god bless this study here tonight
[50:27] of this messenger martin luther
[50:30] messenger
