wednesday night midweek you know we need these mid-week services that it helps us to uh realign you know get back in line with um with our true identity you know when we're out there and we're dealing with the things of the world and we're dealing with situations and family and circumstances you know you just tend to focus in on those things and forget you know our true identity and what it is that god is really doing in our lives because he is um constantly working on every aspect of our lives and he has one goal one purpose one plan and that is to take us in a rapture in this age amen praise god and that's what we need to get refocused back on amen to keep that at the forefront of our lives at all times understanding god's purpose god's will god's desire for his children that plan will never change he decided from before the foundations of the world exactly what he was going to do and nothing has changed because he is the same yesterday today and forever he cannot think something and then change his mind amen all he can do is look down through time and see exactly each and every one of us coming into our rightful positions as sons and daughters of god finding our place in the word of god recognizing that we're actually not you know the human beings that we think that we constantly battle against that we constantly have to overcome amen praise god glory to god so tonight we're going to go to the word of god and um we're going to be looking at uh you can go ahead and put up this yeah so so our title uh this evening is this is your time to recognize your day this is you know we've always heard recognizing your day and its message well you know a lot of people will uh look at that phrase and they'll identify it as oh well we've recognized that god sent a prophet and um you know that he brought certain messages and all we needed to do was to recognize that god sent a prophet and that's good enough i'm going in the rapture now i'm going to be the bride of jesus christ i am the bride of jesus christ not realizing that it's not just recognizing your day it's also recognizing your time your season your hour to manifest the word of god amen and and recognize that that this is this is the rapture age this is the age you know for us as sons and daughters of god uh we can feed and we do feed on the word of god every day and we do listen to the messages we do we attend church we do all that we know that we are supposed to do as sons and daughters of god but then there's that element of recognizing that you have a part you have a part in this rapture in this season and in this age that we are in and you need to recognize that that's the age that's what you are producing and your life is going to manifest that and understand that you are ordained from before the foundations of the world to manifest it and to perform it so let's pray before we go to the word of god father how privileged how honored we are tonight lord to come together in fellowship around your word knowing that father that you saw everything from before the foundations of the world and your attributes are now on earth ready attentive inspired waiting upon instruction so that they can come into season and and recognize the time and the season that we are to manifest your word lord bless prosper anoint the words that are spoken tonight anoint them to be heard in season and may it bring change to each and every one of our lives granted we pray lord remember our pastor strengthen watch over direct and guide him in jesus name amen praise god god bless you saints and so let's look at our scripture tonight our scripture reading comes from second peter 1 15 to 9. and it says here moreover i will endeavor that ye may be able after my decrease to have these things always in remembrance if we for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we were when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty now now you recognize here paul you know he's speaking here and he's bringing clear peter bringing clearly here that that he was an eyewitness to the coming of the lord jesus that it's not something that that he just you know uh thought up or you know uh was you know decided to join some group and and they would come up with these these uh uh circumstances no no he was an actual eyewitness and you as a son and daughter of god you must come into that element in your walk with god you can't just be somebody that's repeating something that was said or told to you you've got to be an eyewitness you've got to have recognized the the the power of jesus christ in your life that he's actually come into your life and taken you from from your old life and buried you into the water because the water a type of the baptism a type of your old life being buried and left behind having that kind of a reality that kind of an experience with god that you can know and say like peter that that listen i'm an eyewitness of individuals whose lives were changed i am an eyewitness my life has been transformed by the word of god i'm not the same person that i was before there's a reality to this for he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy they witnessed it they saw the scripture that was spoken that said this was going to happen he was going to come he was going to fulfill scripture he was going to be the lamb of god that would take away the sin of the world he would be there would be one that would go to the cross and dive they they read the prophecy and then they witnessed the prophecy well you've heard a prophet in the 20th century he's spoken about a bride he's spoken about a rapture he's spoken about a church that's going to raise up in the last day that's going to be the manifestation of jesus christ in female form he spoke those prophecies and now you are witnessing those prophecies because your life is reflecting that very word so whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation amen so don't don't you know there's a lot of interpretations out there there's a lot of teachings on jesus christ the coming of the lord how it is that he's going to come what's going to happen all these different interpretations but the scripture says very clearly here that no no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation don't you lean on to your own understanding don't you rely on your own ability oh i'm i i was good in school i i i'm a good scholar i got my phd i've got my lld i've got a four year university degree big deal when it comes to the to the power and the and the leadership of the holy spirit in your life it's christ in you that's your hope of glory amen the prophecy has got to be fulfilled in you for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but by holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost hallelujah glory to god brother branham was was was was a was a prophet he was a man of god that was moved by the holy spirit and the words that came forth they were the words of god amen praise god but a lot of people don't recognize that you need to have the same spirit that was on william branham to interpret the word of god for your day and your time [Music] glory to god next slide listen to brother branham here god is his own interpreter and if you get a chance listen to that message god is his own interpreter uh by by brother branham it's less than an hour it's full of nuggets that's where i was inspired to bring this message and listen what he says here now all we are today is the display of his attributes now you got to remember brother branham was walking in perfect faith he had a revelation of who he was he realized that he was not the son of charles and ella branham he came to that that that that epiphany in his life when when he met the holy spirit when he met him in that cave when he met him lip to ear and he heard his voice speak to him i trust you've had that kind of an experience because that's the kind of experience that's required in order to be in this rapture age in order to be in the rapture because the rapture is a revelation it's not something that you can join a church and because you belong to that church you're going in the rapture no you need to belong to jesus christ you need to know that the same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you because if that spirit dwells in you it's going to quicken you it's going to change your mortal body it's going to translate you from this dimension of humanity and and frailty and sin and unbelief and weakness into a dimension of perfect love perfect realization of who you are listen to brother branham so he's in this state of perfect faith so now what what he's saying here people don't understand this when you know when sometimes you you try to witness to people and you tell them but you know we are attributes of god and they'll look at you an attribute what what do you mean what do you mean an attribute of god well brother branham knew exactly what he meant when he said we are today is the display of his attributes in god first he was not even god god we would just call him the eternal one he wasn't god because the word english word god means object of worship and there was nothing to worship him so he was the eternal one the main fountain of all intelligence and in this fountain of all intelligence there was not an atom molecule or nothing light nowhere star moon nothing else god what we know as god the great spirit that was eternal never did begin never did end he was there and in him was attributes in him was sons and daughters of god it and and you know like remember you gotta understand here the mind of god sons and daughters are just a definition it's so it's words it's just words but attributes are his thoughts are him actually him but because he was he could just express his thoughts and he could express it as anthony in a human vessel not anthony the human the attribute that's in anthony the attribute that's in you the attribute of god that is going to fulfill his purpose and his will heavens and earth will pass away but my attributes shall never pass away my attributes shall not fail my seed my attribute my word that which you are in this time and in this season you see how you need to recognize that you see how important it is that once you see that and i know you've heard it many many many times but there is a time and a season that the word will become more real to you that's how the rapture is progressing that's how it is that you are going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the scripture talks about lying upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little you see you're receiving a little tonight if you're under that anointing if you're under that inspiration if you've come to church tonight and those of you that are that are out there in youtube world if you've come with expectations in your hearts that you're not just tuning in to listen to some sermon that's going to tickle your ears but that you've actually tuned into the program and the plan of god because god wants to awaken and place his attributes so that they can recognize the time and the season that they are in and what it is that they must fulfill and it's not because you're gonna do it you see this is this is how how great this is you go back and listen to that message god says god's his own interpreter god brings it to pass that's the interpretation not you saying oh well you know brother branham if you don't listen to the tapes and if you don't pay attention and you know you all you need is a tape ministry and you start speaking those kinds of things you're not even close [Music] to what the holy ghost is doing in this hour because the spirit of god is not in any of that though he's using man he's got a five-fold ministry but it's still jesus christ he's still his own interpreter he's never going to change that that will never change that will be the way that he will interpret his word from the beginning until the end so listen here he says now he was there and in him was attributes it was attributes to be god then his attributes to be a father attributes to be a son you see a son attributes to be a savior attributes to be a healer all these attributes was in him and now he these things that has unfolded since then are just his attributes being made manifest next slide and now remember you christians you were his thoughts before there was a world glory so already he he knew exactly the time and the season that you would come into manifestation as a son or as a daughter of god you're just it's just because you're you're you know because god is male and female god is male and female not in the way that the world is perverting it today because they have no revelation of god the eternal one the creator the one who created all things so they take the word they take certain ideas and they come out with neutral gender they come out with uh you know a heishi and they come out with a they and they come what is all that that's all perversion from the word of god that's all it is if they had a true revelation of god they would know that god is male and female expressing himself in an earthly existence and dimension it's only here that we see and we recognize one another in certain aspects of male and female but in god is the male and female attributes and it's displayed but he he was able to separate the truth when he took adam and he took eve out of adam it was a perfect like like just there alone should tell you right there it's plain and simple god god took the woman the womb of the man he took he took the woman from the womb of the man and created a woman and now we've got male and female to be expressed so that god could express himself have fellowship have a relationship you see how beautiful a man and a woman's proper identity and relationship lines up with the word of god but the minute you pervert it and you start coming out with neutral this and neutral that and men you know like like it's just all perversion sorry that's what it is it doesn't line up with the word they have no understanding of the true identity of god of jesus christ jesus christ even was just the word made flesh he was expressed as a redeemer so that he could come and go to the cross and die for our sin in order to fulfill his purpose his plan his redemptive plan for this earth it's only for this earth it's not it's for nothing more once we get changed and we get translated out of this dimension we go back to our eternal sunship eternal attributes of god if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have a brand new one we have a brand new it's it's always been there it's it's our it's our theophany body it's our eternal bodies time only exists here in this dimension there is no time or space beyond this dimension wow i i i could just i could hear these things over and over and over again because all it continues to do is just reinforce who we really are that we're not bound by listen don't get me wrong here you're no different than anybody else out there in the world you're you're susceptible to weakness you're susceptible to anger you're susceptible to to unbelief you're you're susceptible to tiredness and and grouchy and grumpiness and all those things you're absolutely susceptible to all those things but there's an attribute in you that that is god that cannot sin it came from god it's got to go back to god it overrides all of your grumpiness it overrides all of your weaknesses it overrides your your day your down days we all have down days we all have bad days we all make mistakes we're all human beings as long as you're in this human vessel you're going to make mistakes but he says here before there was a world you were in christ amen in god in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is god the whole thing is god the whole plan is god the rapture is god the deception in the world and all of the all of the things that the devil is doing in this world right now especially right now saints if there was ever a time you want to know who you are it's now because the world is in such confusion the people don't know what to believe anymore they don't know what the world's gonna come to they don't understand they're they get caught up into covet they get caught up into cancer they get caught up into hurricane they get caught up into war they get all these things but those things the bible said would be here so so so what are you surprised about as a son or an attribute of god when you're seeing the sure prophecy of god's word being fulfilled right before your eyes right here in 2022 you can't change that nobody can change that but you can change your attitude you can change your vision you can change your outlook you can change the way you live today and not be caught by that and pulled down by circumstance materializing himself tangible so that he could be handled seen and so forth and that's what god is the whole thing it's all god next slide brother branham says here you are known when jesus christ lives in you by his life and promised word of this day reflecting in you you don't need to be running down the street with tracks and trying to convince people that hey it's the coming of the lord you know you got the big sign on your back and on the back it says armageddon is coming armageddon is coming that's not your part that's not your part your part is to display the life of in christ in many different ways you when when men see you living like him when he sees your character you know character is something that that that that is developed by the power of god in your life when you overcome character comes from overcoming character doesn't come by practicing character oh i think i'm going to learn about character and i'm going to try to make my character better good luck people that go for that they end up falling into the traps of pride i'm this i'm better than that i know more than this and i know more than that i can have more wisdom because i can learn more that's not going to work in this hour true character comes from being tested and tried as a son and a daughter of god your conduct with the word just exactly like he was the word being manifested then men will see jesus christ they won't have to look around anywhere else say what does this creed teach what does that creed teach they'll know what god is when they see you because you've got a message that's different than everybody else you've got a message that that that can tell people that you know when people are all caught up and they're all and they're all you know caught up into this world and everything else you can tell them about the salvation of jesus christ and that god is going to deliver a people in this age out of this dimension because what you're seeing now is not going to get better the prophecy says clearly that the world goes into great tribulation right now it's in tribulation you talk to those people that are in ukraine that were in ukraine that that whole country completely devastated okay they just went through a great tribulation that's what i call something because now bombs are dropping right in your backyard bombs are dropping in your neighbors killing people dropping on hospitals killing innocent children that's great tribulation that's just a taste of what is actually going to come upon the world not because we're saying it we're not doom's day sayers it's what the scripture says and everything that the scripture has said up until now it's come to pass so who are we to try and you know or anybody out there to try and say oh no but it's not gonna you know forget about what it says in the book of revelations that this earth shall burn as an oven no no no don't worry about that you know that that that this that these things are gonna happen that the scripture says those things no you have to recognize that all the scripture is going to be fulfilled god's word cannot fail and it's not because god says i'm going to bring this upon the earth no it's because of the law of sowing and reaping and the way that god designed the whole earth and he said very clearly it'll be man himself that will destroy the earth and that's why all the things that they're doing right from the commercialization of of currency and coins and and taking out of the earth and and all the metals and all the natural gas and all the natural things that man constantly sucking out of the earth from those things to government to where they can have their own laws and they can they can set the laws they can say who aborts who doesn't abort they can say who is uh you know uh can be considered you know uh they or a he or a she or a transgender or whatever and pride and have all these things that that's all government that's all government that's all man's interpretation of the world but god has an interpretation of the word that that the world has no idea about unless you're in it [Music] you've got to be a part of that word so the next slide says let your light shine matthew 5 16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so your character your way of living you shouldn't be a religious fanatic you should not be a religious fanatic you should not be somebody that's constantly driving the word down people's throats and this and that that's not how you came just think about the way that you were changed how you were you know it was god's love that came into your life it was god's mercy that came into your life and took you out of out of a certain condition or you know a lot of people say oh yeah you you you had a problem i guess you had a really bad problem so you needed help so you went to the church i then i tell them my testimony and they sit back and they go oh that's different i wasn't looking for god god has a word to interpret god has a time and a season to interpret the rapture god has a people that he ordained from before the foundations of the world if you happen to be one of those whose names were written in the lamb's book of life guess what you're going to get a call you're going to get a knock something's going to knock on your door when you least expect it you might be in a terrible situation like i was under you know certain unbelief and and addictions and all those things you may not be you may just be somebody that's going to church that's got a that's got a heart for god god has attributes in every aspect that's why you don't have to have a crisis in your life to be called of god you just got to be an attribute you just got to be in the mind of god from before the foundation of the world where he wrote your name down in the lamb's book of life and once your name is called and it wasn't called anthony billy kofi michelle it wasn't called that way it was called when you heard the word and something struck you right inside there and it changed you and you knew that you were not you knew that you knew that you knew that something is different something has changed i have come into contact with a supernatural being this is supernatural because all of a sudden i'm set free from certain aspects my life is not the same anymore i'm completely 360 in the way that i perceive in the way that i see things because now you're seeing through the eyes of the attribute now you've put on the mind of christ but the next slide says you need to shine through the darkness and my god if there was ever a time that there was a lot of darkness it is right now you can look around you can you know right from and i'm and don't be looking too far when it comes to you know the the ranks and the fact that we are in this message teaching because remember if you go back and do a study of the church ages we're not going to get into all of that but everything started when jesus christ came to the earth christianity began then that's when god started to call his attributes for the rapture it all started back then those were the church ages and it all came down through those church ages and god was calling sons and daughters of god in each one of those ages and through all that darkness god was calling calling every age calling and and there was a progression of the word constantly progressing from from you know from luther when he broke away from the catholic church that was a progression of the word luther said that just shall live by faith in other words you need your own experience and revelation with god you need to know that you have an experience with god not going to a priest and having him interpret everything for you and tell you what you need to do what's wrong with you meeting god face to face there's no mediator between man and god the scripture says it clearly except jesus christ mary mary is one of our sisters in christ she was blessed because god chose her vessel to put his seed into in order to bring forth a human body so that he could dwell in that human body and go to the cross but once she fulfilled that part and brought forth that portion of the word her part was done that's it she's an attribute of god she's a vessel that god used for that but she's not a mediator today you can't get to heaven by going to mary you need to go directly to jesus christ it wasn't mary that died on the cross it was christ that died on the cross you know we don't want to get into all but see luther caught a revelation of that broke away from the church because he had an understanding that there was that there was a relationship between him and god directly and then there was wesley and you know he realized that you needed to have sanctification in your life that your life could not just go on and you could just live any way you want and be lustful and take two or three different women or men and live you know any way that you want no he said you need to have a sanctified life you know and so that was another progression of the word and then pentecost came along they received the gifts you know the speaking in tongues those were the gifts of the spirit and then god sends a prophet to bring restoration to all of it to bring clarity to all of it and that's that's where we were blessed that it his ministry wiped out all the confusion turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers amen praise god so that we could recognize who we you know that all this confusion all these churches all this this this teaching and everything else that that we would be able to easily come out of it because now we know where we're at you can't get somewhere unless you know where you are you need to know your destination but you also need to know your starting point you need to know where you're at in your walk with god and that's what we're trying to establish here tonight so that you can come to a place where you can recognize that you are an attribute of god and it's your time to shine it's your time to recognize it's your time to recognize your day your time your season what it is that god requires of you as a son or a daughter of god in this day and this hour not fanaticism we're not talking about finale we're not fanatics we're not we're not fanatics and and and you know we're going out there and telling the people you've got you've got all kinds of fanatics going on out there and people think it's okay you know they want to go there and they want to make a fuss over pride they want to make a fuss over this they want to make a fuss over that you know meanwhile they're they're getting caught up into what the world is supposed to produce and supposed to do that's not what we're supposed to do so ephesians chapter 6 you know we're not going to go much further here i want to let you out here in the next 10 minutes or so but there's a lot that i have here and as the lord provides we will continue this little series on recognizing your time but ephesians chapter 6 verses 11 to 12 says put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand against the wiles and i thought oh that's interesting then i heard a little bit about the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places we're not dealing with you know oh you know you're a baptist oh well you know you need to you need to be uh born again and you need to let go of the trinity and you know all these little no no no these no we're dealing against spiritual powers in high places they're moving right where you are if you're walking with god and you're recognizing the day that you're living in and you're recognizing that you are a son of god that's going to produce a rapture then you are the one that's facing spiritual powers in high places wickedness principalities and dominions sometimes we don't realize just how powerful those things are but the wiles of the devil are his methods his ways of deceiving you of of getting you into into a state of mind as a son or a daughter of god because listen satan knew that jesus christ was the real thing he saw the things that were happening around his life but he went to him at the time of weakness so let's look at the next slide wiles of the devil whiles are tricks or manipulations designed to deceive someone the tongue-in-cheek phrase a woman's wiles to the seductiveness of femme fatales in using charm or sex appeal to elicit a desired response from men listen the devil he's the same in the way that he moves in the way that he acts he went to eve back in the garden of eden and he seduced her he seduced her it wasn't an apple that she ate he deceived her into making love and bypassing god's word bypassing god's plan deceiving her to get her off the word hath god said putting question to the word of god and you've got to be careful of those things because the devil the wiles of the devil are those clever schemes used by satan to ensure us to ensnare us through temptation threat or intimidation we need to realize what it is and how it is that the devil is trying to deceive us to take our minds to try to get us off of who we really are what it is that we're supposed to produce how it is that we are the interpretation of god's word in this hour to produce the rapture to stay focused on the word of god to stay focused on why we assemble ourselves together not to just show up and be identified oh i was at church i go to church more than anybody else if you're coming to church with a revelation that you're meeting with god and that he's speaking to you lip to ear discerning your life discerning your needs giving you instruction on how to produce the word for your day and for your hour then you're going to leave here different [Music] it's your attitude of coming to church it's your motives for coming to church that's what god looks at in your heart that's what god recognizes in your heart but when you start acting in that way you start being a a dedicated vessel a yielded vessel a prayer warrior you're at the prayer meetings you're there praying you're there believing in the power of god to deliver your situations your family your friends to hear your brothers and sisters praying and believing for god to deliver them from the snares of the enemy the wiles of the devil then you will see god in action you will you will you will identify with the word you will recognize the word you will manifest the word supernatural will just automatically take place around your life because of your awareness and because of who you are remember this is not you performing the word the bible says very clearly jesus god said back in the old testament i am the lord god i have spoken it i will perform it god is going to perform it right through your life when you yield yourself remember the interpretation of god's word is when he interprets it not when you interpret it when you try to convince somebody that they need jesus christ listen you can tell about the lord but there are attributes of god and then there are children of the world and many children of the world are going to receive jesus christ but they are not attributes they are not eternal an attribute is eternal because it's a part of god and if you're an attribute you never had a beginning you'll never have an end you're going to just manifest the thought of god you're going to you're going to manifest fellowship and relationship and and and you're going to manifest god's attributes in its pure form people of the world that are that are in this children of this world because they came by by by procreation let every seed bring forth of its own kind when man and woman started to procreate they brought forth children but remember it's when the attribute of god lands inside your soul there's a lot of soul everybody's got a soul out there everybody lives and and consists and lives by the life of god but not everybody is an attribute even the trees out there live by the life of god because god spoken god spoke let there be the fish of the sea so when he spoke the fish of the sea the fish were created they have a life in them by the spoken word but that doesn't make them eternal they have a beginning they'll have an end anything that's of this world without the attribute in that soul will have a beginning and an end they will actually you know their bodies will go six feet under and their soul will go to judgment and they'll be judged according to the works of their flesh that's the so-called christian world out there teaching but attributes of god that's a different category altogether we're not making ourselves something better no the reason why we can talk and we can speak about these things is because the holy ghost revealed it to us we didn't teach these things to ourselves we didn't learn these things these are things that are taught by the spirit of god jesus christ said the comforter the holy ghost he will come in you he will lead you and guide you into all truth well the truth is christ the word there can only be one truth there's not 15 different interpretations that's why there's no such thing as a trinity it's god but it's god expressed in different offices father son and holy ghost that's why when when when peter and and all the all the apostles were there when jesus christ came down in that eternal body and stood before them and said go ye into all the world baptizing them in the name he was telling them the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost the name is jesus christ and that's why you'll only ever find baptism in the anywhere in the new testament in the name of the lord jesus christ you won't find it in the name of the father and the son and the holy no you won't find that anywhere that's man's teaching and the minute man hybrids the word takes the word puts their own interpretation puts their own uh doctrine okay teachings of man that's why when jesus christ was on the earth and he stood before those pharisees and he says because of your doctrines because of your teachings because of your your interpretation you've made the word of god of none effect to the people and that's why people you can talk to them until they're blue in the face but unless there's an attribute of god in there to receive and to hear what you're hearing and what you're speaking there'll be no response and so that's why you you're not trying to convince people to be a christian convince them to live a certain way there's no convincing here this is god being his own interpreter he will bring it to pass and so i want to close it off right here and next time we get together it'll be part two and we're going to look at examples of the wiles of the devil and how it is that he can can get to you at certain times in your life when you're weak when you're tired when you're discouraged when you're beaten up when you're beaten down understand something the testing is all part of the blessing the testing is all part of giving you the character that you need let the musicians come the testing is all part of god removing the amnesia from your life because when you came into this dimension and you landed in this human vessel the attribute of god that didn't get called until a certain time in season in your life for some of you you still need to wake up there's people that think they're awake but they're still asleep especially at this time how could it be so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect if it were possible that's got to be pretty close to home in order to get deceived we're going to look at some of those things next time we come together god bless you saints let us pray father we are so grateful tonight for your word and for the inspiration that you've laid upon our hearts tonight to to speak and to hear lord i know that many have heard and many are rejoicing because i'm rejoicing from what i heard tonight lord i heard my name being called being placed i know that this is not who i am i'm identified as dan masili but there's an attribute that lives that identifies only with the word it cannot believe anything but the word it cannot disbelieve the word what a beautiful experience and victory in the love divine to know that we we can do we can only do so much but when we've done all that we can we just stand and then you do the rest wow thank you lord we love you we appreciate you lord we we give you thanks and praise for all that you're doing in our lives remember every home every family lord i know there are many challenges in in each and every one of your children's lives lord wherever they may be all over the world go and minister to their needs lord let them recognize fathering the authority that they have as sons and daughters of god [Music] blessed be your wonderful name father we give you thanks we look forward to the word this sunday the prayer meeting this friday night meet us once again in jesus name amen [Music] but i [Music] [Music] to [Music] so [Music] me [Music] grace [Music] [Music] and my will lost [Music] oh [Music]
