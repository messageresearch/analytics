reading from verses 1 to 13. it's up on the screen so we can read it from there if we want to uh let us read together then shall the kingdom of heaven be lightened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were wise took their lamps that were they that were foolish sorry took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bright groom carried or delayed they all slumbered and slept i wanted to notice it wasn't just the unwise virgins that slept all of them slumbered and slept every one of them even a true believer slumbered and slept never coming to the uh full understanding of what was really happening now and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom comet goyi out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man commit amen our gracious and eternal father we ask that your spirit will draw near grant us your divine presence just as you spoke with adam and eve in the garden may the great holy spirit come on the scene father speak to us once again lord in the cool of the day our hearts are open our hearts are willing our ears want to hear you father and may you receive all the praise the honor and the glory in jesus name amen praise god god bless you please be seated glory to god amen now um if you have a garden and then you know that whatever seeds you plant in that garden that's what's going to come up uh you can't plant limes and expect you're going to have apples and oranges and and sweet grapes you're not going to have it because every seed the law of god said it from the beginning every seed must bring forth after its kind it has got to reproduce itself and this is what god said whatever you planted therefore we know that when we plant seeds and the rain falls on the seed the rain doesn't make the seed get born again the rain doesn't uh cause the seed to change its origin the rain only brings out what was planted in that garden and god spoke until told us true the prophet for the spirit spoke and speaks through the prophet the spirit of god let us know that we are not just here now at this time for no reason at all but in future home but you are not creatures of time you come from eternity you're going back to eternity you come from the presence of almighty god and you're going back into the presence of god because you were in him before the foundation of the world you are in him as the original thoughts of god those thoughts were then spoken the spoken word became flesh amen it was manifest in one man whose name was jesus christ but now it's filtered down to this day where that word which was a one man body that god was in has now become a many member body called the bride this is what jesus spoke about why he said it is important that i have got to die for the corn of wheat must go into the ground so that it might come up and become up and bear fruit a thousand fold multiply and reproduce itself amen and so we are living in that day where we are the fulfillment of that prophecy the word of god coming back up again but listen that word when it was manifest was in the flesh of a man named jesus christ but now that word has come back in your flesh by the holy spirit of the living god and again it is without form of comeliness it's so simple they had no desire to even see him they they didn't think anything of him and you know the mocking and the scoffing oh we know who you are you are joseph and mary's son we know you used to play with our boy down the street but they don't realize the man on the outside didn't change but the man on the inside was a predestinated seed that come from the presence of almighty god but now the time has come or came for those seeds to be made manifest and just as the rain falls and on the just and when you unjust amen whether it's a weed or a wheat the rain is going to bring it up because the rain doesn't make or change the seed it just germinates it it just brings it to life to show its real qualities and its essence that's in it even so we come if we are true believers with the charm of god within us then the spirit of the living god will fall on that german gene whatever you want attribute it will fall on it to bring it to a manifestation hallelujah so that it could reveal its character it's to reveal its kind for every seed will bring forth after its kind and if it's a word kind then it will love the word be the word not by works when a baby is born it doesn't have to work to be a human it's just born a human and when you are a seed of god you don't have to cultivate you don't have to acculturate you don't have to go and educate you don't have to get into the bible school in the bible college for them to lock you into a religious mindset or system of thoughts but to remain in the fullness of the word where your mind your heart your soul is free to soar like an eagle and to receive the revelation that comes from the word of god amen hallelujah amen every seed will bring forth to harvest natural rain and the natural seeds are harvest the holy grass falls on the seeds of this hour and it will bring forth a spiritual harvest to the glory of god amen praise god and i'm glad we are living now in the harvest time do you believe that we are living in the harvest time because god used a prophet hallelujah to plant the seeds for this hour praise god oh my i'm talking about the spoken word amen that spoken word called out to the planted the already planted word that was in the heart of the true believer and when the deep called to this deep that was in here it has to respond because nobody has educated about that tell it anything about that it's going to no he said well how are you going to know i can't explain that hey man just like when i met my wife i i didn't have to have anybody explain to me you know any detail or any great calculus to know that uh something in here testified to me that that's right hallelujah it's the same way when you come in contact with the word of god the same holy spirit testifies to this spirit inside the soul the gene that german tells it that's right amen praise be to god hallelujah amen so quoting from brother branham now so then we see that when the spirit falls it will bring forth a harvest of that seed that was planted that it falls on whatever seed you planted when it falls and that is going to make it live is that right that's what he's saying therefore i predict that the two denominational groups pentecostal and evangelical groups will work together in a denomination they will unite themselves together and it will become a member of the world council of churches the federation of the council of churches now remember they already belong to it all of them he means individually he didn't say that but that's what he's talking about but they're gonna openly now come as an organization and they will belong to it all of them will be long see and there will come through them a force or a boycott see and will stop everything but whatsoever belongs to that union of churches right they will stop everything else except if you belong to that union of churches now now we know that the bible said there would be a boycott it even said it would cause people not to be able to buy not to be able to sell unless they had received this mark of the beast right now of course we know that is denominationalism as a whole right he says here romanism but romanism is the mother of all denominationalism so i know what he's saying that that's the mark of the beast now we hear this mark and the devil is so cunning he gives a human beings ideas that these marks are some literal letter or a number or a mark on a wall or something like that and a mark is really a spirit you have that spirit in you it operates through you it motivates you causes you act in a certain manner that you don't have to think to act that way hey man but i'm glad i have another mark uh i am marked you are mark if you're a true believer marked by the holy spirit the holy spirit acting and moving in the believer mocks that believer amen in other words it causes people to see something different they don't know what it is amen and you can't fully explain to them what it is because if you say it's the holy spirit they're going to say oh yeah so oh oh my isn't that the way it is always that way they try to make fun of the great holy spirit of the living god now so and then we see the image of the beast after that which is really protestantism mark of the beast image of the beast which is protestantism amen praise god well you run understand that uh the image of the beast god made man in his own image so when you say image of the beast we're talking now about satan trying to copy god and he creates a not a bride formed shaped and purposed by revelation but one that he organized as a system a denomination to create a religious body for him to dwell in speak through and act true but god created people that would be on the earth in a specific age at a specific time to hear a specific message recognize that message be changed by the power of god be able to manifest the holy spirit in their lives and they become what the image of god the body of jesus christ made manifested praise the name of the lord hallelujah yes now we see then that beast that beast the one with the mark you see has the power and the authority to give life to that image life to that image to speak hallelujah we're back to the same thing you have no authority to speak unless you get their registrations right now we are living in the uh which is my topic tonight the time of the unwise virgin why when they're allowing people to speak like i'm preaching now we've got protestant churches out there preaching now message church is preaching now they allow that it's like a cat watching a mouse and they just allow it to go on and on and when they and the prophet uses the term when they have united all their powers amen once they've united all their powers they got economics they got religion they got uh you know commercial they got all these different political and so on they got all these powers together and they got it united now they can come openly and tell you to shut up shut down you got nothing to say if we don't register you we don't give you permission you don't see a word or else you're going to be in jail or receives whatever you have now are these things mythical or reimagining things look this is a real prophet struck the earth a real prophet spoke thus saith the lord a real prophet walked among us brought the word of god and we are here tonight why because we are resting on that we're believing that we're trusting the word of god we can say like paul now he says you know if if jesus didn't die he really didn't die and this was all a story then he says you know then i would have lived in vain is that right oh my but thank god who giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ amen because he didn't die in vain he didn't rise in vain it was not an imagination he lives forever more he's the same yesterday today and forever amen see he gives life to that image the confederation of churches when they finally confederate themselves together he gives life to that image now i don't know but in the middle of it he stops and he says here now there are many young people here listening to me i'm speaking one spoken word it's the original seeds i'm i'm quoting from page 65 if you'd like to know that listen there are many young people here i don't know i don't know jesus may come this very afternoon he may come next year i don't know when he'll be coming oh i if and if i do not live to see that day of his coming i i i want to repeat now if i do not see it do not let this depart from your ears or from your heart just remember for i speak in the name of the lord now i believe with all my heart that's the way it will wind up there will be like a union a boycott all such places as this here that we are in will be closed down that is not a maybe hope so it can be no he definitely say it's just saith the lord places like this that we are in worshiping god listen we are going to have to go back to the times of jesus do you know jesus never built a church in his lifetime what we call a church you know he never built a building no and literally when they believe that they're throwing us out of these buildings they're taking us right back to the original primitive way that jesus and the disciples were worshiping if you visit israel and you see some of the places where we stopped and put them to sit down on the rocks and then he was talking to them like the mountain be attitudes if you go to some of the other place capoeira and so on you will see it's just simple amen they just sat around under a tree or they sat wrong on some rocks or or you know you just talked to them but it's denominationalism that got us all worked up into this oh you gotta have a building or you don't have a church oh you got to do this you have to do that the devil put those markers and put those standards that we want to live up to to prove we are a church we don't have to do that we are the when you say the church we become the real body of christ and the one that is in us is jesus christ is the spirit of christ in us motivate activating moving us hallelujah it's the same holy spirit so wherever you are wherever he is wherever jesus is that's where there's church is that right so he's in me he's in you we get together amen the spirits of just men and women made perfect through him and we get together through the what we are pulled and drawn together because we are hungering after righteousness we have a source for the ever-present water from the rock we want the revelation from the word of god hallelujah that's our desire that's why we're here tonight praise god hallelujah we're not attracted by rich uh a wealthy expensive uh tiles on the floor and uh you know uh like i saw in the vatican uh rugs that are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and you know all kinds of rubies and diamonds and everything else that's not what attracts us amen praise god hallelujah but we are retracted from the scintillating diamonds of the revelation that flashes from the word of god thunders and lightning coming from the word amen voices coming from the word god speaking through his word into the hearts of his believers amen yes sir amen see now remember that there will be a union and there will be a boycott do you believe this amen all such places as this here we are in will be closed down and you will not be able to speak unless you get permission or you will have to have a license from this federation of churches to even hold a service one service so are we coming back to the times when uh hebrews 11 they wondered about in sheepskins and goat skins now we won't be wearing sheepskins and goat skins because we dress and we're clothed in a different manner but it's trying to tell you you're going to actually have to hide the worship you're going to have to go conceal yourself to worship god right you got to go in back in the catacombs again amen but catacombs you don't have to go to rome for that i'm not saying that i'm saying that you'll find some caves somewhere you'll find some trees somewhere and be able to worship god like some of our brethren over in china right now uh when they go into worship and you know they have to go into a certain place and they have to go in one by one so they don't be suspected or recognize that it's a gathering of people coming together right and they will do it in this non-descript house or something and they'll worship but they won't go all of them there may be five or ten of them and then all through the day five ten more comes in 15 or whatever and that's how they have to worship god and what this scripture and what the prophet is telling us just before our going away if we are delayed enough time here that we will start to see this starting to happen amen and you need to know this right now you can't have um a marriage officer's license to marry anybody right unless you get permission some group right now they're letting things loose right so like uh the group that i know of that uh the parents of this gentleman were with brother branham in the early days and so they formed this group so uh they can issue licenses to um believers brethren uh like that but you know what that is even slipping away because the government will come down on them and they're beginning to ask now do you believe in the trinity is that right or they put that in do you believe in the trinity uh do you believe this do you believe that and then you see they start weeding out because a real believer is not going to be putting up with that they're going to have to get out of that move out of it completely right and they will not permit you to speak or deign or anything like that it's all coming to our end is that right praise god and even if there's some brothers they got they they got their ordinations and stuff like that and licenses when they were in the denomination and they came out but they still retained it because they were already ordained they were already this and right now they are allowed to function brother branham is bringing all these things into view that the time of this unwise virgin that's here upon us right now their reigns are tightening and as it tightens he's showing you what the end point is going to be right but a lot of things have to start happening before all that comes right out in the public right so they're going to start dealing with these things so just keep your eyes watching keep your hearts watching be vigilant and see where the word of god is heading oh friends remember that is where this will all end up uh wind up at that is my prediction as a servant of christ with the understanding and inspiration of the word i tell you all the signs are pointing to the very end right praise god hallelujah so what do we find the unwise virgins are already crying for oil we are seeing all the great preachers before if they mention one word like branham the ministry will fall apart so they wouldn't mention his name but now some of them are coming out and said oh this was one of the greatest evangelists there ever was at least they're doing that far then they go a little further and then they'll go back to calling him a prophet because they know they can't doubt that they know that he was a godsend prophet uh yeah i mean let me tell you friends they would have investigated brother branham they would have gone through his life his actions his works his words and everything else to see whatever if there's any fake any tricks any hypnotism any psycho any therapies of whatever what they look up on him in every way but they can't touch anything just like when jesus came he was blameless god sent the prophet in this hour he's blameless and they wouldn't even doubt it if they recognize what it was because they don't realize that the mighty angel of revelation 10 in our time when the first two polls came to an end the time came for the seven seals to be open and the seventh one to break forth to bring out the elect then that my angel cried with a loud voice and that mighty angel came down i believe arizona and i was up on the mountain very early days with brother perry green and saw the rock scattered they're in not now they're all taken away by people but here comes the mighty angel and it comes to the earthly angel of revelation 10 7. so revelation 10 1 came and moved in revelation 10 7. so looking to the unseen you'll hear brother brother branham preaching and in the middle of the preaching suddenly our voice sounds this is not william branham speaking this is the lord god almighty come down william branham has only loaned me his voice and his body amen praise god friends let me tell you some great supernatural things have happened in our day and we are blessed to be witnesses of these things god speaking through a prophet so revelation 10 1 came into revelation 10 7 brother branham's preaching changes everything changed i won't get into much of that but instead of saying uh second of coming of christ second coming of christ he's coming again oh flashing red light of his coming and all of a sudden he changed ah greater than solomon is here is that right praise god hallelujah who do you say this is oh my goodness gracious the people didn't understand what he was saying amen god in a prophet which is a body prepared and put down here in a certain age that god knows he can come to indwell and speak true amen when they say oh the prophet was just a preacher he shouldn't be able to teach if they realize who was speaking through that prophet they will sit down and let him just teach them amen praise the name of the lord oh my oh friends you see the unwise virgin has begun to cry out for oil but think of it she was a virgin and if she's a virgin it means she's a church right now revelation 17 speaks of that harlot church see oh and even john even admired her because of her great beauty and she was a beautiful thing to behold but yet in her was found the blood of the saints amen i believe it is 68 million on the mitrology of the roman catholic church that was put to death since saint augustine of hippo 68 million killed and recorded amen see because of what disagreeing with her and her doctrine that's all that's all that's right there disagreeing with her why she doesn't see the word she doesn't believe the word she doesn't really teach the word she she just preaches a lie see she just preaches a lie which you know what is a lie a lie has to be mixed with enough truth in there for people to swallow it amen so she mixed in uh a little bit of the bible here and there in biblical terms and scriptural terms uh to create a religious uh bewitching uh spirit upon the people and to draw them in in that way but let me stay with and quote the prophet because i am behind the word right now when i speak like that if i were to come out and then make that kind of a condemnation they can easily send the law enforcement to pick me up and said you called us you said this but i'm not saying anything i'm preaching right from the storehouse that's why all this was stored up but god is allowing us now to be able to recognize and see what the prophet was saying and understand what the prophet was saying in the word amen praise god hallelujah so you see it then jesus said there would come a time they would kill you thinking they were doing god a service and there would be sincere about it you see they're dead sincere because that's what they were taught and when that word that was taught they thought it was planted in them that also has to bring forth a crop see and that's why what he's saying here they killed 68 million back then they're gonna start doing the same thing after they bring that boycott and you don't heat it then it's going to repeat all over again right that's what he's talking about here it'll repeat again in that manner like that that unwise virgin amen but see the bride stands with the seed the spoken word seed of god which is the seed and it will produce what it says that it will produce i believe it i believe it praise god that's the reason i believe in divine healing do you he says i believe in visions do you he says i believe in angels do you praise god i believe in this message do you praise god hallelujah it's because it all comes from the word of god i believe it amen i believe with all my heart that this is thus saith the lord amen now see this unwise woman this virgin as i have said this church but she is unwise because she delayed she is the literary and not receiving the word of god play around with the word of god use it for money making use it for advertisement use it for millions more in our organization oh praise god use the prophet's ministry to enrich to multiply themselves and and glorify themselves he himself said it he said you know i've sent from this message millions into the oneness assembly of god this church that group this other group amen hallelujah what and they were willing for that but watch when the first and second pull was over and now he comes to the seed word preaching of the spoken word seed all of a sudden oh we thought he was a prophet he's not really a prophet he's not he has no right to teach the word you know they want more signs they want more miracles they want more healings but they don't want the word brother branham said one place he says he says it's okay in the first couple of years of jesus ministry he says he had years of what uh years of preparation and then he had years of popularity brother branham didn't say that i'm saying that now but you know you had years of popularity and then come the years of persecution is that right so now we see as we look into the word here that he is literally he is literally showing the same thing happening in his ministry and in his life right amen oh my when the angel was teaching him this and teaching him that teaching that and then he got popular with the discernment and the healings and and the calling out of the people from the congregation the names the places their address got popular and then after that what where did he go to all of a sudden he's in his years of persecution and everything's starting to come down on him amen now notice now notice she called herself a bride she calls herself a bride remember everything in this bible runs from tree see father son and holy ghost and god the father was the god that lived in the pillar of fire hallelujah he was using that to draw israel to him praise god hallelujah now god the father came down lived in the son which made him god the son see god the son now we see god the son then we know he died on a cross but when he was here in him he was the expressed image of god hallelujah hallelujah or the seed of god made manifest right in other words people have a visible perspective a visible uh a visualization of of of god and how he would act and and how he would do and stuff like that because god being a spirit nobody could see him they wouldn't know him in that way but with the actions and the life and the signs the power the creativity everything that came out of him they were able now to have some idea of god for god was expressing an image amen and jesus christ back there hallelujah now we see that now that other office the holy ghost was this is the same god hallelujah amen and now trying to bring the word the spoken word like them other two officers did before to the people and now they are rejecting it see it's the three offices or three manifestations of the one god now in action hallelujah amen you see that now you don't have to just hear the word hear the message and oh i hear the message i believe you must recognize what you heard you must have a revelation an understanding of what you heard and when you get that now then it makes you want to see the word man manifest in your life hallelujah and then the word that was written word spoken word in you becomes the living word living epistles to be read of all men see it's that way because it's now god in action what god now in his people today god in action and god is in action for it is god in the people amen praise god hallelujah god hiding i'm going to i'm i'm going to i'm going to start winding this down because remember there's a lot of inspiration height striking me here i can go talking about the badger skins of the temple and all this stuff but right now let's stick with what we are we're talking about here so now remember so they went to buy oil see but when she did she found out it was too late amen praise god hallelujah because the seeds were done planted amen you see friends people are finding out that you don't get born again now you are not really saved now because you don't get eternal life now because if you have eternal life brother branham said and the bible says you always had to be eternal and if you were always eternal there was no time when you were not there will be no time when you will not be because you're a part of him now reveal now manifest hallelujah praise god hallelujah amen praise god now i repeat you're looking at me now all you're seeing is this outward man right that's why paul had to say later on then shall we know as we are known it's only really then you're going to really know me because all you're hearing is the spirit inside speaking right and this is the house god give me to live in now amen explain to black bronc whatever you want to call it but that's the house he give me to live in and i'm living in it and speaking from my house door praise god hallelujah but i want you to know friends this is the this entire bride is the body of christ this is the son of man now being revealed in a bright form in the form of a bride making himself known in this great hour amen praise god hallelujah i want you to know it but this unwise virgin went to buy oil found out she was too lit because the seeds been done planted when were the seeds planted before the foundations of the world they were in god is that right and they came forth manifested and we know that all the seeds were in jesus christ just like all my father's
