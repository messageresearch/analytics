[35:14] everybody you know can talk about you
[35:17] know Mary and Joseph and their
[35:19] experience but let me tell you um though
[35:22] it is is now a story for the people back
[35:26] then when it was actually happen
[35:27] happening it was a reality it was
[35:30] something that they could not
[35:33] understand from a from a a a a normal
[35:36] human standpoint of view how a woman
[35:39] could conceive a child without being
[35:41] with a man amen and these were these
[35:45] were things that you know that the
[35:47] people were questioning at the time and
[35:49] wow what's got up to here because a lot
[35:51] of them didn't realize what the prophecy
[35:55] had said and they they failed to to
[35:57] believe believe that everything that God
[35:59] said he would do everything there's
[36:03] nothing that God will not do that he
[36:06] promised according to his word and it
[36:09] applies to every single one of us
[36:12] because in our day here now we are we
[36:14] are experiencing these things we know
[36:17] that God is up to something amen what is
[36:20] God up to this Christmas well you're G
[36:22] to hear about it you heard about it last
[36:24] Sunday you're going to continue to hear
[36:26] about it every Sunday right from this
[36:28] Pulpit amen that God is up to something
[36:31] big and we can be glad that we're a part
[36:33] of it amen and so you know you can ask
[36:36] yourself what's God up to in my life in
[36:39] my church in my neighborhood on my
[36:43] street or my place of uh where I work
[36:47] amen what's he up to and so it's a great
[36:51] question but if you if you want to know
[36:53] the answers then you need to look back
[36:55] into the scriptures you need to read
[36:58] about the Lord Jesus and what he did
[37:00] what he said and what he manifested when
[37:03] he was here on Earth just over 2,000
[37:06] years
[37:07] ago amen praise God and so a quick
[37:11] review uh we go to uh slide our next
[37:14] slide we looked at it will be in ways
[37:18] that we weren't expecting God will do
[37:20] things in ways that you will not expect
[37:21] him to do it'll be in ways that are that
[37:23] are surprising even startling okay amen
[37:27] and uh don't expect God to work only in
[37:30] ways that you're already familiar with
[37:33] okay you know because you were brought
[37:34] up under the traditions of of going to
[37:36] church and you know you thought that you
[37:38] know just going to church and being
[37:40] present in a place and and and repeating
[37:43] things after the priest or or or you
[37:45] just singing some hymns and and so forth
[37:48] that that was worshiping God that's just
[37:51] a small aspect of worshiping the lord
[37:55] it's a life of worship amen praise God
[37:59] so Jesus often comes to us in unexpected
[38:03] ways you you know you would think oh if
[38:06] I go to church that's where he can come
[38:08] to me that's not where he came to me I
[38:11] don't know about you but we can look
[38:14] back into the scriptures and and see
[38:16] that that you know most of the Miracles
[38:19] and the things that the Lord Jesus did
[38:21] was not in
[38:23] church okay it was in the streets in the
[38:27] Bible in the highways at people's
[38:30] homes amen and he was doing miraculous
[38:33] things and he was doing it amongst
[38:36] strange people people that they wouldn't
[38:39] think would be the normal and so as such
[38:42] people of God didn't recognize him at
[38:46] that time when he was here on Earth and
[38:49] they turned around and they said he's
[38:50] beab he's a heretic he's causing trouble
[38:55] he's you know he's dividing the people
[38:58] they didn't recognize that he was doing
[39:01] something in ways that they weren't
[39:04] expecting but if they had a looked to
[39:06] the scripture they would have seen it
[39:09] clearly problem today is a lot of people
[39:11] don't read the
[39:13] word amen he came in ways that it made
[39:17] it easy for them to actually reject
[39:21] him look at John 20 when Mary went to
[39:24] the supper just a quick review she went
[39:26] to the supper she was looking for the
[39:28] body she had walked with Jesus she was
[39:31] with him when he was doing all the great
[39:32] Miracles and then she went to the supper
[39:34] because she wanted to anoint his body
[39:36] and and she's going there and she goes
[39:38] to the to the cave to the and and and
[39:40] she asks somebody that's standing there
[39:43] uh have you seen Jesus she looked inside
[39:45] and and the body was missing and the
[39:48] person she was asking was actually the
[39:51] Lord
[39:52] himself but she didn't recognize him
[39:55] because he had gone into another form of
[39:59] the word he had transcended from being a
[40:03] physical human Son of God to A
[40:09] theophany Jesus in his word body now in
[40:14] order to fulfill the next aspect of the
[40:16] word which was to reveal himself now
[40:19] personally that's why if you read the
[40:22] scripture in in John 2016 and 17 Jesus
[40:26] saith unto her Mary
[40:27] she turned herself and she said unto him
[40:31] Rabbi Master when he spoke her name when
[40:35] he deliberately opened her understanding
[40:39] she recognized who he was and it's the
[40:42] way that he's doing it in this hour you
[40:45] might think it's strange you know all
[40:47] these churches and all these people
[40:48] going to church and they're under all of
[40:50] this tradition but they fail to
[40:53] recognize that when Jesus calls
[40:56] personally people change and they're
[40:58] never going to be the same they'll never
[41:01] be the same amen praise God but it's a
[41:05] personal now Jesus was moving on and
[41:08] you'll notice he went to meet with the
[41:10] disciples on the road to emus and here
[41:12] he was it was Christ it was the Messiah
[41:15] talking to his disciples and they didn't
[41:17] recognize that it was him but their
[41:19] hearts were burning within them but then
[41:22] he went into the room with them he went
[41:25] in to have supper with them he went in
[41:26] to have some fellowship with them and he
[41:28] broke the bread and the scripture says
[41:31] and their eyes were open Hallelujah he's
[41:34] doing it still now I trust that the word
[41:37] of God this morning as the word comes
[41:40] forth and the word gets broken and the
[41:42] bread of life gets gets delivered and
[41:45] and and pieces are delivered into your
[41:47] into your hearts and into your lives
[41:49] that your understanding will open and
[41:51] you'll say my heart was burning within
[41:54] me while I heard the word of God this
[41:56] morning amen praise God that's why we're
[41:59] here he called her personally by name
[42:02] and he's calling you by name amen praise
[42:06] God he's come back Hallelujah listen uh
[42:10] what what does our Lord do after we fail
[42:13] to receive him when he comes in an
[42:16] unexpected way what does he do he just
[42:19] moves
[42:20] on he moves on you you have the the
[42:25] ability to say Amen
[42:27] or you can have the ability to say nah
[42:30] that's too religious for me making it
[42:32] too personal I don't want him in my
[42:35] personal life I got things in my
[42:38] personal life that I don't want to be
[42:42] exposed you know that's the problem I
[42:44] talk to people about the Lord and they
[42:46] say you know Danny I'm GNA come to
[42:48] church sometime but I got to clean up my
[42:49] life I said you got it wrong it's
[42:52] backwards I said you need to come and
[42:55] let the word clean up your life you
[42:57] can't do it you've been trying to do it
[42:59] for for the last 30 years 40 years
[43:02] whatever it is you can't do it you got
[43:04] to let him do it amen praise God he says
[43:08] I can do it I can lift things off your
[43:10] life that you had no idea I he can do
[43:13] more than you could possibly even
[43:16] imagine I let him in amen you need to be
[43:20] like uh what what it says you need to
[43:22] recognize what it says in Isaiah 43:18
[43:25] forget the former things do not dwell on
[43:28] the past don't look at the way things
[43:30] used to be move on and allow the Holy
[43:34] Spirit he says behold I'm doing a new
[43:37] thing I want to change your life I want
[43:39] to transform you I want to move you on
[43:42] to Perfection according to the word I
[43:44] want the world to see that this whole
[43:47] thing about Christianity and going to
[43:49] church is a lot more it's it's it's much
[43:51] bigger than the people expected amen
[43:55] next slide we looked at that he says
[43:57] second it'll be in places and among
[43:59] people that we weren't expecting we just
[44:01] said
[44:03] that you'll go to a certain church and
[44:06] you'll look at you know you come into
[44:07] this church here a lot of people will
[44:08] come in and man they'll say wow you got
[44:11] the United Nations in here that's right
[44:14] because God is calling from every Walk
[44:17] of Life it's not about color it's not
[44:21] about upbringing it's not about
[44:24] language it's about the word
[44:27] and the fact that if the word is in you
[44:30] from before the foundations of the world
[44:32] Jesus said all that the father hath
[44:35] given me will
[44:37] come not one will be lost and this is so
[44:42] important to recognize that when when my
[44:45] sheep hear my voice no other will they
[44:50] follow this aspect of the word is in
[44:54] progress always has been in progress
[44:57] progress he'll never change because he's
[44:59] the same Jesus Christ yesterday today
[45:02] and forever amen praise God and so he'll
[45:05] do it in in in in ways uh and in places
[45:10] and amongst people that we would least
[45:12] expect amen praise God glory to God Amen
[45:16] God can show up in most ungodly
[45:20] places he can show up anywhere he wants
[45:24] if he wants to call one of his children
[45:26] he'll go go to a
[45:27] party he'll go to Matthew's house
[45:30] Matthew was a tax collector he was he
[45:33] had a lot of money and he would throw
[45:35] parties and in those parties would be
[45:37] all kinds of different people includ
[45:39] including
[45:40] prostitutes but even the prostitutes
[45:43] when they heard the word and there was
[45:46] some representation in them they
[45:48] responded to the word amen We're Not
[45:51] Looking for clean fish we're looking for
[45:54] children of God they're bound up
[45:57] they're they're they're messed up
[45:58] they're in these these these vessels of
[46:01] clay that are all messed up because of
[46:03] upbringing and and and and environment
[46:06] people that have been born into families
[46:08] that are broken molested all kinds of
[46:12] problems and situations but listen that
[46:15] is not what that doesn't scare the
[46:19] Lord he's looking for he says I didn't
[46:22] come for those that needed no physician
[46:24] he says I come for those that need a
[46:26] physician
[46:27] that need to be set free that need to be
[46:30] healed just go back and and read about
[46:33] the woman at the well when when when she
[46:35] finally woke up to realize that this is
[46:37] the Messiah he just told me all about
[46:40] myself my whole life you think it
[46:43] mattered anymore that she had been with
[46:45] five husbands and the one that she was
[46:47] with wasn't even
[46:49] hers it didn't matter she went back into
[46:52] Samaria and the Bible says that she
[46:54] converted that City by her test
[46:57] testimony amen people were converted
[47:00] people people knew that she had been
[47:02] with Jesus and if you've had that true
[47:05] experience people will know that you've
[47:07] been with
[47:08] Jesus amen praise God he's usually
[47:11] outside of the camp he'll go to places
[47:14] like like he went to Zak's house when
[47:16] when Jesus was walking along and zakas
[47:19] said hey you know zakus was a man with
[47:21] money and he thought man this guy's
[47:23] doing some Miracles maybe he can
[47:26] multiply my
[47:27] M I'm going to invite him into my house
[47:30] but no zakas when he started to hear the
[47:33] word and and the word started to strike
[47:35] his heart he was looking for ways to
[47:37] give it away he was saying wait a minute
[47:39] here oh boy I got to give back the money
[47:41] I stole from this person I got to give
[47:43] back this one I got to take care he he
[47:45] come to realize this is The Real McCoy
[47:48] this is Jehovah God and then and then in
[47:50] the midst of that little gathering here
[47:52] comes the a prostitute with some
[47:55] ointment and she comes and she washes
[47:57] the the Lord's feet with her tears and
[48:01] wipes it with her hair and Jesus said
[48:04] sin no more your sins are forgiven you
[48:07] they were shocked how can this man po
[48:11] how could he say your sins are
[48:14] forgiven he's still saying it today he's
[48:17] saying you're Justified if you receive
[48:20] this word you're Justified your sin has
[48:23] no more power over you from this day
[48:26] from this moment your life can be
[48:28] transformed and you can walk free
[48:30] Justified means you never done it in the
[48:33] first place God doesn't just forget your
[48:36] sin he wipes it and places it into the
[48:39] sea of his forgetfulness that he himself
[48:43] will not even remember amen you'll
[48:46] remember because the devil his job is to
[48:48] come and tell you all about what you did
[48:50] and remind you so he can keep you into a
[48:53] condition of condemnation but the
[48:56] scripture says there is therefore no
[48:57] more condemnation to them that are in
[49:02] Christ
[49:04] hallelujah amen and then we looked at
[49:08] the third thing and this is where we're
[49:10] going to continue on it will be bigger
[49:12] than we were
[49:14] expecting when he comes and when he does
[49:17] something whether it's in your own
[49:20] personal life or here on Earth it is
[49:24] going to be bigger and greater than
[49:27] anything that has ever happened in the
[49:30] past on this
[49:33] Earth this is greater than any other
[49:39] Christmas why it's that much
[49:42] closer to
[49:44] fulfillment of his next stage of the
[49:48] word of God where this world enters into
[49:51] 1,000 years of
[49:53] Peace where this world is going to be uh
[49:56] uh uh set free from the power of of
[50:00] Satan's uh
[50:02] oppression don't tell me you don't see
[50:04] it listen I'm not talking Hocus Pocus
[50:06] here okay we're talking we're talking
[50:09] reality there's people out there that
[50:11] are under mental oppression they don't
[50:13] know what to do they're thinking suicide
[50:16] all day long there's Nations that are
[50:19] falling apart there's cities and and and
[50:22] and countries that are in complete and
[50:24] total turmoil this morning
[50:27] amen this is not just just talk this is
[50:31] a
[50:32] reality the world is entering into a
[50:35] time of Great Tribulation like has never
[50:39] been seen before who would have ever
[50:42] thought that we would experience the
[50:45] kind of things that we did just in the
[50:46] last five years the whole world was shut
[50:49] down by one plague the whole world was
[50:53] globally was shut down people couldn't
[50:55] fly they couldn't do anything they
[50:57] couldn't go out they had to be they had
[50:59] to be locked up in their homes who would
[51:01] have ever thought that that could have
[51:03] happened but it
[51:05] did and these are only the birth Pains
[51:09] of things that are beginning to take
[51:12] place upon the Earth and there's only
[51:14] one safe place and that place is in
[51:17] Christ amen and so it'll be bigger and
[51:22] greater amen There's a Great Awakening
[51:25] right now that's taking place
[51:27] in the true church I know you hear that
[51:30] statement but there has to be a true
[51:32] church and a false church because the
[51:36] Bible says there was light and there was
[51:38] Darkness without the light you couldn't
[51:40] know that there was darkness and without
[51:42] the darkness you couldn't know that
[51:43] there was
[51:46] light
[51:47] amen and so this is going to be big
[51:51] praise God but I want you to know that
[51:53] the the world is is in a is in a state
[51:56] of conf Fusion because of all the
[51:58] different
[52:00] religions you've got all kinds of
[52:03] teachings but there was only one person
[52:07] that walked on this Earth that said I am
[52:12] the way the truth and the
[52:16] life he was the only one that history
[52:20] tells us was
[52:22] crucified and rose from the dead
[52:26] there was a purpose in all of that
[52:30] people will will will tell you about all
[52:33] their theories of how the world in the
[52:36] universe and how God is operating and
[52:39] how this world is is is moving into
[52:42] higher forms of Consciousness and
[52:45] understanding about God yes they are but
[52:49] the moment that they leave out the way
[52:52] the truth and the life they miss
[52:55] everything am because Jesus was the only
[52:59] one that said I am the way the truth and
[53:03] the life we cannot leave him out of the
[53:07] formula in any way shape or form if we
[53:11] do and we do not make him almighty
[53:15] God we miss it all cuz he's
[53:21] our
[53:24] Escape he's the body if you want to if
[53:27] you want to look at it as like a like a
[53:29] spaceship that you need to get into that
[53:32] ship you need to be in fellowship with
[53:35] the Lord
[53:36] Jesus and the Lord is his word this is
[53:40] the thing we're not trying to be
[53:42] religious Jesus wasn't even religious
[53:44] come
[53:46] on come on that's a strong statement
[53:49] people say oh man you're so religious
[53:51] you're too you're too zealous about
[53:53] Jesus Jesus was not even religious
[53:57] show me in the scriptures where he went
[54:00] to all the
[54:02] priests where he didn't rebuke
[54:06] them where he challenged them where he
[54:09] said
[54:11] fools they looked at him one day and
[54:13] said when he was talking to the
[54:14] Pharisees and and and a group of them
[54:17] and and they were they looked at Jesus
[54:19] they said we are the children of
[54:22] Abraham Jesus looked at them and said
[54:24] what you're the children of Abra
[54:27] Abraham if you were the children of
[54:29] Abraham you would know me and you would
[54:32] love
[54:34] me but you hate
[54:36] me I can tell by the way you're talking
[54:40] by the way you're you're you're you're
[54:41] you're you're talking about me amongst
[54:43] the people you want to kill
[54:46] me you go back and read it in St John
[54:51] chapter 8 I'll even read it for you St
[54:54] John chapter 8
[54:57] Jesus turned around and
[55:00] said ye verse 44 ye are of your father
[55:05] the devil this is why they're having
[55:07] that
[55:08] conversation he says and the lust of
[55:11] your father you will do he was a
[55:14] murderer from the beginning who was the
[55:16] first murderer in the
[55:18] Bible
[55:20] Cain that's why Cain was not a son of
[55:24] Adam he was a son of the
[55:27] serpent we're not going to get into all
[55:29] that you you know you can go back and
[55:32] and and look it wasn't an apple that Eve
[55:35] sinned by it was an
[55:38] adultery and two children were brought
[55:40] for Cain and Abel he was a murderer from
[55:43] the beginning and Abode not in the truth
[55:45] because there is no truth in him when he
[55:49] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[55:52] for he is a liar and the father of it
[55:57] who was the one that went to Eve and
[55:58] said hath God said that the day you eat
[56:01] thereof you shall surely die that was
[56:04] the serpent talking wasn't a snake it
[56:07] was an upright being it was a man and he
[56:10] was talking to her like the way you and
[56:13] I are talking right now and he was
[56:15] telling her you know has God said that
[56:17] he quoted the word he knew the word but
[56:20] he deceived her into believing that she
[56:24] could be like God that's why you know a
[56:27] lot of people today they want to talk
[56:29] about you know coming into their into
[56:33] their consciousness of of God that they
[56:36] that they because a lot of people listen
[56:38] this is the time Daniel talked about
[56:40] where information and knowledge would
[56:43] increase and the revelation of the word
[56:46] is coming to places in our lives where
[56:49] we're recognizing this is more than just
[56:52] church this is more than just gathering
[56:55] together and and and and reading the
[56:57] Bible this is more than just you know
[57:00] some people coming together I'm a
[57:01] Christian no no this is about you
[57:04] becoming one with the word you becoming
[57:06] an expression of the word because the
[57:09] spirit comes in you and you manifest it
[57:12] this is so much greater so much greater
[57:16] but but but but the people they want to
[57:19] make it like it's just
[57:22] church and they've got an explanation on
[57:25] how the universe works and how how
[57:29] everything evolved and how you know no
[57:32] listen if somebody comes to you and
[57:35] gives you an understanding on the
[57:38] universe and how everything was created
[57:41] and how you are a part of that
[57:44] creation and they tell you that and you
[57:47] say to them but you know what because
[57:49] this is what they're saying about
[57:51] Christians and about churches and about
[57:53] religion they're saying it's a way to
[57:57] keep them
[57:59] distracted into thinking that that's
[58:03] going to be the way to make it out of
[58:06] here that that it's not about joining a
[58:09] church and believing in the Lord Jesus
[58:12] and that he died for them on the
[58:15] cross they will not talk about the
[58:18] crucifixion they will not talk about him
[58:22] coming as he started as God come into
[58:25] human human flesh to become God so that
[58:29] he could redeem his own cuz Redemption
[58:32] the whole Plan of Redemption is to bring
[58:34] back that which was already his only
[58:37] those that are his are going
[58:40] back but when they tell you oh but you
[58:42] don't need to list oh Jesus yeah Jesus
[58:45] was he he was a great Master he reached
[58:48] very high levels of consciousness and
[58:50] understanding and we can do the same you
[58:53] know what that's the same serpent that
[58:56] that said you can be like
[58:59] God but he doesn't realize that inside
[59:03] of you is a portion of
[59:06] God and you can't deny the word because
[59:10] you are a part of that word and when the
[59:13] word comes forth like it's coming forth
[59:15] now in in our day and it's bringing
[59:18] truth because remember Jesus hasn't
[59:20] changed he says I am the way the truth
[59:23] and the life he said to the woman at the
[59:26] well the day will come that I'm going to
[59:28] be worshiped in spirit and in truth you
[59:32] can't just have all
[59:35] spirit and partial truth you need the
[59:39] whole truth about who Jesus Christ is
[59:43] that's why he said on that day ye shall
[59:44] know that I am in the father ye in me
[59:47] and I in you that's the greater thing
[59:51] that we're building on that we're
[59:53] growing into that we're going to
[59:55] manifest that will bring forth the body
[59:58] change and the Rapture of the
[1:00:01] church and so that's the same old Spirit
[1:00:04] when they tell you oh Jesus he was you
[1:00:07] know he he he was just you know
[1:00:10] crucifixion well I asked that question
[1:00:12] to somebody and they came back to me and
[1:00:13] said well you know what I agree with
[1:00:16] everything that you're saying about you
[1:00:17] know about um becoming one with with
[1:00:21] with God and everything else I'm just
[1:00:22] not sure about this crucifixion thing
[1:00:27] you see they fail to
[1:00:30] recognize the
[1:00:33] antidote that without him becoming man
[1:00:37] and going to the Cross to to fulfill his
[1:00:41] own word because he cannot heavens and
[1:00:43] earth will pass away if a man sins a man
[1:00:46] must die there had to be a
[1:00:49] sacrifice oh you're putting it into a
[1:00:51] metaphor it's only just signs and it's
[1:00:54] all yeah it's all those things but
[1:00:56] without that sacrifice and without
[1:00:58] Christ when he said at the cross it is
[1:01:01] finished there'd be no spirit of God
[1:01:05] Holy Ghost to come back upon the church
[1:01:08] the True Believers so that they could
[1:01:11] read and understand the word of God
[1:01:13] they' they'd fall for the lies of the
[1:01:17] devil all the teachings of the enemy
[1:01:20] because Jesus said I will send you the
[1:01:22] comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he
[1:01:25] he will guide you into all truth remove
[1:01:29] the Holy Ghost and just make it science
[1:01:33] and teaching and you are not going to be
[1:01:35] able to discern
[1:01:37] truth it's only the spirit of God in you
[1:01:41] that can actually read that's why the
[1:01:43] Bible says the letter kills but the
[1:01:45] spirit gives life and it opens the
[1:01:49] understanding of the word of God amen
[1:01:52] amen praise God and so here let's move
[1:01:55] along here let's read our next scripture
[1:01:59] because you know um just just this
[1:02:01] morning the Lord led me to make some
[1:02:04] changes you know and and here so in
[1:02:07] Joshua chap 1: 8 to9 this book of the
[1:02:11] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[1:02:14] but Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:02:18] night amen that thou mayest observe to
[1:02:21] do according to all that is written
[1:02:24] therein
[1:02:27] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:02:29] prosperous and then Thou shalt have good
[1:02:32] success have I not commanded thee be
[1:02:35] strong and of good
[1:02:37] courage Be not Afraid neither be thou
[1:02:40] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[1:02:43] thee withersoever thou goest amen praise
[1:02:47] God you know um when I was reading this
[1:02:50] it brought me right back to you know
[1:02:52] Joshua and Caleb in the days when God
[1:02:55] God delivered the children of
[1:02:58] Israel now you know God had given
[1:03:03] Joshua God had given Moses a commission
[1:03:05] and said that that he was going to take
[1:03:07] the people out of Egypt and he did it
[1:03:10] exactly the way God said he was going to
[1:03:13] do it all the odds were against Moses so
[1:03:17] that's why he'll do things in ways that
[1:03:19] you don't expect him to do it but
[1:03:22] recognize what took place there and and
[1:03:24] there's a there's a point here I want I
[1:03:26] want to uh elaborate on as we we move
[1:03:28] through this because we're going to read
[1:03:30] some scriptures but recognize that Moses
[1:03:35] all the odds were against him but when
[1:03:36] he stood before Pharaoh he didn't say
[1:03:39] set my people free I am Mo god listen
[1:03:43] Pharaoh knew who Moses was he knew who
[1:03:46] he was what are you doing here Moses are
[1:03:50] you crazy you're coming against my
[1:03:53] armies but he had thus sayith the Lord
[1:03:55] he had the word the message for that day
[1:03:59] Moses was the message for that moment
[1:04:02] that hour that was going to liberate and
[1:04:04] set the people free regardless of the
[1:04:07] circumstances God was with him and then
[1:04:11] God when Moses went off the scene and
[1:04:13] they went into the Wilderness they were
[1:04:15] 40 years in the
[1:04:17] wilderness and I want you to notice
[1:04:19] something and I want you to I want you
[1:04:21] to see a correlation here because we've
[1:04:24] been Christians for many many many years
[1:04:27] there's all kinds of tribes out there
[1:04:30] and just like the children of Israel
[1:04:31] when they came out of Egypt there was
[1:04:33] all kinds of tribes all kinds of
[1:04:35] different churches and they they all got
[1:04:37] together differently at night but they
[1:04:39] had believed what Moses had told them
[1:04:41] they knew that the pillar of fire that
[1:04:44] the word was with them they saw it but
[1:04:48] it wasn't a reality to
[1:04:50] them oh my goodness but Joshua was given
[1:04:54] the commission now to take them into the
[1:04:56] promised land and Joshua was and and and
[1:05:00] and and God said as I was with Moses and
[1:05:03] Joshua remembered everything that God
[1:05:05] did with
[1:05:06] Moses just like we can remember all that
[1:05:09] God did with William brandham in the
[1:05:10] 20th century when he brought the word of
[1:05:13] God and and and the churches were all
[1:05:15] stirred up he was the Moses of our day
[1:05:19] amen and there's a Joshua commission
[1:05:22] that is in operation in this day amen
[1:05:25] and we need to recognize that as God was
[1:05:28] with Moses he told Joshua I will be with
[1:05:31] you you just need to be strong and
[1:05:33] courageous you need to be willing to to
[1:05:36] to come under headship to the Joshua
[1:05:40] commission which is now the fivefold
[1:05:42] ministry Christ in the five-fold
[1:05:44] ministry ministering his word calling
[1:05:47] and placing because Joshua was placing
[1:05:50] the children of God Amen but I want you
[1:05:53] to notice here we're going to read here
[1:05:55] now from from
[1:05:57] Hebrews uh chapter
[1:05:59] 3:
[1:06:01] 1-19 you go to the next slide and we'll
[1:06:04] just we'll just look at each aspect of
[1:06:06] it wherefore now pay attention here
[1:06:08] because this jumped out at me this
[1:06:09] morning and I had to add it all in to
[1:06:11] the whole
[1:06:13] message wherefore holy Brethren
[1:06:15] partakers of the Heavenly calling
[1:06:18] consider the Apostle and the high priest
[1:06:21] of our profession Christ what am I
[1:06:24] preaching about here this morning
[1:06:26] about him okay so he's always reminding
[1:06:30] us go back to the word go back to Christ
[1:06:36] get your foundation right who was
[1:06:38] faithful to him that appointed him as
[1:06:42] also Moses was faithful in all his
[1:06:45] house you see he's he's holding that
[1:06:49] that that correlation here because it
[1:06:50] was the word it was God that was with
[1:06:53] Moses it was God that was in Christ
[1:06:57] for this man was counted worthy of more
[1:06:59] Glory than Moses this was this is Jes
[1:07:02] this is God
[1:07:04] himself when Moses went up before
[1:07:06] pharaoh and said thus sayeth the Lord
[1:07:08] that was God's voice speaking out of
[1:07:12] Moses it wasn't Moses's voice it was
[1:07:16] God's voice set my people free it was
[1:07:20] God when when Moses took the staff and
[1:07:22] called for fleas called for the frogs
[1:07:25] called for the plagues and finally
[1:07:27] called for the death
[1:07:30] angel it wasn't Moses yes sir it was God
[1:07:34] it's always been
[1:07:36] God and he says in as much as he hath
[1:07:39] builded the house hath more honor than
[1:07:42] the house for every house is builded by
[1:07:45] some man but he that built all things is
[1:07:49] god so let's get it all straight here
[1:07:51] we're not looking for anybody else to
[1:07:53] build the church we're not looking for
[1:07:56] anybody else to to to to to uh bring the
[1:07:59] body of Christ and each position into
[1:08:02] their rightful positions it's all going
[1:08:04] to be God himself let's move on next
[1:08:08] slide and Moses verily was faithful in
[1:08:11] all his house as a servant for a
[1:08:14] testimony of those things which were to
[1:08:17] be spoken after Moses when he was
[1:08:20] converted and he had that burning bush
[1:08:22] experience let me tell you he went with
[1:08:25] confidence he met with God he had a
[1:08:28] conference with God until you come to
[1:08:30] that place in your life where you meet
[1:08:32] with God where you come face to face
[1:08:34] with the word of God you're not going to
[1:08:37] have the same kind of
[1:08:39] confidence but Christ as a son over his
[1:08:42] own house whose house are
[1:08:46] we did you read
[1:08:48] that Christ has his own house it's the
[1:08:51] body am the body of Christ is the house
[1:08:56] of
[1:08:57] God amen amen and if we hold fast the
[1:09:01] confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope
[1:09:03] firm unto the end wherefore as the Holy
[1:09:08] Ghost saith now pay attention here as
[1:09:11] the Holy Ghost saith
[1:09:14] today not
[1:09:16] yesterday
[1:09:18] today if thou will hear his
[1:09:23] voice this has been the aspect that has
[1:09:26] been missed all along and that's why to
[1:09:30] put Jesus Christ on the outside of the
[1:09:32] camp and not recognize him in the very
[1:09:36] element that he is almighty
[1:09:39] God but now in the form of a church in a
[1:09:44] in a mystical
[1:09:46] body to reject that voice is to miss
[1:09:52] everything because Caleb and Joshua
[1:09:55] they had heard exactly what was
[1:09:58] delivered to to from Moses yes and they
[1:10:02] believed it they didn't care listen they
[1:10:05] listen all the children of Israel when
[1:10:07] those spies went in to spy out the land
[1:10:09] and they saw all the Giants and and how
[1:10:12] Jericho was surrounded and the walls and
[1:10:14] everything else and the armies they said
[1:10:16] are we are you kidding me we're like
[1:10:17] ants to these to these soldiers and
[1:10:20] there's no way we could take the land
[1:10:23] it's the same thing today you've got
[1:10:25] nine you've got 98% of the churches that
[1:10:28] are preaching Jesus Christ believing
[1:10:31] that that but but yet you come to them
[1:10:33] and you you give them the Simplicity of
[1:10:36] of of the the fact that God is one and
[1:10:38] that baptism do you know that 98% of the
[1:10:42] churches out there baptized in the name
[1:10:44] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:10:46] Holy
[1:10:48] Ghost which is an
[1:10:50] absolute wrong
[1:10:52] baptism because they're accepting a
[1:10:55] trinitarian Doctrine believing that God
[1:10:58] is three in
[1:10:59] one nonsense there's only one baptism
[1:11:02] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:04] Christ fully immersed into the
[1:11:08] water but yet in niasia 3:25 they
[1:11:12] changed the baptism and they adopted
[1:11:15] baptism into the titles of Father Son
[1:11:18] and Holy Ghost and to this day they hold
[1:11:22] on to those doctrines not recognizing
[1:11:24] that it's actually
[1:11:25] an aspect of the mark of the
[1:11:28] beast because it's it's they've they've
[1:11:31] consciously
[1:11:33] accepted a wrong doctrine of who God
[1:11:36] actually is and by believing the LIE
[1:11:39] they'll perish let's read
[1:11:41] on but it says here now watch he says
[1:11:45] hear his voice Harden not your hearts as
[1:11:48] in provocation in other words
[1:11:50] provocation is like you know an action
[1:11:52] or speak speech that makes somebody uh
[1:11:55] you know annoyed or get angry because
[1:11:58] when you hear this word you know people
[1:12:01] people get get you know excited and and
[1:12:04] angry sometimes they say oh you think
[1:12:06] you know Danny no I don't think I know
[1:12:08] anything but I can show you scripturally
[1:12:11] that there was 8,000 baptisms in the
[1:12:14] book of Acts alone and every one of them
[1:12:16] was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:18] I say you show me one place in the
[1:12:20] scripture amen because God left his word
[1:12:24] as evidence and he said my word let
[1:12:27] every man's word be a lie but my word be
[1:12:30] the truth God is not going to judge
[1:12:33] based on what you think or what this
[1:12:35] church thinks or what that church
[1:12:37] believes he's going to judge according
[1:12:39] to his
[1:12:40] word and how does your life look when it
[1:12:43] when when you put it in the mirror of
[1:12:44] God's word is your experience like that
[1:12:46] or not it's simple if it isn't get with
[1:12:50] it he still he says but don't harden
[1:12:53] yourself in the day of Temptation in the
[1:12:56] wilderness because a lot of people are
[1:12:58] are still in the wilderness oh there's
[1:13:01] all kinds of people going to church but
[1:13:03] you sit down and try to have a real
[1:13:05] conversation about God about salvation
[1:13:08] about their lives and and how salvation
[1:13:11] and how important it is and and really
[1:13:13] really you know sit and and get serious
[1:13:16] about the word and they can only go so
[1:13:18] far and then they'll say nah you're
[1:13:20] going too personal you're getting too
[1:13:24] close to to me it's not me you got to
[1:13:28] let him in he's the one don't Harden
[1:13:32] your heart that's the that's the whole
[1:13:35] aspect of you know this what's going on
[1:13:37] at Christmas right now but there's a lot
[1:13:39] of people in the wilderness with
[1:13:40] hardened Hearts let's read on here he
[1:13:43] goes on here and he says when your
[1:13:44] fathers tempted
[1:13:47] me proved me and saw my Works 40 years
[1:13:52] wherefore I grieved with that generation
[1:13:55] and said they always ear in their heart
[1:13:58] and they have not known my ways here he
[1:14:03] was constantly Moses was constantly
[1:14:05] going before the people constantly
[1:14:07] bringing them the word of God constantly
[1:14:09] revealing truth to them but they got
[1:14:12] caught up into the
[1:14:13] worldliness they got caught up into into
[1:14:16] the teachings of the world if listen the
[1:14:20] majority is always wrong
[1:14:26] that's that's a strong statement but
[1:14:29] guess what there the majority now I'm
[1:14:32] not saying in
[1:14:33] everything especially when it comes to
[1:14:37] politics cuz they're both corrupt both
[1:14:39] sides you can't find a you know it's
[1:14:43] it's corruption at the highest levels
[1:14:45] when when you're looking at into
[1:14:47] government but there's but it's also
[1:14:49] there for a purpose and we need to
[1:14:51] submit okay as as the word of God says
[1:14:54] you know to submit to our higher
[1:14:57] authorities according to the word of
[1:15:01] God and so we need to realize that that
[1:15:06] these people that were in the wilderness
[1:15:08] they they saw the pillar of fire they
[1:15:10] saw what God was doing they saw the
[1:15:12] Miracles but notice what happened after
[1:15:15] 40 years he said so I swear in my wrath
[1:15:20] they shall not enter into my rest take
[1:15:23] heed Brethren lest there be in any of
[1:15:27] you an evil heart of unbelief in
[1:15:30] departing from the Living God the word
[1:15:34] for our day am be careful he was telling
[1:15:38] them that you know that that that
[1:15:41] listen it wasn't a matter of how sincere
[1:15:44] they were there's churches they're
[1:15:46] sincere they're sincerely serving God to
[1:15:49] the best of their ability but when truth
[1:15:52] comes to them in in its in its absolute
[1:15:57] if there's representation of Christ in
[1:15:59] them just like like they will love the
[1:16:03] truth they will love the truth they will
[1:16:06] not hate the truth if the truth is
[1:16:09] revealed they will love it amen and and
[1:16:12] the truth is the Living Word in the
[1:16:15] Living God in this day and in this hour
[1:16:17] but he says now watch he goes on to say
[1:16:19] here but exhort one another daily that's
[1:16:21] what we're doing that's why we come
[1:16:23] together to Fellowship around the word
[1:16:25] to exhort the people on the word of God
[1:16:29] while it is called
[1:16:31] today because this is a new day this is
[1:16:35] the message for
[1:16:37] today that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:16:39] yesterday today and forever amen and he
[1:16:43] says lest any of you be hardened through
[1:16:46] deceitfulness of sin sin is
[1:16:50] unbelief sin is when somebody
[1:16:53] says listen drinking smoking all those
[1:16:57] lying cheating all those things that's
[1:16:59] not
[1:17:00] sin those are the attributes of sin the
[1:17:04] reason people do those things is because
[1:17:06] they don't believe the word if they
[1:17:09] believe the word they would do it
[1:17:12] according to the word amen it would not
[1:17:15] be it would that's where people get
[1:17:19] confused and they think that sin is is
[1:17:22] all the all the attributes no you need
[1:17:25] to get to the root cause of why sin is
[1:17:29] in your life it's because of
[1:17:33] unbelief unbelief any form of unbelief
[1:17:36] listen MOS listen Joshua and Caleb they
[1:17:40] heard the report of those other 10 spies
[1:17:43] they saw those Giants and they saw the
[1:17:45] armies that they would have to go up
[1:17:47] against but they believed the
[1:17:50] word they believed their Prophet they
[1:17:54] believed believe the message for their
[1:17:56] day which said I'm giving you that
[1:17:58] Promised Land but because the people
[1:18:01] didn't believe wow what look it he goes
[1:18:03] on to say he says for we are made
[1:18:06] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[1:18:08] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:18:11] under the end if that if that experience
[1:18:13] with Christ is a reality in your life
[1:18:16] you're going to hold it right to the end
[1:18:18] you're not going to be thwarted or
[1:18:20] convinced you know to come to this
[1:18:22] church no don't go to that church you
[1:18:23] need to go to this church you don't go
[1:18:25] to church to listen to the man you go to
[1:18:27] church to have the word speak to your
[1:18:31] heart that's what Jesus meant when he
[1:18:34] said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[1:18:37] when he said who do you say that I am
[1:18:39] people say that God is there's all kinds
[1:18:42] of different definitions of Jesus Christ
[1:18:44] out there Trinity Oneness this that all
[1:18:47] these other but Jesus he knew he looked
[1:18:50] he says Peter who do you say that I am
[1:18:52] he said Thou Art the Christ the the son
[1:18:55] of the Living God you are the Messiah
[1:18:57] you are God the word made flesh and
[1:19:00] Jesus looked and said Flesh and Blood
[1:19:01] hasn't revealed this to you you didn't
[1:19:03] learn it in church you didn't learn it
[1:19:05] from your parents you didn't learn he
[1:19:07] says but my father the spirit when Jesus
[1:19:10] says my father he's talking about
[1:19:12] himself that's why when philli said Lord
[1:19:15] show us the father Jesus looks he says
[1:19:17] Phillip have I been with you so long if
[1:19:19] you see me you seen the
[1:19:21] father it's so clear but you see you got
[1:19:24] to open your understanding to believe
[1:19:26] the word people I got to see it to
[1:19:30] believe it no you need to believe it if
[1:19:32] you really want to see it that's how God
[1:19:35] works you need to believe it first and
[1:19:38] then God will vindicate and confirm his
[1:19:40] word to you whether it's Truth Or Not
[1:19:44] amen praise God and so the whole aspect
[1:19:48] is that we need to hold fast while it is
[1:19:50] said today if you will hear his voice
[1:19:53] see how he he he brings it in again Paul
[1:19:56] brings it clearly here to the Hebrews
[1:19:58] while it is said today this message if
[1:20:02] you will hear his voice Harden not your
[1:20:04] hearts as in the
[1:20:07] provocation for some when they had heard
[1:20:10] did
[1:20:12] provoke how be it not all that came out
[1:20:15] of Egypt by
[1:20:17] Moses let's read the last few verses but
[1:20:21] with whom was he grieved 40 years
[1:20:26] was it not with them that had sinned
[1:20:29] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:20:32] those that
[1:20:34] disbelieved and to whom swear he that
[1:20:37] they should not enter into his rest but
[1:20:40] to them that believed
[1:20:43] not wasn't how sincere they were it's
[1:20:46] not how sincere the churches are it's
[1:20:48] not how sincere they get together and
[1:20:51] they they they give to the poor and and
[1:20:53] yes those are all all good things and we
[1:20:55] should do all of those things but when
[1:20:58] it comes down to when the when the Great
[1:21:01] Reckoning takes place and the and the
[1:21:03] word of God comes to its fulfillment
[1:21:06] here on this Earth and and the Rapture
[1:21:09] of the church takes place it's going to
[1:21:12] be a
[1:21:14] few and the the rest of the churches
[1:21:16] will probably not even miss
[1:21:19] you because you're such a little flock
[1:21:22] Jesus says Little
[1:21:26] Flock it's not a big flock just go back
[1:21:30] and look through the scriptures you'll
[1:21:31] see it over and over and over again the
[1:21:34] minority was the ones that God was with
[1:21:38] when Jesus himself walked on Earth there
[1:21:40] was a dozen people that were following
[1:21:43] him think about it Saints he doesn't
[1:21:46] change but look what he says here it was
[1:21:49] those that believe not so we can see
[1:21:52] that they could not enter in because of
[1:21:57] unbelief this has always been a fight
[1:22:00] between faith and unbelief go back to
[1:22:03] the Garden of Eden Abel by faith because
[1:22:08] he was a Son of God a son of Abel a son
[1:22:11] of Adam he knew that it would require a
[1:22:14] lamb to bring to the altar because he
[1:22:17] knew that it was sin and there would
[1:22:20] have to be a lamb that would be the Lamb
[1:22:22] of God to take away the sins of the
[1:22:24] world World Cain goes and gets flowers
[1:22:27] goes and gets the fruit of the field
[1:22:29] goes and gets all the beauty because
[1:22:31] Satan is in all the beauty of this world
[1:22:33] all the beauty that comes out of
[1:22:35] Hollywood all the Fashions you see women
[1:22:38] now the way they dress and they they you
[1:22:40] know they go to parties the new fashion
[1:22:42] today is basically naked just a
[1:22:46] sheer piece of clothing that shows
[1:22:49] everything else and this is today's
[1:22:52] fashion you see back in the Garden of
[1:22:54] Eden Adam and Eve had no clothes they
[1:22:57] were shielded by the Holy Ghost before
[1:22:59] the fall that's why you'll notice in
[1:23:02] Genesis that after they had sinned God
[1:23:05] goes looking for them and they had to
[1:23:07] hide themselves and God says why are you
[1:23:09] hiding
[1:23:10] yourselves he says because we're naked
[1:23:14] well who the heck told them they were
[1:23:15] naked why did their eyes open to be
[1:23:18] naked all of a sudden because it was a
[1:23:20] sex act in the Garden of Eden and they
[1:23:23] knew what they had done and they were
[1:23:24] trying to cover it they covered
[1:23:26] themselves with fig
[1:23:29] leaves it's so clear scripturally the
[1:23:33] condition of the world and why unbelief
[1:23:35] and and and and the level of
[1:23:37] understanding on the word of God that
[1:23:39] it's always been a battle between faith
[1:23:42] and
[1:23:43] unbelief but Jesus said here as we carry
[1:23:47] on I will not next scripture I will not
[1:23:51] leave you
[1:23:53] comfortless I I will come to
[1:23:56] you yet a little while and the world
[1:23:58] seeth me no more but you shall see
[1:24:02] me you will know because I live you
[1:24:06] shall live also and at that day ye shall
[1:24:09] know that I am in my father and you in
[1:24:11] me and I in
[1:24:14] you this is the greater thing that he is
[1:24:18] doing now but if there's Hardness of
[1:24:22] Heart if there's doctrines of man and
[1:24:26] teachings of man and well my church does
[1:24:29] it this way I ask a person are you a
[1:24:32] Christian well I'm a Baptist I said no
[1:24:34] are you a Christian well I go to a
[1:24:36] Baptist Church they're Christians I said
[1:24:39] but are you a Christian or are you a
[1:24:43] Baptist this is a Christian Church the
[1:24:46] reason why we're Christian churches in
[1:24:49] this message is because we follow Christ
[1:24:52] the word we don't follow man's teaching
[1:24:56] you go to the Catholic Church you go see
[1:24:58] the priest they tell you you need to go
[1:25:00] and confess your sin which is a nonsense
[1:25:03] you show me in the Bible where that is
[1:25:06] okay it's nowhere to be found where you
[1:25:08] got to go to a priest to confess your
[1:25:10] sins Jesus is the high priest he took
[1:25:14] all your sin right to the cross and he
[1:25:15] nailed it to the cross and he said it's
[1:25:18] finished so don't let anybody bring up
[1:25:21] your your your past once you've come to
[1:25:23] Christ and you've accepted him as the
[1:25:25] priest and the high priest and the Lord
[1:25:27] over your life you're forgiven you're
[1:25:29] washed you never done it in the first
[1:25:31] place you get a brand new life that's
[1:25:33] why they say you're born
[1:25:36] again I know they want to put all kinds
[1:25:38] of nonsense oh you're so religious you
[1:25:40] guys are you know what is it har Krishna
[1:25:42] or
[1:25:44] something no we believe the word we're
[1:25:47] not religious we're spiritual because of
[1:25:49] the Holy Ghost that's opened our
[1:25:52] understanding to the word of God in
[1:25:53] simplicity
[1:25:55] there's nothing complicated in what I've
[1:25:58] been saying here this morning it's
[1:26:00] simple word you got to go back to the
[1:26:02] word and see what the word says and the
[1:26:05] word can never ever
[1:26:07] lie amen praise God but it's only by the
[1:26:10] Holy
[1:26:12] Spirit and so people don't realize that
[1:26:16] that this element of God in you this is
[1:26:18] this is the element that that we want to
[1:26:21] take home
[1:26:22] today it's about God in you
[1:26:26] now that's what makes you a Christian
[1:26:28] that's what identifies you in the body
[1:26:31] of
[1:26:32] Christ I go to church but the real
[1:26:35] church is the body of Christ when when
[1:26:39] listen in every Church you're going to
[1:26:40] get three kinds of
[1:26:44] Believers make
[1:26:46] believer
[1:26:48] unbeliever cuz people are going to leave
[1:26:50] and they're never going to come back
[1:26:51] they're going to say that's a bunch of
[1:26:53] nonsense I heard over there today it's
[1:26:55] going to happen in churches all over the
[1:26:57] world they go to church at Christmas
[1:26:59] because oh I should go at Christmas at
[1:27:01] least once I used to do that
[1:27:03] too maybe every other
[1:27:08] year but that's not what it's all
[1:27:11] about it's about coming into that
[1:27:14] relationship with him and realizing that
[1:27:18] he can change your circumstances from
[1:27:22] this day but you got to come in spirit
[1:27:26] and in truth how can a lie potentially
[1:27:30] or possibly help
[1:27:32] you it is only a
[1:27:36] Band-Aid I'll go to church and that will
[1:27:39] at least I can tell people that I've
[1:27:41] been going to church and my life will be
[1:27:45] better no it's between faith and
[1:27:48] unbelief this battle is between faith
[1:27:50] and
[1:27:51] unbelief you know that even as Adam lost
[1:27:55] his inheritance when he fell into that
[1:27:58] sin with Eve he fell out of God's
[1:28:01] program right at that
[1:28:03] moment and all that God has been doing
[1:28:07] all the way from that moment when Adam
[1:28:09] and Eve fell and this whole world
[1:28:12] stepped and fell into time all God has
[1:28:14] been doing is condescending down
[1:28:17] bringing himself back going to make the
[1:28:21] sacrifice so that he could bring his
[1:28:23] children back because Adam and Eve in
[1:28:25] the Garden of Eden they were God
[1:28:29] remember read it in Genesis 2 when God
[1:28:32] created Adam In His Image called their
[1:28:35] name
[1:28:36] Adam Adam and Eve was still Eve wasn't
[1:28:39] even talked about in Genesis 2 but yet
[1:28:42] he called their name Adam because God is
[1:28:46] male and female aspect in his pure
[1:28:51] form but then when Adam fell
[1:28:54] everything fell the whole world fell
[1:28:57] into time he said that day you shall
[1:28:59] surely die well how do we know death
[1:29:02] because of time you know that without
[1:29:05] time there is no
[1:29:07] death death and time go hand in hand and
[1:29:11] that's why we are being restored back to
[1:29:13] our Eternal bodies in the Millennium our
[1:29:17] bodies will not be time bodies they will
[1:29:20] be Eternal theophany bodies the Bible
[1:29:23] talks about it
[1:29:24] shall put on
[1:29:27] immortality amen praise God and so
[1:29:30] people will say to you yeah so so God is
[1:29:33] in you yes God is in me amen so when you
[1:29:36] pray who are you praying
[1:29:39] to you either believe this or you
[1:29:43] don't it gets a little bit you know
[1:29:46] touchy when when when when you talk
[1:29:48] about God in you but you know what the
[1:29:50] problem is the problem is that when
[1:29:53] people people take God in you and they
[1:29:56] mix it with their pride or arrogance it
[1:30:00] brings out a different kind of a
[1:30:02] character it produces the wrong
[1:30:04] character doesn't line up with the word
[1:30:06] of God doesn't show the love of God it
[1:30:09] shows arrogance and that's why people
[1:30:12] that are that are that are coming into
[1:30:14] levels of consciousness high levels of
[1:30:17] understanding in this time because
[1:30:19] knowledge would increase and there are
[1:30:21] people that are coming into the
[1:30:23] understanding of how the Universe works
[1:30:25] and how that everything is energy but
[1:30:28] that energy is God it's his word it's
[1:30:31] his thought when God speaks it it
[1:30:34] manifests and people are benefiting from
[1:30:37] God's laws God's energy of the universe
[1:30:40] that the you know love of Attraction all
[1:30:41] of those things but but what they've
[1:30:44] done is that they've been perverted by
[1:30:46] that lie that Satan said you can be like
[1:30:49] God and that's why you'll see the lives
[1:30:51] that they live and the kind of things
[1:30:54] that they do and the kind of
[1:30:55] manifestation that comes out of their
[1:30:57] lives they'll they'll swear and use the
[1:31:00] FW while they're talking about God in
[1:31:02] the universe and everything else and
[1:31:04] that is the holy ghost that is God
[1:31:07] that's not God that's that old serpent
[1:31:10] back in the
[1:31:11] beginning you see they don't have the
[1:31:14] character they don't have the the their
[1:31:16] their arrogance and their pride that's
[1:31:18] why the scripture said Lucifer Satan he
[1:31:21] was lifted up in Pride
[1:31:24] while he was in heaven and he caused
[1:31:27] one-third of the angels to fall and
[1:31:29] follow him because he wanted to be
[1:31:33] worshiped we're not looking to get
[1:31:35] worship when we say that we are the word
[1:31:38] when be it's the reason why we say we
[1:31:40] are the word is because we are
[1:31:42] manifesting what God Said would happen
[1:31:45] in the end time that there would be a
[1:31:48] church without spot or wrinkle there
[1:31:51] would be a Rapture of a church there
[1:31:53] would be a people that would be
[1:31:55] receiving faith for a Rapture perfect
[1:31:58] Faith because you don't got enough Faith
[1:32:02] you need a supernatural element to be
[1:32:04] spoken into you by the word of God as
[1:32:07] you walk with God that's why Enoch he
[1:32:10] walked with God long enough that the
[1:32:12] Bible says that he walked with God and
[1:32:14] then he wasn't cuz he went in a Rapture
[1:32:18] God moved him from one dimension to the
[1:32:20] other and God's going to move the church
[1:32:22] out of this dimension
[1:32:24] for three and a half years of Great
[1:32:26] Tribulation that's going to strike this
[1:32:28] earth like it or not it's
[1:32:32] coming so God has a plan and so when we
[1:32:35] pray we pray to the god that's in US
[1:32:40] amen that's the kind of confidence that
[1:32:42] we Jesus said it I believe
[1:32:44] it they don't understand it in that way
[1:32:47] listen to Brother Brad says calling
[1:32:49] Jesus on the scene he says now you say
[1:32:51] how could he be God and be man see there
[1:32:56] is the mystery see in body he was man
[1:33:00] he's talking about the Lord Jesus in
[1:33:02] spirit he was
[1:33:05] God see someone asked me said then how
[1:33:10] did then who did he pray to In The
[1:33:13] Garden of
[1:33:14] Gethsemane I said I'll answer you that
[1:33:16] when you answer this do you believe you
[1:33:19] have the Holy
[1:33:22] Ghost a lot of people say oh I got the
[1:33:24] Holy Ghost brother let me tell you and
[1:33:27] then F this F that bing bing boom I've
[1:33:30] talked to people like that and oh yeah I
[1:33:33] got the I'm on the street man I'm I'm
[1:33:36] I'm bringing people to Jesus you should
[1:33:39] see what's going on F this F that bang
[1:33:43] and I'm thinking holy
[1:33:46] smokes if that's the Jesus that's not
[1:33:49] the Jesus I
[1:33:51] know he said that which comes out
[1:33:54] defiles the man not what goes
[1:33:59] in then he says do you believe you got
[1:34:02] the Holy Ghost he said I said then he
[1:34:05] said yes I said then who do you pray
[1:34:09] to where is he at when you are praying
[1:34:12] to him when you claim you got you you
[1:34:15] have him and yet you're praying to him
[1:34:18] see people just they just get some
[1:34:20] little idea and run wild with it you see
[1:34:23] that's that's the way it goes in other
[1:34:25] words they don't really
[1:34:27] believe they don't really believe the
[1:34:31] word and when you really truly honestly
[1:34:34] you've made it your absolute your you
[1:34:37] that's it I'm not talking that you got
[1:34:39] to be perfect let's get this all
[1:34:41] straight here people think you mean I
[1:34:44] got to live by every word that that
[1:34:47] that's in the Bible I got to read those
[1:34:48] Ten Commandments man I I I'll fail every
[1:34:52] single day I fail all the time
[1:34:55] and you fail every single day but Jesus
[1:34:58] knew that you'd be locked up in this
[1:35:00] sinful flesh he says that's why I got to
[1:35:04] bring an antidote for you that when you
[1:35:06] receive it and you truly believe it it's
[1:35:10] not the flesh that's going to make it
[1:35:12] into the kingdom of God flesh and blood
[1:35:15] will not inherit the kingdom of God your
[1:35:19] old crabby nature is going to fall away
[1:35:23] from you when you enter into that other
[1:35:26] dimension and your body's going to be
[1:35:27] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:35:30] an eye you're going to have a brand new
[1:35:31] body that's going to be just like it was
[1:35:33] when you were 21 years old and you will
[1:35:36] be brand new and you will have the
[1:35:38] spirit of Christ you will have the mind
[1:35:40] of Christ you will Express the love of
[1:35:43] God you will be in Fellowship brother
[1:35:45] brandham went into that other
[1:35:48] dimension and when he went there he said
[1:35:50] nothing but perfect love will enter into
[1:35:53] into that place he said I was hugging
[1:35:57] sisters and brothers and even while I
[1:36:00] was hugging the sisters that I saw in
[1:36:02] that other dimension there was no
[1:36:05] sensation there was no sexual sensation
[1:36:08] or
[1:36:09] anything because we are being restored
[1:36:12] back to Adam the first Adam failed the B
[1:36:18] the scripture says but the second Adam
[1:36:21] it can never fail
[1:36:23] is going to resurrect us if the same
[1:36:26] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:36:28] dwell in you it'll
[1:36:29] Quicken your mortal body means it'll
[1:36:32] translate your atoms it'll Quicken your
[1:36:34] atoms by the word and you will just
[1:36:37] translate into that other dimension he
[1:36:40] says you see so we are praying to the
[1:36:43] Lord in
[1:36:45] US you believe
[1:36:48] that when you take food and you know
[1:36:50] people want to make it such a big deal
[1:36:53] listen when I go and I eat and I'm in a
[1:36:55] crowd of people I say thank
[1:36:58] you I bless this in the name of Jesus
[1:37:01] Christ I believe
[1:37:03] it that which you bless shall be blessed
[1:37:06] and that which you curse shall be cursed
[1:37:08] so you got to be careful you got to be
[1:37:10] careful how you use the word of God
[1:37:13] that's why God wants character he
[1:37:14] doesn't want arrogance he doesn't want
[1:37:16] Pride he's not going to let you harness
[1:37:19] the word of God and use and and and and
[1:37:21] and and and and and and take the sword
[1:37:24] of God if you haven't got the
[1:37:26] character God will mold you shape you
[1:37:29] that's why you got to come into the
[1:37:30] house of the Lord that's why we need the
[1:37:32] word of God to mold and shape us cut off
[1:37:35] certain things and most of the stuff
[1:37:37] that's being cut off is our human
[1:37:40] Pride
[1:37:42] arrogance all the things that Satan put
[1:37:45] on this flesh to exalt himself because
[1:37:48] remember he exalts and feeds off the
[1:37:51] people that's what he does does but God
[1:37:56] God's people feed off of him we feed on
[1:37:59] the
[1:38:00] word amen praise God our problem is that
[1:38:04] we get so distracted by religion by
[1:38:07] religious practices by traditions we
[1:38:10] need to break out of those things break
[1:38:12] out of those Traditions amen and know
[1:38:15] that he abides in US glory to God the
[1:38:20] Lord wants us to know that
[1:38:23] you are his victory in this hour when
[1:38:25] you allow the word to manifest through
[1:38:28] your
[1:38:29] life you become his
[1:38:31] victory that's why he wants you to
[1:38:34] recognize the word for your day those
[1:38:37] that walked with Jesus he loved those
[1:38:41] disciples he loved them they were his
[1:38:43] victory they were they were manifesting
[1:38:46] him his word my sheep hear my voice he
[1:38:49] realized those were his
[1:38:52] sheep and we are his sheep in this day
[1:38:54] and in this hour when we recognize the
[1:38:58] word and we allow it to direct and guide
[1:39:01] Our Lives listen here in Christ The
[1:39:03] Mystery of God
[1:39:05] revealed he says justified in his sight
[1:39:09] talking about us why are we Justified we
[1:39:13] are his victory the church is his
[1:39:16] victory we come forth in the last days
[1:39:20] with this glorious gospel showing his
[1:39:23] victory he died for this purpose and we
[1:39:27] are proof of his victory amen when we
[1:39:30] see him coming down and living amongst
[1:39:32] the church that's his victory shows that
[1:39:35] he couldn't keep him among the the uh
[1:39:39] shows that he couldn't keep him in the
[1:39:41] grave and neither can they keep
[1:39:45] us in the graves of denominational
[1:39:48] teachings when the word comes it's going
[1:39:51] to resurrect the Sons and Daughters of
[1:39:53] God Amen because we've raised from the
[1:39:57] dead amen that's right he says unbelief
[1:40:02] already potentially arised because we've
[1:40:05] raised from the dead unbelief in his
[1:40:07] word when you when you step out and you
[1:40:11] say I believe God's word do you know
[1:40:14] that you're showing the resurrection of
[1:40:15] Christ in you you're showing that he's
[1:40:18] in
[1:40:19] you praise God he says unbelief in his
[1:40:23] word from denominational Creeds he says
[1:40:26] to an eternal word of the Eternal God
[1:40:30] which is
[1:40:34] him hisself he says working through US
[1:40:38] manifesting himself that he is the same
[1:40:41] yesterday today and forever and then the
[1:40:43] word moves on down into the body from
[1:40:46] the head what is it the same word
[1:40:49] nothing can be added or taken from it so
[1:40:52] that same word moves from the head as
[1:40:56] the day comes close down into the body
[1:40:59] down into the body vindicating that they
[1:41:02] are
[1:41:04] one they are husband and wife they are
[1:41:08] flesh of his flesh word of his word life
[1:41:12] of his life Spirit of his Spirit see
[1:41:14] amen how do you know it Bears the same
[1:41:17] record the same fruit the same word see
[1:41:21] manifesting Christ the same life the
[1:41:24] same God the same Spirit things that I
[1:41:28] do you also oh Hallelujah he says notice
[1:41:32] he Vindicated the word in his body is
[1:41:37] his very Victory and the reason of his
[1:41:40] death was so that he could live in
[1:41:44] US amen let's go to the next
[1:41:48] slide in Matthew
[1:41:54] 21 he says Jesus answered and said unto
[1:41:56] them verily I say unto you if you have
[1:41:59] faith and you doubt not you shall not
[1:42:03] only do this which is done to the Fig
[1:42:05] Tree but also if you shall say unto this
[1:42:08] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:42:10] cast into the sea it shall be done and
[1:42:13] all things whatsoever ye shall ask in
[1:42:17] prayer believing ye shall receive notice
[1:42:21] how many times he said ye at the top
[1:42:24] there ye shall ye have ye shall ye shall
[1:42:29] ye shall he's talking to
[1:42:31] you amen glory to God that's who he's
[1:42:36] talking to praise God in look he says in
[1:42:40] Luke go to the next slide in Luke
[1:42:43] chapter 17 we're winding down now and
[1:42:45] when he was demanded of the Pharisees
[1:42:48] when the kingdom of God should come he
[1:42:51] answered them and said the kingdom of
[1:42:53] God cometh with not with
[1:42:57] observation it's not going to be in this
[1:43:01] oh Jesus is going to come Jesus came in
[1:43:03] 1963 his second coming was in 1963 on
[1:43:07] Sunset Mountain go back and and look it
[1:43:10] up study it and and study the life of
[1:43:13] William Branham and the opening of The
[1:43:15] Seven Seals this is what we're preaching
[1:43:18] here amen people are looking for the
[1:43:20] second coming of Christ they've missed
[1:43:22] it already
[1:43:23] he's already come and now he's living in
[1:43:26] the body he's come he says that day you
[1:43:29] shall know that I am in in the father ye
[1:43:32] and me and I in you that day has to come
[1:43:35] this is that day there had to be a time
[1:43:38] where we would come to this realization
[1:43:39] but look what he says here he says the
[1:43:41] kingdom
[1:43:43] cometh he says not with observation
[1:43:46] neither shall they say loow here or low
[1:43:48] there for behold the kingdom of God is
[1:43:51] where amen
[1:43:53] in
[1:43:54] you you see there's going to be a people
[1:43:56] that are going to believe
[1:43:58] this they're not going to just read it
[1:44:00] on Sunday and and they're going to just
[1:44:02] oh the kingdom of God is within you oh
[1:44:04] he's in the church he's in the he's in
[1:44:06] this place
[1:44:08] on you either Believe it or you don't
[1:44:11] believe it it's as simple as that it's
[1:44:14] within you he says listen what he says
[1:44:16] here he says in Christ The Mystery of
[1:44:18] God revealed he says then our headship
[1:44:21] is a kingdom
[1:44:24] the kingdom of God is within you and the
[1:44:27] Bible Jesus the kingdom he says we are
[1:44:30] not a denomination we belong to a
[1:44:33] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[1:44:37] God made spirit and life in our own
[1:44:41] life did you hear what I just read the
[1:44:45] kingdom of God is spirit and life made
[1:44:48] flesh in our own
[1:44:51] life amen bringing to pass every promise
[1:44:55] in this day as it did in that day when
[1:44:59] the word of God was
[1:45:01] one and the word and God is one in his
[1:45:06] church today making it the headship of
[1:45:09] the body that is redeemed to bring now
[1:45:12] pay attention to bring the message in
[1:45:14] the last
[1:45:16] day oh glory to God to bring the message
[1:45:21] in the last day
[1:45:23] praise God forever more and be taken up
[1:45:28] from dead in the resurrection to go back
[1:45:32] and restore again now remember what I
[1:45:34] was saying about Adam and Eve to restore
[1:45:36] as Adam and Eve in the beginning In the
[1:45:39] Garden of Eden the three-fold mystery of
[1:45:41] God in his body that's why the Old
[1:45:45] Testament is God above us Jesus comes to
[1:45:49] the Earth in the New Testament God With
[1:45:51] Us and now Jesus goes gives up the Holy
[1:45:55] Ghost so that it can come back down into
[1:45:58] the church and it's what God in
[1:46:02] us hallelujah praise God forever more
[1:46:06] let's read let's read this uh uh next
[1:46:09] scripture
[1:46:10] here in St John or in 1 John 414 he says
[1:46:15] beloved believe not every Spirit that's
[1:46:18] now this is where we you know we we're
[1:46:21] constantly learning from the the
[1:46:23] scriptures and that's why we're in an
[1:46:25] hour now where there's so many spirits
[1:46:28] so many interpretations on the word of
[1:46:30] God let God be his own interpreter in
[1:46:33] your life amen don't try to put on
[1:46:35] anything just be yourself he says don't
[1:46:38] believe every Spirit but try the spirits
[1:46:40] whether they are of God because many
[1:46:43] false prophets are gone out into the
[1:46:45] world and hereby know ye the spirit of
[1:46:49] God pay attention every spirit that can
[1:46:52] confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in
[1:46:56] the flesh is of God so don't think
[1:47:00] because I say that he is now in us that
[1:47:04] I'm giving you some false Doctrine the
[1:47:07] scripture tells you clearly I'm telling
[1:47:09] you he's now in us manifesting and
[1:47:12] bringing the body together for the
[1:47:14] Rapture of the church and every spirit
[1:47:17] that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is
[1:47:21] come in the flesh is not of
[1:47:26] God just telling you what the word says
[1:47:29] and this is the spirit of antichrist it
[1:47:31] tells you right away Antichrist means
[1:47:34] anything that is against the
[1:47:36] word I don't care how sincere they sound
[1:47:39] how lovely they are they need the truth
[1:47:42] the truth will set them free if they
[1:47:45] have representation in God from before
[1:47:48] the foundations of the World when they
[1:47:50] hear the truth they will love it they
[1:47:53] say this is this makes absolute sense I
[1:47:55] love it I can't I don't even fully
[1:47:58] understand it but I'm in love with him
[1:48:00] I'm in love with the word it's a reality
[1:48:02] it's changing me it's it's lifting all
[1:48:04] the darkness from my life I can't
[1:48:06] explain why all this mental oppression
[1:48:09] that was on my life and all these fears
[1:48:11] of death and all these worries of of of
[1:48:14] what's going to happen when I die or
[1:48:16] what's going to happen to my children or
[1:48:18] what's you know all this fear that that
[1:48:20] because people are are are Liv literally
[1:48:23] bulleted with fear but Jesus lifts all
[1:48:27] of that when you come into that personal
[1:48:31] understanding of who he is he just moves
[1:48:33] it all aside he says that is the spirit
[1:48:36] of antichrist whereof ye have heard that
[1:48:38] it should come and even now already is
[1:48:42] it in the world ye are of God little
[1:48:45] children and have overcome them because
[1:48:49] greater is he that is in you see here it
[1:48:51] is again he's saying I'm in you greater
[1:48:55] is he that is in you than he that's in
[1:48:57] the
[1:48:59] world praise God aren't you
[1:49:02] glad listen as I close here in the
[1:49:06] message he that is in you
[1:49:10] 1963 if we could let the musicians come
[1:49:12] if we could only receive this
[1:49:16] truth now just a moment if we only could
[1:49:20] realize what the scripture means when he
[1:49:22] say said that he that is in you is
[1:49:26] greater than he that is in the world we
[1:49:28] can't understand that yet we say we
[1:49:31] believe it and we know it's the truth
[1:49:34] but we really don't understand it but
[1:49:37] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:49:40] that is in the world what is in you
[1:49:42] that's greater it's Christ the Anointed
[1:49:46] God that was in Christ is in you now
[1:49:49] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:49:51] that is in the world then if he is in
[1:49:54] you it's not you anymore living it's him
[1:49:57] living in you see it's not your thinking
[1:50:01] what you would think about this it's
[1:50:04] what he said about this see then if he
[1:50:08] is in you he absolutely would not deny
[1:50:11] what he said he couldn't do it but he
[1:50:14] would keep what he said and he is trying
[1:50:17] to find that person that he can
[1:50:20] vindicate himself through
[1:50:23] oh boy he's looking for somebody to
[1:50:25] vindicate his word he's looking for a
[1:50:28] people now that doesn't mean he has to
[1:50:31] do it to
[1:50:33] everybody in the time that Moses led the
[1:50:36] children of Israel there was one that
[1:50:38] that was Moses the rest of them just
[1:50:41] followed the message see some of them
[1:50:44] tried to raise up to impersonate it and
[1:50:47] God said separate yourselves and just
[1:50:50] swallowed them up see now but he he
[1:50:54] that's in you is greater than he that's
[1:50:56] in the world God in you like he was in
[1:50:59] Jesus Christ because what all God was he
[1:51:03] poured into Christ and all Christ was he
[1:51:06] poured into the church and you see
[1:51:09] that's God in you that's he's that in
[1:51:16] you glory to
[1:51:19] God oh what a Time Saints am this is
[1:51:23] going to be greater than anything we've
[1:51:25] ever possibly
[1:51:27] imagined this word is going to do things
[1:51:29] in our lives I you know I Ponder on
[1:51:31] these things and because listen we're
[1:51:33] we're human you're going to go home
[1:51:35] today and you're going to remember
[1:51:36] certain things that were said here today
[1:51:38] about God in Me God is God wants to work
[1:51:41] in my life God wants to do things in my
[1:51:43] life and you know sometimes I Ponder on
[1:51:44] those things and and my mind just starts
[1:51:47] to go off into an imagination and I
[1:51:49] start to see certain things and I wonder
[1:51:51] Lord what is going going to take place
[1:51:53] around our lives as this really starts
[1:51:55] to
[1:51:56] culminate you don't realize you're
[1:51:59] you're you're you're putting line upon
[1:52:01] line precept upon precept every time you
[1:52:04] come into church and you feed on the
[1:52:05] word of God and you hear these things
[1:52:08] these are these are profound words that
[1:52:10] are coming from the
[1:52:12] scripture but let me tell you things are
[1:52:14] going to start to happen around your
[1:52:16] life supernaturally if they're not
[1:52:18] already
[1:52:19] happening you will see Things Fall away
[1:52:22] all of a sudden son you'll wake up one
[1:52:23] morning and that oppression that mental
[1:52:26] oppression is gone you can't even
[1:52:27] explain it I I I felt so depressed I I I
[1:52:31] you know I I had no hope I didn't feel
[1:52:33] like anybody wanted to be around me you
[1:52:36] see your your your attitude in your own
[1:52:39] your own atmosphere that you create
[1:52:42] around your life is what you will
[1:52:43] attract because this is the law of God
[1:52:47] but feeding on the word of God and
[1:52:49] feeding on this Revelation and recog
[1:52:52] iing not only is he in in the church
[1:52:55] he's in you he wants to be a part of
[1:52:58] your life your everyday life when when
[1:53:00] you pray it just it just gives you more
[1:53:04] strength things are going to start to
[1:53:07] happen around our lives and we are going
[1:53:09] to see things like we've never seen
[1:53:12] before God has to do it he's going to do
[1:53:16] it Saints otherwise we will fall right
[1:53:19] back into the world from where we came
[1:53:22] but it's been 30 years now that I've
[1:53:24] been serving the lord and all I can tell
[1:53:27] you is that this word has never been
[1:53:29] more real to me than it is right
[1:53:32] now because he's doing this work he's
[1:53:35] doing this thing he's the one that's
[1:53:37] bringing the body together he's the one
[1:53:39] that adds to the church I'm not afraid
[1:53:41] of who comes into the church God brings
[1:53:44] them God adds God takes away it's as
[1:53:46] simple as that let the Lord Bring It's
[1:53:50] the Lord that adds to the body it's the
[1:53:52] Lord Lord that feeds his own my sheep
[1:53:54] hear my voice I don't expect them to
[1:53:57] hear Danny's Voice I want him to hear
[1:53:59] his voice speaking to their hearts so
[1:54:02] that their lives can be changed amen
[1:54:04] praise God forever more God bless you

[1:54:29] circumstances and and and heartaches and
[1:54:32] broken relationships and financial
