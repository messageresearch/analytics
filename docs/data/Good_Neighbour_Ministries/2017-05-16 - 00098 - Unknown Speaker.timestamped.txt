[1:34] our souls down upon the Earth to
[1:37] represent you and being trapped in this
[1:40] body we were subject to sin and pain and
[1:44] suffering and sickness but by the
[1:47] opening of the word the soon the son of
[1:50] man sets free is free indeed and father

[2:17] believe the word of God for this out we
[2:20] ask your blessing now and the and the
[2:22] multiplication and portioning of the
[2:25] word in Jesus name amen and amen thank
[2:29] you
[2:32] according as he has chosen Us in
[2:36] him before the foundations of the
[2:40] world that we should be holy and Without
[2:45] Blame before him in love I'll go to the
[2:50] next verse having
[2:53] predestinated us onto the adoption of
[2:57] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[3:00] according to the good pleasure of his
[3:04] will God bless you please be
[3:09] seated there's a little little uh chorus
[3:13] that I love to sing Let the beauty of
[3:18] Jesus be seen in
[3:22] me all God's wonderful passions and
[3:28] Pur
[3:31] oh thou Spirit divine all my nature
[3:38] refine till the beauty of Jesus be
[3:45] seen let's sing it one more time let the
[3:51] beauty of Jesus be
[3:54] seen in
[3:57] me all God
[4:01] wonderful passions
[4:06] and oh th Spirit
[4:11] divine all my
[4:16] nature till the beauty of
[4:23] Jesus in
[4:26] me amen praise the name of the Lord God
[4:30] Bless you that's a little chorus I love
[4:32] to sing in prayer time with loan with
[4:35] the Lord let him refine my nature so I
[4:39] can be like him now um switching from
[4:43] that talk brother Bren uh clearly says
[4:47] um that in the last
[4:50] days amen that women types the church
[4:53] how many knows that said that women
[4:56] types the church praise God and uh the
[5:01] thing about that also he says that in
[5:04] the choosing of a bride uh that we must
[5:08] there'll be a rise of the in the beauty
[5:11] of women in the last days he said that
[5:15] clearly he says back in the days or the
[5:19] women that were beauty queens back there
[5:21] he said they won't even they won't even
[5:23] they won't even be chosen to be in the
[5:26] lineup anymore because just the know
[5:29] normal woman of today is a
[5:32] beauty amen some of the sisters didn't
[5:35] know that but I'm telling them that now
[5:37] praise the Lord random said that that's
[5:39] the prophet saying that he says the
[5:41] normal woman today would have been a
[5:44] beauty queen back there and what they
[5:47] call Beauty is totally different today
[5:50] but the then he prophesied that there
[5:53] will be a
[5:54] rise of beauty of women in the last days
[5:58] Amen in other words he says they'll get
[6:00] the women will get more beautiful and
[6:03] more beautiful and more beautiful and
[6:05] the men will get weaker but
[6:09] wiser right they may look bigger but the
[6:12] natural fact they'll get weaker but WIS
[6:16] but women will rise in Beauty in every
[6:20] possible way amen and then he goes on to
[6:24] talk about uh let me let me actually
[6:27] find it right here now
[6:30] he says now you know a woman is a type
[6:33] of the church we are the bride and the
[6:37] CH the church is the bride that's a
[6:40] woman types the bride a lot of brides
[6:43] there are out there and let don't let
[6:46] them women entice you see you see them
[6:50] ministers are letting them churches pull
[6:53] them off from the truth she be switching
[6:56] between the Natural Woman and the
[6:57] spiritual woman uh like there what she
[7:01] cuts her hair and when she does that
[7:04] that woman has cut off her power and her
[7:08] glory not against sisters if God would
[7:11] give a man a better thing than a good
[7:14] wife he' have given him
[7:16] that but not all women are good and not
[7:20] all women are
[7:22] wise you see or not all femal are even
[7:27] mothers not all
[7:30] that have children are real
[7:32] motherly I've seen some i' have better
[7:36] respects for a dog than to take their
[7:39] kids and set them out in the street and
[7:42] lay out there not even caring people
[7:46] coming out in these little old clothes
[7:48] and things until in this hour our women
[7:51] are immorally dressed can you say Amen
[7:55] that wow now in the children Ching of a
[8:00] bride or a wife I'm just laying some
[8:02] background here amen he says you may
[8:07] look at there might be one girl that's
[8:09] real
[8:11] pretty and another one with a great
[8:14] stature that looks better than this
[8:17] other one
[8:20] wow but Brothers you may have to
[8:23] sacrifice one for the
[8:26] other if she's not the
[8:29] of a woman or of a lady I don't care
[8:33] whether she's pretty or she's not pretty
[8:36] you brothers that better look at her
[8:39] [Music]
[8:41] character whether she's pretty or not
[8:44] pretty look at her character now for it
[8:48] is becoming if a Christian would choose
[8:50] a wife he have to choose a genuine Born
[8:53] Again
[8:55] woman regardless of what she looks like
[8:59] if what she is what makes her and then
[9:02] again that reflects his own Godly
[9:05] character and watch in his mind for a
[9:08] wife what's going to be in the future
[9:11] for his family but if he marries one of
[9:13] these modern day flers recers sex Queens
[9:17] what would he expect what kind of a home
[9:19] if he marries a girl that ain't got
[9:22] morals enough to stay home and take care
[9:25] of the house amen what kind of a
[9:27] housekeeper will she be you see that's
[9:31] it but that's the beauty of the women
[9:34] that is to happen in the last days amen
[9:38] that is what's supposed to be happening
[9:41] in this in these last days that we are
[9:44] living in praise the Lord I want to give
[9:46] you one more quote here because uh he's
[9:50] striking on the fact that uh gifts
[9:54] without
[9:56] character is satanic amen now how I'm
[10:01] applying it certain women are given
[10:03] certain
[10:04] gifts they may be given a lot of um uh
[10:08] gifts in their bodily shape and form
[10:12] While others may not be gifted in that
[10:14] way but gifts without character is
[10:20] satanic you seeing how I'm applying it
[10:22] amen I'm applying it in that way and
[10:25] then I'm talking also about supernatural
[10:27] spiritual gifts
[10:29] in the life of an
[10:33] individual if if that individual does
[10:36] not allow the Holy Spirit first to form
[10:39] and control the
[10:41] character the manifestation of those
[10:44] gifts the genuine know they may be would
[10:47] be devilish amen right the application
[10:50] of it would be devilish brother Brandon
[10:53] said about himself he said having a gift
[10:58] of Des
[11:00] discernment if you allow yourself not to
[11:03] pray enough and you start to get carnal
[11:06] instead of of the gift operating as a
[11:08] gift of discernment it will become one
[11:11] of the worst
[11:13] critics because then the person is
[11:15] starting to see things carnally in other
[11:18] words you you're doing it you're doing
[11:20] it from a carnal point of view right
[11:23] it's the same thing just as much as he
[11:26] says really he says them witches out
[11:30] there if they had surrendered themselves
[11:32] to God they would have been Servants of
[11:35] God with gifts of Prophecy and
[11:38] discernment amen amen but they allow
[11:41] themselves to be controlled by the devil
[11:44] and therefore the devil manifest himself
[11:46] through them you see where I'm talking
[11:49] about now you see why we are on the
[11:51] razor's
[11:52] head and you can fall either way even
[11:55] though you're a Christian you following
[11:57] me now yes you can go either way though
[12:01] you're a big Christian a lot of people
[12:03] take this message and Solomon said it's
[12:05] wise to be not over much righteous that
[12:09] sounds so funny how you could be too
[12:11] righteous but you can right the old
[12:14] Pentecost used to say you get so
[12:16] righteous you're noly
[12:19] good spiritually your mind is so much in
[12:21] the heavens that you're not dealing with
[12:23] reality see we've got to be both deeply
[12:28] spiritual but intensely practical amen
[12:32] recognize your day and the hour of your
[12:34] day that you're living in or else you're
[12:36] going to go right off and as a result of
[12:39] that a lot of ministers have made mess
[12:41] of a lot of people's lives amen I'm not
[12:45] thinking of any particular person or
[12:47] persons I'm not talking in general uh
[12:50] mess the people's Li up because they
[12:52] they just so push them this way push
[12:55] them that way and get them in all kinds
[12:56] of fanaticism and you know like that
[12:58] instead of keeping them solidly balanced
[13:00] on the word of God now listen to The
[13:02] Prophet before I started going into the
[13:05] message itself he says now unless we
[13:08] suffer we cannot reign with him how many
[13:10] will
[13:11] say you have to suffer he said before
[13:15] you can re the reason for this is that
[13:19] character is simply is never made
[13:22] without suffering amen amen let's use
[13:26] job I don't mean that you going to have
[13:28] the suffering the extremity of job he
[13:31] God was using job as a as a type or as a
[13:35] symbol so we can have an example as a
[13:37] Christian that every son or daughter of
[13:40] God must be
[13:41] tested you must be tested and so he says
[13:45] your character uh can be formed without
[13:49] suffering for character is a victory
[13:54] amen not a gift that's right thank you
[13:57] amen Hallelujah a man without character
[14:02] can't rain because power apart from
[14:06] character is
[14:08] Satan but Power with character is f to
[14:12] Ru
[14:13] amen and since he wants to share his
[14:16] throne on the same basis that he
[14:18] overcome and is set down in his father's
[14:21] Throne then then we have to overcome
[14:24] before we can sit down with him amen
[14:28] amen
[14:29] then we have to overcome and the little
[14:32] temporary sufferings we go through is
[14:35] not worthy to be compared with the
[14:38] tremendous Glory that will be revealed
[14:41] in us when he comes oh what Treasures
[14:44] are laid up for those who are willing to
[14:47] enter in his kingdom through much
[14:52] tribulation
[14:54] amen God wants men how many believe that
[14:59] when suffer the lamb he's speaking man
[15:02] is not measured by how big his arms are
[15:07] but God measures a man by his
[15:12] character certainly he can be a big man
[15:16] and be nothing but a
[15:19] brute I seen men weigh 200 lb and didn't
[15:23] have one oce of a manhood in them nobody
[15:28] saying
[15:31] amen not one o see but a man is measured
[15:37] by character and so are women measured
[15:41] by their character and if we are truly
[15:44] Sons and Daughters of God what type of
[15:47] character then should we have amen you
[15:51] should have the character of Christ amen
[15:55] that is what we should have we are not
[15:57] here to talk Christianity but to live
[16:01] Christianity and be genuine Christians
[16:04] for the glory of
[16:05] God now having the gifts of God
[16:09] wonderful marvelous gifts without having
[16:13] the character to
[16:14] control those gifts amen makes them not
[16:18] only satanic but makes them a stumbling
[16:21] block to un
[16:23] believer because here is the guy
[16:26] preaching here is the woman talking that
[16:28] is a Christian andless she goes out line
[16:32] cheating the preacher doing all kinds of
[16:35] ungodly things and they claiming to be a
[16:38] man of God and claiming to be a
[16:40] Christian and it becomes a contradiction
[16:43] and it's a St block to the unbeliever
[16:46] that's right so we must be faithful to
[16:50] God he said gifts without character the
[16:54] gifts without these virtues is not
[16:56] accepted by God that's right God doesn't
[16:59] accept it Blasphemous names page 21 he's
[17:02] saying that when you have faith virtue
[17:05] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[17:07] breadly love the Holy Ghost seals you as
[17:10] a unit the same way he seals the church
[17:13] the way he makes his bright is the way
[17:15] he makes individual out of the same
[17:18] material like Eve was made out of Adam
[17:22] and RI from his side amen so we have to
[17:25] have the same character as Christ amen
[17:29] now we know when we born again the Lord
[17:32] comes in and he makes your heart his
[17:36] home amen or his house or his Tabernacle
[17:40] his Sanctuary where he dwells and he
[17:44] lives in us know him not that you you
[17:47] are the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen
[17:50] and that God dwells in you by faith he
[17:53] lives in your heart amen he lives in me
[17:56] He Lives in You by he lives in your
[17:59] heart now Christ is in you and when he
[18:02] comes in of course the Lord himself is
[18:06] perfection you believe that the Lord
[18:09] himself is
[18:10] perfection so the moment you are born
[18:14] again you are a perfect spiritual
[18:18] being just like when a baby is born it's
[18:21] a perfect natural human being but even
[18:25] though it's perfect and and and it has
[18:29] every Perfection of a human being in it
[18:33] yet it's not capable as yet expressing
[18:37] his full
[18:38] humanity and so is a Christian even
[18:41] though Christ came in and he himself is
[18:46] perfection he said but why am I not
[18:48] acting perfect well it's like a baby
[18:51] asking why I'm not walking like the rest
[18:53] of them why am not talking why am you
[18:55] can't do it right away but I I I go back
[18:58] after Paul's word we now have to work
[19:01] out our salvation with fear and
[19:03] trembling amen that Perfection that you
[19:06] have inside has to work until it comes
[19:08] outside amen is that right now God's
[19:12] real Christianity doesn't come from the
[19:15] outside he says it's not sticking
[19:17] Christianity on yourself like a bird
[19:19] feather oh the Bible says I supposed to
[19:21] have virtue so you try to stick that on
[19:23] oh the Bible says I'm going to add this
[19:25] so I add a little knowledge I that he
[19:28] says that's not how it works the
[19:30] Perfection is already in you but you
[19:33] need to surrender yourself to God so
[19:36] that he can manifest himself through you
[19:40] and these Seven Virtues will begin to
[19:42] flow out of you not because of you
[19:45] working yourself up into some state of
[19:47] fervor but he himself expressing his own
[19:52] character through
[19:54] you amen and that is why in the next
[19:58] statements he's saying here now you now
[20:02] you see you really can't impersonate
[20:05] them you can't imitate them amen praise
[20:09] God how could you say that and yet say
[20:14] the Christian
[20:15] elans have love more than some of
[20:19] you there are people out there not born
[20:21] again expressing virtues that looks more
[20:26] beautiful and like they're more CHR
[20:28] Chris that's the real
[20:29] chran is that right wow and yet he says
[20:34] but this can't be impers what he's
[20:37] saying is that the real Christ you can't
[20:40] impersonate that you can't impersonate
[20:42] his personality they can go out like the
[20:45] devil and try to to do the same thing by
[20:49] human effort but it's still not the same
[20:52] it's still not the same you can't do it
[20:54] it's not really there and you can't do
[20:56] it of yourself amen
[20:58] it's like when Israel God gave them the
[21:01] law and said Thou shalt not steal Thou
[21:03] shalt not Li Thou shalt not kill thou
[21:07] sht not do this thou sht not do that but
[21:10] in actual fact God placed those
[21:14] laws deliberately so that they will come
[21:18] back to him and say Lord we we can't K
[21:22] this while we in this flesh as humans we
[21:25] we can't K us there's no way for us to
[21:27] keep law then he would give them the
[21:30] power to keep the law because it will
[21:33] take the blood to do that it took it
[21:36] would take the blood to do that but they
[21:39] did not do that it's the same way all
[21:42] these virtues oh I'm supposed to do this
[21:44] I'm supposed to do this then you find
[21:46] yourself not doing it like what Paul
[21:48] said the things I should do I don't do
[21:50] and what I shouldn't do I find myself
[21:52] doing because of the human nature that
[21:55] we are living
[21:57] in and the only thing that can help you
[22:01] is Christ himself in you your
[22:05] glory this is a mistake that the
[22:08] Pentecostals made they are trying to be
[22:12] like Jesus and to live like Christ
[22:15] without the character and person of
[22:18] Christ dwelling right within them and he
[22:22] living out his own life not you trying
[22:27] to live his life but he himself living
[22:31] his life in
[22:32] you is expressed in this
[22:35] way you will try to go and play a piano
[22:38] maybe you can but if
[22:42] beov was able to come and fill
[22:46] you one moment later you'll be able to
[22:49] play some matters you'll be able to play
[22:52] all kinds of conts different things you
[22:54] be able to play why because it's not you
[22:57] playing
[22:58] it's beat over in you playing the music
[23:02] amen well this is what real Christianity
[23:06] is is not you coming and and thinking
[23:09] that by uh just reading your Bible and
[23:11] praying and doing all these things all
[23:13] of a sudden you're a Christian no it's
[23:16] Christ in
[23:18] youah living out his own life through
[23:22] you thank you Lord apply this correctly
[23:26] God is his own
[23:29] interpreter amen amen he is the only one
[23:32] can interpret his own life amen amen you
[23:36] are only trying to live it the way you
[23:39] think he
[23:41] was but he is expressing himself now to
[23:44] let you know who he is is that right
[23:49] amen God in the present stage of his
[23:53] ministry expressing himself through
[23:56] human beings Born Again by The Blood
[24:00] amen hallelujah so gifts without the
[24:05] person and character of Christ operating
[24:09] through that life controlling these
[24:13] gifts amen without him it's
[24:18] amen amen even if he is there and the
[24:22] person is operating from a kind point of
[24:24] view it said but if prist is you and you
[24:28] humble down yourself and you surrender
[24:31] and you let yourself get out of the way
[24:34] amen praise the name of the Lord then
[24:37] God is able to work through you amen is
[24:39] that right and that's why you will
[24:43] become
[24:44] humble humble because once you got the
[24:48] Revelation realize that this is not me
[24:51] this is him that's right it's right it's
[24:54] not me it's him then Paul says what's
[24:58] there to boast about that nothing you
[25:00] can boast on you can't boast on your
[25:02] Holiness because it's not yours you
[25:04] can't boast on your humility it's not
[25:05] yours you can't boast on the gifts it's
[25:07] not yours you can't boast on love it's
[25:09] not yours none of it is yours it's him
[25:13] it's all about him Christ in you your
[25:16] hope Glory the of Christ controlling the
[25:20] caral
[25:21] nature taking it over and he expressing
[25:25] himself through you amen what that's the

[40:16] Ghost is our teacher praise the Lord you
[40:19] say oh the Holy Ghost is teacher I don't
[40:20] need a pastor I don't need I don't need
[40:23] a f Ministry I don't need any of those
[40:25] well the Holy Ghost teaching through the
[40:28] 5f
[40:29] ministry the the scripture said his fan
[40:33] is in his
[40:34] hand and he will toally Purge or clean
[40:38] up the floor well the fan you know is in
[40:41] his hand five fingers that's the
[40:43] fivefold ministry and the fan is the
[40:46] open word the revealed word so he grabs
[40:50] the revealed word by these five minist
[40:54] and then he's able to purge all draws
[40:57] and all of the you know out out of the
[41:00] Church of the Living God hallelujah so
[41:03] the Holy Spirit teaches
[41:05] through these ministries of course he
[41:08] can teach you individually and
[41:10] personally
[41:12] also but the prophet puts that that we
[41:15] understand but you'll never rise above
[41:17] your
[41:18] past is that right if you do then you
[41:22] are not to be praise the Lord because
[41:26] God I'm not going to bypass his
[41:28] representative and go to you and show
[41:32] you something else certainly he will
[41:34] reveal something you that can be helpful
[41:36] in the church cuz I know of that people
[41:40] been using the church say this that that
[41:42] the other praise the Lord that but then
[41:44] it must always be filtered through the
[41:50] Pastoral Ministry or the minister that's
[41:52] there at the time that main gift has to
[41:54] filter those things that's that's why he
[41:56] used to tell him write your dreams write
[41:58] your prophecy don't just take it and
[42:00] think you can just interpret it by
[42:01] yourself and and you may not be seeing
[42:04] everything as clearly as God will allow
[42:06] that man to see it I had a case where
[42:09] somebody had a dream and they came and
[42:11] and and they were tell telling it in the
[42:13] church I said stop don't do that they
[42:16] said well you know Lord I said don't do
[42:19] it you know because when interpretation
[42:21] comes you don't know what it's going to
[42:22] be well they didn't listen they continue
[42:24] talking about it and I'm preaching away
[42:27] one Sunday one Sunday then I noticed the
[42:29] whole family got mad and this and then
[42:32] they start jingling their car keys and
[42:35] stopping and next thing you stopped and
[42:37] they walked out what happened their own
[42:42] dream exposed them and it was revealed
[42:46] amen and I didn't wake up the dream so
[42:48] if you want to drink it so you can't say
[42:50] I made anything up the holy spirit so
[42:53] that's the way it is so you be careful
[42:55] it may not be be the way you seem or you
[42:58] think that's why he says many times you
[43:00] write it down you you you or you go to
[43:02] the pastor you let it be known that way
[43:05] rather than you go first among the
[43:07] congregation and spreading all kinds of
[43:09] stuff that you don't understand fully
[43:11] what it means and then come to the
[43:13] pastor
[43:15] afterwards no you don't do it you got it
[43:17] backwards you come to the pastor first
[43:20] and then you make those things known and
[43:23] allow the Holy Spirit if he said but I
[43:25] don't understand it right now I'm going
[43:26] to pray about it all the prophets did
[43:29] that they said I don't know the Lord
[43:31] hide it from me I don't know I have to
[43:32] go pray and then you pray and then God
[43:35] will give some interpretation or
[43:37] understanding and then the church moves
[43:38] on in an orderly fashion by the Holy
[43:41] Spirit praise the Lord are you following
[43:44] does this make
[43:45] sense praise the name of the Lord
[43:47] hallelujah amen so we are uh we thank
[43:51] God that we we are being we are here to
[43:54] be chored by the right chor
[43:57] and the trth is the holy spirit
[43:59] according to John 14 amen hallelujah see
[44:03] now when a member is born by the Holy
[44:05] Ghost and is proving to have these
[44:08] virtues in them and God can see them
[44:12] amen that's when you see a real son and
[44:14] daughter of God hallelujah that true
[44:18] church is going to be there the church
[44:20] is predestinated to be there by to
[44:24] adoption God is telling you you are
[44:26] predestinated onto adoption you are
[44:29] predestinated to come to that Perfection
[44:32] and have all those things operating in
[44:34] your life never mind what you think
[44:36] about yourself it's what he thinks about
[44:38] you that's why Paul said even if your
[44:41] heart condemns you God what he says is
[44:44] greater than your heart amen is that
[44:47] right praise the name of the Lord God is
[44:49] working out something right now I said
[44:51] God is working I believe he's in the
[44:53] house you believe that
[44:56] this is my house he's in the house he
[45:00] wants to with you he's in the house he
[45:03] in the house the SI that heal when he's
[45:06] in the house the crowds are gathering
[45:08] around and say what's going on because
[45:10] he's in the house even if you got to
[45:12] make a hole in the roof to get to church
[45:14] you want to make a hole in the roof
[45:17] because he's in the
[45:18] house Lord he's in the house you want to
[45:21] be in the house of the
[45:24] Lord together man of praise the name of
[45:28] the Lord hallelujah amen praise God Amen
[45:32] do you
[45:33] know that after a while the Holy Spirit
[45:36] has to make a report to upon your
[45:40] character he has to report about you how
[45:43] you were
[45:46] fussing
[45:48] [Music]
[45:49] fighting how you are having
[45:53] differences how you are going in there
[45:56] un separating
[46:01] Brotherhood oh how that must grieve God
[46:04] in the body of Christ these things
[46:07] happening in the body of
[46:10] Christ think about
[46:13] it it is our own
[46:17] character that is tearing us down our
[46:21] own character is tearing us
[46:24] down amen now we are children don't
[46:27] forget that but when you are truly born
[46:30] again and you a child of God you may be
[46:34] a child of God but a disobedient child
[46:37] of God is that right now what is he
[46:40] talking about he's not talking here
[46:42] about
[46:43] backsliding is that right because a real
[46:46] believer really you can't really
[46:50] backslide as such you can't backslide
[46:53] you can't be lost anymore because God
[46:56] can't make you a child today and make
[46:57] you a devil tomorrow that's right
[47:01] amen God is eternal and when he makes a
[47:03] decision is always the right
[47:05] decision and it doesn't change no matter
[47:08] how the circumstances look it doesn't
[47:10] change amen so you are the child of God
[47:13] so you can be a child but you're a
[47:15] disobedient child you can have your own
[47:17] child let's use your own child whoever
[47:20] they are it's your child but today it's
[47:23] an obedient child you couldn't want
[47:25] better
[47:27] tomorrow I met this
[47:30] [Music]
[47:31] child
