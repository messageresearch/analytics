my Lord my Lord and I Lord send me praise be to God God bless you all please be seated please be seated uh it's brother coffee here ah you're hiding in the corner praise the Lord I will let uh first of all let me read the scripture first of all uh this will be out of Acts chapter 11 uh reading from verse uh 26 just for a background happy to see all of you again here in the house of the Lord worshiping him and giving him glory on this marvelous wonderful Sunday and while I'm talking about that I'm imagining what it's like while they worshiping over there and giving glory to God uh together and just a moment yes and when he had found him that is when Barnabas found Paul right and when he had found him he brought him unto Antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught many people and the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch praise the Lord may God bless those few words to your hearts as we ask his Blessing now our gracious Heavenly Father we are so thankful for your grace your mercy and most of all that when we gathered together like this that you you will not you said you'll never leave us alone your promise I will be with you I will not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you to the very end of the age so we know that when we gather together uh it's not just the typical church service but we come in the presence of the king we come in the presence of your great spirit who dwells All Above All and in all and through you all so we ask father as we come humbly in your presence with worship with praise with adoration we ask your blessing upon the word anoint your people anoint your servants as brother coffee comes now we pray your spirit will rest upon him and in all that is said and done bring glory and honor to Your Great Name we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you please be seated now we first of all love to have brother coffee come and just give a report we're not we're not preaching any sermon as such uh prepare pre prepared for hand or something like that we're just coming to talk with you is that okay amen and just to tell you of the Lord's uh doings and his workings in this great land of Ghana um Africa from which brother coffee comes brother Phillip comes brother Desmond comes sister Elizabeth comes Sister Rose Sister Mary they come from that land and our sister um Sheila that has passed on a few weeks ago uh that was here in the church then got very sick and had to be in the hospital and taken care of uh passed and crossed over she also came from there but what a day we're living in brothers and sisters praise the Lord what an hour that we're living in uh we haven't come in here just to hear words but we come to meet this eternal being that I believe every time I stand stand here you stand here I believe his presence is here I believe his power is here I believe he's listening to everything we say I actually truly believe that I'm not just talking I believe there's a living God and we serve him and he hears us and he watches and he knows everything the old saying God standing in the shadows watching over his own how wonderful it is to see that angel that brother Brenham had to tell uh Billy Paul look and over by the drapes in the hotel room was a 250b man standing with his hands folded in white robes it was the angel of the Lord and Billy Paul said and as he stood there he just looked at me and then changed into a fire that began to whirl around and went up through the windows into the heavens I believe we serve that same God he is no less the same God and that's why I believe that uh you are in a supernatural Church um there's lots of message churches and I'm not saying we are different or not different but that we are outstanding we don't want to be seen or recognize actually we want to have a hidden life because if we were to begin to tell you the stories how the pillar of fire appeared in that tree of life on the wall and actually appeared and then the picture was taken and that photograph was never shown and you know for people to uh oh my God that church may be no no let the Holy Spirit do that let the the Holy Spirit do things like that we are not here to advertise and make a big thing because we want to attract people but we want to give God all the praise and all the honor and the glory more of him and less of me amen more of him less of you amen that's the way it should be let's all Look Away to Jesus and I believe we will all be truly blessed the approach to the message now let's ask brother coffee under the Holy Spirit to anoint him and to use him to say whatever God lays upon his heart and then I'll follow up and make a few remarks and let the Lord Jesus have his way God bless you brother coffee we welcome you a mighty man of God uh because of um language because of culture because of Education things of that he might not appear as very much here and I'm just talking plainly um uh but you see when he gets into that land and he can speak to the people in their language and under the anointing of the holy spirit is a totally different man amen totally different and God flows through him and such a supernatural and marvelous and wonderful way you will want to know if it's the same BR of coffee that you knew over here that you were seeing moving under the spirit there but God has his own ways and his own plans brother coffee God bless you with all respects we welcome you to the pulpit and God bless you and use you for his glory god bless you good to see you first time we're seeing each other since we're back yes thank you I just want to say I really thanks everyone of you I thank my beloved pastor and his wife and when I was back home this time I really really saw as he was saying what God has even done that I myself did not know because preaching in message church maybe probably the same size or almost the same size of this church and the pastor is is not a young he been in the message for long and seeing how the Holy Spirit was moving in that church from the pastor to the Pew how the people were rejoicing and thanking God for the word that was coming my first scripture that I used was I think uh Psalm 10 H Psalm 46: 10 and Hebrews I think Hebrews 11:29 I use that scripture that's what the lord gave it to me to give it to them and it was such a blessing and such a powerful message the pastor name was Pastor Steven the Holy Spirit mov and I'm not just talking about just joke were getting into the people heart because it was even Beyond me my understanding or whether I can speak or I can speak one point the Holy Spirit was even I was speaking English the Holy Spirit was telling them that even if you think you uh The Interpreter can't interpret it good I'll speak Ghana language I'll speak the language that everyone understand me and and God was going through the people heart and telling some of them the sisters youve been been through tradition and cultural SS and all kinds of things that has brought into the message has binded you but now God is setting you free and the spirit of God was moving beginning they were trying to like like uh check what I was bringing and you could see they have their note but while the Holy Spirit begin to move they put all the note aside they didn't care no more from the pastor at the back I see him jumping shouting the brother Pastor Robert that went with me oh he can wa and I was all over the place preaching like that you know what it was Thursday we left here 31st October reach in Ghana first so second I was preaching in that place and the N day which was Friday we were going to the market guess what the car the pastor was driving hit somebody on the ground crowd lots of crowd behind us and security all over the place abig girl was there Paul was there Pastor Robert who was driving the car was there so we wanted to take the person to the police or to the hospital but the person says no I can't go he don't trust the police much he don't trust the nurses much because he think the way I look maybe when I go there I can pay them with money and she won't get nothing and she will be left by herself so she rather let me give her something so that she will go and take care of herself and we could read between the line so I as every girl all the money has changed my money has I have changed Paul and the brother that was in the market he gave we gave all that we have to her and I give her my number that anything should contact me and the next day guess what he call and says he's feeling better so I just want to thank the Lord because I was even crying I know how hard Africa is what he going to do to survive even if he really get Hur but that didn't stop in my heart my heart was to get the job done amen no matter what I want to get the job done so that was the first message the Deacon the head of the deacon they were doing transaction like as we did with here which brother Danny is becoming the next Fe of Pastor if our beloved Pastor time reach then he was telling me Oh Brother it's good that you came it's good that you came this message is so good to us and the pastor himself was telling me that he want me to even dedicate the head of the deacon and I was saying what's going on I never I don't have no idea maybe I'll get like Pastor Simon to in case of anything if he can come here if he can come then he will give me advice what to do or what but grow let the Lord get the glory so Sunday morning they asked me to preach again then I as soon as I go there the lord gave me uh Hebrews 138 and second Peter I think 1:20 and I put it together the Holy Spirit while were I'm about to go to the pulpit there was a brother turn up in in the church and he says oh Brothers I just failed to today come and worship with you and lots of people like this the Holy Spirit took over the service such a blessing the people now they know what they got on Thursday so Sunday they they wasn't hesitating or guessing or what from the pastor to the PE they were ready to receive the word so the Holy Spirit begin to pour out in me search even I myself things I don't even think all I need to do is to remove myself out of the way let the Holy Spirit do the job and I did that and God be to prove to them that hey this is not a man doing it this is me I'm here I've taken contr control over this church and I'm going to move whether you like it or not I'm here and I'm taking control so the Holy Spirit begin to speak through me with authority with power with confidence with the word because I have no fear and one point I told them hey if you have the gold and you know it's pure gold you're not scared to put the gold down I says you see the Ashanti king he have gold from his head to toes so sometime he dress with it you ask him gold will you think he's afraid to dress up with the gold he's not afraid he going to put the gold down I came here with a pure go pure word of God so if you came to examine me don't come to examine examine yourself let the Holy Spirit do the job oh they were rejoicing shouting now it says too much tradition in the churches too much tradition too much there some preacher has come in the message using Stripes all they could do is use Stripes to beat the sisters beat the sisters even a sister with a pimples on his face they don't want the sister to buy cream and clean her face what is all this and I was speaking plainly as the Holy Spirit was putting things just coming like that and God begin to move and tell them is him oh why I was preaching in the middle of the preaching the light go off and I could hear God say speak back the light speak back the light again they were rejoicing but I was the devil begin to battle me says what about if you says and the light doesn't appear what about if you say and I could hear that inside me battering then right away I says oh light or no light everybody sit down quiet God is about to move God is up to something big as soon as I say like that the like just go come right back then I know God was on the scene oh come see the shouting and Glory then after the service finished the pastor forgot that they even he haven't done the election yet but the church already knew who supposed to be the next incoming pastor all the Believers they know so they vote and when they vote about 98% was the same brother that the pastor told me so he asked me brother Robert and he himself we lay hands on the brother and we pray for him I came out the brother that W in the church he come and shake my hand he says brother you don't know me I don't know you he says I dress up to go to my message church this morning but why I dress up ready to get into my car the holy spirit says today you are not going there you going to this place he says even coming here I didn't know the way he says the Holy Spirit Led me straight right to this church this morning praise God thank you Jesus and he says I come here with a strong Bens in my heart nobody knows what I was going through and he says every Bing every trouble I was going through the Lord came down through you and you spoke everything for me this and he says thank you my brother thank you thank you if I don't see you again may the Lord bless you and continue to use you because God I want you to know today God has used you and I thank the Lord for that was such a blessing that was Ashanti region the second biggest city in Ghana I live there and I came back to Acra I was living with Pastor Daniel who has been here before and he asked me to minister for him on Wednesday so I ministered to him the lord gave me fear not little flock so I used that topic as the background and I spoke while I was about to preach on Wednesday another Pastor turn up just show up he didn't tell nobody he was coming to that place he just turn up they give me the pit he was sitting down there the pastor says oh you didn't every time you come you call but today you didn't call says oh I just feel like coming so he came and the Lord let me take the word of God God begin to move in such a way that one point I could hear him he says praise God even the message I have prepared you have spoken everything he was jumping and dancing and oh my brothers and sisters after the service he was even carrying my quat and my Bible case you won't let me go oh I says I begin to even shake my head I says what is this I'm just a little what about my big brothers here then you me a little like that and you seen that then what about my big brothers then you will even you won't let him go and he was so happy want to take my number and this are message preacher who have his own church the people were so blessed the congregation the way the Lord was using me sometime he would take things that were happening in Ghana and bring it natural to them and explain it and they says we never heard anybody preach like this but this is a clear revelation and I don't know how it come how it just come and I just Pi it and not thinking about it raising or putting myself in so God was blessing them the next day I have to take Paul they want to go out with Paul some of the young I when they were sitting down talking about the message that I brought they says he look we were talking about your message and here you are how much we were blessed yesterday and we thanking God for the message early in the morning I would see Pastor Daniel wasn't there but few days he came back from Nigeria because of work early in the morning she will carry my food to my door his wife they won't let me buy even one dollar of 10 they will they really take care of me and I want to to thank God for them because they really do respect for the word that I believe our pastor has preed us here and Pastor Robert who were driving me all the way in and out was a pastor who had his own church but has left his church trying to help me out I need car and also he he was already watching this this local church way back even he told me he was watching Pastor Simon why Pastor Simon was preaching the seals so if you check the time Pastor Simon used to preach the seals and even getting through when he's preaching the the seals is checking Pastor Simon teachings and using it for his church pastor Simon don't know I don't know when when I was working with him then he was telling me and I believe he told him later on says Brothers I've watch he says he used to go on the on the YouTube or whatever that time I think we were using cassette video cassettes and thing like that Bruce Dale so he had has been following us for a long time on Pastor salimon teachings he love it so he was telling me and he was asking me questions questions upon questions one time one point I told him I said brother you want me to preach for you but you asking so much question like this when I get there what can I preach for you again I can't preach anything cuz I already you already know everything so I cannot preach so I then I could see later I could see the Lord didn't want me to go there no more Pastor went there but he didn't want me to the Lord didn't want me to preach for him but you know what every question he was asking me he told me himself Pastor even whether he know or he don't know he says every question I ask you your pastor came he didn't know nothing he pick it up one by one spoke it one by one took it f explain things further and he says my goodness when I hear your pastor I says now I can see why you have strong word of God in you like that because it come from the pastor and he told me he says I wish I could get out all the preachers in Ghana then you Brothers you desmon all your pastor three of you could preach to the whole nation but he says let me tell you one thing he says I can receive it but not many will receive it says even within the message not many will receive it CU you you Brothers you your your calling is a very high calling the pastor has really taught you and you know the way and it's not something joke is really says I'm a pastor but I'm just telling you from the bottom of my heart so I left with him sometime K condition I preach from there I preach on Michael Church which was the place we were going to do dedication so Friday because of phone things now they changing the world system is changing so when you go there to get a phone is very very tough use your own name with a phone is very tough unless you you really struggle in before you can get a phone so a brother helped me with a phone I try I get Pastor Simon while they were in hotel and I told him because Michael Was preparing for the dedication and Pastor I told him Friday because Pastor was not able he was tired so he wasn't able to go Friday so he asked me I told him brother I can go he says okay go in the name of good neighbor and go and be blessing for them so I went there and I spoke the word of God and the people were so blessed yes they Rejoice over there they know me for way back and the next day Saturday sister P Pastor Simon brother desmon myself brother Robert we were there and I was thinking Pastor Simon was going to preach Saturday then he turned to brother deson he said Bron get on the pet tonight and and brother Des get on my brother my sister it was a blessing to Michael church he himself will come and tell you by himself I'm not going to his details and Sunday morning we were there Pastor Simon preached Derek the brother and it was a wonderful wonderful ful service The Way Pastor did it the brother was blessed the church was blessed the people were blessed they have done a great job by building the church and I told them it's not the building it's your heart God want you can have a nice building but if you don't have the Holy Spirit in you means nothing so get your heart at right with God then God can move so they understand that they coming but they haven't grown up like us but they are coming so Pastor Simon did everything Pastor helped them inlighten them and the dedication went fine then the following that was my last Sunday I went to Brother Alex through him I got to know Michael I went there and I spoke the word and the Lord he says Al told me he have seven people to get baptized ready to be baptized but he want me to baptize them for him I said okay why I'm there I'll do it I brought the word people were shaking my hand I couldn't believe even early people thanking God the word that came forth they never heard it in their life such a word of God like that and they could see the Pure Heart behind the word there's no hypocrisy there's no hidden is pure and they took it rejoicing it and thanking God we went to the water baptized the seven of them one man his wife came the first time he look at me he says oh pastor pastor Pastor nobody can preach like this to my heart and I thank God for you today because you have made a change in my life thank you Jes some even shaking my hand with tears and I look at them and I said oh Lord is that what it is I'm seeing the people really really get hold of something that it has changed their life and the rest of it is we went vacation with Paul to tall in the country Canadians have nice tray in the in the wood up they have made a tray on the tree M we I took Paul there we walk on it and it's nice tree we saw so many Canadians there too and we came to quam Kuma Museum Paul wanted to see the first president so we went there and after we getting ready to turn back to Canada but I want to say something if you want to serve God pour out all your heart you young folks you can fool around because while we were coming in the plane I've take a lot of planes in my life I started entering plane taking plane airplane at the age of 19 and I have th planes till I'm now my age you look at me with B head 19 years I never experienced why we were coming from Europe from K to Canada in the middle of the ocean we coming all of a sudden the plane started to drop down the feast go like this okay you talking about scream children okay you are in the middle of the ocean the plane just drop at once and the face going like this all the light in the plane turn off it's like the experience that we got was like you are in the casket and somebody has hammered all the casket and leave you in the the casket people were screaming all you could hear in the plane was calling for Jesus even kiss were crying for Jesus so if you have time to praise him don't feel shy don't hold back amen don't I'm serious don't that time there was no shy there was no joke the plane is going you could see it the face the nose of the plane in the middle is like this Paul was holding the next seat I was I I just bow my head and said Lord I had a good time with you here on while I was on the earth and I know whether I'm going down I'm going to have a good time with you so it doesn't matter to me whether it's in the middle of the ocean that will be my end on the earth it doesn't matter I am all right with you I want to thank you for what you have accomplished in my life because I didn't deserve it if it this is the end so be it my brothers my sister it's not a joke you can fool around with the gospel if you don't open your heart when that time comes what are you going to do and it come by just at once just like you not thinking the P didn't tell us we going through storm or we going through nothing nobody was telling you nothing the thing just all of a sudden it going straight like this and at once the plane just if you are pregnant woman all the pregnancy like will come people were screaming like you won't believe it's like hell on Earth so don't take the message as a joke Pastor Simon has P his heart and I know it even myself as he was saying is true I am not really educated but one thing I can say with this I have confidence amen no man on Earth come Li to me about the Bible no man again not why I am alive you can Pastor Simon thank you for what you have PR to be wherever I'm working I want to thank the Lord for that thank you all my brothers the deacons the trustees those that sit in the peill here for long let us support Good Neighbor Ministry you don't know what God will do with you I know now what God has done with me and what God is about to do with me more and I want to thank you thank you brother cof God bless you real well amen wonderful even though he's given that report you will never be able to fully grasp it all unless you could have been there because like um well one church he goes to went to extremely poor and the brother that visited us here brother Danielle that congregation highly educated phds and all kinds of uh things like that that kind of people attend that church so when he's telling you that he goes there and he starts preaching and the Holy Spirit breaks them out of all their High wisdom and knowledge and uh because these are not just people educated in the country these are people that go out with the UN and this one and that they go out and and serve in different capacities and then hearing the word preached I believe in the correct way and bringing a balance to it it just shook them to their Roots it was a real blessing so when he said he was embarrassed because one of those men wouldn't let him go and want to carry his Bible and carry his bags and what not that's what he's trying to explain to you how God brought such humility and brought such Spirit of service on them that they don't care about that they just care about fulfilling the word of God and they just stood by our precious brother we thank the Lord for his grace amen let's sing a verse from uh hear the Lord Lord of harvest sweetly calling who will go and work for me today who will bring to me the lost and dying who will Point them to the narrow way shall we sing that together here the Lord of harvest sweetly calling who will go and work for me today who will bring to me the lost and dying who will Point them to the narrow way oh yes speak my Lord speak my [Music] Lord speak and I will to answer thee speak my Lord speak to my heart Lord speak my Lord speak and I will answer Lord send me well that sounds good and it's easy to say that Lord sent me uh as it as you know I was prepared to go and to ordain the precious brother and dedicate the church over there but on the Sunday we're going to be leaving on the Tuesday morning Sunday I'm preparing to come to church steps out of the shower and all of a sudden a pain strikes me in the back and runs right down my leg and such a bad pain that that I had to cry out for sister Simon's help and so all she could do is try to help me to the bed because I couldn't walk and could not sleep because of the excruciating pains that was going on and then I could only think oh my God I understand now what brother Tim beers has been going through brother Tim the Lord let me understand oh my goodness gracious there there's no place you stand you're in pain you you say okay I'm going to lie down or sit down to get rid of the pain you can't sit you can't lie you can't stand you can't do anything yeah it's just pain pain pain and so it was bad r really bad so that when uh sister Simon of course well how are you going to go how how who you going to be able to go uh and be able to preach there the way you preach and stuff like that I said I don't know but I promis them that I am coming and I I've got to keep my word I got to serve the Lord uh right there so we then had to call the airline and arrange for um them to create um a situation where I can have help to be able to make the flight and so they arranged everything Wheelchairs and people and everything for that now I know you see me standing here you can't imagine me sitting in a wheelchair but I had to and I was in a wheelchair um going all in pain and they made sure they walked you in and got you properly seated and everything like that and then coming back from time to time to know how you're going on on went to over there to Africa but I went in pain I want to pause there to say it made me give glory to God for uh men like brother Samuel Johnson they're old now some have gone on to be with the Lord real missionaries men that uh hazarded their lives for this gospel this message of this hour this Gospel of Jesus Christ not just talking about preaching the word men uh what's uh uh Kathy's dad's name if you can remember brother madx right here in in in London Ontario man was a a high engineer of the CP Rail and when he heard this message it struck his soul oh praise God that man took his entire family and mov to the Philippines so he can be there preaching the gospel to the people and himself and brother Johnson are the reason why the message is thousands of Believers are now all all over the Philippines uh following the message along with another brother by the name of brother Hart Larry Hart uh preaching the gospel and uh so God used them it made me think of men like brother Jerry Ro it made me think of many other men that were crisscrossing the world there was nobody to pay them there was nobody to uh pay their way or their Fair they worked on trucks they truck drivers they they were Ordinary People wherever and as soon as they got enough they went they went they went they they spread this oldfashioned gospel everywhere under the power of the Holy Spirit but now what do we have brother Bram said they will become soft begin to lose the faith some will not even go preach right here in the country or in the continent unless they know where they are going will provide them with appropriate offering I've even had one told me what we gave him was not enough and that he needed more uh to meet his expenses and stuff like that so provided him more but never had him again but I just just want to know that's the spirit that's prevailed upon the people even following this message they've lost sight of what this gospel is about it's the losing your life that you can save othersen it's giving up your all that you might Reach Out And Touch others it's it's become a a joke people like myself appear to them like being foolish uh you know uh what is this you talk about faith their faith is that they have to see or raise the amount of money they need for their trip or their flight or they're not going they're not walking out by real faith and trusting God Amen I'm not here to preach about that but I'm just trying to show you that a real servant a real missionary their look is not to their Brethren not to man it's not to Earth their look is to God their their Great Master and he is the one that's to lead them and guide them in every way amen he may decide to do it through people but that's not my business my business is to obey him and to follow his pathway and so he was actually trying and testing me to see if I would really go because was easy and I would be justified to say no no no because I didn't even we didn't even go to the doctor to check up to see what's happening no go so I went I arrived there already the the airline already wired ahead and they met me there with wheelchairs everything else and make sure you got off safely and took you you get safe to the car then you're not their responsibility anything happens to you they are not financially liable they make sure that they put you in that chair take you off so I got off and we went to the hotel during the entire trip while I was there I was in that pain you see me standing here when I came back on the flight I was still in that pain I was still in that in the wheelchairs again brought me back in the wheelchairs I come into the airp Port here wheelchair again and uh make sure not only they're making sure you get out there uh is there anybody waiting you outside they won't let me walk out they put me in the wheelchair brought me out and then when they saw my son they said okay you're going to take it from here in other words their responsibility end you can't sue them for anything after that because they right and of course I got placed into the car and um not allowed to fetch any bags or nothing and uh brought came home and I'm here because by the next morning I woke up the pain was less the next day less less it's still a bit in my back right now but during the entire week the pain has been receding receding completely and this is why I say that could only be God testing me and allowing that to happen to see what my reaction would be and I want to thank God I believe I remained faithful to his word and to his promise now the first service that we went into was the dedic ordination of brother Michael uh or day and the dedication of the Church Brothers do you all have some of the slides only one oh that's very strange you see there's 21 21 pictures in that folder and and I made sure I opened it up and looked at them all before I brought them here now I got here it's only one but anyway with with or without the picture just like brother coffee light or no light preach the gospel so um we did the dedication there but I wanted you to see some of the pictures of those people when the spirit of God strike them and their way of worship and H uh how they were just dancing around and men and women and the spirit of God upon them and God just blessed the church amen and we want to give glory to God maybe you allow us to show you that those pictures another time but uh um just imagine this brother with a little a little building made out of pieces of of um wood from trees that he could shave off the trees put them together and get some touch roof on top of it and God blessing that brother using him in such a way giving him favor with the king in that area seeing the changes of the people's lives and begin to urge them even though he doesn't believe Christianity he's still an animist and traditional but um uh gave the brothers some more land because it's benefiting the people uh and God blessed him in such a way uh that the the church moov from that little place and then we assisted him as you know we blessed him and he was able to build a little concrete Church um and uh they were rejoicing at that concrete church but now the building that he now has could fit maybe four or five of those uh it's about this size big as the size of this building and it's solid concrete that God has blessed him with and it's built in such a way that he's ready to put a second story on top so that offices and um if Brethren were to go and visit there would be apartment up there and stuff like that but just for you to know just because of our uh giving him for first of all the faith the revelation of the word and then secondly we backed it up by our giving small Gifts of Faith which was able to assist them and help them with their giving also is able to come to this point through these year time through the years and we want to give God the praise and honor for that amen I'm telling you you would be proud if you would see that and so um it was necessary for him to be ordained and uh just so you know already talked with uh the lawyer over there even before I went to see him I talked with the lawyer to make um arrangements for them to properly register uh register the church there there right because they have a different system that the church um has to be uh registered and it's the church that is the place that's appointed by the government to be able to marry people not the man but the church over here it's the man over there no it's the building because uh as was explain to me we are we consider ourselves a secular society so when it comes to the stuff in the church let the elders the deacons the pastor the Bishops deal with that we not into that deal with who you want to ordain or whatever you want to do and uh but with the marriage that has to do with the society now we have to do with that and so we registered the building right and so I made sure that I arranged for that uh with the lawyer to take care of of that and thank God for your ties your offerings with some of that I was able to made sure that the lawyer was is compensated he's got to continue to work after I'm gone CU I put him in touch with the pastor and they're working it out together for the glory of God Amen so then we had the great service where we ordained the brother by the laying on of hands uh along with brother coffee brother brother Desmond brother Robert was there too and we laid hands on the brother prayed over him and ordained him we explained before doing that to the people that to be the pastor and the minister we know he's already been ordained before the foundations of the world to be your leader and to be your pastor but for the society sake for the society's sake um for the respect of the society um for his usefulness in the society and we went on further to explain that many don't understand that a church is not just a spiritual institution but it it's one also who the government recognizes deals with social issues in the society so as a result um we know that that Minister needs the respect of the society that he has to serve not only the church he has to serve but the surrounding society that he has to serve he needs to have that respect and so uh this is also necessary right if that there was not that in the world he didn't need anything else but the the problem is it is there in the world and we have to face it and so we went on to speak and show them the importance of having the local church as a place instead of going to the patris and screaming out your problems and paying $300 as a sit in the chair you can come in the church and scream Hallelujah all you want and release your repressions loose all your inhibition and praise God and give glory to his [Applause] name you see I was giving them a reason so they understood why it was necessary for him to be ordained and for us to come and uh dedicate that church building we did the dedication one after the other he wanted to do two days but in the state I was in I could not go there one day come back the next day and then do another service it had to be just one day so I did the ordination and then did the dedication of the building explaining to them of course that it's not the building that needs the blessing it's you the congregation that needs the blessing and you are the real Church all of that begin to explain and preach to the people but uh nevertheless we want to dedicate this as a place where God's spirit can come and wait on you be wait for you uh when it's Church time the Holy Spirit the prophet said the holy spirit is already in the building he's already here and he's waiting on you to come into His presence so we began to explain all of that to them and what a blessing it was praise the Lord and and we pray that God will continue to bless them in such a wonderful way and to bless that brother in such a wonderful way to grow and expand his knowledge his understanding of the message and also his Outreach by the grace of God he has a great Zeal for that um of course his church is a small church because um there are evangelists over there that are just as big and bigger than some of the evangelists over here right um because I passed the compound of one of these people and the guy's place is like one or two blocks of buildings a church building to hold thousands I thought it was a Catholic church but it was not and so on you know so these brothers I pray God will continue to give give them a vision and to help them I don't have to worry about brother Michael he's got that Zeal because from the day we met him brother with a few people and and the spirit of God run the lights through the woods and get one bulb in there to be able to preach to the people in the bush and then when he preached and the congregation raised up the denomination threw him out right and we he heard the message we preached to him him he left there went on his own and went out and this is the result as we supported him so I want to thank God for you and your support that we are able to do this for the glory of God God bless every one of you here [Applause] today praise the Lord um and uh you must understand to leave the hotel to go to to where brother Michael's Church is it's a good hour and a half travel to do that and not an hour and a half on these beautiful highways that we have no we have a good hour and a half on um roads with potholes and when you've gone about half that distance then you really hit the road where I mean I tell you there's no way to avoid the potholes there's no way to dodge them they're everywhere so uh it's just you know like that my God I tell you and then understand with the pains that I was suffering the up and down and sudden bang oh bang oh all the way my goodness and I'm sure the devil must have been causing that to say okay you you should turn back now because my goodness look at that one there that now that's a big hole you thought you had oh but we pressed on by the grace of God so that is the kind of thing praise the Lord one lady wanted to come to the service um well we had to tell her no you won't be able to bear that you won't be able to take that uh distance and that kind of uh rough road so that's the kind of thing just to get to where brother Michael is because he went where um there was nobody and these people need to have the gospel and he took the gospel to to them well our next stop was brother Steven in Kumasi where um second largest city in Ghana and there we found that he was in a a bigger place than this than this a larger congregation and this of people and that was a a a Thursday night that was not even their Sunday morning uh and uh and so he he heard the message he believed the message and we just began to preach the word of God and there again a great blessing to them and he's in the state where he was just also handing over his church to a young Minister who happened to be The Interpreter uh handing over the church to him so we were both in the situation we were in a transition so it was just wonderful to talk with him and him to talk with me and for the gospel to go forth for the glory of God Amen and so we will keep in touch with them by God's grace next place uh we went to was to brother robbert akua and this is the brother that I you know he was in the other services but I saw him jumping and shouting Hallelujah and I was saying to brother coffee brother this brother seems to have a lot more understanding than some of the others but I understood why because later on I was able to understand that he has been watching our YouTube channel he has been watching it all the time and he said pastor I took what what you teach is just almost like I preach what Paul preached I took what you taught about the seals and about the church agents and every week I will take one and teach to the congregation just the same way so the people came up hearing the same word amen and what a blessing that was when I got there only to find out that that is the very area from whence my ancestry comes was traced right to the same area but I didn't know that he was in that area and so when I got there the people or tribes in that area were able to accept me as I am one of them they were able to see me from that the that uh line and so it g opened the door for me to share with them the word of God so I couldn't bring anyone sermon I was just speaking off the you know um off the lip and town just the word and it was just a blessing to them not knowing the reason why I was so scattered and going around the Holy Spirit was dealing with things in the church uh unknowing to me and the pastor said brother he says uh I I must confess that some of what you said even speaking speaking it was direct to me and for me all right it was dealing with me privately private things that the Holy Spirit just uh Expose and help me and also things in the congregation because sometimes there are things the pastor would like to tell the congregation but if he tells the congregation some of the people get mad and leave the church so sometimes the pastor will hesitate but you see now like brother coffee I just walk in there I don't know anybody I'm just here to preach the word so I preach the word amen and even if you don't want me I'm I'm gone tomorrow but that Pastor has to remain there and face those people if he said those things right so we preached the word and it helped to clean up the church and help to deal with certain problems that uh he had to deal with the Holy Spirit that's why you have five-fold a real five-fold Ministry and the spirit of God just begin to purge and deal with the church in a wonderful marvelous way thank God for that um and he's kept calling me because I came back the first night the morning I wake up I'm not even out of bed he calls me just hungry thirsty for the gospel and the message and yesterday called me again and praise the Lord and give him the glory to God so we thank God for him so we want to now do our best to see how we can help this brother Robert um because they are worshiping in a rented School room uh hot and everything else no washroom proper washroom they have to borrow one from somebody nearby and that sort of thing so he would like to do our best to be able to help him to slowly be able to have their own place of worship and be able to give glory and praise to God but what a blessing it was praise the Lord what a blessing when I thought about it that uh our work is not in vain amen and what we do and when myself Brother D brother Tim or whoever stands here it's not just talking to you this is going out to the world Amen and there are people some I don't know like I never knew this brother but he's been listening to and and that's what he's been feeding on uh there may be in India there may be in China they may be anywhere praise the Lord all we want to do is a blessing am praise the Lord and I want you to know this this is what this church was built on and is built on because when I came here came to this country $79 Us in my pocket and from there come to the place where God called me to preach to some people in St cines and the Lord moving in such a way that after a while when we needed a church building and had no money having faith in God trusting in his word and then going to the real estate and having the real estate agent come give me the price and then telling him that I would like to buy it and still not having the money now we talking about real Faith we're not talking about you going out and said well how much is it let's go raise the money and then you call that Faith No I'm talking about nothing out of nothing God create the world out of nothing right so I'm talking about real Faith so um we made the deal with the man said okay we're going to buy it but we have nothing but then all of a sudden bang here comes a brother uh he suddenly was in prayer and he feels led to send me 15 00 US and another one feels led by the Holy Spirit to send me500 us and I just praise God because I know that's the Holy Spirit operating because I didn't ask them I didn't beg anybody and then all of a sudden it comes together and there's the dunk payment and we were able to pay down on that property and that was the first property and God gave us Grace and wisdom how to move that up into um Bruce Dale uh that's the church up on in Hamilton that we had on the mountain in Hamilton at that time the name of our church was the Eagles cry Ministries that's when they took the picture and the eagle was seen in the um the sign of of the church we had a sign and brother Brooks I believe it was not even one of us brother Brooks took the picture and there was the eagle sitting in the nest just looking uh like that and all these wonderful Supernatural things and then God took us from there and brought us to Walker's line because now we are on a journey right the church is now in the wilderness uh traveling and from Walker's line God gave us Grace and this uh property uh came up for sale and one of the de their deacons came to me privately said you know I just feel led to tell you that this property is coming up for sale why don't you try and see if you can purchase it I said okay I will so um when I went and spoke with their lawyer asked them and they told me how many million dollars they want for it and when I'm going and prayer the Lord says no just tell them 1 million how you going to 1 million and they asking Millions for it they'll just say you're not a serious buyer but I learned to obey the spirit so that's the offer we placed in $1 million and when the that was placed in within the space of a week I got an answer your your your offer has been accepted you see the preser in Toronto the head office there they even though there were developers that was offering them millions that could purchase this property and develop it and whatever else and like that they rejected all of that and they gave it to us because we were Christians we we were Believers we want to hold to God's word we didn't agree we didn't believe what they believe but they just know we are Christians and so they signed it off the presbyter signed it off to us as Believers of the word of God Amen we thank God for that and so when I went to the lawyer to sign the papers uh like that I signed the papers and everything else the lawyer has this puzzled look on his face he says he says um do you realize what really happened here I said I think so he says and that's when he told me he says you know developers were here with their checkbooks open that they could sign off all the millions they were asking for and those people turned around and sold it to you all uh for for for 1 million he says tell me the truth who do you know because you have to know somebody of influence and of power to be able to bring about a deal like this is it not you know tell me the truth I said it was just God he said oh yeah God he was so dismissive he just oh yeah God God again everything like that is God he just would't believe it praise the Lord I walked out of his office and even at that point one of those developers hung around to meet me outside with his checkbook he says do you know you can make a big profit if you just just sell me this and I can write you a check for twice the amount or whatever right here now you will have this and I just look at him because I'm looking at him he don't understand what I am seeing I'm looking at the same one that spoke to Jesus said turn on yourself from here and you can get bread you know you know this will happen or that will happen you know I said no no no I said God gave us this this is our church home you know it's not the value so much that I'm impressed with them was that we were directed to be here and that's why we are here today and that's we praising God Amen so um I want you to know that I appreciate every one of you you have not followed me because I have any desires to wealth or riches everybody wants to be able to have a good life don't you you want to live happily you want to live without care yes everyone wants to be like that but I've never for once never at any time had the inclination to look after betterment for my in terms of wealth for myself or increase or oh you know like some evangelists do hand over the church to my cousin to my my my uncle to my daughter to my son no no no no no this is got nothing of flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of God real love of God has to do with Brothers and sisters who are your real brothers and sisters praise God I know I'm saying it but that's not real to a lot of people their flesh and blood is more important to them than their brothers and sisters spiritually speaking one being Eternal and the other one is just temporal not that you're not to love them but you got to understand the difference one you're going to live through all eternity with the other is going to pass on and pass away amen so let's put our faith in the right place praise God it's 5 to one and now you know I'm milking it now I'm I'm going to be finish in just a minute but I'm just wanting you to know that and so I'm been raised that way I seen my mother and father didn't know about this message but still they won't join any denomination until years later when I grew up after all those home Bible readings and memorizing the Bible and worshiping by themselves and they don't know why but they don't want to join no denomination and um here it is they will be going out and my mother and my father and they weren't ashamed they go on the street and preach the gospel El they'll go out and preach the gospel to win souls to Christ and not only that they will feed the hungry uh they'll help the poor and the downtrodden sister Simon before and when we got married was a absolutely a witness of some of this where some of those people sent for them and ready to sign all their property and everything over on many occasions not once and they said no you don't understand this is not what this is about we are not here for that and it absolutely rejected it I guess some of that influence came off on me so I have had no desire to preach the gospel for profit uh preach the gospel for this or that not for fame or for whatever but to always let him have the glory amen let him be glorified listen friends this is real this is true the gospel the devil is spawning such a Web of Lies and of evil in this hour that we're living in darkness all over the land amen uh one of the messages I preached over there getting used to the dark you know and I explained to them how I was in a restaurant and you know the restaurant was dark and but when I sat there long enough waiting on a meal all of a sudden I start being able to see in the dark I could see in the dark and you know I preach like that that's what's happened with some of you you comfortable now with the darkness around you and you you because you can get along with the people around you but Jesus said Darkness will cover the Earth and cover the of people right thick darkness and so we preach along that line and we give God the grace that was able to open their eyes of their hearts and I praise God for every one of you here today amen and as I step aside on December 31st uh brother Danny uh mazili comes to this place he's coming to follow the word of God he will not be used my style or my way of preaching because I as I as I explained to him and a few of the brothers my uh our group of of of preachers the first wave that came out after brother brandham whom he called young men like Billy Paul like myself like many others he called us young men wait till until them young men come after me they're going to break this whole thing down so that you'll be able to understand right um many others praise God some uh brother Frank in Germany brother Coleman different ones these are all people I knew um and and in those days we were all preaching the message we didn't have all these little offshoots of this that that and all kinds of differences but um we we all preach it together for the glory of God so brother sister that wave of men God used us to chop down the forest get rid of those big old naughty trees denominational opposition Fearless to break it down and thinking not of ourselves but thinking of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen to clear the way Hallelujah so that a next wave will come right we who cleared the off these trees and planted the seeds of the gospel and it started to come up and bear fruit but now God is looking to you for Harvesters God is looking to you to reap the Harvest amen praise the Lord and that's what God wants you to do so he the Lord of harvest sweetly call brother Mike amen who will go and work for me today who will bring to me the lost and dying I will who will Point them to the narrow way I'm in a message I'm in the message wonderful but there is to be a way we have the message but inside of that message Jesus said there's a way and there's a way in the way like just the highway you have the highway but you got Lanes in the highway stay in your lane amen and let the Holy Spirit use you for his glory and for his honor and together we'll meet again if we don't meet on this Earth we'll meet again on the other side to
