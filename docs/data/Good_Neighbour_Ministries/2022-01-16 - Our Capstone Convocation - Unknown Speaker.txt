god yes here we are and i greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ for this is indeed a great joy and privilege when the saints of god from everywhere get together in the name of our lord jesus christ now we would love we will speak on the subject of our capstone convocation we want to for you to draw nearer in your thinking and understanding on this marvelous subject of the invisible assembly union convocation of the saints of the living god not by advertisements not by congregations of men attracted to some program plan convention camp meeting whatsoever you call it but something spontaneous coming from in the soul that draws and attracts the true believers together as eagles are drawn together around the caucus the word of god hallelujah may the same holy spirit of almighty god draw our souls together and bring us to a place when we recognize and realize we are looking at the same thing we are seeing the same thing oh praise god and we are here together as the assembly of the force-born giving glory and praise to god now in our bibles in the old testament reading leviticus chapter 23 verse 39 also in the 15th day of the seventh month when you have gathered in the fruit of the land you shall keep a feast unto the lord for seven days and on the first day that shall be a sabbath and on the eighth day that shall be a sabbath amen now let us turn our attention to the new testament we read from the gospel of john chapter 7 reading from verse 1 to 2 then verses 37 to 39. after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him now the feast of tabernacles was at hand in the last day the great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this specie of the spirit which they that believe on him would receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because jesus was not yet glorified now let us pray loving gracious and eternal heavenly father abba father we give you praise and honor and glory here today honoring you by assembling ourselves together father as the lord jesus as we see that glorious day approaching we draw closer to thee and closer to one another may the holy spirit now draw near may your presence be real and realized in the preaching and this of the word and reception of the word of god to thee be the glory and the honor in jesus name amen now both scriptures that we have just read speak about the feast of tabernacles or feast of boots the of boats or tents now according to the scripture this feast was to last for eight days seven days and the next day would be the eighth day of that great feast and this feast of boots or tabernacles or if you want to say tents or the jews will say sukkas then it is a type of course of these earthly tabernacles that we are living in these are types and shadows of the bodies of which we dwell in and this was to remind israel that they were only pilgrims they're only strangers they were only passing through that land and they were not uh to think in their minds that that's that's it that was the end all of it it was to remind them as it is to remind us that even though we may be blessed become rich become uh just prosperous successful in every way and even though within our society our nation we develop a great reputation of fame uh notoriety and we are recognized by the multitude everywhere or even if they became admired admired and looked up to in their their society in which they lived god wanted them to never never forget but to always remember hallelujah that they were pilgrims and strangers within whichever land they were this world to the believer is not our homes we are just a passing through and our treasures our homeland lies beyond the blue for we are pilgrims strangers aliens from another land an eternal land an invisible land oh and we've come here to bear testimony to fulfill our father's purpose to magnify his great honorable and mighty name oh praise god forevermore hallelujah and it was to remind them as it is to remind us that as the fat seed of abraham that we are pilgrims and strangers listen in time and on this earth we are just a passing through oh we come from god and we are now on our way traveling back to god we come from the eternal realms of glory and we are here passing through as the scripture has said i passed you through the wilderness for i wanted to test you try you and prove you oh praise god hallelujah and now i've always said testing time approving time preparation time is never lost time so god is bringing us through this marvelous time praise god hallelujah amen for the real pilgrims and strangers and i repeat this that you might uh remember it strangers in time we are even strangers in this our present day time we are also strangers on the earth with us strange ways our strange way of thinking with our love for the word of god becoming something strange so we are pilgrims and we are strangers as it says in the book of hebrews chapter 11 reading from verse 8. hallelujah listen to the word of god amen by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing will he went by faith he's adjourned in that land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hacked foundations whose builder and maker is god oh thank god hebrews 13 tells us for here we have no continuing city but we are seeking a city to come hallelujah amen yes this feast of tabernacles is also called the feast of in gathering a time of reaping and a time of rejoicing bringing in the sheaves from the fields and given glory and praise to god leviticus 23 speaks verse 10 speak on to the children of israel and say unto them when you have come into the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring the sheave of the first fruits hallelujah for of the harvest unto the priests glory to god hallelujah you see that was just a tape or a shadow pointing to the time of ripened harvest at the end of the church ages hallelujah that harvest is now being reaped across the world brothers ministers everywhere burning the torches of the gospel torch of the word of god shining lights into dark places throwing out the oh the lifeline the fallen shipwreck brothers that have even fallen away from this world lifelines are being thrown out to you oh praise god some brothers have been blessed just to be able to set up places that are hubs of information and dissemination of the word of god voices of declaration to manifest the word and promise of this hour bless god forevermore and god is using them in a mighty and in a wonderful way because this is the time of bringing in the sheaves of the harvest that we represented to our high priest jesus christ hallelujah this is the time this is the hour this is our capstone convocation now in progress glory be to god hallelujah amen now in john chapter 7 jesus went to the feast of the tabernacles which was an eighth day feast eight day feast for on the first seven days they would have the feast and then he said on that last day the eighth day the great day of the feast jesus stood up and cried hallelujah i want you to notice that during the seven feast days he did not speak really to the people until the eighth day that he spoke openly to the people and publicly to all making sure that his voice was heard now during this our hour seven day feast day of the seven church ages seven day week of the church ages jesus attended the feast hallelujah he did attend the feast but he attended the feast as he did back there moving among the people on observe not attracting too much of attention and just chatting with various groups of people round about until the hour was come and then he would lift up his voice even so this great holy spirit came amongst us down through the seven chart changes until into this seventh last church age doing what observing and investigating judgment at the same time while using the ministry of our dear precious brother the 20th century prophet brother william marion branham and i take god for him many run away from that name many don't want to hear that name others misuse the name others use the name for their prophet profit others monetize that name for their own benefit but my friends now listen let me stop here for a moment i'm not talking about brothers groups that have to send out tapes books uh materials that people need and are sending them out almost at cost just to get the work done that is not what i'm talking about but i'm talking of those who will deliberately and many of them not even fully believing this message of this prophet but seeing the benefit of his notoriety name fame and how his message has filtered out and spread across the world they're trying to take advantage of that by by putting little pieces and snippets here and a snippet there within their talks within their video talks to attract the attention of the believer and of the public to be able to benefit monetarily from it and to turn it into something based on a profit estimate and not upon the sacred signs the of and the sacred word of the living god which we live by for his glory and honor i want to praise god i never saw brother william branham i never met brother william branham in the flesh i never talked with him to him or anything of that matter i was in another land when he was still alive oh but praise god i can say to you that the things you have said are not imagination was not religious tricks or some mischievousness of the machinations of the mind of some uh smart man this was a dedicated holy sacred simple man that gave his entire life for this gospel to lift up the name of jesus christ now and forevermore thank god he used the man and use his ministry and now as then through his life is using and continues to use his ever living none and not non-dying message because the messenger may go but this message lives on forevermore and it will take us right into the very presence of the living god yes jesus christ the risen christ use this wonderful brother hallelujah use his ministry use his message to manifest and to make people conscious now and aware that there is an invisible being here with this man now that person is with the elect of god the bride of christ hallelujah he wanted them to become conscious that the same god they read about in the old testament in the new testament that same god was now here by his living presence and making himself known through the life of a dedicated man as he will through the lies and and walk and talk of dedicated men and women that will simply surrender and humble themselves in the presence of god oh think of it manifesting his presence at the seven day feast during the seven church ages he manifested himself using the various messengers manifested himself justificat justification as sanctification as oh as the baptism of the holy ghost manifesting himself in an increasing crescendo coming up to the fullness of the word and the consummation of the ages hallelujah and here he manifested himself how in this seven church this great gentile dispensation all of these seven church ages and in this one he has used this brother william branham by using him by the agency of two major gifts that he placed within his life for as he was with moses so was he with our dear brother if you would believe the first sign they'll have to believe the second sign and so was it with our dear brother if you thought he was just another healing evangelist like the many many that were on the field of which i know of oh praise god and while they were all moving around the field at that time whether it be a a allen oral roberts velma gardner w.b grant what jack cole whatever the names of those brothers and many many others anointed man man regardless of denomination upc a symbols of god church of god church of god and christ oh many mighty men of various tribes being used of god in mighty wonderful wonderful marvelous ways hallelujah and here he was moving around mount them just also like he was just another one but then god moved him into the second agency the second gift and said now by this sign they'll know that this is not some trick or some human thing no man can do these miracles except god be with him and so the second gift of the discernment of spirits amen looking into the lives of people displaying to them that this was no ordinary natural gift but it was supernatural looking into their past looking into their present telling them what happened when there were children telling them what was going to happen oh manifest in the word telling them what they just said to somebody just outside i spoke personally to one man who was in one of those meetings he had a letter in his pocket from his wife and he had spoken to nobody about it but there from the platform our precious brother said sir do you believe said yes sir i do he said oh i see you you have a letter uh from your wife in in your pocket right now and in the letter listen to this he says she tells you and he begins to tell him what is in the letter that this and that he told him what was in the letter word for word and then says i see you're not from this country i see water oh europe from across the europe and he named the country he says go back and he calls the man's name mr so and so go back where you come from your wife's left foot is healed thus saith the lord and so it was and it came to pass to the glory and praise of god so i'm trying to tell you that this second gift was so beyond anything the world has ever seen since the time of jesus christ himself when he said uh not oh before philip called you nathaniel i saw you when you were under the fig tree oh praise god and he was just trying to let the world know he has returned again but now here he is using a human form to manifest himself for the glory of god hallelujah but when that season of manifesting himself to attract the attentions of the crowd to attract the attention of the people for what god was doing through him thousands and thousands of people being healed and delivered and the secret things of their hearts being revealed and made known and when they're really attracted to that ministry then the bible said he began to declare his message hallelujah they began to declare the doctrine straighten out all the twisted perverted doctrines that the devil had messed up in the church of the living god hallelujah as it was he lifted up his voice at the last day the eighth day of the feast the capstone of the entire feast he lifted up his voice and he cried out hallelujah oh let me read from the word of god hallelujah and in the last day the great day of the feast jesus stood up and cried if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the spirit said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters what was he speaking of the holy ghost amen thus speaking of the spirit the bible tells you that that he was speaking of the spirit but the spirit was made known or he spoke of it when he lifted up his voice on the eighth day the last day of the feast hallelujah oh praise god and now on our in our time after the seven church changes are over amen the seventh church ages are over here comes the mighty angel of god one foot on the land and one on the sea oh praise god that's in the bible but right here on mount sunset in the united states here with brother william branham goes to the top of that mountain amen which i was blessed of god amen to see that how he went up there and there he looks and sees angels flying coming towards him he said the rest were something else they were men type of men of earth but this one that was in the front of them leading coming faster than us jet with the mighty angel with the swept back wings oh praise god like a a bomber from heaven with the bombs of the revelation of the word of god hallelujah but now mighty angel revelation 10 1 angel with the swept back wings not a man of earth he said but the lord from heaven it was christ himself in that shape and in that form coming to do what to be now his own prophet hallelujah why because the prophet of malachi 4 5 the 20th century prophet the man named william branham was now dead as he said moses my servant is dead i and cross over this jordan this jordan hallelujah praise god and so he has come back in the form of the mighty angel with the swept back wings glory to god hallelujah amen and to be his own prophet and to be his own voice praise god hallelujah and to be his own interpreter of the word and to make all things clear for god's glory and honor and then as he interprets the word hallelujah what does he do he uses his bright body his bright body to amplify his voice to the world that is the lifting of his voice in this hour for there in the bible he lifted up his voice and he cried hallelujah oh my he lifted up his voice and he cried and now he is crying out through the many membered body of his bride through spiritual amplification of this message using her as a mike megaphone for his honor and for his glory yes the feast has already started the feast had started jesus slipped amongst them just doing a few things here and there that only groups of people as he begins to speak to small groups as he did in our time speaking to small groups in the chur during this last church age goes over and preaches over here preachers over there preaches over there speaking to small dedicated groups whatever stripe whatever name whatever they call themselves he declared the word to these dedicated groups during the church age while attending the feast speaking to small pockets of people everywhere to get their attention and while he was doing that you had a lot of pharisees and sad uses that were right there to hinder the black ball his name his ministry his work and teaching and so blinded to the word of god many would say oh he he never had a a high school education a grade school education just went to the eighth grade or whatever he like that and uh he didn't know anything so how could he be a teacher that tells you right there they don't even know the way of a true prophet many of them men coming out of the wilderness many of them that trade was cow herding or sheepherding farmers man that didn't know anything and god deliberately wanted to use mine like that because they had no education no thinking no smartness no cunning no slickness no intelligence of themselves but when the people would hear the word coming out of them and the works of the holy spirit being made manifest through them they had to recognize no man could do these things except it was god using him and declared himself for his glory oh my so was it with our dear brother until this time when now the messenger was gone the mighty angel the messenger of this eternal church age has come down amongst us and lifts up his voice declaring himself oh praise god through the opening of the word revealing himself through the word and using his bride to amplify his voice to wherever it is that it might go forth for his glory and for his honor hallelujah amen oh my these pharisees and sadducees back there and you still have them today because some of them are so far from the word you see and some of them are so sad about this kind of preaching and this kind of message you see oh my oh they're far from it they don't recognize it and they will send cunning men smart to intermingle to try to shame embarrass destroy disrupt dislocate misinform oh my misplace this word of god away from god's own people but friends you can do away with the messenger you can even kill the messenger but you cannot kill this message for the word of god shall not return to him void it has been spoken so shall it be done for his glory and for his honor hallelujah oh praise god now here we are in this last day of the feast that at the eighth day of the feast he lifted up his voice and he cried hallelujah oh praise god i want to tell you in this last day this day that we're in he has lifted up his voice again oh praise god he lifted it up and he's lifted it up into a higher octave he has lifted up the word the message the revelation of the word into a higher dimension for his glory and for his honor oh praise god then the prophet said oh oh oh two o'clock is past oh oh the third pole is now at hand glory to god the first two pulls are path now the third pull the spoken word the revelation of the spoken word the unwritten word praise god hallelujah oh my you only had a length of time in which you could pass the word you can presume what the word you can analyze the word debate the word you can take a computer and triangulate the word and use every possible thing that the computer has oh my but let me tell you oh god by his great holy spirit is now unveiling himself by the very revelation of his voice of his word hallelujah now if you're listening recognize what i'm saying he's lifted up his voice to a higher dimension put his word into a hierarchy and the word is making itself known to them to whom should receive it hallelujah glory to god amen on which near the feast that he lifted up not on the seventh day no sir not during the seven church ages but he lifts up his voice and cries hallelujah oh praise god in the eighth day glory to god i want you to know in our time that god has operated on the cover during these seven church ages on the cover amen hallelujah not behind got skins not behind badger skins but behind the human skin of the prophet william marion branham and now he is operating behind the human skin of a bright body of believers to fulfill revelation luke 17 the son of man being revealed again hallelujah the head has come back to the body the capstone has come down back to the pyramid the um the husband has come to the wife and the entire thing is now fixing to go home for the glory of god oh praise god hallelujah yes there he was all the time in the feasts opened to the public yet on the cover oh my he was actually hiding in the light and he was that light oh praise god out in the public yet they couldn't see him couldn't recognize him hallelujah but now he has come down as the mighty angel of revelation 10 take god and now that these ages are over he has lifted up his voice the voice of his word he's lifted it into a higher octave or a higher dimension or praise god just like the scripture says in revelation 10 3 and when the mighty angel road cried with a loud voice he cried with a loud voice hallelujah and as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven sanders the bride with the word in her the full restored world now the fullness of the word the completion of the great revelation of christ the mystery of god being revealed oh hallelujah the full restoration the word in all its glory and it's complete less now here and the seven church ages are over and our capstone day of revelation convocation is right here in the soul of man who would believe his word he said out of their inner being that's what he meant by out of their bellies out to your inner being will flow rivers of living waters hallelujah not dead word not past age word not something like that no but living present tense word of god pouring gushing out ever present water from the rock for his glory and for his honor glory to god hallelujah amen yes sir i want you to see here the seven church ages are over and the eighth day is already now in progress this will take us to rapture right into the millennium amen which will be the fullness of it all oh blessed be the lord god of hosts amen stature of a perfect man paragraph 31 go read it for yourself go listen it for yourself not something made up but the voice of god speaking through a prophet saying now we are approaching the seven seals we have just finished the seven church ages and this is a message on teaching that ties the man in that's going to be redeemed by the blood of the lord jesus christ and is going to be in that church age the eternal church age at the end of the seals hallelujah i did not make up that terminology of eternal church age or speaking something of the figments of my imagination i did not say anything of that nature eternal church age eternal day he said this will be at the end of the seals in other words you come to the seventh seal it opens up and those who have no eyes no heirs were giving no such ability and facility can't see can't understand don't know what it says but the elected sees and knows by revelation for the great prophet had already said for they shall know when it is time for them to know and that time is here it's now they are in a power of god the moving of the holy spirit within the lines and the hearts of the believers that are elected to hear and to see the manifested word of god hallelujah amen what does it all mean brothers and sisters we are again at the crossing of jordan just as joshua and israel was hallelujah they crossed jordan back there but now the holy spirit is calling us to cross the gap and to grow from the ages into the capstone for for the great convocation hallelujah and the only one that can take you over is joshua the only one can take you over now is the holy ghost himself no one else can educate you and bring you in drag you in persuade you in or educate you in in no way can't be can't be copycatted can not be impersonated you can't do it it's the holy spirit by grace by himself amen no man can say of himself that it is his this his revelation his that his ear no we don't know anything we don't have anything but he has everything and the holy spirit makes himself known by the word of god hallelujah we're the cross from the church ages into the capstone convocation by the great holy spirit amen and said for the bible said joshua said to them rise israel sanctify yourselves for tomorrow you're going in the rapture tomorrow you're going to cross over you're crossing over to the other side so sanctify yourselves hallelujah you said circumcise yourselves glory to god don't you know circumcision was done on the eighth day hallelujah what does it all mean circumcision was done on the eighth day all male children of israel as god said you'll circumcise them of the foreskin hallelujah and now we'll be circumcised by the great holy spirit as we are preparing to cross into get over into that land spiritually now and into the rapture to move into the presence of god we know circumcision was always done on the eighth day because we have the example of mary herself knowing such things bringing jesus the word the the word in its infancy bringing her him in her arms into the temple to be uh vindicated by simeon and anna on the inspiration of the great holy spirit hallelujah luke chapter 2 verse 21 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the word of the child amen his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb oh my hallelujah i want to thank god that the prophet of god has preached and stored up the word of god to so that that word can be used to circumcise us from denominationalism from false doctrines to circumcise us from fleshiness carnality worldliness skin deep religion and to circumcise us from the dregs and the dross of all the teachings that come down through the church ages even into this church age and even into this message there is much drugs and dross that has to be sanctified out of the message and out of the individual lives of the believers amen as we prepare ourselves we got to get rid of the cockleburst that has attached themselves to us during this stage of the journey as we pass through the wilderness of this life we find this cockle bird come teachings doctrines ideas thoughts come to attach themselves to your body to your mind to your heart hallelujah and the holy spirit is saying you got to cross over to the capstone convocation you got to cross from the wilderness to the promised land you must sacrifice or allow the holy spirit to sacrifice you and the priests to be able to look and see that you are satisfied hallelujah yes we are in a season of confusion we're in a season of carnality indiscretion oh no reverence unbelief is everywhere friends doubt fear spiritual blindness deafness is everywhere in this church age hallelujah and the message left by this prophet a sharp knife of the word of god hebrews 4 12 is able to circumcise body spirit and soul clean clean and dress you with the white robes of righteousness by the great power and presence of the holy spirit of the living god amen yes my friends amen and the holy spirit is not cutting off all those things from us cutting off personalities from us cutting off all this kind of a complex for for all kinds of dignities and great person and great places and great this and great that list we have no shrines we have no sanctuaries we have no sacred places we have no sacred rocks we have no sacred shiny objects that we adore that will take our eyes off of the word of god to look to places are to men or the things amen oh this is no monkey business where we are attracted by shiny objects our eyes are fixed upon the word of god our eyes are lifted up upon him the mighty one all praise god forevermore and so the holy spirit has to take that away from us so that the new birth can take place in the hearts of the elect yes they redeem their gathering in wash like the snow and free from all sin oh now i will shout how we will sing for the redeemed that seeing the word are gathering in oh praise god hallelujah yes amen thank god what does this all mean it means that the shepherd is now calling his sheep by his mighty voice that he has now lifted into a heart dimension amen that is why he said oh unto thee you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven god but unto them it is not given he that hath an ear to hear let him or her hear the word of god oh praise god forevermore yes sent forto infill us the presence of the holy spirit as in acts 3 19 glory to god sending upon us the times of refreshing coming from the presence of the lord waves of glory waves of anointing waves of revelation or another tide is rolling in amen oh that will save your soul from sin it'll cleanse you from evil it'll wash you from the dregs on and carry over from other ages it'll take all of that away from you and set you free no wonder he said i stand at the door and knock hallelujah if any man opens i will i will come in with him and i will have a feast with him i'm going to sup with him hallelujah and there together we'll have communion around the word of god i'll tell you about myself we'll talk about jesus hallelujah the king of kings is he the lord of lord supreme the god of all eternity come to earth again amen yes sir the church has journeyed through the seven church ages from ephesian age right on true to the leophecian church age which now has come to its end amen which we are in physically but spiritually the enlightened ones though the ones to whom has been revelated from the word have already entered into their supernatural presence of god this eighth day this capstone amen if already entered in it hallelujah and this eternal day all praise has brought them right back full circle to the genuine eight day our first day experience again that the apostles had that paul had for the glory of god oh blessed be the name of the lord god forever the holy ghost is back in the church again and i say that now he was always as i said in the church working quietly but now he raises his voice like a trumpet he raises his voice as a roar of a mighty lion as the mighty thunderings of mighty waters seven thunders utter their voices the full word completion of the word of god the christ the mystery of god now being revealed hallelujah amen so he is no more bound anymore by the name national rivers we are not bound oh but we are no more by any rivers of babylon we're not bound there and we have to sit down and drink and eat whatever is given to us hallelujah no more we not imprisoned by those rivers by our thoughts by our beliefs in our mind in our walk we are free we've been set free by the word of god your your chains of darkness have gone from you your shackles have been freed from you broken from you the mighty lamb of the tribe of judah has broke every chain and set every captive free that believes him and believes his word oh glory be to god hallelujah amen thank god my friends the fullness of the word is back in the church of god again and when i say full mess though i mean the fullness of the word not only the rima the visible visible part of the world that we can read and debate and educate ourselves into religion by and by natural understanding be able to understand it and be able to parse it but i'm talking about that supernatural invisible part the low g the logos part of the word unseen word unwritten word purifier living presence of a living god in the midst of his people hallelujah and his presence back in the church again causes the true elect
