[Music] God bless you all this morning and may the Holy Spirit reward you for your faith and your patience uh there's a purpose in everything that God does you know there was an accident actually and a re-routing and that sort of stuff but we're happy that we can be here the reason why God allow our brother to sing himself out like that and have you wash the pain because the singing always goes before the word comes forth so God must have a special word for you this morning to bless your heart and souls with no delay we'll look to the word of God God bless you all thank you so much for the music and the singing we appreciate you very much God bless you uh visiting Brothers we're happy to have you here in the house of the Lord and each of you Saints faithful uh we thank you for that so much amen as we look to the Lord Matthew 22 verses 1 to 14. and it's speaking about the great parable at that time Herod that attract her heard of the fame of Jesus and said unto his servants this is John the Baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore Mighty works are done in Him Praise the Lord glory to God and we thank the Lord for that word that we read there and we pray the Holy Spirit will continue to no I'm reading the wrong place actually signs of getting older all right and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent forts's servants to call them that were bitten to the wedding and they would not come again he sent four servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the feast the marriage and they made light of it and went their ways everyone to his farm another one to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and then treated them spitefully and slew them and when the king heard thereof he was angry Roth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burnt up their City then said he to his servants the wedding is ready but there which were bitten were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so these servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests amen and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he said unto him friend how chemist Dell in hither not having a wedding government and he was speechless and when the king and then said the king to the service bind him hand and foot take him away cast him into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen and that is my scripture for today called are chosen please let us look to the Lord gracious father be thank you for the reading of the word we thank you for these who with prepared hearts have come to the house of God to receive your word for the day May the Holy Spirit Grant to us Grace and draw near to us father for being ourselves have nothing of our own but may your mind be able to flow through us as we surrender ourselves to Divine misery of preaching to the glory of the great name and your divine presence here Among Us in the name of Jesus Christ just settle down upon us father and hover over us and and and and warm our hearts that we might receive the engrafted word and to you be all the praise Theon and the glory that their eyes may see Jesus only amen praise the Lord God bless you all please be seated thank God what you have here today is one of the greatest privileges that we can ever have is not just a sitting church but to actually be conscious and aware that you are seated in the presence of our invisible King it is a great privilege of course and uh I I counted that we are alive in the greatest times of our lives here when we live here in the presence of the Living God because we are gathering here because we we're gathering around the world is simply in heaven we will gather around the throne uh we will be there worshiping singing praising God and giving him glory but we're starting it now down here so when we get up there it's not going to be strange for us because we already know and uh since this wonderful feeling of what it means to be in the presence of the Lord hallelujah praise God I don't know about you but I've come into the presence of God that uh if our heavenly father would want to reveal some more to us something else to us that will help us to grow and ripen in the presence of God and lose any greenness any bitterness any uh sourness that we may have in our personalities our our lives or our families our homes that the great Holy Spirit might break every chain lose every prisoner open up the way and that God may receive all the praise and the honor and the glory amen May Our Lives be centered around him and around his word that we may all grow in this hour when we know the Death Star has risen with healing in his wings the light is shining upon us and the mercy of God is moving among us to his praise and honor and Glory as I've said here my topic is called are chosen and I want you to understand who are called and who is chosen who are called and who are chosen because the Bible does immediately give us two groups there the called and the chosen this is not my saying it's the word and I'm just saying what the word said back then I'm saying it now for this day and for this time and for this hour amen so we are gathered here and we come here together for this one purpose that we may be certain of God and we can make ourselves assured which group we're in and we can rejoice in knowing which group we are in in the presence of the Lord hallelujah amen now in this Parable Jesus is talking about a certain King uh having a son and having a wedding supper for that son in reality he is really talking about God the Father having a spiritual marriage for his son amen and uh and is telling us the entire story in a form of a parable so using not true things to symbolize spiritual things that from the natural we'll be able to gain an understanding of the supernatural and that is why we are here you know the story The King told them to go find people because the first group that he had invited to come they refused to come they made light of it they laughed they mocked they thought it was all a joke my just think of it indeed now you have to understand that God sent a prophet in this hour with a message with a shout and that shout was to call us out praise the Lord and like I say we are not called with the shout to go wandering about we were we were not called to go wandering and wondering if this is somewhere if this is sore is that right is this right we're not called to wander we are called to go into the promised land of the word of God for this hour that is has been revealed is being revealed and will continue to be revealed as long as we are here on this earth I praise God and then it will take us out of here but for now we are called to be in the presence of almighty God Amen praise the Lord now you know how it went that they went out and they tried calling the people in and they won't come so he says go out again and now call him The Good The Bad and The Ugly call everybody in no matter what they are I am going to give them a wedding garment so they can come in in other words it doesn't matter who they are what their lies were like what they've done where they come from I'm gonna wash them I'm gonna clean them up I'm going to give them a wedding card man and I'm going to invite them into this Feast that the others refuse to come into aren't you glad that you were invited to be inside of this oh praise God hallelujah amen now the thing about this story coming to the end of it says that all those people were already told that well I'll find other folks the king came into the wedding and when he came into the supper there was a man somehow slipped in there not having a wedding garment not to go over uh Eastern polity or Eastern Customs but that they would provide you with this suit in other words you don't have to go and buy your your suit and your tie and all that stuff they were Rich enough they provided you with the suit to attend the wedding and the suits were a certain color and then when everybody should be wearing purple or whatever color this guy turns up with a gray he turns up with a gray suit on and the King says friend how how did you get in here just uh not having a wedding garment you have a different type of of suit on here amen the Bible says and the person was speechless they couldn't speak and I'll tell you why that person could not speak because they were shocked they were shocked that they were not ready for the rapture praise God they were so sharp with the word they had so many quotes on the word they were so educated and informed with the word they can bury you they can plaster you they can paint your wall with all those things and so he felt that that he had the right he should be in there he should be in there because actually he looks better in the suit than some of the people who are invited uh or who are in there but but the Lord himself says no friend that's not a wedding garment all your knowledge all your wisdom all that you covered with that is not a wedding garment the wedding garment is the one I give to you nobody else can give you that kind of wedding garment you can't dress yourself with that kind of wedding garment unless I give it to you you cannot come in to be a part of the Bride unless God himself reveals himself his word to you for you to know him in the power of his resurrection says not by human education it's not by religious knowledge it's not by length of time that you were in the message or in Christianity It Is by God's faith God's word God's revelation on his word doesn't matter if you came in in the morning and you're the last one coming in the evening he says same pay same salvation there is no bigger richer better salvation than the one he has given to everyone from Luther right on down to this hour that we are living in it's the same salvation that we are enjoying do you believe that yes sir that's what we have here Among Us here today by the grace of God hallelujah amen the man was speechless why he is thought that he was doing something right and we see understand brother bran when he says oh friends watch it there will be a lot of disappointments on the day of judgment because this man felt he was absolutely right he knew how to take that word and tie it together explain it but you know go down to the profundity of it and bring up all the Deep things and so on like that but you see they don't realize that God's depths are hidden in simplicity and they revealed again true simplicity and when you are not watching or you think it's not relevant he said watch the prophet said watch it it'll go right past you you won't even recognize it you won't even realize what's really going on Amen praise God hallelujah amen all of a sudden the king himself tells him you are wrong while he was on Earth no man could tell him he was wrong because he knew that word so much that he could bury anybody that would come against him but the king himself comes and says no friends you are wrong you are absolutely off the word you're wrong and so he was speechless he didn't know what he could say praise God and the King turned to the other servant says now bind him hand and foot don't let him run all over the world spreading the nonsense he's talking about buying his foot and bind his arms and you take him and cast him into outer Darkness cast him out out there amen praise the Lord many are called but few are chosen many are called but few are chosen are you in the cold or the chosen this is the question that is being asked here today by the grace of God hallelujah and without the opening of The Seven Zeals I'm telling you friends we would still be wrestling with the understanding of many of these things we'll still be wondering what does this mean or what does that mean but I thank God for the opening of those Seven Seals that has opened up our understanding that we might know him the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah amen now many are called called means invited in other words we will use the word you can say use the word invited many are invited amen now the gospel goes out to everybody whosoever will May Come Mania called everybody is called the net is thrown out and it goes over all kinds of fish and everybody is called many are called amen but one day you see the fisherman has to bring everything to the shore and then he opens up the neck with everything on it and lo and behold it wasn't all fish that he caught that poor Pastor that thought that all he had in there was rainbow trout we're going to find out that he had some spiders he had some crabs he had some crawfish he had some bottom feeding fish amen yes sir he had some that will eat the filth and the dirt of this world and don't want the real clean things that come from the word of God yes sir he begins to find out there was even a few snakes that were in there that almost bit him when he's trained to do his work God have mercy yes it has actually happened I know what it is because that actually happened with me and this time it wasn't a small snake it was one as fat as my arm and he just came up like that and of course I ran back you know I'm not as Brave as you but I ran back and I used a a Big Bamboo and pushed it at here but he just wrapped around it and his constriction it started to crack crack that would have been my bones if he had caught a hold of me but in any case that is actually what happened amen so many are called many are invited but chosen means elective means selected out of all the guests all of those invitees there were some selected they were invited and unselected by the king to come in Praise the Lord so let's say it this way many years are given an invitation to come to the wedding supper but few are chosen to be in The Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah many call to the wedding supper everybody claims that they are a part of it and they want to attend it praise the Lord now let's go to a quotation the invisible Union around page 88. brother Branham is stalking and he's talking about the book of life and stuff like that now now we are just ready for one thing and that is the coming of the Lord hallelujah are you ready for that are you ready for that I'm ready and waiting for the coming of the Lord now there there is your name on The Book of Life for the Book of Life is the word of God see The Book of Life is the word of God the and God is the only thing that is life so then you see your name is somewhere represented in that Bible it was represented in the Bible before the Bible became the word of God what he's saying there is before the Bible that was in God's mind and heart became the written word before the written word existed before King James version was written it was still the word it was always the word but that word was in the mind of God but before God allowed it to be loosed enough for them to be able to write it your name was already there we don't have to sing like a Charles Wesley is my name I already Sankey by the way is my name written there in the page white and fair in the book of thy kingdom is my name written there no we don't have to sing that amen praise the Lord like our brother saying here today he never fails me yet now it's wonderful but that was for a past age now we recognize that now we sing Jesus never fails Jesus never fails amen he never fails never ever fails so when we say it never fails me yet I'm not expecting him to ever fail me right not now nor in the future nor any other time praise the name of the Lord glory to God so it's the same thing many people are still believing wondering if their name is on the page it doesn't go like that we must come to a place where we are certain of God we are certain of God hallelujah amen that our names are in there praying the Lord now being in the message doesn't mean you are one of the Joseph being in the message let me repeat it because this is not only going here where you are sitting in this congregation there are many others hearing this and seeing this online who have believed all their lives all they have to do is get in the message just believe a prophet just believe the word and they are in and that's how they believe it but being in the message doesn't mean that you are one of the chosen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen many are called indeed but few are chosen now you must you've got to realize uh be talking go back to the seals talking about the Book of Revelation uh one through three uh there and in I believe it's chapter two you'll see the Antichrist Spirit you'll see the Antichrist spirit in there uh uh and it's riding on a white horse is that right in the Book of Revelation even if I mistook the chapter there forgive me for that but we find out the Antichrist spirit is supposed to ride and I believe he's writing right now he's writing right now and he's writing on a white horse which is a symbol of religion he'll use your faith he'll misplace your faith and he'll ride on that but really he has no real power amen but thank God we we can recognize him now because the seals are open and it reveals not only Christ but it reveals to us the Antichrist reveals to us the the king and it reveals to us the enemy that comes against us that we might know him and how to be able to deal with him for the glory of God hallelujah amen so uh I said that so you can understand a person can be religious and yet be Antichrist for the Antichrist was religious don't you know the devil is the most religious person in the world the devil is the most religious person you can think about I I quoted the scripture first John where he says even the devil believes and he believes it so much that he trembles he believes in God he believes there will be a judgment he believes they're going to be a Rapture he believes all those things and it trembles at it and you have foolish people saying there is no God and other ones want nothing to do with God nothing to do with the word because there's nothing we can see feel touch uh I'll wait there they don't realize that you are a spirit and therefore that spirit inside you worships a god also that you cannot see uh you know and and that's why the prophet said the one whom you you felt in your heart all these years and you believed one day will become personalized appear right before you for the glory of God Amen there's going to be a Rapture One Sweet Day well we'll be caught up in the presence of almighty God and we'll see him face to face and as the song says tell the story saved by grace glory be to God Amen yes sir glory to God hallelujah Seven Seals page four seven to three amen brother Brandon was asked this question brother Branham is it true that every Jew born since Christ will be saved and who are the 144 000. are they the predestinated ones to be sealed with the Holy Ghost and what is their mission amen oh my he says there's three questions in in one there but no no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life amen you believe that praise the name of the Lord glory to God Amen yes sir praise God you know why I'm looking I'm looking for the quotes put up there but the young young all of the young men are not here today so we give God praise amen hallelujah now we find that God wants you to recognize if your name is in the LA in the Lamb's Book of Life The Book of Life of course we know the Bible amen the word of God if your name is in there but you see the book of life has sections this I'm not teaching on that but now but there are sections and one of the Obscure sections is the Lamb's Book of Life right you can read the Bible all you want study it all your life and receive nothing but natural life from it other than but the Lamb's Book of Life which comes by Revelation that only comes the Holy Ghost can invite you in there only the Holy Spirit can open up the word and reveal to you what he wants amen praise God hallelujah many are called let me say it another way but few have representation many are called but few are not represent are represented in the word there are only a few a selected predestinated by the grace of God these are to be called also but praise God forevermore there's only a few that have their names represented in the book praise the name of the Lord elected to braidhood elected to the bright class of saints many Saints but there is a bright class of saints amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah yes sir Lord praise God let's let's continue on this uh the seventh seal book here and check what the prophet of God had to say no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you are Gentile no matter who they are you see he even said oh under the first second pull he says oh all babies go to heaven those little angels He says no but now the seals are open nobody gets in there except those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world nobody doesn't matter because even before they're born he knows who they are and where where they're going to he doesn't have to wait for them to be born or to grow up and live and then look at their life and decide whether they are going in or not he knows before you even got here he told Jeremiah before you were even placed in your mother's womb I saw you I knew you before you got here God knows every one of us before we got here on this Earth praise the Lord you come here and he is now going to identify you of who you really are are you a son are you a servant or are you an unbeliever God is able to know that amen doesn't matter what religious uh Garb what what disguise we put on we can act Pious and spiritual and Christian and read our Bible all day and do all the fasting we want that's all good that's wonderful but underneath all of that God's spirit sees right to the soul he sees right to your entire being he recognizes you who you are amen the True Believer is not a person of time we come from eternity and we are going back to Eternity we come from God and we go back to God we come from his presence praising him singing and glorifying him and we're going back there with the presence of the Living God to glorify and praise His holy name amen yes sir just is so important to know that amen hallelujah praise God now we know friends the bride was really an average age when he said the bride is not only in this last Church age there is a bride but every age had a portion or part of the Bride because the entire pyramid as you see behind me is a symbol of the entire life of Jesus Christ it's a symbol of all the church ages it's a symbol of the Saints while they are in the time dispensation of the Son of God in time period but once it breaks past broadly kindness and it goes up higher into a higher level you've gone into the Eighth Day you have left the ages as the prophet said well in the Statue of a perfect man he says now the the seven churches are now over and now I'm looking to to see that man that woman amen that will be there after these Church ages praise God they are the ones they're going to step into the day and walk into it praise the Lord back there even Believers of this message were talking about eight day but now the prophet master plan he says when these edges are over praise God he won't even be here but those Saints are going to go right into that that day and they're going to walk in it praise the Lord a new day is here upon us brother sister I said a new day is here this is not the Moses generation this is the Joshua generation praise the Lord we're crossing the river you can only Cross by the Holy Spirit opening up the way that's the only way that you can cross the river and meet the challenge of the city of AI praise the Lord I know that AI is challenging us now in the other computer Age and and we're going to meet that challenge too by the grace of God because they come with human intelligence machine intelligence we are coming with Divine intelligence the body has come right up from the feet right up right up through the body right up to the ellipse of the speaking age of the Pentecostal age which I was a part of but then I realized this our God is marching on God is God is not a standstill God he is a god that is marching on by the grace of God and so the revelation of the word has marched on and progressed where we are in another stage now and you are not in it you are not part of it you may be in a message but you are not part of it until by Revelation the holy spirit opens your eyes and you experience a spiritual Epiphany where the spirit of God lights up the word praise God lights up the entire word praise God forevermore amen yes sir Hallelujah now I tell you friends all those that were in The Bride in those other ages not that their names were actually written down inside the Bible that you can read their name Peter Paul James Susan whatever their names weren't written like that well Prophet said it in the same seven seal book um you know I can continue to quote here but listen what he says he says here it's not like he's going to call your name Susan or James or Sarah or whatever he says but the while the mystery that your name is under is being revealed amen while that mystery is being revealed your name is being called and you see when that mystery of the word begins to be revealed like that and your name is being called then what happens the Deep crawls to the Deep praise God the Deep calls out to the Deep the word that is in you responds to the word that's being revealed praise God my goodness I'm I'm coming off of my message here but I'm talking about that Chinese uh laundry tag now amen torn in pieces Hallelujah Jesus torn a Calvary Park went up to Glory parked down here amen and now when that part comes back down Hallelujah and it comes it's got to fit together perfectly nobody can take a man-made means of carrying another piece of paper and trying to fit it it won't work it's got to be the original and that's why God says no I know what I sent down here and so when the Holy Spirit comes down amen when the mother Eagle passes over the yard she knows her daughter he she knows her son she knows her children she can identify you and you're called out by the scream of the word of God something in your heart leaps because you recognize your father is calling your home come home come home it's supper time all the ages have ended the supper is on the seven course meal of the holy spirit being revealed to us the great chef himself sharing it out glory to God Amen nobody else can bring it like that brother sister but him alone praise God Amen I'm just asking him to use my voice and use me to speak to bring this word to you because no man can interpret the word the Holy Spirit The Living Christ amen is the only one that can release the word of God to you amen yes sir God is his whole interpreter he will make a plan amen yes sir praise God hallelujah well brother Simon you said our names is nothing ever Paul's name is in there Peter's name is in there I think I read John's numbers in there I I read different why is my name not in there how come I say it again because they in the first church age their names are allowed to be in there publicly you can see them because they were ministering the word and he would recognize them there are many others were in that age their name's not there but it's because their name is hid under that mystery for that particular age amen and so the only way that you could be identified God has to identify you because you are a part of the World by the word the word identifying the word the Deep call into the deep the same Holy Spirit coming and matching your spirit because the actual fact the True Believer of why on the death Pentecost there come a great Pillar of Fire because those tongues of fire are pieces off of the great Pillar of Fire that's why the Bible says he is the fullness of the godhead bodily all of that put back together comes back to the fullness of the pillar of fire and he is all of that amen we are in him and he's in US Hallelujah and it's all together it's one thing for his glory amen glory to God hallelujah amen so God identifies Us by his scripture the scripture being fulfilled and it identifies us that we are part of that Bible amen because we are fulfilling what we are fulfilling the rest of Malachi 4 5. amen the children are feeding and feasting on a word that the fathers used to have that's been restored and we identifying Who We Are praise the lord lord of God forgive me if I get too excited I can't jump high like that old man that was a prophet talked about jumped up around the eye the rainbow click his heel drop back down and preach a little bit more but just let me preach a little more here today by the grace of God is that okay praise God Amen yes sir hallelujah amen yes sir so so when the word is breached and the The Mystery of the word is preach it sounds like a mystery but to the True Believer they are able to catch a revelation out of what appears to be a mystery they are able to catch an understanding out of that praise God Amen see God already sought all this mind and now when he sees his unfolding upon the Earth he's recognizing oh that's what I saw uh back here now watch look at look at it here it's doing exactly what I I thought it would do as she's acting exactly the way I thought she would act she's he is living the way that I believed he would live look I mean he came on the earth she came on the earth maybe they looked like a Jacob like a trickster they look like a renegade they look like this maybe they didn't have such a good time in life that's the way they look and they seem to their fellow Mortals but you know I saw that Jacob later on would be uh converted and believe me and walk in the line of my word and live for me amen and love me with all his heart hallelujah amen praise God I was talking to a brother this is I come off a little bit here um but I was talking to a brother last night and he says brother Simon did you know that Jacob was Chinese he says Jacob was Chinese very important because he was a limping see he was really limping so we recognized him [Laughter] praise God hallelujah well praise the Lord now that just is a little bit pressure off of us here we can go back to the word worthy praise the name of the Lord I told him I said brother I never heard that before I thought he was Jamaican but now you're telling me he's Chinese I know the Bible says that God Abraham said prepare a kid and bring it and go you know Jamaicans love goat meats and so God at the goat meat and he enjoyed it he had a wonderful time so I said I don't know what is Jamaican or Chinese but I know he's God and he said God for everybody and we give God the praise this was a Chinese brother anyway so he was trying to tell me that God is Chinese he said God is everything for everybody amen he knows that but I praise the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord the same yesterday today and forever so God already saw you believing the mystery of his word and in there when you look into the world and the word opens up you see that your name and your life really is not just in the Book of Life natural but spiritual your life is eternal your life is eternal because you are a part of him God Elohim now being revealed inhuman flesh that is why you have the desire to lift away according to the word that you want to live your thirst is to live this way other people can't understand why you want to live that way you could go out in the World and Achieve this you can do that live whatever you want but somehow you go so you know when I was at school I tell this again the other boys could in my day it wasn't nice books for you to write on we had a slate something called a slate uh right and you had to write on that slate other boys can break that slate and then in the school fights and cut the other kids fighting or chop them or split their skull or something uh doesn't matter how angry I was with anybody else I just couldn't do that something in me would just stop me I can't I can't take a broken bottle and cut some body and no you see he was always there all the time he was with you all the time the Devils maybe try to kill some of you from the day you're born the devil tried to bring you into some accident to get rid of you because God wants to use you as a vessel to express himself he wants to stop that and try to give me maybe your mother even had trouble with giving birth and and you wonder why but it's because you are one of his own one of his Chosen Few called you out that he might reveal himself through you and make himself known to a sin cursed World walking in darkness without the bright shining light of the Holy Spirit of the Living God amen amen yes sir hallelujah amen praise God I thank God that that this book amen this book that is part of the Bible but yet this Lamb's Book of Life I'm talking about is outside of the Bible it's written in that Bible yet it's it's the word Unwritten because it's the word that's living it's the word men flesh again it's the word manifesting itself as a son of man now being revealed in this hour an age that we are living in amen praise the Lord of God hallelujah if you don't understand all I'm saying pray and ask God to give wisdom and understanding amen hallelujah yes sir by revelation we see it by believing the word of God for this hour praise God the prophet said the book holds the mystery and the book is unfolding it now Hallelujah you can use the word revealing it unfolding it now it's now being unfolded now uh Naturally Speaking is like this let me say it this way it's like before the opening of the seventh seal no man could have a clear understanding of it Dr Ironside Dr this doctor that praise God and some of those names A lot of them Bollinger many many others they know all about it they wrote about the volumes and volumes of it praise God and I have some of the volumes on my shelf back there where they're just sitting there uh just for reference but the fact is no man could understand or break into those seals for the lamb himself had to take the book yes brother Branham didn't break those seals the lamb took the book broke the seals and then came down and revealed to him what was in there and he was just a voice praise God forevermore just a voice to make known to the world the word that it might flow through him that's what it was praise the Lord amen now the book is unfolding it now not each one's name but what is the mystery of the book while it is calling the names you see the names that are under a certain Revelation a certain understanding of the mystery of the word you know you know in Christianity I'm slowing up here because I I start getting so quick and that I move out there but watch um we find that some preachers and persons individual believers they just have a hunkering to hear about healing one said love to hear about the baptism Holy Ghost another set loves to hear about the love of God another set once they hear about faith some once they hear just about to Rapture all the time you see that's what uh goes on out there so God knows which mystery your name is represented under in the word and when it is time for you to be called or your name to be called it doesn't say James but it makes a preacher or a minister ordained Anointed with the word to begin to preach on that same subject on that same topic and certain things that he will be saying is things that you already had in you and was wondering about thinking about her whatever the Holy Spirit who is the discerner of the hearts and the thoughts of the minds amen he will take his word and apply that token right where it is needed amen and those personal persons who are under that seal and unfold the name that their name is in there but the grace of almighty God hallelujah blessed be his name I'm so glad I've caught of you I've got a glimpse that my name is on that book and not not I'm not gonna back up I'm not going to bend I'm not going to burn I'm not gonna move aside but I'm pressing on the upward way you hide some gaining every day amen oh blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah amen praise God brother Simon you're old now you should settle down you should start to really lecture about butterflies and the burial of pets and that sort of decent kind of thing well I'm not used to that you know that was one thing all all the ministerial training I just you know that's in the background put that away and all that sort of stuff back to the word amen praise the Lord I never seen a man sitting on a hot stove and he just sits there and he's taking all his flesh is all being burnt up and and he sits on the stove like no he's not going to sit there he's going to jump off that stove amen praise God well I'm telling you when the word god gets in your soul and you get on fire with the Holy Ghost age don't matter the Holy Ghost will lift you up the Holy Ghost will use you for his glory praise God the spirit of the Living God quickens the individual regardless of who they are amen praise God hallelujah but when they come to themselves and they come back normal and they get cold then they feel the aches coming back that's just to let you know like the high priest God says tire little scarlet cord on their feet so that when they come into the holy of holies and the little bells you'll know if they're alive don't put any floor in on the temple so that they walk in on the dust and and when they come back out and they've been in the glory of the presence of the fire they can't think that they've been in heaven they can still see the dust is on your on your feet you're still living down here you still have dust in your feet so long after we leave this building and we shout all the Praises of God glory to God you still got to go out and pay your rent you still have to pay your mortgage you still got to face the everyday things of life amen don't get so spiritual minded as the old Pentecostals you say that you become no earthly good you see you you got to be uh like I've always said be deeply spiritual but be intensely practical you've got to have a balance with whatever you do for the glory of God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen yes sir but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names now I want to amplify this a little nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world whether Jew or Gentile that's that's all the book holds the mystery amen and the book is only unfolding it now praise the name of the Lord hallelujah but what the mystery of the book is what is the Revelation what the mystery of the book is what's the revelation of that book while it is calling those names amen hallelujah praise God and and I believe that even while I'm preaching the mystery is unfolding right now you believe that I believe it's on word is unfolding right now and and I believe that the holy spirit is calling to every one of us for us to recognize ourselves that we are a part of the word of God Amen Hallelujah and the spirit of God of course is calling your name by I repeat by a mystery and my repetition is deliberate so that we might remember that we might understand what God is doing in this hour and in this time praise the Lord now to continue the quote the book doesn't say now leave ale is to be saved in the time of this church age are that arm and Neville or whoever it is no it doesn't say it that way it doesn't say it like that see it just shows and unfolds that mystery or revealed like I said to you it shows the mystery and it reveals the mystery see of what that is and we now of ourselves see by faith we see and believe that see that is what makes you know whether your name is under that book because you are allowed to see it what's wrong with that everybody can see no when they were there and he was telling these things and the disciple says Master how should we understand what you are saying oh they're hearing the same thing we are hearing but they don't understand we see what you're saying they don't see he says blessed are your eyes that you are able to see that's not your ears that you are able to hear and understand what I'm trying to I'm saying to you amen and I say to you now blessed are your eyes blessed are your heirs blessed are they that hear the words of this book hallelujah amen yes sir well they're the ones that enter in to eternal life by the grace of God Amen yes sir o praise God God reveals the word to you glory to God by unfolding or making the mystery of his word clear to you praise God Hallelujah the same question that Jesus asked Peter is being asked today Hallelujah who do you say yes not who do you say I am but who you do do you say when I come in flesh again in a form of a bride or in bright form because remember uh both husband and wife Adam and Eve they were really one is that right and um we know that this is the hour when he the headship Jesus Christ has come down to earth in flesh is that right and he has made himself known as the word not a word but the word now she's of the same material that he is she is a part of that word of him Christ is the mystery of God now being revealed the word now being made known making itself clear by Revelation through the great teacher comforter the Holy Spirit making the world clear to us so we find out now the headship has been made known revealed and we all believe Jesus Christ is God is not a god he's not just the Mighty God a lord he is the Almighty first and the last beginning on the end Alpha and Omega they start from on high wonderful counselor amen this the Mighty God Everlasting father amen one God his name is Jesus Christ amen we believe that that's the word do you believe it hallelujah praise the Lord and we certainly believe that and we put our faith in him and he asked who do in other words when you look what do you see who who do you say I am do you say I'm Jesus back there or do you recognize the son of man here today who do you say the son of man is now now revealing himself in the form of the rest of his body which is his wife praise the Lord I think I'm going slow enough for you to follow what I'm saying which is his wife and he's now fulfilling the scripture where he's saying the son of man is to be revealed again in other words when he came the first that was the son of man being revealed but he says yes but but he's coming again so they have always looked and think it's just him 1900 2000 years ago is going to come back now and make himself known now and yes he is but not in the form he was back there God and morphe God brought himself now in the form of his own bride a many-membered body Hallelujah I said now he's in the form of a many membered body and he's expressing himself through a many-membered body and because of this the people don't realize scriptures are now being fulfilled right in this hour and in this day that we're living in just before the uh I think it's around 440 something scriptures were fulfilled when Jesus went to Gallery there and now we understand the Rapture is about to take place hundreds of scriptures are being fulfilled in this hour and the people fail to recognize the word of God being made known they failed to recognize the word being made known in the hour praise God blessing my friends God is up to something big do you believe it and I believe I'm a part of it amen do you believe that that you're a part of this I believe I'm a part of it no matter what anybody says I'm a one of the few praise the Lord I believe that praise the Lord hallelujah praise God listen I haven't preached my whole lifetime just thinking of gathering people and building up a big church if that was was the case I would have had thousands I've talked to two and I've talked to 40 000 at one time what difference and built up churches not one church but many churches and build them up sometimes 504 and then afterwards God will come and says no I want to use this as a distribution breaks it down 200 here 100 gone here 50 gone there and the churches come up you know I came to Ontario here there was no church there was not a message Church anywhere and God by his grace uh raised up many churches praise the Lord by his grace remember I was young then but I didn't fully understand later on he may get known to me I said my what am I doing that these brothers will just leave and go on one with a hundred one with 105th but it was God Distributing himself and I young you know you're on fire you don't understand then Lord revealed said no sit still here praise the Lord just just just do his will praise God so now I can give God praise and glory that there are churches around the world and wake up to the fact I'm not saying for that for you to look at me because what he done is him by his grace because sometimes you say something you don't realize what you're saying and it catches and somebody's Soul they praise the name of the Lord you'll see an example brother can't read dicks here he just found one of my old messages hidden in one of the churches back there and and picked it up and started looking to it while he was just a young man and mine set the soul on fire and set him on fire and he's never cooled on up since then amen praise the Lord he goes to Montreal these preaches the word there and he saw on fire it catches the heart of brother Miguel and brother Miguel gets on fire and he's on fire with the Holy Spirit praise the Lord hallelujah and that's the whole way of the fire of the Holy Spirit that's how it burns that's how it goes on praise the name of the Lord It's not anybody coming up and say well I'm not going to believe anything you preaching until brother Joe comes I'm not talking about Brother Joseph Coleman our brother Joseph Branham but I'm just telling you some people are like that I'm not going to believe you until I hurt brother Vale or brother this or whether that they got to have a a big name recognition and a profile and lots of money back of them or they got to have influence of some nature and the prophet talks about all that he says the people move away off the world because of celebrities coming up Giants in the message caught up with all these things right last week I told you how Monkey loves shiny things right or Ravens they love all kinds of Chinese things like that but the true sons of God God hides in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same for his glory and for his honor praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen glory to God I can't say everything I want to say here today but I'm going to give you as much as I can for his glory what what time is that I'm seeing there okay with you or you prefer to go home for your turkey amen uh praise the name of the Lord I lost the brothers to prepare some chicken soup at the back there if you like chicken soup then they can buy some from portinos and serve it in the back but right there we're looking for red hot meat fresh caught kill for the glory of God Hallelujah you know why my thoughts went that way is um I saw on the internet they showed a short clip of an eagle in Florida and they show him coming up and there he had a shark and the shark was bigger than his size they couldn't believe that that animal had so much that bird had so much power that even though that that shark was doing like this and like that the eagle had a hold of him and when I got a hold of the word you can't take it out of my hand you can't take it away from the True Believer when he got a hold of the word amen praise God and not only that he just rose up with that eagle they thought he might have dropped it or might he have to flop them no he flew away to the mountains with that eagle where we going to feed his young or something or the other but I said wow look at the glory of God look at the power of God displayed in the ego praise the Lord thank God we can be God's egos amen and we can feed on the freshness of the word and live by it for his glory amen who do you say I the son of man is hallelujah who do you say the word is do you say it's just a message do you say it's just a message that's walking around everywhere like that or do you see who is back of the Veil of the message who is back of that clothes and that face that they used to call Jesus Christ when he tells them who is living back here the father that dwelleth in me he do it works I am that I am praise the Lord Jesus it was I am back there praise the name of the Lord hallelujah who do you say he is now because he's in this bright form praise the Lord glory to God I got a lot of preaching that I can do because you're going to say well me I got so many mistakes in my life I did this I did that I you know I feel guilty with this I feel guilty with that it's got nothing to do with him on the inside because the eagle always cleansed not the eagle but the dove clearances itself from the inside to the outside not from coming outside and then pouring water on themselves but the prophets the the difference with the with the Dove and the pigeons they cleanse themselves from the inside to the outside Hallelujah so your cleansing is coming as the scripture Paul says it work out words your salvation with fear and trembling it's not the works you're doing outside trying to make yourself clean and and washing your clothes and and doing this or that or Naturally Speaking thinking it's your Works gonna take you in being a good Christian believer dressing right we're in the right lengths we're in the the Christian uh or message um uniform on is going to take you in no no no no no no no that's not what to take you in it's him and you is going to be cleansing you all the time as you walk he'll cleanse you things are going to start dropping off they may not drop off the first day and when people walk in here with cigarette habits dope addicts or a drug addicts and everything else and it dropped off bang one day gone hallelujah praise God other ones takes a period of time and God but God works it out for his glory praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen amen yes sir God is good I said God is good praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Amen you are not the what Moses said but you are the Christ what Peter is they're telling him you are the word for this hour you are the anointed word for this day for this hour we understand it's not what Moses said and this one said and Doctor inside and doctor so and so that's good wonderful but who do you say I am god making himself known in this day and this hour hallelujah amen yes sir it's the not the Bible going to reveal this to you what I'm preaching about right he says not not even me but the father that dwelt in me he's the one that's going to make it known to you the Father the Holy Spirit the Great Mighty one is going to make himself known to you by the opening of the word praise God hallelujah okay I'm going to start trying to wind this up praise the Lord if you want to hear more that's fine but I'm going to start winding it up I know some of you will want to stay here and if I preach till midnight but um I think it's time I start winding it up glory to God hallelujah now I want you to understand here that this parable that I just uh read and talked about is really talking about the revelation of the Gathering of the guests this is not the Gathering of the Bride but guests for the wedding feast see so many are called but few are chosen many call to come to the supper called to be in other grades in the book of life whether they're going to be servants guards or or whatever they'll be there but they're not going to be sitting on the throne with him as the bride you see praise the name of the Lord so many guests are called but only a few are chosen to be on the bride now praise the Lord now if that was the actual wedding um there we understand that that would and they were thinking just is going to be in heaven that's going to happen uh but we know that that's going on here now on the earth do you believe that improving the world proving his word the old book proving his word page 54. brother Brandon brother Branham tells us clearly if you read it there he'll tell you that the wedding doesn't take place up there it takes place down here and quickly if I might say it that's what he meant when he preached all those messages about the invisible Union of of your soul with the bride of with Christ the word amen coming together that's the invisible Union that's the marriage taking place right there and then no secrets are held back from you now because now the bridegroom starts to make his word known to you because he he recognized you as his bride so he started to tell you all his Secrets he starts whispering in your ears you go in prayer and all of a sudden all of a sudden you get you might think just a thought or you just get a little whisper or God makes you know something the bridegroom is now talking to you he's whispering in your ears making themselves known by the opening of his word amen hallelujah praise God so we're sitting here getting married but God helped those guests they're wonderful but they're only there to watch on as we get married as we get married to the world they're looking on at the ceremony and and wondering how it must feel to be the bride Hallelujah and that's what's the problem a lot of people in this message are bridesmaid they're not they're not they're not the bride forgive me but that's that's how the Holy Spirit uses me see they're bridesmaid they're not not the actual bride and they just look on and serve their part and be a part of what's going on now in this day and in this hour praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so what I'm saying here is the guests are not the bride is that Claire the guests are invited but they are not the bride the bride was elected and chosen even before the wedding even called call for a wedding the call for the wedding only come after the break room already has a bride he already has a bride he might not identify her yet to you who she is she might even be amongst you right he says feed the flock of God that is amongst you amen by faith in the word of the Living God Amen say see so yeah maybe I did not identify him I must speak in tongues but he almost he didn't identify her to you praise God but God has a whole group that is brought in to what is called the message amen and they were called but were not chosen they were called but failed to recognize like the Jews the Jews were called they were called but what is their mistake they failed to recognize who was their Messiah amen that's why they have to wait for the Gentile ages to be over dispensation to be over you know and it breaks right back the Sun goes back to the East and they come back to a place where he will come again and make himself known to them like Joseph made himself known his brothers he will come back to the Jews and make himself known to them so that they will be able to recognize them and they don't have to believe what I see any man says because he himself is coming and before he comes he said Elijah Moses the chief Prophet the chief law giver and they'll break the word of God to them Prophet said in the Feast of the trumpets what they are going to receive is exactly what you are receiving now they are going to give them that's their feast that they're going to be receiving amen we are in the Feast of the atonement they're going to have that Feast the word breaking to them and recognize who he is by the great Holy Spirit of the Living God amen glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir this is not going to be in heaven but it's happening right here or not I'm going to stop right now glory to God hallelujah you continue to pray for me if God wills and he wants me to continue part of this next week if not then he gives me something else and says no I want to go this way then I listen to him not my feelings or yours and I go in the direction he wants me to go but for now God bless you ask yourself and ask let God ask you speak to you while the musicians are coming are you amongst the call or the chosen those who need to see what I'm saying will see those who need to recognize will recognize amen because unto you it's given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the Living God hallelujah blessed be his name I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them Hallelujah one of them I'm one of them praise the Lord I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them [Music] I'm so glad that I can say I'm
