[2:16] Let's give God an applause.
[2:18] [music]
[2:20] Happy to be in the house of the living
[2:22] God today. Our psalms will be taken from
[2:25] Psalms 34.
[2:27] I will bless the Lord at all times.
[2:32] His praise shall continually be in my
[2:34] mouth.
[2:36] My soul shall make her boast in the
[2:39] Lord. The humble shall hear thereof and
[2:43] [music] be glad.
[2:45] Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let
[2:48] [music] us exalt his name together.
[2:52] I saw the Lord and he heard me and he
[2:55] delivered me from all my fears.
[2:59] They looked unto him and were lightened
[3:02] and their faces were not ashamed.
[3:05] This poor man cried and the Lord heard
[3:08] him and save him out of all his
[3:12] troubles.
[3:14] The angel of the Lord encamp [music]
[3:18] round about them that fear him and
[3:21] delivered them. Oh, taste and see that
[3:24] the Lord is good. Blessed is the man
[3:28] that trusted in him. Fear the Lord, ye,
[3:32] says, for there is no one to them that
[3:35] fear him. The young lions lack
[3:39] and uh and suffer
[3:44] suffer hunger. But they that seek the
[3:46] Lord shall not want any good thing. Come
[3:50] ye children hearkening unto me. I will
[3:53] teach you the fear of the Lord. What man
[3:56] is he that desires life and love many
[3:59] days [music] that he may see God?
[4:03] Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips
[4:06] [music] from speaking God.
[4:10] Depart from evil and do good. Seek peace
[4:14] and persecute it. The eyes of the Lord
[4:17] are upon the righteous and his airs are
[4:20] open unto their cry. The face of the
[4:24] Lord is against them that do evil to cut
[4:27] off [music] the remembrance of them from
[4:29] the earth.
[4:31] The righteous cry in the Lord [music]
[4:33] heard and delivered them out of all
[4:36] their trouble. The Lord is nigh unto
[4:39] them that are of a broken heart and safe
[4:42] such as of a contrite spirit.
[4:46] Many are the afflations [music] of the
[4:48] righteous, but the Lord deliver him out
[4:52] of all.
[4:54] He keepeth all of his bones, not one of
[4:57] them is broken. Evil shall slay the
[5:01] wicked, and they that hate the righteous
[5:04] shall be [music] desolate. Let's read
[5:05] the last one together. The Lord redeemth
[5:08] the soul of his servants, and none of
[5:10] them that trust in him shall be
[5:14] desolate. Amen and amen. Praise God.

[12:39] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, then act like it.
[12:42] that the King of Kings and the Lord of
[12:43] Lords, the most high [music] God, the

[13:00] Lord.
[13:02] You are great indeed. Father, you are
[13:04] mighty [music] and true, and you're
[13:06] great in battle.
[13:08] Oh, the lies that would be told in the
[13:13] years of your people, [music] they must
[13:15] depart because you indeed are great in
[13:18] battle. You have [music] never lost a
[13:21] battle. Lord, you are the great
[13:24] physician this morning who cannot be
[13:27] denied. Lord, you are the one who has
[13:30] taken us from the uh from the low points
[13:34] and taken us and placed us on higher
[13:36] ground. Lord, you are the one who has
[13:38] opened our eyes. You are the one that
[13:41] has made a way that where there was
[13:43] [music] no way. Father, you are the one
[13:46] who has sent your word in this last day.
[13:48] Father, if it wasn't for that, Lord,
[13:50] where would we be this morning, Lord?
[13:52] But that's why we sing, you are great,
[13:55] God. We're not just singing a song or
[13:57] just mouthing [music] words, Father.

[14:17] your people, Father. You are so
[14:19] wonderful this morning, Lord, that we
[14:21] don't have words to describe the mighty
[14:24] God in our [music] midst this morning,
[14:26] Lord. The word unveiled, oh God, and the
[14:30] things that you're doing, Lord. Oh, God.
[14:33] Raise a standard this morning, Father.
[14:35] If there be anybody, Father, that needs
[14:37] a touch from the mighty hand of God, may
[14:40] the Holy Spirit just sweep over their
[14:43] soul and cause a change to take place.
[14:46] Oh Lord Jesus,

[14:52] May the word just penetrate our the

[14:57] penetrate the the shells and the all the
[15:00] things that Satan, your your enemy, has
[15:03] tried to put up. May the word just
[15:05] penetrate, break through, and [music]
[15:07] and may it find a resting place in our
[15:10] souls this morning, Father. And we will
[15:12] give you all the glory, Father. We will
[15:15] give you all the honor. We'll give you
[15:17] all the praise because we know, Lord,
[15:19] that without you, we are absolutely

[15:52] I [snorts] heard this yesterday. [music]
[15:54] Brother Brandham speaking. He says,
[15:56] "This church never takes a tribulation
[15:59] period." [music] You believe that?
[16:03] You cannot put nowhere the church in
[16:05] tribulation. And I'm going to say church
[16:08] with a capital C. All right? You can put
[16:10] the [music]
[16:12] you can put the church there, the
[16:13] nominal church, but not the bride.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; See, the bride has gone on. She has not
[16:20] one sin, not a thing against her.
[16:23] [music] The grace of God has covered
[16:25] over her. And the bleach has took away
[16:29] every sin so far away. [music] There's
[16:31] not even a remembrance of it. Not a
[16:34] thing of but purity [music]
[16:36] perfect in the presence of God. Is
[16:39] anybody identifying with that?
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a day of identifying with
[16:44] something you identify with that. How
[16:46] many can say that's me?
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Is a glorious church without
[16:56] spot wrinkle. [music]

[28:25] paper
[28:26] uh [music] the things that we wanted to
[28:28] burn. And there was a fire pit here and
[28:30] we all walked and burnt those pieces of
[28:32] paper. Um
[28:36] I made my list and at the top of my list
[28:42] was [music] unbelief.
[28:45] And since then,
[28:48] I'm beginning to realize that what took
[28:51] place in that service has ignited a
[28:55] series of occurrences
[28:57] that have started a transformation.
[29:01] And what is happening in my life right
[29:04] now is a result [music] of what happened
[29:06] in that service. And so fast forward in
[29:09] August, at the end of August, there was
[29:11] a youth meetings here. Um, and
[29:17] on Sunday, Brother Diggs preached a
[29:19] sermon called, "If not me, then who?"
[29:24] Now, I was diagnosed [music]
[29:26] with cancer on August the 12th.
[29:30] And when the doctor called me and told
[29:32] me that you have cancer,
[29:35] I laughed. [music]
[29:37] And the laugh was not due to disbelief
[29:40] or
[29:42] um
[29:44] uh denial.
[29:46] The laugh was because
[29:49] I had been dealing with the tumor for
[29:51] several years. And to me, it was dead.
[29:55] It was gone. It was not an issue. It was
[29:57] [music] like history. And so I laughed
[30:01] kind of to say, you know, it's kind of
[30:02] late to tell me that now. And I went
[30:05] into the washroom and I just
[30:07] hysterically burst out laughing. And a
[30:10] voice from within me, it wasn't audible.
[30:14] The voice said, "Who told you that?"
[30:18] And that was the sermon that Brother
[30:20] Miguel preached on the Saturday. [music]
[30:24] Now, 10 days later, on August 22nd, I
[30:27] was talking with my brother Ben. And we
[30:30] were talking about how
[30:32] we need to really put our faith [music]
[30:34] in action and and mean business with
[30:36] God. And I made a statement. I said, "If
[30:39] not me, then who?" And that's the title
[30:42] that Brother Digs preached on the Sunday
[30:46] at the end of August. Now during that
[30:48] service he had he talked about David and
[30:51] Goliath and he uh demonstrated [music]
[30:55] how David cut off Goliath's head and
[30:58] held. He had each one of us holding
[31:02] our hands up like this to testify that
[31:05] we have Goliath's hand. I was sitting
[31:08] around about the third row from the
[31:10] back. I had the tumor on my left breast.
[31:13] My hand was sore. It was difficult for
[31:15] me to raise my hand. But I raised it in
[31:18] faith and [music] I was testifying
[31:20] Goliath is slain. And in my heart
[31:26] I was praying. I said, "Lord, please let
[31:29] this hand of mine show up in that camera
[31:32] as a [music] testimony
[31:34] because I wanted that to be recorded."
[31:37] And sure enough, when I [music] went to
[31:41] check out that video, the camera zoomed
[31:45] back [music] and my hand is there in the
[31:47] video. And I held my hand up high longer
[31:51] than everybody else just to be sure that
[31:53] my hand would appear.
[31:55] And I was saying that this Goliath is
[32:00] slain and I'm going to come back with
[32:02] Goliath's head.
[32:04] So when I after the surgery, I talked to
[32:07] my surgeon
[32:09] and I I asked her for Goliath's head.
[32:13] She looked at me as [music] though I had
[32:14] three heads on
[32:17] and but I was very serious and [music]
[32:19] um
[32:22] you know this is
[32:24] uh it's a big deal
[32:28] and this situation is bigger than the
[32:32] physical aspect of me having the tumor
[32:34] and the cancer and uh I won't go into
[32:37] detail it will be recorded so all the
[32:40] details will be provided but just to hit
[32:42] the highlights [music] is uh I do have
[32:46] Goliath's head [music] and the rest of
[32:49] the Philistines are in trouble.
[32:53] [applause and cheering]
[32:59] &gt;&gt; So I just want to sing this song to give
[33:01] glory to God.
[33:13] What gift of grace
[33:17] is Jesus my redeemer? [music]
[33:22] There is no more [singing]
[33:26] for heaven now [music]
[33:28] to give.
[33:31] He is my joy,
[33:34] my rightousness
[33:36] [music] and freom,
[33:39] my steadfast [singing]
[33:41] [music] love,
[33:43] my deep and bounding peace. [music]
[33:48] To [singing] this I hold.
[33:51] My hope is only Jesus.
[33:55] [music and singing]
[33:57] All my life
[34:00] is wholly bound to him.

[34:10] I can sing. [singing] All is mine yet

[34:42] in weakness and rejoiceing. [music]
[34:47] Oh, in [singing] my need

[34:55] To [singing] this I hold.

[35:07] valley [singing] he [music] will lead.

[35:17] [music]
[35:18] have overcome
[35:21] yet not [singing] I but through Christ

[35:28] No fate I dread.
[35:32] I know I am [music] forgiven. [singing]
[35:37] My future sure
[35:40] the price [singing] it has been paid.
[35:45] For Jesus [music and singing] bled
[35:48] and he suffered for my pardon. [singing]
[35:53] [music] And he was raised
[35:56] to overthrow
[35:58] the grave.
[36:00] [music]
[36:01] To this [singing] I hold.
[36:04] My sin has [music] been defeated.
[36:10] Jesus now [music]
[36:13] and ever is my plea. [singing]
[36:18] Oh the chains are released.
[36:21] [music and singing]
[36:22] I can say I am free and not [music] I
[36:28] but through [singing] Christ
[36:30] in me.
[36:32] [music]
[36:33] To this I hold my hope is only Jesus.
[36:40] [singing]
[36:42] All the glory
[36:45] ever more to him. [music]
[36:49] For when this race
[36:52] is [music] complete, still my lips shall
[36:56] repeat. Yet not I, but through Christ
[37:02] in [music] me.

[37:16] that he will bring [singing] me home.
[37:21] And day by [music] day
[37:24] he is [singing] renewing
[37:27] me [music]
[37:29] until I stand
[37:32] before him on the throne. [singing]
[37:37] To this I hold. My hope is only [music]
[37:43] Jesus.
[37:46] All the gloryy

[40:45] [music]
[40:49] Oh, he of the broken pieces.
[40:56] You touched my [music] heart and made
[40:59] it.

[42:20] our hearts. Amen.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; He's the keeper of our soul.
[42:25] He's the deliverer in our midst. [music]
[42:28] Amen. Praise God. God bless you. Welcome
[42:31] everybody into the house of the Lord
[42:32] this morning. [music] God bless you
[42:34] musicians. Thank you so much. Praise
[42:37] God. We just want to welcome all of our
[42:39] guests and visitors this morning. God
[42:42] bless you, Sister Ruth, Brother Bernard.
[42:44] It's good to have you here this morning.
[42:46] We enjoyed your testimony. Praise God.
[42:49] Welcome everybody into the house of the
[42:52] Lord this morning. I trust that you're
[42:54] all uh here to uh be uh you know caught
[42:58] up into heavenly places where you can
[43:00] receive a portion of word today that you
[43:03] can you know this is this is where God
[43:05] um feeds us. Amen. This is the house of
[43:08] the Lord where he prepares a meal for us
[43:11] &gt;&gt; and uh we come here and we get
[43:13] strengthened by the word of God. We go
[43:15] back into the into the challenges that
[43:18] we must face because we're all going to
[43:20] face challenges until we leave here.
[43:22] We're going to face them. But by the
[43:24] grace of God, he gives us word so that
[43:27] we can overcome them.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, um, next
[43:32] weekend, um, we're having our general
[43:35] meeting, um, and it's for tithe paying
[43:38] members next Sunday, November the 9th.
[43:41] You know, um, you might wonder, tithe
[43:43] paying members? Um well you know tithe
[43:46] paying members are members of the church
[43:50] that belong to the church have
[43:52] identified as being a family member of
[43:55] the church have taken a position in the
[43:59] church and it's not a position like you
[44:01] have to have a position like a trustee
[44:03] or a deacon or or an usher or whatever
[44:07] you know a position is when you've
[44:11] identified that you are a part of the
[44:13] body of Christ, you recognize that
[44:17] you're a part of the father's business.
[44:20] Like Jesus said, I must be about the
[44:21] father's business. And this is this is
[44:24] what and who we are. We're about the
[44:27] father's business. Amen. Praise God. And
[44:30] in every business, there's there's
[44:32] workers, there's uh leaders, there's
[44:35] managers, there's uh cleaning
[44:38] committees, there's all these different
[44:40] aspects of a natural business. Well, we
[44:43] operate the spiritual house of the Lord.
[44:46] Amen. And this is the house that God has
[44:48] given us. And so, as a a true um
[44:54] faithfilled believer, you need to
[44:56] understand your your obligations as a
[45:00] son or a daughter of God. And that is
[45:03] that you've recognize you're part of
[45:06] God's business. You recognize that God
[45:09] is the provider.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the giver of your paychecks.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, when you identified yourself as
[45:18] a son or a daughter of God, you come
[45:20] under the economy of God.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a blessing to come under
[45:25] the economy of God.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it's beyond it's just
[45:30] it's beyond financial blessing. I'm not
[45:32] talking about financial bless. That's
[45:34] just one of the aspects of the blessings
[45:37] that come as a part of God's economy.
[45:41] But it's understanding that God is the
[45:43] one that he brings you into his
[45:45] business. He gives you and pays you the
[45:50] funds that you those paychecks you
[45:52] receive every two weeks. Listen, God can
[45:55] cut those paychecks off at any time
[45:58] &gt;&gt; and he can increase them at any time.
[46:02] You either believe God is God or you
[46:04] don't.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; And when God gives you a $100 and all he
[46:09] says is to give back to me a tithe, a
[46:12] tenth of that. And when you do that,
[46:16] you're identifying that yes, Lord, you
[46:18] are my supply. You are my provider. You
[46:21] are the one that that that that provides
[46:23] all of my needs. And that revelation on
[46:26] tithing is only one revelation that
[46:29] actually expresses through your entire
[46:31] walk with God.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; That's only a small aspect. But when we
[46:36] come to dealing with the business of
[46:37] God, we're dealing with God's building,
[46:42] God's expenses, God's renovations, God's
[46:46] mission work.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Dealing with God's mission work and
[46:50] supporting the work of God. If if we
[46:52] can't go, then we'll send somebody.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; We are an we are we are a an active
[46:58] missionary church. We're building. Next
[47:01] week, you're going to hear about the
[47:02] building programs and some of the
[47:04] different things that we are uh
[47:06] supporting, you know, um in different
[47:09] areas in different parts of the world
[47:11] for the work of God. Amen. Praise God. I
[47:14] don't know why, you know, I'm going into
[47:16] all of this, but but you need to
[47:17] understand that our meeting next week,
[47:21] we want those that are that are really a
[47:23] part of the body. And if you haven't
[47:26] been identifying as part of the body,
[47:28] then you can start right now, right?
[47:32] Amen. If maybe you've missed something,
[47:35] maybe you're you're you're you're
[47:37] deceived in some way or whatever. I
[47:39] don't know. But, you know, just let the
[47:41] Holy Spirit speak to your heart here and
[47:44] identify yourself and and and you know,
[47:46] take your stand. Either you're with or
[47:49] you're not and your life is going to
[47:52] express it one way or the other. Amen.
[47:55] Praise God. So, we certainly appreciate
[47:58] um you know that uh this ministry has
[48:01] always operated that way. You you're
[48:03] never going to hear us as the leadership
[48:06] pulling on money. Oh, you gotta give.
[48:09] you got, you know, you're not you're not
[48:10] guilty. We need this or we got this and
[48:12] you know, no, we just present to you
[48:15] what God has laid upon our hearts. And
[48:17] God has always provided more than
[48:19] enough.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; So, we don't rely on certain
[48:24] individuals. We rely on the Holy Spirit
[48:27] to move into into people's lives. And
[48:30] and those that are open to God's
[48:32] blessing, God just pours through.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; God just gives opportunity. God just
[48:37] blesses and opens the doors. This is
[48:39] this is the God we serve. This is this
[48:42] is how we are in a Listen, this is about
[48:45] probably a four to5 million property and
[48:48] we owe peanuts on it now.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And that's not something that we did.
[48:54] That's something that God did.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; There's no way we can look back and say,
[48:58] "Oh, we did this. Look at you know how
[49:01] many of you can do something like that?"
[49:02] It's not something that when you come
[49:05] into God's economy, you trust God, you
[49:08] stand behind the vision of the
[49:10] leadership and you and you catch that
[49:13] vision. You become a part of that
[49:15] vision. You start to see yourself in the
[49:17] walls. You start to see yourself in the
[49:19] instruments. You start to see yourself
[49:21] in the chairs. What is it? It's the body
[49:23] of Christ.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so I'm so glad.
[49:28] And this is the message of the hour.
[49:32] Amen. Let's go to the word of God.
[49:34] Praise God. We've been on this series of
[49:37] uh you know the purpose of God and we've
[49:39] been um you know talking about adoption,
[49:43] how we've been called unto adoption and
[49:45] God is you know bringing us into
[49:47] maturity and all these aspects of you
[49:50] know of what we just talked about here.
[49:52] It's all part of showing where your
[49:54] level of maturity is in the body of
[49:57] Christ. Where how are you walking with
[49:59] God? where where are you at? What like
[50:01] what what's your understanding of a of
[50:04] of a son or a daughter that's come to
[50:07] maturity and to stand and you know to to
[50:09] understand that God is you we've been
[50:11] looking at obtaining our inheritance.
[50:13] Amen. You go to the next slide. You
[50:16] know, we've been looking at obtaining
[50:18] our inheritance and today we want to
[50:20] continue. The last couple weeks we were
[50:22] looking at it and we just we're just
[50:24] letting the Holy Spirit, you know,
[50:25] unveil and open up things. As I study
[50:28] and as you pray and as you believe, then
[50:31] God just comes and meets our needs.
[50:33] Amen. This is the mystery of preaching.
[50:35] Amen. I I I'm not a deep preacher. I get
[50:39] scared every time I come up here. That's
[50:42] the honest to God's truth. God is my
[50:44] witness. Okay? Because I realize that
[50:48] this is the living God. This is the this
[50:50] is the the ministry of Jesus Christ. And
[50:53] the and the only thing that we can do is
[50:55] get out of the way and allow him to do
[50:57] his part and to reveal. I'll do my part.
[51:00] I'll study. I'll do I'll pray. You guys
[51:03] do your part. You need to pray for me.
[51:05] You need to pray for for for the
[51:06] ministry that the God that the Lord will
[51:08] just give us exactly what we need so
[51:11] that we can fulfill our part. We have a
[51:14] purpose. We have a part. Amen. Praise
[51:16] God. So um today we want to continue on.
[51:19] Let's go to our scripture. It's from 1
[51:21] Peter chapter 1:es 3-5.
[51:25] It says here and before we go there,
[51:27] let's just pray. Father, Lord, we we
[51:29] invite you to come this morning, Lord.
[51:31] I'm needy this morning. Father, I need
[51:34] your your your inspiration, your your
[51:36] anointing to come into the atmospheres
[51:39] to feed your people. Father, Lord, won't
[51:41] you come and just break the bread of
[51:44] life this morning and and do for us,
[51:46] Lord, more than what we could even
[51:48] possibly imagine. Lord, we want to leave
[51:50] here rejoicing. Father, this is this is
[51:54] uh our uh portion of the word here this
[51:57] morning. So, we receive it, we accept
[51:59] it, and we believe it in Jesus Christ's
[52:01] name. Amen. And amen. Praise God.
[52:04] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[52:05] Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
[52:08] his abundant mercy hath begotten us
[52:12] again unto a lively hope by the
[52:16] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[52:19] dead to an inheritance incorruptible.
[52:23] Amen. Praise God. That just jumps right
[52:27] out of the scripture. to an inheritance
[52:29] because we've been talking about, you
[52:31] know, coming into our inheritance. And
[52:34] here it kind of just, you know,
[52:36] identifies the inheritance a little
[52:38] more. And, you know, especially in this
[52:40] hour, amen, that it's an incorruptible
[52:42] inheritance. It's something that that's
[52:44] never going to fade away. So,
[52:46] incorruptible means it's not even of
[52:48] this world because anything that's of
[52:51] this world corrupts.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, this is wonderful.
[52:55] Undefiled. and that fadeth not away.
[53:00] So, it's undefiled. It means that it's
[53:02] it's completely sinless.
[53:05] Praise God. Amen. And it and it can
[53:08] never fade away. And where is it?
[53:10] Reserved in heaven
[53:13] for who?
[53:15] &gt;&gt; For you.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; So, you've got an inheritance. It's got
[53:19] your name written all over it. It's
[53:21] undefiled and it's reserved for you in
[53:25] heaven. Amen. And then look at look at
[53:28] verse five. Who? Not what.
[53:32] Who? So it's talking about a person.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; It's talking about you. It's talking
[53:38] about an individual. Amen. Are kept by
[53:42] the power of God through revelation.
[53:46] Faith unto salvation. But this is the
[53:49] beauty. Ready to be revealed in the last
[53:53] time. Amen. the Lord add his blessing to
[53:56] the word of God. You may be seated.
[53:58] What a wonderful scripture. Amen. You
[54:01] know, um it's just tremendous. There's
[54:04] so much that we're going to be drawing
[54:05] out of this um scripture here over the
[54:08] next couple of weeks because I believe
[54:10] that, you know, it'll be today and maybe
[54:12] next week that that that the whole, you
[54:14] know, um revelation and and the thought
[54:17] and what it is that that I saw, you
[54:20] know, as I was studying and as I was
[54:22] looking into these things that that, you
[54:24] know, the the the picture just becomes
[54:26] so real that this incorruptible
[54:29] inheritance, it, you know, it just
[54:31] speaks the word of the hour. It just
[54:33] speaks the revelation of the hour that
[54:36] we're in the season of the rapture.
[54:38] Amen. Because this corruption is going
[54:41] to put on incorruption.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; This mortality is going to put on
[54:46] immortality.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's all around the revelation of
[54:51] our inheritance and the word for this
[54:53] day and for this hour. Listen, when you
[54:55] got called to this message, I remember
[54:58] when I came, you know, and the Lord
[54:59] called me to this message and we started
[55:02] to and I started to hear about the
[55:03] rapture. The rapture. I said, "Wow, this
[55:07] is this is incredible. This is
[55:10] supernatural.
[55:12] This is where we're actually going to be
[55:14] translated out of this dimension."
[55:16] Because listen, you know, you know that
[55:18] when when you know when you you come to
[55:20] an understanding of God, you've got to
[55:22] know that God is supernatural.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; You know, when then you go back, you
[55:26] listen to the prophet, you hear the
[55:28] supernatural that took place around his
[55:30] life, the things that that that he did
[55:33] supernaturally, how people were dead,
[55:36] were raised back up again. Amen. That,
[55:39] you know, discernment in ways that only
[55:41] could be God.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of a sudden when you hear
[55:44] those things and then you know you hear
[55:46] of the rapture then you come to
[55:48] understand that the rapture is
[55:50] absolutely what this world needs
[55:54] &gt;&gt; especially in this hour because the
[55:56] world is going into total chaos. Amen.
[55:59] And so God has made a way for us to to
[56:04] uh be delivered from this dimension by
[56:07] way of a change from mortal to
[56:10] immortality. That's why Jesus said, "I
[56:13] go to prepare a place for you." Amen.
[56:17] That where I am, you may be also. He's
[56:20] talking about that dimension. And we've,
[56:22] you know, we've covered all of those
[56:23] things. But this this revelation just
[56:26] never stops unveiling itself. Amen. This
[56:29] incorruptible inheritance is what, you
[56:32] know, excites my soul. Amen. Here I was
[56:35] thinking, you know, I was going to
[56:36] inherit, you know, the blessings of God
[56:39] by him just blessing, you know, here on
[56:41] earth. He says, I'll bless you. I'll
[56:43] prosper you. I'll, you know, I'll give
[56:46] you houses in this world. Amen. So, so
[56:50] there are blessings that can come from
[56:52] serving God in this dimension. And it's
[56:55] wonderful to receive all of those
[56:56] blessings. But then he's talking about
[56:59] an inheritance that goes beyond this
[57:03] time dimension here, this mortality over
[57:06] here. Every day aches, pains, it's it's
[57:11] I look in the mirror and I, man, you're
[57:14] getting old.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; You know, you you you not getting any
[57:17] younger when you look in the mirror,
[57:19] okay? You get disappointed sometimes.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you young people enjoy
[57:24] your youth.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And praise God. Enjoy that that
[57:29] muscle that you know like man I used to
[57:31] go like this and it was like
[57:35] now I go like this
[57:40] and it's like man you know it's just
[57:44] it's just not there anymore. What is it?
[57:46] Because this this vessel is is in
[57:50] corruption.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; This earth is in corruption. Amen.
[57:56] There's nothing here that that that is
[57:59] eternal. The only thing that is eternal
[58:02] is what we feed on, the word of God.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what's translating us
[58:09] into our position of sons and daughters
[58:13] of God. Amen. Praise God. And so, you
[58:17] know, I want to look at this and it's
[58:20] going to kind of evolve in a way, but
[58:23] you know, our destination or the
[58:25] completion of this inheritance, this
[58:27] incorruptible inheritance for us, it's
[58:30] the it's the rapture. Amen. It's the
[58:33] body change. It's the revelation on our
[58:36] translation from this dimension to the
[58:39] next. Amen. That's what the culmination
[58:42] of the inheritance of the incorruptible
[58:45] inheritance is all about. Amen. Praise
[58:47] God. But here we are now. I want to read
[58:50] the um the next quote. Okay? Because you
[58:55] know we we we would need to know and
[58:56] understand why God chose us. What it is
[59:00] that God is accomplishing in this day
[59:02] and in this hour. And he goes here. He
[59:04] goes and he says, "Now, now what do you
[59:06] think the writer of this book?" Now,
[59:08] he's talking about the scripture that we
[59:10] just read. You know, the he's talking
[59:12] about Ephesians, right? the writer of
[59:14] this book that seen it and seen where it
[59:18] would be manifested in the last days,
[59:22] waiting and groaning for those sons of
[59:25] God to rise in the last days with the
[59:28] power of the Holy Ghost at the end of
[59:31] the age to reveal the secret things from
[59:35] the foundations of the world to bring it
[59:38] up.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And here now, brother Brandham's
[59:42] talking about the adoption of the sons
[59:45] and daughters of God. That the that the
[59:47] earth is actually in groaning. It's
[59:50] groaning to bring forth the the the
[59:53] manifestation of the sons of God.
[59:56] Because listen, the manifestation of the
[59:59] sons of God is going to fulfill the
[1:00:01] scripture of the rapture in this age.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why she she's she's the
[1:00:09] she's she's the the the the the super
[1:00:12] church that's been raised up in the last
[1:00:15] days to bring forth the sons of God.
[1:00:19] Amen. And we are in the adoption stage
[1:00:22] that leads us into our position as sons
[1:00:27] of God. And it's only in this time
[1:00:31] that we come to this level of maturity
[1:00:35] that will actually produce the rapture.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; There's elements that God ordained
[1:00:43] because you know if you look back and
[1:00:45] you go back into the mind of God before
[1:00:49] he was even God, he was the
[1:00:51] self-existent one. And what he did was
[1:00:54] he created angels.
[1:00:57] Okay? And those angels were basically
[1:01:00] created and it was at that point that he
[1:01:03] became God because they worshiped him.
[1:01:06] Without the angels, he could not have
[1:01:08] been God. But then he goes and he
[1:01:11] creates a son and he he he expresses
[1:01:15] himself an Adam. And it was at that
[1:01:18] point that he actually became a father.
[1:01:21] So it was there that sons were actually
[1:01:25] manifest at the very beginning. That was
[1:01:28] his original plan at the very beginning.
[1:01:31] Amen. And so the what he had planned in
[1:01:34] his mind at the very beginning is what
[1:01:37] he's going to actually manifest and
[1:01:40] fulfill in the end time. Amen. Because
[1:01:43] everything you know you know what
[1:01:45] happened? The fall took place. Adam
[1:01:47] forfeited the book. Amen. What what
[1:01:50] book? the book of inheritance, the book
[1:01:53] that the sons of God in the last days
[1:01:56] are to take and to fulfill the the the
[1:01:59] original plan of God from the beginning
[1:02:02] from before the foundations of the
[1:02:03] world. That's why he knew that you would
[1:02:07] come to this church. You would come to
[1:02:09] this revelation. You would come to this
[1:02:12] understanding of sunship. Amen. That's
[1:02:15] why, you know, there's so many different
[1:02:17] churches out there and they're talking
[1:02:18] about, you know, being a son of God and
[1:02:21] being a Christian, but what what where's
[1:02:24] the revelation on their true position as
[1:02:27] a son of God when they read the
[1:02:29] scripture that says that you were
[1:02:32] predestinated
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; unto the adoption of sons
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; from before the foundations of the
[1:02:39] world. Where's the revelation on all
[1:02:42] that? Where's the understanding all that
[1:02:44] on all that? What? That God just
[1:02:45] predestinated and says, "I'll make you a
[1:02:47] son. I'll make you a son. I'm not gonna
[1:02:50] make you one. I'm not gonna No, that's
[1:02:51] not the way he did it.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; He saw exactly what he would require. He
[1:02:58] saw before the foundations of the world
[1:03:01] that his thoughts would go forth into
[1:03:05] the world in order to manifest what he
[1:03:08] saw." He said, "My word shall not return
[1:03:10] unto me void." Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And he and and if you are a son or a
[1:03:14] daughter of God, you were not created.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; you were expressed
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Adam, let us make man
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; in our image
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; in the image of God. So when God
[1:03:26] expressed Adam, he was in the very image
[1:03:30] of God. He was in theophony.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; He had a theophony body. He had a body
[1:03:36] that was eternal, that looked like a
[1:03:38] man, that was expressed on the earth as
[1:03:41] a man. Amen. And God knew that when the
[1:03:44] word went forth and he sent you, where
[1:03:48] were you when the sons of God shouted
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; together?
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that all took before the
[1:03:55] foundation. Where were you? He was
[1:03:56] telling Job, when when I when I laid the
[1:03:58] foundations, when I did this, where were
[1:04:01] you? You see all what was what was God
[1:04:04] saying? He says, "I've got a plan. This
[1:04:07] plan is going to be manifest. It's going
[1:04:09] to it's going to come to pass." That's
[1:04:11] why Job said he caught the revelation.
[1:04:13] He says, "Though the skin worms eat this
[1:04:16] flesh, I will I he saw the
[1:04:19] resurrection."
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; He saw the revelation on the body
[1:04:24] change. He saw that he would be in a
[1:04:26] theophony body. Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; He knew that there was that there was a
[1:04:30] plan that that God was going to fulfill.
[1:04:32] Amen. and you being a part of the
[1:04:36] thoughts, the attributes that were
[1:04:38] expressed from God in this last day, you
[1:04:42] can't help but recognize the word.
[1:04:47] That's why you heard this message all of
[1:04:49] a sudden
[1:04:51] catches your attention, draws you into
[1:04:53] the church. You start feeding on the
[1:04:56] word. You start to hear about a prophet.
[1:04:59] All of a sudden, you take it back to the
[1:05:00] word of God. Everything starts to kind
[1:05:03] of ful, you know, kind of make sense.
[1:05:05] Everything starts to open up. All of a
[1:05:07] sudden, you start to see this. Then you,
[1:05:09] you know, then then then you see the the
[1:05:11] the that that by God's fornowledge, he
[1:05:13] could predestinate you. So, he actually
[1:05:15] saw you knew that you would want this.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; He knew that you would want this
[1:05:21] salvation.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew that you would want this
[1:05:24] revelation on who you are because he
[1:05:27] knew that you were he knew that that
[1:05:28] that when when he woke you up that the
[1:05:31] that the revelation in you would
[1:05:33] immediately go and and reflect the word
[1:05:36] of God.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; It would just look to the word. Look to
[1:05:38] the word. The word says this. This is
[1:05:41] what the word says I am. This is who I
[1:05:43] am.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so all of this
[1:05:49] started to manifest itself around your
[1:05:52] life. Amen. And so we we uh you know,
[1:05:55] we're in a progression right now
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; of our sunship.
[1:06:00] We're in the adoption stage. Amen. But
[1:06:03] at some point, we're going to manifest
[1:06:06] sons of God.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now by revelation
[1:06:12] we are we are expressing the nature of
[1:06:15] God. The Holy Ghost that's in us has a
[1:06:18] purpose within us to express God's
[1:06:21] nature, God's purpose, God's desire.
[1:06:24] That's why you separate from the things
[1:06:25] of the world. That's why you you you
[1:06:28] become a part of this ministry. That's
[1:06:30] why you can't identify with with the
[1:06:33] denominational teachings on the word of
[1:06:35] God.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's an element that that you
[1:06:39] just cannot be deceived. You just don't
[1:06:42] understand it. But there's there's it's
[1:06:44] the Holy Ghost. It's the nature of God
[1:06:46] that's come and take and possessed you
[1:06:48] and taken over you as a son. Amen. Glory
[1:06:52] to God. Amen. And so you're you're
[1:06:55] you're anointed by the Holy Spirit to
[1:06:57] overcome the age that you're in.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; You face challenges. You face
[1:07:02] situations. you, many of you, I know it
[1:07:05] was a challenge even to get here this
[1:07:07] morning.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; But there's something in you that
[1:07:13] overcomes
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; and you're going to look back even a
[1:07:17] year from now, you'll look back and
[1:07:18] you'll still you see yourself in the
[1:07:20] house of the Lord. And if you can't see
[1:07:22] yourself progressing in God,
[1:07:25] then you need to go back where you left
[1:07:27] them.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you find yourself in a in a
[1:07:32] condition where you're just never
[1:07:34] satisfied, you're you're you're you're
[1:07:36] you're just, you know, you're not a like
[1:07:39] a Christian should be the happiest
[1:07:41] person in the world. I'm not talking
[1:07:43] about putting on happiness, but I'm
[1:07:45] talking about the joy of God.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The joy of the Lord. Amen. This
[1:07:52] listen, the rapture is all about
[1:07:54] bringing you into ecstasy of the joy of
[1:07:57] the Lord.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; That's what the rapture actually is.
[1:08:00] Amen. Even if you look up the word
[1:08:02] rapture, it means extreme joy. Amen.
[1:08:05] Praise God. This is what you are. This
[1:08:08] is the part of the word that you are.
[1:08:11] And you cannot remain the same. You've
[1:08:14] got to be growing and expanding
[1:08:18] your revelation of who you are in the
[1:08:21] body of Christ.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, you know,
[1:08:26] there's there's so I want to read some
[1:08:28] scriptures here. The Lord led me to
[1:08:30] these scriptures here from the book of
[1:08:31] Hebrews
[1:08:33] because I believe that, you know,
[1:08:35] because of the the the time and the
[1:08:38] season that we're living in right now,
[1:08:41] okay, there's an element of deception in
[1:08:44] the land. And this is always going to be
[1:08:49] an aspect of your walk with God to
[1:08:52] overcome the deception that's around
[1:08:56] you.
[1:08:57] until we get out of here. The Bible said
[1:09:01] it would get so deceiving that it would
[1:09:03] deceive even the very elect
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; if it were possible. So, so if if this
[1:09:09] is the hour that we're in and there's a
[1:09:12] and there's a deception that's still
[1:09:14] around us as sons and daughters of God
[1:09:18] in this process of adoption,
[1:09:21] we need to recognize
[1:09:23] the character and who we are and what it
[1:09:27] is that we're actually supposed to be
[1:09:28] expressing. Because a lot of people,
[1:09:31] they just say, "Oh, I belong to the
[1:09:32] message of the hour. I believe God sent
[1:09:34] a prophet. I believe I I belong to a
[1:09:37] message church. That doesn't place you
[1:09:39] into the body of Christ.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; You see, it would be so deceiving that
[1:09:45] it would deceive even the very elect.
[1:09:46] Means it's got to be right close by.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; The deception's got to be right around
[1:09:52] you.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; It's got to be right there to the point
[1:09:56] where whoa,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; you're going to say, "Are you kidding
[1:10:01] me?
[1:10:02] You mean I've been this brother and
[1:10:04] sister have been coming to the church
[1:10:06] for so long. This brother, this
[1:10:08] individual, this one here, and all of a
[1:10:11] sudden there's a there's a there's a
[1:10:13] there's a seed of discrepancy within
[1:10:15] them. There's a there's an element
[1:10:17] within them that that that that that
[1:10:19] they've for some reason they're not
[1:10:22] they're not walking in the same
[1:10:24] revelation that you are in the liberty
[1:10:27] of the sons of God under the anointing
[1:10:30] of the mighty angel himself.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that whole element now is
[1:10:37] what we want to just take a look at as
[1:10:40] we mature because this is all about
[1:10:43] adoption, right? Adoption is where the
[1:10:45] sons and daughters mature. They they
[1:10:48] they they start to, you know, become
[1:10:50] aware of their their calling. They
[1:10:53] become aware of who they are. They
[1:10:56] become aware of who they're working
[1:10:57] with. You know, sometimes you work in a
[1:11:00] company and there's one guy that's after
[1:11:02] you all the time trying to get you
[1:11:04] fired, trying to trying to bring you
[1:11:06] down. You know, he's not your he's not
[1:11:08] your friend. He pretends to be your
[1:11:11] friend. [laughter]
[1:11:12] That's the enemy. That's the devil.
[1:11:14] Amen. Praise God. So, so we need to, you
[1:11:17] know, we need to come to a place where
[1:11:19] we need to mature. We need to, you know,
[1:11:22] stand as as true mature sons and
[1:11:24] daughters of God. So, here now, let's
[1:11:26] read from Hebrews chapter 3.
[1:11:30] Amen.
[1:11:31] We're going to take some scriptures here
[1:11:33] and we're just going to comment on it as
[1:11:35] the Lord just kind of unveils certain
[1:11:37] aspects here. For every house is builded
[1:11:41] by some man,
[1:11:43] but he that built all things is God. So
[1:11:47] we know that God has this great plan and
[1:11:50] he's the one that's built it all. Amen.
[1:11:52] And look, and Moses verily was faithful
[1:11:56] in all his house as a servant for a
[1:12:00] testimony of those things which were to
[1:12:02] be spoken after.
[1:12:04] But now here, so here now we want to see
[1:12:08] here. We want to bring it to the message
[1:12:10] of the hour. Amen. Praise God. We want
[1:12:12] to we want to we want to come home. We
[1:12:14] want to recognize where we're at. We
[1:12:16] want the Holy Spirit to just, you know,
[1:12:19] lift off any hidden things because we're
[1:12:23] the ones that that that are actually
[1:12:25] going to manif uh manifest the mysteries
[1:12:28] that were kind of, you know, hidden, the
[1:12:31] hidden mysteries. Amen. And we come into
[1:12:34] this what's called the fellowship of the
[1:12:36] mystery. We're going to be looking at
[1:12:37] more of that later on. Amen. And so this
[1:12:41] whole element here now Moses being a
[1:12:43] type, brother Brandon being a type of
[1:12:46] Moses, he was faithful to all that he
[1:12:48] was given in his house. Amen. But Christ
[1:12:53] as a son over his own house,
[1:12:58] whose house are we?
[1:13:01] Okay, now we're talking about adoption.
[1:13:03] We're talking about sons of God. You got
[1:13:05] to follow me here. Okay, this is very
[1:13:07] simple, but there's something that we're
[1:13:10] that we're that we're going to, you
[1:13:11] know, that the Holy Spirit, you know, is
[1:13:13] going to bring out for us. Amen. And it
[1:13:15] says here, but Christ as a son over his
[1:13:19] own house, whose house are we if we hold
[1:13:23] fast the confidence and the rejoicing of
[1:13:27] the hope firm unto the end,
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; unto the end. And there's going to be
[1:13:33] sons of God that are going to come out
[1:13:35] on the end in the end time that are
[1:13:38] going to stand firm, that are going to
[1:13:40] hold firm to their sunship
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; because they're under Christ.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go to the next scripture.
[1:13:49] Wherefore, now he goes on to explain,
[1:13:52] "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith
[1:13:55] today, if you will hear his voice,
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; amen." A lot of people say, "You only
[1:14:02] got to listen to the voice on the
[1:14:03] tapes." They're the only thing you need
[1:14:05] to listen to. You don't need anything
[1:14:07] else. You need to just listen to the
[1:14:09] voice on the tape.
[1:14:12] I'm not saying there's anything wrong
[1:14:15] with the voice on the tape. I believe it
[1:14:18] was the voice of God speaking through
[1:14:20] our prophet.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I listen to those
[1:14:24] tapes every single day. But Christ is
[1:14:27] alive and well now. Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to bring this to a place
[1:14:34] where we get a a clear understanding of
[1:14:36] of where the voice is now today. Amen.
[1:14:41] Can you still get fed? Can God speak to
[1:14:44] you through the tapes? Can God do
[1:14:46] supernatural through the tapes?
[1:14:48] Absolutely he can.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; He's done it for me. He's spoken lift to
[1:14:52] ear. I listen every single day to those
[1:14:54] tapes. Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But I want to know what
[1:14:58] God's doing in this hour.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; For the sons of God.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. So that they can
[1:15:05] come into their full maturity and full
[1:15:08] manifestation of the part of the word
[1:15:11] that they are.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; William Brandham fulfilled his part in
[1:15:15] the word. But like we read last week,
[1:15:18] Joshua said, he was told by the Holy
[1:15:20] Ghost, "My servant Moses is dead."
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you you take them over. Amen.
[1:15:27] Praise God. So here he's and this is
[1:15:29] what this was talking about. This is
[1:15:30] what Paul he was going back and he was
[1:15:32] explaining to the Hebrews. Amen. The
[1:15:35] Jews about, you know, because they were
[1:15:38] all stuck under, you know, oh, we
[1:15:40] believe Moses, we believe Abraham, we
[1:15:42] believe Moses, we believe Abraham. And
[1:15:44] there's a people in the land today
[1:15:46] that's, oh, we believe William Brandham.
[1:15:48] We believe, listen,
[1:15:50] I believe William Brandon,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; we believe this ministry would not even
[1:15:55] have come forth without the teachings
[1:15:57] and the and the and the fulfillment of
[1:16:00] the seventh angel messenger. We're going
[1:16:02] to see how important he really is. Amen.
[1:16:05] But they're they're they're missing the
[1:16:07] element and and the and and the part
[1:16:10] where where where it brings us to the
[1:16:12] day that we are right now and what what
[1:16:14] it is that's going to actually bring
[1:16:16] into manifestation the sons of God in
[1:16:19] the last days.
[1:16:22] He says here verse 8, "Harden not your
[1:16:24] hearts as in the provocation in the day
[1:16:27] of the temptation in the wilderness when
[1:16:29] your fathers tempted me, proved me, and
[1:16:33] saw my works 40 years. Wherefore I was
[1:16:36] grieved with that generation and said
[1:16:38] they do ear in their hearts and they
[1:16:41] have not known my ways. Listen, God did
[1:16:44] so much supernatural
[1:16:47] through William Branham. His ministry
[1:16:50] went around the world seven times. He
[1:16:53] unveiled he listen he exposed all of the
[1:16:57] mystery and of iniquity. He exposed the
[1:17:00] Catholic Church. He exposed mystery
[1:17:03] Babylon. He his message was come out of
[1:17:06] her my people. Amen. Praise God. He
[1:17:09] exposed all of those things. Amen. But
[1:17:12] but that's not our ministry.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; That's not our ministry. That we're
[1:17:18] we're we're the continuation
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; of the revelation that he brought forth
[1:17:24] when the mighty angel came down in 1963.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to recognize the handing
[1:17:31] off of the ministry from Malachi 4:5,
[1:17:35] Revelations 10:7,
[1:17:38] the angel on on earth when he introduced
[1:17:41] us to the mighty angel. We need to
[1:17:43] recognize there is a transformation
[1:17:46] there there's there's a there's a a you
[1:17:49] know a dispensational change of the same
[1:17:52] God.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; That's always been what he's doing.
[1:17:57] Amen. Praise God. But there's people
[1:17:59] that have hardened their hearts. They're
[1:18:00] staying un they're staying in that one
[1:18:02] place.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; They hear me talk and they, you know,
[1:18:06] maybe, you know, you hear a minister
[1:18:08] saying, "Listen, it's not just the
[1:18:10] tapes." And you think, "Oh, they're
[1:18:11] against the tapes." We're not against
[1:18:13] the tapes.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; We support Voice of God every year.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; We support them. We believe that that
[1:18:21] that that the message of William
[1:18:24] Brandham needs to be sent out throughout
[1:18:26] the world because the people when they
[1:18:29] receive the Holy Ghost, they're going to
[1:18:31] see the importance of his message
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; because God has an elected people. God
[1:18:37] has not one of them is going to be lost.
[1:18:40] Every single one of them's got to come
[1:18:41] in. They're going to see every aspect of
[1:18:44] this message.
[1:18:46] Amen. But there's many that have
[1:18:48] hardened their hearts. They've come to a
[1:18:50] place where they don't want to move on.
[1:18:53] They don't want to they don't want to
[1:18:54] let the five-fold ministry take control
[1:18:57] and and and bring Christ into the
[1:18:59] present stage of his ministry. What and
[1:19:02] and bring into fulfillment the
[1:19:04] manifestation of the sons of God which
[1:19:06] is going to produce the rapture.
[1:19:11] Let's read the next scripture. For we
[1:19:14] listen he goes Paul he says for we are
[1:19:17] made partakers of Christ
[1:19:21] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:19:24] confidence steadfast unto the end. We're
[1:19:28] partakers of the word. We're partakers
[1:19:31] of the anointed word. That's what Christ
[1:19:34] means when we talk about Jesus Christ.
[1:19:39] He was the word. In the beginning was
[1:19:40] the word. The word was with God and the
[1:19:42] word was God. Amen. And so the word
[1:19:47] being manifest in this day and you
[1:19:50] catching the revelation of the day means
[1:19:52] that you're a part of Christ. You're
[1:19:55] actually a part of the manifestation of
[1:19:59] God's word in this day. Amen. While it
[1:20:02] is said today, if you will hear his
[1:20:05] voice, you got to continue to listen for
[1:20:08] his voice. They'll tell you, "Oh, you
[1:20:10] got to just play the tapes." They'll
[1:20:13] tell you, "No, no, you you should be
[1:20:14] just playing the tapes." And yes, you
[1:20:16] can have a pastor. You there, you know,
[1:20:19] it's fine to have pastor and everything
[1:20:20] else in the church, but you should be
[1:20:22] playing the tapes and then the pastor
[1:20:25] can come up and he can comment on it
[1:20:27] and, you know, he can exhort, but he's
[1:20:29] just to say basically and exhort on what
[1:20:32] the prophet said. Well, we actually do
[1:20:34] that.
[1:20:36] I don't play the actual tapes, but when
[1:20:38] we put up all the quotes and we're
[1:20:41] exhorting and we're we're we're actually
[1:20:43] bringing forth the message of the hour
[1:20:46] in the same way, but we're we're
[1:20:48] allowing the mighty angel himself,
[1:20:50] Christ,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; to come on the scene himself
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; so that he can speak to your personal
[1:20:56] situations,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; bring you out of your personal
[1:20:59] deceptions, take you out of your
[1:21:02] conditions that you're in. Amen. Praise
[1:21:05] God. He never said, you know, like that
[1:21:07] like he said the Holy Ghost would come
[1:21:10] upon you.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And would show you things to come.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "Today, if you will
[1:21:19] hear his voice, harden not your hearts
[1:21:22] as in the provocation."
[1:21:25] My praise God. Let's read the the next
[1:21:28] quote here. And this is all from
[1:21:30] adoption. Listen here. He says, "Then
[1:21:33] did you notice Moses?" Pay attention.
[1:21:37] That great miracle performer that
[1:21:39] brought down that brought down Israel
[1:21:42] down through the land and brought them
[1:21:44] up to the promised land, but did not
[1:21:48] place their inheritance to them.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Listen, Brother Brandham, he he brought
[1:21:55] us right to that very place. Amen. He
[1:21:59] brought us right to 1963. The mighty
[1:22:02] angel was right come down. He comes down
[1:22:05] with an open book. We know who that
[1:22:07] mighty angel was. It was the Lord Jesus
[1:22:09] Christ himself.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; But there had to be an earthly angel to
[1:22:13] introduce him,
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; to identify him so that the seals could
[1:22:18] be opened. Amen. And look now, he goes
[1:22:20] on. He says, "He did not give them their
[1:22:23] inheritance. He led them up to the
[1:22:25] land." But Joshua,
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Joshua,
[1:22:32] divided
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; the land
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; to the people.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; This is the ministry that we are under.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Our Joshua, which is the Holy Spirit,
[1:22:43] which is the Holy Ghost,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; which is our Ephesians, is the one
[1:22:48] that's right now positionally placing
[1:22:51] every son and daughter of God.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Into their rightful position in the
[1:22:57] message of the hour. Amen. Look, he says
[1:23:00] Joshua divided the land to the people.
[1:23:02] Is that right? And Christ brought the
[1:23:04] church up to the place to where their
[1:23:06] possession was made to them was given to
[1:23:10] them. Just the Jordan to cross. Oh,
[1:23:13] hallelujah. We've crossed. There's
[1:23:15] people that have already crossed. You
[1:23:17] know, you know the capstone. You know
[1:23:18] that gap between the seven church ages
[1:23:20] and the and the and the capstone. Amen.
[1:23:23] That's our Jordan. Amen. Only the Holy
[1:23:26] Ghost can take you over that. Not the
[1:23:28] tapes.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; The tapes ain't going to take you over
[1:23:30] that.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; It's going to take Christ himself in
[1:23:33] you. Your your your own revelation of
[1:23:36] who you are. The word. He says, "And
[1:23:38] Christ brought the church to the place
[1:23:40] where their possession was made to them,
[1:23:41] was given to them just a Jordan to
[1:23:44] cross, but the Holy Spirit is the one
[1:23:46] who sets the church in order."
[1:23:49] The Joshua of today puts the church in
[1:23:52] its order, giving to each one gifts,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; places, positions, and he is the voice
[1:24:00] of God speaking to the inner man. He is
[1:24:04] the voice of God speaking to the inner
[1:24:07] man. I'm going to say that again. He is
[1:24:09] the voice of God.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; They want No. The voice of God is only
[1:24:17] on the tapes. No. No. He
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; is the voice of God. Amen.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; To the inner man that Christ has saved.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; That means every son and every daughter
[1:24:29] of God that's been saved by the Holy
[1:24:31] Ghost. Amen. The Holy Spirit.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, how much clearer do you need it?
[1:24:42] Just a simple quote right from the book
[1:24:44] of adoption back in 1960. He had the
[1:24:48] revelation and here now the sons of God
[1:24:51] that are to manifest that are groaning.
[1:24:55] Now you understand what it is to be
[1:24:57] groaning. That the earth is is is
[1:24:59] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:25:01] sons of God because there's barely
[1:25:04] there's barely any that are catching the
[1:25:07] revelation of what God is doing in this
[1:25:09] day and in this hour and they're being
[1:25:11] caught up into into you know spats
[1:25:14] between and ministers you know uh
[1:25:17] lashing out at one another and and and
[1:25:20] different doctrines coming. We're not
[1:25:21] interested in any of that.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; We're here to preach the word. We're
[1:25:25] here to give you a clear understanding
[1:25:27] of the word of God so that you can know
[1:25:29] who you are
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; and understand the day that you're
[1:25:32] living in and why you identify yourself
[1:25:35] with this message.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You know, last
[1:25:40] week we were we were reading from You
[1:25:42] can go to the next slide. Just stay on
[1:25:43] that for a minute.
[1:25:45] Last week we were reading from Romans
[1:25:48] chapter 8. For as many as are led by the
[1:25:50] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[1:25:53] Amen. We're not led by by man. We're led
[1:25:56] by the Holy Spirit. That's what makes us
[1:25:59] heir. You've received the spirit of of
[1:26:01] bond. Listen, you have not received the
[1:26:03] spirit of bondage.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Okay? You're not to come under any kind
[1:26:07] of bondage. Not any where where man's
[1:26:10] teachings start to override the teaching
[1:26:12] of the Holy Ghost. We're not bringing
[1:26:15] anything here that's not in the word of
[1:26:17] God and not what the pro and what the
[1:26:19] prophet didn't say. The prophet said it.
[1:26:22] We line it up with the word of God. The
[1:26:24] word, the prophet.
[1:26:27] You hear it, you understand it, you
[1:26:29] believe it. That settles it.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's It's got to make sense.
[1:26:34] So, we're not under we're not under
[1:26:36] bondage of fear. Amen. We've received
[1:26:39] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry,
[1:26:43] "Father, we have a relationship with the
[1:26:46] father." Our relationship is not with
[1:26:50] any organization, not with any message,
[1:26:54] you know, camp or teaching or anything
[1:26:57] else. We are not a message camp. We are
[1:27:00] the mystical body of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:02] That's what we identify with. Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And there are men in the
[1:27:06] land that are recognizing that the Holy
[1:27:09] Ghost is is is now moving forward,
[1:27:13] progressing, has turned another
[1:27:15] dispensational corner to where they've
[1:27:17] they've come to recognize that, hey,
[1:27:20] there's a message that you have, which
[1:27:23] is Christ in you, your hope of glory,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; and this is what we're preaching. Amen.
[1:27:29] Glory to God. And so we're not under any
[1:27:31] of that kind of uh anointing or or or or
[1:27:35] meshes camp anointing or or you know
[1:27:39] tape, you know, only listening to the
[1:27:42] tapes and this and that. We listen to
[1:27:44] the tapes and we listen to the Holy
[1:27:46] Ghost. Amen. That's that everything has
[1:27:49] to line up together. Amen. Praise God. I
[1:27:51] can only say it the way I see it.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Trust you're seeing
[1:27:55] what I'm trying to express here. Amen.
[1:27:58] Glory to God.
[1:28:00] Now, when you look at this scripture
[1:28:02] that we just all read here on the
[1:28:04] provocation and everything, there's a
[1:28:06] scripture from Psalms 95. And if you go
[1:28:09] and read Psalms 95, it was basically
[1:28:11] what Paul was was, you know, um
[1:28:14] identifying when he was talking to the
[1:28:16] Hebrews where he was talking about how,
[1:28:18] you know, um in Psalms 95 it says, "Oh,
[1:28:23] come uh let us sing unto the Lord. Let
[1:28:26] us make a joyful noise to the rock of
[1:28:28] our salvation. and let us come before
[1:28:29] his presence. Amen. With thanksgiving
[1:28:32] and make a joyful noise unto him with
[1:28:34] psalms for the Lord is great. Now he
[1:28:37] goes on here. He starts to go on. He
[1:28:39] starts talking about exactly what what
[1:28:42] took place back in the wilderness. And
[1:28:44] he says, "And great and and uh for the
[1:28:47] Lord is a great God and a great king
[1:28:50] above all gods. In his hand are the deep
[1:28:54] places." Amen. are the deep places. And
[1:28:58] he goes on here
[1:29:01] uh the strength of the hills is his
[1:29:04] also. The sea is his and he made it and
[1:29:07] his hands form the dry land. Amen. Oh
[1:29:11] come let us worship and bow down. Let us
[1:29:13] kneel before the Lord our maker for he
[1:29:15] is our God and we are the people of his
[1:29:18] pasture and the sheep of his hand. Today
[1:29:22] if ye will hear his voice.
[1:29:27] This this scripture pertains to this
[1:29:29] hour.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have to see the compound
[1:29:33] revelation. Amen. Glory to God. Harden
[1:29:36] not your heart as in the provocation as
[1:29:39] in the day of temptation in the
[1:29:41] wilderness when your fathers tempted me,
[1:29:44] proved me, and saw my work 40 years
[1:29:47] along. He says, "I was grieved with this
[1:29:50] generation and said, it is a people that
[1:29:53] do ear their heart that do ear in their
[1:29:57] heart and they have not known my ways."
[1:30:00] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:30:02] forever. He does not change. Unto whom I
[1:30:05] swear in my wrath, they shall not enter
[1:30:10] into my rest. Saints,
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; this rest that we have
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; under having this revelation of who we
[1:30:19] are, it gives us a rest that's beyond
[1:30:22] human understanding.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; It it it it it just separates us from
[1:30:26] all of the noise,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; all of the confusion.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; You you don't have to you don't have to
[1:30:32] worry about uh you know, when when you
[1:30:34] hear certain people trying to pull you
[1:30:36] certain ways and draw you certain ways.
[1:30:39] You've heard his voice. You've
[1:30:41] recognized his voice. Amen. Praise God.
[1:30:44] And in Hebrews chapter 3, here Paul is
[1:30:47] using the reference to Israel's
[1:30:48] wandering in the desert from the story
[1:30:51] of Exodus. And here in this incident,
[1:30:55] the nation of Israel came to the border
[1:30:57] of the promised land. There's a lot of
[1:30:59] people. They've come right to the very
[1:31:00] border of the revelation of the opening
[1:31:03] of the seven seals. Amen. They've come
[1:31:06] right to that place where they they'll
[1:31:08] tell you, "Oh, God opened up the seals
[1:31:11] and all the mysteries have been
[1:31:13] revealed." And they don't actually have
[1:31:15] a revelation on the mysteries.
[1:31:19] Because first of all, it's the it's it's
[1:31:21] not the mysteries that that that that
[1:31:25] give us rapturing faith.
[1:31:28] There's a lot of people that know about
[1:31:30] what took place through the seven church
[1:31:32] ages. All of those things was that
[1:31:34] that's all history. That's all history.
[1:31:37] That's, you know, like we know that
[1:31:39] there's going to be a great tribulation.
[1:31:41] We know that the sixth seal still has
[1:31:43] certain aspects to unveil. But we've
[1:31:45] already been taught, we've been given
[1:31:49] the teaching and the understanding of
[1:31:51] the great deception that started right
[1:31:54] from the right right from the first
[1:31:55] church age, Paul being the first church
[1:31:57] age messenger, all the way to where we
[1:32:00] are today.
[1:32:01] That's not going to give you rapturing
[1:32:03] faith to know those things. That's
[1:32:05] history.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; There's rapturing faith that can only
[1:32:11] come by if the same spirit
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; that raised Christ from the dead,
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; the resurrection power, if that same
[1:32:21] spirit dwell in you, it will quicken.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; It will produce a rapture.
[1:32:29] It will take you from this dimension
[1:32:31] into that other dimension. This is what
[1:32:34] we're interested in.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; This is what we're feeding on. So here
[1:32:39] the the many have been brought right up
[1:32:41] to the promised land and then lost
[1:32:44] confidence in God. A lot of people are
[1:32:46] losing confidence.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; You'll hear people where is the coming
[1:32:49] of the Lord? My God, this is going on
[1:32:52] here. This is happening around my life.
[1:32:54] This is falling apart. I thought God was
[1:32:56] supposed to, you know, do this and do
[1:32:58] that and look at my children and look at
[1:33:01] this situation here and look at my
[1:33:03] finance. You start to get discouraged
[1:33:05] because you're starting to look at the
[1:33:07] circumstances instead of looking at the
[1:33:09] promise.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; It's said in the scriptures that we read
[1:33:15] that the trying of your faith,
[1:33:19] it's it's going to it's going to reveal
[1:33:21] something in you. It's going to be so
[1:33:23] much more glorious. what's going to be
[1:33:26] revealed through the the through the
[1:33:28] trying, through the testing, through all
[1:33:30] the things that you have to go through.
[1:33:32] But many have come right up to that
[1:33:34] place. Rather than trusting God, most of
[1:33:37] the people are given up hope. And as a
[1:33:40] result, only a tiny remnant of the
[1:33:42] nation was allowed to actually enter
[1:33:45] into Canaan. Amen. And this chapter from
[1:33:49] the book of Hebrews explains, now this
[1:33:52] is important, that Jesus Christ is
[1:33:56] superior to Moses.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is superior to Moses and
[1:34:07] all of Moses's accomplishments.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Christians therefore need to encourage
[1:34:12] each other to fully trust in the word.
[1:34:17] Amen. In order to see the fulfillment of
[1:34:20] his promise in you.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know, listen, we need
[1:34:30] to recognize that Jesus Christ is the
[1:34:33] voice.
[1:34:34] He is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:34:37] forever. Glory to God. Let's go to the
[1:34:40] next scripture here in Matthew chapter
[1:34:42] 17. Do you know that Jesus had an
[1:34:44] adoption process? Amen. And that we're
[1:34:48] we're the ones that are in Christ that
[1:34:50] we identify with his house. Well, let's
[1:34:53] read the scripture. And after six days,
[1:34:55] Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
[1:34:59] brother, and bringeth them up into a
[1:35:01] high mountain apart, and was tr
[1:35:03] transfigured before them. And his face
[1:35:06] did shine as the sun, and his reignment
[1:35:09] was white as the light. And behold,
[1:35:12] there appeared unto them the Old
[1:35:14] Testament and the New Testament, Moses
[1:35:16] and Elijah, talking with him. Then Peter
[1:35:20] answered, then answered Peter, and said
[1:35:22] unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to
[1:35:25] be here. If thou wilt, let us make here
[1:35:28] three tabernacles.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, they want to they want to listen.
[1:35:33] They want to talk about the tent vision.
[1:35:34] They want to they want to create a tent
[1:35:36] for William Brham. They want to bring
[1:35:38] him back again so that he can meet the
[1:35:41] people in the tent. No, no, no, no.
[1:35:43] Listen, listen to what what the Holy
[1:35:45] Ghost said. Listen to what God said. He
[1:35:47] said, he says, "If thou wilt, let us
[1:35:50] make three tabernacles, one for thee,
[1:35:52] and one for Moses and one for Elijah.
[1:35:55] While he yet spake,
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; behold, a bright cloud." Oh, glory to
[1:36:01] God. I'm glad that cloud showed up in
[1:36:03] 1963.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God forever more.
[1:36:09] And and behold, a bright cloud
[1:36:12] overshadowed them. And behold, a voice
[1:36:14] out of the cloud
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; which said, "This is my beloved son in
[1:36:20] whom I am well pleased." What did he
[1:36:23] say? Hear ye him.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; That's the voice that we're listening
[1:36:30] to. That's the voice that we're feeding
[1:36:32] on. That's who we that that's what we've
[1:36:35] come to recognize is the message of the
[1:36:38] hour.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Adoption
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; of sons.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brandham here
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; next in the hidden life. He says if
[1:36:51] you'll notice in a perfect type God did
[1:36:54] his own son the same way he taken three
[1:36:57] as a witness where the mouth of two or
[1:37:00] three witnesses every word to be
[1:37:01] established. Peter, James, and John,
[1:37:04] love, faith, and hope. And he taken them
[1:37:07] up into a mountain apart from the rest
[1:37:11] of the world. And there, before the
[1:37:13] official witness, God adopted his own
[1:37:16] son.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is showing exactly what
[1:37:19] he's going to do in you and me. Amen.
[1:37:21] Glory to God. God, he was transfigured
[1:37:24] before the official witnesses. God
[1:37:27] adopted his own son. He was transfigured
[1:37:30] before them. And his reignment did shine
[1:37:33] as the sun. And a voice out of the
[1:37:35] clouds said, "This is my beloved son.
[1:37:38] Hear ye him." Set him upon a mountain.
[1:37:40] Put the witnesses there to see. Clothe
[1:37:42] him in a robe as bright as the sun
[1:37:44] shining in this. Then then even shined
[1:37:48] like the sun in its strength. Oh,
[1:37:51] listen. These bodies that God has taken
[1:37:53] us to, let me tell you. Hallelujah. And
[1:37:56] God spoke out, "This is my beloved son.
[1:37:59] Hear ye him." God adopted his own child
[1:38:02] into the family. Hear me no longer, but
[1:38:05] this is my beloved son who takes over
[1:38:10] from here on. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Still the voice of God. And look, he
[1:38:15] goes that adoption
[1:38:18] is near the time in parable of the
[1:38:21] church.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; It's time for that
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; for what? the manifestation and the
[1:38:29] adoption of the sons and daughters of
[1:38:32] the living God. Amen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Where now the voice of God has moved
[1:38:37] from the prophet of Malachi 4:5,
[1:38:40] Revelations 10:7. It's moved into the
[1:38:43] the the the church, the bride, this this
[1:38:48] the ones who God has said, "Now you take
[1:38:50] the book.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; You take the revelation. You start to
[1:38:54] speak and prophesy this word. you start
[1:38:57] to manifest my voice in the last days
[1:39:00] because there's something in that book
[1:39:02] of inheritance that needs to be
[1:39:04] displayed to the people. Amen. Glory to
[1:39:07] God. Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; But listen,
[1:39:11] all of this is great. It's all wonderful
[1:39:14] to hear that.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; But you've got a part
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; in it.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; You've got something to do.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; You've got to surrender to it.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; You've got to you got to check your
[1:39:24] heart. You got to see if you've if if by
[1:39:26] if by chance your heart's been hardened
[1:39:28] in some way
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; because of of of sin, because of
[1:39:31] something that you're not willing to
[1:39:33] surrender. Do you know that if you like,
[1:39:35] you know, we we were talking about, you
[1:39:37] know, where where you're part of God's
[1:39:39] economy, you're part of the body of
[1:39:40] Christ, and God wants to place you into
[1:39:43] a certain position, but you you you you
[1:39:46] got this hardened heart. You've got this
[1:39:48] condition in you that that that maybe is
[1:39:51] a a selfish kind of a spirit that you
[1:39:54] don't want to let go and you don't want
[1:39:56] to let God into every part of your life.
[1:39:58] You don't want to let God deal with
[1:40:00] those things, get those things out of
[1:40:01] your life. But this bride, this this
[1:40:04] this uh uh church, these individuals
[1:40:08] that were attributes of God that God
[1:40:11] sent forth from before the foundations
[1:40:13] of the world, they're different from the
[1:40:16] from other people in the world. They
[1:40:18] feel the conviction of the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:21] They know when they're doing wrong. They
[1:40:23] recognize that it's wrong. And they want
[1:40:25] to change. They don't want to stay in
[1:40:27] that condition. They want to let go of
[1:40:29] those things. They want to be right with
[1:40:31] God.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You've got to
[1:40:35] surrender your will.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; You've got to surrender your hardness of
[1:40:41] heart and your your own interpretation
[1:40:43] on the word of God and let the Holy
[1:40:46] Spirit, let his will become your will.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; This is the only hour
[1:40:55] where the fullness of the word
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; is made available. Amen.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; To the sons and daughters of God. There
[1:41:03] was never a time. Everything prior to
[1:41:06] the seven seals was all history. Was all
[1:41:10] the Holy Ghost operating in each church
[1:41:14] age. But none of those individuals had
[1:41:17] achieved actual sons of God status.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:26] They died and and listen, even the ones
[1:41:30] before the coming of Christ,
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; they never reached sons of God's status
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; until they
[1:41:40] until Christ himself had to come
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; go to Calvary so that he could remember
[1:41:46] when he went to Calvary, he went to hell
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; to loose those that were in prison,
[1:41:51] those that were shackled. They had not
[1:41:53] come into sun. They they had not because
[1:41:56] it was not available to them yet. The
[1:41:58] sixth dimension was not even available
[1:42:00] yet.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. God had to resurrect so that he
[1:42:05] could take them to the sixth dimension
[1:42:07] so that they could meet with their
[1:42:08] theophony bodies.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; It's only then that they actually reach
[1:42:14] their their status of of theophony which
[1:42:16] is full sunship.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But even they are not complete
[1:42:22] without us. Yes, sir.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; There's something that Listen, why does
[1:42:26] the scripture say that there's got to be
[1:42:28] that that there's that they cannot be
[1:42:30] made perfect without us?
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; What is it that that that that we're
[1:42:34] going to do? What what what part of the
[1:42:37] word are we that we're going to actually
[1:42:39] bring this whole thing into the
[1:42:41] fullness?
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; This is what this is where we're going,
[1:42:44] saints.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; But you see here,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; there's a will.
[1:42:50] Their will, God's will. Amen.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; You know, even Jesus had to overcome his
[1:42:54] own will when he went to the Garden of
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Gethsemane.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he went there and he
[1:43:00] said, "Oh God, if there be any way that
[1:43:02] this cup could be could could be
[1:43:04] removed, but he said, "But not my will,
[1:43:08] thy will be done because there's a
[1:43:11] there's something in you that's purposed
[1:43:14] in you to fulfill this this
[1:43:16] manifestation of the sons of God. You
[1:43:19] you can't you can't avoid it. It's it's
[1:43:22] who you are. It's it's what's it's
[1:43:24] what's it's what's bubbling on the
[1:43:26] inside of you. It's what's giving you
[1:43:28] faith to overcome every situation that
[1:43:31] you deal with on a daily basis.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Now listen here.
[1:43:37] Here brother Brandham in from the
[1:43:38] message leadership.
[1:43:41] Now he's talking about the rich young
[1:43:42] ruler over here. But here he goes on.
[1:43:45] You got to go to the next slide. He says
[1:43:48] here sometime in life like we have to
[1:43:51] confront the things just like this young
[1:43:53] man did.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; There's things in our lives saints.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; God wants to set us free. God wants to
[1:43:59] bring us into our full adoption. Are you
[1:44:01] interested?
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Then let's let the word do it. Amen. He
[1:44:04] says because you are a mortal being and
[1:44:07] you are given you are given the
[1:44:10] opportunity of choice.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; A lot of people say I'm a son of God. I
[1:44:14] don't got to do nothing. God is in me.
[1:44:16] He'll do it all. H
[1:44:20] that's not character.
[1:44:22] That's not the right kind of character.
[1:44:24] No sir. You're given the opportunity of
[1:44:27] choice. You have a choice. God made it
[1:44:30] so you can choose. If he put Adam and
[1:44:33] Eve on free moral agency so they could
[1:44:35] choose. And then they made the wrong
[1:44:38] choice. And see, he could do no more to
[1:44:42] you than he did to them. He's got to put
[1:44:46] you the same thing so you can choose or
[1:44:50] reject.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; This is like we got to come to a place
[1:44:59] where you know like when a son gets
[1:45:01] placed into a place of authority, he's
[1:45:04] given the character and the authority to
[1:45:06] hire what he hires, fires what he fires.
[1:45:09] Amen. He signs the checks. He
[1:45:12] understands what's going on. He does his
[1:45:14] research. He looks in to the business of
[1:45:16] God. Amen. And he understands what God
[1:45:19] requires of him. Brother Brandham
[1:45:22] himself said, "This bride, she'll come
[1:45:25] to a place where she will know what to
[1:45:27] do with the word."
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; This is what we're talking about.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Go to the next slide here. In Revelation
[1:45:35] chapter 4, listen to what brother
[1:45:37] Brandham says here. He says, "How did it
[1:45:40] self-will?"
[1:45:41] Why will you call that self-will,
[1:45:43] brother brethren? Because it puts a man
[1:45:45] and a woman back again just like Adam
[1:45:49] and Eve at the Garden of Eden.
[1:45:52] Oh, what? The two trees. Self-will. This
[1:45:57] one is death. This one is life.
[1:46:00] Self-will. Immoral. Free moral agency.
[1:46:04] God placed the first man, Adam and Eve,
[1:46:07] right here on free moral agency. He
[1:46:10] places you the same place. And the only
[1:46:13] way that you can get this thing fixed in
[1:46:16] here in your own self-will, hallelujah,
[1:46:21] is your own self-will. Your self-will.
[1:46:24] You have to will to do God's will.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; You got to will to do God's will.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; An announcement goes out. We need
[1:46:38] volunteers to do a church cleaning.
[1:46:43] That's God's business.
[1:46:45] That's God's voice through the offices
[1:46:49] calling on the sons and daughters of God
[1:46:52] to override their own will if they've
[1:46:56] got the ability to do it. You've got the
[1:46:58] power of choice. You can choose to go or
[1:47:01] you can choose not to go.
[1:47:04] You can choose to receive the blessing
[1:47:05] of being a part of the body or you can
[1:47:07] choose not to. It's as simple as that.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; You see, these are simple things. But
[1:47:12] let's let's listen your self-will. You
[1:47:14] have to you have to will to do God's
[1:47:17] will. You have to get rid of your own
[1:47:20] will to let God's will come in. For this
[1:47:23] is the only channel that leads to the
[1:47:25] heart.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; God wants to be enthroned in our hearts.
[1:47:33] Hallelujah. Go to the next slide. Oh,
[1:47:36] you can join church.
[1:47:39] You Baptists, you Presbyterians, you
[1:47:41] message believers, and you Methodist and
[1:47:44] pilgrim holiness can come to
[1:47:46] sanctification. But you have to will to
[1:47:49] do God's will, self-will to let the Holy
[1:47:51] Spirit come in here to bring forth these
[1:47:55] signs. Shall follow them that believe in
[1:47:57] my name. They shall cast out devils.
[1:48:00] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[1:48:02] shall lay their hands on the sick or
[1:48:04] take up deadly things and so forth.
[1:48:06] These signs shall follow them that has
[1:48:09] let their will become my will
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; and the works that I do shall they do
[1:48:16] also. I hope you don't miss this.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; He says, I hope you don't miss it.
[1:48:21] There's a will to do God's will. You see
[1:48:24] what I mean?
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; He goes on, amen. Praise God. Go to the
[1:48:27] next slide. He says here now we're all
[1:48:30] born a free moral agent to make any
[1:48:33] decision that we wish to. God justly
[1:48:37] does that.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Because he must put every man on the
[1:48:42] same basis.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Listen, God don't God doesn't have
[1:48:46] clones.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; God wouldn't have been fair to just say,
[1:48:50] "I'm going to save this church and I'm
[1:48:51] going to I'm going to send this one to
[1:48:53] hell." That's not God.
[1:48:55] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:48:58] only he gave his only begotten son. He
[1:49:00] gave himself that whosoever would
[1:49:03] believe in him
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; should not see death but should receive
[1:49:07] life. Amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He doesn't he doesn't
[1:49:11] operate that way. But he had to put us
[1:49:13] on free moral agency on the same basis.
[1:49:16] And he put the wrong man on he put the
[1:49:18] first man on the wrong basis that he put
[1:49:21] on free moral agency. See, we're just
[1:49:24] exactly tonight like Adam and Eve.
[1:49:26] There's no difference. Right and wrong
[1:49:29] sets before either one of us.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Life and death. We can make a choice.
[1:49:35] It's up to you to make it. See, that's
[1:49:38] the way Adam and Eve did. And see, and
[1:49:41] they made the wrong choice. And now by
[1:49:45] that put the whole race of human race
[1:49:49] under death the penalty of death. Amen.
[1:49:54] Next slide. And then God came
[1:49:58] came down in the form of a man and took
[1:50:00] that death and paid the penalty of death
[1:50:04] that his subjects that desired to be
[1:50:07] free could go free. Now, if he took us
[1:50:11] without the same way that he did Adam
[1:50:13] and Eve, just pulled us through
[1:50:16] something, said, "I'll save you whether
[1:50:18] you want saved or not," then he put Adam
[1:50:21] and Eve on the wrong basis.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; No, sir. You see, but each one of us has
[1:50:28] to choose this day between death and
[1:50:31] life. We can do it as I just expressed.
[1:50:34] If your light will prove, if your life
[1:50:37] will prove exactly what side you're on,
[1:50:40] I don't care what side you say you're
[1:50:42] on. What you do every day proves what
[1:50:46] you are. You've heard the old saying,
[1:50:49] your life is so loud, I can't hear your
[1:50:53] testimony. See,
[1:50:55] your actions is so loud.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more.
[1:51:03] God wants, he doesn't want clones. He
[1:51:06] wants sons.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; He wants adopted sons of God that are
[1:51:10] going to manifest him.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; They're going to express his word. Amen.
[1:51:15] They're going to show that he is the
[1:51:17] living God. Amen. Praise God. Let the
[1:51:19] musicians come.
[1:51:23] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:51:27] Next week, we're going to be moving
[1:51:30] forward here.
[1:51:32] I'm going to read this
[1:51:34] one last quote here from brother
[1:51:37] Brandham.
[1:51:39] If you go to the next slide, adoption,
[1:51:42] he says, "In this promised land,
[1:51:45] everything belongs to us
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; as sons of God. Everything belongs to us
[1:51:51] in the promised land." See, brother
[1:51:53] Collins, see, everything is promised
[1:51:55] land. When Israel crossed over this
[1:51:58] Jordan into the promised land, fought
[1:52:00] down everything, you got to overcome all
[1:52:03] these these things that are trying to
[1:52:05] pull you to the wrong side, trying to
[1:52:07] pull you left, trying to pull you right,
[1:52:09] trying to pull you to believe this, try
[1:52:11] pull you to believe that. He says, "No,
[1:52:13] you have to fight." And you fought down
[1:52:15] everything. Now, remember this in this
[1:52:18] promised land, that don't mean that you
[1:52:20] are immune from sickness.
[1:52:24] That don't mean that you're immune from
[1:52:26] troubles,
[1:52:27] but it does spell this. Oh, let this
[1:52:30] sink deep. He says, it says this, it's
[1:52:34] yours.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Go rise up and take it.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're a son of God. God's given
[1:52:43] you the will, the ability, the free will
[1:52:47] to take this message, to take this word
[1:52:50] to to allow the Holy Spirit to place
[1:52:53] you, position you, use you. Amen. Don't
[1:52:57] you fear anything once you know you're
[1:52:59] in the promised land. God's given you
[1:53:01] everything in that promised land. You
[1:53:03] just walk with God. You fight. You fight
[1:53:06] the battles. You overcome what you need
[1:53:08] to overcome. And if you're doing it with
[1:53:10] a sincere heart, with a revelation of
[1:53:12] who you are, don't worry. God's got
[1:53:15] angels all around you, encamped about
[1:53:17] you. He's stoning the enemy. He's taking
[1:53:20] care of those things that you can't deal
[1:53:22] with. Don't you don't you worry about
[1:53:24] those things. You do your part. You let
[1:53:27] his will become your will. Amen. Praise
[1:53:30] God. So that you can overcome all the
[1:53:33] things. So, next week, I'm just going to
[1:53:35] give you a quick little uh uh scripture
[1:53:38] here on where we're going next week
[1:53:40] because this was just laying in more of
[1:53:42] a foundation about us coming into our
[1:53:45] positions, understanding our will, our
[1:53:47] our our position, our authority that God
[1:53:50] has given us as adopted sons and
[1:53:52] daughters of God. Amen. You need to know
[1:53:55] who you are. Amen. You need to know what
[1:53:57] you're what you're what you're to
[1:53:59] produce in this hour. Amen. And God's
[1:54:01] given us free moral agency. God's given
[1:54:03] us his character, his spirit, so that we
[1:54:06] will reflect him [music] in our lives.
[1:54:09] Amen. Glory to God. And if you read the
[1:54:12] next scripture here from Ephesians,
[1:54:16] go go back this week and read the book
[1:54:19] of Ephesians. Amen. But here, for this
[1:54:23] cause, Paul, I Paul, the prisoner of
[1:54:25] Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles, [music]
[1:54:28] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[1:54:30] the grace of God, which is given me to
[1:54:33] you [music] word, how that by revelation
[1:54:36] he made known unto me the mystery,
[1:54:41] the mystery,
[1:54:43] as I wrote a for in few words, [music]
[1:54:46] whereby when you read, you may
[1:54:48] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[1:54:50] of Christ. This is what we are feeding
[1:54:54] on. This is this is what we're uh
[1:54:56] bringing forth here through this whole
[1:54:58] entire series. [music]
[1:54:59] Amen. It's going to it's going to
[1:55:01] culminate whereby when you read and did
[1:55:04] you hear you s you heard what Paul said
[1:55:06] there? It comes by revelation. Paul's
[1:55:08] telling you this was not something that
[1:55:10] that that I had to you know uh be given
[1:55:13] you know to study all these manuals and
[1:55:16] listen to all these tapes and you know
[1:55:17] no this comes by revelation. And he says
[1:55:21] here, "Whereby when we read, when you
[1:55:23] read, you may understand my knowledge in
[1:55:26] the mystery of Christ." Amen. which in
[1:55:30] other ages was not made known unto the
[1:55:32] sons of men, as it is now revealed unto
[1:55:35] his holy apostles and prophets by the
[1:55:38] Spirit, that the Gentiles should be
[1:55:41] fellows of the same body, and partakers
[1:55:45] of the promise in Christ by the gospel,
[1:55:48] whereof I was made a minister according
[1:55:52] to the gift of the grace of God given
[1:55:55] unto me by the effectual working [music]
[1:55:57] power.
[1:55:59] working of his power.
[1:56:04] Next week, we're going to look deeper
[1:56:06] [music] into the fellowship of the
[1:56:08] mystery
[1:56:10] and how it is that [music] when we hear
[1:56:13] the word, when we read the word, when we
[1:56:15] listen to a preacher,
[1:56:17] you know, like brother Mike was saying
[1:56:19] earlier today, he was saying, I [music]
[1:56:20] listen to certain preachers, you know,
[1:56:22] you listen to a Pentecostal preacher,
[1:56:23] you know, sometimes you come across
[1:56:25] something and you just [music] you
[1:56:26] listen to it and nothing there's there's
[1:56:29] no stir. There's no there's no nothing
[1:56:31] that identifies. Why? Because the
[1:56:34] [music] part of the word that you are of
[1:56:37] the mystery of God, that element of the
[1:56:41] word that you are, [music] that
[1:56:42] attribute of God that you are
[1:56:44] manifesting in these last days is the
[1:56:48] word. You are the word. You are
[1:56:51] manifesting [music] what God wanted to
[1:56:53] bring to this generation in this hour.
[1:56:56] You're the ones that will fulfill the
[1:56:58] rapture. You're the ones that are going
[1:57:00] to fulfill the body change. You're the
[1:57:03] ones that have identified uh the the the
[1:57:05] the scriptures that have been fulfilled
[1:57:07] in your day. They're they're they're
[1:57:09] preaching on scriptures from a day gone
[1:57:12] by. They don't understand that that the
[1:57:14] the that the second coming of the Lord,
[1:57:16] they're they're still preaching the
[1:57:17] second coming of Christ. Meanwhile, he's
[1:57:20] already here.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; They don't realize the progression of
[1:57:24] the word and what God is doing in our
[1:57:25] day.
[1:57:27] But unto you, it has been
[1:57:29] like Jesus said to know the mysteries of
[1:57:32] the kingdom.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God forever more. Glory to
[1:57:37] God. Hallelujah.
[1:57:39] Hallelujah. I want Listen, I want my
[1:57:41] will to be completely surrendered to his
[1:57:44] will so that I can so I can feed on on
[1:57:47] on the mystery [music]
[1:57:48] of who I am, the mystery of who he is,
[1:57:52] the part of the word that I am to
[1:57:53] fulfill in my day. I want to know my
[1:57:55] part. I want to fulfill my part. I want
[1:57:58] to be in in perfect faith. I want to be
[1:58:00] walking with God. Amen. [music] Praise
[1:58:02] God. There's only one way that we can do
[1:58:04] that and that is that you got to sing
[1:58:07] that song. This is my desire. This is my
[1:58:10] desire.
[1:58:12] This is my desire
[1:58:18] to honor [music]
[1:58:22] you.

[2:05:30] after the service for those who are
[2:05:31] Taipean members, we'll have the general
[2:05:33] meeting and there's going to be some
[2:05:35] good stuff in there. [music]
[2:05:37] Um
[2:05:39] stuff maybe you never heard, but [music]
[2:05:42] it's good stuff. So, please be here for
[2:05:45] that. I don't know if we're going to
[2:05:46] have uh some coffee or something
[2:05:48] afterwards just [music]
[2:05:50] between the break maybe. Um but as of uh
[2:05:55] have you seen that email? As of
[2:05:56] tomorrow, our parking lot will be uh uh
[2:05:59] used by the city of Burlington. Okay.
[2:06:01] For the next [music] few months from
[2:06:03] Monday to Friday, uh from 6:00 in the
[2:06:05] morning to 6:00 at night. So if you do
[2:06:07] happen to go by and you see that the
[2:06:08] parking lot is completely full, it's the
[2:06:11] workers who are working down the [music]
[2:06:12] street, right? and they they've needed a
[2:06:15] place to park. So, we're glad that uh
[2:06:17] they chose us. I don't know why they
[2:06:18] skipped the church down the road there.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [music]
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; They can't rate to us. They're paying
[2:06:25] for it. So, praise the Lord for that.
[2:06:28] Amen.
[2:06:30] [music]
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you. Let's stand.
[2:06:32] And uh was the word good this morning?
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; God bless [music] Pastor Danny for uh
[2:06:39] being a vessel in the house of the Lord.
[2:06:42] We are the sons of God.
[2:06:45] Oh, [music] we are [singing] the sons of
[2:06:48] God.
[2:06:49] We have washed our robes in the blood of
