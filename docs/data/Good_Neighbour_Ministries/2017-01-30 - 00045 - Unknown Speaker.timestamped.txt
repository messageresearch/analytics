[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] Yes,
[0:00] it was in his dedication. It was in his
[0:02] mind.
[0:04] The very interpretations of the
[0:06] scriptures bring every thought captive
[0:08] to the word of God. I see that.
[0:11] That's true.
[0:12] You don't believe it. I believe it.
[0:15] You want to justify the way, excuse it
[0:18] away.
[0:20] It's sin. No matter which way you look
[0:22] at it, you want to use your excuse, oh,
[0:25] I'm I'm this way. I'm I don't care which
[0:28] way you are.
[0:30] I don't care what you've gone through. I
[0:33] know what God is.
[0:35] Then you're you're you're denying the
[0:37] blood of Jesus Christ.
[0:39] The blood, let me put it this way. The
[0:41] blood of Jesus Christ
[0:44] can overcome
[0:46] can bring under subjection
[0:48] could change
[0:51] anything.
[0:52] All things are possible
[0:55] to them that believe.
[0:57] Amen.
[0:59] lay it down this morning and see what
[1:01] God will do. Not I can't do nothing but
[1:03] see what God will do.
[1:05] If you bring your faith to a place that
[1:09] all things are possible,
[1:11] get the fear, get the doubt,
[1:15] get the circumstance, get things that
[1:17] were sown in your mind, things that were
[1:19] spoken to you out of you that are
[1:22] contrary to the word of God.
[1:25] [Music]
[1:27] and stand with God alone.
[1:29] Stand with your faith. Stand in the
[1:32] spirit.
[1:33] Amen.
[1:34] And watch. Speak the word. Then you'll
[1:36] see.
[1:37] The problem is we're sitting here with a
[1:39] lot of doubt, a lot of unbelief, and
[1:41] we're trying to claim this and claim
[1:43] that. Claim this change and that change.
[1:47] We can't do that.
[1:49] We got to clear up the channel.
[1:52] We got to burn it up.
[1:58] And that's the danger.
[2:02] That's the danger that we live in today.
[2:05] That's the danger that is here this
[2:06] morning.
[2:12] Now, Satan's trying to do
[2:15] lukewarmness, cold, horrible, powerless.
[2:20] But you feel fine, right? You feel
[2:23] religious. But you know in your heart,
[2:27] you know you're not living right.
[2:29] You know that you and God are not close.
[2:32] You know your relationship is not where
[2:34] it's supposed to be
[2:35] because why? He left them behind.
[2:38] He asked you to walk with him. He asked
[2:41] you to go that step.
[2:43] He asked you to overcome and deal with
[2:45] an issue in your life and you're left
[2:47] right there. and you walk and sometimes
[2:51] you walk for years and years and years
[2:54] and he's standing right there.
[2:57] No matter what your interpretation, how
[3:00] you justify your walk, no matter what.
[3:03] And the deceiving part about it is God
[3:06] always honors faith and honors his word.
[3:08] Amen.
[3:08] And what deceives the people that God
[3:11] can be still doing other things in their
[3:13] lives,
[3:14] especially if you have a ministry and
[3:16] you preach the word or you have a gift,
[3:20] God can still use that for people.
[3:22] Amen.
[3:23] Because this is not for me. This is for
[3:24] you.
[3:25] Amen.
[3:26] Not for me.
[3:28] But you know in your heart,
[3:31] you know in your heart that you're not
[3:34] walking close to him.
[3:38] You're not totally obeying his voice.
[3:42] It's not my voice.
[3:45] You're going to walk away from me today.
[3:46] I won't see you. You go to your own
[3:48] homes. It's not me that convicts you.
[3:51] It's not me that you're not close to
[3:54] in a relationship. It's him.
[3:57] Amen.
[4:00] He's speaking to somebody.
[4:04] He's already spoke to me.
[4:07] I'm preaching my life.
[4:11] And if it's in the spirit of God, if
[4:13] it's in the word of God, then it's your
[4:15] life.
[4:16] Amen. if you're there too.
[4:26] The book of Revelation, the revelation
[4:28] of Jesus Christ
[4:31] uncovered,
[4:33] unrevealing
[4:36] what was once previously hidden.
[4:40] The revelation of the future worse in
[4:42] his upcoming seven church ages. The
[4:45] importance of revelation by the spirit
[4:48] to a true believer can never be
[4:50] overemphasized.
[4:52] Revelation means more to you than
[4:55] perhaps you realize this morning.
[4:58] I am not talking about the book of
[5:00] revelation. I'm talking about all
[5:03] revelation.
[5:07] Do you remember in Matthew
[5:10] what he said?
[5:12] We just went through that.
[5:16] Upon this rock will I build my church
[5:20] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[5:22] against it.
[5:26] You see
[5:28] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[5:30] against it. So where are we standing?
[5:33] Where am I standing? Where you standing
[5:34] in your walks?
[5:37] Are the gates of hell at your doorstep?
[5:42] Are you still in prison in some area of
[5:45] your mind, your heart,
[5:48] your habits?
[5:50] Is there still chains around your life?
[5:55] But the gates of hell
[5:57] will not prevail
[6:00] against the revelation.
[6:02] God.
[6:04] You say, "Brother, well, I need the
[6:06] revelation."
[6:12] Faith comes by hearing and hearing the
[6:15] word of God.
[6:17] You see, every time that the word of God
[6:19] is being preached,
[6:22] I'm just going to speak plain.
[6:26] And something struck your heart.
[6:29] Something opened up to you. A passageway
[6:32] opened up to you. A change opened up to
[6:34] you. A new direction opened up to you.
[6:39] Something was revealed to you to do the
[6:41] opposite of what you were doing. Think
[6:43] the opposite of the way you were
[6:44] thinking.
[6:46] You see, faith come by hearing the word
[6:49] of God.
[6:49] Amen.
[6:50] But you got to take that word. You got
[6:53] to take what's being spoken to you and
[6:55] open up to you and make that change.
[6:58] You might have resistance and you will
[7:01] because especially if it's a demon
[7:02] there, I've been through it. It'll fight
[7:04] you.
[7:07] But like when I was going through my
[7:10] experience with the pills that I was
[7:12] being delivered from back then that the
[7:13] doctor said I'll never be off of,
[7:17] God gave me faith. He said, "It's
[7:19] finished." He might speak something so
[7:21] simple to you. It's finished.
[7:23] It's over.
[7:24] It's done.
[7:25] These task masters will see them no
[7:27] more.
[7:29] Walk out. Step out. Believe that.
[7:32] Believe that.
[7:34] Amen.
[7:37] Really believe that.
[7:40] In your life.
[7:42] Really take the word of God
[7:44] and realize it's God speaking to you.
[7:47] Believe that.
[7:48] And no matter what battle, what
[7:50] challenges That's right.
[7:52] I thought I was going to die after I
[7:53] threw those pills away and Satan said,
[7:55] "I'm coming after you. I don't care. I
[7:59] don't care if it took me to my grave."
[8:03] I said, "I believe in the word of God.
[8:05] I'd rather die."
[8:06] Yeah.
[8:08] In any circumstance
[8:11] and situation, believe in God's word.
[8:15] Then doubt it and move away from it.
[8:21] and walk away from the truth that's
[8:22] being revealed.
[8:26] Just like they said in the fiery
[8:28] furnace, our God is able to deliver us.
[8:31] Even so,
[8:35] we will not bow.
[8:39] Hallelujah.
[8:40] This bride will not bow
[8:44] to the devil.
[8:45] He's defeated.
[8:48] [Applause]
[8:58] He's defeated.
[9:00] Our Jesus Christ
[9:04] gave us the victory.
[9:06] What do you see when you see the cross?
[9:11] I see victory. Amen.
[9:15] Not only in some areas of my life, but
[9:19] every area that God places me in and
[9:22] moves me forward. Every challenge that
[9:25] he places before me, every test that
[9:27] comes my way.
[9:29] The only trouble I have in a test or a
[9:32] trial is to get this thing right, the
[9:37] turbulence of this thing under
[9:39] subjection.
[9:40] Amen. Once this gets under suggestion,
[9:43] then I can yield to the faith, to the
[9:45] victory,
[9:47] that God has given us.
[9:48] Amen.
[9:49] Amen.
[9:52] Hallelujah.
[9:56] There's your faith. Faith comes by
[9:58] hearing. And the gates of hell will not
[10:01] prevail.
[10:03] Some of you could be breaking out of
[10:04] chains,
[10:06] breaking out of prison doors
[10:10] this morning.
[10:13] It's up to you.
[10:17] The word of God says that.
[10:21] Hallelujah.
[10:24] Just like with Abel,
[10:27] he gave the proper sacrifice. It was
[10:29] blood.
[10:31] It was the life
[10:33] that was released to us. You see, you're
[10:36] looking at yourself.
[10:38] We're always looking at ourselves, our
[10:40] own abilities, and what we can do. It's
[10:42] not us. When we believe that word that's
[10:46] being revealed to us, do you know what
[10:48] you're doing when you receive that? You
[10:50] say, "I believe this over this.
[10:53] I believe this over every one of my
[10:54] circumstances, my situations, my home,
[10:57] my kids, my this. I believe this.
[11:00] Amen.
[11:01] What God said.
[11:02] Thank you, Lord.
[11:02] I believe my inheritance.
[11:04] Yes, Lord.
[11:05] Thank you, Jesus.
[11:06] Amen.
[11:07] Amen.
[11:08] What are you saying?
[11:10] You're believing in the blood. What's
[11:12] the blood? It's not the chemical blood.
[11:15] It's the life.
[11:17] Amen.
[11:18] And if you see that life,
[11:22] who is Christ to you?
[11:25] Who is that life to you? That's what it
[11:27] comes down to.
[11:31] Can anything defeat
[11:34] that life?
[11:35] No.
[11:35] Is anything stronger than God?
[11:39] Anything greater than God?
[11:44] But think,
[11:46] think this morning. Then what are you
[11:49] doing? What are you doing in your life
[11:52] then
[11:55] when you walk away from faith?
[11:58] when you walk away from the test, the
[12:00] the trial, the challenge, the thing that
[12:03] you're walking away from, and you don't
[12:04] believe God's word, because when you
[12:06] walk away from it, any challenge that
[12:08] comes your way,
[12:10] you're walking away from the word.
[12:14] Then you're saying
[12:16] that that blood,
[12:19] that life is not great enough for you.
[12:23] And you know what? You'll stay in the
[12:26] bondage. You'll stay in your chain.
[12:28] You'll stay in that condition because
[12:30] there is no other life until you come
[12:32] back to it.
[12:33] There's no other life.
[12:35] That's right.
[12:36] That can defeat
[12:38] that that you need defeated in your life
[12:41] but the blood of Jesus Christ.
[12:43] So, one way or another, you're going to
[12:45] have to come right back to it.
[12:48] Amen.
[12:50] right back to believing the word of God
[12:53] that was spoken to you in your
[12:55] situation, in your life, in your
[12:58] condition,
[13:00] because God wants to see you, not him.
[13:03] He's already displayed it.
[13:05] Right?
[13:06] He already conquered.
[13:08] It's finished. It's done.
[13:10] Amen.
[13:11] Now you finish it in your life.
[13:16] You declare it done. Amen.
[13:20] You say change come forth.
[13:23] You break the chains.
[13:25] You open the doors.
[13:27] You speak that word and go forth.
[13:31] Amen.
[13:37] Hallelujah.
[13:38] Amen.
[13:40] Contending for the faith.
[13:44] We see the churches out there.
[13:47] They talk about it,
[13:51] but unless you're born again of the word
[13:53] of God
[13:56] and see, it's not in your heart.
[14:01] You see, Hebrews 11:6, I'm just skipping
[14:04] over things. Without faith is impossible
[14:07] to please him.
[14:09] He that cometh to God, and I I hope
[14:13] you're coming to God this morning, must
[14:15] believe that he is a rewarder of them
[14:19] that seek him diligently.
[14:21] Thank you, Jesus.
[14:22] No man is justified in the law, by the
[14:25] law, in the sight of God. It's evident,
[14:30] is certain
[14:32] that the just shall live by faith.
[14:35] Amen.
[14:37] The just so earnestly contend
[14:41] for the faith.
[14:44] Hallelujah.
[14:46] That was once delivered
[14:51] not only on paper by the prophet but was
[14:54] once delivered through a life
[14:57] that was lived an overcoming life that
[15:00] was lived and waved before the people
[15:04] waved before the church.
[15:08] The first fruit has already gone before
[15:11] and have been waved before us. Saints.
[15:14] Amen.
[15:16] Where are we? Are we still seeing the
[15:19] way she weighed before us? The word the
[15:23] life.
[15:33] What's the preeminence more in the
[15:34] church of God? You see, there will be a
[15:37] bride.
[15:39] She will manifest his word.
[15:41] Yes.
[15:41] Why? Because I say so or any other
[15:43] minister says so. No, because God says
[15:46] so.
[15:46] Amen.
[15:47] God determined
[15:49] that he's going to have a ride.
[15:51] Brother says, I don't know who it is
[15:53] where, but there will be a ride.
[15:59] that will live what I'm speaking about
[16:03] the word of God.
[16:07] Yes, it may look see the danger. It may
[16:11] look Don't tell me that you don't feel.
[16:14] Don't tell me that you don't feel. The
[16:15] lady will see it. Don't tell me that you
[16:19] don't see lies that are not lining up
[16:22] with what I'm talking about this
[16:23] morning.
[16:26] We're around each other. There's lives
[16:28] that are are are are moving and and and
[16:31] doing certain things and it's all around
[16:33] us. And we get we get complacency.
[16:39] We get complacency at work
[16:42] even amongst what we call believers.
[16:45] Believers.
[16:47] Here we are. We're in a church. We're
[16:48] all believers,
[16:51] right? We're all claiming the same
[16:52] thing.
[16:55] and and we look at one another's lives
[16:57] and we take this. We're not supposed to
[16:59] take anything off any one of us. We're
[17:02] supposed to take the word of God
[17:04] that's being revealed to us.
[17:06] God convicts my heart. He convicts and
[17:09] deals with my life in a different way
[17:11] that he doesn't deal with your life.
[17:14] Amen.
[17:15] Yes.
[17:16] And we're not supposed to take it any
[17:18] any one of our lives or any one of our
[17:20] our situations. We're supposed to take
[17:22] way God deals with us.
[17:25] Amen. And we we start looking at one
[17:27] another. We start looking at one
[17:29] another's lives and we start comparing
[17:31] which the Bible says is carnal. This
[17:34] goes on. And not realizing
[17:38] not realizing that we're all at
[17:40] different stages of our walk. That is
[17:42] true. But realizing there's three types
[17:44] of believer in every church. I hope I'm
[17:47] looking at every believer. Everybody's a
[17:49] believer,
[17:51] right?
[17:52] But there's three different types of
[17:54] believer.
[17:55] God is speaking to individuals. God is
[17:58] dealing with individuals.
[17:59] Amen.
[17:59] It's not making this a group thing.
[18:02] This is an individual thing.
[18:05] Stop placing your faith in people and
[18:08] personalities and and other other
[18:11] people's walks.
[18:13] This is an individual affair. This is
[18:16] between you and him. Amen.
[18:18] You're not going to get anywhere until
[18:20] that relationship becomes personal
[18:22] between you and him
[18:24] until you start obeying him
[18:27] and what he's speaking to you and live
[18:29] the way he's telling you to live.
[18:31] Oh, this person is living that way. Look
[18:33] at all the young people. The young
[18:35] people are doing this and doing that. It
[18:37] doesn't mean nothing to you if God's
[18:38] speaking to you to separate yourself. If
[18:41] God is telling you and calling you out
[18:43] like he did Mary,
[18:46] Mary was young.
[18:48] She brought and received the word. She
[18:51] accepted the word. Amen. She consecrated
[18:54] her life to that word that was spoken by
[18:57] the angel, the spoken word. What does it
[19:00] have to do with you and what everybody
[19:02] else is doing? It doesn't matter what
[19:04] anybody else is doing.
[19:05] It's what God is doing in your life.
[19:07] Amen.
[19:08] It's a God speaking to God.
[19:11] And if he's dealing with you in a
[19:13] certain way, you ain't getting away from
[19:15] it. You could try to be like the other
[19:17] person. You could try to do what the
[19:18] other person's doing. But if God is a
[19:20] call of your life and God is speaking to
[19:23] you, you ain't going nowhere until you
[19:25] answer that call.
[19:27] Amen.
[19:28] Hallelujah.
[19:30] Same with every single one of us. You
[19:32] ain't going anywhere. You ain't moving
[19:34] ahead until you take that step that God
[19:37] want you to take.
[19:38] Amen.
[19:39] Amen.
[19:39] Thank you, Lord.
[19:40] He's dealing with you to overcome fear,
[19:43] overcome doubt.
[19:45] No matter what it is, lust, no matter
[19:47] what it is in your life,
[19:50] you got to deal with that.
[19:54] You got to bring that under subjection
[19:56] to the blood. You got to take your
[19:58] faith.
[19:59] It's you and God alone.
[20:01] Amen. Nobody else is going to help you
[20:05] overcome what you need to overcome.
[20:08] Don't look out there. Don't look for
[20:11] help anywhere. You got your help.
[20:14] Yes.
[20:14] Is Jesus Christ is the word.
[20:18] Jesus.
[20:20] Well, that's the problem.
[20:22] the lady I'll see in spirit the
[20:25] lukewarmness Satan moving and operating
[20:28] trying to make the church cold and
[20:30] formulous.
[20:31] Amen.
[20:34] It's happened to me, saints. And if I
[20:37] don't shake myself, God is going to
[20:38] shake me
[20:39] because my faith has got to a place with
[20:42] the Lord. I know I'm elected. I know I'm
[20:45] called. Why? Because I say so? Because
[20:48] I'm convinced enough about how much I
[20:50] read? No, no. If it was up to me, I
[20:54] would not be in this church this
[20:56] morning.
[20:57] Amen.
[20:58] It's not up to me.
[21:03] You only know this statement. Understand
[21:05] this if you've been through it. I would
[21:07] not be here this morning.
[21:10] But it's never up to us.
[21:12] It's him that says
[21:16] it's him that says that you're my
[21:18] beloved.
[21:19] Amen. It's him that will let me go.
[21:22] Amen.
[21:23] Hallelujah.
[21:24] Thank you, Lord.
[21:24] It's him, Jesus.
[21:26] That brings me back.
[21:27] It's him that raises me up.
[21:30] It's him that keeps me.
[21:34] That is all good.
[21:35] But it's now time for me to take what
[21:39] he's doing for me and believe it.
[21:42] That's right.
[21:43] And take this word that he's placed in
[21:45] my life and live it.
[21:47] Hallelujah. It doesn't just stop there.
[21:50] What he's doing for me,
[21:51] he did it. And what he's doing for me is
[21:53] so that I can do this.
[21:59] I know there's somebody understanding
[22:00] what I'm saying.
[22:02] There's somebody
[22:04] because I'm all over the place here.
[22:08] So, if I look like I'm I'm not even on
[22:10] my notes, but
[22:12] Hallelujah. Amen.
[22:16] Let us take a look
[22:18] at what real faith is quickly in this
[22:21] hour.
[22:27] Hallelujah.
[22:28] Because without it, it's impossible to
[22:30] please God.
[22:32] Accept him by faith. He that cometh to
[22:34] God must believe God. And faith comes by
[22:37] hearing the word. You must first believe
[22:39] the word of God. Amen. Just take the
[22:41] word, the message for what it says and
[22:44] everything else contrary is not right.
[22:47] Abraham had to believe just what the
[22:50] still small voice told him. And when he
[22:53] was 100 years old, 25 years later, I
[22:57] love Abraham.
[22:59] Hallelujah.
[23:01] I love Abraham.
[23:03] Wow. This is 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 years
[23:07] ago. My Abraham is just as real to me
[23:10] this morning.
[23:11] Hallelujah.
[23:13] I think he might be walking up and down
[23:14] the aisles here.
[23:16] Amen.
[23:17] Amen. Bless you. Bless you so much. He
[23:21] was stronger believing that he was he
[23:24] was 25 years ago than it was 25 years
[23:27] ago when it was given to him. He
[23:29] staggered not at the promises of God
[23:31] through unbelief, but was strong giving
[23:34] praise to God, knowing that he was able.
[23:39] Yes.
[23:40] Hallelujah.
[23:43] Are you are you are you say me? Say me.
[23:46] This is when I read this. Say me.
[23:48] Me. This is me.
[23:51] Me in my situation.
[23:52] Me in my trial.
[23:55] Me in the dark times that I'm going
[23:56] through. Whatever it is that changed,
[23:59] it's me.
[24:01] He staggered not through unbelief,
[24:05] but was strong giving praise to God
[24:07] knowing that he was able to perform what
[24:10] he had promised.
[24:14] That is it. We have to believe that God
[24:17] is able in this day, in this age, that
[24:19] he's able to bring a bride
[24:23] and perform
[24:24] what he did in the way she did brother's
[24:27] life with your life.
[24:29] He can perform that.
[24:31] He can perform that.
[24:33] Yes.
[24:33] He can get that life of Jesus Christ and
[24:36] manifest it in you.
[24:37] That's right. Whatever that you're
[24:39] facing, whatever that's holding you
[24:41] back, there is something in your life
[24:43] that's holding you back. There is
[24:45] something with you that causes doubt and
[24:48] unbelief.
[24:49] And the way that you struggle, the way
[24:51] that you are, that's holding you back.
[24:54] God knows it.
[24:58] God knows it this morning. And he's
[25:00] trying to say that I am able to perform.
[25:04] That's right. Amen.
[25:06] I'm able to perform this word.
[25:09] I brought you to this word.
[25:12] I called you up to this word.
[25:16] I will perform this word inside of your
[25:19] life.
[25:21] I will give you every victory that you
[25:24] have need of.
[25:27] I have set you free
[25:29] from what you need to be set free from.
[25:36] [Applause]
[25:39] Hallelujah.
[25:44] You must come with that unfailing faith.
[25:47] Believe in God that made the promise.
[25:51] Amen. Notice it's something that you
[25:54] possess.
[25:56] It's not an imagination.
[25:58] It's really real to you. You really have
[26:01] it.
[26:03] Jesus.
[26:04] Hallelujah.
[26:06] It is real.
[26:08] It's like you're riding in your
[26:10] automobile.
[26:11] It's just as real to you as you're
[26:13] sitting in the church this morning.
[26:16] It's just as real as you're hearing my
[26:17] voice. It's a substance. It's not an
[26:21] imagination. It's not an emotion. It's
[26:24] something that you have.
[26:27] It comes to you by hearing the word of
[26:29] God. And that alone your faith
[26:33] that it is not in some individual, it is
[26:36] not in a man. It's not in an
[26:38] organization. It's not in the church.
[26:40] It's not in the message. It's not in a
[26:42] group of people. It's in God.
[26:46] Because God is his word. And faith is in
[26:49] God and his word.
[26:53] Hallelujah.
[26:54] Jesus.
[26:55] Hallelujah. Amen.
[26:57] That's where it's at this morning with
[26:59] you. That's where it stands at your door
[27:02] this morning.
[27:03] The word of God stands at your door.
[27:06] He knocks. He knocks.
[27:09] Amen.
[27:09] I stand at the door and knock. If any
[27:12] man hear my voice and open that door,
[27:16] just open that door. Amen.
[27:19] I know what I'm talking about this
[27:20] morning. You might think I'm crazy, but
[27:23] I know what I'm talking about. under
[27:25] this anointing. Open that door.
[27:30] He is knocking this morning.
[27:33] He'll take you through. He'll walk step
[27:36] by step. He will not leave you. That's
[27:40] right.
[27:43] That's the fear and the threat that
[27:45] Satan's putting on you.
[27:47] That if you take a step, he'll be there.
[27:51] Amen. like he was throughout the word.
[27:53] The word is the truth.
[27:55] Amen.
[27:55] He was in the fiery furnace. He was in
[27:57] the lion's nest. He was with Moses
[27:59] crossing the Red Sea.
[28:01] Are they our stories?
[28:03] He's there.
[28:05] He's there.
[28:07] He's here.
[28:09] He's with you.
[28:11] That's right.
[28:12] What good is it if we we come to church,
[28:14] we practice church, and we have great
[28:16] servants where there's no life.
[28:18] Yes.
[28:19] There's no anointing. to no
[28:21] consecration.
[28:23] Who gets worshiped them? Who gets
[28:25] praised them?
[28:27] Just like Satan's doing in all the
[28:28] churches.
[28:29] But when he has the preeminence through
[28:31] faith by you taking faith and believing
[28:33] God and trying him, telling him it
[28:43] crazy,
[28:46] you got through here.
[28:49] Don't tell me you believe
[28:51] and you can step out
[28:53] when God speaks to you. Don't tell me
[28:54] you believe.
[28:56] Thank you, Jesus.
[28:57] Yes, sir.
[28:58] You believe this word and step out on it
[29:00] when it speaks to you.
[29:01] Amen. Yes, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[29:08] This ain't imagination.
[29:10] This ain't emotion. This ain't feelings.
[29:13] This is real.
[29:14] Amen.
[29:14] This is real.
[29:15] Yes.
[29:17] Hallelujah.
[29:19] Many people say they have faith and then
[29:21] tomorrow. Where is it?
[29:25] Where is he?
[29:26] Amen.
[29:26] Not the bride.
[29:28] Not the bride.
[29:33] But when God wants anchors
[29:35] and you see it,
[29:38] that's the worst mistake that you can
[29:40] make is walk away from it. When God
[29:42] anchors it and you see it,
[29:47] you say, "Brother Tim, if God anchors it
[29:50] and I see it, I'm I hope you do.
[29:54] I hope you do.
[29:57] There's nothing going to ever take it
[30:01] and make it move from you." That's the
[30:04] truth. That's the truth. That's why the
[30:07] people are shipwrecked. Even in the
[30:09] message, they're shipwrecked.
[30:11] prayer after prayer after prayer. If you
[30:13] got perfect faith, I just go back to the
[30:16] messages and read it. You got perfect
[30:18] faith
[30:19] in your situation. Well, you pray until
[30:21] you do.
[30:24] You won't need to come into a prayer
[30:25] room.
[30:28] Well, the Bible said, "No, no. I know
[30:30] what the Bible said about lay hands upon
[30:31] the sick and they shall recover." I know
[30:34] what it says. But if you've got perfect
[30:36] faith and you seek God for your healing
[30:40] and you're believing God, problem is
[30:42] you're not believing God. He said, "By
[30:45] my stripes you are healed." And that's
[30:47] your problem. That's why you're not
[30:49] getting healed
[30:51] because it's by his stripes that you are
[30:53] healed. That's that takes you to believe
[30:55] that.
[30:56] And you want to come up here in a prayer
[30:58] line and think some man is you see
[31:01] there's nothing wrong with the man. I
[31:03] can believe. I can believe. Right. But
[31:08] you don't come up here and get prayed
[31:10] for if you don't believe. That's right.
[31:13] And that's the problem. Many people are
[31:14] coming up the prayer lines and they
[31:16] really don't believe what they're asking
[31:18] for. They really don't believe that God
[31:20] is able to do what they need to be done
[31:23] in their lives. They really don't
[31:25] believe that word. It's not really
[31:27] revealed to them. Brother Bram says,
[31:29] "Don't come up to the prayer line. Stop
[31:32] coming up. Every minister that comes
[31:33] through the church, the same people come
[31:35] up over and over and over.
[31:39] I know it sounds hard,
[31:42] but what is the problem?
[31:45] The problem is that you're not seeking
[31:47] God and believing God for faith.
[31:49] I want to see you healed.
[31:51] I want to see you delivered.
[31:54] But there's a channel. There's a way to
[31:56] get that.
[31:57] And you're not doing it. You're not
[31:59] following that way.
[32:02] And it's always been by believing what
[32:05] he said.
[32:06] It's believing in the finished work that
[32:09] you got to believe it.
[32:12] You know, look at all this man is the
[32:15] hands like my hands. What? What are
[32:17] hands? Nothing. Nothing.
[32:21] But if there's faith and there's faith
[32:25] and faith comes here then see these
[32:27] hands. Faith is connecting to him,
[32:32] the finished work.
[32:33] Amen. And and and it's like if you have
[32:36] a line and there's a thunderstorm and
[32:38] and the lightning hits that line, it's
[32:39] going to come down that line and go
[32:41] right to the end. That's what happens.
[32:45] And we're sitting here with the word of
[32:47] God for this hour. We're sitting here
[32:50] with the greatest message that ever
[32:53] struck the earth.
[32:56] Think about it. And this is what I think
[32:58] to myself, too.
[33:00] Amen. If I'm preaching only to myself,
[33:03] that's fine.
[33:05] But I know I'm not.
[33:06] That's right.
[33:06] We're sitting here with the greatest
[33:08] thing that ever struck the earth.
[33:10] Yes.
[33:11] Amen.
[33:12] We sing about it.
[33:13] Yes.
[33:14] That's why Brother Mike has a hard time
[33:15] getting you to rejoice and praise God.
[33:18] Amen. Cuz if you're really singing about
[33:21] Amen. the victory about what we got.
[33:25] Amen. What has been released to us? The
[33:27] mercy and grace that called us out in
[33:30] the Hallelujah.
[33:34] Thank you.
[33:35] It's become common. It's become normal,
[33:37] lukewarm. Satan is just pulling the
[33:40] wolves over everybody. But the Lord is
[33:42] saying to the bride of Jesus Christ,
[33:45] contempt,
[33:46] earnestly, sincerely, contempt for that
[33:50] faith
[33:51] that I placed in your heart
[33:54] this morning.
[33:55] I'm released. I've done something.
[33:58] Contempt for it.
[33:59] The angel said to brother Brandham, "Be
[34:02] more sincere." The angel said to brother
[34:04] Brandham, "Be more sincere."
[34:07] The angel saying this morning to you,
[34:10] whoever you are, be more sincere.
[34:15] Jesus.
[34:16] I'm not here to dictate how sincere you
[34:19] should be, what you should be doing. I'm
[34:21] not proclaiming that this morning. Amen.
[34:23] But you know,
[34:25] Amen.
[34:26] You know,
[34:29] be more sincere.
[34:33] I'm going to wind it down. I'm going to
[34:34] take a couple more minutes.
[34:39] Hallelujah.
[34:42] There's so much I can say.
[34:47] Unless we were in Africa or Trinidad or
[34:49] something like that, I have the time. I
[34:52] I don't know if I have the energy.
[34:59] If you could just wake up
[35:02] to that a minute.
[35:05] You see the word itself identified him
[35:10] who he was.
[35:12] It said who can condemn me of sin?
[35:16] In other words, who can show me that my
[35:19] life and my works don't fulfill exactly
[35:22] what Messiah should do?
[35:27] You know, when you're walking with God
[35:30] and you're obeying what God has
[35:32] revealed, your position, your portion
[35:35] that God is all you, that's all you can
[35:37] do. You can't that's why he says, "Stand
[35:38] look at one another. You can't live the
[35:41] way I live. I can't live the way brother
[35:42] Danny lives, brother Chris. I can only
[35:44] live the way I live. They can only live
[35:46] the way they live. You can only live the
[35:48] way that you live.
[35:51] And the way God has called you to
[35:52] consecrate your life
[36:00] to get to that place since
[36:03] that these words become your words
[36:05] becomes your life.
[36:08] Why? You always look at it and you
[36:09] always brush it away. I've been there. I
[36:12] know what I'm talking about. You don't
[36:14] have to listen to me if you don't want
[36:16] to. But I've been there. You just brush
[36:18] it away. That's Jesus. That's you.
[36:23] That's you. You see, sin is still
[36:25] condemning you,
[36:28] right? Because you're not doing what God
[36:30] tells you to do.
[36:31] Amen.
[36:31] That's why he's condemning you.
[36:33] Yes.
[36:34] Simple. I gave you the answer. Somebody.
[36:38] [Music]
[36:41] But he said, "Who can show me and my
[36:43] life and my works?"
[36:48] Then I'm not doing what Messiah is
[36:49] supposed to be doing. Are you doing what
[36:51] a Christian should be doing, a believer
[36:52] should be doing? Are you living that
[36:54] kind of consecrated life like we're
[36:55] talking about this morning? I didn't go
[36:57] in this direction. I had no idea. This
[36:59] is just him taking me over. Are you
[37:02] living that? You see, but when you are,
[37:06] and if you've been there, and if you're
[37:08] not there this morning to get back
[37:09] there, if you've been there,
[37:12] Because there's a consecration that God
[37:14] has called you to. And there's a purpose
[37:17] behind every consecrated life. It's to
[37:19] bring forth the word of God. Is to take
[37:22] condemnation away from you, take guilt
[37:24] away from you, take fear away from you,
[37:26] bring you peace, bring you love that
[37:28] you're looking for, joy, bring you
[37:30] healing. Aaron's rod budded. Kingdom
[37:34] life in God's presence. Consecration
[37:36] brings God's presence around your life.
[37:38] It brings all the blessings. Seek first
[37:41] the kingdom of God and supernaturally I
[37:44] will add all things onto you.
[37:46] Amen.
[37:46] When you move with God. When brother
[37:49] Brad was walking in the in in a forest
[37:51] and he he he went over a rock and he
[37:53] looked he looked at his wife and his
[37:55] wife was young. He looked at himself. He
[37:57] was young. He goes, "Oh yes, I'm walking
[38:00] with the king."
[38:02] That's why.
[38:03] It's not because of us. It's because
[38:05] he's here. Amen.
[38:07] It's because he's welcome
[38:09] in your life.
[38:11] We sing the song, welcome, Holy Spirit.
[38:14] Welcome, Holy Spirit. Welcome, Holy
[38:17] Spirit.
[38:20] Hallelujah.
[38:25] Yes.
[38:27] Amen.
[38:31] Nobody
[38:32] can look at the Lord
[38:35] and said, "I ain't doing anything
[38:39] that has spoken."
[38:42] I want to say for myself,
[38:46] no matter how crazy you might seem this
[38:48] age, because when you throw out
[38:50] statements like this, it's totally
[38:52] contrary. And it's starting to come, the
[38:54] atmosphere is starting to come totally
[38:56] contrary to the message.
[38:58] People are starting to believe they can
[39:00] do whatever they want to do. The Bible
[39:02] said in the last days, people will do
[39:05] what they feel is right in their own
[39:06] eyes.
[39:07] What their emotions feel is right.
[39:11] What their feelings is right.
[39:13] Wow.
[39:15] Oh, they're starting to move and that
[39:16] that that that it's all starting to
[39:18] creep in. Brother gets in place just
[39:21] before the message denominates or tries
[39:24] to denominate. So, there's going to be a
[39:26] force. There's going to be a pressure of
[39:29] denominational spirit. And what is a
[39:31] denominational spirit? They don't want
[39:32] to be led by the spirit of God.
[39:34] Amen.
[39:35] They don't want to be possessed by the
[39:37] spirit of God. They don't want to be
[39:39] controlled by his word
[39:41] in their lives. They don't want to yield
[39:44] the surrender.
[39:46] It's going to come to that place. But
[39:48] the bride,
[39:50] Amen. That pressure that's around the
[39:53] bride right now is going to bring her
[39:55] into that place
[39:57] in her walk and her concentration that's
[40:00] going to squeeze her out of here. I know
[40:02] for me this morning it's driving me. I
[40:05] see the coldness. I see the
[40:07] lukewarmness.
[40:09] I see the way the church of me is going
[40:12] and it's pulling me. Amen. With inside
[40:15] of me, something is pulling on me and
[40:17] pulling on me.
[40:20] and drawing me closer.
[40:24] Oh, it's not making me give up.
[40:26] It's not making me draw back. It's not
[40:29] making me disbelieve
[40:31] what I know I believe in him, but it's
[40:35] making me draw closer.
[40:37] Amen.
[40:38] Oh, that's what it does to the bride of
[40:40] Jesus Christ. Amen. Satan thinks that he
[40:43] like the banana. What do you think that
[40:45] banana description is? He thinks he has
[40:48] her. He's squeezing her. Boom. She pops
[40:50] out. That's what's happening.
[40:54] Amen. All these things that are coming
[40:56] upon my life, upon your life, you think
[40:58] Satan is, "Oh, he's going to get me.
[41:00] He's going to sweep." No, no, no, no.
[41:03] No.
[41:05] It's getting you to a place
[41:07] where you need to be.
[41:09] Amen.
[41:10] This morning is getting you to a place
[41:12] where you need to be.
[41:13] Amen.
[41:14] Oh yes.
[41:16] Trust and believe in the Lord.
[41:18] Amen. Oh, we say it. Trust and believe
[41:21] in the Lord.
[41:23] Amen.
[41:25] Hallelujah. We've been given a token.
[41:28] Amen. And the blood is the token. It's
[41:32] the life. It's on the doorpost of my
[41:35] heart, on your heart.
[41:38] Amen.
[41:39] It's the substance that he has given us
[41:41] in this last day. How can we fail?
[41:46] How can this word fail?
[41:49] How can the bride be defeated when the
[41:52] very light, the blood, the token has
[41:56] been spilled, has been released.
[41:59] The only reason why I'm here this
[42:01] morning, the only reason why you're
[42:03] here, if you're truly born again this
[42:04] morning, is because back is 63. We have
[42:07] a number 63. But back in time
[42:12] and God's appointed time, he sent forth
[42:14] his son.
[42:16] And he called, his son spoke,
[42:20] and he called your name.
[42:21] Amen. Amen.
[42:23] Consecrated life. Word of God over here.
[42:26] Come forth.
[42:28] Word of God here. Word of God here. Word
[42:31] of God here. Word of God here. Word of
[42:33] God here.
[42:34] Come forth.
[42:36] And that's why you're here this morning.
[42:38] Because those seals,
[42:41] you are under those seals. Who you are,
[42:46] who you are in Christ, who that word of
[42:49] God that is dealing with your life and
[42:52] bringing you to a place of manifestation
[42:55] was released. How can it fail?
[42:58] Do you believe? Do you believe that
[43:00] you're you've been called? Do you
[43:02] believe what I'm saying? That that this
[43:04] is you.
[43:05] But how can it fail?
[43:06] Hallelujah.
[43:07] How can it fail?
[43:09] That's right.
[43:09] How can your life fail? How can any
[43:12] challenge, any circumstance,
[43:16] what you're facing, I don't care what it
[43:19] is, what's holding you back, what change
[43:22] are binding you, how can it fail?
[43:28] Understand?
[43:30] Can't fail things.
[43:36] It's not the direction that I thought I
[43:38] was going to go.
[43:42] Maybe we're going to have to do another
[43:43] part.
[43:47] We must contend for the faith.
[43:54] I believe the question the Holy Ghost
[43:57] has put forth to us today.
[44:03] Are you contending
[44:05] for the faith?
[44:11] [Music]
[44:12] Are we passionate,
[44:16] vigilant, bold, hungry, thirsty,
[44:23] the ones who want more,
[44:26] not just a ticket to heaven, but you
[44:29] want your full inheritance.
[44:31] And we know our full inheritance is not
[44:33] just our soul being saved.
[44:37] is our mind and our spirits being loose
[44:40] and set free because that's what God
[44:43] wants to manifest himself.
[44:45] [Music]
[44:46] Or else why did he at the first
[44:48] resurrection back there just take
[44:50] everybody up with him?
[44:52] He would have done that if that if that
[44:54] was the truth.
[44:56] But he wants you fully delivered
[45:00] because he wants to fully manifest
[45:02] himself.
[45:03] It's not about you. It's not about me.
[45:04] It's about him.
[45:05] Amen. Amen.
[45:12] Do you want the power of God in your
[45:14] life?
[45:17] [Music]
[45:20] Yes, I want the power of God, then obey
[45:23] God. Obey the word step by step. Take a
[45:27] little step, one step at a time.
[45:32] I'm not asking you to do big obedience,
[45:36] but even in a in in a strong trial, in a
[45:39] strong situation that you're facing,
[45:42] take a little step of believing. Just
[45:45] take and the word as much as you can
[45:48] say, "Lord, I believe this. I take it."
[45:51] And reject reject that.
[45:54] Amen.
[45:55] And then move ahead and watch more faith
[45:58] will open up to you. Then take that and
[46:00] reject it. Little by little, I will
[46:03] deliver my people.
[46:04] Amen.
[46:04] Little by
[46:05] Hallelujah.
[46:07] Steps. Little by little.
[46:09] I will break the chains.
[46:12] Hallelujah.
[46:16] You want to cast out devils in Jesus
[46:18] name. You want to lay hands on the sick
[46:20] and minister healing power to of God.
[46:23] You want to operate and manifest the
[46:25] gifts of the spirit. You want signs and
[46:27] wonders and miracles flowing through
[46:29] your life.
[46:31] You want the token,
[46:34] the literal life of God, Christ moving,
[46:38] living, walking out from you.
[46:44] What's the song say?
[46:47] Only believe.
[46:50] I don't want to make this complicated
[46:52] and I hope I haven't. only believe
[46:56] all things are possible
[46:59] to them that belief.
[47:01] That's where we stand this morning. It's
[47:04] very simple. Whether you're
[47:08] been in the messes 30, 40 years, you're
[47:11] a young teenager, whatever you are, it's
[47:14] very simple this morning to where you're
[47:17] at. If you have a desire
[47:22] to know this Christ that I'm talking
[47:24] about,
[47:25] desires of the father
[47:29] and he has a desire
[47:32] for you to know him.
