what God is doing in this day and in this hour and we're blessed to be able to be under that that umbrella that revelation uh of the holy spirit that uh we we are beneficiaries of that I know that I've benefited in a tremendous way over 30 years being under such a wonderful ministry as uh Pastor John Simon has provided amen and has touched lives all over the world Amen praise God and I know that his you know like he said the Lord is just moving him into the next stage of his ministry because as long as we're here here and we are attributes of God we are in Ministry amen no matter where we are where God places us because the Revelation and the life of Christ is around us I was telling my wife I said listen we can't help it there's an anointing around our lives and because it's the word for for today you know a lot of people well what's the word what's the word you want to know what the word is for the day just look at your life if your life lined up with the word of God for this hour then you are the word manifest in the midst of the people and there's going to be an atmosphere that goes with you people will get healed people will get you know uh supernaturally touched mental illness situations things around their lives you come into their midst and you start to Fellowship because we're not we're not here to condemn the people we're not here to to tell them oh we have the truth and you don't have it and this and no we we can't help who we are we have the word of God in our lives because he came amen we're going to see that today praise God and so um I trust that uh you also had a wonderful time here on Wednesday night if you didn't catch brother Phillip's service on Wednesday night you need to go back and listen to that service amen you will be blessed amen praise God God is moving in very simple but wonderful ways to encourage and to edify and to discern situations that are going on in each and every one of our lives so just believe in the power of God and and the ministry that God has provided for us in this day and in this hour amen praise God also I want to um uh let you know that uh you know we all know that we're having uh special meetings coming up this coming weekend amen and so this Wednesday night service is cancelled in preparations for those meetings because a lot of people will be doing things preparing we'll be here on Thursday setting up setting up tents bringing in equipment so forth so um Wednesday night service is cancelled okay brother Christopher was scheduled but we're going to have him fit right into another service uh for us very soon I already know amen praise God and so um uh let's uh let's keep that in prayer for this week we have uh a meeting right after the service for those that are involved in the leadership trustees deacons and those that have been asked to be in the meeting please do attend right after the service we've also got church general cleaning right after the service all of you that

going to let you know but you will receive an email we are are going to have a visiting minister with us on September the the 22nd he is uh brother Fabian Palma from uh South America Chile okay um he uh he definitely comes recommended I was in communication with brother George Smith he says he's going to be a real blessing to us he'll be ministering here for about a week in the GTA he's got an interpreter with him um so I believe we're going to be blessed he'll be doing servic and a few of the different churches is here and he'll be with us on Sunday September the 22nd amen praise God and so um let's all now turn our attention to the reason that we come to the house of the Lord every Sunday every Wednesday to come and feed on the Living God Amen the word of God for this day and for this hour amen and so um let's go to our um uh scripture I believe we're going to be truly blessed today by the word of God if you've come with expectation in your hearts you are going to get blessed it's as simple as that because I know I've done what I need to do now you need to do what you need to do and that's pull on the word of God and allow the spirit to discern your needs your situations everything that you have need of God wants to meet your needs amen you believe that amen not just you that are here in the in the church but those that are out out there online you're listening in you just believe God he can speak to you amen and he can meet your needs and you definitely need to hear this word today amen because we're going to be talking about overcoming in Christ you know we're living in a day where uh overcoming is something that you know people they talk about it they speak about it but you know there's only one way to truly overcome in the age that that you are living in and that is in Christ let's read our scripture slide three 1 John 4: 1-4 says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of god listen carefully I'm going to repeat that statement every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and the Bible says and the Word was with God the Word was God God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so who is the word it's Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ the self-existent one Elohim the one that was the word in the beginning that created all of Heaven all that's on the earth everything that that is consists of Jesus Christ and so and every Spirit now listen here now and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereby ye have heard that it should come and even now now already is in the world ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you that is in you amen that is in you and you and you and every one of you than he that is in the world let us pray father we so appreciate you this morning Lord and father we're we're excited this morning to know that you're mindful of every need and every situation and the circumstances that we are all facing because I know we're all overcoming something Lord and we're asking you to come and give us the wisdom the direction and your spirit that gives us the overcoming power in this hour Grant it we pray Lord bless speaker and hearer in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints you may be seated glory to God Amen listen I know that um you know not not uh um everybody likes to hear these you know these these kinds of scriptures you know sometimes people get you know a little bit um red up and you know they just um don't want to hear about the Antichrist they don't want to hear about you know that uh that that that God is is almighty God and that he's and his name is Jesus Christ you got so many different interpretations on the word of God and and and and about God in the world today and so there's there's you know people that are Buddha people that are Hindu people that are that are Muslim people that that that believe in the Trinity people that that believe in Jehovah Witness and you've got all these different interpretations on the word of God but when somebody comes out and brings the word pure right from the scripture amen it it it stirs Hearts it stir individuals and it stirs Spirits amen praise God but we know we know that the word of God is is is perfect it's true it's just amen you know it was CS Lewis you know people don't like hearing about Satan they don't like hearing about hell but it was CS Lewis in his book in screw tape letters he wrote indeed the safest Road to Hell is the gradual one one the gentle slope slope underfoot without sudden turnings without Milestones without signposts although a born again believer has no fear of death and hell you must watch out for the oppressing burden of a spirit whose entire purpose listen the enemy's entire purpose from when Jesus walked on the Earth from when Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden his entire purpose was to cause you cause anyone that believes and confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord caused them to what fall gradual you know you look into the world everything is just you know like look these elections are are are you know really I mean you could get caught up watching these elections it's almost entertaining yes amen you know but it's serious too because this world is in a mess you've got a nation in the United States of America that's completely divided you've got you've got uh um uh so much going on where you know this political party is bashing that the Democrats are bashing the Republic Republicans the Republicans are bashing the Democrats and they're in a war and the people are trying to find out you know so many people one minute they're on this side the next day they're on that side they can't figure out what side to get on because one minute you're hearing and the way they bring these these accusations against each of the you know the the the the presidential candidates and their and their parties and so forth you wonder my goodness who do you believe aren't you glad you believe the true report listen no matter who goes into government whether it's Trump or whether it's Harris I'm telling you there's a power behind it which is which is not of God I'm just going to tell you the way it is amen we're going to be looking at it today amen we're going to see certain things today that that we're going to realize that no matter which side gets into the power there's a higher power that that that that is that is evil that is powers and principalities and dominions amen and Satan is the head of it all but there's one more power that goes above that one there and that's the one that we serve amen and so you can know and rest assure that you are in safe hands and your future I know the Americans are wondering about you know they they keep saying an America a future for America a future for the people of America and that's what they're promoting they want a future but I'm telling you there is no future but the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the government shall be upon his shoulders and that government will reign for 1,000 years right here on the earth amen praise God Amen let's let's move along here I want you to notice here we're talking about overcoming today how many needs to overcome how many wants to know how to overcome it's one thing to overcome and one thing to know that you need to overcome and even the circumstances that you need to overcome but it's a better thing to know how amen praise God and so I I truly believe that that we need to uh dig a little deeper into this and we'll see where we get today and how far this is going to go but I believe there might be you know one or two or maybe a couple of more services amen but let's just see what the Lord is going to do and so let's go to the next slide in Revelations uh chapter 2 verse 7 in in now I want you to see here that we're going to be looking at each of the church ages and each messenger we're not going to be looking specifically and in depth but I want to bring something to your attention here there are things that are promised to the Overcomer I want you to know that you can overcome and you can know that there are bless blessings that come from overcoming amen praise God and here the Lord is speaking and it's red letter because it's the Lord that's speaking in the Book of Revelation here chapter 2 and he's speaking to the to the first church in Ephesus and he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh there's got to be an overcoming every age had to overcome the spirits and the age and the oppression and the lies and the deception of the enemy I want you to see this is a this this is a a a a strain that started right back in the Garden of Eden and it's going to end up right here right now in this generation it's going to be it's going to be an overcoming amen for every individual that's called to each dispensation and time that you're living in and he says to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life Oh Glory to God which is in the midst of the paradise of God do you know that Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden and they were feeding off of the Tree of Life God would come you know who the tree of life is right it's it's God it's Jesus Christ he is he is the one that's going to feed us that you know the Revelation that you're that you're receiving right now you think oh wow praise God what a mighty God we serve Revelation that's going to give us the strength to overcome the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against God's revelation directly to you directly from God but you're going to be feeding on that for eternity amen sometimes you know you go to an event and the event is fantastic and my God you have such a great time but then it comes to an end well there's an event which is called feeding on the revelation of God's word that'll never stop it'll take you and Quicken you right out of this Dimension into another dimension it's going to be a lot better than this it only gets better you think this is good you think you're going to be excited by the word today it only gets better praise God forever more and so we're going to be feeding from the Tree of Life you know that tree is an eternal tree it's the tree that only those that are that are branches like Jesus said I am the branch ye are the Vine I am the vine ye are the branches only the branches that come from that tree can actually feed on that tree that's why you know he keeps saying to them that overcome but guess what you're designed to overcome you were designed before the foundations of the world to come into this age this dispensation this world condition and don't tell me that the world is not in chaos and in trouble Wars and everything else that's going on but you were designed to come into this time to overcome and that's why you're going to feed on the tree of life and that's why you're feeding on the tree of life amen cuz you've already overcome this is the Paradox amen go to the next slide Suna he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death you see samna that was the age that was a dark age and a lot of the Saints their fulfillment and manifestation of fulfilling the word in their day was death they would have to die for the gospel and millions of Christians were put to death in that dispensation in in that age but God promised them that you're going to overcome and when you overcome you're not going to be affected by the second death that's the one that that's the one that kills the soul that's the one that puts you right back into the Lake of Fire you know hell is not Eternal let's make it clear here there's no such thing as an eternal hell people talk about it they say you know but there's no such thing God created those that would have a beginning and would have an end okay so anything that has an end cannot be Eternal because Eternal has no beginning no end so hell is not somewhere Eternal but it is a place that's not going to be fun and that a lot of people that rejected the word of God are going to be in that place I don't know how long but it's not going to be Eternal they had a beginning after the great white Jo uh White Throne judgment and everything else some will be cast into the Lake of Fire well guess the Lake of Fire is Christ it's God he is an all-consuming fire and so if you had a beginning you're G to have an end and so your beginning was here on the Earth but some people that had a beginning and came into this Dimension as human beings they will reject and deny and just like the scripture says they will say that Jesus Christ did not come God did not die for me he did he is not my savior and to them guess what they don't go in the Blessed place they don't go to the redeemed they don't go to Glory they're going to have to face whatever they did they're going to be judged at the white Throne judgment according to the works in their flesh that's what the scripture says a lot of people oh I never killed anybody oh you know Danny I know you go to church a lot but you know I want you to know I I never killed anybody like killing somebody you know like Paul turn around and tell him right away well what's that got to do with it Paul who wrote most of the New Testament killed a lot of people so what are you trying to tell me he was saved he killed a lot of people if you don't accept Jesus Christ right now like the way Paul got knocked off his horse and accept Jesus Christ in in in today in the power of his resurrection today you're lost If you deny the word of God you're lost I'm not going to say that to them but that's what the scripture says because we can't tell we listen you don't know who's lost and who's not so don't be going out there thinking because you believe this message and this word that you can identify lost saved lost saved bride foolish virgin get away from all of that nonsense just feed on the word of God and you will be exactly who you're supposed to be and they will manifest exactly who they're supposed to be but all I can say is that if you overcome you don't face the second death because all of these promises I want you to know they all come down and they all come down upon the Believers in this day and in this hour am amen next slide in pergamus he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden Mana Oh Glory to God and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it Oh Glory to God my God we could preach a sermon right there amen your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life when before the foundations of the world you might have come down on this Earth as Gabriel Fetti but really back there you are an attribute of God and God's got another name for you although I think his name might end up being Gabriel because he's a messenger like nobody else Hallelujah I thank God for Gabriel the messenger amen praise God so I believe that you know we are feasting now on this this wonderful revelation of knowing who we are and that we actually feed on hidden Mana every time we come into the house of the Lord because what is the hidden Mana it's a revelation of the word it's the understanding of the word that when you talk to somebody and you tell them about you know you need to be baptized as an adult in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ just according to acts chap 2:38 just the way Paul told it in Acts chapter uh 19 you know like the water the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you tell them that but yet for some reason they can't see it you tell them about the God Head he's not a trinity it is one God I am one he told the children of Israel here ye oh Israel the Lord iy God is one not two three you see but you need a revelation on that where God reveals it into your heart it's the hidden Mana that you're feeding on right now and it brings you into Christ and if you're in Christ you're ordained to overcome am Hallelujah so only those that receive it are going to know and I know that I know and I know that you that know that you know where you stand you know that this word is a reality you know that it's not just some other church that you joined amen praise God let's go to the next slide in thara he says and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the Morning Star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches that in a nutshell is saying I'm going to come in you I am going to rule and Reign on this Earth and you are going to be able to rule and Reign your life your world your circumstances because he's going to place himself the morning star in you that's your overcoming power you overcome you you you you you receive the blessing that comes with overcoming don't think it strange Saints when you're under circumstances and and trials and oh why did this come to me why did this have to happen to me why did this circumstance why did this bill all of a sudden show up because God wants you to overcome God wants you to know that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and when you recognize that there's a there's an anointing that comes upon you and there's a quickening that happens in your life that you can't you can't interpret that I'm not going to try to interpret that but you're being changed you're being transformed you're being translated into another dimension every time you overcome that's why Peter said count it all joy when you come under to those fiery trials because something is happening in you that's transforming you Amen to become an over to to to show this world that you are an overcomer but you're doing it in Christ next one Sardis he says he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and by the way this is Revelations chapter 3 verses 4 to 5 that's an error up there I corrected it amen praise God so here when we look at this we can see here that somebody can actually be written into the book of life now we're not talking about the Lamb's Book the Lamb's Book of Life Is Christ and his attributes you had no beginning you can never have an end but there are those that are here on this Earth that are going to a lot of the different Christian churches sincere people sincere but there there listen there's categories Within in the Christian Body of Christ worldwide Christian churches and so forth and there are those that are sincerely living good Christian lives even better than some of you but by the grace of God you're an attribute whose name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life you need to do some research and read on that I don't want to get into into a indepth study on it but there are those whose names can be blotted out of the book of life that's those that all exist and consist by the life of God because everything lives by God Amen and there are going to be a lot of people that that are going to be saved that are not the bride okay there's going to be people saved that are going to go to heaven that are going to be in heaven but they're not going to be the bride they're going to be servants they're going to be those that were good brother Bram says you're going to be shocked when you get there there's going to be people there that you didn't know would would you thought oh maybe they weren't going to make it listen I believe my whole family is going to be there if they're not in the bride they're going to be there anyway Hallelujah praise God I I believe we should all love our families and and treat them as though they're going to be there because you don't know who is and who isn't you need to express Christ in the love of God and you need to express that love towards them you need to stay with the word okay because you're designed remember you you were ordained to receive this messag amen you you couldn't miss it I couldn't miss it there's just no way because because it's not given by intellect it's not intellectually taught it's not you know forced upon anybody no no no no this is something that is supernaturally revealed by divine revelation it's the hidden Mana it's something Jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father my spirit my anointing my the Christ has revealed this unto you and that's why no matter what anybody tells you you just stand on the word of God Amen because you know where you're standing he said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against this way of divinely revealing himself to each individual that's why don't be trying to force people come to my church I don't I'm I'm not forcing anybody but if you hear his voice he that hath an ear oh boy come on now he that ear let him hear what the spirit is saying amen praise God and so let's go to the next slide him that overcometh in Philadelphia age will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God Amen praise God and the name of the city of my God which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from God and I will write upon him my new name oh my goodness Hallelujah glory to God he come riding on a horse and his name was the word of God Amen you are attribute words of the Living God because you have overcome he's he's told you he's written his own name he's given you his name listen when a bride goes to the altar I mean in the old days nowadays they keep their own names and you know it's just one of these things but the wife would always take the husband's name because they two became one and he was the the the head and and and the headship like a man you know protects his bride you know when it's the bride protecting when it's the woman protecting the man there's something out of cater here now we need to protect one another don't get me wrong but if my wife and I are walking through the forest and all of a sudden a bear comes out of the woods I'm not gonna and run the other way and leave my wife behind think about it okay any man is going to you know that's a real man and he's going to he's he's going to he's going to stand between that bear and his wife and he's going to say you got to get through me honey run but you got to get through me run you see you got to resist the devil and you got to lead your your wife in a way where you you you when when you're fellow shipping when you're directing her under battles under circumstances under situations you need to reinforce them with the word of God Amen because it's the word of God that is going to defeat and overcome the enemy it'll never be anything less than the word of God Amen and so you tell them resist the devil resist those thoughts resist that enemy run away from that enemy resist him turn away from him amen praise God hallelujah aren't you glad that you are going to have his name and that he is backing you up he got your back this morning amen let's go to the next slide CU this one pertains to this hour and this one says behold I stand at the door and knock you know that this is the only age where he's not in the church he's actually outside the church and that's why we are who we are we're non- denominational we're not affiliated with anything but the word of God somebody says to me well what is your church all about I said just read the book of Acts it's the acts of the holy spirit in the church and the spirit of God is still acting in the church and if you want to know what he's acting and what he's doing then you know what you can come to church amen because that's what we represent the book of Acts of the holy spirit in his discip IES in his Apostles in his five-fold ministry amen praise God so he's outside of the churches today and he's sitting there and he's knocking to say hey there's a message in the land amen praise God that's calling a people back to the original word back to the faith of the fathers amen and God has sent us a Prophet by the name of William Branham another messenger another church age messenger just like there was one for each and every one of these ages here Martin Luther broke away from the Catholic church he was the messenger to the Sardis or no the the uh let me just go back here not Philadelphia because that was Wesley Sardis okay Martin Luther he was the messenger to the Sardis age and he he went right up before the Catholic church and all of their dignitaries and he says hold on a minute here the just shall live by their own revelation of the word of God not by what you're saying by what you're interpreting we don't have how come how come the people don't have their own Bibles the people need to read the word for themselves because Faith cometh by hearing the word and when you you're actually hearing the word too and so Luther broke away from the church and he was the messenger to that age well Wesley come along to the Philadelphia age and he says hey hang on a minute here you guys got Revelation now you know who you are you know that you need you know this personal relationship with Jesus Christ and you don't need a mediator between you and Christ okay but you need to sanctify your lives he was all about sanctification ation about cleaning up your lives you know you're cheating you're stealing you're drinking you're smoking you're you're doing all these things and taking other wives and other men's wives and all this no you got to sanctify your life and allow the Holy Spirit to live now you're not going to be perfect there's nobody perfect you're not going to be perfect until you leave this place you're going to have to overcome amen praise God but God has given us that ability by sending us a messenger in our day in the 20th century by the name of William brandham that restored the word of God you go back and study you know that's why we quote things that that he that he that he preached and that he wrote because they are relevant today amen they are they are truths that pertain to the church for this day and for this hour we don't make William brandham the absolute we recognize the Fulfillment of scripture just like we recognize Moses Elijah all the other prophets of the Old Testament they were prophets but we by the grace of God had one come to America Hallelujah in the 20th century and if you go back and study that life you will see clearly that it was a Supernatural Ministry there's no way you could see it any other way you might still deny it you might call it a cult you might call I don't care what you want to call it if if you're calling it a cult or you're calling it and denying it is because you do not have a revelation of it that's the difference it's not been revealed to you that's why to them that hath an ear unto you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom amen glory to God he revealed and fulfilled Rev Gans 10: 1 to7 amen you can go back and look up all of those things but here now here Jesus is standing outside of the church in the leodan church age which is the age that we are now translating from okay we're we're we're in transition right now we're in the Rapture actually you know those that are alive and remain they shall be caught up together to meet those that those you know all of that is it's all in progress right now one's going to be taken one's going to be left one's going to be in the field the other one's going to be left you see that's all happening it already happened in your life and in my life and that's why you're here the Holy Spirit already called you pulled you out of the world snatched you out you know some of your family they're saying no thanks you say no problem praise God this is where I am because this is the voice that I heard call my name amen and so this is all in progress right now so he's knocking at the door aren't you glad that you opened that door aren't you glad that you were able to hear his voice that you know that that he knew that the churches would get so out of cater that the word of God would become of none effect to the people anymore to the point where he had to stand outside and says I'm not even in those churches anymore they've they've they've organized me out yeah they've made me a trinity they've made me one a mighty God and then an almighty God they've made me all kinds they've made me a New Age movement they've made me a just a you know a master of the teachings of of of levels of conscious they've made him all kinds of different interpretations but he says I am Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever ever and you and my sheep will hear my voice no other they're going to follow amen so he's outside the church and he's knocking but you answered and because you answered he says on that day he shall know that I am in the father ye and me and I and you am I in you am so that you can overcome the things that you have to overcome in the age that you're living in you know Jesus had to overcome you know that amen let's keep going praise God listen to brother brandham here next slide he says in the leoan church age William Bram says now what are we to overcome this is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how how we are to overcome now this is logical for does it matter what much what we overcome as long as we know how we overcome a quick look at those scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in Matthew chapter 4 wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by by the word and by the word only don't you be looking to do or overcome anything in this world other than by the word of God and when I say that a lot of people say oh so you just you just got to go to the word and and and and only whatever the word says that's what you're going to do no it means that when you read the word and the word is revealed to you and it becomes life to you it's no longer just quoting a scripture it's actually having the ability to live the scripture to live because Satan he's not interested in how much you can quote the word just like when he when he when he came up against those Sons ofke he says Paul I know Jesus I know but who are you and he St dripped them he he he slapped them around like a couple of uh uh ding-dongs left them there completely on their on their backs not knowing who they were because all they could do was quote scripture we're not talking about quoting scripture we're talking about the scripture becoming your life he's he listen Satan doesn't want he he's afraid of that life he's afraid that you know by Revelation who you are and when somebody knows who they are they can stand in front of a bear and they can tell that bear where to go and yell a lot louder than that bear and that bear will run because of the spirit of God because of the anointing because they can sense Bears animals they can sense that's why dogs I've owned dogs that are dangerous dogs German Shepherds but when you upsert authority over those dogs by the way you speak to them and by the way you know that you have authority over them they bow they immediately submit themselves but if there's any fear in you then they know that and they can sense it and they will attack you that's how the enemy works that's why Satan he looks to see if there's fear in you that's why don't speak fear speak Faith speak the word of God God don't speak lack but speak Prosperity into your lives I got a bill so God is going to bless me with more Finance to pay the bill Hallelujah you see it's how you approach every circumstance and every situation it's knowing that the word is in you in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in the direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer amen also is it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word Can't Fail Oh Glory to God Amen thank you Jesus you can leave here today fortified by the word of God knowing that God listen you can't fail you might fall but you ain't going to fail you might be knocked down but you ain't going to be knocked out Hallelujah brother praise God because God is God has designed you to be an overcomer amen praise God hallelujah next quote here he says in his personal life now contending with himself now listen Jesus himself he overcame by obedience to the word of God imagine the word was in the beginning the word was made flesh and dwelt among us but yet the word had to overcome that's interesting God in you because there's a connection Jesus would say I do nothing L the father reveals it I don't do anything unless the father shows me I and the father are one he had that relationship he needed to he needed to remind himself because remember he was in human flesh listen here he said in Hebrews 5:7 it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared he was at the Garden of Gethsemane he was he knew what he had to go and face he knew what they were going to do to him he realized that he was going to have to take a beating but he came under obedience to the word of God Amen praise God listen you are going to have to suffer sometimes let's not start there just yet though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word of God a lot of people say the word Danny you always talking about the word you're talking about the word that is the absolute no man is any better than his own word hallelujah if you're going to trust in something you need an absolute in this hour I'll tell you right now people out there they're trembling they're trembling they look at you and they know you're so confident about God and you know that you've made him your absolute and they know that they don't have an absolute their absolute might be the doctor's report there my God I hope the doctor he's got that that test and oh man oh boy if he tells me I got cancer I'm done oh boy and all it's all fear it's all fear you're all worried about this cancer you're worried about that when when if you've got Christ and you know that you're in Christ you know that you've received his word you know that you've obeyed his word word you know you've come God's provided way according to the word then you should be able to stand and like the scripture says be still and know that I am God and I don't change I will be there it might be at the last minute might be at the last second but I'll be there he says so you know when you're standing like that it's a totally different situation the circumstances all complete different you know what the word says about you amen the word of God now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word can we go back two slides please because I just realized we didn't read verse 21 he said I'm standing at the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne when is that going to happen that's going to happen in the Millennium and that's already happening to some of us even now we're seated with Christ in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now you're seated with him and you've been given the authority you've been given the power power to overcome this age amen praise God he that ha an ear so now let's go back to the quote I I realized that I had missed that because you know those that overcome in this age they go to the Millennium in the body change to rule and reign with Christ who's going to have the government upon his shoulders for 1,000 years of peace right here on this Earth so you can tell your friends it's not the end of the world okay it's the end times but those that are being prepared by the word that are being fortified by the word today and have accepted Christ and are overcoming this age by believing the word they're going to sit with him they're going to go in a Rapture they're going to bypass the Great Tribulation amen so here it is and so now he says sit with the Lord you will not unless you've been living that word so that word has got to be alive in you it's not only when you come to church on Sunday you put on that happy face you put on the dress and then Monday morning you got your tight skirt and jean back on that's not living Christ Living Christ is an everyday experience knowing that he is is in you he's with you he'll be with you right until the end of this age and the age is coming to an abrupt end very soon saints of God we're living in troubled times amen praise God and so your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that Throne it will be granted only to the word bride in other words the church that is living by the word of God in this day and in this hour and we're not like like menites people say oh you dress like menites you you live in a certain you know no we're Freer than anybody else we dress the way we dress because we love the Lord because we have a revelation that you know that a woman shouldn't be going down the street with a mini skirt on because she Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her so they're both going to be held accountable for committing adultery like spiritually speaking your thoughts are a lot louder in heaven than they are here on Earth I can tell you that amen God's going to flash everything before you so it's not a matter of you're living a certain way like you you you've got certain Rules by the way that you live no we live because we love the Lord and we have a revelation and a relationship with Christ that's why you don't hear me taking the name of the Lord in vain my friends every time you know they're around me stuff they you know they they'll they'll shoot the this word that word and they'll turn to me sorry Dan I said listen it's what comes out that defiles the individual okay I appreciate the fact that you know that that you're showing respect unto me because I I love the Lord and I don't use that kind of language I appreciate that and and so for whatever reason you're feeling that little conviction in your heart listen to it prise the Lord it'll make you a better person because it's not what goes in that defiles it's what comes out and I hear people swearing and taking the name of the Lord in vain and this and that they've got no relationship a man who sits and talks about his wife and you know says all kinds of things you know you hear it all the time you know oh man I a trador in you know and this and that you hear people talking like because you know you get you know people get older and and and they start you know it's just natural right it's just you know people just the way they are you know it's just you know people have certain relationships you know I overheard this guy was talking he was you know they they were in Jerusalem together with the family and they were all there and and he was there with his wife and his mother-in-law was there and the you know the the husband uh had already the father-in-law had already passed away but while they were there and they were there you know right at the site where they were you know where Jesus had died and Rose from you know at the cave and everything else and the the the Mother-in-law had a heart attack right there and then and died right there on the spot and they and then the people got together and they said listen you know what um we can take care of the funeral here uh you don't have to worry about shipping her back home it's going to cost thousands of dollars and everything else and and uh and and the father-in-law immediately said no no no no no no no no no we're shipping her home I don't know how I don't care how much it cost he says somebody died here and three days later they rose from the dead you see that's the kind of stuff that people you know they talk about those things yeah it's a little bit funny but this is going on all the time and and people they they have this concept of of relationships and everything else but we need to have the right concept of our relationship with Christ amen praise God hallelujah and when we have that kind of a relationship we live for Christ amen praise God hallelujah and so here now I think what we're going to do is we're going to stop right here praise God Amen we're going to continue because this is going to get real good this is going to give us a lot of uh you know uh encouragement to overcome and how we can overcome the enemy and overcome the devil and the situations that he throws at us amen we're going to we're going to see from the examples of God's word exactly how we can overcome and I want you to know your designed to overcome let the musicians come amen praise God hallelujah amen so at this time I'm going to hand it over to brother Mike for a few songs but please be aware of the meeting that's going to take place and Please be aware for those of you that can stay behind and help with the um the cleaning of the church it would be much appreciated praise God before we go to songs let's just pray father thank you for your word
