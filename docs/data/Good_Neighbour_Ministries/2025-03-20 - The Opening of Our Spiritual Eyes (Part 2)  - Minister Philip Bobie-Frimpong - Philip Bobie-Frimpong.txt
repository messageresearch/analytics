the by by the church and it was stuff that I I couldn't ex I I couldn't even tell her these things she was hearing from somebody else so it was a eye opener for her to see these things and I I'm just marveled at his grace and his Mercy she came back and she didn't say nothing but you could tell that she was shaken up because she would come here sometimes and listen to the word and the Holy Spirit would speak a certain way and it would be like oh you you guys hate the Catholics but they hear it from a voice somebody who was a historian speaking and saying these things showing us the places that there's one guy he they were he was being converted from Jew to Christian to Catholic and and the Muslim them and they was in the church that day and apparently they had a light coming on and the priest said look look there's Jesus coming through the light and he says no no no that's a staining glass they all jumped on him and they killed him that day right in the church where we were and it was for my kids they were like Blown Away by the history of this thing and I said Lord I didn't even know I was what what I was doing but God was making a way for her to see something so we certainly

God us around your word remember all those that are listening in online go bless them Father their atmosph receive you have usaus amen um I have a lengthy scripture maybe I read it back and forth um Luke chap 24:3 to 2 and Matthew 17913 um okay okay if you got say Amen okay so Luke 24:3 in my Bible okay I can read it from there and behold two of them went that that same day to a village called Emos which was from Jerusalem about three score Falls and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reisen and reason J himself Drew near and went with them but the eyes were holding that they should not know him but there and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as he walk and as s and one of them whose name was copas answering said unto him are thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and Hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and went before God and all the prophets and how the chief priest and all our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yeah and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the serle and when they found not his body they came saying they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the saer and found it even so as the woman had said but him they saw not then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophet have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered this things and enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expanded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew near onto the village which they went and made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with this for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went into ter with them and it came to pass as he sat at meet with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said unto one another did not our heart bur within us while he stuck with this by the way and while he open to us the scriptures um Matthew [Music] 17 Matthew 17 19-13 then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out verse 9-13 Matthew 17: 9-13 and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying th the vision to no man until the son of man be raisen again from the dead and the disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elas must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them elas truly shall first come and restore all things but I said unto that elas is SC already and they knew him not but they have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of manine suffered of them then the disciples understood that he spoke unto them of John the Baptist let's pray Heavenly Father may you please bless the reading of their word in Jesus name amen yeah please be seated sorry for keeping you so long um so if I'll title this I'll said the opening of our spiritual Eyes Part Two we talk about it about a month ago how like a hazy his natural eyes were open but when the serans came to encamp around them he told Elijah that the people among us are so huge they are coming to beat us they are more and Elijah said that Elisha said that they that are with us are more than they that are coming to encamp around this and he said God open the young man eyes naturally GES eyes was open but he couldn't his spiritual because his spiritual eyes were blind at that time he could not see that the angels were encamp around them so they that were with them were more than they that were against them so Elisha asked God to open his eyes and when his spiritual eyes open then he saw what Elisha was saying so we talk about unless your spiritual eyes is open you can see things with naked but you won't understand it because it takes God to open your eyes of understanding and we talk about God has opened our eyes of understanding in this age and we are blessed because to to us it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom but to other it's not given but for you it is given so we are blessed by our heart of understanding that God has opened up at life we talk about Samson and so many of them when he um even though when he was naturally blind at that time when his spiritual eyes got open he was able to defeat achieve more with that natural spiritual eyes open inside than when he was physically could see things so Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's never changed so God is still Open the Eyes of his children and blinding the eyes of those who are not supposed to see but you have to be happy and be thankful to God that your eyes of understanding he has has opened up at last amen so that's all it's about that he has opened our spiritual understanding so um that's a little bit recap but today we're going to go back to another blinding of the eyes of the Believers of the disciples these two people walk with the Lord they eat with him they did everything but still when he rose from dead he resurrected they could not see him but one thing that was good about them is that they were talking about him on their way to M they were disappointed they left home and everything but their conversation was about the Lord Jesus Christ and as we talk about him he drew nearer onto them so the question is what are you talking about what are you thinking about what are your focus because the enemy is canning now we have so much information and and even in this age especially recent that Trump came myself I'm become a culprate because like you open the news then you going to get from tari to H Iran to Jews to this and the all the information by the time if you don't wake up you'll be drawn into it and spend so much hours listening to news listening to that listening to that and then social media spiritual days that so many encap so much information I'm not saying that we don't need them as a bride of Christ we listen to the news to find what God what is happening in our time to apply to our life but there has to be a balance we have to balance it so that it doesn't consume all our time because it's a time that is no time to waste it says that even getting so hard that those who have children should even behave like they don't have children you have to pray earnestly as the time approaches because this is the time that is a wicked age it's a wicked hour and that Lous Spirit oh sorry that Lous spirit is around us it can make you look warm and if you don't take time it will just overcome you because that the spirit of the age but we have to shake ourself up and be in the presence of God because that's all that that's where we our strength is when we listen to The Taste when we pray when you read the Bible when you do our part that's where our strength is because the news sometimes if you listen to it to my you become depressed as our pastor was saying that you going to be people going to be scared oh is U Trump coming to invade aness Canada um this thing is going up this thing is going up and then you're going to be scared my mortgage this that it all going to bring too much depression on you but I'm not saying don't listen to it but you have to balance it and as a brother just sing the song that he is our provider he is our strength he is our everything the people in the world have no one to go to but we are blessed but we can go to the our maker you can go to God who provide all our needs so in the midst of all the chaos in the midst of all the tribulation in the midst of all the things going on our anchor hold in Christ and he promised that he will supply all our needs his everpresent help in times of trouble when Trouble Comes God will be there for us we have to rest assured on his word that the Bible said that a th000 will fall on your right hand 10,000 on your left hand but will not come near you only with your eyes will you see the end of the wicked and he promised he will preserve our going out and our coming in angels of God encamp around us so we should focus more on the word of God the Revelation part of the word we should feed on that and stay in his presence and be anchored in Christ more than putting all our attention on the things of the world of the things that is going on that is not our priority it's good to know all those things but what will it do to you if you are not able to apply it in the scriptures to know what God is doing present tense amen that's how we listen to the news for to recognize what God is doing in our time not in the past tense because a lot of people praise God for what he's going he has done in the past they praise him for what is going to happen in the future but fail to recognize what he's doing present tense now he's a present tense God so you should be able to identify yourself with the scripture for your day for what is going on even as you listen to the news but you don't Focus too much on the news because it will going to drawn you into it there has to be a balance there has to be a balance on the hour spent on the social media and all those things I always said that those internet the computer is there for you to use it but if you do not wake up it's going to use you you become slave to it instead of you using it it's going to use you so it has there has to be a balance so in everything that brother J Smith always said he always bring his even his um his level and put there there has to be a balance if you not balance things you are going to be way off to either side or the other side but what am I saying as we Sons and Daughters of God as we listening to the tips as we praying as we reading our Bible we are walking with the Lord because the Bible said Enoch walked with God and he was and he was not and because he was walking with God and communion with God every day he went out before the the rain came in the time of Noah so is the bride of Christ as all these things going on as we commun with God as we listen and you pray and get a revelation part of Faith one day before there's any one atomic bomb before there will be any third world war before the whole world will go into chaos will be out of here as Enoch went before the flat so the bride of Christ we are going to live before any tribulation sets in but the way you before you go is a pattern Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if Enoch walk with God before you can be in the Rapture you also have to walk with God because you cannot even walk without him holding our hand he's the one that is leading us he's the one that is guiding us so we have to be in a place that we are determined to walk with the Lord because no matter what comes our way our life is in the hands of God and he is leading us he is guiding us he's directing our footsteps so one of these days with a twinkle of an ey that true bride of Christ will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air amen either the people like it or not it's going to happen amen because it's the same yes yesterday today and forever amen Enoch walked with God and he was and he was not he didn't displease him and without faith it's impossible to please God and he only pleased God by faith and Enoch did never please God what the Lord said Enoch D it now he was a type remember the AR is a type of the Jews the 140 ,000 that's carried over which is Noah and his bnch but Enoch went home just a little bit before the flight you know that so Enoch just kept walking in the light so one day he felt his feet getting off the ground he just kept walking and he walk on into Glory without dying amen I'm excited that's right God took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony that he walked in the light of God kept walking let's go on walking shoes Church keep walking in the light beautiful light comes where the DU drops of Mercy are bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus is the light of the world so let's walk with the Lord amen let's focus on his word let's focus on him more than anything else because the things you think about it forms an atmosphere around you if you allow yourself to be consumed by the things that is going on present tense in the news is going to bring you fierce but if you focus on the word of God it's going to give you Joy it going to give you H peace peace unspeakable no wonder the Bible said that whatsoever things that are of good report whatsoever things that edifies if there are any virtues think on those things your thoughts are very important it speak louder in heaven than your wor than your words so we have to focus and think on the right thought because the more you listen to this it brings you fears because you are who you are by what you feed on you become what you eat there's no doubt about whatever you eat that's what you become of so if you Fe on God's word it becomes part of you and then it build will Iman resistance and all those things that is coming when people are so scared don't know what to do it doesn't bother you just like braah gave us an example of that lady who was traveling in the ship whatever to the US and then the thing was sinking or the plane and everybody was crying the lady said that they the captain asked her why don't you cry why are you not ping panicking like the she said that I'm not worried I have two daughters one in glory if this ship sink or the plane fall I'm going to see the one in the glory if it doesn't stin I'm going back to what to see my daughter in New York so it doesn't it doesn't not bother it doesn't bother him that's the way Believers has to be we have to be hot potato in the hands of the devil we have to be so much of God that the devil that will not know what to do with us because no matter what he brings on our way we are not shaking because something is flesh in our flesh we feel weak we feel H sometimes weak but deep inside our soul there is something El that rise up in every time to what overcome and face that situation that's why the Bible say greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he that's in you is Christ is greater than anything you going through it's greater than any accusation greater than any troubles it's greater than anything any sickness that the devil will try to bring your way because he said by his stripes we were healed amen he's the same yesterday today and forever whatever he did in the past he's going to do it he's doing it right now that's the god that we are serving amen amen praise God hallelujah amen and if you r that Luke 2416 to2 for they were blinded to the Fulfillment of scripture after the word was resurrected those disciples even though the Bible said that the disciples they have some of the the word was revealed to them they have it in part they didn't have it all revealed to them so when he died before the death came as um we read from the Mathew 17: 9-13 Matthew 17 verse 9-13 and as they came from the man the mountain Jesus CH them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be raisen again from the dead in other words he told the disciples that he is going to die and rise up again that's right he told them plainly over here and the disciples being the students of the Bible they asked him and disciples asked him why then say the St that Elias must first come because like a lot of people following this word they know the sequence of the word so they asked him that if the son of man be raisen from dead then why that Elijah has not come yet you know but they didn't know that Elijah has already come and gone right and they were still looking for because they know that by the scriptures that if the son of man will die and Rise before that takes place there has to be the first coming of Elijah so the scripture is telling us about the compound meaning of Elijah he said that answer said elas truly shall first come and restore all things we know that John the Baptist do not restore all things so God send us William AR Braham to fulfill Malachi 456 and restore all things amen all things were Rest by Malachi for thing so it's a compound two comings of Elijah so when he spoke that and but I say unto you that elas is come already and they knew him not they have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them so once he said that their eyes open and they realized he was talking about John the Baptist so they knew the sequence of the scriptures that before the son of man died and Rise there has to be Elijah first to the Jews in that day and here they are Jesus Christ truly died and Rose up three days and they were sad one day after that they were sad going back Peter was disappointed going back to his fishion they were all disappointed and down that but he has told them that the scripture said that I will never leave my Holy One to what suffer corruption I I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither will I leave him to suffer corruption it means that he will not leave them to to die more than three days and he said I destroyed this Temple and I rais up in the third day he gave them all those scriptures yet when the thing fulfilled right in their time the day that they were living in they miss it even though Peter God by his grace in might Matthew 16 he asked who the son of man is and he said that thou are the son of the Living God we are not Elijah this he said upon this I'll build my church and the Gate of Hell shall not Prevail against it it was revealed to Peter that he was the son of man and he got they have all those things yet because the fullness of the word was not given at that time they couldn't recognize when the thing happened and they were so sad same thing today the scripture repeat itself they were so sad and he said why are you so sad and they began to tell him about what is happening and he behaved like he doesn't know what was going on and he was listening to them and they were preaching to him amen and then he got to a place he stepping and said you are fools and slow of heart to believe all all that the prophet has spoken about himself he rebuked them for their unbelief for taking part of the word and in when the eyes were open braam went on and explained that he was talking about the part of the word concerning their day the scripture fulfillment of their day because Luther recognized the part of the scripture for his day Wesley recognized the part of the scripture for his day Pentecost restoration of the gift when it came Street they recognize the scripture for their day but remember when that Pentecost came in those times it wasn't a fun to be with they were not accepted it was so bad that even the prophet of God his mother-in-law did not want her daughter to be associated with those people it wasn't accepted they were persecuted they were crucified but the moment they organize and become accepted by the whole world it means that the spirit of God has left from them so he rebuked them for not recognizing the part of the scripture they are fulfilling in that present test of his ministry and is the same yesterday today and forever so if you are a true son or a child of God God expect you to recognize exactly you know what it happened in the Luther time that's good for Luther and his time not what happened in Wesley not what even happened in Pentecost but what part the bride is for filling present test right now that's the only way that will please God hallelujah without you being in it you can say whatever you want it doesn't do nothing that gives you courage that give you confidence to step on the word of God and know that God is with you I believe that's what the prophet of God only you recognize he's the one fulfilling that Mal 45 he gave him confidence he gave him Assurance to Mo on perfect faith to move on the word so it is doing the bride to recognize that he she is a wife of Christ she is invisible Union of Christ being united with the word of God for today and he gives you courage and confidence so you're not scared of anyone just like Peter and the rest they were so scared even they ran away when Jesus Christ when they said that you are one of them Peter ran away but when on the Pentecost those said where is Rabbi Jones because that confidence has he recognized what part of the word he was fulfilling so that you recognize that you cannot please God Amen praise God our God is awesome God he's the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah so God is good all the time praise God Amen God is wonderful he's so good he's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen praise God hallelujah amen hallelujah now these disciples should have recognized him they didn't know the scripture here here he then revealed to them notice as he began to go along he revealed to them the scripture promise concerning himself of that age not the scripture promises concerning himself promised in Noah's age not the scripture promis for other ages the scripture promis concern himself for that age that show exactly who he was he be to ask them said why are you so sad why they said are you a stranger here look him right in the face are you a stranger here don't know what happened Jesus of nazare Might approve of God he said what things happen just like he knew nothing about it he just act as as if he didn't know nothing about it but now remember when he begin to speak to reveal them the promise concern himself said don't you know how Christ must first suffer and enter into his glory and then he begin with the scripture from Moses and all the prophets and reveal to them the scriptures pertaining to himself the Messiah what the Messiah was to be what everything if that isn't repeat today he's doing the same and still the Church mops in darkness revealing to them who he is and what he is and so they say well now I believe my church teach there you are you see that's the reason you go back to scriptures set the scripture they've got the truth you get it so Twisted how do you know it the scripture when is the scripture promised for that age amen so it's for the promise for your age not any other age amen and one other thing the disciples even though um Jesus Christ was talking to them on the way to OS he was explaining to them the word for the age thing that was going on but still Their Eyes Were blinded but the woman at the well when exact same thing happened to her even though she was a prostitute married five times about to marry the sixth man taking somebody's wife but when that word was revealed to him he knows the scripture she knows the scripture for the age she knows that we know that when the Messiah cometh he will do these things she cut it right away and R with the script chest so even though her heart her outside look black she looked black outside but there was a light of God deep inside her soul so when that word ignite and she heard that word that light come to what come to pass and that word become so resurrected in her that she caught it right away and ran with the message and said come and see a man who has told me the things of my life isn't he the very Messiah she CAU that attention but the priest looked so Pious on the outside but had black inside the heart so when the same thing was did to the high priest over there they talk against it and they said that you are visel and what they died in their sins for saying that because they were because they were black on the inside and the outside they were deceiving the people because of the law that they were following so when the thing was revealed and he did the same thing they call him of the devil but he said that when the son of man this would will be given to them when it come again in the form of the Holy Ghost one word against it will never even what be forgiven all the world to come so it's not much of the outside it based on the predestinated seed it based on the seed inside if you attribute of God and you are part of God it doesn't matter how you may look bad on the outside before the word comes to you when the word comes to you something new will grab it it will light up come on that Spirit of Christ inside your heart it will come to light amen it's something you you might not even fully understand it no wonder Peter said that where shall we go because the Lord Jesus Christ was trying to what test the people he told them that except you eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood you have no part in me and that time 500 of them they all left it left 72 70 and out of the 70 he told them that even the son of man who is standing here now in heaven and they said what you Joseph s re as a carpenter side how you going to be in heaven and it was so much for them they left and it was left to 12 and he asked them will you also go and Peter didn't even understand it but something in him was a light of God and he said where will we go thou alone has eternal life and they follow that word of God regardless of whatever it was they gave their heart to that word of God Amen even though he tried them but they still something in them will not leave just like Naomi he tried she tried um Ruth and op and make it look so bad and said even now I'm an old lady if I have to go and marry again will you wait till that boy be born and grow and marry him and it was but you know what all the time it was in open heart to go back so when that word was spoken to her she took advantage of that and returned but neomi had purpose in her heart to go or Ruth had purpose in her heart to follow the word to follow Naomi so she said said that your people will be my people where they bury you they I'll bury whatever happen to I follow you to the end she was tried but in her heart she has purpose to follow the word of God so it is today we are going you have been tried back and forth and some of the people that we started the race they are not yet here with us because when the try and those persecution came some of them in their heart they want to go anyways so they use that an excuse to just leave because they were following sometimes by the law and they can't keep up the law again but instead of opening their heart and allow God to come inside and take that burden and live the life through them to become easy they didn't like it that way they want to have power to do it so when the tast when the try came when the Lord tried them a little bit they just ran back but if you check the disciples when they heard the Lord Jesus Christ speaking they become so excited in their heart they wanted to know more about it so when he pretend that he was leaving them the Bible said that they constrain him to not go because they become so excited but the way that we here say don't go don't go follow us and they took them to they took him to the end even though he MaDee pretend that he was leaving them but because that word was so rich in their hearts they wanted to know more sometimes I don't know about when I come to church and the preaching goost and some so it grab my heart like that you don't even see the time you become so consumed with that way the presence of God that I don't want to leave anywhere so they were so excited consumed with the word that they were hearing that they constrain him that abide with this and one other thing when they invited him in into the house he did something he broke the bread a certain way then the eyes got open and they recognized that it was him but before they could recognize that they have to invite him in and so so is you and me yes God is looking into our heart we have to invite him fully in our heart to be our Lord not only our savior to take full control full preeminence in our heart because he knows everything about our heart he knows all our thought the word of God designs our heart and he knows everything about us so we should fully not 99% in invite him in when you are fully inviting in then he take control of your throne he reveal himself to you that's what he's been doing to us we have opened our heart to him so he's fully inside of us reveal himself to us now and then little by little precept upon precept here a little there little all the time that's what he's doing to us but those who has not fully Open the Eyes to them to him they can't understand it they can't catch the revelation because they are basing it on the letter the Bible said the letter kill it but the spirit give life God doesn't care how much you know the written written letter all that he cares about your heart is your heart right not the knowledge the knowledge part is good but God looks beyond the knowledge he looks into our heart so our heart has to be pure he has to be full invitation for him to take full preeminence that's the only thing God wants he doesn't care how much you know the letter the devil doesn't care because when he met the Lord Jesus Christ he knew the letter all the letter the Bible said the Bible said the scripture said the scripture said he said they said said that Al also written Worship the Lord your God and him alone deserve to be worshiped so he know 99% of the word but the devil wasn't the word but the Lord Jesus Christ was the word of God Amen amen so the letter could not what um make um could could not confine him because he was the word when the enemy tried to twist that scripture to him he put him back in his right place so it's you and me that word of God is in you sometimes you don't even understand but something new lights up and you could say it's wrong how do you know it but something in you and when the truth is presented to you your heart will bear record of it you can never be deceived because you are part of him amen if you could not deceive him there he cannot deceive you too amen you are son and daughter of the Living God and the Lord dwells in your heart he's the same yesterday today and forever Our God hasn't changed amen praise God hallelujah amen praise God so what am I trying to say um the same disciples when he they invited him him and the eyes of understanding were open and everything happened remember he told them to what carry in the Jerusalem until the Holy Ghost comes so on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fully came and because they called the revelation of the word and they received a genuine birth Peter was right away able to tell the people that they are not what mad or they have not drank anything he was able to go back and point them to the scripture this is that which was spoken of by Joel he was able to let them know the actions what is taking place in their life at that moment was the Fulfillment of the scripture so it's you and me when the word is fully revealed to you whatever God is doing in the present tense because he's part of you you will catch it am you will know it how I can explain it remember Peter John and the rest they never met Moses they never met Elijah but when they met them in that man transg gration they recognize them oh my so is you and me amen when that word is made flesh that word has been made flesh in you and me when the scripture is being fulfilled you cannot help but catch it Hallelujah you will catch it just like that amen the same way Peter and and the rest of day of Pentecost they could go back and tell them that what is happened to them brother on that day is what that Bible spoke in Joel 2:28 they caught it just like that and ever that time it has been the pattern from that time onwards all those Saints and Daughters of God fulfill and recognize the scripture for their day that's why Luther being part of the whole thing when he was reading the Bible and the judge shall live by faith became so real to him he couldn't help himself but to stand on that scripture amen and brother Abraham when that Malachi 45 Revelation 10:7 all those scriptures became so real to him he couldn't he couldn't do anything but stand fully on it even though some people said that he was mad he was this he that but he's to on it because something in him has recognized what part that he is fulfilling hallelujah amen and it's so sad thank you Lord he's gone back to his reward but people following this word people M but the scripture repeat itself some have gone to um some doctrines Thunder camp this camp that camp this camp that camp but the bride of Christ walk in the middle of the a with a balanc Ministry recognize the path that she is fulfilling they is not looking to the left or the right but she's walking right in the middle of the H and God will reveal him himself to her daily daily and then just like Enoch she's walking with God in step with the revealed word of the hour amen she walks in step with the reveal word of the hour she's not looking back she's not feeding only on the back on the back on the History part she's feeding on the revealed word what God has revealed in the past and what God is doing now the part that he's revealing in the present tense and it's so clear to her what part of the scripture she's fulfilling and unlike the Pentecostal people they are so blinded expecting that the Raptor will come with the way they expect they send Africa they going to be trumpet then they have Clos the way demonstrate is been funny but the Bible said the Lord himself shall desend with with a shout that shout the message going on right now amen and the bride of Christ knows has recognized that the Rapture is a process leading to an event amen and we know we are in the process he said that your eyes your heart your heart CH didn't it he said that your soul this lighted didn't it so when that where you first C that Revelation that rapture start already and you a process going to lead to an event that's right and we are in that process but people are blind as blind can be they pointed back to the to the to the history they point it back to the future and they don't know what he the Lord Jesus Christ is doing now is the present stage of his ministry thank you Lord and the people are looking in the future but we are walking in step with a revealed word of the hour and he the same yesterday today and forever amen our God is Awesome hallelujah praise our God he's God that never changeed and one other thing the bride of Christ has recognize that is God himself leading us back it's not we ourselves we have got to that place that God is the one doing everything all that he want is what a surrounded heart and then he comes and so with you and direct your footsteps and lead you to himself because remember in the Pentecost Pentecostal age was the seventh angel but when it come the bright age it's the Mighty Angel himself as our pastor has been teaching us that he left on his throne and came back the second coming of Christ reveal all the seals so there's nothing left again but the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ remember some people are looking for oh just like the disciples they were telling the Lord oh um if you say that you're going to die and rise up again then why the scripture said Elijah must first come so some people are looking forward oh before the Rapture comes this will happen that will happen that will happen and they looking they putting all in future but they forget to realize that when the Lord says on the day that he died on Calvary so many scriptures amen fulfill bum bum bum bum bum bum and all of them started like that and the sad part of it is that those pares who were singing The Psalm 22 my Lord my Lord why have you forsaken in all those scripture concerning him they were singing the Psalms and for doing exact same thing to the son of man and they didn't even know that they were fulfilling that part so it is today so many people are denying this word of God they don't know that they are fulfilling and it all say somewhere there has to be what a falling away first and some people have fallen away to the left the right and they don't know that they are what fulfilling the scripture so you are blessed that your eyes of understanding it has been opened up at last thank you and it is you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom for you it is given to them it is not given so we are privileged people and we have to be thankful every day for what God has done for us because he has revealed to us his Plan of Salvation thank you Lord that alone is more than anything else the world can give you there's nothing that come close to what God has done for us as I said on the other time if we were to be transported back the time of Jesus you have you shall receive his word one time I went to um a man's a man house those I was looking for a place to live in lakes sha I went to a Pretender place and I Tred to build give them my application and I happened to have one of the message book in my hand I think it was my pocket or something I didn't do it consciously so the man saw the book he said hey where do you have this book do you believe in williamon Braham I said yes he said me and my brother I'm a preacher Pentecostal brother my brother believed everything the message that believe but me I don't believe it so we don't talk about about the scriptures and I told him unconscious I said unconsciously I said if we were to be living in the time of John the Baptist will you have recognize the message of John the Baptist if you have been transported back if you could have catched what John the Baptist was saying and follow that word you would have recognized what God is doing now now in William Maron braham's Ministry and the man looked like me like he didn't say anything again why someone like John the Baptist he was so sure that the Messiah was on Earth in his time he was so confident and the Lord revealed it to him so it's something that nobody can give it to you only God can take you to what to that Mo only can move you to that top of the pyramid nobody can put himself over there that thing is left in God's hands but if you are part of it unconsciously you don't fight it it's just easy you let go and let God hallelu have his own way and all those things fulfill in your life because it's not you doing it last week I was at the B shop and we were just talking and I happened to tell the Baba he said um Phillip how do you keep your marriage what's the secret how long said you be married for about maybe 20 years now so how can you live in 20 years the same woman how how do you keep your marriage how how is it and I said my friend I don't have no secret I don't have no ER anything good I do all that I know I've committed the hands of God and it's God that is keeping that marriage in this time of age nobody can keep your marriage unless God keep it not only your marriage everything that we are doing in this time the pressure and the environment and everything around is not by power or by your might but by my spirit says the Lord is the Lord keep us we cannot keep ourselves he's the one keeping our children he's the one keeping our job he's the one keeping everything we have that's right because in this age it said that Prophet said all the people will go like this except those who have the true revelation of the word of God because it's a pressure age it's a pressure but because so he lives in us he lives in you we shall overcome because he that overcame is in you and it's in me amen and one other thing you are Justified as if you've not even done it in the first place so you don't have to worry about anything because the only thing that the enemy can put on you if your mistakes that you die in this flesh he always going to come back but you have to recognize that you didn't do it in the first place you are Justified Justified means that you have not even done it somebody was talking about the story about a lady who said um a lady who said that she's very spiritual she see things she see that and the pastor just asked her what do you see about me in my past the lady said she went she checked she said I did not see anything he said that's right because there's nothing in my past that God remembers God doesn't remember nothing that you did in the past that was wrong so don't focus on that it's in the sea of his forgetfulness amen so don't even worry about your mistakes let's move on let's move on thank you Lord amen because must remember the Bible said they without us will not be made perfect with all those things that you read in the Bible you see Abraham you see Isaac you see Joseph all those characters how big and how we Reverend them they are also waiting on us amen God has reserved to himself the best for the last we are the last race that we have the Bon to finish the race so let's what with the patience the race said before us said forgetting all those things behind let's move on Amen trust God that he run the race through us to finish the race amen he's the same yesterday today and forever so that's all I have for tonight our eyes of understanding he has open up at last part two amen
