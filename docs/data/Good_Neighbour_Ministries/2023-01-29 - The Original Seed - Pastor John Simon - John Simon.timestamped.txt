[45:48] with the understanding
[45:52] and God said
[45:55] let there
[45:57] be light
[45:59] and there was light
[46:02] and then we'll go to verse 11.
[46:05] and God said

[47:34] me I what about you as he's made a
[47:39] change in your heart as he made a change
[47:41] in your life
[47:43] so that you know are indeed that when
[47:47] you're reading out to this word uh it's
[47:50] not real the figments of religious
[47:53] imaginations
[47:55] that were put in there because there's
[47:57] so much misinformation that's being put
[48:00] out trying to mold and my the minds and
[48:04] hearts of the population
[48:06] to cause them to buy their their
[48:10] products which brother Branham already
[48:13] said their economy is based on the seat
[48:16] and lies even in selling a product they
[48:20] will tell lies to get you to buy that
[48:23] product
[48:23] he gave his own example where they tell
[48:26] you if you buy this certain soap and
[48:28] just drop a bit of it in the water and
[48:31] just shake your clothes in there just a
[48:33] little bit and take it out if white as
[48:35] snow is clean and like that he said I
[48:38] did it over and over and it did take out
[48:42] but it wasn't clean right so it's lies a
[48:46] half-life half truth just try to hold
[48:49] this medicine will take away your
[48:51] problem you will be completely a
[48:53] pain-free and trouble like that and then
[48:56] they lower their voice and said and
[48:58] while you're taking it you may also have
[49:00] a burst plane you may also have this
[49:03] ache your blood pressure may go up you
[49:06] may suffer from blindness
[49:09] you see so so it will heal or help the
[49:14] one thing over here but then it costs
[49:17] about 10 or 20 other problems then
[49:19] you're going to run for a medicine for
[49:21] the other problem over there and then
[49:23] that causes another 10 more uh problems
[49:25] and you and they keep you like that
[49:27] woman going in circles
[49:30] trying to find an answer to the problem
[49:33] until you spend all that you have and
[49:37] your blood dry so the doctors are doing
[49:41] the best they can the good and honest
[49:44] ones other than that they're just
[49:46] practicing on you and they have their
[49:48] practices and they invite you to come
[49:50] for them to practice on you and you have
[49:53] to be aware of that that doctors don't
[49:56] heal
[49:57] they only treat
[49:59] and they leave that the rest of it is
[50:02] God has to do it not that we don't need
[50:05] them but you need to be aware of of all
[50:08] that for the glory of God praise God God
[50:11] is wonderful listening praise the name
[50:13] of the Lord we give him all the glory
[50:15] now we want to look to uh we want to
[50:18] look to the word and end the word as we
[50:20] were talking about Genesis 1 as we are
[50:23] reading from it and what we can see
[50:26] there are what we should see is that God
[50:29] is now into his creative Acts before
[50:34] Genesis 1 this great
[50:38] Eternal being by himself alone was there
[50:42] and being there alone and having these
[50:46] thoughts in his mind and things he
[50:50] wanted to do and to accomplish then this
[50:55] great being got to the stage where he's
[50:58] about now to do or his creative acts to
[51:04] move from thinking to doing
[51:07] and now we read from the word how that
[51:11] and God said
[51:14] and again Genesis
[51:17] 11 12 he said and God said and between
[51:22] those verses you will see over and over
[51:25] again it repeats and God said that's why
[51:29] Hebrews 11 nothing that was made was not
[51:34] made without the word and without him
[51:37] was nothing man because God had to say
[51:40] it before it could come to be amen
[51:45] praise the Lord so we understand God
[51:48] said and when he said that was the word
[51:52] is that right now you understand when I
[51:55] say the word that's the the logo
[51:59] switches already the Eternal Word who
[52:02] God is that was there before all things
[52:05] were in eternity
[52:08] now uh now God said and it become what
[52:13] the spoke broken word
[52:16] the spoken word now remember before that
[52:20] there was no word there was no word
[52:24] nobody had any word now we hear talk
[52:28] about the word and the word and the word
[52:31] see but uh we understand that God is the
[52:36] one who really was sowing his word if
[52:42] you will go to Matthew chapter 13 verses
[52:47] 24 to 30.
[52:51] Jesus tells this is not the parable of
[52:54] the sower who just sowed the seeds that
[52:58] is his part of it or just after he spoke
[53:01] that then he spoke this saying a certain
[53:04] man went out and he saw good seed he
[53:10] sought good seed in the land
[53:13] and when that man had finished sowing
[53:17] good seed in the land then
[53:21] the enemy came his enemy came and also
[53:26] now sowed seeds tears Tears In the Land
[53:32] everywhere and they be all began to come
[53:36] up right and as they began to come up
[53:39] and he came back to look he saw some
[53:43] were his Original Seed that he had
[53:48] planted and the others were nothing but
[53:52] tears
[53:54] amen so then he said now who has done
[53:58] this and that enemy has done this uh you
[54:04] know when the question was asked of him
[54:06] well who has done this you planted the
[54:09] field he answered an enemy has done this
[54:12] and even today we know an enemy has done
[54:17] this because they and my topic is the
[54:21] Original Seed
[54:24] because the Original Seed is the seed
[54:28] that God sowed because in type he was
[54:31] really speaking of himself
[54:34] you see when God types use Abraham he
[54:38] was really letting us who has thoughts
[54:41] and imaginations and reason to be able
[54:44] to have an object we can look at and to
[54:47] understand what he did what happened to
[54:51] him and what he was going to do with his
[54:54] promise his promises to the church he
[54:57] wanted us to know that by an up a
[55:00] physical human object lesson in time
[55:04] that we can understand clearly what he
[55:07] was fixing to do right now as humans we
[55:10] will have to take a pen and draw
[55:12] pictures on a board but God did that
[55:14] with literal human beings prophets
[55:16] Patriarchs and flesh them out there that
[55:19] there could be for signs and so on that
[55:21] we might be able to see graphically and
[55:25] understand if we can understand what it
[55:28] is that he had pictured in his mind now
[55:32] become a reality in a human being acting
[55:36] out what was his thoughts on the inside
[55:39] so we know God sought the original seeds
[55:44] because there was no seed before he
[55:47] sowed so what they what his enemy sword
[55:51] were seeds of discrepancy
[55:55] seeds that can create confusion
[55:58] now remember there was only one God and
[56:02] there is only one true God
[56:06] so God has no competition there was no
[56:12] body there because he stood alone no one
[56:17] else on that same level there's no one
[56:19] like him no one even close to him he the
[56:23] greater him the only one none other like
[56:27] him
[56:28] and therefore we understood that he saw
[56:32] the Original Seed
[56:36] and because he saw his Original Seed all
[56:40] the other seeds were put out by the his
[56:44] enemy which we understand is the devil
[56:48] Lucifer that one who was cast down upon
[56:53] the earth and the cry went out War unto
[56:57] the inhabitants of the Earth for your
[56:59] adversary the devil has come down and he
[57:02] knew what that his time is short so you
[57:06] watch out because your enemy has now
[57:08] come to Earth so here we are faced with
[57:12] these scenes of discrepancy but the
[57:15] seeds of discrepancy are there to
[57:18] distract and take away the minds and the
[57:21] hearts of the people that they will
[57:24] wreck not recognize that there are
[57:28] genuine original seeds in that field
[57:32] which he said the field is the world and
[57:36] here we are they're our original sins
[57:40] that were planted there or placed there
[57:43] by God and the enemy sword confusing
[57:47] tear seeds around you that people will
[57:51] find it hard to recognize the original
[57:55] seed that was there amen hallelujah now
[57:59] we understand that God's original seed
[58:02] was his word
[58:04] and his word was in his mind which was
[58:09] part of him remember he is the pillar of
[58:13] fire he is the logos he is all of it and
[58:18] we are in him part of it before the
[58:21] foundations of the world and so there we
[58:25] are in God if you want to if you want
[58:28] the pictures imagine that just like uh
[58:30] great atoms within the great Autumn
[58:33] right not Adam but the great atom uh in
[58:38] there and they're all in there whirling
[58:41] around us one with him but that's where
[58:45] they are as the word seed of God God's
[58:50] original word seed that he was fixing to
[58:54] send down or plant upon the Earth that
[58:58] we have here now amen praise the name of
[59:01] the Lord and we find he those thoughts
[59:04] or seed thoughts were in his mind but
[59:08] those those thoughts were there as real
[59:11] as we know real to be but there were
[59:15] unexpressed
[59:18] they were not spoken there were not
[59:21] known to us yet as the word as being
[59:26] part of the world they were only in his
[59:29] thoughts but now he is in the middle of
[59:32] his creative Acts and God said now that
[59:39] word that was in him has now expressed
[59:43] it now has the ability to become
[59:46] whatever he wants it to become
[59:50] if he wants a tree if he wants a moon he
[59:53] wants a star he wants a life whatever he
[59:56] wants it now has the ability to become
[1:00:00] what he wants it to be from the moment
[1:00:03] God said it came into expression it came
[1:00:08] into it now is able to manifest the time
[1:00:12] frame doesn't matter what it took a
[1:00:14] hundred years a thousand years a million
[1:00:17] years God said and it was so doesn't
[1:00:23] matter how long whether when he said you
[1:00:26] are to be in this church that church
[1:00:28] change the other Church age you want to
[1:00:30] be in whatever churches when he said
[1:00:33] only then you were expressed and then
[1:00:37] you were expressed you are now able to
[1:00:40] manifest what you are for his glory and
[1:00:44] for his honor praise God until that time
[1:00:48] you are all the way in him just like all
[1:00:52] the time I was in my dad amen all the
[1:00:55] time I was in my mom but when the time
[1:00:59] came for me to be expressed I Was Made
[1:01:02] manifest naturally spiritually in the
[1:01:05] same way we are made manifest by the
[1:01:09] revealing of the world we have made
[1:01:12] manifest as true believers who believe
[1:01:15] the word of the Living God hallelujah
[1:01:19] amen and now because it's expressed it
[1:01:23] could be made manifest
[1:01:25] because God already told it
[1:01:29] God said let there be light he told them
[1:01:32] to let like be made manifest I want you
[1:01:35] to go forth as light I want this to go
[1:01:38] forth as a seed I want this to go forth
[1:01:41] in this way and God said and it was so
[1:01:44] nothing can stop that now God said it
[1:01:47] was so it is so God said and it is so
[1:01:51] praise the Lord hallelujah if we find
[1:01:54] here that God said that these seeds
[1:01:59] spoken word not natural seeds now
[1:02:02] because these are received thoughts that
[1:02:06] were in him and he took those seed
[1:02:09] thoughts not to go over but you realize
[1:02:12] what I'm saying and put them in the
[1:02:15] earth in humans flesh that they could
[1:02:19] now be expressed and they could express
[1:02:23] themselves in that uh in that
[1:02:27] situation or condition that they're in
[1:02:31] they could now Express themselves amen
[1:02:34] here upon the Earth because they are to
[1:02:37] bring forth he said they must bring
[1:02:39] forth seed after its kind
[1:02:43] who see this where
[1:02:46] in itself
[1:02:48] now the tree doesn't have to know it the
[1:02:51] sea don't have to know it but the seed
[1:02:53] it has its own life in itself
[1:02:57] and that life that is in there is able
[1:03:00] to reproduce itself praise God and he
[1:03:04] said it this way in John 1 11 I believe
[1:03:07] if you will find that John 1 11 and 12
[1:03:10] put that up on the board back of us
[1:03:13] praise God we find out that he said that
[1:03:17] he came to his own and his own received
[1:03:20] them not but as many as received him to
[1:03:24] them gave he the power to become the
[1:03:29] Sons and Daughters of God they are now
[1:03:32] becoming what they're supposed to be
[1:03:34] what they're supposed to manifest what
[1:03:37] they're supposed to declare and make
[1:03:39] known to the world and to the people
[1:03:42] because God already said what they are
[1:03:45] supposed to be praise God do you believe
[1:03:48] that you come with you with the built-in
[1:03:52] power source to become the sons of God
[1:03:55] to become the doctors and of God to
[1:03:58] become the children of God hallelujah
[1:04:01] because that's what God Said in his word
[1:04:04] amen and I believe it with all my heart
[1:04:07] amen Galatians 3 16.
[1:04:11] now to Abraham and his seed were the
[1:04:16] promises made amen hallelujah now you
[1:04:21] understand that God actually is showing
[1:04:24] that he used Abraham there to
[1:04:28] demonstrate what he was doing
[1:04:30] spiritually speaking amen Abraham's
[1:04:34] natural seed praise God and His seed
[1:04:37] were the promises made now to who were
[1:04:41] the promises men the promises were made
[1:04:44] to Abraham and he has seen praise God
[1:04:49] hallelujah amen now Genesis go back to
[1:04:53] Genesis 1 he's saying he says now our
[1:04:58] tree you are supposed to bring forth
[1:05:01] seed after your kind so the word went up
[1:05:06] forth to that particular tree or orb or
[1:05:09] fruit or whatever that that's what is
[1:05:12] its purpose that's what it's supposed to
[1:05:14] do is to bring forth there the original
[1:05:17] life that was there in it it's supposed
[1:05:20] to manifest that original life that was
[1:05:24] in it praise God so it's a seed with a
[1:05:28] promise
[1:05:30] it's a seed that comes with the promise
[1:05:33] built into it
[1:05:36] and to fulfill that promise that's
[1:05:40] already within itself
[1:05:42] it's empowered by God to fulfill that
[1:05:45] promise that's within its own self now
[1:05:49] now to Abraham and his seed were the
[1:05:54] promises made he said not to seeds as of
[1:05:59] many but as of one to thy seed which is
[1:06:05] Christ
[1:06:06] now he's talking about this promise was
[1:06:10] made not to just you or me individually
[1:06:14] but the promise was made to this seed
[1:06:17] which is Christ
[1:06:19] Hallelujah and because we were already
[1:06:22] in him
[1:06:24] and because we were in him yet we were
[1:06:28] not mad yet manifest when those promises
[1:06:31] were made Hallelujah then the promises
[1:06:35] which were made to him which always the
[1:06:38] prophet said was also meant to you only
[1:06:42] that you don't recognize it because you
[1:06:45] were there one with him before the
[1:06:48] beginning Before Time begun you are one
[1:06:51] with him hallelujah amen yes sir praise
[1:06:55] God and those promises are ours as long
[1:06:59] as we are in Christ
[1:07:02] outside of Christ no promises no
[1:07:05] blessing nothing God promised you
[1:07:08] nothing but in Christ you are included
[1:07:11] in every promise of himself the word you
[1:07:16] are you receive every promise that is in
[1:07:19] the word if you are in Jesus Christ
[1:07:23] Hallelujah and because we were in him
[1:07:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:29] hallelujah praise God we can raise our
[1:07:33] hands and say praise God thank you Lord
[1:07:36] Jesus amen oh every morning by morning
[1:07:40] you mercies I see Hallelujah Glory God
[1:07:44] Amen so we understand we don't come down
[1:07:48] here to get borned again to get eternal
[1:07:52] life
[1:07:55] Hallelujah I know these things I repeat
[1:07:59] over and over but it must be solidly uh
[1:08:03] rooted and grounded within your heart we
[1:08:06] did not come down here in the
[1:08:08] Pentecostal belief and fashion to come
[1:08:12] here to get eternal life
[1:08:15] we come here already with this seed the
[1:08:20] life the eternal life of God in us
[1:08:24] but we were suffering from spiritual
[1:08:27] amnesia
[1:08:29] because of the unnatural birth that we
[1:08:35] had born in sin and shaped in iniquity
[1:08:38] the promises like a shock and there you
[1:08:41] are and we we just think we like what
[1:08:45] the devil intended we thought we were
[1:08:47] not just another human being another
[1:08:50] another plant growing in the field not
[1:08:53] knowing that you were of the Original
[1:08:57] Seed of God
[1:08:59] and the life of the seed is already in
[1:09:03] it of itself
[1:09:04] and that life is in the seed waiting
[1:09:08] waiting for the hour and the time when
[1:09:11] moisture and sunshine will strike it and
[1:09:14] will come to attention and a life to
[1:09:17] itself recognizing who it is amen praise
[1:09:21] the name of the Lord now we see from
[1:09:23] that we did not our beginnings as not
[1:09:29] from Eden
[1:09:31] we did not come from Eden that's our
[1:09:35] only physical manifestation of our
[1:09:38] physical body came from Edens Origins
[1:09:42] and anything started there must die amen
[1:09:46] but we came from eternity and we are
[1:09:49] going back to Eternity anything from
[1:09:52] eternity cannot die because it's part of
[1:09:55] him and we're going back to Eternity
[1:09:58] where we come from remember this we do
[1:10:01] not start or come from Eden we come from
[1:10:05] eternity we're going back to Eternity we
[1:10:08] come from in God we're going back to God
[1:10:10] that's why we are in the word now praise
[1:10:15] the Lord
[1:10:16] hallelujah glory be to God Amen praise
[1:10:20] God we are just we are just one of the
[1:10:24] original seed
[1:10:26] we are not confused anymore of Who We
[1:10:31] Are
[1:10:32] but we are of the Original Seed as one
[1:10:36] Prophet said and it shall come to pass
[1:10:38] he shall see his seed he will see the
[1:10:42] man manifest Hallelujah he'll recognize
[1:10:45] them Hallelujah glory to God Amen yes
[1:10:49] sir so we were chosen in him before the
[1:10:54] foundation of the world praise the Lord
[1:10:57] hallelujah we were chosen to receive the
[1:11:01] promise for the age whichever age you're
[1:11:04] living in
[1:11:05] and we have received our promise we have
[1:11:09] received Malachi 4. we have believed
[1:11:12] Malachi 4 that this Prophet was sent to
[1:11:16] awaken us to speak the word and waken up
[1:11:20] the life that was already sitting in the
[1:11:23] seed that was waiting to come back to
[1:11:26] its uh come out of its Amnesia come to
[1:11:29] itself and recognize who he it is where
[1:11:33] it come from and where it's going back
[1:11:35] to amen and we believe that with all our
[1:11:39] hearts praise the name of the Lord glory
[1:11:42] be to God hallelujah amen yes sir so we
[1:11:46] have the promise or we came with this
[1:11:50] promise in US
[1:11:52] that we will have we have the birthright
[1:11:55] let me put it that way like Jacob I
[1:11:58] don't want to go through all the types
[1:11:59] Isaac Jacob and so on but they come with
[1:12:03] that promise in them they have the right
[1:12:06] to have a new birth
[1:12:09] they have the right to have an Awakening
[1:12:11] they have the right for something to
[1:12:14] strike that and bring it back to life
[1:12:17] because the life is already waiting
[1:12:19] within itself praise the Lord and
[1:12:22] whatever outside excess it had whether
[1:12:25] it's Pope whether it's skin whatever
[1:12:28] it's going to throw it all off because
[1:12:31] it now has to manifest itself the word
[1:12:34] doesn't matter what kind of life we had
[1:12:37] what kind of life we live what kind of
[1:12:39] mistakes we made when the spirit of God
[1:12:42] strikes the seed within and that seed
[1:12:45] begins to manifest it breaks and busts
[1:12:48] and casts off all the carnality all the
[1:12:51] flesh all the desires of the world it
[1:12:54] begins to break that thing away from us
[1:12:56] amen
[1:12:57] hallelujah amen we may love the drinks
[1:13:01] we may love the smoke we may love the
[1:13:04] women we may love the gold we want to
[1:13:06] bury ourselves in Fame and Fortune
[1:13:09] that's good that's marvelous in the
[1:13:11] natural world that's all they have after
[1:13:14] that they're dead they're gone they're
[1:13:16] burnt up it's over with but we are here
[1:13:19] with eternal life
[1:13:22] we are here with the life of God in us
[1:13:25] amen we are well you see that's why he
[1:13:29] said don't you know you live in Two
[1:13:31] Worlds why because he was he was the son
[1:13:36] of man right just like you are you are a
[1:13:40] son of man so you are in flesh but at
[1:13:44] the same time while you know you're
[1:13:45] living here as a son of humanity amen
[1:13:49] you realize there's this other part in
[1:13:52] you that is really the Sons and
[1:13:55] Daughters of the Living God so right now
[1:13:57] you see this in Heavenly places in
[1:13:59] Christ while you sitting on this pewd on
[1:14:02] here listening to the word of God here
[1:14:04] because you are trapped in the uh
[1:14:06] imprisoned in this body right now until
[1:14:09] God is ready to take you out of here but
[1:14:13] blessed be the name of the Lord we
[1:14:15] recognize our present stage of Duality
[1:14:19] until we go back to the Oneness with God
[1:14:23] total Harmony one with the father and
[1:14:25] man coming from God and going back to
[1:14:28] God Amen praise God not that you're not
[1:14:31] that spiritually right now but the
[1:14:33] fullness of that you're going to walk
[1:14:35] into praise the Lord so it's I
[1:14:37] understand that praise the name of the
[1:14:39] Lord glory to God Amen yes sir we give
[1:14:43] him praise amen glory to God Amen
[1:14:47] Hallelujah so therefore
[1:14:50] we see the manifestation of the one seed
[1:14:55] leaving its first stage and going into a
[1:15:00] tree or a herb or fruit tree whatever
[1:15:03] and then it goes into its many membered
[1:15:06] body stage where it starts bearing fruit
[1:15:10] it's the same thing
[1:15:12] it's the same seed but when you look now
[1:15:14] there is many many many on the on the
[1:15:17] tree in the form of fruit and all the
[1:15:19] fruits don't have the same shape even
[1:15:21] though it's the same fruit they all
[1:15:23] shaped different and everything else
[1:15:25] like that but they are there because now
[1:15:29] it has moved to the stage where it's now
[1:15:31] a many membered body
[1:15:34] Hallelujah and this seed has now become
[1:15:39] the seeds amen the seeds multiplied in
[1:15:44] the form of God hallelujah amen so the
[1:15:48] promises was made to the one Original
[1:15:52] Seed and by doing that it was made to
[1:15:56] all the seeds that were in him
[1:15:58] it was made to him the man as well as to
[1:16:03] the wife now continue
[1:16:07] he said not unto seeds as of many but as
[1:16:12] of one until thy seed which is Christ
[1:16:17] hallelujah amen to him were the promises
[1:16:21] made glory to God those promises were
[1:16:25] made to him praise God as of one amen
[1:16:31] enter thy seed which is Christ and
[1:16:35] Galatians 3 29
[1:16:38] and if ye be Christ
[1:16:41] then are ye Abraham's seed
[1:16:46] and heirs to that promise
[1:16:49] you are ears of the promise
[1:16:53] praise the name of the Lord I am an heir
[1:16:56] of my father
[1:16:58] hallelujah it's like automatic praise
[1:17:01] the lord it's just he himself maybe
[1:17:04] gonna have to exclude you if you're not
[1:17:06] one of his but other than that we are
[1:17:09] Heirs of our heavenly father praise God
[1:17:13] Amen and there is where the devil tries
[1:17:16] to mix it up right there because he said
[1:17:18] see
[1:17:19] all all Abraham's natural seed was the
[1:17:24] promises made to them amen he says
[1:17:28] there's a lot of people say they're a
[1:17:30] Jew but he says that that's not what God
[1:17:33] is saying or what the Bible is saying
[1:17:35] not if you call yourself a Christian
[1:17:37] makes you a Christian
[1:17:40] because the devil has impersonated
[1:17:43] Christianity to such a degree that by
[1:17:47] your Humanity you can't discern or
[1:17:49] differentiate the seeds
[1:17:52] the devil has got them to impersonate
[1:17:55] Christianity with its acts and actions
[1:17:58] that that by that he can deceive your
[1:18:02] right sight he can deceive your senses
[1:18:05] of hearing seeing smelling action
[1:18:08] everything he can deceive you completely
[1:18:11] amen but praise God so we have senses
[1:18:15] but now we come to the point that we
[1:18:19] don't even put our full trust in these
[1:18:21] five senses that we have our senses are
[1:18:25] in this Sixth Sense the fullness of the
[1:18:28] word
[1:18:29] when all these other senses seem to fail
[1:18:33] us and we don't know what else to do
[1:18:35] that sense kicks in and God's word
[1:18:38] manifests itself in us and through us
[1:18:40] that's why he said when you go before
[1:18:43] Great Men judges and governors and Kings
[1:18:46] he says him that I will not take what
[1:18:48] you're going to say because the father
[1:18:50] that is in you will speak the word
[1:18:53] hallelujah doesn't mean he's going to
[1:18:56] quote from the Bible but before you know
[1:18:58] it you say something
[1:18:59] uh and that little something that comes
[1:19:02] out to you just cuts everything they say
[1:19:04] away uh like that amen you know I've
[1:19:07] told the story of a brother I know
[1:19:10] simple brother uneducated brother but
[1:19:13] full of the love and grace of God
[1:19:15] uh and uh he had a car and it was
[1:19:20] running very well and God blessed him
[1:19:23] financially where he was able to buy
[1:19:25] another a brand new car but the first
[1:19:28] car he had wasn't old it was a very good
[1:19:32] condition used car because it was a
[1:19:35] marriage he's the only one driving it
[1:19:36] and he very responsible and another
[1:19:39] brother uh wanted to get that car or
[1:19:43] trick him out of it for his son-in-law
[1:19:46] or something like that and went there uh
[1:19:49] to him one night and they were speaking
[1:19:51] in the restaurant parking lot which was
[1:19:53] dimly lit and uh he asked him for the
[1:19:56] car and he says no I'm not I'm not going
[1:19:59] to sell you the car I'm not going to
[1:20:00] give you the car I'm going to keep it
[1:20:02] and they got mad and before he annoyed
[1:20:06] they took a pipe and whacked him in his
[1:20:10] face and broke his teeth and and put
[1:20:13] people called the police police came on
[1:20:15] the scene charges were LED and the case
[1:20:18] went to court and everything else so the
[1:20:21] judge gots up there of course and and
[1:20:23] says and now let me know what this case
[1:20:26] is about and the lawyers begins to talk
[1:20:28] and says well and such and such in the
[1:20:32] night of November so and so this is you
[1:20:34] know this my client went to get this buy
[1:20:38] this car from this person and
[1:20:40] altercation took place and the person
[1:20:43] claims that they were hit with a metal
[1:20:48] type which broke all their teeth and now
[1:20:52] they're they're claiming that that
[1:20:55] should be taken care of they should be
[1:20:56] paid and recompensated and so on so on
[1:20:59] so uh and uh I would like to dispute
[1:21:02] that your honor because on on that
[1:21:05] particular night we find out there was
[1:21:08] no moon
[1:21:10] and so there was no Moonlight and there
[1:21:13] were no Garden parking lot there was no
[1:21:16] electric light
[1:21:18] so uh I'm saying to the client whom we
[1:21:22] have sitting now in the chair you know
[1:21:25] for questioning
[1:21:27] um now he spun around suddenly and said
[1:21:29] how can you claim that my client hit you
[1:21:33] with an iron pipe when it was dark and
[1:21:37] no one could see in that darkness no way
[1:21:40] could they see what their were hit with
[1:21:43] and the brother was stunned he didn't
[1:21:46] know or what to say in a situation like
[1:21:49] that because it's true it's dark you
[1:21:50] can't see and then all of a sudden
[1:21:52] before you can think of it because he
[1:21:54] was upset out of his mouth come he says
[1:21:57] you you have to see it to know when I
[1:22:00] hit you on your face or your mouth with
[1:22:03] an iron pipe you're gonna you want you
[1:22:05] know the difference whether it's iron or
[1:22:07] rubber
[1:22:08] even the judge started laughing
[1:22:12] because it's so simple you don't need to
[1:22:16] see the thing to know what it is I
[1:22:19] didn't see it but I felt it and you can
[1:22:22] feel it now if you want to feel it right
[1:22:24] see and the case was thrown out just
[1:22:27] like that just a simple thing out of his
[1:22:29] mouth and God with the prophet the same
[1:22:32] thing that took him for the for the tax
[1:22:34] case and he even thought he lost you
[1:22:38] know so he said well served that's the
[1:22:40] case then I have to pay I have to pay
[1:22:43] this fine he said but you know not
[1:22:45] myself I can pay the fine but I'm
[1:22:47] thinking of all them poor people that I
[1:22:50] gave those things to monies tires this
[1:22:54] that that they're gonna have to pay on
[1:22:56] that and I said oh no he says they don't
[1:22:59] have to pay one cent on it he says yeah
[1:23:02] he says no because they didn't ask they
[1:23:06] they received it as a gift
[1:23:09] they received it as a gift so they don't
[1:23:11] have to pay on the gift
[1:23:13] and then the spirit spoke to him on the
[1:23:15] inside then you don't have to pay
[1:23:17] because all that you ever received
[1:23:19] people just send it to you as a gift
[1:23:22] so he said well then I don't have to pay
[1:23:25] because everything I received I I
[1:23:28] received it as a gift
[1:23:30] unless I in other words less I come out
[1:23:33] the courtroom and you say maybe I cooked
[1:23:35] it up here is my mailbox key you can go
[1:23:38] and check you can go and check my mail
[1:23:41] and check everything yes and it did and
[1:23:44] everything that ever came into him is
[1:23:46] gifts
[1:23:47] and the case was true now then you know
[1:23:49] the story they had to recompensate them
[1:23:53] what he had what he had to get instead
[1:23:55] of him owing they owed him and they were
[1:23:59] I had to pay him for everything that he
[1:24:02] had in Him Praise the Lord aren't you
[1:24:05] glad it's like that brother we we just
[1:24:07] walk around with an abundant we walk
[1:24:10] around Carefree we walk around in Christ
[1:24:14] not worried about anything
[1:24:18] worries problems pressures will come but
[1:24:21] we are assured that there's one in us
[1:24:24] and with us that is more than evil
[1:24:27] because he's already overcome all them
[1:24:30] things that we have ever faced in our
[1:24:32] lives and we may be going to face but he
[1:24:35] has over when you overcome them amen and
[1:24:38] we rest on that amen hallelujah and to
[1:24:42] him was the promises made to Christ
[1:24:47] praise God look how the prophet
[1:24:49] expresses truth he says do you know he
[1:24:52] doesn't expand he doesn't explore he
[1:24:54] doesn't he just leaves it he said do you
[1:24:57] know that original Oak seed or tree that
[1:25:01] was planted in the garden
[1:25:03] all the Ever oak trees we have seen here
[1:25:06] today every one of them regardless of
[1:25:10] what's trained or this or that they come
[1:25:12] from one Original Seed
[1:25:15] and that scene has multiplied itself and
[1:25:18] now we got oak trees all over the world
[1:25:22] what that really was telling us Christ
[1:25:25] to Christ was the promise made but out
[1:25:29] of that one seed all the other seeds
[1:25:32] that were elected in him they are the
[1:25:36] ones that are the beneficiaries and
[1:25:38] recipients of the promises that were
[1:25:41] made to him praise the Lord and we're so
[1:25:43] happy about that not the Abraham's
[1:25:46] natural seed the promises were made amen
[1:25:50] but to the spiritual seed because
[1:25:53] naturally the Elder of Esau and Jacob
[1:25:58] Isa as the Elder that is why Isaac
[1:26:01] naturally when we thought maybe the
[1:26:03] birthright will go to him you see he
[1:26:06] will go to him because that was law that
[1:26:08] was the Jewish way an Hebrew way that
[1:26:12] will pass on to the eldest book God says
[1:26:14] no that's not my way that's what is
[1:26:16] written there in the book but that's not
[1:26:18] what my way is my way is the spiritual
[1:26:23] work right goes to that elected one
[1:26:26] that's supposed to have that promise
[1:26:29] amen
[1:26:30] and though Jacob looked like a renegade
[1:26:34] and a liar and a cheat and a worldly and
[1:26:38] everything else there was something in
[1:26:40] him that God had placed there that knew
[1:26:44] it's about the time for him to wake that
[1:26:46] up
[1:26:47] and for Jacob to recognize who's who he
[1:26:50] is amen after 400 years God said I made
[1:26:55] a promise to to Israel Abraham's seed
[1:26:59] and the IRS come for that promise to be
[1:27:02] fulfilled therefore I sent forth my
[1:27:05] Prophet Moses Amen in this hour he sends
[1:27:08] forth this Prophet William Marion
[1:27:10] Branham to fulfill Malachi 4 5 and other
[1:27:14] promises in the Bible to make us aware
[1:27:17] of the hour that we are living in and we
[1:27:20] recognize the hour that we are living in
[1:27:22] praise God and we give God the glory and
[1:27:25] the praise and the honor for his word
[1:27:29] Romans 4 16 we find that God has given a
[1:27:35] sure promise to all of Abraham and his
[1:27:39] fat seed not just natural seed but the
[1:27:44] Seed of Abraham that has the same
[1:27:47] attributes attitudes of faith of always
[1:27:51] believing God of always trusting in his
[1:27:55] word that resting upon Revelation
[1:27:58] because Hebrews 11 by faith Abraham
[1:28:03] believed God I repeat to you what I've
[1:28:05] already said Well because most don't
[1:28:08] think about that there was no Bible when
[1:28:11] Abraham believed God
[1:28:13] somebody tells Abraham believe the word
[1:28:16] of God does he believe God he believed
[1:28:19] what was not written word but the
[1:28:21] unwritten word it was the voice of God
[1:28:24] that spoke to him
[1:28:25] and he recognized that was the Eternal
[1:28:28] God speaking to me here and he believed
[1:28:31] the word of God and received it
[1:28:34] God is saying the same thing to you even
[1:28:36] though we have now written word this is
[1:28:39] good it was supposed to point you in
[1:28:41] that direction it was a school Master to
[1:28:46] lead you to Christ
[1:28:48] the law was a school Master to lead the
[1:28:51] Jews to Christ physically but they they
[1:28:55] saw in love with the school school
[1:28:58] Master that's when admiration of the
[1:29:01] teaching ability of that school Master
[1:29:03] to this day they have stayed with that
[1:29:06] school Master but the Bible says as Paul
[1:29:09] taught they should have gone from the
[1:29:11] school Master into their way of life for
[1:29:15] what they're supposed to do Manifesto
[1:29:17] purpose they should have gone on into
[1:29:19] Christ that they could fulfill the word
[1:29:21] amen we hope praise God but we have now
[1:29:25] not moved from the law we still
[1:29:28] recognize like Paul did and all Jesus
[1:29:31] did we still recognize the law he still
[1:29:34] practiced live the law went to the
[1:29:37] center do all them things they were
[1:29:39] asking for and better than they were
[1:29:41] doing it but yet he says it's not the
[1:29:43] law they said so and so but I say unto
[1:29:46] you
[1:29:47] I know what the law says about this
[1:29:50] woman should be condemned but there is a
[1:29:52] higher law than that amen there's an
[1:29:55] 11th commandment you need to pay
[1:29:57] attention to amen oh praise God daughter
[1:30:01] go and sin no more amen your
[1:30:05] given thee
[1:30:11] the voice today and recognize the hour
[1:30:14] that we are living in we are not bound
[1:30:17] and we are not tied up we are not
[1:30:19] imprisoned by the Lost regulations of
[1:30:22] men neither are we bound even by this
[1:30:27] written word we see here because the
[1:30:30] unwritten word is beyond that amen it's
[1:30:33] Unwritten praise God hallelujah we are
[1:30:37] of the original sin
[1:30:39] I know what I just sounded with some
[1:30:41] with some like blasphemy but just like
[1:30:44] it did to the Jews back there something
[1:30:46] like blasphemy when Jesus said I know
[1:30:49] what Moses said but this is what the
[1:30:52] spirit of God is revealing and
[1:30:54] manifesting in this day and in this hour
[1:30:56] Hallelujah and we are resting upon the
[1:30:59] word of God for this day amen hallelujah
[1:31:02] amen
[1:31:04] and Paul puts himself on all or the
[1:31:08] other believers under the designation
[1:31:11] because he says Abraham I'm quoting
[1:31:14] brother Branham here who is the father
[1:31:17] of us all then he goes on to not only
[1:31:21] narrow down his definition but rather to
[1:31:25] finalize his his uh his definition
[1:31:29] Galatians 3 he identified the seed
[1:31:33] singular with Jesus
[1:31:35] and counted the sea children from Jesus
[1:31:40] as the children of the promise
[1:31:44] do you believe you that it's you he's
[1:31:47] talking about you're looking in the word
[1:31:50] and saying mama that's me oh daddy
[1:31:53] that's me I'm seeing myself in the
[1:31:56] mirror I'm recognizing myself in the
[1:31:58] word hallelujah oh my yes sir they're
[1:32:03] Children of the promise Hallelujah and
[1:32:06] do you know that promise have to do with
[1:32:10] the election
[1:32:12] the birth the chosen of God hallelujah
[1:32:16] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:32:19] and that is exactly what we have been
[1:32:22] saying that those who are and listen
[1:32:25] what we are called here now
[1:32:27] those who are of that Royal Seed of
[1:32:31] Abraham
[1:32:33] Hallelujah we come from the King
[1:32:37] I said we come from the King of Kings
[1:32:40] we are Kings and princes and Priests
[1:32:44] from the presence of almighty God
[1:32:47] hallelujah they just give you this
[1:32:49] action that you're gonna dress up like a
[1:32:51] priest you have to dress up like an
[1:32:53] Archbishop and then you are a priest you
[1:32:55] have to go to a certain school and be
[1:32:57] educated
[1:32:58] there are certain way to have their
[1:33:00] slant their point of view on this word
[1:33:03] before you are certified by them not
[1:33:07] ordained by God but certified by them
[1:33:09] that you are indeed a registered and
[1:33:13] recognized priest and and so on before
[1:33:16] him God is saying no no no no no no no
[1:33:18] no get away from that get back to me and
[1:33:22] my word hallelujah if you are of that
[1:33:25] Royal seed act like royalty
[1:33:28] act like a son of K of God act like a
[1:33:33] son of a king
[1:33:34] amen you are not there to beg them for
[1:33:37] truth you are the very sources of Truth
[1:33:41] for this hour for the word is going
[1:33:43] through you now amen hallelujah blessed
[1:33:48] be the name of the Living God hallelujah
[1:33:50] that's why brother Brandon said I'd
[1:33:52] rather a man that rather just make a
[1:33:55] mistake go make a mistake than one who
[1:33:58] is just trying to be so perfect thinking
[1:34:02] that he ain't gonna make no mistake just
[1:34:03] be yourself
[1:34:04] yeah let's be who you are and then God
[1:34:08] now knows what got your brethren to well
[1:34:10] no no what needs to be correct what to
[1:34:13] pray for what you walk around trying to
[1:34:15] think that you're you're Hail Mary or
[1:34:17] something like that no sir you just got
[1:34:20] to let the Holy Spirit have his way with
[1:34:22] you
[1:34:23] and if you're the Royal seed the true
[1:34:26] seed of God you're not going to be
[1:34:27] outlandish you're not going to be up but
[1:34:29] if you that's why it says again in jail
[1:34:31] but if we sin if we make a mistake if we
[1:34:35] trespass amen God says all you got to do
[1:34:39] is confess your faults one to another
[1:34:44] Hallelujah confess your faults to God
[1:34:47] hallelujah wash your rope in the Crimson
[1:34:51] Fountain and recognize that you are the
[1:34:54] sons and daughters of the Living God
[1:34:56] Hallelujah the old Psalm that says we
[1:34:59] are the sons of God we are the sons of
[1:35:02] God we washed our robes in the Crimson
[1:35:05] Fountain we are the sons of God we are
[1:35:08] the children of the Living God because
[1:35:10] we washed ourselves Hallelujah
[1:35:13] we are the ones that come from Edom
[1:35:17] these that wash their robes white in the
[1:35:21] blood of the Lamb hallelujah amen and
[1:35:25] there's still Power in the Blood
[1:35:27] that's the bloodborne we can the blood
[1:35:30] grows stronger every day
[1:35:33] you put wine in a bottle it don't get
[1:35:35] weaker and weaker it gets more powerful
[1:35:38] more potent because it's there praise
[1:35:41] God the longer it goes they pay more
[1:35:44] money to get uh three thousand uh year
[1:35:47] old bottle of wine
[1:35:49] amen but man made wine three thousand
[1:35:52] year old might end up being sour
[1:35:54] but the one that Jesus gives Hallelujah
[1:35:58] when they're drinking they say man why
[1:36:00] you kept this wine to last
[1:36:03] why you kept this group till the last oh
[1:36:06] why you kept them until every we wanted
[1:36:08] to have them earlier no but you would
[1:36:11] have too much time to do a whole lot of
[1:36:13] impersonation and make things even worse
[1:36:15] so I let them come into the end here so
[1:36:18] that they can display the word and
[1:36:20] before you know it they're up and
[1:36:22] they're out of here by the grace of God
[1:36:24] we are the sons and daughters of the
[1:36:26] Living God Amen yes sir oh praise God so
[1:36:31] the promise has to do with election
[1:36:35] or of God's choosing
[1:36:38] and that is exactly what we have been
[1:36:41] saying those who are the Royal seed are
[1:36:44] the elect of God are the predestinated
[1:36:48] of God the foreknown of God they were
[1:36:55] the ones that were in the mind of God
[1:36:58] and His Thoughts Hallelujah in very
[1:37:02] plain language the true bride of Christ
[1:37:05] was in the mind of God
[1:37:09] eternally
[1:37:12] eternally
[1:37:13] though not expressed
[1:37:16] though not experts how do you express
[1:37:19] yourself
[1:37:21] you speak
[1:37:22] and your spoken word is the expression
[1:37:26] praise God and so this spoken word is
[1:37:32] the Original Seed
[1:37:33] but even if you stop there you have to
[1:37:36] got a revelation beyond that that before
[1:37:39] that became spoken word to be expressed
[1:37:43] it had to be the word in him part of him
[1:37:47] the great purifier amen blessed be the
[1:37:51] name of the Lord and that part of it was
[1:37:55] sent down we're going to touch that a
[1:37:57] little bit here praise the Lord and move
[1:38:00] on from here by the grace of God
[1:38:02] hallelujah do not express until each age
[1:38:07] came forth in their designated and
[1:38:11] decreed season in other words that seed
[1:38:14] could not be expressed manifested until
[1:38:18] the season and I explained that and the
[1:38:22] age that they are supposed to manifest
[1:38:24] came into being
[1:38:27] because God wouldn't put you to be afoot
[1:38:30] when it's up here now in let's say the
[1:38:34] Pentecostal age of speaking and you were
[1:38:37] trying to go back and try to be afoot
[1:38:39] you're out of sync with the the music
[1:38:42] that's being played while the Saints are
[1:38:45] Marching into glory and trying to get
[1:38:49] out from off the hill and climb into
[1:38:51] heaven and you are not in tune with the
[1:38:54] music you you lost the beat of the great
[1:38:57] composer you don't recognize what is
[1:39:00] happening and there you are so there is
[1:39:02] came forth in their decreed and uh
[1:39:06] season praise the Lord hallelujah as
[1:39:10] each member came forth it became
[1:39:13] expressed
[1:39:15] it became manifest and then it takes its
[1:39:19] place in the body
[1:39:21] what body the body he was building
[1:39:24] Through the Ages
[1:39:26] and you didn't go back and find yourself
[1:39:29] in another part you come into this age
[1:39:32] that we are in now and you are finding
[1:39:35] your part or your place like the stones
[1:39:38] in Solomon building which is another
[1:39:40] type you use each Stone particularly cut
[1:39:43] and placed in that building to Bear a
[1:39:47] certain amount of weight whether they're
[1:39:49] going to be a stone in the foundation or
[1:39:51] they're going to be a keystone here or
[1:39:53] there there were each place there in
[1:39:55] that Temple for God's Divine Purpose for
[1:39:58] his honor but now the temple he says is
[1:40:01] not a natural Temple Solomon couldn't
[1:40:03] build that the 10th Line building is a
[1:40:05] spiritual Temple amen the temple I'm
[1:40:08] gonna build using men and women a step
[1:40:11] of stones to fit that building and then
[1:40:14] the Masterpiece brother Brandon said
[1:40:16] even though they are Stones they need
[1:40:19] God to have spiritual store Nations to
[1:40:22] come and cut and ship and ship that they
[1:40:25] can fit right into the temple that man
[1:40:27] glory to God that's why when the natural
[1:40:30] Temple of Solomon was made he there were
[1:40:33] not shaped he said there was no song of
[1:40:35] hammeran and and a hammer and all that
[1:40:39] something this they were they were fit
[1:40:41] there in such a wonderful way there was
[1:40:44] no sound and it's the same thing now
[1:40:46] it's not using a saw on you or using a a
[1:40:50] whip for using some kind of a scourging
[1:40:53] metal on you but preaching the word and
[1:40:57] when the word Goes Forth and you
[1:40:59] recognize you take your place
[1:41:02] I am not here to put you in your place
[1:41:05] but you are here to hear the word and
[1:41:08] put yourself into that position see
[1:41:11] yourself into the place you are supposed
[1:41:13] to be
[1:41:14] glory to God hallelujah a lot of you
[1:41:17] here are seeing your place are you
[1:41:21] praise the name of the Lord whether I
[1:41:24] speak louder I speak soft it's the same
[1:41:26] thing it's just my own human excitement
[1:41:29] of what I'm seeing and feeling by the
[1:41:33] grace of God hallelujah same for you
[1:41:35] amen praise God hallelujah yes sir
[1:41:38] continue the quotation thus we see this
[1:41:43] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[1:41:49] bride
[1:41:51] so when we make that statement you know
[1:41:54] just oh the spoken word seed bright you
[1:41:56] don't realize you you it's a whole
[1:41:58] sermons in that going back from that
[1:42:01] seed back Original Seed in his mind
[1:42:04] because there's all kinds of seeds
[1:42:06] scattered in the field now you look out
[1:42:08] in the world there's all kinds of
[1:42:10] Christians you go out there the churches
[1:42:11] are jam-packed even the message the
[1:42:13] churches are full with people amen
[1:42:16] putting a message blaster on your brow
[1:42:18] mark yourself and saying I am I am
[1:42:21] marked here with this that I am a son
[1:42:24] around that doesn't do it it's when that
[1:42:27] Mark is in your soul
[1:42:29] and nobody can take it away because you
[1:42:33] recognize that brother Simon didn't tell
[1:42:35] you it and then you just believe him
[1:42:37] what he said amen but it's in you
[1:42:41] because God revealed that to you I am
[1:42:44] one of them
[1:42:46] I am one of them
[1:42:49] said I'm one of them and I can say it
[1:42:51] and believe it with all my heart not
[1:42:54] some imagination of uh you know human
[1:42:56] imagination but the confidence in the
[1:42:59] grace of almighty God hallelujah praise
[1:43:03] God think of it
[1:43:06] the literal spoken word seed bride
[1:43:10] amen though she is
[1:43:13] feminine in designation as you see as a
[1:43:18] wife she is also called the body of
[1:43:21] Christ
[1:43:22] amen hallelujah so it is very apparent
[1:43:27] that she ought to be called that for she
[1:43:31] was predestinated in him
[1:43:35] and came from the same source I was
[1:43:40] eternal with him because we are in him
[1:43:44] praise God hallelujah so we are here
[1:43:47] manifesting the if you want to put that
[1:43:50] where the feminine nature of God
[1:43:52] God has no nature of believing this
[1:43:56] believing or even believing because he
[1:43:58] is God
[1:43:59] he had nothing out there else for him to
[1:44:01] believe on or disbelieve or whatever he
[1:44:03] is God but we being of that feminine
[1:44:07] nature we come here that we can believe
[1:44:10] or disbelieve or doubt or waver or
[1:44:13] whatever that is the feminine nature of
[1:44:17] God and have little fears fearful of
[1:44:19] this fearful of that and that he has to
[1:44:21] quiet that down and said no you don't
[1:44:23] need to fear that I'll take care of that
[1:44:24] I'll do this I'll do that that's the way
[1:44:27] God wants to recognize that he there is
[1:44:30] the great headship to the bride amen
[1:44:34] hallelujah now so we came therefore we
[1:44:38] came from the same source
[1:44:42] Hallelujah and it's now manifesting God
[1:44:45] in a many membered body Hallelujah glory
[1:44:50] to God remember Hallelujah now I'm just
[1:44:53] going to pray see here now when he is
[1:44:56] the word
[1:44:58] came down and came into human flesh he
[1:45:03] was called what this son of God
[1:45:07] right here in this quotation brother
[1:45:10] Branham said by coming into flesh he
[1:45:14] gained the title of being called a son
[1:45:17] is that right it was God himself but
[1:45:20] because he created this body that he uh
[1:45:23] created for himself to live in
[1:45:26] it was a creation
[1:45:29] it was called the son of that eternal
[1:45:32] spirit
[1:45:34] so he gave the title
[1:45:36] of being called a son
[1:45:39] the same with us
[1:45:41] Eternal beings
[1:45:43] but we didn't come as one man
[1:45:46] we came in many membered body from many
[1:45:52] parents many Origins we come in and we
[1:45:56] but we come into flesh
[1:45:58] but the Eternal beings living in that
[1:46:01] flesh Hallelujah gain the title of
[1:46:05] becoming or being sons of God
[1:46:09] he was the son we are now sons and
[1:46:13] others of the Living God Amen I don't
[1:46:16] know if I got true to you there what I'm
[1:46:19] willing to get through but that's really
[1:46:21] what if God is letting us know praise
[1:46:24] the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so
[1:46:28] now
[1:46:29] even as many of the redeemed are now the
[1:46:33] spoken word seed amen manifest in flesh
[1:46:39] praise God and those Eternal thoughts
[1:46:43] now manifest in flesh are the sons of
[1:46:48] God
[1:46:50] by rebirth
[1:46:53] Hallelujah because we were seed before
[1:46:58] we were Reborn
[1:47:01] is that right
[1:47:02] you are seed before you were reborn
[1:47:06] glory to God and because we were seed is
[1:47:11] the reason why we could be quickened
[1:47:15] because you are a sick child of God
[1:47:19] because you are the original seed that
[1:47:22] was in his mind why you can be quickened
[1:47:26] now to come into your Birthright promise
[1:47:30] that you can become aware awake and
[1:47:33] recognize who you are in him
[1:47:36] amen not appealing to your mind not
[1:47:39] appearing to intellectual of
[1:47:41] understanding but the spirit of God
[1:47:43] appeals to something deeper than I can
[1:47:46] explain the prophet puts this way that
[1:47:48] deep calls back to the deep and the Deep
[1:47:51] response
[1:47:52] amen praise be to God hallelujah amen
[1:47:57] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:48:00] could be quickened Amen in because in
[1:48:03] the non-seed
[1:48:05] there is nothing to Quicken
[1:48:08] is that right there is nothing to
[1:48:11] Quicken praise the name of the Lord
[1:48:13] hallelujah and why is there nothing to
[1:48:15] Quicken there is no Gene of God there is
[1:48:19] no germ of God there to Quicken praise
[1:48:22] the Lord if you want to question me on
[1:48:24] that that's why I walk here with the
[1:48:27] literal Pages or the smoke spoken word
[1:48:30] book praise the Lord and praise God he
[1:48:33] says it clearly here today it's page
[1:48:35] 151 or there he says it yes he says they
[1:48:40] could not they can't you can't be reborn
[1:48:43] right glory to God hallelujah I'm
[1:48:46] thinking now of some readings where he
[1:48:48] was saying right after that he says that
[1:48:51] is the reason you cannot be a pig
[1:48:54] and then you say oh I heard the word and
[1:48:57] you now become a lamb
[1:48:59] no you had to be a lamb to begin with
[1:49:03] you had to be of the original seat to
[1:49:05] begin with and the word just recognized
[1:49:08] and causes you to recognize who you are
[1:49:10] you don't take a pig and put him in a
[1:49:13] sheep pen and then call him a sheep no
[1:49:16] his original being in the church doesn't
[1:49:19] make him a Christian you know putting
[1:49:21] him inside the sheep and don't turn him
[1:49:23] into a sheep oh praise God so God's word
[1:49:26] is like that you are Original Seed I
[1:49:30] pray the Holy Spirit get oh take the
[1:49:32] thought and make it clear to you that
[1:49:35] that cannot be changed or erase but
[1:49:38] there's a whole lot of false seeds out
[1:49:40] there scattered by the enemy amen
[1:49:43] hallelujah now we know of course that we
[1:49:48] um come exactly the way that Adam came
[1:49:52] from God as a spoken word seed of the
[1:49:55] Living God Amen but then later he was
[1:49:59] placed into flesh that he could do the
[1:50:02] tilling and the sowing praise is God but
[1:50:04] then we now ended up being trapped in
[1:50:09] flesh praise God we got trapped in flesh
[1:50:12] and God now sends somebody to instead of
[1:50:16] Elohim himself coming and saying let
[1:50:20] there be light
[1:50:22] he sends a prophet
[1:50:24] and he said let there be light it is the
[1:50:28] rising of the Sun
[1:50:30] a prophet comes on the scene he doesn't
[1:50:33] come and say let every seed brings forth
[1:50:37] after its kind but God the spirit speaks
[1:50:41] through the prophet
[1:50:42] and says to you this spoken word is your
[1:50:47] Original Seed amen your mind may not
[1:50:51] fully understand that but something
[1:50:54] inside of you wakes up right away when
[1:50:56] it begins to hear that it strikes
[1:50:58] something in your heart and it
[1:51:00] recognizes its position praise the name
[1:51:03] of the Lord hallelujah amen so that
[1:51:07] Pillar of Fire that came there with and
[1:51:10] on Adam it's the same pillar fire came
[1:51:14] down when the apostles came down here
[1:51:16] upon us came down upon the prophet it
[1:51:20] was not only over his head but a part of
[1:51:22] that was living in him
[1:51:24] Hallelujah it lives in you he lives in
[1:51:28] me he lives in you if you believe the
[1:51:30] word of God you are the lights of the
[1:51:32] world we are the lights of the world
[1:51:35] this darkness of this young hour and age
[1:51:38] that we are living in We Are The Lights
[1:51:40] of the Living God of the world here
[1:51:43] today praise the name of the Lord you
[1:51:45] know it clearly in the word of God we
[1:51:47] said it last week we say it again the
[1:51:50] bride his wife was in him just like
[1:51:52] God's wife was in his mind Adam's wife
[1:51:55] was in his loins and we praise God we
[1:52:00] find out that we were in the world we
[1:52:03] were already in him
[1:52:05] waiting for the hour when he would use a
[1:52:08] prophet to speak the word
[1:52:11] and to gather up all the lost things and
[1:52:14] restoration and all that no praise God I
[1:52:17] I stopped there because you're going off
[1:52:19] to another uh situation I want to go
[1:52:22] directly out of the
[1:52:25] he said now you see
[1:52:27] this seventh seal
[1:52:30] it's the end of the church age
[1:52:34] this seventh seal is the end of the
[1:52:38] church age
[1:52:39] hallelujah it's the End Amen it's just
[1:52:44] you see it's just like my fire in a
[1:52:47] rocket into the air and that rocket
[1:52:50] explodes and it goes up
[1:52:52] and then it explodes again and it goes
[1:52:55] up it puts out five stars maybe one of
[1:52:59] them Stars one of them stars of those
[1:53:02] five stars explodes again and after that
[1:53:06] comes another five stars and it sends
[1:53:10] that all out and it all goes out until
[1:53:13] it begins to fade on out and goes right
[1:53:16] back into that seventh seal
[1:53:19] which is Christ
[1:53:21] he said and then it just ends there
[1:53:25] and that's where we are at we're just
[1:53:27] we're nearing the end
[1:53:29] because we're going back where we come
[1:53:31] from
[1:53:32] Hallelujah all the little Jew drops that
[1:53:35] come down during the night and settle on
[1:53:38] the ground now the Sun is up and it's
[1:53:41] pulling he's pulling us back where we
[1:53:43] come from and we'll go back to where we
[1:53:46] come from hallelujah amen yes sir it
[1:53:50] ends time for this it ends time for that
[1:53:54] it ends time for everything everything
[1:53:57] is now going ending up right into that
[1:54:02] seventh seal
[1:54:05] amen that's the way it is praise the
[1:54:09] name of the Lord hallelujah praise God
[1:54:12] I'm just closing off with a few of these
[1:54:14] things here uh that I have here I just
[1:54:17] want you to see this praise God
[1:54:20] hallelujah oh praise God now uh we know
[1:54:25] that Satan will try to impersonate it
[1:54:29] he'll try to impersonate everything the
[1:54:33] church will ever do
[1:54:35] amen he's tried to do it we notice it
[1:54:38] through the Antichrist but this is one
[1:54:41] thing he cannot impersonate
[1:54:45] there'll be no mimics to this
[1:54:48] you see because he don't know it
[1:54:52] even that statement was just put out
[1:54:54] like that I'm going to throw a whole lot
[1:54:56] of them off because it's not just
[1:54:58] knowing it you might even know about it
[1:55:01] but that's not the point you have to be
[1:55:05] it right and the devil will have to it's
[1:55:09] the same trap he got caught in with boas
[1:55:12] with Ruth there for him to be kinsman
[1:55:15] redeemer he has to take on all the debts
[1:55:20] all the liabilities you have to take on
[1:55:22] everything and he's a no no he back
[1:55:24] right out like now for him he wants to
[1:55:27] impersonate it he wants to be the
[1:55:29] Redeemer and own all of us or God's
[1:55:32] Goods but when he finds out he is going
[1:55:35] to be the substitute he got to pay the
[1:55:37] price he got to go die on a cross he
[1:55:39] back right out he don't want to be no
[1:55:41] kinsman redeemer and that's where Jesus
[1:55:43] as this substitute as the kinsman
[1:55:46] redeemer took that place because he was
[1:55:48] ready and willing to die to buy back his
[1:55:51] own to redeem his own praise the name of
[1:55:54] the Lord hallelujah praise God Amen and
[1:55:58] there's where in the in the in the
[1:56:01] church age book just after what I just
[1:56:03] said if you were to continue you won't
[1:56:05] see he says he he breaks suddenly from
[1:56:07] that and he says you all you see and
[1:56:09] that is why we see it says buy back it
[1:56:13] says redeem he says it says restore
[1:56:17] because this is the hour now when he's
[1:56:20] redeeming restoring and he's buying back
[1:56:23] his own and bringing them back to
[1:56:25] himself praise God he already owned you
[1:56:28] you already in him but now he lost you
[1:56:31] and Satan had control of you in his pawn
[1:56:34] shop but now he's come to buy you back
[1:56:37] with his Precious Blood to pay the price
[1:56:39] amen this is mine I come to claim it
[1:56:42] this is mine she is mine he is mine I
[1:56:46] come to claim them their mind praise God
[1:56:48] hallelujah amen yes sir she that's the
[1:56:53] way it is uh one more thing here one or
[1:56:57] two more here you don't mind this do you
[1:57:00] it's not one o'clock yet
[1:57:03] praise God I think I quoted that end of
[1:57:06] the church age I already said that one
[1:57:09] place here there praise the Lord he says
[1:57:12] here they can impersonate this because
[1:57:14] too impersonate it and it wouldn't be an
[1:57:16] impersonation because if you become it
[1:57:18] you are it there is no impersonation you
[1:57:21] can't impersonate it and so praise the
[1:57:24] lord the devil can't do it so here it is
[1:57:27] now notice this is the end time message
[1:57:33] this seal amen he revealed all the six
[1:57:38] but don't say nothing about this seventh
[1:57:42] amen hallelujah the end time seal praise
[1:57:48] God you hear what it's called The End
[1:57:50] Time seal uh just just listen to that
[1:57:53] he's telling you right plane there the
[1:57:57] time for the church ages are ended like
[1:58:00] we didn't understand at first when the
[1:58:02] angel put us put in the land and on the
[1:58:04] sea time shall be no more people were
[1:58:07] preaching at the end of the world and he
[1:58:09] was just announcing the end of the
[1:58:11] church ages that ended when that seventh
[1:58:14] messenger Come Those Church angels are
[1:58:17] over amen and then Christ himself
[1:58:22] amen he the mighty Angel The Covenant
[1:58:25] Angel the one that led Israel and so on
[1:58:27] uh it comes now to the church amen and
[1:58:31] instead of the it you know like John the
[1:58:35] good friend passing on the letter uh or
[1:58:38] telling you what he said he comes
[1:58:40] himself and he becomes The Interpreter
[1:58:43] of his own word revealing his own word
[1:58:46] to his children
[1:58:48] feeding his own Sheep amen not Peter
[1:58:52] with a key in his hand in Rome saying
[1:58:54] Peter feed my sheep and the revelation
[1:58:57] of it is Peter supposed to stand there
[1:58:59] with the staff and feed the sheep no but
[1:59:02] he was letting you know he is going to
[1:59:05] come himself
[1:59:07] and he's going to feed his sheep and
[1:59:09] then the supernatural effects of the
[1:59:11] mystery of preaching is that when the
[1:59:15] preacher is preaching the word goes out
[1:59:17] but he knows what portion you need
[1:59:21] doesn't matter what secret thoughts
[1:59:23] you're thinking doesn't matter what
[1:59:25] secret need you have that you never
[1:59:27] spoke to any human being the holy spirit
[1:59:29] will still take that word and he will
[1:59:32] just send out that word wherever it's
[1:59:35] supposed to go
[1:59:36] and it meets the needs of the
[1:59:38] individuals
[1:59:40] that need the word not the old dead word
[1:59:43] where you can quote Oh God give me a
[1:59:45] promise if I believe that he will
[1:59:47] prosper me no but when the word become I
[1:59:51] am present tense to you individual and
[1:59:54] God speaks you are certain of God
[1:59:57] because you recognize that he is telling
[1:59:59] you himself and you recognize him in the
[2:00:02] moment
[2:00:03] in the moment that we are living in God
[2:00:06] making himself known praise the Lord
[2:00:09] hallelujah oh thanks be to God Amen yes
[2:00:14] sir oh my then friends you must
[2:00:17] recognize Revelation 10 1-7 at the end
[2:00:21] of that the end of that seventh Angel's
[2:00:24] message
[2:00:25] then all the Mysteries
[2:00:29] of God would be known
[2:00:32] is that right
[2:00:34] at the end of the seventh Angel's
[2:00:37] message it didn't say that while that
[2:00:41] all the missions will be known during
[2:00:43] the ministry of the Seven Angels but
[2:00:45] he's saying here at the end of the
[2:00:49] seventh Angels message all the mysteries
[2:00:53] of God would be known
[2:00:56] how it's going to be known is he himself
[2:00:59] has to make it manifest no one will
[2:01:01] close it I'm just talking now I'm just
[2:01:03] talking with you praise the Lord now you
[2:01:05] understand when the when those disciples
[2:01:07] went and said Lord
[2:01:10] how come it is that we understand
[2:01:13] and they don't understand what you are
[2:01:15] saying he says because unto you
[2:01:19] it's given to know the mystery of the
[2:01:22] Kingdom
[2:01:24] but unto them
[2:01:26] it is not given
[2:01:28] Hallelujah blessed the name of the Lord
[2:01:30] I'm saying that I recognize Paul said
[2:01:35] Peace and Grace be multiplied to you
[2:01:39] through the knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[2:01:44] Christ things like that I just used to
[2:01:46] read Passover quickly because you know
[2:01:48] it's just peace
[2:01:50] and Grace he's telling you the airplane
[2:01:53] as the Revelation begins to break on you
[2:01:58] you'll get more peace in your heart
[2:02:01] Grace in your life it starts to multiply
[2:02:04] itself in your life as though Revelation
[2:02:07] breaks Hallelujah let me put it this way
[2:02:10] you begin to enter into the Believers
[2:02:12] rest
[2:02:14] amen you entered into the believer's
[2:02:17] rest you begin to rest everything on him
[2:02:19] and without him you do nothing without
[2:02:22] him nothing was made that was made you
[2:02:24] begin to rest on the word and do nothing
[2:02:26] you say nothing you don't do nothing
[2:02:28] without him
[2:02:30] because you are part of him and he is
[2:02:33] part of you amen and here he is telling
[2:02:36] them clearly in the word of God that
[2:02:41] unto you is given to know the mysteries
[2:02:44] of the kingdom of the Living God and
[2:02:48] that's wonderful isn't it because that's
[2:02:50] telling you as the word is being taught
[2:02:53] to you for he was teaching them and they
[2:02:57] didn't understand they didn't understand
[2:02:59] for a while what he was teaching
[2:03:01] but then it starts breaking on them and
[2:03:04] they are they've been getting out
[2:03:05] they're worried about them understanding
[2:03:07] they start worrying about the other
[2:03:09] people how come they're not seeing how
[2:03:11] come they're not understanding what what
[2:03:13] we are understanding to be unto you is
[2:03:17] given to know the mystery of the Kingdom
[2:03:20] you have the gift
[2:03:21] you have the gift you come with the gift
[2:03:24] and you to recognize what I'm saying
[2:03:26] here you come with that seed in you to
[2:03:29] recognize me and who I am you come with
[2:03:32] that part in you that recognizes itself
[2:03:35] in me because the Deep causes the Deep
[2:03:38] the word will come to the word amen
[2:03:41] hallelujah like that hey praise God and
[2:03:45] as I teach even in this present tense
[2:03:49] the word and you begin to and continue
[2:03:52] to believe the word and receive the word
[2:03:55] grace is Multiplied to you
[2:03:58] peace is Multiplied to you
[2:04:00] and the word is Multiplied to you
[2:04:03] because the more you see is the more you
[2:04:06] see in the word of God begins to
[2:04:09] multiply until you praise the Lord and
[2:04:12] when you get that you recognize that
[2:04:15] that's the Holy Ghost literally calling
[2:04:18] your name praise the name of the Lord I
[2:04:21] was really trying to find the quotes
[2:04:22] here where you can because some people
[2:04:25] need to profit themselves saying it all
[2:04:28] right so in but you can go to yourself
[2:04:30] book and find it there where you say he
[2:04:33] said the book is only unfolding it now
[2:04:38] it was always there in him but now the
[2:04:42] book is only unfolding it now the names
[2:04:47] are now being called out now now I know
[2:04:52] you're not in a classroom that you have
[2:04:53] to raise your finger up and say present
[2:04:55] no but praise God the holy spirit is
[2:04:58] calling you by your name
[2:05:02] amen hallelujah oh Mary goes to the
[2:05:06] Garden sees the man looks like a just
[2:05:08] looks like a gardener and she says oh my
[2:05:12] oh where have they let my Lord From the
[2:05:16] Moment he said Mary she recognized
[2:05:19] Hallelujah who was calling her name amen
[2:05:23] we recognize who is calling our name out
[2:05:26] of this word amen yes Lord praise God
[2:05:30] forevermore we realize the holy ghost
[2:05:33] that is what the message the use of the
[2:05:35] message in this hour is calling the
[2:05:37] names of the elect
[2:05:39] so that if there is any amongst you that
[2:05:42] haven't recognized who they are that is
[2:05:45] calling those last and lost ones back to
[2:05:50] their position because when the last one
[2:05:53] comes in the whole thing winds up and we
[2:05:56] go back into the presence of almighty
[2:05:59] God hallelujah aren't you glad for this
[2:06:02] hour while the musicians are coming that
[2:06:05] we can recognize that we are now part of
[2:06:09] that Kingdom of the Living God
[2:06:11] I said we're in the kingdom of God
[2:06:14] and we belong to this great Kingdom the
[2:06:18] invisible Kingdom of our invisible King
[2:06:21] praise the Lord I thank God for his
[2:06:24] grace and his love and his Mercy praise
[2:06:28] the Lord because we are on the inter
[2:06:31] internet and this goes out sometimes you
[2:06:35] know I may just want to talk with you
[2:06:36] but I I really can't like that because
[2:06:39] it just goes dispersing everywhere
[2:06:41] praise the Lord so I just have to come
[2:06:44] off from here until that is off and then
[2:06:48] we know the worship and all that goes
[2:06:50] forward but brother sister what a
[2:06:53] wonderful time we're living in
[2:06:55] when the word of God is making itself
[2:06:58] clear
[2:06:59] and it's so plain I see these young
[2:07:02] people just not in their head like he
[2:07:04] said I'll make it so clear that even
[2:07:07] even a child a wayfaring man along the
[2:07:12] way it'll be so plain they'll see it
[2:07:15] they'll understand it amen if it's given
[2:07:18] unto you to know the mysteries of the
[2:07:21] kingdom of God

[2:07:29] original seeds are the Living God may
