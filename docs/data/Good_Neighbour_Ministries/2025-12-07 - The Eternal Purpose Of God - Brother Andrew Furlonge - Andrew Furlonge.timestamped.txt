[2:04] God bless. bless you. Welcome to the
[2:07] house of the living God. As I always
[2:09] say, let's give God an applause.
[2:12] [Applause]
[2:16] It's just a short psalm that I'm going
[2:18] to read. Um, so maybe when I read one,
[2:21] you read the next verse, eight verses. I
[2:25] will lift up mine eyes onto the hills.
[2:29] From hence cometh my help.
[2:32] It's not there. My help cometh from the
[2:36] Lord which made heaven and earth. Psalm
[2:39] 121.
[2:41] He will not suffer
[2:45] thy foot to be moved. He that keepeth
[2:48] thee will not slumber.
[2:52] Behold, he that keepeth Israel
[2:55] shall neither slumber nor sleep.
[2:59] The Lord is thy keeper. The Lord is thy
[3:03] shade upon thy right hand.
[3:07] The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor
[3:11] the moon by night.
[3:14] The Lord shall preserve thee from all
[3:18] evil.
[3:19] He shall preserve thy soul. Let's read
[3:22] the last verse together. The Lord shall
[3:25] preserve thy going out and thy coming in
[3:29] from this time forth. and even forever
[3:33] more. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. God
[3:38] bless you, brother.
[3:39] [Music]
[4:12] to know
[4:14] weaknesses I see
[4:17] in me. They will be stripped away
[4:24] by the power of your love.
[4:32] Holy
[4:34] Ghost, let your love surround
[4:40] me.
[4:41] [Music]
[4:43] Bring
[4:45] me near and draw me to your side.
[4:54] As
[4:55] I wait, I'll rise up like an eagle
[5:03] and I will soar with you. Your spirit
[5:06] leads me on.
[5:10] Why don't we all stand this morning?
[5:12] Sing the second verse. Lord, unveil my
[5:14] eyes. Amen. And Lord, unveil my eyes.
[5:19] Let me see you face
[5:23] to face.
[5:25] The knowledge of your love
[5:28] as you live
[5:31] in me.
[5:38] Lord, renew my mind
[5:41] as your will unfolds
[5:44] in my life and living every day
[5:51] by the power of your love.
[5:56] Everybody say, "Holy Ghost, oh holy
[6:01] ghost,
[6:03] let your love surround
[6:07] me.
[6:10] Bring
[6:12] me near and draw me to your side.
[6:18] [Music]
[6:21] As
[6:22] I wait, I'll rise up like an eagle
[6:29] and I will soar with you. Your spirit
[6:33] leads me on.
[6:38] All the eagles will sing, "Oh, I will
[6:41] soar with you. Your spirit leads me on
[6:46] by the power of your love.
[6:51] [Music]
[6:53] Hallelujah.
[6:54] Praise the Lord. Somebody praise the
[6:57] Lord.

[16:09] free.
[16:11] Thank you for Calvary, Father. Thank you
[16:14] for the blood of Jesus.
[16:17] Thank you, Lord, the love of our souls.
[16:20] What can we say, Lord, but to give you
[16:22] praise, thanks, and gratitude, Father,
[16:26] even though the enemy keeps trying to
[16:30] beat us down, Lord God, but we've come
[16:34] here this morning to worship you, Lord.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; We lift our hands in praise, in honor
[16:40] and glory to the mighty name of Jesus,
[16:42] the name above all names. And Lord, we
[16:46] shall always praise you regardless of
[16:48] the circumstances, Father, because we've
[16:52] been bought with the price. We've been
[16:55] set free by your blood, oh God.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; And so this morning, by coming here,
[17:01] Lord God, we've come to identify
[17:03] ourselves with you, Lord. We thank you,
[17:06] Lord God, for every need that's been
[17:09] brought forth, Lord God.
[17:11] those that have been spoken, even
[17:14] unspoken, Lord God, you know everyone,
[17:16] Lord, and surely, Father, you know each
[17:19] one by name, Lord. So, Lord, we're just
[17:22] asking you to remember your promise. You
[17:25] told us in your word that you are the
[17:27] healer of all our diseases, Lord. every
[17:32] one of your children whom the enemy Lord
[17:34] is has attacked in their health in
[17:38] different ways. Lord, we ask you Lord to
[17:40] extend mercy and grace to them this
[17:44] morning. We bring Sister Deborah before
[17:46] you Lord. Oh God, may your hand reach to
[17:50] her even this morning, Lord, as we
[17:53] extend our faith for our sister and we
[17:56] rebuke that demon that has attacked her
[17:58] body, Lord God. Lord, for we know that
[18:01] by your stripes she was made well. And
[18:04] to everyone else, Lord, may you also
[18:07] extend your touch to them. Father, we
[18:10] thank you this morning. Even as your
[18:12] word would come forth, bless your
[18:14] servant, Lord. Speak to our hearts, oh
[18:16] God. We've come, Lord, empty, broken
[18:20] vessels. Lord, humbling ourselves before
[18:23] you, Lord, saying, "Oh God, feed our
[18:25] hungry hearts, Lord. use your servant in
[18:28] the mighty way. Father, we also thank
[18:30] you, Lord, for our precious brother
[18:33] Mike, Lord, as he continues to surrender
[18:35] himself as a vessel, Lord God, to lead
[18:38] us in worship. Bless him, Lord. Use him,
[18:41] Father, and everyone else. May we all do
[18:44] it for your honor and glory. In the
[18:46] precious name of Jesus Christ, we pray.
[18:49] Amen.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.

[36:13] When I'm in need, I call on the Lord
[36:18] and he hears me. Yes, he helps me. He is
[36:23] faithful
[36:25] and true. He won't forget his own,
[36:32] my companion. Oh my my best friend, the
[36:36] only true God. There's no one greater, a
[36:41] wonderful savior.
[36:44] It's Jesus the lion of Judah.
[36:49] Oh, our God is tremendous. His faith
[36:52] never failth. He'll go through the fire
[36:56] just to save a sinner. Yes, he is

[37:55] miraculous will come into action.
[37:59] Everybody clap for me now. Oh, our God

[38:26] in you and me
[38:28] his glory and gave us the victory. The
[38:32] greatest love story.
[38:37] Amen.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. There's no greater story
[38:42] than this story. And you know what makes
[38:44] it even greater is that it becomes your

[38:54] grace that that he saw me. He saw you.
[38:59] He saw us before the foundations of the
[39:01] world when he was having fellowship with
[39:03] himself. He saw how perfect you would
[39:06] become by the word of God in your day.
[39:09] Amen. Praise God. I'm so grateful today
[39:11] that we're in the house of the Lord and
[39:13] that we've got a special blessing with
[39:15] us today. Amen. We've got our precious
[39:17] brother Andrew who's the pastor back in
[39:20] Trinidad um of a small assembly. What's
[39:23] the name of the assembly?
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Inner veil. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[39:28] We're going into the inner veil this

[39:35] the veil and you can feast all that you

[39:41] of God. It wasn't even permitted at that

[39:48] of. Amen. Praise God. And so this

[43:50] [Music]
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:55] Let's bow for prayer. Loving Father, we
[43:58] are so thankful that you made it so
[44:00] simple for us that all we are called
[44:03] upon to do is to believe.
[44:06] Lord, let that be the confession of our
[44:08] hearts. Lord, I believe. Lord, we
[44:12] believe because you are here and you
[44:14] promise wherever two or three are
[44:16] gathered in your name that you're in the
[44:18] midst to bless bless hearts this
[44:22] morning.
[44:23] even the ministering of your word and
[44:25] all things will get the praise, the
[44:26] honor and the glory in Jesus precious
[44:29] name I pray.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's good to be in the house
[44:34] of the Lord.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated
[44:37] for just a moment.
[44:42] Amen. Regardless of how many times you
[44:44] minister with me, every time you come,
[44:46] you have a little element of
[44:48] nervousness.
[44:51] So you you pray for me, right?
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I kind of feel at home. I've been
[44:57] here a few times and um by God's grace,
[45:01] the Lord have allowed us to be here
[45:03] today.
[45:05] You know, it we came specifically
[45:07] because it's was brother Christopher's
[45:10] uh birthday and um his 70th birthday. So
[45:16] they had spent a couple of months, him
[45:18] and sister with us. So we didn't think
[45:20] that there was a need but it just came
[45:23] came to my mind one night I should go
[45:26] for his 70th birthday because he
[45:29] wouldn't have another 70th birthday.
[45:33] You know many of times we want to do
[45:34] things but we just wait right.
[45:37] I talk English by the way just my
[45:40] dialect is a little strange
[45:43] but I see some Trinidadian and they
[45:44] understand me right
[45:48] and by know I had a friend come Canada a
[45:52] few years ago and he left with a guy
[45:54] accent you know
[45:57] so by God's grace we just you know one
[46:00] of the good things is we have one common
[46:02] message
[46:04] &gt;&gt; and regardless of where you go the
[46:06] message is the same the language is the
[46:09] same is that so you go somewhere and you
[46:13] say only believe wait you're a believer
[46:15] right or don't there are certain things
[46:18] that we say we have our own vocabulary
[46:21] in the message so that makes us one and
[46:25] wherever part of the world and one day
[46:27] there going to be a rapture and we'll
[46:28] all understand each other's language
[46:32] &gt;&gt; amen you won't have to worry and I think
[46:34] accent and dialect them things shall be
[46:36] done away with.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; We thank God for that. You know, I was
[46:40] so appreciative to be here and um the
[46:43] Lord has it that my brother is not with
[46:45] us this morning, but I wanted to
[46:48] appreciate brother John Simon
[46:51] and the standard that he set in
[46:53] transition in a church and I I trust
[46:57] that many people other churches will
[47:00] emulate the pattern or the example that
[47:03] he has laid out. We have lots of
[47:05] churches, a couple of churches,
[47:08] significant churches that have fallen
[47:10] away, divided and become, you know,
[47:14] fragmented because of poor transition.
[47:18] And it really take someone like brother
[47:20] John to have done what he have done. So
[47:23] I really want to appreciate him this
[47:25] morning and commend him from the for the
[47:29] way it has been done in the good
[47:31] neighbors ministry.
[47:33] And I trust that the same love and
[47:35] support that you extended to brother
[47:38] John will be extended to brother Danny.
[47:41] And that is easy.
[47:43] It's easy to love brother Danny.
[47:47] If you ask I love brother Danny
[47:48] something wrong with you.
[47:53] Yes. I don't know you know many of
[47:55] times. Let me talk normal.
[47:58] Help me to relax a little bit.
[48:01] There was um many a times I was telling
[48:04] a church recently
[48:06] when we have problems there's always
[48:08] look for somebody to blame
[48:10] but that don't happen in Canada.
[48:14] There's always somebody else to blame
[48:16] you know you never wrong.
[48:20] Oh okay all right you good you're lucky
[48:23] are good people here bro.
[48:26] We always look for somebody else to
[48:28] blame and you never look and see that
[48:30] you the problem.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me that we church have no
[48:37] love.
[48:38] Well, that's a good thing if the church
[48:40] had no love. You be the one who have
[48:42] love because it had no competition
[48:45] because you leading the group.
[48:48] That's all. If nobody love then you be
[48:52] the one to demonstrate love. You will
[48:54] stand out.
[48:56] But anyway,
[48:58] but we always have, you know, those
[49:00] little things. I was thinking um there's
[49:03] nothing new that I can bring for you
[49:06] because we have had one message that
[49:08] came through a prophet.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't know how preachers
[49:12] this feel is big preachers and they had
[49:14] new revelation. They can't preach
[49:16] without the prophet message.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; There's no revelation that came outside
[49:21] the prophet message.
[49:23] I don't know how you people feel they
[49:25] take it and they get higher revelation
[49:27] and more scientific and the better
[49:30] listen they can't preach because none of
[49:31] them went beyond the curtain that time
[49:35] none of them understood what the prophet
[49:37] said none of them can say I stood over
[49:39] the banister of times and I saw all
[49:41] things from the beginning to the end
[49:44] when Moses wrote he said in the
[49:47] beginning God created when John wrote he
[49:50] said in the beginning was the word and
[49:52] The word was with God. But when our
[49:55] prophet came, he said, "I take you
[49:56] before time began.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; When there was nothing, he God took him
[50:03] there
[50:04] &gt;&gt; and show him the beginning to the end."
[50:08] &gt;&gt; And all that has been hidden up in the
[50:10] mystery of God was made known to us
[50:13] &gt;&gt; through a prophet that God designed and
[50:16] determined
[50:17] &gt;&gt; and have allowed us to enjoy the
[50:19] ministry. Amen.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; So if I'm saying anything is what he
[50:23] would have already said.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; So this morning is just revision
[50:30] and that's easy. When you have to revise
[50:32] something all you don't know. Let me
[50:35] talk Trinidad. All you don't know the
[50:36] thing.
[50:38] What you want me to tell all you don't
[50:40] know it. I mean so much service. So I
[50:43] was thinking about expectations brother
[50:45] Danny. what you expected when you come
[50:46] to church
[50:49] and so many times he said this morning
[50:51] what were your expectations
[50:54] I mean since I've been started serving
[50:57] the Lord I mean I grew up in church my
[51:00] father was a pastor so I was forced to
[51:02] go to church
[51:04] not because I wanted to but he carried
[51:06] to church I had to go Sunday's church
[51:09] but I used to go in the back of the
[51:11] church and sit down and hope he finish
[51:12] pass
[51:16] and his name was for long. So he could
[51:17] have preached long.
[51:21] So I used to go in the back of the
[51:22] church tolerate it until it done. But
[51:24] there came a point in time that God say
[51:27] enough is enough.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; And when God call you, brother, you
[51:32] could run but you can't hide.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; You could do what you want. But God say
[51:36] I want you. I choose you. I've elected
[51:38] you. Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; You either come easy or hard.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; So you choose how you want to come.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; You feel you could give God problem.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Which of you could give God any kind of
[51:51] problem? Oh wait.
[51:55] You feel there's your own man or your
[51:56] own woman. All right. I'll show you.
[52:00] I'll talk to you how God does things. He
[52:03] will allow you the limit, but he cannot
[52:06] lose you.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[52:09] When God choose you, he can't lose you.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; And he will make sure you're not lost.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; So for the predestined, I say thank God
[52:20] that free will is not an option for when
[52:22] you are predestinated.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; You didn't hear me. When you are
[52:30] predestinated, you don't have a free
[52:32] will
[52:34] &gt;&gt; because he choose you. He elected you.
[52:42] All right. My message this morning is on
[52:45] the P. So I was thinking of what what
[52:47] was our expectation. So you get come so
[52:49] many times to church and you would have
[52:51] failed. You get our next ser and you get
[52:53] excited and you get blessed. But did you
[52:55] really get what you wanted out of the
[52:57] service?
[53:00] And you got to come with expectation
[53:02] that God is going to speak to me.
[53:06] and let God direct his thoughts to me,
[53:08] to you
[53:10] &gt;&gt; so that you can leave with a blessing.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; I remember the story, the incident tells
[53:17] about the little girl who was blind in
[53:20] Memphis, right? And she came and she got
[53:22] lost in the crowd and her daddy was
[53:25] missing, right? And she Barra saw her.
[53:28] God brought the prophet out. The prayer
[53:30] line for that day was that campaign was
[53:33] eight days ago and Bram just prayed and
[53:37] slept at everything right by the pulpit.
[53:39] But they had called him out to go and
[53:41] pray for a woman who they thought had
[53:42] died in an ambulance.
[53:45] All right. So he stepped outside and he
[53:47] prayed for her. Abraham said she was not
[53:49] dead but he because he didn't sense that
[53:52] she was dead. He prayed and then you
[53:54] know the she the husband realized that
[53:56] she was back and such like right and
[53:58] then he stepped out of the van and it
[54:00] was this time of separation where the
[54:02] whites the Jim Crow law. So here he saw
[54:05] the hearing this little cry girl calling
[54:09] for daddy daddy
[54:11] right and he looked and nobody was there
[54:14] to help her. So he put himself in a way
[54:17] that she would come and and walk into
[54:19] him.
[54:20] And when as she walked into him, she
[54:22] says, "Sorry, sir." You know, you read
[54:24] it in the prophet's message.
[54:26] And um I I picked it up from that
[54:29] message because
[54:31] refers to that case in the message of
[54:33] expectancy.
[54:35] Now, she came and I just want to shorten
[54:37] it up because it's not my message this
[54:39] morning. She came to the service because
[54:42] she heard of a colored a man who was
[54:44] healed.
[54:46] And she say if I get to that service and
[54:48] I meet that man I am going to be healed.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; And brother say well Gil what you come
[54:56] for? You realize that she blind and and
[54:58] such like and he said in these modern
[55:02] times and I said 1950s right? Think of
[55:05] how far more up the road we are today.
[55:07] He say in these times you you believe
[55:10] that a man or angel come and visit a
[55:12] man. She say yes sir I believe that.
[55:16] And then he asked, "Well, what about
[55:17] your heel?" He said, "Listen." And I
[55:20] shut it up now. You could go read it. I
[55:22] enjoyed reading it all the time. It's
[55:24] like one of my favorite stories. She
[55:27] say, "Stop, stop the talk." Using my own
[55:30] language. She say, "You take me to the
[55:32] man, the healer, and then I will find my
[55:35] daddy after that."
[55:39] &gt;&gt; No, you talk about expectation. She
[55:42] says, "Sir, stop the talk, man. You just
[55:44] take me to the man and I will find my
[55:47] daddy for myself.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Now we are a preacher taught recently on
[55:55] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[55:57] today and forever.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; That same Jesus was the 2,000 years ago
[56:02] is the same Jesus that was with brother
[56:04] Abraham is the same Jesus here in 2025.
[56:10] And you got to believe that if he can do
[56:12] something great then he can do it again.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; And that is my expectation that one day
[56:21] something great is going to happen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; And every service I come to if it didn't
[56:26] happen it will happen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Abraham held on for 25 years. And we've
[56:32] got to hold on believing
[56:34] &gt;&gt; that there's going to be a rapture
[56:38] &gt;&gt; and every one of your needs will be
[56:40] metal.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; That you are serving a God who can
[56:45] supply your need, meet your need,
[56:48] &gt;&gt; minister to your situation.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Don't limit God.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Abraham said that was too much for me
[56:57] when she said that. And he prayed a
[56:59] prayer that he prayed and he and it very
[57:01] simple. He said, "Lord, when you were
[57:03] going to the road on the road of to
[57:06] Golgata on the way to Calvary, you
[57:08] stumbled and fell and Simon ofSirene
[57:11] helped you carry the cross."
[57:14] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Here stands one of his
[57:16] daughters."
[57:18] &gt;&gt; He connect that child to Simon ofSirene
[57:21] 2,000 years ago.
[57:23] My why can't we have the same faith if
[57:26] the prophet can connect after 2,000
[57:28] years connect that child by virtue of
[57:31] her ethnicity.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he did?
[57:37] &gt;&gt; And and she got her healing. He said,
[57:40] "Lord, you understand."
[57:42] &gt;&gt; You know why? She came with expectation.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Her expectation was so high that people
[57:49] were waiting to get healed. Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; There was crowded. You couldn't pass.
[57:55] The prophet couldn't get back into the
[57:57] building.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; But God in his expectation was so high.
[58:01] He take the prophet out from behind the
[58:03] pullpit, bring him outside of the car
[58:06] park.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; So what you think, brother? It's her
[58:12] faith.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; And our faith have to bring God and turn
[58:17] it. He turned the pe preacher around. He
[58:20] turned the pastor up to minister to your
[58:22] need
[58:25] &gt;&gt; so you can leave with a blessing sir.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; We've got to believe that he's the same
[58:31] yesterday.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; He did it for Bimius. He did it for the
[58:35] woman at the well,
[58:36] &gt;&gt; he can do it again.
[58:39] Anything
[58:41] that we have need of believe that God is
[58:44] more than able
[58:47] &gt;&gt; and I we are reaching we God our faith
[58:49] have to rise up to a point
[58:52] &gt;&gt; where we can believe in the impossible.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; What is impossible with God is not
[58:57] impossible
[58:59] with God.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; May God help us. So I certainly
[59:04] appreciate brother Danny and the the
[59:06] church and its administration.
[59:08] Let's work together for one common
[59:10] object objective for the kingdom of God.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, we are this is not our ministry
[59:15] enough. This is God's work.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; I stand before you. I didn't pay the
[59:22] price for your redemption.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Nobody can pay the price. You can't even
[59:26] pay for your own self.
[59:28] [Music]
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:31] &gt;&gt; So, we are not your owners. We are
[59:33] stewards. We are servants. We are here
[59:35] to serve God's purpose.
[59:38] Amen. And you are God's purpose. Let me
[59:42] make it personal. You personally, you
[59:45] are God's purpose.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; When he was walking the road to Calvary,
[59:50] he had you in his mind.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; And we are just here by God's grace to
[59:57] fulfill his purpose.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; My subject this morning is the eternal
[1:00:01] purpose of God. And if the Lord can help
[1:00:04] me this morning, I trust that our hearts
[1:00:07] will be blessed. If we can turn our
[1:00:08] Bibles and may we stand to the book of
[1:00:11] Ephesians, chapter 1, and we'll read
[1:00:14] three verses of scripture.
[1:00:29] Let's call for prayer. Loving father, I
[1:00:33] pray that you will help us Lord. And
[1:00:35] Lord, as we go into your word, we pray
[1:00:38] Lord that you will take charge and grant
[1:00:44] in the midst of everything Lord, we can
[1:00:45] commit ourselves to you. We thank you,
[1:00:48] oh God, for the grace that has brought
[1:00:50] us into your house this morning. And we
[1:00:53] pray that your presence will be felt so
[1:00:56] that, oh God, hearts will be blessed and
[1:00:58] we be edified. and more we leave more
[1:01:02] determined Lord to serve you and to do
[1:01:05] your will. Grant it we pray. Bless our
[1:01:08] precious pastor, brother Danny, and the
[1:01:11] officers of the church, Lord,
[1:01:14] the labor of love, Lord, as they
[1:01:16] continue the legacy of the brother John
[1:01:19] Simon, Lord, and that over the years
[1:01:22] that you would have worked and Lord,
[1:01:25] with one goal in mind is to get souls
[1:01:28] saved,
[1:01:29] Lord, we pray, oh God, that you just
[1:01:32] bless, oh God, and get all the glory and
[1:01:35] the praise in Jesus precious name I pray
[1:01:38] and ask it with thanksgiving. Amen. And
[1:01:41] amen. We want to read three verses out
[1:01:44] of the book of Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:01:47] Uh
[1:01:50] you can follow as I read.
[1:01:53] Having made known unto us
[1:01:55] the mystery of his will according to his
[1:01:59] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[1:02:02] himself.
[1:02:04] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:02:06] of times he might gather together in one
[1:02:10] all things in Christ, both which are in
[1:02:13] heaven and which are in earth,
[1:02:16] even in him, in whom we have obtained an
[1:02:20] inheritance,
[1:02:22] being predestinated according to the
[1:02:25] purpose of him who workketh all things
[1:02:28] after the counsel of his own will. May
[1:02:32] God bless the reading of his word. You
[1:02:34] may be seated.
[1:02:37] Amen. We want to look at the eternal
[1:02:39] purpose of God uh and to state to you
[1:02:44] that God preserves his purpose.
[1:02:48] Amen. There's a caveat that I need to
[1:02:50] put in for you as it relates to God's
[1:02:53] purpose. And may I say this morning that
[1:02:57] you could I I'll just read it out. You
[1:02:59] don't need to show all the slides. I'll
[1:03:01] identify the slides that I want. Back
[1:03:04] home, they have a tendency to read the
[1:03:06] slides and don't listen to me, right?
[1:03:09] There's not I don't want you to read it.
[1:03:11] You could always have access to the
[1:03:12] slides afterwards. But just to share
[1:03:15] with you that God's purpose is greater
[1:03:18] than your comfort.
[1:03:21] That's a strong term.
[1:03:24] God's purpose is greater than your
[1:03:27] comfort.
[1:03:29] And it may seems that God is care. He
[1:03:31] doesn't care less or he's careless. But
[1:03:34] God is not mindful of your comfort. He's
[1:03:37] mindful of his purpose.
[1:03:40] So his purpose is greater than your
[1:03:42] comfort. We're going to look a little
[1:03:44] bit at the life of Joseph and see how
[1:03:47] God had a purpose. Joseph was part of
[1:03:50] that eternal purpose.
[1:03:52] And God did some things to Joseph that
[1:03:56] would seem very harsh.
[1:03:59] All right, perhaps we can rest as I talk
[1:04:02] to you. Joseph was plucked out from his
[1:04:05] family. He had 10 brothers who didn't
[1:04:07] like him,
[1:04:09] right? And they sold him, took him, and
[1:04:12] they were going to kill him. And one
[1:04:13] brother said, "Don't kill him. Let me
[1:04:15] sell him." And they sold him into
[1:04:16] slavery. And it might seem that it is
[1:04:19] harsh, but even getting out from under
[1:04:23] his father's home and protection and
[1:04:26] everything else, the comfort of his home
[1:04:28] was God's purpose.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Because God had a greater purpose than
[1:04:34] him just staying where he was, as you
[1:04:38] would see later down the road. So your
[1:04:40] God's purpose even supersedes your
[1:04:44] ambition or dreams.
[1:04:48] If you had gone according to your own
[1:04:50] plans and wishes, I wouldn't be in
[1:04:53] Canada today because my brother
[1:04:55] Christopher would have been living in
[1:04:57] Trinidad.
[1:04:59] Are you with me?
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; You would have been somewhere else, but
[1:05:04] your ambitions, your desires may have
[1:05:06] been something else. And I want you to
[1:05:08] apply it to yourself and to see that
[1:05:10] when God is working for your life, he
[1:05:12] uproots you.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:16] Amen. He may even cause what might
[1:05:19] appear as suffering
[1:05:21] or trials or testings.
[1:05:24] And you're wondering why God is allowing
[1:05:27] it. But God has a purpose.
[1:05:31] Before I the day before I traveled, I
[1:05:33] got in a a vehicular accident. I just a
[1:05:36] fender bender. A little thing. I was
[1:05:38] driving out. The road was abs had my
[1:05:40] mind absolutely clear. I was driving at
[1:05:43] I say like a hearse, you know, in Trinab
[1:05:46] we call it damn funeral and you're
[1:05:48] driving slow. That's how I turn out on
[1:05:50] the road onto a main road. I just taking
[1:05:52] my time and I don't know where this car
[1:05:54] came out of nowhere and hit the front of
[1:05:57] the van and I was so upset. But I was
[1:06:00] wrong, right? I came out and the woman
[1:06:03] said, "But you couldn't wait." But she
[1:06:05] would have had enough time to see me.
[1:06:07] Why she couldn't wait?
[1:06:09] But that's typical Trinidadian woman. I
[1:06:12] don't hope all you don't behave. So if
[1:06:14] you could drive in Trinidad, you could
[1:06:16] drive any part of the world or you come
[1:06:18] and see if I not fall. Anyway, and I was
[1:06:22] like and then we started talking. She
[1:06:25] wanted to exchange information and such
[1:06:27] like and and she said, "Well, what do
[1:06:30] you do?" I say, "I'm a pastor." And she
[1:06:32] stopped. She said, "Just yesterday, I
[1:06:35] was telling my mother, I don't want to
[1:06:37] go back to church. I don't even want to
[1:06:39] pray and I don't even believe there's a
[1:06:41] God and all of that. She said, "God
[1:06:44] wanted us to meet." I said, "Yes, ma'am,
[1:06:47] but not by accident."
[1:06:53] And I said, and I I just want to tell
[1:06:56] her, it just come out my mouth. Not by
[1:06:57] accident. And we get to talking and I
[1:07:00] said, "Listen, you need to go back to
[1:07:02] church." And she said, "You know,
[1:07:03] really," and then she started talking
[1:07:04] where she come from and a whole set of
[1:07:06] things. She didn't forget the accident,
[1:07:08] but she started talking on what her
[1:07:11] needs and what she had been telling her
[1:07:13] mother just the day before. I said,
[1:07:16] "Find yourself back." Well, that is I
[1:07:18] said, "Get back to church and get into a
[1:07:20] relationship with God."
[1:07:22] So, so I'm telling I was upset so much
[1:07:25] and I'm telling my daughter, my young
[1:07:27] daughter about it. She said, "Daddy,
[1:07:30] ain't you to say all things has worked
[1:07:32] together for good? Why you getting on
[1:07:34] like that?
[1:07:36] She say if you don't pass the test now
[1:07:38] you'll get it again.
[1:07:42] So my own daughter preaching and you
[1:07:45] feel that God give you a test and he
[1:07:47] give you the right to behave anyway. God
[1:07:49] will give you another test
[1:07:52] until you pass it.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; So many of times you are tested to see
[1:07:57] your reaction.
[1:08:01] All you know the test of shut your
[1:08:02] mouth.
[1:08:05] All you never hear the test called shut
[1:08:07] your mouth. Oh bro,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; you give me liberty to talk here
[1:08:13] tonight. Yeah.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; There are many times God just want to
[1:08:17] see you stay quiet. Okay, let me talk
[1:08:19] proper Canadian. Stay silent.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; But you know what? You must talk. You
[1:08:28] must say something. Come on.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; You must express your feeling.
[1:08:34] You know people. She said that my
[1:08:37] neighbor said that is you you know but
[1:08:40] not me you know. I had to tell them my
[1:08:42] mind.
[1:08:44] We had to most people know give them
[1:08:46] peace away mine. At the rate they give
[1:08:49] mind they will give away all their mind.
[1:08:52] If every time you give them peace your
[1:08:53] mind and one day you will have no mind.
[1:08:57] But it's a good thing. We should lose
[1:08:59] our mind so that we may have the mind of
[1:09:02] Christ.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; They abused him. They did everything.
[1:09:07] And he opened not his mouth.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; But we must talk. And when we don't
[1:09:15] talk, I think you have to start texting
[1:09:19] and messaging everybody and telling them
[1:09:22] how you feel and what is your opinion.
[1:09:26] Only Trinidad does happen.
[1:09:30] Form your own church,
[1:09:33] your own clique, your own thing inside
[1:09:35] the church to cause problem.
[1:09:38] No, it's all right. I'm good. Why?
[1:09:43] There are directions that are laid down
[1:09:45] to us by the prophet, the word of God in
[1:09:49] our situations.
[1:09:51] But you know, we have to have our way.
[1:09:54] But God allows situations and tests to
[1:09:57] come your way so that we may grow,
[1:10:00] become mature
[1:10:02] and be able to listen. I was going to
[1:10:04] preach a mature on mastering all
[1:10:06] circumstances and brother Christopher
[1:10:08] say I think you preach that here but it
[1:10:10] would have be a good reminder. We have
[1:10:12] got to come to a point that every
[1:10:16] circumstance you've got to master it.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You you bring
[1:10:23] situations under your control.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; You have to be the master of the
[1:10:28] circumstance.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; You can't be flying off the handle and
[1:10:32] behaving immature and fighting and that
[1:10:34] kind of thing. You got to come to a
[1:10:36] realization. Listen, I'm a son of God.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; And you cannot we I don't know. I feel
[1:10:45] at home now. So talking less. We
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; you cannot be flustered by everything.
[1:10:52] Listen, brother Arab has brother Abraham
[1:10:54] give us an example of a slave
[1:10:57] and he repeated it many times right here
[1:11:01] was a slave a boy that came from Africa
[1:11:04] living in America and in the had the
[1:11:07] auctions for slave and he was the slaves
[1:11:09] were up for sale and the buyer when he
[1:11:11] came to the plantation he watched this
[1:11:13] particular boy
[1:11:16] and he say I want to buy him and the
[1:11:19] owner say he's not for
[1:11:22] But he said, "But there's something
[1:11:23] different about him. What is it? Do you
[1:11:26] feed him different? Do you dress him?
[1:11:28] Does he sleep different from the
[1:11:29] others?" He said, "No, he's just like
[1:11:31] all the others."
[1:11:34] But he tells you something. He said,
[1:11:36] "And I've wondered to about him, how he
[1:11:39] conducts himself differently." He said,
[1:11:42] "And I found out that in the land from
[1:11:44] where he come from, he's the son of a
[1:11:47] king. And though he be in America and
[1:11:51] functioning as a slave, he conducts
[1:11:54] himself like a son of a king.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And regardless of where we are, we've
[1:12:02] got to conduct ourselves as we are sons
[1:12:05] and daughters of God.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; You walk like a son, you talk like a
[1:12:12] son, behave like a son.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Don't let a slave override us.
[1:12:18] We can learn from his experience. We can
[1:12:21] learn from his behavior. And these
[1:12:24] things are not documented there for us
[1:12:26] just to for show peace. That has to
[1:12:28] become alive again in Canada.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; In your home, in your life, in your job,
[1:12:35] wherever you go, you are different
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; because you are the son of a king.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; The slavery condition and whatever may
[1:12:43] be happening in a job should not put you
[1:12:46] down. should not depress you. It should
[1:12:48] not oppress you. And you walk like that
[1:12:50] like you.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; No, you got to walk with your head up
[1:12:54] high
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; because you master the circumstance.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; He was mastering slavery
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; and you've got to master every
[1:13:03] circumstance that come your way.
[1:13:09] And don't don't get an a test like mine
[1:13:12] and my daughter tell you or your
[1:13:14] daughter tell you you will get it again
[1:13:17] because God wants you to be qualified
[1:13:21] to be qualified for a rapture.
[1:13:26] You got to have the mind of Christ. What
[1:13:28] would Jesus do? You understand?
[1:13:32] May God help us this morning. So God
[1:13:35] allow things to come our way
[1:13:38] to help us for our development. It
[1:13:40] overrides God's purpose overrides your
[1:13:43] desires. God's purpose control your
[1:13:46] life.
[1:13:48] Brother Abraham was born for a purpose.
[1:13:52] Amen. And brother Arab's purpose was to
[1:13:54] be a prophet. Satan couldn't
[1:13:57] Let me say another. Satan cannot defeat
[1:14:01] God's purpose.
[1:14:03] God's purpose can never be defeated. If
[1:14:06] God has a purpose in your life, you are
[1:14:08] going to rise up.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what come against you.
[1:14:12] What the devil throw at you, you are
[1:14:15] going to rise up. You are going to
[1:14:17] overcome.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; I God's purpose is not dependent. You
[1:14:24] will see God's pro. Didn't the Bible say
[1:14:27] all things work together for good?
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. not some things, you know, all
[1:14:32] things work together for good.
[1:14:34] Everything is under his control.
[1:14:37] So when God had you in his mind, he
[1:14:40] predestinated you because his purpose
[1:14:42] for us is that you would be the bride of
[1:14:45] the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the
[1:14:48] ultimate purpose. You are going to come
[1:14:49] in a position where you are like the
[1:14:52] Bible types like Ruth and Esther and
[1:14:55] Sarah, all of them. You're going to rise
[1:14:57] up. You're going to conduct yourself and
[1:14:59] because you are that's what you are
[1:15:01] called for.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:15:06] to help us to understand
[1:15:08] here was brother Abraham in 1965 and he
[1:15:11] says Lord surely in your word there is a
[1:15:15] scripture or a character that will say
[1:15:17] what my role is. And then in 1965,
[1:15:21] Abraham realizes that he's he opens his
[1:15:24] Bible to Revelation 24 where Abraham
[1:15:27] send his servant Eisa to hunt that
[1:15:30] bride.
[1:15:32] Right?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; And then he realizes, listen, my role,
[1:15:37] all that I've been through my life is to
[1:15:40] choose a bride for the Lord Jesus
[1:15:42] Christ. Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And you think of the things that as
[1:15:47] followed his life and and and all the
[1:15:49] things that the sequence of his life and
[1:15:51] how it how it went. But his real purpose
[1:15:54] was for you
[1:15:59] when Alisa left with camels and such
[1:16:02] like to go down, right? He was hunting a
[1:16:05] wife for for Isaac.
[1:16:08] The favored one was Rebecca.
[1:16:11] So all that God have done for us in this
[1:16:13] day is to through our prophet was to
[1:16:16] bring you and I to attention
[1:16:19] realize now you are the purpose of God.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; This message has come to me
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; to you in a personal way but because you
[1:16:30] are now being married to the king of
[1:16:33] kings the lord of lords
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; you become invisible union you become
[1:16:39] Mrs. Jesus Christ
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; in in at the end of his life say I was
[1:16:48] born the son of Charles and Ella Brham
[1:16:51] right so you may have always thought I
[1:16:53] was Charles William Brham then one day I
[1:16:58] found out that I am Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; What you are going through right now is
[1:17:05] just temporal.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Everything around us, your situation,
[1:17:09] your house, your car, your land,
[1:17:11] whatever you may have is just temporal.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; One day it will be no more. It will have
[1:17:16] no value.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Okay, we put value ministering for me
[1:17:23] from Guyana this morning back home. He
[1:17:25] talk on what is value?
[1:17:28] What really is value? Listen bel this
[1:17:31] message is the most valuable thing that
[1:17:33] could have ever struck the earth.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; You know the value of this message? This
[1:17:41] message will one day give you and I a
[1:17:44] body change.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; The best hospital in all the world put
[1:17:48] together in Canada wherever you live
[1:17:50] can't give a body change.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; You could exercise until now and thy
[1:17:55] kingdom come and nothing going to
[1:17:58] happen. And you're going to get older
[1:17:59] and older and older.
[1:18:02] You could eat the best organic food. No
[1:18:04] this, no GMO, no nothing.
[1:18:08] You're still going to dead
[1:18:12] in Trinidad. They're dead.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Not sir.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; In Canada different.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; None of us.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to talk. So sir, will you
[1:18:25] forgive me? I sorry this thing on air
[1:18:27] you know well it was bet thing and then
[1:18:30] send it when it when it qualified to go
[1:18:32] on stream then put it out anyway but the
[1:18:35] way I'm going live not regarding that
[1:18:38] but not disregarding the fact listen you
[1:18:41] we all are dying
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; then where is value
[1:18:47] what is really value not to be connected
[1:18:49] to the Lord Jesus Christ not to know him
[1:18:51] in the power of his resurrection
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; it's the greatest thing that has never
[1:18:56] come our way.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; And the message that we have is approved
[1:19:00] by God.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; God validated. God put his stamp
[1:19:03] approval on it.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; God was identified with the messenger
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; just to give us the assurance that this
[1:19:10] thing is real. This thing is true.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be another message
[1:19:17] like this message
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; because we are living in the final days,
[1:19:22] the final time in Satan Eden.
[1:19:26] I put it this way. God put the weakest
[1:19:28] of people the believers in Satan when he
[1:19:32] had the best his kingdom is the
[1:19:35] greatest. It can't get better than this
[1:19:36] at all with AI and technology and do you
[1:19:40] know you live you our lives I remember
[1:19:43] I've said it here we live better than
[1:19:45] Queen Elizabeth the first
[1:19:48] Queen Elizabeth bed didn't have air
[1:19:50] conditioning she never take a plane
[1:19:52] right she didn't have car that automated
[1:19:55] and and have the things like we have
[1:19:59] regardless of how much servant she had
[1:20:01] she still didn't have air conditioning
[1:20:02] and refrigeration and all the things we
[1:20:05] We are living this is Satan's Eden.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; It is going to a climax
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; the best that he can give. But that is
[1:20:13] the limit.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; But God put the weakest of his believer.
[1:20:19] You know God is look how God is unusual.
[1:20:23] God's purpose. You know if I had to make
[1:20:26] an enemy I would have make a small
[1:20:27] enemy.
[1:20:29] Are you understanding me?
[1:20:31] Why did God take a devil and make Satan
[1:20:35] and make him equal to himself
[1:20:38] except for for creative ability?
[1:20:41] He was a match for God.
[1:20:46] Are you understanding me?
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; God's enemy is he was the cherubam
[1:20:51] leader in heaven.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; He wanted to ascend higher than God. He
[1:20:54] thought he could have make himself
[1:20:56] greater than God. and he's still looking
[1:20:58] for worship.
[1:21:00] And if it is that he put the God put the
[1:21:03] weakest because God know the weakest of
[1:21:06] my believers. He didn't take Paul and
[1:21:08] David and them mighty warriors. He put
[1:21:10] you and I
[1:21:14] know why he have confidence
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; in you that the weakest of believer can
[1:21:20] defeat the greatest enemy.
[1:21:25] And no matter what he put in your in
[1:21:28] before you, you will overcome
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; because the word of God is resident
[1:21:34] inside of you that I was born to
[1:21:36] overcome.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; You are born to overcomer. You already
[1:21:41] have a head start because the one who
[1:21:42] overcame on your behalf already
[1:21:44] overcome.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Inside of you resides a mighty
[1:21:49] conqueror
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; because God's purpose have to be
[1:21:53] accomplished. Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; And God has put us in this day to defeat
[1:21:58] Satan.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wasn't God who and Satan who came
[1:22:02] to God and on the day of reckoning and
[1:22:05] God tell Satan, "Have you considered my
[1:22:07] servant Job?"
[1:22:09] Why God had confidence in Job? God has
[1:22:13] confidence in us. He put us in Satan
[1:22:15] either
[1:22:16] because he will take his bride to defeat
[1:22:19] Satan
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; because Satan can present anything to
[1:22:22] you and you will turn it on
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; because you have your eyes only for him.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Your eyes are set upon him. Amen. Your
[1:22:33] eyes are set and no matter what comes
[1:22:36] your way, you will overcome.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Say thank the Lord. Amen. I want to
[1:22:43] thank God that I am part of God's
[1:22:45] eternal purpose.
[1:22:48] Many times in our lives, the prophet of
[1:22:50] God says he say uh he want to drop a
[1:22:55] little nugget for you. Slide 12. Amen.
[1:22:59] And that speaks of Joseph when he was
[1:23:01] sent down into Egypt. And I'm telling
[1:23:04] you that God had a purpose because God
[1:23:07] knew had already told Abraham before
[1:23:10] your people will sjourn in a strange
[1:23:13] land for 400 years and I will deliver
[1:23:16] them with a mighty hand.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; That was done in the record. God set out
[1:23:20] the purpose and he say what he's going
[1:23:21] to be.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; So that when the time came that God sent
[1:23:27] Joseph down in Egypt to prepare the way.
[1:23:30] would look at the way and the method
[1:23:32] that God used. Uprooted him from his
[1:23:36] family, sold into slavery, ended up in
[1:23:38] Potifer's house, and then thrown into
[1:23:41] jail.
[1:23:42] Right? But along the way, Joseph was
[1:23:45] always ascending.
[1:23:48] Amen. That even in prison, the bottle
[1:23:51] and the baker who are thrown into prison
[1:23:53] recognized that he had a gift. The
[1:23:56] prison God realized that Joseph was not
[1:23:59] an ordinary person and he put Joseph in
[1:24:02] charge of even the prison.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Why? You will realize one day wherever
[1:24:07] you go because Christ is in you somehow
[1:24:10] you are rising above.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And it is because of your attitude, your
[1:24:15] ability, you become trustworthy.
[1:24:19] Amen. You do what you have to do. You
[1:24:21] are honest and you are straight.
[1:24:24] You can be trusted.
[1:24:26] You God wants people like that. You can
[1:24:29] be trusted. As he told Satan, have you
[1:24:32] considered? And Satan said, well,
[1:24:34] because you cover him and you protect
[1:24:35] him. That's why. And God give him
[1:24:37] limits. There is no test that will
[1:24:39] overcome you. He never gives you more
[1:24:42] than you are able to bear.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Whatever test you are going through
[1:24:46] right now, God is allowing it because he
[1:24:48] know you have the capability to
[1:24:50] overcome.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:54] test will come your way. Listen, it
[1:24:56] doesn't matter what the situation is,
[1:24:58] you have to rise up and overcome.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't be defeated. And don't act
[1:25:04] like you are defeated. Listen, Satan
[1:25:06] threw everything at Job.
[1:25:09] But he never cursed God. All he talk he
[1:25:12] talk, he never cursed God. But God have
[1:25:16] that documented for us that we can look
[1:25:19] at job and if Job overcome we can also
[1:25:22] overcome because at the end of it
[1:25:24] there's going to be a blessing that is
[1:25:26] going to come. May the Lord help us. So
[1:25:29] Joseph was sent down into prison. He was
[1:25:32] thrown into prison and he stayed there
[1:25:34] and instead of coming out as quickly as
[1:25:36] he thought he would have been, he would
[1:25:38] remain another two years. Whatever God
[1:25:41] was doing, he was preparing him for the
[1:25:44] role that he had to come to.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Sometime God has to put us through so
[1:25:49] that we can learn forgiveness.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Remember Joseph's brother, the same
[1:25:54] brother who sold him into slavery, had
[1:25:56] him suffer so many years down in a
[1:25:58] strange land would come one day and bow
[1:26:01] before him and not even know who to whom
[1:26:02] they were bowing. But God the prophet
[1:26:05] said and the Bible shows us that he was
[1:26:08] sending him there for posterity not to
[1:26:11] preserve himself but for generations to
[1:26:14] be preserved.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; All of Israel was preserved in Joseph.
[1:26:19] You know your suffer suffering sometime
[1:26:22] you go through a testing but it's not
[1:26:24] for yourself but it's to prepare you to
[1:26:26] help somebody.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; You can empathize with a brother. You
[1:26:32] can empathize with a sister. You can
[1:26:34] know what they are going through and you
[1:26:36] can feel for them.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; So your test is not may not be
[1:26:40] necessarily for yourself, but it's to
[1:26:42] prepare you so that you can help
[1:26:44] somebody along the way.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; May God help us, friends. Maybe be
[1:26:50] prepared to realize that we are here to
[1:26:52] serve God's purpose.
[1:26:55] Amen. Barraham said in his life story he
[1:26:57] said I wasn't I wasn't I was too much of
[1:27:00] a but God was preserving that gift
[1:27:03] for this day that was altered I was
[1:27:07] determined slightly I was determined to
[1:27:10] do it but it was God that protected it
[1:27:13] for that day here was Abraham he lost
[1:27:16] his wife and he feels a sense of
[1:27:19] responsibility
[1:27:20] albeit the circumstances surrounding
[1:27:23] which he did not go with the colored
[1:27:25] people. You see, God's purpose was for
[1:27:27] you to go with them people.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; But he felt that, okay, the
[1:27:31] mother-in-law said they colored and
[1:27:32] there's a whatever you call holy rollers
[1:27:35] or whatever what is the term trash. You
[1:27:38] read it.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; She called them trash, right? But God
[1:27:42] wanted him to go. That's why when he was
[1:27:44] down the river and the boat was going
[1:27:46] down to the falls, he tell God, he said,
[1:27:48] "Lord, it's not me who called them
[1:27:49] trash."
[1:27:51] You really
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "Not me. He's the his
[1:27:55] mother-in-law says so. But he listened
[1:27:57] to her and you know what happened? You
[1:28:00] know what it cost him? His wife and
[1:28:02] daughter.
[1:28:04] God took them away. And he attempted to
[1:28:06] take his life. And twice, two occasions,
[1:28:10] he said, "But was not me. I was
[1:28:12] determined to end my life." But God was
[1:28:14] determined to protect him.
[1:28:17] So he didn't have control over his own
[1:28:20] life. when he wanted to smoke the pillar
[1:28:22] of fire came in to show that he's a big
[1:28:26] man and a strong man but God was
[1:28:28] protecting his purpose
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and his purpose was identified inside of
[1:28:33] brother Brham
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; when brother Brham was desirous to go up
[1:28:36] he said Lord after the opening of the
[1:28:39] seals you know you would think people
[1:28:40] receive him and all these revelation
[1:28:42] come and he get rejected and he say
[1:28:46] going to be a hunter and go up in the
[1:28:47] mountains and when the Lord give a
[1:28:49] message he'll come Now
[1:28:52] God's telling me say, "Listen, you go
[1:28:54] and do that, you will end up a bomb on
[1:28:56] the street
[1:28:58] because God's purpose is that he came to
[1:29:01] reveal and fulfill Revelation 10:7."
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; And though he want to be a hunter and he
[1:29:06] like hunting and all the nice argument,
[1:29:09] he using to go up and he will come back.
[1:29:11] God said, "That is not how I call you.
[1:29:13] That is not what I want you to do."
[1:29:15] what his desires was wasn't in keeping
[1:29:18] with God's program. And I'm telling us
[1:29:21] this morning, God may have a program or
[1:29:23] a plan for your life. Align yourself to
[1:29:25] the program of God.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Because he will force you to do what he
[1:29:30] want you to do.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; With the one condition at the end of it,
[1:29:37] he knows best what is for you.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; You will receive that he work it out for
[1:29:42] your good. Whenever you are in the will
[1:29:44] of God, there is fulfillment, there is
[1:29:47] joy, and there is peace.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Moses run, Moses uh he tried to do God's
[1:29:56] plan. God said that's not the way. He
[1:29:58] end up in the backside and he said and
[1:30:00] God keep him there for 40 years until he
[1:30:03] was ready. He say ready now Moses come
[1:30:05] let me talk. Don't give God a hard time
[1:30:09] because he had a purpose for you. God
[1:30:11] wants us to come to the state of
[1:30:13] maturity where we can be directed by
[1:30:16] him, where we can be led by him.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do all the way my savior
[1:30:22] leads me. What have I to ask beside? Can
[1:30:25] I doubt his tender mercy? Who through
[1:30:28] all through my life has been my guide?
[1:30:31] When God guides you, he is sure to be
[1:30:33] blessed.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; It doesn't give you all the comforts of
[1:30:37] life. It might be harsh circumstances.
[1:30:40] Like I said, Joseph went in prison.
[1:30:42] Abraham had to to go go through the hard
[1:30:45] test, the rugged test. We sometime feel
[1:30:48] that Abraham's life was easy. It wasn't
[1:30:50] easy. Let my say this before even if you
[1:30:53] are a young Christian, the Christian
[1:30:55] life is not a bed of roses.
[1:30:58] There are going to be battles. There
[1:30:59] going to be strife. There are going
[1:31:00] people come against you. You're going to
[1:31:02] get persecution.
[1:31:04] But in all of that, you can praise the
[1:31:06] Lord.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; In all of that, you can glorify God. In
[1:31:10] all of that, you can say, "Thank you,
[1:31:11] Lord Jesus."
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; And there's a peace that comes from
[1:31:16] knowing God.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Well, we realize what is real value.
[1:31:22] Real value is not how much we have on
[1:31:23] this earth.
[1:31:25] I am I'm not dis disregarding or telling
[1:31:28] you to give away all that you have,
[1:31:30] right? But use it for the kingdom of
[1:31:33] God. Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And put value where it really
[1:31:36] belongs.
[1:31:38] But real value is in winning souls for
[1:31:41] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; One soul won. Abraham said the value of
[1:31:46] a soul is 10,000 worlds.
[1:31:49] You can't put value to 10,000 world. I
[1:31:51] know one world. I know Canada or Ontario
[1:31:53] or whatever. You know, all the world
[1:31:56] combined a soul is more valuable than
[1:31:58] that.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Your soul is more valuable than that.
[1:32:03] It is precious.
[1:32:05] And if you can by God's grace encourage
[1:32:08] one another to serve the Lord to keep
[1:32:11] pressing on.
[1:32:13] That's why there is power in prayer.
[1:32:15] Many people don't realize the Abraham
[1:32:17] said prayer is greater than an atomic
[1:32:19] bomb.
[1:32:22] You get down on your knees. You can the
[1:32:24] devil tremble when you pray.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; The great Satan when he start to pray,
[1:32:29] oh my, there you go again. You know why?
[1:32:32] The kingdom start to shake.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; One brother, one sister in prayer. And
[1:32:38] if we can get together, if two shall
[1:32:40] agree touching anything, it shall be
[1:32:42] done.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Let's move, man. Let's get together with
[1:32:46] one objective. Let's get another soul
[1:32:49] saved. Let's encourage somebody to the
[1:32:51] Lord, a brother or sister, whatever may
[1:32:53] be happening in their life. Reach out.
[1:32:57] Amen. Call someone. Love someone.
[1:32:59] appreciate the grace of God in our
[1:33:01] lives. Abraham said, "I was determined
[1:33:03] to do it." He say, "I could not say that
[1:33:06] I was any good, but it was God's grace,
[1:33:09] amazing grace, that kept me from doing
[1:33:12] those things." He say, "I wanted to do
[1:33:14] them myself, but he just wouldn't let me
[1:33:17] do it." Why is he saying that? Listen,
[1:33:20] there are things we would have done. Do
[1:33:22] you know it's the grace of God that have
[1:33:24] me standing here?
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Do you know it's the grace of God that
[1:33:27] have you in this house this morning?
[1:33:30] There are people who are better than I,
[1:33:31] better qualified, better merited, and
[1:33:34] more good. And and in my words, they're
[1:33:36] nicer than we.
[1:33:38] They live good lives. They they they're
[1:33:41] sincere in what they do. But God leave
[1:33:43] them and choose you.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; And it is grace that choose you and
[1:33:49] brought you into his house
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; so that you can feast on the living word
[1:33:54] of God. Thank you.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; The prophet call it the unfailing body
[1:33:58] word of the son of the living God. That
[1:34:00] this word gives us life. This word that
[1:34:03] we are feeding on will one day bring our
[1:34:05] body change.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; You know what it mean?
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Sarah and Abraham was given a promise to
[1:34:11] go to have a child. When MelchzDC came,
[1:34:14] Amen. that promise was in fulfillment.
[1:34:18] MelchzDC has come again.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, he
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; when he said who is this MelchzDC? He
[1:34:25] knew that MelchzDC was in him.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; It was not a man. It was a man voice
[1:34:31] being used, a man talking. But it was
[1:34:34] MelchzDC in him
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; that he was expressing the mind and the
[1:34:39] thoughts of God
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; so that we can bring us connect us to
[1:34:44] the plan and purpose of God.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; That God wants to have his preeminence.
[1:34:49] Do you know what it means? that the same
[1:34:52] we look at brother Abraham's life and
[1:34:53] the kind of miracles that accomp that
[1:34:56] same God wants to reside inside of you
[1:35:00] and I
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; doesn't he said the bride has thus said
[1:35:06] the Lord
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; that whatever she says that's how it's
[1:35:10] going to be
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; because you are now the wife of the Lord
[1:35:15] of the harvest
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; and you are acting on his behalf
[1:35:21] My
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Abraham said, you know, when you read
[1:35:26] the title of the message, who is this
[1:35:27] Melzdc? You tend to feel that Barra is
[1:35:30] talking about God and giving the the the
[1:35:33] attributes and the characteristic of
[1:35:35] God. But do you know Abraham spend more
[1:35:37] time the essence of that message is
[1:35:40] letting us know who we are.
[1:35:45] You know what our prophet tell us? We
[1:35:47] used to think we get saved, right? Well,
[1:35:49] I get saved. I accept the Lord. It's not
[1:35:51] you accept the Lord or not. Is the Lord
[1:35:53] accept you?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; He choose you.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; You didn't just come into the message
[1:36:00] just so you know is God had you,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; brought you into the message.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; If God had to root uproot you like he
[1:36:08] did some of us from Trinidad and the
[1:36:10] Caribbean so that you could come in the
[1:36:12] message.
[1:36:13] I was telling I was sharing with brother
[1:36:16] Christopher my brother. I said God had
[1:36:18] to take you out from an environment
[1:36:20] where it would be easier for you to
[1:36:22] serve the Lord.
[1:36:24] Ah
[1:36:26] despite all the cold weather and the
[1:36:28] winter
[1:36:30] I had said to him Danny I will never
[1:36:34] come back in this country in December
[1:36:36] and here I am again.
[1:36:39] But it is God's purpose.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; God has a reason why I'm here today. And
[1:36:45] God had a reason why he took him out and
[1:36:47] placed him in an environment
[1:36:50] where he could be directed by God and
[1:36:53] God's purpose can be achieved in his
[1:36:55] life.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And God's purpose was greater than his
[1:36:58] own plan and in his own thinking.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; But I dare say that God have blessed him
[1:37:04] abundantly.
[1:37:06] And once you see God's purpose in your
[1:37:09] life, you will begin to appreciate the
[1:37:11] grace of God in your life. Oh, brother
[1:37:14] Abraham said to us in the in the
[1:37:15] message, who is this man? The complete
[1:37:18] secret of your life has been made known.
[1:37:22] You got read the complete secret from I
[1:37:26] put it this way from where you come
[1:37:27] from, why you are placed on earth, and
[1:37:30] where you go after.
[1:37:32] What more you want to know?
[1:37:35] And do you know what he said? We are
[1:37:38] placed on earth to be tested.
[1:37:43] D I said you mean to for the rest of you
[1:37:47] you know what you'll be tested but every
[1:37:49] test come you overcome
[1:37:51] and as you overcome you climb higher and
[1:37:54] higher. Could you imagine Jesus being
[1:37:57] flustered?
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine Jesus being flustered?
[1:38:03] When Jesus was crossing and he told them
[1:38:05] let us go to the other side. You know
[1:38:07] what Jesus went and do? He was sleeping
[1:38:10] in the boat.
[1:38:12] You know why? Because he said we are
[1:38:14] going to the other side. And no amount
[1:38:17] of storm that Satan could raise could
[1:38:20] kill him.
[1:38:22] Satan listen, Satan cannot cut off your
[1:38:25] life. You get sick, your boy, you go
[1:38:27] dead. You can't just so
[1:38:35] you don't just die. Satan cannot touch
[1:38:38] you.
[1:38:41] If God I was asking a friend of mine
[1:38:43] he's a little bit compromised hell twice
[1:38:46] and such like I said are you ready to
[1:38:48] die he said no you free to dead I said
[1:38:50] boy at this stage you're like you should
[1:38:51] be ready to dead
[1:38:55] it's not that I want you to die but no
[1:38:58] believer if all of you here not all you
[1:39:00] can't say that Lord if you take me home
[1:39:02] praise the lord something wrong
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; yeah is it truth.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; What are you afraid to death for?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; The only reason why you should be afraid
[1:39:15] of dying is because you're not ready
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; or you're not knowing where you're
[1:39:19] going.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; But if you know where you're going, then
[1:39:22] you should say, "Praise the Lord." Lord,
[1:39:24] if it's your will that I should go,
[1:39:26] praise the Lord.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Once you can have that testimony, Satan
[1:39:31] go and didn't Paul say, "What can
[1:39:34] separate me from the love of God? Shall
[1:39:36] nakedness, trial, persecution?" He said
[1:39:38] in all of that we are more than
[1:39:40] conquerors.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; For me to live is Christ and to die is
[1:39:43] gain. If I dead it better for me.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; So Paul wasn't afraid of death. Why
[1:39:48] should we be afraid of death?
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Then it means we don't have an
[1:39:52] understanding what lays beyond the
[1:39:53] curtain of time.
[1:39:56] But once you begin to understand the
[1:39:59] complete secret of your life. But while
[1:40:01] we are here we can serve God's purpose.
[1:40:04] We can win souls for God. We can display
[1:40:07] Christ to the world.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; It is time that the message come out at
[1:40:12] iPod and iPod and all kind of thing and
[1:40:15] books and start walking on feet.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; That when you walk, you are the message
[1:40:21] embodiment.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't be flustered because he
[1:40:27] knew he was doing the will of God. He
[1:40:29] was in the will and the program of God.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And once you know that you're in
[1:40:33] the will of the program of God, you have
[1:40:35] no fear because you are God's purpose.
[1:40:38] Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:40:43] I I shared with I had a associate
[1:40:45] brother a wonderful brother preacher
[1:40:48] right and he had traveled and he came
[1:40:50] back to me and he said um he called me
[1:40:52] bro he said bro I had a dream a strange
[1:40:55] dream a dream that the rapture is taking
[1:40:58] place and I am seeing people going in
[1:41:01] the rapture and we're talking just like
[1:41:04] you and I and I see where they are
[1:41:06] sitting and the rapture is in effect and
[1:41:10] he's looking on. And he said to himself
[1:41:13] in the dream and he telling me they said
[1:41:15] he said I said as he said you mean to
[1:41:18] say after all the years of service and
[1:41:21] and preaching and such like you mean I
[1:41:22] didn't make it and the angel or whoever
[1:41:26] was it him says you are not in that
[1:41:28] dimension.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; So he tells me the dream and it seemed
[1:41:37] but I understood and I'm sure you
[1:41:39] understood right? that when the rapture
[1:41:41] is in effect, he wouldn't be here.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; And a few years, a year or two later,
[1:41:46] brother, he he took sick and he was
[1:41:49] diagnosed with a cancer on the by the in
[1:41:54] the in the brain in the middle of the
[1:41:55] brain and he eventually died. But he
[1:41:59] knew and look at God's grace to he knew
[1:42:03] God tell him you're going to go
[1:42:06] before the rapture take place. I had
[1:42:08] people come to me and tell me they're
[1:42:10] praying 40 days and he going to go to
[1:42:12] die and I said but the Lord already told
[1:42:14] the brother he going to go
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; but it give us assurance
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; it give us confidence that you know that
[1:42:24] where you're going to go
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; because God tell him you are not in that
[1:42:28] dimension you I'm going to take you home
[1:42:31] once your purpose is finished then you
[1:42:33] should be ready to say Lord take me home
[1:42:38] You want because you have one desire and
[1:42:41] one passion is to serve God's purpose.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, what is my purpose?"
[1:42:46] Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; And God's purpose, you ought to find out
[1:42:49] God's purpose in your life.
[1:42:52] it. Listen, if your role is just to be a
[1:42:55] doorkeeper, a cleaner or whatever it is
[1:42:58] that just to come and worship, if your
[1:43:00] role is just to pray,
[1:43:02] sometime I believe the power in the
[1:43:04] church is more by those who spend a
[1:43:06] little time on their knees.
[1:43:09] You can sense it by brother Danny that
[1:43:12] you know that brother, that sister, you
[1:43:14] can count on them to pray because they
[1:43:16] spend time and they connect to God.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:20] And it's a powerful role and purpose
[1:43:22] that your prayer is bringing down a
[1:43:24] blessing. Your prayer is helping the
[1:43:27] ministry.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; And it may seem simple. It may seem
[1:43:31] insignificant. But your role is
[1:43:33] important in God's po program
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; because souls and lives are being
[1:43:38] touched because of your devotion, your
[1:43:41] consecration, and your dedication.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Find God's purpose in your life.
[1:43:49] It may not be at the front. It may not
[1:43:50] be in the forefront, but wherever it is,
[1:43:53] you serve God's purpose.
[1:43:56] David, Joseph's purpose was greater. He
[1:43:59] had to go down. He suffered. He went
[1:44:01] through all of those things. But
[1:44:03] ultimately, the nation of Israel were
[1:44:06] preserved because he was in place where
[1:44:08] God wanted him.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; May the Lord help us. Amen. To find
[1:44:15] purpose in our lives. Amen. God's
[1:44:19] purpose in our life.
[1:44:22] Brother Abraham said that just a couple
[1:44:24] of quotes to to settle the thought. He
[1:44:27] said he's talking to a gentleman. He
[1:44:29] said, "Did you ever stop to think that
[1:44:31] God put you here on earth sometimes
[1:44:34] besides raising hogs?" Here was a man
[1:44:37] who was more preoccupied with mining
[1:44:40] animals or raising hogs. as legitim as
[1:44:43] legitimate as it may be. God put you
[1:44:46] here to be a son and daughter of God,
[1:44:49] not just to raise hog alone.
[1:44:52] In other words, it's not just to have a
[1:44:54] comfortable life and to have money and
[1:44:56] to be such like that. God didn't put you
[1:44:59] here to work in a factory alone. He put
[1:45:01] you here as a testimony, a written
[1:45:04] epistle read of all men to live an
[1:45:07] honorable and decent life, hid
[1:45:10] consecrated life with God so that men
[1:45:13] would know Jesus Christ still lives and
[1:45:16] reignal
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; that you can walk that people believe
[1:45:21] this woman like I said the accident she
[1:45:24] said she tell her mother she don't
[1:45:25] believe in God it know God her mother
[1:45:28] had bad experiences and I don't know
[1:45:30] what she was going through. But she said
[1:45:31] she stopped believing in God. But if it
[1:45:34] caused me an accident to point her back
[1:45:37] to God, it's worth it.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; What if I didn't come out and start
[1:45:41] behaving bad? You know them road they
[1:45:45] call road ra.
[1:45:51] You understand? You wonder sometimes
[1:45:54] some people behave and you wonder if
[1:45:56] they really Christian or not. They'll
[1:45:59] lose their temper, get all back. Like I
[1:46:01] tell them, oh, I in church, my children
[1:46:03] know me better than you all sitting in
[1:46:06] the congregation
[1:46:08] because I could come and preach a nice
[1:46:09] woman, but when I go home is a
[1:46:11] hotteered, badteered, impatient old man,
[1:46:14] you know.
[1:46:16] Oh, all lose all your cool home.
[1:46:21] They know me. I come and greet all the
[1:46:24] brothers. I say, "God bless you, my
[1:46:25] brother. How you doing?" And when I go
[1:46:27] home, you see that brother and I start
[1:46:29] bad talking him home.
[1:46:33] The whole church business in my house
[1:46:35] and the children know why what going on.
[1:46:38] What they said them don't know that he's
[1:46:41] a big hypocrite. They might tell me that
[1:46:45] you I reflect Christ home.
[1:46:49] They know my life. They know my
[1:46:50] behavior. They know my pattern. Just
[1:46:52] like my wife will know me better than
[1:46:54] anybody else. You've got to represent
[1:46:57] Christ. Your best service ser message is
[1:47:00] the one that has lived. Your best
[1:47:02] sermon.
[1:47:04] Remember the situation where a woman was
[1:47:06] um a man was told that there are no true
[1:47:08] Christian.
[1:47:10] He and the partners drinking partners.
[1:47:12] He's not a Christian and the partners is
[1:47:14] not Christian. And he said, "I know one
[1:47:18] true Christian."
[1:47:20] He said, "Yeah, well, let me know who
[1:47:22] that is." He said, "My wife is a true
[1:47:24] Christian." He said, "Well, let me go
[1:47:26] and test you out. Let me see how much
[1:47:27] Christian she is." They gone home and
[1:47:29] they behaving drunk and they ask you for
[1:47:32] eggs and she make the egg and she throw
[1:47:34] the egg on the ground, smash the plate,
[1:47:36] whatever it is, right? You remember all
[1:47:40] of them so you know, but they just
[1:47:42] testing out the wife to see she walk
[1:47:44] reaction is.
[1:47:46] And she she say, "Honey, I'll make you
[1:47:49] another thing." And he get up and say,
[1:47:51] "Get out." Thank
[1:48:03] you.
[1:48:13] Where's the
[1:48:24] Maybe there's a there's a nice way to
[1:48:25] tell me to stop.
[1:48:28] You can do it a nicer way.
[1:48:31] I understand. I get the message. I don't
[1:48:35] I was asking before I come there
[1:48:37] preacher. I a Trinidadian but I I feel
[1:48:41] hour is enough.
[1:48:44] Hour and 15 minutes if you give me a
[1:48:46] little extra. But you don't need to go
[1:48:48] too long now man.
[1:48:50] That's not true. Okay. But although I'm
[1:48:54] for long, I don't preach long.
[1:48:57] So just give me a few more minutes. So
[1:48:59] here was a woman who was being tested.
[1:49:02] She don't even know they put it on a
[1:49:05] test for
[1:49:08] they went behind the door and she went
[1:49:09] and got a broom and started sweeping it
[1:49:12] up. And she said, "Must Jesus bear the
[1:49:14] cross alone and all the world go free.
[1:49:18] There's a cross for everyone and there's
[1:49:20] one for you and me." Do you know what
[1:49:23] happened? That one test that she went
[1:49:26] through led three men to the Lord.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; And Breham says sometime you are being
[1:49:32] tested and you don't know.
[1:49:35] Your behavior, your attitude will
[1:49:38] determine how people will serve the
[1:49:41] Lord.
[1:49:42] Just be calm. If God have allowed it,
[1:49:45] say Lord, help me to overcome.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Help me to override this situation.
[1:49:52] Because at the end of the day, whatever
[1:49:54] you do, you have to win them and point
[1:49:57] them to Christ. They have to see Christ
[1:49:59] in you.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, you are driving, Christ
[1:50:04] must be in you.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; You're on your job, Christ is I'm okay
[1:50:08] with the mic. I'm okay. Thanks. Yeah.
[1:50:13] Christ is in you. Why? Because you are
[1:50:16] an written epistle read of all men.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are a written epistle read of
[1:50:24] all men. May God help us to see that
[1:50:27] that our one purpose on earth is to
[1:50:31] represent Christ.
[1:50:34] Maybe I just forget the notes. I just
[1:50:35] let let's just talk a little bit. Amen.
[1:50:39] How can Christ? We are living in a
[1:50:41] glorious time. Before I left, I was
[1:50:44] sharing a message on leadership,
[1:50:46] right? The great brother Abraham
[1:50:49] preached one of the greatest messages in
[1:50:52] the last three years of his life and all
[1:50:55] the others are great, right? But he's
[1:50:58] encapsulating all the thoughts of God.
[1:51:01] And his last formal message is
[1:51:03] leadership. And and most of you edu um
[1:51:07] you know who work in the environment
[1:51:09] know that leadership is an important
[1:51:11] subject and management subject because
[1:51:13] you have to learn how to manage people.
[1:51:16] But knew by God's grace the Holy Spirit
[1:51:20] in you could help you to get favor and
[1:51:23] to win favor
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; and more than that to lead by an
[1:51:27] example.
[1:51:29] And one of the things that is set up
[1:51:31] with being a good leader, you got to be
[1:51:33] aware of who you are. And like I said,
[1:51:37] you've got to be aware that I am a son
[1:51:40] of God.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; I represent God. I represent a message.
[1:51:45] I represent a light that has come in
[1:51:48] this day.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; You know, and once you can begin to come
[1:51:52] to that point, people can look at you
[1:51:54] and they know that there's something
[1:51:56] different about you. It's Christ on the
[1:51:59] inside. He's the driving force. There's
[1:52:02] a power inside of you. Others don't have
[1:52:06] it, but you have it because the Holy
[1:52:08] Spirit is inside of you to lead you
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; and to guide you. You know, Brother Bram
[1:52:13] had and I will share that incident as I
[1:52:15] close. Brother Bram went he was hunting
[1:52:18] squirrels, right? And there were no
[1:52:21] squirrels where he was at and brother
[1:52:23] Banks Woods is is with him, right? And
[1:52:25] brother Banks say I know a place where
[1:52:27] you can get squirrels. I may have shared
[1:52:30] this story with you but I love it so
[1:52:31] much I'll remind ourselves of it again
[1:52:34] because in n you know the study of
[1:52:37] leadership they've taken years of
[1:52:39] accumulation of studies and looking at
[1:52:42] organization to come out with some of
[1:52:44] the qualities and characteristics that
[1:52:47] good leaders may have. But one of the
[1:52:49] things that good leaders have is the
[1:52:51] ability and to know how to talk to
[1:52:53] people.
[1:52:54] You know not we are not here to put you
[1:52:57] down. We are not here to condemn and
[1:52:58] criticize. We are not here to to to just
[1:53:02] you know express ourselves and make
[1:53:04] ourselves feel that we big. In fact we
[1:53:07] are nothing. Is only the grace of God.
[1:53:10] If God have put us with and trained us
[1:53:12] and put us in an environment where we
[1:53:14] learn certain things, it was God's grace
[1:53:17] to you and I.
[1:53:19] Amen. So here he was, he was hunting
[1:53:21] squirrel and Bram had already previously
[1:53:23] I believe it was spoken squirrel into
[1:53:26] existence. But this time God had
[1:53:28] something greater and I'll show you
[1:53:31] where I'm going at this morning that he
[1:53:33] brother banks tell him let's go across
[1:53:35] the hollers and there's a few acres of
[1:53:38] land we could get squirrel there and he
[1:53:40] goes there and he said but listen that
[1:53:41] man hates preachers so you sit in the
[1:53:45] car and wait and I'll go and talk to
[1:53:47] him. So he comes out of the car bar of
[1:53:49] banks and he goes and he identify who he
[1:53:52] was and such like I am banks and son of
[1:53:55] Jim Woods. Jim is my father and he said
[1:53:57] well Jim is an honest man you can hunt
[1:53:59] wherever you are you want and he said
[1:54:01] but I bought my preacher along and a 75
[1:54:05] year old man real sharp he said you mean
[1:54:07] to say you get so long so low down you
[1:54:10] have to to a preacher wherever you go
[1:54:12] and brother say it's time for me to get
[1:54:14] out. So he comes out of the car and then
[1:54:17] he begins a conversation. And the man is
[1:54:20] mean really. He say, "I don't like you
[1:54:22] all preachers. There's nothing like God.
[1:54:24] I live here for how many years and I've
[1:54:26] never seen that thing you all call God."
[1:54:29] He say, "All I think about you preachers
[1:54:30] is that you all want to swindle the
[1:54:32] people and take their money." And in all
[1:54:35] of that, Brother Abraham keeps telling
[1:54:37] him, "You are entitled to your opinion."
[1:54:41] And brother Abraham never raises his
[1:54:43] voice. He never gets angry. He never
[1:54:45] says anything that is mean. He said,
[1:54:48] "Listen, you are entitled." The man say,
[1:54:50] "I don't like lying dog. I had a lying
[1:54:52] dog and a dog and I kill it."
[1:54:55] Basically, he telling Abraham, he say,
[1:54:57] "All all these lying preachers and just
[1:54:59] how I kill that dog, I'll kill you."
[1:55:02] That's what he's suggesting to him. And
[1:55:05] Barraham said, "But if he only knew what
[1:55:07] he talking about." But when he looked at
[1:55:10] Barra in his bloody coat and thing, he
[1:55:11] said, "But I like the way how you look.
[1:55:13] You know, you don't carry about
[1:55:15] yourself." You see how the disposition
[1:55:17] just created an impact
[1:55:19] and and you've got to conduct yourself
[1:55:22] and carry yourself in such a way that
[1:55:24] you leave an impression on people.
[1:55:28] You know, just for example, that woman
[1:55:30] said, "But there's something about you.
[1:55:32] You look like a good man." In the
[1:55:33] accident, you know, she said, "You look
[1:55:36] like a good man." I like that.
[1:55:40] We ought to look like a good man and a
[1:55:42] good woman.
[1:55:44] This is simple. The grace of God. But
[1:55:46] you create the right attitude. Never
[1:55:48] been flustered and never get on mean.
[1:55:53] And brother carries on the conversation
[1:55:55] with a man like that. And many times you
[1:55:57] will see and that's where communication
[1:56:00] skills come in. Brother keeps telling
[1:56:02] him you are entitled to your opinion.
[1:56:07] But he said, "Lord," here's what he
[1:56:09] buried the prophet said. He said, "Lord,
[1:56:11] this man must have worked these fields
[1:56:14] for so many years, these hard soils and
[1:56:16] such like. I he's about my father's age.
[1:56:19] If my father would have live, he'd have
[1:56:21] been about his age. Just give me
[1:56:23] something so that I can help this man."
[1:56:28] With all the demands attitude, brother
[1:56:30] Abraham said, "Just give me something
[1:56:33] that I can help him."
[1:56:36] And he said, "Lord, show me the way."
[1:56:39] And then the conversation and the man
[1:56:41] says to him, he said, "But there is one
[1:56:42] man I would like to talk to. If he ever
[1:56:46] comes back, I would like to meet that
[1:56:47] man. He was come to act on grounds. He
[1:56:50] had a prayer line. There was a woman who
[1:56:53] lives up the hill, right?" And here's
[1:56:54] how relates it. There's a woman who
[1:56:57] lives up the hill who had cancer and the
[1:57:00] doctor say she was died. He said, "My me
[1:57:03] and my wife would go up and help her."
[1:57:05] and you know pull the drawer sheets and
[1:57:07] such like and help her. You see her
[1:57:09] sisters go her sister went to the
[1:57:12] service and while she's there this man
[1:57:15] not being in this country calls the
[1:57:18] woman by name and tells her what her
[1:57:22] name was. He said when you left home you
[1:57:24] picked up a handkerchief from the table
[1:57:27] a white handkerchief with a blue figure
[1:57:29] in the corner from a marble tabletop and
[1:57:32] put it in your pocket book. He said,
[1:57:34] "Now take that handkerchief that you
[1:57:36] have in your pocketbook and when you go
[1:57:38] up back home late on your sister and she
[1:57:41] will get well."
[1:57:44] And brother Banks would want to tell
[1:57:45] brother tell her who tell him who he is
[1:57:47] now. The prophet said, "No, just give
[1:57:50] him enough rope." He said, "Give her co
[1:57:51] enough rope.
[1:57:53] He go hang yourself." What? Brother
[1:57:55] Abraham could have used that. If it was
[1:57:57] me, brother, I had a chop up one time.
[1:57:59] You know you're talking to the man
[1:58:02] and that's how we just behave. You want
[1:58:04] them to know who you is. Sometime we are
[1:58:07] nothing and we want to tell people you
[1:58:09] don't know who I is. When you talk like
[1:58:12] that, you don't really know who he is.
[1:58:14] If you had to tell people who you is
[1:58:16] something wrong with your king know who
[1:58:18] he is.
[1:58:20] We ought to know we are sons and
[1:58:22] daughters of God. And if you are
[1:58:24] nothing, God will make you something.
[1:58:27] Without his grace we are nothing.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; But this man he said you don't believe
[1:58:34] that that story a man come and pray and
[1:58:36] tell a lady he said listen man I can
[1:58:39] take you up to the woman children living
[1:58:40] up on the hill. He said isn't that so
[1:58:43] Jim talking to partner sitting with him
[1:58:46] and he said yes. And then changed the
[1:58:50] subject completely.
[1:58:52] Now you will relate to that story better
[1:58:54] than us because we don't have winter
[1:58:55] back home.
[1:58:57] He there was an apple tree and it was
[1:58:59] August and the leaves were beginning to
[1:59:01] fall. Now I taking it to a point. I want
[1:59:04] to show you God's purpose.
[1:59:06] This man was a infidel.
[1:59:09] This man don't believe there's a God and
[1:59:12] God had a purpose for Bar Abraham
[1:59:15] leaving where he was to come here to
[1:59:17] speak to him.
[1:59:19] And that's what I want to get to the
[1:59:21] purpose of God because he had an
[1:59:24] attitude. He say if that man ever come
[1:59:27] back in this area I want to talk to this
[1:59:30] man because he look like he different. I
[1:59:33] want to find out what it is who tell him
[1:59:35] this thing. And then Abraham changes the
[1:59:38] subject. He said they look there's an
[1:59:40] apple tree. I pick up an apple. He said
[1:59:41] can I have one and they eat it and such
[1:59:43] like and tell tells starts a
[1:59:46] conversation with him. He said listen
[1:59:49] it's not yet winter fall and the leaves
[1:59:52] are falling down from the tree. He said,
[1:59:54] "Why is that so?" He said, "Well, that's
[1:59:56] um the we're going to have our early
[1:59:58] winter."
[1:59:59] All right, we're going to have our early
[2:00:01] winter. The leaves, the sappers gone to
[2:00:03] the roots and the leaves are falling
[2:00:05] off. And Abraham said, "But it's not yet
[2:00:09] fall yet. How is it?" He said, "Well,
[2:00:11] that's just nature." And he tell him,
[2:00:13] "Well, if it is nature till the sap,
[2:00:16] leave the the tree, let the leaves fall
[2:00:18] and go down into the root. You take a
[2:00:20] bucket and put it on a post and let it
[2:00:22] happen to the bucket of water. He said,
[2:00:25] you know, I never thought of that,
[2:00:28] right? And that's how the conversation
[2:00:30] went. I never thought of that. And then
[2:00:32] Bram tell him, he said, you think on
[2:00:34] that while I go hunting and I will tell
[2:00:36] you it is the same intelligence that
[2:00:39] tells me about that woman that you will
[2:00:42] be healed. He said, you he said, would
[2:00:45] you remember his name? He said, yes. He
[2:00:47] said, Brham. He say yes that's the man
[2:00:50] and brother said think on what I have
[2:00:52] said. Now the thing point I want to make
[2:00:54] to you is that man had said he was so
[2:00:56] sincere if I wouldn't get a chance to
[2:00:59] talk to that man.
[2:01:01] I will want to find out what it was and
[2:01:04] God
[2:01:06] in his goodness God by his grace sent
[2:01:10] the prophet from one place to another
[2:01:12] place to meet that man to talk to him
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; because that man was fall was going to
[2:01:20] come. He was in the end of his life.
[2:01:22] Winter was going to happen. He died the
[2:01:25] next year. And he was not prepared for
[2:01:28] the winter that was to come. He didn't
[2:01:31] have the intelligence of an apple tree.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; The apple tree had more intelligence and
[2:01:36] know winter is going to come. Go down
[2:01:38] into the roots.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; And we've got to have the intelligence
[2:01:42] more than an apple tree to know that
[2:01:45] we've got to have that intelligence to
[2:01:48] lead us and guide us in the life.
[2:01:51] And God in his grace has brought that
[2:01:53] intelligence to us.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; It is the intelligence of God that has
[2:01:58] come to us
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; that tells us about a rapture that tells
[2:02:02] us about the word of God that tells us
[2:02:05] we can have life in Christ Jesus.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that we are connected to
[2:02:11] that life so that when our winter comes,
[2:02:15] we'll be ready. We'll be protected. will
[2:02:19] be hidden away
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; so that we can rise again.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "Everything
[2:02:26] that serves God's purpose will come up
[2:02:28] in the resurrection."
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; And I want to serve God's eternal
[2:02:33] purpose. If my purpose is to be a
[2:02:35] doormat in the house of the Lord, I'd
[2:02:37] rather be a doormat.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; If my purpose is just to pray, I'd
[2:02:41] rather be a prayer warrior. Whatever is
[2:02:44] God's purpose in my life, let me serve
[2:02:48] God's purpose because it's going to come
[2:02:51] up. He say in the resurrection.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; There has to be a resurrection because
[2:02:58] you are serving God's eternal purpose.
[2:03:01] And that's where we got to find God's
[2:03:03] purpose for our life. Serve it to the
[2:03:05] best of our ability.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. and just do his will and we will
[2:03:11] all come up in the resurrection.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; There's no big me or big you or small
[2:03:16] you. All of us are the same in God's
[2:03:18] kingdom.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; All of us are bought with the same
[2:03:21] price.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Danny price is the same as
[2:03:25] my price is the same as your price as
[2:03:27] everybody price here. The blood of the
[2:03:30] Lord Jesus Christ. So we are all one and
[2:03:33] we have one common objective. We are
[2:03:36] part of the body of the Lord Jesus
[2:03:38] Christ.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; If something is wrong with my toe, my
[2:03:42] hand can't say dicey toe. Leave it alone
[2:03:45] and know the hand say well you know you
[2:03:48] more important you high up and the toe
[2:03:50] doesn't be touching the ground. The toe
[2:03:52] and my hand is the same because when my
[2:03:55] toe have pain my head is telling my toe
[2:03:58] have pain. So all of us are on the same
[2:04:01] level and we are all part of God's great
[2:04:04] purpose. Brother Danny might be the one,
[2:04:07] the song leader might be the one, but
[2:04:09] you are part of the purpose because you
[2:04:11] are bringing down the presence of the
[2:04:13] Lord when you come prepared in the in
[2:04:16] the house of the Lord. You bring the
[2:04:18] presence of God in the midst of the
[2:04:20] people.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; You think of that little girl, one
[2:04:24] little colored girl. What about the
[2:04:26] woman from Memphis? Amen. I've shared
[2:04:29] that story with you some time ago. Here
[2:04:31] was say a colored woman. Amen. She find
[2:04:34] her purpose in the word of God. She say
[2:04:37] I am like the Shomite woman and here is
[2:04:40] God's prophet flying in an aircraft
[2:04:42] heading back home. But she was part of
[2:04:45] God's pro program.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she went down on the knees.
[2:04:49] She said, "Lord, I am like the Shamomite
[2:04:51] woman. And if I am the like the Shomite
[2:04:53] woman, then where is your Elijah?"
[2:04:55] Hallelujah.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; And God had to change the program of the
[2:04:59] prophet. He could have stopped that
[2:05:01] storm. Amen. In Colorado. But this storm
[2:05:04] that a little colored woman created in
[2:05:06] our home. He couldn't stop.
[2:05:09] There pilot couldn't say, "Well, I going
[2:05:11] somewhere else." God created allowed
[2:05:13] that storm to come. Because a woman was
[2:05:15] in prayer and she had a need.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; She was God's purpose.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she found God's purpose for
[2:05:23] her life and for her son. That son was a
[2:05:26] hardened son, a disobedient son. But
[2:05:28] when she get down in the knees, SHE
[2:05:30] SAID, "LORD, YOU give me that son."
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want him saved. When brother
[2:05:36] Abraham came to the house, Amen. She
[2:05:37] said, uh, she said, "Preacher, he died
[2:05:41] in the doctor." A man said, "Don't come
[2:05:42] back to my house. He will be dead. He
[2:05:45] go, there's nothing I could do with
[2:05:46] him." And for two days, he's been out in
[2:05:49] the dark crying, "Mama, mama, it's
[2:05:51] dark." Amen. until the prophet came to
[2:05:54] the door. Amen. She said, "I don't want
[2:05:58] him healed. I just want to know that
[2:05:59] he's saved and then let the Lord take
[2:06:01] him."
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Look at the wisdom of a colored woman.
[2:06:05] She knew that salvation was greater than
[2:06:07] healing.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; SHE PUT VALUE WHERE value belonged.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; SHE KNOW THE PURPOSE THAT SALVATION
[2:06:15] WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE LIFE HE COULD
[2:06:17] LIVE.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And God by his grace brought his
[2:06:23] prophet Amen and brought him on the
[2:06:26] scene.
[2:06:28] My you know you think of it an ordinary
[2:06:31] simple woman bring God's prophet make
[2:06:34] him walk six miles to come to our house
[2:06:37] and keep that plane waiting until she
[2:06:40] done get prayed for.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Listen, can't we with
[2:06:46] expectation come the same way? If a
[2:06:48] woman can bring a prophet to your house,
[2:06:50] CAN'T WE BRING GOD IN THE HOUSE OF THE
[2:06:52] LORD? CAN'T WE BRING GOD IN OUR HOME?
[2:06:57] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:07:00] forever.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; If it happened in Memphis, IT COULD
[2:07:03] HAPPEN IN HERE IN TORONTO. IT COULD
[2:07:05] HAPPEN IN TRINIDAD. IT CAN HAPPEN IN
[2:07:07] AMERICA. IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE BECAUSE
[2:07:10] HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND
[2:07:12] FOREVER.
[2:07:14] [Music]
[2:07:15] Do you know brother say if God is not
[2:07:17] the same then that the Bible could be
[2:07:20] put away as just another book of
[2:07:21] fallacy.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Let me repeat that. If Jesus is not the
[2:07:26] same yesterday, today and forever. We
[2:07:28] could do away with the Bible because all
[2:07:30] it takes is one word that is false and
[2:07:33] you could get rid of the rest.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; But he's the same yesterday. I say it
[2:07:38] again THIS MORNING. HE'S THE SAME
[2:07:40] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[2:07:45] AND IF HE DID IT IN THE PAST, HE CAN DO
[2:07:48] IT AGAIN
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; There is nothing too hard for God to do.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we are tested. Sometime we
[2:08:00] face situation. It might be our
[2:08:02] children. It might be some situation at
[2:08:04] home. But we could be anything. But God
[2:08:08] is greater than your situation.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; God is greater than your problem.
[2:08:13] God is greater than anything
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; that could come your way.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; You know, you think of the woman in the
[2:08:20] Bible, the woman that was caught in
[2:08:22] adultery. She was brought to Jesus.
[2:08:25] Sometimes God forced us to come to
[2:08:27] Jesus.
[2:08:28] She was brought to Jesus. God allowed
[2:08:30] her to be caught in adultery so she
[2:08:32] could come before Jesus.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came, he deal with all
[2:08:36] the accusers.
[2:08:40] God wasn't Jesus wasn't or God wasn't
[2:08:42] concerned about all the high priests and
[2:08:44] Pharisees and all the scribes and
[2:08:46] Pharisees who was who who catch her.
[2:08:50] You ever stop to think of it when Jesus
[2:08:53] is done?
[2:08:54] Amen. Here she was. She brought before
[2:08:57] the woman you know to bring her and say
[2:08:59] we catch this woman in adultery. And my
[2:09:01] concern was if she was caught in
[2:09:03] adultery where the man
[2:09:07] she was she alone was committed
[2:09:09] adultery. But I say is one of their
[2:09:11] partners.
[2:09:13] Oh you don't like that man. We just
[2:09:16] defend who we want and when we want to
[2:09:18] condemn somebody we could fight all the
[2:09:21] fault in them. Typical human beings.
[2:09:24] Typical Trinidadian.
[2:09:29] Yeah. And she was brought before Jesus.
[2:09:31] But when Jesus was done, whatever he
[2:09:33] wrote on his hand, he get all of them.
[2:09:36] Big stone dropped there. Big stone
[2:09:38] dropped there. All of them dropped their
[2:09:40] stone. Every one of them left. And Jesus
[2:09:43] said, "Woman, where are your accurusers?
[2:09:46] Accusers?" And when she lifted her head,
[2:09:49] there was none. She said, "There are
[2:09:50] none, Lord." He said, "Neither do I
[2:09:52] condemn you."
[2:09:54] The only one who was qualified to
[2:09:56] condemn her was him. And he said,
[2:09:58] "Neither do I condemn you, but go and
[2:10:01] sin no more."
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; She was forced to be brought to Jesus.
[2:10:06] But Jesus purpose was to set her free.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; And God has one purpose in our lives. I
[2:10:13] DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR PAST IS. I DON'T
[2:10:15] CARE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING. GOD HAS
[2:10:17] COME TO SET YOU FREE.
[2:10:24] Just allow yourself to be free.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; There's something about freedom. THERE'S
[2:10:29] SOMETHING ABOUT LIBERTY. THERE'S
[2:10:31] SOMETHING ABOUT praising the Lord. DO
[2:10:33] YOU KNOW THAT THE prophet of God said,
[2:10:35] "You have never done it in the first
[2:10:36] place."
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE MIGHT REMEMBER, YOU MIGHT
[2:10:40] REMEMBER, BUT GOD SAID, "I DON'T
[2:10:42] REMEMBER. YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST
[2:10:45] PLACE.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; He cleanses you. AMEN.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; HE WIPES YOUR SLATE CLEAN.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Your passings, your presents are what
[2:10:57] you may yet think. IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD.
[2:10:59] AND WHEN IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD, IT'S
[2:11:01] OBLITERATED.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; There is still power in the blood of
[2:11:08] Jesus.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; But if he has to come to you like he did
[2:11:13] at the woman at the well, he went to
[2:11:15] her. The Bible say he was there and he
[2:11:18] was waiting.
[2:11:19] Amen. For whatever it takes, he will get
[2:11:22] you because you are God's purpose.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible say he had needs to go through
[2:11:30] Samaria. You know why? Because God's
[2:11:32] purpose was coming for water that
[2:11:34] morning.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Hey, imagine that. He leave the
[2:11:38] disciples. He say you go away. As
[2:11:40] important as they were to his program,
[2:11:42] he say all you go away. I have to deal
[2:11:44] with one on a onetoone this morning.
[2:11:48] God deals with you privately. He deals
[2:11:50] with you personally.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; But when he's true, Amen. A woman with a
[2:11:55] bad past, people could say what they
[2:11:57] want about her. Amen. I remember brother
[2:12:00] John Simon preaching that many years
[2:12:02] ago. That subject about the woman at the
[2:12:04] well. He said by the time she was
[2:12:06] leaving the well, her errands were
[2:12:08] coming out. Her clothes was dropping
[2:12:10] down and it was a different woman who
[2:12:12] leave the well that went down the city
[2:12:15] and tell them, "Come see a man."
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Why? Because she saw the one who was
[2:12:21] able to clean your heart.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; The one who was able to satisfy her
[2:12:25] need.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The one. And I'm saying to this
[2:12:29] morning, that same one is here this
[2:12:32] morning. that whatever your thirst is,
[2:12:35] whatever your desire is, if there's a
[2:12:37] hunger inside of you, there's someone to
[2:12:40] satisfy it. If there's a thirst inside
[2:12:42] of you that is burning, there's someone
[2:12:44] to satisfy that thirst. Whatever your
[2:12:47] needs are, he's more than able to
[2:12:51] satisfy it.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; May God bless our hearts. He's still the
[2:12:56] satisfying portion.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Let us all stand and give God praise
[2:13:00] this morning.
[2:13:02] Hallelujah, Lord. Lord, we give you
[2:13:04] praise and thanks, Lord. Lord, I thank
[2:13:07] you, Lord. You are not mindful of our
[2:13:10] past, Lord. You are not mindful of where
[2:13:13] we come from, our genetics, Lord. Maybe
[2:13:15] we have a a a checkered history, Lord.
[2:13:19] Maybe we have issues in our lives, Lord,
[2:13:22] Father, that we may have inherited,
[2:13:24] Lord. But, Lord, when you come, you can
[2:13:26] clean it up, Lord. You can rewire us,
[2:13:29] Lord. You can reprogram us, Lord.
[2:13:31] Father, you can PUT THE VERY MIND THAT
[2:13:34] WAS IN CHRIST INSIDE OF US, LORD. We
[2:13:37] say, Lord, let the mind that was in
[2:13:39] Christ Jesus come inside of me, Lord.
[2:13:42] Father, help me to THINK LIKE YOU. HELP
[2:13:44] ME TO TALK LIKE YOU. HELP ME TO WALK
[2:13:47] LIKE YOU. Help me to conduct myself like
[2:13:50] the son of the king, Lord. Father,
[2:13:53] hallelujah. We give you praise and
[2:13:55] thanks, Lord. Lord, we thank you for
[2:13:57] your direction in our lives, Lord. Many
[2:14:00] at times we feel that things are going
[2:14:02] wrong, Lord, but there is somewhere you
[2:14:04] are working it out. For we know that all
[2:14:07] things work together for good, that them
[2:14:11] for them that love the Lord and for
[2:14:13] those who are called according to his
[2:14:15] divine purpose. Lord, we believe by your
[2:14:18] grace you have chosen us by election.
[2:14:20] Lord before the foundation of the world
[2:14:23] you documented our names in the lamb's
[2:14:26] book of life Lord Father we are placed
[2:14:29] there Lord in your divine purpose Lord
[2:14:32] is not our choosing it is your choosing
[2:14:35] Lord we submit to your will and to your
[2:14:38] purpose Lord Father help us and forgive
[2:14:40] us for where we have gone wrong Lord oh
[2:14:43] God and just set us back right Lord
[2:14:45] Father that we can demonstrate the very
[2:14:48] mind of Godord Lord, we give you praise
[2:14:51] and thanks. We thank you for this
[2:14:52] wonderful ministry, Lord. Lord, I hope
[2:14:55] they have labored over the years, Lord,
[2:14:57] and it continue, Lord. Let it continue
[2:14:59] to grow, Lord. Let it continue to touch
[2:15:02] life, Lord. Father, many people are not
[2:15:05] mindful of the need for Christ, Lord. We
[2:15:07] live in a time when people have become
[2:15:09] so self-sufficient Lord and that though
[2:15:12] he might identify that they are going
[2:15:14] wrong or there's an emptiness in their
[2:15:15] life but may that seed wherever it may
[2:15:18] be may it be found Lord Father and may
[2:15:21] the ministry oh God continue to prosper
[2:15:23] and fulfill the great plan and mind of
[2:15:27] God in the area that they are. We thank
[2:15:30] you for our precious brother. May you
[2:15:32] continue to bless him Lord. Father, we
[2:15:34] ask it for your honor and glory in Jesus
[2:15:37] precious name we pray. Amen. And amen.
[2:15:41] The Lord bless you this morning.
[2:15:44] I have a I have a maker. That's how we
[2:15:46] go. I have a maker. Amen. Just give the
[2:15:50] sisters a key.
[2:15:53] I have
[2:15:57] her.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; He for
[2:16:02] my heart.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; And before even time began,
[2:16:14] my life was in
[2:16:18] his hand.
[2:16:23] He knows my name.
[2:16:26] [Music]
[2:16:30] He knows
[2:16:32] my every
[2:16:34] [Music]
[2:16:40] tear that falls
[2:16:43] and hears me when I call. I have a
[2:16:48] father. Amen.
[2:16:51] I have a father.
[2:16:56] [Music]
[2:16:58] He calls me his own.
[2:17:02] [Music]
[2:17:05] And he'll never
[2:17:08] leave me,
[2:17:11] no matter where I go.
[2:17:19] Cuz he knows my name.
[2:17:27] He knows my every thought.
[2:17:32] [Music]
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; He sees
[2:17:35] each tear that falls
[2:17:39] and hears me when I call.
[2:17:45] [Music]
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Were you blessed this morning?
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. Amen.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Andrew, we've been on
[2:17:56] a series where I believe around part 12
[2:17:59] or part 13, and the series is called the
[2:18:02] purpose of God. Amen. And so, you know,
[2:18:06] um sometimes the Lord, you know, is
[2:18:08] speaking to to to the sons and daughters
[2:18:11] of God, calling his children. Uh, you
[2:18:14] know, we've been in this series where
[2:18:16] the Lord is just showing us that, you
[2:18:18] know, we're in we're in this adoption
[2:18:20] phase of our lives where God is bringing
[2:18:23] out our true identities. Amen. And, you
[2:18:26] know, like um we could be out there and
[2:18:28] we could be out, you know, uh doing uh
[2:18:31] outreach min, you know, ministry out
[2:18:33] there and we could be uh you know,
[2:18:35] dealing with uh all kinds of um ways
[2:18:39] that that we're out there reaching the
[2:18:40] lost. But you know that God in this
[2:18:44] hour, okay, is he's not it's not that
[2:18:47] he's not doing that, but he's working
[2:18:50] and perfecting the sons and daughters of
[2:18:53] God. We're we're we're we're late in the
[2:18:56] hour, saints. And there's many that, you
[2:18:59] know, sometimes God has to send somebody
[2:19:01] from Trinidad to come and let you know
[2:19:04] that he's the same God that's been
[2:19:06] speaking to us that's wanting to perfect
[2:19:09] our lives. And you know, that's what the
[2:19:11] five-fold ministry is to do, to perfect
[2:19:14] the church and to bring us into our true
[2:19:19] identity as sons and daughters of the
[2:19:22] king. Amen. We're not just children of
[2:19:25] this world. We are children of the king.
[2:19:29] Amen. And this is what I heard today.
[2:19:32] This is what just encouraged my heart to
[2:19:35] hear that that the Lord Jesus, he's not
[2:19:38] going to stop. He's going to deal with
[2:19:40] each and every one of you. No matter
[2:19:42] Listen, there's there's there's some of
[2:19:44] you here today that need to get closer
[2:19:48] to God. Amen. Praise God. That need to
[2:19:51] surrender their lives completely over.
[2:19:54] God was speaking lip to ear to many of
[2:19:57] us in this place, including me. Amen.
[2:20:00] Praise God. This is why we come into the
[2:20:02] house of the Lord. We we believe the
[2:20:04] word speaks to us that he's alive and
[2:20:07] that he's he he's he's mindful of our
[2:20:10] every need. Amen. And this is the time
[2:20:13] where he's saying, "Wake up and get into
[2:20:17] the purpose that I've given you. You are
[2:20:20] mature sons and daughters of God." Amen.
[2:20:23] It's time for you to take your rightful
[2:20:26] position because he's placing that
[2:20:28] authority in you. That's what the
[2:20:30] adoption process is all about. To place
[2:20:34] his authority in us. Amen. Praise God. I
[2:20:37] was blessed by the word this morning.
[2:20:39] Amen.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; It's just made me realize who I am,
[2:20:43] Lord. Amen. Let's sing that song. It's
[2:20:46] who I am. Oh, glorious victory.
[2:20:51] That day he set me free.
[2:20:55] And my heart
[2:21:00] is very thrown.
[2:21:04] My life is no longer mine.
[2:21:08] I'm a l of love divine.
[2:21:13] Now I live
[2:21:17] to praise his name.
[2:21:23] Yeah,
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; it's who I am.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; I can see
[2:21:34] who I am.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a part of myior.
[2:21:42] I'm a part of
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; his word
[2:21:46] is revelation.
[2:21:49] Everybody say of who I am.
[2:21:57] A flatter boy. Amen. Praise the
[2:22:00] wonderful name of the Lord. Well, you
[2:22:02] might be down and feel like God has
[2:22:06] somehow forgotten
[2:22:11] that you are faced with circumstances
[2:22:15] you can't get through. Right now it
[2:22:18] seems and right now it seems there's no
[2:22:23] way out and you're going under.
[2:22:28] But God's proven time and time again
[2:22:33] he'll take care of you. Everybody now.
[2:22:36] Oh, he'll do it again for you. He'll do
[2:22:42] it again
[2:22:46] if you just take a look at where you are
[2:22:50] now and where you been.
[2:22:54] Hasn't he always come true for you? He's
[2:22:59] the same now as then.
[2:23:04] You may not know how. You may not know
[2:23:07] when he'll do it again.
[2:23:13] God knows the things you're going
[2:23:16] through. He knows how you're hurting.
[2:23:20] [Music]
[2:23:22] You see, he knows just how your heart's
[2:23:26] been broken into.
[2:23:29] He's the God of the stars. He's the God
[2:23:31] of the stars.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; God of the
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; He is your father. Amen.
[2:23:39] You see, he can calm the storm of your
[2:23:43] soul. He'll fix this for you, everybody.
[2:23:48] And he'll do it again for you. He'll do
[2:23:53] it again.
[2:23:55] [Music]
[2:23:57] If you just take a look at where you are
[2:24:01] now and where you've been.
[2:24:05] Hasn't he always come true?
[2:24:10] He's the same now as
[2:24:13] [Music]
[2:24:15] you may not know how.
[2:24:17] [Music]
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Let's try to bridge together. Oh, he's
[2:24:22] still God, brother. Oh, he's still God.
[2:24:29] He will not fail you.
[2:24:33] No, he's still God.
[2:24:37] He will not change.
[2:24:41] I know that he's God
[2:24:46] and he's fighting for you.
[2:24:51] Just like Moses, just like Daniel, just
[2:24:55] like Shadrach, Macho,
[2:25:02] he'll do it again for you. He'll do it
[2:25:07] again.
[2:25:10] If you just take a look at where you are
[2:25:14] now,
[2:25:15] Mary King, hasn't he always he always
[2:25:20] come through for you? He's the same now
[2:25:24] as then.
[2:25:28] If you may not know how,
[2:25:32] you may not know when.
[2:25:37] You may not know how. You may not know
[2:25:40] when,
[2:25:44] but he'll do it.
[2:25:47] [Music]
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And we have an announcement
[2:26:00] that before we go through it, um, you
[2:26:03] have a vision and a purpose will be
[2:26:06] shared by Joseph and Abraham. Can you
[2:26:08] guys come and do it right away then?
[2:26:12] [Music]
[2:26:35] Our vision is to be a life-changing
[2:26:37] ministry transforming the world one
[2:26:39] person at a time. Our purpose is to
[2:26:43] bring people to Jesus for membership in
[2:26:45] his family, growing them into maturity,
[2:26:48] equipping them for ministry to fulfill
[2:26:50] life's purpose of glorifying God.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; We are changing lives forever.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[2:27:00] Changing lives forever. Okay, just a
[2:27:03] reminder that we have our nursing home
[2:27:05] ministry today at um with S Vanessa and
[2:27:09] the crew
[2:27:11] 145. Is that right? Yeah. So, everybody
[2:27:13] has to be there. Whoever is a member of
[2:27:15] that try to be there around 1:45.
[2:27:19] Um also we have some
[2:27:24] um clothes. Some people maybe have
[2:27:27] forgotten their clothes or suit. A bunch
[2:27:31] of them, maybe 10 or so. Whoever has
[2:27:34] forgotten it, please take that, move it
[2:27:38] from there so they can have a space for
[2:27:40] the people to hang their jackets when
[2:27:43] they come to the service. So, whoever
[2:27:45] has forgotten his clothes downstairs in
[2:27:49] the hanger, make sure it's taken out
[2:27:51] from there. And also we're gonna need a
[2:27:55] few younger men to assist with the
[2:27:58] setting up the stage for the children's
[2:28:00] play. So the young men that are strong,
[2:28:03] we need your help. And
[2:28:06] right after the service for the young
[2:28:08] people's play. So um let's give God an
[2:28:11] applause and thank God for the word that
[2:28:13] came and
[2:28:19] weekend next week. Oh, that's the main
[2:28:22] thing. You have a big big big weekend
[2:28:27] for the Christmas dinner. And that's our
[2:28:29] pastor. I said nobody has an excuse not
[2:28:32] to show up. So, we expect to see
[2:28:34] everyone over there after the service,
[2:28:37] our Christmas dinner. If your name is
[2:28:39] not there, make sure your name is there.
[2:28:42] So, we expect to see everyone over there
[2:28:45] next week.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to add to it.
[2:28:50] So that's next Sunday, the Christmas
[2:28:52] dinner. But what's happening Saturday?
[2:28:54] Something happening Saturday?
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; My wife says, "Yeah, woman's Christmas
[2:28:59] fellowship is happening on Saturday,
[2:29:02] right?" So um the sisters, you know,
[2:29:05] it's it's it's the biggest one they have
[2:29:07] all year long. And and uh the there's uh
[2:29:11] Christmas cookies that they're baking
[2:29:13] and stuff. Anyway, you you should know
[2:29:15] about it. Remember, it's next Saturday.
[2:29:16] You're going to have a good time. And I
[2:29:18] don't know, usually something happens
[2:29:19] with the men on Saturdays when they're
[2:29:21] doing that. I don't know, Daniel, if you
[2:29:23] got something planned, but if he does,
[2:29:25] he'll let you know. And uh and on on
[2:29:28] Sunday, uh uh now uh just a note about
[2:29:32] the Christmas dinner. Uh we told them
[2:29:34] Friday how many people that are our
[2:29:36] numbers were okay? But I asked her, I
[2:29:39] said, "Hey, we're having Sunday service.
[2:29:41] Is there any chance of a little bit of
[2:29:42] movement?" She says, "Call me Monday."
[2:29:45] So, if you if you haven't signed up or
[2:29:47] if you don't don't know about it, you
[2:29:49] online um not sure about it, tomorrow is
[2:29:52] the last day because they can't wait.
[2:29:54] It's not a restaurant. They have to
[2:29:56] prepare all the food and do everything
[2:29:57] like that. Okay? So, the numbers have to
[2:29:59] be solidified by tomorrow. I think this
[2:30:02] is going to be our biggest one ever, by
[2:30:04] the way. So, thank God for that as far
[2:30:06] as numbers are concerned. And um and
[2:30:09] we're looking forward to have a lot of
[2:30:10] fun and uh to praise the Lord and to
[2:30:13] have a a good time. All right. The devil
[2:30:15] wants it. You know what they did in
[2:30:17] Dundas where I live? They they always
[2:30:19] had this uh uh manger scene. I was so
[2:30:22] happy that they had this manger scene in
[2:30:24] the town square. So they they had the
[2:30:26] big box, the big manger, bigger than
[2:30:28] this pulpit and and uh you know Jesus
[2:30:31] and Mary and all that. And and you know
[2:30:33] what they got in there this year?
[2:30:34] Santa's workshop.
[2:30:39] I said they got the same box, but they
[2:30:41] got Santa's workshop in there. I said,
[2:30:43] "Oh my." Well, we're going to praise the
[2:30:44] Lord and give him all the glory in this
[2:30:46] Christmas season. Are you happy?
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Are you happy for the word? Give us that
[2:30:50] B flat if you would.
