[1:02:06] here with you all in this memorable
[1:02:11] occasion um it's not every day we have a
[1:02:14] service like this because most times um
[1:02:18] you know a a church does not change its
[1:02:21] Pastor unless somebody's
[1:02:24] dead but uh I I'm glad that brother John
[1:02:28] Simon is
[1:02:30] alive
[1:02:31] amen praise
[1:02:34] God
[1:02:36] hallelujah you know we we we see our
[1:02:39] whole time as a crossing over you know
[1:02:42] brother Chandler um today is a memorial
[1:02:45] service um brother beruti this week and
[1:02:49] then we heard of brother Franks who were
[1:02:51] gone you know and um it it tells us that
[1:02:55] God God is doing
[1:02:58] something but I I I certainly want to
[1:03:01] say to our precious Pastor who is
[1:03:04] retiring and I don't know if that is a
[1:03:06] correct political word in the church um
[1:03:10] that we we thank him in Jamaica we
[1:03:12] certainly say thanks to you you have
[1:03:15] been a tower of strength to us and um
[1:03:20] brother Thomas Brady who was my pastor
[1:03:23] you know he has some very dear friends
[1:03:27] and um it it's like who is his friends
[1:03:30] is my friends and I can remember when I
[1:03:33] took over the church in lindstad
[1:03:36] actually preached them out of a
[1:03:38] denomination from Monday to Friday and
[1:03:40] on Friday night all the sisters had
[1:03:42] resigned as ministers to the church so I
[1:03:45] was forced to be pastoring but brother
[1:03:48] Brady had always that I should um take
[1:03:51] over from him so he he he had that long
[1:03:56] succession planning that he said brother
[1:03:59] Keith don't wait until you hear that I
[1:04:01] can't stand in my Pulpit I want you to
[1:04:03] come and stand there no actually I am
[1:04:06] like the uh Butler that was in the
[1:04:10] prison with Joseph because actually when
[1:04:13] we actually decided that you know we we
[1:04:16] forget what we were supposed to do he
[1:04:19] has already being two years can't Pastor
[1:04:23] can't even communicate today and um you
[1:04:26] know it it's such mixed reaction to
[1:04:29] remember the many times that we've had
[1:04:32] that he had share that testimony having
[1:04:34] meet the prophet and it has been the
[1:04:38] highlight of his life from that day
[1:04:41] until the day when he speak no more that
[1:04:45] day with the letter in his pocket and
[1:04:47] sitting there with a trouble in his
[1:04:49] heart and brother brandham said I see a
[1:04:51] colored man he's not from here I see
[1:04:54] many Waters do you know God know what
[1:04:56] your name is Mr Brady you have a letter
[1:04:59] in your pocket and it's not for you it's
[1:05:01] for your wife and her feet is stolen it
[1:05:05] had to be
[1:05:06] God and so we've seen the Mighty God
[1:05:10] unveil before us in this day what kind
[1:05:14] of people are we to be in this
[1:05:18] hour and I also want to say to my
[1:05:21] precious brother Simon I I thank God
[1:05:25] that you are still strong and I I concur
[1:05:28] with brother um George simith that says
[1:05:32] we have some calls to call you because
[1:05:35] God's not finished with you yet but
[1:05:38] something that we must also realize that
[1:05:40] is precious wife sister I know many
[1:05:44] nights you might have rest your hands on
[1:05:47] him and because he he has problems in
[1:05:50] the church we can say he's an
[1:05:53] overcomer amen praise God
[1:05:59] God a and to think that he's passing on
[1:06:03] the Batton to a man who is strong who
[1:06:06] the church accept and there is no
[1:06:09] separation or turbulence in the church
[1:06:12] we say thanks be to God Amen and so we
[1:06:15] we say also to my precious brother
[1:06:18] darnie and his wife now you're taking
[1:06:21] the buttton it's not an easy Road no no
[1:06:26] no no no you you know I I look at when
[1:06:29] Paul charged
[1:06:31] Timothy he said I charge thee therefore
[1:06:34] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:06:37] shall judge the quick and the dead as is
[1:06:40] appearing in his kingdom he said preach
[1:06:42] the word be instant in season and not a
[1:06:47] season he
[1:06:49] said for a time will come when they will
[1:06:51] not endure some
[1:06:53] Doctrine but after their own love
[1:06:56] shall they Heap to themselves teachers
[1:06:58] having itching
[1:06:59] ear and they shall turn their ears away
[1:07:03] from the truth but he said watch thou in
[1:07:07] all things now my friend God has set you
[1:07:10] as the Watchman over the house of God
[1:07:14] and we never understand many times we'
[1:07:16] ignore what the wife of a pastor go
[1:07:20] through as he carry the load of taking
[1:07:24] care of the Soul
[1:07:26] of men as a matter of fact today is my
[1:07:28] wife's birthday happy birthday
[1:07:36] Francine because sometimes she's got to
[1:07:38] stand between him and the people many
[1:07:43] times we take the word and we beat down
[1:07:46] the wives and the women and so but there
[1:07:49] are strong Towers also who stand between
[1:07:53] the minister and the people sometime to
[1:07:56] guard him to make sure that he keeps his
[1:08:00] sanity you know so I say to you my
[1:08:03] sister stand with your man stand with
[1:08:06] your husband no matter what take side
[1:08:10] with him pray for him sometimes been
[1:08:13] fasting for him because the road is not
[1:08:17] easy you know just uh four weeks ago I
[1:08:20] was in Uganda and um God is really let
[1:08:25] my heart to work with the people of that
[1:08:29] country and you know sometimes it's to
[1:08:31] go among people who doesn't English is
[1:08:35] not their first language as my brothers
[1:08:37] speak of that they don't hear Brother
[1:08:40] Brandon's voice in English somebody
[1:08:42] sometimes has got to interpret that
[1:08:45] voice to them and interpretation is not
[1:08:48] a word but a concept of the meaning of a
[1:08:51] thought is so important to bring across
[1:08:55] to a people but I tell you one thing God
[1:08:59] is the same wherever we go I thank God
[1:09:04] that in my short time and I stand among
[1:09:07] Elders I've seen the dead
[1:09:10] raised I've seen the dying raised from
[1:09:13] the dying bed I've seen the power of God
[1:09:17] by the power of the Holy Ghost eel
[1:09:21] instantaneously amen and so we say like
[1:09:24] the apostle Paul today it comes not in
[1:09:28] words only but in power and the
[1:09:33] demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:38] amen and my brother Brooks who I'm
[1:09:41] trying to get help me pray because in

[1:09:50] pray because I know if I win you to get
[1:09:53] him to go he'll be there amen but last
[1:09:57] night I was on the phone with brother
[1:09:58] Gideon and he said please brother
[1:10:01] brother George brother Brooks they would
[1:10:04] be good for
[1:10:05] Uganda you know I can remember just a
[1:10:08] few years ago we were sitting having
[1:10:10] breakfast as I just share a testimony
[1:10:13] with
[1:10:14] you and my wife get a call and um I was
[1:10:18] not hearing what was being said but I
[1:10:20] know something was
[1:10:23] wrong and as I begin to understand what
[1:10:27] was happening my trustee one of my
[1:10:29] trustee was driving through the
[1:10:32] mountains and um you know right there
[1:10:34] around the wheels he blocked out and
[1:10:38] died and the vehicle you know actually
[1:10:41] just go to the Rock and it just rests
[1:10:44] right
[1:10:45] there they so they called to tell us
[1:10:48] what was happening there was three
[1:10:50] persons in the vehicle they called the
[1:10:51] police and you know as I heard it it's
[1:10:54] like a state of
[1:10:57] emergency I run to my room and I grab my
[1:11:01] Bible and as I pull it apart I could see
[1:11:05] the red letter in Acts 1 and verse 8 for
[1:11:09] you shall receive power after that the
[1:11:12] Holy Ghost has come upon you and as I
[1:11:15] was swiveling down to my knees something
[1:11:17] speak within me and said read the next
[1:11:21] verse and the next verse begin to say
[1:11:24] and he was taking out of their sight I
[1:11:27] didn't go on my knees then I said Lord
[1:11:31] not
[1:11:32] today not today I said Lord as I begin
[1:11:37] to Pace the floor and pray I said Lord
[1:11:39] let him come back in the house of
[1:11:42] God and share a testimony of everything
[1:11:47] that happened
[1:11:49] today and I begin to tell him who I know
[1:11:54] that he is
[1:11:56] because he's a Healer he's a deliverer
[1:11:59] he's a problem solver he's a burden
[1:12:02] Bearer and there's nothing that we can
[1:12:05] ask and believe that God won't to do
[1:12:10] it and as I paced the
[1:12:13] floor the inspiration struck me called
[1:12:17] them again and pray into his ears now
[1:12:21] how can you pray into the ears of a dead
[1:12:24] man you see God is not like
[1:12:28] us and the foolishness of man it

[1:26:07] look at this uh kind of an over overview
[1:26:10] not reading the entire uh uh story uh
[1:26:15] and just glean some things that I think
[1:26:18] would be possibly important uh I I think
[1:26:22] it would be enhancing to our life on
[1:26:25] planet Earth and in our
[1:26:28] uh relationship with the Lord uh should
[1:26:32] I say Fellowship when you're born again
[1:26:35] your relationship is established and the
[1:26:39] word again h e a i n and you you the
[1:26:43] British people uh you pronounce that
[1:26:47] correctly it's a
[1:26:49] gain and you know I I'm from the south
[1:26:53] it's
[1:26:55] [Laughter]
[1:26:59] again uh 1st Samuel chapter
[1:27:03] 17 and let's just read uh for time's
[1:27:06] sake verse number 10 and then we'll take
[1:27:09] an
[1:27:10] overview of this uh story and this event
[1:27:14] and the Philistine this is
[1:27:16] Goliath I defy the armies of Israel this
[1:27:22] day give me a
[1:27:24] man that we may fight
[1:27:27] together and you can be seated thank you
[1:27:30] so
[1:27:32] much
[1:27:37] so with brother Dany uh brother Tim the
[1:27:43] deacons and and all uh this is
[1:27:46] a a qu of undertaking to say the very
[1:27:49] very least and uh you know brother
[1:27:54] Danny's been scurrying I I I mean there
[1:27:59] here everywhere and
[1:28:02] uh it's a very quite a gigantic un
[1:28:06] undertaking and we're very appreciative
[1:28:09] of the
[1:28:10] hospitality uh once again the
[1:28:13] pleasantries uh that we've enjoyed and
[1:28:17] and my wife Beverly is uh W with me on
[1:28:21] this occasion actually it's only the
[1:28:23] second time I think uh since we brought
[1:28:27] the uh the we chartered a bus up and uh
[1:28:32] we we certainly enjoyed
[1:28:34] that brother brandham said that when God
[1:28:37] calls the man he calls his
[1:28:40] wife so sister
[1:28:44] Simon it's also for you and uh and the
[1:28:49] young lady sitting to your uh to your
[1:28:53] right uh I didn't know who she
[1:28:56] was but we're glad to have Grace
[1:29:01] today to
[1:29:04] me have you ever seen a
[1:29:08] newscast maybe it's all a Serial
[1:29:11] murderer and the psychologist or
[1:29:16] psychiatrist may may be asked by the
[1:29:21] interviewer can you ever can you get in
[1:29:24] inside their
[1:29:25] minds to see how they
[1:29:30] think well whatever answer that may be
[1:29:35] provided here you
[1:29:37] have a
[1:29:39] book that got in in to the Creator's
[1:29:46] mind and these are his
[1:29:48] thoughts pinned on
[1:29:52] paper uh
[1:29:54] which thoughts are a Prelude to a word
[1:29:58] that is spoken now thought is that word
[1:30:04] unspoken and I'm quite
[1:30:10] thrilled as you would
[1:30:13] know about this person of
[1:30:17] Christ that he FS
[1:30:20] all and all everything
[1:30:24] everywhere with
[1:30:28] himself so fills everything everywhere
[1:30:32] with
[1:30:34] himself so there's not a a period of of
[1:30:38] time and whatever those circumstances
[1:30:42] that time that that season or period of
[1:30:45] time uh has challenged an individual
[1:30:48] with and you will be challenged I will
[1:30:51] be challenged and uh that that he fills
[1:30:56] everything with himself at all times
[1:31:01] omnipotent probably we would not have
[1:31:04] been as versed with the word
[1:31:08] omnipotent had it not been for brother
[1:31:11] brandham the word om uh
[1:31:15] omnipresent had it not been for brother
[1:31:17] brother
[1:31:19] renam uh the word
[1:31:22] infinite probably not
[1:31:24] not as been as acquainted with those
[1:31:29] expressions of this infinite being if it
[1:31:33] had not been for brother
[1:31:36] Brenham and he said after the seals uh
[1:31:41] he made the comment uh of this nature he
[1:31:44] said the Bible has become
[1:31:46] a a new book
[1:31:49] Hallelujah the word new in there's two
[1:31:54] Greek words for new in in the New
[1:31:56] Covenant or new testament and one of
[1:32:00] them is NEOS NE oos the other is canos k
[1:32:05] a i n
[1:32:08] oos
[1:32:10] and I I'm sorry that one of those
[1:32:14] words I should have been more exact but
[1:32:17] what one of those words mean that is
[1:32:19] applicable to that word uh that brother
[1:32:23] br expressed was uh it it is
[1:32:28] elevated to a a new level of
[1:32:32] quality so that's what happened to the
[1:32:36] Bible it was elevated to a new level of
[1:32:44] quality so when I look in in in the word
[1:32:48] into the mind of
[1:32:50] God what we are seeing the the decision
[1:32:54] making the
[1:32:56] verdict that he has
[1:32:59] issued uh toward particularly his family
[1:33:03] yes sir to you amen and his verdict and
[1:33:07] decision cannot
[1:33:09] change if he declared whatever that
[1:33:13] declaration is he declared it he doesn't
[1:33:16] have to redeclare it he doesn't have to
[1:33:20] reestablish it but it one one time and
[1:33:25] it's
[1:33:25] established forever oh lord your word is
[1:33:31] established it can it can't change it
[1:33:34] doesn't possess the ability to
[1:33:37] change but it possesses the ability to
[1:33:40] change what it's
[1:33:43] around so I'm I look at this mind of God
[1:33:47] and could I read you just a few things
[1:33:50] that would I think be of value actually
[1:33:54] uh in Genesis 1:1 the Bible says in the
[1:33:56] beginning God now in the beginning
[1:34:00] Elohim Elohim uh because there's nothing
[1:34:04] uh at that point to worship him in the
[1:34:07] beginning
[1:34:08] Elohim and and so this is a a new one
[1:34:12] for you Genesis
[1:34:16] 0.1
[1:34:22] God he started
[1:34:24] start he began the
[1:34:27] beginning so I look into this great mind
[1:34:30] just for a few moments and we'll get uh
[1:34:33] back to 1st Samuel
[1:34:35] 17:10 uh the Bible says about you in 2
[1:34:40] Corinthians
[1:34:42] 5:17 uh if if any man be where in Christ
[1:34:47] he's a new creature sir that
[1:34:51] word New Creation
[1:34:54] not
[1:34:55] renovated but a new
[1:34:59] creation old things are passed away in
[1:35:02] know the
[1:35:04] old and it's commonly called The Old Man
[1:35:08] Paul referred or use that expression the
[1:35:11] old man all that was attached to that
[1:35:14] oldness has passed
[1:35:16] away behold everything has become
[1:35:21] new amen
[1:35:24] everything has become
[1:35:26] new and he knew that knew no
[1:35:31] sin but became
[1:35:34] sin that we could become
[1:35:38] righteous the righteousness of God and
[1:35:42] if any man be in Christ he is the
[1:35:44] righteousness of
[1:35:46] God uh Ephesians chapter 1 would you
[1:35:51] like to maybe if you don't mind just
[1:35:53] turn there and we'll read uh
[1:35:56] chapter a number of verses of chapter
[1:36:07] one if you were confined or limited just
[1:36:11] one uh letter that Paul wrote uh now in
[1:36:16] my if for this is my opinion for me it
[1:36:19] would be
[1:36:20] Ephesians all all the great truths of of
[1:36:24] Redemption is provided in Ephesians 1 so
[1:36:27] let me just share with you few of the
[1:36:30] remarks that your heavenly bridegroom
[1:36:34] said about
[1:36:35] you and I believe that we'll come come
[1:36:38] away and think my goodness he sure
[1:36:41] thought a lot of me I'm highly thought
[1:36:45] of around 130 times in the New Covenant
[1:36:50] in the New Testament the words in
[1:36:54] him in whom in Christ is pinned by the
[1:36:59] first age
[1:37:00] messenger in him in whom in
[1:37:05] Christ so in verse number three of
[1:37:08] chapter one blessed be the God and
[1:37:10] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who is
[1:37:12] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:37:16] blessings in the heavenlies in
[1:37:18] Christ according as he has chosen us in
[1:37:23] him
[1:37:25] before the foundation of the
[1:37:30] world you were saved before you were
[1:37:34] saved you were healed before you were
[1:37:36] healed you were delivered before you
[1:37:39] were delivered you were filled with the
[1:37:42] Holy before you were
[1:37:48] filled according as he has chosen Us in
[1:37:51] him uh before the foundation of the
[1:37:54] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:37:56] Blame before him him in love verse
[1:37:59] number six real quickly uh to the praise
[1:38:02] of the glory of his grace wherein he has
[1:38:05] made us accepted in the
[1:38:10] Beloved in whom we have
[1:38:13] Redemption and I'll pause here for just
[1:38:15] a moment
[1:38:17] now uh brother Brooks did a beautiful
[1:38:22] job on Friday
[1:38:24] evening brother Smith last evening and I
[1:38:28] told Brother George uh and now we really
[1:38:31] didn't know it uh his son William is
[1:38:35] good friends with uh he was like a
[1:38:39] father to me and uh this November will
[1:38:43] be two years of his deceased being
[1:38:45] deceased and uh so at his funeral
[1:38:49] service uh William and his wife were
[1:38:52] there
[1:38:54] unmistakable I could recognize William
[1:38:57] being a
[1:38:59] brandom having I mean it's just when I
[1:39:03] say A brandom you understand what I'm
[1:39:04] saying just have those family
[1:39:08] characteristics
[1:39:10] and and I think there
[1:39:14] were uh six
[1:39:20] speakers and I said after it was over
[1:39:22] with
[1:39:23] you're never going to get me to come
[1:39:26] last because everybody has
[1:39:29] said what they have said you stole every
[1:39:33] every line and every paragraph every
[1:39:37] statement every sentence uh that that I
[1:39:41] so
[1:39:43] uh so
[1:39:46] here you understand what I'm
[1:39:51] saying in whom we have Redemption
[1:39:54] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:39:56] sins now uh the translators uses the
[1:40:00] word forgiveness but when you look that
[1:40:03] up the best word that could be used is
[1:40:08] remission remission of
[1:40:14] sin in verse uh 10 that in the
[1:40:17] dispensation of the fullest of times he
[1:40:20] might gather together in one all things
[1:40:22] in Christ
[1:40:23] uh both in heaven and which are on earth
[1:40:26] even in him in whom we have obtained an
[1:40:30] inheritance now this is your heavenly
[1:40:32] bridegroom this is he's your father God
[1:40:35] speaking to you and speaking to me
[1:40:38] speaking to his uh redeemed uh purchased
[1:40:43] possession and we we'll just uh skip a
[1:40:46] little bit right here uh verse 17 this
[1:40:50] is a prayer that is uh that Paul has
[1:40:52] prayed
[1:40:54] uh and it's really powerfully gripping
[1:40:58] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:00] the father of Glory may give unto you
[1:41:03] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[1:41:05] the knowledge of him the eyes of your
[1:41:09] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:41:11] may know what is the hope of his
[1:41:14] calling what the riches of the glory of
[1:41:17] his inheritance in the Saints and what
[1:41:20] is the exceeding greatness of his power
[1:41:23] to usw who
[1:41:26] believe now his ability the word power
[1:41:29] means ability just simply God's
[1:41:32] ability his life has become your life
[1:41:37] amen the exceeding greatness so uh his
[1:41:41] ability exceeds
[1:41:43] greatness now my finite mind and perhaps
[1:41:47] yours uh maybe finds it a little
[1:41:50] sometimes a little awkward to try to uh
[1:41:54] assimilate these words and and and their
[1:41:57] their life their nature their
[1:42:00] empowerment their molding their uh their
[1:42:03] sculpting to how that we
[1:42:06] think and how that we think is how that
[1:42:09] we talk it's inevitable uh because it
[1:42:13] goes together you think it you will talk
[1:42:16] it and Jesus always talked the word of
[1:42:20] God always now we are in a human body
[1:42:24] that we uh uh you know we kind of
[1:42:35] slip of what is the exceeding greatness
[1:42:37] of his power to us work who believe
[1:42:39] according to the uh working of his
[1:42:41] mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[1:42:45] and he now uses a point of reference
[1:42:49] that he is qualifying what was said here
[1:42:53] H about his ability now the word power
[1:42:55] means ability or or another word is
[1:42:58] Authority so the point of reference that
[1:43:02] he is using to to enhance what he has
[1:43:07] just previously spoken is the
[1:43:12] resurrection which he wrought in Christ
[1:43:14] when he raised him from the dead set him
[1:43:17] at his own right hand in the heavenlies
[1:43:19] far above can we say far above
[1:43:24] all
[1:43:26] principality far above all principality
[1:43:30] and power and might and dominion and
[1:43:33] every name that is named not only in
[1:43:36] this world but also in that which is to
[1:43:39] come and has put all things under his
[1:43:43] feet and gave him to be head over all
[1:43:47] things to the church or to the body
[1:43:51] which is his body the fullness of him
[1:43:54] that fills all and all you know when
[1:43:57] when we just contemplate I have his
[1:44:01] fullness it may be measured but the
[1:44:04] measuring uh is a part of his fullness
[1:44:08] in this
[1:44:11] body
[1:44:15] Hallelujah so now we'll go back I wanted
[1:44:18] just to express to you uh some of the
[1:44:20] father's words to you uh you know know
[1:44:23] it's nice to get a uh some words of that
[1:44:27] magnitude in nature uh from somebody
[1:44:30] that knows you better than
[1:44:32] anybody Lord
[1:44:36] so the the fragment of verse number 10
[1:44:40] is give me a
[1:44:43] man so that's my subject to you give me
[1:44:46] a
[1:44:47] man
[1:44:49] and uh actually Jesus liked and put
[1:44:53] value on
[1:44:57] fragments he said take them up so this
[1:45:01] fra fragment here uh give me a
[1:45:06] man uh to
[1:45:12] fight if you wanted to fast forward to
[1:45:15] uh uh Luke chapter 1 you don't have to
[1:45:19] turn uh there's a gentleman that is kind
[1:45:22] of uh
[1:45:23] well stricken in years
[1:45:26] now you know we don't like to use those
[1:45:29] those expressions will
[1:45:32] stricken uh but his name was Zacharias
[1:45:36] he had a wife and his na her name was
[1:45:40] pardon
[1:45:41] me uh his her name was
[1:45:45] Elizabeth and they a around this time
[1:45:48] there's this Angelic
[1:45:51] activity so uh here's an angel that
[1:45:54] comes to
[1:45:56] Zacharias and tells him now you your
[1:46:00] wife
[1:46:01] is uh kind of up in years but you you
[1:46:05] you all are going to have a b a boy his
[1:46:08] name's going to be
[1:46:10] John now
[1:46:12] Zacharias
[1:46:14] disbelieved now what made this worse for
[1:46:18] them was Zacharias and Elizabeth had a
[1:46:26] precedent and that precedent was Abraham
[1:46:30] and
[1:46:31] Sarah so they had a
[1:46:34] precedent of Abraham and
[1:46:38] Sarah and by them having this precedent
[1:46:42] in the history of
[1:46:46] Israel uh that just didn't allow them to
[1:46:50] escape uh so easily so Zacharias was uh
[1:46:56] uh stricken with without uh uh with
[1:47:00] speechlessness let me put it like that
[1:47:04] uh if I said
[1:47:07] dumb I use the word speechlessness
[1:47:11] because actually that's a euphan ISM
[1:47:14] that takes the the bite off of the the
[1:47:17] and the sharpness off of what what was
[1:47:20] said
[1:47:23] now the angel of the Lord C comes to
[1:47:29] Mary and tells her something that is
[1:47:32] biologically
[1:47:36] impossible Mary had no
[1:47:40] president but this is what she said to
[1:47:43] the angel of the of the
[1:47:45] Lord she said be it unto
[1:47:48] me according to your word
[1:47:53] be it unto me you know I don't know how
[1:47:56] this will transpire but be it unto me
[1:47:59] sir according to your
[1:48:03] word and of course here comes the Lord
[1:48:06] Jesus Christ Emmanuel God With Us on the
[1:48:11] scene and
[1:48:13] uh he was given uh to the World on the
[1:48:17] world
[1:48:19] stage and I call him the Wonderman
[1:48:23] I think we all have
[1:48:25] our insights and ideas I call him the
[1:48:29] Wonderman I I call him the
[1:48:32] Superman this person of Christ the
[1:48:36] Wonderman of Eternity the Wonderman of
[1:48:39] God the
[1:48:40] Superman he was God's first Superman but
[1:48:45] he he was not his
[1:48:47] last you might want to think of the
[1:48:49] person sitting beside in front or behind
[1:48:51] you and and and look at them and they're

[1:49:36] Hallelujah here at this person of Christ
[1:49:39] he he condescended in Al Scurry he con

[1:49:49] the image of the invisible God he he
[1:49:53] divested himself of and took up of his
[1:49:56] own Glory he took upon himself the form
[1:50:00] of a servant he took upon himself Flesh
[1:50:03] and Blood amen hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:50:07] he lived like a man Walk Like a Man
[1:50:10] actually his body being an Earthly body

[1:51:37] Destruction brother brandham so
[1:51:40] enlightened so much about that realm
[1:51:42] that
[1:51:43] we you know that most people don't uh
[1:51:47] live in uh such as any sickness or
[1:51:51] disease he said said now that's only
[1:51:54] what the medical community calls it he
[1:51:57] said but what it is it's a
[1:52:00] [Applause]
[1:52:02] devil why don't you tell somebody I you
[1:52:06] I'm not going to get your medication for
[1:52:10] a you why would you feed a devil you
[1:52:15] understand what I'm saying it it is a
[1:52:18] devil a destroyer
[1:52:26] Jesus said it fed
[1:52:29] thousands he provided fish when there
[1:52:31] was no
[1:52:35] fish he satisfied the claims of divine
[1:52:39] Justice he met every requirement of
[1:52:42] Divine
[1:52:44] Law I couldn't do it you couldn't do it
[1:52:48] but he did it and the beauty of it is he
[1:52:51] did it for you
[1:52:53] and you're you're the one that it's
[1:52:55] credited to he defeated death by
[1:53:01] death he defeated the
[1:53:04] curse by becoming a
[1:53:08] curse Satan is eternally
[1:53:12] defeated there cannot be Eternal
[1:53:16] Redemption without an eternal eternally
[1:53:19] defeated enemy so Satan the enemy The
[1:53:23] Ark enemy of God and Humanity he is
[1:53:27] eternally
[1:53:29] defeated that's right and you are as a
[1:53:33] recipient eternally
[1:53:36] alive actually there's a statement that
[1:53:39] I love and embrace it's in Hebrews 2:14
[1:53:43] uh maybe Brethren you could put it up on
[1:53:45] the on the wall Hebrews 2:14
[1:53:49] and and could we look at it read it
[1:53:52] together for as much then as the
[1:53:55] children are flesh partakers of Flesh
[1:53:57] and Blood he also likewise himself took
[1:54:01] part of the same that through
[1:54:04] death that through death because he
[1:54:06] didn't stay there that through death he
[1:54:09] might
[1:54:12] destroy I love those words he might
[1:54:16] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:54:19] that is the devil now other renderings
[1:54:22] and I I I love to read other
[1:54:26] renderings and this is what other
[1:54:28] renderings say that through death he may
[1:54:32] the word destroy means he brought to
[1:54:39] not now You mathematicians that are
[1:54:41] sitting here this morning uh early
[1:54:44] afternoon
[1:54:47] uh uh Zero from whatever is still zero
[1:54:52] he brought him to not let's let's just
[1:54:55] say that he was brought to
[1:54:58] not so Satan does what he does by
[1:55:03] intimidation he knows he can never get
[1:55:05] the upper hand of that that real that
[1:55:08] believer when they are word
[1:55:11] conscious
[1:55:13] Hallelujah when they are versed in the
[1:55:15] word as you people are and and have the
[1:55:18] root system that is deeply embedded in
[1:55:21] the soul oil of the of the word of
[1:55:25] God that he might render him powerless
[1:55:29] which is another state uh uh translation
[1:55:32] that he might re Reen re render him
[1:55:35] powerless that had the power of death
[1:55:38] that is the
[1:55:40] devil you let's just say it together
[1:55:42] Satan you you have no authority over
[1:55:48] me Satan doesn't have any authority over
[1:55:51] you
[1:55:52] hallelujah thank God his life his
[1:55:56] sacrifice his death made it possible and
[1:55:59] a
[1:56:00] reality of being born from above by his
[1:56:04] imperishable incorrupt Incorruptible
[1:56:08] kingly Royal seed now I like to I like
[1:56:12] to use those
[1:56:13] words if you knew where I came from
[1:56:16] those words are extremely meaningful to
[1:56:19] me his imperishable
[1:56:22] Incorruptible

[1:56:26] Royal
[1:56:28] Hallelujah

[1:58:05] um there were some other another Angelic
[1:58:10] activity you'll remember these
[1:58:12] words I am sent from the presence of
[1:58:17] almighty God to tell you of your unusual
[1:58:22] ual
[1:58:23] life ever remember those those
[1:58:27] words to tell you of your unusual life
[1:58:31] God gave to the world a
[1:58:36] man I'll say it again God gave to the
[1:58:40] world a
[1:58:43] man it it is like that he provided the
[1:58:48] awesome
[1:58:49] dessert before the main Corp
[1:58:53] because he started out with uh with what
[1:58:57] would be revent and a common denominator
[1:59:00] with all humans they want they want to
[1:59:03] be better they want a better quality of
[1:59:05] life they they don't they don't want to
[1:59:07] be sick and they don't want to uh you
[1:59:10] you know on and on so it's almost like
[1:59:13] they started out with the dessert if you
[1:59:15] don't mind me uh me healing
[1:59:18] is it's not desert but in my
[1:59:23] trying to
[1:59:24] illustrate until the main course
[1:59:29] until that seventh messenger began to
[1:59:33] drop the
[1:59:34] morsels to the
[1:59:37] predestinated that that only God knew
[1:59:40] where they
[1:59:42] were brother Brooks it was on a
[1:59:46] playground uh brother George I think uh
[1:59:51] brother brandham came up up to the
[1:59:52] pickup said oh my look it's a fin
[1:59:55] looking uh bunch of preachers
[1:59:58] here a amen so God gave a
[2:00:05] man that would uh that through him the
[2:00:08] the
[2:00:10] attention W would be
[2:00:13] attracted so that we would be uh put in
[2:00:16] a position and order that we could hear
[2:00:19] what he's saying
[2:00:22] yes so when he when he began to drop
[2:00:26] those morsels to the predestinated
[2:00:31] eagle glory be to
[2:00:34] God you you didn't know who you was you
[2:00:37] might have been the a member of uh uh
[2:00:40] whatever religious order or system but
[2:00:43] when you begin to ingest and digest and
[2:00:47] assimilate not just for the sake oh I
[2:00:50] want to be a part of that group no no no
[2:00:52] no that doesn't work be because it's
[2:00:55] something to special to you the IND
[2:01:01] individual I know people that uh uh they
[2:01:03] let the the the uh the the females let
[2:01:06] their hair grow just to be a part of a
[2:01:10] group you
[2:01:13] know maybe maybe it's okay but when when
[2:01:16] you have a personal
[2:01:20] experience when when when when the Holy
[2:01:23] Spirit drops that word into your heart
[2:01:27] into your mind my brother and sister uh
[2:01:31] it doesn't matter what anyone else is
[2:01:33] doing it doesn't matter what they're
[2:01:35] thinking it doesn't matter where they're
[2:01:37] going it doesn't matter where they live
[2:01:40] it doesn't matter what they drive my
[2:01:43] brother and sister uh that that you are
[2:01:46] set
[2:01:47] apart and when you're set apart you're
[2:01:50] set above
[2:01:53] because you can't be set apart without
[2:01:55] being set above than Lord God gave us a
[2:02:03] man in
[2:02:05] 1966 brother TL
[2:02:07] osbor how many you ever heard the
[2:02:10] memorial addressed by Brother osbor
[2:02:14] sure it I I'm assuming that it would
[2:02:17] still be available
[2:02:19] friends it is Absolut absolutely
[2:02:23] magnificent and just an as an
[2:02:26] excerpt this is what brother Osman which
[2:02:28] brother brandham thought a lot of
[2:02:30] brother Os from what I
[2:02:32] get he and he said we had
[2:02:37] forgotten we had forgotten what God was
[2:02:42] like we had forgotten how he
[2:02:46] acted we had forgotten what he looked
[2:02:50] like but but he crossed our
[2:02:53] paths
[2:02:55] again first time it was
[2:02:59] Christ uh uh the word personified but
[2:03:03] this
[2:03:04] time he crossed our path
[2:03:08] again in the person of a little
[2:03:12] Kian and he showed us what God was like
[2:03:18] now I wasn't there and perhaps the
[2:03:22] majority of you wasn't wasn't
[2:03:25] there
[2:03:27] uh I remember the gentleman's name and I
[2:03:31] think he still living and if that be the
[2:03:34] case he's well over a hundred years of
[2:03:37] age his name was Ernest
[2:03:41] fure he's gone
[2:03:45] okay uh we had went we had gone to
[2:03:49] because uh brother Jackson Raymond
[2:03:52] Jackson was going to be at his uh
[2:03:54] facility in Christiansburg
[2:03:57] Virginia and so we went to hear Brother
[2:03:59] Jackson and at that time they brother
[2:04:03] fer was making provisions and you know
[2:04:06] in the planning uh stages of having
[2:04:09] brother brandham
[2:04:10] coming uh I believe perhaps in the
[2:04:14] spring of the following
[2:04:16] year but you know unfortunately that
[2:04:20] never happened
[2:04:22] and
[2:04:24] uh but the beauty of God sending a
[2:04:33] man that could tell a ring
[2:04:37] bull I'm
[2:04:40] sorry I've trespassed on your
[2:04:44] territory and now Brothers he didn't say
[2:04:48] now I don't have my gun he just said I'm
[2:04:52] sorry that I've trespassed on your
[2:04:54] territory because uh it was said of
[2:04:57] brother brandham that he was a Millenia
[2:05:02] man I remember Billy Paul saying when he
[2:05:06] was asked what are you what's the one
[2:05:09] thing that stands out uh with your
[2:05:13] father and his words were he knew how to
[2:05:17] handle every situation
[2:05:22] Well if I knew how to
[2:05:25] handle 20% of my
[2:05:29] situations I I would be doing pretty
[2:05:32] good but uh but Billy Paul brother Billy
[2:05:35] Paul said he uh he knew how to handle
[2:05:40] every
[2:05:48] situation so he crossed our path
[2:05:57] so the the ones that received the as I
[2:06:01] referenced the the
[2:06:04] morsels they they be they realized now
[2:06:08] I'm more than a product of a religious
[2:06:11] system or
[2:06:13] order they began to realize this is not
[2:06:17] only William bram's time this is my time
[2:06:23] and this is still our
[2:06:29] time well let me go from that point God
[2:06:34] give us a
[2:06:35] man God give us a
[2:06:40] man so in Guyana South America the Holy
[2:06:45] Ghost began
[2:06:46] grooming a young mid-
[2:06:50] teenager that in
[2:06:53] time will become a soul
[2:06:56] winner a magnanimous
[2:06:59] blessing an an equal
[2:07:03] inspiration a teacher a
[2:07:07] mentor I'm talking for me and a
[2:07:14] friend could I read it
[2:07:16] again I I did a good job with this folks
[2:07:19] don't don't
[2:07:22] don't don't stare at me too too hard so
[2:07:26] the Holy Spirit began grooming a mid
[2:07:33] teenager that that in time would become
[2:07:37] a soul
[2:07:41] winner a tremendous
[2:07:44] blessing and equal
[2:07:47] inspiration a
[2:07:48] teacher a mentor a
[2:07:53] friend brother
[2:07:55] Simon my path in life was crossed in the
[2:07:59] sun in the country of
[2:08:02] Singapore
[2:08:04] and I all I can say the rest is somewhat
[2:08:09] history and uh that that was the
[2:08:12] beginning of a beautiful beautiful uh
[2:08:18] fellowship at a mid teenager the Holy
[2:08:21] Spirit
[2:08:22] accompanied his preaching with
[2:08:25] Supernatural
[2:08:29] confirmation mid
[2:08:31] teenager brother Simon was experiencing
[2:08:35] the favor of God that the Bible says
[2:08:39] surrounds us like a shield he was
[2:08:42] experiencing
[2:08:43] healings not just a headache these
[2:08:48] that's important yes but they were
[2:08:51] physic IAL undeniable
[2:08:55] miracles
[2:08:57] signs devil screaming coming out of the
[2:09:02] the poor
[2:09:05] victims why was he able to do
[2:09:08] this and I'm just about through why was
[2:09:11] he able to do
[2:09:13] this no one had told him you
[2:09:18] can't you that you can't
[2:09:24] Hallelujah uh you know I know
[2:09:28] brother Eastman mentioned last night and
[2:09:30] I thoroughly enjoyed you know that
[2:09:32] portion of him describing their
[2:09:34] relationship and friendship over the
[2:09:37] over year the years and
[2:09:40] U
[2:09:46] uh the reason that brother Simon still
[2:09:49] calls out Devils today
[2:09:53] screaming I'm serious because that
[2:09:57] nobody has told him the state preser
[2:10:00] didn't tell
[2:10:02] him his uh professor in college never
[2:10:07] told
[2:10:08] him uh brother George never told
[2:10:13] him brother Brooks never told him
[2:10:16] brother Keith never told him uh that you
[2:10:20] can't do that
[2:10:22] that was only for one
[2:10:25] no the whole body is
[2:10:28] filled with a with an
[2:10:31] ability with a a a glory with a an
[2:10:36] authority look if you if you don't if
[2:10:40] you don't Faith doesn't require any kind
[2:10:43] of sense evidence Faith doesn't require
[2:10:46] you feeling better Faith doesn't require
[2:10:49] uh well uh uh things are different faith
[2:10:53] has one Foundation that it rests on and
[2:10:57] that is the word or the promise of God
[2:11:00] your condition may not change
[2:11:03] immediately overnight or in a week or or
[2:11:05] two weeks but my brother and sister you
[2:11:08] stay there based on the promise of God
[2:11:12] and I will guarantee you that ability of
[2:11:15] the master is going to start working its
[2:11:18] way glory be to God working its way
[2:11:22] through those conditions and and
[2:11:24] physical uh physical disabilities and
[2:11:28] what have you my brother and bringing
[2:11:30] you Deliverance bringing you Victory say
[2:11:35] Amen well I just can't get it off my
[2:11:37] mind well the doctor said this and the
[2:11:41] physician said whatever uh I remember uh
[2:11:45] I spent a number of years in the Air
[2:11:47] Force and I do want to remind brother
[2:11:49] Simon uh that there's a an initial I in
[2:11:53] sports that means injured
[2:11:57] reserve but in the US military brother
[2:12:00] George if you you remember IR
[2:12:03] means
[2:12:08] uh hang on don't feel sorry for me
[2:12:17] yeah when you're discharged from the the
[2:12:20] military
[2:12:21] they tack on two
[2:12:25] years I know what the Air Force did they
[2:12:28] tack on two years and uh it is inactive
[2:12:35] reserve and what they're telling you
[2:12:38] don't you don't get too comfortable with
[2:12:40] your uniform uh and letting the moss eat
[2:12:44] holes in it because you may be putting
[2:12:47] it back on within that twoyear period of
[2:12:50] time
[2:12:52] so uh so the IR the uh
[2:12:58] inactive
[2:13:03] reserve now he's he's only 18 months
[2:13:07] out I mean he's got 18 months to go he's
[2:13:10] only six months out so he's got to te
[2:13:14] keep his suits nicely pressed shirts
[2:13:18] nicely pressed shoes shine
[2:13:21] my say
[2:13:23] Amen see and ready for the call or duty
[2:13:28] at any
[2:13:30] time
[2:13:34] now you've that's been around brother
[2:13:38] Simon
[2:13:40] uh you know he's impeccably
[2:13:43] dressed his presentation is
[2:13:46] impeccable and that's the way the way it
[2:13:49] should be uh I like it when he's
[2:13:53] ministering with us for us and he he
[2:13:56] just breaks out in a into a
[2:13:59] song it just it's in in
[2:14:03] sync so no one told him that he couldn't
[2:14:06] do what he uh began to do and that he
[2:14:09] continues to do he had no religious
[2:14:14] platform but he had plenty of
[2:14:19] passion brother Danny referenced last
[2:14:24] night that brother Simon told him one
[2:14:27] day we're going to have a new building a
[2:14:29] new place to
[2:14:31] assemble that we can worship that's
[2:14:34] going to the building and property is
[2:14:36] going to be worth
[2:14:38] millions we're sitting in it
[2:14:44] today the reason that brother Simon
[2:14:47] makes a different difference rather is
[2:14:50] because he is
[2:14:54] different he preaches with depth and
[2:15:00] practicality he is set
[2:15:02] apart and set
[2:15:05] above he is he has an amazing spiritual
[2:15:09] resume that he is still working
[2:15:15] on so we're
[2:15:18] appreciative that brother Simon brother
[2:15:20] John Simon
[2:15:22] will not give up back up shut up or let
[2:15:28] up until he is taken
[2:15:41] up now I don't mean this for this but by
[2:15:44] any means to sound morbid uh it's just a
[2:15:48] part of life this is called the Dash and
[2:15:52] musicians you can you can come to your
[2:15:54] instruments if you'd
[2:15:56] like I read of a man who stood to speak
[2:15:59] at the funeral of a friend he referred
[2:16:02] to the dates on the tombstone from the
[2:16:06] beginning to the
[2:16:07] end he noted that the first came the
[2:16:10] date of birth and spoke of the following
[2:16:14] date with
[2:16:16] tears but he said What mattered most of
[2:16:19] all was the dash between those
[2:16:23] years for that Dash represents all the
[2:16:28] time that was spent alive on Earth and
[2:16:32] now only
[2:16:33] those who loved know what that little
[2:16:38] line is
[2:16:39] worth for it matters not how much we own
[2:16:43] the cars the house the cash what matters
[2:16:46] is how we live and love and how we spend
[2:16:50] our Dash
[2:16:51] so think about this long and
[2:16:55] hard are there things you'd like to
[2:16:58] change for you never know how much time
[2:17:01] is
[2:17:02] left that can still be
[2:17:06] rearranged if we could just slow down
[2:17:09] enough to consider what's true and real
[2:17:12] and always try to understand the way
[2:17:15] other people
[2:17:17] feel and be less quick to anger and show
[2:17:21] appreciation more and love the people in
[2:17:24] our lives like we've never loved
[2:17:27] before if we treat each other with
[2:17:31] respect and more often wear a smile
[2:17:34] remembering that this special Dash might
[2:17:38] only last a little
[2:17:40] while so when your eulogy has been read
[2:17:44] with your life's actions to rehash would
[2:17:47] you be proud of the things they say
[2:17:50] about about how you spent your
[2:17:54] dash can we just stand to our
[2:18:06] feet thank you once again for you
[2:18:08] allowing me to speak to
[2:18:10] you my lips get
[2:18:14] dry my mouth gets dry
[2:18:18] [Music]
[2:18:22] let's just sing what we sang while
[2:18:25] ago I'm not on an ego
[2:18:30] trip I'm not on an ego trip I'm nothing
[2:18:36] on my
[2:18:38] own I make
[2:18:41] mistakes I often slip just common Flesh
[2:18:47] and
[2:18:49] Bones but you see someday just what I
[2:18:54] say I'm of a
[2:18:57] special kind I want to emphasize it when

[2:20:07] thorns on his
[2:20:10] head his blood was on that Scarlet
[2:20:15] Ro it stain a crimson red
[2:20:21] and though his eyes were on the crowd he
[2:20:27] looked

[2:22:18] sister uh

[2:22:29] your kindness
[2:22:31] generosity uh the capabilities much
[2:22:35] better than
[2:22:38] myself I I failed on one remark for
[2:22:41] brother
[2:22:44] Simon very few people have I met in
[2:22:48] life that is a
[2:22:51] generous with
[2:22:54] time other
[2:22:56] resources that brother John Simon
[2:23:00] is that it's one of the greatest
[2:23:02] attributes qualities that a Christian a
[2:23:06] Believer could ever
[2:23:09] possess I'm sure there's
[2:23:12] [Music]
[2:23:16] others and I love him Hallelujah

[2:24:46] [Music]
[2:24:50] let me ask you this question how many
[2:24:52] feel after hearing what we heard today
[2:24:55] that you're a little bit bigger
[2:24:59] hallelujah amen a little bit stronger
[2:25:02] than you thought you were before you
[2:25:04] came in here had a little bit more
[2:25:07] Authority than you thought you had when
[2:25:10] you came in here
[2:25:11] anybody and as we sing
[2:25:15] this as we sing this just remember
[2:25:17] you're part of this all right bigger
[2:25:19] than all my problems bigger than all my
[2:25:23] fears God Is Bigger than any mountain
[2:25:26] that I can or cannot
[2:25:30] see he's bigger than all my questions
[2:25:34] bigger than anything God Is Bigger than
[2:25:38] any mountain that I can or cannot
[2:25:43] see oh bigger than all the Shadows that
[2:25:47] fall across my path God is bigger than
[2:25:51] any mountain that I can or cannot
[2:25:56] see he's bigger than all

[2:32:33] Pastor John Simon you may be all seated
[2:32:36] just for a
[2:32:38] moment
[2:32:39] um I just want to uh take a few
[2:32:43] moments to um you
[2:32:48] know the transition and and uh the um
[2:32:53] you know you might want to call it a
[2:32:55] retirement we you know this weekend we
[2:32:57] we see it in a much greater way we see
[2:32:59] it as a a life of
[2:33:01] achievement and um there's a um a saying
[2:33:07] or a
[2:33:08] title it's
[2:33:12] emitis the word is spelled e m e r i t
[2:33:17] s so what about this term emor us what
[2:33:20] does it
[2:33:21] mean it's a Latin word referring to one
[2:33:24] who has earned his discharge by faithful
[2:33:30] service it's a kind of the opposite of
[2:33:34] dishonorable
[2:33:37] discharge in the military in 1 Timothy
[2:33:41] 5:17 it says let the elders who rule
[2:33:44] well be considered worthy of double
[2:33:48] honor
[2:33:51] especially those who labor in preaching
[2:33:53] and teaching well I was honored a
[2:33:57] hundred ways while I was pastor of
[2:34:03] Bethlehem John
[2:34:05] Simon was honored and we could honor him
[2:34:09] a thousand ways as the pastor of eagles
[2:34:13] cry
[2:34:14] Ministries and later good neighbor
[2:34:17] Ministries
[2:34:20] and today it's very
[2:34:22] important for us to recognize this
[2:34:27] transition and for us as a congregation
[2:34:31] and his
[2:34:33] sheep to say
[2:34:36] Shepherd we release
[2:34:39] you we let you and your precious wife
[2:34:43] move on to the next stage of what God
[2:34:49] has has in store for
[2:34:53] you when you're in the service of the
[2:34:56] Lord and you are called of God as a Son
[2:34:58] of God we know it's an eternal
[2:35:02] call it's not a temporary call yes we do
[2:35:07] experience position here on Earth and
[2:35:11] God gives us certain positions and
[2:35:13] authorities but when we as Sons and
[2:35:17] Daughters of God are awak
[2:35:20] we
[2:35:21] recognize we have no beginning and we
[2:35:24] have no
[2:35:26] end and so it's important for us here
[2:35:30] naturally to release our pastor and his
[2:35:34] wife and to say we love you we support
[2:35:39] you we will always be there for you
[2:35:42] because you are our father and our
[2:35:44] mother spiritually and you will always
[2:35:48] be um in important and respected and you
[2:35:52] will have the double honor that you
[2:35:55] fully deserve for the years of
[2:35:57] dedication and service and and love that
[2:36:01] you showed towards us brother Bob made a
[2:36:04] statement and said a man of
[2:36:07] generosity I have not met somebody
[2:36:10] that's as generous as John
[2:36:13] Simon it's as simple as that he gives in
[2:36:17] every
[2:36:18] way and so because of that he's made us
[2:36:23] better
[2:36:24] sheep he's made us better
[2:36:28] people and he's given us examples of how
[2:36:32] to live and how to
[2:36:36] minister the word of life and the word
[2:36:38] of God and
[2:36:41] so um we've got a
[2:36:43] plaque that um was placed at the front
[2:36:48] you'll notice it
[2:36:50] as you come in the front
[2:36:52] doors there's the plaque there it's
[2:36:55] placed and it has been permanently glued
[2:36:59] to the glass and it will stay there as
[2:37:03] long as we are
[2:37:06] here and until we
[2:37:09] go and it says honoring Pastor John
[2:37:12] Simon and sister Desiree for dedicating
[2:37:16] your lives to the ministry of Jesus
[2:37:19] Christ
[2:37:20] and through your
[2:37:21] leadership through obedience to the holy
[2:37:24] spirit with love the good neighbor

[2:37:55] come and stand here next
[2:38:00] to Pastor John God bless you thank
[2:38:08] you thanks be to God first of all I want
[2:38:13] to say welcome to every one of you
[2:38:16] represented here today I thank you for
[2:38:19] for uh returning to your
[2:38:22] roots
[2:38:25] uh I also want to uh thank God for
[2:38:31] friends and relatives that are here
[2:38:36] today I'm happy for those who have known
[2:38:39] me from
[2:38:41] Boyhood and those who have known me
[2:38:45] since God brought me into the ministry
[2:38:48] uh here on this point as you know I am
[2:38:52] not a pastor that ever took over any any
[2:38:57] church all the churches that have come
[2:39:00] out from this ministry were God allowed
[2:39:04] them to be founded by me the foundations
[2:39:08] were laid and then pastors were left to
[2:39:11] Carry On by the grace of God uh that's
[2:39:14] the way it has always been and God never
[2:39:19] never allowed me to build an
[2:39:22] organization or a church
[2:39:25] that's 3,000 thousands could have been
[2:39:29] but every time I would get to maybe 500
[2:39:35] 550 he'll just cut it in half back down
[2:39:38] to
[2:39:41] 250 sometimes it goes down to
[2:39:45] 120 and then it builds back up again it
[2:39:48] goes up and gets there well now things
[2:39:51] are going to really it goes right back
[2:39:53] down but I never noticed it that it was
[2:39:58] churches coming off churches coming off
[2:40:01] like that and then once I understood
[2:40:04] that I became at peace with myself and
[2:40:08] realized what God was doing with his own
[2:40:11] plan and his own program uh just I'm I'm
[2:40:16] not going to speak much because I have
[2:40:17] to speak tonight and and I don't want to
[2:40:20] uh I'm not wanting using a double barrel
[2:40:23] on you or acent right because some
[2:40:26] preachers want to use an accent
[2:40:28] 238s uh uh on you but I wouldn't do that
[2:40:33] but praise the Lord it was has been a
[2:40:35] wonderful ride a wonderful journey and I
[2:40:38] thank God for that called at 12 years
[2:40:42] old uh you know uh in the form of uh the
[2:40:46] face of the Lord Jesus Christ person of
[2:40:49] the Lord Jesus Christ coming I didn't
[2:40:52] know at that time who it was later it
[2:40:55] came to realized who it was and at 14 as
[2:41:00] our brother testified the burning of in
[2:41:04] my heart because I wasn't a member of
[2:41:07] any church I went to the Catholic school
[2:41:10] and the Catholic church because that's
[2:41:13] how we can get an education at the time
[2:41:17] and so that burning was so much that
[2:41:21] myself and Bishop Michael Patterson of
[2:41:26] uh Georgia buur Georgia uh took to the
[2:41:30] streets as young men and we began to
[2:41:33] preach make it quickly a Revival broke
[2:41:36] out there was still a Pentecostal Church
[2:41:38] there of about 2500 people because of
[2:41:42] that Revival that broke out in that city
[2:41:45] so we thank the Lord for that then he
[2:41:48] took me to the to the uh the Assemblies
[2:41:50] of God give me a scholarship went to
[2:41:53] their school and then the prophet's
[2:41:55] message came right and when the message
[2:41:59] came of course they said for certain
[2:42:01] doctrines which you hold that are
[2:42:04] contrary to our F Fai you are hereby
[2:42:09] excommunicated so I I I thank them very
[2:42:12] much for the
[2:42:14] letter because I said at least you
[2:42:16] admitted it is contrary to your faith
[2:42:19] but not to the word of
[2:42:26] God and I remember that uh wonderful
[2:42:31] gentleman wonderful people uh no
[2:42:33] problems there wonderful people but I
[2:42:36] was in the meeting up here in Al
[2:42:39] Alberta and first time in Canada brother
[2:42:42] Perry green had uh brought me up along
[2:42:46] with the uh the Johnson boy from not boy
[2:42:50] now man in Arizona and Fran liar from
[2:42:54] Switzerland uh we came up with a lot of
[2:42:57] stuff books and stuff like that to
[2:43:00] preach in the uh first real tent meeting
[2:43:04] they were having there for bringing the
[2:43:06] Believers together that came out from
[2:43:09] Brother branham's Ministry uh and so
[2:43:12] myself brother Hiller Brandt and brother
[2:43:15] uh B Blitz I believe yes uh the that
[2:43:19] helped to you know put up the tent there
[2:43:22] and we were working brother perigrine
[2:43:24] went back to Arizona because he had an
[2:43:26] emergency and so there I was uh and uh
[2:43:32] nobody knew I was a preacher and I
[2:43:34] didn't tell him I was a preacher we just
[2:43:37] did what have to be done the meetings
[2:43:39] started they were going on and then this
[2:43:42] little man comes through the crowd to me
[2:43:45] and brother says who are you this is
[2:43:49] brother Ernie fander he said who are you
[2:43:51] I said oh you know I'm just from Guyana
[2:43:55] I'm just a brother and Christ he said no
[2:43:59] no no he says I feel something coming
[2:44:02] out of you every time you shout
[2:44:05] hallelujah and amen and I wanted to know
[2:44:09] who's that so that's why he came down he
[2:44:13] says come and preach to my church and I
[2:44:16] said okay brother I'll come right and
[2:44:18] then
[2:44:19] he went and told them I'm a preacher
[2:44:21] they asked me to preach and then the
[2:44:23] Holy Spirit moved in a special way and
[2:44:26] that way um the preachers start coming
[2:44:30] with having churches with in those days
[2:44:33] it was a big church if you had two and
[2:44:34] three 100 people so um uh they asked me
[2:44:39] and I said no I can't come he said why
[2:44:41] so brother fandon said but you only has
[2:44:44] what five men in or five or six men in a
[2:44:47] farmhouse said so uh we have a big
[2:44:50] church I said no it's not like that I
[2:44:53] already committed to him I'm going there
[2:44:56] right so it worked out that way I went
[2:44:59] there and I can't tell you all of this
[2:45:01] anyway it was just marvelous my wife is
[2:45:04] standing up here too long
[2:45:11] and and but she stood by me for such a
[2:45:14] long
[2:45:16] time amen
[2:45:24] I did not even realize or C the years
[2:45:27] that actually being in Ministry over 64
[2:45:30] years preaching the
[2:45:32] gospel
[2:45:36] my it's only when a brother mentioned it
[2:45:39] the other night and they wait a minute
[2:45:41] my goodness I'm
[2:45:46] old my goodness it's marvelous I thank
[2:45:51] God for that he gave me this Grace I'm
[2:45:53] not finished you know we just use the
[2:45:56] terminology of retirement but really
[2:45:59] Servants of God can't and don't retire
[2:46:03] but as far as human life the Holy Spirit
[2:46:06] comes to me in the night and says it's
[2:46:09] time for you to step
[2:46:11] down and step aside now he has something
[2:46:15] else that he has me to do but I don't
[2:46:17] know what that is yet but I've learned
[2:46:20] to just obey regardless of the
[2:46:24] circumstances so that's the reason if
[2:46:27] you're thinking and wondering of what's
[2:46:29] the reason that you do that if he can
[2:46:32] take Phillip at the height of a Revival
[2:46:35] or as we would say of success and move
[2:46:38] him out of there to go speak to one man
[2:46:42] he's still the same
[2:46:44] God why why do we why are we puzzled by
[2:46:47] these things right if you're really a
[2:46:50] servant of God you're moved by the
[2:46:52] spirit of God and the spirit of God just
[2:46:55] moves you praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:46:58] I'll mention to you also that you know
[2:47:01] the scriptures all Tidings in the church
[2:47:04] belongs to the pastor how many knows
[2:47:08] that but what God didn't allow me to do
[2:47:11] that I just have been taking a
[2:47:15] salary you understand taking a salary
[2:47:19] it's right there and from Young it's not
[2:47:22] from coming here but while young seeing
[2:47:26] the life of Billy
[2:47:28] gram uh and the example he never had any
[2:47:33] questions about him and money and and
[2:47:36] investigation nothing of the sort the
[2:47:39] man lived a clean wonderful life and
[2:47:42] that so struck me as a young man that I
[2:47:46] said I'm just going to stay that way
[2:47:49] and I'm going to walk in that kind of a
[2:47:51] way I just need to live I don't need to
[2:47:55] use or have the church to be the means
[2:47:58] of uh getting rich or this or that but I
[2:48:02] am going to just live God's life and
[2:48:04] live the way he wants me to live now I'm
[2:48:07] not saying that that that should be the
[2:48:09] way for everybody I'm just telling you
[2:48:12] that's the way he has dealt with me amen
[2:48:15] God may make another person prosper and
[2:48:17] have all that's wonderful and I will all
[2:48:20] the way praise God and thank God for
[2:48:22] them amen wonderful but this is the way
[2:48:25] I'm just talking of the way he has led
[2:48:27] me and brought me along to this time so
[2:48:30] I'm here and I thank God for it thank
[2:48:33] God for you all my friends and brothers
[2:48:35] and at this portion of time uh brother
[2:48:40] Danny who was standing here God has
[2:48:45] blessed him and God will continue to use
[2:48:49] him and his precious wife sister
[2:48:53] Jennifer I didn't choose them to be in
[2:48:56] this
[2:48:57] position I did not elect them in any way
[2:49:01] you the people elected them amen uh look
[2:49:06] I did not get behind the scenes and uh
[2:49:09] uh let's say by slight of hand or evil
[2:49:13] machinations of the human mind tried to
[2:49:17] uh twist people around around or use
[2:49:19] political Maneuvers and not it's the
[2:49:22] Holy
[2:49:23] Spirit the Holy Spirit did that praise
[2:49:27] the Lord and I want to thank God for
[2:49:29] that because I can not this Bible this
[2:49:32] is still my Bible but I can hand the
[2:49:35] Baton to
[2:49:38] him hallelujah praise the Lord praise
[2:49:43] the Lord stand up brother then I know
[2:49:46] you you've seen him but but give him a
[2:49:49] second look look at him again praise the
[2:49:53] Lord and listen to him and God because
[2:49:57] it's not once you realize it's not the
[2:50:00] man anymore like it used to be in all
[2:50:02] these systems any man if God calls him
[2:50:06] and he stands in the Pulpit don't listen
[2:50:08] for just the man but listen to the voice
[2:50:13] behind his
[2:50:15] voice listen to that one and make God
[2:50:19] bless you and may you as a church will
[2:50:21] speak later this evening lead you and
[2:50:24] guide you and prosper and grow what God

[2:51:20] ministering a message just trying to
[2:51:23] tell them live a better
[2:51:26] life you come to know Christ tell him
[2:51:29] the gospel tell him about the prophet
[2:51:31] the message and they don't seem to take
[2:51:34] it you realize that maybe they're among
[2:51:37] not amongst the Chosen Few but God knows
[2:51:40] his own time maybe I'm not the one that
[2:51:43] they need to listen to maybe it's
