[7:34] [Music]
[7:47] it was not who
[7:50] sorry
[7:52] [Music]
[7:58] spirit of God
[8:00] we must give
[8:02] [Music]
[8:03] us
[8:25] today
[8:27] what would I have done
[8:30] [Music]
[8:32] if it wasn't
[8:35] for the grace
[8:38] for the grace of God in my life
[8:50] [Music]
[8:53] I was so lost
[8:58] [Music]
[9:09] always
[9:18] [Music]
[9:32] [Applause]
[9:36] [Music]
[9:49] today
[9:50] [Music]
[9:52] what would I have done
[9:57] giving praise tonight amen
[9:59] Hallelujah
[10:01] I was listening to this message here
[10:03] brother but I must talk about influence
[10:05] and he's talking about Isaiah how you
[10:07] know he had looked at uziah and his
[10:09] influence anyway he talked about
[10:12] something here it was the um
[10:15] it was the verse of the day on the life
[10:18] I thought it was really interested he
[10:20] said if I see a man walking fine looking
[10:23] man in a few years watch his hair turned
[10:26] gray and slipped out his shoulders
[10:27] dropped down a beautiful young girl
[10:29] standing with it with a scented Godly
[10:32] face on her and standing and praising
[10:34] God and I come back in a few years and
[10:36] find her stupid shoulder back in two or
[10:38] three children well my day it shows that
[10:42] in this body there is death no matter
[10:44] how well and how lovely it looks it
[10:47] still got death in it no I watch
[10:51] which a way that is spread in their
[10:54] leans it was always representing light
[10:56] speaking of light talking of light it'll
[10:59] go with the light but if it's always on
[11:02] the other side of the world on the
[11:04] things of the world influenced by the
[11:06] world there is nothing but to turn into
[11:08] darkness when it dies into the outer
[11:11] Darkness so you see what we are we must
[11:13] remember we are only what we are by the
[11:16] grace of God and none of us can brag
[11:18] about it we can only bow in our
[11:20] adoration and humility before God and
[11:22] give him praise amen as though that was

[30:11] amen praise God are you glad to be here
[30:15] praise God let's go spot on our clouds
[30:22] I know some of you work
[30:24] some of us work in the day and it's not
[30:27] easy to be here on the weekdays but
[30:29] let's check everything out from us and
[30:32] just
[30:33] come to the presence of God Amen
[30:36] um
[30:37] okay
[30:38] I think
[30:41] okay let's pray first
[30:44] oh our heavenly
[30:47] most gracious wonderful father God
[30:52] your name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:55] and you never lose a battle you never
[30:59] lost a patience you never lose a case
[31:04] father we come here tonight
[31:07] knowing very well that we ourselves we
[31:11] are nothing without you
[31:12] we invite the great Holy Ghost who spoke
[31:15] to Adam the call of the evening to come
[31:18] and speak with us we have confidence
[31:21] that anytime we come here father you you
[31:24] meet us because if the prophet said when
[31:27] we come at a certain point in time he
[31:29] knows we're going to be there that angel
[31:31] of God cast there before we even get
[31:34] here so we know you are here with us
[31:38] come and speak take me aside Lord
[31:41] and use me for your glory and honor may
[31:45] you anoint your children to hear from
[31:48] you
[31:49] oh God and it's all like you will come
[31:52] against it in the name of Jesus during
[31:55] the day if you have done anything wrong
[31:57] or any thought pass through our mind all
[31:59] ID we ask for forgiveness you have
[32:02] confidence that the blood of Christ it
[32:05] washes us from all unbelief so may you
[32:09] come and take absolute control
[32:12] of the reminder of the service father we
[32:15] thank you and we love you in Jesus name
[32:18] amen
[32:19] okay
[32:21] um as scripture will be taken from the
[32:23] career
[32:24] the career
[32:27] chapter
[32:35] Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse 1 to 7. I was
[32:39] just trying to print some quotation and
[32:41] just struggle with it so you just bear
[32:43] with me and couldn't print it at home
[32:47] came here couldn't print it still
[32:49] but
[32:51] God is in control no worry amen
[32:55] so the career chapter 4
[32:59] verse 1.
[33:01] and the angel that talked with me
[33:06] came again and wake me as a man that is
[33:10] weak out of his sleep
[33:13] and said unto me worst years down
[33:18] and I said I have looked and behold a
[33:21] candlestick
[33:22] all of God with a bow upon the top of it
[33:27] and this and his seven lamps thereon and
[33:32] seven pipes the seven lamps which are
[33:35] upon the top thereof
[33:38] and two olives three by eight one upon
[33:42] the right side of the ball and the other
[33:45] up on the left side thereof
[33:47] so I said it I answered and spoke the
[33:50] angel that talked with me
[33:53] saying what are these my Lord
[33:57] then the angel that talked with me
[33:59] answered and said unto me no words not
[34:03] thou not what this be
[34:05] and I said no my Lord
[34:10] then he answered and spoke unto me
[34:12] saying this is the word of the Lord
[34:16] unto
[34:19] this is the word of the Lord unto zeruba
[34:22] bell saying not by might nor by power
[34:27] but by my spirit
[34:31] said the Lord of hosts
[34:33] most of my thoughts were here who are
[34:36] thou o great Mountain
[34:42] that shall become a plane and he shall
[34:45] bring forth the headstone
[34:48] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[34:54] Grace on trait let's pray Heavenly
[34:58] Father
[34:59] may you bless this Rhythm of the word
[35:01] bless your people
[35:03] and bless
[35:04] and bless take control of that reminder
[35:07] of the service we thank you for the
[35:09] victory in your name amen please be
[35:11] seated
[35:13] Hallelujah
[35:15] so um
[35:16] if I were to title it
[35:19] I'll tell it to my title will be
[35:21] Sovereign Grace
[35:26] um
[35:26] as we read it said not by power not by
[35:31] might
[35:32] by my spirit says the Lord
[35:36] so has been
[35:38] coming to my heart from the whole last
[35:40] week it's not the mountain that is Holy
[35:44] by the holy God in the mountain make the
[35:47] man thing holy
[35:49] it's not a holy church
[35:52] may God in the people make the people
[35:55] holy so if you come here and think that
[35:59] this because you've come to this year
[36:01] will take you no but you have to be in
[36:05] the mystical Body of Christ you have to
[36:07] your name has to be written in the last
[36:09] book of life before the foundation of
[36:11] the world coming here with the same
[36:13] people with the same Faith congregate
[36:17] for us to receive the word of God to
[36:20] just identify us and to bring us more
[36:23] closer to God so it's not the church but
[36:26] the holy ghost in the church make the
[36:29] difference it was never the apostles but
[36:32] Christ in them that makes a difference
[36:35] the book of us where the holy ghost in
[36:37] the people that makes the difference and
[36:41] somebody like Samson
[36:44] said that he was very short and like
[36:47] mommy's boy
[36:48] but when the spirit of God comes to him
[36:51] he do wonders he can kill the lion he
[36:55] can do so many things so it wasn't
[36:58] something but it was a spirit of Christ
[37:01] in Samson that made the difference so
[37:05] tonight is not by your power or your
[37:07] might but by the spirit of God is the
[37:11] spirit that quickened
[37:18] to making life and that spirit is
[37:22] singing which is the Holy Ghost God
[37:24] himself that's why I said that
[37:26] um those who worship me will worship me
[37:29] what in truth and in spirit you need
[37:33] both the mechanics and the Dynamics amen
[37:36] there has to be a balance you can't just
[37:39] stay all of the mechanics but you also
[37:41] cannot stay all of the Dynamics both
[37:44] have to come together then it does the
[37:46] work amen so it's the same yesterday
[37:49] today and forever amen so Sons and
[37:53] Daughters of God are led by the spirit
[37:55] of God Amen if you are a son or a
[37:58] daughter of God nobody can determine
[38:00] your moves because you are not bound by
[38:03] a system
[38:04] when you are bound by a system the devil
[38:06] knows you every move but they said the
[38:09] the world
[38:10] it listed and it goes forever it goes so
[38:13] when you are led by Spirit of the Living
[38:15] God
[38:17] you can be led to do something today God
[38:19] will move rather way other way so nobody
[38:21] can really determine and pinpoint and
[38:24] kind of um
[38:26] see or move because the devil doesn't
[38:29] know what God is doing that's why it's
[38:32] important that when God reveals
[38:34] something to you you have to keep it to
[38:36] yourself
[38:37] don't just go ahead speaking everything
[38:39] that God wants you all your plans don't
[38:42] speak it out because those who are
[38:44] speaking to them they cannot do nothing
[38:46] to you but when you speak the devil
[38:48] hears it and sometimes go ahead and make
[38:51] things
[38:52] um
[38:53] mess things up but once it's in your
[38:55] heart nobody knows it when they move
[38:58] then they surprise everything it
[39:00] surprised everybody so it's better we
[39:03] try to keep things in our heart until
[39:05] when God wants you to speak amen so all
[39:09] that I'm talking today when you read the
[39:12] scripture is what Grace Grace
[39:15] we all know that Jesus Christ is The
[39:17] Headstone and the Cornerstone at the
[39:19] same time
[39:20] but the headstone the Cornerstone the
[39:22] Hearthstone was rejected is that right
[39:25] when you look at the pyramid it has no
[39:28] Capstone The Headstone was not there it
[39:31] is Christ which is capping the bride now
[39:34] and it cannot it could never have come
[39:37] in the time of Luther and all those
[39:39] pages couldn't come it only came when
[39:41] God sent the prophet of God to restore
[39:44] all things that was the right time to
[39:47] bring it in and now it's a bride of
[39:49] Christ Christ is the head in the body
[39:51] moving and doing the same thing he's in
[39:54] the bright riding the trail Once More
[39:57] Jesus Christ is for the same yesterday
[40:01] today and forever whatever his date in
[40:05] the past is gonna be doing the same
[40:06] thing amen If they raise the dead we are
[40:09] raising the dead in Jesus name they heal
[40:12] their state the sins of God are Healing
[40:14] The Sick because the same God
[40:16] if you ocean the ocean over there you
[40:20] take a glass of water it has the same
[40:23] water qualities but you are not the
[40:25] fullness but we are part part of that
[40:27] and it contains so the same God said I
[40:30] will be with you even in you unto all
[40:32] the consummation of time so the same God
[40:35] that created heaven and earth he seen
[40:38] you and in me today all that you have
[40:40] you have to have confidence
[40:43] that God that has brought us this far is
[40:46] able to take us the end
[40:48] amen
[40:55] he's a wonderful God
[40:57] Hallelujah
[40:59] praise that God
[41:02] so what are you am I saying I'm talking
[41:05] about the grace of God
[41:07] and Grace is unmerited favor
[41:11] a favor that God gave to you and me that
[41:15] none of us Merit it because not by words
[41:18] of righteousness but his grace and grace
[41:22] and grace alone the first time
[41:26] thy judgment Came Upon the Earth was the
[41:29] Garden of Eden
[41:31] the next judgment will be on the white
[41:33] throne
[41:34] the white throne and the right Throne
[41:36] judgment
[41:38] and in the Garden of Eden
[41:41] man
[41:43] Adam and Eve
[41:44] disobeyed God's word
[41:49] and when that happened the whole thing
[41:52] was black
[41:53] the human race was supposed to be black
[41:56] out
[41:57] there was no way for man
[42:01] because God has said in his word the day
[42:06] you partake that off you will die
[42:10] and God couldn't kill Eve and leave Adam
[42:14] because Adam took part knowing that he
[42:17] loved if he didn't want God to destroy
[42:19] him so he also partake part with it so
[42:23] God couldn't destroy Adam
[42:25] by the grace of God came and killed an
[42:30] animal to cover what
[42:32] to cover their sins and you cannot cover
[42:35] your sins with religion it has to be the
[42:38] blood of Christ you have to repent you
[42:41] must receive the Holy Ghost amen so when
[42:45] that thing happened
[42:48] it was so black
[42:50] and God
[42:53] came
[42:54] Grace took over
[42:57] and gave life
[42:59] back to Adam but what did that Grace did
[43:02] when the grace took over
[43:05] God stepping and make a promise that the
[43:09] woman's seed will bruise the head of the
[43:12] serpent
[43:13] and the serpent was also what Bruce the
[43:17] hill will will also bruise the heels is
[43:20] that right
[43:21] okay
[43:22] the woman's seat will bruise the head of
[43:25] the serpent seed and the Seven also
[43:28] bruise the hill that means that you're
[43:31] gonna go to afflictions
[43:34] Christianity is not a bed of ease
[43:38] we're gonna go through afflictions but
[43:41] God promised you're gonna have to have
[43:44] triumphant in all afflictions that we
[43:48] ever gonna go through
[43:50] because there's a way God said I'll
[43:53] never give you anything that you cannot
[43:56] what bear
[43:58] so by the thing of it is you must go
[44:01] through afflictions you must go through
[44:04] trials he said those that I love I
[44:07] chastise and what I rebuke so you're
[44:10] gonna go through trials
[44:12] some people
[44:14] when they see their crowds and see the
[44:17] trials that they facing they don't want
[44:19] to face it they just run away
[44:22] but
[44:23] no wonder Peter said that where can we
[44:27] go thou alone has eternal life
[44:30] preaching the gospel dedicating yourself
[44:33] to serve God it doesn't come easy
[44:37] it comes with a cross
[44:39] you're gonna go through a lot of things
[44:42] the brightest people that nobody
[44:45] said for you to know what people are
[44:47] going through at the background
[44:49] everything you do the devil is there to
[44:53] attack you another way but God greater
[44:55] is he that is in you than he that is in
[44:59] the world so you promise he will conquer
[45:01] through you he's the same yesterday
[45:03] today and forever I just now give an
[45:07] example just recently
[45:10] it's just a little bit thing it's
[45:12] already the big thing but just for you
[45:14] to know just something small I gave that
[45:18] um on the 10th of March
[45:20] I went to work
[45:22] whilst on the or I went to meet somebody
[45:25] to give a quotation for a job his name
[45:28] is Frank
[45:29] when I went there we began to talk and I
[45:33] told him how
[45:34] that um
[45:37] my uh my wife is going to Africa Ghana
[45:41] and
[45:43] when she left now I really appreciate
[45:46] her more because now I've got to do most
[45:50] of the things taking care of the case
[45:51] preparing food doing this you have to do
[45:54] all the trust plus working at the same
[45:57] time so I said that I really appreciate
[46:00] him when she comes then she sorry he
[46:04] opened up and also told me that Phil I
[46:08] am a builder I'm a framer and the man is
[46:10] in his late 70s or early 80s
[46:13] he said that
[46:14] um I've been building for years I've
[46:17] been doing a framing I'm doing
[46:18] everything my wife is home and he's
[46:21] always taking care of house chores but
[46:24] recently but yeah also she's been
[46:27] striking with sickness
[46:29] and she can't do anything
[46:31] so this man in his late 70s has to go
[46:35] home take care of every trust at home
[46:38] and he said he's getting tall on me and
[46:41] I began to uh feel for him
[46:44] so whilst I was coming home
[46:48] about five minutes to get home I began
[46:50] to think about him
[46:52] and I said okay I'm gonna put a prayer
[46:54] request I was thinking how to go about
[46:56] the prayer request how to grow
[46:57] everything about two minutes to get to
[47:00] my house boom I step on the black ice
[47:03] have a big accident and my car went like
[47:06] that hit it he came back and then you
[47:10] begin to spin and facing some oncoming
[47:13] traffic and I have to scream Jesus Jesus
[47:17] and the Lord
[47:18] helped me to navigate away from it but
[47:21] I'm trying to say that I went there only
[47:24] last week the man I saw the lady she's
[47:27] healthy moving around perfectly we're
[47:29] doing everything right but you know just
[47:32] a little prayer to go for somebody to
[47:35] get delivered from her infirmities you
[47:38] see how the enemy tried to attack me
[47:41] everything to destroy me so it's not a
[47:45] bed of ease but you got to take the
[47:48] cross that thing has come upon us we
[47:51] must take the charge we must face the
[47:53] enemy we must cut all the amalekites and
[47:58] move on because God Is So this he will
[48:00] never leave us and forsake us just two
[48:03] weeks ago too
[48:05] I have to they gave me a rented car
[48:09] the max is new
[48:11] I went to a a car base to wash my car
[48:17] I hang it there a young kid but 23 years
[48:20] he saw the car he has the same to began
[48:23] to talk
[48:24] then it led to the scriptures
[48:27] and I began to speak and I saw the
[48:29] anointing of what came on me
[48:31] speaking boldly cartoon has everything
[48:34] from the boy that is not right to help
[48:37] him by the time I realized the new match
[48:40] that's the car I wake up is gone
[48:43] why the enemies to also try to attack me
[48:46] just not to to say that you are gonna
[48:48] release that boy I'm not going to attack
[48:50] you here is that the little thing that
[48:52] I'm just letting you know but all I'm
[48:54] trying to say is that you're gonna go
[48:57] through afflictions but don't give up
[48:59] because I said many are afflictions of
[49:01] their righteous but God was what would
[49:05] take would take care of this though
[49:07] don't worry about your afflictions just
[49:09] move on and serve God because he gonna
[49:11] make a way for you Hallelujah
[49:15] praise God Amen
[49:18] Hallelujah
[49:22] and Abraham
[49:25] Noah
[49:27] also found Grace in the eyes of God
[49:31] it's not how handsome no one is or how
[49:35] brilliant to anything by the grace of
[49:38] God
[49:39] came to Noah out of Brilliance in his
[49:42] age is him alone that God save him and
[49:47] his family because of the grace of God
[49:52] Abraham
[49:54] was not even a duty began he was a
[49:57] gentile he was living in a city called
[50:00] children and God and he led to all he
[50:04] had the voice of God
[50:06] through the grace of God
[50:09] and he followed that voice
[50:12] but the thing is
[50:14] when God called Abraham
[50:17] he called him alone to separate him from
[50:20] his his descendants his people
[50:23] but Abraham had a great he carried a a
[50:28] weight on him he went with his father he
[50:33] went with his nephew
[50:34] and God
[50:36] could never fully bless Abraham until
[50:40] his dad died and he separate from Lord
[50:44] so what I'm trying to say is that
[50:47] God is going to is willing to bless us
[50:50] but unless we separate ourselves from
[50:53] every unbelief anything that you know
[50:57] that will hinder you from the presence
[50:59] of God you have to cast it out we're
[51:02] living an Haze that all these gadgets it
[51:06] takes all our time they know the things
[51:09] you like he opened it that gives you
[51:11] this give you this you have to be able
[51:13] to balance it and you have to search
[51:16] anything that is going to
[51:19] um
[51:20] going to hinder your work with God you
[51:23] have to cast it off
[51:25] you got to cut it off
[51:28] no wonder Abraham said that we are not
[51:30] Canadians we are not Americans we are
[51:33] not Africans we are Christians because
[51:35] he knew there is going to be a time
[51:37] people are going to be attached to their
[51:40] culture they are going to be attached by
[51:42] the way they do things so you want us to
[51:44] forget all about that
[51:46] and follow him because he's calling you
[51:49] and you alone
[51:50] God wants you and you alone
[51:54] so you've got to separate yourself from
[51:56] everyone belief anything that is
[51:59] contrary to God's word separate yourself
[52:02] from it
[52:04] and Abraham was called by the grace of
[52:08] God
[52:10] but when he went to that place that God
[52:14] told him to be
[52:15] and open that voice of obey that voice
[52:19] of God God told him to stay there
[52:23] don't move
[52:25] but Abraham tested God's patience
[52:30] by moving to Egypt
[52:33] and when he went what happened
[52:37] he lied
[52:39] and said his wife is his sister
[52:43] and
[52:44] that man that Pharaoh was gonna take
[52:48] Sarah to wife
[52:50] Abraham repented and God's grace took
[52:54] over
[52:55] the grace of God took over why God has
[53:00] promised that his seed will come true
[53:03] Sarah
[53:05] so God has to situate that he protect
[53:09] that seed so that nothing can disturb
[53:13] that seed so is you and me because we
[53:18] are children of God he said that I love
[53:21] you even before you came to know who you
[53:24] are so in the time of our ignorance he
[53:27] went and he lovers even before we
[53:30] recognize who we are so many of us the
[53:33] prophet of God gave an example
[53:36] how he went through that even
[53:39] hold an electric post to die that God
[53:43] not let him die because God was
[53:45] protecting his seat our pastor gave an
[53:48] example that he was following a kite and
[53:50] God protected him at that time so many
[53:53] of us tonight you can go through our
[53:55] lives and realize that it was the grace
[53:58] of God that kept us from so many
[54:01] circumstances someone said wasn't
[54:03] supposed to have been dead long time
[54:05] by the grace of God
[54:08] came in at the right time
[54:10] to prevent any catastrophe from
[54:13] happening to you I can go to my own life
[54:16] at the age of 12 Years
[54:18] I went to watch a soccer game
[54:21] in Africa Ghana
[54:23] and whilst watching the game something
[54:25] came on me told my friend I got to go
[54:27] home
[54:28] and they said Oh I said no I got to go
[54:30] so I began to leave
[54:31] whilst I was living there was a
[54:34] commotion because when
[54:37] church has a soldier in Army went to a
[54:41] church and then he went to make a
[54:44] commercial over there and the church
[54:45] people killed him
[54:47] so in Africa if you touch one soldier
[54:49] you touch all of them so the Army got
[54:52] loose
[54:53] and they came to the stadium where we
[54:57] were watching them the game and began to
[55:00] beat everybody
[55:01] killing the people everything they will
[55:03] do so I have to run at the age of 12
[55:06] from like maybe
[55:08] saying
[55:10] from like are here to like Mississauga
[55:14] and whilst running for my life and right
[55:16] now they couldn't even take a car anyway
[55:19] I saw a van coming and then I I jumped
[55:23] at the back
[55:24] so whilst on the back of the of the
[55:26] truck I don't know how to explain
[55:28] business like um
[55:29] like a steps that goes on the back of
[55:32] those vans it's a big van so I jump on
[55:35] it and whilst on it I fell down the
[55:39] grace of God that came because the next
[55:41] guy could have just ride over me and
[55:44] destroy me but God was protecting me
[55:47] that same God has protected you all the
[55:50] while since you're a child so don't ever
[55:54] give up God that has brought to this
[55:56] will ever take you the end of the road
[55:58] never give up he's the same yesterday
[56:01] today and forever the grace that brought
[56:04] me through that same Grace is going to
[56:07] see us through the grace of God is Not
[56:11] By rest of righteousness that grace
[56:14] Amazing Grace will lead us through amen
[56:19] hallelujah and
[56:22] when you come to the children of Israel
[56:26] God in determining chapter 7 verse 7.
[56:31] God gave them a commandment
[56:34] if you follow me I'll do this I'll do
[56:37] that I'll do that and they never
[56:41] follow God's Commandments it's just like
[56:44] you get married to a wife
[56:46] and that wife
[56:47] promise you she'll do this you do that
[56:51] you wash your clothes you do all those
[56:52] things which is part of them and it's
[56:54] part of it and that man will work hard
[56:57] until his friends to take care of that
[56:59] woman but if the woman begins to be lazy
[57:03] she doesn't listen to you doesn't do
[57:04] anything for you
[57:07] it takes the grace of God
[57:09] keep that marriage
[57:12] and he took the grace of God
[57:15] to keep with the children of Israel
[57:18] because he gave their way they didn't
[57:21] have food he gave their manner they
[57:23] complained later he do everything to
[57:26] them they complain and that complained
[57:29] God so much
[57:30] that it even made Moses angry
[57:35] and made Moses make a wrong decision by
[57:40] his tracking the rock instead of us
[57:42] speaking to it
[57:44] and God could have struck Moses dead but
[57:48] by the grace of God
[57:50] he didn't strike him dead
[57:52] all of us who have been dead by the
[57:55] grace of God grace came in and saved
[57:59] Moses
[58:00] that's why we saw him back in the
[58:03] advanced transgression with Elijah
[58:06] because God took care of him he said you
[58:09] see okay you seek you see it with your
[58:12] eyes by you'll physically go there but
[58:14] all came to be a type
[58:17] because God everything works together
[58:19] for good to them love God
[58:21] says Sovereign God it ended up working
[58:24] for him now you can have the type of God
[58:27] finishing with Moses and Joshua who type
[58:30] the Holy Ghost taking the church to
[58:32] their Promised Land
[58:34] so he stays the grace of God and God is
[58:38] the same yesterday today and forever
[58:41] amen so God take care of business
[58:45] Hallelujah
[58:47] and the next person I'll talk about
[58:50] is David
[58:52] and
[58:54] King David was man after God's Own Heart
[58:59] and
[59:01] urea
[59:02] urea if I pronounce the best husband
[59:06] was a proselyte
[59:09] um when you say a prosely light
[59:12] a Pros like yes sir plus a Prost light
[59:15] and it was hitty tight
[59:17] so they were not fully Jews but who came
[59:19] to convert it to be Judaism because they
[59:22] saw what God has done through David so
[59:25] it is his people you know when David had
[59:28] that desire to drink that water
[59:31] it was Europe people
[59:33] that put their life at rest
[59:36] and fought through the enemy's camp
[59:39] to bring water for David to drink
[59:42] so is you and me we have to take the
[59:45] thought of the work the sword of the
[59:48] word which is the word of God and Cast
[59:51] Away through everyone believe and trust
[59:54] God because perhaps some preached a
[59:56] summary about that as salt don't polish
[59:59] the salt and let it look so shiny and
[1:00:02] everything you got to take the sword and
[1:00:04] cut everyone belief out let that Soul
[1:00:07] put it to work because those people just
[1:00:10] the desire of David they took that sword
[1:00:13] and cut their way through they put their
[1:00:15] life at race for him
[1:00:17] and King David
[1:00:22] made a mistake
[1:00:25] he saw Bathsheba and he did what he was
[1:00:28] not supposed to do
[1:00:30] and had a baby with her
[1:00:34] so he planned
[1:00:35] and let
[1:00:37] um
[1:00:39] the name is one of his captains
[1:00:42] to make sure
[1:00:43] that Uriel go onto the wall and died so
[1:00:48] after he died he was happy and married
[1:00:51] that woman
[1:00:53] but
[1:00:54] one thing
[1:00:55] that David forgot that God
[1:00:58] knows everything that is going on
[1:01:01] and even tonight whatever you thinking
[1:01:04] whatever is going through your heart God
[1:01:06] knows it you can't hide from his
[1:01:08] presence
[1:01:09] nothing can be hidden he said everything
[1:01:13] that will be hidden was going to make
[1:01:14] known
[1:01:15] so you better set your heart make sure
[1:01:17] everything is right
[1:01:19] so
[1:01:20] that God sent Nathan to go and speak to
[1:01:25] David
[1:01:27] but one thing that I could I could catch
[1:01:30] from it was that Nathan could have gone
[1:01:32] and said hey David you took somebody's
[1:01:34] swipe blah blah blah blah
[1:01:36] he didn't go that God gave him wisdom
[1:01:39] so sometimes when God reveals something
[1:01:41] to you about a situation about somebody
[1:01:43] the way to go about it you have to know
[1:01:46] when to go about it and how to go about
[1:01:50] it to speak it to laugh when you correct
[1:01:53] with love and bring results
[1:01:55] because remember is a Grace you could
[1:01:58] have been in that situation by the grace
[1:02:01] of God delivered you from that so God
[1:02:04] gave the the the prophet the wisdom to
[1:02:08] speak because a word spoken in due
[1:02:11] season how correct that is it has to be
[1:02:15] spoken in due season at the right time
[1:02:20] so when
[1:02:22] David was exposed and he told him that
[1:02:25] there's somebody in your kingdom
[1:02:28] that has only one land
[1:02:30] he cherished the lamb he sleep with the
[1:02:33] lamb the lamb is is everything
[1:02:36] and I reached my heart like 99 more
[1:02:39] lands more ships
[1:02:40] but this rich man
[1:02:43] left all the sheep and went and took
[1:02:46] this man's only man
[1:02:51] and
[1:02:52] right away
[1:02:55] David pronounced judgment
[1:02:58] In My Kingdom
[1:03:01] I'll make sure this man
[1:03:04] life I kill him he's dead for doing that
[1:03:08] by grace
[1:03:10] took over
[1:03:12] grace of God came from the prophet
[1:03:15] Nathan he said David you shall not die
[1:03:19] but sword will never leave from your
[1:03:22] heart your home
[1:03:24] in grace that took over it's not grace
[1:03:27] of God
[1:03:29] David have pronounced his own judgment
[1:03:34] by God's grace
[1:03:36] greater than his sin it took over Jacob
[1:03:40] David's judgment and gave him Grace
[1:03:45] so he said Grace that gonna take us
[1:03:47] through so the one thing is
[1:03:49] when
[1:03:51] you receive correction
[1:03:54] how do you react
[1:03:58] that's why God said David is a man after
[1:04:01] my own heart because after
[1:04:06] he went
[1:04:08] through that
[1:04:10] um
[1:04:10] after David
[1:04:12] went through when Dayton spoke that to
[1:04:14] him after that he wrote Psalm 51.
[1:04:19] that's why you wrote something and
[1:04:21] repented
[1:04:22] of his things
[1:04:25] and ask God to give me a clean heart and
[1:04:28] renew the right Spirit within him all
[1:04:30] those songs came after he did that
[1:04:34] so the question is
[1:04:36] how do you react
[1:04:39] when You Face correction
[1:04:43] are you those that get angry
[1:04:46] like King Uzziah
[1:04:48] in that altar
[1:04:50] doing what he was not supposed to do
[1:04:54] and the prophet Isaiah told him now that
[1:04:57] the high priest told him King you can't
[1:05:01] do that
[1:05:02] you are so angry
[1:05:05] that God
[1:05:08] strike him with leprosy
[1:05:11] so what I'm saying tonight
[1:05:14] how do you react
[1:05:17] with correction one brother was telling
[1:05:21] me that him
[1:05:23] was a brother or sister say anything to
[1:05:26] him
[1:05:27] you never argue
[1:05:29] he just leave it
[1:05:32] and accept and thank the person for it
[1:05:34] this is no time to prove who is right
[1:05:38] and who is wrong
[1:05:40] if you are wrong you are wrong
[1:05:42] make things right move on with your life
[1:05:45] no need to try to prove I'm right I'm
[1:05:49] this Mr right there's no such as Mr
[1:05:52] Right
[1:05:54] as a true Christian you don't even have
[1:05:56] rights
[1:05:59] so it's time
[1:06:01] we have to
[1:06:04] accept Corrections
[1:06:06] because it will
[1:06:16] it drives closer to him and Corrections
[1:06:19] will always help us
[1:06:21] I couldn't print anything but I'm just
[1:06:23] gonna read this here
[1:06:25] in a message of Grace paragraph 130.
[1:06:29] it says Sovereign Grace
[1:06:32] is from a sovereign one
[1:06:35] Sovereign Grace from a sovereign one
[1:06:39] sovereign what can he do
[1:06:43] Sovereign can do whatever it wants to do
[1:06:47] listen just now so vereign Grace can
[1:06:52] only be only be given by one that is
[1:06:55] sovereign
[1:06:57] and God is sovereign
[1:06:59] so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore
[1:07:03] being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask
[1:07:06] anybody
[1:07:08] they don't have to if that's what it
[1:07:12] wants to
[1:07:13] isn't that wonderful
[1:07:16] it don't have to ask can I do this or
[1:07:21] shall I do this
[1:07:22] can I massage will I
[1:07:25] doesn't do it it does itself Grace is
[1:07:29] Sovereign therefore you can save the
[1:07:33] violence
[1:07:34] he can save the words
[1:07:37] he can save the impurities
[1:07:40] the dying teeth
[1:07:43] the dying thief on the cross just last
[1:07:46] minute somebody that never thought about
[1:07:48] God in his life
[1:07:51] but when you say remember me
[1:07:54] Grace
[1:07:55] came to him and he has salvation
[1:07:59] nobody can tell God what to do
[1:08:02] is that Sovereign God
[1:08:04] he does what is right
[1:08:06] shall not the just of the earth do right
[1:08:09] he is a Potter we are the clay we only
[1:08:12] have to ask them to share personal
[1:08:14] models after his own will not your will
[1:08:17] but my thy will be done he is higher
[1:08:20] than you said my prayers are higher than
[1:08:23] your ways my thoughts are higher than
[1:08:26] your thoughts whatever God does is right
[1:08:30] we have to love him regardless
[1:08:33] when you say yes or no to our prayer we
[1:08:36] still have to thank him because he knows
[1:08:38] the best he knows why you are in that
[1:08:41] situation he knows why those things are
[1:08:44] happening our God is awesome God
[1:08:48] whatever God does is perfect
[1:08:51] so no
[1:08:53] body has a right
[1:08:56] he said that Isaac and Esau and Jacob
[1:09:00] before they were even born he said I
[1:09:04] love Jacob I hate Islam who are you to
[1:09:07] tell what God has to do
[1:09:09] he is God
[1:09:11] he knows better
[1:09:13] so we all have to do is just humble
[1:09:17] ourselves
[1:09:18] and let him have his way in our way and
[1:09:22] things will be what better for us
[1:09:24] because one thing is if we are truly a
[1:09:28] child of God or a son of God
[1:09:32] listen whatever God has promised to come
[1:09:36] through your life you cannot stop it
[1:09:38] even your unbelief cannot stop it
[1:09:42] the king that no the John the Baptist
[1:09:45] that
[1:09:46] Zechariah this is a career to all
[1:09:48] whatever
[1:09:50] he doubted the Angel's way
[1:09:55] he had the example even the high priest
[1:09:58] he doubted it but still it didn't
[1:10:01] prevent God
[1:10:02] from letting John the Baptist come
[1:10:05] through him he suffered for a while
[1:10:08] by being disobedient
[1:10:10] but that promise came through himself
[1:10:14] by Mary
[1:10:16] an 18 year old girl
[1:10:18] she said be unto me according to you Thy
[1:10:21] Word
[1:10:22] and it happened so we have the Mary's
[1:10:26] belief
[1:10:27] and before Mary could even say that the
[1:10:32] importance of reading your Bible and
[1:10:35] praying every day
[1:10:37] is very very important that's the best
[1:10:42] thing you need to read your Bible you
[1:10:44] need to pray you're listening you need
[1:10:46] to listen to the tips
[1:10:48] when you do those things forms like a
[1:10:51] fire around you because then my word is
[1:10:53] fire it's consuming fire the pillar of
[1:10:56] fire God's word is truth he said it
[1:10:59] takes everything it protests does
[1:11:02] everything for you
[1:11:04] Mary Brown said that before
[1:11:07] he met that she met that angel that
[1:11:10] angel met her him her and Joseph was
[1:11:14] talking about Isaiah 96
[1:11:18] so she was thinking on those words
[1:11:21] the angel appeared unto him on the way
[1:11:24] to emails those
[1:11:27] disciples were thinking on the word of
[1:11:31] God the Bible as a man thinketh in his
[1:11:35] heart so is he
[1:11:37] you become what you eat
[1:11:40] that's why you have to watch what we're
[1:11:42] listening
[1:11:43] because there are so many distractions
[1:11:45] now there are so many things that you
[1:11:48] can feed your soul that do not help you
[1:11:50] so you have to be able to and what do
[1:11:53] you call it you have to be able to have
[1:11:55] that discernment and see to what will
[1:11:58] help you and what would I help you those
[1:12:00] that will not help you got to cut it off
[1:12:03] because if you don't cut it off you're a
[1:12:06] Son of God a daughter of God but you
[1:12:09] don't have the joy of your salvation
[1:12:11] that's why there is a result unto me the
[1:12:14] joy of thy salvation you and I'll be
[1:12:17] always happy and enjoying God's
[1:12:19] blessings you have to set your heart and
[1:12:22] cut things that will distract you from
[1:12:25] the presence of God
[1:12:27] there are so many of them here
[1:12:29] but you have to press your way through
[1:12:33] you have to fight if you might reign
[1:12:36] it's a battle it's not that easy but God
[1:12:40] promised he will lead us through
[1:12:44] and he said that even if your heart
[1:12:46] condemns you God is greater than your
[1:12:49] heart
[1:12:51] looked out upon yourself
[1:12:54] let God have his own way through you and
[1:12:58] all things
[1:13:00] possible to Doom to them that love God
[1:13:04] Amen to those that believe
[1:13:07] if thou can't believe all things
[1:13:11] so let's cast out anything like Christ
[1:13:14] and serving because he will never leave
[1:13:18] us nor forsake us
[1:13:22] listen there has to be a balance because
[1:13:25] some people have taken Grace and making
[1:13:27] disgrace
[1:13:28] is that right we don't want that
[1:13:31] he said if you love me you obey my
[1:13:33] Commandments
[1:13:35] the love of God will let you obey those
[1:13:37] after you have become a Christian and
[1:13:40] God is in your heart then you do those
[1:13:42] things that works to appreciate what God
[1:13:44] has done for you because you are not
[1:13:47] doing that to us say that you are doing
[1:13:49] that to buy your way to heaven you can't
[1:13:51] buy Grace
[1:13:53] you can't buy those things from God God
[1:13:55] give to those he wished
[1:13:58] you cannot buy Grace from God you cannot
[1:14:01] tell God what to do
[1:14:03] but all that you can do is do your part
[1:14:06] and love God
[1:14:08] as Brian Brown said that even if he sent
[1:14:11] me to Hell he's still right
[1:14:13] but he said also that he knew the love
[1:14:18] he has for God and how God will have him
[1:14:20] he know there's no way he's going to
[1:14:22] send him to her but even if he chose to
[1:14:25] he's still right
[1:14:27] so let's just love God
[1:14:30] respect the elders respect our pastor
[1:14:34] whatever after a pastor retire whoever
[1:14:37] gonna take position let us support and
[1:14:40] respect the man regardless of what you
[1:14:42] have seen him in the past forget about
[1:14:44] all those things your eyes could see and
[1:14:47] just support the man with your prayers
[1:14:50] and with your heart and God will bless
[1:14:52] you too
[1:14:53] amen it's time to respect as you will
[1:14:56] respect God's Anointed God also bless
[1:14:59] you no one that David said that I I
[1:15:02] cannot touch God's anointed do my
[1:15:05] preface no harm and touch not my
[1:15:07] anointing my anointed was
[1:15:10] you all have gone through I remember one
[1:15:12] time
[1:15:13] I was working in a place
[1:15:16] the first time I did a job for standby
[1:15:18] it was the house was like 24 000 square
[1:15:20] feet in Bayview over there
[1:15:22] and
[1:15:24] the Builder that gave me the job took
[1:15:26] five percent from me
[1:15:29] and the taper was giving those helping
[1:15:32] me a lot of help didn't want them to
[1:15:35] work messing up everything
[1:15:37] and I was talking to him something said
[1:15:40] that nowhere come from against you will
[1:15:42] prosper that standing spoke in my heart
[1:15:45] then
[1:15:47] The Nest I heard the man fired the taper
[1:15:51] the guy that took me over there
[1:15:53] that took the money from me
[1:15:56] that my fire he lost like 150 000 at
[1:15:59] that time and I
[1:16:01] that he was tormented
[1:16:04] um
[1:16:05] giving trouble to my guys I have to go
[1:16:08] back and fix his mistakes for him
[1:16:11] so people has to watch
[1:16:14] what you say even your closet and what
[1:16:18] you think
[1:16:19] about God's anointed
[1:16:23] because
[1:16:24] you will receive your reward
[1:16:29] he said if you accept the prayer for you
[1:16:33] respect the prophet you get the prophet
[1:16:35] reward you respect him you get the
[1:16:38] reward too so it's very important that
[1:16:42] we watch what we thinking and what we
[1:16:45] are saying
[1:16:48] so
[1:16:49] um
[1:16:50] I'm just gonna end it over here
[1:16:53] and just say that the grace of God
[1:16:57] that has brought us through that same
[1:17:01] Grace will lead us home but Antonio
