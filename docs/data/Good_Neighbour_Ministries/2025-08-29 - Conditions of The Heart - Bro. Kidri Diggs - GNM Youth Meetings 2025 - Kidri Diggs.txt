The word of God is becoming so magnified in this hour that uh we we just we we can sense the change is going to be right around the corner. It's it's upon us, saints. Amen. Praise God. Welcome. Welcome every single one of you to the Good Neighbor Ministries uh fall um young people's uh meetings. It is uh absolutely a privilege and an honor to um once again assemble under this atmosphere where God can move and do great things for our young people. You know, it's not Listen, we're all we're all 21. Believe it or not, if you're a son or a daughter of God, you're all young people. Amen. But the difference is you're looking at me and you can see quite clearly I'm not 21. And I can tell you I don't feel the strength that I had when I was 21. But I can tell you another thing that I remember when the Lord first called me out. I was 33 years old and I had a lot of strength and I was like a house on fire. And God has a purpose in calling young people because he wants to use your strength. He wants to use the passion that you have for the things of this world. He wants to turn it around and he wants to use it for his glory so that you can make an imprint in this generation as young people serving the Lord. Amen. Praise God. You can see here what it says. It says, "Preserving the truth in our youth." And I'll just continue and finish the sentence. preserving the truth in our youth so that his purpose can be in use in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Forever more. God has a purpose for each and every son and daughter of God so that their light can shine in the generation that they are called in. You're not here by accident. You're not even here this weekend by accident. You're here because the Holy Spirit led you here. You might think, "Oh, you know, I was invited and I thought, you know, that I should go." You still had to say yes. You still had to say, "Amen. I'm going." And I believe because you've made that decision. If you just pay attention and yield yourself to the spirit, God is going to do something special for you. Put up the scripture. Our theme this year is God is preserving his word, his truth in the young people. Amen. And in Psalms 121:8, it says, "The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forever more." &gt;&gt; I know you've been to many youth camps. A lot of you young people, I know you have. and you've gone back out and you've come back in. But he says, "I'm going to preserve you. Even when you're out there, I'm going to bring you back in." &gt;&gt; Amen. So you you can't get away from what God wants to do in your life this weekend. Amen. He's got a plan for you. Praise God. And he's got he's got a fire brandon minister that's going to speak the word of God and is going to meet every need here tonight. I believe it with all of my heart. Amen. Praise God. I want to welcome all of the um visiting uh uh message believing sister churches here this evening. Um I I certainly appreciate uh brother Dale Lang staff. Amen. From Harvest Bride Tabernacle all the way from Wyoming. God bless you, brother. And your your precious wife Lannne. God bless you. Amen. I want to welcome our precious brother Robert Lee. Amen. This is brother Maxwell Lee's brother. I didn't know he had a brother here. Let me tell you, he he he's a wonderful man of God. Amen. I so appreciate him. I met him for the first time this year and he was so good to us. Amen. He he he uh uh you know, he he took my ring and brother Simon's ring and he cleaned it for us and says, "Brother, that ring's a little bit tight. He he even enlarged it for me." All right. There. Amen. Just, you know, just praise God. That's the heart of a son of God. Amen. Praise God. God bless you and your and your wife. God bless you, sister, and your children.

And so, we appreciate the support and I believe that you will be blessed, every single one of you. Amen. Praise God. And so, we're going to get to the main event, which is the word of God. Amen. And I believe if if you've been worshiping here tonight and you've been praying this week in in expectation, and I can tell you there's been a lot of prayer going into these meetings. Amen. So, you're going to see the supernatural regardless. You're going to see God move in a special way. And don't be looking for signs and wonders. That's not what that's not what turns on the sons and daughters of God. It's when God unveils himself and one repents, &gt;&gt; it's worth a thousand worlds. Amen. And that's what we're under expectation to see God moving in the individual lives of our young people. Amen. Praise God. And so at this time, I would like to introduce all the way from Colombia, South Carolina. Everybody knows him. He's got a worldwide ministry. Amen. Brother Kyrie Digs all the way from Columbia, South Carolina. And he's just warming up in there. That's all. He's just warming up. He's pacing the floor because he's got something that he wants to release here tonight. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I believe I believe his pastor Charles Anderson. Let's all stand.

Let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise. If God's been good to you, why don't you give him some praise tonight? I can't speak for everybody, but I know he's been good to me. I know he's been good to Pastor Mazelli. We've been riding together, so I know God's been good to him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just thank and praise the Lord for his goodness. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to be on this side of the world again. Amen. Not too cold, not too hot, just right. Amen. That's our God. &gt;&gt; Everything is just right. &gt;&gt; You know what? It's just right for God to move tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many expecting God to answer your prayer? &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, we certainly thank God for Pastor Danny. Amen. We certainly appreciate him. Brother Simon, wherever he may be. Amen. He's been such an inspiration to all of us. Amen. Thank God for all of your pastors. Believe that they are mighty men of valor. Amen. We certainly appreciate all of you. But we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we come. It's good to see all the faces that we know. Amen. And thank God for all of you and your travels. Let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God tonight. If you have a need, you can acknowledge it to the Lord by uplifted hand. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, we lift our hands to you as an act of faith. Lord, knowing that you see the need, Lord, or the desire before we can even ask. But Lord, in our asking, Lord, let us not ask anything that's not of your perfect will, Lord. Lord, for we want your perfect will, Lord. We don't want something that we'll have for a period of time and then it's gone because it's permissible. But Lord, we want the your perfect will. Something that'll stay with us for eternity. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray you bless your people, Lord. And Lord God, and bless the need in their life, Father, and Father, their families and different things, Lord. And we just pray that your Holy Spirit would come and dominate the service, Lord, Lord. That it won't be the acts of men or the thoughts of men, Lord, but it'll be the Holy Spirit moving. It'll be the Holy Spirit taking over, &gt;&gt; Lord. And that's what we want tonight. We want a Holy Spirit takeover tonight, &gt;&gt; Lord. We pray that you would let the inspiration that you've given, Lord, let it become plain, Lord. Lord, not in the intellectual realm, but a realm that can be seen by faith, Lord. Lord, we pray your blessings, Lord. Lord, we all want to practice the greatest gift given unto man. And that's moving out of the way that the Holy Spirit may have prayer minutes in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ, Lord. And what would a prayer be, Lord, if we didn't ask, Lord, for forgiveness, Lord? Lord, the different failures in our lives, Lord, the the sins or mishaps or whatever you want to call it. Lord, we plead your blood right now. Lord, we plead your blood over our habits, Lord. We plead the blood, Lord, over the different things, Lord, that are stenching your nostrils right now. Lord, atone over us right now, Lord. And let nothing about us keep you from touching us, Lord. We put it under the blood right now in the name of Jesus Christ. We pray and we thank you. Let the church say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's turn to Ezekiel chapter 36. Ezekiel 36. Praise the Lord. Amen. Glory to God. Ezekiel 36 and um let's start reading that verse. Uh I think I want 26. Yeah, let's start reading at verse 26. The Bible says Ezekiel 36 and 26. The Bible says, "And I will make them and yeah, and I will make them and the places round about my heel a blessing, and I will cause the No, that I ain't in the right verse. Hold on." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. 36. I was in 34. Man's technology 26. If you have it, say amen. All right. The Bible says, let's just let's just back up a little bit. Let's go to 24. For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness. Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; And from all your out idols. Somebody say, "Amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; Will I cleanse you? A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a new heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes. And ye shall keep my judgments and do them, and you shall dwell in the land that I give to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. Amen. May the Lord have a bless his word. You can have your seats. Amen. Praise the Lord. You know, I I like that verse of scriptures, you know, because it's something that God is saying he will do for us. &gt;&gt; It's not something that uh the preacher can do. It's not something that mom and daddy can do. It's not something that a good job can do, a a a good relationship can do. But God is the only one that can do what we just read. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I like how he said, "A new heart also will I give you." Hallelujah. So what God is saying, the the way we are born is not good enough. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The way you were born, the way I was born is not good enough. Hallelujah. So tonight, by the grace of God, my my subject is conditions of the heart. Hallelujah. Conditions of the heart. Amen. And you know when we when we think of the heart most of the time we we think of love. Talk to me church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you think of the heart you think of you think of love and you and and you and you think of happy things. Amen. The heart is not supposed to be broken. &gt;&gt; The heart is is is joy is supposed to flow from your heart. &gt;&gt; But you know church when we were born we were born in sin. So our lives were being molded to live in this world. But then God came and God said, "I'm gonna give you a new heart." &gt;&gt; Why is he going to give us a new heart? Because in the condition we were born in, we didn't have a heart to desire God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the conditions of our heart ran after the things of the world. &gt;&gt; So God said, "I'm going to change your heart." And unless God change your heart, you can't even live by his spirit. &gt;&gt; But you know, church, when I when I when I look at, you know, the conditions of the heart, if you don't mind, let me start off with reading something our prophet said. Hallelujah. He said, "Man works by his head and looks by his eyes. See the devil, hallelujah, said to the woman, "Oh, the tree is pleasant." She said it, she said, "It is good to look at." See that same devil, if he can get you to stop just for a minute, if the enemy can get you to stop just for a minute, he'll start to mess with your mind. &gt;&gt; But the devil don't know what's in your heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your mind, your thoughts, all of that can be challenged and perverted. &gt;&gt; But the enemy doesn't know what's in nobody's heart. &gt;&gt; The only way, hallelujah, he can get close to you is by your actions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, if we before I finish reading this, there are many people in the Bible who had filthy lives, but in their heart they desired a change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The woman at the well, a change. Rahab, a change. &gt;&gt; Even when Jacob was tricking and shugging and diving everybody, he wanted a change. &gt;&gt; See, the devil don't know what's in your heart. There are conditions of the heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight to open your heart to God, &gt;&gt; not your mind. I might say some things that you'll be like, h my, I never thought about it like that. That's intellectualism. What we need to do tonight, whatever you hear and it's challenging to you or you were like, "Man, that's good." Open up your spirit to receive it. &gt;&gt; Open up your heart to say, "God, come and sit on my throne." &gt;&gt; God's throne is your heart. And the question tonight is, does God have a seat on your heart &gt;&gt; or is something else there &gt;&gt; in his place? Oh, we got plenty of scriptures, plenty of things to back up this thought. &gt;&gt; But look, I want you to get this verse. as I'm preaching, don't follow me with your mind &gt;&gt; cuz the enemy can pervert those thoughts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ask yourself, does God really have permanence in my heart? And let me say it like this. Even if the mind, your mind don't belong to the devil, it's just a battleground. That's the place God allowed him to make war. &gt;&gt; But your mind doesn't belong to the devil. Why? Because your mind is a battleground. &gt;&gt; That mean God is also fighting for your mind. &gt;&gt; And you think about it. Hallelujah. If God can get your mind and your heart, you will be unstoppable. [Applause] But let's deal with the conditions of the heart. Listen. Listen. I ain't going to be long. Y'all know I'm about to close. Hallelujah. Some of y'all need that already. Just got here and you're drifting. Just got here and you're a little tired. just got here and things are running through your mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you need a little help, you're drifting a little bit just to pay attention, let me help you out. I got some words that got power. &gt;&gt; I'm about to close, brother. I've seen those words. Hallelujah. Catch the attention of the people. &gt;&gt; I've seen people in church sleeping, getting boxed up by the devil. You say, "I'm about to go." Amen, brother. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, if you need a little help just early in the service, I'm about to close. Hallelujah. But listen, church. Listen what he says. She said, "It's good to look at. See, that same devil, if he can get you to stop just for a minute, just for a minute, he can make you reason it out. He can make you think with your mind, but God doesn't use a man's hand. &gt;&gt; God uses his heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only way God can use any of us is if your heart has been given to him. What good is a relationship if you don't have that person's heart? &gt;&gt; Think about it, brothers. If you ain't got your wife's heart, you make her mad, she might put some extra spices in your food. Oh Lord. And if you put your hands on her, she might Let me leave it alone. Let me leave it. Hey sisters, if that if that man don't Hallelujah. If he he if if you don't have his heart, he get tired of working. He'll sit home and play the game. Uh oh. But if he got your heart, when it's snowing and raining out here in Ontario, Victoria, it's it's it's pouring down. Hallelujah. You know what he say? Because he's giving his heart to his family. He said, "Man, I got to go to work. Got to catch this bus. Got to do whatever. Hey, I got to provide for my family." Why? You have his heart. Hallelujah. And if somebody Hallelujah has given their heart to something, that's where their treasure is. &gt;&gt; Young sisters, hallelujah. If that man has not given you his heart, you are not his treasure. &gt;&gt; Vice versa, brothers, &gt;&gt; you got a nice car. She in love with your car. Got some rims on that thing. A nice candy paint job. If you ain't converted, got a nice boom boom in it. And you pick up. She want everybody to see it. She turn turn that up a little louder in the car riding, but you behind on your bill. Repo man come and snatch a heart. dealership come and snatch that car back. Her heart is gone. &gt;&gt; She's no longer in love with you because her heart is gone. Oh my. I've been there before where my car was my heart and God let it get stolen. stolen, stripped, windows bust out, everything. And when I saw it, my heart was broken. Rims gone, music gone, everything gone. When I saw it in that condition, I didn't want it anymore cuz they couldn't bring me that status anymore. But what God was doing, he was putting my heart in the right place. Sometimes God will take things out your life because that's where your heart is. You might lose your job cuz you was making good money. God wants to be your heart. &gt;&gt; You might be in a relationship. You love that person more than you love God. God would allow that person to act a fool &gt;&gt; just to get your heart back. &gt;&gt; That's how much he loves you. &gt;&gt; Church, this journey is heart for heart. Hallelujah. God works on his heart while the devil works on his head. God chooses the heart. The Bible said, "As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he." &gt;&gt; If I can real quick, just with that verse, examine yourself &gt;&gt; cuz some of you might not even want to be here. You know why? Because your heart is in another place. Your heart might be on Love Island. &gt;&gt; Oh boy, we hitting some stuff tonight. Y'all got the blood hound loose early. Like brother Danny said, all the youth meetings we didn't had in this place and around Ontario and we still fighting these same battles. &gt;&gt; Battles of relationship. Yeah, I know you go through these things. Hallelujah. I know we just we we had good youth meetings where where where the men of God have broken these things down. But one thing I want to bring I want to add to that. Yeah, it's natural to go through these things. But I want you to understand everything you go through, there's a spirit behind it. &gt;&gt; You start getting emotions and feelings in your body, there's a spirit behind it. You start thinking things in your mind, hallelujah, about the opposite sex. There's a spirit behind it. &gt;&gt; And only your heart can put it in the right compartment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just forgive me. I'm just a blood hound. I believe in grace. &gt;&gt; I believe in grace. The grace of God. &gt;&gt; And I believe that when God brings a word, he want us to hallelujah examine ourself and do what's right. Don't look for excuses to keep the things that you in love with. &gt;&gt; Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; And let me say this. When the word of God comes like this, it is not a rebuke. &gt;&gt; It's God's love on display. &gt;&gt; Cuz the Bible says, "Whom God love it, he rebuke and what? &gt;&gt; Chasen." &gt;&gt; Think about it. Tonight, God is behind somebody chasing them. &gt;&gt; You say, "Bro Digs, you beating on me." No, God is chasing Moique. God is chasing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing is, will you give him your heart? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If God gets your heart, that'll take care of your mind. &gt;&gt; That'll take care of your actions. That'll take care of your strength. Hallelujah. Cuz in your weakest days, if you've given God your heart, something will come from way down. Hallelujah. Just to fight another day. Hallelujah. But look, church, he said, "As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he." Now, if I can listen, I'mma give you some statistics. And I I by God's grace, I don't want to be long, but I'm going to give you some statistics. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men that's been done in a study in your natural body. Hallelujah. One of the first things to collapse is your heart. And your heart is the compartment where all the blood flows to. Hallelujah. And I'll show you how important the heart is. Hallelujah. You can live brain dead. You know that &gt;&gt; they can keep you on a machine. &gt;&gt; You just be out of your mind. &gt;&gt; People come in there trying to talk to you. You like &gt;&gt; brain dead, but your heart still pumping. There's too many people in church, hallelujah, in that condition. &gt;&gt; They hearing the word of God, but they won't, Hallelujah, Sister Lane staff, they will not interact with it. They're brain dead, &gt;&gt; and the heart is pumping. The blood is running warm through your veins, but you won't accept what you heard. Oh my. You hooked up to a machine. That's the worst place to be. Because once the machine dies, so will you. &gt;&gt; And in some of our cases, hallelujah, the machine might be a good church. &gt;&gt; As long as you go into, hallelujah, that church, everything is good, &gt;&gt; but let your church shut down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let your church go through something. &gt;&gt; Then it will show what's really in your heart. Oh, good family. My mom and daddy, you know, they blessed and highly favored. Everybody love my mom and daddy. But let mom and daddy start going through something. Then can you serve God? &gt;&gt; I know it's getting tight on some of y'all, so I knew I had to bring some help. Y'all ain't going to sit here and stare at me tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Word of God coming. &gt;&gt; Oh, we going we going to bless God tonight. &gt;&gt; The word of God is true. I said the word of God is true. The word of God is true. I love the word of God. I love the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want to be blessed? Amen the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen means so be it. &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. Some of you come to church and you don't even amen the word. You know why? Because it's not in your heart. &gt;&gt; It's intellectual. &gt;&gt; I'm in church. I'm I'm here with mom and daddy. But are you experiencing God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you hear that word, can you relate? &gt;&gt; See, you you hear them sisters saying, "Amen." &gt;&gt; They can relate. &gt;&gt; When you can relate, hallelujah, you respond. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God has your heart, the number one killer among men is heart disease. The heart, hallelujah, starts to get infected. What happens? The flow of the blood is not flowing as freely as it ought to. &gt;&gt; It's in the body, but it's a struggle to get to those compartments. &gt;&gt; And as it struggles to get through those compartments, the heart works harder. &gt;&gt; Do you not know your heart is not supposed to be working hard? Hallelujah. And if I can say it like this, when you fall in love with God, hallelujah, it's not something hard. &gt;&gt; Because God is the one doing all the work. &gt;&gt; God becomes the healer when you're sick. God becomes a deliverer when you're bound. God becomes the provider when you're lacking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So your heart beats a little bit more smoothly because you're depending on the one you're in love with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But what happens is the blood doesn't flow as freely as it ought to. So the heart starts working extra hard, extra hard. And what that does, that puts the whole body under pressure. And if the heart stops receiving, hallelujah, the amount of blood it's supposed to, now doctors don't tell you this. I'm I'm I'mma tell you something. Even if a vow is set off, the blood in your body, your body is made such a way by the infinite God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that that blood can't get there, it'll try to find another route. &gt;&gt; So if you won't give your God, you won't give God your heart tonight, he will find another route. &gt;&gt; And he got to take something precious out of your life, he will find another route. But he will, hallelujah, without measure get to your heart. But be and I ain't got nothing against doctors. I appreciate doctors. But the first thing they do when they see a clock, they think about that. Let's operate. Let's put a pacemaker in there. Let's put something in there to alter your life. And what we do, we look for things to alter the heartbeat &gt;&gt; instead of it flowing naturally. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have things in our life that we put in place of God earlier. Things that reflect him, but it's not the whole God. We'll come to church. We'll get on the choir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, oh my soul. I won't be quiet. My God is alive. How can I keep it inside? &gt;&gt; Yeah, you do that in church. But when you not in church, &gt;&gt; how can you be quiet then? &gt;&gt; If your God is alive, he's alive wherever you are. &gt;&gt; He's not just alive when you in church. Church is your substitute. But what about at your job? What about at your school? What about at your house? &gt;&gt; Can you be quiet then? If God doesn't have your heart, you most certainly will be. &gt;&gt; But a person who's given God their heart, Hallelujah. Amen. There are certain conditions. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's look church. Listen. Some things that causes heart disease. Everybody. All right. &gt;&gt; Heart disease. One of the first killers of heart disease is lifestyle. &gt;&gt; A person's lifestyle is the first thing, hallelujah, that affects their heart. &gt;&gt; They may be partying. They may be going places they ain't supposed to go. They having a they having a good time. Go to the club, but they be in church on Sunday. [Applause] You know what? I notice a young people's meeting, but I see all you adults. You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it's lifestyle. Doing things that are bad for your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. maybe uh uh smoking or eating habits. See, I'm at a age now where I watch what I eat because the body is not regenerating as fast as it used to be. I used to could eat a whole pizza and go to bed. &gt;&gt; Can't do that now. eat that piece if I want to be sitting up looking at the ceiling &gt;&gt; cuz the body doesn't digest it as fast as it used to when I was younger. Hallelujah. My heart needs a rest. &gt;&gt; And then you have this thing you didn't ate. Some of us, we know we shouldn't be eating because of the lifestyle, but we eat it because we like it. And some of us know we shouldn't be doing what we do, but we do it because we like it. &gt;&gt; Brings me to the story. Remember the prophet was on the pull pit and the maniac came and the maniac, Hallelujah, I'mma break every bone in your body. Hallelujah. The prophet just stood there and then God came down. He said, "Since you challenged the spirit of the Lord, you going to fall over my feet." Man fell down. Police, everybody looking crazy like, "What's happening? What's happening? Is he dead?" Prophet said, "No, he ain't dead." He said, "What you want? What you want to do? What can we save him? Can we say no?" He worshiped that spirit. &gt;&gt; It's in Can you imagine a man in love with going around the world fighting preachers? &gt;&gt; There are still people on the earth like that. Hallelujah. They get they get joy out of coming to church and being a distraction. &gt;&gt; Sitting right up under the pastor's ministry and won't get your life right. &gt;&gt; Come in there every week. &gt;&gt; Every week. Even ask the pastor for counseling. Get the counseling and still won't do it. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz you love that thing. You love that thing. &gt;&gt; When a drug addict get those drugs in their body &gt;&gt; and it takes over, they'll steal from their mama. You know why? Cuz they love that name. I can't help myself. Mama, I love you, but it's something else I love more. Making them lose their mind. You know what it is? Hallelujah. It's something on the inside that's taking over. &gt;&gt; My. Somebody say my &gt;&gt; listen. As I'm going through this, I want you to examine your heart. &gt;&gt; Like I say, I'm not going to be long. Hallelujah. I'm not here to make you do anything. I'm here to make you aware. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My job, Hallelujah, tonight is just to make you aware. &gt;&gt; I'm a gift, Hallelujah, for you just to make you aware. And my subject tonight is make you aware of the conditions of your heart. &gt;&gt; While you sitting in church, uhoh, think about this. Think about this. We are in a place that was ordained of God. &gt;&gt; This building was supernaturally put here by God. &gt;&gt; And think about it. You are in a place that God divinely ordered before the foundation of the world and you're not even saved, &gt;&gt; not even filled with the Holy Ghost. What does that mean? your lifestyle. Something else has your heart. Hallelujah. Think about that. God, think about that. Something else has your heart. You're sitting in a place where God comes regularly and you have no desire to interact with him. conditions of the heart. You can go out and remember what I said, but we want more than memory. &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants action. &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. Listen now. What did I just talk about? lifestyle. &gt;&gt; Let's make this real clear. This is not an insurance seminar. &gt;&gt; I don't have some special rates. I'mma give you pass out some pens or some booklets. &gt;&gt; No, what I'm trying to give you tonight is eternal life, &gt;&gt; an experience with God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The devil ain't going to want to hear that. But hallelujah, a prophet came and told us who we are. I got the power to impart eternal life tonight. &gt;&gt; If you follow along with me, if you get on board with me, I got the power tonight to put eternal life right in front of you. &gt;&gt; But it's up to you to accept it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know I got it. I know I can give it out. But will you receive it? That what the scripture says. Hallelujah. The scripture says to whomsoever you impart will be imparted. Whomsoever you remit will be remitted. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think about that. I'm right here preaching to you trying to remit your sins, &gt;&gt; but it's up to you. Like I said, I got I got three kids and when they were younger, they had worldly tendencies. You know, even though they were in church, they had worldly tendencies. Even though they they they father was a preacher, they had worldly tendencies. You know what had to happen? They had to get converted. &gt;&gt; Didn't matter who they was. You know, when I crossed the border into Canada, I had to go through the scanner. Hallelujah. I couldn't stand to the side and say, "Let my kids through." They say, "No, they got to be scanned, too." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I want you to understand, hallelujah. No matter where your house, no matter where your church, no matter who your family is, you got to be scanned. &gt;&gt; You got to have the goods to cross over to the other side. You can't go off somebody's reputation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you know what? As parents, we have thoughts. I know with me, I say, "Boy, I sure wish I could give the Holy Ghost. I sure wish I could just pour it in them." Every day they'd come home, brother Danny, I'd have me a gallon of Holy Ghost. Come on. Come on. Let's get this. Come on. Let's get this Holy Come on. Drink. Be like a sorority. Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. Dr. Dr. Drink. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They be so drunk to they staggering. &gt;&gt; Where was you? Where was you? I just got more Holy Ghost. Parents, don't we wish we could do that? &gt;&gt; I'd line them up one by one. Hallelujah. And every day they go, every day they come home, I have a fresh gallon. They be like, "Daddy, man, we got the Holy Ghost yesterday." I say, "You going to get a rebirth. &gt;&gt; You going to get a double portion. Get on over here and drink before you get a whipping." Hallelujah. We wish we could do it as parents, but all we can do is live it and put it in front of you. It's up to you to fall in love with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me say it like this. Parents, your kids know if God don't have your heart. &gt;&gt; Some of your hearts housewife sit home, her heart belong to the young and the restless. She'll be the young and the old cuz that what happening to them. Oh, as the world dies, they say as the world turns, as the world dies, that's what's happening. You watch the same old stuff over and over and over again. But now we've given our heart to Netflix. I ain't going to the movies. I'm just got my popcorn at home. Amen. Let me leave you alone. Let me Let me leave you alone. Let me leave it alone. Amen. It's your house. Hallelujah. But listen, first thing we talked about was what? Okay, about five of you. Amen. Praise the Lord. The rest of you going you you think you're going to give me mannequin worship tonight. No, I say I'm I'm I'm kind of strange. When nobody ain't looking, I go up and slap the mannequin. Stop looking at me like that. Don't feel like that mannequin be following you through the store. You just you just doing your thing. Every time you turn around, he's looking at you. That's how people do you in church. When you walking away, they looking at you. When you turn around, they looking down at the floor. I don't bite. I bless. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We ain't come to bite tonight. We come to bless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. Let me move forward. Amen. Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; Listen. First thing is lifestyle. Amen. And healthy factors including like smoking and drinking and all these things. It says one other thing that that that that messes with your heart causes heart disease. A thing called blood pressure. There some of you in here taking blood pressure pills. Let me tell you them pills ain't working. &gt;&gt; I'm going to drop a bomb on you tonight. You taking them pills and it's making your pressure down. That's your faith doing that. &gt;&gt; You believe in them pills. &gt;&gt; So they working for you. &gt;&gt; It's your faith using those pills. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus Christ. [Applause] What? You thought it was the pill? No, it's your faith doing it. &gt;&gt; If you taking it because you believe in it. &gt;&gt; I didn't told the devil secret. &gt;&gt; You thought it was the pills working. No, it's your faith. &gt;&gt; Ain't no power to heal in no pills. &gt;&gt; All it can do is, hallelujah, is sedate. So if you take it and believe in it, it's your faith causing those pills to work. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know that's a challenge to you. Amen. Because he said you look for a quote now. Brother Adam said God used doctors. Yeah. But he said Moses was in the wilderness for 40 years without a doctor. &gt;&gt; It's up to you which one you going to choose. Which one you going to give your heart to? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't against wherever your faith is, that's what you do. H. But as for me, I'm looking for the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blood pressure. One of the things that affects the conditions of the heart is something called pressure. Hallelujah. And you know, I asked the question many times. I go talk to young people. I ask them, hallelujah, brother Miguel. I ask them, "Who's under more pressure? The girls or the guys?" And immediately the girls like, "We are. We are. We are under more pressure. Them boys, them boys ain't going through that. We under pressure. Everywhere we go, how we dress, how we look, what we say, we under more pressure. Maybe looking at the brothers like, "I wish you would open your mouth." You know, y'all ain't under no pressure. We under all the pressure. The way we dress, the way we look. We can't even We can't even rock in church without somebody saying, "Why you moving that fast? Come on, sisters. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm with you tonight. Hallelujah. But then the brothers will say, "No, we're under more pressure. We got to provide. We got to have a good job. We got to watch what we look at. We can't wear shorts. We can't wear tank tops. We under more pressure." Pressure. Some of you are doing what you're doing because you're under pressure. And your peers are the ones that's putting you under pressure. &gt;&gt; Well, let me say it like this. If you believe in God and they don't believe in God, that's not your peer. &gt;&gt; A peer is somebody that's equal to you. &gt;&gt; A peer is somebody that believe what you believe. If they don't believe what you believe, that's not your peer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you need to stop being around that person because you are not equally yoked. Hallelujah. And we let people who are not even on the same level spiritually put us under pressure. &gt;&gt; You go to school, girl, you got your long jean skirt on. You ought to walk up in there like you a supermodel. &gt;&gt; I can't even do the stupid walk. Look like they be stomping on something. You ought to walk up in there proud &gt;&gt; because what you're doing, you're representing the glory of God. &gt;&gt; You in your dress of holiness, you're representing God's heart. Because God is a holy God. You are not to let somebody put you under pressure because you look like God. And for those of you who leave out the house and got other stuff in that book bag, &gt;&gt; don't make me go get the amen sign. You got something. I didn't seen it personally. Hallelujah. Go get Go get the book bag. Hallelujah. Go change. Go in the bathroom and change. Come out with something kneeh high. Still a skirt, but it's just revealing more. Ain't bold enough to put them pants on cuz you put that skirt on, walk out there like I'm one of them. Then the other girls are cool girls looking at you like, "Girl, you trying too hard. You don't know they talking behind your back. giving up all the tea. It's a young people's meeting. You you younger you older folks, you don't know what I'm doing right now. You looking like what what is he trying to snap his fingers? What what what is he doing? What what what you go home have a sit down. See, that's the problem with us as parents. We are disconnected. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If your girl, hallelujah, got a question about holiness, she should come to you first, mom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz you should be an example. Hallelujah. Brothers, if your son got a question of what it's like to be a man, those questions you should be able to answer. &gt;&gt; But we disconnected. Well, we do soon as the child got a question. Well, what you know, girl come to mom, mom, I feel like I feel like wearing pants. The devil I bind that spirit. Brother Brandham said &gt;&gt; they ain't gonna never come back to you again. &gt;&gt; Cuz you do not understand the tenderness of their heart. &gt;&gt; They have questions. They're searching for truth and all you want to do is bust them across the head with a quote. Oh my. We're supposed to be connected in the home. Hallelujah. Even if you're a child. Amen. I learned something. Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; I learned something from a brother named Kim Boyer. He's going to be with the Lord now. But when I used to go, Hallelujah. him and Sister Shelly. When I used to go to their house in Calgary, Hallelujah. At least three of their boys wasn't serving the Lord at that time. Hallelujah. But every time I would come over, they'd come over. &gt;&gt; We'd fellowship. We go play ball. We go ride go-karts. And we'd have a good dinner. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know why they would come? Cuz they say, "When Brother D's come, mama going to cook something good." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Cadre ain't made it in yet. &gt;&gt; They say, "We on the way." And those boys would come, we'd eat, fellowship, didn't even have to talk about the Lord. &gt;&gt; But one thing I understood, one thing I took away from that family relationship, those boys love the God and their mommy and daddy. &gt;&gt; Even though they weren't living up to the standard, hallelujah, they didn't feel dirty when they got around their parents, they felt loved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why some of our children are not converted because when they got questions to ask us, they don't feel like you going to respond in love. &gt;&gt; But I knew those boys love mama and daddy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz they'd come around and fellowship with me even though I was the preacher and I preaching just like I preach right now. &gt;&gt; But they wasn't afraid of me. Hallelujah. They would fellowship. Hallelujah. Eat everything. Have a good time. Then they go back to their life. Hallelujah. What was their purpose? They love their family. &gt;&gt; They knew mom and daddy loved them even though they wasn't living right or up to the standard. Let me say it like that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you know that taught me something. &gt;&gt; That taught me what good is a Christian life if your kids don't see it in you? Oh, we we can come to church and fake one another out. &gt;&gt; God is the joy. [Music] &gt;&gt; You do all that stuff in church and while you doing it, your kids looking at you like, "Man, please, man, please." Soon as you get home, you got that pot swinging about the n I'm about speaking with your triny accent. Don't play with me. You know y'all know I was half trini ain't it? Got a little Jamaica rice in peace plan 10. I love my people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But church, pressure. Let me say that because I'm running out of time. Pressure. You ask that question like right now. Examine your heart. Are you under pressure? Only thing that makes it pressure is if you don't want to do it. &gt;&gt; Dressing right, sisters. is not pressure &gt;&gt; unless you don't want to do it. &gt;&gt; Having tattoos and gold chains, brothers, that's not pressure unless you want to do it. The things that makes it pressure is the element of sanctification. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet of God said, "Hallelujah. We know we're justified as if we've never done it. But are we sanctified? Sanctified is not your outside. Sanctified is the inside. Hallelujah. Sanctified is is is is Hallelujah. It's it's I I love the way he said it like this. He said real sanctification is when God takes away the want to. Now ask yourself, are you converted? Did God take away the desire, the want to to do it? &gt;&gt; For those of us who were delivered from drinking, hallelujah, we lost the want to. There's no more want to. For those of us who used to smoke, there's no more war to. That's what real sanctification is. And when God gets a hold of your heart, there's no more war two. &gt;&gt; Therefore, no more pressure. &gt;&gt; So, so for the next time you feel like you under pressure, ask yourself, why am I under pressure if I don't want to do it? &gt;&gt; It's pressure if you want to do it. &gt;&gt; Conditions of the heart. Let me move a little faster. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes. Oh, don't get me started about that one. Diabetes is what you put in your body. Your body automatically produces sugar, but it's how much you put in there. And then when you go to the doctor, they say, "Oh my, you got you got diabetes. You need to calm down. Hold up, Doc. I've been there. Hallelujah. Several times. Hallelujah. Trying to get me to claim this demon. &gt;&gt; You got Oh, Mr. Digs, you got diabetic. Doc, calm down. Calm down. You a little too excited. Calm down. You got Oh. Oh, you got glucose. I said, look, I don't see care if you see glucose, east coast, west coast, light toast, dark toast. I ain't got it. By his stripes, I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Make me claim something you didn't change the name of. &gt;&gt; Make a long story short, doctor come in say you got this guy say I ain't got it. And you know when nurses get tired of you, they say go in the other room. Shame on you nurse. They get tired of they don't want to talk to you. Just please just go on Mr. Digs just gone. I said I'm healed. body strikes I'm heal and they looking at that chart man all this glucose you got I don't care if it's east coast I ain't got it doc come in and say hey you got this you got that said no I don't know I don't she said we going to do a blood test I said praise God praise God if you going to examine me by the blood I already win &gt;&gt; somebody talk do I need to go get my sign if you going to examine me by the blood I already win. I am under the blood. She come back and said, "Wow, Mr. Dick, you don't got it." I said, "I told you." She said, "Well, what did you eat last night?" I say, "Sweet tea, chocolate chip cookies." She said, "That explains it. Sometimes it shows up in your body." So I'm sitting there thinking I'm like, "Okay, if it's sweet tea and chip a hoy, why you change the name to diabetes? Why you ain't call brother Mr. D? You got tea and cookies in your body. &gt;&gt; Enemy trying to put you under pressure." &gt;&gt; Let me keep moving. Obesity, too much of that lifestyle. Let me keep going. Hallelujah. Unhealthy diet. Hallelujah. I is I hope y'all see in the spiritual types of these things I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Obesity. Too much unhealthy diet. Something that's automatically going to make you sick. Think about your life. Think about what's really on your heart. Do you have things in your diet that automatically is going to make it rough for you? things that you do. Listen. Oh my. Excessive alcohol. Some of y'all looking like, "Not me. I don't drink. I don't drink." Spiritual application. &gt;&gt; Alcohol is what? It's a substance that takes over your body. How many of you have things in your life that takes over your body? &gt;&gt; It takes over the comprehensive measures of your mind. You on the internet surfing. Too much alcohol. Something that's taking over taken over you. You can't stop it. You just always on that website. Excessive alcohol. And when it's so bad, you know what alcohol do? It makes you drunk. Then you start craving it. You want to feel that feeling all the time. I can't wait till the weekend so I can get drunk and forget about my problems. [Music] Substance that takes over your body. Is there anything in your life right now that's taken over your heart? You love that more than you love God. We all had to come through that door. But we have things in our life that we love more than God. And God is never going to play second fiddle to anything. Anything. If he has to take you down holding on to it, he's going to take you down. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, God. Lord, he love me. Lord, he love me. Nobody can treat me like he do. He love me. God, I'll take you all the way down screaming for something that you don't need. Holding on to a boy that ain't even treating you right. Oh my. I can feel it. I feel these relationships in here. You can't hide that from the spirit. But the thing of it is, you got to ask yourself, does that mean more to you than heaven? You brothers, I love you. You going to let some nappyheaded boy keep you out of heaven? Huh? I said I love you, brothers. You ain't got to look at me like that. I was once one of them, too. It's just an expression. I know some of you got good hair. Come on, man. You love that thing more than that. And God is dealing with you and you won't give it up. You going to pay for it. Trust me. Especially after tonight. And let me say, let me drop a bomb on your relationship right now. If he ain't a man of God, you ain't the only one. A man without the Holy Ghost, he can't help but wonder cuz woman was designed and created for man. What's going to stop him from having more than one? The only thing is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He'll get tired of you and be like, "Hey, man. She all right. She nice. Look, everything good, but I'm just tired of them. Thank Thank you, sister. &gt;&gt; Just in case y'all ain't heard her, she said that ain't nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Young young young sister, I'm saying this because I love you. And what I'm saying is, hallelujah. God is dealing with the conditions of your heart. &gt;&gt; There are things holding you back from completely giving it to God. Oh my. And I don't want to be like that. Hallelujah. Oh my. Just in case I've been preaching for about an hour. I'm about to close. Don't get nervous. Listen, this is the one I like. It says excessive alcohol use and sleep apnnea. A lack of rest can give you heart disease. How many of us in here tonight, young people, young and old, really have rest? I ain't talking about that melatonin you taking at night. I'm talking about real rest where you put your faith in God and say, "Lord, I know this is this is this is uh uh I'm going through this. I don't know what it is, but I put it in your hands. &gt;&gt; Rest." Hallelujah. We got things in our life that we think about all day, every day. You need rest. &gt;&gt; Young people, you need rest. &gt;&gt; Oh, who I'mma marry? I'm going just I need to move to another church. Ain't nobody want to date me. All these things you need rest. &gt;&gt; When I get 18, I'm moving to America. Don't come over there. You ain't going to find rest like that. Some of you brothers way out in Australia. I'm going go to Australia. No, that ain't rest. Rest is trusting the Lord. &gt;&gt; Rest is leaning up on something and it becomes your strength. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you have rest tonight, young person? [Applause] See, real rest is you don't care what nobody say. &gt;&gt; You don't even care how it look. &gt;&gt; You just know that God got you. [Applause] Hallelujah. Oh my church, I got rest. Hallelujah. Cuz cuz cuz I know people didn't talked about me, made up things, say I'm uh too radical, say I'm Pentecost, all these things. I don't care. &gt;&gt; I look at it like this. Every door closed, God closed it. Every door open, God opened it. Every friendship I got, God gave it. Every friendship I don't have, God did it. My heart belongs to God. And just because you got something to say that you don't understand about me, that ain't going to put me under pressure. &gt;&gt; I know God is in control. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Young person, that's how you got to be. Hallelujah. It don't matter if the person beside you shouting and you not. Hallelujah. You do what God tell you to do. &gt;&gt; You be what God want you to be. Don't try to be with somebody else just to be pleasing in their sight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't get mad at me. Brother Danny knew what I was when he invited me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, church. Real rest through it all. You have to believe that God is on your side. &gt;&gt; Your heart has been given to him. &gt;&gt; No matter what you go through, no matter how bad it looks, hallelujah, you find rest in him. Hallelujah. See, I'm I'm I'm going to let you tap in to to to to my life for a second. Hallelujah. This is the way I look at it, bro. Hallelujah. When I go through things Hallelujah. And it may be on a scale. Hallelujah. The one to 10, it may be a 10.2. Hallelujah. Everybody see that. Everybody looking at it and like, "Wow, my problem is we got too many elephants in the church." You know who was? That was one of Job homeboys. He was supposed to be his friend, a message believer. First, Joe, come on, man. Stop lying to us. You know you a secret s and the whole thing was about God proving the devil wrong. You see how we be looking at one another? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You looking at somebody trying out judging him and it's God proving a point to the devil. &gt;&gt; He told the devil, "Hallelujah. You go ahead and take him. Put your hand on his life. I guarantee you he won't stop serving me." &gt;&gt; But that ain't the point. I'm making the point I make is hallelujah the way I look at things if I'm a son of God for me to fail or anything that's connected to me to fail hallelujah that means hallelujah God's reputation fails &gt;&gt; cuz I'm trusting in him hallelujah I'm depending on him I giving him my heart and you think God with his reputation on the line going to make himself look Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need rest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look here. This is This is This is This is maybe the last one. Hallelujah. We almost there. We ain't been in church two hours yet. I got about three of you. Y'all know if we was at the hockey game, boy, we'll be in that. &gt;&gt; Ain't even got the P. &gt;&gt; You in the stands acting up. First game I ever went to was out in Edmonton and I didn't realize that it's you. It's the people that initiate the fight. Y'all hear them laughing? Cuz they know when you go to the hockey game, it be the people saying, "Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight." And next thing you know, they Why we can't initiate the fight tonight? &gt;&gt; Huh? Why we can't bring the fight to the devil? He always in our face. Why we can't initiate the fight? Why we can't stand up in the devil face and say, "Satan, you got no power over me. &gt;&gt; You got no power over my mind. You got no power over my sleep, my rest, my body. You got no power." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's initiate the fight tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stop coming to church and getting beat up. &gt;&gt; But let's let the devil leave out of here staggering. &gt;&gt; Going back to his imps, going back to his angels, saying, "Man, we lost a lot tonight. &gt;&gt; We lost a lot tonight." &gt;&gt; We had some on our side, but they left us and they went on the other side. I thought they was one of us, but they had something that's on their heart. &gt;&gt; The last one I want to deal with, what affects heart disease, family history. Worst thing you can do is confess a generational spirit over yourself. &gt;&gt; Well, my daddy used to drink, so I drank. You didn't gave that devil a open door. Well, my mama wasn't submissive, so I ain't going to be submissive. Ain't no man gonna tell me what to do and you gonna be by yourself like your mom. &gt;&gt; Tolden that generational spirit. &gt;&gt; I'm from the US so I can say this. &gt;&gt; We talking about slavery. Harriet Tubman and lady at the back of the bus. They were strong women. I don't want no strong woman. I want somebody tenderhearted, kind, &gt;&gt; sensitive to the spirit. &gt;&gt; I don't want nobody when I say I'm going to fast. What you fasting for? I try to get closer to God and she got always got a question. Brother, the worst thing you I shouldn't say the worst thing. But you get a woman who always got to question your every move cuz she a strong woman. She got a high paying job. Ain't nothing wrong with that girl. Bring home that money cuz you ain't going to run the house. Well, you old fashioned. No, I'm god fashion. People want a traditional spouse without a traditional lifestyle &gt;&gt; or a traditional God. &gt;&gt; Oh man, honey, when we get married, we going to make our own vows. You know why they doing that? So they can take obey out. Those of y'all ain't married, y'all don't know what I'm talking about. But most of the sisters in here who got married traditionally when they were doing no vow, they say to love and to obey and they pause a little bit &gt;&gt; and to obey. But now they want to write their own vows. Hallelujah. So they can take that out. So they can live without that. It's confession of your mouth. Family history. Family history is very important. Hallelujah. Make sure you're on the right side of it. &gt;&gt; And what I say, Hallelujah. There going to be things in your family that move down through the generations, but you know what stops it? The Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost, it'll stop alcoholism. The Holy Ghost will stop weed, smoking marijuana. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost will stop pornography. The Holy Ghost will stop disobedience. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost will stop those generational curses. Hallelujah. If you get your heart right, &gt;&gt; it'll stop the devil in his tracks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in the midst of all these things, even so tonight, God may have come to your door. And I know he did cuz the atmosphere is too riched &gt;&gt; for God not to be dealing with somebody. But this is the key. For those of us who know God dealing with us and still don't want to give up, get that heart right. The greatest disease of the heart is pride. You'll sit in here right now and know you ain't right &gt;&gt; and walk out the same way cuz of pride. Pride and you love that thing. You don't want to give it up. Ask yourself tonight, has the word of God talked to me? Am I at least in one of those areas? Am I struggling in one of those areas? If you are, don't let pride let you walk out here with it again. &gt;&gt; I ain't saying you got to come and have hands laid on you, but what I'm saying is make your confession unto God. Give it to God. &gt;&gt; But what pride does, pride will see truth and know that they are wrong and still won't do it. &gt;&gt; That's Bible. I'mma give you an example. Remember Nicodemus came up to Jesus. He said, "Master, we know you a man sent from God. We know this. We know that." Tiptoeing by night. Don't want the people in the church see them get converted. I'mma get converted at home. I ain't getting baptized in church. Take me to Lake Ontario. I don't want nobody to be there. You don't want nobody to be there, man. We going to celebrate with you. What you mean? &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Oh, heaven rejoice over one soul that repented. You give your life to God. We going to welcome you into the family tonight. We going to have a worship cuz the devil has lost another one because he didn't know what was in your heart. Think about it. You got a woman wake up every morning in the Bible say, "Man, who I'm going to sleep with today? I need some money." She wake up every day. Her job is prostitution. But then one day she heard that the children of God were coming her way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even though she was a prostitute, nobody knew what was in her heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when the opportunity came, she gave God a heart. Even though she was a prostitute, what was her name? Rahab. &gt;&gt; Every day before that was erased in her confession. &gt;&gt; And she was even talking the language. She told them, "Hallelujah." She said, "Hey, look at look at her. Hey, y'all gonna hide up in there. Whatever this and that, man. They come back and say, "Look at don't you tell none of our business now." She said, "I won't. I ain't gonna tell her." She said, "But I need from y'all is a true token." She even had Holy Ghost language. Where was it coming from? From the inside. It was already in her heart. All she had to do was come to that moment in time and surrender. [Applause] And in that moment, hallelujah, that prostitute saved her whole house. &gt;&gt; All her brothers, her sisters, everybody. Her mom and her daddy. The prostitute did that. &gt;&gt; She saved everybody. Why? Cuz she gave her heart to the cause. Gave her heart to the cause. And she married a good man. &gt;&gt; She married a general. Hallelujah. He didn't want none of the fakers. &gt;&gt; He wanted a girl with a testimony. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; He wanted a girl that was listening to the word. Hallelujah. Rahab say, "We've heard what your God did and everybody heart melts for fear." She was listening. &gt;&gt; She wasn't a prostitute. She was a daughter of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my Rahab, that prostitute was in the lineage of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God allow his seed to come through a prostitute &gt;&gt; cuz she got her heart right. Don't you judge a book by its cover. &gt;&gt; I be thanking God for my son-in-law cuz he come out of a Baptist upbringing. I didn't say this before. And when he wanted to date my daughter, I said, "Boy, you got to be crazy. You don't know about I'm thinking, you don't know nothing about this message and you ain't getting mine." And I start acting crazy. Sisters, let me say this. Young girls, let me say this. Your daddy means well. He feels like he's your protector. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He feel like he's your protector. So, he's standing there. He may not even see what God see, but he gonna stand his ground until God show it to him. &gt;&gt; Nothing against you, nothing against your relationship, but as a daddy, he's there to guard you. &gt;&gt; And I'm tell you, I guard it. I guard it crazy. I told my daughter, my son-in-law now, she said, "Daddy, well, he won't nobody, Lord." I said, "Send him to the pastor. Don't try to trick me into no Bible study. I'm just being honest. She said, "But daddy, he won't know this." I said, "Look at let me tell you something. I don't like him and I ain't going to never like him." Now, would you bring your boyfriend to your daddy? He acting crazy like that. &gt;&gt; Nope. Nope. Drop me off at the stop sign. Cuz daddy acted a fool. &gt;&gt; And I was I was acting a fool. But I ain't know that at the moment. I'm just protecting in the only way I know how. Hallelujah. Y'all know I had to heed those words. I ain't going to never like him. He my son now. &gt;&gt; He my son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Loves this word. Loves everything that I love about this word. God made me eat those words. It's basically God say, "God gave me a new ministry, church." &gt;&gt; Powerful ministry. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell it to you. Powerful ministry. It ain't too many people preach on it, but it's powerful. It ain't it it ain't expressed in the church enough. Powerful ministry, I'm going tell y'all. It's called the Shut Your Mouth Ministry. Boy, that was deep, wasn't it? That what God told me. Shut your mouth. I got it. &gt;&gt; You dedicated her to me. Why you trying to take her back? I got it. &gt;&gt; Shut up. Be friends to the situation. I got it. &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes, Lord." &gt;&gt; Okay. And God started working. God start to move. Next thing you know, my my my my son-in-law now comes to me and say, "Hey, hey, Mr. D, I want to marry I want to marry your daughter." I said, "Boy, you got to be crazy." He said, "Yeah, I'm for real. I do." You know, "Hey, hey, I want to marry." Listen. I said, "You sure about that?" I said, "Well, y'all of age. I can't stop you, but dust, dust, dust, dust, and dust." He said, "Okay, but let me tell you something. I ain't going to propose. I ain't going to do nothing unless I got your consent. I like put Thank you God. Oh Lord, you gave me the right one. [Applause] It was over for me when he made that statement. It was over for me. &gt;&gt; He was my guy. &gt;&gt; You know what? God was protecting my heart cuz he know what kind of person I want. He know what kind of person you want for your children. Trust God. &gt;&gt; I need to close. But let me say this. Now that we all I think they've been married like four years now, five years, something like that. I didn't got lost in the blessing. Hallelujah. But church, when you look at things, you may think it ain't, but you gave your heart to God. God going to protect your heart. Hallelujah. Listen. Oh my church. The Bible says, just to give you scripture, the Bible says, we read, "For as a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he." Jeremiah 17 and verse 9 says, "And this is why you need a conversion." &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 17:9, it says, "The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. &gt;&gt; Who can know it?" &gt;&gt; So you out here and fell in love with a guy. Oh, I just love he loved me. Is he converted? But are you converted? &gt;&gt; Cuz that love may be desperately wicked. &gt;&gt; This is what the Bible says. The heart is desperately wicked. Who can trust it? &gt;&gt; You can't trust your heart without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Samson followed his heart and he got his eyes plugged out. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the ending thing. I'mma end up with. But look, hallelujah. We know through the message he say he gave God his strength, but he gave Delilah his heart. &gt;&gt; He gave his heart to the wrong person. &gt;&gt; And who he gave his heart to gave him the greatest trial in his life. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine sleeping with the enemy? Got his head in her lap. probably going to sleep smiling. Boy, boy, I got the baddest girl in Toronto. Oh, boy. She fine, boy. She got good hair. She got pretty skin. Samson, the Philistines are upon thee, church. This is how bad it is when your heart is not in the right place. Brother Dale, after she tried to kill me the first time, I'm gone. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. And if she tried to kill him the first time, I'd have been out of there. Deuces. Girl, you bad, but I'm gone. Don't fall in love with her looks cuz she might turn 50 60 one day. &gt;&gt; Might need a little dye. Need a little chapstick, little cream for that skin. I ain't say makeup. Don't fall in love with that body. She going to need a treadmill. &gt;&gt; She might have to work that thing out. Don't fall in love with that. Fall in love with Catile. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You fall in love with her character, it don't matter what her body look like. It don't matter what her hair look like. You fall in love with the person, &gt;&gt; not the appeal. &gt;&gt; And that's what it is, church. We fall in love with the person of Christ. &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. Samson had Oh, he was so blinded by the wickedness of his heart, the not knowing of his heart. Delila tried to kill him one time, he woke up the next day. Girl, you so crazy. And mom and daddy said, "I told you to stay away from the wicked girl, &gt;&gt; but he's so blinded by his heart." &gt;&gt; Second time she tried to come down, that would have been it for me. &gt;&gt; Fool me one time, shame on you. &gt;&gt; Fool me two times, shame on me. &gt;&gt; I think she tried to kill him by four times. tying the man hair up and all kind of abund the walls up on his shoulder. I'm in the message of the hour. Say, "Don't worry about it. I'mma get you. I'mma get you. Keep on." How did she get him? By playing with his heart. Samson. Samson, if you really love me, you really love me, you going don't do me like that. You really love me. Tell me your secret. I thought you love me. Well, if you don't love me, Ezekiel calling me anyway. Now, what they'll do? &gt;&gt; Go back to what? Putting you under pressure. &gt;&gt; I know we having a good time, but it's real talk. I present it like this because I want you young I want all of you to know who haven't given your heart yet, we love serving God. &gt;&gt; We get joy out of this. Coming to church is not misery to me. I love coming to church. I love coming to a meeting. Hallelujah. I love my pastor. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love the worship. &gt;&gt; I love the ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't get bored when I come to church. I love this part of it. &gt;&gt; Samson say, "Let me let me let me see if I really got that heart." Samson, I thought you love You don't love me. You love me, you tell you. Stop playing with me. You really tell me your secret. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Samson was vexed. &gt;&gt; He got tired of playing. &gt;&gt; He played with it so long till he let the vexation of his heart make him make a bad decision. Think about it, church. The girl was trying to kill him the whole time and he's so blinded by her looks. He didn't even realize it. Think about that. How many of y'all want a girlfriend trying to kill y'all? Anybody? Y'all ain't going to raise your hand. Come on. Be honest. Be honest. You want that wild thing. Come on. Be honest. You want that crazy love. Come on, be honest. You ain't going to raise your hand. But if you ain't got the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and you got a girl in the world, &gt;&gt; she's still taking your life. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you get caught out there before you repent, you know where you going? &gt;&gt; To hell. So you just as bad as Samson &gt;&gt; and vice versa sisters church. Matthew 6. Everybody all right. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going over time. I need to close. Man, I ain't got no go ahead and preach on that one. Don't worry. Don't Don't get nervous. We going to close it down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what we're doing is giving you time to think about it. &gt;&gt; Think about where your heart is and the conditions of it. The Bible says, "For where the treasure is, there will your heart be also." So whatever you love, wherever your goal is, that's where your heart is. &gt;&gt; If your heart is in your career, &gt;&gt; your heart is in your looks when you get in that mirror. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I still don't understand that one. I don't understand that. Why you want to look like a bee? I don't I don't understand that one. I know the prophet of God says any woman to look pretty, but you going too far with that one. You look like a bug for I come on musicians. I'm closing. One of the greatest challenges of the heart was David. David and Beth Sheba. David took another man's wife, got her pregnant, got the man killed, premeditated murder, &gt;&gt; hid it all, &gt;&gt; and then tried to cover it all up. &gt;&gt; Then the prophet came and start telling him a story. David said, "Where? I'mma kill him. I'mma kill him." You know what he was saying? He need to kill himself. &gt;&gt; I'mma kill him. I'mma kill him. They didn't say, "David, that man is you." David fell to his knees. Why? Because God had his heart. &gt;&gt; And we got one of the greatest Psalms ever. &gt;&gt; Psalms 51. Create in me. &gt;&gt; Oh, what? What did David say? Create in me a clean heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, sometimes we make wrong decisions based on our heart condition. That's what David was doing. Hallelujah. He made bad decisions, but his heart belonged to God. David said, "Creat in me a clean heart." What was it? Why did he make that decision? Because in those moments of his life, he didn't have any joy. &gt;&gt; He said, "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. Take not thine Holy Spirit from me. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that God didn't have his heart. He was trying to serve God with no joy. &gt;&gt; You said, "Really, David?" Yeah, David was a man of war. Every time you turn around, he was fighting a battle. &gt;&gt; His own son tried to take the kingdom from him. &gt;&gt; That man went through stuff. God was doing what? Testing his heart. &gt;&gt; So there was times where David, Hallelujah, he was a little down in his spirit. He made bad decisions. But then, hallelujah, when it was time to make it right, David say, "God, I have sin." He didn't try to cover it up. &gt;&gt; His heart belonged to God. I wonder how many of us are here tonight going to try to cover it up instead of getting your heart right. David repented. David said, "Create in me a clean heart, God. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And renew a right spirit in me. &gt;&gt; Where was his heart? It's given to God. &gt;&gt; Don't you realize that was the whole reason why God called him? Because God say, "I'm choosing a man after my very own heart." &gt;&gt; With his mistakes, after my very own heart, &gt;&gt; cuz God knew he will repent &gt;&gt; and keep his heart clean. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Create in me a clean heart. Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. [Music] Create in me a clean heart. Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. [Music] Oh, cast me away from thy presence, oh God. Take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore to me. Restore to me the joy of thy salvation. Every new world with me. Won't you let God deal with your heart as we sing it again? in me a clean heart. Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me, created me. [Music] Everybody in this room should be singing this song.

You're in this room right now dealing with the hearts of your people. &gt;&gt; And if we would just acknowledge your presence, hearts will be changed. Don't leave out of here carrying the same hurt, the generational curses, the pressures of life, the consuming spirits. Let God restore the joy of his salvation. Hallelujah. Lord, we thank you, Lord. And we bind every demon power &gt;&gt; that'll try to hold God's people. &gt;&gt; You stubborn spirit of pride, &gt;&gt; you turn God's people loose right now.
