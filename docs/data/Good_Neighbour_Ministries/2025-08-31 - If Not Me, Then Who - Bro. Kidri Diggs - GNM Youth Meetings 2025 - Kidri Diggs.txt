She felt such pain. Some spoke in anger. Heard folks whisper. There's no place here for kind. [Applause] Still on she came through the shame that flushed her face until at last she knelt before his feet. And though she spoke no words, everything she said was heard as she part her love for the master from her box of alabaster. So I've come to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's at a pastor box. So don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and I dried them with my hair. My hair. So you weren't there the night it found me. You did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his love all around me. And you don't know the cost of the oil in my alabaster bar. [Music] I can't forget the way life used to be. Cuz I was a prisoner to the sins that had me bound. And I spent my days poured my life without measure into a little treasure box. I thought I found until the day when Jesus came to me and healed my soul with the wonders of his touch. So now I am giving back to him. Oh, the praise is worthy of I've been forgi and that's why I love him so much. And I've come too for my praise on him like oil from Mary's alabaster box. Oh, don't be angry. If I washed his feet with my tears and I dried them with my hair, my hair, you were there. In the night Jesus found me. You did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me. And you don't know the cost of the oil. Oh, you don't know the cost of my bra. You don't know the cost of the oil in my bure. [Music] Hallelujah. Come on, good neighbor min.

And and you know, like as the as the the pastor of the church, you know, there's just, you know, you just can't help it. You feel the weight of the whole event upon you. And boy were we praying. &gt;&gt; We were praying. We had a special prayer meeting on Wednesday night. Let me tell you, I knew after that. &gt;&gt; All is well. All is well. Amen. Glory to God. And he's proven it over and over and over again. Amen. And so I want to welcome every one of you here this weekend. We are honored truly to have you uh to be a part of this wonderful event. It's been I'm going to say about 28 or 29 years that um we've been holding this uh youth camp. We've had it in many different venues and different ways. You know, several years ago, um you know, I attended a a special event in Oakville, which was a a golf tournament which our company supported for many many years and I would attend that that event every year and one year it landed right on our youth camp weekend and so I was having lunch with the organizers because we're good friends and I said hey I'm not going to be able to make it this year but we're going to be supporting it regardless and they said oh why Dan you know what do you mean you can't I said well you know I've been my wife and I and Good Neighbor Ministries we've been running a a a youth camp for many many years and it landed right on that weekend and we're going to be there. He said, "Oh, that's fine. We understand that." A couple months later, he asked me, he says, he says, "Um, tell me a little bit about this camp that you know that you run." And I told him a bit about it. And and then a couple months later, he says, "Dan, we've decided that we're going to uh make your youth camp one of our uh fundraisers as part of our fundraising event." And I said, "Really?" He says, "Yeah." He says, "We think it's a wonderful thing that you're doing for our young people." And so, so, uh, they they decided that they were going to make us, um, you know, one of the, uh, receivers. They've run this event for over 45 years. They've raised hundreds and hundreds, possibly over a million and more in in funds to support different various unique organizations. And I just thank God that that that the Lord laid it on their hearts to support this ministry. Praise God forever more. Don't you ever underestimate anybody. You got to be out there as a light shining in the midst and letting them know that God is a reality. That God is first place in your life. That the Lord is that you're that you're you're you're a happy Christian. you're you've got the joy of the Lord in your lives to serve God. Amen. And when people see that, they'll get behind it. Even if they're not a part of it, they'll still become some way somehow God can use them. Amen. And so, I want to acknowledge the Oakville Invitational Golf Tournament that they've been running in supporting Good Neighbor Ministries young people events for many years in a very significant way. And that's how we've been able to, you know, to do these things and do them to the best of our capacity. Amen. Praise God. Along with your support, of course. Amen. So, I want to acknowledge here this morning, and I want to give our former pastor, John Simon, a minute to come and just say hello. This is our founding father here of Good Neighbor Ministries. He's he's our our our backbone for many many many years. Still supports us dramatically and and significantly with his spiritual support. I call him the chairman of the board. God bless you, pastor. Very exciting. Greetings to all of you. I'm very happy to be here this morning trusting that God will bless us each and everyone. And in everything that you do, remember to be in prayer for these meetings. Even while the preacher is in preaching, pray for him and pray for the congregation. Anything can happen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Anything can happen. &gt;&gt; Brother Nelson knows this. I know this. Just been talking to people like this and all of a sudden a guy coughs up a cancer. What's that? The devil's scared of this kind of atmosphere. You've got to realize God is a reality. We're not imagining this faith. This is the unfailing reality of the living God. And uh praise the Lord. We're in the midst of it of the the uh I should say we are enveloped by the Holy Spirit. That is why we are here today because it struck our hearts and we thank God for the reality of this. Well, my time has passed. Actually, my time and brother Nelson's time has passed. We we we are old men now and our our swords are not dull, but they're still pretty sharp. But uh the fact is sometimes they are a little too sharp. And uh you see, but God had to use us to chop down the big trees, chop down all the bushes that were around so that uh the young brothers and evangelists of apostles and so on, teachers that they can plant the seed on good ground. But we had to deal with all the snakes and the spiders and everything else. Praise the Lord. And so God had to use us for that purpose. So sometimes we appear to our congregation to be rough. We appear to be direct. We pray to be this way, that way. And sometimes you know what people thinking of you, but they don't understand. So you just let it go. But just so you know, I'm saying it plainly now. I'm fully conscious that God use us as Acts 238s, you know, to be able to go with the axe to the roots. And if you're a modern, use 238 on you. So, uh, praise God. So, we thank God for all these wonderful, uh, brothers. We thank God for Brother Kid Diggs. uh and God bless his ministry. Of course, I watched the services every service and prayed for him that God will use him. And uh the today as we gather here and we are here together, I believe God has something special for you. And if you'll open your heart and look into it, let the word come in and he'll take control and God will let something break out in our midst. Amen. God will let it break out in our midst. And and you you you you don't think of how God works. We don't know how. But God breaks out in our midst. Some years ago, we are preaching and while we're preaching, somebody take the picture and the pillar of fire is in that tree of life. We still have the picture. The pillar of fire is in the tree of life. So, don't take anything for granted. The Holy Spirit moves softly and quietly and he just doesn't. You know what I'm saying? I'm not saying brother Dick should move like that. I'm just telling you the Holy Spirit moves like that. No, I just feel some people's thoughts, right? So, God bless you. Anyway, God bless. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother John. It's uh really been a tremendous honor to serve with him, next to him as a soldier of this revealed word for this day. I truly am honored. And so with us today also we have uh Pastor Lewis Nelson of Perfect Love Tabernacle. Let's give him a round of applause. God bless you. Amen. Amen. We've got Assistant Pastor Miguel Santana all the way from Quebec, Montreal. Montreal, Quebec. and and uh I'll tell you if um you know if you haven't listened in on his uh his uh messages you can go back even a couple years Akuna Matata you will be blessed. Amen. Praise God. And also we've uh had with us here this weekend um Pastor Langstaff uh was with us here on Friday night and uh he still has representation here with parts of his family. We want to acknowledge them and and thank them for their support. Amen. Pastor Dana, John Dana, uh representation here. Uh many of the saints have been here with us this weekend. We certainly appreciate that. I know that brother John had to be out in um Ottawa ministering and uh we've had representation from brother Gerard, Pastor Gerard Samuel. We've got some of the saints here from there. God bless you. Amen. Thank you for being a part of this wonderful event. Uh, brother Pastor Jimmy Cacera, also from Toronto. We've had representation from him this weekend. God bless you. Uh, Pastor Jimmy, Pastor Robert Lee, Brother Maxwell Lee's brother right here. He's here with us. He's been here every service except yesterday morning. But I'll tell you, he's he's a real blessing and I certainly appreciate him and his lovely wife and family. Amen. We've had Minister Brother Joseph Tombbe with us. Amen. And Sister Ruth was very excited to tell me sister Ruth Tombbe and brother Emmanuel saying how happy they are that they're, you know, most of their siblings are together here this weekend rejoicing around the word of God. So, we certainly um are grateful for that. Amen. Praise God. And you know, I want to get all the thank yous out of the way and I guess because we're going to go right to the word after this, but I want to thank Good Neighbor Ministries leadership and events coordinators. They have done an absolutely outstanding. They've gone beyond. Amen. Praise God. [Applause] you know, we've got a couple of young people, you know, and many of the young people were involved, but there's always those that have to, you know, they got to be the ones that are willing to take that first step, right, and move and move forward to do things that need to be done. And Michelle Brennan and um and Matteline and uh you know uh many of the other young people, but you see all these unique things. We've got our own ice cream parlor. you know, these are things that they they came up with and um they're just so creative in the way that they've they've organized these things. They've um they've uh supported in the marketing and getting the the message out to the young people and they've spearheaded in many ways. I want to acknowledge them and I want to thank them both. Amen. Thank you very much. Glory to God. uh brother Alvin, brother Mike Brennan, and sister Elaine and Sister Amanda, you know, they are tirelessly working behind the scenes to keep this event moving smoothly and they have done it with precision. Amen. May God bless and and prosper and bless each and everyone. all the cleaning committees, those that have been cooking, Sister Elizabeth behind the scenes directing and guiding the the the cleaning and the uh you know, there's so much that goes into these events. And and you know what? They have recognized that to do that and to do it out of the service unto the Lord, they're just heaping blessings upon their lives. They can't help it. Not that they're doing it because of that. No, they have a revelation. It's the same thing of, you know, when you give unto the Lord, you're tithing and everything else. You're robbing yourself when you don't get into your position and allow God to use you as a son or a daughter of God the way that he should. Amen. Praise God. So, I want to thank everyone from the the ushers to the to the doorkeepers to the to to the sound and engineering and and the musicians that have, you know, uh been there and the singers. Praise God. I just want to say thank you Lord for a wonderful wonderful team and local body of Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Well, at this time we want to change the order of the event. Um, we are going to be having baptisms at the end of the service. And so at this time, we're going to sing word of God speak. We're going to ask the Holy Spirit to now take control of the atmosphere, take control of our dear brother Kyrie Diggs, who's come to be with us once again. anytime he has been here with us, the Lord has really been so good through his ministry and we are appreciating that. We are acknowledging his ministry. We are grateful for it and we will continue to support it and pray for him. Amen. Let's sing that song. Word of God speak. Won't you pour down like rain? Let's all stand. Washing my eyes to see your majesty. [Music] Be still. Let me know. You're in this place. Please let me stay in your holiness. Word of God. [Music] Oh word of God speak. Won't you pour down my bra, washing my eyes to see your majesty peace now I know you're in this place is the [Music] holiness [Music] Rest, little bride. He's on a time mic today. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. Appreciate you. to be still and know that you're in this place. &gt;&gt; Stay restless. [Music] One more time. Word of God speak. [Music] Word of God singesty [Music] [Music] to be still and know that you're in this place. &gt;&gt; Stay and rest. your holiness of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have your seats real quick. Amen. I can't I can't um go forward without giving my peace, saying my peace, but uh as as Pastor Danny said, uh God has been good. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I also want to pay homage to the pillars. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pastor Nelson, Pastor Simon, you know, I've been around a pretty long time by the grace of God, &gt;&gt; sitting in those seats where you are. And those two brothers have been a blessing to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I can remember, and I'm pretty sure brother Pastor Simon may remember this, but him coming to the States and preaching at our church and preaching in the area. Back in those days, we used to follow the word, &gt;&gt; you know what I mean? He he didn't just have to come to our church. We would go to the other churches, too. &gt;&gt; That's that's how bad we I mean, we love the revelation, &gt;&gt; you know? So he would maybe come to Colombia and preach at four churches. We'd be at all four. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it was one particular message he preached called Beyond the Veil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church. And we wind that tape and wind that it was tapes then. Hallelujah. Kind of telling how old I am. But it was it was tapes. And we would wind that tape and wind that tape. We actually popped the tape listening to it so much. But it was God speaking to his people. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I appreciate the gift within him and how much of a blessing he was. And and Pastor Nelson, me and him met in actually in the States and we've been friends ever since. Actually, Brother Nelson's is the first church I ever preached at in Canada. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Way back in the early 2000s. So, uh, I thank God for these two men. They've definitely been a blessing to me. And when you see young men like me, we're standing on their shoulders. &gt;&gt; We're standing on the thing that God did through them. Like, like Pastor Simon said, the battles they had to fight, we ain't got to fight. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I mean &gt;&gt; being called serpent seed and all all kind of stuff, you know, for the gospel, we certainly appreciate them. Amen. And uh I I thank God I have a pastor back home.

He saw all those Canadian stamps. and and he didn't even stamp my my passport. He gave it back to me and say, "Welcome home." So, I love you. I hope you love me. &gt;&gt; Amen.

I hope we don't have the Holy Spirit on the time clock today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray and and expect God to do what he's always done. &gt;&gt; You know, I believe that the pillar of fire is moving right now. &gt;&gt; I believe it's in this room. Somebody ought to challenge God and say, "Lord, show yourself." &gt;&gt; Lord, I know you here. Show yourself. Pull your camera out. Take a picture. Show yourself, God. That's how real He is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's Let's pray. Let's raise our hands to the Lord. Lord, Father God, we give you all the glory and honor. For truly you are worthy, Lord. Lord, there's nothing else we could say, nothing else we could do except but give you the honor, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, because if you don't do anything else, you've done enough, Lord. We're here under the merits of your spirit and your grace, Lord, in our right minds, Lord, with the blood atoning over our lives, Lord. and you made us a brand plucked out of the fire. &gt;&gt; And Lord, you see those situations that stand before you, Lord. I I even have my hand raised, Lord God, to put my need before you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Lord, you see all the other needs in this room. But Lord, we want to desire that of your perfect will &gt;&gt; and that alone. So Lord God, keep the potter's hands upon us and mold us into the image of your mind. And Lord, be with us in this service. Lord, forgive us for anything that's not like you, Lord. And let the blessings of the Holy Spirit dominate this service. In the wonderful name of Jesus Christ, we pray. The church say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. If you um have your Bibles, let's turn to Isaiah chapter 5. Isaiah chapter 5. Y'all know I I I really don't plan on being long, but you control the gift. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 5. I really do appreciate what the Lord has done here this weekend &gt;&gt; and what he's going to do today. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's worthy. Isaiah 5 and I mean I'm sorry Isaiah chapter 6. Isaiah 6. And let's start reading at verse one. The Bible says in the year that King Uzziah died. I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraraphims. Each one had six wings. With twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto the other, and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory." And the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. Then said I, woe is me. &gt;&gt; Now this is how we ought to feel in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That when God's glory come in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We ought to stand in awe and say, "Lord, to you be all the glory and honor." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Woe is me, for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts. Then flew one of the seraraphins unto me, having a live cold in his hand, which he had taken with the tongue from off the f off the altar. And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this have touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thine sin purged. This is what happens when the Holy Ghost fills you. Also I heard a voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send and who will go for us?" Then said, "I here am I. Send me." &gt;&gt; Let's go to 1st Samuel chapter 17. 1st Samuel 17. Just to make the reading short, let's start at verse um 26. 1st Samuel 17 and 26. Ah, I love that sound pages. shall be done. Let me let me Yeah. What shall be done to the man that kleth this Philistine? And taketh away the reproach from Israel. For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God? And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kleth him. And Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spake unto the men. And Eliab anger again was kindled against David. And he said, Why camest thou down hither, and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and thy naughtiness of thine heart, for thou art come down, that thou mightest see the battle. And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? Amen. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; church. This morning, I want this message to be real personal to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we we we said last night, what good is it for us to have these meetings and nobody get closer to God? What good is it to have these meetings and you walk out of here with the same struggles, the same problems, &gt;&gt; you know? And my thought this morning for all of us is if not me, then who? &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? That's why I want you young people to ask that question. &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? &gt;&gt; We believe that we're in the last days. &gt;&gt; We're in the last church age. &gt;&gt; There's nobody coming after us. &gt;&gt; So whatever God promised in his word, it has to be fulfilled by a people. &gt;&gt; So I'm saying today, if not me, then who? Hallelujah. If not us, &gt;&gt; then who? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If the power of God in full manifestation is supposed to move on this earth through our young people, &gt;&gt; if not you, then who? &gt;&gt; The scripture says, hallelujah. And we heard it through a vindicated prophet. If there is another book of Acts, it'll be just like it was in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; So if not you, then who? [Applause] It has to be us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every church, every group of young people &gt;&gt; before you, they had God revelation by measure. &gt;&gt; But unto us, we have the fullness of God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We know everything it takes to get to heaven. &gt;&gt; We had a prophet who came and he didn't preach in part. He preached perfect faith, [Applause] &gt;&gt; perfect love, &gt;&gt; divine healing. So I'll say church if anybody hallelujah should be able to step in perfection &gt;&gt; it should be us &gt;&gt; if anybody &gt;&gt; by the grace of God &gt;&gt; should be able to demonstrate all that God is all that he said he should do. &gt;&gt; It should be us. &gt;&gt; If not me, &gt;&gt; then who? [Applause] &gt;&gt; If not you, then who? &gt;&gt; You young people? &gt;&gt; This is your day. &gt;&gt; This is your time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If anybody should be able to look the devil in the face &gt;&gt; and say, "I know my God. &gt;&gt; I know who he is. &gt;&gt; I know what he's capable of. &gt;&gt; If not me, if not you, then who? See, the Holy Spirit is already moving. &gt;&gt; It don't take 30 minutes of preaching for your prayers to be answered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It don't take 45 minutes of church for God to bless your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If not now, then when? [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But church, I want you to understand, oo, I'm feeling lightfooted this morning. You know a boxer before he fight, he feel lightfooted. Hallelujah. He starts to bounce around a little bit. Hallelujah. Because he remembers his technique. Hallelujah. And he starts to get lightooted before the battle. &gt;&gt; Church, it's time for us. Hallelujah. to stop babysitting the gifts inside. &gt;&gt; We have people right here in this building. &gt;&gt; They have supernatural testimonies. &gt;&gt; Supernatural testimonies. &gt;&gt; You see this young man right here? Hallelujah. The devil tried to kill him while he was in Portugal. A professional football player. But God If not you, then who? Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; You think God saved you for death just to sit around in church? No. There's something God want you to do. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; And to every young person in here, you're hearing this thought because God got something from you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He got something for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But church, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look church, if we ask that question, &gt;&gt; if not me, then who? &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says, Hallelujah. When the seventh angel begin to sound, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God &gt;&gt; will be finished. Come on. &gt;&gt; So, if we're at the finish line, &gt;&gt; somebody should be showing me something. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There should be evidence that you're in first place. &gt;&gt; We're not in the back of the race. &gt;&gt; We're in the front. &gt;&gt; God put us out front. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, church, hallelujah, it was the seventh seal that revealed the first seal. So the seven seal had to open first. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Stuff they're still debating about. But God said, hallelujah, through a prophet that he'll raise up young people &gt;&gt; that'll live this message &gt;&gt; and make it come off the pages. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I want you to understand something. Hallelujah. What you're seeing, what you're looking at is the fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Prophecy is a fortold future event. &gt;&gt; It's something that seemed hallelujah that will come to pass. And just to give you a little insight, I never wanted to be a preacher. &gt;&gt; I wanted to be a football player. &gt;&gt; Go Cowboys. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But church, God had other plans. &gt;&gt; So you know, after he allowed me to get cast in my brain, there was a purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Oh, the devil, you did this." I hate even mentioning the devil's name in church. Hallelujah. Only time I like to talk about spirits is to cast them out. &gt;&gt; But what we do too often in our Christian journey, young and old, we talk about what the devil is doing. That's right. &gt;&gt; The devil did this. The devil did that. The devil messing with my children. Devil made me lose my job. Devil broke down my car. Everything ain't the devil. &gt;&gt; Some things God do just to awaken you. &gt;&gt; Something God do. Hallelujah. It's the process of stripping away your spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And church. Hallelujah. God allowed me &gt;&gt; to get cancer in my brain. &gt;&gt; And for those of you who don't know me, you would have never known that if I would have told you. &gt;&gt; That's how good the grace of God is. &gt;&gt; When God do something, he really does it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I talk God, Amen. I don't talk especially healing. I don't talk about, you know, uh, I'm in remission. I ain't in no remission. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If God ever heals you, it's done and over. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; I ain't looking for cancer to come back. It can't come back &gt;&gt; because now, hallelujah, there's a greater power living in this body. &gt;&gt; But God would allow you to go through things just to what God does. You be minding your own business and he bump into you. &gt;&gt; I was minding my own business, playing football. Football. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not soccer. football. [Applause] That's me in his thing. Hallelujah. But you know, church, I was minding my own business and God bumped into me and he allowed, let me say this. If you going through anything, look at what you going through. Could it be that God wants to get glory out of &gt;&gt; Come on now, &gt;&gt; I can't stop this. I can't stop that. But when God comes on the scene, [Music] &gt;&gt; and he takes it from you, &gt;&gt; he did that &gt;&gt; so he could get glory. [Music] God will let the devil loose. Hallelujah. Just to hold him in a cola and say, "Don't you move until I tell you to." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look, cancer in my brain. I ain't going to go through the whole testimony. Y'all done heard it. But church, what was it? God knew &gt;&gt; that I was a seed. He knew he put something in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But his thing was, &gt;&gt; how do I awaken it? &gt;&gt; I need to awaken it. &gt;&gt; I need to awaken it in such a way that he'll know it was nobody but me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I need to do something in his life that nobody else will get the credit but me. I need to do something in his life. Hallelujah. No matter what he go through, he'll never forget what I did. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; church. So, he allowed me to get canc. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I'm going I'm not going to go through all the healing, the supernatural things that God did. Oh, and it was supernatural. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God does anything, hallelujah, he'll do it by his attributes. &gt;&gt; God is a healer. He can't help himself. &gt;&gt; He has to be that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the question is, will you put him in position to be that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You make him what he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You make him a healer. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to be sick for him to be a healer. You make him a deliverer. Somebody had to be bound so he can be a deliverer. You make him a savior. Somebody had to be lost, &gt;&gt; church. I was lost, but I made him savior. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel like having a praise break. Hallelujah. I feel like having a praise break. I feel like having a praise break. I feel like having a praise break. I feel like having a praise break. I feel like having a praise break. I feel like having a praise break. I feel like having a praise break. I feel like having a break. I feel like having a praise break. Is he good? Is he good? Is he good? Is he good? I feel like having a praise break. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Has he been good to you? church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We we we sing a song back home and it says, "Don't wait till the battle is over. &gt;&gt; You ought to shout now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, I got a song in my heart right now and it says, "I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory for the battle belong to the Lord. I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory for the battle belong to the Lord. How many of you got the victory? &gt;&gt; How many got the victory? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, I stand here because I'm a product of victory. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me calm down a little bit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know. I know some of you saying, "Well, where he going to preach?" My life is a message. &gt;&gt; God's been good to me. Hallelujah. The prophet of God will say, "Hallelujah. You could preach me a sermon, but I'd rather you lift me one." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. Canceling my brain. What was happening? God knew that there was a seed inside. &gt;&gt; And I know some of you, you may be here visiting loved ones or this is your first time on this side of the world or different things. You're from different churches. But let me tell you something. It's not by coincidence. Come on now. &gt;&gt; That you are here. &gt;&gt; Because God is bumping into you. &gt;&gt; He wants to wake up that life inside. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I come to visit some friends." And here comes God. Boop. Here comes God. He bumps into you. What does he do? He gets your attention. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I never felt that before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But church, God bumped into me. He allowed the enemy, hallelujah, to send his imps loose, canceling my brain. Hallelujah. But I had an angel with me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Gabriel. It wasn't Michael. It was mama. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I didn't have the Holy Ghost, but she did. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, she stood in the gap. &gt;&gt; She came in my room. She said, "Son, you don't have to accept this because God has already healed you." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, church. What you're looking for God to do, he's already did it. If not now, then when? Hallelujah, church. So, Hallelujah. Cancer comes. But what is the purpose of cancer or the trial? Cancer was the only thing that could awaken a revelation that was in my seat. [Music] &gt;&gt; What did it awaken? Hallelujah. Cancer was the only thing that could wake up. Hallelujah. I'm the Lord thy God &gt;&gt; that health thee from all thy diseases. So God let cancer come my way just to awaken Jehovah &gt;&gt; Rafa just to awaken. &gt;&gt; Just to awaken. Hallelujah. There's something in you that God is trying to awaken this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And once Jehovah Rapha, the revelation of who he is was awakened, it was over. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was over. &gt;&gt; The devil was done. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because the seed started to come to life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And everything that was in that seed start to push out. &gt;&gt; What did that God bumping into me? &gt;&gt; See, amen. We give the devil too much credit. &gt;&gt; We say, "God, God, the devil did. The devil did that." And we go into prayer talking about the devil. Oh God, the devil's been fighting me. &gt;&gt; Oh God, the sickness is I don't know if I can take it. The devil. Oh, he's ranting and raging. Oh God, it's the same old devil. And this is your prayer. God is sitting there like going like Are they talking about me yet? &gt;&gt; There's no one like Jehovah. There's no one like Jehovah. There's no one like Jehovah. And they talking about me yet. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to get his attention talking about the devil. &gt;&gt; But he says if I be lifted up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, hey, y'all better get it together cuz they pulling hard over here. &gt;&gt; This side pulling hard over here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is moving over here. &gt;&gt; I don't know what the rest of y'all going to do, but y'all better come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But church, fast forward now. I'm in the ministry. Hallelujah. Still a young man. I'm still a young man. [Applause] I got a promise. You know, some people don't believe in youth meetings. Hallelujah. They don't believe in Thessalonians then. Hallelujah. Cuz the Bible says that the sky is going to crack and we'll be changed in a moment of a twinkling eye. That's going to be the biggest youth meeting ever. That's going to be the biggest youth ever. I said ever. Ever. Ever. That's going to be the biggest youth beat ever. &gt;&gt; The Bible says we'll be changed in a moment of a twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; And they don't believe in youth. meetings. Well, let me say it like this. If not me, &gt;&gt; then who? If not me, then who? &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? If not you, then who? [Applause] They just He just be He just be exciting the young people, man. Shut up. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Ain't going to be no seats in heaven. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on. Come on now. &gt;&gt; You think you going to be in heaven controlling your emotions? [Music] [Applause] And some of you won't even raise it high. &gt;&gt; God don't see that praise. You think the glory of God. Hallelujah. You know I love talking about heaven. &gt;&gt; Let's go to heaven for a second. &gt;&gt; Does anybody want to go to heaven for a second? Let's go to heaven first. &gt;&gt; Let's go to heaven first. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. After we've hallelujah, come out of Latinia. I don't know about you, but I'm already out. &gt;&gt; I'm already out. &gt;&gt; I'm in a bright age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. Now we're in heaven. Hallelujah. What is it going to be like? It's going to be worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's going to be some worship. &gt;&gt; Y'all think Maverick City wrote them songs for them? No. They wrote it for the pride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can't be quiet. My God is alive. How can I keep it inside? I won't be quiet. My God is alive. How can I keep it inside? Praise the Lord, oh my soul. Everybody say, "The Lord of my soul." Think about it, church. &gt;&gt; See, you feel that &gt;&gt; some of you, it's hard for you to get in that channel. Trust me, you better do it down here. Cuz the prophet said whatever you are down here is what you going to be over there. And if you can't give God praise down here meat. [Applause] Ah, brother D. Brother D just so emotional. Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; Prophet say if your religion ain't got no emotion in it, you need to bury it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You need to bury it. &gt;&gt; Hallelu. We fight. Why don't we fight against the young people having a good time? If they can't have a good time in church, where can they have a good time? Huh? Huh? If we can't praise the Lord in church, where can we praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If I can't act a fool in church, why can't I act a fool? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, that was that was just a lot of streaming. It was just emotion. &gt;&gt; What makes it emotion? &gt;&gt; The messenger said he said when the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; comes, &gt;&gt; come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He brings in emotion. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You say, "Really, Brother Diggs?" Yes. Because the Holy Spirit is a person &gt;&gt; and any person without emotion is dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if God if the Holy Spirit is a person that means that person is alive, &gt;&gt; my experience is a lie. &gt;&gt; Your experience is a lie. &gt;&gt; Devil say you know that's just emotion. What makes an emotion is if you scream, shout, dance, kick, holler, scream, hallelujah, and then the next day you live contrary to what you did, that was just emotional. But if you kick up, &gt;&gt; you dance, you shout, hallelujah, and you leave this meeting next week, you still dancing, you still shouting. That wasn't emotion. That was coming into his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh my Oh my church. Now I'm preaching. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about right now. I'm talking about my life &gt;&gt; now. I'm preaching and God comes. God comes and he says to me, "Hallelujah. I had to take some services in another pastor's church. My young guy, not even out preaching much." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he called me to do a youth meeting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Call me to do a youth meeting. Pastor Jackson. Hallelujah. So church, we get there and we start having some church. They start singing and worshiping a powerful anointing. &gt;&gt; Like how these young people was handling these gifts this morning. That's what I love. &gt;&gt; I love to see young people that's going to worship. &gt;&gt; Don't get up here tonight. [Music] That girl handled that thing just &gt;&gt; the same thing. God &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The the the Bible says Hallelujah. Amen.

[Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like it's doing right now. &gt;&gt; And her sister was sitting on the front row. She said she started seeing something. She said and she thought it was an evil spirit and she thought it was something she was doing. So she got up and ran to the bathroom. And when she went in the bathroom, she started repenting. She said, "Lord, forgive me. I don't know what's going on, but if there's anything I'm doing, Lord, please forgive me. Forgive me for my sins." Hallelujah. Because of what she was seeing. So, she said, "God speaks to her and say, "Hey, go back out there. There's something I want to tell I want you to tell my servant." Hallelujah. And while I'm preaching, she comes back and sits on the front row. Now, I'm telling this because this is her testimony, &gt;&gt; but I'm a part of it. &gt;&gt; Just like you are a part of my testimony. &gt;&gt; And when I finish this testimony, you going to see what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; But church, she said she sit on the front. She see me. She said, but while I'm preaching, she sees two of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She said, "This me right here steps into this me behind the pull pit." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this me begins to preach and then it steps back out and then it steps back in and preach. She said, "Every time this me stepped into this me, I will speak to the church." She said, and she was watching that and seeing and she was like, "Lord, I don't know what's happening. What's going on with me?" She He said, "Sit still." He said God, she said God be to minister to her and say remember the prophet said that there are supernatural beings right in this room right now. &gt;&gt; He said but the natural eye can't see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your healing is in this room right now. &gt;&gt; The angel of healing is in this room. &gt;&gt; The angel of deliverance is in this room. The angel of joy &gt;&gt; is in this room &gt;&gt; and the minister of faith is in this room. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to be able to see it with your natural eye. &gt;&gt; You have to tap in by faith. &gt;&gt; She said, but as she was watching it, hallelujah, God be to take her back what she heard on books and tapes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said the Lord said to her, he said, remember that dimension is just a little bit faster than the natural eye. &gt;&gt; And saying what you're watching is his theophony. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He said God told her his theophony is giving the word to him and then he preaches what the theophony gives him &gt;&gt; and the theophony keeps stepping. What is a theophony? It's a word body. It's your representation in heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, she was watching my representation. Hallelujah. Give me a word for the people. &gt;&gt; But the only way my word body would give you a word is only that you got representation too. Amen. &gt;&gt; You were in heaven also. &gt;&gt; That's the only way God would minister to you. You also had to be there, &gt;&gt; church. So, she's watching my theophony. Hallelujah. Give this body, my flesh body, a word. Hallelujah. For the people. And then she said that God told her, "Hallelujah, I want you to tell him that I called him." Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, I didn't come out of a time where, you know, I Oh my, I'm I'm studying and I think I'm a preacher. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mm-m. &gt;&gt; Vindication, &gt;&gt; waiting on God, &gt;&gt; not moving until you get to say so. &gt;&gt; You know, nowadays, people feel like they can because they can read the same quotes and and all this stuff that they can tell the preachers what to do &gt;&gt; cuz they reading the same thing. What you fail to realize, there's a gift there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not by knowledge. It's a gift there. Hallelujah. She says, "I want you." He said, God says to her, "And look, I'm not lifting myself up." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you this because he's still the same God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look, she says, God said to her, say, look, I want you to tell him that I called him. Hallelujah. I called this ministry and I'm going to take his ministry in places that he could only imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to bless him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; At that time, I didn't know Pastor Simon or Pastor Nelson. &gt;&gt; But I've been to Canada countless times. &gt;&gt; Fulfillment of what? Prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take me in places I can only imagine. &gt;&gt; Last Christmas, I was in the Philippines, me and some brothers, and we were and I had no desire to go there. We were going to the Philippines. The brother asked me, he say, "Brother Diggs, have you been to all the continents?" And I was like, "Huh? &gt;&gt; Geography wasn't my strongest part." Continent. Only continent I know of is Africa. But then I say, "What? What? What kind you talking about? They said, "I'm in the seven seven continents." And they started to naming them. Say, "Yeah, been there." Name another. I said, "Yeah, I've been there." See, I can't even name them back to you. Yeah, I've been there. Yeah, I've been there. Yeah, I've been there. Because I'm a fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; I've been to six of the seven continents. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Preaching God's word. &gt;&gt; Come on. But it ain't because I got deep pockets. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; It's a fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; And the only reason why I'm here today is because it's also a fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; And you are a part of that prophecy. You are a part of what God is doing in this last day. Hallelujah &gt;&gt; church. So everywhere I preach, hallelujah, outside of my home is a fulfillment of prophecy. The only place I hadn't been is Antarctica and got no desire to go there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But church, it's something God is doing. &gt;&gt; So you have to ask the question, if not me, oh my You know what this reminds me of? The ice cream parlor. [Applause] Let me move forward church. So you let me say this. Prophecy will find you &gt;&gt; young people. But if God got something for you, can't nobody else do it but you. &gt;&gt; So you need to be like Isaiah. Isaiah said, "Woe is me." God say, "Who shall I send?" Isaiah said, "Lord, here am I. Send me. I will go." Once Isaiah got touched by the fire, nothing could stop him from going. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the question is, have you been touched by the fire? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, listen. I want to use a Bible character real quick as I'm condescending. Hallelujah. Cuz I'm way up there right now. Way up there. H. And all of us, we way up there right now. &gt;&gt; But let's meet in the middle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm talking about supernatural things taking place right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But church, let's look at David for a second. &gt;&gt; I love David's life. &gt;&gt; David made many mistakes. &gt;&gt; Some things premeditated. &gt;&gt; But whenever David was confronted by God, he didn't make excuses. &gt;&gt; Many of times David say, "Lord, I have sinned." Amen. &gt;&gt; And because David was honest, God always gave him mercy. &gt;&gt; So I say to you, if you got things in your life, don't try to hide it from God. He see you. &gt;&gt; He know what you doing. &gt;&gt; He see you. He know what you watching. &gt;&gt; He know what you listening to. So when the word of God comes and step on your toes, don't try to act all super spiritual. Say, Lord, forgive me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Lord, have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; That's what David said. David say, Lord, I have sinned. What was that? Hallelujah. That was an illustration of a man that had the heart of God. &gt;&gt; Even though he made mistakes. Hallelujah. There was something in David's heart that always wanted to be right with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Through all of his mistakes, and I'll say, hallelujah. If God did that for David, Hallelujah. Why not me? &gt;&gt; Why not now? &gt;&gt; And if not me, then who? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But David, church, &gt;&gt; David. Hallelujah. This is what happened. God told Samuel, "Everybody all right?" &gt;&gt; See, by now we should be feeling the charge. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't be no sleepy demons in here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By now, everybody's sword should be out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That sword should be out like this. Hallelujah. Everybody should be ready. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For whatever enemy is trying to stop your blessing. [Music] It's time to pull it out of the seat. &gt;&gt; First, David. Hallelujah. The prophet comes down to this house because God told him the next king is down there because Saul was disobedient. &gt;&gt; So David, hallelujah, he's out doing what he normally do, tending to the sheep. But then Samuel comes in, knocks on the door, knocks on the door, he comes in. Jesse. Jesse looks at him. First of all, everybody was afraid when a prophet came to town &gt;&gt; cuz they know he had a word from God. &gt;&gt; And you didn't play around with God's prophet. &gt;&gt; I don't know what in the world's going on today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But church, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Samuel tells Jesse, "Hey, God told me to come here &gt;&gt; and I got an anointing oil." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because he says the next king is in your house. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh my glory, glory." He tell his boys, "Y'all go wash up real fast." Real fast. Go put on your best clothes. Hallelujah. Go put on your Gucci. Go put on your Michael Kors. Go put on your Nike. Go put Go put it all on. Amen. Go put it on. Go put on your Louis. Go put Go put it on. Amen. You got a bag. Go get the Birkin. Get it off. Put it on. Those [Laughter] are the styles of today. &gt;&gt; But church, he says, "Go get go get go get refreshed." So, you know, the oldest brother come out. Hallelujah. And he just knew he was the king. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Samuel say next. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't come to God all prideful. &gt;&gt; Come with humility. &gt;&gt; Next brother comes. &gt;&gt; You got rejected, huh? Okay, my turn. He ain't learned a lesson from his brother. &gt;&gt; He come out there with the same attitude. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Nothing. He walks away. Next brother come out. Not not not not I'm not. If God ain't chose y'all, it got to be me. Y'all going to bow down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bye. The next brother come. All y'all married Jack must be me there. Prophet, you doing what God told you to do? It ain't me. Who? What? Sam said, "Boy, get on out of here. It ain't you." All the way down to the last one in the house. &gt;&gt; Now he feeling special. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz all his brothers and got rejected. He said, "I told y'all it was me. I thought it was me." He comes up. Hallelujah. He feeling himself. &gt;&gt; He feeling himself. [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He feeling himself. Y'all know what y'all be doing at home in y'all mirror. Let me practice this new dance. I ain't going to never go to a club, but let me try it. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Talking about some boots on the ground. So he feeling he feeling he feeling like a king. He like, "Oh my, here it is. I've been waiting on it." And then he looked back at his brothers and they like, "Can't be can't be you. Can't be you. Nothing. Go on ahead. Go on back." And Samuel says, "Come on, Jesse. God don't make mistakes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God don't make mistakes. God don't make mistakes." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If God brought the messenger to your house, it's because your message material. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God brought the anointing to your church, it's because you can bathe in his presence. &gt;&gt; God don't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And for those of you who are in an identity crisis, God knew what he was doing when he put a woman in a woman's body. &gt;&gt; God knew what he was doing when he put a man in a man's body. The only one confused is you. had a young sister tell me one time, hallelujah, she said came in prayer line. She said, "Oh, D, the devil's telling me that I'm a lesbian. That's how it starts. Devil start talking to you." &gt;&gt; And what he starts to do is pervert natural feelings. And what he what he did to her, he said to her, he said, "Look, he said, "Look, every time you get in a a court stage with a boy, he ends up leaving you and getting somebody else." See, you're supposed to be with a woman. &gt;&gt; She says, she says, she's telling me this. She said, "Enemy tell her say every relationship never worked out, but every time you get depressed or you go through a relationship and you're all alone, your girlfriends are always there and they're there to love on you." See, you're supposed to be with a woman. I say, "Sis, [Music] &gt;&gt; come on now. &gt;&gt; I was gentle." I said, "Sis, the devil is lying to you." &gt;&gt; I say, "That's what good friends are supposed to do." &gt;&gt; They're supposed to help you come out of your depression. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're supposed to be there when anxiety is ranting and raging. You're not supposed to fall in love with them. &gt;&gt; They're supposed to be there and be a help for you. But let the bigger question is, let me ask you something. Do you want to be married to a man? She says, "Yes." I said, "Well, dig on your answer." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said, "Digle your answer. Satan is lying to you." Amen. Amen. Sisters. Amen. Let me tell you something. Hallelujah. God, he will never be mocked. Amen. He knew right where you wondering if you a woman, am I really a woman in this body? Go in the mirror and look at yourself and answer that own question. &gt;&gt; There's certain things about you that only a woman got. A man ain't got it. if you know what I mean. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God made you that way. Put you in a woman. Uh-oh. Somebody needed that. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Ain't no lesbians in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Ain't no homosexuals in the kingdom of God. [Music] Amen. But sons and daughters, &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. &gt;&gt; And normally when I talk to people who are making that decision, first thing they try to do is you you try to God is love. Yeah, he love. I said, but let me ask you something. Is God all knowing? &gt;&gt; Is God perfect? &gt;&gt; And if they say yes, it's over. &gt;&gt; Because I say, how can a perfect God put the wrong person in the wrong body? &gt;&gt; That mean he's not perfect. &gt;&gt; How can God be perfect? Hallelujah. And make a mistake to put a woman in a man's body. If that's the case, hallelujah, a a a elephant is a lion. [Applause] And this stuff is getting so ridiculous. Hallelujah. In the States, somebody got pulled over and the police are trying to talk to him and the woman say, "I'm a cat. [Applause] You see the enemy always go too far. [Applause] Oh my. Let me get back what I was talking about, honey. But look. Amen. All the brothers didn't went through. Oh my. I'm sorry y'all. I need to bring I need to close this down. &gt;&gt; But look church.

But all the brothers they didn't got rejected. &gt;&gt; Jesse says hey do you got one more? You say God said the son come out of your house. You got another son? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Yeah, man. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I got one, but he a little fanatical. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He don't believe like the rest of us." &gt;&gt; Man, you want me to go get him? Amen. &gt;&gt; Samuel said, "Man, God said &gt;&gt; the next king in your house, &gt;&gt; and I ain't leaving till you go get him. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about what people say. &gt;&gt; If God called you, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He got something for you to do." &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? Amen. &gt;&gt; But look, church, David ain't had time to go get refreshed like everybody else. &gt;&gt; David came fresh from his ministry. &gt;&gt; Stinking, smelling like sheep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't had a chance to wash his clothes, take a bath, none of that. David came straight out of the field stepping under the anointing. Soon as David got there, &gt;&gt; the face started to move. Soon as David got there, the atmosphere started to change. Samuel say, "We got one. We got one. We got one. We got one. We found him. We felt God's anointed &gt;&gt; and David just standing there. &gt;&gt; David got anointed. Went on back to the wilderness. &gt;&gt; He ain't bragged. He ain't talk junk to nobody. He went on back to the wilderness. &gt;&gt; And when he went back, hallelujah, maybe a couple days later, hallelujah, a bear came in. And the bar ain't realized, hallelujah, that there was a different anointing on the shepherd now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody going back home with a different anointing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody going back home with a different anointing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my David, the lion come. David, grab it everybody. I tell you about the get on out of here. &gt;&gt; Take the sheep back. It's time for somebody to take back what God put in your possession. &gt;&gt; Take back what God put in your possession. Church, David, take it back. You know what? He ain't go back and brag to his brother. Ah, boy. The anointing on me, huh? Hey, I'm anointed. I'm fully anointed. David ain't do none of that. David just stayed faithful to what God gave him, church. And then the bear came. Bear stood up on David. David, [Applause] how dare you raise up on me. David whip him up real quick. &gt;&gt; Snatch the lion. Now, these are supernatural events taking place. David snatched it back. David go back and mind his business. &gt;&gt; Now what's happening, honey? &gt;&gt; In David's quiet time, God is giving him testimonies. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Fast forward. &gt;&gt; Fast forward. Now the brothers go off the war. Go off the battle. Now let's keep in mind David is still tending to his business. Amen. &gt;&gt; And look, uh, Jesse tell David, "Hey, I want you to go take your brother some Chipotle." [Applause] &gt;&gt; But if it was my house, go take your brother some Nando. &gt;&gt; They know what I'm talking about. And Nando ain't nothing to play with now. Hallelujah. But church. Hallelujah. He tell David, I'm sorry y'all. I need to cut this off. But David, David, Hallelujah. His daddy tell him say, "Go take your brother some food." They in the army. David say, "Yes, Dad." Okay. David, go get the food. Now, this is the king. &gt;&gt; This is the king still being a servant. [Applause] Oh, &gt;&gt; if that ain't the character of God, I don't know what it is. &gt;&gt; The king himself came down and became a servant to you and I. &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you something. Are you serving? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look, church, what I'm doing right now, I'm a servant. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, I got bills that are jacked up way over my head. I got battles I'm going over. But look, Hallelujah. I have to stand firm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say, "Lord, you you you called me out here to do this, so you got to provide." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to provide, God. And now, Hallelujah. Brother Danny, I'm in a place where I'm believing for big things. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't serve no small God. &gt;&gt; I serve a mighty big God. A very big God. Oh, come on. Come on. I have a God. A very big God. Oh, he's always over. He's always church. &gt;&gt; I'm believing God for big things. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I don't believe Hallelujah. just Hallelujah. speaking those things in my prayer closet.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church, I went to God. I said, "Lord, I'm ready to move. I'm tired of paying rent. I want me another house." Hallelujah. But I said, "Lord, h I don't want just any house." &gt;&gt; Come on now. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't want just any house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't going to describe it to you cuz you might try to copy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then God be saying, "Well, I got to bless him before I bless you." And but I say, "Lord, I don't want just any house, but I want a house." Hallelujah. That I don't owe nobody nothing on. &gt;&gt; That ain't my God. My God is a big God. &gt;&gt; He's a big God. And if he don't do it, if if he can't do it for me, then who? &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't looking to have no monthly payment, no nothing. H &gt;&gt; living in the blessings of God. Holy. &gt;&gt; And see, right now, that's challenging some of y'all faith. &gt;&gt; You sit back thinking, man, I don't need I don't need nothing like that. Well, I got something for you. Who told you that? [Applause] Who told you God couldn't do it? Who told you God couldn't bless you? &gt;&gt; Who told you you couldn't be debtree? &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then he gave me scripture to back it up. Hallelujah. I was reading in I think it was Deuteronomy or Exodus somewhere in there. And the scripture said God said to them, he said, "Hey, hallelujah. You going to live in houses that you didn't build." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You going to have vineyards you didn't plant. &gt;&gt; So you believe what you want to believe. I believe in the word. Oh my. Let me wind this down. Hallelujah. David now he comes with the food. He comes with the food and his brothers are like he come. The Bible says he start talking to his brothers and then he hear something. Bring me a man. No, it wasn't like that. The devil don't come peaceful. He know you've been looking at the wrong thing. He know you doing something wrong. So he loud as can be. &gt;&gt; Bring me a man. &gt;&gt; He been screaming at some of you while you've been here in service. You better not shout, "You know what you did yesterday." &gt;&gt; You better not shout, "You know you got a boyfriend. Please don't turn the blood hound loose. But then church, hallelujah. David talking to his brother here, Goliath. He said, "Hey, hey, who that is? Who that is? What y'all heard about? Who that is?" And Elab says, "David, I know your pride. &gt;&gt; I know you come down here to see the battle." &gt;&gt; Now, let's understand something, Pastor Simon. First of all, Elaz was speaking out of turn &gt;&gt; because unto that moment, &gt;&gt; there was no battle. &gt;&gt; There was no battle. &gt;&gt; Everybody was afraid. &gt;&gt; Was nobody fighting. &gt;&gt; So he's telling Dave like he David like he a big shot. You come down here to see the battle. David should say, "Man, you're a chicken. Ain't none of y'all fighting. Everybody standing on the sideline while this uncircumcised Philistine coming in a message church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Coming in the church of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And y'all won't cast him out. &gt;&gt; And you better set up. &gt;&gt; He said you can David say, "Is there not a cause? &gt;&gt; Is there not a cause? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Basically, David was saying, "If not me, &gt;&gt; then who?" &gt;&gt; Y'all ain't going to fight him. &gt;&gt; If I don't fight him, who going to fight him? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, David started to ask questions. David said, "What's the reward?" See? Hallelujah. David was built different. Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; church. He started asking questions and he didn't stop until he got in front of Goliath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David told everybody if not me. &gt;&gt; Go back and read it. He went to Saul and he said, "Hey, don't let nobody be afraid. &gt;&gt; I'm here." &gt;&gt; When your friends are going through, you need to tell them, "Come over my house. Let's pray." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's fast and pray. Let's get together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's get together and burn this devil up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, &gt;&gt; David. Hallelujah. David went to Psalm said, "Look, let me tell you something." He said, "A bear came." Hallelujah. Now, David begins to tell his testimony. &gt;&gt; This is the reason why you went through all that stuff. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because there was a greater battle. But this battle, hallelujah, was not only going to put you in a certain place, but it was going to deliver everybody else. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If not you, &gt;&gt; then who? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, church, now David says, "Hey, David says, "Hey, I fight him. Don't let nobody don't let nobody's heart melt. Don't let nobody be afraid. I fight them." And here come one of the elders, Saul. you know, they think we're too radical. We don't act like that in Canada. &gt;&gt; He says, "Hey, we don't sing them kind of songs in church." At the cross, at the cross where I first &gt;&gt; I love them songs, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when God start moving, I want to move with him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't afraid to go back where I come from. &gt;&gt; But when Look, church. Oh my. Let me leave that alone cuz some of y'all looking to start a ruckus in church. Brother Dig said, "Ah, don't use my name. Don't put me in. Do what your pastor say. As for me, I'm free." Look church, David talking to Saul. Saul start to lift up the enemy. &gt;&gt; David, you just a youth. &gt;&gt; He been a warrior since he since he been a youth. David said, "Man, I don't want to hear all that." Look here. A lion came, I dealt with him. &gt;&gt; A bear came, I dealt with him. &gt;&gt; And this uncircumcised Philistine gonna be just like that lion and just like that bear. &gt;&gt; Saul's like, "All right." Okay, if that what you want to do, all right, let me dress you up. He put it all on him. He put the anointing on from yesterday year. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what God did in the prophet. You know, he was out there hunting and he shot this and he shot that. Testimonies are yester year. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they good. But what is he doing in your life? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My testimony of this message is what God did in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's a person, a living person. &gt;&gt; He didn't die in 65. He ain't in the rocks in Arizona. He ain't in a grave in Jeffersonville. But he's living in a body of believers. church.

David said, "Man, let me tell you my testimony." David tell him testimony. He want to dress David up with his old experience. David said, "No, man. I'm good. I got my own. &gt;&gt; I got my own. I got my own. God been good to me. &gt;&gt; I got my own." &gt;&gt; Y'all think I'd be talking about a house with no payments. If God hadn't already moved like that before. &gt;&gt; So I stand back and say, "Lord, if not me, then who? &gt;&gt; If you going to bless somebody, if not me, then who? [Music] church. &gt;&gt; David said, "Man, I can't wear all that stuff. I got my own testimony." &gt;&gt; Then Goliath screamed out, "Bring me a B." [Applause] David walk out there. &gt;&gt; Y'all know David had real swagger. Come on. And you told my ri had 500. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Hallelujah. Hey, this how church should be.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said anything. &gt;&gt; I said anything. I said anything. I said anything. I said anything. I said anything. Anything. Anything. Amen. Today, church, David walks out there. He bring me a man. &gt;&gt; David walks out there. I told y'all the other night, God got a sense of humor. &gt;&gt; He said, "Bring me a man." God sent a boy out there. &gt;&gt; What was he What did he do that? Because he knew he was going to expire a prophet for our day to send out a quote that say the weakest Christian on their knees. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can defeat the devil &gt;&gt; anytime. &gt;&gt; Any place, &gt;&gt; anywhere, &gt;&gt; if not me, &gt;&gt; then who? &gt;&gt; David comes out there. Goliath say, "You send me a boy?" He said, "I'mma put him on the edge of my spear and feed him to the birds." And David said, "I'mma cut your head off." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Goliath got all this armor on, all this stuff. Let me tell you something. The devil presents himself like he's untouchable, &gt;&gt; but he is. &gt;&gt; And and in some of y'all lives, he need to be touched this morning. &gt;&gt; He needs to be touched. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you throw it. Let God guide it. Hallelujah. So, hallelujah. When it came time, now David said the mystery behind all that is David was operating under the spoken word. &gt;&gt; David said, "I'm going to cut your head off." And you know what? David didn't have a sword. [Music] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? &gt;&gt; Everybody else was afraid, but David was prophesying the battle. You need to speak over yourself. &gt;&gt; Speak over your life. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil what you want him to do. Guillotine didn't have nothing but a bag with some rocks in it. &gt;&gt; Goliath got all this stuff and he stood out there. The Bible say David ran to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all y'all adults remember we used to watch the Bondic man. [Music] David runs out there. He winds it up. And he says in the name of &gt;&gt; it's over. &gt;&gt; He throws it and then he sayowmen. &gt;&gt; The B the Bible say he fell &gt;&gt; face forward. &gt;&gt; All everybody else in the army watching. Everybody else watching. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Goliath goes down. &gt;&gt; They still afraid cuz they don't know if he going to get up. &gt;&gt; The Bible, this is the part I love. And if y'all don't mind, Hallelujah. If you got a spirit bothering you, I want you to do what David did. &gt;&gt; The Bible say David ran on Goliath and stood on top of him. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Somebody need to stand on top of their devil this morning. [Applause] Stand on top of your enemy. I said stand on top of your devil. Stand on top of your prophet. Stand on top of you. &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? &gt;&gt; Stand up. &gt;&gt; I said stand up. David stood on top of him. David took the enemy own sword &gt;&gt; cuz he said he was going to cut his head off. David took what the devil been doing to bother everybody else. Took it out and cut his head off. &gt;&gt; You need to cut your Goliath head off again. If not me, then who? [Applause] And once David cut his head off, everybody that was afraid, they got courage. Hallelujah. And because of David, everybody else drew faith and they [Applause] because of you. &gt;&gt; I said because of you. I said because of you, &gt;&gt; your church is going to be better. &gt;&gt; Because of you, &gt;&gt; the worship is going to be better. &gt;&gt; Because of you, demons are going to be cast out. &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? If not me, then who? If not me, then who? [Applause] [Music] David cut his head off when everybody rushed the fight. &gt;&gt; David took the head of Goliath and put it in a bag. Hallelujah. And I can imagine Pastor Nelson, Amen. You know the devil don't like to give up. He don't like to be defeated. So David, Hallelujah, went to the next battle. Hallelujah. When you get the Holy Ghost, that's when you really begin to fight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what you need to do is, hallelujah, like David, David, hallelujah, went to the next battle. Amen. He looked at the the Philistines. Hallelujah. He said, now he got sarcastic like Goliath. He said, "Hey, ain't no need for y'all to die." &gt;&gt; He said, "But if y'all want to fight, let me show you something. I want everybody to hold their hand up. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold your Goliath up. Hold your testimony up. &gt;&gt; Hold your testimony up. &gt;&gt; I want you to hold your testimony high. Hold your victory high. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hold your victory high. If not me, then who? [Music] When they saw the head of their champion, everybody started to run. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "Hallelujah." He said, "Hey, remember the maniac? The maniac that fell before his feet." Hallelujah. The prophet of God said in that moment, the devil challenged God. He said, "And when you see the chief enemy, the chief spirit go down," he said, "then everybody can have what they ask God for." [Applause] &gt;&gt; If not me, &gt;&gt; then who? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you a testimony. I'm going close, church. I was in another part of Canada doing a youth meeting like this couple years back and the Holy Spirit was moving. Hallelujah. And it was such a powerful atmosphere like it is right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To at the end of that service, one sister jumped up and just started worshiping and it went through the church like a whirlwind. young people. And we sat in there and worshiped, called out on God, spoke in tongues, prophet, I mean, everything was moving. Hallelujah. For about an hour and a half. Hallelujah. That same spirit is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to manufacture anything. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the natural eye can't see. &gt;&gt; Angels are in this room. &gt;&gt; And if angels are here, God is here. church. Hallelujah. So, uh, it was a young man, hallelujah, streaming the services in China. In China, he was watching the service. He wanted to be there so bad, but he was watching it. Church, after that meeting, he got inspired. He went on the street corner and started preaching. &gt;&gt; What you going to do when you leave the meeting? But then he went on the street corner and started preaching. Hallelujah. He said, "And as he started preaching, 20 people came." He kept going. At that time, it was illegal to preach on the street. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or have a religious gathering. Hallelujah. With more than certain amount of people. Hallelujah. But he kept preaching. He couldn't stop. 20 turn into 30. 30 turn into 50. 50 turn into 60. 60 turned into 100. He said he couldn't stop. He kept preaching. Hallelujah. And he wasn't even in the service. &gt;&gt; He kept going. He said by the time he looked up, it probably was about 150 people on the street corner listening to the word of God worshiping. Hallelujah. And at that time, hallelujah, he was thinking, I need to stop before the police come. But he couldn't stop. What was happening? If not you, &gt;&gt; then who? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church, God was using him. And he kept preaching. All those people out there that was worshiping and and just having such a experience with God because a young man was inspired by a youth service he saw online. church. And by that time, the police came in two cars. He said at that time he was preaching about the baptism. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Water baptism. Hallelujah. And he was preaching about hallelujah repentance and giving your life. As the police were coming up, they were hearing him talking about giving your life. He was looking at him come, but he couldn't stop. Hallelujah. God was taking over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God was taking over. &gt;&gt; If God call you, he will make sure you're fully equipped, &gt;&gt; church. And he kept going. Hallelujah. And then the police comes up in the moment where he's talking about Hallelujah. being baptized. And he said, he said, "Who want to be baptized?" Six people raised their hand, but it was also a seventh person. And the seventh person was a female police officer. the police officer who came there to arrest him, she got saved &gt;&gt; and they said, "Hey, we need to go someplace, get to the water, get baptized, but how we going to get there?" Both police officers with their cars, they say, "Hey, everybody get in our cars. [Applause] If not you, then who? &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? &gt;&gt; Church, between the two police cars, they put all seven people in those cars, went down to the lake and got baptized. In my closing, I was in Florida preaching in a service. Hallelujah. They were going to have a homegoing service for one of the saints after that service. And this particular person who was going on to their reward, his family was in church and they wasn't believers. Hallelujah. But they came to church that morning. Remember I said to you, you being here today is not a coincidence. &gt;&gt; And you might think, man, this is a long service. Not according to God, [Music] &gt;&gt; church. Hallelujah. So, I was preaching. I saw a young sister. Hallelujah. Although she wasn't a sister at that time, she was sitting on the front row and she couldn't take her eyes off me. She follow me left and right. left and right. She had a nose piercing, &gt;&gt; a eye piercing, her ears piercing, and probably any other kind of piercing you can name. Hallelujah. She had tattoos on her neck, tattoos on her arms and everything. But in that moment, she was following the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you know what I did? I started preaching to her. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I forgot about everybody else. &gt;&gt; I say, "Hey, it's just me and you." Hallelujah. You know that you are a child of God. You know that you're here for a purpose. That God wants you, hallelujah, to fall into your position. And the more I preach, the more she opened up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The more I preach, she realized that she was that woman at the well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. church. She came in the prayer line and she said, "You know what? I want to give my life to the Lord." &gt;&gt; I want to get baptized. Hallelujah. That's why yesterday I said, "There's a baptism coming." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And it's more than one person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, we went outside. The pastor got in the water. Hallelujah. They had their pool outside. The sister said, "Hey," she had on pants. Hallelujah. Earrings. The whole nine yards. She say, "You know what? I ain't waiting on a a a change of clothes. I'm ready to get in the water right now." &gt;&gt; If not you, &gt;&gt; then who church? Hallelujah. She took her sandals off, walked right down in that water. Hallelujah. Tattoos, pierces, everything. Hallelujah. Got baptized, came back out raising her hands, giving God praise. Hallelujah. One of her family members saw that. They say, "I want to get baptized." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The next one, Hallelujah. The next one say, "Hey, I don't need no clothes either." Went down straight in the water. Hallelujah. Came back out worshiping God. Another family member say, "Hey, I want to get baptized." And they went down in the water. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And she came out raising her hands. Another one saw that. Hey, I want to get baptized. &gt;&gt; By the time God was finished, &gt;&gt; seven to nine people got baptized that day. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because one person was obedient. &gt;&gt; Come musicians. Don't let this just be a good meeting, &gt;&gt; but let it be a transformation of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let this be an experience that the devil can't take from you. &gt;&gt; Cuz once you learn how to ride a bike, you never lose it. &gt;&gt; That revelation will go with you when you in Russia, you can ride a bike. &gt;&gt; When you in Germany, you can ride a bike. &gt;&gt; When you in Australia, you can ride a bike. Hallelujah. This is a divine appointment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we not going to drag it out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because there's there are souls &gt;&gt; that are being given to God today. &gt;&gt; The question is, are you one of those souls? &gt;&gt; Will you go back? How did David defeat Goliath? Not by his strength, &gt;&gt; by his testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you one of those young people been in church all your life and hadn't given your life to God? Hallelujah. Don't let this moment pass you by. &gt;&gt; As we prepare to turn the service over to brother Danny. Hallelujah. There was a lot said today, but this is the question. If not you, &gt;&gt; talk to me, church. &gt;&gt; If not you, &gt;&gt; then who? Let's make it personal. If not me, &gt;&gt; then who? &gt;&gt; We give you all the gloryy.

She was born in this church, but yet there's a time and there's a season for everything, Lord. and she's come to realize if not me then who? Lord, thank you for Sarah and Satan. You've heard her confession. Your power is broken. Your influence from this day shattered by the word of God that's been spoken. And in front of many witnesses, you are defeated in the name of Jesus Christ. Sarah hope according to your confession. I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

I trust that everybody has been immensely blessed and they've taken advantage of his presence in the services and have allowed him to have absolute preeminence in whatever situation he would have brought. your condition and your situation, whatever it is that's blocking that perfect walk with God. Not perfect life. We're not looking for a perfect life. He's the only perfect life. But a walk where you can walk with God and and that power of condemnation that that tries to that demon of condemnation that constantly comes and whacks you down every time you start to feel good. You should be free of all of that. You should you should have come to a place through this weekend's teaching on the word and and and moments of deliverance and opportunity to just say, "Lord, I surrender." Amen. Praise God. I trust that you've drawn from this weekend immensely in the way that we have. I've been immensely blessed by the word of God. I thank God for a wonderful gift in our precious brother Kyrie. We are so blessed. Amen. May God continue to bless you, brother and prosper you and meet every desire of your heart. This bride is going to leave with great substance. And the revelation has to come upon her to receive it, to accept it, and to believe it. If not me, then who? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You noticed the Lord led me yesterday when he was preaching on that seed and he kept looking at that seed and the Holy Spirit was telling me, "Go and get two peaches." I said, "Should I get three?" He said, "Two peaches." I said, "I'll go get two peaches." And I brought him and I put him here and I said, "Brother, God's doing something. Maybe maybe there's going to be some fruit from this weekend. Praise God. We had two baptisms. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God's word will never ever return unto him void. Never. He'll honor his word above everything. And that's why when you receive the Holy Ghost, it's the word. It's actually the purpose and the nature of God coming into your life so that he can fulfill his purpose and then everything in your life. That's why you wonder why this time. Why now? Because it was your time. It was your time now to to manifest his word, his portion, his purpose in you. And everything that's not of him that's in your life, he just pushes it out. He says, "Now I'm in control. I take possession. I have spoken it. I will perform it. Say the Lord." Amen. Praise God. So, so, so we're under great expectation for our young people. I believe there was a lot of lives that were changed this weekend. It'll come. It'll manifest. God will vindicate because he's his own interpreter. Amen. Praise God. At this time, I'm bringing this service to a close. We are going to be having some refreshments outside. We're going to pray. We're going to ask the Lord to just bless and continue. Listen, this anointing is all over. It's people walking by must be feeling it. because it's it's all over. It's all over. Stay in it. Keep your fellowship. Keep your desire for God. Share with one another as you break bread together and rejoice in his wonderful presence. Let us pray. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, what can we say? You've done it again. You've orchestrated it right from the very beginning, right to the very end. Lord, there's nothing that that that we can say that, oh, well, we did this, we did that, Lord.
