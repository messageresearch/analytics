[39:53] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[39:56] heaven
[39:57] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[40:01] husband

[40:06] saying
[40:07] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[40:13] he will dwell with them
[40:16] and they shall be his people and God
[40:20] himself shall be with them and be their

[40:27] eyes and there shall be no more death
[40:30] need a sorrow nor crying neither shall
[40:34] there be any more pain for the former
[40:37] things are passed away and he that set

[41:40] I was about to just leave and come do
[41:43] what I had in mind but
[41:46] um with with it this unfinished and
[41:48] anything else just the thought Holy
[41:52] Spirit brought me right back to this
[41:54] saying
[41:57] um that it's a new day it's a new every
[42:00] morning we wake up it's a new day and we
[42:03] have just woke out of our amnesiac sleep
[42:07] that we were all in we just woke up out
[42:10] of that and when we woke up it's a new
[42:14] day the the word of God brought us awake
[42:18] and made us all alive to the fact that
[42:22] we are walking in a new day it's a new
[42:26] morning it's Daybreak that's why he's
[42:29] called the day star and I'm glad for
[42:32] that and it became a new day from the
[42:35] time uh brother Branham said it is the
[42:39] rising of the the sun s-o-n praise God
[42:44] the son was now rising to shine upon us
[42:47] that we might all come to life and fully
[42:51] recognize who we are and what we are a
[42:55] purpose on Earth what we are supposed to
[42:58] do for his glory and for his honor
[43:01] praise the Lord amen I I want to let you

[44:18] every everything comes to this time when
[44:22] it's a new day for us and it's with
[44:26] unlimited possibilities
[44:29] that a day with unlimited possibilities
[44:33] where now God is looking for us to walk
[44:37] out with con confidence and faith in his
[44:41] word
[44:42] because we have to make this word live
[44:46] again
[44:48] Hallelujah because we we have had the
[44:52] season we're talking about the word
[44:54] bringing forth the word but the word
[44:57] wants to show himself alive
[45:00] that he is alive and he is among us and
[45:04] that he is walking with us praise God he
[45:07] is ready showed to us it's not by your
[45:10] works it's not by your human Faith it's
[45:14] going to move God and make him do things
[45:17] but the faith that he is talking about
[45:20] is having perfect faith in receiving and
[45:25] believing his word and that allows him
[45:28] to move Among Us spontaneously
[45:32] and to bring about any of his signs
[45:36] wonders Miracles healings Revelations
[45:39] whatever he wants to do he now has that
[45:42] opportunity because the bride has
[45:45] accepted the uh the the wonderful choice
[45:49] that he made for us amen when we place

[46:10] alive and more so that we recognize what
[46:14] we are looking at in this day praise the
[46:17] Lord it is morning in my heart is not
[46:21] what the old song says it is morning in

[46:27] Shadows depart all the ghosts of your
[46:31] past all the hounds of Hell amen God has
[46:36] caused them to depart and now we can
[46:40] walk into this new day and this new age
[46:43] that he has given to us trials
[46:47] yes they're behind us not that you may
[46:51] not still have them but you're having
[46:53] them now in a different light
[46:56] because back over here when you had
[46:59] those trials those trials were like a
[47:02] burden but now when the Trials come you
[47:05] recognize that's only a test whatever
[47:08] trial whatever suffering it's only a
[47:11] test to bring you through for the glory
[47:14] of God amen hallelujah amen glory to God
[47:19] now I want you to know that for Israel
[47:24] and for the whole world
[47:28] and with its intricate and interwoven
[47:32] systems and patterns because that's how
[47:36] the world operates the world operates my
[47:39] education and operates by systems it
[47:42] operates by patterns and stuff like that
[47:45] and if any of those patterns are broken
[47:48] then it can't function like it really
[47:50] should you you saw the little
[47:53] um startup today about them talking
[47:56] about the bank in California and if the
[47:59] banking system doesn't work according to
[48:02] this system that they have set up then
[48:05] it shows every single thing out because
[48:07] they operate by systems uh well God
[48:11] operates my system too but not that kind
[48:13] of system because that system uh is one
[48:18] set up by Satan
[48:20] and Satan's system feeds on itself I
[48:24] think brother Branham is the term that
[48:25] eats its he eats his own right so it
[48:29] feeds on itself so when you look at the
[48:33] what the world is today it's actually
[48:36] like uh in the age of cancer where this
[48:40] this each cell is trying to eat the
[48:42] other cell and uh you know like uh folks
[48:46] they're dishonest they're lying they're
[48:49] cheating and everything and that's
[48:51] Satan's work and his work and his mind
[48:54] operating through people to see how much
[48:57] they can take away from this other cell
[48:59] how much they can rob that other cell
[49:02] how much they can cheat the other one
[49:04] and how much they can even kill the
[49:06] other one they don't really care about
[49:08] that as long as they survive why it's
[49:12] the system it's not even the people oh
[49:16] my yes
[49:18] Satan is way of plotting planning
[49:22] scheming and thinking to try to over
[49:24] throw God's kingdom he just brought that
[49:28] down to earth
[49:29] and setting up these systems under
[49:33] various names what do you call it a
[49:35] church where you call it a corporation
[49:37] when you call whatever you call it is
[49:40] the same thing that he's setting up that
[49:43] he had in his mind and it all works by
[49:46] him with his rumors with his suggestions
[49:50] with his lies and with his mental and
[49:54] spiritual poisoning of the mind that
[49:58] that he is doing right now in this day
[50:01] and age in which we are living in and so
[50:04] by education he's done that poison the
[50:07] minds of uh the the world literally and
[50:11] for those a few of us that God has
[50:14] brought out of that system we have
[50:17] unloaded a lot of those poisons that we
[50:21] have received in our hearts and in our
[50:23] minds and we rely completely now upon
[50:29] the word of God hallelujah amen yes so
[50:34] that's that's the way Israel operates it
[50:38] operates that way under regimentation it
[50:43] operates that way because that's the way
[50:45] that uh Israel always operated since the
[50:49] time of Moses they got to have systems
[50:52] and they got to work through those
[50:54] systems whether by a rabbi whether by a
[50:57] general whether by whatever they're
[51:00] working through those systems and by
[51:03] working through those systems uh Satan
[51:06] create the atmosphere to let you think
[51:09] that he is all seeing and that he is
[51:12] all-knowing but it's not all seeing it's
[51:14] not all-knowing he set up his system so
[51:18] if something happens in another part of
[51:19] the world his demons are traveling
[51:22] everywhere and they are messengers back
[51:25] and forth so he will become aware of
[51:28] what is going on uh regardless of which
[51:31] part of the world he is let me give you
[51:33] an example
[51:35] this is a strange show I'm talking
[51:37] tonight but
[51:39] um when I was young casting out the
[51:41] devil and
[51:43] um suddenly he stopped and saying hey oh
[51:46] you believe I'm a devil but I'm not a
[51:48] devil because you know just like talking
[51:50] about uh brother Branham just the same
[51:53] way you know I also know this so I know
[51:57] that I know that and so he says now look
[52:00] outside not right now
[52:02] there's a woman passing she has this
[52:04] color dress and this and that and the
[52:06] other she's this that that that
[52:09] we look out there there's a woman
[52:12] he says now
[52:15] um look at the clock the clock says this
[52:17] this is the time
[52:19] he says watch the fairy is now coming
[52:21] he's in a closed in room can't see out
[52:26] the fairy is now crossing the river this
[52:29] was a huge house so we were on we were
[52:31] in one of the top rooms of it
[52:34] um and you look out and there is the
[52:37] ferry coming across the river
[52:40] see those so-called lying signs and
[52:45] wonders were supposed to convince us
[52:48] that he was God
[52:51] and that he was the one doing that
[52:54] because that's also what brother Branham
[52:57] did amen but we didn't were not confused
[53:02] by that because under the inspiration of
[53:06] the Holy Spirit we already knew it was
[53:09] the devil to begin with so it can't
[53:11] change all of a sudden and turn from a
[53:14] devil to be in God we were still lying
[53:16] amen oh my praise God now of course you
[53:22] see that's where witches and wizards
[53:24] come in and that's where they will speak
[53:26] things brother Branham says they are
[53:28] gifted but they turn the gift towards
[53:31] the devil's side and by using those
[53:34] things they can tell the people partial
[53:37] truth
[53:38] they don't have all the truth but they
[53:40] can tell them partial truth and some of
[53:42] those people will be convinced and it
[53:45] can turn them away from God but for us
[53:48] we know we had a god-sent prophet
[53:53] we know the ministry was absolutely
[53:56] proven by God
[53:58] and we behold we believe that the
[54:01] Dynamics of an an actions of the true
[54:06] church
[54:06] is is moving into a new Direction
[54:09] totally different
[54:11] uh right now we still mixed in
[54:14] but uh it's moving in another Direction
[54:17] where God is going to start making
[54:20] things clear of who is in the Church the
[54:24] true bride or church I've used both
[54:27] simultaneously they're not the same but
[54:29] you understand what I'm saying that he
[54:32] wants to make it clear of who is his
[54:35] elected
[54:38] bearing in mind being elected and being
[54:42] Not Elected doesn't mean the person may
[54:46] not be saved
[54:48] you get me there
[54:49] that doesn't mean that the person may
[54:51] not be saved it just means that they're
[54:53] not in the bride
[54:56] they're not in the bride class of saints
[54:59] but they can be servants
[55:02] they can be whatever else God I don't
[55:06] know what are the duties in the Kingdom
[55:08] of Heaven but they will be doing
[55:09] something else praise God but uh those
[55:13] elected to be in the bright class you
[55:17] see I were going to have to go into the
[55:19] book of life and that sort of stuff but
[55:22] the fact is that the bride in her
[55:25] position
[55:26] is totally different
[55:29] separate from that and all these other
[55:33] categories they will turn around and be
[55:37] servants towards the bride 144
[55:41] 000 even those that maybe have been good
[55:44] to the bride while going to church while
[55:48] in churches and doing that but God is
[55:51] the one who decides who is going to be
[55:55] who is his own and who is not his own he
[55:58] alone knows that and that's why we are
[56:01] we don't judge those things but we rest
[56:03] completely upon the word of God Amen
[56:06] praise God it's a new day I believe it
[56:10] it's a new day and a new hour for any
[56:14] one of us to start over
[56:17] regardless of who we are we can start
[56:20] over
[56:21] and let God have his way praise God and
[56:24] now when you build you know you are
[56:27] building on a sure Foundation you know
[56:31] you're building on the true foundation
[56:33] You Know You're Building upon the word
[56:36] of God we have left all the turbulence
[56:40] and we are leaving all the turbulence of
[56:43] the ages past
[56:45] and we are stepping out into uh a new
[56:50] realm a new day we step stepping out on
[56:53] something which like he said to Joshua
[56:56] just follow me you have not passed this
[56:59] way before
[57:01] you haven't passed this way you you
[57:03] don't know really where you're going you
[57:05] just know the end point is Canon but in
[57:08] between you don't know but just follow
[57:10] me for you have not passed this way
[57:13] before and I say the same thing to you
[57:16] you unto myself you have not passed this
[57:19] way before
[57:21] and we are broke into a realm where we
[57:24] have no experience of it we don't know
[57:28] uh where it will turn us this way or
[57:31] turn us that way but one thing we know
[57:33] is that we are headed right into the
[57:36] kingdom of God and to be there on the
[57:39] throne of God right beside him bringing
[57:43] glory to His Marvelous and wonderful
[57:46] name praise God hallelujah friends we
[57:50] are now in the day of the changing of
[57:53] another dispensation
[57:56] we have come out of the dispensations
[57:59] that have passed and now we see a
[58:03] dispensation is just about to change and
[58:06] when I say just about the changes I've
[58:08] taught many times it doesn't change on a
[58:11] day it's already started changing right
[58:13] it's already started changing but then
[58:16] you your formally announced that it's
[58:19] changed when it comes to its apex when
[58:22] it comes to the peak of it you you
[58:25] announce that it's changed right but
[58:28] it's changing already and we've seen it
[58:31] going on right now we see how uh China
[58:36] is aligning itself with Russia we know
[58:41] the scriptures are ready foretold these
[58:43] things how that the Russian bear and the
[58:47] dragon are going to come down upon
[58:49] Israel it's written in the word of God
[58:53] and it must come to pass and we know
[58:56] that what's happening now they're lining
[58:59] themselves up in that way now Israel at
[59:02] the same time having their great their
[59:07] president uh Netanyahu praise God
[59:10] nothing but another Nathan so we see all
[59:14] of this taking place and what your
[59:17] spiritual mind watching uh Los Angeles
[59:21] California
[59:22] with your spiritual mind watching like
[59:26] the announced today America discovers
[59:29] that they have uh Alzheimer's to such a
[59:33] great degree they're gonna have to start
[59:35] to spend like 300 billion dollars cause
[59:39] people's minds are just leaving them
[59:43] people's minds are leaving them mental
[59:47] uh problems has descended upon the
[59:51] nation and so they're going to have to
[59:54] spend hundreds and hundreds of billion
[59:56] to try to solve that now God is going to
[1:00:01] prove to them money is not going to
[1:00:03] solve all the problems it doesn't matter
[1:00:06] how many trillions you throw of it it's
[1:00:08] not going to solve the problems you may
[1:00:11] hold it back a while but you can't stop
[1:00:14] God's pattern on God's plan and if
[1:00:18] prophecy says the entire world will go
[1:00:21] insane then the world will go insane
[1:00:25] Hallelujah and uh when the insane ones
[1:00:30] which I believe they already are in are
[1:00:34] in the majority
[1:00:35] you who believe you are saying you and I
[1:00:39] will be counted as the ones that are
[1:00:42] insane
[1:00:43] my when you see the court system
[1:00:47] and the way that is going right is wrong
[1:00:51] and wrong is right
[1:00:53] lies are the truth and truths are
[1:00:57] becoming lies
[1:00:58] just imagine the whole thing is turning
[1:01:02] upside down it's a topsy-turvy and it's
[1:01:07] turning upside down praise the name of
[1:01:10] the Lord amen yes sir so we want to
[1:01:13] thank God that he has made us aware of
[1:01:16] these things we know that this The
[1:01:20] Sensation that is changing which is well
[1:01:23] known to us it's now moving back from
[1:01:27] the Gentiles and right back over to the
[1:01:30] Jews
[1:01:32] now there's lots of arguments people
[1:01:34] want to get into well who is the Jew uh
[1:01:37] are all the people in Israel Jews uh um
[1:01:40] how do we know that they are Jews and
[1:01:43] there's lots of things that means that's
[1:01:46] not our business
[1:01:48] we don't care about anything like that
[1:01:50] all we know is that this power that was
[1:01:55] in the prophet with the prophet is
[1:01:57] wisdom and this Revelation that was in
[1:02:00] him is now going back to the Jews
[1:02:03] and God knows his own because the
[1:02:06] prophet says even they don't know what
[1:02:08] tribe they come from
[1:02:10] even though they don't know their real
[1:02:13] Origins it will take the two witnesses
[1:02:17] to come back and preach the word of God
[1:02:19] to them for them to begin to recognize
[1:02:22] where they really descended from where
[1:02:26] they came from amen praise God because
[1:02:29] remember there's going to be a lot of
[1:02:30] false Jews like you got false Christians
[1:02:32] that's why the Bible already says I'm
[1:02:35] going to say they're Jews when you're
[1:02:37] not right because you're not really a
[1:02:40] Jew you think you are but you're not
[1:02:41] it's the holy spirit will have to prove
[1:02:44] whether you are a Jew or you are not a
[1:02:47] Jew and that is all on the line now as
[1:02:51] it changes back from the Gentiles to the
[1:02:55] Jews for Paul made it clear that they
[1:02:59] were blinded for our sake
[1:03:02] God blinded them for our sake and they
[1:03:06] could not see they couldn't see when
[1:03:09] Jesus came that he was the Messiah and
[1:03:12] that he was the real lamb not the
[1:03:15] substitutionary lamb that they used to
[1:03:18] offer in the old Temple but the the lamb
[1:03:21] is a person and the person was Jesus
[1:03:23] Christ and he was to blameless lemon is
[1:03:27] the blameless lamb that offered his life
[1:03:30] for many amen praise the Lord and so
[1:03:34] they were blinded for our sakes Paul
[1:03:37] lightens us that they come from the
[1:03:40] original tree but we as Gentiles are
[1:03:44] grafted in
[1:03:46] amen we have grafted in that's how Paul
[1:03:50] describes it but you see we who
[1:03:53] understand it knows he's talking
[1:03:55] according to the flesh you grafted in
[1:03:58] but spiritually The Original Seed of God
[1:04:02] they're not grafted in they come
[1:04:05] originally from God the tree of life we
[1:04:08] descend right from the tree of life and
[1:04:11] that's why we are here tonight giving
[1:04:13] glory and praise the oak of the Lord God
[1:04:17] hallelujah but God promised to Israel uh
[1:04:22] praise God I did not put the exact
[1:04:24] scripture down here
[1:04:27] um where you can find it but you just
[1:04:28] look your concordance where God says you
[1:04:32] go I'm going to bury you among the
[1:04:34] Nations
[1:04:36] and when you are buried among the
[1:04:38] Nations swallowed up by the Nations
[1:04:40] behold I shall open up your Graves and
[1:04:44] I'll bring you out
[1:04:46] amen I'll open up the graves and I'll
[1:04:49] bring you out to the graves where you
[1:04:51] were buried well all the Holocaust and
[1:04:55] all of the things that they had to go
[1:04:57] through you you can see clearly that's
[1:05:00] like the whole nation was being buried
[1:05:03] God allowed them to be buried burnt
[1:05:07] chemicals everything else some of them
[1:05:09] their bodies were melted down to get the
[1:05:12] fat to make soap so they can use that
[1:05:16] for my goodness they're in every form
[1:05:19] and in shape there were buried among the
[1:05:22] Nations but God said that's only for a
[1:05:26] time for behold I'll open up your Graves
[1:05:29] and I'll bring you out of your Graves
[1:05:31] and bring you back to the land amen
[1:05:34] praise God and I thank God so that my
[1:05:38] eyes have witness you might have heard
[1:05:40] but I literally witnessed it they have
[1:05:43] returned to the land and they are in
[1:05:46] land right now praise God hallelujah
[1:05:49] they're in the land right now so what
[1:05:52] are we experiencing then if
[1:05:56] I bring you all to your Graves and I'll
[1:05:59] bring you back to your land he's
[1:06:01] literally speaking that he is bringing
[1:06:04] us to see there is a resurrection of
[1:06:08] Israel
[1:06:09] the resurrection of Israel not the
[1:06:12] resurrection of Jesus Christ but a
[1:06:16] Revival that goes for the whole nation
[1:06:19] amen is what's fixing to take place
[1:06:23] under the ministries of the two
[1:06:27] witnesses which is Moses and Elijah for
[1:06:32] Moses is the chief uh Prophet amen the
[1:06:37] chief law giver and Elijah is the chief
[1:06:40] Prophet if they believe nobody else
[1:06:43] they'll believe Moses if they believe no
[1:06:46] Prophet they'll believe Elijah because
[1:06:48] they always have a seat waiting for his
[1:06:51] return they know he's coming back and so
[1:06:55] they always have a seat for his return
[1:06:59] when he comes they even put a meal there
[1:07:02] waiting for him when he returns and it's
[1:07:06] going to happen but not the way they're
[1:07:08] thinking about it because is not going
[1:07:10] to go to Every House like Father
[1:07:12] Christmas or an old Nick amen but the
[1:07:16] Bible says that they're going to be
[1:07:18] killed in the streets for the testimony
[1:07:20] of the word of God and of Jesus Christ
[1:07:22] which means they are going to preach
[1:07:25] that Jesus Christ is the messiah
[1:07:28] they're going to preach that Jesus
[1:07:29] Christ is and was the Messiah and that
[1:07:33] they they killed them because they were
[1:07:36] blinded and that is why the scripture
[1:07:39] says in that day you will say how is it
[1:07:43] where you got these wounds where did you
[1:07:46] get these holes in your hands I got them
[1:07:49] in the house of my friends amen the
[1:07:52] Bible says and they will weep and mourn
[1:07:56] afore they recognize what they've done
[1:07:59] right now they say we didn't do it
[1:08:04] we never crucified them
[1:08:07] the Romans did it but the fact is you
[1:08:11] know the scripture tells you they stand
[1:08:13] behind the scenes and the religious
[1:08:16] powers influence
[1:08:19] the federal powers to commit the ACT
[1:08:23] right and this brother Brown said that's
[1:08:26] what's going to happen with the bride of
[1:08:27] course same thing is going to happen the
[1:08:30] the religious power will get behind the
[1:08:33] federal powers and incite them to come
[1:08:36] to persecute the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:39] they will get behind all use all the
[1:08:43] federal powers like like like cats
[1:08:46] having his hand in the glove until he's
[1:08:48] ready to let the claws come out and grab
[1:08:52] a hold of you is exactly what is going
[1:08:55] on right now praise the name of the Lord
[1:08:57] hallelujah and this great uh this great
[1:09:01] transformation
[1:09:03] or this great dispensational change
[1:09:07] which is now taking place it actually
[1:09:10] already started from since the
[1:09:14] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:16] and the word started to be preached uh
[1:09:20] in uh in its stages right through the
[1:09:24] church ages is their eyes opening up
[1:09:26] more and more our eyes are opened up to
[1:09:29] the fullness of the word but spiritually
[1:09:31] the whole nation isn't woke up and it's
[1:09:34] waking up because of that that great uh
[1:09:38] transformation taking place from your
[1:09:43] Resurrection right on to the Rapture
[1:09:46] blessed be the name of the Lord praise
[1:09:49] God may the Lord bless you all here
[1:09:51] tonight
[1:09:52] and I pray that in your life
[1:09:55] my life
[1:09:57] the life of this church that God will
[1:10:00] show us what he means by making all
[1:10:03] things new praise the Lord Of course
[1:10:05] that means you're going to have a new
[1:10:07] pastor
[1:10:10] that means you're going to have a new
[1:10:12] way of doing things
[1:10:14] that of course means also that God is
[1:10:18] going to move the church into a new
[1:10:20] realm praise the Lord because I can see
[1:10:23] that doesn't take much for me to see
[1:10:26] that that the the church will move into
[1:10:28] a new realm and whoever God puts here
[1:10:31] God has plans for them because remember
[1:10:36] we all are not called to do the same
[1:10:39] thing
[1:10:40] and it doesn't matter it'll use the
[1:10:44] other person whoever that person is to
[1:10:47] do his will and bring about it with the
[1:10:51] word in the word but differently because
[1:10:53] we built differently and God does it
[1:10:56] that way that's the way he does it to
[1:10:58] accomplish his own goals now those
[1:11:02] persons or person may not even know who
[1:11:05] have God has in this mind what is God's
[1:11:08] plans and the plans will then begin to
[1:11:11] unfold until one day there is oh now I
[1:11:16] see amen and get a sense of direction
[1:11:19] not a general sense of direction but a
[1:11:22] specific sense of direction for the
[1:11:25] glory of God Amen Lord bless you all
[1:11:29] real good and I believe that this is
[1:11:32] surely coming to pass because God will
[1:11:35] make all things new for his glory praise
[1:11:39] the Lord O my
[1:11:41] praise God
[1:11:43] I left the other page at home
[1:11:46] I tore it out of the notebook I was
[1:11:48] writing on and I left the other page at
[1:11:50] home that's why I look to see whatever
[1:11:52] else I had here so praise God now just
[1:11:55] quickly I'll show you some photographs
[1:11:59] afterwards but Antigo is wonderful
[1:12:03] and uh the island is is a small island
[1:12:07] it is not as a big city like us Jamaica
[1:12:12] but it's a very small island you can
[1:12:15] actually drive around the entire Island
[1:12:20] in one day
[1:12:22] you can drive around the entire Island
[1:12:24] but we didn't do that because you're
[1:12:27] stopping to see various sites and then
[1:12:30] you'll have to do it again so we'll have
[1:12:34] to go back to see the other sites and uh
[1:12:38] it but it's beautiful countryside
[1:12:41] it's wonderful simple people
[1:12:44] but simple people with a high degree of
[1:12:49] um
[1:12:50] what should I say
[1:12:53] a high degree of intelligence even but
[1:12:56] they just have this appearance of being
[1:13:00] ordinary and and simple
[1:13:03] like that you wouldn't tell you wouldn't
[1:13:06] know all right and uh they live very
[1:13:09] simply you don't see any reason to have
[1:13:13] to you know show anything whether it's
[1:13:17] wealth whether it's powerful they don't
[1:13:19] see any need to do that so they just go
[1:13:22] around normally we met brother shibaba
[1:13:25] there of course he's professor in the
[1:13:27] University most everybody knows him not
[1:13:29] on the whole island they don't know him
[1:13:31] but in the major city and stuff the
[1:13:33] people know him and
[1:13:36] um uh the university there oh by the way
[1:13:40] I thought it was one but it's not one
[1:13:42] University it's about two or three but
[1:13:45] the one that he's teaching in
[1:13:48] um or professor over is the
[1:13:51] International
[1:13:52] University where students come from the
[1:13:56] United States come from Canada Australia
[1:13:59] England different parts of the world but
[1:14:03] whichever country and they go there to
[1:14:06] study to uh receive the their doctor's
[1:14:10] degrees and to be taught praise the Lord
[1:14:14] so that's where he is and he was very
[1:14:17] happy of course to see us and happy to
[1:14:20] find out where the church is at
[1:14:23] and even he came to church but he came
[1:14:29] just when it ended
[1:14:30] because he didn't know the way and it's
[1:14:34] the first time he was coming so he's
[1:14:36] kind of mixed up but he got there just
[1:14:39] as it ended and we stood outside having
[1:14:42] fellowship with him and married Therese
[1:14:46] had gone over there
[1:14:49] and actually she came back just this
[1:14:52] Monday and
[1:14:54] um we stood outside and we had Great
[1:14:56] Fellowship and we give God the praise
[1:14:59] and he was so excited because only the
[1:15:03] final the pastor is a the pastor is a
[1:15:08] pastor and a little businessman
[1:15:12] um and there it is that the he did not
[1:15:16] know that a supermarket that all the
[1:15:19] students loved and always loved to go to
[1:15:22] belongs to the pastor and that the
[1:15:25] pastor and his wife are usually there in
[1:15:28] that Supermarket during the day and he
[1:15:31] says that is only like a 10 minutes walk
[1:15:33] from my house and you were there all the
[1:15:36] time I hear them talking about the
[1:15:38] supermarket and everything else he says
[1:15:40] well you're going to see me now right
[1:15:42] you're going to see me now and he made
[1:15:45] the acquaintance of the pastor talked
[1:15:47] with him and now you know the way is
[1:15:50] opened up for that I must also said I
[1:15:54] had another opportunity
[1:15:56] his son Martin whom you know we married
[1:16:00] right here
[1:16:02] um he goes over and visits the dad
[1:16:05] but to my surprise more people knows him
[1:16:08] than even the father
[1:16:10] so what's he said I don't know but the
[1:16:13] boy takes the car and he goes out and he
[1:16:15] just talks to people
[1:16:17] and he has a whole lot of friends
[1:16:20] and
[1:16:22] um one of those friends which was a
[1:16:24] farmer was sick and so
[1:16:28] he asked me to go and I prayed for this
[1:16:32] gentleman that was sick that God would
[1:16:34] touch him because his body was with a
[1:16:37] stroke and like that and we praise the
[1:16:40] name of the Living God God's spirit
[1:16:42] began to move in him such a wonderful
[1:16:45] way actually when I talked to him I'm
[1:16:47] going to find out what's happening with
[1:16:49] that gentleman I have no doubt that by
[1:16:52] now he's well or getting well for the
[1:16:55] glory of God and so
[1:16:57] um and then on the Sunday we preach in
[1:16:59] the church
[1:17:01] and the sermon was one which you heard
[1:17:05] because you know uh
[1:17:08] prepared ground
[1:17:10] right that's what I talked about
[1:17:12] prepared ground
[1:17:14] and oh my just yesterday I spoke to
[1:17:20] um a few of the brothers there and
[1:17:23] they're still talking amen see you see
[1:17:27] don't take this for granted you take it
[1:17:29] for granted because you hear it a good
[1:17:30] time ago and now you understand but
[1:17:33] hearing that for the first time you mean
[1:17:36] to say that I was actually prepared
[1:17:40] beforehand for the glory of God Amen or
[1:17:45] you you won't be able to survive you
[1:17:47] couldn't receive the seed we went
[1:17:49] through the rocky ground and so on so
[1:17:51] God prepared the soil that would receive
[1:17:54] receive that seed he knows what human
[1:17:57] being was going to get that seed and
[1:18:00] that the seed would then the age and
[1:18:02] time and so on the seed would come to
[1:18:04] life and you know we began to talk like
[1:18:06] that and just like I'm talking tonight I
[1:18:10] just just wrote a few things down like
[1:18:13] that because
[1:18:14] I didn't feel that I need to go there
[1:18:18] and you know give them a whole lot too
[1:18:22] much at one time so I just stood up and
[1:18:24] started talking I would like that out of
[1:18:27] the Bible and it was good so they can
[1:18:29] see that it's coming right out of the
[1:18:32] word and take them to Mary and take them
[1:18:35] to Jeremiah and God said before I before
[1:18:38] you even born I knew you already you
[1:18:41] know I knew you already before you were
[1:18:44] in your mother's womb I knew you oh my
[1:18:47] and then we can explain he's telling him
[1:18:49] before you even came into flesh I knew
[1:18:51] you
[1:18:52] you had an existence before you come
[1:18:54] into flesh you were with me before you
[1:18:57] come in the flesh you were in my mind
[1:18:58] before you come in the flesh and so I
[1:19:01] knew you before you came here this is
[1:19:04] you just manifested and you coming here
[1:19:06] now to be a prophet amen and and I
[1:19:11] ordained you not by the system ordaining
[1:19:13] you from some degree or from the
[1:19:15] Seminary that you got but they ordained
[1:19:18] you to be a prophet before the
[1:19:20] foundation of the world Amen imagine
[1:19:23] that that brother Bill that a baby comes
[1:19:26] ordained
[1:19:27] oh my brother Bill a baby comes ordained
[1:19:32] Jeremiah was ordained before he was even
[1:19:35] fully on the scene so we talked about
[1:19:37] that and how Mary you know was ground
[1:19:41] prepared to receive the word and bring
[1:19:45] the word to a manifestation the word
[1:19:47] made flesh and took an angel to come and
[1:19:51] bring the word for her you know typed in
[1:19:53] brother Branham as that angel for our
[1:19:55] day and the bride be in the Virgin for
[1:19:59] this day and if you bring it
[1:20:00] individually God has a preacher
[1:20:02] somebody's going to bring the word uh
[1:20:05] amen and then God quickens you you come
[1:20:08] to life praise the Lord so we talked
[1:20:11] along those lines I'm not going to
[1:20:12] preach the sermon but uh uh God bless
[1:20:16] you we had a wonderful time they were
[1:20:19] praising God they were giving God the
[1:20:21] glory and one more thing happened there
[1:20:27] as I was preaching preaching and
[1:20:30] preaching I keep being pulled to two
[1:20:33] young boys that were sitting like in the
[1:20:37] third Pew they were just sitting there
[1:20:39] in the third Pew and you know I tried to
[1:20:41] keep preaching and not uh but it keeps
[1:20:45] pulling me there before I know it the
[1:20:47] holy spirit said
[1:20:49] um
[1:20:49] you're going to be raised up to be
[1:20:52] preachers
[1:20:53] amen the hand of the Lord will be on you
[1:20:57] and you
[1:20:59] will become preachers
[1:21:01] and God's spirit just moved on the
[1:21:04] congregation moved on those young men in
[1:21:07] a wonderful way praise the Lord
[1:21:09] hallelujah and so then I've just began I
[1:21:13] began to tell them that thinketh not
[1:21:15] strange these things happen because I
[1:21:18] started preaching when I was you know
[1:21:22] 14 years old you know calling get called
[1:21:25] at 12 14 I'm preaching and the word
[1:21:28] began to grow from that time to now so
[1:21:31] don't think it's strange just let the
[1:21:33] Lord have his way in a marvelous and
[1:21:35] wonderful way so that's another
[1:21:38] um remarkable thing that happened for
[1:21:42] God's glory and praise
[1:21:45] the other one I wouldn't talk about in
[1:21:48] the sense of the astonishment
[1:21:53] of the people and of a particular
[1:21:56] brother
[1:21:57] couldn't believe my age
[1:22:02] he's just shaking his head and coming
[1:22:04] back he says you're gonna be eating
[1:22:07] something
[1:22:09] I said I'm eating the word
[1:22:14] I'm eating the word here right he says
[1:22:17] no no no no no I know that we all
[1:22:19] believe the word and so on what do you
[1:22:22] eat right he's still not getting it that
[1:22:26] is not just what you eat but the Holy
[1:22:28] Spirit but then I had to quote him the
[1:22:30] scripture where God tells you that if
[1:22:33] you follow my word and the word gets in
[1:22:36] you and you grow by it uh you know your
[1:22:39] whole body your skin your this that you
[1:22:42] know the spirit of Abraham and all that
[1:22:45] it was a blessing praise the name of the
[1:22:47] Lord It's a Wonderful brother and the
[1:22:50] pastor wonderful they took us out to a
[1:22:52] beautiful uh Italian restaurant amen
[1:22:57] lots of Italians there
[1:23:00] lots of Italians on the island but I
[1:23:03] didn't go to that quarter Chinese are on
[1:23:06] the island they are everywhere anyway
[1:23:09] and they have restaurants and laundries
[1:23:12] on the island an embassy on the island
[1:23:14] and
[1:23:16] um yes sir and but mostly the island is
[1:23:21] dominated by the British Americans go in
[1:23:25] there also with their marvelous yachts
[1:23:29] and the British with their big yachts
[1:23:31] and millionaires billionaires
[1:23:35] multi-millionaires and and they feel
[1:23:38] free and safe because the island is
[1:23:42] basically
[1:23:43] um
[1:23:45] it's there's no danger
[1:23:47] to the point there is no snakes
[1:23:51] on the island
[1:23:53] there's no wild animals on the island
[1:23:57] so
[1:23:58] um there's nothing so the tourists are
[1:24:01] walking freely in the city and
[1:24:04] everything else alone
[1:24:06] women could walk alone or they walk
[1:24:09] together or whatever and they're not
[1:24:12] troubled I asked the brother I said
[1:24:15] brother what's going on what's Happening
[1:24:18] Here what's the crime rate he said
[1:24:20] brother there really is no crime rate
[1:24:22] because we don't have any crime right if
[1:24:28] if there's some little thing happens
[1:24:30] it's the it's the headlines for the
[1:24:32] newspaper over the whole country right
[1:24:34] now not to say that you don't have Petty
[1:24:38] crimes like somebody's stealing a
[1:24:40] chicken
[1:24:41] or a duck
[1:24:44] oh you know or something like that or in
[1:24:48] the city there might be a few
[1:24:49] pickpockets but not many because they're
[1:24:52] very strict and other than that people
[1:24:55] are saved and uh that's in a brief way
[1:25:00] what I can say about the island of
[1:25:04] Jamaica
[1:25:06] sorry Antigua that I keep
[1:25:09] going over that name the island of
[1:25:11] Antigua that uh it's a it's a blessed
[1:25:15] Island
[1:25:16] and peculiar peculiar in a sense I'm
[1:25:20] surprised that the humility of the
[1:25:22] people
[1:25:23] and how they move in that kind of a way
[1:25:27] we visited another place of repute
[1:25:30] called The Devil's Bridge
[1:25:34] and what that is is the Atlantic Ocean
[1:25:38] on this side of the island is the
[1:25:40] Atlantic and on the other side is the
[1:25:44] Caribbean Sea
[1:25:46] and they meet somewhere in the middle
[1:25:48] there but this side the water is rougher
[1:25:52] and on the side with the Caribbean Sea
[1:25:54] it's calmer Bluer and really nice so
[1:26:00] it's different but on the Atlantic side
[1:26:04] where it's kind of rough
[1:26:06] we were taken to a place called The
[1:26:08] Devil's Bridge and it's just water like
[1:26:13] um pounding against the rocky Coastline
[1:26:16] after Royal made a great big hole there
[1:26:20] until this piece of rock goes like that
[1:26:23] and there's nothing under it so they
[1:26:27] call it the Devil's Bridge
[1:26:29] and because it's a separation is there
[1:26:33] between
[1:26:33] a little bit of Separation the water
[1:26:36] goes under the bridge and then it pours
[1:26:40] out of this Gap that's there like that
[1:26:44] and friends I asked them well what is
[1:26:48] why you call it the Devil's Bridge he
[1:26:50] said because this has been here for many
[1:26:52] years and this you know it's
[1:26:55] growing more and more the fact is that
[1:26:58] many of the slaves that were brought
[1:27:01] here
[1:27:02] from Africa
[1:27:04] become so discouraged with their lot in
[1:27:07] life
[1:27:08] and they couldn't take it anymore
[1:27:11] and before I be a slave and suffer like
[1:27:16] this then they went and they committed
[1:27:18] suicide by jumping off for the Devil's
[1:27:21] Bridge into the Atlantic Ocean and that
[1:27:25] is why now it's a little tour site for
[1:27:28] people to go and see it but there are
[1:27:31] other sites with different other things
[1:27:33] I didn't get to go to the museum
[1:27:36] I didn't get to go to
[1:27:40] um you know there was there was a sir
[1:27:43] what's his name again duck yard
[1:27:46] Nelson Lord Nelson's dockyard
[1:27:50] where he brought the British Fleet to us
[1:27:54] there and by the British Fleet they were
[1:27:56] able to control the entire West Indies
[1:28:00] the French went and took that island but
[1:28:03] they could only hold it for about I
[1:28:05] think six months and that was it and
[1:28:08] they had to get out because the British
[1:28:10] were powerful in those days and they
[1:28:14] they control the island until now they
[1:28:16] have Independence but they still aligned
[1:28:19] with the British there very very much so
[1:28:23] praise the Lord and I would encourage
[1:28:25] you if you have an opportunity go visit
[1:28:27] the island visit the Saints on the
[1:28:30] island and have a wonderful time while
[1:28:33] you're there praise the Lord we're going
