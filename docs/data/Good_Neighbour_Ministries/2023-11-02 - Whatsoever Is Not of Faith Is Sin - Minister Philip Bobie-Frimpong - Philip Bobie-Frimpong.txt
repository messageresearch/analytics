work but father Your Grace speak to the hearts of the people to be here Lord not to see me but to hear from you father I pray that you take me aside and close my mouth from say anything that you don't want me to say Lord may your spirit come and take control take preeminence and bless your children we invite the great Holy Ghost father God without you our meeting will be in vain Lord one word from you father will sett us so come and speak to your children's heart in Jesus name amen amen let's read our Bible here I have three scriptures maybe four of them today is um Bible studies our first scripture is Romans it's all in Romans then the last one I'll read it later on Romans Chapter 14 verse 23 and my title is anything done without faith is sin Romans 14:23 and then Romans 15:16 and Romans 8:11 if you got to say amen amen okay Romans 1423 and he that douth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of Fai for whatsoever is not of faith it sin that's my title uh Romans 156 that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father of our Lord Jesus christall and Romans 8:11 but if the same if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that rais up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you you please Jesus bless the reading of your word amen please be seated okay we all know that faith is a substance of things not seen evidence of Things Not Seen it's a substance so um we contact our five senses by see taste smell and hearing but there's another sense braam call Super sense the six sense that is Faith it doesn't go by the things that you physically see it goes by the word of God the promise of God it might be contrary to what you physically can see but if you have God has revealed to you that thing is yours nothing can take it away from you for faith is a revelation and nobody can give himself a revelation a revelation is a gift from God and without faith it's impossible to please God so those who just come to God might believe that he's those who came to God might believe that he's the one who deligently canot do it so without faith you can't please God by faith the others they gain a good report so anything that you do in this earth if you do not do it by faith it doesn't please God because you doing with your caner mind our pastor has told us in so many times that when you even um come to pay your offering or your thight you don't just put the money in the envelope and just come and put it in there because then you do it um it becomes like a routine it's a tradition it becomes tradition to be every time you just come you put the offering inside you place there but he said that you have to pray before you put that side before he put that offering inside and trust God that in Malachi 3 he said that bring this and I will let food now open Windows of Heaven to us to bless you so you putting in in and you praying and believing that God will honor his word because there's one thing that God cannot do he cannot fail he cannot lie you lie I lie but God never lie he said let every man's word be alive but mind be the truth so if God keep his word keep his promise then you don't put that thing and let become har har Sly they just put the money in sometimes our Christian work sometime become a tradition we just have to be to be at the church we just want to show our present but God don't want us to be in that way he want us to come prepare that heart come ready to receive from him because you get what you expect even tonight it all depends on what you expecting if you expect God to speak to your heart he will speak to your need if you expect just to come because remember you never going to live here the same way you came you either going to be more drawn to God or you not going to be drawn you not going going to be drawn to God so is your expectation what do you want God to do for you tonight whatever in your heart if thou can believe all things are possible to them that believe because God is more than able to answer your need but it's according to your faith it's according to what you expect remember I always say that that man that was like 70 years or 75 that did not bra said that he was Infidel he didn't believe in Jesus Christ but if you listen to the conversation he had with Abraham he he said that I was always wanted to speak to that man that was able to pray for those people with cancer God healed because in his heart he was expecting to meet that prophet of God so God supernaturally make a way for them to meet so whatever you expecting tonight you will get it according to your faith God is the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so back to the title and offering when you put it expect it God want us to give us our all because remember that um that the Widow's might that Widow he gave she gave everything but God said that she had manone was very little but God said that she has given more than everybody why she gave from a heart she gave all that she had so God expect us to give everything that we have and sister hat right also did exact same thing and when she also put in $20 braam wanted to give that money back to her but God did not allow her did not allow him to give that money back to her and when the greatest thing that could ever happen on the face of Earth speaking things into existence it happened to her because why she gave her everything so what I'm trying to say tonight if if you have seen if I have seen that this gospel is thus said the Lord and if you know that there's nothing on this Earth that is greater than what we have then you have to support it with all our mind all our heart all our soul everything within it as you have to support this ministry we have to support the work of God because we know this is the truth there's nothing if it's not the truth then you be the most miserable person you have to just pack up and go but once we have God has revealed to us that this is the truth and nothing on the face of this is closer to this then you have to support it with everything within us God wants us to be a prisoner to his wor leave everything aside let's put God first amen say seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all all other things shall be added unto you so if the kingdom of God is was within you that kingdom is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is within you amen so you have to what give your everything I know it's not easy in this hour it's a demanding time your work wants more of every 10 of you it's a time of demanding your family want 100% of you God also need more of you so there have to be a balance but even though you balance your natural of your spiritual life you still have to decide in your heart have decided to follow Jesus no matter what comes maybe because the Lord that has brought us all this far he's able to us take us the end he will never leave us in the middle of the road he didn't bring us here to leave us he didn't bring us here to suffer he didn't bring us here to let all this go he is here to take us through if thou can believe all things are possible he's never going to leave you in the middle of the road it's not by power or by might but by my spirit amen say the Living God it has never been the prophet of God has never been the saints of God has never been anybody it always been God in the people it's God in Moses god in Samson God in all those people that did those Miracles and is the same yesterday today and forever so the same God that was in the prophet is also in you amen and he's doing exact same thing he did through them don't look down upon yourself because the scripture said they without us will not be made perfect so they all waiting on us we are the last one God reserve us the end so we have to have confidence in God and in ourselves that God is behind our skin it's God who is doing this it's not you it's not by your own righteousness by his but by his by his grace alone there's no one perfect here but there perfect one who is Jesus Christ he's in you make you perfect he makes us perfect not we ourselves the Perfection of perfection is in us he is the perfect one we all we all make mistakes none of us is perfect by in our flesh here but the soul within us is thatbut is from God that why nobody can touch is God himself and that perfect God is in you and is in me so that makes you perfect so don't look down upon yourself don't look at your mistakes God doesn't even remember any one of them he has put them in his SE or forgetfulness he's the same God he loves you he cares for you let's love him back let's love him by because it's the grace of God that has brought us all here and I believe that that same Grace will lead us home hallelujah it's Amazing Grace Grace Grace Grace it's not anyone of us has done God's grace and that Grace is going to lead us to our final destination and God hasn't changed hallelujah praise God what is happening is that a lot of people are doing things without faith without Revelation they doing it just because somebody have told them to do it somewh bra saying that if I told you not to wear pants and you just wear it you don't wear you just don't wear it it's not going to help you but something in your heart respond and confirm to it and you do it then you get a blessing then you have understanding why you are not wearing those pants I'm fed up with copy cats going on in the message people are just copying and doing things without Revelation by just doing things sometime one brother was telling me that there was a brother not in our church here there was a brother that witnessed to somebody after he witnessed the person the person came to be baptized and when he baptized the guy was still smoking so this man also bought a cigarette and give to the man to to smoke how can you impersonate like that because Abraham did that he's also doing that but in this situation the man smoke the all the pack because why he's impersonating just like s of ska he said that Paul I know Jesus I know the demon said Paul I know Jesus I know who are you so you cannot go by somebody's experience before you do anything if God revealed to that individual it's a different situation but just because braam bought a cigar for somebody that the person has baptized is smoking and you do that you are making a copy cat it will not work let's let God have his own way let God lead us as individual because God is not we are we are unique don't copy one another because before when you came a lot of people want to use their experience and impose it on us to go the same way God is dealing with them but God deals with Gentiles as individuals so just open your heart and let God speak to your heart let God lead you let God direct you because God speaks to his children no matter what you need if you open your heart and you are not biased to what you want and you go there with an open heart open mind God will make things plain to you he will talk to you he will speak to you any way that he's going to make that things clear to you he's going to make sure you hear it you understand it so go we don't want to be a copycat we want to do what God is leading us to do amen because he's the same yesterday today and forever so what am I trying to say when God deals with us with as individual never has he dealt with us as a group and even when it came time for him to speak to his 12 disciples he asked them the question who do you say the son of man I am as some say you are Elijah some say you are some of the prophets they all say whatever they want but he narrow it down and asked Peter what do you say this is who do you say this is and Peter said Thou Art the son of the Living God he said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father in Heaven has done Upon This Rock upon this Revelation I'll build my church and the Gate of Hell shall not Prevail against it because this that's the God's standard for every age every generation is based on Revelation the PA of the word that God has thrown light on when that light lights up those seed of God those who were predestinated to see the truth in that age they will respond to it from Luther from Wesley all those ages when light thred on that light that word of God the seed of God God's children who are predestinated for eternal life that word will be revealed to them and they will live by it by Faith by Revelation and see the hands of God because this is not a a a group Affair it's an individual how God is dealing with us he deal with us individual that's why the prophet said the Bible said by faith Sarah also she has to have her own personal revelation amen so he said here in paragraph 234 Christ The Mystery of God revealed look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation see Christ life in you makes him Center of Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible complete revelation of Christ Christ in you Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you say well brother Abraham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen you see not you join a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of RS but Christ the Bible he's the word that revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place is Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon so it's an individual how Christ has revealed himself to you it's how God has done it to you that's why the Pharisees the Sadducees the the rabbis at that time the priests and all those people they were singing The Very song of Psalm 22 Psalm 22 my God my God why H has Thou forsaken me all this they were in the in in the in the in in in those churches why in their Temple singing those psalms and at the same time the morning of crucifixion they were crucifying the very word that was that was they were manifesting that they didn't even know it because they didn't know what was what God was doing in their time so the scripture they were singing about it they were talking about it and and that scripture they were fulfilling in the wrong portion because they were singing my God my God why has thou forsaken me and they were do all those things that happened the morning of crucifixion and they were thinking they were talking but that thing was manifesting and they did not even know it that that's what is taking place because they were living in the past they were just talking about it and their eyes were blinded they couldn't see what was taking place in the present tense of their time so it's a present stage office Ministry you have to recognize what God is doing pres now thank you pres tells what he's doing the past will not do it because people a lot of people when it is written they can know it what is written what was said but when it's manifesting they can't see a clue of it it's a it's a it's a foreign to them they want I see it writing but by the time they recognize it that thing has gone that's why the Bible said the letter kill it but the spirit give life it's a spirit of God that throw light on the word and it quickens it and it give life amen so so many people are living in the past when the thing is written they can read a letter but when it is manifesting in their time they can't recognize it but the true bride of Christ those whose name were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world those who have representation who has the who God has his thought on them when God they God think about them they were in God's thought they will recognize what God is doing every time in their time in their age they cannot miss it on they can't help it but they they will find it they will recognize it because the same God in them is part of them the the head Unite with the body so they can't they can't help it it's not something that bra said somewhere that some people they they want to get they understand they for they can't do nothing about it some whatever you do they cannot get it but others they don't do nothing but unconscious automatically they got it because why they are part of the of the of the main thing so they cannot differentiate it because they are part of God so how can they miss God said my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow you call them by my name so God is the same yesterday today and forever amen so don't let us look too much to the back when the light is shown in the word catch it and move on with it amen because our God is awesome God hallelujah God hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise our god thank you Jesus amen so one other thing is I can't get away from um from where waiting on the promise of God it just keep on coming everywhere I try to get away from it it doesn't leave me can't leave I can't leave it um let's read James 1: 3 to8 in James chapter 3 verse one it said knowing this that the trying of your faith WTH patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire world wanting nothing so patience work with what faith if you have faith you got the patience to wait for the thing to manifest you can't go ahead of it as you said the last time that Sarah went ahead and gave hegi to Abraham and those time polygamy was legal so Abraham hecken to what Sarah told him but somewhere back then that bit correction when ishmail the wild child when he came on the scene and bullying um bullying Isaac Sarah asked God Sarah told Abraham to send him away then Abraham asked God that do he has to that God said listen to what your wife is telling you so just a little bit correction because in that Ismael situation God told Abraham asked God before he did it but during the death during the marriage because polygamy was legal at that time Abraham just hacking to what um Sarah told him but the main thing that we trying to point over here is that Sarah did not have patience she couldn't wait and that brought Ishmael who is a wild child that has been a Thor in the flesh of the Israel Israel people but if you read in the scriptures that time her name was sah s a r a i but when the angel that MC went and revealed the heart of Sarah to her if you go back to Roman said that by faith Sarah also sah received her own faith to what to give birth to to Isaac it was a revelation that from that time going Sarah never missed it she had her own personal revelation amen before the child even that time if you check over there she was changed to be a young man because the Revelation that she received because of that it let it quickened her body for her to be chained to receive that promised son amen so that same God is here and if you read in the scriptures another person that have the patient was Elisha Elisha followed Elijah for so many years for more than 20 years we never read in a place that Elisha tried to um sabotage Elijah um program we never read in anywh that she tried to get away from El Elijah and have his own Ministry he wait upon the Lord he wait upon his ministry because he has the patient to wait when the time came he received a double portion of Elijah's spirit so it's important that we wait on our gifts it's important that we have patient and wait and let God have his own perfect way don't try to go ahead of your pastor don't try to sabotage don't try to uh push into your ministry if God has called you and he has something for you he will bring it to pass no matter what happened whatever God has inall for you will come to pass Elisha was not like ha who tried to what bypass the prophet to go and get money from um to get money from the Syrian leper he never did that he was faithful and God expect us to be faithful faithful to his servants faithful to his word respect when you respect it makes you get a place that you don't you fear to do something wrong to against God that you not going to please God so it makes you respect it brings you fear so the same thing if you respect God's servants you want to also fear so that you don't want to do something to what against them that's the way the scripture said respect and if you respect he said that if you give the prophets reward if you respect the prophet you get the prophet reward if you disrespect you get the other part of it too because elishah when those children they suspected him what happened that and you call on and 4 of them were killed on that same very day because of disrespect of the office so let's have in our heart to respect the office that God has given to us when you respect God will bless you when you respect God in his own time he'll give you your blessing so it is God of Elijah God has sent us a prophet Malachi 4 4 56 has been fulfilled Revelation 10:7 Amos 3:7 all those scriptures we respect the prophet that God has sent us we love him and respect him amen and because we love and respect him God will give us has also G us the word reward of the Prophet respect and in Malachi 4:5 said that I'll send you the Elijah the prophet you turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers the Turning of the House of the children to the fathers and the turn of the children heart the fathers in our time it means that we are going to have the same faith that Apostles have the same Pentecostal Faith the same faith that the Peter and the rest have that is what we have now and what is happening is making us write another book of Acts because it's the M member body before it was Jesus Christ alone and when he died his his his Spirit came and divided and went to the all the apostles so it is our Prophet alone doing all those Mighty works and God took him from the scene and what happened the same spirit that was on the prophet the same way that Elisha cried where is the god of Elijah we serving we looking for the god of Elijah we not serving Elijah we serving Elijah God of Elijah that's who we are crying for the same God that was in the prophet the same God in us doing exact same thing he did through his ministry but it's scattered the bride is all over the world in Africa Australia in Asia all over the place remember we are not Canadians we not Americans we are not Africans we are Christians we are Sons and Daughters of the Living God and the same God in the Malachi 4:5 that same God is in us because we are the Fulfillment of that prophecy and we are manifesting it Hallelujah the people like the same God that was in him is also working through us because we have recognized our Prophet for our day and give him that Prophet respect and God is moving in our lives mightily when elishah was so respect to Elijah God gave him a double portion of his thing no wonder he said that the bride will have a short quick w many member body and that going to be tremendous it's on the way when you see things all shaping it's all those pressures bringing unity and they going to put everybody in their place and when that thing happen you watch how God will manifest and flow in a mighty way has never been before the world haven't seen nothing yet the CH of children the God's children are coming onward watching Onward Christian Soldiers we are Marching as to war that same God is in us he doing exact same thing he did back then he hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever because he said that all that the father was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church and when he did that what happened the apostles they did exact same thing Jesus Christ did when the um Peter and John when God used them to heal that man at the at the beautiful gate the people recognize that first they were ignorant unlearned but they realize that they have been with Jesus so if the same spirit that was in crisis in you your actions your behavior will let people know that you have been with him you don't have to talk you don't have to prove anything God will vindicate you as he said in abble that God testify of his what of his gift of of of his um of his sacrifice because it was revealed to what Abel and God testified of his sacrifice the same God that testified of the Apostles gift of of the Apostles that same God will testify that he's in you you don't have to talk you don't have to do anything said by their fruits you shall know them he will live his life unconsciously through you it's not you going to make this or you can't force yourself do this do that no just relax and let God have his perfect way in your life because he is the one that going to do it you and I we can't do nothing without him without him we are nothing he is the center of our life he is everything and when he comes into you you are nobody you become somebody because somebody is in you doing exact same thing he did through the apostles because that Mighty God is in you he did it in the apostles he's doing it through us as D and elaborate it because sometime we look too far sometime we put things in our mind look too far but just come down and look into this little small Church what God has been doing through the lives of the people Lord if you could just have an eye you will see that the same God the same Pillar of Fire the same Mighty angel that same God that was in Moses that was in the prophet he stood the same in this little church but your eyes have to open you just have to sit down don't look too far because God is so simple sometimes that Simplicity might bypass you the way you expected when John the Baptist was to be born they were expecting it so high the mountains will this and that and that but it came so simple the people did not even recognize only few that accepted his message and he point them to the Christ and they believe it once he point them the Christ they never follow John the Baptist again they follow the word Christ the word and it's the same thing our age he has pointed to him he said I must decrease he must increase once he said that the Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world you follow that light you follow that word of God for your age he doesn't expect you to go back anymore he has said he said somewhere they said that Braham would the bride have Ministry say yes it is is going on now the 454 Ephesians 511 they do exit the bride Ministry is going on now he said that um when I I'm gone God will send a young man and they will come I'm just hitting the highlights I don't have time and they'll come and break the word and that thing has happening and is happening but people eyes are looking somewhere they blind to it and is going on now they can see it amen those young men they came like a p h all those they were doing all that they were breaking that word of God making it clear to us but people couldn't see it that generation is going is fading and God is Raising that young man to what come and do the exact same thing before the end comes those young man they are here it's the scriptures but people are looking back little bride bride look stay in line with the word of God don't look left or right look the word of God look the promise of God because Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's doing exact same thing if you are not careful said they bypass you and a lot of people the Rapture will be gone and they say oh why did this thing was supposed to this said has gone already and he did not know because why even John the Baptist and the disciples all of them they miss it they say why that the scripture said theas must first come he said theas Will Truly Come and what restore all things that was the the first restore later elas has come and is gone already Rec was John the Baptist that was in two fold one was the Malachi 4 and one was John the Baptist so John the Baptist ministry came and finished it and the people did not even recognize that and scripture is repeating itself the denomination
