[1:20] he knows your name
[1:24] our scripture is found in john
[1:27] chapter 10 that is the gospel of john
[1:31] chapter 10 reading from verse
[1:34] 1 to 5
[1:39] verily verily i say
[1:43] unto you he that enter it
[1:46] not by the door into the sheepfold
[1:50] but climb it up some other way
[1:54] the same is a thief and a robber
[1:59] but he that enter it in by the door
[2:03] is the shepherd of the sheep
[2:08] to him they porter open it
[2:13] and the sheep hear his voice
[2:17] and he call it his
[2:20] own sheep by name
[2:26] and leaded them out
[2:30] and when he put it forth his own sheep
[2:34] he go it before them
[2:37] and the sheep follow him
[2:40] for they know his voice
[2:45] and a stranger will they
[2:48] not follow but will flee from him
[2:53] for they know not the voice
[2:57] of strangers thank god
[3:00] for the reading of his blessed word
[3:03] let us pray dear ones
[3:06] dear god our righteous and gracious
[3:10] heavenly father
[3:12] we ask that the great holy spirit
[3:16] will come bless us and anoint us
[3:20] from on high send down the blessings
[3:24] upon us
[3:25] of the word of god inspiration
[3:29] opening the eyes of our understanding
[3:32] the doors of our heart
[3:33] to receive your truth father
[3:36] and to worship you with all our hearts
[3:40] in the name of jesus christ
[3:44] amen and amen
[3:49] now down in ancient judea
[3:57] it must have been just before
[4:02] daybreak that mary
[4:06] came to the tomb of jesus
[4:11] john chapter 20 the bible tells us
[4:15] how that she came to that tomb
[4:20] and she was sad for her lord had died
[4:25] like many today believing that it's all
[4:28] dead
[4:29] but as she went to the
[4:33] door of the tomb
[4:37] there were two young men
[4:40] sitting by the tomb
[4:46] and they said what seek ye
[4:51] if you're seeking jesus he's not here
[4:54] for he is risen praise god hallelujah
[4:59] he's risen from the dead
[5:02] and with that she turned
[5:06] away from them to go
[5:09] on her way back to the
[5:12] city and as she turned
[5:17] she saw one standing there
[5:21] the bible tells us that she thought that
[5:24] he was the gardener
[5:27] and she said sir
[5:31] do you know where they might have
[5:34] put my lord right
[5:37] you know so she's saying that to him
[5:41] and the gardener spoke the gardener
[5:45] the one she sought was the gardener
[5:48] spoke
[5:49] and said mary
[5:52] and the bible said she
[5:55] spun around and looked at him
[5:59] and she said oh my lord
[6:03] she recognized him
[6:06] from his voice and from
[6:09] him calling her name
[6:14] this one knew her name
[6:18] and you know the reaction of anybody
[6:21] when your name is called even in a
[6:25] massive crowd it catches your attention
[6:29] it causes you to turn around
[6:32] from whatever life you might be living
[6:35] whatever
[6:36] way you may be going the calling of your
[6:40] name
[6:41] arrests your attention
[6:44] and brings you back to yourself
[6:48] and to your thinking
[6:52] now when brother william
[6:55] marion branham was alive
[7:01] he being the 20th prophet
[7:04] century prophet that god
[7:08] sent to the gentiles
[7:12] now you'll speak for everyone but in
[7:15] particular
[7:16] profit to the gentiles with a message
[7:20] to the gentile era
[7:23] and to call out a people for his name
[7:27] and to bring the faith of the children
[7:31] back to the fathers
[7:35] many times
[7:36] [Music]
[7:38] why tia lost burn or roberts
[7:41] many others got their ministry from
[7:44] seeing god working through the life of
[7:48] this great
[7:49] servant prophet of the almighty god
[7:53] if you have never seen the
[7:56] video of him
[7:59] on the deep calls to the deep
[8:03] it would be a great blessing for any
[8:04] pastor to play
[8:06] that video or any believer
[8:09] to watch that video and it would be a
[8:13] great blessing to your soul
[8:18] oh many times he would stand up on the
[8:21] platform
[8:23] you will see it in that video the deep
[8:26] calls to the deep
[8:30] and he would begin to discern
[8:34] the hearts and thoughts of the people
[8:38] by a divine gift given to him
[8:42] by god when god said
[8:45] as moses was given two gifts to lead the
[8:49] people
[8:50] out of natural egypt so i give you
[8:53] these gifts to lead the people from
[8:55] spiritual
[8:57] egypt bondage and the light
[9:02] praise god so here it was
[9:06] that he would stand on the platform
[9:10] and they would bring a person to him
[9:13] might be a woman or a man
[9:16] and he would look at them under
[9:19] the vine anointing and discernment of
[9:23] the holy
[9:23] spirit he would say oh
[9:27] uh you you you're a you're a christian
[9:32] you're some sort of a of a teacher
[9:35] of the bible oh i see you're a minister
[9:39] you your name is
[9:43] miss so-and-so or mr so-and-so
[9:46] you'll tell them their name and you
[9:50] live at this address
[9:54] and you'll give them the number of the
[9:57] address
[9:57] five four three two one
[10:00] so a name the street name the city
[10:04] wherever that person would be living
[10:07] and then he'll say and
[10:11] you came here
[10:14] because you got a letter saying
[10:18] that your daughter is in a terrible
[10:21] state
[10:23] and she needs prayer for this this this
[10:26] and he'll name
[10:26] what it was what was in the letter
[10:30] and the person would say yes yes
[10:33] that's true and then he'll say but
[10:36] that's not
[10:37] all you came
[10:40] for her but you are also suffering
[10:44] and he'll tell them what they're
[10:46] suffering from
[10:48] and then he will turn around
[10:52] and say thus saith the lord you are
[10:55] healed by the power of god and
[10:58] a person would be healed by the power
[11:01] and the presence of god
[11:03] the blind to see the lame to walk the
[11:06] sick and the despairing praise
[11:10] god hallelujah crippled praise god would
[11:13] be set free
[11:15] by the power of almighty god
[11:19] even know the names for instance
[11:23] brother brady
[11:27] in the nation state of jamaica
[11:33] many years ago was in
[11:39] one of brother branham's meetings
[11:43] and he was a pentecostal at that time
[11:48] his wife wrote him a letter and she told
[11:52] me this herself
[11:53] but it's also something he has testified
[11:56] to
[11:58] how that she had pains in her left
[12:01] foot and it was swollen up to a size
[12:04] and the doctors couldn't find what it
[12:07] was
[12:08] and there was nothing they could do
[12:10] about it
[12:12] so she was at home laying in that
[12:15] bed in the dark of that bedroom
[12:20] and he was in the united states in the
[12:23] meetings
[12:25] and while in the meetings brother
[12:27] branham preaching
[12:28] and then he suddenly stopped
[12:32] and said uh sir pointing to brother
[12:36] brady do you believe me to be god's
[12:39] prophet
[12:40] god's servant and brother brady said yes
[12:43] sir
[12:44] i do he says
[12:47] i see water you are not from here
[12:53] oh go back to jamaica
[12:56] mr brady your wife's left foot is
[13:00] healed thus saith the lord glory to
[13:04] god hallelujah and
[13:08] the sister tells how that the great
[13:11] pillar of fire
[13:12] of god seemed like it came
[13:15] out of the wall and passed over the bed
[13:18] went through the other wall and
[13:20] up she comes out of that bed
[13:23] and lived a full healthy whole life
[13:27] until the day she died
[13:30] you see god under the
[13:34] second pull of the holy spirit

[15:34] god was demonstrating for us to
[15:38] understand that just as
[15:41] much as he knew the name of the
[15:45] people and persons under
[15:48] the natural or in the natural realm

[18:30] before the foundation of the world
[18:34] and that is a part of this word
[18:38] so that when the word is preached

[19:58] some of the men would make a locket
[20:02] for their wife or the wife may make
[20:06] one for her husband and in the locket
[20:10] would be
[20:10] a picture of that person
[20:15] that they hold dear and

[20:21] to that locket and it would be a
[20:25] person would wear it and on their chest

[20:32] that our hearts are the locket
[20:36] and he stamps his

[21:49] there were examples of god calling
[21:51] people
[21:53] and letting them know that he knows
[21:55] their name
[21:57] god called in genesis abraham
[22:01] he just heard the voice calling him
[22:04] amen there was
[22:07] moses he just heard the voice out of the
[22:11] burning bush
[22:13] saying moses moses
[22:16] oh praise god you know the story
[22:20] he turns around and there's a pillar of
[22:23] fire
[22:24] burning in the bush and the bushes not
[22:26] burned

[22:53] praise
[22:53] god the same god samuel was just a child
[22:58] in the temple
[23:00] and there he was in the temple
[23:04] and in the depths of the temple he heard
[23:07] the voice
[23:08] samuel samuel
[23:12] and he did not know who was calling him
[23:15] so he went and said i heard this voice
[23:19] calling me and he was advised
[23:23] go back do your duties and if you ever
[23:26] hear that voice again
[23:28] say answer and say lord
[23:32] here am i praise god which he did
[23:35] and you know his calling to be god's
[23:39] prophet so was it with gideon
[23:43] that gideon was poor he was humble
[23:47] and he lived in the nation of israel
[23:52] and while on the threshing floor an
[23:54] angel appeared to gideon
[23:57] and the angel said hail
[24:00] mighty man of valor thou
[24:04] mighty man of god and i
[24:07] guess gideon must have looked behind him
[24:10] because he knew what type of person he
[24:14] was
[24:15] uh and hid himself the bible says
[24:20] he hid himself amongst the the straw

[24:30] you see what man calls weak god calls
[24:33] mighty
[24:34] what man thinks is foolish god calls
[24:37] wise
[24:38] what man just pushes aside
[24:41] the rejected stone becomes the head of
[24:44] the corner
[24:45] the things men will
[24:48] fail to recognize god recognizes
[24:51] you may be comforted as a nobody
[24:54] nobody has respect regard push the side
[24:58] shut to the side everything else but in
[25:00] the eyes of god you're a

[29:16] we are
[29:17] god wants to use us and to put us
[29:20] into service right now to do his perfect
[29:25] will
[29:26] now in first corinthians
[29:29] chapter 2 verses 6 to 11
[29:35] it reads thus habit
[29:38] we speak wisdom among them that are
[29:42] perfect
[29:44] yet not the wisdom of this world
[29:48] nor of the princes of this world
[29:51] that come to not but we speak the wisdom
[29:56] of god
[29:58] in a mystery even
[30:01] the hidden wisdom which
[30:04] god ordained before
[30:08] the world unto our glory
[30:13] which none of the princes of this world
[30:16] knew
[30:18] where had they known it they would
[30:22] not have crucified the lord of glory
[30:26] but as it is written i
[30:29] had not seen nor air heard
[30:33] neither had it entered into the heart of
[30:36] man
[30:37] the things which god
[30:40] has prepared for them that love him
[30:46] but god hath revealed them
[30:50] unto us how by
[30:53] his spirit where the spirit
[30:56] searches all things yey
[30:59] the deep things of god for what man not
[31:03] the
[31:04] things of man save the spirit of man
[31:07] which is in him even saw the things of
[31:10] god
[31:11] knoweth no man but
[31:15] the spirit of almighty god
[31:19] hallelujah friends our
[31:22] names as the scripture
[31:26] tells us was a hidden
[31:29] mystery of god
[31:32] hidden within himself the word
[31:37] the man's sea the man's life
[31:40] germ is in him praise god
[31:44] we were in him and so our
[31:48] spiritual name
[31:51] was hidden in him but he knew our names
[31:55] people called us all manner of other
[31:57] names but god knew our names
[32:00] this bride then our names were hidden
[32:04] and put on the lamb's book of life
[32:07] before the foundation of the world
[32:11] and then sealed up from the eyes
[32:16] of satan and all of his
[32:19] imps demons and devils
[32:23] everywhere but thank god
[32:26] we've come to the hour when it's
[32:29] now being revealed with the opening up
[32:32] of the
[32:33] mystery of the seven seals
[32:36] what a great thing in our day and in our
[32:40] time hallelujah my friends
[32:43] let us be certain of god
[32:48] as the old song said is my name written
[32:51] there

[32:56] of thy
[32:57] kingdom is my name written there
[33:01] let us be certain of god cry out to
[33:05] god and ask god's forgiveness cleansing

[33:12] blessed
[33:13] assurance that you are one of his
[33:16] and he is yours oh praise god and
[33:19] together
[33:20] we are one in him for if your
[33:24] name is not in that
[33:28] lamb's book of life the book of
[33:31] redemption
[33:33] before the foundation of the world
[33:37] then listen jesus said
[33:40] deception coming on the earth
[33:43] and it would deceive all
[33:47] those whose names are not
[33:50] written in the land's book of life
[33:53] from before the foundation of the world
[33:58] and if the person's name even
[34:01] for the elected would be deceived
[34:05] if it were possible but it's not
[34:07] possible it's impossible
[34:08] for they are actually a part of god
[34:11] hallelujah
[34:12] and god can't be deceived about himself
[34:15] and so
[34:16] you cannot be deceived about your real
[34:19] self
[34:20] hallelujah not what we present to man
[34:23] and man can see on the outside but you
[34:26] knows you in the inside
[34:30] you are known better to your own self

[34:37] and calls you by your name praise
[34:40] god hallelujah so our names
[34:44] if you are his one of his elect
[34:48] your name is written
[34:51] in the lamb's book of life from before
[34:55] the foundations
[34:56] of the world but was hid
[35:00] in the book sealed
[35:03] in that book glory to god hallelujah
[35:08] but this great r has come to us
[35:12] that was predicted that it would come
[35:16] hallelujah that when the seals
[35:20] are thrown open then
[35:24] the names that are in the book will be
[35:26] made known
[35:28] would be revealed the summit will bring
[35:31] them
[35:32] joy and to other sorrow and deep despair
[35:36] oh praise god the word opens up
[35:40] it reveals the true and the false the
[35:42] black and the white the
[35:44] this that or truth and error it begins

[36:24] know yourself hallelujah
[36:27] amen and annoying yourself you realize
[36:31] you are a part of him that is now
[36:34] revealed praise god when the holy spirit
[36:39] begins to reveal and speak to people
[36:43] hearts like that and they begin to
[36:46] recognize who they truly are
[36:51] then god's spirit begins calling out to
[36:55] them
[36:57] and it doesn't matter
[37:00] look i was in africa
[37:04] preaching the word of god like this
[37:07] to the people there and
[37:10] one young man caught the revelation

[37:41] you know what that young man
[37:45] put it all aside and walked away
[37:49] with god's despised few or
[37:53] bearing the reproach for the name of
[37:56] jesus christ
[37:57] and he was not ashamed and held to

[40:09] god hallelujah
[40:12] now you know names
[40:15] are associated with natures
[40:19] the moment you said tiger tiger
[40:23] is the nature of that beast
[40:27] if you say snake the name tells you
[40:31] the nature not just the name just by
[40:34] the name stands alone but the name
[40:36] reflects
[40:37] and tells you the nature of it praise
[40:40] god
[40:41] hallelujah praise god just like
[40:44] in the church ages the word the name of
[40:46] the church at smyrna
[40:49] smyrna means bitter
[40:52] and that was the character
[40:55] of that particular age
[40:58] just as jacob in the bible
[41:02] his name met supplanter as we will say
[41:06] smart man oh cunning
[41:09] a con man jacob supplanter
[41:13] but when he met the lord god says your
[41:16] name is
[41:17] no more jacob commands a planter
[41:21] or anything like that your name shall
[41:24] because
[41:24] israel amen praise god he got a
[41:28] new name praise god god
[41:32] changed his name just like saul
[41:35] saul riding down in the hot damascus
[41:39] sun going down to meet the lord's people
[41:44] to put them next to the sword
[41:48] and there a bright and shining light
[41:52] brighter than the midday sun came
[41:56] down upon him and out of the light he
[42:00] heard a voice saying
[42:02] saul saul why persecutest thou me
[42:07] and there he raised up and said
[42:10] who art thou lord because the light
[42:13] struck him off his horse
[42:15] and he bit the dust like many high and
[42:18] mighty
[42:19] people instead of being humble praise
[42:22] god become humble and walk the way god
[42:25] wants you to walk and do what god wants
[42:28] you to do praise god
[42:30] what is the use of wealth prosperity or
[42:33] knowledge
[42:34] unless it's surrendered to god that he
[42:36] can use it for his glory
[42:38] and for his honor and here
[42:43] his name later was called
[42:46] change to paul for you going to be
[42:50] my light to the gentiles you're going to
[42:53] be a
[42:53] reflection of me of the bright and
[42:56] shining light you're going to be a
[42:57] reflection of that light
[42:59] you will be a light to the gentiles
[43:02] praise
[43:02] god hallelujah and so you see your
[43:05] name bear some impression
[43:10] upon your character that is why
[43:14] i wouldn't name my daughter jezebel
[43:17] i would name my daughter delilah because
[43:20] there's
[43:21] meanings behind names
[43:24] and the names called down the spirit and
[43:28] the nature
[43:29] upon people praise god
[43:32] so friends it's important that we
[43:35] recognize
[43:36] these things amen as i mentioned
[43:40] before we all respond to our names
[43:45] even if our back is turned and someone
[43:48] calls
[43:49] it causes you to look around praise god
[43:53] hallelujah but he knows your
[43:56] the name of his attributes
[44:01] the attributes the genes
[44:05] that were in him before the foundation
[44:09] of the world he knows
[44:12] the names of those attributes
[44:17] psalms 147
[44:21] verse 4 the bible tells us
[44:27] let's talk about job first he says job
[44:29] he says
[44:30] stand up gird up your waist like a man
[44:33] where were you
[44:34] when the morning stars sang together
[44:38] and the sons of god were shouting for
[44:41] joy
[44:41] oh praise god hallelujah now listen what
[44:45] he says in psalms
[44:47] 147 4. how that
[44:50] he tell it the number of the stars
[44:54] he knows the number of all of his
[44:57] children
[44:58] hallelujah of all the stars
[45:01] and he call up those stars
[45:06] by their names hallelujah thank god
[45:10] hallelujah no matter what the world says
[45:13] you're in god's eyes you're a star
[45:16] i said no matter what the world will say
[45:19] to you
[45:19] you're a star and he knows your name
[45:24] for he calleth the stars by name
[45:28] amen praise god amen
[45:31] my friends you know why god calls you
[45:35] by your real true spiritual name
[45:39] though you might not hear it as earthly
[45:42] men
[45:42] would call it a name but you know
[45:46] that it's your spiritual nature
[45:49] your name being pulled attracted
[45:53] drawn by the holy spirit hallelujah
[45:56] glory to god amen
[45:58] why does he reveal your name to you
[46:02] so that we could have recognized and
[46:04] come to ourselves wake up
[46:06] to realize we were living under a kind
[46:10] of a
[46:10] false name you see
[46:14] satan is a a kidnapper
[46:18] and satan kidnapped
[46:21] every single one of us and give us a
[46:25] earthly name of the flesh
[46:29] might be a nice name but nevertheless
[46:32] it's a human name
[46:33] and while we are here in this body we go
[46:35] by that name
[46:37] because that's how we are recognized but
[46:39] i'm just telling you
[46:40] that in god's eyes he knows your real
[46:43] name
[46:44] but satan while you're here it causes
[46:47] you to live
[46:47] under a false name that he puts on you
[46:51] so that you won't know your real parent
[46:54] right and he will give you a name of
[46:57] drug abuser give you a name of drug
[47:01] addict
[47:03] give your name of lust
[47:06] a name of selfishness
[47:10] give you a false name of a witch
[47:13] or wizard witchcraft worker
[47:17] give you a name you pervert
[47:20] perverted give you a name that you're
[47:24] just nothing but an
[47:25] alcoholic which in it is alcoholic
[47:28] demons got a hold of you and hold you in
[47:31] bondage kidnap you
[47:33] and hold you into bondage oh
[47:36] my they'll give you the name of
[47:39] a smoker a tobacco demon got a hold of
[47:43] your
[47:44] life and change you by to him and there
[47:47] you are
[47:48] bound by him put a sex demon upon you
[47:51] and
[47:52] put you into a life of male or female
[47:55] prostitution and living a life like that
[47:58] he could have put a money hungry demon
[48:01] on you
[48:02] and cause you to just be greedy and
[48:04] grasping
[48:05] nothing is wrong with one
[48:09] wanting to better themselves being
[48:11] ambitious having a better life having
[48:14] more money or whatever god will provide
[48:16] you for he promised he would prosper us
[48:19] but the fact is my friends he says
[48:22] you've got to put god
[48:23] first seek first the kingdom of god and
[48:26] all
[48:27] other things will be added on to you
[48:30] and we surrender all we are all we ever
[48:33] you ever found my friends that a lot of
[48:37] poor people are high and mighty and
[48:38] stuck up with themselves
[48:40] and they're really rich not those who
[48:42] think they're rich or maybe a little bit
[48:45] rich
[48:45] they begin to be pompous and arrogant
[48:48] and think of themselves high and mighty
[48:50] and they're real humble people
[48:53] the real really wealthy you know
[48:57] like warren buffett
[49:01] still plays drafts or dominoes
[49:05] with his friends dressed in
[49:08] ordinary worn-out clothes
[49:11] on the side of the street down in the
[49:14] town that he lives in
[49:16] and if one were to pass by they'd never
[49:18] know
[49:19] who he was
[49:22] think of it praise god
[49:27] right in jamaica
[49:31] i was in a bookstore and michael chin
[49:34] was in there
[49:36] buying magazines
[49:39] and i didn't recognize who he was at the
[49:41] time began talking with him
[49:44] uh about the uh magazines that were
[49:47] there
[49:49] and only when he started to
[49:52] walk away then i recognized who he was
[49:56] went around his business so humble
[49:59] and so simple you would not recognize
[50:03] who he is you're really wealthy
[50:07] never carry themselves in that kind of a
[50:10] haughty way and whenever they do
[50:13] they're not really anybody they have no
[50:15] character they have no real self
[50:17] my man they're not dedicated anything
[50:20] else but to
[50:21] money and to self oh my friends
[50:25] so it is that we respond to our
[50:30] names that god knew his attributes
[50:33] by that are a part of this word
[50:37] hallelujah and so there's an association
[50:42] between our name
[50:46] in the book of redemption and our
[50:48] natural name
[50:49] and that's the fight paul was talking
[50:52] about between the natural and the
[50:54] spiritual the flesh and the spirit the
[50:56] inner man and the outer man
[50:58] and so on that's not my subject today
[51:01] but that's the fight that goes
[51:02] on because the names carry nature
[51:06] with them amen praise god hallelujah
[51:10] amen when the newborn comes really comes
[51:14] into your life
[51:15] you less and less respond
[51:18] to to that old name of that old
[51:22] nature that false name that worldly name
[51:25] that the devil tried to put on you that
[51:28] all
[51:28] kidnapper all the word comes and frees
[51:32] you
[51:32] and you break your chains you're set
[51:35] free by the power of god
[51:37] your walk out of the devil's prison
[51:39] house oh my god thank god i am free
[51:42] i'm free from this world of sin i've
[51:45] been
[51:45] washed in the blood of jesus christ and
[51:48] i'm now born again hallelujah
[51:50] i'm saved saved by his wonderful grace
[51:54] brother sister aren't you happy today
[51:57] that you can say i
[51:58] am one of them glory to god hallelujah
[52:02] i thank god and praise him and
[52:05] magnify him for what he has done
[52:08] within my life glory to god
[52:11] thank god he calls us
[52:15] by our name adam
[52:19] adam where are you
[52:23] the bible tells us in the beginning of
[52:25] the bible the book of genesis
[52:27] god called adam hallelujah
[52:31] and god is calling you oh

[52:38] same spirit from the beginning of the
[52:40] world is here again

[52:47] calling out to you to know him in the
[52:50] power
[52:51] of his resurrection
[52:54] hallelujah i'm so glad
[52:58] that in this day when they're hearing
[53:02] they're stealing people's identification
[53:06] or identity on
[53:09] uh in computers and in the digital realm
[53:13] and many people
[53:15] have to go and struggle to get back
[53:17] their real
[53:18] identification and even so
[53:23] is the devil stealing your real
[53:25] identification
[53:27] and giving the entire world a totally
[53:29] different
[53:30] impression of who you really are but the
[53:33] holy spirit of god is here
[53:35] to set every captive free for the lion
[53:39] of the tribe of judah will break every
[53:42] chain
[53:43] and give to us the victory again
[53:47] and again glory to god hallelujah i'm so
[53:50] happy
[53:51] that he the great one is here with us
[53:54] glory to god here's a poem
[53:58] written by a brother anointed by the
[54:01] holy spirit
[54:03] hearing this thought about he
[54:07] knows our names there once
[54:11] was a woman who came to a well
[54:14] to quench her thirst
[54:19] by reputation she was considered
[54:23] the worst on that day
[54:27] she found more than water
[54:31] for she met the savior
[54:34] of the world she left town
[54:38] with one name for water
[54:42] but they were surprised when she
[54:45] returned
[54:46] with another
[54:50] that's what she said and here is what
[54:53] she said when she returned
[54:56] my name is sanctified and holy
[55:00] call me the righteousness of god
[55:03] i am now known as the new creation
[55:07] my nickname is i am covered
[55:10] by the blood i was hell-bound
