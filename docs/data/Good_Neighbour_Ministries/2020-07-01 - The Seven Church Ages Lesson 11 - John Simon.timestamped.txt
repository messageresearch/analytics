[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening my precious friends it's
[0:17] good to be here again
[0:19] may the Lord richly bless our study and
[0:24] the teaching of the word of God tonight
[0:29] I will talk about the Atmos vision
[0:35] let us pray as we come into his presence
[0:39] with joy with grace and with
[0:43] Thanksgiving may the Lord lift up his
[0:47] countenance upon you and cause his face
[0:50] to shine upon you and grant you peace
[0:54] now and forevermore father we ask your
[0:58] divine blessing upon this service here
[1:03] tonight and may the Great Holy Spirit
[1:07] anoint the word of God from our hearts
[1:10] into the hearts of our hearers of our
[1:14] listeners may the spirit of grace may
[1:18] the Spirit of Almighty God send the
[1:23] arrows of his word to the hearts of his
[1:26] beloved we ask it in the name of Jesus
[1:30] Christ amen and amen
[1:35] reading from the wonderful book of
[1:38] Revelation chapter 1 from verse 9 and 10
[1:45] for I John who also am your brother and
[1:51] companion in tribulation and in the
[1:55] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ who
[1:59] was in the isle that is called Patmos
[2:02] for the word of God and for the
[2:06] testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the
[2:10] spirit on the Lord's Day
[2:13] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[2:18] a trumpet
[2:20] thank God John was on the Isle of Patmos
[2:28] now what can we learn from his stay him
[2:35] being on this Isle of Patmos first of
[2:40] all the Apostle John of course received
[2:43] a marvelous series of visions while upon
[2:49] that Isle of Patmos and these visions as
[2:55] our focus as believers as the Church of
[2:59] God as the Bride of Christ our focus
[3:03] should always be on the Lord Jesus
[3:05] Christ himself his person his glorious
[3:10] marvelous and wonderful person
[3:13] so John received these visions and these
[3:18] visions were all about the person of
[3:24] Jesus Christ now we know that John was
[3:31] banished banished to this Isle of Patmos
[3:36] which was a small island about 30 miles
[3:40] off of the coast of Asia Minor in the
[3:43] Aegean Sea a rocky and infested place
[3:51] with snakes lizards and scorpions all
[3:57] around - the Roman Empire it had no
[4:02] commercial value so it was used by the
[4:06] Roman Empire to house and hold prisoners
[4:13] it was a penal colony
[4:17] just like Devil's Island it was a penal
[4:20] colony for the Roman Empire
[4:25] that time where they held most of their
[4:31] desperate criminals political criminals
[4:37] were all held there
[4:40] now we noticed that John in speaking to
[4:47] us addressed himself to Christians as
[4:53] brothers in tribulation of course he is
[4:59] referring to the fact that he was not
[5:02] the only one that was undergoing trial
[5:06] tribulation persecution suffering but
[5:11] that he was made an example to other
[5:15] Christians by being placed on this Isle
[5:18] of Patmos for it was in that time that
[5:23] Christians were being persecuted
[5:27] persecution was on the fires of him were
[5:31] burning hot the demons of hell with the
[5:36] three-pronged forks were out pricking on
[5:40] torturing the minds the bodies and the
[5:45] spirit most of all the faith of the
[5:50] believers were sorely tested as they
[5:53] served the truth and the Living God
[5:56] their faith was evil spoken of
[6:01] everywhere within the Empire the people
[6:06] who held to this Christian faith were
[6:09] being imprisoned they were being killed
[6:13] tortured men women children who ever
[6:17] held a name of Jesus Christ as I was in
[6:22] the nation of South Sudan during their
[6:29] Wars during the 90s to this time I
[6:35] believe while there
[6:38] in one of the camps the war was going on
[6:43] bombs could be dropped at any turning
[6:46] warring militias could plan attack
[6:51] villages towns at any moment especially
[6:55] coming from the north
[6:57] and these believed are there a crescent
[7:04] moon prophet was the one that they came
[7:10] down with that faith to attack the
[7:13] Christian faith now we see during that
[7:18] time a meeting was called in which I was
[7:23] privileged to be in there was there was
[7:28] Catholics they were Anglicans they were
[7:31] Lutheran's they were a Nazarene belief
[7:34] they were Baptist they were seven day
[7:37] Adventists they were all kinds of
[7:40] denominational beliefs gathered there
[7:44] together as one in Christ and the reason
[7:49] why that when the invaders came down
[7:53] from the north they were not asking
[7:58] whether or not you were Catholic you're
[8:01] Adventists you were Methodists or
[8:03] whatever you want as long as you bore
[8:07] the name of Christ or you carry the
[8:10] cross or believed in the blood of Jesus
[8:13] Christ
[8:14] you were target and was instantly
[8:18] assassinated and taken to pieces chopped
[8:22] to pieces in those days the point I'm
[8:25] making is that regardless of what
[8:30] straight what part of Christianity that
[8:35] you're a part of what part of the Church
[8:38] of Worldwide Church of God that you are
[8:41] regardless once you name the name of
[8:45] Christ
[8:46] you were instantly killed and so is it
[8:50] anyone that named the name of Christ in
[8:54] those days were immediately in prison
[8:59] persecuted tortured and put to death
[9:05] now John like many others that's the
[9:09] reason he included himself not that
[9:12] because he was an apostle he was
[9:15] excluded or he was of a prince of the
[9:19] church so he was of course a kept out of
[9:24] that and know my friends God made him an
[9:28] example to give heart to the other
[9:32] believers to hold the faith of God
[9:37] firmly in the in the lights of it in
[9:40] their hearts so here it is
[9:42] arrest him and trade the trade in van to
[9:49] kill John then they tried to kill him by
[9:55] boiling him in a pot of hot boiling
[10:00] frying oil but plead forgot that boy is
[10:05] a type of the Holy Spirit and John was
[10:10] placed in that pop of oil for 24 hours
[10:14] and they kept boiling and boiling and he
[10:17] was not dying and dying or screaming and
[10:19] shouting but like Daniel in the lion's
[10:22] den Daniel prayed to his God Daniel sang
[10:28] the songs of Judah and of Zion and give
[10:31] glory to God for his God would
[10:36] protecting him for he was in the line of
[10:39] service now it's periodic for someone to
[10:42] just jump into a pit alliance or or
[10:46] dabble with snakes because the Bible
[10:49] tells us that he will protect us now
[10:51] you'll be provoking God
[10:53] to do such a thing of your own but while
[10:56] in the line of duty and of service God
[11:00] watching over his own and protecting his
[11:04] children my brothers the Lions became
[11:07] like a pillow for Daniel sleep in the
[11:10] night and this pot of boiling oil was a
[11:14] type of the Holy Spirit and if John
[11:18] understood that John must have felt
[11:21] comfortable in the middle of that boil
[11:24] and like Hugh Latimer and Master Ridley
[11:28] in England were the burning flames of
[11:33] the bonfire run them when they were tied
[11:37] to the stake take heart take courage mr.
[11:40] Ridley we will light up a light of pale
[11:46] here in England that shall never be
[11:49] pabout and the light of Christianity
[11:52] still blazes in that land
[11:55] it still is a light across the world
[11:58] because those that went before us paid
[12:01] the price they paid the price for there
[12:04] is a cost to any true Pentecost and the
[12:08] Holy Spirit protected them and provided
[12:12] a way out form their tribulations there
[12:17] it was John for 24 hours boiled and when
[12:22] after 24 hours yet he did not die there
[12:27] were even more enraged instead of them
[12:32] recognizing that the hand of God was
[12:34] upon the servant of the Lord
[12:36] they got morin and raised and angered
[12:40] that they could not kill him and these
[12:44] powerless officials then sentence him to
[12:48] badness as a of some kind of a witch for
[12:51] the equipment understand how he could
[12:54] live in a boiling pot of oil which he
[12:59] should have been afraid in an instant by
[13:02] it but remember God
[13:06] with him as God is with us in our trials
[13:10] in our troubles in our desperations
[13:13] in our depression or oppression my
[13:16] friends he said I will never leave you
[13:19] nor forsake you but I'll be with you
[13:23] I'll be with you to the very end of the
[13:26] age I'll be with you as he was with
[13:30] Daniel and the three boys in the fiery
[13:33] furnace God will be with you as the
[13:36] first man in the fire as with you in the
[13:41] trial in your tribulation in your dark
[13:44] darkness of despair he will Bitchie be
[13:48] with you you are never alone for he said
[13:52] I will never leave you nor forsake you
[13:55] but I'll be with you to the very end of
[13:58] the age Oh comfort Oh what consolation
[14:03] Oh what joy to know that we can walk
[14:07] with him and then he my friends has
[14:10] brought himself to our lowest state to
[14:14] walk with us to think that the King on
[14:17] Isle only better can walk hand in hand
[14:21] together a nice road led by his mighty
[14:26] hand and protected by his prevailing
[14:30] power made a great holy spirit Saint
[14:33] this within our souls and within our
[14:35] heart and give us a confidence and a
[14:38] certainty that we can stand up upon our
[14:41] feet get off of your knees stand up on
[14:44] your feet
[14:45] rise and try again and know that our God
[14:49] is with you every step that you did so
[14:53] he was speared and he was allowed to
[14:59] leave the island of Patmos and returned
[15:04] to his pastor rate of the city of
[15:08] Ephesus the church in Ephesus where he
[15:12] continued as pastor until the time of
[15:17] his death
[15:18] no John of course I believe if if I'm
[15:23] correct John love's the only disciple
[15:27] that actually died in his bed a peaceful
[15:31] death in this bed know all the others
[15:36] every one of them parish might fire by
[15:41] sword or by some form of a horrible her
[15:46] if ik death but John whom Jesus spoke to
[15:52] love died upon his death bed as an old
[15:57] man now these visions that John received
[16:00] was over a period of about two years
[16:03] from eighty nine to five and eighty nine
[16:08] to six and of course they're among the
[16:10] most remarkable visions found within the
[16:15] boundaries of God's Word now this book
[16:19] of Revelation may I say by the words of
[16:23] the Prophet revelation is a book of
[16:27] symbols it's a book I and I see of God's
[16:33] system of paragrafix you know the old
[16:37] Egyptians wrote their books their signs
[16:41] were all done in word pictures and this
[16:45] is what God did in this book of
[16:48] Revelation giving us symbols signs
[16:52] prophecies being expressed in the form
[16:56] of signs and symbols to us so that we
[17:00] may recognize what he is doing in the
[17:05] years to come the things that were going
[17:09] to be that these things would be clearer
[17:13] to us for a picture is better than a
[17:17] thousand words now remember here that
[17:21] this book as I've said is also a target
[17:26] of
[17:26] the system much speculation a book of
[17:31] dispute however this book has the seal
[17:35] of God upon it it has the missing of God
[17:38] upon it blessed is he that readeth and
[17:41] to him that understands and he didn't
[17:45] ear to hear let him hear what the Spirit
[17:50] of God is saying to the churches the
[17:53] church ages what God is saying and
[17:56] speaking and unfolding by his word now
[18:00] this book is authentic this book is of
[18:04] tremendous value of course to all of us
[18:08] who read it or listen to the reading of
[18:12] it of the sacred pages for the scripture
[18:15] says that clearly blessed is he that
[18:17] readeth or he that hears the word of
[18:21] this book so you are blessed right now
[18:23] even listening to what you are hearing
[18:26] this a blessing of God is coming upon
[18:29] you while you are listening to what you
[18:33] are hearing for this is the word of God
[18:36] now as we have said what can we learn
[18:40] from John's time upon this Isle of
[18:45] Patmos remember here John said in the
[18:51] word John revelation 1:10 I was in the
[18:57] spirit on the Lord's Day and heard
[18:59] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[19:05] listen to that phrase Johnson I was in
[19:09] the spirit friends here it is we are now
[19:15] learning from John state on this Isle of
[19:20] Patmos about the importance of the
[19:24] reception of revelation that we must be
[19:29] in this spirit and the atmosphere of the
[19:33] Holy Spirit to be able to receive
[19:37] revelation from the presence of Almighty
[19:40] God so we must be in that atmosphere in
[19:44] that attitude of being in God's Spirit
[19:49] to be able to receive revelation now why
[19:54] are we as believers believe that clearly
[19:56] in God's Word we understand friends that
[20:01] some want to be in the fish the believe
[20:06] by going through the actions the motions
[20:10] of the human freshly manifestations
[20:15] which they may call the Holy Spirit that
[20:18] that will give them revelation but
[20:22] listen to what the Word of God
[20:25] 1st Corinthians 3:1 to 6 and I brethren
[20:30] could not speak unto you as spiritual
[20:34] but as Carla even as unto babes in
[20:39] Christ I have fed you with milk and not
[20:42] with meat for hitherto you are not able
[20:47] to bear it
[20:48] neither yet now are you able for you are
[20:53] yet carnal for where as there is among
[20:58] you envying and strife and divisions are
[21:04] you not carnal and what is meant for
[21:08] white one set I am of Paul I am of
[21:13] apollos I do not carnal who they respond
[21:18] and who is Apollo's but ministers by
[21:23] whom you believe even as the Lord gave
[21:26] every man I have planted and Apollo's
[21:31] watered and God gave the increase in
[21:39] Galatians chapter 5 if you
[21:41] turn with me verse 13 to 21 for brethren
[21:50] you've been called unto Liberty only use
[21:53] not Liberty for the occasion to the
[21:58] flesh but by love serve one another for
[22:03] all the law is fulfilled in one word
[22:06] even this thou shalt love thy neighbor
[22:09] as thy self for if you bite and devour
[22:14] one another take heed that you be not
[22:18] consumed one of another this I say then
[22:22] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[22:26] fulfill the lust of the flesh for the
[22:30] flesh lusteth against the spirit and the
[22:34] spirit against the flesh and these are
[22:37] contrary one to the other so that you
[22:41] cannot do the things that you work but
[22:44] if you be led on the spirit you are not
[22:48] under the law now the works of the flesh
[22:52] are these adultery fornication
[22:56] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[23:00] witchcraft hatred variance emulations
[23:06] wrath strife seditions heresies envyings
[23:13] murders drunkenness revellings and thus
[23:19] the such length of the which I tell you
[23:22] before as I have told you also in times
[23:25] past that they which do such things
[23:29] shall not inherit the kingdom of God my
[23:36] friends if we are going to live as
[23:39] Christians we must live in the spirit
[23:42] and walk in the spirit John was not
[23:46] talking about being his own spirit
[23:48] worked up in his own spirit but he is
[23:50] talking about being under the anointing
[23:53] of the Blessed
[23:55] holy spirit no it has to be the Spirit
[23:59] of God that will come upon you and give
[24:02] you the wisdom of God the revelation of
[24:05] God not the knowledge of man but the
[24:08] revelation knowledge of the Living God
[24:11] now we realize in John chapter 15 1 2 5
[24:16] Jesus says I am the vine you are the
[24:18] branches furthermore he says with out me
[24:22] you can do nothing without the Holy
[24:25] Spirit anointing you and lightening you
[24:29] teaching you guiding you witnessing to
[24:31] you warning you this great Holy Spirit
[24:34] is the one my friends without him we are
[24:38] powerless and we can do nothing for it's
[24:41] not by might nor by power it's by the
[24:45] Spirit of the Living God working within
[24:48] your heart and in your life so it has to
[24:52] be the Spirit of God and John gave him
[24:55] revelation and it has to be that same
[24:58] spirit of God on us that will also give
[25:03] us revelation therefore Paul said our
[25:06] efforts will be freshly and there will
[25:10] be in vain but if we run the spiff we
[25:13] are in the spirit then pray in the
[25:16] spirit live in the spirit sing when you
[25:22] sing sing in the spirit when you worship
[25:26] worship in the spirit if you live walk
[25:30] with Him that by him and live in the
[25:35] Spirit of God all friends if there is
[25:38] anything good that will come to us then
[25:41] it has to be revealed by God's Holy
[25:45] Spirit it has to be confirmed by the
[25:49] Word of God and made manifest for by
[25:54] their fruits or by the fruits and bears
[25:57] you will know whether that's the spirit
[26:01] of Almighty God or not to receive these
[26:05] from men
[26:06] revelations it will take the same spirit
[26:10] to give it up gave it to come back and
[26:13] be here with us to reveal it is this is
[26:16] just plain we can see it clearly the
[26:20] word was given by inspiration
[26:22] it must be received by inspiration given
[26:26] by revelation to men of God
[26:29] People of God now it must be also
[26:32] received by revelation by the same
[26:35] spirit that gave it for God is his own
[26:39] interprete and he will make it plain now
[26:43] so then we see friends we need the
[26:47] spirit to be unbe able to understand
[26:50] these marvelous revelations of God that
[26:53] God has given to us to live by in and
[26:57] through his word now in that chapter 2
[27:00] verse 38 Peter tells us clearly repent
[27:04] and be baptized every one of you in the
[27:07] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[27:09] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[27:13] of the Holy Ghost amen see so if you
[27:17] want to receive the Spirit of God to be
[27:20] able to receive revelation you must
[27:24] first repent you must come to God and
[27:28] repent of your sins and be baptized next
[27:34] in water the correct way in the name of
[27:37] Jesus Christ said Peter be receive him
[27:42] confess him be baptized in water in his
[27:46] wonderful name the name of Jesus upon
[27:50] your spiritual marriage certificate or
[27:54] praise God for evermore and God will
[27:57] fulfill his word my friends by filling
[28:01] you with wisdom and understanding
[28:02] filling you with the Spirit of God the
[28:05] Word of God gone up with a shout in a
[28:08] blaze of fire the pure fire with back
[28:12] restored within your heart and within
[28:14] your life praise God
[28:17] yes sir Oh France so pray the God for
[28:21] the revelation of God by His Holy Spirit
[28:25] get in the spirit now we see here the
[28:28] Word of God says clearly to us that if
[28:31] we need anything from God whatever it is
[28:34] we need to get in the spirit if you need
[28:36] healing then you understand do these
[28:40] things according to God's Word first ask
[28:42] God for your healing ask God for your
[28:45] deliverance secondly call for the elders
[28:49] of the church as the Bible said simply
[28:53] obey the simple word of God as simple as
[28:57] it sounds call for the elders of the
[29:00] church confess your sins the Bible says
[29:06] confess your sins before your even
[29:09] prayed for for confess your sins to God
[29:13] let the other the Church of knowing you
[29:16] with boil which is a symbol of the Holy
[29:19] Spirit upon you and let them pray over
[29:24] you and not just say a prayer like that
[29:28] but the Bible says that the earnest that
[29:31] the sincere prayer the earnest prayer of
[29:36] a righteous man availeth much with God
[29:40] hallelujah that is what we need and when
[29:44] we follow God's program God's plan laid
[29:48] out in his word my friends that your
[29:51] answer welcome your answer will be right
[29:55] there
[29:56] it may not be immediately but your
[30:00] answer will come for God is unfailing in
[30:05] his word and he will fulfill it now you
[30:09] see brother Simon what do you mean about
[30:12] getting in the spirit getting in the
[30:15] spirit well you know my friends that out
[30:18] there
[30:19] we understand amongst people human
[30:23] beings we go to the baseball game
[30:26] go to the football games we go maybe to
[30:30] a basketball game or hockey game or also
[30:35] some people go to parties or they'll go
[30:40] to a dance I like that but think of it
[30:44] when they go to a ballgame a party or a
[30:48] dance they don't just sit around all the
[30:52] time but they're trying to get into the
[30:55] spirit of the atmosphere and the
[30:58] attitude of that game or that party or
[31:02] that dance did getting into the spirit
[31:05] when there is a goal scored my god
[31:11] whether it's football whatever they're
[31:13] in a great shock they'll throw their
[31:16] caps in the air they're then just
[31:19] shootin hummer
[31:21] their team is winning and when our team
[31:24] is winning we need to get in the spirit
[31:27] on holler and shout and praise our God
[31:31] and give glory to his wonderful and
[31:33] marvelous name Oh glory to God but many
[31:39] times a lot of believers want to sit us
[31:42] wallflowers well they want to sit in
[31:45] this in in the seats of spectators and
[31:49] they want to sit as if they're just
[31:51] observers my friends but we are not to
[31:54] be observers or spectators God calls us
[31:57] to me participate errs we ought to be in
[32:00] god's spirit rejoicing night and day as
[32:04] we want the narrow way for the hand of
[32:07] God upon our lives we see and the reason
[32:11] for all this is the reason for bliss
[32:13] hallelujah is that the comforter has
[32:16] come to stay within her heart the double
[32:20] peace has found its nest upon thy altars

[32:27] rests with us and walks with us and
[32:30] talks with us within our hearts every
[32:34] day for they that
[32:36] the sons and daughters of God led by the
[32:40] spirit of the Living God in other words
[32:43] if those people can enter into the
[32:47] feeling and atmosphere that they are in
[32:50] how much more we as believers as
[32:54] Christians shall get into the feeling
[32:56] into the spirit and the despair of what
[33:00] we are in by the presence of God but of
[33:03] course Satan hates that Satan hates that
[33:07] and he thinks that he hates the people
[33:10] that behave like that that that acts
[33:14] like you know

[33:30] you you're too manly and cultured to do
[33:33] that my friends let me tell you where
[33:36] the Spirit of the Living God falls on
[33:38] the true believer regardless of color
[33:41] culture race status stature stratus

[33:48] is the leveler to meet the high places
[33:51] low and the low places I hi

[33:59] into harmony beautiful composition by
[34:03] the great director of the supernatural
[34:05] symphony of the Spirit of Almighty God
[34:09] making it all work together to bring
[34:12] forth the music of the cosmos the music
[34:15] of the spheres that's the music the
[34:18] harmony and the beautiful timing of the
[34:22] Blessed Holy Spirit working within the
[34:26] life of the believer

[34:46] wonderful more admiration for the
[34:49] presentation and the personality and the
[34:53] beauty and artistry of the theology and
[34:57] stuff that my friends get away from that

[35:07] with the sheep skins on I tell you it
[35:11] that they'll even throw Paul out of the
[35:13] pulpit if you were to come back today
[35:15] then that one reject they will reject

[35:25] world the only degree he he had was a
[35:28] big experience born again by the Spirit
[35:31] of the Living God and walking under the

[35:42] hatred what he sees people coming back
[35:45] to the original face of God moving
[35:48] within their heart if they hate it

[35:53] feeling that the kinds of creates that
[35:57] feeling are upon them that they can't
[36:00] stand that they don't want that that
