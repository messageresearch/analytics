over and over again to where then when you get in a situation you're not hoping anymore but you know that he going to come on the scene and I think that's that is the interpretation of when when I think it was Peter that said Rejoice through all your trials at the beginning you're shaking in your boots hard to Rejoice but after a while you begin to say he's going to come on the scene the he is the answer he is going to come on the scene he is going to fix this up he is going to work on this he's going to do it and you have full confidence and the longer it goes the more more sure you are

circumstance no matter what the situation there's someone that can speak one word and Everything Changes Everything Changes the master of the wind is with us this morning and I'm excited about being in the house of the Lord praise God God bless you Saints thank you so much worship team we certainly appreciate the atmosphere amen praise God makes it so much easier to uh come and stand here in this awesome place because it is an awesome Place Saints um to be in the presence of the Lord and to um know that uh he's he's absolutely in control of everything every situation um we come here this morning with uh a great expectation in our hearts I'm just as much under expectation as you are because it's never easy and especially just been through um you may be seated for a minute I'm going to just make a few comments um you know every year uh with the nurseries it's a very intense time throughout the month of May every year you think that you know by the time like by the time I'm now finally through the the the peak and the and the the real pressure it just comes off you know the pressure comes off and you feel oh I can do this I'm okay you know but when you're actually in it it's like you don't know if you're going to get through the next hour okay and that's how it is to be you know um in the front lines as a son or a daughter of God when you're under the pressure and I experience that every year and I think you know um I'm okay that I can do it and that I'll remember and then you get to the beginning of May and all of a sudden it's like everything is all new again and you've got to re you know remember so much and as you get older it's not easy and so by God's grace I got through another month and I'm here by God's grace you know um don't get enough sleep the body takes a beating like never before and every year it just gets tougher and tougher you know um but uh you know God's grace I can tell you I I feel the supernatural element of God and I experienced it more than ever before and I know why because he's placed me into this position amen I know that if God puts you into a situation or into a position he's also going to give you the faith that you need in order to fulfill his purpose remember our lives we can look at our lives and you know we can all look at each other's um lives and and look at you know how God has built you and designed you the work that you do the person and the personality that you are God designed you in that way for his purpose and we need to accept that realize that you know sometimes I I get criticized for my you know for my character in certain ways you know because God built me in a certain way and I can't help it right and and when you're in the respons when you're a respon you know uh the responsible uh person for your business and I've been you know I've been the president I've been the pilot the CEO of fantasy Fruit markets for over 36 years and and I think okay you know what I'm just going to you know pass this on to somebody else and I start going in my mind into certain people and I start thinking okay I can just pass to them or pass it's like giving somebody an F18 that they've never sat behind the instruments and say fly this thing yeah okay and I realize that because now I I get into that into that cockpit and I fly it and it seems natural the moment that I try to put somebody into that it's like it's one crash of after the other and and it's not easy and but I know that God is is going to you know certainly raise a standard in every aspect because it's just the same as God putting me into this position I'm scared to death every time I come up here because I I I want to know that that you know that the people's needs are going to be met I'm not up here to be a personality I'm not up here to to stand and and bring my own thoughts and my own ideas I realize that the supernatural God that called me has also called you amen and that together we have a purpose and a plan and God wants to fulfill that purpose and like I said all of us are built different we're placed into different areas offices and positions and as long as we can recognize that God has put us there then we can rely on him to bring us through to give us the faith to take us through to take you through to give you the word that you need for today I believe God has a word for you today but you have to come with that expectation in your hearts that you want to receive a word from the Lord amen amen praise God and so I thank you I know all of you were praying for me through the month of May I I I I felt your prayers I know the prayer you know The Prayer Ministry I would you know I would certainly let them know and they and I could feel it I could feel myself being strengthened when when I was breaking down when I felt I didn't have the energy anymore when I all of a sudden something would come over me and my wife would wonder and she'd say to me how you you're going you're going to go do that you I said I yes and I feel good right now I feel like I have the energy to go and do it and so I know that that is only because of God's grace and your prayers and and the fact that we are a body and that we have come together and I believe God is going to take us out of here together and if we join our faith together and we support one another another and respect one another's positions and offices we are going to see the supernatural take place in this ministry in your personal individual lives and in mine amen praise God so um before we go to the word how many loves our new set of shoes brother Gabriel what do I mean by a pair of fresh shoes the parking lot you ever you you ever notice your home after you seal the driveway it's like you got a brand new pair of shoes

let's change the order glory to God let's all stand let us pray father Lord we're excited about what you're doing Lord we know that we can do so much as human beings we can give of our time of our efforts of our finance but Lord when you give faith and you come into the midst of your people and you speak to us one word it changes everything Lord it changes our atmosphere it changes uh the people around us Lord it changes everything father it g it brings health and vitality into our bodies into our minds Lord this this time of worship lord it's like therapy the people don't realize it Lord but when we assemble ourselves together in this way Lord people want to stay home people don't think they need to gather they need to come into your presence in this way Lord It's because when we come into this atmosphere of worship we get delivered Spirits move and they they they can't stay in your presence Lord and we get delivered we get set free our minds are restored our our our memories are reset Lord everything uh in our bodies even our our atoms and our molecules are changed and reset Lord by the anointing of your spirit and your presence and so we just welcome you here this morning Lord and we ask that you would pour out like never before Speak Lord these words father these quotes this these scriptures Lord you're the only one that can bring them to life to each and every individual won't you grant it today Lord and and and just go beyond our own abilities Lord take absolute control father and we so look forward to the meetings next week Lord you know everything

of the people even even each and every one of us as we serve Lord May there be great Deliverance grant that we pray father take control now in the name of Jesus Christ and for your glory amen and amen praise God all right let's go to the slide amen praise God today we're we're um we're uh kind of we're still moving on you know like with with the thoughts that we've been bringing you know um over the last several months and we realize that that it's the Holy Spirit just progressing us but we're now you know the Lord you know laid this thought on me this week and it was just constant you know and and and what it was was the the he he just said the fullness of the Gentile bride age and that was just running through my mind and that was the thought that I started to work on and I started to search and research and read and and and listen to the messages and so forth and and I believe that you know that it's all still in the same line and the thought that we've been you know bringing it's recognizing your day it's all about recognizing your day it's about recognizing Christ in the present stage of his ministry amen so let's go to the first scripture praise God Luke 21: 24- 28 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring father we ask your blessing upon the word may you take control now in Jesus name amen praise God you may be seated you know um just in in reading this scripture here you know like uh back on April the 28th you know we ministered on signs in the heavens and you know signs of the times and you know um you know I know there was probably a little bit of rumbling that may have gone forth as a result of of bringing that message you know uh because there was you know pictures and you know there was a picture of of of a cloud that that I brought that the Lord you know spoke to me through and you know these are these are signs and wonders that God is doing in this day and people might say oh what brother Danny or trying to make himself something or or or show something that you know uh that's that's uh you know aside from no no no no absolutely not these are things we need to recognize that that the message of the hour is in each and every one of us and God is still speaking personally to each and every one of us amen God has placed me into this position as the pastor of this church I am not responsible for other churches I am responsible for what God lays upon my heart to bring into this local church and to anybody that would hear it they have a choice to accept it or question it or whatever that's not my concern these are things things that that God laid upon my heart to bring to you I when I look back and I realized you know all that that was uh you know in that message on April the 28th I look back on that I came to realize that I could have never put that together I couldn't have put the timing of all those things together I realized that it was the spirit of God that was interceding and doing something that was making himself his life his life his present stage what he's doing in the body of Jesus Christ this is our local body amen this is where God is speaking to us this is where God is perfecting each and every one of our faith and this is where God has placed you under this ministry if God spoke to you through that message then then praise God receive from it I received message mesages from people in Florida that were immensely blessed and were fellowshipping people message people that they said oh praise God you know God is he's still the same God he's still the same yesterday today and forever we know that the cloud that came down in 1963 had a supernatural existence and and and and purpose and and reason and and we're the we're we're the manifestation of that we are the living manifestation of that cloud but he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen he still can make himself known he could walk into here the pillar of fire could come right into this room and hover right over that scripture if you wanted to and make it totally fully visible to each and every one of us God can do something with an individual that's standing right next to me but because it was not for me and it was for him he receives what God wants to give to him in other words it's not for everybody but it's For Those whom God has chosen to reveal himself in the Simplicity of his word of his word and the Simplicity of speaking to you by Revelation amen what you have need of Amen praise that was just a side note as I read this I said praise God let the Lord have his way amen let's go to the next scripture acts 13:46 to 49 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you now here he's talking about he's speaking to the Jews he's speaking to to to Israel there okay but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles well you know that's all about recognizing your day and its message amen that's all that you know recognizing what God is doing in your day recognizing the signs in the heavens recognizing the signs with what's going on with Israel right now recognizing the war that's taking place recognizing how all the Gentile nations are starting to come against Israel how this is all coming together you you need to recognize that this is prophecy this is Vindicated prophecy these are things that are being Vindicated by the word of God for this day and for this hour amen praise God but but for for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region hallelujah praise God I believe God's got a people right now on earth that is publicizing that the the word for this day and for this hour that God is still calling God is still perfecting I don't know if that Gentile age is over it just might be it could very well be but there's some that still need a little perfecting there's still some that need some Perfection let's go and read this um next scripture for I would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in and so here we are now we're in a time and in a season where you know Israel is in a condition that it's never been before I believe it's on the Brinks of a supernatural Awakening I believe it's it's uh it's it's a time in a season right now where the Gentiles are coming into into especially the Gentile Bride for this age she's coming into her fullness and when she comes into her fullness then Israel's got to come into their Awakening Israel has to come into their full awake I I believe they're experiencing the strength the supernatural inspiration that God is giving them to press the battle just like us we've been pressing the battle we've been overcoming the the enemy he's been he's been fighting us left right and Center in this message and you're going to feel it more than ever before you're going to feel the pressure of people not wanting to accept you your message what it is that you stand for which is the word of God it's Christ in the present stage of his ministry they're going to reject that they're not going to be able to receive it they're going to say well what you're better than us no we're not better than anybody Jesus when he was on the earth and those disciples receive the word of the Lord they were rejected by the majority of the people am they couldn't help seeing what they saw they couldn't help seeing that this is the Messiah this is the word made flesh this is the word in our day this is what this is what the prophet said was going to happen and here it is but yet they Israel and and all of the high priest they were blind well there's a there's a darkness that is over the land right now like never before I believe back in April when that Eclipse took place and and and and total darkness came into America once again it was God vindicating and showing that this this nation that that the Gentile Nations have gone into total darkness I believe there's there's there's absolute Darkness that's come over the people and now the the the the the the nation of Israel under great bombardment is feeling the pressure of of the Gentile Darkness because when darkness will listen when you Corner a rat when you Corner somebody when you Corner something that's evil they get vicious ious they start to get vicious they start to look at things and all they see is red they want to kill they want to destroy and and and the whole system is being designed in such a way that with this gross Darkness that's coming upon the people they're fighting up they're they're they want their rights they wantan to they want to they they want control and now they're looking at everything in a in a combined way they're they're joining forces with Darkness yeah amen because the light is so so slim listen to brother brandom here in recognizing your day and its message everywhere now there is no Revival everybody is complaining ministers crying I was reading one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church a very fine paper and I know the editor I know the people and they are godly people very fine Brother and Sister Moore of the herald of his coming and one of the finest papers on the field Herald of his coming but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet get how many reads it you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there is a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people why is it why have they done they have not recognize the Awakening of the Bride The Awakening of of the church the bride is Christ in female form in this last age glory to God they haven't recognized see by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's being done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you and this is the condition of the church world out there and and we with the light of this hour with the word for this day and for this hour we're out there expressing and saying you need to recognize Jesus Christ today you need to know that that that his word is real now and your tradition and your teaching and your understanding of God's word is based on tradition just like the Pharisees back in the days when Jesus was on the earth here the word stood right in front of them the word was made flesh and yet they all they wanted to do was go back to their tradition go back to what they were taught what they interpreted how they interpreted the word they couldn't see that the word was actually being interpreted in their day so that they could recognize the hour that they were living in praise God and so um we see now here uh in in the message recognizing your day the Gentile church for this hour must come in into a mature full revelation of who she is you need to come into the fullness of the word for your day your position because as you do that you correlate exactly with what's going on in the world with Israel as we become more mature as we become more uh um aware of who we are are and take our positions in Christ everything out there that's going on starts to make more sense everything starts to correlate between the two and so you represent Christ and the Gentile Bride for this age and you must come into your fullness how that happens is by feasting on the word of God by gathering around where the carcass is where the fresh Mana is being preached not tradition not by just uh you know play and Obey just go to the tapes you all you got to do is listen to the tapes no you need to listen to the tapes and you need to feed on the present stage of Jesus Christ in Bride form bringing the word of God through a five-fold Ministry you need to be in the presence of the living Living God where you meet God face to face where you have experience face to face with God on a daily basis hallelujah praise God you know when you take a look at Israel and you look at the current situation you you see that America is backing Israel all right now the Arab states are friendly with Israel okay because there the Arab states are also like Egypt and all of them they're they're also uh being friendly in that they are you know um kind of supporting in in in a in a indirect way though they are muslim okay they're supporting in an indirect way uh what's going on because they need the protection of the Americans okay just like uh uh those Arab states and Iran they hate one another they're not they're they're they're they're the same in in that they they both uh you know worship Allah but they have their differences and their differences cause it's just like a lot of religions out there even Christian and different Protestant churches and you know Jehovah Witness and this and that you you you know you meet some of the people and you can sense the that they don't like you they hate you you know there's a there's you know even though you you might you might have the same religion and you might you know both say Jesus Christ but one makes Jesus Christ another God one in three gods and you're recognizing that that it is God right and and so there's a difference there and that difference brings a hatred right but what's important for us to understand is that the enemy the enemy is looking to destroy Israel regardless of whatever the differences are in what might be appear Hamas the hoodies all these different terrorist organizations they all have one purpose and that is to destroy Israel and the enemy the devil that's fighting us through all these different Avenues of of you know whether it's New Age movement whether it's you know teachings of higher levels of consciousness and making yourself you know a part of the universe and you don't need Jesus Christ these are all avenues that are trying distract us from the word of God Amen and people are being distracted by it in the world today they're being distracted to be looking at all the wrong things so that they don't look to the word of God but you're the only one that just brings them back to the word but wait a minute how were you baptized I was baptized in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit when I was 6 months old I said but that's not what the scripture says but that doesn't matter matter my parents did it and that's how they did it and that's how they teach it so that's good enough for me Well when things really hit the fan and they're starting to really come and hit the fan you're going to realize that your tradition was not going to be enough to get you out of the mess that this world is going into it's going into Great Tribulation and without the spirit of God which can only be received by obeying the word of God by coming God's provided way which is repent as an adult recognizing that you're a sinner and being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin that's God's mercy in your life just a gift of God to wash you from your sin then you are then you are uh open to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and it's the spirit of God that's going to Quicken you and give you salvation you don't get salvation any other way than by the spirit of God there is no other name whereby man must be saved by but by the name of Jesus Christ amen it's as simple as that and so we need to realize that all of this that's going on is all the spirit of iniquity it says in in in 2 Thessalonians for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now leth will let until he be taken out of the way to let means to prevent God's only lets the devil do a certain amount of damage and a certain amount of of uh of uh you know interference in your life but let me tell you when God wants to give you a revelation and set you free it's done amen there's the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against what God can do in delivering you and setting you free uh breaking the chains of tradition breaking the chains of drug abuse breaking the chains of pornography breaking the chains of of uh uh uh re Rebellion breaking the chains of of of mental illness something that is taking control of the people Minds like never before trying to possess the minds of the people giving them saying it's okay you have a a form of mental illness so you just need to get some psychology yeah you do need some psychology you need some neology you need some theology in the word of God you need Jesus Christ who is the savior and the Redeemer now don't get me wrong I don't want to people to say oh you're you're you're bashing the the psychologist no they're needed more than ever right now otherwise it's total chaos out there but you have a choice you have a choice you can come to Jesus Christ you can come to the word of God you can come to the supernatural deliverer I am a witness of that there are many witnesses that are in this place that are out there that can that can that can stand and say he delivered me am he set me free amen he took away that addiction He restored my family He restored my relationship because it takes three to make a real solid marriage it takes the man the woman and you need to invite the Lord into your life so that he can Bond it with his love amen praise God there's no other way that you can have total peace and total Deliverance in this world they're looking for every possible Avenue and they're thinking that because they can go to the psychologist on a weekly basis they're going to get their fixed that's no different than just taking a Tylenol for a headache the headache comes back again and you got to take the Tylenol again and so you know it's it's more like I would rather get total Deliverance amen I believe in a God that said I am the Lord God that Health all all your diseases and when he heals it's done it might take longer than you want it to take it might be embarrassing for a while because of the situation but you stand on the word of God and you stay there until God proves his word you're not proving his word God is proving his word in you you're not getting the glory god gets the glory when he heals you when he delivers you when he set you free that's what we're looking for amen but this Spirit of iniquity is working in the land and it makes people feel Justified well I can do this I can go there I can I don't need to go to church you need to go to church you know it's been proven that people that go to church and worship not people that go go to church and fall asleep people that go to church and worship and praise God and say Amen praise God I believe it I receive it they get Deliverance am you you can go into a PS you can go into a a a psychiatrist room and he'll tell you go ahead and yell and scream all you want get it out or you can come into the house of the Lord and rejoice around the fact that he's your deliverer that he's your psychologist he's your doctor he's your physician he's your surgeon he's he's everything that you have need of and when you Proclaim it and you accept it things start to happen in your life you don't look anymore at what other people are saying I remember listen when God wants to deliver and do something and he does it for you and he does it and you know that he did it you don't care what anybody says am you're going to tell it just the way it is you I'm going to tell you brother listen I was right I I walk up listen i' I've talked to cocaine addicts I've talked to people that are in that kind of situation and I tell them straight up I said you want to you want to be delivered from that and it happened somebody came into this church years ago after a mother called me and said Danny you know I remember your testimony when we had dinner with your wife and I got a son that you know that's that's hook to cocaine would you talk to him I said of course but will he talk to me she says well we're going to try to set it up and we're going to try to make it happen I said okay well just let me know and she called me about a month later and she says okay can you come over at 5:30 he's going to be coming over and you can talk to him I said sure my wife and I went over he didn't show there was a phone call and she's there and she's trying to why aren't you here I said leave him alone I said when the time comes if it's meant to happen he'll come just the fact that you have you know in my mind I said just the fact that you have poured out and you have reached out because something in you was revealed in your heart that that's a reality what happened to that man and so it was a few months later I got a call and she says he's ready he wants to see you I said all right I'm coming and we went there and just like nothing I didn't get into oh Jesus going to deliver you that's not that's not Christianity no no Jesus walked into the house and he seen that the the girl was dead he said everybody out says don't need any unbelief here and he just went and laid hands on that girl and breathed the breath of life back into her and walked out I stood there and I said how you doing we talked for a while we got into discussion and then I started to give my testimony on how God did this and then I started naming certain things and he was going wait a minute I'm 33 years old you were 33 when God delivered you I said yeah he says oh and then he says wait a minute I'm my wife's name's Jennifer your wife's name is Jennifer I said yeah I said come to the house of the Lord and he came here and he received the word of faith for his Deliverance he got baptized and up until last week he's still out on the streets preaching Jesus Christ amen that's his ministry God delivered him supernaturally to that he'd never look back to that drug that I know of and he's out there and he was at our garden center there a couple weeks ago I was talking to myself brother Tim to you know showing us how he's reaching the people on the street and how he shows them about the cross and how he brings them to Jesus and how he gets people right there and prays for them on the street and screaming and yelling and praising God I said fantastic I said God bless you God bless your ministry that's what God has placed on your heart continue to do it amen what are you going to do thank you Jesus that's what God revealed to him and so when when when the supernatural comes on the scene and does these kinds of things you don't have to worry God is going to prove and vindicate his own word you don't have to prove anything Hallelujah glory to God and so you know we read here in Romans 11: 25 and we're just going to go back now to our thought for I for I would not Brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits the blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in and so here now God is bringing a bride to maturity we are looking around the condition of the world it's never been in the condition that it's in God is starting to do a mighty work right here in the midst and he's bringing a bride into full maturity so that she can be uh you know so that she can recognize listen to brother Brandon and recognizing your day he says you know the Jews were blinded for the very purpose that we could have sight you know God God's purpose in blinding Israel was to call his Gentile bride amen they were torn apart they were scattered as a nation and rejected their Messiah uh that that we might receive the Messiah that there might be a people called out of the Gentiles for his name's sake that's why we we receive the name of Jesus Christ we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ we pray in the name of Jesus Christ because he is our husband we have taken his name amen now the man comes forth and the woman takes his name there it is these blinded Gentiles who can't see that name the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism it's just too bad but it has to be that way the Jews they had to they had to not see that there is only one can see it that's the one who is predestinated to see it you're you're blessed this morning God has given you eyes to see amen praise God they the only ones that have been that have been uh given to see it amen the Jews otherwise you'll never see it the Jews could not uh could not uh see that being their Messiah and yet they were Scholars and theologians Men of great renowned scholarship read the same Bible that you read now after it's been made known to us we can see it plain that was Messiah but they couldn't see it neither can they see it today they are prophesied to be blinded too the church this day is prophesied to be blinded to reject the evening time message Revelation said so Thou Art wretched miserable notice the bride's condition the other night or the church naked blind and don't know it Lord Jesus be Merc merciful to us the Bible said she was naked I never saw it till just now Leo Dean church was naked and when she appeared the other night she was naked never noticed it and didn't know it oh how thankful how no wonder we are so grateful I feel that that we're not grateful enough for the things that God is making known to us naked and the vision said told me she was naked and she didn't know it and blinded as Israel was blinded so that the Gentiles could come in now the Gentiles are blinded so the bride can be taken out and Israel can receive the Feast of the trumpets just perfectly after two days he will revive us or give us a Revival bringing us together the Jews speaking on these trumpets now and he shall and we shall live in his sight or have eternal life see we'll be in his sight the Bible said here in Hosea said and we shall live in his sight life have life in his sight that's his own life eternal life have life in his sight she that lives in pleasure is dead while she's alive so we promis that Israel again would have life in his sight she's been dead to the facts and to the Pentecostal Feast so Israel since Pentecost has been blinded to see the Messiah to recognize the word for this day and for this hour but listen God has preserved a remnant of Israel did you know that Israel is going to be awakened Israel is coming into such a a fullness of pressure and and and the Dynamics that are now starting to come together worldwide with the Gentile Nations and and and all of the the enemies of Israel it's putting such a pressure on them that it's going to bring out the time and the season that Israel goes into her Spiritual Awakening but guess what happens before that the Rapture the bride she comes into her full Awakening but listen here look it God's preserved a remnant of Israel for three reasons we're just going to look at them briefly here number one to glorify his sovereignty God is Sovereign and last you know and and he said here in in Romans 11:25-26 lest you be wise in your own sight you know we as Gentiles we're seeing all of this that's going on but let's not get lifted up thinking that we're anything that just because we recognize and we see and we know that our eyes have been opened because you know what darkness is coming upon the Gentiles now gross darkness is coming upon all the Gentile churches a lot of them are saying oh yes this is prophecy you know Israel is supposed to come under this pressure and and it's because we the Gentiles are coming into our fullness and the Gentile dispensation is going to be over and we're going to go into a Rapture they have that General you can go on YouTube and you can listen to a lot of these teachings but then you listen closely and they're trinitarian they believe in Jesus Christ the son the Holy Spirit as another entity and then the father as another entity and so they they are off the word and though they believe that they're with the word and they believe that they're going to see The Rapture they believe that that you know that that part of the prophecy they don't realize that they're actually under blindness that there's a gross Darkness that's come upon the Gentiles Romans 11:25 so the you know uh I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery Brothers a partial blinding has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in so here we are now we're coming into our maturity this bride needs to recognize who she is she needs to realize that she's in a in in the Gentile bride age now we're not under the message uh you know the message age that that that all the message churches are proclaiming out there and oh you just got to listen to the tapes you know if you don't listen to the tapes you're lost all of those things no God is calling out a people out listen listen we're in the bride age listen to these quotes here God is calling out now watch from the from the Rapture message now we find here that Enoch was the seventh from Noah which was a type of the church age now all of the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured the seventh showing that it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture though we are still under the leodan seventh Church age Naturally Speaking okay but spiritually speaking listen now he goes on here now the seventh Church age that's that's takes the Rapture all of the other six died but Noah was translated because he was not found God took him but Enoch raptured was a type of all of the rest of them dying but the end time bride will be called out of so in this seventh Church age there is a bride that's being called out of it there's a lot of them that are still in it they're still living in it they're still living under the seventh Church age messenger not realizing what when the seventh Church age messenger went off the scene the mighty Angel himself came down in 1963 and I had to decrease so that he could increase brother brand said and the Bible became a whole new Bible because the Bible now was to be opened to the bride age to the elected for that age that was going to be called out of the seventh Church age why didn't the Rapture go under the messenger of Malachi 4:5 because the Rapture doesn't go out under the me under under Malachi 45 the messenger the man it RS out under the supernatural anointing of the mighty Angel himself coming down speaking to us right here from this Pulpit from other pulpits that are anointed by the word for this hour that have recognized that Jesus Christ is now in bright form speaking the word calling the resurrection calling her to her position to recognize come up hither it's time to receive your change amen you got to recognize the dispensational changes that are taking place and if you don't see that we've come out of the mess age because it's a big mess right now you got all kinds of different personalities and all kinds of interpretations on the word of God it is never to be privately interpreted the word of God God is his own interpreter he will make it plain God will vindicate one day one morning sometime by 9:00 in the morning sometime around then we're going to be changed and we're not going to show up for work that day and your family members are going to be looking for you and they're going to wonder wait a minute here what happened yes what happened was everything that we said was going to happen that Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry he would take a people he would he would supernaturally change their lives pull them out of sin and unbelief pull them out of their doctrinal teachings pull them out of their out of their tradition pull them out of their father's teachings and their priest's teachings and their teachers teachings and their new age teachings and bring them into the mystical body of Jesus Christ in this day thank you Jesus look what he says here he says there's going to be he says in the first seal then Along come the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they cabbaged down on that now there cannot be no more ages that's all of it that's the Philadelphia or not the leod Dean age but then we found in the studying of the scriptures that the messenger to the age come right at the end of every age at end of the age every time so when brother Brenham came to the end of his ministry in 1965 between 1963 and 1965 that age was ending the age was coming to an end of the of the of the of the the man messenger man age but it was moving into the son of man a continuation of the son of man Ministry which was The Headstone coming down to meet with the bodyall and that has to be recognized as the supernatural element and the time and the season that we're in right now which is the bride age the body of Jesus Christ so here now he says now he says that's all of it we found in the studying of the scriptures Paul come at the End of the Age we find out that ireneus come at the end of of the age Martin End of the Age Luther end of the Catholic Age and what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the End of the Age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother brandham was the messenger Messenger to the Pentecostal Church age amen praise God but then the mighty Angel himself comes on the scene to progress and take us into the bride age which is the rapture age which is the body change age which is the fullness of the Gentile bride age which is going to bring the Perfection to Israel so that she can be lifted out of her blindness everything is weighing one with the other everything is is in God's perfect timing we want to put a timing on it we want to interpret it but God is interpreting it right here right before our very eyes we've never been in this situation where Israel is at the Brinks right now they're meeting right now about resolutions that that the US are saying that this has there must be a ceasefire I it'll be interesting how it all plays out that's all I can say because they're not dealing with man they're dealing with God they're dealing with the prophecy of God's word you know just before I go to a couple of more quotes here I want to read this about 100 years ago Frederick the great the king of pra was having a discussion with a chaplain about the truth of the Bible the king had become skeptical about Christianity largely through the influence of the French atheist voler so he said to his chaplain if your Bible is really true it ought to be capable of a very easy proof so often when I have asked for proof of the inspiration of the Bible I've been given some large to that I have neither the time or desire to read people want to give a big read this and it's this thick and nobody wants that if your Bible is really from God you should be able to demonstrate the fact simply he says give me proof for the inspiration of the Bible in a word the chaplain replied your majesty it is possible for me to answer your request literally I can give you the proof you ask for in one word Fred was amazed in this response what is the magic word that carries such a weight of proof he asked he turned and he said Israel Israel you go back it started with Israel God's promises started with Israel all of the world's problems Wars situations they've all stemmed back it all started right back in the Middle East with Israel that was that's something that we could never get away from just in the same way Israel is the natural proof of God's word the church and the bride is God's Supernatural proof that he is alive and that he is well amen praise God glory to God I just found that to be interesting because it all ties in with the thought here we we listen we're talking about recognizing our day and by recognizing our day we need to stay tuned into world events we need to recognize the things that are going on around us and we need to see how it pertains to us and all the the last week and a half all God was was putting on my mind was the fullness of the Gentile bride the fullness of the Gentile bride and then I looked it up and it all tied in with the fullness of the Gentile bride it all tied in with Israel everything ties in with the full when the Gentiles come into her fullness when we come into our completion when the last one is perfected and and called into the body of Christ then we go and the two prophets come on the scene and they're the ones that are going to go and preach this same message that Jesus Christ is the Messiah and they're going to receive the very same message that we're preaching here and we've been listening to for all these years we heard a prophet that would that God sent to us in the 20th century and all he could say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament amen the Lord thy God is one amen praise God hallelujah so here he says now he says at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church and brother Brenham was told to go back to Jeffersonville to open those Seven Seals God was going to open those seals because in those seals would contain rapturing Faith so that a people could be revived listen we needed Revival uh listen we're still under Revival I'm feeling the Revival of this message right now it's running through my bones amen glory to God it's what's keeping me it's what's it's what's giving us a future it's what puts fear in the back burner it it has no power over us anymore because our future is clear amen amen because we've been given a word for for this day and for this hour amen glory to God listen modern events made clear by Vindicated prophecy in 1965 we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age he says he says see we're not living in a Methodist age we're living in another age he says we're living up here to the bride age that's what he says hallelujah the calling out of the church and the getting it together for the Rapture Hallelujah Glory that's what this is doing that's what this word is supposed to do it's supposed to call people out and to bring them in and when they come in they get perfected by the word of God they receive the word for this hour you don't have to drive message books down people's throat that's not what converted me that's not what converted a lot of you it was the supernatural Touch of Jesus Amen it was his love when he expressed his love to you and he opened your understanding and he gave you the ability to see his word and to receive him and then get delivered from those things that were binding you the chains of circumstance the chains of depression the chains of Oppression all those things that are holding the people out there there's a way there's a way out people it's called Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen glory to God he says we're living in a bright age and calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture he says that's the age we're now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth this was in 1965 because in 1963 when that seventh seal opened it didn't just open for you and me it open for brother brandham too it awakened him he says my God it's a brand new Bible everything's brand new he says glory to God and from there he went and preached messages who do you say this is a greater than Solomon is here here why because he recognized that the mighty Angel himself had come he preached Christ The Mystery of God that was the seventh seal being preached the fullness of the seventh seal was preached under that message Christ The Mystery of God because Christ the mystery the whole mystery is that Christ is in you amen is in me he's quickening us he's taking us he's already snatched us from the world he'll take one he leave one what do you think he's already done he's taken you he's pulled you out hallelujah praise God what a time it is that we're living in he says here something like a calendar you look at a calendar to find out what day of year you're living in and you look at God's Bible to see what age you're living in we're not living in the Methodist age we're not living in the Baptist age we're living in the bride Age The Calling bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in thank you Lord Revelations 108 to 11 oh thou must prophesy again the word of God

proving his word he's letting the world know that I can take a people I can take multi-millionaires and I can take them right off off the street I can take what I want and I can make them declare my name they shall know that I am their God and that they are my people glory to God amen glory to God listen here 1965 God's only provided place of worship and remember remember how we just went through the church ages the messenger to the church always comes just at the dying of the other Church age always Oh Glory to God I believe there's an another dying going on I believe there's a lot that are being left behind they said they want to stay in their tradition they want to hold on to those tapes they want to just just they don't want to let them go they just no no no no they don't want to let them go but you got to let go of everything glory to God Amen I was telling my wife you know this this week we had to put down our little Maximus you know it wasn't easy we had to put down our dog that's been with us for 16 years but you know God just gave me a simple Little Dream the morning that we had to do it and it was enough it finished everything for me I Had a Little Dream and I was looking at Maximus and he was looking at me and he was a puppy again and he was and it was like he was speaking to me and I could understand what he was saying to me and I woke up and on that day we had to put him down but I told my wife I said it's all good I said listen God is never going to let us suffer okay he's going to give us faith for whatever we come into and I said we need to let go

every question aren't you glad thank you Lord glory to God he says always comes just at the dying of the other Church age always the dying of the Pentecostal brings forth the rapturing of the Bride Hallelujah see the ding of Luther brought forth Wesley see the dying of Wesley brought forth Pentecost the dying of Pentecost will bring forth the message for this hour and he was living in it at that time and he was the wave sheath and here we are and he thought the Rapture was going to happen then and here here we are 60 what is it 62 years or 6 I don't know 6 whatever and here we are and it's closer than it's ever been Saints it's a lot closer than it's ever been amen glory to God and people begin to gather back together there's Unity there's power see and whenever God's people get together completely I believe the Resurrection will take place then there'll be a rapturing time when the Holy Spirit brings brings and begins to gather it up that'll be in the minority of course but there will be a great Gathering it'll be in a minority hallelujah praise God Amen now we find out he says here in I'm G to I'm going to close here let the musicians come identified Christ of all ages now we find out that now we find out our Pentecostal Brethren are living in the glare of a Pentecostal age I believe that there's some that are living in a glare of the mess age all they can see is William brandham William brandham Brother brandham William brandham we see him too and we will never not see him you can never take him out of the equation just like you can't take Joseph you can't take Abraham you can't take Isaac you you can't take all the the prophets because they all are a part of the word of God they all make up the word but who is the word it's Jesus Christ the self-existent one Elohim we are his attributes we are portion of God and we are going to manifest the portion that we are but he will always be the one that's on the scene he says now they're living in the glare of the Pentecostal age and they still miss they're trying to interpret the Pentecostal age when we're Plum past that he says we're living up to the rapturing time for the coming of the end time amen that's the age that we're living in may God bless you and give you something from these thoughts this morning may you go back into the daily activ activities with a strength to know that
