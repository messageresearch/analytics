[36:52] we start with yes
[37:03] [Music]
[37:24] [Music]
[37:31] [Music]

[38:56] [Music]
[39:11] Jesus Christ ourselves foundation or
[39:27] faulty foundation to the tracking
[39:30] anything all this thing is go to our
[39:32] right you know you take the chance with
[39:35] a practical foundation no doesn't work
[39:47] like that
[39:48] and when you're building foundations you
[39:50] can select the fit like like failure or
[39:54] like the denominations you can go fixing
[39:58] him try to make pretty good slide and
[40:02] straw and cut corners you know
[40:19] [Music]
[41:04] [Music]
[41:07] it's not just what you literally can
[41:10] just return on a listen
[41:13] most times when you are going into the
[41:17] state of equal weight that most of the
[41:19] stuff is able to slip up with your
[41:21] subconscious and down with them so when
[41:24] you are conscious of it so it's not by
[41:27] by any kind of effort
[41:32] [Music]
[41:54] work memory of something here for the
[41:57] profit or a message in the background
[42:00] being played it's just just you know
[42:04] your sphere filled up with praise God
[42:07] it's still coming to your soul and we're
[42:11] building that foundation
[42:13] and that's why we skimpy with it amen
[42:16] praise God hallelujah so I really want
[42:20] you to understand these truths that will
[42:24] change your life so that you can enter
[42:26] in and enjoy God's plan for your life
[42:30] and not I don't wanna raise the church
[42:33] of Christians all the church are uptight
