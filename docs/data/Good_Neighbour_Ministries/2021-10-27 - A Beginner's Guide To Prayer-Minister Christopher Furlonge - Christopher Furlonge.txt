youtube lord father may your grace continue to be a rest and abiding our hearts for your honor and for your glory in jesus name we pray amen amen i'd just like to take a little quote reading from our prophet amen from the message expectation what man calls great god calls foolish and what man calls foolish god calls great so what we've got to do is get back into the program of god and find out after all what god's god wants us to do amen and the only way i know to do it is pray amen prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in control of the human being there's no atomic bomb bomb or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as spread amen and our prophet encourage us pray is the engine of the church so why don't and prayer brings god's blessings so why don't we pray pray pray amen and tonight i just want to just go into our let's study a beginner's guide to pray amen hallelujah next slide please the first thing we are going to learn we are wired to pray amen your creator design you in a way that prayer seems natural everybody in the world prays amen muslims praise hindu praise everyone prays every religion they have some form of be a prayer amen hallelujah even the 80s he prays amen amen even though he deny god but punch him in his stomach the first thing he's going to say oh god he's going to cry out to god amen hallelujah everybody prays in every culture now who they pray to is a different matter but we as christians we pray to the only true and living god and his name is the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah there is a natural desire in every human to pray in fact what that what makes you a human amen praise god animals can pray they don't pray humans pray because god created us in his image amen hallelujah so there in every heart human being there is a desire amen to reach out to this great supernatural being out there and our prophet put us puts it to us when the deep calls to the deep the deep cutter respond so there's got to be a god out there for us to go to to call out to amen and that god responds to us when we call out to him hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name sly trip amen the bible says in ecclesiastes 3 11 it says god has planted eternity into the human heart amen that means you have an eternal soul amen you're gonna last longer amen hallelujah you're just gonna you're not gonna just be here for a little short period of time god is telling you there's an eternity ahead of each and every one of us amen who doesn't want to live amen the main reason why you take our next breath is the day you want to live so there is a deep desire into every human heart they want to live why you go to the doctor why you go to the hospital when something wrong with you you want to live so god's saying there's an eternity ahead of each and every one of us hallelujah praise god so it gives us a natural desire or drive amen to know that there is more than just this life amen hallelujah thank you lord jesus so there has to be a god god wired us to look for him amen hallelujah and god wire us to talk to him man so what we're teaching at tonight is a it's a little guide for you for how you can reach out to this creator to this god amen hallelujah and in the next 40 days amen myself and all the other brothers who's going to be continuing in this study amen by the end of it you're going to be a prayer warrior amen hallelujah we're going to do just the basic things amen hallelujah of how to reach out to god it's not difficult when you when you look back at it you're going to say you mean to say this is what it's all about amen hallelujah everyone prays at some point in their life amen hallelujah slight floor please the second thing that we will learn is that we're not very good at prayer amen and all of us know that we can do better amen in fact we feel inadequate about it i don't really know what to pray i don't know how to pray and i don't know how to say it amen i don't feel confident in fact many of us feel we are not confident about praying publicly if i call any one of you up here tonight to open us up and pray or pray you're going to cringe you know why because we don't feel that we we we sufficient we if we're good in self we don't have that that confidence inside of us amen to pray and pray good nice fluent words and all this kind of thing right so we feel that we inadequate amen hallelujah i couldn't do that i won't know what to say amen and feel insecure and inadequate about your prayer life you won't even pray in front of other people while you're having a meal you know hallelujah no god doesn't want you to feel that way for you to feel inadequate like your prayers are second class and they have no good at someone else's prey you're trying to compare yourself oh that person would real could be real good enough i can't really reach up to them stand at the pray amen but in all of this we will we will teach you amen and guide you amen how to pray and at the end of this series amen you will be different amen see we don't want to cheat we want to change one person at a time this is our motto in church in this in this ministry amen changing one person after a time and if it just just benefit one person i know it's going to benefit each and every single one of you those that are here listening and those that are out there hallelujah praise be to our god thank you lord jesus hallelujah the fact is i've never met anybody who taught that they were outstanding in prayer they have a master's degree in prayer amen all of us can do better in our prayer life each and every one of us amen hallelujah thank you lord we're not a professional in praying no matter how long you've been with the lord we know we can do better in our prayer life amen hallelujah and my two hands are raised up we all can do better in our prayer life amen hallelujah it's like five next slide please the greatest christian who ever lived next to jesus himself was saint paul and hear what saint paul said amen and if you take a look at the screen in romans 8 26 he said we don't even know what we should pray for no how we should pray man and that's in our bible have you ever read that it's right here in front of us tonight amen that guy who wrote half the new testament he's saying we don't even know what we should pray for and we don't even know how to pray so we're all in the school of prayer we all are learning amen hallelujah we all need to learn if paul said it's okay for you to admit i need to do better at this amen hallelujah i need to know how to talk to god amen i need to learn the language of prayer excuse me the disciples that jesus had hand picked to follow him for his entire ministry they did not know how to pray in fact they said slide 6 please luke 11 1 says one day jesus was praying in a certain place when he had finished one of his disciples said to him lord teach us to pray amen that's an amazing thing they watched jesus pray and they said teach us to pray no he is the amazing thing no he has the amazing thing about this these 12 were privileged to watch jesus do everything he did while he was here on earth amen saw him do all kinds of miracles amen heal the people raise the dead turn water into wine walk on water do miracles cast out demons amen all kinds of amazing supernatural things and not once did they ever ask the lord teach us how to do miracles amen and then they heard jesus teach great sermon on the mount amen the greatest teacher in history the greatest preacher that was on the ever on this planet man the great masterpiece messages and stories that jesus told that have been studied for over 2000 years amen never once did the disciples say lord teach us how to teach amen instead they said teach us how to pray amen hallelujah so isn't that the key to everything prayer miracles and all these signs and wonders and all these things amen that's coming forth the greatest thing that god has ever read it as we were opening the greatest weapon that god could have given you to fight against our arch enemy was spread amen so we need to learn how to pray amen hallelujah thank you lord you see why because watching the master they knew that all the power behind his miracles and teaching and his preaching was through prayer amen jesus prayed constantly he talked to god the father in the morning the afternoon the evening he set aside himself many times we have read amen and he went and prayed and so behind his power was pray amen and behind every successful powerful christian is prayer amen each and every single one of us need to have a prayer life or a life of prayer amen hallelujah i like that the sinking tonight amen hallelujah thank you lord jesus but as they looked at him they realized that all of the power and all the blessing that came in his life came through a connection with god himself amen so all your success all your power amen you need to be connected to the creator man you need to have a direct connection to him amen a direct line to glory amen that you could call on jesus anytime in any situation in any circumstance and he is more than willing to answer you he's never too busy never amen amen hallelujah praise god praise god so if paul says we don't know what to pray or what to pray or how to pray and the disciples said teach us to pray it's okay for us to feel a little inadequate amen hallelujah god doesn't want you to feel lousy about your prayer life or feel discouraged or you can't pray i don't know what to say i don't know how to say it it's like the little boy right right he recited the whole alphabet because he said he didn't know how to pray you say god you take it and you form words you know my heart what i have need of amen you take you take the alphabet lord and you form words amen and you know what i need amen hallelujah the abcs of christianity amen hallelujah is just believe thank you lord jesus amen hallelujah a third thing slides next slide please our frustration with prayer are caused by our misconception about prayer amen our frustrations about prayer i just don't feel satisfied with it are caused by our misconception about prayer and there is a lot of misconception out there amen there's a lot of phony baloney ideas there are a lot of lies myths misunderstanding legends and misconceptions there is there's a lot of false information that's simply not true and it's probably leaves you feeling guilty god doesn't want you to be driven by guilt amen hallelujah amen he wants you to be drawn by his grace hallelujah man pray is not something you're supposed to feel guilty about it's just a conversation with your creator with jamaica amen you should feel comfortable approaching him no guilt complex amen hallelujah hallelujah amen because he already made a way for you to approach him amen by the blood if you have anything blocking him and blocking you that channel of pareto glory amen he provided a way he had a blood sacrifice for you to forgive you to cleanse you to clean you to make that line clear amen so you can approach him boldly to the throne of grace amen hallelujah and there's no blockage no hinderances amen so don't feel guilty amen hallelujah thank you lord praise god next slide please prayer is not a magic one man it's not like the little stick harry potter has that he waves and all of a sudden circumstances change amen or he is it's not like fairy godmother amen that could change anything into something beautiful amen hallelujah pray is not a magic one amen hallelujah or abracadabra everything change it's not magic hallelujah all of a sudden your life change amen it's not a genie in a bottle where you have a little magical what we'll call pray and you rob it and all of a sudden god comes out and say your wish is my command man god is not your genie god is not your servant you are god so bad we have it wrong side amen you got a role to play amen prayer is not some secret word or some incantation or spell that if you know the right words and you say those special words amen then you get your own way all the time man you come up with some formula amen that it will work if i say you know hallelujah in a certain way or praise the lord in a certain way amen and there's a lot of that out there man hocus pocus a lot of baloney amen hallelujah oh you look at your husband and you say and pray abracadabra and he becomes a great husband oh you said to your wife or you say it to your children or somewhere boss amen and all of a sudden oh they the best prayer is not like that amen that doesn't work amen hoca spokes i got a promotion amen by the way do you know where that hookah's book has come from amen i only learned that today amen it's actually a perversion of the latin in the catholic mass when the priest holds up the bread and say hawk es copas neon i don't know if i pronouncing it correct but it sounds more like hocus pocus that's what happened to a guy that was sitting in the congregation and he couldn't hear very well and he said amen he's saying this is the body of christ in latin that's where hoka spoke has come from some joker in the row couldn't hear correctly what he was saying so he said hocus pocus i'm turning this bread into jesus so the guy went out and he seen a dog he said well i'm turning this cat i just dog into a cat now amen so you see the way that tone come from my my mind prayer is not some ritual words that you see and all of a sudden things change mysteriously or magically amen you see prayer is communion with god himself and you've got to have a relationship with him to know who you're speaking to and amen hallelujah and that way you can speak to him amen like a friend a man like a brother like a husband to a wife man if you know the person amen really well you know how to speak to them amen hallelujah praise god another myth is that prayer is not a fire extinguisher next slide please mean this is like hanging on the wall and there's a sign that says break glass only in case of emergency yeah a lot of people treat prayer like that it's only when they reach an emergency situation in their life amen they're reaching out to pray all the prayers for men are just quickly sending a prayer request you'll never hear from them know anything but only in our emergency situation god is not a spirit iron amen and the pastor and the deacons and the brothers and sisters around you they are not the paramedics amen that only when you reach in a dire situation you're going to call on them you we need to have a constant prayer life lord said he said pray always in the good times pray not only when the bad time is rich is like money in the bank if you don't put it in you can't draw there's no bones you're gonna get bonks check you're gonna draw on something that's not there it's gonna bounce back to you amen so your prayer life you need to put some prayer life prayer oil amen store it up so when your reserves running out you can draw on something hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord praise god they don't pray on good days the only time they pray is when they are in pain or when there is an emergency break in the case of emergency pull it out man you get a crisis in your life amen hallelujah praise god hurricanes come in so let's all pray oh i got cancer let's pray amen my husband about to walk out on me so let's have our prayer meeting we're going to pray him back in or we go pray back your wife in of your prayer the children back in amen hallelujah we need to be praying constantly you mean hallelujah hallelujah and you only use it in emergencies in fact the terminology is often all we can do now is pray you mean to say you come to your last end the last resort is to pray when that is supposed to be the first choice in your life when you're buying the house you're buying the new car amen when you're going on your first date or you're going for your first interview in your job pray it's not when you say well we reject you you can't get this job then you're saying jack you run into this you're putting a request lord you know i need this job lord help me the last resort after everything else failed all friends fail all family feel everything has failed you actually would say no you don't know what to do pray when the very first line of defense is spread we need to establish that into every single heart here and oh yeah amen praise god thank you lord jesus blessed be his wonderful name another misconception is prayer is not a tough war is not a talk of word with god the fact he made god a lot of people think that god doesn't really want to answer their prayer he doesn't even want to listen and that you kind of have to wear go down until he finally gives him amen you keep battering him amen and pestering and praying god please please please please pretty please you're begging and the next step you want to do now you want a bargain with god amen well god if you do this for me i go do that for you amen it's like if amen you beg god amen and your sugar coated so nice sweet words man i will pray a hundred times i will do ten stations of the cross i will walk on my hands and my knees amen you're trying to bargain with god lord if i do this if i say this prayer haley mary or oh my father a hundred times lord you were granted to me god you can't bargain with god amen god is not like in a flea market you try to bargain and barter with him no sir hallelujah praise god you don't bribe him with some kind of sales pitch where you keep pestering until he finally gives him to you no sir praise god before tiger next slide please pray is not a ritual to relieve guilt prayer is not a ritual to relieve guilt some of you grew up with this where you were taught if you sin and if it's a really big sin you have to go to say a certain number of prayers there you go that's not in the bible my friends my brothers and sisters the lord never teaches us that and you could never find that anywhere in this scripture that's man-made doctrine and ideas amen hallelujah it's traditional jesus taught us the opposite amen prayer is not punishment for your sin god paid the sacrifice once and for all you got to accept that sacrifice amen that he made on behalf of you you could never pay repay that never amen because the the wages of sin is death you did we all of us deserve to die god made the ultimate sacrifice to each and every one of us freely he gave his life for you and me amen so it's not upon his prayers not a punishment for sin hallelujah amen prayer is not penance for your sin prayer is a privilege amen hallelujah not a duty it is a joy not some responsibility you've got to pay back because you did something wrong that puts prayer in a whole wrong light it is not a ritual to relieve guilt amen hallelujah in fact jesus repeatedly said don't pray amen prayers that you say the same thing over and over and over next slide please amen hallelujah here amen in matthew 6 7 says this is the sermon on the mount jesus is talking and he said this you should not pray the prayer where you say the same things over and over and over again vain repetition do not use meaningless represent repetition thinking that you will be heard for many words it's all traditional amen all crafting subtle in the church deceiving and lying to the people amen hallelujah praise god twisting their minds amen don't use and don't use meaningless repetitions repeating cliches over and over again like if that to change the mind of god or change you mean hallelujah praise god now during the 40 days of prayer we're going to explode a bunch of other misconceptions and the other brothers is going to be bringing them those things in amen hallelujah amen that have put you under enormous guilt and made you feel like prayer was boring and prayer was a duty we're gonna cover all of those with the truth from god's word what the bible teaches us about prayer amen hallelujah amen praise god thank you lord jesus now today we're going to talk a little bit about amen the fundamentals truth on which everything is you believe about prayer rest so we're going to be dealing with a little bit of fundamental truths amen that we're praying rest tonight amen if you don't get this you're going to see prayer as a duty so listen very carefully amen not as a delight you're gonna see it as a burden not as a blessing if you don't get it amen hallelujah so number one psy twelfth please amen god loves me to talk to him amen say that god loves me to talk to him amen do you believe that amen so many times amen he says it and we cover it we like so many times ask man seek no amen hallelujah god will love to hear from you amen and it don't have to be nothing fancy fancy big words fancy words man hallelujah god loves for me to talk to him and i would quickly add about anything god is concerned about every single thing about you whether it be big or whether it be tiny or small man if god cares about the birds out there the lily out in the field beautiful amen god cares about the little nut how much time he bought his eyes amen god cares about the hairs in your head how the mochi they numbered how about you personally how about your soul amen hallelujah god really loves you amen hallelujah say god loves me amen hallelujah say it again god loves me hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord it doesn't have to be something spiritual you want to talk about you know how to pray about something spiritual man god is concerned about every single area about your life men and a lot of people miss that man when i wake up in the morning amen amen when i lay my head to rest amen god is concerned about you throughout the day and throughout the night when you are asleep he cares about you amen when you're going to work he cares about you amen hallelujah thank you lord jesus blessed be his wonderful name hallelujah and when you really care about someone that means you really love them so god really loves you amen hallelujah when you couldn't even speak or talk god loves you what he told jeremiah when he was in his mother's womb god cared about him and he knew him then what about you and i right now amen hallelujah thank you lord jesus he's interested in all of your affairs don't think he doesn't god is interested in everything about you amen hallelujah you say i love your wife amen then you're going to really be interested in her and everything amen everything she does everything she says everything she needs amen isn't god out like that amen you say every need he gonna supply for you amen hallelujah i'm interesting and knowing about you too god do you want to know about him too amen hallelujah it's not not god god give me this give me this give me this give me give me give me give me give me lord i want i want i want no amen you call me this give me attitude no hallelujah lord i love you lord i praise you lord i worship you lord you have been so good to me lord you are a blessing to me you meet all my needs you woke me up this morning amen hallelujah you gave me strength for this journey for today amen you give me food on my table amen sing this shoes on your feet amen are covering over your head amen i walk from the core man you give you a nice warm house amen why can't we praise the lord amen hallelujah amen you praise him in any way pray and worship thanksgiving amen hallelujah praise be to his wonderful name hallelujah thank you lord jesus another thing where do you think you got interest you got them from your heavenly father all the things that you're interested in where did you get them all your talents all your desires amen hallelujah where did your talents come from amen god placed them inside of you all your abilities amen god placed them inside you to do all these things amen is god gave them to you amen and we got to be thankful for that amen and he's concerned about them even things as knitting and sowing amen as a housewife amen oh it's just an ordinary house right god is interested in you amen hallelujah in rearing your children amen taking care of all the things around only home amen some housewives the workers outside and they walk inside at home and at work out there amen and god is interested in every single thing about you amen hallelujah praise god you got those things from above from your creator amen hallelujah talk to him about the stuff that's important to you what's important to you tonight god is interested in the things that are important to each and every single one of us tonight amen hallelujah don't think he isn't amen hallelujah isn't our isn't your experience interested in all your children up yes our heavenly father we say heavenly father how much more does he cares about us and interested in others amen hallelujah learning how to pray is really learning a language amen we learn spanish we learn french if you want to learn japanese or korean how do we learn it amen we watch others amen why we listen to others amen amen while they're speaking amen when we how did we learn as little children amen how did we learn we heard our parents amen before we could even say amen and it's like prayer amen before you could whisper a word of prayer to the lord and say lord i can't pray but lord teach us how to pray even when you couldn't say one word to him he still loves you amen so why don't we learn how to pray to him respond back and how do we learn to pray by listening to others how they pray amen that's how we learn isn't it amen hallelujah one word two words and then we started the sentences and then it started to make sense amen just like another language amen hallelujah praise be to our living god thank you lord hallelujah first you listen to other people praying you listen to others how babies learn languages they listen to others amen hallelujah they start by imitating amen then they learn on their own and then they start practicing amen what is learning what i was thinking here tonight a beginner's guide to prayer so we learn from others amen by imitating amen hallelujah by following amen practicing and they get better and better at it all the time you mean hallelujah and then you could have a real conversation with your mommy and your daddy amen with papa god amen hallelujah and we would love to hear from you tonight amen lord jesus heavenly father papa i hear some people pray to the lord as their daddy their father amen their papa amen hallelujah amen call out to him amen praise god amen praise be to the lord tonight hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord praise god now let me ask you did you first make sense when you started to to talk and it's like pray it's just like a bunch of uh uh uh words gobble up words amen amen hallelujah but we got alone somewhere sometime we gotta start off somewhere amen hallelujah amen god doesn't wait for you to get a certain level to start loving you and when he wants you to learn to pray he wants you to learn to talk to him amen because god loves for you to talk to him he's not bored by it and he's not too busy to listen to you amen let me sing that song amen he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry man praise god ha praise god he's not going to say oh but here they come again oh boy an extra maker no god is a loving father amen hallelujah amen praise god the fact is when you talk to god there there's no off limits you can talk to him about anything amen hallelujah so what do you need to talk to him about tonight amen so why when you go home while you're on your way home even while you're here tonight whispering your heart lord lord i need your attention on this matter i need to speak to you about this this concerns me and i know you are concerned about it amen hallelujah amen thank you lord you don't have to be talking calling him and to solve the world peace because he said there ain't no peace i know peace until he comes in or change this and change that or things going to get better lord i want this creation to get better i want a country to get better he said it's going to be worse amen so expect the worst for you as a christian you as a believer thing's going to be better for you as individuals amen hallelujah amen he's cares about the little upsets the monkey have even right now what a little heart pain you have right now with a little high blood pressure you think would i let that be taken amen or that little child that given you that trouble at home or your husband or the wife cares all about it and you go talk to him about it and he's concerned about you he's concerned about your happiness he's concerned about your health he's concerned about your wealth he's concerned about every area of your life because he said so i wish above all things that you prosper and be in health amen amen even as your soul prospers amen is concerned about every single area of your life naturally physically spiritually amen hallelujah you can talk to god about everything he's interested in everything and in everything he loves it when you speak to him amen because he is your father amen hallelujah amen in slides 14 please hallelujah in john 5 14 and 15 says we can be confident approaching god knowing that he listen to us whenever we ask him for anything according to his amen so we praying according to his amen hallelujah and when he inspires you and teaches you how to pray you don't promise you know how to pray you know what direction to pray what to ask for amen hallelujah amen hallelujah and in these 40 days amen you're gonna learn all these things amen how to be confident amen of asking for him asking him amen hallelujah praise god and since we know that he hears us when we make our requests amen then we can be sure absolutely sure that he will answer us amen and god answers every prayer we're going to learn that we're going to hear about god answers every prayer there is not one prayer that god doesn't answer amen and you're going to know about i don't want to take away from the other parts amen hallelujah praise god thank you lord i want you to notice a couple of things you might circle this in your verse twice amen we know that he listens to us and we know that he hears us amen that's for sure god always hear you no matter what you say or how you say it amen hallelujah god listens and he hears you because of that it says we can be confident amen in approaching god approaching the throne of grace and mercy amen hallelujah we can be sure that he will answer your prayer amen and in winding this down tonight and closing now remember this is going to be continuing another part amen amen i don't want to be too long it's so much amen but i just wanted to sink in tonight the few little few little areas that we dealt with tonight amen i just wanted to sink in tonight amen hallelujah amen so we have confidence that when we pray god answers amen hallelujah because he is the only true and living god that hears and answers prayer amen hallelujah that means when we pray god says you can pray with no shame you can pray with no fear amen hallelujah hallelujah you can pray with no hesitation amen you can pray with no embarrassment there's nothing you can say that will make god stop from loving you amen hallelujah there's nothing that will embarrass you there's nothing that will cause you shame fear because god loves it when you can talk to him amen hallelujah i love you lord amen i worship you lord thank you lord thank you jesus amen hallelujah god richly bless you all tonight amen hallelujah i like you anthony amen hallelujah do we have any announcements or anything right there brother god bless you saints um just so you know how to use this okay this uh 40-day um workbook on the friday nights we will be covering each of the sessions okay so you'll see in the book there's session one through seven so over the next seven friday nights we will be covering one of each of those sessions every friday night and when you join in on that session you'll notice you know if you look at session number one you'll notice that um you know we did that last friday night with brother christopher and um there was blanks you know it says prayer is an act of and then it's the first one is dedication right and so you know uh there's scripture on that and it gets covered and and the brother that's ministering that night will just kind of exhort for about 20 minutes or so to cover those few things key elements from each session okay so you understand that's how we cover those sessions that are in the prayer book now you'll also notice that you know um after the session there's follow-up you know putting it into practice and then it gives you an opportunity to you know make some notes and you know read it tells you how you know to use the workbook right and then you've got your prayer journal in the prayer journal basically starts from day one and today is day three right actually today would be day four correct because sunday was day one okay so you will basically do your daily journal there's a scripture for that day and then there's some questions on how the scripture uh you know spoke to you and then you write your notes and at the end of that you would write a prayer okay and you can do that with your husband your wife your children you know you can you can do that together on a daily basis if you like okay and it goes through right through the 40 days of um you know of prayer there's a day there's a journal for each and every day a scripture for each and every day and then you'll notice um at the end of each seven day period there's there's sermon notes so you can take notes on the sundays okay and you know what you draw from the services these are the the sundays and the wednesday night services you can put sermon notes in there right for each seven day period okay and then there's other things at the back you know um there's like lots of pages where you can write in prayers they call them the prayer pages there's note pages and then at the very back also you'll find all the key answers to these seven sessions in case you know you forget or you want to find out what it is so you would go to the back and session one it'll tell you prayer is an act of dedication prayer is an act of communication so you can get your answers from the back of the book and then it gives you small group resources where you can get together you know like i was saying on sunday pick four five people that you can connect with you can do it over zoom you can do it over the phone you can do it together at your homes you know and you can do some of the small prayer groups so that's just a quick just a quick you know summary on how we're going to be using the workbook over the next
