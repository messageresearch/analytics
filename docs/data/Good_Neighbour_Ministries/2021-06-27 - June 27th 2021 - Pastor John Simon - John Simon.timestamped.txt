[39:29] to his people and of course you know
[39:33] uh this does not mean speaking just to
[39:36] you that are in here
[39:38] because of our uh broadcast
[39:42] online it's going out across
[39:46] so we hear from nations and africa
[39:50] even from india and
[39:53] europe and islands of the sea
[39:56] so we thank the lord that his word
[40:00] is being scattered abroad as the
[40:02] scripture
[40:03] says the knowledge of the lord shall
[40:05] fill all the earth
[40:08] and the spirit of the lord will fall
[40:11] and we thank god for that today that
[40:14] he's accomplishing
[40:15] his will please god bless you please be
[40:19] seated just for a moment
[40:22] i want to say that um i thank god
[40:25] that today is the my 14th day
[40:29] after having my second vaccine
[40:32] where um of course they say at that time
[40:36] you don't really have to wear a mask and
[40:38] i'm away from you and i'm up here
[40:40] that's the reason why i'm not wearing a
[40:42] mask
[40:43] and i have the freedom to be able to
[40:46] book a light speak the word of god to
[40:49] you amen
[40:51] so just so that you know that we want to
[40:54] give him
[40:54] all glory and praise now we are just
[40:58] going to get to the point preach the
[40:59] word
[41:00] and after the service
[41:04] we would like to make an award and we
[41:07] pray that god you will
[41:08] remain while we do that um
[41:12] at the end of the service uh praise god
[41:16] the sound adjustment would be wonderful
[41:19] we give god
[41:20] glory and praise amen
[41:28] the la one of the last sermons i
[41:30] preached was
[41:32] on uh provoking him in the wilderness
[41:35] in which we touched on the fact
[41:38] uh not knowing that kovit of course was
[41:41] coming
[41:41] but on the fact that um children in the
[41:45] wilderness
[41:46] israel in the wilderness and we will be
[41:49] put in the wilderness and there in the
[41:51] wilderness you'll be on your own
[41:54] you're going to be tested and you're
[41:57] going to be tried
[41:59] as to your own faith
[42:02] and this business you're being kept by
[42:05] the pastor's fate kept by your brother
[42:07] your mother your sister the deacon of
[42:09] the
[42:10] fate always have to prop up the tomato
[42:12] plant
[42:13] that is over bro
[42:16] god is watching for his real true seeds
[42:21] and like brother branham said they look
[42:23] like scrub
[42:24] plants just like weeds but if you notice
[42:29] everything else die and the weeds are
[42:32] there they look like they're dried up
[42:34] just a little rain and up they come
[42:36] again
[42:37] and you have a time to try to kill them
[42:41] off you can't get rid of them but
[42:44] we are sweet seed of god
[42:47] and we thank god for that i was reading
[42:50] last night where he said that seed could
[42:53] even
[42:53] look dead all the pulp
[42:56] flesh on it dead gone and everything
[43:00] but just let that sunshine come out
[43:04] just let some rain fall and that seed
[43:08] gets a resurrection that seed comes
[43:12] to life praise god hallelujah
[43:15] so i'm glad we could be here in the
[43:17] house of god
[43:20] we're together again just praising the
[43:24] lord together again
[43:27] in one accord giving glory
[43:30] and honor and praise to his mighty
[43:33] and glorious name god bless every one of
[43:36] you
[43:37] here in the house of the lord now thank
[43:40] god for this
[43:41] new system that we have a new camera
[43:43] system
[43:44] and uh they're working on it
[43:48] they just had it and they're putting in
[43:51] their time
[43:52] and adjustment so let's pray for them
[43:55] that god will help all the singers
[43:58] everyone realizing that this to put it
[44:01] to good use
[44:03] after a while we'll get into the stream
[44:07] and the hang of things
[44:10] okay praise the lord so we thank the
[44:13] lord for that
[44:14] remember also
[44:18] i'm not ready to let you know that as
[44:20] yet
[44:21] but because of this broadcast a revival
[44:25] broke out in a certain country
[44:28] and in the space of two to three
[44:31] months there are 500 believers
[44:34] that are believing this message
[44:41] [Applause]
[44:44] and have been baptized in the name
[44:48] of jesus christ and as of last wednesday
[44:53] one of those persons was a
[44:56] woman from england who
[45:00] had a place in jamaica where herself and
[45:04] husband will go
[45:05] there and spend six months and then go
[45:07] back or whatever
[45:08] and uh she happened to be in the post
[45:12] office when we sent the first
[45:14] box because before this revival broke
[45:17] out
[45:18] god wanted us to know if you're not
[45:20] you're not doing it you're helping it
[45:22] i'm doing it
[45:23] so they had no books all it was
[45:27] was one or two books that the brothers
[45:30] gave
[45:31] to the one young man who had
[45:35] driven for about three or four hours
[45:38] to their hotel room
[45:42] because he saw them with this pin
[45:47] and he said for some reason he doesn't
[45:49] know why it
[45:50] bothered him he couldn't sleep he
[45:52] couldn't rest he had to
[45:54] find where they were to find out what
[45:56] this pin was about what is it
[45:58] what does it mean and of course
[46:02] they he found them in the hotel and
[46:05] they explained to him what it was he
[46:08] accepted the lord
[46:09] and the message they baptized him in
[46:12] water
[46:14] i'm at home in canada and i said well
[46:16] the brothers went over there
[46:18] you know and uh why don't i give them a
[46:22] call to see how they're doing
[46:24] and say oh brother it's good you call we
[46:27] just baptized the brother and he's just
[46:29] leaving so i said oh is that right can i
[46:32] talk to him they put him on
[46:34] and i spoke with him and when
[46:37] prayed with him spoke with him and then
[46:40] he was about to leave
[46:42] and uh just as he was about to i said
[46:45] just a minute brother
[46:46] by your name he said my name is stephen
[46:50] i said stephen my brother you have
[46:54] great work ahead of you stephen
[46:57] full of faith and power the holy ghost
[47:00] also amen praise god but of course when
[47:04] i said that i
[47:05] didn't think anything but my goodness
[47:08] the first week
[47:10] he baptized 10 people the next week
[47:13] it was 20 the next week 40 the next week
[47:16] 60
[47:17] next week 70 and so on and it started
[47:21] building and building and it went up to
[47:24] that those numbers of
[47:26] of over 500 and as of last
[47:29] saturday uh 10 or 15 people
[47:33] were baptized in water in the name of
[47:35] the lord jesus christ
[47:42] but what i'm getting at is that he
[47:46] had um there were no churches
[47:49] really functioning in that country
[47:53] at that time but the minister of health
[47:57] whether by misadventure mistake or
[47:59] whatever had given him
[48:01] a signed piece of paper by him saying
[48:03] that he could run church
[48:05] because when he called he thought he was
[48:08] just getting a
[48:10] secretary but the secretary was busy
[48:13] so the minister himself took the call
[48:16] so he didn't know he was talking to the
[48:18] minister and the minister
[48:20] issued him the permit so he was
[48:24] functioning
[48:25] and what happened the
[48:28] the numbers are growing and they
[48:31] keep provoking them and stuff like that
[48:33] i'm just praising this
[48:35] but the fact is two weeks ago
[48:39] the elders of the churches
[48:43] called up the government and talked
[48:45] about partiality and this and that
[48:48] and ask for him to be arrested
[48:52] right this sounds like the bible with
[48:54] jesus it sounds like the book of acts
[48:56] with paul
[48:57] and uh stirred up the powers
[49:01] and so they sent in the police
[49:05] and while he was there trying to talk to
[49:07] the people from the pulpit
[49:10] they came and arrested him
[49:13] a riot almost broke out
[49:17] the sisters were crying and the men
[49:20] were angry and it was just two or three
[49:24] policemen
[49:25] so anything could have happened because
[49:28] they were really angry
[49:30] and so he said brother i don't know what
[49:33] it is but the same thing that i always
[49:35] feel came
[49:36] and i just felt calm and i started
[49:40] talking to the people
[49:41] and they calm right down and i was able
[49:45] to
[49:46] go out there with the police telling
[49:48] them not to worry
[49:49] but god everything is going to work out
[49:51] god will make a way
[49:53] amen and so he had to spend a night
[49:57] in prison and then
[50:00] they some of the believers
[50:03] bailed him out of the prison
[50:07] and so he's out now
[50:11] but in the case they they find him
[50:14] a fine of 3 500
[50:18] canadian dollars and the reason for that
[50:21] is
[50:24] with that paper of the health minister
[50:28] the prime minister issued
[50:31] an edict for the entire country an order
[50:34] for the entire country
[50:36] that meant that no churches should
[50:39] function
[50:41] and so the policemen said we know you
[50:43] have this
[50:44] and it's valid but we can't pay
[50:46] attention to it
[50:48] because we have this and this supersedes
[50:52] that this is the prime minister
[50:55] this is the health minister obviously we
[50:58] have to listen to
[51:00] the prime minister so we have we're
[51:03] doing
[51:04] they didn't want to do it but they had
[51:05] to do it so they took him but anyway
[51:08] he's
[51:08] out right now and they
[51:11] brought him back on last
[51:15] wednesday and then it was put over again
[51:19] until this coming friday right
[51:22] this coming friday praise the lord so
[51:25] the lord bless our brother
[51:27] we try to help him with
[51:30] like a thousand canadian dollars
[51:34] of course i said trust the lord pray
[51:38] and let's see how the lord will meet
[51:40] that need
[51:42] and the sister that was baptized from
[51:45] england
[51:48] also was suffering from an
[51:51] issue and there
[51:54] god's holy spirit like the woman in the
[51:57] bible
[51:58] with jesus
[52:01] she got baptized and he was telling me
[52:04] about it i said
[52:06] you go right now lay your hands and pray
[52:08] for her
[52:10] because that is was then i can see this
[52:12] is what god wants now
[52:15] and that's what he did and this woman
[52:18] happened to be
[52:19] a a nursing sister in england they
[52:22] called them that means
[52:23] uh an experienced older
[52:27] registered nurse that's over a ward
[52:30] um she she
[52:33] ended up with it absolutely
[52:38] dead stopped gone and shouting and
[52:41] praising the lord
[52:49] so she has her friends in england
[52:53] uh you know hearing the word
[52:57] and believing and she's in quarantine
[53:01] but soon she'll be out and going to one
[53:03] of the churches there
[53:05] anyway our god is good isn't he
[53:08] he's the same yesterday today and
[53:10] forever
[53:13] well we give god glory and we give him
[53:16] all the praise
[53:17] and so let us continue to believe and
[53:19] trust the lord
[53:20] i'm not going to be uh up here for
[53:24] a long time but we want to take
[53:27] revelation
[53:28] chapter 4 verse 1.
[53:32] and just take a little thought
[53:37] every one of us come back here today
[53:40] we've been chased
[53:42] and we are changing because you have
[53:45] tasted
[53:46] your own personal freedom and life
[53:50] we are telling you over and over you are
[53:52] free
[53:54] but you're free with the boundaries of
[53:56] the word
[53:57] but no pastor which is wrong is here to
[54:01] watch you
[54:02] seven the life of god is in you
[54:07] and he watches over you you
[54:10] have to take care of yourself you have
[54:13] to put restraints on yourself
[54:15] it's you and him you and the holy spirit
[54:19] praise god and so i know
[54:22] i have changed i have been transformed
[54:26] i've experienced growth and i know you
[54:29] have experienced growth
[54:31] and you've experienced changed because
[54:34] when you
[54:35] hit your knees there was no pastor there
[54:38] to pick you up
[54:39] and rub the knee and put a plaster on it
[54:42] you had to pick yourself up right with
[54:45] his help you pick yourself up
[54:47] and the holy spirit helped you and
[54:49] straightened you and that way you're
[54:51] stronger
[54:52] than you were before and i give god the
[54:56] glory and the praise
[54:57] and the honor for that now if we will
[55:00] turn in our bibles
[55:02] reading from revelation chapter 4
[55:06] verse 1 after this
[55:12] i looked and behold
[55:15] a door was opened in heaven
[55:19] and the first voice which i
[55:22] heard was as it were
[55:25] of a trumpet talking with me which
[55:28] said come up hither
[55:32] and i will show thee which must be
[55:36] hereafter amen
[55:39] let us pray gracious father
[55:44] one said just the taste
[55:48] of thy word within our hearts
[55:51] is wonderful and we give you
[55:55] praise and honor for this lord asking
[55:58] your blessing upon your people near
[56:01] and far may you have take all the glory
[56:05] as you send out the gospel light from
[56:08] this lighthouse
[56:10] may the spirit of god shed
[56:13] forth this light lord upon the hearts
[56:16] that some drifting forlorn
[56:19] brother sister that's in some
[56:23] in some kind of a religious atmosphere
[56:27] be drawn out into your divine presence
[56:29] of the sunlight
[56:31] that you might receive growth light life
[56:33] fruit for your coming glory
[56:35] in jesus name amen and amen god bless
[56:39] you please be seated
[56:41] as our scripture read
[56:45] after this i looked
[56:48] praise god
[56:51] he was seeing before but he wasn't
[56:54] looking
[56:55] but now he says after this i looked
[56:58] i mean you walk around with your eyes
[57:00] and you look around you're seeing
[57:02] but look means paying particular
[57:04] attention to something that caught your
[57:06] attention
[57:07] and that's when you look right so he
[57:10] said
[57:11] and i look after this after what
[57:14] the seven church ages are now over
[57:18] and after this he got
[57:22] his sight was even brighter and clearer
[57:25] and he says now i looked not just seeing
[57:29] the word
[57:30] but i looked i i caught a revelation
[57:34] amen now he's a type of us
[57:37] now you if you're speaking of john as a
[57:40] person
[57:41] there as a prophet it he was already
[57:43] catching revelation
[57:45] but in order to type us god is placing
[57:47] it this way in his word
[57:49] that we might understand that now
[57:52] we can see clearly what is in the word
[57:57] so brother branham as you know
[58:01] taught us and spoke about the first poll
[58:04] how many knows about the first poll
[58:06] okay well the first bull as you know was
[58:09] healing
[58:11] and that went to your body the second
[58:15] pull was dissolved and that went to your
[58:18] spirit
[58:20] the third pull this word
[58:23] went to your soul the complete
[58:26] person amen body
[58:29] spirit or mind and soul
[58:33] praise god so those were the
[58:36] first three polls that brother branham
[58:39] spoke about
[58:41] but i want to say
[58:44] here i want to speak on heaven's
[58:47] pull praise god
[58:51] now we understand that the
[58:55] pull of course was this word
[58:58] by the messenger
[59:02] the prophet of malachi 4 5
[59:06] that appealed to the soul
[59:09] of those seeds of god that were buried
[59:14] in the earth of human society
[59:18] and the holy spirit called them back to
[59:21] attention of his word
[59:24] by that third pope of course there are
[59:26] many other aspects to it but that is not
[59:29] their subject
[59:30] i'm speaking on the third pull
[59:33] appealing to something that's
[59:36] buried in you and i from before the
[59:40] foundation
[59:41] of the world so that when you
[59:44] heard the sound of that voice
[59:48] coming through that trumpet of the
[59:50] prophet
[59:52] you heard the voice and you
[59:55] hear oh you heard a call as the lord
[59:58] said in his word my sheep hear my voice
[1:00:02] and a stranger they will not follow
[1:00:07] and because we heard the voice by that
[1:00:10] third pull
[1:00:11] it attracted us now i i'm speaking on
[1:00:15] heaven's pole now we understand
[1:00:18] heavens pull heavens the catching up
[1:00:22] or the catching away the pulling up the
[1:00:25] pulling away
[1:00:26] praise god heaven's full now
[1:00:29] not just by the spoken word
[1:00:33] but heavens fullest by the revealed word
[1:00:36] and that goes only to the bride of jesus
[1:00:40] christ
[1:00:42] that only appeals to the bride of jesus
[1:00:44] christ
[1:00:46] that is the only thing that magnetizes
[1:00:49] our soul
[1:00:50] and catches her away into the presence
[1:00:53] of the living god amen the pull
[1:00:58] of the revealed word
[1:01:01] other things are beautiful wonderful
[1:01:04] but nothing else really attracts her
[1:01:09] accept the opening of that word
[1:01:12] when he opens his mouth and he speaks
[1:01:14] the word
[1:01:16] that is the attraction on the top of the
[1:01:19] pyramid
[1:01:20] oh blessed be the name of our god
[1:01:24] oh praise god hallelujah
[1:01:27] so the bride seems to be the fourth
[1:01:31] paul you say brother simon you ran into
[1:01:33] the word the prophet never spoke of any
[1:01:35] fourth paul
[1:01:36] well i know four is the number of the
[1:01:38] pride one two
[1:01:39] three but four is the bride's number
[1:01:43] that is the bridegroom's call that is
[1:01:46] the revealed word
[1:01:48] that is him now come to the bride to
[1:01:51] reveal himself
[1:01:52] to her personally and privately
[1:01:56] and he calls out to her she hears his
[1:01:59] voice
[1:02:00] and it pulls her into his presence
[1:02:04] amen this is the last poll
[1:02:08] i said this is the last poll
[1:02:11] and this is the pull into glory
[1:02:15] praise god hallelujah no one

[1:02:31] and we look across to see heaven's
[1:02:34] glories
[1:02:35] and the coming of the lord the parting
[1:02:38] of the curtain of time
[1:02:40] oh my i heard the voice
[1:02:44] i feel the pull oh praise god
[1:02:48] amen it's not now it's not pulling me
[1:02:52] into the message like it did it has done
[1:02:55] that job it's now pulling me out
[1:02:58] into the presence of almighty god
[1:03:02] into heaven's glory into the presence of
[1:03:05] god hallelujah
[1:03:07] oh one song said you're in heaven's
[1:03:11] borderland

[1:03:23] glory to god thank god some of the
[1:03:25] priest's foot

[1:03:30] water is parting
[1:03:31] the word is opening up the spirit is
[1:03:34] making himself clean and clear
[1:03:37] amen and the word is making itself know
[1:03:40] what i'm speaking about to you you
[1:03:41] understand it's light to you but to
[1:03:44] others it's darkness
[1:03:46] to you you rejoice others say what is he
[1:03:50] talking about
[1:03:51] to them it's like fun they'll make fun
[1:03:54] of this they'll make a joke
[1:03:56] out of it it's crude it's rough it's
[1:03:59] it's not symmetrical it's not
[1:04:02] intellectual it's not
[1:04:04] well you know beautiful with its
[1:04:06] presentation
[1:04:07] and so more praise god brother sister

[1:04:18] something inside of you my man the deep
[1:04:21] crawls back to the deep
[1:04:23] and the deep response back to this world
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:28] that's the authority of a true servant
[1:04:30] of god
[1:04:31] not his authority but the authority of
[1:04:33] the word of god
[1:04:35] he can speak the word knowing that the
[1:04:37] word will have a reaction
[1:04:40] in the hearts of the true believer amen

[1:05:08] oh praise this wonderful name yes
[1:05:12] earth is pulling its own
[1:05:15] the world is pulling its own to itself
[1:05:20] amen and heaven is pulling its own
[1:05:24] back to itself amen and it's all going
[1:05:28] on right now
[1:05:29] while we are speaking amen
[1:05:34] what are you talking about forceful
[1:05:36] second third pull
[1:05:37] now you were talking about heaven's pull
[1:05:40] yes
[1:05:41] well when we say pull we mean this is
[1:05:44] something that gets your attention
[1:05:47] amen the first ball something that gets
[1:05:50] your attention
[1:05:51] and when that broke out it got their
[1:05:54] attention
[1:05:55] amen pull something that will not only
[1:05:58] get your attention but attract you
[1:06:01] amen it will attract you praise god
[1:06:04] hallelujah
[1:06:05] pull magnetism amen
[1:06:09] magnetic pull something that draws you
[1:06:12] like the north pole
[1:06:14] back to itself hallelujah then we we see
[1:06:18] here
[1:06:18] when you talk about pull to understand
[1:06:20] it you understand the pull
[1:06:22] that gravity has on every
[1:06:26] single human being that is upon the face
[1:06:30] of this earth that we are living in
[1:06:33] praise god hallelujah oh
[1:06:36] my i feel the pull
[1:06:39] i heard voice praise god
[1:06:42] hallelujah i want you to know god is not
[1:06:45] the author of confusion
[1:06:48] god has a world that operates with laws
[1:06:52] amen no it operates with laws
[1:06:56] natural and spiritual laws
[1:07:00] amen we got the laws of gravity
[1:07:03] electricity and
[1:07:05] laws of growth the laws of reproduction
[1:07:09] laws of sowing and reaping if you saw he
[1:07:13] says you you
[1:07:14] got to reap you're going to reap
[1:07:15] whatever you sow
[1:07:17] so there's a law spiritual laws there's
[1:07:20] a law of compensation
[1:07:21] amen you you throw out a uh
[1:07:25] a brick or a rubber ball and it bounced
[1:07:27] right back to you
[1:07:29] amen law of harvest the law
[1:07:32] of cause and effect brother branham
[1:07:35] spoke on that
[1:07:36] and then there is the law of contrast
[1:07:40] amen praise god now earth
[1:07:43] has its main law
[1:07:47] and the main law of this
[1:07:50] earth or of this world is the law
[1:07:53] of gravity and that
[1:07:57] controls everything on this earth
[1:08:01] but god also has his law
[1:08:04] that controls his people and his
[1:08:06] children
[1:08:08] and everything that is really from him
[1:08:12] now earth's law says what goes up
[1:08:16] must come down but god law says no
[1:08:20] what comes down must go up
[1:08:23] amen so you decide which law
[1:08:28] you want to live by but our law
[1:08:31] god's law from his word is that what
[1:08:35] jesus said
[1:08:36] none can go into heaven except he
[1:08:40] that came down from heaven and if you
[1:08:43] come
[1:08:43] down from heaven out of the
[1:08:46] gateless past of the mind of god and
[1:08:50] you're broke into time amen
[1:08:52] hallelujah after you serve your sentence
[1:08:55] and time
[1:08:56] you're breaking right back into glory
[1:08:59] in the presence of almighty god there
[1:09:03] we are now praise god praise the lord
[1:09:07] we're not asking for no kind of a
[1:09:10] compromise with the devil we're not
[1:09:13] asking him for probation
[1:09:16] you leave alone for a short while and i
[1:09:19] leave you alone no
[1:09:20] we are breaking out of here the bible
[1:09:23] said
[1:09:24] peter and paul were put in prison but
[1:09:27] but
[1:09:28] one night that prison house began to
[1:09:31] shake
[1:09:31] it began to move amen and the bible says
[1:09:35] the gates were
[1:09:36] open amen i'm there walk out praise god
[1:09:39] i believe our house of this life
[1:09:43] is shaken right now it's shaken right
[1:09:46] now
[1:09:47] and we are walking out to here no matter
[1:09:50] what they say
[1:09:51] no matter what they do they could chain
[1:09:54] you to the rock wall they could put all
[1:09:56] kinds of
[1:09:57] chains on your legs they can put
[1:09:58] sickness in your body
[1:10:00] they could trouble your mind the devil
[1:10:01] could do all kinds of stuff
[1:10:03] but you're breaking out of here
[1:10:08] free at last praise god we are free in
[1:10:11] the grace of almighty god
[1:10:14] amen is god you see
[1:10:18] when they when they say what goes up
[1:10:21] must come down
[1:10:22] they are really right but they are going
[1:10:25] by the law
[1:10:26] of earth right that whatever came
[1:10:30] out of the bosom of the earth it must
[1:10:33] come back to the bosom of the earth
[1:10:36] and what came out to the bosom of god is
[1:10:39] back to the wisdom of god
[1:10:41] because that's where it came from so
[1:10:43] they are right
[1:10:44] on their hand but we are also right on
[1:10:48] what we see in this world
[1:10:50] we didn't come from earth you're not
[1:10:53] creatures of time
[1:10:54] we come from eternity we go back to the
[1:10:58] eternity of god
[1:11:00] go back to the bosom of our heavenly
[1:11:02] father glory to
[1:11:03] god amen we know according to the law of
[1:11:07] contrast
[1:11:09] everything that exists has its opposite
[1:11:12] listen to brother branham here hearing
[1:11:14] recognizing and acting on the word
[1:11:17] uh paragraph 12 in the garden of eden
[1:11:23] sin was so until it attracted eve
[1:11:28] from righteousness to sin
[1:11:32] and in the same garden remember this
[1:11:36] there was the tree of life
[1:11:39] but there also was the tree
[1:11:42] of death and of knowledge
[1:11:46] contrast amen
[1:11:49] so is the law of contrast today
[1:11:54] that there where there is good
[1:11:57] there has to be evil when there
[1:12:01] is right there is also a wrong
[1:12:05] we will never know matter our
[1:12:08] environment
[1:12:09] our state of life
[1:12:12] we will never be able to shake ourselves
[1:12:17] away from the presence of either
[1:12:21] is that right you see now we don't want
[1:12:24] to talk but
[1:12:24] kink on separation from unbelief and
[1:12:27] separating from sin
[1:12:28] how they just think of it physically you
[1:12:31] know
[1:12:32] and stepping away they don't realize
[1:12:34] what that separation
[1:12:35] is something changed in here and in here
[1:12:38] and that separates you you don't have to
[1:12:40] do nothing to separate it's all around
[1:12:42] you they're everywhere
[1:12:43] everything is around you amen everywhere
[1:12:46] what you want to do about it
[1:12:48] they go around marching against
[1:12:50] homosexuals marching against
[1:12:52] uh abortionists marching against this
[1:12:54] match and against that
[1:12:55] well you may look in the word and you
[1:12:58] see what the word says about such things
[1:13:01] but it has
[1:13:02] nothing to do with your relationship
[1:13:04] meeting them people
[1:13:05] dealing with them because they're human
[1:13:07] beings like you
[1:13:08] talking with them and loving them don't
[1:13:11] you think jesus loved judas just
[1:13:13] all the other ones he loved all of them
[1:13:17] even though he know they're going to
[1:13:18] hell
[1:13:19] he gives them rain he gives them water
[1:13:21] he gives them his food to give them
[1:13:23] everything just like you and me that's
[1:13:26] the love of god without impartiality
[1:13:30] it doesn't mean he agree with them
[1:13:32] doesn't mean that
[1:13:34] he support what they're doing but that's
[1:13:36] just the love of god
[1:13:37] is in all encompassing and encircling
[1:13:42] and it takes in everybody hallelujah
[1:13:45] praise
[1:13:46] god amen one minute brother simon you're
[1:13:49] against that kind of thing
[1:13:51] now i hear you talking it looks like
[1:13:52] you're for it
[1:13:54] well that's the way it always appear
[1:13:57] amen
[1:13:58] because we are walking the line we're
[1:14:01] walking
[1:14:01] god's ballot line of balance amen we're
[1:14:05] walking the line of his word
[1:14:07] amen praise god god's love contrasts
[1:14:11] everything exists has its
[1:14:15] opposite to it amen see
[1:14:18] that's the way it is you can't shake
[1:14:21] yourself away from that
[1:14:23] for it is a love it's there paul even
[1:14:26] said
[1:14:27] when i would do good evil
[1:14:31] present with me the sinner
[1:14:35] will never be able to shake himself away
[1:14:37] from the christian
[1:14:39] and the question of will
[1:14:42] never be able to shake himself away from
[1:14:45] the sinner
[1:14:47] that's the way it has to be and god has
[1:14:50] it that way brethren
[1:14:51] brethren praise the lord so don't go on
[1:14:54] a bus and then you're shifting over
[1:14:56] because you know a sinner or unbeliever
[1:15:00] comes beside you
[1:15:01] they're just like you only that you by
[1:15:04] the grace of god were chosen
[1:15:06] to be a part of his kingdom
[1:15:11] just like you amen there'll be a witness
[1:15:15] here of right and a witness
[1:15:19] or testimony of wrong also
[1:15:23] and that will be always but
[1:15:26] you as individual you must make your
[1:15:30] choice
[1:15:31] you have to take one side or the other
[1:15:35] that's the way that it is
[1:15:39] day and night male and female
[1:15:42] amen amen one time he says
[1:15:46] man without a without a woman is nothing
[1:15:50] and a woman without a man is nothing
[1:15:54] but together one together
[1:15:57] for his glory praise the lord so these
[1:16:01] two
[1:16:01] powers or forces exist in creation
[1:16:04] regardless of what we think they exist
[1:16:07] and they're here
[1:16:08] within the creation and so
[1:16:11] this law earth's law
[1:16:15] gravity controls uh
[1:16:18] our physicality of what we do
[1:16:22] because that's the what the paul called
[1:16:26] the law
[1:16:26] of the earth see the law of the
[1:16:30] mercy or arts law that controls
[1:16:33] the things of the law and
[1:16:36] that is the that is the pull of the
[1:16:39] earth
[1:16:40] the pull of the the pull of the devil
[1:16:43] the pull of this thing it has its pull
[1:16:45] also
[1:16:47] he's telling you there if he comes with
[1:16:49] the first second and third pull
[1:16:51] and everything goes by contrast so so
[1:16:54] what's the contrast
[1:16:56] it's out there and that's what i'm
[1:16:58] telling you that's out there
[1:17:00] the devil has this pull of gravitation
[1:17:04] pull on the world and gospel for you on
[1:17:07] that side
[1:17:08] but god's word is here to pull you to
[1:17:10] his side
[1:17:11] of his word amen
[1:17:15] praise god hallelujah yes sir
[1:17:19] so the physical activity of that law is
[1:17:22] to pull
[1:17:22] everything back to itself
[1:17:26] every thing that belongs to it back to
[1:17:29] itself
[1:17:30] as the book of genesis tells us in the
[1:17:33] bible and we say it as preachers at
[1:17:35] funerals
[1:17:36] ashes to ashes dusted us
[1:17:39] you come from the earth he says and to
[1:17:41] the earth you will return
[1:17:43] amen why because whatever belongs
[1:17:47] it's pulling that back amen
[1:17:50] it pulls all his children is pulling
[1:17:53] them
[1:17:53] back to the ground praise god and that's
[1:17:56] why as
[1:17:58] human beings our bodies
[1:18:01] when you i don't care how much weight
[1:18:05] you lift
[1:18:07] you can own a health food store
[1:18:10] and have all the vitamins you like
[1:18:14] and you can be eating all the precise
[1:18:17] right vitamins
[1:18:18] and doing everything and you're going to
[1:18:20] find while you start to hit certain age
[1:18:22] your body start bending over
[1:18:25] you see it's pulling it back
[1:18:28] to where it come from it starts to bend
[1:18:31] off
[1:18:32] you try to straighten up and try to it
[1:18:35] just won't do
[1:18:36] it's not the same it start to bend
[1:18:39] already
[1:18:40] it's going back to where it come from
[1:18:43] right praise god that's the way it is
[1:18:46] because your physical bodies actually
[1:18:49] come as the prophet explained
[1:18:50] from the elements of the earth every of
[1:18:53] all the vitamins all the elements
[1:18:55] it comes from the very earth that we are
[1:18:59] from
[1:18:59] praise god and unless we can break the
[1:19:03] power
[1:19:04] of that law of this gravity
[1:19:07] of this world we're gonna be pulled
[1:19:09] right back there and stay
[1:19:11] there amen praise god hallelujah
[1:19:15] oh my i don't care what you say
[1:19:19] you can do whatever you like your foot
[1:19:22] going to start dragging
[1:19:24] after a while you can't raise your hand
[1:19:26] over your head
[1:19:29] after a while you can't do it as you
[1:19:31] like to do
[1:19:32] i was speaking to a certain brother
[1:19:35] that's a wonderful
[1:19:36] preacher and missionary of the gospel
[1:19:39] and say oh brother he says
[1:19:41] now i i lost my sight you know age
[1:19:44] catching up with me
[1:19:45] i i can't see anymore i just came back
[1:19:49] from the doctor
[1:19:50] well you say oh he's a believer and he
[1:19:52] lost his sight
[1:19:54] well believer has nothing to do with it
[1:19:56] just living
[1:19:57] in this human flesh is what got to do
[1:20:00] with it
[1:20:01] and the earth is pulling back everything
[1:20:04] to
[1:20:04] itself and we feel that pulling power
[1:20:08] of gravity in us that's why we start to
[1:20:11] get lines on our face
[1:20:14] we call them wrinkles and uh you
[1:20:17] start to get bags under your eyes my
[1:20:19] wife was pointing to some i have
[1:20:22] and and so
[1:20:25] you start getting those things because
[1:20:27] the earth is pulling
[1:20:30] it's pulling and you can't you can't
[1:20:32] resist you can try to hold it back
[1:20:34] but brother branham says you can do that
[1:20:37] it's good
[1:20:38] he said even i tried it he says but you
[1:20:40] can he said i i'm eating more
[1:20:42] meat and vitamins than i ever did before
[1:20:45] when we were poor
[1:20:46] and i'm getting older i'm not getting
[1:20:49] younger
[1:20:50] right because that's the law and that's
[1:20:53] the
[1:20:54] nature of what it's doing to us
[1:20:57] at this time praise god and we start to
[1:21:00] manifest that law the scripture says
[1:21:04] it is appointed unto men wants to die
[1:21:09] and after this the judgment
[1:21:12] but we're appointed to die as long as
[1:21:15] we're in this
[1:21:16] body amen so gravity is pulling all his
[1:21:20] children
[1:21:21] back to the grave the earth is pulling
[1:21:24] his children back to itself
[1:21:27] and that is the laws of mortal existence
[1:21:31] amen we say like will always attract to
[1:21:36] like
[1:21:37] everything that are it will attract like
[1:21:39] that amen
[1:21:40] praise god but we don't all have to
[1:21:43] submit to that
[1:21:45] that's what i'm here to say amen
[1:21:48] everything has its opposite
[1:21:50] and that's how you have that law of
[1:21:52] gravity
[1:21:53] pulling the people and every one of us
[1:21:56] down to the grave
[1:21:58] if the rapture doesn't come and take you
[1:22:00] before then
[1:22:01] you are going to a grave
[1:22:04] and you don't have to fight and scroll
[1:22:06] and say i'm not going
[1:22:08] because you don't care anymore
[1:22:11] because you have another law operating
[1:22:14] in your life
[1:22:16] amen there's a spiritual law that's here
[1:22:20] to pull you into glory that's heaven's
[1:22:23] law
[1:22:24] and it's his fool who in heaven's pull
[1:22:27] amen god always keeps his
[1:22:30] law in balance paul speaks of it
[1:22:34] in the word of god amen and he says but
[1:22:38] we have the
[1:22:39] law of the spirit of life hallelujah
[1:22:43] the law of the spirit of life is here to
[1:22:46] quicken you
[1:22:47] amen quicken you and to pull you out of
[1:22:50] this break the
[1:22:53] gravitational pull amen
[1:22:56] oh my you already heard the come down
[1:22:59] you already been sealed in oh praise god
[1:23:03] this is the take off brother sister
[1:23:07] when you see those spiritual astronauts
[1:23:10] take off
[1:23:11] what do you think when you look at those
[1:23:13] rockets going off from miami
[1:23:15] they're in the earth's pool until they
[1:23:18] hit a certain place and
[1:23:20] all of a sudden that aircraft is moving
[1:23:22] fast
[1:23:23] but with the film we can still see it
[1:23:25] because it's moving like that
[1:23:27] right it's moving like that but then all
[1:23:29] of a sudden
[1:23:30] a certain spot you're here bam and when
[1:23:33] you hear bam you're just
[1:23:35] a big fan boom that thing has
[1:23:38] gone faster than many times the speed of
[1:23:41] light
[1:23:41] and it's headed for outer space lord of
[1:23:44] god
[1:23:45] that's what i'm talking about amen oh
[1:23:48] the holy spirit
[1:23:49] oh that's the law of life is in you
[1:23:53] taking you with sealing you in and that
[1:23:56] word
[1:23:57] in that rocket ship that cone
[1:24:00] that you are in all of a sudden the king
[1:24:03] blasts off
[1:24:04] into outer space and holds you into the
[1:24:06] presence of almighty god
[1:24:10] amen praise god
[1:24:13] genesis 1 the earth was without form
[1:24:16] and without void amen
[1:24:20] and it was like that until the sun came
[1:24:23] god called for the sun called for the
[1:24:25] rain called for the wind
[1:24:27] amen and they all came and give it
[1:24:31] life amen and we understand that
[1:24:35] brother sister came into our spiritual
[1:24:39] existence
[1:24:40] by the rising of the sun of the spoken
[1:24:44] word amen branham says it plainly
[1:24:48] in that message when he said now
[1:24:51] like the earth now the darkness
[1:24:55] and the gloom that was over your spirit
[1:24:59] all the clouds that were over your soul
[1:25:02] the sun
[1:25:02] of the world is risen upon you
[1:25:06] and is shining upon you and now the
[1:25:08] gloom has to go away
[1:25:12] that you can see the light of the word
[1:25:14] of god that's shining in this hour
[1:25:17] upon your heart and upon your life
[1:25:19] forgive me sister elaine praise god
[1:25:23] i'm sorry but praise the lord jesus
[1:25:26] amen our sister is doing translation and
[1:25:29] then i speed up like that all of a
[1:25:31] sudden
[1:25:31] and then i just got the realization oh
[1:25:33] my she's translating there
[1:25:35] praise god i i'm gonna try the best i
[1:25:38] can to stay within the boundaries but if
[1:25:40] i break out
[1:25:41] amen
[1:25:46] hallelujah praise god
[1:25:49] all the laws of this entire universe not
[1:25:53] only of earth
[1:25:54] is controlled by god's spoken word
[1:25:58] because there was nothing that was made
[1:26:01] that was made
[1:26:02] without god's spoken word
[1:26:05] so his spoken word controls everything
[1:26:09] amen and so friends the earth
[1:26:13] and even that pull that the earth has to
[1:26:16] pull you back to the grave
[1:26:18] that is under the power and control
[1:26:21] god's
[1:26:22] spoken word now
[1:26:26] the sun of course is under god's control
[1:26:30] too
[1:26:31] but that is a symbol of heaven's law
[1:26:34] it's there as a representation
[1:26:38] of heaven's law that just as the earth
[1:26:41] will pull you to the grave
[1:26:43] the sun will pull the little jew drops
[1:26:46] right back
[1:26:46] up where they come from so
[1:26:50] the sun is before you every day as a
[1:26:52] symbol
[1:26:53] and a promise amen you are not staying
[1:26:56] in no grave
[1:26:57] you are not staying the war in this
[1:26:59] earth you are not staying under the
[1:27:01] influence
[1:27:02] under the pull under all the magnitude
[1:27:06] charming serpent spirit that's upon this
[1:27:10] earth
[1:27:10] you're not i'm not going to stay under
[1:27:12] the spell but i'm breaking the spell
[1:27:15] i'm breaking the pull heavens pull to
[1:27:18] pull you out of this
[1:27:19] and to pull you into the very presence
[1:27:22] of god
[1:27:23] in the heavenlies amen
[1:27:26] praise god one pull pulls you to the
[1:27:29] grave and the other one pulls you into
[1:27:31] glory
[1:27:32] oh what a contrast this law
[1:27:35] of the spirit of life praise god
[1:27:39] i'm not using the quotes here i'm just
[1:27:41] telling you
[1:27:42] to a great extent what they say the lord
[1:27:45] but just so that you know if you ask
[1:27:48] that i got them here i got them here
[1:27:50] it's not me just talking
[1:27:52] i'm talking because it's pulled what is
[1:27:55] already been said
[1:27:56] and i just don't want to spend my time
[1:27:58] talking about page six
[1:28:00] six and page that and paragraph eight
[1:28:02] here
[1:28:03] whatever i just want to tell you what my
[1:28:06] understanding
[1:28:07] of what he has said amen out of
[1:28:11] the word of god amen hallelujah
[1:28:14] praise god so this law of gravity has
[1:28:16] its negative side
[1:28:18] and it has its positive side the
[1:28:21] negative side of course will take you to
[1:28:24] the grave
[1:28:26] amen it will take you to the grave and
[1:28:28] passing over this quickly
[1:28:30] the positive side of it if you
[1:28:32] understand it and can work with it
[1:28:34] it'll take you to success prosperity
[1:28:36] blessing
[1:28:37] and so on that's the natural positive
[1:28:41] side
[1:28:42] of using that law of gravity amen you'll
[1:28:45] attract certain things to yourself
[1:28:47] and so on we won't spend our time with
[1:28:50] that amen
[1:28:51] but it's continuously manifesting in our
[1:28:53] lives
[1:28:54] and you attract to this to yourself the
[1:28:56] things that you
[1:28:57] think you you pray about you meditate
[1:29:01] about
[1:29:01] you begin to attract those things to
[1:29:03] yourself or those things are drawn to
[1:29:05] you
[1:29:06] by the grace of god hallelujah and we
[1:29:09] attract ourselves
[1:29:10] all that belongs to us by predestinated
[1:29:13] will
[1:29:14] of the mystery of god is that right you
[1:29:16] believe that
[1:29:17] you believe in god has a mystery will
[1:29:21] you know just like how i i have a
[1:29:23] written will
[1:29:24] so that my children will inherit
[1:29:27] whatever
[1:29:28] you know crumbs i left leave behind
[1:29:31] but the thing about that is
[1:29:35] god also has a will but god's
[1:29:38] will like every every person's will is a
[1:29:41] mystery
[1:29:42] because the the benefactors don't really
[1:29:45] know
[1:29:46] everything that's written in the will
[1:29:48] they might have some idea
[1:29:49] but they don't have a clear revelation
[1:29:52] until the lawyers
[1:29:53] in the will and then they get an idea of
[1:29:56] it but what happens to you that
[1:30:00] everything that is in that will that
[1:30:02] belongs to you
[1:30:03] by predestination comes to you
[1:30:06] as you believe it in the word of god
[1:30:10] because i want you to know and i'm
[1:30:11] touching on this just briefly
[1:30:13] that you are here and god
[1:30:16] as i've said before knows you are his
[1:30:19] children
[1:30:20] you're going to be here and when she is
[1:30:22] here when he's here
[1:30:23] he's going to need this he's going to
[1:30:24] need that he's going to need this going
[1:30:26] to need that
[1:30:27] they're going to go through this problem
[1:30:28] and i got this solution that solution
[1:30:31] everything is already there and i
[1:30:33] mentioned it
[1:30:34] like a mother knows a child is coming in
[1:30:36] the world she just doesn't sit down
[1:30:38] until the child appears oh my god i have
[1:30:40] a child
[1:30:40] i have to know one run to get diapers i
[1:30:42] have to get this
[1:30:44] no they prepare that place that room
[1:30:47] that clothing
[1:30:48] every the food the child has to eat and
[1:30:51] drink
[1:30:52] and everything that the child needs is
[1:30:55] prepared
[1:30:56] not when the child is here before
[1:31:00] the child even gets there it's ready
[1:31:03] so god being a good father a good mother
[1:31:06] a good parent already has done that for
[1:31:09] you and mine
[1:31:13] and all we have to believe that all that
[1:31:16] is
[1:31:16] yours must come to you by faith
[1:31:24] not pentecostal faith not
[1:31:27] oh god no
[1:31:32] you just trust him lord i'm your child
[1:31:35] i don't even know what belongs to me i
[1:31:37] don't even know what's out there that
[1:31:39] you have for me
[1:31:40] but whatever it is just send it
[1:31:43] is that right just send it because i
[1:31:46] know apostle paul says
[1:31:48] all things work together for good to
[1:31:50] them that love the lord
[1:31:51] so whatever you want to send to my life
[1:31:53] send it because you're going to turn out
[1:31:55] for my good anyway
