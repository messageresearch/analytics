[0:21] bible study time again
[0:24] and we are in the church age
[0:28] series tonight's
[0:32] study will be from revelation
[0:35] chapter 2 verse 13.
[0:40] and the topic will be
[0:45] in the footsteps of the faithful
[0:50] this is another broadcast
[0:53] in the ongoing series of this
[0:57] seven church ages may god bless our time
[1:01] together
[1:02] or study together and take us
[1:06] into a clearer understanding
[1:11] of what god has said to us
[1:14] in his word let us
[1:18] ask his blessing and for his
[1:21] help our gracious heavenly father
[1:26] we commit ourselves to thee
[1:31] wholeheartedly sincerely
[1:35] and we draw nigh respectfully
[1:40] and reverently to the o great invisible
[1:43] king
[1:46] may the great holy spirit
[1:49] anoint us lord that we
[1:53] may be a temple
[1:56] a vessel for your use lord
[2:00] speak lord as you are the same
[2:04] today as we surrender ourselves to thee
[2:07] now
[2:08] bless all those that speak
[2:12] and all them that hear
[2:15] wherever they may be for we ask it
[2:19] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[2:24] amen and amen
[2:29] our scripture reads thus
[2:34] i know thy works
[2:38] and where thou dwellest
[2:42] even where satan's seat is
[2:47] and thou as fast my name
[2:52] and has not denied my faith
[2:57] even in those days
[3:01] wherein antipas
[3:05] was my faithful martyr
[3:08] who was slain among you
[3:12] where satan dwelleth
[3:16] praise be to god hallelujah
[3:23] i know thy works first of all
[3:26] just think on the statement of who is
[3:30] speaking
[3:32] this is not man speaking this is not the
[3:35] accumulation of man's wisdom
[3:38] knowledge experiences or
[3:41] imagination or whatever speaking
[3:44] this is the lord god almighty
[3:48] speaking god who sees all
[3:53] knows all he says i
[3:56] know i know
[4:00] i'm aware he's conscious
[4:04] in every moment
[4:07] of time and space
[4:10] and of the eternities god
[4:14] is saying i know
[4:19] and in particular he wants you to know
[4:24] i know thy works he knows everything
[4:27] else
[4:28] but now he wants to speak
[4:32] particularly on your works
[4:36] of what your life seed has produced
[4:41] and he is saying i know
[4:44] thy works hallelujah
[4:48] and where thou dwellest
[4:53] even where satan's seat
[4:57] is oh my
[5:00] these saints were in a real
[5:03] pressure cooker they were in a bind
[5:07] they were in a place where
[5:10] they were asked to serve
[5:13] god right in the middle
[5:17] of where satan's earthly seat
[5:21] we know his spiritual seat or
[5:24] headquarters
[5:27] is in the valley of death or hell
[5:32] his natural seat
[5:35] is here up on the earth
[5:38] now i know your works
[5:43] and where you have to dwell
[5:47] what you have to put up with because you
[5:50] are
[5:50] living in the middle of where satan's
[5:54] seat is
[5:56] but i want to praise god
[6:00] that they were not left alone
[6:04] but the god who knows is also aware
[6:09] just as he was in the time of elijah
[6:12] when he says lord god i'm the only one
[6:15] that loves you and
[6:16] serves you and knows you like many
[6:19] followers of brother branham's message
[6:22] will think
[6:23] we are the only ones that believe
[6:28] but you'll find in the book of kings
[6:30] when god spoke about elijah he said to
[6:32] him
[6:34] no no no no no i have seven thousand
[6:37] hidden up and they are
[6:41] where did i hide them they're in
[6:44] jezebel's palace and they're
[6:48] eating from her table
[6:52] and i'm protecting them while they're in
[6:55] there
[6:56] eating from her table but yet serving me
[7:00] and believing me not believing her lies
[7:04] not believing her deceits not believing
[7:06] her seductions
[7:08] not believing all her offers of wealth
[7:11] and money and power
[7:13] and position you know
[7:16] but they believe me
[7:19] and they're all to my word hallelujah
[7:23] and god protected them kept them watch
[7:26] them
[7:26] let me make an application here this is
[7:29] speaking of
[7:31] in this day in this hour in which we
[7:35] live
[7:36] where a lot of people that has believed
[7:39] the elijah
[7:40] spirit prophet of this hour and of this
[7:44] age and feel so
[7:48] exclusive to themselves
[7:52] that we are the only ones
[7:55] who have this revelation
[7:59] and understanding of the prophet
[8:02] and of the message and of jesus christ
[8:06] that has been revealed to us
[8:08] and god is saying no no no
[8:11] as he did to elijah as he does to us
[8:14] now he is saying no no no
[8:18] i've got thousands hidden up
[8:21] in those denominations i've got them
[8:24] they're
[8:25] eating some of their doctrine the parts
[8:27] of it that are true
[8:29] and are good and unnutritious i have
[8:32] them
[8:32] in there and they're eating from it
[8:36] and they're partaking of it and
[8:39] they're doing that until i call them out
[8:42] until they call them to stand beside
[8:46] the elijah messenger and message
[8:50] of this day and in this hour
[8:53] and until that time i want you to know
[8:58] that you are not alone in the fight
[9:01] amen i want every believer in this
[9:05] message to know that in this hour
[9:09] to love respect and understand
[9:14] what is going on with our denominational
[9:17] brethren
[9:19] some are blinded some are deaf
[9:22] some are dumb spiritually speaking
[9:26] many times not because of their own will
[9:29] but the denominational system
[9:32] has them trapped and has
[9:36] them having a mouth but speak
[9:39] not air but care not
[9:42] and so god has to come and enlighten
[9:45] their minds and their hearts
[9:47] but for the time being
[9:53] we must love them pray for them
[9:57] and understand that god
[10:00] has allowed some of them to remain right
[10:03] there
[10:04] feeding on what they are receiving
[10:07] taking the parts of the truth and
[10:10] feeding on it
[10:11] until their hour has come
[10:14] for at his appointed time then
[10:18] god will send forth his sons and of his
[10:21] daughters
[10:22] yes i know thy works
[10:26] hallelujah and when god says this he is
[10:29] saying that
[10:30] of both vines the true vine
[10:33] i know thy works and to the false vine
[10:37] don't think you are hidden up and i'm
[10:40] not seeing
[10:42] i know thy works
[10:45] of what you are also doing
[10:49] therefore this
[10:52] message of i know thy works
[10:56] will bring joy and gladness
[11:01] to the hearts of one
[11:04] group but on the other hand
[11:07] it will strike terror into the hearts
[11:11] of those that disbelieve and
[11:14] misbelieve the word of
[11:18] god hallelujah for though we are saved
[11:22] by grace
[11:23] apart from works true salvation will
[11:28] bring works with it works of
[11:31] appreciation to god
[11:33] works of love to god works that comes
[11:36] of gratitude to him and the sacrifice
[11:40] and the price that he paid for our
[11:44] redemption so true salvation
[11:49] works will not give you salvation
[11:52] but true salvation will produce
[11:57] godly works out of that life
[12:02] first john 3 7
[12:05] little children let no man deceive you
[12:09] he that do it
[12:12] work at righteousness is righteous
[12:16] even as he is righteous hallelujah
[12:20] so you see what a man or a woman is
[12:25] is what he or she does
[12:28] we we manifest the works
[12:32] of the life or the seed that is in us
[12:37] listen to the word james 3 11
[12:41] does a fountain send fort at the same
[12:44] place sweet water
[12:46] and bitter amen
[12:49] and again in matthew 12 33-35
[12:53] either make the three good and the fruit
[12:55] good or else make the tree corrupt
[12:58] and his fruit also corrupt
[13:01] for the tree is known by its fruit
[13:04] all you generation of vipers how can you
[13:08] being evil
[13:10] speak good things for out of the
[13:13] abundance of the heart
[13:15] the mouth speak it a good man out of the
[13:20] good
[13:21] treasure that is in the heart
[13:24] bringeth forth good things and the evil
[13:28] man
[13:28] from the evil treasures that is in his
[13:31] heart
[13:32] bring it forth evil things hallelujah
[13:36] now if a man is truly born again of
[13:39] god's
[13:40] seed the incorruptible seed
[13:44] then he will produce the word
[13:48] but then if he is of the corruptible
[13:51] seed
[13:52] then he will produce evil works first
[13:55] peter
[13:55] chapter 1 verse 23
[14:00] so your works or you produce
[14:03] what kind of a life that is in you
[14:07] is what one will manifest
[14:11] amen praise god so certainly brother
[14:14] sister
[14:15] we know that the word of god will judge
[14:18] us
[14:20] when we come to the end of our way
[14:23] jesus christ who is the word
[14:26] will judge us when we come to the end of
[14:29] the way
[14:31] and i want you to know we are
[14:34] everyone being judged now
[14:37] god's camera is taking
[14:41] not just the skin but it's taking a
[14:45] picture of you now
[14:49] and your attitude to the word of god
[14:53] god is recording that now
[14:57] so if i believe him now
[15:01] if you believe him now you will
[15:04] not go into the judgment but shall have
[15:08] the
[15:08] light of life you'll have eternal life
[15:12] so my friends but if you believe not
[15:16] or in other words if you do not receive
[15:20] the revelation coming out of the word
[15:24] how will you live how will you know
[15:27] how to live without him leading and
[15:31] guiding you in the way that you should
[15:33] live
[15:34] therefore my friends let us be judged
[15:38] by the word now so that we will not
[15:41] be judged then when he does
[15:44] become uh before us person
[15:48] a person not just written word
[15:52] but living word standing before
[15:56] us to judge us in respect
[16:00] of his word i know thy works
[16:05] hallelujah for even now
[16:09] the word of god is judging us discerning
[16:11] us detecting
[16:13] what the bible tells us in hebrews 14 12
[16:16] amen 4 12 how that the word of god
[16:22] searches the heart and intentions
[16:26] of the spirit he knows you
[16:29] he knows me he knows every
[16:33] one of us hallelujah cuts asunder
[16:37] separates the carnal from the
[16:40] spiritual and makes us into
[16:43] living epistles
[16:47] to be read um of all men
[16:50] and known among men for the life we live
[16:55] to the glory of god yes
[16:59] i know thy works hallelujah
[17:03] if you are fearful of whether
[17:06] you are living right then fulfill the
[17:10] word of god
[17:14] if you are wondering when you come to
[17:17] the
[17:18] end of your way you will hear the words
[17:21] depart from me you cursed into
[17:25] everlasting darkness
[17:28] or whether you will hear the words come
[17:32] thou good and faithful servant
[17:35] enter into the joy of your lord
[17:40] then let us fulfill the word of god
[17:45] let us live by the word of god
[17:48] and surely god will bless you god will
[17:51] praise you
[17:52] amen for the word of god is the standard
[17:57] by which we will all be judged
[18:00] it is the standard it
[18:03] is the plumb line it is the measuring
[18:07] stick
[18:09] by which god will be able to judge us
[18:12] there is no other standard
[18:15] there is nothing else to mess yourself
[18:17] by
[18:18] but by the word of god therefore if we
[18:21] want to know where
[18:23] where what is our standing with god
[18:27] why not look into god's mirror
[18:30] of his word as james
[18:34] suggests within the bible
[18:37] praise god hallelujah
[18:40] there he is the word itself
[18:46] examines our lives checks up
[18:50] our lives detects
[18:53] discerns and with surgical
[18:56] skill separates the carnality
[19:00] from the spirituality and points us
[19:04] directly to the living word
[19:07] before us hallelujah making
[19:10] us to live by god's blueprint
[19:14] that he has given us that we might
[19:17] together build the temple not
[19:21] seen by man's hands but built by the
[19:24] hands of the holy ghost
[19:26] to the glory of the living god
[19:30] hallelujah amen let us
[19:33] walk in the footsteps of those who have
[19:36] already
[19:38] lived that life and crossed over
[19:41] if we were to walk in their footsteps
[19:46] then my brother my sister we will be
[19:49] judged by the same judgment they were
[19:53] judgement by endure the same persecution
[19:58] endure the jibes they the gabs this
[20:01] scoffings the mockings the the jailings
[20:05] whatever words we stand by it and walk
[20:09] by the word
[20:10] and joyfully holding to
[20:13] god's unchanging hand amen through
[20:16] difficult times serve the lord
[20:20] through trouble sometimes serve the lord
[20:23] through all manner of times hold to the
[20:26] word of
[20:27] god and worship him and serve him
[20:30] in spirit and in truth
[20:35] there's so many have a lot of spirit the
[20:38] pentecostals have a lot of that
[20:40] but he says he's not asking about you
[20:43] worship him
[20:44] only in spirit being spirited about
[20:48] it which we ought to be but you must
[20:50] have a
[20:51] balance of spirit
[20:54] and truth you rejoice in the truth
[20:58] and that puts you in the spirit so but
[21:00] you must first have the truth
[21:02] you don't think you're gonna jump you're
[21:04] gonna run you're gonna
[21:05] shout you're gonna have music and you're
[21:07] gonna beat down the truth
[21:09] no the truth must first be revealed to
[21:13] you
[21:13] and then all those other things will be
[21:16] added
[21:17] unto you praise god hallelujah
[21:20] amen hallelujah one

[21:43] that is the second thing you you do not
[21:46] just
[21:46] hold to the word but all to his name
[21:50] hallelujah to whom can we go
[21:53] thou hast the words of eternal life
[21:56] holding fast to the word of god

[22:06] you know
[22:07] i'm just hanging on no we're not just
[22:10] hanging on
[22:11] with the word of god hoping
[22:15] hoping that we're going to be saved
[22:19] hoping that we're not going to go to
[22:21] hell no
[22:22] those kinds of fears are gone completely
[22:27] amen we have no fatalistic
[22:30] ideal or idea of where we are going

[24:46] nothing else but the truth and the will
[24:49] of god
[24:50] we have no fork town we have not the
[24:54] tongue of a deceitful
[24:55] lying serpent but we have the
[24:59] tongue of god hallelujah not tongues
[25:02] that they are talking about but amen
[25:06] but we have that tongue that confesses
[25:09] the name of jesus christ is lord
[25:12] and lord alone and everything
[25:15] whatsoever we do we
[25:19] do it in the name of all lord jesus
[25:22] christ
[25:23] hallelujah and because we name his name
[25:27] we separate ourselves from
[25:30] all uncleanness all iniquity
[25:34] all evil all wrongdoing
[25:38] and when we make mistakes which we will
[25:41] for we are still
[25:42] in our flesh we are not out of here we
[25:44] still
[25:45] will make mistakes not presumptuously
[25:49] but if we sin we have an
[25:52] advocate with the father we have a
[25:55] lawyer
[25:56] jesus christ who will argue our case
[25:59] plea the blood and forgive us of our
[26:02] sins
[26:03] and of our iniquities praise god
[26:06] hallelujah
[26:07] we stand upon the word of god and we are
[26:11] willing to
[26:12] die for this word in this day
[26:15] and for this hour because we are
[26:18] promised and we have this assurance
[26:22] of a better resurrection
[26:25] when we cross the river or when we
[26:29] pass through the valley of shadow of
[26:32] death into the valley of death that we
[26:35] will
[26:36] come to this place where we have a
[26:39] better resurrection
[26:41] no wonder the song says take
[26:44] the name of jesus with you
[26:48] child of sorrow and avoid
[26:53] it will joy and comfort give
[26:57] you take it then wherever you go
[27:02] yes precious name oh
[27:05] how sweet hope of earth
[27:08] and joy of heaven
[27:12] oh precious name
[27:15] oh how sweet hope of
[27:18] earth and joy
[27:21] of heaven think of it
[27:25] way back in the second century
[27:28] they were already using the words
[27:32] father son and holy ghost
[27:37] they were already propounding teaching
[27:42] bringing into doctrine paganism
[27:46] being inserted into
[27:49] genuine christianity
[27:52] preaching a gospel of many gods
[27:56] preaching and teaching the polytheistic
[28:00] idea meaning many
[28:03] polytheistic idea
[28:07] of three gods and later
[28:10] made it a and sanctioned it as an
[28:16] official
[28:18] doctrine in the false
[28:21] church not in the true church
[28:25] but it was propounded propagated
[28:29] and pronounced as a as a
[28:32] a doctrine as official doctrine
[28:37] within the ranks of the false church
[28:41] would not not be long until they
[28:45] expunged or took away
[28:48] the name of jesus christ
[28:52] and subtly cunningly
[28:56] substituted in the place of that name
[29:01] lord jesus christ they're substituted
[29:05] father son and holy
[29:08] ghost titles
[29:12] satan's sleight of hand
[29:16] it was a hand trick of it it was satan
[29:19] which has
[29:20] a sleight of hand slipping around with
[29:23] titles and a name and trying to replace
[29:27] the name of the lord
[29:30] jesus christ with
[29:34] father son and holy ghost
[29:38] but of course we know that those are not
[29:41] names they're only titles
[29:44] amen but yet many
[29:48] apostasize or fell away from the true
[29:51] faith
[29:52] many embraced
[29:56] that doctrine of father son and holy
[29:59] ghost
[29:59] as they do to this day
[30:02] that is why the bible tells of mystery
[30:05] babylon
[30:07] the mother of harlots her
[30:10] daughters all these denominations that
[30:14] have come
[30:15] out from the catholic church and have
[30:17] become
[30:18] protestants so called
[30:21] they came out but they still embrace the
[30:25] doctrine of their mother they still
[30:28] embrace the trinitarian
[30:32] doctrine of many gods
[30:36] now look if you tell one lie
[30:39] more lightly you'll tell too and if
[30:42] once you tell one lie you tell two then
[30:44] you can tell any amount after that
[30:48] once the devil got them to shift
[30:51] from believing what god had said hero is
[30:54] real
[30:55] i the lord thy god and one lord
[30:58] and could shift them to believing in two
[31:01] three gods
[31:02] after a while he can get you believing
[31:03] in a million gods he can have you
[31:05] believe in everything else so don't look
[31:08] at the hindus
[31:10] or or some other group of people that
[31:12] believe in
[31:13] gods with many heads many hands and or
[31:16] many gods because it's the same
[31:19] thing if you fail in
[31:22] one then you're guilty of all
[31:27] you move off the foundation of one god
[31:29] to three gods
[31:31] you can act any other god don't you see
[31:34] certain
[31:35] denominational churches can go into any
[31:37] country
[31:39] and still be accepted because those
[31:42] priests and those teachers realize
[31:46] that what they are teaching of their
[31:47] many gods is just the same thing as you
[31:50] with your three
[31:51] so they can get along with that real
[31:54] good but you come along preaching
[31:56] only one now it
[31:59] gets the devils back up
[32:02] that cat who was so nice and
[32:06] and so beautiful and nice to stroke
[32:09] when you come and you bring the truth up
[32:12] the word of god that this
[32:14] one god and the name is jesus christ all
[32:17] of a sudden that denomination
[32:18] claws come out then all of a sudden
[32:21] starts to scratch and
[32:23] ready to cheer and destroy call your
[32:26] names put you in the mud and draw you
[32:29] down as much as it could you see there
[32:31] are daughters
[32:32] of their old mother mystery babylon
[32:38] which is not one denomination
[32:42] but babylon is the entire system
[32:46] now you can take it from this point of
[32:49] view the commercial system
[32:51] of mr babylon the educational system
[32:55] of mr babylon the political
[32:58] system of mr babylon and the religious
[33:03] system of mystery babylon so it's
[33:06] one great worldwide encompassing
[33:11] system controlled by satan
[33:14] oh my friends that god has called us
[33:18] out of babylon oh praise god
[33:22] our hearts rejoice our tongues are made
[33:25] to
[33:25] laugh we are like them that dream
[33:28] hallelujah
[33:29] come out god says and we come out from
[33:32] babylon by the power of the holy spirit
[33:35] and the unfolding revelation of the word
[33:39] of god
[33:40] oh take god amen or praise god
[33:44] while they are baptizing
[33:47] using the titles of god instead of his
[33:51] name
[33:52] and deceiving those poor people
[33:55] that they have a genuine baptism when it
[33:58] is not so it's contrary to the word of
[34:02] god
[34:03] you will not find in your bible
[34:06] any of the apostles baptizing
[34:10] anybody anywhere in the bible
[34:14] in the titles of father son and holy not
[34:16] even peter
[34:19] when they ask him unto what shall we be
[34:21] baptized
[34:22] he said be baptized in repent
[34:25] and be baptized every one of you in the
[34:28] name of jesus christ it's in your bible
[34:32] you can read it again and again and
[34:35] again
[34:36] and again for there is no other name
[34:39] given on the heaven
[34:40] but the name of our lord jesus christ
[34:43] and so
[34:44] the little flock of jesus
[34:47] that faithful few that follow in the
[34:50] footsteps of the
[34:51] faithful apostles and prophets that have
[34:55] gone before us
[34:57] that faithful few have come in obedient
[35:01] submission
[35:02] humility consecration to be
[35:05] baptized in the name of their husband
[35:09] jesus christ is the name hallelujah
[35:13] we don't want to be baptized into what
[35:15] he is
[35:16] he's a mechanic he's a carpenter he's
[35:18] he's a painter
[35:20] no that's not his name god is her father
[35:22] god came
[35:23] as a son god is spirit and he is the
[35:26] holy spirit that's what he
[35:28] is but that name is the lord jesus
[35:31] christ
[35:32] and we come to receive his name
[35:35] as his bride as his people to carry his
[35:40] name with faith with confidence with
[35:43] pride
[35:44] knowing that in him we move and have
[35:47] our being thank god hallelujah
[35:50] so many are dishonoring that name today
[35:54] turning uh turning and taking three gods
[35:58] bowing down before idols
[36:02] changing his name into titles
[36:05] amen my friends but thank god like
[36:09] saint martin who held to the word of god
[36:14] and god bore him witness
[36:17] by signs by wonders
[36:20] by the salvation of many souls
[36:24] that same god is still effectual
[36:28] amongst his people and in the hearts
[36:31] and in the lives of his believers

[36:38] the word of god yes

[37:01] anyone comes and asks you about the
[37:04] faith that dwells within you you do not

[38:36] in his fate that made this man
[38:41] hold fed through his faith
[38:45] amen so the name of jesus

[38:52] whole
[38:52] you see they are still believing they
[38:55] are saved by
[38:56] faith in jesus
[38:59] but we are speaking about receiving the
[39:01] faith
[39:02] or revelation of jesus
[39:06] hallelujah flesh and blood has not
[39:09] revealed this unto you
[39:10] but my father which is in heaven has
[39:12] revealed this unto you hallelujah
[39:15] faith is a revelation
[39:19] we're not talking about just believing
[39:21] but we're talking about
[39:22] having a understanding a revelation from
[39:25] the word of god
[39:28] the faith of jesus christ the
[39:31] name of jesus and the faith
[39:34] of jesus not just faith in jesus
[39:39] i repeat but the faith of jesus
[39:42] hallelujah that's the faith that's the
[39:45] perfect
[39:46] faith that's the rapture in faith that's

[40:07] amen my friends

[40:13] speaking of
[40:15] revelation 2 13 you have not denied my
[40:19] faith his faith my faith he said
[40:22] his faith is not just faith in him
[40:26] praise god but his own
[40:29] faith the faith of
[40:32] jesus christ in the heart
[40:36] of his believers that they can be they
[40:39] can believe and trust him
[40:40] with incredibly impossible so-called
[40:43] they can trust him for
[40:45] anything this is the creator the fate of
[40:48] your creator
[40:49] the faith of him in you that you
[40:52] yourself
[40:53] don't know how you could actually have
[40:56] that kind of a faith that kind of a
[41:00] understanding that kind of clarity
[41:03] coming from
[41:04] the spirit of the living god romans
[41:08] 12 13 to every man
[41:11] is given a measure of faith
[41:14] by grace are you saved through faith
[41:18] and that faith is not of yourself
[41:22] it is a gift of god and it's
[41:25] james 2 1 my brethren
[41:28] have not the faith of our lord jesus
[41:34] with respect of persons hallelujah
[41:37] you see the churches which the satan
[41:40] working through
[41:41] the churches in that first and second
[41:45] century
[41:46] were trying to subtly humanize
[41:50] salvation adding on a little bit of good
[41:54] works
[41:55] adding on a little bit of this and a
[41:57] little bit of that
[41:59] instead of being able to say salvation
[42:02] is of the lord salvation
[42:06] is a gift of god salvation
[42:09] is election it's revelation by the holy
[42:12] spirit
[42:13] not of the works of man not to the will
[42:16] of man
[42:17] not of the blood of men but of the blood
[42:19] of christ hallelujah
[42:21] that takes place within our heart
[42:24] hallelujah amen so what the word the
[42:27] devil was trying to do
[42:29] through his church franchise
[42:33] was to subtly push away
[42:36] and hide from the people the doctrine
[42:40] of election
[42:43] that if you are a true seed of god
[42:46] you did not just begin now
[42:50] you did not just get salvation now
[42:54] you were always saved
[42:57] in him but the word
[43:01] opens up to you for you to recognize
[43:05] that you are not just a creature of time
[43:09] but you come from eternity hallelujah
[43:13] you were lost in time but god has
[43:16] brought the light of his word to oatmeal
[43:20] rised
[43:20] for you to recognize where you come from
[43:23] and therefore you have to go back where
[43:25] you
[43:26] come from for no man can ascend up to
[43:28] heaven
[43:29] if and except he first came down from
[43:32] heaven
[43:33] praise god hallelujah we're going back
[43:36] where we come from
[43:37] just like the rain has to go back where
[43:40] it comes from
[43:41] the sun pulls it right back where it
[43:44] comes from
[43:45] and the son of god will pull you right
[43:48] back where
[43:49] you'll come from when you trust in him
[43:52] oh glory to god hallelujah
[43:55] amen and when they push aside that
[43:57] doctrine of election
[43:59] it opened wide the church doors and
[44:02] everybody can run in and say they're
[44:04] saved
[44:05] they just have to go and cry a little
[44:06] bit at the altar
[44:08] and say lord i'm for sorry for my sins
[44:11] and they may be sincere but if they
[44:13] don't have the seed
[44:14] sincerity without the seed
[44:17] doesn't save you my friends only if
[44:21] there's a
[44:22] life on the seat of god placed there
[44:24] without you having to do anything to get
[44:27] it it's a gift of god
[44:29] then it comes together seed
[44:32] sincerity repentance salvation
[44:36] god opens up the door for you praise god
[44:41] but they pushed away the doctrine of
[44:43] election
[44:45] open up their doors give them great
[44:48] numbers
[44:50] lots of money lots and altering
[44:55] big names largest churches in the land
[44:59] why because they push away the doctrine
[45:02] that doctrine of election and open wide
[45:05] the doors
[45:06] for everything snakes
[45:09] frogs tadpoles spiders
[45:14] all kinds of things to come in the
[45:16] church rats
[45:18] wolves and all kinds of sneaky snakes
[45:22] to come in monkeys pirates
[45:26] to come in inside of the door
[45:29] amen when they rejected that doctrine
[45:33] of election hallelujah
[45:36] and then it shifted from
[45:39] all those instead of having the people
[45:42] believe all
[45:43] of the word they subtly shift them away
[45:46] to believe their church tenants
[45:49] their church doctrines their church
[45:51] teachings
[45:52] and if their church teachings
[45:56] sounds like the word even has part of
[45:58] the word
[45:59] but they change one little hair and one
[46:02] little there
[46:02] person doesn't detect it because they're
[46:05] trusting that leadership
[46:07] that that that church fundamentals
[46:11] that were given to them is the truth and
[46:14] so they take it
[46:15] all and let me use a term here
[46:18] swallowing it like a fish wool hook
[46:22] line and sinker they put a little meat
[46:25] over the hook
[46:27] drop it down the person's truth and they
[46:30] believe it all because they're seeing
[46:32] one little thing that may be true and
[46:34] they swallow the meat but there's a hook
[46:36] in it
[46:37] and there it is my friends oh god have
[46:40] mercy
[46:41] they push away never mind the word
[46:44] this is what our church believes and get
[46:47] the people to hold to that
[46:48] and so there was a period of rapid
[46:50] degradation
[46:53] from the word of god
[46:56] and they drifted away from god's word
[47:00] hallelujah amen today's
[47:04] church is filled with a lot of people
[47:07] that that only mentally believe
[47:11] it's true their mind can process the
[47:14] bible
[47:14] their mind can process english and they
[47:17] can say oh
[47:18] that's logical that's true but it's not
[47:21] a revelation to the heart
[47:24] by the holy spirit amen
[47:27] we cannot be saved except by the
[47:31] faith of jesus christ himself or the
[47:34] revelation
[47:35] of jesus christ himself for upon this
[47:38] rock
[47:39] i'll build my church and the gates of
[47:42] hell
[47:42] shall not prevail against it amen
[47:46] not by endorsing the virgin mary
[47:50] not by endorsing a certain church
[47:52] doctrine
[47:55] then i even go to endorse i believe in
[47:57] the blood of jesus
[48:00] it's not even being faithful in just
[48:03] going to church
[48:05] are faithful to taking communion
[48:09] and you're not reborn at all because in
[48:12] the first
[48:13] place you have not yet received
[48:17] light from heaven an epiphany from god
[48:22] a revelation by the holy spirit
[48:25] oh praise god forevermore
[48:29] amen human faith is not enough
[48:32] for me to say i believe that's your
[48:36] human faith amen that's not enough
[48:39] it takes the very revelation or faith
[48:43] of the son of god to drop into
[48:46] our hearts so that we can receive
[48:50] that lord of glory into
[48:54] our temple his temple not
[48:58] made with human hands no you're not
[49:01] you are the temple of the living god oh
[49:04] my your body is the temple of the living
[49:08] god
[49:09] a living faith a living god
[49:13] because we live by the faith of the son
[49:16] of god
[49:17] paul did not say he lived by faith in
[49:21] the son of god but he said i live
[49:24] by the faith of the son
[49:27] of god that has given his life for me
[49:31] and keeps me living in christian victory
[49:34] hallelujah it's he that's keeping me
[49:37] it's not me keeping myself
[49:39] going around and feeling i have to have
[49:42] the strength to keep myself
[49:44] no i am always willing to cry out lord
[49:47] help me
[49:48] lord please forgive me lord cleanse me
[49:51] lord provide for me everything i
[49:54] cast my cares upon him and i trust him
[49:59] he cares for me
[50:02] hallelujah praise god living by faith
[50:07] in jesus above oh praise god
[50:12] i know thy works
[50:16] that you have not denied my faith
[50:19] you have kept the truth alive
[50:22] by carrying my name hallelujah
[50:26] and thus you are counted worthy
[50:30] to be one with him and we have set forth
[50:33] in the word an
[50:34] example of one such person whom the
[50:36] bible describes as
[50:38] and to pass my faithful
[50:41] martyr this is a scriptural example
[50:45] of one who lived by the plum line
[50:49] one who walked in the footsteps
[50:52] of the faithful who have gone before us
[50:55] oh praise god this brother
[50:59] his name is only mentioned here
[51:03] inscribed in holy scripture
[51:06] and what it mentions is his faithfulness
[51:10] unto the lord he was a christian
[51:14] a real believer he had the name of jesus
[51:19] he had the faith of jesus
[51:22] and he live by the faith
[51:27] of our lord jesus oh praise
[51:30] god we take god for an example
[51:33] as our brother antipas
[51:36] maybe all trust the word of god
[51:41] listen to james have not the faith
[51:44] of our lord jesus christ with respect of
[51:48] persons
[51:49] oh praise god we should all be
[51:52] like stephen in the book of acts full of
[51:55] faith and power
[51:56] or praise god going forth in the name of
[52:00] jesus christ
[52:01] amen hallelujah not respecting
[52:05] persons because of power position color
[52:09] religion whatever but hold of god's
[52:12] unchanging word and his unchanging
[52:16] hand amen praise god
[52:19] taking a stand and i would turn back
[52:23] i have took my stand many years ago
[52:26] and i've been running for jesus a long
[52:29] time
[52:29] and i'm not turning back but i'm holding
[52:32] the gods unchanging hand
[52:36] amen yes philip died
[52:40] but he died like a bell and his
[52:43] in his his blood still
[52:47] speaks to this hour to this day
[52:51] giving testimony hallelujah and witness
[52:55] to god
[52:56] because the names are written in the
[52:58] word antipas
[53:01] a bell stephen
[53:04] it's written in the word of god
[53:07] hallelujah
[53:08] glory to god amen and their voices
[53:12] speak though it appears like they're
[53:15] dead yet they live
[53:16] for their speaking by and through the
[53:19] word
[53:20] by the holy spirit though
[53:23] amen praise god so take god
[53:27] another faithful martyr another faithful
[53:31] one a servant of the lord was led to his
[53:35] rest
[53:36] for believing the word of god
[53:39] satan did not triumph over him
[53:43] even as he did not triumph over
[53:46] the lord jesus when he tried to kill the
[53:49] prince of peace
[53:51] the moment he thought he won he actually
[53:55] lost amen for
[53:58] satan was disspoiled
[54:01] destroyed and attacked his kingdom was
[54:05] ransacked as i preached last sunday
[54:08] jesus went down into the valley
[54:11] of death took away the prisoners
[54:16] that were in there and set them
[54:19] free by the power of almighty god
[54:22] hallelujah
[54:23] amen and saw the blood of enterprise
[54:27] and and the cry of that voice
[54:31] of the spirit from enterprise is now in
[54:34] the hearts of
[54:35] thousands of believers who will
[54:38] also take up their cross
[54:41] and follow the lord jesus christ
[54:44] all my friends may god bless you
[54:48] may the lord keep you on cause's face to
[54:51] shine
[54:52] upon you and grant you peace
[54:56] as we walk in the footsteps of the
[54:59] faithful
[55:00] i'm remembering the story of one man
[55:04] who drank a lot and one
[55:07] winter dale out here in north america
[55:10] he decided to go to the bar to get a
[55:13] drink
[55:14] and he went out into the snow walking
[55:19] going to the bar and happened to look
[55:22] behind
[55:24] and what did he see there was his son
[55:27] slipped out of the door and was walking
[55:31] behind him
